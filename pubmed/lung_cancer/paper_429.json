This study presents findings from a nationwide survey conducted between November 2023 and January 2024, capturing clinician perceptions of POCTs. Methods: The survey was distributed via email to healthcare professionals through academic and industry listservs and through LinkedIn posts. A total of 159 responses were analyzed. Results: Core priorities, including accuracy, ease of use, and availability, remain consistently valued over the years. However, several perceived benefits, including continuous patient monitoring, diagnostic certainty, and patient management exhibited significant declines in agreement compared to previous years. Despite this, clinician perceptions of POCTs’ abilities to enhance patient–provider communication remained stable. Evolving concerns may reflect heightened expectations and greater scrutiny as these technologies become commonplace. Agreement that POCTs may undermine clinical expertise increases, while concerns related to reimbursement and usability decline. Pilot questions related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) indicated moderate openness to adopting AI-enhanced POCTs, particularly with tools offering novel clinical insights. Conclusions: While POCTs continue to be an asset in clinical settings, the findings of this study suggest a shift in provider attitudes toward a more neutral standpoint. Limitations include a low response rate, self-selection, and missing demographic data from a subset of participants. Future surveys will further integrate AI/ML-related questions while prioritizing broader demographic and geographic reach.

The survey was conducted from November 2023 to January 2024. Our analysis builds on previous surveys conducted between 2019 and 2021, which consistently highlighted three priorities of POCTs among healthcare professionals: accuracy, ease of use, and availability [ 1 12 Materials and methods Survey Development and Distribution The 2023 POCT survey was a cross-sectional study developed following methodologies established in previous POCT surveys conducted in 2019, 2020 and 2021 [ 1 8 13 The distribution list included both internal and external email directories, academic medical centers (AMCs), and professional organizations. Contacts were obtained from large directories including the University of Massachusetts Center for Clinical Translational Science, Massachusetts Medical Device Development Center, UMass Memorial Health, Consortia for Improving Medicine with Innovation and Technology, Center for Advancing Point of Care Technologies, National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), and other directories within the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute including the NIH Center for Accelerated Innovations, Small Business Research Initiative, and Research Evaluation and Commercialization Health lists. The broad distribution to academic and clinical professionals likely introduced bias toward regions such as the Northeast and professionals who practice at AMCs. No weighting adjustments were applied to account for regional or specialty-based sampling imbalances. The survey was launched on 16 November 2023 and closed on 31 January 2024. It was distributed through email and via a LinkedIn invitation post. The exact number of individuals who received the email is unknown; however, based on the listserv populations, it is estimated to be over 15,000. To encourage response, reminder emails were sent monthly for the duration of the survey’s availability. To compensate respondents for their time, a $25 gift card was offered. Although self-exclusion was the only formal exclusion criteria, survey instructions specified the target population as healthcare professionals. While unique links were not utilized, obvious duplicate responses were culled and removed from data analysis. No formal glossary was provided within the survey tool. This may have led to variable interpretations of terms such as “device footprint” and “Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-CLIA” among respondents. 159 responses were eligible for analysis. While all participants were offered compensation for their participation in this survey, 22 respondents chose to provide contact information and were compensated. The study was deemed exempt from review by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) by the UMass Chan Medical School IRB (Docket #H00018195). We followed the Consensus-Based Checklist for Reporting of Survey Studies to guide the development and reporting of our methodology and results, ensuring transparency and rigor in our process [ 14 Survey Content, Data Collection, and Storage The first POCT survey was developed in 2019 to assess healthcare professionals’ opinions of POCTs, which specifically compared the responses from providers in cardiovascular medicine to other healthcare professionals. The 2020 survey included additional questions to assess the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare provider impressions of POCT. In 2021, the COVID-19 section was removed and several new questions were added to encapsulate specific issues that arose due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, additional questions were added to assess the recent rise in AI and ML in POCTs. AI questions were developed based on emerging themes in the digital health literature, internal expert input, and relevance to clinical adoption trends. Due to the omission or addition of specific questions over various iterations, statistical analyses were used only on questions that were identical between the surveys. The complete survey instrument can be found in the S6 Survey. Survey questions were derived from literature review, prior survey distribution and feedback, and expert consensus. The validity of the survey instrument was supported by its foundation on previously published surveys, expert input, and pilot testing. The survey contained multiple sections, including provider and patient perceptions of POCTs, perceived benefits and concerns, and the most important characteristics of a POCT. Additional closed-ended questions allowed respondents to list up to five conditions that could benefit from POCT, and demographic information including gender, age, race, ethnicity, profession, practice environment, and years in practice. Likewise, geographic area of practice was collected via a closed-ended question, allowing participants to choose the state in which their practice is located. Participants were not required to answer the questions in totality, and all responses remained anonymous. Missing responses were permitted and not imputed in the data analysis. Questions measuring general POCT matters were adapted from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) 2016 Strategic Vision and a survey developed by the researchers from the Point-of-Care Technology Research Network (POCTRN) center at Johns Hopkins University [ 4 15 16 17 The survey was generated by a Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) interface; the secure server is hosted on the UMass Chan network [ 18 Data Analysis Responses from most questions used a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree with the given statement. Survey responses were grouped into two categories for analysis: agreement (responses indicating “Strongly Agree” or “Agree”) and disagreement (responses indicating “Strongly Disagree” or “Disagree”). Checkbox selections for medical specialties were categorized based on an adapted list of standard medical specialties [ 19 The importance of various characteristics of POCTs was gathered through a ranking tool. While the ranking tool was adapted from prior surveys, the fixed list of characteristics may limit comprehensiveness. The ordered list may introduce primacy and recency bias. Future iterations may incorporate additional terms including precision, safety, patient comfort, speed of testing, and an optional space for unique responses. Analysis of important characteristics of POCTs was determined using the following system: 1 st nd Data analysis was conducted using Excel v2502. Chi-square tests were used to assess differences in responses regarding the benefits and concerns of POCTs. Two-proportion Z Results A total of 159 respondents replied to the 2023 survey. Of those who completed the demographics questions, 49 (48%) identified as male and 51 (46%) as female. Fourteen (13%) respondents were Hispanic or Latino, while 79 (76%) were not. 68 (64%) of the participants self-identified as White, whereas 12 (11%) as Black or African American, 14 (13%) as Asian, 5 (5%) as American Indian or Native Alaskan, and 7 (7%) preferred not to answer. One-quarter of the respondents have been in practice for over 20 years, while over half have been in practice for between 0 and 10 years (25 (24%) for 0 – 5 years and 28 (27%) for 6 – 10 years, respectively). Fifty-one (47%) respondents were physicians, 32 (20%) were advanced practice providers, 14 (13%) were registered nurses, and 12 (11%) identified as “other,” including researchers. Half of the respondents (53) were from the Northeast, while 22 (21%) were from the South, 19 (18%) from the West, and 11 (10%) from the Midwest. Three-quarters, 79 (76%) were employed in hospital or ambulatory clinics (Table 1  Table 1.

The findings demonstrate a tempered perspective, characterized by a reduction in both perceived concerns and perceived benefits. Notably, there was a decline in agreement with several benefit-related statements, indicating reduced confidence in the clinical utility of POCTs. Decreased agreement with statements including “POCTs allow for continuous patient monitoring” and “POCTs improve patient management” may reflect a growing skepticism about the role of POCTs in clinical workflows. This shift in perception could suggest that, with more experience, providers are encountering limitations, such as inconsistent or inaccurate patient use, which may undermine the clinical effectiveness of continuous patient monitoring and management. A mix of benefits and limitations was observed in a survey of clinicians who conduct cervical cancer screening in Indiana [ 20 21 Perceived benefits peaked in 2021 according to the heat map, with a substantial decrease in the subsequent 2023 survey. Perceived concerns have experienced a more gradual decline throughout the years 2020 – 2023. One notable statement of concern is “POCTs undermine clinical expertise,” which more than doubled in agreement rate (5.3% in 2020 and 2021 to 11.2% in 2023). In conjunction with the statistically significant decreases in agreement with the statements “POCTs improve clinician confidence in decision-making” and “POCTs decrease overprescribing of drugs such as antibiotics,” the results suggest that POCTs are now viewed with more caution. Possible explanations may include providers growing more critical of POCTs as they continue to integrate and interact with them in routine care workflows, or a heightened awareness of their limitations in clinical settings as their weaknesses become more apparent [ 22 23 However, it is important to note that not all areas of POCT perception have declined. Healthcare providers continue to value POCTs’ interpersonal aspects, as evidenced by non-significant changes related to improving the provider-patient relationship and enhancing communication. The stability in perceived interpersonal benefits demonstrates the continued relevance of POCTs in enhancing patient engagement and satisfaction, a critical aspect of healthcare delivery. Concerns about POCTs have evolved. Several concerns including “POCTs take up too much of my time” and “POCTs are difficult to use” showed non-significant changes, while concerns about the POCTs undermining clinical expertise have increased. These shifts in concerns may be indicative of a growing complexity related to integrating POCTs into clinical workflows as they are more widely used, along with the challenge of accurate results and maintaining clinical autonomy when necessary. The decrease in concerns related to the reimbursement for POCTs may suggest that clinicians are facing fewer financial obstacles to POCT implementation. This contrasts with the high levels of concern regarding reimbursement in the prior 2021 survey [ 1 While our study highlights important trends surrounding the perceived benefits and concerns of POCTs, some limitations must be considered. The sample size was relatively small for the 2023 survey compared to the aggregate data from previous years, which may impact the robustness of our results. Additionally, 49 participants did not complete the demographic questions, limiting our ability to analyze responses by provider characteristics. The study’s low response rate may introduce selection bias, specifically with underrepresentation of non-academic, rural, and non-Northeastern-based providers. Such factors may limit the generalizability of results to other geographic locations and practice settings. Respondents’ academic affiliations may also skew perspectives toward early adopters of technology. Survey respondents practiced in a variety of in-hospital, outpatient, home, and emergency department clinics, suggesting that these findings are generalizable to a number of clinical environments. Additional limitations are described above in the methods section, such as self-selection, multiple participation, and individual variability in survey term interpretation. In future surveys, these questions should be required while offering a “prefer not to answer” option to respect participant privacy while balancing data completeness. Additional qualitative research may uncover the underlying factors influencing these shifting attitudes. Building off the successful AI/ML pilot questions, our future survey will focus on AI/ML technologies, perceptions, integration practices, and trust. Patient perspectives are also critical for the successful implementation of POCTs. While this survey focused on clinician perspectives, our team has previously reported on patient perspectives in two related studies. [ 24 25 Conclusion While POCTs continue to be an asset in clinical settings, the findings of this study suggest a shift in provider attitudes toward a more neutral standpoint – fewer perceived benefits and fewer perceived concerns when compared to three previous surveys between 2019 – 2021. As the healthcare ecosystem continues to evolve, it will be crucial to address these concerns and explore strategies to bolster confidence in POCTs while keeping patient safety and improved outcomes at the forefront. The three most important characteristics of POCTs have remained consistent throughout the 2020, 2021, and 2023 surveys with accuracy, ease of use, and availability being most highly valued. As POCTs and AI/ML-bolstered technologies continue to infiltrate the healthcare ecosystem and clinical workflows, it is crucial to understand clinician perspectives of such tools continuously. Future surveys should include additional AI and ML-centered questions, acknowledging the recent boom in technological advancements, and targeting more diverse and geographically widespread regions to gain a more comprehensive understanding of clinicians’ viewpoints.
