SUMMARY Recent studies have shown an association of the number of tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) with the prognosis and treatment outcomes of ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This study aimed to examine the correlation between CD86 and CD163 macrophage expression and clinical-pathological characteristics of the disease in patients operated on for pancreatic carcinoma. A retrospective research was conducted in which the archival materials of the Ljudevit Jurak Department of Pathology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center were used together with all relevant patient clinical data obtained from the Hospital Information System on 76 patients operated on for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In our study, the number of CD86 macrophages and the CD86/CD163 ratio showed a statistically significant correlation with increasing T and N stages of the disease. The number of CD163 macrophages did not show a statistically significant correlation with the mentioned variables. These results indicated that in our clinical conditions, proinflammatory (M1) macrophages were more expressed in locally advanced tumor stages with worse long-term prognoses. In conclusion, TAMs could be a valid prognostic marker or even a target for therapeutic agents but more studies will be needed to fully comprehend the impact of M1/M2 differentiation.

In addition to forecasting the outcome of treatment, the goal of research into the expression of these antigens is the body immune response to their presence, which could enable development of tumor-specific vaccines but most research is still in early stages and without conclusive findings ( 20 Macrophages are a type of white blood cells that originate from monocytes and are responsible for various immune functions in the human body, and are found in almost all tissues ( 21 22 23 24 25 26 in vitro 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Materials and Methods Archival material kept at the Ljudevit Jurak Department of Pathology and Cytology, Sestre milosrdnice University Hospital Center (UHC), obtained after resection of the pancreas due to ductal adenocarcinoma in the period from January 1, 2003 until December 31, 2019, was used in the study. Only those patients who met the following conditions were included in the research: all the necessary clinical data and appropriate histopathologic findings and follow-up were available; and no malignant tumor other than pancreatic cancer. Patients with early postoperative mortality (<30 days) were also excluded. Seventy-six patients met all the criteria and were included in the study. Patient data were collected from the Hospital Information System of the Sestre milosrdnice UHC, while data on the date of death were collected from the Cancer Registry of the Croatian Institute of Public Health. The Ethics Board of both the Hospital and the University of Zagreb approved the research. The material was processed by a standard histologic method that includes tissue fixation in 10% buffered formalin and mounting in paraffin blocks, cutting to a 5-µm thickness, deparaffinization, and staining with the standard hematoxylin and eosin (HE) method. Primary monoclonal antibodies were used for immunohistochemical analysis, i.e., CD86 (ab234401, Abcam, UK) and CD163 (ab156769, Abcam, UK), for M1 and M2 macrophages. Immunohistochemical analysis for the mentioned antibodies was performed with the EnVision FLEX-PTL method as a visualization system on a Dako Autostainer automated machine for immunohistochemical staining ( Figs. 1 and 2 Fig. 1 Positive immunohistochemical reaction of macrophages in the tumor area to CD86 (magnification X200). Fig. 2 Negative immunohistochemical reaction of macrophages in the tumor area to CD86 (magnification X200). On statistical data processing, the time of taking the sample during the operation was the starting point of the research. The endpoint was overall patient survival. The goal of data analysis was to analyze the relationship between the number of CD86, CD163 and the ratio of CD86/CD163 positive intratumoral macrophages in pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples. The number and ratio of CD86 and CD163 macrophages were compared with histopathologic characteristics of the tumor, i.e., tumor size, depth of invasion (pT stage) of the tumor, status of regional lymph nodes (pN stage) and lymphovascular invasion, and variables of surgical treatment, i.e., complications, reoperation, type of operation, and positive resection margin. Immunohistochemical and histopathologic variables were compared with patient clinical characteristics, i.e., age, gender and experience. Analysis of the normality of data distribution was checked with the Smirnov-Kolmogorov test, and according to the results obtained, parametric and nonparametric tests were used, as well as the corresponding display of continuous values (arithmetic mean and standard deviation (SD), or median). A binary outcome (alive or deceased) is indicated by census. A large number of variables were foreseen and tests were used that can compensate for unfavorable ratios of the number of respondents and variables. In order to reduce the potentially negative influence of a small number of subjects on testing a large number of variables, it is planned to perform a multivariate Cox regression analysis (with time to event as follow-up time in months). Then, for each variable that would show a statistically significant association with survival, the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was performed and a cut-off value was determined using the Youden J factor in order to convert continuous variables into categorical ones, as 0 = below the cut-off value and 1 = above the cut-off value . Using categorical variables arranged in this way, results were presented with the Kaplan Meier survival curve. As a confirmatory method, a principal component analysis with oblimin rotation was performed in order to separate groups of variables that appear together and to confirm the results of the multivariate regression analysis. Variables were compared with each other using Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient. All statistical tests were two-tailed. Values of p less than and equal to 0.05 were determined to be statistically significant. Statistical data processing was done using the MedCalc program (Version 11.2.1 © 1993-2010; MedCalc Software bvba Software, Mariakerke, Belgium) and SPSS program (Version 22.0 Released in 2013; IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Results The study included 76 subjects who were surgically treated for histopathologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas at the Department of Surgery, Sestre milosrdnice UHC, from January 1, 2003 until December 31, 2019. The patients were monitored postoperatively and their oncologic status was recorded. At the time of diagnosis, the patients were free of other clinically detectable malignant diseases. There were 32 male and 44 female patients, yielding a 0.73 male-female ratio. Their mean age was 65.14, range 32-86 years, SD 9.97. The mean age of men was 64.6±10.33, median 65.5 years, and of women 65.6±9.67 years, median 67 years. The mean length of patient follow-up, expressed as arithmetic mean and SD, was 26±22 months. Due to the large SD, the median was a more precise measure of follow-up length and it was 19.33, range 2-129 months. Statistical analysis of the possible associations of the variables with patient survival marked as time to the critical event was performed using multivariate Cox regression (χ 2 (b) type of operation total pancreatectomy (p=0.025, hazard ratio 5.023); (c) occurrence of complications in the postoperative course (p<0.001, hazard ratio 18.691); and (d) need of reoperation (p=0.002, hazard ratio 9.165) The ROC analysis of the number of intratumoral macrophages immunohistochemically marked with CD86 and its association with patient survival showed that the cut-off value was expressed with the help of the Youden index (0.2137) where the specificity and sensitivity were the highest values >3 (sensitivity 76.92%, specificity 44.44% with 95% confidence interval (CI) of 46.2%-95.0% for sensitivity and 31.9%57.5% for specificity). Then, the values of the number of intratumoral macrophages immunohistochemically labeled with CD86 were converted into categorical ones; if the value in the patient sample was >3, it was converted into a categorical variable with a value of 1, and if the value in the patient sample was <3, it was converted into a categorical variable with a value of The relationship between the number of intratumoral macrophages immunohistochemically labeled with CD86 and patient survival was shown using the Kaplan Meier survival curve ( Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Fig. 3 Correlation between the number of intratumoral macrophages immunohistochemically labeled with CD86 and patient survival (p=0.025). Fig. 4 Correlation between the number of intratumoral macrophages immunohistochemically labeled with CD86 and the increase in hazard in relation to patient survival. Statistical analysis using Spearman’s rho correlation coefficient showed that age was not related to other variables, or to CD86 and CD163 values, or to the CD86/CD163 ratio. The number of intratumoral macrophages immunohistochemically labeled with CD86 was significantly positively correlated with the CD86/CD163 ratio (Spearman rho coefficient 0.813, p<0.001), with increasing T category (Spearman rho coefficient 0.223, p=0.05) and N stage of the patients (Spearman rho coefficient 0.229, p=0.046), while the number of intratumoral macrophages immunohistochemically labeled with CD163 did not show significant correlations with other variables. The CD86/CD163 ratio significantly correlated with the number of CD86 (Spearman rho coefficient 0.813, p<0.001) and with increasing T category (Spearman rho coefficient 0.230, p=0.046). The T category positively correlated with the CD86/CD163 ratio (Spearman rho coefficient 0.230, p=0.046), while the N stage positively correlated with the number of CD86 positive macrophages (Spearman rho coefficient 0.229, p=0.046). Resection margins did not show significant correlations with other variables. A larger scope of the initial operation significantly correlated with lower probability of reoperation (Spearman rho coefficient -0.243, p=0.034), and the occurrence of complications significantly correlated with the probability of reoperation (Spearman rho coefficient 0.906, p<0.001) and with male gender (Spearman rho coefficient -0.255, p=0.026). Discussion Ever since the discovery of TAMs, their role has been evaluated and they have come in interest for targeted cancer treatment ( 34 in vitro 35 36 in vitro in vivo 37 27 38 39 Results of clinical parameters (operative results) were as expected, as a more extensive surgical operation indicates a larger or multicentric tumor. This was indicated by the hazard ratio (5.023) for total pancreatectomy as opposed to Whipple’s procedure or distal pancreatectomy. The survival length of the patients was on par with general statistics concerning pancreatic cancer. In our study, the number of CD86 macrophages and the CD86/CD163 ratio showed a statistically significant correlation with increasing T and N stage of the disease. The number of CD163 macrophages did not show a statistically significant correlation with the mentioned variables. These results indicate that in our clinical conditions, proinflammatory (M1) macrophages were more expressed in locally advanced tumor stages with worse long-term prognosis. The reasons for this can be numerous, and seem to indicate that in certain conditions M1 macrophages can also be regarded as a factor in worse treatment outcomes. We tried to analyze and compare our findings with other authors, since some recent studies could not reach a consensus on the prognostic value of M1 and M2 macrophage activation. This unconventional correlation was shown in similar clinical studies concerning gliomas, medulloblastomas, and non-small cell lung cancer ( 40 42 40 41 42 As mentioned earlier, there are new views about the M1/M2 macrophage relationship that should be taken into account, i.e., the process of macrophage activation is complex and includes monocytes ( 43 44 in vivo 36 Still, certain studies tend to receive results that indicate M2 macrophages as the more dominant phenotype in tumor cells in patients with shorter survival spans and more aggressive disease strains ( 45 47 46 47 in vivo Conclusion Regarding pancreatic cancer, TAMs could still be a valid prognostic marker or even a target for therapeutic agents but more studies will be needed to fully comprehend the impact that M1/M2 differentiation plays in battling the generation and spread of this dangerous disease. Other antigens and their effect (such as MAGE, melanoma-associated antigen) are being studied as well ( 48 References 1 Siegel RL Miller KD Jemal A Cancer statistics, 2020.
