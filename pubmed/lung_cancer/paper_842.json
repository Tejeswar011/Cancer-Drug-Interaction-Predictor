Background Intimal sarcoma (IS) is a rare malignant tumor originating from the tunica intima of large blood vessels, mainly in the pulmonary circulation. Prevalence is extremely low (0.001%), with IS of the pulmonary vein even rarer than IS of the pulmonary artery (0.001%-0.003%). Case Summary A 73-year-old man with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor and high-grade urothelial carcinoma was diagnosed with grade 3 pulmonary vein IS during evaluation of probable acute decompensated heart failure. Echocardiography showed a hyperechoic mass extending from the pulmonary vein into the left atrium and protruding into the left ventricle. The patient underwent surgical resection. Discussion Despite invasive interventions, aggressive IS often recurs, making regular imaging follow-up essential for early detection of metastasis and highlighting the need for further research into effective treatment strategies. Take-Home Message This case highlights the importance of including pulmonary vein IS in the differential diagnosis of left atrial masses and the value of multimodality imaging for timely detection and surgical planning.

A COVID-19 test was negative. He had an unquantified fever and had taken empiric azithromycin for 3 days. On examination, he had a heart rate of 90 beats/min, blood pressure of 123/81 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 83% requiring 2 L/min of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula to maintain >92%, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and temperature of 36.5 °C. Chest auscultation revealed increased breath sounds and crackles in both lower lobes; cardiac auscultation was unremarkable. He denied weight loss, night sweats, or chest pain. Take-Home Message • This case highlights the importance of including pulmonary vein intimal sarcoma in the differential diagnosis of left atrial masses and the value of multimodality imaging for timely detection and surgical planning. Past Medical History Medical history included stage IIIA malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor with rhabdomyoblastic differentiation (malignant triton tumor), treated with modified anterior compartment resection and left thigh flap rotation, which was undergoing secondary intention wound healing after 29 radiotherapy sessions. He also had stage I high-grade urothelial carcinoma treated with intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin and adjuvant combined gemcitabine and docetaxel local chemotherapy. Family history included 3 brothers who died of pancreatic cancer. Chronic medications included lercanidipine, bisoprolol, and irbesartan for hypertension, and metformin for type 2 diabetes. Differential Diagnosis Intimal sarcoma (IS) is a rare, aggressive mesenchymal tumor of the large blood vessels, often misdiagnosed due to nonspecific presentation. Differentiation from angiosarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas requires histopathology and advanced imaging. Early identification improves patient outcomes. Investigations The initial laboratory work-up revealed normochromic normocytic anemia (Hb: 12.2 g/dL, MCV: 87.7 fL, MCH: 29.3 pg), moderate thrombocytopenia (90 × 10 3 3 3 Figure 1 Figures 2A to 2C Figures 3A to 3C Figure 1 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Echocardiogram shows sinus rhythm (84 beats/min), normal axis (86°), and bifid P-wave (>120 ms). Figure 2 Chest Computed Tomography (A) Bilateral pleural effusion (green and red shading). (B) Peribronchial thickening and posterior atelectasis.

Figure 3 Chest X-Ray and Lung Ultrasound (A) Chest x-ray showing left pleural effusion before drainage. (B and C) Before and after ultrasound-guided thoracocentesis. Yellow double-sided arrow indicates pleural effusion. Given the suspicion of acute decompensated heart failure, transthoracic echocardiography was conducted and revealed preserved left ventricular systolic function, with a two-dimensional ejection fraction of 62% (modified Simpson method), concentric remodeling (left ventricular mass index: 58 g/m 2 2 2 An unexpected hyperechoic image with regular borders, measuring 8 × 2.2 cm, was visualized, likely originating from the pulmonary veins ( Figures 4A to 4E Video 1 Figures 5A to 5D Videos 2 3 18 Figure 6 Figure 4 2-Dimensional Transthoracic Echocardiography and Color Doppler Images (A) Parasternal long-axis view shows a heterogeneous, mobile mass in the left atrium (LA), protruding toward the mitral valve during diastole. (B) Apical 4-chamber view shows the mass clearly delineated within the LA, with broad-based attachment to the posterior wall. (C) Apical long-axis view demonstrates the mass extending along the longitudinal axis of the LA, confirming proximity to the mitral annulus and dynamic movement during the cardiac cycle. (D) In the apical 2-chamber view, the mass remains visible within the LA and left ventricle (LV). (E) Apical 2-chamber color Doppler view demonstrates mildly preserved flow across the mitral valve; tough partial obstruction during diastole is suggested by transient flow acceleration around the mass. Figure 5 Midesophageal Transesophageal Echocardiography of the LV Confirming Large LA Mass and Demonstrating Origin From the Left Inferior Pulmonary Vein (A) Apical long-axis view at 150° demonstrates a heterogenous, mobile mass with irregular edges, measuring 6.6 × 2.7 cm. In systole, the tumor is in the left atrium (LA); in diastole, it prolapses into the left ventricle (LV), obstructing the LV outflow tract and generating a mean gradient of 5 mm Hg. (B) Apical 4-chamber view at 0° confirms the presence of the tumor protruding from the LA to the LV in diastole. (C) LA appendage view at approximately 13°. The tumor appears to originate from the left inferior pulmonary vein. (D) Transgastric short-axis view shows a mobile mass at the level of the mitral valve, causing obstruction. Figure 6 18 Images show an intraluminal filling defect in the left atrium due to a mass measuring 6.2 × 2.7 cm with an SUV max 18 max Management (Medical/Interventions) On arrival, the patient's oxygen saturation was 88%, improving to >92% with 2 L/min nasal cannula. Nebulized budesonide/formoterol, intravenous ceftriaxone, and vancomycin were given. Surgical resection of the mass involving the LIPV and left atrium was performed via median sternotomy under hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with cardioplegia and aortic cross-clamping. Intraoperatively, a 10 × 5 × 5 cm tumor infiltrating the left atrium, appendage, and mitral annulus, and a 13 × 10 × 8 cm mass in the left lower lobe involving the LIPV were found. A 28-mm Physio II annuloplasty ring (Edwards Lifesciences) was placed, but bypass weaning failed owing to severe mitral regurgitation. Aortic reclamping and mitral valve replacement with a 25-mm Mitris Resilia prothesis (Edwards Lifesciences), plus paravalvular leak repair, were performed, as were frozen biopsy and pulmonary vein reconstruction. On reattempted weaning, biventricular dysfunction and massive hemorrhage caused irreversible cardiogenic shock and death. Histopathology described a 7.0 × 6.5 × 3.0 cm, 42 g tumor with 9 mitoses/mm 2 Figure 7 Figures 8 9 Figure 7 Macroscopic Appearance of Tumor The tumor appears as multiple irregular fragments of reddish-brown soft tissue, with a lobulated and friable appearance. The largest fragment displays a heterogeneous cut surface, with areas of tan-yellow discoloration suggestive of necrosis or degeneration. Figure 8 Photomicrograph With Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining (Magnification 40×) Analysis revealed a malignant neoplasm with an epithelioid appearance, characterized by pleomorphic nuclei, abnormal nuclear membranes, irregular chromatin, prominent nuclei, atypical mitosis, some nuclear pseudoinclusions, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, surrounding slit-like spaces, with a rich vascular stroma. Figure 9 Photomicrographs Showing the Immunohistochemical Staining for Intimal Sarcoma The neoplastic cells were positive for Fli-1, CD31, MDM2, and ERG, which together with the morphologic features confirmed the diagnosis of intimal sarcoma. Discussion Cardiac tumors are a focus of interest in cardio-oncology, posing diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. They are classified as neoplastic (primary and secondary) or non-neoplastic. 1 1 , 2 2 1 , 2 3 3 IS, a rare malignant mesenchymal tumor, arises in the tunica intima of large blood vessels, mainly in the pulmonary circulation. 4 4 , 5 4 1 4 Multimodality imaging can be used to confirm tumor presence, type, and hemodynamic impact. Transthoracic echocardiography is the first tool to assess size, location, mobility, and pericardial involvement. 1 4 1 1 5 1 4 18 3 1 Diagnosing PVIS or PVAS remains challenging, requiring radiological and pathological expertise. Histopathology and immunohistochemical biomarkers are essential for a definitive diagnosis. 6 6 3 7 8 TP53 9 Surgical resection remains the gold standard for improving outcomes, but no specific treatment guidelines exist. 3 3 10 10 3 , 10 10 Follow-Up PAIS and PAVS are aggressive sarcomas requiring postoperative metastatic assessment. Follow-up should include medical history, physical examination, and CT imaging every 3 months for 2 years, biannually for the subsequent 3 years, and annually thereafter. PET imaging may assist in evaluating treatment response. 7 Conclusions Cardiac tumors, especially primary IS, present diagnostic and therapeutic challenges owing to their rarity, aggressiveness, and poor prognosis. Despite imaging advances, diagnosis relies on histopathology, and surgery remains the mainstay of treatment. Recurrence is common despite resection, and adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy may prolong survival. Regular imaging is essential for detection of early metastases. Further research is needed for better treatment strategies.
