Introduction Lung cancer has been the most common cause of cancer deaths in the past few decades worldwide. In the differentiation of the histopathological types, two basic markers are currently used, which are napsin A and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). Aim To assess the sensitivity of TTF-1, napsin A and combined use of both markers in detecting primary lung adenocarcinoma. The second aim was to examine the role of TTF-1 and napsin A both alone and in combination as prognostic markers. Material and methods In the course of the study, patients’ data were collected and histological specimens were evaluated using TTF-1 and napsin A as cancer markers. Results The sensitivities for TTF-1 and napsin A when used separately were 74.58% and 49.15% respectively. When a panel of both TTF-1 and napsin A was used the sensitivity increased to 79.17% as 38 out of 48 cases were positive for either or both of the immunohistochemical markers. The results for 1-, 3-, 4-year survival data were 87.9%, 70.7 %, 58.6%, with TTF-1 positive patients having better survival. Conclusions We have shown that both TTF-1 and napsin A are sensitive markers of primary lung adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 being more sensitive. Sensitivity increases when both markers are used in combination. Wprowadzenie W ostatnich kilku dekadach rak płuca jest najczęstszą przyczyną zgonów z powodu nowotworu na świecie. W różnicowaniu typów histopatologicznych stosuje się obecnie dwa podstawowe markery – napsynę A oraz thyroid transcription factor-1 Cel Ocena czułości TTF-1, napsyny A oraz kombinacji obu markerów w wykrywaniu pierwotnego gruczolakoraka płuc. Drugim celem było zbadanie roli TTF-1 i napsyny A odrębnie oraz w połączeniu jako markerów prognostycznych. Materiał i metody W trakcie badania zebrano dane pacjentów, a próbki histologiczne oceniono za pomocą TTF-1 i napsyny A jako markerów raka. Wyniki Czułość TTF-1 i napsyny A stosowanych odrębnie wyniosła odpowiednio 74,58% i 49,15%. Gdy zastosowano panel TTF-1 i napsyny A, czułość wzrosła do 79,17% – 38 z 48 przypadków było dodatnich dla jednego lub obu markerów immunohistochemicznych. Odsetki rocznego, 3- oraz 4-letniego przeżycia wyniosły w tej grupie odpowiednio 87,9%, 70,7%, 58,6%, a pacjenci dodatni pod względem TTF-1 mieli lepsze przeżycie. Wnioski Zarówno TTF-1, jak i napsyna A są wrażliwymi markerami pierwotnego gruczolakoraka płuc, przy czym TTF-1 jest bardziej wrażliwy. Czułość wzrasta, gdy stosowana jest kombinacja obu makerów.

In recent years it was diagnosed in about 16 000 men and about 6000 women a year. Out of all malignant neoplasms, lung cancer is the cause of the highest number of deaths among men and women [ 1 2 About 95% of all lung cancers are of 4 histopathological types: adenocarcinoma (about 40% – the most common type in the non-smoker group), squamous cell carcinoma (about 30%), small cell carcinoma (about 15%) and large cell carcinoma (about 10%). Epidemiological data show that the proportion of glandular cancer is steadily increasing [ 1 Early detection and accurate diagnosis of the histopathological type of lung cancer plays a crucial role in the therapeutic process. In the differential diagnosis, two immunohistochemical markers are currently employed – napsin A and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). Napsin A, a novel aspartic proteinase of the pepsin family A, was first described in 1998 by Tatnell et al. 3 4 3 5 7 Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), also known as thyroid-specific enhancer-binding protein, is physiologically expressed in thyroid, brain and lung tissue, where it regulates the expression of surfactant A, B, C and Clara cell proteins. Similarly to napsin A, TTF-1 is also commonly employed in lung cancer differentiation [ 3 8 9 Both TTF-1 and napsin A are extremely useful tools in distinguishing primary and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Although a considerable amount of literature, including two meta-analyses by Qian et al et al. 9 10 Aim In this study, we aimed to assess: (1) the sensitivity of TTF-1, napsin A and combined use of both markers in detecting primary lung adenocarcinoma; and (2) the role of TTF-1 and napsin A both alone and in combination as prognostic markers in primary lung adenocarcinoma patients. Material and methods Selection criteria, initial examinations, and follow-up From January 2012 to December 2012, 318 patients were operated on for lung cancer (mostly lung adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma). The decision of surgery was made on the basis of diagnostic imaging (CT scan, PET-CT scan), endoscopy (bronchofiberoscopy, autofluorescence bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy) and other examinations as needed (“blind” transbronchial biopsy, transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy). The cardiopulmonary system was evaluated using spirometry, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), capillary blood gas screening and electrocardiography (ECG). In some patients, a 6-minute walk test, stair climb test and additional cardiovascular examinations (exercise test, Holter monitoring, coronary angiography) were also performed. Doubtful cases were finally decided on the basis of the predicted post-operative value of the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (ppoFEV 1 After the surgery, the patients were consulted by an oncologist and depending on the staging of the tumor, according to the 7 th 11 Of the initial cohort of 318 patients who were operated on, 59 were included in the study based on the following eligibility criteria: (1) histologically confirmed diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma or its subtype/variant: lepidic, acinar, papillary, micropapillary, solid predominant with mucin production, mucinous, colloid, fetal or enteric; (2) immunohistochemically stained for TTF-1. Patients’ follow-up was based on the clinical data collected in the Thoracic Surgery Ward of Poznan University of Medical Sciences (data regarding surgery and control visits) and the Polish Group of Lung Cancer databases. The patients were followed up until 14 th Prior to commencing the study, ethical clearance was sought from Poznan University of Medical Sciences Bioethics Commission. Immunohistochemical reaction for TTF-1 The immunohistochemical reactions for TTF-1 were performed as part of routine diagnostics between January 2012 and December 2012. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues were cut into 4 μm sections which were then placed on FLEX IHC Microscope Slides (Dako, Agilent). The immunohistochemical reaction was carried out on the Autostainer Link 48 instrument (Dako, Agilent). Following epitope retrieval through the use of EnVision FLEX Targer Retrieval Solution, High pH (Dako, Agilent) for 20 minutes, the slides were incubated with a monoclonal mouse antibody against TTF-1 (clone SPT24, 1 : 200, Leica, Novocastra) for 30 minutes. EnVision FLEX+ Mouse Linker (Dako, Agilent) was used to enhance the quality of the reaction. The reaction was finally detected using EnVision FLEX Kit, High pH (Dako, Agilent). The slides were assessed by a specialist in clinical pathology (Katarzyna Iwanik – K.I., MD, Ph.D.). The presence of a brown colored reaction in the nuclei of cancer cells was considered positive. Lack thereof was interpreted as a negative immunohistochemical reaction. Immunohistochemical reaction for napsin A Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was cut into 4 μm sections, which were then placed on SuperFrost Plus Adhesion Slides (Thermo Scientific). The slides were pretreated with Cell Conditioning Solution 1 (CC1, Ventana) for 30 minutes and subsequently incubated for 16 minutes with a monoclonal mouse antibody against napsin A (MRQ-20 clone, Ventana) on the BechmarkXT instrument (Roche). The immunohistochemical reaction was finally detected using an ultraView Universal DAB Detection Kit (Ventana). The slides were evaluated by a specialist in clinical pathology (K.I.). A brown colored reaction in the cytoplasm of cancer cells was considered positive. Lack thereof was interpreted as a negative immunohistochemical reaction. Statistical analysis Data management was performed in Open Office Calc 4.1.3. Descriptive statistics were carried out in Statistica v. 12 (StatSoft, Inc. (2014). Statistica (data analysis software system, version 12. www.statsoft.com p Results Clinical data The analyzed groups did not differ significantly in age or sex. The clinical data are presented in Tables I II Table I Clinical characteristics of patients included in the study Variable Number of patients Gender: Male 38 (64.41%) Female 21 (35.59%) Age: Mean 62.42 Median 63.00 Range 34–75 Surgical approach: video-assisted thoracoscopy 40 (18.64%) thoracotomy 11 (67.80%) not applicable 8 (13.56%) Resection type: Right pneumonectomy 3 (5.08%) Left pneumonectomy 2 (3.39%) Right upper lobectomy 18 (30.51%) Right middle lobectomy 1 (1.69%) Right lower lobectomy 2 (3.39%) Left upper lobectomy 9 (15.25%) Left lower lobectomy 12 (20.34%) Upper bilobectomy 1 (1.69%) Lower bilobectomy 1 (1.69%) Not applicable 8 (13.56%) Table II T, N, M categories and stage Variable Number of patients T: Tx 0 (0.00%) T0 0 (0.00%) Tis 0 (0.00%) T1a 4 (6.78%) T1b 4 (6.78%) T2a 20 (33.90%) T2b 13 (22.03%) T3 6 (10.17%) T4 4 (6.78%) not applicable 8 (13.56%) N: Nx 0 (0.00%) N0 29 (49.15%) N1 13 (22.03%) N2 9 (15.25%) N3 0 (0.00%) not applicable 8 (13.56%) M: M0 49 (83.05%) M1a 1 (1.69%) M1b 1 (1.69%) not applicable 8 (13.56%) Stage: Occult carcinoma 0 (0.00%) 0 0 (0.00%) IA 6 (10.17%) IB 10 (16.95%) IIA 14 (23.73%) IIB 7 (11.86%) IIIA 11 (18.64%) IIIB 1 (1.69%) IV 2 (3.39%) Not applicable 8 (13.56%) The percentage of post-operative complications was 20.3%. The most frequent postoperative complication was atrial fibrillation (10.3%). The possible pre-operative occurrence of this complication was excluded by performing ECG before the surgery. The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.69% and there were no intraoperative deaths. The post-operative period ranged from 4 to 22 days with a mean of 8 days. Sensitivity of TTF-1 and napsin A in primary adenocarcinoma of the lung Immunohistochemical expression of TTF-1 was evaluated in all of the 59 cases included in the study. Of those, 44 (74.58%) showed a brown colored reaction in the nucleus of cancer cells and were therefore considered positive, while lack thereof was noted in 15 (25.42%) cases. However, only 48 cases were assessed for napsin A as in 11 cases the appropriate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were either lacking or they did not contain enough stainable tissue for evaluation of this particular marker. Of the available cases, 29 (49.15%) were positive for napsin A and 19 (32.20%) were negative. Hence the sensitivities for TTF-1 and napsin A, when used separately, were 74.58% and 49.15% respectively. With a panel of both TTF-1 and napsin A the sensitivity increased to 79.17% as 38 out of 48 cases were positive for either or both of the immunohistochemical markers. As shown in Table III Table IV Table III Number of patients expressing TTF-1, napsin A or both Parameter Napsin A (–-) Napsin A (+) Total TTF-1 (–) 10 (20.83%) 3 (6.25%) 13 (27.08%) TTF-1 (+) 9 (18.75%) 26 (54.17%) 35 (72.92%) Total 19 (39.58%) 29 (60.42%) 48 (100.00%) Table IV Number of patients expressing either TTF-1, napsin A or both along with the sensitivity of a panel of both markers Parameter Number of cases (percentage out of total number of cases) TTF-1 (–) Napsin A (+) 3 (6.25%) TTF-1 (+) Napsin A (–) 9 (18.75%) TTF-1 (+) Napsin A (+) 26 (54.17%) Total 38 (79.17%) Survival analysis According to the aforementioned methodology, the 1-, 3- and 4- year survival rates were determined. The results for 1-, 3-, 4- year survival data were 87.9%, 70.7 %, 58.6% respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed for TTF-1, napsin A and for a panel of both TTF-1 and napsin A. There was a statistically significant difference ( p Figure 1 p Figure 2 p 1 2 3 Figure 3 Figure 1 Kaplan-Meier survival curve for TTF-1 positive (green line) and TTF-1 negative (blue line) patients Figure 2 Kaplan-Meier survival curve for napsin A positive (green line) and napsin A negative (blue line) patients Figure 3 Kaplan-Meier survival curves for TTF-1 and napsin A positive patients (blue line), TTF-1 and napsin A negative patients (orange line), and patients positive for either TTF-1 or napsin A (green line) Discussion TTF-1 and napsin A are commonly employed antibodies in immunohistochemical differentiation between primary and metastatic lung cancers. In one of the largest studies to date of 1674 cases of lung adenocarcinoma, by Bradley et al. 6 et al. 12 et al. 12 To date, two meta-analyses have been performed to analyse the prognostic value of TTF-1 in non-small cell lung cancer. The first one, by Berghmans et al. 10 In 2015, another meta-analysis, by Qian et al. 9 In the context of the aforementioned papers, our study also showed a statistically significant difference in survival between TTF-1 positive and TTF-1 negative patients ( p et al. 13 Although the prognostic role of TTF-1 has been studied quite extensively, we have been able to identify only three papers, by Lee et al. et al. et al. 14 16 Similarly to napsin A, there remains a paucity of evidence on the prognostic role of the combined use of both markers – TTF-1 and napsin A. We have been able to identify only one study that analysed the association between combined TTF-1 and napsin A expression and the overall survival. In the study, published in 2015, Ma et al. 15 et al. p Conclusions We have demonstrated that both TTF-1 and napsin A are sensitive markers of primary lung adenocarcinoma with TTF-1 being more sensitive and with the sensitivity increasing when both markers are used in combination. What is more, our study supports the already gathered evidence on the positive prognostic role of TTF-1 in lung adenocarcinoma. However, more studies are needed to elucidate the role of napsin A alone and in combination with TTF-1 as a prognostic marker.
