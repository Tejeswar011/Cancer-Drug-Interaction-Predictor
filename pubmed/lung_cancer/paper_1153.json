In their core design, a tumor-targeting antibody is covalently linked to a cytotoxic payload via a chemical linker, enabling the selective delivery of highly potent agents to malignant cells while sparing normal tissues, thereby improving the therapeutic index. Humanized and fully human immunoglobulin G1(IgG1) antibodies are the most common ADC backbones due to their stability in systemic circulation, robust Fcγ receptor engagement for immune effector functions, and reduced immunogenicity. Antibody selection requires balancing tumor specificity, internalization rate, and binding affinity to avoid barriers to tissue penetration, such as the binding-site barrier effect, while emerging designs exploit tumor-specific antigen variants or unique post-translational modifications to further enhance selectivity. Advances in antibody engineering, linker chemistry, and payload innovation have reinforced the clinical success of ADCs, with more than a dozen agents FDA approved for hematologic malignancies and solid tumors and over 200 in active clinical trials. This review critically examines established and emerging conjugation strategies, including lysine- and cysteine-based chemistries, enzymatic tagging, glycan remodeling, non-canonical amino acid incorporation, and affinity peptide-mediated methods, and discusses how conjugation site, drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) control, and linker stability influence pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety. Innovations in site-specific conjugation have improved ADC homogeneity, stability, and clinical predictability, though challenges in large-scale manufacturing and regulatory harmonization remain. Furthermore, novel ADC architectures such as bispecific ADCs, conditionally active (probody) ADCs, immune-stimulating ADCs, protein-degrader ADCs, and dual-payload designs are being developed to address tumor heterogeneity, drug resistance, and off-target toxicity.

Introduction The concept of targeted cancer therapy has undergone a remarkable evolution over the past century with the development of antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs). Targeted therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by shifting the paradigm from non-specific cytotoxic agents to precision-guided interventions that exploit molecular vulnerabilities unique to the cancer cells [ 1 2 2 3 4 5 5 6 6 7 A typical ADC consists of three essential components: a mAb that selectively targets a tumor antigen; a potent cytotoxic payload; and a chemical linker that connects the two, which governs the pharmacokinetics and stability of the conjugate [ 8 8 9 9 50 10 11 Consistent with these observations, several U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ADCs exhibit sub-nanomolar to picomolar cytotoxic potency, reflecting the highly selective and effective nature of their payloads ( Table 1 50 50 12 13 DM1 and MMAE are two of the most commonly used cytotoxic payloads in FDA-approved ADCs, both acting as microtubule inhibitors that induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis [ 14 The linker has a critical role in ensuring payload release is selective within the tumor environment. Both cleavable and non-cleavable linkers can be used; cleavable linkers respond to conditions such as low pH or protease activity within lysosomes, while non-cleavable linkers rely on complete lysosomal degradation of the antibody [ 15 16 Mechanistically, ADCs leverage mAb to deliver potent cytotoxic agents directly to cancer cells ( Figure 1 17 18 18 19 19 15 15 15 2. Historical Development and ADC Overview For nearly a century, cancer treatment has predominantly relied on systemic chemotherapy, employing cytotoxic agents that inhibit cell division and induce cell death. While these agents have improved survival rates, their lack of specificity often causes significant side effects by targeting not only cancer cells but also rapidly dividing healthy tissues [ 20 21 22 20 23 24 The first human clinical trial of an ADC was initiated in 1983 with BR96-doxorubicin, targeting the Lewis Y (Ley) antigen, which confirmed the feasibility of mAb-mediated targeted delivery but also highlighted the challenges of linker stability, tumor penetration, and off-target toxicity [ 25 ® 22 24 9 24 9 9 Therapeutic mAbs have progressed from murine to chimeric, humanized, and fully human forms, which reduces immunogenicity and improves efficacy. The murine mAbs are limited by high immune responses and short half-lives, while chimeric mAbs, combining human constant regions with murine variable regions, partially addressed these issues but still elicited immune reactions. The fully humanized mAbs further minimized murine sequences to complementarity-determining regions, and fully human mAbs now offer optimal tolerability and therapeutic performance [ 20 Most ADCs in clinical use or development incorporate humanized or fully human mAbs, as these provide high target specificity, long serum half-lives, and minimal immunogenicity. Exceptions, such as brentuximab vedotin, utilize chimeric antibodies, although less common [ 20 25 25 20 21 21 To produce fully human mAbs, modern techniques such as phage display and transgenic mouse technologies are employed. These approaches involved engineering mice to generate human antibodies instead of murine ones, thereby reducing immunogenicity and enhancing clinical efficacy [ 21 25 25 25 21 25 ADCs’ development hinges on the careful selection of an appropriate target antigen, as this choice is crucial to their therapeutic effectiveness. An ideal target antigen should exhibit tumor-specific expression, uniform distribution, high expression levels, efficient internalization, and minimal ectodomain shedding [ 25 23 9 Natural products have played a pivotal role in advancing ADC technology, with auristatins and their derivatives (e.g., MMAE) standing out as key examples. Derived from marine cytotoxins, auristatins enhance the pharmacokinetics of ADCs and prolong their half-lives. Originally derived from marine cytotoxins, auristatins serve as potent tubulin inhibitors that disrupt microtubule dynamics, induce cell cycle arrest, and hence enhance ADC efficacy. The cytotoxic payloads employed in ADCs generally fall into three major classes [ 25 ® ® 25 ® ® 25 ® 25 In solid tumors, ADC effectiveness typically increases with antigen density, but those with cleavable linkers and membrane-permeable payloads, or non-internalizing ADCs activated externally, can remain effective even when antigen internalization is limited [ 9 25 25 24 By integrating these highly potent cytotoxic agents with advanced targeting mechanisms, ongoing research is addressing current limitations to position ADCs as a cornerstone of cancer therapy [ 25 9 9 Despite their promise, ADCs continue to face notable challenges, including dose-limiting toxicities and off-target effects. The selection of linker technology and payload remain critical to optimizing the therapeutic index. Advances in conjugation methods and antigen identification have driven the development of safer and more effective ADCs. Innovative conjugation techniques aim to enhance payload stability and homogeneity of attachment, thereby improving therapeutic outcomes [ 24 21 24 3. Chemical Aspects of ADCs The development of ADCs is more complex and challenging compared to nonconjugated mAbs; the components of the selected antibody for ADC generation, as well as the structure and design of the ADCs, influence their function and therapeutic efficacy [ 26 3.1. Antibody–Drug Conjugate (ADC) Engineering Similar to non-conjugated mAbs that are currently used for therapeutic purposes, the IgG1 isotype is commonly used to initiate ADC-dependent ADCC [ 26 26 27 26 10 28 3.2. Linker Technology Central to the therapeutic efficacy and safety of ADCs is the design of linker chemistry, which controls both systemic stability and the selective release of intracellular payload [ 15 28 29 30 31 32 32 Enzyme-cleavable linkers, such as the widely used valine-citrulline (Val-Cit) linker in brentuximab vedotin and polatuzumab vedotin, exploit tumor-associated proteases like cathepsin B. These linkers are cleaved in lysosomes to release MMAE, often aided by self-destructible spacers, such as para-aminobenzyl carbamate (PABC) [ 32 32 33 33 33 Functionalizing amines in linkers is important for site-specific conjugation and controlled drug release. N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters coupled with ε-lysine residues introduced into an antibody scaffold are commonly used in ADC development [ 34 34 33 29 35 There are two main types of linkers commonly used for ADC development: cleavable and non-cleavable linkers. Each type has different impacts on pharmacokinetic properties, selectivity, and therapeutic index as well as the success of the ADCs [ 36 37 ® 37 38 37 38 Thus, ADCs designed with non-cleavable linkers might be limited to tumors expressing high tumor antigens or for treating hematological cancers [ 37 38 38 Cleavable linkers are designed to release the payload selectively within the tumor microenvironment by responding to specific conditions such as acidic pH, enzymatic activity, or intracellular thiols. Examples include disulfide linkers, which are cleaved through thiol exchange; hydrazone linkers, which degrade in acidic environments; and peptide linkers, which are hydrolyzed by lysosomal proteases such as cathepsin B. While cleavable linkers enhance specificity and payload delivery to tumor cells, they pose the risk of premature cleavage in the bloodstream [ 23 25 In contrast, non-cleavable linkers release their payload only after the complete degradation of the mAb within lysosomes. This mechanism offers advantages such as increased plasma stability, reduced off-target toxicity, and improved pharmacokinetics. Maleimide-based linkers are a prominent example, as they minimize premature drug release and extend ADC half-life in circulation [ 25 The efficacy of ADCs is also influenced by factors such as the DAR and payload homogeneity. An optimal DAR is essential for maximizing therapeutic potency while minimizing systemic toxicity. Achieving uniformity in payload attachment ensures consistent therapeutic outcomes. Variability in conjugation can result in unpredictable pharmacological behavior, making precise and homogeneous attachment critical for ADC effectiveness [ 21 Recent advances in linker technologies have introduced innovative strategies to address existing limitations. Site-specific linkers improve payload homogeneity by targeting defined attachment sites on antibodies, ensuring controlled and uniform conjugation. Tripeptide linkers enhance plasma stability and provide selective payload release within tumor cells. Additionally, hydrophilic linkers reduce ADC aggregation and improve solubility, thereby enhancing pharmacokinetics and therapeutic efficacy. Another significant innovation is the use of bioorthogonal linkers, which enable highly controlled drug release without interfering with normal cellular processes, representing a transformative step forward in ADC linker design [ 9 Linkers play a critical role in optimizing ADC performance by influencing stability, selectivity, and the therapeutic index of the drug. Ongoing research into novel linker classes aims to address current challenges in toxicity, stability, and therapeutic consistency, with a focus on improving specificity and targeted drug delivery. These advancements are crucial for establishing ADCs as a cornerstone of targeted cancer therapies, providing enhanced clinical outcomes while mitigating the risks associated with off-target effects [ 23 25 Despite the type of linker used to treat a specific disease, the linker’s location on the antibody should be highly considered, since it could significantly affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the ADC and thus influence the treatment efficacy of the designed ADCs [ 28 39 10 4. Conjugation Methods ADC strategies can be broadly categorized into two main types: traditional (non-site-specific) conjugation and site-specific conjugation [ 5 5 40 40 In many cases, the antibody or payload is first modified with thiol- or cathepsin-cleavable linkers such as valine-citrulline, which subsequently conjugate with the available lysine residues, resulting in a variable and less controlled ADC product [ 41 40 41 4.1. Traditional Conjugation (Lysine-Based Conjugation) Lysine-based conjugation is a widely used method for synthesizing ADCs, leveraging the nucleophilic ε-amino (–NH 2 42 43 42 16 44 45 46 Under mild reaction conditions, when lysine conjugation is delayed or inefficient, less reactive linkers may also engage with thiol groups of cysteine residues [ 44 45 44 45 47 47 48 Variations in reaction conditions during lysine-based conjugation can also lead to heterogeneous DARs, which are associated with increased systemic toxicity and accelerated clearance. A prominent example is Mylotarg ® 49 50 51 ® ® ® 51 49 50 42 Additionally, the K-lock™ platform enables site-specific modification at the K188 residue of the κ light chain using pentafluorophenol (PFP) esters, providing improved control over conjugation site and drug loading. These strategies contribute to greater homogeneity, batch-to-batch reproducibility, and optimized pharmacokinetic profiles in ADC manufacturing [ 49 50 52 53 2 34 Figure 2 4.2. Site-Specific Conjugation (Click Reactions) Enzymatic conjugation is a sophisticated technique that utilizes enzymes to covalently attach payloads to antibodies at specific amino acid sequences, yielding highly homogeneous ADCs with defined conjugation sites [ 54 55 56 55 56 55 56 The FGE technology specifically recognizes CXPXR motifs. It catalyzes the oxidation of the cysteine residue within this sequence to formylglycine, introducing a unique aldehyde functional group that enables site-specific bioconjugation [ 56 56 57 56 Several enzyme-based conjugation systems are currently under investigation for ADC development in preclinical studies. These include peptide asparaginyl ligases, tubulin-tyrosine ligases, trypsiligase, phosphopantetheinyl transferases, SpyLigase, and O 6 58 59 58 59 58 Click chemistry offers numerous advantages for ADC synthesis, including mild reaction conditions, high yields, compatibility with aqueous and organic solvents, stereoselectivity, and straightforward product isolation, making it highly suitable for bioconjugation applications [ 60 61 62 63 63 64 63 64 In ADC development, click chemistry reactions such as CuAAC, oxime formation, and the Diels–Alder reaction offer versatile, bioorthogonal, and efficient strategies for stable and site-specific bioconjugation, as detailed in the following sections. 4.2.1. Copper-Catalyzed Cycloaddition of Azides and Alkynes The first reaction formally recognized as a “click” reaction was the (3+2) cycloaddition, specifically the CuAAC, which enabled the efficient and regioselective synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoles, which have since become a foundational transformation in organic synthesis and bioconjugation chemistry [ 63 65 61 65 In the reaction, the copper (I) ions catalyze the selective transformation of alkynes with azides or other 1,3-dipolar compounds to form stable triazole linkages, a process characterized by high regioselectivity and reaction rates comparable to those observed in cysteine–maleimide conjugation [ 61 64 66 67 68 63 69 70 4.2.2. Oxime Formation The term “oxime” was first introduced by Meyer and Janny in 1882, describing a functional group formed through the proton-catalyzed nucleophilic attack of a hydroxylamine nitrogen on an electrophilic carbonyl carbon, resulting in the formation of a stable C=N–OH oxime bond [ 35 35 71 72 Aniline was initially introduced as a catalyst for oxime ligation due to its good solubility and nucleophilic inertness under physiological conditions [ 73 74 73 75 Compounds such as anthranilic acids, aminobenzoic acids, 2-aminophenols, and 2-(aminomethyl)-benzimidazoles have been investigated as alternative catalysts for oxime ligation [ 73 76 76 77 p p 78 79 4.2.3. Diels–Alder Reaction (DA) The Diels–Alder (DA) reaction, first described by Otto Diels and Kurt Alder in 1928, is a (4+2) cycloaddition reaction between a conjugated diene and a dienophile, forming a six-membered ring. This reaction offers numerous advantages, including high regio- and stereoselectivity, mild reaction conditions, tolerance to a wide range of functional groups, and the ability to proceed without the need for catalysts, making it a valuable tool in synthetic chemistry, materials science, and bioconjugation [ 80 81 82 81 82 Owing to its inherent stereoselectivity, high yields, ease of purification, and minimal generation of toxic by-products, the DA reaction aligns with the principles of click chemistry, making it a desirable strategy for bioconjugation [ 83 84 84 85 85 85 84 In addition to strategies that modify naturally occurring residues, click chemistry can be integrated with genetically encoded unnatural amino acids (uAAs) to achieve precise and site-specific payload attachment [ 86 p 86 87 88 87 88 Figure 3 Table 2 5. Tailoring ADCs to Specific Diseases 5.1. Tailoring ADCs to Cancer Numerous ADCs have been developed for both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Among them, those targeting HER2 in metastatic breast cancer are the most widely used [ 16 89 In hematological cancers, there is one ADC for AML and five others for B-cell malignancies [ 90 91 2 89 92 Notably, Brentuximab Vedotin, an ADC targeting CD30, has become a key treatment for Stage III and IV Hodgkin’s lymphoma [ 93 94 94 95 2 89 In solid tumors, HER2-positive breast cancer remains the most common target of ADCs, followed by other HER2-expressing tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and urothelial carcinoma [ 96 96 97 98 2 89 HER2 is frequently overexpressed in multiple cancers (including breast cancer) and is associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of metastasis. Its extracellular domain (ECD) is accessible on the cell surface, making it a prime target for antibody-based therapies [ 99 99 Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-Dxd) is a next-generation ADC composed of Trastuzumab linked to a topoisomerase I inhibitor via a cleavable peptide linker. It has been approved for HER2-positive metastatic breast and gastric cancers. DHES0815A is an investigational HER2-targeting ADC comprising a humanized HER2 antibody (HER2-THIOMAB) that binds subdomain I of the HER2 ECD [ 100 100 2 101 Trastuzumab Emtansine (Kadcyla, T-DM1) is another HER2-targeted ADC in a Phase III trial involving patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer and residual invasive disease following neoadjuvant systemic therapy. T-DM1 significantly improved outcomes compared to Trastuzumab alone. After a median follow-up of 8.4 years, the seven-year invasive disease-free survival rate was 80.8%, and overall survival reached 89.1%. These findings highlight the capacity of T-DM1 to reduce mortality in this high-risk population [ 102 5.2. Tailoring ADCs for Non-Cancer Diseases While ADCs have demonstrated significant success in oncology, their application is increasingly expanding into non-oncologic diseases, broadening the potential of targeted drug delivery systems [ 85 85 Mycobacterium tuberculosis 103 104 Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus 105 In autoimmune diseases, ADCs are also being developed to selectively deplete pathogenic immune cell subsets using cytotoxic or immunosuppressive payloads [ 106 106 107 Regarding the use of ADCs in infectious diseases, several challenges arise in designing an effective ADC therapy. The first challenge is selecting the target due to the pathogen’s specificity. Unlike ADCs used for cancer therapy, which target tumor-associated antigens, ADCs used for infectious diseases must be designed to identify antigens on the surface of bacteria or viruses that can be easily accessed [ 105 108 S. aureus 108 Additionally, other criteria should be considered for the antigen, such as its high degree of conservation across strains, which reduces the potential for resistance emergence; it should be easily accessible during active infection; and it should be absent or minimally expressed on host tissues [ 108 109 110 110 S. aureus 110 The second challenge is selecting the appropriate antimicrobial payload. ADCs require specific payload criteria for successful therapeutic applications, including retaining bactericidal activity at low concentrations, possessing suitable functional groups for conjugation, maintaining stability under physiological conditions, and overcoming bacterial resistance mechanisms [ 105 108 Pseudomonas aeruginosa P. aeruginosa 111 112 111 112 One of the challenges that ADCs face is the need for specialized linker technologies with specific properties. These properties are the ability to release the drug in bacterial environments rather than mammalian cells, resistance to degradation by bacterial enzymes, and ability to maintain stability in infected tissues [ 105 108 113 6. Advances in Delivery Systems 6.1. Nanoparticle-Based Delivery Antibody-functionalized nanoparticles have gained traction as a complementary or alternative strategy to ADCs, offering targeted delivery across diverse disease areas by combining antibody specificity with nanocarrier versatility [ 114 115 116 Among nanocarriers, liposomes are the most clinically advanced. Doxil ® 117 118 119 120 121 122 Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), notably used in the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccines, have demonstrated exceptional transfection efficiency, biodegradability, and endosomal escape capabilities, facilitating robust gene expression [ 123 124 125 126 + 127 128 129 Similarly, polymeric nanoparticles (e.g., PLGA, PLA) provide sustained drug release, tunable surface modification, and excellent biocompatibility. Antibody-conjugated variants, such as trastuzumab-functionalized paclitaxel nanoparticles, have demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity in HER2-positive cancers. Others targeting CEA or ICAM-1 have been explored for colorectal tumors and gastrointestinal inflammation, showing improved tissue specificity and retention [ 130 131 132 133 Protein-based nanoparticles, including albumin and gelatin formulations, further enhance delivery through their natural biodegradability and capacity for precise antibody conjugation. Bevacizumab-coated albumin nanoparticles have shown 50% higher paclitaxel delivery in gynecologic cancers, while gelatin-based nanoparticles functionalized with anti-CD3 selectively internalized into T lymphocytes, indicating their utility in immune modulation [ 134 135 Gold and metal oxide nanoparticles combine optical/magnetic properties with antibody-guided specificity for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes. Anti-HER2 conjugated gold nanostructures enable photothermal tumor ablation, while iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated with anti-VEGF or CD105 antibodies support MRI-guided therapy and targeted cytotoxicity in HER2-positive cancers [ 136 137 138 139 140 Although antibody-functionalized nanoparticles are structurally distinct from ADCs and utilize different drug delivery mechanisms, their modularity, multivalency, and capacity to carry a range of therapeutic cargos—including nucleic acids, small molecules, and proteins—make them promising alternatives in targeted therapy, especially where conventional ADCs may face biological or pharmacological limitations. Table 3 6.2. Bioconjugation Techniques The clinical success of next-generation ADCs depends heavily on bioconjugation strategies that ensure stability, precise drug loading, and controlled payload release. Modern approaches focus on three main goals: improving serum stability, minimizing off-target toxicity, and tailoring the therapeutic index through precision engineering. 6.2.1. ADC Stability Conventional lysine- and cysteine-based conjugation approaches, while historically favored for their synthetic simplicity and scalability, often generate heterogeneous ADC populations with broad DAR distributions and multiple, non-uniform conjugation sites. Antibodies typically contain ~80–90 solvent-accessible lysine residues and eight interchain cysteine residues, many of which are chemically reactive under conjugation conditions, leading to stochastic payload attachment and DAR species ranging from 0 to 8 [ 153 154 153 154 9 41 9 41 6.2.2. Precision Conjugation Strategies While the major linker classes have been described previously, recent developments build on these foundations by integrating tumor-selective triggers and modular designs. Examples include legumain-cleavable linkers (Vincerx Pharma) that remain stable in circulation but release payloads in tumor lysosomes and linkers incorporating cell-trapping moieties to limit payload diffusion and enhance intratumoral retention. Such refinements allow for fine-tuning of the bystander effect, biodistribution, and DAR [ 10 26 27 155 156 Building upon this premise, Vincerx Pharma has created an advanced modular ADC platform that incorporates customizable linkers, innovative payloads, and targeting components. An essential innovation is their legumain-cleavable linker, which maintains stability in circulation yet is specifically cleaved in tumor lysosomes, where legumain is overexpressed. This specificity reduces systemic toxicity and improves tumor selectivity. Moreover, Vincerx’s payload, a kinesin spindle protein inhibitor (KSPi), demonstrates significant efficacy in proliferating tumor cells while preserving healthy, non-proliferating tissues [ 157 157 6.2.3. Minimizing Off-Target Effects Beyond stable linkers, off-target mitigation strategies include engineering payloads with reduced membrane permeability, selecting antibodies with higher tumor selectivity, and modifying Fc regions to decrease hepatic uptake. Conditional activation technologies, such as Probody ADCs with protease-cleavable masks, restrict ADC activity to the tumor microenvironment, further widening the therapeutic window [ 158 159 26 160 161 162 6.2.4. Outlook for Next-Generation ADCs The integration of site-specific conjugation strategies enabling precise DAR control, tumor-selective linker systems responsive to proteases (e.g., cathepsin B, legumain) or acidic pH, payloads with optimized physicochemical properties to modulate membrane permeability and hydrophilicity, and conditional activation platforms such as protease-activated probody ADCs is driving the development of next-generation ADCs with improved plasma stability, reduced off-target cytotoxicity, and enhanced intratumoral drug release [ 27 163 31 164 165 7. Challenges and Future Directions While ADCs have achieved significant success in cancer treatment, their broader use is still hindered by several key challenges. One of the primary concerns is off-target toxicity, which occurs when ADCs bind to low levels of target antigens present on healthy cells [ 11 166 Another primary concern is tumor heterogeneity, where differences in antigen expression within the tumor or among metastatic sites can lead to irregular ADC distribution and decreased effectiveness [ 30 167 The manufacturing of ADCs also presents significant challenges. Their production involves complex and tightly controlled procedures to ensure consistent DAR, stability, and biological function [ 85 168 To address the current limitations of ADCs, researchers are pursuing a variety of advanced strategies that highlight the evolving landscape of ADC technology. A notable innovation is the use of site-specific conjugation methods, which enable the attachment of cytotoxic drugs to specific sites on the antibody. Techniques such as enzymatic ligation (e.g., using sortase or transglutaminase), click chemistry, and the incorporation of non-natural amino acids are being employed to create highly uniform ADCs with defined DARs, enhanced pharmacokinetics, and minimized off-target toxicity [ 169 170 Another promising direction is the development of bispecific ADCs. These molecules are designed to recognize two different tumor antigens simultaneously, which enhances targeting accuracy, promotes efficient internalization, and reduces the risk of resistance due to antigen loss or variation [ 171 172 Researchers are also working on next-generation payloads. While conventional ADCs often rely on microtubule disruptors or DNA-interacting agents, novel classes of cytotoxins, such as immune activators, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), are being explored. These innovative agents may help overcome resistance mechanisms and introduce additional therapeutic effects, such as immunogenic cell death or bystander killing [ 173 174 Moreover, advances in linker technology are enhancing the precision of drug release. Linkers that respond to specific tumor conditions, such as acidic pH, high levels of glutathione, or certain tumor-associated enzymes, are being designed to release the payload only within the tumor environment, thereby limiting systemic toxicity [ 15 Due to the complex nature of cancer biology and the diverse mechanisms driving drug resistance, combination therapies that include ADCs are becoming increasingly prominent in both laboratory and clinical research. An auspicious approach involves pairing ADCs with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. The cytotoxic effect of ADCs can lead to tumor cell death, which in turn enhances antigen presentation and stimulates immune activation, potentially transforming immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot” ones that are more responsive to immunotherapy [ 175 Another path under exploration is the combination of ADCs with targeted agents, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). These combinations may increase the susceptibility of cancer cells to ADCs by interfering with signaling pathways that regulate cell survival, proliferation, or resistance. For example, inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway may potentiate the pro-apoptotic effects of ADC payloads [ 176 In the context of blood cancers, integrating ADCs into chemo-immunotherapy regimens has produced synergistic effects, resulting in improved response rates and more robust remissions. Furthermore, using ADCs in combination therapies may enable lower doses of each component, reducing toxicity while maintaining therapeutic impact [ 177 8. Conclusions Currently, ADCs represent a significant advancement in targeted therapeutics, combining the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the potency of cytotoxic payloads to achieve selective tumor cell killing while minimizing systemic toxicity. Innovations in antibody engineering, linker chemistry, and site-specific conjugation have significantly enhanced the stability, efficacy, and safety of ADCs, leading to their approval in various malignancies and the development of hundreds more in clinical trials. Beyond oncology, ADCs are being explored in infectious and autoimmune diseases, demonstrating their versatility and potential for modular design. Despite challenges such as antigen heterogeneity, resistance, and manufacturing complexity, emerging strategies, including bispecific and dual-payload ADCs, immune-stimulating conjugates, and nanoparticle integration, are addressing current limitations and expanding therapeutic applications. As technological and translational advances continue, ADCs are sure to become a cornerstone of precision medicine across diverse diseases.
