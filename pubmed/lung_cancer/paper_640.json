This label-free platform enables detailed\nanalysis of amplification kinetics and structural transitions over\ntime. Changes in translocation dwell time and current blockage were\nevaluated across RCA incubation periods (30 min, 1 h, 2 h), revealing\ntime-dependent increases consistent with the generation of longer\nand more complex DNA concatemers. These findings were validated by\nUrea-PAGE and atomic force microscopy (AFM), while Mfold-based secondary\nstructure predictions further supported the evolution of more stable\nand folded configurations. Additionally, a custom-developed signal\nextraction application facilitated reproducible event classification\nand visualization. Overall, this integrated approach provides new\ninsights into RCA behavior and highlights the potential of nanopore-based\nsensing for the development of sensitive, structure-resolved diagnostic\ntools. solid-state nanopore rolling circle amplification miR-21 single-molecule analysis isothermal\namplification nanopore sensing secondary structure AFM Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology 10.13039/100012914 NA National Science and Technology Development Agency 10.13039/501100004192 P2350026 National Science and Technology Development Agency 10.13039/501100004192 P2451814 National Nanotechnology Center 10.13039/501100007056 NA Program Management Unit for Human Resources & Institutional Development, Research, and Innovation (PMU-B) NA NA pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes document-id-old-9 se5c02039 document-id-new-14 se5c02039 production-flag-MathML-config-version 3 production-flag-journal-citation-display-style acs-titles production-flag-journal-date-display-style dates-used-rcd-rvd-acc production-flag-si-avail yes document-id-alt-64 20025c91a7a8e5ca0e4c642789de8f5d5846d30bc3ef81230b2ac5892e5e6fc8 The accurate and sensitive detection of nucleic acids underpins\nmodern molecular diagnostics, offering insights into the genetic and\nepigenetic basis of diseases ranging from infectious pathogens to\ncancers. Among emerging biomarkers, microRNAs (miRNAs) such as miR-21\nare of particular interest due to their stability in biofluids and\nkey roles in gene regulation, especially in oncogenesis.  Rolling\ncircle amplification (RCA) has emerged as a robust isothermal\namplification strategy well-suited for short nucleic acid targets\nsuch as miRNAs. It involves the circularization of a padlock probe\nfollowed by isothermal polymerization using Phi29 DNA polymerase,\nwhich exhibits high processivity (capable of synthesizing >70 kb\nproducts)\nand a polymerization rate of approximately 50–100 nucleotides\nper second under standard reaction conditions.  Conventional RCA detection approaches, such as gel\nelectrophoresis\nand fluorescence assays, provide only end point readouts and limited\nstructural insight.   In this study, we present an integrated RCAnanopore\nplatform\nfor structural and kinetic profiling of nucleic acid amplification,\nusing miR-21 as a model target ( Figure 1 Schematic overview of the rolling circle amplification\n(RCA) assay\nfor miR-21 monitored using nanopore technology.

(B) Overview of\nsolid-state nanopore analysis, depicting sample dilution, translocation\nthrough the nanopore, and ionic current signal analysis for single-molecule\ndetection. Materials and Methods Materials Linear padlock DNA probes (P21) and synthetic\nmiR-21 oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies\n(IDT). T4 RNA ligase 2 (T4 Rnl2), Phi29 DNA polymerase, and associated\nbuffers were obtained from New England Biolabs (NEB). SYBR Gold nucleic\nacid stain was sourced from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Solid-state\nsilicon nitride (SiN) membranes were provided by Norcada. Silver wires\n(1 mm, 99.9% purity), lithium chloride (LiCl), potassium chloride\n(KCl), and all other reagents were analytical grade.

RCA Reaction Ligation Reaction To generate circular\nDNA probes,\na 10 μL ligation reaction mixture (10 μL) was prepared\ncontaining 1 μL of 100 nM linear DNA probe (P21), 1 μL\nof 10 nM miR-21, 1 μL of 10X ligation buffer, 1 μL (10\nunits) of T4 Rnl2, and 6 μL of RNase-free water. A mixture of\nP21, miR-21 and water was first heated at 65 °C for 3 min, gradually\ncooled for 10 min. The T4 Rnl2 and ligation buffer were then added\nand incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. For nanopore experiments, the\nligation product was stored at −20 °C for downstream analysis. Amplification Reaction The RCA mixture (20 μL)\ncontained the ligated product (10 μL), 2 μL of 2 mg/mL\nBSA, 2 μL of 10 mM dNTPs, 2 μL of 10X reaction buffer,\n10 U of Phi29 DNA polymerase, and sterile water. Incubation was carried\nout at 37 °C for 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h, followed by enzyme inactivation\nat 65 °C for 10 min. The amplified products were then stored\nat −20 °C. Gel Electrophoresis (Urea-PAGE) To confirm ligation\nand amplification, samples were analyzed on 10% Urea-PAGE in 1X TBE\nat 200 V for 40 min. Gels were stained with SYBR Gold for 30 min and\nimaged using the In-Vivo FX PRO system. Nanopore Device Fabrication\nand Conditioning Solid-state\nnanopores were fabricated using the dielectric breakdown method Ag/AgCl electrodes (1 mm diameter) were prepared by immersing silver\nwires in 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) for at least 30 min. Electrodes\nwere then inserted into antievaporation caps and placed into each\nchamber of the flow cell. Care was taken to avoid overfilling during\nassembly to prevent electrode corrosion or flow cell damage. The assembled\nflow cell was loaded into the Spark-E2 instrument, and the standard\ndielectric breakdown protocol was initiated. The system was calibrated\nusing the known conductivities of 1 M KCl (10.6 ± 0.5 S/m) and\n3.6 M LiCl (16.5 ± 0.5 S/m), both containing 10 mM HEPES (pH\n8.0). An increasing voltage was applied across the membrane until\nthe formation of a nanoscopic defect was detected by a sharp increase\nin current, indicating successful pore formation. Following\nbreakdown, the buffer was replaced with 3.6 M LiCl (10\nmM HEPES, pH 8.0) to initiate the conditioning step, which promotes\npore expansion and stabilization. The system continued conditioning\nuntil the nanopore reached the desired diameter of approximately 8\nnm, at which point the process automatically terminated. The pore\nwas then ready for subsequent translocation experiments. This fabrication\nand conditioning protocol closely followed procedures established\nin our previous work. Nanopore Measurements Nanopore experiments were performed\nusing an Axopatch 200B patch clamp instrument (Molecular Devices,\nUSA) connected to two Ag/AgCl electrodes and a flow cell containing\nthe prepared nanopore, as described above. All measurements were conducted\nwith the “cis” chamber grounded, and sterile 3.6 M LiCl\ncontaining 10 mM HEPES (pH 8.0) was used as the running buffer. For\nsingle molecule detection, each sample was diluted 25-fold in LiCl\nbuffer and added to the “trans” side of the flow cell.\nA negative voltage was applied to drive negatively charged species\nthrough the nanopore. The ionic current was recorded at a sampling\nrate of 50 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. Single molecule translocation\nevents were analyzed using Clampfit 11.2 and OriginPro (version 2021b).\nData analysis included Gaussian fitting to determine the percentage\nof current blockage and exponential fitting for dwell time estimation,\nalong with graphical display of the results. Application Development\nfor Nanopore Event Extraction Web Application To enable more\ndetailed and reproducible analysis of nanopore translocation\nsignals, we developed a custom graphical user interface (GUI)-based\napplication ( Figure S1 Secondary Structure Prediction To\ninvestigate the conformational\nbehavior of the ligated circular probe and RCA products, secondary\nstructure predictions were performed using the Mfold web server. G Atomic Force Microscopy RCA products were deposited\non freshly cleaved mica, air-dried, and imaged using NanoWizard 3\n(JPK Instruments) in AC mode. Olympus OMCL-AC200TS tips were used\n(resonance frequency 150 kHz, spring constant 9 N/m). Images were\nacquired at 256 × 256 pixels and 1 Hz scan rate. Results\nand Discussion PAGE Validation of RCA Products The principle of Rolling\nCircle Amplification (RCA) for miR-21 detection is illustrated in Figure The success of the ligation and amplification steps was initially\nassessed using Urea-PAGE analysis ( Figure 2 Urea-PAGE (10%)\nanalysis of miR-21 ligation and RCA products over\ntime. Lanes M1 and M2 contain a low-range ssRNA ladder and a synthetic\nmiRNA marker, respectively. Lane 1 shows the migration of free miR-21,\nwhile lane 3 contains the linear single-stranded DNA padlock probe\n(P21). Lane 5 displays the ligation product of P21 with miR-21 in\nthe presence of T4 RNA ligase 2 (T4 Rnl2), indicating the formation\nof a circular DNA–RNA hybrid complex. Lanes 7, 8, and 9 correspond\nto rolling circle amplification (RCA) products after 0.5, 1.0, and\n2.0 h of incubation, respectively, all showing strong retention near\nthe wells consistent with high molecular weight concatemer formation.\nLane M3 is a 100 bp DNA ladder used as a reference for larger product\nsizes. A faint residual band corresponding\nto miR-21 was still visible\nafter the ligation step, which may result from either a small portion\nof unligated target due to incomplete hybridization or from partial\ndissociation of the circular probe–miR-21 complex under the\ndenaturing conditions of Urea-PAGE, as short RNA–DNA hybrids\ncan be disrupted by urea and applied voltage. To investigate the progression of\namplification over time, RCA\nproducts were analyzed after 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h of incubation. The\nobserved increase in product size with longer incubation times is\nconsistent with the high processivity and strand displacement activity\nof Phi29 DNA polymerase, which is capable of synthesizing DNA at an\naverage rate of 50–100 nucleotides per second under optimal\nconditions.  The accumulation\nof these long single-stranded DNA products was\nreflected in Urea-PAGE analysis. For each time point, the RCA products\nwere largely retained near the wells of the gel and did not migrate\nappreciably. This behavior is attributed to the high molecular weight\nand increased negative charge density of the concatemeric products,\nwhich limit their mobility through the polyacrylamide matrix. Additionally,\ndenaturing conditions (8 M urea) and the high voltage typically used\nin PAGE (e.g., 200 V) may further affect the structural flexibility\nof long single-stranded DNA, leading to partial folding or entanglement\nthat further impedes gel migration. While Urea-PAGE did not reveal\na clearly increasing band intensity across time points, the persistent\nwell retention of RCA products at all incubation durations indicates\nthe formation of high-molecular-weight concatemers. This observation\nis consistent with the known processivity and polymerization kinetics\nof Phi29 DNA polymerase under isothermal conditions.  These PAGE results therefore confirm the time-dependent elongation\nof RCA products and provide a robust biochemical foundation for subsequent\nsingle-molecule analysis using nanopore sensing. Nanopore Fabrication,\nCharacterization and Initial Observations To obtain single-molecule\ninformation beyond the ensemble trends\nby PAGE, we next fabricated and characterized solid-state nanopores\nfor the analysis of RCA products. Solid-state silicon nitride (SiN)\nnanopore was fabricated using the dielectric breakdown method, in\nwhich a strong electric field is applied across a thin membrane to\ninduce pore formation. Once the membrane reaches a threshold current,\na sudden increase in ionic current signals the formation of a nanoscale\ndefect, triggering the conditioning process to fine-tune the nanopore\ndiameter.  Figure 3 Solid-state nanopore fabrication and electrical characterization.\n(A) Time-dependent voltage and current profile during dielectric breakdown-based\nnanopore fabrication. The negative applied voltage was gradually increased\nin a staircase fashion across a 12 ± 2 nm-thick SiN membrane\nimmersed in 1 M KCl containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 8). A sharp increase\nin current (∼150 nA) indicates successful breakdown and nanopore\nformation. (B) Conditioning step performed in 3.6 M LiCl with 10 mM\nHEPES (pH 8), showing the enlargement of pore size over time and a\ndecreasing rectification ratio approaching zero, consistent with symmetric\npore geometry. (C) Current–voltage (I–V) curve of the\nfabricated nanopore under symmetric ionic conditions (3.6 M LiCl),\nshowing linear and ohmic behavior, confirming pore stability and the\nabsence of significant rectification. After defect formation, the solution was replaced with 3.6 M LiCl\ncontaining 10 mM HEPES (pH 8) to initiate the conditioning step, allowing\nthe pore to gradually enlarge. All subsequent nanopore measurements\nwere carried out in this buffer. LiCl was chosen because it slows\nDNA translocation and improves signal-to-noise ratios, enabling better\nresolution of long RCA products. Mg 2+ Figure Note on Imaging Limitation Due to\nthe random nature\nof nanopore formation using the dielectric breakdown method across\nthe 40 × 40 μm SiN diaphragm, direct visualization of the\nspecific pore using high-resolution TEM is technically challenging.\nAs a result, pore size estimation in this study was based on conductance\nmeasurementsa method widely accepted and validated within\nthe nanopore research community. Previous studies have demonstrated\nthat conductance-based sizing provides reliable diameter estimates\nconsistent with high-resolution imaging, particularly in dielectric\nbreakdown-fabricated nanopores and in long-term stability studies\nusing similar platforms. To verify the pore’s geometry and electrical behavior, we\nrecorded its current–voltage (I–V) characteristics under\nsymmetric salt conditions (3.6 M LiCl) ( Figure The pore conductance ( G G = σ [ 4 L π d 2 + 1 d ] − 1 G L d Nanopore Analysis of Ligation\nProduct To validate the\nmolecular identity of the ligation product prior to RCA, we performed\nsingle-molecule nanopore sensing using a previously characterized\n∼8 nm solid-state SiN nanopore. Four experimental conditions\nwere tested: (i) pure buffer (3.6 M LiCl with 10 mM HEPES, pH 8);\n(ii) a mixture of padlock probe (P21) (1 μL of 100 nM) and miR-21\n(1 μL of 10 nM); (iii) T4 RNA ligase 2 alone (1 μL of\n10 U); and (iv) the full ligation reaction mixture, consisting of\n1 μL of 100 nM linear DNA probe (P21), 1 μL of 10 nM miR-21,\n1 μL of 10X ligation buffer, 1 μL (10 units) of T4 Rnl2,\nand 6 μL of RNase-free water. All analyte-containing samples\nwere diluted 25-fold into LiCl buffer, vortexed briefly, and introduced\ninto the trans chamber of the flow cell; the cis side contained only\nbuffer. A voltage of −300 mV was applied to drive negatively\ncharged species through the nanopore. After dilution, the estimated\nfinal concentration of the ligation product was 0.4 nM, which falls\nwithin the typical detection range for single-molecule nanopore sensing\n(see Supporting Information Figure Supporting Information 4 Single-molecule nanopore sensing of ligation product using\nan 8\nnm solid-state SiN nanopore. (A) Representative current traces of\nfour sample conditions: pure buffer (top), P21 + miR-21, T4 Rnl2 alone,\nand the full ligation product (bottom, red trace). Only the ligation\nproduct generates frequent translocation events. (B) Scatter plot\nof %blockage current versus dwell time for the ligation product, with\naccompanying histograms. Two distinct populations are identified via\nGaussian fitting, potentially corresponding to circular P21 with and\nwithout miR-21 hybridization. While it is theoretically possible that the ligation product forms\ntransient complexes with the enzyme, such interactions are unlikely\nunder our experimental conditions. The 3.6 M LiCl buffer is known\nto weaken protein–nucleic acid interactions and promote dissociation\nof loosely bound complexes.  Figure  Theoretical structure prediction using Mfold supports this\ninterpretation,\nrevealing that unhybridized P21 adopts multiple low-stability conformations\n( Supporting Information Figure 5 Schematic illustration of the predicted structural\ndifferences\nbetween the circular DNA probe P21 alone (left) and hybridized with\nmiR-21 (right). In the unbound state, P21 adopts a flexible conformation\nwith minimal secondary structure (shown in green). Upon hybridization\nwith miR-21 (shown in red), the loop region becomes stabilized through\nduplex formation, resulting in a more defined and rigid structure.\nThis depiction is based on theoretical secondary structure predictions\nusing the Mfold server and supports the observed nanopore translocation\nbehavior under high-salt conditions (3.6 M LiCl, −300 mV). Importantly, the hybridization between miR-21 and\nthe loop region\nof P21 is expected to remain intact during nanopore analysis. Although\n3.6 M LiCl provides slightly less stabilization for DNA–RNA\nduplexes compared to NaCl or KCl, the 22 nt duplex formed between\nmiR-21 and P21 remains thermodynamically stable. Furthermore, while\nthe applied voltage of −300 mV imposes an electrophoretic force,\nthe stability of the duplex is sufficient to withstand disruption\nunder these conditions. This interpretation is consistent with the\nobserved translocation signals and further supported by the structural\nmodels presented in the Supporting Information RCA Time-dependent Translocation Behavior To monitor\nthe progression of the RCA reaction, we analyzed the translocation\nbehavior of the resulting DNA concatemers using single molecule nanopore\nsensing. RCA reactions were performed for three different incubation\ntimes: 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h. After amplification, the reaction products\nwere diluted 25-fold into 3.6 M LiCl containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 8)\nand added to the trans chamber of the flow cell. The cis chamber contained\nonly LiCl buffer, and a constant voltage of −300 mV was applied. Representative ionic current traces of the three RCA samples are\nshown in Figure Figure 6 Nanopore sensing of RCA\nproducts at different incubation times\nusing an 8 nm solid-state silicon nitride (SiN) nanopore. (A–C)\nRepresentative ionic current traces for RCA products after 30 min\n(A), 1 h (B), and 2 h (C) of amplification. A higher frequency of\ntranslocation events and deeper current blockages are observed with\nlonger incubation times. (D–F) Scatter plots of percentage\ncurrent blockage versus dwell time for each corresponding incubation\nperiod, accompanied by histograms. Both current blockage and dwell\ntime distributions were fitted with Gaussian and exponential function.\nThe progressive increase in dwell time and percentage current blockage\nwith amplification time is consistent with the formation of longer\nand more structurally complex RCA products. The results indicate that both dwell time and % blockage current\nincreased with longer incubation times, consistent with the progressive\nelongation and structural complexity of RCA products. As detailed\nearlier, Phi29 polymerase produces long concatemeric strands by continuously\nappending repeats of the circular template. Given the 76 nt length\nof the P21 template, this corresponds to approximately 1200–9500\ntandem repeats per concatemer, depending on reaction duration and\nenzyme performance. To better understand the structural complexity\nof the RCA products\nand its potential impact on nanopore translocation behavior, we predicted\nthe secondary structures of a 2000-nucleotide RCA concatemer sequence\nusing the Mfold web server under experimental conditions (3 M Na + Figure 7 Predicted secondary structures of the linear\nrolling circle amplification\n(RCA) product containing 2000 nucleotides, generated from the reverse\ncomplement of the circular P21 probe. (A,B) show two representative\nlow-energy conformations predicted using the Mfold web server + G To ensure that the recorded nanopore signals originated from RCA\nproducts rather than other reaction components, we considered potential\ncontributions from proteins present in the amplification mixture,\nincluding T4 RNA ligase 2, Phi29 DNA polymerase, and bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA). Control experiments shown in Figure Supporting Information  Statistical\nanalysis ( Table 2 Statistical Characteristics of the\nMean Peak % Blockage Current and Dwell Time for the Ligation Product\nand RCA Products at Different Time Points sample %blockade\ncurrent dwell time\n(ms) ligation product 13.2 ± 0.1 and 18.4 ± 0.1 1.2 ± 0.1 RCA-0.5 h 8.3 ± 0.4 4.7 ± 2.4 RCA-1 h 8.9 ± 0.3 19.2 ± 8.3 RCA-2 h 17.8 ± 0.2 88.3 ± 30.4 a Error values (±)\nrepresent\nstandard deviations derived from Gaussian and exponential fitting\nof the translocation event distributions. It is worth noting that the ligation product displayed\na higher\nmean % blockade current than the RCA-0.5 h and RCA-1 h products ( Table Figure Supporting Information Beyond product tracking,\nthis approach provides valuable mechanistic\ninsights into the RCA reaction itself. The progressive increase in\nsignal complexity with incubation time reflects the stochastic yet\nprocessive behavior of Phi29 DNA polymerase, which generates increasingly\nlong concatemeric products from circular templates. Mfold-based structure\npredictions support the formation of repetitive stem–loop domains\nthat contribute to the observed increase in translocation dwell time\nand blockage current. These features suggest that the RCA products\nnot only increase in size, but also fold into increasingly complex\nand structured configurations over time. As such, nanopore analysis\nenables direct, label-free observation of structural evolution during\nRCA and serves as a useful tool for probing the kinetics, uniformity,\nand conformational behavior of DNA amplification reactions at the\nsingle-molecule level. In this study, nanopores with an effective\ndiameter of ∼8 nm were chosen for RCA product analysis. Although\nsmaller pores of ∼6 nm have been used in some prior studies\nto probe short nucleic acids and compact duplexes, we found that such\npores tend to clog frequently when challenged with the long concatemeric\nproducts generated during RCA. In contrast, larger pores (>10 nm)\noften produce shallow blockades, making it difficult to discriminate\nbetween structural states. The ∼8 nm size therefore represents\na practical compromise, providing sufficient sensitivity to resolve\nstructural differences while maintaining stability during long recordings.\nThis choice is also consistent with previous reports demonstrating\nthe suitability of ∼8 nm pores for single-molecule analysis\nof circular and linear nucleic acids fabricated by dielectric breakdown.\nWhile the present work focused on proof-of-concept RCA monitoring\nusing a single pore size, future studies will systematically investigate\nmultiple nanopore diameters to further validate the robustness and\ngenerality of the observed trends. Classification and Interpretation\nof Nanopore Translocation\nEvents To further investigate the structural dynamics of\nRCA products during nanopore sensing, a custom-developed web-based\ngraphical user interface (GUI) was used to extract and analyze individual\ntranslocation events. Raw ionic current traces were uploaded, and\nbaseline (lvl0), threshold (lvl1), tolerance, and padding parameters\nwere adjusted to define event boundaries. Events were detected when\nthe current deviated beyond the set threshold, and each trace was\nanalyzed to determine dwell time and percentage current blockage.\nThis approach enabled consistent, parameter-defined extraction of\nevent data across different RCA conditions, with manual validation\nperformed to ensure reliability. Extracted events were classified\ninto three dwell time categories: short (<0.3 ms), medium (0.3–1.0\nms), and long (>1.0 ms) ( Figure 8 Representative nanopore\ncurrent traces extracted using the developed\napplication and classified based on dwell time: (Top) Short events\n(<0.3 ms), (Middle) Medium events (0.3–1.0 ms), and (Bottom)\nLong events (>1.0 ms). Short events potentially reflect small or\nminimally\nfolded RCA products, medium events may correspond to moderately structured\nconcatemers, and long events likely associated with highly folded\nor entangled RCA products. To further strengthen these observations, additional nanopore measurements\nwere performed with larger event counts across the three incubation\ntimes. Despite differences in absolute numbers, the proportional trends\nwere highly consistent with our initial data set: short events dominated\nat 0.5 h but decreased progressively with longer incubation times,\nwhile long events increased steadily, reaching ∼26–30%\nat 2 h. Medium events remained relatively stable across all time points.\nThis reproducibility across independent data sets reinforces the robustness\nof our classification approach and provides stronger statistical confidence\nthat the observed changes in translocation signals reflect genuine,\ntime-dependent structural evolution of RCA products. In addition\nto dwell time-based categorization, two distinct complex\ntranslocation patterns were consistently observed ( Figure Figure Figure  9 Examples\nof asymmetric nanopore translocation events observed in\nRCA products. (A) A high blockage event followed by a sloping recovery.\n(B) A sloping current trend leading into a high blockage. These features\nreflect variations in molecular structure and unfolding dynamics during\ntranslocation. Together, dwell time classification\nand the identification of asymmetric\nor multistep translocation events offer molecular-level insight into\nRCA product elongation and folding. Longer dwell times reflect extended\nproduct lengths or stable folding, while irregular current traces\nindicate secondary structure formation and sequential unfolding. These\nfeatures provide real-time, label-free evidence of structural heterogeneity\nin RCA products, thereby advancing our understanding of RCA kinetics\nand highlighting the power of solid-state nanopores for single-molecule\nstructural profiling. To complement these single-molecule observations,\nwe next performed atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging to directly\nvisualize RCA products at different time points. AFM Imaging\nof RCA Products To complement nanopore\ntranslocation data and directly visualize RCA product morphology,\nAFM was performed on amplification samples collected at three incubation\ntime points: 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h. Undiluted RCA reaction products\n(2 μL) were directly deposited onto freshly cleaved mica, allowed\nto adsorb briefly, and air-dried. Imaging was conducted in tapping\nmode under ambient conditions. Based on standard RCA reaction\nconditions and yields, the amount of DNA deposited per sample is estimated\nto be in the tens to hundreds of nanograms, corresponding to a local\nmass concentration in the ng/μL to low μg/μL rangesufficient\nfor effective surface coverage and visualization via AFM. Representative\nAFM images are shown in Figure Figure Figure 10 Atomic force microscopy\n(AFM) imaging of RCA products at different\nincubation times. Representative AFM images of rolling circle amplification\n(RCA) products collected after (A) 30 min, (B) 1 h (diluted sample\nshown; additional optimized images provided in Supporting Information Figure For the 1 h RCA sample, dilution\nof the product solution prior\nto deposition reduced aggregation and enabled clearer visualization\nof concatemeric DNA chains. As shown in Figure Supporting Information Figure Figure Importantly, although AFM and nanopore measurements were not conducted\nin identical buffer conditionsnanopore recordings utilized\na high-salt environment (3.6 M LiCl), while AFM imaging was performed\nafter depositing undiluted RCA samples onto mica followed by drying\nprocessthe consistent morphological and translocation trends\nobserved across both platforms reinforce the robustness of the conclusions. The AFM results provide physical and morphological confirmation\nof the structural evolution of RCA products over time, complementing\nthe nanopore-based single-molecule sensing and Mfold-based secondary\nstructure predictions. These combined data sets further validate the\napplication of solid-state nanopores for real-time, label-free monitoring\nof RCA reaction kinetics and product formation at the single-molecule\nlevel. Conclusions In conclusion, we have\ndemonstrated a proof-of-concept integration\nof rolling circle amplification (RCA) with solid-state nanopore sensing\nfor real-time, single-molecule monitoring of nucleic acid amplification.\nUsing miR-21 as a model biomarker, our results reveal clear amplification-dependent\nchanges in nanopore translocation signatures, characterized by progressively\nincreasing dwell times, shifts in blockade currents, and the emergence\nof complex event types. These findings were consistently supported\nby PAGE validation, AFM imaging, and secondary structure predictions,\ntogether providing a coherent picture of RCA product growth and conformational\ndiversity. Our statistical event classification further confirmed\nthe time-dependent\nshift in translocation behavior, with longer dwell times and increasing\nproportions of complex events observed at later amplification stages.\nImportantly, these trends were reproducible across independent data\nsets, reinforcing the robustness of the approach and increasing confidence\nin the observed time-dependent evolution of RCA products. Although\nthis study focused on three incubation times and a single\nnanopore size (∼8 nm), the consistency of the results establishes\na solid foundation for future studies that expand to broader experimental\nconditions. Overall, these findings highlight the promise of solid-state\nnanopores as a powerful platform for label-free monitoring of nucleic\nacid amplification at the single-molecule level, with potential applications\nin molecular diagnostics and real-time biosensing.
