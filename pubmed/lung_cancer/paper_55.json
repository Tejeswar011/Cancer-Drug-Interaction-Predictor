Metagenomic next-generation sequencing detection BALF specimens were processed following standard protocols. DNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing were conducted using the TIANamp Micro DNA Kit, Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and MGI2 platform, respectively. Sequencing data underwent quality control, removal of human sequences, and mapping against the BGI Pathogens Metagenomics Database. A multi-tiered filtering strategy was applied to enhance specificity, with details provided in the Supplementary Materials. Conventional microbiological testing Conventional microbiological testing was performed for all enrolled patients according to a standardized protocol that included (i) bacterial and fungal cultures of sputum and BALF specimens on blood and chocolate agars incubated at 35 °C for 48 h; (ii) multiplex PCR panels detecting 15 common respiratory pathogens— Legionella pneumophila Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa Klebsiella pneumoniae Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Staphylococcus aureus Acinetobacter baumannii Enterobacter cloacae Escherichia coli Aspergillus fumigatus Pneumocystis jirovecii influenza A/B respiratory syncytial virus Data preprocessing, variable selection, and machine learning model development Missing data were addressed with multiple imputation using the mice package in R, and 52 potential predictor variables, including demographic, disease, and laboratory data, were evaluated. 7 variables were selected for the final predictive model through ROC analysis, Spearman correlation, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression. The dataset was randomly split into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Five machine learning algorithms were tested for model construction, with XGBoost emerging as the top performer following extensive hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation. SHAP values were calculated to enhance model interpretability, offering insights into both global feature importance and local predictions. Further methodological details are available in the Supplementary Materials. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were conducted using R software version 4.4.1, with data visualizations in GraphPad Prism 8.0.1 and data management in Microsoft Excel 2021. Continuous variables were assessed for normality via the Shapiro-Wilk test, reported as mean ± SD (normal) or median (interquartile range) (non-normal), with group comparisons using distribution-appropriate tests. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies/percentages, analyzed via chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests. The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using stratified sampling (caret v6.0-94). LASSO regression for variable selection (glmnet v4.1-8) used 10-fold cross-validation for optimal lambda. Model performance was evaluated via accuracy, AUC-ROC, sensitivity, and specificity, with ROC curves (pROC v1.18.4) and AUC comparisons via DeLong test (pROC). Five machine learning models were developed: XGBoost (xgboost v1.7.5.1), logistic regression (stats), random forest (randomForest v4.7-1.1), SVM (e1071 v1.7-13), and neural networks (nnet v7.3-19). SHAP values (shapviz v0.9.0) interpreted model features. Internal validation used 1000 bootstrap resamples (boot v1.3-28.1). For identifying predictors of 28-day mortality in the PJP cohort, univariate logistic regression was first performed to screen variables.

A B 2 2 C D E F Discussion The utilization of mNGS in our study offers a significant advantage over CMT, as it allows for a comprehensive and unbiased assessment of the microbiome. This is particularly relevant in immunocompromised patients, who are at higher risk for atypical and polymicrobial infections [ 23 24 25 26 The XGBoost model developed in our study demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing PJP from PJC, with AUC of 0.9000 on the test set. This outperformed other machine learning algorithms, due to XGBoost's ability to handle complex, non-linear relationships and its robustness in the presence of missing data [ 27 28 P. jirovecii + 29 + Pneumocystis + Firstly, BDG, a serum marker commonly employed for invasive fungal infections, was identified as a significant predictor in our model, despite its limited specificity for P. jirovecii 30 31 32 P. jirovecii Candida Aspergillus Histoplasma P. jirovecii 33 34 P. jirovecii + + 35 36 + + P. jirovecii 37 P. jirovecii 38 In our study, the PaO 2 2 + P. jirovecii + + + + + The survival curve analysis from our study delineates a complex interplay of factors that significantly impact patient outcomes in patients with PJP. The analysis of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) revealed a statistically significant decrease in overall survival when compared to the other three groups (P < 0.001), highlighting the elevated risk of severe complications in IMID patients with P. jirovecii 13 39 14 40 Despite the promising results of our study, several limitations and areas for future research should be acknowledged. Firstly, the retrospective nature of the study may introduce selection bias, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. The high cost of mNGS technology may also restrict its widespread adoption in clinical diagnostics. Furthermore, the lack of detailed information on the types, dosages, and durations of immunosuppressive therapy may have influenced the comprehensive assessment of risk factors for P. jirovecii P. jirovecii Conclusions The study emphasizes mNGS's role in detecting P. jirovecii P. jirovecii + Supplementary Information  Additional file 1: Supplemental Material 1: Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing Detection. Supplemental Material 2: Missing Data Handling and Independent Risk Factors of mNGS with BALF for Differential PJP and PJC. Supplemental Material 3: Machine Learning Explainable Tool. Fig.S1 Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve for Potential Risk Factors. Fig.S2 Heatmap of Correlation Between Potential Risk Factors. Fig.S3 Calibration Curves of Predictive Models. Fig.S4 Selection of risk factors for mortality in patients with PJP at 28th day by LASSO regression.
