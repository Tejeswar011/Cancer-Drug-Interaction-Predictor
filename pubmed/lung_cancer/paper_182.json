Evaluating the therapeutic benefit of drugs will help guide pricing decisions and are an opportunity to improve healthcare affordability. Discussion: We conducted a cross-sectional study of the 50 most expensive drugs by dosage unit covered by Medicare Part B, Medicare Part D, and Medicaid in 2022. We reported their level of clinical benefit as evaluated by health technology assessment agencies in France and Germany, their level of innovation as rated by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, and their safety and effectiveness ratings as measured by Prescrire International, an independent French organisation that evaluates medicines. Our study found that among the 50 most expensive drugs in the U.S. covered by Medicare and Medicaid in 2022, 28 (56%) were rated by French and German HTAs as having low therapeutic benefit and most (n = 20; 40%) were rated by Prescrire International as having poor effectiveness-safety ratings. Almost all (n = 48; 96%) drugs were ineligible under current exclusion criteria for price negotiations. Conclusion: Many of the most expensive drugs were rated as having low added clinical benefit. As the US begins price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act, understanding the clinical value of drugs may help inform debates over drug affordability.

Cross-sectional studies of oncology drugs showed no association between prices and clinical benefit (Vokinger et al., 2020 2022 2023 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the first cohort of drugs eligible for price negotiations in August 2024. The CMS have indicated they will consider therapeutic value in negotiating prices for certain high-expenditure drugs (Seshamani, 2024 Methods We identified the 50 most expensive drugs, based on average spending per dosage unit in 2022, from the CMS drug spending dashboards across Medicare Parts B and D and Medicaid. We reported the drug’s therapeutic area, orphan drug status, and level of innovation. These attributes have been used in previous literature to characterise innovation and therapeutic value (Lexchin, 2016 2024 2017 2013 To determine drugs’ therapeutic benefit, we extracted ratings from Health Technology Assessment (HTA) organisations in France (Haute Autorité de Santé) and Germany (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss), which independently assess and publish evaluations of a drug’s therapeutic benefit compared to current standard treatment options. Consistent with prior research, we defined a drug as having ‘high’ added therapeutic benefit if at least one HTA rated it as having ‘high’ benefit (for France’s HTA, ratings of ‘major’, ‘important’, or ‘moderate’; for German HTA, ratings of ‘major additional benefit’ or ‘considerable benefit’), or as ‘low’ added therapeutic benefit if both HTAs rated it as having ‘low’ benefit as compared to current standard treatment options (Hwang et al., 2020 Lastly, we categorised drugs by their eligibility for price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act (Cubanski, 2025 Medicare Drug Price Negotiation | CMS 2025 We calculated descriptive statistics using Microsoft Excel. In accordance with the Common Rule, this cross-sectional study was exempt from ethics review and informed consent because it used public, nonidentifiable data and was not human participant research. We followed the STROBE reporting guidelines. Results The median cost of the 50 most expensive drugs was $$16,177.96 per dose (IQR $$10,860.48–$$33,318.53). Thirty-one (62%) were biologics, 16 (32%) small molecules, and 3 (6%) gene or cellular-based therapies ( Table 1 Table 1.

Discussion Our study found that among the 50 most expensive drugs in the U.S. covered by Medicare and Medicaid in 2022, over half were rated by French and German HTAs as having low therapeutic benefit and most were rated by Prescrire International as having poor effectiveness-safety ratings, including 6 as ‘not acceptable’ or ‘to avoid’. These findings are consistent with prior research demonstrating that over half of the top-selling drugs covered by Medicare have low therapeutic benefit ratings (Egilman et al., 2023 2017 2021 Conclusion As the US enters only its second round of price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act, it is important to recognise that many healthcare systems negotiate drug prices based on independent HTA evaluations of the drug’s therapeutic benefits. While nearly all these most expensive drugs would be exempt from CMS drug pricing negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act, understanding their therapeutic value may help inform future efforts to expand the current scope of drug pricing negotiations and to improve healthcare affordability.
