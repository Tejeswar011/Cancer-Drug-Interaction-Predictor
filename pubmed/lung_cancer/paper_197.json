Summary Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare but often aggressive type of B cell lymphoma with a high risk of relapse. To explore intratumoral clonal diversity and tumor evolution related to disease relapse, we integrate single-cell RNA and B cell receptor sequencing with whole-genome sequencing in 20 diagnosed/untreated and/or relapsed samples from 11 MCL patients. Our results reveal significant intratumor heterogeneity in MCL already at diagnosis. We further show that the evolutionary paths during disease progression for each patient are unique, where minor clones present at diagnosis may acquire different mutations and copy-number variations and/or migrate to various microenvironments. Despite significant interpatient heterogeneity, recurrent genetic and transcriptomic changes in tumor cells affecting key signaling pathways, along with alterations involved in the tumor microenvironment, are also observed during disease progression. Taken together, our findings elucidate the diverse and dynamic tumor-immune evolution processes associated with disease progression and relapse in MCL.

MCL patients typically present with enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) and involvement of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and bone marrow (BM). 1 2 , 3 , 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 5 , 12 , 13 MCLs exhibit high genomic instability and genetic heterogeneity. More than 95% of MCL patients exhibit a characteristic IGH-CCND1 ATM TP53 14 , 15 KMT2D TERT CDKN2A MYC BIRC3 BCL2 CARD11 NFKBIE NOTCH1 NOTCH2 UBR5 S1PR1 14 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 23 , 24 /TP53 /CDKN2A /ATM 25 MCL patients have a high rate of relapse after first-line therapies (40%–60% within 5 years). 26 , 27 TP53 NOTCH1/2 CDKN2A 28 , 29 CARD11 S1PR1 16 , 22 24 16 , 30 31 BTK 32 Beyond intrinsic tumor abnormalities, the tumor microenvironment (TME) is also important in tumor progression and treatment resistance. Ex vivo 33 34 31 35 , 36 To further investigate mechanisms underlying disease heterogeneity, progression, and relapse in MCL, we integrated whole-genome sequencing (WGS), scRNA-seq, and matched single-cell B cell receptor sequencing (scBCR-seq) in paired primary-relapsed samples from patients treated with several first-line therapies, including immunochemotherapy, chemotherapy, and ASCT. We dissected the tumor clone architecture, inferred clonal evolutionary trajectories for each tumor pair, and tracked dynamic changes in tumor-infiltrating immune cells during disease progression and relapse. Results Generation of a single-cell atlas for MCL We recruited 11 patients with conventional MCL (cMCL) for single-cell analysis ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Tables S1 S2 S3 Figure 1 37 38 Figure 1 Single-cell atlas of MCL (A) Overview of the patient cohort with a schematic of treatment and time for sample collection for scRNA-seq.

Structural variants in CCND1 IGH-CCND1 Figure S2 Tables S2 S3 S4 S5 To further characterize the transcriptomic heterogeneity of malignant B cells, we performed differential gene expression analysis among malignant B cells from various samples after removing the Ig genes. A set of highly variable genes (HVGs) was identified as characteristic of malignant B cells from individual samples; for example, MEF2B PIM1 MYC BRAF BCL6 Figure 2 CCND3 MYC CDK14 NFKB2 NFKBIA/B/D/Z CARD11 REL BCL6 FOXO1 IRF4 IRF8 GNA13 ATM PARP1 MEF2B POU2F2 HIST1H2AC CD79B PLCG2, SYK Figure S2 Common molecular characteristics of MCLs To identify common transcriptomic changes in MCL while minimizing tissue-specific effects, we compared the gene expression profiles of malignant cells from individual tumors with those of normal B cells identified from matched tissues—BM or LN ( Figure S2 Figure S2 CCND1 BCL2 FOXO1 CXCR4 HIST1H1E CD81 ETV6 CDK14 PRKC B CARD11 GNA1 2 Next, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) was performed to determine the expression programs of malignant B cells from each tumor. Ninety-one expression programs were extracted from 20 MCL samples, with an average of 4.6 programs per sample (range: 2–6) ( Table S5 Figure 2 Table S5 Figure 2 GSE93291 39 Figure 2 To identify potential therapeutic targets related to treatment resistance, we applied a pseudobulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) approach to compare gene expression profiles across the four primary-relapse pairs, identifying 15 common DEGs in at least three pairs ( Figure S2 MYC GADD45B HSP90AB1 B2M CD52 CD83 CRIP1 TMSB10 ZFP36L1 YBX1 DDX21 NCL GSE93291 MYC CD52 NCL HSP90AB1 Figure S2 Although somatic mutation profiles vary among MCLs, TP53 ATM Figure 2 ATM ATM Figures S2 N Figure S2 IGH-CCND1 ATM TP53 UBR5 MEF2B SMARCA4 KMT2D NOTCH1 S1PR1 NOTCH2 BIRC3 NOTCH1 NOTCH1 cMCLs are believed to originate from naive-like B cells, which have not undergone GC reactions and thus have few somatic hypermutations (SHMs) in their variable (V) regions. Indeed, malignant B cells from all MCL patients expressed the IgM isotype and presented a low SHM rate (<2%), except for two patients (MC205: 3.5% and MC2: 2.7%). While different patients had varying VDJ combinations, each displayed consistent VDJ gene usage during disease progression ( Table S4 IGHV3-21 IGLV3-19 In summary, despite significant interpatient heterogeneity in MCLs, common molecular features were identified, including shared transcriptomic changes, frequently mutated genes, and stereotyped BCRs in a subset of tumors. Recurrently mutated genes and dysregulation of key genes and signaling pathways (e.g., MYC-targeted and NF-κB) were also identified during disease relapse. The TME in MCL To explore the TME of MCL, we reclustered T cells and NK cells from both the MCL and control samples, totaling 52,507 cells, and identified four major cell types: CD8 + + Figure 3 40 , 41 + + dim hi bright lo Figures 3 S3 + + + Figures 3 S3 Figure 3 Tumor microenvironment in MCL (A) UMAPs of T and NK cell subtypes.

L-R pairs are labeled on the left and colored according to their costimulation or coinhibition features. (E) Interactions between malignant cells and TME cells at different sampling times. p Figures S3 S4 We subsequently analyzed the TME composition at the sample level by integrating the nonmalignant B cells identified earlier. Overall, the cell composition of the TME varied among tissues ( Figure 3 Figures 3 S3 Figures S3 To further understand the regulatory relationships among different cell subtypes, we investigated ligand-receptor (L‒R) pair interactions related to the immune response using previously described methods. 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 Figure 3 + + + Figure 3 Figure S3 in vitro Figures S4 + Figure 3 Figures 3 S3 Figure 3 In summary, the TME in MCL predominantly comprises T cells, NK cells, myeloid cells, and B cells, with variations in proportions across different tissues. TME cells potentially support tumor cell survival through CD40- and BAFF-mediated signaling, while tumor cells may induce T cell and NK exhaustion via TIM3 coinhibitory signaling. A significantly increased CD70-CD27 interaction was noted in relapsed samples. Intratumor transcriptional heterogeneity from diagnosis to relapse To explore tumor clonal evolution during disease progression, we reclustered malignant B cells from paired samples from each patient. Patient MC202 was excluded from this analysis because of the limited number of malignant cells ( n Figure 4 46 47 Figure 4 Figure 4 Intratumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution during disease progression (A) UMAPs of tumor cells in each patient with available paired samples (upper) and trajectory analysis between different sampling times (lower).

(B) Heatmap showing the scaled average expression of MCL-related key genes in malignant cells at the intrasample subcluster level. Clusters are first grouped by donor, followed by samples. (C) CNV scores of the transcriptional clusters in each sample. CNV scores were calculated by quantifying the number of genes with CNVs inferred from the scRNA-seq data, using a threshold of less than 0.95 or greater than 1.05. Each violin represents the distribution of CNV scores for the respective groups, with a line indicating the median. The color represents different samples. Next, we compared the expression levels of key oncogenes across intratumor subclusters to understand the transcriptional heterogeneity within individual tumors. Overall, most of these genes exhibited varying expression levels across individual subclusters within a single patient ( Figure 4 CDK14 CARD11 MYC Figure 4 Dissecting tumor clone evolution by multilayer data integration in patient MC3 MC3 was initially diagnosed with indolent MCL and did not receive any therapy. Tumor samples were collected from BM and LN biopsies during watchful waiting (MC3P1 and MC3P1_LN), from BM biopsy during disease progression (MC3P2), and from tumor-involved intestine and BM biopsies at relapse (MC3Ri and MC3Rb) ( Figure 1 Clonal BCR analysis revealed three unique clonotypes (SHM0, SHM1, and SHM2) with 0–2 mutations in the IGHV Figures 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 st nd st Figure 5 Intratumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution from primary to relapsed tumors in MC3 (A) Alignment of IGHV nucleotide sequences identified from the clonal BCR.

See also Figures S5–S9 We compared the CNV patterns between subclusters from different sampling times and found distinct features in certain subclusters ( Figure 5 Figure 5 IGHV Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Analyzing the somatic mutational pattern allowed us to further delineate the clonal structure and evolution patterns in longitudinal samples. 48 , 49 , 50 IGH-CCND1 MEF2B Figure 5 NOTCH1 S1PR1 SMARCA4 UBR5) CDK N 2 A ETS1 Figure 5 Overall, we inferred tumor evolution in patient MC3 by incorporating somatic mutations into transcriptional and BCR changes ( Figure 5 IGH -CCND1 MEF2B NOTCH1 S1PR1 IGHV SMARCA4 UBR5 IGHV CDKN2A Figure 5 The TME compositions of the three MC3 BM-derived samples were largely similar and dominated by CD8.Teff, CD16.NK, CD4.Tm, and CD8.Tn cells, whereas the intestinal sample was composed of >95% malignant cells with minimal immune infiltration ( Figure S4 Figures S4 + + While different malignant subclusters within the same tumor exhibited largely similar cell crosstalk patterns, we observed notable exceptions in MC3Rb. Specifically, the malignant subcluster C13 (SHM2) showed significantly stronger CD70-CD27-mediated interactions with CD4.Treg and CD8.Tex cells compared with subcluster C1 (SHM1) and other malignant subclusters in two primary tumors ( Figure 6 CD70 CD70 Figure 6 CD70 CD27 + + Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 High CD70 expression and strong CD70-CD27 interaction in MC3 relapse tumors (A) CD70-CD27 interaction between malignant subclusters and T subsets.

Dissecting tumor clone evolution during disease progression in MCL patients We applied the same analytical approach to investigate tumor clonal evolution and tumor-immune cell interactions in the remaining five patients, with detailed findings described in the corresponding figure legends ( Figures S5–S9 Figure S5 Figure S6 Figure S7 Figures S8 S9 In summary, our analysis demonstrated that MCL tumors harbor multiple subclones at initial diagnosis. While certain clones may be eliminated by first-line treatments, residual tumor cells—either from the same clone or from distinct subclones—may enter a quiescent state. Subsequent acquisition of genetic alterations or favorable changes in the TME enables these residual cell populations to re-enter the cell cycle, ultimately driving disease progression or relapse. Discussion In this study, we utilized scRNA-seq and WGS technologies to elucidate tumor heterogeneity, track clonal evolution, and characterize the tissue microenvironment in primary-relapse paired MCL patients following initial first-line treatments. Our results revealed high interpatient, intrapatient, and intratumor heterogeneity, with more than 90 gene expression programs identified in MCL cells. Additionally, we characterized various nonmalignant B cell subclusters and immune cell subclusters from the TME. More than 1,198 potential cell-cell interactions were further predicted, indicating the existence of a complex and dynamic TME in MCL. Furthermore, we elucidated tumor clone structures and clonal evolution by integrating BCR phylogeny, genetic alterations, and transcriptional changes, demonstrating that each patient may follow a unique evolutionary path during disease progression and relapse. Although patients expressed different tumor BCR clones, the IGHV3-21:IGLV3-19 51 IGHV3-21 52 , 53 54 , 55 Tumor heterogeneity at different levels has significant clinical implications. First, a notable degree of interpatient tumor heterogeneity, characterized by distinct BCR clonotypes, CNV patterns, and transcriptional activities among patients, underscores the necessity for precision medicine. For example, patient MC207, exhibiting increased PARP1 ATM TP53 56 CD70 57 , 58 Our study represents a comprehensive single-cell level analysis of the MCL TME, characterizing over 40,000 infiltrating immune cells, with variation observed among tissues. Consistent with previous findings in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL), 42 , 46 + + + + + 59 , 60 , 61 , 62 + 63 64 58 , 60 , 65 CD70 CD70 66 42 67 , 68 69 , 70 , 71 Finally, we elucidated the clonal evolution throughout the disease course of MCL. Our multidimensional evidence demonstrated the coexistence of linear and branching evolution during MCL progression. Various tumor subclones may carry distinct mutations across various tumor sites in untreated patients, suggesting that tumor clones may gain survival advantages in different tissues by acquiring additional mutations. Furthermore, not all tumor cells/clones are eliminated by ASCT or R-chemotherapy. The residual tumor cells/clones may evolve by gaining distinct mutations (e.g., CDKN2A ATM TP53 Tumor clones may respond differently to different therapies. In the two patients who underwent ASCT (MC3 and MC205), genetically and transcriptionally different subclones were present before treatment, and some subclones expanded in the relapse tumor through the acquisition of additional mutations ( CDKN2A SELENBP1 CD70 ZFP36L1 BIRC5 35 + 35 TIGIT 36 Limitations of the study Our single-cell analysis of matched primary and relapsed MCL samples provides a comprehensive view, with longitudinal sampling across diverse first-line treatments offering a representative snapshot of relapse scenarios following conventional therapies. However, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the relatively small cohort size limits the ability to identify common evolutionary patterns. Second, variations in tissue origin may introduce cofounding tissue-associated signatures that complicate the interpretation of paired primary-relapse comparisons. Third, the heterogeneity of treatment regimens restricts our ability to dissect treatment-specific selective pressures during relapse. Fourth, although our study focuses on conventional regimens, the current primary therapy increasingly incorporates BTK inhibitors, and other targeted therapies and immunotherapies are being evaluated. Expanding future analyses to include these additional regimens will provide more comprehensive insights into resistance mechanisms and clonal evolution.

Among them, 11 patients had tumor samples suitable for scRNA-seq, scBCR-seq, and WGS. After quality control, high-quality scRNA-seq data were obtained from all patients, matched scBCR-seq data from 10 patients, and matched WGS data from 9 of these 11 patients. For the remaining 11 patients, tumor samples were only analyzed by WGS. For scRNA-seq and scBCR-seq, viable frozen cells from tumor tissues were used. For WGS, either frozen tumor tissues or viable frozen tumor cells were used, along with matched germline (non-tumor) samples obtained from peripheral blood or sorted/enriched non-B cells. Additionally, one BM sample was obtained from a cancer-free donor and used as a control scRNA-seq dataset. Our MCL patients received various treatments, including watchful waiting, ASCT, radiotherapy, CHOP, and R-CHOP-like regimens. The sample metadata, including donor gender, age, health status, treatment and other clinical factors are summarized in Table S1 Method details Single-cell preparation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Sample processing protocols were adapted from protocols described previously. 74 Cells used for flow cytometry were thawed in RPMI 1640 cell medium (Gibco). Subsequently, cells were incubated with human FcR Blocking Reagent (Miltenyi Biotec) for 10 min and stained with anti-CD19 BV421 and anti-CD235a FITC in FACS buffer (PBS with 2% FBS) for 20 min on ice.

Seurat (version 4.3.0) was used to process the filtered gene count matrix and generate QC metrics. Genes detected in fewer than three cells were removed, and cells expressing fewer than 500 genes were removed. To remove potential doublets or multiplets, cells expressing more than 5000 genes or with sequencing counts exceeding 40,000 were excluded from further analysis. In addition, cells exhibiting high percentages of mitochondrial transcripts (>20%) or low percentages of ribosomal transcripts (<5%) were removed. Data processing, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised cell clustering Good-quality cells from all the samples were merged using Seurat, and the count data were normalized using the SCTransform function with default parameters. Dimension reduction was performed using principal component analysis (PCA). Subsequently, the RunHarmony function was applied to correct batch effects among datasets. The top 30 principal components were further used for clustering at a resolution of 0.6. Clusters were identified by an SNN modularity optimization-based clustering algorithm and visualized by UMAP. Cell type identification To obtain a relatively accurate cell type, the annotation of various cell types was performed in three rounds. First, the cluster of all good-quality cells was annotated by the expression of classic markers of major cell types, including B cells ( CD19 MS4A1 CD79A CD3D CD3E CD3G XCL2 NKG7 GNLY CD68 CD33 CST3 HBQ1 HBM GYPA identification of malignant cells BCR V(D)J sequence assembly, SHM calculation, clonotype definition and integration with scRNA-seq data V(D)J sequencing data were obtained using Cell Ranger (v7.0.0) and annotated using Cell Ranger VDJ data (CellRanger ensembl vdj GRCh38 version 5.0.0). The filtered sequences and annotation results were used for downstream BCR analysis. The SHM of the IGHV region was calculated by shazam (v1.1.2). The V(D)J information was imported to matched scRNA-seq data using djvdj (v0.1.0) if the chain was classified by Cell Ranger as productive, full length, and with high confidence annotations and clonotypes with a paired heavy and light chain. A dominant clone in each sample was defined if the clonotype (same V gene, J gene, and CDR3 peptide) was expressed in more than 5% of the cells, while cells with different clonotypes were classified as polyclonal. Identification of malignant cells B cells were extracted and reclustered to infer malignant cells in each patient. First, in the patient-specific B-cell cohort, we used high-resolution clustering to further identify doublets of T and B cells by classic markers of B cells ( CD19 MS4A1 CD79A CD3E CD4 CD8A CCND1 CCND1 Inferring the cell cycle stage, developmental trajectory inference, and pathway enrichment Cell cycle progression was assessed using the CellCycleScoring function of the Seurat R package. To reconstruct the differentiation trajectory of malignant cells in individuals, we applied Monocle2 with default parameters to infer the pseudotemporal ordering of cells. For the pseudotime analysis, we selected the B cells at the earliest disease stage as the root of the trajectory. The GSVA score was calculated to estimate pathway activity based on the hallmark gene sets downloaded from the Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB) via the GSVA package. 75 , 76 Identification of expression programs An NMF-based method was used to determine the expression programs of malignant cells in each sample. First, cNMF was applied to the expression matrix (genes × cells) 100 times for different numbers of programs (2–10) for malignant cells from each sample. 77 Table S5 Quantification of similarity between samples The similarity index (SI) was used to quantify the similarity between two tumor samples from the same patient as described by Haebe et al. 46 Cell‒cell interactions We employed LIANA 78 44 , 79 p 42 , 43 , 45 Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and somatic alteration analysis For fresh-frozen tissue samples, genomic DNA from tumors and matched blood samples was extracted separately by using a DNeasy Tissue and Blood Kit (Qiagen). For the single-cell suspension MCL samples, FACS (CD19 + - Table S2 Sequencing reads that contained sequencing adapters, more than 10% unknown bases and low-quality bases (>50% bases with a base quality<5) were removed. Processed sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome (hg38) using Burrow-Wheeler Aligner software 80 81 82 To detect somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), five somatic mutation callers were used: Lancet v1.0.719, Strelka2 v2.9.220, MuSE v1.021, Mutect2 (GATK4.0.6) and SomaticSniper v1.0.5.03. 81 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 87 88 ATM 89 16 , 18 , 23 , 30 , 90 To detect large-scale variations, ascatNgs was used to determine copy number profiles 91 , 92 IGH-CCND1 93 , 94 To infer the clonal architecture among longitudinal samples, the CCF of each mutation was first estimated using ABSOLUTE, which was then utilized to infer clonal clusters using PyClone-VI. The clonal architecture was subsequently inferred by ClonEvol v0.99.11 50 73 Bulk transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) and analysis Transcriptome sequencing was performed on RNA extracted from MCL bulk tumors using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The libraries were prepared at Macrogen Europe and sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 platform. Sequencing reads were aligned to the reference human genome and transcriptome hg38 with HISAT2. FPKM was used to determine gene expression levels, and log2-transformed FPKM values were normalized to remove batch effects using the limma R package. 95 Immunohistochemical (IHC) and multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining Formalin-embedded paraffin-embedded (FFPE) MCL tissues and one multitissue microarray were analyzed for protein expression by IHC and mIF staining of 4 μm thick FFPE tissues. IHC staining and slide scanning were performed at the FoUU Clinical Pathology Service at Uppsala University Hospital as previously described. 66 FFPE sections were analyzed using mIF staining to assess the expression of key tumor and immune markers and their colocalization. Two separate mIF panels were used: panel 1: CD20, CCND1, CD70, CD27, CD4, and FOXP3; panel 2: CD20, CCND1, CD70, CD27, CD8, and PD-1. For each panel, tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval. Primary antibodies specific to the corresponding panel markers were applied, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody incubation and tyramide signal amplification. The slides were heated in a microwave after each secondary antibody incubation. The sections were also stained with 4′-6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma‒Aldrich) to label the nuclei. Staining was performed using a PANO 7-plex IHC kit (Panovue). The stained sections were scanned via an Olympus VS200 slide scanner in conjunction with an Olympus UPLXAP 20× objective lens. Autofluorescence was removed using OlyVIA software, and image analysis was performed using QuPath software. 72 CD70 knockout in the JVM2 cell line and MCL cell proliferation assay Three gRNAs targeting CD70 genomic loci were designed within a 100 bp frame to target exon 3 (sgRNA1-AGCCCGCAGGACGCACCCAT, sgRNA2-AGCGCTGGATGCACACCACG, and sgRNA3-CGCCGCGGCGAtGCCGGAGG) obtained at 60 μM and mixed with 20 μM recombinant Streptococcus pyogenes 5 − Quantification and statistical analysis Quantification and statistical analyses were performed using R v4.3.0. The Mann–Whitney U test (two-tailed) was used for comparisons between independent groups, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (two-tailed) was used for paired samples. Differences in OS between groups were assessed using the log rank test. For DEG analysis, p p p p p p References 1 Veloza L. Ribera-Cortada I. Campo E.
