However, the comprehensive impact of MPA on bladder cancer remains unclear. Our results demonstrate that MPA induces both ferroptosis and apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we employed integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Our analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are primarily implicated in the regulation of metabolism, inflammatory responses, and angiogenesis. Metabolomic profiling identified phosphocreatine, 2’-CMP, CDP, and others as differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs). Integrated analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) demonstrated that MPA significantly alters the metabolism of key compounds (GMP, phenol, glutathione, NAD+, cytosine) and regulates critical genes (tyrosine, LDHA, LDHB). Notably, the dysregulation of genes and metabolites associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related pathways may serve as a central mechanism by which MPA facilitates ferroptosis and apoptosis in bladder cancer.

Despite considerable advancements in early diagnostic methods in recent years, the overall prognosis remains dismal. The high recurrence rate and the complexities associated with treating metastatic bladder cancer continue to pose a substantial burden on global public health [ 4 5 Preliminary data indicate that MPA demonstrates anti-tumor activity, especially in metastatic tumors [ 6 8 9 11 12 15 16 17 Bladder cancer is closely associated with the reprogramming of various metabolic pathways, with metabolic reprogramming serving as a key driver of its initiation and progression. Similar to other cancer types, the hallmark of cancer is the profound alteration of critical metabolic pathways, including glucose metabolism and nucleotide metabolism [ 18 19 20 21 22 Recent studies have identified ferroptosis as a critical vulnerability in bladder cancer cells, particularly due to their high dependence on glutathione metabolism and iron homeostasis. The metabolic reprogramming in bladder cancer, including elevated polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) phospholipid synthesis and impaired antioxidant defenses, creates a unique susceptibility to ferroptosis induction [ 23 24 25 At present, transcriptomic and metabolomic approaches are utilized to evaluate the effects of MPA on bladder cancer. To further explore potential transcriptomic alterations, metabolic changes, and the underlying molecular mechanisms, we conducted a systems-level correlation network analysis integrating both omics datasets. The aim of this study is to identify key metabolites involved in MPA treatment of bladder cancer, ultimately providing novel and comprehensive insights into MPA-based therapeutic strategies for bladder cancer. Methodology Reagents and cell line cultures The 5637 and UMUC2 cell lines were sourced from the Chinese Cell Bank. Human bladder cancer cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, #31800-022) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The MPA concentrations used in this study (MCE, #HY-B0421) were established through prior dose-response experiments [ 26 Cell viability assay The CCK-8 assay kit (Beyotime, #C0038) was used to assess cell viability. 5637 and UMUC2 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After successful attachment, the cells were treated with MPA or Ferrostatin-1 (MCE, #HY-100579) for 24 h. After treatment, 10 µL of CCK-8 solution was added to each well, followed by a 1-hour incubation. The absorbance was then measured at 450 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Cells were fixed in a solution of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h, followed by post-fixation with 1% OsO4 for 6 h. Samples were dehydrated using a graded ethanol series for 15 min each, and then embedded in epoxy resin. Thin sections were mounted on copper grids (Sigma-Aldrich, TEM-74357) and stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 1% lead citrate. The samples were then dried and analyzed under a TEM (JEOL). Apoptosis and necrosis assay The Apoptosis and Necrosis Kit (Beyotime, #C1056) was equilibrated to room temperature. A total of 200,000 cells from each sample were collected and resuspended in 0.8-1 mL of staining buffer. Then, 5 µL of Hoechst and 5 µL of PI staining solutions were added, and the cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The red and blue fluorescence signals were subsequently monitored using a FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and cell populations were analyzed using BD FACSDiva software v8.0.1 (BD Biosciences). Transcriptomic analysis RNA integrity and concentration were evaluated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. PolyA-tailed mRNA was enriched by binding to Oligo magnetic beads, with the purified mRNA then fragmented into short fragments (~ 200–300 nt) in fragmentation buffer containing divalent cations under elevated temperature. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using the fragmented mRNA as templates, random hexamer primers, and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase, after which RNA strands were degraded by RNase H and second-strand cDNA was synthesized using DNA Polymerase I, with the resulting double-stranded cDNA purified, end-repaired, adenylated at the 3’ ends, and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters, followed by size selection of cDNA fragments (370–420 bp) using AMPure XP beads, PCR amplification, and final purification. The constructed libraries were quantified using Qubit 2.0 and diluted to 1.5 ng/µL, with insert size distribution verified by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and library concentration precisely determined via qRT-PCR (effective concentration > 2 nM), after which qualified libraries were pooled based on effective concentration and target sequencing depth for paired-end sequencing (150 bp) on the Illumina platform using Sequencing-by-Synthesis (SBS) technology, where fluorescently labeled dNTPs, DNA polymerase, and adapter primers were incorporated into the flowcell for real-time fluorescence capture and conversion of signals into sequence reads. Raw sequencing data were processed using FastQC (v0.11.9) for quality control, followed by adapter trimming using Cutadapt (v2.10) and alignment to the human reference genome (GRCh38) using HISAT2 (v2.2.1). Gene expression quantification was performed using featureCounts (v2.0.1), with differential expression analysis conducted using DESeq2 (v1.30.1) with adjusted p-value < 0.05 and |log2FC|>1 as significance thresholds. Metabolomic analysis Dried extracts were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile and filtered through a cellulose acetate. Metabolomics profiling was performed using a UPLC-ESI-Q-Orbitrap-MS system. LC separation was conducted on an ACQUITY UPLC ® Multivariate statistical analysis Multivariate statistical analysis was performed using R (version 4.3.1) with the following packages: pcaMethods (v1.94.0), ropls (v1.34.0), mixOmics (v6.24.0), pls (v2.8-1), ggplot2 (v3.4.2), and pheatmap (v1.0.12). Data preprocessing and Pareto scaling were conducted using pcaMethods, PCA and OPLS-DA analyses were performed with ropls, PLS-DA was implemented through mixOmics, model validation metrics were computed using pls, and all visualizations were generated with ggplot2 and pheatmap. Permutation testing (1000 iterations) confirmed model robustness, with perfect models demonstrating R² (cum) = 1 and Q² (cum) = 1. Permutation testing ensured that permuted models had lower R² and Q² values than non-permuted models. Discriminating metabolites were identified using OPLS-DA and variable importance in projection (VIP) scores, with values over 1 considered significant. VIP scores indicate the contribution of variables to sample classification. Statistically significant metabolites were selected based on VIP > 1.0 and p KEGG enrichment analysis KEGG pathway analysis was performed on differential metabolite data and differentially expressed genes using the KEGG database ( http://www.kegg.jp p Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0. Data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation from a minimum of three independent experiments. Comparisons between two groups were made using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test. Three or more groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s or Tukey’s post hoc multiple comparisons test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results MPA inhibits bladder cancer cell proliferation To explore the impact of the MPA inhibitor on bladder cancer cell proliferation, we performed a CCK-8 assay to evaluate the viability of 5637 (HTB-9) and UMUC2 (CRL-1748) cells after 24 h of MPA treatment. The UMUC2 cell line (CRL-1748) used in this study has been authenticated using STR profiling to ensure its identity and authenticity. Our results demonstrate that the MPA inhibitor significantly decreased the viability of both 5637 and UMUC2 cells at a concentration of 2.5 µM ( p 1  Fig. 1 CCK-8 absorbance results for 5637 and UMUC2 bladder cancer cells treated with varying concentrations of the MPA inhibitor. ( A B MPA-Induced ferroptosis and apoptosis in bladder cancer cells To further investigate the mechanism by which the MPA inhibitor affects bladder cancer cell growth, we performed TEM. The results showed significant morphological changes in the mitochondria after MPA treatment, including a reduction in mitochondrial cristae, mitochondrial shrinkage, and increased membrane density, indicating features associated with ferroptosis in the cells (Fig. 2 2 p 2 p p 2  Fig. 2 Effects of the MPA inhibitor on the normal function of 5637 and UMUC2 bladder cancer cells. ( A B C D MPA-Induced transcriptomic changes in bladder cancer To investigate the molecular mechanisms of ferroptosis and apoptosis induced by MPA in 5637 and UMUC2 cells, we performed transcriptomic sequencing on untreated and MPA-treated 5637 and UMUC2 cells. After correcting for sequencing depth and gene length, we found that the gene expression levels in the MPA-treated group were higher than those in the untreated group (Supplementary Fig. 1 1 3 3 3  Fig. 3 DEGs analysis in the transcriptomes of 5637 and UMUC2 cells treated with the MPA inhibitor. ( A B C To further explore the function of DEGs, we analyzed their distribution across chromosomes and annotated the gene types. As shown in the figure, the DEGs are primarily concentrated on chromosomes 1–22, indicating a widespread distribution of these genes. Additionally, the majority of the DEGs are coding genes, suggesting that they are mainly responsible for protein synthesis in the cell and play a role in regulating cellular functions and structures. This indicates that the DEGs are predominantly associated with fundamental physiological processes in the cell (Fig. 4 4 4 4 2  Fig. 4 Distribution and functional analysis of DEGs. ( A B C D E F G MPA-induced metabolic profile changes Since metabolic abnormalities are one of the critical aspects of DEGs in the transcriptomes of cells treated with MPA, we conducted a systematic analysis of all differentially abundant metabolites (DAMs) in MPA-treated cells using Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA). The results revealed a positive correlation between the metabolic differences and the distances between points on the OPLS-DA score plot. With the progression of MPA treatment, significant alterations were observed in the major biological components (Fig. 5 5 Furthermore, the OPLS-DA loadings plot revealed that in 5637 cells, the main metabolites based on VIP (Variable Importance in Prediction) values include 3-Keto-scyllo-inosamine, 2-Ethyl-3-hydroxy-2,4,4-trimethyloxazolidine, Dopachrome, 3’-Hydroxy-3,4,5,4’-tetramethoxystilbene, Perfluorobutanol, LysoPE, Xanthorin trimethyl ether (Fig. 5 5 To investigate the changes in the levels of key metabolites and their impact on relevant pathways following MPA treatment, we generated heatmaps and pathway bubble plots. The heatmap results revealed a distinct pattern of metabolite level alterations in MPA-treated 5637 cells. Some metabolites showed reduced levels, including 2-Hydroxy-3-(2-hydroxyphenyl) propanoic acid, (3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-furylmethyl) carboxamide, and kainic acid. In contrast, other metabolites exhibited increased levels, such as Echimidine N-oxide, LPG (18:2), and CDP (Fig. 6 6 6 6  Fig. 5 OPLS-DA analysis of metabolic changes in MPA-treated cells. ( A B C D E F  Fig. 6 Enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites. ( A B C D-H Integrated analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics To further investigate the mechanisms by which MPA promotes ferroptosis and apoptosis in bladder cancer cells, we integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics data to analyze the pathways commonly affected in 5637 and UMUC2 cells. A total of 101 significant pathways were identified (Fig. 7 7 To better elucidate the interactions between these pathways, we constructed a pathway-gene-metabolite network diagram, illustrating the regulatory relationships between pathways, genes, and metabolites. For example, hsa00230 influences hsa04022 and hsa04918 through the regulation of cAMP, GMP, and GUCY1A1, which in turn modulate the activity of hsa05208. hsa05208 further regulates the expression of key genes such as tyrosine, LDHA, and LDHB (Fig. 7  Fig. 7 Integrated analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics. ( A B C Revealing the mechanism of MPA-induced ferroptosis in bladder cancer cells from the perspectives of metabolomics and transcriptomics The integrated analysis of metabolomics and transcriptomics revealed one of the mechanisms by which MPA promotes ferroptosis and apoptosis in bladder cancer cells. ROS and metabolites such as tyrosine, along with genes like LDHA, LDHB, and others, are key factors or signature markers in the processes of ferroptosis and apoptosis. In the transcriptomic analysis, we identified DEGs associated with ROS-related pathways and ferroptosis and apoptosis pathways in both 5637 and UMUC2 cells, including NPPB, CAMK2G, TSPO, NGF, ADM, MALAT1, FOS, TUBB3, CXCL8, and NPPC (Fig. 8 8  Fig. 8 Differential analysis of metabolites and genes related to ferroptosis and apoptosis. ( A B C-H Discussion As an IMPDH inhibitor, MPA suppresses purine synthesis by inhibiting the activity of IMPDH, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of T cells and B cells and reducing the activity of the immune system. In recent years, MPA has garnered attention not only for its applications in immunosuppression but also as one of the focal points in cancer research due to its potential antitumor activity [ 27 28 29 30 31 9 7 32 34 26 Ferroptosis is a type of iron-dependent cell death mainly characterized by the buildup of lipid peroxides inside the cell, which eventually results in the rupture of the cell membrane [ 35 36 37 Metabolites such as ROS [ 38 39 40 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 The innovation of this study lies in the discovery that MPA not only induces apoptosis in 5637 and UMUC2 cells, but also triggers ferroptosis in these cells. Additionally, the potential mechanisms underlying MPA-induced ferroptosis and apoptosis in 5637 and UMUC2 cells are elucidated. Linking MPA to ferroptosis and apoptosis provides a novel perspective for its application in bladder cancer treatment. By exploring the detailed mechanisms through which MPA induces ferroptosis and apoptosis, this study not only deepens the understanding of MPA’s antitumor effects but also provides a theoretical foundation for the development of new strategies for ferroptosis and apoptosis induction. However, the study is limited by the use of a limited number of bladder cancer cell lines and the lack of patient validation. Therefore, future research is needed to validate the effects of MPA on metabolism and transcription in vivo, as well as to develop personalized treatment regimens. Conclusion This study reveals the antitumor potential of MPA inhibitors in bladder cancer cells through a comprehensive set of experiments, including cell viability assays, transcriptomic analysis, and metabolite profiling. MPA significantly alters the gene expression and metabolite profiles of the cells, which may have potential therapeutic implications for bladder cancer. These DEGs and metabolites provide valuable insights for further investigation into the anticancer mechanisms of MPA, as well as potential targets for precision therapy in bladder cancer. Furthermore, the in-depth exploration of MPA’s antitumor mechanisms using multi-omics technologies offers a more comprehensive theoretical foundation for its development as a cancer therapeutic agent.
