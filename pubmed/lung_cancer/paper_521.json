Although liver is considered an immunologically privileged organ among solid organ transplants ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 In contrast, machine learning (ML) algorithms—through automated feature extraction and nonlinear modeling—demonstrate superior prediction accuracy. Techniques such as gradient-boosted ensembles outperform conventional scoring systems in predicting perioperative TCMR and pneumonia occurrence by decoding complex clinical variable interactions. Compared to traditional scoring systems, ML models have shown promising performance in predicting outcomes across various solid organ transplantation ( 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 This study aims to develop and validate an ML-based predictive model for the co-occurrence of perioperative TCMR and pneumonia after LT. Ensemble algorithms and SHapley Additive exPlanations interpretability (SHAP) will be employed to identify nonlinear interactions and latent risk patterns that conventional methods may overlook, thereby addressing critical gaps in current prognostic frameworks. The clinical significance of this study lies in its potential to transform perioperative management strategies. With precise risk stratification, the established model could guide personalized therapeutic interventions, optimize surveillance protocols, inform immunosuppression regimen adjustments, and optimize the rational use of antimicrobial agents. These advances hold promise for reducing serious complications arising from perioperative TCMR and pneumonia after LT, thereby providing a basis for clinical decision-making. Methods Study cohort This retrospective study obtained clinical data from LT patients at the Institute of Transplantation Medicine, Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, between November 1, 2019, and June 1, 2025. All allografts originated from deceased donors, with allocation governed by the China Organ Transplant Response System. The study was conducted in accordance with both the Declarations of Helsinki and Istanbul and the study protocol was ratified by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital (Approval No.: 2019-(KY-0113)), and all participants provided informed consent. Inclusion criteria encompassed: (1) age ≥18 years at the time of primary deceased-donor allogeneic LT; (2) absence of active infection at transplantation: negative blood cultures within 48 hours preoperatively and no radiological evidence of infection; (3) normal preoperative immune status: CD4+ T-cell count ≥200/μL; (4) TCMR meeting either criterion: histologically confirmed per Banff 2023 criteria (biopsy-proven); clinical diagnosis: ALT/AST elevation ≥3× baseline and FK506 <5 ng/mL; (5) pneumonia diagnosis requiring: radiological confirmation and/or microbiological evidence; (6) co-occurrence requirement: TCMR and pneumonia diagnoses within the perioperative period and interval between TCMR and pneumonia ≤7 days; (7) availability of standardized postoperative follow-up data. Exclusion criteria encompassed: (1) combined multi-organ transplantation; (2) pre-existing structural lung disease or chronic respiratory failure; (3) active systemic infection at transplantation; (4) mortality or retransplantation within perioperative period (excluding cases caused by TCMR and pneumonia); (5) ABO-incompatible LT. In this study, the perioperative period was defined as 30 days after LT. Data collection The following information was retrospectively collected: (1) demographic parameters: gender; age; body mass index (BMI); blood type; (2) preoperative laboratory parameters: white blood cell (WBC) count; hemoglobin (Hb); platelet (PLT) count; neutrophil (NEUT) count; lymphocyte (LYM) count; creatine kinase (CK); creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB); procalcitonin (PCT); C-reactive protein (CRP); total cholesterol (TC); triglyceride (TG); high-density lipoprotein (HDL); low-density lipoprotein (LDL); serum creatinine (SCr); blood urea nitrogen (BUN); uric acid (UA); cystatin C (Cys C); CD4+ T-lymphocyte (CD4+) count; CD8+ T-lymphocyte (CD8+) count; B cell (BC) count; natural killer cell (NK) count; K + + + 2+ 2+ 2 2 2 2 2 2 Statistical analysis All data were processed and visualized in the R statistical computing environment 4.4.0. The ggplot2 package was utilized for graphical representations. Two-tailed analyses were utilized for hypothesis testing, with P<0.05 implying statistical significance. The normality of continuous variables was determined via the Shapiro-Wilk test. Variables in normal distribution were depicted as mean ± standard deviation (SD), while non-normally distributed variables were depicted as median (interquartile range [IQR]) and compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical data were reported as frequencies (percentages), and pairwise comparisons were performed via Pearson’s χ² test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. For variables exceeding the predetermined 20% missingness threshold, imputation was performed using the Random Forest algorithm within the Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) package (v3.16.2). Feature variable screening LASSO regression identified significant predictors between clinical characteristics of LT recipients and the perioperative co-occurrence of TCMR and pneumonia following LT. The iterative analysis was conducted via a 10-fold cross-validation method, λ-min (minimum lambda): 0.01906806. Variables with statistical significance ( P Development and evaluation of predictive models Predictive models were constructed for perioperative co-occurrence of TCMR and pneumonia after LT (binary outcome: 1=co-occurrence, 0=no co-occurrence). Five classical ML algorithms were implemented: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The cohort was randomly stratified into training (70%) and test (30%) sets. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves assessed model performance, with the AUC and 95% CI reckoned to quantify discrimination accuracy. The optimal diagnostic cutoff was identified by the Youden index (J=sensitivity + specificity – 1), from which corresponding sensitivity and specificity values were derived. The calibration curve was implemented to estimate high agreement between the predicted and observed risks. Model performance was additionally evaluated using specificity, sensitivity, F1-score, and recall rate. Comparative analysis of these metrics across all algorithms was made to identify the optimal model for subsequent clinical assessment. Interpretability analysis A swarm plot was created using the SHAP method to present the individual contribution of each feature to the prediction. SHAP evaluations revealed the degree to which each feature influenced specific samples, thereby elucidating the model’s decision-making procedures. Ultimately, feature recursive elimination was utilized to screen variables to simplify the model. Results Clinical characteristics This study enrolled 717 patients who underwent LT, including 600 males (83.7%) and 117 females (16.3%). Based on perioperative co-occurrence of TCMR and pneumonia after LT, patients were allocated into a co-occurrence group (93 cases) and a no co-occurrence group (624 cases). Biopsy-proven TCMR: 56 cases (accounting for 60.2% of total TCMR cases); clinically diagnosed TCMR: 37 cases (accounting for 39.8% of total TCMR cases).

Model performance assessment To determine the optimal model for predicting perioperative co-occurrence TCMR and pneumonia, five distinct algorithms were compared. The predictive power of these models was comprehensively evaluated via ROC curves and AUC values. Results demonstrated that the SVM model consistently achieved superior AUC values of 0.881 (95% CI: 0.83–0.93) in the training dataset and 0.786 (95% CI: 0.69–0.88) in the test dataset, outperforming all other models (  Figures 2A, B  Table 2  Figures 3A, B Figure 2 Receiver operating characteristic curves for the five models.

Discussion Accurate prediction of risk factors for perioperative co-occurrence TCMR and pneumonia following LT is critical for timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study focused on recipients undergoing LT and validated a predictive model for assessing the simultaneous occurrence of TCMR and pneumonia during the perioperative period. The model integrated preoperative clinical characteristics, immunological interventions, dynamic changes in surgical parameters, preoperative concurrent symptoms, postoperative clinical characteristics, and donor information utilizing multiple ML algorithms. Comparative analysis of ML models revealed that the SVM algorithm achieved the optimal predictive accuracy, with AUC values of 0.881 (95% CI: 0.83–0.93) in the training set and 0.786 (95% CI: 0.69–0.88) in the test set. Calibration demonstrated high predicted-observed risk concordance. Furthermore, the SVM model demonstrated a high specificity, sensitivity, and F1 score. These findings indicate that ML models incorporating recipient-specific multidimensional data can effectively stratify perioperative co-occurrence TCMR and pneumonia, offering actionable insights for optimizing clinical decision-making and postoperative management. The comparative analysis demonstrated the substantial advantage of ML models in prediction tasks ( 15 20 21 22 23 17 18 + As the most critical predictor in this model, the blood concentration of FK506 is paramount for preventing graft rejection and reducing the risk of infection, particularly pneumonia ( 24 25 5 26 27 28 29 27 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 This paper demonstrated that ML models could predict perioperative co-occurrence TCMR and pneumonia following LT. ML models exhibit superior abilities to capture complex, non-linear relationships and intricate interactions among clinical variables compared to traditional methods, thus offering valuable insights into individual patient risk profiles. This information can potentially inform personalized treatment strategies, optimize post-LT surveillance protocols, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Clinical significance The machine learning-based multidimensional prediction model (utilizing the SVM algorithm) developed and validated in this study holds paramount clinical value by providing a robust tool for the precise prevention and individualized management of TCMR-pneumonia comorbidity during the perioperative period following LT. Upon successful integration into the hospital’s electronic medical record (EMR) system as a clinical decision support system, this model empowers clinicians to implement preemptive alerts, accurate diagnosis, and early personalized interventions for high-risk patients. This effectively disrupts the vicious cycle of TCMR-pneumonia comorbidity, ultimately improving the prognosis of LT recipients and substantially alleviating familial and societal burdens. These outcomes demonstrate the transformative potential of AI-driven precision medicine in managing complex postoperative complications. Real-time risk surveillance and early warning: the model’s core strength lies in its integration of critical, dynamically changing clinical indicators. Once deployed, the system automatically and continuously retrieves real-time data from the EMR, including: dynamic monitoring of FK506 blood concentration, dynamic assessment of immune cell function, dynamic evolution of liver function and coagulation parameters, surgical parameter retrospectives, and ICU length of stay. This dynamic data continuously updates risk assessments. Risk stratification based on predictive modeling: leveraging the integrated SVM algorithm, the system comprehensively analyzes the aforementioned real-time multidimensional data to compute an individualized risk score for current TCMR-pneumonia comorbidity occurrence. Patients are then automatically stratified into predefined risk tiers based on preset thresholds. Early identification and targeted intervention for high-risk patients: the explicit early-warning signals provided by the system offer clinicians precise diagnostic directionality. These alerts heighten clinical vigilance regarding potential comorbidity, prompting physicians to combine model outputs with specific patient presentations and necessary ancillary tests for accurate diagnosis at the disease’s earliest stage. Early diagnosis is prerequisite for effective intervention; for TCMR, warnings enable prompt judicious adjustment of immunosuppressive regimens. Limitations There are also limitations. The single-center retrospective design may introduce selection bias, despite efforts to adjust for known confounders through multivariate analysis. Additionally, the primary limitation of this study is the absence of external validation on an independent, multi-center, large-scale cohort. This constraint impedes comprehensive assessment of our model’s generalizability at this stage and its immediate clinical applicability. Conclusions This study developed a robust predictive model for perioperative co-occurrence TCMR and pneumonia in LT, and the SVM model achieved superior discriminative performance.
