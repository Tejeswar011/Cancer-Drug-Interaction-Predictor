Summary Current T cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies show limited success in treating solid tumors due to insufficient dendritic cell (DC) activity, particularly cross-presenting conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s).

While CAR-T therapies have yielded remarkable success against hematologic malignancies, their efficacy in solid tumors remains limited by these issues. 1 , 2 Specifically, FX-armed T cells exhibited increased production of IFNγ by T cells and IL-12 by DCs, two key cytokines that synergistically drive AS and amplify immune responses. 17 54 + + 45 45 12 55 Further analysis of Mono/Mac populations showed that CD40 signaling was not restricted to DCs.

Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this model. Most humanized mice lack fully functional LNs, which are essential for initiating immune responses. Moreover, immune dysfunction in cancer patients often extends beyond the TME, involving systemic defects such as impaired DC activity across tissues. 58 18 , 19 , 20 In summary, our findings suggest that FX engineering offers a promising approach for addressing the limitations of conventional CAR-T therapies in solid tumors. By promoting the quantity and quality of DCs, FX-armed T cells enhance AS and broaden the immune response, offering a potential solution to tumor heterogeneity. Future research should explore the clinical potential of this strategy, including integrating synthetic Notch (synNotch) receptors to enable precise intratumoral delivery of immunostimulatory molecules, as well as combining FX-armed T cells with immune adjuvants or cancer vaccines to further enhance therapeutic efficacy in solid tumors. Limitations of the study This study highlights the therapeutic promise of FX-engineered T cells, yet several limitations must be considered. The humanized mouse models employed lack fully functional LNs, compromising accurate assessment of immune activation. Moreover, experimental conditions may not fully recapitulate the systemic immune dysfunction observed in cancer patients, such as defective DC activity. Although combining FX-armed T cells with adjuvants or cancer vaccines is proposed for poorly immunogenic tumors, their optimization and clinical feasibility remain untested. Additionally, the precise mechanisms by which DC-T cell interactions, particularly those involving cDC1s, support the maintenance of the Tpex subset require further investigation. Lastly, pooling cells from seven mice per group for single-cell sequencing limited statistical analysis.

All mice were housed under standard conditions in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility, and were examined daily. All tumor burdens remained within the standards permitted by the IACUC of Suzhou Institute of Systems Medicine (not exceeding 1500 mm 3 Mice Wild-type female C57BL/6N mice (6 weeks, CD45.2) were purchased from Vital River Co, Ltd (Beijing, China). CD45.1 and CD45.1/CD45.2 OT-I TCR transgenic mice on a C57BL/6 background, and were generated by crossing OT-I mice to CD45.1 or CD45.2 mice. For some experiments, Tcf7-DTR-GFP Tcf7-DTR-GFP Batf3 −/− Rag1 −/− em1Cd3259 Cell lines HEK293T and B16F10 cell lines were purchased from ATCC. B16-OVA and A375 cell lines were provided by Prof. Bo Huang. MC38 and PC3 cell lines were sourced from our laboratory. B16F10 was transduced with lentivirus to express murine XCL1 (B16-XCL1), human CD19 extracellular domain (B16F10-CD19) or B7-H3 extracellular domain (B16F10-B7-H3). B16F10-Vector, B16F10-XCL1, B16F10-CD19, B16F10-B7-H3, and B16-OVA were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. MC38 was transduced to express ovalbumin (MC38-OVA) or murine XCL1 (MC38-XCL1). MC38, MC38-OVA, and MC38-XCL1 were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. A375 cells were transduced to express B7-H3 extracellular domain, termed A375-B7-H3. A375-B7-H3 and PC3 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. All the above reagents were purchased from Gibco. All cell lines were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2, and the cell lines used in the experiments were checked regularly for contamination with Mycoplasma using RT-qPCR. Method details Generation of mouse and human viral plasmid constructs All plasmid constructs were generated by overlap extension PCR (Vazyme, P520-02) and recombinant gene expression cloning into the pLV-EF1a-puro lentiviral or MSGV retroviral vector. Murine XCL1, human CD19, and B7-H3 extracellular domain as well as luciferase cDNA were integrated into a pLV-EF1a-puro vector to construct stable gene-expressing tumor cell lines. To generate mouse T cell co-expressing Flt3L and XCL1, murine XCL1 and Flt3L cDNA were linked by a self-cleaving P2A sequence integrated into pMSGV-Thy1.1 retroviral vector. Construction of mouse and human CARs Murine and human CAR constructs targeting CD19 or B7-H3 were generated as previously described. 59 Flt3l Xcl1 Flt3l Xcl1 FLT3LG XCL1 FLT3LG XCL1 Figures 7 Retrovirus and lentivirus production To generate retroviral particles, HEK293T cells were transfected with a mixture of plasmids, including the retroviral transfer vector (pMSGV for transducing mouse T cell or pRetroX for transducing human T cell) and the envelope plasmids. In detail, 3×10 6 Generation of gene-expressing tumor cell lines Tumor cell lines stably expressing control or target genes were generated by lentiviral transduction. In brief, cells were seeded into 6-well plates and cultured for 12 h to reach approximately 60% confluency. Lentiviral supernatants encoding the target gene were then added in the presence of 10 μg/mL polybrene (Santa Cruz) to enhance transduction efficiency, and cells were incubated for an additional 12 h. After transduction, the medium was replaced with pre-warmed complete culture medium supplemented with puromycin (Roche) for selection (4 μg/mL for MC38 cells, 8 μg/mL for B16F10 and A375 cells). Positively transduced cell clones were enriched and expanded for subsequent experiments. Primary mouse T cell isolation and transduction Naive CD8 T cells were purified using the Mouse CD8 Naive T cell Isolated Kit (MojoSort, Biolegend) from spleen of CD45.1 OT-I mice (6–12 weeks) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco) containing 10% FBS (Hyclone), 2 mM glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM Pyruvate (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES(Gibco), 1×NEAA (Gibco), 100 units Penicillin-Streptomycin (Hyclone) and 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). For naive T cell activation, 48-well plates were precoated with 250 μL of αCD3 (2 μg/mL, Invitrogen) and αCD28 (1 μg/mL, Invitrogen) at 4°C for overnight. Cells were cultured at 1×10 6 g 2 Generation of human CAR T cells Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers were isolated by using Ficoll-PaquePLUS (GE Healthcare) and seeded onto precoated 12-well plates with 1.5 μg/mL αCD3 (Biolegend) for 48 h. PBMC were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM Pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, 1×NEAA, 100 units Penicillin-Streptomycin, 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, hIL-2 (3  ng/mL, Peprotech), and αCD28 (1 μg/mL, BioLegend). After 48 h of activation, T cells were transduced with CAR retrovirus supernatants on RetroNectin-coated 24-well plates (0.1 mg/mL) in the presence of polybrene (8 μg/mL), hIL-2 (3 ng/mL), and αCD28 (1 μg/mL). The plates were centrifugated at 2000 g 2 Cytotoxicity assay of mouse and human CAR T cells CAR-T cells cytotoxicity was assessed by the Bright-Lite Luciferase Assay System (Vazyme) with B16F10-B7-H3-luc cells (1×10 4 Flow cytometry Single-cell suspensions from spleens, Lymph nodes, or tumor tissues were prepared. 1-2×10 6 TM + + + + − + + − − − + + + + − − − + + + − + + − − − + + − + + − − + + + TM Animal experiments model Mice were subcutaneously injected with 5 × 10 5 5 6 Batf3 −/− Rag1 −/− 6 5 3 i.v. 6 6 i.v. 6 Humanized mouse tumor model For the in vivo 6 6 3 6 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis The protein expression of XCL1 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The XCL1 antibody (2 μg/mL, R&D) was coated to the bottom of the wells of a microplate and incubated overnight at 4°C. Supernatants from B16F10-Vector, B16F10-XCL1, MC38-Vector, MC38-XCL1, OT-I/Vector, OT-I/XCL1, B7-H3 CAR T, B7-H3 CAR-FX T cells were added to the wells for 2 h at room temperature. Then, mouse XCL1/Lymphotactin biotin antibody (0.2 μg/mL, R&D) was added to the wells for 1 h, followed by washing and reaction with Avidin-HRP (Invitrogen) for 30 min.

Sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, then permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100, and blocked with PBS containing 5% Bovine serum albumin (BSA), followed by staining with unconjugated primary antibodies, which were diluted using immunofluorescence antibodies dilution buffer (CST, 12378) overnight at 4°C. Fluorescent conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated for 2–3 h at room temperature in a dark humidified chamber. Sections were washed 3 times with PBS between each staining step. The following antibodies were used for staining: anti-CD8α (Abcam, ab217344), anti-XCL1 (R&D, AF486-SP), anti-CD11c (Abcam, ab254183). Images were captured with PanoVIEW VS200, and the images were analyzed with Olympus Stream software.

RT-PCR was performed with SYBR green Master Mix (Vazyme, Q311-00) on Roche LC480. The sequences of primers used were listed. The primers for mouse B2m Tcf7 Xcl1 TCGA survival analysis and hazard ratio estimation To excluded potential confounding from Bulk-RNA seq datasets, we constructed a Cox proportional hazards model allowing dynamic interaction to evaluate survival risk, specified as: ‘logh(t) = logh_0 (t) + β_1⋅XCL1 + β_2⋅CD8B + β_3⋅(XCL1 × CD8B) + β_4⋅NCAM1’. Survival analysis was performed using the ‘survival’ package (Terry M. Therneau, Patricia M. Grambsch (2000)) and results were visualized with ‘survminer’ package (Kassambara A, Kosinski M, Biecek P(2021)). Specifically, we obtained transcriptomic data of tumors from TCGA. To determine the impact of gene A on tumor progression, we first calculated the median expression of gene A across all samples. Based on this, samples were categorized into high and low gene A expression groups. A survival object was created using the ‘Surv’ function and survival analysis was performed using the ‘survfit’ function. When assessing the combined effect of multiple genes on tumor progression, the gene expression levels were multiplied. The effect of differential expression of gene A affects cancer prognosis based on the hazard ratio (HR).
