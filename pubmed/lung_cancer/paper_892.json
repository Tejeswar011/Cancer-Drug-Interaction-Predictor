Alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells are central to lung repair and regeneration and play a vital role in maintaining lung homeostasis. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing AT2 cell fate during different stages of lung injury and repair remain incompletely understood. This review delves into the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of AT2 cells, highlighting their dynamic behavior in response to lung injury. We explore the pivotal role of AT2 cells across various stages of inflammation, repair, and fibrosis and discuss how these processes are influenced by factors such as aging, mechanical stress, and interactions within the alveolar microenvironment. This review also emphasizes the importance of integrating spatiotemporal multiomics approaches to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying AT2 cell function and their potential therapeutic applications. Furthermore, we discuss novel strategies for enhancing the regenerative capacity of AT2 cells through targeted delivery systems, including protein, gene, and mitochondrial therapies. By advancing our understanding of AT2 cell biology and improving therapeutic approaches, we aim to pave the way for more effective treatments for lung injury diseases, particularly ALI and ARDS.

Patients with severe trauma and other critical diseases often suffer from acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [ 1 2 3 4 3 5 Although studies have shown that multiple types of lung stem progenitor cells can mediate the regenerative repair of lung tissue after the onset of ALI [ 6 7 8 9 8 10 In the distal trachea, in addition to BASCs, other lung stem progenitors have been reported.

The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of AT2 cells during lung development and the maintenance of lung homeostasis and after lung injury reflects the heterogeneity of their repair capacity. The repair ability of AT2 cells directly affects the prognosis of ALI/ARDS patients [ 6 Review Temporal heterogeneity of AT2 cells The fate and function of AT2 cells are profoundly influenced by temporal factors, particularly in the context of lung injury and repair. These temporal variations are shaped by two primary factors: the different time stages following injury and the age of the individual at the time of injury. The specific timing after injury determines how AT2 cells respond and transition through phases of inflammation, repair, and fibrosis, while the age of the individual introduces additional complexity, as the regenerative capacity of AT2 cells diminishes with age. Together, these factors create a dynamic landscape in which the behavior and regulatory mechanisms of AT2 cells vary significantly over time, underscoring the importance of understanding these temporal dimensions to develop more effective treatments for lung injury and disease. The fate of AT2 cells in different stages of lung injury, repair, and fibrosis After lung injury, AT2 cells undergo distinct phases—characterized by inflammation, repair, and fibrosis—each influencing their function and destiny. Our group’s study in a mouse ALI model revealed that lung homogenates between 3 and 7 days postinjury had different effects on AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation, respectively [ 26 Figure 1 Figure 1 Temporal heterogeneity of AT2 cells during lung injury, repair, and fibrosis. ( a b c AT2 TRM CCL2 CD200R BMP TGF-β IL-1β EGF Areg Immunomodulation by AT2 cells during inflammation AT2 cells play a critical role in maintaining lung immune homeostasis by balancing suppressive and proinflammatory signals. For example, CD200–CD200R signaling initiates anti-inflammatory responses [ 27 28 29 29 30 31 A subset of AT2 cells with low SP-C and high MHC-II expression act as antigen-presenting cells [ 32 + + + 33 + 33 Proliferation and differentiation in repair AT2 cell fate during lung repair is governed by a network of signaling pathways. Initially, AT2 cells proliferate to maintain stemness; later, they differentiate into AT1 cells, which are essential for alveolar structure and air–blood barrier restoration. Wnt signaling is critical, with increased Wnt production postinjury driving AT2 cell proliferation through autocrine signaling. Lineage-tracing and AT2-specific gene-deficient mouse studies highlight the importance of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in AT2 cell proliferation, while β-catenin knockdown triggers AT1 cell differentiation [ 22 34 The Notch signaling pathway also plays a key role in lung repair. In an ALI mouse model induced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa 35 36 These pathways regulate AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation by modulating gene expression, typically reducing proliferation signals and increasing differentiation signals. However, transcription factors such as Tfcp2l1 do not adhere to simple temporal patterns, complicating the regulatory process. Morrisey’s team reported that the grainyhead transcription factor cellular promoter 2-like 1 (Tfcp2l1) differentially regulates AT2 cell fate across injury stages—suppressing AT2 proliferation early (Day 10) but promoting AT2 cell proliferation and differentiation into AT1 cells later (Day 14) [ 23 37 38 39 40 41 42 Transitional states and fibrosis AT2 cells in various lung injury models exhibit transitional states during repair, a normal phenomenon that can predict poor outcomes if persistent [ 37 42–46 47 44 46 Choi et al. [ 37 37 38 48 49 49 Kobayashi’s work showed that AT2 cells enter a transitional state called PATS before maturing into AT1 cells, with these cells being more sensitive to DNA damage due to stretching during differentiation [ 50 42 47 51 52 47 53 54 Recent studies have shown that the transitional states of AT2 cells observed in mice also occur in human lung tissues [ 44 55 + 45 56 + 46 Even more concerning is that transitional AT2 cells actively contribute to the progression of fibrosis. Wang et al. reported that the persistence of transitional AT2 cells through a Krt8-dependent mechanism leads to refractory fibrosis by regulating chemokine expression and macrophage recruitment, thereby reinforcing fibrogenesis [ 46 57 58 59 In addition to their roles mentioned above, AT2 cells are crucial for alveolar liquid clearance (ALC) by regulating ENaC and Na-K-ATPase, which mediate sodium transport and fluid removal [ 60 61 The fate of AT2 cells in aging lung Lung tissue repair capacity declines markedly with age, leading to worse outcomes in elderly patients with lung injury, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic and in animal models where aged mice exhibit higher mortality, greater fibrosis, and impaired alveolar regeneration [ 62–66 67 68 69 70 69 70 71 Figure 2 Figure 2 Intrinsic and extrinsic factors regulating AT2 cell fate in aging lungs. This figure highlights the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence AT2 cell fate and repair capacity in aging lungs. Intrinsic factors include telomere dysfunction and metabolic dysregulation. Telomere dysfunction, along with DNA damage, occurs when telomeres uncap, driven by FBW7-mediated degradation of TPP1, leading to cellular senescence. Metabolic dysregulation, particularly inactivation of the AMPKPFKFB2 pathway, impairs glycolysis and promotes the formation of transitional AT2 cells, limiting their ability to differentiate and self-renew. Extrinsic factors include mechanical stress and changes in the alveolar microenvironment. Mechanical stress, caused by ECM remodeling and increased tissue stiffness, disrupts the Cdc42–YAP signaling axis, worsening alveolar remodeling and fibrosis in aging lungs. Additionally, the secretion of growth factors such as Wnt and Pdgfr is reduced in senescent fibroblasts (expressing p16INK4a), and aged immune cells (regulatory T cells and macrophages) further impair the regenerative capacity of AT2 cells. Collectively, these factors contribute to diminished lung repair and increased fibrosis in the aging lung. AT2 FBW7 TPP1 AMPK PFKFB2 Krt8 Cdc42 YAP PDGFA p16INK4a ECM Telomere instability plays a critical role in AT2 cell aging. Specifically, FBW7-mediated degradation of telomere protection protein 1 (TPP1) leads to telomere uncapping, triggering DNA damage and cellular senescence, ultimately promoting fibrosis [ 40 72 73 + 74–77 Beyond intrinsic aging, the alveolar niche—comprising mesenchymal and immune cells—also regulates AT2 cell fate. Mesenchymal–epithelial interactions are vital for stem cell maintenance and are modulated by growth factors [ 78 79 80 INK4a 81–83 84 INK4a+ 85–87 66 88 89 Mechanical stress, increasingly prominent in aged lungs due to ECM remodeling [ 76 90 91 92 42 93 93 94 Senescence, whether due to injury or natural aging, reduces AT2 cell repair capacity [ 95 Improving our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern AT2 cell fate across different temporal dimensions, coupled with the identification of precise molecular markers linked to regeneration, is essential for refining our grasp of human alveolar regeneration. Future research should leverage big data analysis to integrate the diverse regulatory mechanisms of AT2 cell fate over time, potentially laying the groundwork for a fundamental theory of lung injury repair. This knowledge could revolutionize therapeutic strategies for ALI, improve prognostic accuracy, and guide clinical management decisions for patients at various stages of lung injury. Spatial heterogeneity of AT2 cells Respiratory diseases impact various parts of the respiratory system, including the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli, with epithelial progenitor cells from different regions playing key roles in maintaining and repairing the epithelial layer under diverse conditions. Basal cells act as lung epithelial stem cells, rapidly proliferating and differentiating to restore the damaged epithelial layer of the trachea and bronchi [ 96–98 99–101 7 102 Repair capacity of different regions of the alveoli The alveolar region in ALI patients suffers significant epithelial damage, making the repair of alveolar epithelial cells crucial. The regenerative ability of AT2 cells, the primary seed cells in the alveoli [ 7 24 Recent studies have shown that AT2 cell origins may differ by region postinjury. While traditionally believed to arise from AT2 cells themselves [ 7 22 10 12 13 10 11 The repair process in the alveolar region does not rely solely on AT2 cells; seed cells from other regions, such as bronchial basal cells, also contribute under certain conditions [ 10 11 78 7 22 11 15 103 103 94 11 Our team reported that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) in the post-ALI microenvironment stimulated the growth of specific AT2 cell subpopulations [ 104 + + + + 104 The regulatory role of spatial heterogeneity of mechanical tension on AT2 cell repair capacity Mechanical tension in the lungs is unevenly distributed due to the structure of the lung and the influence of gravity, with alveoli at the periphery being more likely to be stretched. Tang et al. [ 42 105 However, proper mechanical stress was found to be one of the key factors in initiating alveolar regeneration. Increased mechanical tension in the alveolar epithelium, triggered by respiration following lung resection, promotes actin polymerization and YAP-dependent cell proliferation in AT2 cells [ 93 106 107 However, further exploration is needed to determine the boundaries for assessing the advantages and disadvantages of mechanical stress in regulating the repair function of AT2 cells. Identifying an endogenous indicator of the mechanical tension response within AT2 cells may be essential. Cdc42 is currently recognized as a crucial molecule in the response to mechanical tension, although the specific threshold for its role remains unclear. In vitro 42 93 Influence of the spatial distribution discrepancies of other lung tissue cells on AT2 cell repair capacity AT2 cells do not act in isolation but are embedded in a complex microenvironment that includes immune and stromal cell types, which dynamically interact to regulate lung homeostasis and repair. Fibroblasts, macrophages, and Treg cells play crucial roles in regulating AT2 cell fate, with evidence suggesting that these effects are influenced by their spatial positioning within the lung [ 25 108 109 110 + + 111 + + + 112 + 113 114 Macrophages are also essential in lung injury responses, and their interaction with AT2 cells is crucial for determining their fate. Interstitial macrophages influence AT2 cell destiny by secreting IL-1β, whereas AT2 cells, in turn, influence AT2 cells through the release of CCL2, promoting AT2 cell proliferation [ 37 115 116 117 In the lung injury microenvironment, the spatial arrangement of immune and stromal cells—such as alveolar and interstitial macrophages, Tregs, and fibroblasts—plays a pivotal role in regulating AT2 cell function. Direct interactions and paracrine signaling are heavily influenced by spatial proximity, yet our understanding of these spatially governed regulatory networks remains incomplete ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Spatial heterogeneity of AT2 cells in lung repair and regeneration. Spatial heterogeneity significantly impacts AT2 cell function across different regions of the lung. ( a b c AT2 FGFR2 BASC ROS FasL TGF-β CX43 Pdgfr EMT Spatiotemporal multiomics resolution of heterogeneity in the repair capacity of AT2 cells Single-cell spatial multiomics technology provides a powerful approach for deciphering the molecular landscape of AT2 cells and their microenvironment during tissue repair and regeneration [ 118 119 118 120 121 This integrated approach uncovers spatially resolved gene expression dynamics and intercellular communication networks that regulate AT2 cell repair abilities [ 119 112 122–124 Spatiotemporal multiomics studies of lung development Pioneering work by Ljungberg et al. [ 125 in situ Building on this foundation, He et al. [ 94 in situ 126 127 in situ Many research teams utilizing scRNA-seq technology have consistently shown that the gene expression pattern of AT2 cells at E18.5 closely resembles that in adult mice, indicating that AT2 cells are largely developed at this stage [ 128 94 129 102 130 These studies provide a comprehensive spatiotemporal atlas of human lung development, highlighting key mechanisms of AT2 cell fate and epithelial differentiation. Understanding these developmental processes is essential for advancing regenerative medicine, as early-stage stem cells possess unique therapeutic potential owing to their increased stemness and self-renewal capabilities. This knowledge is critical for developing future therapies to repair lung tissue in pulmonary diseases. Spatiotemporal multiomics studies of lung injury Spatiotemporal multiomics approaches are now essential for studying lung injury, particularly for understanding the roles of AT2 cells in repair and regeneration. These methods allow for an integrated analysis of temporal and spatial factors, offering a comprehensive view of how lung tissue and AT2 cells evolve postinjury. While earlier studies relied on techniques such as in situ 131 For example, Boyd’s group [ 124 132 The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated spatial omics research, with studies such as Butler et al. [ 133 134 While these studies have advanced our understanding of the inflammatory response, repair studies, particularly after lung injury, have largely focused on fibrosis mechanisms. Murthy’s group [ 56 135 − + AT2 cells are essential for lung repair and regeneration and maintaining lung homeostasis. However, the mechanisms regulating their function and interactions during injury and repair are not fully understood. Spatiotemporal multiomics studies are crucial for uncovering these mechanisms, providing insights for developing new therapeutic strategies. By integrating spatial proteomics and metabolomics with transcriptomic data, researchers can achieve a deeper understanding of protein dynamics and metabolic processes in lung repair. For example, recent studies have shown that glycogen utilization is crucial in the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts within fibrotic lung regions [ 136 New strategies and methods to increase the endogenous regenerative capacity of AT2 cells Current therapeutic approaches for ALI and ARDS have shown limited effectiveness, prompting a focus on developing treatments that actively promote lung repair. Given the key role of AT2 cells in this process, they have become central to targeted therapeutic strategies. The primary challenge lies in developing delivery systems that can precisely target the lungs, specifically AT2 cells. Researchers have explored various platforms, including microvesicles [ 137 138 139–141 142 143 144 145 One effective approach is protein delivery systems. For example, Wnt3a has been shown to promote AT2 cell proliferation, which is crucial for lung repair. However, its hydrophobic nature limits its therapeutic application. Researchers have developed a novel approach using extracellular vesicles (EVs) to deliver Wnt3a, maintaining its biological activity and demonstrating significant therapeutic effects in lung injury models. Wnt3a-loaded EVs improved lung function, reduced abnormal alveolar structures, and promoted AT2 cell regeneration. However, the role of Wnt3a in fibroblast proliferation postinjury complicates its use, highlighting the need for selective targeting. This challenge is also relevant to other growth factors, such as EGF and FGF. Consequently, research has focused on protein delivery systems with enhanced specificity for AT2 cells. For example, targeting pathological markers such as CD38 on AT2 cells with engineered mesenchymal stem cell-derived EVs has shown promise in reversing epithelial–mesenchymal transition and reducing age-related pulmonary fibrosis by restoring NAD+ levels in senescent AT2 cells. Gene therapy approaches are also advancing, with mRNA and CRISPR technologies leading the way. The stability and safety of mRNAs, as recognized by the 2023 Nobel Prize, make them a preferred choice [ 146 139 CRISPR-Cas9 technology offers another powerful tool, especially for treating genetic lung diseases through precise gene editing. Viral delivery systems, such as AAV6.2FF, have shown high efficiency in targeting AT2 cells [ 144 145 140 141 141 145 In addition to protein and gene delivery systems, mitochondrial replacement therapy is emerging as a promising strategy, particularly for conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis. By engineering mesenchymal stem cells, researchers have developed methods for efficient mitochondrial transfer, restoring the function of damaged lung cells. This approach offers a novel therapeutic avenue for reversing pulmonary fibrosis and other related lung diseases [ 147 148 In conclusion, advancements in protein, gene, and mitochondrial delivery systems present promising avenues for lung repair and regeneration, particularly through the targeting of AT2 cells ( Figure 4 149 150 140 151 152 Figure 4 Therapeutic strategies for lung repair targeting AT2 cells. This figure illustrates various therapeutic strategies aimed at promoting lung repair by targeting AT2 cells. ( a b c AT2 MSC CRISPR AAV LNPs BMP4 CYB5R3 CX43 Mito-MEN Parkin mRNA Conclusions In conclusion, AT2 cells are central to lung repair and regeneration and play a pivotal role in addressing ALI and ARDS. Their regenerative capabilities are influenced by spatial heterogeneity and temporal dynamics, yet the mechanisms governing their fate and behavior remain poorly understood. Recent advances in spatiotemporal multiomics and other cutting-edge technologies have significantly expanded our comprehension of AT2 cell fate determination, findings that have been validated across both human and murine model systems. Nevertheless, multiple studies continue to highlight the existence of species-specific differences. Therefore, identifying conserved regulatory mechanisms that drive AT2 cell function and pursuing clinical translation represent the paramount priorities. To improve therapeutic strategies, developing targeted delivery systems is crucial for effectively modulating AT2 cell functions. Approaches such as EVs for protein delivery and gene editing technologies show promise, but challenges in specificity and sustained delivery need to be addressed. Future research should focus on the spatiotemporal regulation of AT2 cells and their interactions with other cell types. By integrating insights from advanced technologies, we can deepen our understanding of lung tissue repair mechanisms. This knowledge is vital for creating personalized therapies for ALI, ARDS, and related lung diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.
