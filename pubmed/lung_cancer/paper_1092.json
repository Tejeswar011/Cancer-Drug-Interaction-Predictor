One major reason is inflammation in the rumen, the stomach chamber responsible for nutrient absorption, which reduces the cells’ ability to generate energy. In this study, we examined how a key immune protein called complement 3 (C3) affects energy production in rumen epithelial cells. We created an inflammation model using lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial component that induces an immune response, and observed that C3 became activated and produced fragments (C3a and C3b) that lowered energy production by disrupting mitochondrial function. When we used specific inhibitors to block C3 activation or prevent its fragment C3a from binding to its receptor (C3aR), the cells produced more energy and released fewer inflammatory molecules. These findings reveal that excessive C3 activation can suppress energy metabolism in rumen cells, while blocking the C3–C3aR pathway may help restore rumen health, improve nutrient use, and support better growth in yaks living under harsh environmental conditions. Abstract This study aimed to investigate whether intracellular complement 3 (C3) activation regulates ATP production in yak rumen epithelial cells under inflammatory conditions and its potential mechanism. An in vitro inflammation model was established by stimulating yak rumen epithelial cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Then, protease inhibitors targeting C3 activation enzymes were added. Additionally, to explore the downstream signaling pathway, exogenous C3a and the C3a receptor (C3aR) inhibitor C3aRY were applied to the inflammation model.

Introduction Yak ( Bos grunniens 1 2 3 Previous studies have found that rumen epithelium plays an important physiological role in the absorption and transport of nutrients and the protection of the rumen wall [ 4 5 2 6 7 8 C3 is the most abundant component in serum and plays a central role in innate immunity [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Most studies on the mechanism of C3 intracellular activation that regulates cellular metabolism mainly focus on the immune cells of humans and mice. Rumen epithelium is a stratified squamous epithelium, which is different from the simple columnar epithelium, such as intestinal epithelium. Therefore, it was unclear whether intracellular activation of C3 occurred in rumen epithelial cells induced by LPS. It is also unclear how intracellular activation of C3 regulates the mitochondrial ATP production in rumen epithelial cells under an inflammatory state. In this study, LPS was added exogenously to establish an inflammatory yak rumen epithelial cell model, to study the mechanism of intracellular activation of C3 and its regulation on the ATP production in yak rumen epithelial cells. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Source of Rumen Epithelial Cells and Ethics Statement Yak rumen epithelial cells were selected from the immortalized yak rumen epithelial cell line, from a previously established cell line derived from yak rumen tissue [ 16 2.2. Resuscitation and Cultivation of Rumen Epithelial Cells in Yak The frozen immortalized yak rumen epithelial cell line was quickly thawed in a 37 °C water bath. Centrifuge at 1000 r/min for 3 min and discard the supernatant. Add 1 mL of complete medium (89% 1640 medium + 1% triple antibiotics + 10% fetal bovine serum), resuspend, and then seed in a 25 cm 2 2 2.3. Experimental Design To establish an inflammatory model of rumen epithelial cells, the yak rumen epithelial cells, after digestion and centrifugation, were inoculated into 6-well plates according to the appropriate density. When the cells were fused to 80~90%, the cells were treated with LPS from Escherichia coli 17 To investigate the effects of intracellular activation of C3 on ATP production in the rumen epithelial cells, rumen epithelial cell was divided into 5 groups, including blank groups, LPS group, LPS + CA-074ME1 group, LPS + Cathepsin L Inhibitor I group, and LPS + Cathepsin Inhibitor 1 group. The blank group was treated with the complete medium as a control group. The LPS group was treated with additional LPS in the complete medium. Based on the LPS group, the LPS + CA-074ME1 group was treated with 20 nmol/L CA-074ME (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), which is the inhibitor of cathepsin B, a potential cathepsin to stimulate C3 intracellular activation. The LPS + Cathepsin L Inhibitor I group was treated with 10 nmol/L cathepsin L Inhibitor I (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), which is the inhibitor of Cathepsin L, another potential cathepsin to stimulate C3 intracellular activation. The LPS + Cathepsin Inhibitor 1 group was treated with 10 nmol/L cathepsin Inhibitor 1 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), which is a pan-inhibitor for cathepsins in the cells. The appropriate concentration of each inhibitor was optimal in the pre-experiment. After the cells were fused to 80~90%, the different cathepsin inhibitors were added to pretreat the cells for 2 h, and then LPS was added to treat the cells for 24 h [ 18 Additionally, to explore the impact of intracellular C3 downstream activation on ATP production in yak rumen epithelial cells, the rumen epithelial cells were divided into 4 groups, including blank groups, LPS group, LPS + C3a group, and LPS + C3aRY group. The blank group was treated with the complete medium as a control group. The LPS group was treated with additional LPS in the complete medium. Based on the LPS group, the LPS + C3a group was treated with 1 μmol/L C3a protein (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA). The LPS + C3aR group was treated with 30 nmol/L C3aRY (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA), which is a C3a receptor antagonist inhibitor. The appropriate concentration of protein inhibitor was selected according to both pre-experiments in our laboratory and previous studies that applied comparable ranges in cell models [ 19 20 21 2.4. Cell Viability Assay Cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Yak rumen epithelial cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 10 4 2 2.5. Determination of Inflammatory Cytokine and C3 Level The adherent cells were gently washed with 1× cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Solarbio, Beijing, China), then digested with a 0.25% trypsin solution (Solarbio, Beijing, China), and centrifuged at 1000× g 6 g 22 2.6. RNA Extraction and qRT–PCR Analysis of Gene Expression Total RNA extraction kit (Yeasen Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) was used to extract total RNA from cells. Gene expression was determined by qPCR as previously reported [ 23 ® Supplementary Table S1 −ΔΔCt 2.7. Detection of ATP Concentration The cells were collected in the centrifuge tube, and the supernatant was discarded. 1 mL extract was added into 5 million cells, then crushed by ultrasonic wave (Ice bath, power 200 W, ultrasound 2 s, stop 1 s, total time 1 min), and centrifuged at 10,000× g g 24 2.8. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Monitored by JC-1 The 10 5 5 g g g 25 2.9. Detection of Organic Acids The culture medium in the culture plate was removed and cleaned with PBS. The cells were collected into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 4000 r/min for 3 min. After the supernatant was sucked out, 0.2 mL 2.5% perchloric acid was added into the centrifuge tube and ultrasound for 1 h. 13,000 r/min centrifugation for 30 min. The concentration of Malic acid (MA), Citric Acid (CA), Pyruvic acid (PA), and Lactic acid (LA) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA)was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography(HPLC) [ 26 2.10. Statistical Analysis All data were represented as mean and standard error. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 27.0, including normality testing, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Duncan’s multiple range test for post hoc comparisons. Experimental data were visualized using GraphPad Prism 8.0.0. Differences were considered statistically significant at p 3. Results 3.1.

Discussion Previous studies have shown that the increase in LPS concentration in the rumen of growths retardation yaks can up-regulate pro-inflammatory factors such as IL-1β and TNF-α, leading to immunoinflammatory reaction in rumen epithelium, damages rumen epithelial barrier function, and inhibits feed conversion and efficient growth of yaks [ 17 27 2 4.1. LPS-Induced Inflammation Model and Intracellular Activation of C3 in Rumen Epithelial Cells of Yak Previous studies have indicated that when the LPS concentration increases from 0 to 200,000 EU/mL (20 µg/mL), there is a significant suppression of rumen epithelial cell activity, along with an increase in pro-inflammatory factor levels, thus establishing a cellular inflammation model [ 17 28 29 10 30 4.2. Effects of Inhibition of Intracellular C3 Activation on ATP Production in Rumen Epithelial Cells of Yak Under Inflammatory Conditions In this study, to determine whether the activation products of C3 in rumen epithelial cells are related to the inhibition of ATP production, protease inhibitors were added to rumen epithelial cells under LPS-induced inflammatory conditions. Under LPS-induced inflammatory conditions, the addition of cathepsin inhibitors reduced the activation products of C3 (C3a and C3b), downregulated the expression of C3 C3aR ME1 ATP5A LDHA UCP2 31 32 33 ME1 ATP5A LDHA UCP2 4.3. Effect of C3a/C3aR Downstream of C3 on Pro-Inflammatory Factors and ATP Production of Yak Rumen Epithelial Cells Under an Inflammatory State In this study, it was found that the expression of C3 in rumen epithelial cells could be activated after the addition of LPS. According to previous studies, the intracellular activation of C3 is the core of immune defense and immune regulation, and the most critical step is the production of C3 into C3a and C3b [ 34 35 36 8 37 21 In addition, studies have found that organic acids such as citric acid (CA), malic acid (MA), and pyruvic acid (PA) are important components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Through the TCA cycle, ATP is produced as energy, which enhances the digestibility of certain nutrients and thus participates in the metabolic pathways of the organism [ 38 39 4.4. Effects of C3a/C3aR Downstream of C3 on cAMP/PKA Pathway-Related Gene Expression of Yak Rumen Epithelial Cells Under an Inflammatory State Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is one of the earliest discovered second messengers, primarily regulating the transcription of multiple target genes through protein kinase A (PKA) and its downstream effectors, such as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). It plays a crucial role in intracellular signal transduction [ 40 Nrf2 P53 41 42 43 Nrf2 P53 PKA CREB P53 Nrf2 21 35 4.5. Effect of C3a/C3aR Downstream of C3 on Expression of Tight Junction Protein Gene Tight junction proteins are in the upper layer of epithelial cells, which play an important role in preventing harmful substances, such as ruminal LPS, from entering the submucosal layer through the epithelial intercellular spaces and regulating epithelial permeability and nutrient transport [ 44 Occludin 45 ZO-1 Occludin Claudin-1 46 5. Conclusions The results of this study demonstrated that intracellular C3 activation inhibited ATP production in yak rumen epithelial cells under an inflammatory response. Specifically, LPS stimulation triggered the generation of C3a, which binds to its receptor C3aR, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by decreased membrane potential. This interaction suppressed aerobic respiration, as evidenced by the downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites and ATP5A Acknowledgments We are grateful for the help and support from the bovine low-carbon breeding innovation team of the Animal Nutrition Institute of Sichuan Agricultural University.
