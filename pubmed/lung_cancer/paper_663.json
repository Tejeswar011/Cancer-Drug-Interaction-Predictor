Elizabethkingia miricola Chryseobacterium miricola, Elizabethkingia Streptococci Streptococci Prevotella Fusobacterium E. miricola E. miricola E. miricola Case presentation We present the case of a male in his 70s who underwent an elective Nissen fundoplication for the management of a large hiatus hernia on a background of peptic ulcer disease. His past medical history is significant for a coronary artery bypass graft, atrial fibrillation, a permanent pacemaker and gout. Of note, he has no underlying medical conditions or takes any medications causing immunosuppression. He was admitted electively from the community and had no recent hospital exposure or antimicrobial use prior to admission. He received co-amoxiclav as surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis as recommended by local antimicrobial guidelines. Day one post surgery, he became hypotensive, had an acute kidney injury and increasing oxygen requirement and was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for inotropic support to maintain his blood pressure and was intubated and ventilated for increasing oxygen requirements. Of note, he did not require renal replacement therapy. A full septic screen, including blood cultures, was performed prior to transfer to the ICU as he had been febrile, and he was commenced on broad-spectrum antimicrobials (meropenem, vancomycin and gentamicin) as per local septic shock guidelines in addition to antifungal cover given his recent upper gastrointestinal surgery following discussion with the Clinical Microbiology team. Investigations The patient’s inflammatory markers were significantly elevated with a white cell count (WCC) of 19.9×10 9 9 E. miricola 1 table 1 Table 1 Antimicrobial susceptibility testing results AST method Result Piperacillin-tazobactam Disk diffusion Zone 20 mm Co-trimoxazole Disk diffusion Zone 27 mm Ciprofloxacin Gradient MIC test strips MIC 0.25 mg/L AST, antimicrobial susceptibility testing. CT scan revealed a large air and fluid collection posterior to the heart, which appeared extraluminal, within the chest, measuring 25×7 cm in the shape of the previously evident hernia. CT also revealed moderate bilateral pleural effusions, an extensive pneumomediastinum, pockets of free air within the upper abdomen and a splenic infarct. Mediastinal and pleural drains were inserted. Pus from the mediastinal collection yielded polymicrobial growth; initially, E. miricola Candida albicans Staphylococcus aureus E. miricola C. albicans, Treatment Initial empiric broad-spectrum antimicrobials were continued until the identification of E. miricola E. miricola C. albicans figure 1 Figure 1 Timeline of clinical course. GNB, ram-negative bacilli; ICU, intensive care unit; MSSA, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus Outcome and follow-up Our patient clinically improved following drainage of his collections in combination with appropriate antimicrobial therapy. He was discharged from the ICU to a surgical ward. His WCC and CRP were normalised. Seven weeks of targeted antimicrobials were completed, and he has subsequently been discharged home.

Carbapenems are not effective against Elizabethkingia E. miricola Learning points Elizabethkingia miricola Management can be challenging due to a lack of data and intrinsic resistance to many antimicrobials. Our case highlighted the need for a combination of source control and targeted antimicrobials. Funding: Case reports provide a valuable learning resource for the scientific community and can indicate areas of interest for future research. They should not be used in isolation to guide treatment choices or public health policy.
