Whether cells exploit mitochondrial metabolism to protect from infection is unclear. Here, we found that the transcription factor ATF4 activates a mitochondrial defense based on the essential B vitamin folate.

Unlike other organelles, mitochondria have their own genome, a vestige of their prokaryotic origin ( 6 7 7 8 10 Several intracellular pathogens also require host products downstream of 1C metabolism for their growth. Host cells have thus evolved defense mechanisms to limit 1C metabolite availability, such as through the degradation of dNTPs during viral infection ( 5 11 Toxoplasma gondii, 12 13 ATF4 regulates mtDNA levels during infection and infection-independent stress To determine whether infection leads to changes in host mtDNA copy number, we measured mtDNA levels in human ES-2 ovarian cancer cells infected with Type I Toxoplasma DLOOP mt-ND1 mt-ND6 mt-CYTB mt-CO1 Fig. 1A Fig. 1B Fig. S1 Toxoplasma Fig. S2A B Fig. S2C D 14 15 Toxoplasma We noted that infection increased the expression of promoters of mitochondrial biogenesis including nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1a (PGC1a) ( Fig. S3A B 16 SDHB Toxoplasma- Fig. S3C D Fig. S3E Fig. S3F G How do Toxoplasma- TFAM TWNK, Fig. S4 Fig. 1B 17 18 TFAM TWNK Toxoplasma- Table S1 Toxoplasma Fig. 1C 19 21 Fig. 1C ATF4 is the main effector of the integrated stress response (ISR), which promotes cellular recovery during various stresses including ER stress and viral infection ( 22 23 24 Fig. S5 Toxoplasma- Fig. 1D F Toxoplasma, Toxoplasma Fig. S6A C Fig. 1G Toxoplasma Fig. 1H J Fig. S5 ATF4 increases mtDNA levels in a mitochondrial 1C metabolism-dependent manner How does ATF4 regulate mtDNA during infection?

To address this question, we first assessed the contribution of mito-1C metabolism to dTMP and dTTP biosynthesis during Toxoplasma Toxoplasma- 2 2 Fig. 3A 7 32 Fig. 3A 32 Fig. 3B C 32 Toxoplasma Fig. 3B C Fig. 3B C We reasoned that the observed increase in M+2 dTMP and dTTP in infected WT and ATF4 KO cells could result from a shift to host reliance on host cyto-1C. Alternatively, because Toxoplasma Fig. 3A 33 34 Toxoplasma- 35 Fig. S10A B Toxoplasma We next addressed whether the increase in M+2 dTMP and dTTP in ATF4 KO cells was due to their synthesis by host cells or Toxoplasma 33 ΔcpsII Fig. 3B D Fig. 3E Fig. S11 Fig. S12 How does ATF4 activation regulate parasite dTMP levels?

Emerging evidence shows that the microbiota protect against gut infections by consuming nutrients also used by pathogens ( 44 1 9 10 Our discovery of ATF4 as an effector of a folate-driven metabolic defense response reveals a role for mitochondrial metabolism in defense against the human pathogen Toxoplasma Materials and Methods Cell culture and cell lines HeLa adenocarcinoma cells, ES-2 ovary clear cell carcinoma, Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), were obtained from ATCC (CCL-2, CRL-1978, and SCRC-1041, respectively); ES-2 cells stably expressing pMXs-eGFP-OMP25 (referred to as OMM-GFP; Addgene #83356) were generated through lentiviral transduction.

After a brief spin, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer and 10,000 events were analyzed on a BD LSRFortessa for GFP median fluorescence intensity (mFI) using BD FACSDiva software. To assess parasite proliferation, monolayers of ES-2 cells infected with RFP expression parasites (RHΔku80:mCherry+) were rinsed with PBS, trypsinized and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in FACS buffer (3% FBS in PBS) for 10 min. After a brief spin, cells were resuspended in FACS buffer and 10.000 events analyzed on a LSRFortessa and the RFP mean fluorescence intensity (mFI) using BD FACSDiva software. Quantitative PCR for mtDNA analysis For mtDNA measurements, genomic DNA was isolated from cell pellets that were washed once with 1x PBS using the Blood and Tissue DNA extraction kit (Qiagen #69504). DNA was quantified by nanodrop. 50 ng of genomic DNA were amplified using PowerSYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific #A25742). Reactions were performed in 384 Hard-Shell microplates (BioRAD #HSP3801) sealed with adhesive qPCR seal (Roche) in a and Bio-Rad Real-Time PCR system with the following cycler program: 95°C for 7 min followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s. Dissociation curves confirmed single PCR products, and signals were analyzed within the linear amplification range. Each sample was run in triplicate. Relative mtDNA copy number changes were calculated using the comparative ΔΔCt method ( 52 t n t −ΔΔCt DLOOP, mt-ND1, mt-CYTB, mt-ND6 and mt-COX1 RUNX2 ACTB Table S3 Quantitative PCR for mRNA analysis For analysis of mRNA expression, RNA purification was performed using TriZol (Thermo Fischer Scientific; #15596018) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Reverse Transcriptase reaction (RT) was done using 1 μg of RNA for each sample into cDNA using SuperScript™ VILO™ Master Mix (Thermo Fischer Scientific; # 11755050).

The primer sequences used in this study can be found in Table S3 methods ACTB HPRT 52 t n t −ΔΔCt Immunoblotting and antibodies Whole cells were harvested in chilled lysis buffer (50mM Hepes-KOH pH 7.4, 40mM NaCl, 2mM EDTA, 1.5mM NaVO4, 50mM NaF, 10mM NaPyrophosphate, 10mM, NaBetaGlycerophosphate (disodium salt pentahydrate), 1% Triton X-100) and lysed for 30 min on ice. Lysates were subsequently centrifuged at 10 min at 14,000 x g at 4°C and the clarified supernatant was transferred into a fresh tube with 5X SDS for a final volume of 1X SDS. Following SDS-PAGE and gel transfer, membranes were blocked with TBS-0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% milk and the primary antibodies were incubated overnight. Following incubation, blots were washed three times in TBS-T and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (CST #7076) or anti-rabbit IgG (CST #7074) at a 1:4000 dilution for 45 minutes and developed using a chemiluminescence system (Pierce™ ECL Western Blotting Substrate or Pierce SuperSignal™ West Atto Ultimate Sensitivity Substrate; ThermoFisher Scientific).

The following morning, cells were infected with RH mcherry expressing Toxoplasma 2 Edu replication assay EdU incorporation was detected via Click-iT EdU AlexaFluor 488 labeling kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions ( C10637 Immunofluorescence Assay Cells were fixed using growth medium containing 3.7% PFA for 15 min at 37°C and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min. Following incubation with 3% BSA for 1 hour, cells were incubated with primary antibodies (ATF4, 1:250) overnight. The next day, cells were washed 3X with 1X PBS (5 minutes each) before incubation with secondary antibodies for 1h in the dark at room temperature. Following secondary incubation, cells were cells were washed 3X with 1X PBS. All images were taken with a 100X/1.35 silicon oil objective and excitation with either 405, 488, or 561 laser lines, using ORCA-Flash4.0 cameras (Hamatsu), and cellSens Software. Proteomics sample preparation As previously described in ( 53 LC-MS/MS analysis For label-free quantification, peptides were separated on a 75 cm, 75 μm internal diameter Acclaim™ PepMap™ analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue number 164939) using an EASY-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The column was maintained at 50°C. Buffer A and B were 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Peptides derived from whole cells were separated on a segmented gradient from 6% to 31% buffer B for 230 min and from 31% to 50% buffer B for 10 min at 250 nl / min. Peptides derived from enriched mitochondria were separated on a segmented gradient from 6% to 31% buffer B for 110 min and from 31% to 50% buffer B for 10 min at 250 nl / min. Eluting peptides were analyzed on a QExactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide precursor m/z measurements were carried out at 60000 resolution in the 300 to 1800 m/z range. The top ten most intense precursors with charge state from 2 to 7 only were selected for HCD fragmentation using 25% normalized collision energy. The m/z values of the peptide fragments were measured at 30000 resolution using a minimum AGC target of 1e4 and 55 ms maximum injection time for the whole cell samples or 15000 resolution, minimum AGS target of 1e4, and 120 ms maximum injection time for the enriched mitochondria samples. Upon fragmentation, precursors were put on a dynamic exclusion list for 45 sec. TMT labeled peptides were and separated on a 50 cm, 75 μm Acclaim PepMap column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Product No. 164942) and analysed on a Orbitrap Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a FAIMS device (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The FAIMS device was operated in two compensation voltages, −50 V and −70 V. Synchronous precursor selection based MS3 was used for the acquisition of the TMT10plex reporter ion signals. Peptide separations were performed on an EASY-nLC1200 using a 90 min linear gradient from 6% to 31% buffer; buffer A was 0.1% FA, buffer B was 0.1% FA, 80% ACN. The analytical column was operated at 50°C. Raw files were split based on the FAIMS compensation voltage using FreeStyle (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein identification and quantification Label-free quantification raw data were analyzed with MaxQuant version 1.6.0.13 ( 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 token:Usy5DtrhLbiN Stable Isotope Labelling with L-glutamine- 15 2 2 million ES-2 cells were seeded in a 10cm dishes in DMEM containing 10% FBS and cultured for 16 h.

The column temperature was held at 30°C, while the auto sampler temperature was set to 6°C. A potassium hydroxide gradient was generated using a potassium hydroxide cartridge (Eluent Generator, Thermo Scientific), which was supplied with deionized water (Milli-Q IQ 7000, Millipore). The metabolite separation was carried at a flow rate of 380 μL/min, applying the following gradient conditions: 0–3 min, 10 mM KOH; 3–12 min, 10−50 mM KOH; 12–19 min, 50–100 mM KOH; 19–22 min, 100 mM KOH, 22–23 min, 100–10 mM KOH. The column was re-equilibrated at 10 mM for 3 min. For the analysis of metabolic pool sizes the eluting compounds were detected in negative ion mode using full scan measurements in the mass range m/z 77 – 770 on a Q-Exactive HF high resolution MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The heated electrospray ionization (ESI) source settings of the mass spectrometer were: Spray voltage 3.2 kV, capillary temperature was set to 300°C, sheath gas flow 50 AU (arbitrary units), aux gas flow 20 AU at a temperature of 330°C and a sweep gas flow of 2 AU. The S-lens was set to a value of 60. The LC-MS data analysis was performed using the TraceFinder software (Version 5.1, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The identity of each compound was validated by authentic reference compounds, which were measured at the beginning and the end of the sequence. For data analysis the area of the deprotonated [M-H + −1 2 −2 12 12 12 62 Sample preparation for folate detection Cell extracts were prepared by homogenization of cell pellets by sonication in buffer containing 20 mM ammonia acetate, 0.1% ascorbic acid, 0.1% citric acid and 100 mM dithiothreitol at pH 7. Protein was removed by precipitation by addition of two volumes of acetonitrile and centrifugation (12,000 g at 4°C). Supernatants were transferred, lyophilized, stored at −80°C and re-suspended in dH 2 63 64 63 65 Infection of mice with Toxoplasma 6–8 weeks old female C57BL/6 J mice were obtained from Charles River. All animal work was approved by local authorities (Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany LANUV 81–02.04.2020.A467) and animal procedures were carried out in accordance with European, national and institutional guidelines and according to good practice of animal handling. Mice were maintained at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing with 12 h light cycle and regular chow diet.

A one-way ANOVA was used to compare means across multiple groups when testing an independent variable. A two ANOVA was used when testing the effects of two independent variables. Comparisons between two independent groups were performed using unpaired t-tests, and multiple unpaired t-tests were used when comparing several independent variables between two groups. To correct for multiple comparisons, the false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled using the two-stage step-up method of Benjamini, Krieger, and Yekutieli. The statistical test used for each analysis is specified in the figure legends. Newly created materials Newly created cell lines, parasite lines, and plasmids available upon request.
