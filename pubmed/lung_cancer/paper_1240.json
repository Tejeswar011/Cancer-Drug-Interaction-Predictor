Introduction Hemodilution is a critical procedure used for surgical applications with a high risk of blood loss. It involves collecting blood into collection bags during surgery and simultaneously giving the patient crystalloids or colloids, diluting normal blood components [ 1 2 3 4 Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is a strategy used to reduce the need for blood transfusion. The first step in ANH is the acute and controlled removal of whole blood, and then the blood loss is replaced with either the same volume of blood or colloid or with crystalloid at three times the volume of blood lost [ 5 6 7 8 Osmoregulation and body water homeostasis depend on regulating aquaporin (AQP) protein family members, which are essential cell water transporters. They enable water transport and the passage of small molecules, such as glycerol, through biological channels in many epithelial and endothelial cells [ 9 10 11 12 13 2 2 14 Beyond their physiological roles, AQPs have been increasingly gaining attention within surgical and critical care settings due to their roles in fluid homeostasis, edema control, and tissue-specific responses to hemodynamic stress. Studies utilizing experimental models of hemorrhagic shock, cardiopulmonary bypass, and fluid resuscitation have revealed altered AQP expression, notably an upregulation of AQP4 in cerebral edema and modulation of AQP1 in pulmonary injury [ 15 16 17 18 19 Considering the widespread clinical application of ANH in surgical settings, it is plausible that ANH may induce organ-specific molecular alterations, including changes in AQP expression patterns, which could reflect early cellular stress responses. Herein, we hypothesized that ANH would cause tissue-specific changes in AQP expression linked to early adaptive or stress responses and molecular injury markers, and investigated the short-term effects of ANH on AQP1, AQP3, and AQP4 protein expression in the heart, aorta, kidney, and liver, as well as its impact on systemic hemodynamics, blood gas levels, and markers of apoptosis and inflammation. This study is the first to link tissue-specific AQP expression with apoptotic and inflammatory responses in the rat ANH model, showing that ANH leads to early systemic and tissue-specific alterations in these parameters. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethics Statement and Animals Eighteen male juvenile (6 months of age) Hannover–Sprague Dawley (Han:SPRD) rats (400–500 g) were included in this study. The animals were kept in a controlled environment with a 12 h light/dark cycle, 60% humidity, and a temperature of 20–24 °C; free access to food and water was allowed. Ethical approval was provided by the Animal Ethics Committee of University of Health Sciences, Bağcılar Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Türkiye (approval protocol number: HADYEK-2023/29; 24 April 2023). All animal care and experiments were conducted at Istanbul Bağcılar Training and Research Hospital Experimental Research and Skill Development Training Centre (BADABEM) by ARRIVE guidelines and the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. 2.2. Experimental Setup and Design The groups were determined by randomizing (generated using the standard = RAND function in Microsoft Excel) the experimental model and the controls as follows: (1) Control group (2) Sham control group (3) Experimental hemodilution group Before the procedure, the rats’ body weights were noted, and the estimated blood volume (EBV) was calculated based on those weights. The EBV in rats is 64 mL/kg [ 20 21 0 1 2 BV 2 Figure 1 2.3. Experimental Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution Model The experimental ANH model was processed during the maintenance of general anesthesia. Therefore, rats in Group-S and Group-ANH were anesthetized with 2% sevoflurane (Sojourn ® Rats were placed in supine position, and an intravenous catheter-26G was placed in the tail vein and left femoral artery. To achieve the rodent model of acute normovolemic hemodilution, the allowable blood volume was withdrawn from the left femoral artery in Group-ANH rats (T 0 6 current target average 22 23 24 25 26 2 6 1 2.4.

The Effects of Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution on Aquaporin Expression Profile in Different Tissues To identify tissue-specific expression patterns of AQP1, AQP3, and AQP4 under normal physiological conditions, independent of any intervention such as anesthesia or fluid administration, immunoblotting was performed in the aorta, heart, liver, and kidney tissues collected from the control group at the T 2 Figure 3 Figure 3 ANH led to a tissue-specific change in the AQP expression profile ( Figure 4 p p p p p Figure 4 p p Figure 4 p p Figure 4 p p p p Figure 4 3.3.

Discussion Perioperative fluid management has been a subject of debate for many years. Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is one of the prominent strategies used to prevent blood loss or hypovolemia [ 1 2 7 8 34 35 31 36 37 31 38 31 11 39 9 10 Herein, we formed an experimental ANH rat model using a balanced crystalloid solution. As shown in Figure 2 1 30 31 32 25 26 22 23 24 2 40 41 2 31 41 42 43 44 45 37 46 Although no significant intergroup differences were detected in most blood electrolytes and metabolites ( Table 2 47 2 43 44 48 43 44 43 48 49 50 19 51 2 2 Aquaporins (AQPs) are a major family of diverse transmembrane proteins. As essential cell water transporters, AQPs regulate osmoregulation and body water homeostasis. Their expression and types vary depending on the tissue and even the cell [ 9 52 Figure 3 16 Figure 4 53 Figure 3 54 Figure 4 55 56 Figure 4 Numerous reports have revealed a close relationship between AQP expression and injury caused by various stimulants [ 57 36 Figure 5 Figure 6 58 37 59 11 12 13 Figure 7 Figure 8 53 5. Conclusions This study provides the first evidence linking tissue-specific aquaporin (AQP1, AQP3, and AQP4) expression with apoptotic and inflammatory responses following hemodilution (in the ANH rat model). Nevertheless, this report was subject to certain limitations. The primary constraint was its reliance on short-term observation (specifically at the 24 h time point); thus, extended follow-up periods would provide a more comprehensive assessment of recovery or resolution. The use of whole-organ Western blot analysis (limitation: absence of cell-type specificity), and the lack of measurement of plasma protein concentrations, particularly albumin (limitation: inability to assess colloid osmotic pressure changes) were notable limitations. Despite its limitations, this study demonstrated that ANH produces both systemic and tissue-specific acute effects. Specifically, ANH altered the expression profiles of AQP1, AQP3, and AQP4 in a tissue-specific manner; the results suggest that AQP1 and AQP4 may play protective roles in the heart and kidney, respectively. In parallel, ANH induced transient yet clinically relevant systemic alterations, including elevated potassium, calcium, and lactate, as well as decreased glucose, pH, base excess, and PaCO 2 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/medicina61091506/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, K.E., S.D. and A.Ş.; methodology, K.E., S.D., A.Ş., D.S.O., E.B.D. and E.Ö.-U.; validation, K.E., A.Ş. and E.Ö.-U.; formal analysis, A.Ş.; investigation, K.E., S.D., A.Ş., D.S.O., İ.Ö., C.G.-G. and S.K.-S.; resources, E.Ö.-U.; data curation, K.E., S.D., A.Ş., D.S.O. and C.G.-G.; writing—original draft preparation, K.E., S.D., A.Ş. and İ.Ö.; writing—review and editing, K.E., S.D., A.Ş., S.E., E.B.D., N.Y. and E.Ö.-U.; visualization, A.Ş. and İ.Ö.

Juvenile male Hannover–Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to three groups (n = 6/group): Group-1 (control, C), no procedure was performed. Group-2 (sham control, S), only anesthesia (2% sevoflurane in 50–50% oxygen–air for 1 h) was applied. Group-3 (experimental hemodilution), anesthesia and acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) were applied. To achieve the ANH, the allowable blood volume was withdrawn from the left femoral artery (T 0 1 BV 0 1 2 Figure 2 Changes in arterial blood gas parameters from T BV 2 A B C D E F 2 min max p p p p p p p BV p p Figure 3 Aquaporins (AQPs) are expressed differently in different tissues.
