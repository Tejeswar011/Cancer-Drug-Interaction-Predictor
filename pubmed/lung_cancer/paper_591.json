Most evidence suggests that mNSCLC exploits specific molecular drivers and mechanisms to maintain physiology, metabolism, and immune evasion during tumorigenesis. Genome-wide association studies also revealed particular mutations in the oncogenic drivers supporting tumor cell proliferation and survival, resulting in aggressive and drug-resistant phenotypes of mNSCLC. While significant progress has been made in understanding mNSCLC at the genetic and molecular levels, a considerable gap remains in understanding the dynamic interplay between intrinsic factors—particularly key tumor-associated cells—and tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) during metastasis. Hence, this review highlights histological and genetic characteristics, emphasizes the clinical relevance of metastasis, and the roles of tumor-associated cells in shaping the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in mNSCLC. Understanding these intricate features and mechanisms is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic targets and improving strategies to combat mNSCLC progression in diagnosed patients.

Furthermore, we discuss the major non-genetic factors, including epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), as well as cellular complexity, including lung cancer stem cells (CSCs) and immune cell architecture, within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), which are primarily implicated in promoting or correlated with mNSCLC disease. Additionally, with the development of innovative platforms and ongoing clinical investigations in NSCLC, we have provided an outlook on the advanced strategies used to decipher the molecular complexity and clinical management of mNSCLC, along with their associated limitations. Dissection of key characteristics in NSCLC In the current immuno-oncology era, histological subtyping remains an essential tool for predicting prognosis and guiding optimal therapy in lung cancer patients [ 11 13 14 1 15 17 18 18 th 18 Fig. 1 Schematic representation of multifactorial mechanisms, including genomic instability (nucleotide mutations and chromosomal instability), epigenetic alterations, non-genetic mechanisms (such as cancer stem cell and immune profile), histological type, and tumor mutational burden, driving heterogeneity in lung cancer.

(2025) https://BioRender.com/tkhj3jq Histopathological classification Histologically, NSCLC can be classified into adenocarcinomas (ADC, nearly 40%−60%) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC, nearly 25%−30%) based on the site of origin [ 6 7 2 19 20 21 23 24 25 25 6 7 Fig. 2 Histopathological and key attributes of lung cancer. The major histopathological types of lung cancer include small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which arises from neuroendocrine cells, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which originates from epithelial cells. NSCLC is further classified into three main subtypes: adenocarcinoma (ADC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and large cell carcinoma (LCC), as described in the published literature [ 26 27 https://BioRender.com/ejd767q As histological analysis is restricted to small biopsy samples, hence, absence of correct morphological features often averts a suitable LCC classification, which is particularly applicable in advanced stages of NSCLC and embraces high-grade undifferentiated primary or impracticable metastatic tumors. Nevertheless, the recent WHO classification has vividly reformed the standards for “anaplastic large cell carcinomas” by announcing a distinct group of “sarcomatoid carcinoma”, which contains only occasional tumor subtypes (clear cells, lymphoepithelial, and rhabdoid variants) [ 28 29 30 1 Table 1 2015 WHO classification and main cellular characteristics of two major types of NSCLC based on cytologic samples and small biopsies in patients, adopted from Ref.

(TTF-1 also known as NKX2-1) and keratin 7 (KRT7) as a marker for the ADC subtype while tumor protein 63 (p63) and ΔNp63 isoform of p63 (also written as Delta Np63, ΔNp63, or p40) as principal markers for the SCC subtype [ 31 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 Genetic alterations Despite gradual improvements in anticancer targeted therapy and immunotherapy, the efficacy of available treatments varies based on

Activated by RAS and subsequently activating MEK and ERK (MAPK pathway), promotes ADC histological subtype [ 107 112 EGFR NSCLC Brain, bones, liver, and adrenal gland • Overexpression • Activating EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion and exon 21 L858 • EGFR • Overexpressed in 15–50% of NSCLC • Genetic alterations occur as exon 19 deletions (60%) or L858R missense substitutions (35%), both of which result in constitutive activation of the receptor leading to cell growth and proliferation • Ex20ins mutations vary from 1.8%–15% among EGFR mutations in NSCLC (e.g., L858R, exon 19 deletions) drive tumor progression and metastasis, and detected in 13–25% of ADC and SCC [ 113 115 FGFR1 Brain • Amplification • FGFR1 ALK • FGFR1-ERK1/2-SOX2 axis promotes cell proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition [ 116 119 HER2 Brain and bones • Amplification • Overexpression • Mutation, e.g., primarily exon 20 insertions, Duplication or YVMA 776− 779 insertion (80 − 90%) or HER2 • Amplification in

epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tumor cells through RAS/RAF/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, WNT/β-catenin, and STAT pathways, and promotes cancer invasion [ 120 123 130 131 NTRK Brain • Neurotrophin kinase NTRK1, NTRK2, NTRK3 EML4::NTRK3 • NTRK fusions are rare in NSCLC • Promoted activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF/MAPK, and PLCγ pathways • Drives tumor growth and survival through a constitutively active fusion protein containing the TRK kinase domain [ 123 132 135 PD-L1 NSCLC Multiple organs, including the brain, liver, and bones • Overexpression • At least 50% of tumor cells showed PD-L1 expression, while 34% of patients exhibited expression after relapse • Linked to immune evasion and aggressive metastasis [ 136 138 PIK3CA Brain, bones, and lymph nodes • Most common mutation is E545K and E542K on exon 9 and rare hotspot is kinase domain like H1047R on exon 20 • Frequency in lung SCC is high (11.4%) than in lung ADC (2.8%) • Leads to PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation [ 139 142 RET NSCLC Brain, liver, and bones • Chromosomal rearrangements involve fusion partners such as KIF5B, CCDC6, NCOA4, and TRIM33 • 13 RET/PTC fusion proteins identified (RET/PTC1-PTC9) • A low TMB (< 2.5 mut/Mb) but variable PD-L1 expression levels • Adenocarcinoma histological subtype • As frequent as 7–17% in NSCLC cases • Activation leads to RAS/RAF/MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and PLCγ signaling → cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation • Chimeric proteins constitutively dimerize, activating kinase domain leading to uncontrolled activation of MAPK and PI3K pathways [ 123 143 146 ROS1 NSCLC Brain and liver • Up to 24 fusion partners identified • Occurs in 3% of NSCLC as rare but aggressive subtype • Adenocarcinoma histological subtype • ROS1 is a tyrosine kinase receptor with significant structural homology to ALK • Rearrangements/translocations give rise to fusions of functional ROS1 tyrosine kinase domain with other genes • Resulting constitutive activation drives transformation and activates SHP-1/SHP-2, JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT/MTOR, and MAPK/ERK signaling leading to enhanced tumor cell survival and proliferation [ 66 123 147 150 STK11/LKB1 Lungs, liver, and brain • Missense Mutations • Occurs in 20–30% of NSCLC tumors STK11 Often co-occurs with KRAS mutations and enhances tumor invasiveness [ 151 152 In summary, depending on the NSCLC subtype, the genetic alterations vary, resulting in specific dysregulation of key pathways in mNSCLC, such as oxidative stress response, cell-cycle regulation, cell survival, apoptosis, and differentiation. Therefore, considering the distinct histological and genetic alterations, an enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms and subtypes driving mNSCLC progression may facilitate the expansion of targeted therapeutic approaches, potentially improving the overall survival (OS) of affected patients. Clinical relevance of metastatic NSCLC Tumor metastasis, which refers to the systemic distribution and growth of tumor cells from the site of origin to distant body parts (tissue-destructive macro-metastases disrupt organ function), is a principal contributor to cancer-associated death [ 153 158 3 159 160 161 166 167 168 3 169 170 Fig. 3 Illustration of multistep process involved in cancer metastasis. (1) Local invasion—cancer cells escape into surrounding tissues; (2) Intravasation—entry into the circulatory system, which is supported by interactions with endothelial cells and immune components; (3) Circulating tumor cells (CTCs)—CTCs survive in the circulatory system despite shear stress and immune attacks, and often form clusters; (4) Extravasation—CTCs adhere to endothelial cells or tissues at a distant site and exit the circulation. CTCs then invade the secondary site, forming a pre-metastatic niche and micrometastasis; and finally, (5) Colonization—disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) adapt to the new tissue microenvironment, evade immune surveillance, and establish a metastatic niche, leading to macrometastases.

(2025) https://BioRender.com/6uvmhgn TNM staging system and its revisions In lung cancer, the TNM staging system—evaluating the size and characteristics of the primary tumor (T), the extent of lymph node involvement (N), and the presence or absence of metastasis (M)—is commonly employed to classify the disease's anatomical extent. This system provides a standardized framework for assessing disease severity, guiding treatment decisions, and predicting patient prognosis [ 171 172 173 174 176 177 178 4 Table 4 TNM stage classification considering stage peculiarities and suggestive treatments for lung cancer [ 179 180 Tumor Stage Tumor Staging Characteristics Treatment Suggestions Size Lymph Node Metastasis Occult carcinoma TX N0 M0 • Primary tumors cannot be assessed or proven by the presence of malignant cells in sputum or bronchial washings but not visualized with imaging or bronchoscopy • No regional lymph node metastasis • No distant metastasis – Stage 0 Tis N0 M0 • Carcinoma in situ Stage IA1 T1a N0 M0 • Tumor ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus • Tumor ≤ 1 cm in greatest dimension Surgical resection, Neoadjuvant PD1-PDL1 inhibition Stage IA2 T1b N0 M0 • Tumor ≤ 1 cm in greatest dimension Surgical resection, Neoadjuvant PD1-PDL1 inhibition Stage IA3 T1c N0 M0 • Tumor > 2 cm but ≤ 3 cm in greatest dimension Surgical resection, Neoadjuvant PD1-PDL1 inhibition Stage IB T2a N0 M0 • Tumor with any of the following features: involvement of the main bronchus regardless of the distance from the carina; invasion of the visceral pleura; associated with partial or complete lung atelectasis or pneumonitis • Tumor > 3 cm but ≤ 4 cm in greatest dimension Surgical resection, Neoadjuvant PD1-PDL1 inhibition Stage IIA T2b N0 M0 • Tumor > 4 cm but ≤ 5 cm in greatest dimension Surgical resection, Neoadjuvant PD1-PDL1 inhibition Stage IIB T1a-c T2a T2b T3 N1 N1 N1 N0 M0 M0 M0 M0 • Metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial and/or ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes and intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension • Tumor > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm in greatest dimension or one that directly invades any of the following structures: parietal pleura, chest wall (including superior sulcus tumors), phrenic nerve, parietal pericardium; or separate tumor nodule or nodules in the same lobe Surgical resection, Neoadjuvant PD1-PDL1 inhibition Stage IIIA T1a-c T2a-b T3 T4 T4 N2 N2 N1 N0 N1 M0 M0 M0 M0 M0 • Tumor measuring > 7 cm in greatest dimensions that invades any of the following structures: mediastinum, diaphragm, heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, vertebral body, carina; or separate tumor nodules or nodules in a different lobe of the same lung Chemotherapy followed by radiation or surgery, Neoadjuvant PD1-PDL1 inhibition Stage IIIB T1a-c T2a-b T3 T4 N3 N3 N2 N2 M0 M0 M0 M0 • Metastasis in contralateral mediastinal, contralateral hilar, ipsilateral or contralateral scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes • Metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes Combination of chemotherapy and radiation, Neoadjuvant PD1-PDL1 inhibition Stage IIIC T3 T4 N3 N3 M0 M0 • Metastasis in contralateral mediastinal, contralateral hilar, ipsilateral or contralateral scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes • Metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes Combination of chemotherapy and radiation, Neoadjuvant PD1-PDL1 inhibition Stage IVA Any T Any T Any N Any N M1a M1b • Separate tumor nodules or nodules in the contralateral lung; malignant pleural effusion or pleural thickening or nodules or masses; malignant pericardial effusion or pericardial thickening or nodules or masses • Single distant (extrathoracic) metastasis in a single organ Chemotherapy and palliative care with combination of either PD1-PDL1 or PD1-CTLA4 Stage IVB Any T Any N M1c • Multiple distant (extrathoracic) metastases in a single organ or multiple organs Chemotherapy and palliative care with a combination of either PD1-PDL1 or PD1-CTLA4 Although the 8 th th 171 181 th 171 181 th th 182 5 Table 5 TNM stage classification as recommended in the 9th edition of the TNM classification for lung cancer [ 182 183 T/M Label N0 N1 N2 N3 N2a N2b T1 T1a ≤ 1 cm IA1 IIA IIB IIIA IIIB T1ab > 1 to ≤ 2 cm IA2 IIA IIB IIIA IIIB T1c > 2 to ≤ 3 cm IA3 IIA IIB IIIA IIIB T2 T2a Visceral pleura, central invasion IB IIB IIIA IIIB IIIB T2a > 3 to ≤ 4 cm IB IIB IIIA IIIB IIIB T2b > 4 to ≤ 5 cm IIA IIB IIIA IIIB IIIB T3 T3 > 5 to ≤ 7 cm IIB IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIC T3 Invasion IIB IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIC T3 Same lobe tumor nodules IIB IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIC T4 T4 > 7 cm IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIB IIIC T4 invasion IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIB IIIC T4 Ipsilateral tumor nodules IIIA IIIA IIIB IIIB IIIC M1 M1a Contralateral nodules IVA IVA IVA IVA IVA M1a Pleural, pericardial effusion IVA IVA IVA IVA IVA M1b Single extra-thoracic lesion IVA IVA IVA IVA IVA M1c1 Multiple extra-thoracic lesions in a single organ system IVB IVB IVB IVB IVB M1c2 Multiple extra-thoracic lesions in multiple organ system IVB IVB IVB IVB IVB Metastatic patterns and organotropism Metastatic patterns refer to the characteristic distribution and timing of cancer spread to distant organs.

efficacy and safety data pending To broaden the applicability of ICIs—specifically anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 agents across a larger patient population, several combination strategies have been evaluated. These include dual ICI regimens (anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 combined with an anti-CTLA-4 such as ipilimumab or tremelimumab), with or without a short course of chemotherapy, as well as combinations of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents with chemotherapy [ 283 285 283 285 EGFR ALK 11 Additionally, ADCs have been investigated as a novel treatment strategy for non-oncogene-driven NSCLC, though their benefits have been limited beyond HER2-driven tumors [ 265 P 286 P 287 Furthermore, for patients with poor performance status (ECOG ≥ 2) who are ineligible for platinum-doublet chemotherapy, the phase III IPSOS trial demonstrated that single-agent ICIs, such as atezolizumab, provide superior outcomes and improved tolerability compared with single-agent chemotherapy [ 288 269 289 291 292 Non-genetic factors promoting metastatic NSCLC The immune system's homeostasis and the dynamic processes occurring within the TME are overly complex, posing a considerable challenge to fully understand the functional interactions between immune cells and tumors. Additionally, accurately characterizing the phenotypes of tumor-associated immune cells and their responses following anticancer treatment remains a significant challenge [ 293 294 Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible biological process and an initial step in metastasis in which epithelial cells drop their epithelial characteristics (such as cell–cell adhesion, polarity, and the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin) and acquire mesenchymal properties (including encouraged overexpression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin) along with altered expression of cell adhesion molecules and changes in the cytoskeleton [ 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 4 Fig. 4 Key signaling pathways driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in NSCLC, including integrin-ECM interactions, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog (SHH), inflammatory cytokines (IL-6), and hypoxia-induced responses. All these pathways converge to drive EMT, enhancing cancer cell invasiveness, metastasis, and therapy resistance, adopted from ref. [ 296 297 https://BioRender.com/3zji3ge In NSCLC-related studies, researchers have found that the EMT process is linked to enhanced cancer cells’ plasticity, invasiveness, resistance to therapy, and poor prognosis [ 303 306 307 308 309 LSL-Kras G12D LKB1 fl/fl Several EMT-inducing TFs, including zinc-finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and TWIST, have also been clinically implicated in NSCLC metastasis [ 310 313 314 + 315 Moreover, the direct role of EMT in regulating PD-L1 expression through epigenetic reprogramming has been correlated with immune evasion in NSCLC [ 316 317 318 319 320 Furthermore, an elevated presence of tumor-infiltrating CD4 + + 321 321 322 323 Collectively, the EMT-driven axis of metastasis, immune modulation, and therapeutic resistance underscores its potential as a critical therapeutic target in the management of aggressive NSCLC phenotypes.

Various signaling molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and extracellular vehicles (EVs), mediate these interactions. CSCs receive regulatory signals from different TME components, including Wnt, Notch, c-Met, TGF-β, VEGF, SDF-1, IL-6, and IL-8, which facilitate tumor progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance. The ECM plays a crucial role in regulating intracellular signaling pathways, altering drug diffusion, providing protection from immunosurveillance, and modifying the tumor's mechanical properties. The arrows represent the bidirectional communication between CSCs and the TME, contributing to tumor heterogeneity and disease progression. These dynamic interactions promote CSC intrinsic properties, including stemness, self-renewal, survival, angiogenesis, EMT, drug resistance, and quiescence, as illustrated based on insights from published literature [ 353 https://BioRender.com/pe728gg In NSCLC cases, up to 63% of patients have been reported to exhibit histologic heterogeneity (more than one histologic subtype). This observation supports the hypothesis that lung cancer originates from a multipotent stem-like cell capable of differentiating into various cell types, leading to various observed histological patterns [ 354 KRAS G12D 355 356 357 + + 358 To identify CSCs in lung cancer, specific biomarkers have been characterized, including ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), CD166/Nanog homeobox (NANOG), CD133/prominin 1 (PROM1), CD44, CD117/KIT, and POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1, formerly known as OCT3/4) [ 359 360 high high 361 355 362 9 Table 9 Putative cancer stem cells markers reported in NSCLC Class of biomarker Name of biomarker Description and cellular/molecular function of putative or identified CSC biomarkers in NSCLC Ref Cluster of differentiation (CD) CD44 • Type I transmembrane glycoprotein (85–250 kDa) • Binds to variety of ligands on the cell surface, including hyaluronic acid • Trigger multiple cellular processes such as cell–cell signaling, cell growth and differentiation, cell adhesion and migration, angiogenesis, or cell survival • Associated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype, with the ability to metastasize and resist chemotherapy [ 381 382 CD117 • Type I transmembrane glycoprotein (approximately 145 kDa) • Activate tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor • Self-renewal and chemoresistance [ 383 384 CD133, also named Prominin 1 (PROM1) • Cholesterol-binding five-fold transmembrane glycoprotein (97–120 kDa) • Essential to maintain CSCs characteristics such as tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and the ability to resist chemotherapy [ 385 387 CD166 • Type I transmembrane glycoprotein (100–105 kDa) member of the immunoglobulin superfamily • Activate leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) [ 388 389 Surface markers, not CD CXCR4 • G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane protein (40–70 kDa) • Support chemokine receptor expression followed by enhanced invasiveness and metastasis • Support CSC self-renewal activity and tumorigenicity in vivo [ 357 390 ALDH • Functioned through ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 isotypes • ALDH1 activity promotes CSCs features including proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation, resistance to chemotherapy • ALDH3A1 overexpression drives cancer stem cell expansion, Impairing immune surveillance via enhanced PD-L1 expression [ 391 392 BMI-1 • A protooncogene of polycomb group family member • Represses the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and promotes cell proliferation [ 393 EpCAM • Single transmembrane protein (30–40 kDa) • Participates in cell–cell contact adhesion strength and tissue plasticity • Increased the metastatic capacity of tumor cells [ 394 ABCG2 • Half transporter (approximately 72 kDa) composed of six transmembrane domains and only one ATP-binding domain • Transportation of xenobiotic compounds into the extracellular space and associated with cancer relapses and poor prognosis [ 395 Transcription factors Oct-4, also known as POU5F1 • Member of the POU transcription factor family (16.4 kb) • Target Fgf4 Utf1 Opn Rex1/Zfp42 Fbx15 [ 396 Sox2 • Member of the high mobility group (HMG) box gene family (~ 2.4 kb) encoded by the sex-determining region Y-box gene • Regulate the transcription of the c-MYC, Wnt and Notch oncogenes and increase metastatic capacity through the FGFR-ERK1/2-SOX2 signaling pathway • Sox2 and Oct-4 enhance CD133 expression under hypoxia, promoting self-renewal and maintenance of lung CSCs [ 397 399 Nanog • DNA binding homeobox transcription factor (~ 150 kb) • DNA-binding homeobox transcription factor • Upregulated by Nr5a2 promoting CSCs properties and tumorigenesis in NSCLC [ 400 Where, CD44 CD117 CD133 CD166 CXCR4 ALDH BMI-1 EpCAM ABCG2 Oct-4 In lung CSCs, developmental singaling pathways, such as Hedgehog, Wnt, and Notch pathways, play crucial roles in the regulation of key mechanisms, including self-renewal and differentiation [ 363 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 365 PTEN 375 376 + + 326 377 Moreover, metastatic cancer stem cells (mCSCs), a subset of CSCs, can respond to signals from the ECM of distant organs, enabling them to escape the primary tumor and contribute to metastasis [ 378 379 301 EGFR 380 Conclusively, CSCs play a pivotal function in NSCLC metastasis and therapy resistance due to their immunosuppressive properties and reliance on key developmental signaling such as Hedgehog, Notch, and Wnt pathways. Despite advances in identifying CSC biomarkers, challenges persist in establishing robust and reproducible biomarkers for effectively targeting CSCs. Besides, addressing CSC heterogeneity and their interactions with the immune cells in the TME is also important for developing innovative therapeutic approaches to transform NSCLC treatment, reduce recurrence, and improve overall survival in cancer patients.

In this context, Li et al. and co-workers [ 428 428 429 430 In conclusion, ncRNAs play pivotal functions in influencing the tumor microenvironment by modulating gene expression, EMT, CSCs, and immune interactions, thereby contributing to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. An innate understanding of their production and molecular mechanisms offers promising avenues for the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers and targeted therapies designed to improve overall survival outcomes in NSCLC patients. Immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is a vastly ambiguous environment, mainly comprising inflammatory cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and ECM, and is directly associated with multiplex biological events in tumors [ 446 447 449 450 451 + + 452 453 454 455 Like other tumor types, NSCLC can initiate and sustain an immunosuppressive TME favorable to tumor growth [ 456 458 459 460 356 461 462 356 462 Tumor-associated immunosuppressive cells Cancer-associated fibroblasts Fibroblasts are the most common and heterogeneous population of stromal cell types in solid tumors [ 463 464 465 466 467 468 469 470 471 6 . Fig. 6 Schematic illustrating the crosstalk between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), cancer cells, and major immune cell groups within the tumor microenvironment (TME). CAFs interact with various immune cells—including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), dendritic cells (DCs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), natural killer (NK) cells, and CD8⁺ T cells—to promote tumor development through the secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and other effector molecules such as TGF-β, IL-6, CCL2, and CXCL2. Notably, TAMs, TANs, and mast cells (MCs) reciprocally contribute to the formation of an immunosuppressive circuit by activating CAFs and enhancing their tumor-supportive functions [ 476 477 https://BioRender.com/3o71yeo In NSCLC, discrete functional subsets of transcriptomically distinct CAF phenotypes, such as high desmoplastic CAFs (HD-CAFs) and low desmoplastic CAFs (LD-CAFs), have been identified [ 472 474 474 326 475 476 476 477 478 Furthermore, the role of glycosylation and epigenetics in CAFs has also been reported in the promotion of metastasis in NSCLC cells. For instance, Fengzhou Li et al. [ 479 479 6 6 480 481 482 In summary, the diverse functional subsets of CAFs in NSCLC, along with their ability to remodel the extracellular matrix, secrete key signaling molecules, and regulate glycosylation and epigenetic modifications, underscore their vital role in tumor progression and metastasis. A deeper understanding of CAFs’ phenotypes and their interactions with NSCLC cells could offer novel therapeutic strategies for targeting CAF-driven mechanisms in NSCLC treatment. Dendritic cells Dendritic cells (DCs) are a major class of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and actively participate in T cell activation and differentiation, which is a crucial step in commencing anti-tumor immune responses [ 483 484 In the context of NSCLC, tumor-derived DCs exhibit overexpression of the T cell co-inhibitory molecule B7-H3, which belongs to the programmed death ligand (PD-L) family, and show reduced stimulation of T cell proliferation compared to controls [ 485 485 486 487 488 489 490 Conclusively, targeting the immunosuppressive mechanisms in DCs or reversing DC dysfunction could enhance anti-tumor immunity, offering a promising avenue for immunotherapeutic strategies in mNSCLC. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immature cells comprising myeloid progenitor cells, immature DCs, immature macrophages, and immature granulocytes, all of which exhibit potent immunosuppressive activity in the TME [ 491 492 + − hi + + low 493 494 491 494 496 In NSCLC cases, a higher number of circulating M-MDSC expressing C–C Chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) have been identified in the peripheral blood of patients compared to healthy donors. Additionally, the incidence of both M-MDSCs and PMN-MDSCs was more prevalent in NSCLC tissues than in peripheral blood [ 497 498 499 499 + 499 500 501 502 503 505 506 507 508 + + 509 510 Conclusively, different subtypes of MSDCs appear to adopt distinct mechanisms to promote NSCLC metastasis. As limited studies have explored the role of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs in NSCLC, the identification of regulatory factors in MDSCs could provide valuable insights into the immunosuppressive TME associated with mNSCLC. Tumor-associated macrophages Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute the general population of innate immune cells in the TME that perform multiple tumor-supporting functions during all stages of carcinogenesis, from cancer onset to post-therapeutic metastatic relapse [ 511 512 513 514 406 515 517 343 518 519 520 432 Moreover, TAMs constitute an important source of cytokines in the TIME [ 521 522 524 525 526 330 330 330 Furthermore, TGR5 (also known as GPBAR1) was found on infiltrated TAMs, where it affects anti-tumor immunity by contributing to TAM-mediated blockage of CD8 + 527 528 + + 529 + 529 In a recent comparative study between nivolumab-sensitive and nivolumab-resistant NSCLC patients, the latter exhibited a high infiltration of M2-type TAMs and a lower density of CD8 + 530 530 531 532 Overall, M2-type TAMs decisively contribute to NSCLC progression and metastasis by promoting immune evasion. Therefore, understanding the specific cellular signaling pathways that drive polarization from the immunostimulatory (M1) to the immunosuppressive (M2) TAM phenotype, and subsequent adopted pathways, could enhance our understanding of NSCLC metastasis. Regulatory T Cells Regulatory T Cells (Tregs), an immunosuppressive subgroup of CD4 + 533 534 + 535 536 537 540 Notably, in murine models of NSCLC (lung ADC subtype), Tregs were identified to inhibit the CD8 + 541 541 542 + 543 544 545 Similarly, an increase in number of Tregs and activity was detected in multiple tissues of NSCLC patients, such as LNM and the peripheral blood, and was profoundly associated with tumor staging and recurrence frequency of NSCLC metastasis [ 546 549 546 550 551 + − 552 553 554 555 + 542 Altogether, these discoveries underscore the significance of Treg infiltration into tumors in promoting immunosuppression, tumor progression, and metastasis in NSCLC. However, precise molecular mechanisms behind their recruitment and distinct functions in the immunosuppressive TME remain poorly defined in NSCLC. Addressing these gaps—particularly their heterogeneity and interactions within the TME—could advance immunotherapy for primary and advanced NSCLC cases. T Helper 17 cells T Helper 17 (Th17) cells, a subset of effector T helper cells (CD4 + 556 557 558 559 556 557 331 560 In summary, Th17 cells via IL-17 drive inflammation, immune evasion, EMT, metastasis, and angiogenesis in NSCLC, highlighting their crucial role in tumor progression and as a potential therapeutic target. Due to limited available findings on Th17 in mNSCLC cases, further research insights are required to decipher the upstream regulatory networks that govern Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17 secretion within the TME of NSCLC. Tumor-associated neutrophils Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are infiltrating subsets of neutrophils found within tumors. Initially, TANs are recruited from the peripheral neutrophil pool by chemokines and subsequently transferred to the tumor stroma [ 561 562 564 Within the TME of NSCLC, TANs are among the most abundant immune cells [ 450 450 565 566 567 TANs were also reported to induce EMT of lung ADC cells in vitro and enhance their migration activity [ 568 569 570 + 571 572 In conclusion, TANs can promote NSCLC progression and metastasis based on the TME. Given the limited research available on TAN functions in NSCLC metastasis, further studies are needed to elucidate the involved cellular and molecular pathways mediating the phenotype and functional plasticity of TANs in NSCLC patients. Outlook and challenges NSCLC is a slow-progressing yet persistent and heterogeneous disease driven by a combination of somatic mutations and epigenetic dysregulation in key oncogene-associated signaling pathways. This heterogeneity allows NSCLC to acquire metastatic capabilities, making metastasis a major contributor to its high mortality rate. Unfortunately, the specific cellular communications and molecular pathways that enable the expansion of an immunosuppressive state during NSCLC metastasis—along with the mechanisms that allow tumor cells to detach from primary sites, evade immune surveillance, and establish colonization at distant metastatic sites—remain principally unclear. However, based on the available research, it can be estimated that specific NSCLC metastasis may be influenced by tumor genetic heterogeneity as well as the activity and population of immune cells in the TME. While these factors have been partially validated, significant progress could be achieved by mapping cellular heterogeneity, clonal expansion, and the dynamic functional alterations or communications among various cells within the TME that promote tumorigenesis. This might be accomplished through rapid analysis of spatial and single-cell transcriptomics data using advanced deep learning generative models. Artificial intelligence and omics integration in NSCLC management Clinically, radiomics techniques are the standard approach for detecting lung cancer metastasis, modalities such as PET, CT, and MRI to predict tumor biology, cancer subtype, treatment response, and prognosis [ 573 574 574 198 Advances in diagnostic techniques, such as immunohistochemical analysis using biomarkers like TTF-1, p63, p40, and cytokeratin 5/6, have significantly enhanced the accuracy of NSCLC subtyping. Additionally, substantial efforts have been made to integrate multi-omics approaches, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, for a deeper understanding of the molecular signatures unique to NSCLC subtypes. For instance, proteogenomic and histological analysis reveals that regardless of specific histologic classification, NSCLC subtypes exhibiting overexpression of the PI3K/Akt pathway are associated with a higher propensity for metastasis and poorer survival outcomes [ 575 48 38 Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)–based pathology have led to promising advances in lung cancer management, including quantitative analysis of histopathological features, prediction of biomarkers, and immunotherapy efficacy [ 576 580 581 583 584 585 EGFR 586 589 590 , EGFR and KRAS 591 592 594 595 582 596 597 598 599 603 Accumulating evidence in tumor biology indicates that the primary tumor's microenvironment may hold predictive value for future metastatic progression [ 166 604 605 98 606 Alongside the discovery of prognostic gene signatures, gene expression profiling has also revealed functional drivers of NSCLC metastasis. By comparing the expression profiles of highly metastatic cells with their weakly metastatic isogenic counterparts, researchers have efficiently identified candidate metastasis regulators, including both metastasis-promoting [ 607 608 609 610 611 612 613 614 615 615 616 577 Conclusively, AI emerges as a transformative tool in the clinical management of NSCLC, enabling the integration of radiomics, pathology, and multi-omics data to decode tumor-immune dynamics and predict therapeutic outcomes. However, one of the major obstacles to effective AI implementation is the lack of high-quality training data—often limited by high acquisition costs, stringent privacy regulations, and restricted data sharing, particularly about novel drug targets or treatments [ 617 618 TNM staging and oligometastatic stratification Recently, the IASLC published the 9 th th th 619 620 621 th 621 th th 621 The concept of oligometastatic disease has emerged as a distinct clinical state that lies between localized cancer and widespread systemic metastases. It represents an intermediate phase in the metastatic cascade, where the tumor has begun to spread but remains limited in number and location, potentially allowing for curative-intent treatment. Within this framework, further subclassifications have been proposed to capture the dynamic nature of metastatic disease evolution. For instance, oligoprogression refers to the progression of several metastatic lesions in an otherwise stable background of oligometastatic or even polymetastatic disease. In contrast, oligopersistent disease describes an induced state in which previously polymetastatic disease responds to therapy and is reduced to fewer than five active metastatic sites—a concept that has been reviewed in recent literature [ 622 th th th 182 623 624 626 627 628 628 628 Clinically, a commonly used criterion to distinguish oligometastatic from polymetastatic disease is the presence of up to five PET-defined distant metastases [ 629 631 632 633 634 635 Looking forward, future iterations of the TNM system may benefit from formally integrating molecular, radiomic, and immunologic biomarkers to better stratify metastatic disease beyond traditional anatomical criteria. Such a multidimensional approach could enable more personalized treatment strategies, enhance prognostic precision, and refine the selection criteria for local ablative therapies and systemic interventions in oligometastatic patients. Altogether, these insights emphasize the need for individualized assessment, ideally guided by prospective trials, histological and molecular profiling, and expert clinical judgment. Therapeutic challenges and rethinking immunotherapy Clinical management of NSCLC has undergone a major transformation with the identification of actionable oncogenic drivers and the development of corresponding molecular-targeted therapies (TKIs), shifting treatment paradigms from a purely histology-based approach to molecular-targeted therapies [ 636 638 269 639 642 In oncogene-addicted NSCLC, a key challenge of the precision medicine era is understanding and overcoming the development of resistance to targeted therapies, particularly those involving TKIs. In this direction, several intrinsic factors have been associated with therapeutic resistance in NSCLC [ 643 644 EGFR 645 MET 646 647 MET 648 EGFR 4 649 ALK KRAS, RET 650 652 EGFR 647 653 646 654 ALK ROS1 655 656 EGFR 657 659 KRAS G12C 660 661 662 The advancements of immunotherapies alone or in combination with chemotherapy have ushered in a new era in medicine, enabling improved management of advanced-stage NSCLC [ 275 663 665 EGFR ALK ROS1 MET KRAS STK11/LKB1 666 667 11 277 668 289 292 292 669 665 NCT04656652 670 NCT05089734 671 Aside from PD-L1, the only other FDA-approved biomarker for solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab (as of 2020) is tumor mutational burden (TMB) [ 672 673 674 673 676 675 677 678 679 680 662 681 To address resistance, the SITC has outlined three distinct scenarios of resistance to PD-1 pathway blockade: primary resistance, secondary resistance, and progression after treatment discontinuation [ 682 680 683 680 683 679 679 684 685 In summary, the poor prognosis and outcome in mNSCLC can be attributed to four key factors: (i) tumor cell dispersal and survival in a \"hostile\" environment, including rare metastatic sites, which may promote highly aggressive tumor cell phenotypes; (ii) challenges in treating mNSCLC at unusual sites, especially when metastasis occurs in a single distant location; (iii) limited targeted therapy efficacy due to the emergence of new genomic alterations in a subset of cases; and (iv) inevitable resistance development following prolonged molecular therapy, often involving additional oncogenic driver mutations. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiological and molecular networks in mNSCLC is essential. Gaining deeper insight into cellular and immune-related mechanisms will be crucial for the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. In this perspective, Genomic profiling plays a crucial role in guiding first-line treatment decisions for patients with advanced NSCLC. Obtaining a comprehensive molecular profile of the tumor before starting treatment is essential for several reasons: (1) to accurately identify and initiate the most effective therapy, given the superior outcomes observed with first-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) compared to chemotherapy in patients with oncogene-driven tumors [ 686 687 688 689 691 Immune dynamics and challenges in NSCLC With the rise of single-cell sequencing and spatial omics, the comprehensive participation of TME in the initiation, progression, and development of lung cancer has been recognized [ 305 692 604 693 694 695 696 + + 697 + + + + + 698 Notably, immune cell infiltration in the tumor is also dependent on the TNM stage [ 450 451 + 696 699 700 701 High PD-L1 expression is also frequently observed in NSCLC tumor cells [ 702 703 704 KRAS LKB1/STK11 705 706 316 STK11 707 708 Moreover, the major subtypes of NSCLC, SCC and ADC, have been shown to exhibit distinct transcriptomic profiles and TMEs [ 709 711 450 712 Lkb1 fl/fl ( ); Pten fl/fl Sox2 LSL/LSL Pten fl/fl ; Cdkn2ab fl/fl 713 714 EGFR KRAS 715 716 717 Given the conditions, understanding the complex crosstalk among immune cells, cancer cells, and the TME across disease stages—and elucidating the molecular mechanisms that promote tumor progression—may yield new prognostic markers and enable the development of more effective combination therapies aimed at restoring anti-tumor immunity. In this direction, integrating deep learning models with clinical data—including pre-treatment PET/CT scans, TNM staging, and tumor localization—alongside immune profiling (e.g., TAM and TAN interactions, co-stimulatory signaling dynamics) within the NSCLC microenvironment, may substantially improve prognostication and risk identification in diagnosed cancer patients. Limitations of humanized mouse models in NSCLC research Despite much attention given to the development of new therapies for cancer, many patients either do not respond or experience disease relapses after an initial positive response. The foremost challenge is the lack of suitable human specimens for research, and secondly, there is a limited understanding of the specific therapy resistance mechanisms that emerge during antineoplastic treatment. These limitations underscore the need for models that can accurately replicate efficacy and resistance (both primary and acquired) to the selected treatment(s). In this direction, recent reviews have emphasized the strengths and weaknesses of existing metastasis models [ 718 721 Over the past decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing preclinical cancer models, including cell line-derived xenografts (CDX), patient-derived xenografts (PDX), genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM), and NOD scid gamma mice (NSG), to advance understanding of mNSCLC biology and pathogenesis [ 722 725 725 728 KRAS p53 ALK 729 731 721 732 733 734 11 null 735 736 737 NPRL2 KRAS/STK11 Table 11 Humanized mouse models in metastatic NSCLC therapeutic studies Tumor Type Mouse Strain (genotype) Humanized approach Therapy strategy Ref KRAS/STK11 NSG (NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl Human CD34⁺ HSCs from cord blood injected into irradiated NSG mice NPRL2 ± anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) [ 737 EGFR MET NSG (NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl PBMC-engrafted humanized model Pemetrexed + CD73 inhibition [ 750 KRAS/LKB1 STK11 NSG (NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl CD34 + Combined therapy: systemic tumor suppressor gene (TUSC2/NPRL2) nanovesicles + chemotherapy (carboplatin) + anti–PD-1 (pembrolizumab) [ 751 Human NSCLC (AXL + HuNOG-EXL (NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid l2rg null IL-3/GM-CSF-transgenic) CD34 + NOG-EXL mice (humanized NOG-EXL) CAR T cells targeting AXL, combined with local microwave ablation [ 752 Human NSCLC cell line Xenografts (EGFR-mutant and wild-type lines, PDL1 high/low NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdc scid tm1Wjl Adoptive transfer of Activated human T cells Engineered with a PD-L1 − specific CAR CAR T-cell immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 CAR, ± low-dose radiotherapy) [ 753 Metastatic NSCLC (CDX) NSG (NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl Human CD34⁺ HSCs → reconstituted immune system Ex vivo expanded DNT (double-negative T cell) therapy [ 736 Human NSCLC xenografts (cell-line and PDX; subcutaneous and metastatic models) NSG (NOD.Cg- Prkdc scid Il2rg tm1Wjl Fresh cord blood CD34 + HSC transplant (4–8 week engraftment) Anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab, nivolumab) [ 754 Human NSCLC PDX (patient derived Tumor xenografts) NSG (NOD.

For instance, mouse models of cancer often failed to accurately recapitulate fundamental aspects of tumor biology, TME, and therapeutic responses—including resistance mechanisms—when compared to clinical outcomes. One illustrative case is the use of NPRL2 KRAS/STK11 737 739 + 740 741 706 742 743 In transplantation studies, the growth behavior of human xenografts can vary significantly within the murine host, suggesting that in vivo experiments may be more reflective of experimental conditions rather than the intrinsic behavior of human tumor cells. Also, the short time frames used to evaluate tumor response in these models limit conclusions about long-term efficacy, durability of response, and mechanisms of immune escape. Available studies suggest that lung CSCs contribute to therapy resistance via several mechanisms, including asymmetric cell division, slow division kinetics or quiescence, and the expression of drug efflux pumps and DNA repair proteins [ 744 746 747 Nonetheless, despite ongoing variability in outcomes and persistent uncertainties regarding the translational relevance of preclinical animal models to human clinical settings, a growing body of evidence supports the utility of humanized mouse models as valuable tools for investigating the role of immune cell populations in tumor control and for assessing the efficacy of immunotherapies [ 748 749 Conclusion Given the complexity and clinical challenges associated with NSCLC diagnosis and treatment, future research must prioritize unravelling the immune profiles of organ-specific metastases. Additionally, identifying novel molecular drivers and biomarkers will be crucial for advancing general and/or personalized therapies. In this direction, emerging technologies such as CRISPR, spatial single-cell sequencing, and integrative multi-omics hold an immense promise for elucidating intratumoral heterogeneity and the plasticity of cancer and immune cells. Moreover, an innate understanding of EMT dynamics and immune evasion during metastasis could also provide insights into the development of new combinatorial therapeutic strategies targeting both cancer cells and immunosuppressive TME. For instance, new immunotherapy strategies might include targeting tumor-associated immune cells, for example, to enhance the infiltration of functional T cells or regenerate their anti-tumor function, in combination with therapy to inhibit the pro-tumorigenic functions of specific cells in the TME. Considering the complexity of the mechanisms governing the infiltration, activation, and survival of various tumor-associated immune cells within the TME of NSCLC subtypes, and the fact that these mechanisms may differ between patients due to physiology and/or pathological state, further investigation is needed to understand the regulatory roles of tumor-associated immune cells in the TME. Additionally, identifying reliable biomarkers or assays for monitoring immune responses in NSCLC requires further exploration. With accumulating clinical experience and advancing scientific research, collaborative efforts among pathologists, oncologists, and researchers are essential to refining classification standards, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and ultimately improving clinical outcomes and personalized care strategies for NSCLC patients.
