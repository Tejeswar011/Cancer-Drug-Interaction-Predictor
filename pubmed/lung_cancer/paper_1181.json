With reports indicating nanoparticles’ ability to pass through key biological barriers—gastrointestinal, lung, skin, blood-brain and the placenta barriers—the question of their safety, particularly the risks associated with embryonic development, arises. The aim of this article is to verify the impact of ZnO nanoparticles, which are commonly used and considered to be safe for adult organisms on the developing embryo. In the current study, the influence of the dose and shape of ZnO nanoparticles (oval vs. long) was evaluated in the chicken embryo model. The oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase (SOD)) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonylated protein ((CP) levels), and gene expression changes (full genomic microarray study) were tested. We found that at both doses (10 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL, 100 µL into the air chamber) neither elongated nor oval ZnO nanoparticles changed in ovo mortality. Long ZnO nanoparticles had a lesser and more delayed impact on evaluated parameters, regardless of their higher in vitro toxicity. However, both nanoparticle forms induced changes in the oxidoreductive potential and affected expression of a significant number (1487 for oval and 548 for long ZnO nanoparticles) of identified genes during early embryo development.

Introduction Nanoparticles (NPs) are materials that in at least one dimension have a size in the range of 1 nm to 100 nm [ 1 2 3 4 5 Some of the most popular NPs that are used in industry and in everyday products are ZnO NPs [ 2 6 2+ 7 8 9 7 10 7 11 12 The toxicological assessment of nanoparticles has been extensively discussed in the scientific literature. However, variations in experimental models, administered doses, nanoparticle provenance, and manufacturing techniques—which frequently result in distinct physicochemical characteristics—complicate the integration and direct comparison of the available datasets. In a zebrafish embryo model [ 13 2+ 7 2+ 14 15 16 ROS are molecules formed as a result of incomplete reduction or excitation of oxygen (O 2 2 − 2 2 17 18 2 − 2 2 2 19 20 21 22 23 24 ROS react with lipids present in cell membranes, leading to their peroxidation. As a result of this reaction, lipid hydroperoxides and various aldehydes are formed, including malondialdehyde (MDA) and propionaldehyde. These molecules can act as signalling compounds, activating cellular protective (antioxidant) mechanisms. However, their excessive accumulation leads to autophagy, apoptosis, or cell death [ 25 26 Therefore, the aim of the current article is to test the effect of the dose and shape of ZnO NPs obtained by the hydrothermal method on oxidative stress and to evaluate their impact level of changes at the genomic level, using an in ovo chicken embryo model. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Nanoparticle Synthesis Two types of ZnO NPs were synthesised using the microwave hydrothermal method: undoped long ZnO (ZnO LONG) and oval ZnO doped with 0.5% mol of europium (ZnO OVAL). Distinct microwave hydrothermal processes were employed, utilising various chemical reagents and conducted at different pressures ( Table 1 27 The resulting precipitate was then filtered and thoroughly washed with distilled water. After washing, it was transferred into a Teflon vessel, which was filled with distilled water up to 80% of its volume, in preparation for the microwave hydrothermal treatment. The hydrothermal reaction, assisted with microwaves, was carried out in a Magnum II reactor (Ertec, Poland) equipped with 700 W microwave heating. Operational parameters were controlled using Magnum V2 software (version 1.9.8.14). For the undoped ZnO LONG, the process was conducted under a pressure of 6 MPa, while the Eu-doped ZnO OVAL NPs were subjected to a pressure of 8 MPa. The maximum temperature was set at 300 °C, and the hydrothermal process lasted for 20 min. After reaction, the products were transferred to a crystalliser and dried at 60 °C for 24 h. Final step involved mechanical grinding of the dried product using an agate mortar. 2.2. Experimental Methods for Nanoparticle Characterisation The crystalline phase of the NPs was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis conducted on a Panalytical X’Pert Powder Diffractometer (Westborough, MA, USA) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54060 Å). Data were collected in the range of 20° ≤ 2θ ≤ 70° at RT, using a step size of 0.05°. The surface morphology and size distribution of the ZnO NPs were examined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), utilising a Hitachi SU-70 (Hitachi High-Tech Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), with a resolution step of 1 nm. This device was equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector for elemental composition analysis, as well as a GATAN Mono CL3 system for cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. Additionally, the photoluminescence emission (PL) and excitation (PLE) spectra of the ZnO nanoparticles were measured at RT using a Horiba/Jobin-Yvon Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer. The setup included a 450 W xenon lamp as the excitation source, an iHR550 monochromator for wavelength selection, and a Hamamatsu R928P photomultiplier for detection. The electrostatic stability and dispersity of ZnO nanoparticles in suspension were examined by assessing their zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter. Measurements were performed at ambient conditions (~25 °C) using a Zetasizer Ultra system (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK), equipped with modules for dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering (ELS). Nanoparticles were initially dispersed in deionised water, followed by ultrasonic processing using Sonic VCCX500 system (Sonic and Materials Inc., Newtown, CT, USA) operated for 4 min, to minimise agglomerate formation. All measurements were performed without pH modification. Each sample was measured five times, and the results were expressed as average values with standard deviations. 2.3. Isolation of Chicken Embryo Fibroblasts (CEFs) Primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) were isolated from 12-day-old chicken embryos, following the protocol described by Hernandez and Brown [ 28 TM 6 2 2 2.4. Cell Viability Measurement CEFs were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 6 2.5. In Ovo Experimental Model ZnO NPs of both long (ZnO LONG) and oval (ZnO:Eu–ZnO OVAL) shapes were used for biological studies at two concentrations 10 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL in PBS). As an experimental model, the in ovo model was used; after drilling a hole in the shell, the NPs suspensions (100 µL per egg) were administrated to the air chamber [ 7 Figure 1 To verify the distribution of Zn concentration after administration of ZnO nanoparticles using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS), the collection of embryos and egg white samples was performed at days 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of incubation. Based on the results from the AAS, the measurement of activity of SOD and content of protein carbonyl and MDA as the markers of the oxidative stress was performed for chicken embryos between days 4 and 10 of incubation ( Figure 1 2.6. Measurement of Zn Concentration with Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) Chicken embryos and egg white samples, isolated at days 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of incubation following in ovo application of ZnO LONG or ZnO OVAL NPs (10 and 100 μg/mL) or PBS (CTRL), were weighed and transferred into high-pressure vessels. Each sample was treated with 2 mL of 65% nitric acid and 1 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (Merck, Poznań, Poland) and left for 18 h. Mineralisation was then performed using the Ethos 900 microwave digestion system (Milestone, Sorisole, Italy). Zinc concentrations in the digested samples were determined using AAS (PerkinElmer 1100B, Shelton, CT, USA). Experimental data was collected from 7 to 22 eggs for each experimental group per each day, with experiments conducted in 2–3 repetitions. 2.7. Confocal Microscopy To assess the fluorescence of the nanoparticles and to confirm the distribution of ZnO OVAL nanoparticles within the tissues of developing embryos, confocal microscopy was employed. Chicken embryos were collected on days 5, 7, and 10 of incubation. The embryos were fixed in formalin for 24 h. and subsequently transferred to 70% ethanol. For paraffin embedding, the samples were processed through a graded ethanol series (70%, 80%, 96%, 100%), followed by xylene, and finally infiltrated with paraffin using a tissue processor (STP 120, Microm, Walldorf, Germany). The paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned at a thickness of 5 µm. The prepared sections were then deparaffinised and stained with 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD, Cayman Chemical, MI, USA) to visualise cell nuclei. Imaging was performed at 20x lens under FV-500 Olympus Scanning Confocal System (Olympus Poland). The Following Excitation-emission filters were used: 405 nm vs. 430–450 nm; 488 nm vs. 505–525 nm; 543 nm vs. 560 IF. Confocal microscopy figures were combined in Adobe Photoshop CS6; original microphotographs are attached as a Supplementary Materials to the current article (Figures S1–S12) 2.8.

Microarray Study For this part of the experiment, RNA was isolated from chicken embryos incubated for 4 and 5 days, following NPs application (10 µg/mL of ZnO OVAL or ZnO LONG nanoparticles suspended in PBS, 100 µL per egg). The control group was treated with 100 µL of PBS. The schematic design of the microarray experiment is presented on Figure 2 2.12. Quantitative PCR To verify microarray results, the expression of selected genes: COL6A2 SDHA PSMB7 STEAP3 −ΔΔCt 32 2.13. Statistical Analysis For statistical evaluation, all acquired results were initially tested for equal standard deviation and Gaussian distribution (Kolmogorov and Smirnov test). According to the results, the following statistical analysis was performed with either ANOVA followed by Tuckey post hoc test for Gaussian distribution, or Mann–Whitney test for non-Gaussian distribution. All statistical analysis was performed in the Graph-Pad In-Stat 3.10 software, with p p p p The statistical analysis of microarrays was performed using Gene Spring14 software (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The probe sets were filtered by flags to remove poor quality probes (absent flags). The statistical significance of the differences observed was evaluated using a Moderated T-test ( p 3. Results 3.1. Results—Physical Study 3.1.1. Structural Analysis Based on X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) Measurements XRD patterns of both ZnO OVAL and ZnO LONG NPs are shown in Figure 3 For ZnO OVAL NPs synthesised from zinc nitrate, only very weak additional reflections are observed in the 15° < 2θ < 30° range. These most likely originate from zinc nitrate hydroxide family compounds, which crystallise in a monoclinic structure [ 33 Additionally, a slight shift in the reflections toward higher 2θ angles is visible in the ZnO OVAL samples. The mean crystallite sizes (MCS), calculated using the Scherrer equation based on the (002) reflection, were estimated at approximately 122 nm for ZnO LONG and 52 nm for the ZnO OVAL. 3.1.2. Morphological Characterisation via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) The morphology of the synthesised ZnO NPs was investigated using SEM, as shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 5 In contrast, ZnO LONG NPs synthesised from anhydrous zinc acetate ( Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 5 3.1.3. Elemental Composition Analysis by Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) The elemental composition of ZnO LONG and ZnO OVAL NPs was analysed using EDX. The atomic percentages of detected elements in samples are presented in Figure 6 3.1.4. Optical Properties—Cathodoluminescence (CL), Photoluminescence (PL) Measurements and Confocal Microscopy The results of room-temperature CL measurements are depicted in Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 34 In the case of the ZnO LONG, the intensity of defect-related luminescence is significantly lower than that of NBE emission, with the calculated ratio of integrated NBE to DLE intensities determined as ~0.3. Nevertheless, the spectral range of the DLE for the ZnO LONG (~450–860 nm) is considerably broader than that of the ZnO OVAL (~420–730 nm), and the DLE band exhibits two distinct local maxima at approximately 570 nm, and 630 nm. The calculated I NBE DLE 5 0 7 2 3+ Doping ZnO with europium ions is generally challenging, due to the significant difference in ionic radii between Zn 2+ 3+ 35 3+ 36 3+ exc Figure 8 Photoluminescence emission spectra recorded under λexc = 466 nm excitation for ZnO OVAL (Eu-doped) NPs revealed distinct narrow emission lines characteristic of Eu 3+ 5 0 7 J 5 0 7 0 3+ s 1 n nv n 37 5 0 7 1 5 0 7 2 3+ 37 3+ Eu ions were introduced as a doping agent for ZnO to induce their fluorescence, hence NPs detection in the embryonic tissues under the confocal microscopy systems that are widely used in biomedical studies. As the ZnO lattice biodegrades, the fluorescence characteristic for Eu-induced ZnO defects disappears [ 38 Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 3.1.5. Results of Zeta Potential Measurements The zeta potential measurement of ZnO LONG synthesised using zinc acetate was determined to be (10.0 ± 0.4) mV, whereas the ZnO OVAL obtained from zinc nitrates exhibited a significantly higher value of (25 ± 1) mV. These differences indicate a pronounced variation in surface charge characteristics, suggesting distinct colloidal stability profiles for the two materials. The corresponding zeta potential distributions are shown in Figure 10 The hydrodynamic diameters (Z-average) and polydispersity indices (PDI) of the samples are presented in Table 2 3.2. Results—Biological Study 3.2.1. Cell Viability Assay The cell viability test showed differences depending on the shape of the used NPs. With ZnO OVAL, CEFs viability dropped to 50% for a concentration of 0.01 mg/mL ( Figure 11 Figure 11 3.2.2. Zn Concentration in Embryo and Egg White After Administration of Nanoparticles Measured by Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) AAS was used to indirectly quantitatively measure the distribution of ZnO NPs in the egg after administration to the air chamber. The concentrations in egg white did not vary from the CTRL and did not exceed 5 mg/kg, the average Zn concentration in the egg, indicating no significant shift in Zn concentration in the egg following NPs application. The mean results for zinc concentration in embryos are presented in Figure 12 p Despite the lack of statistical significance, the observed difference in zinc concentration in embryos, which depends on the shape of NPs at day three (trend), can also be observed at days four and five, where ZnO LONG achieve higher concentrations within the embryo (trend, p 3.2.3. Fluorescence in Embryo Tissues By incorporating Eu doping into ZnO OVAL nanoparticles, the presence of nanoparticles in embryonic tissues could be directly confirmed using confocal microscopy ( Figure 13 3.2.4. Activity of Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) The activity of SOD changed significantly vs. CTRL during days five and eight of the incubation ( Figure 14 p p 3.2.5. Lipid Peroxidation Measured as the Content of Malondialdehyde (MDA) in the Embryo The level of lipid peroxidation in the embryo after administration of ZnO OVAL at both concentrations (10 and 100 µg/mL) shows a tendency to increase from day five until the last test day, (a drop to CTRL level was observed at day nine) with a significant increase vs. CTRL ( p p Figure 15 p Figure 15 3.2.6. Content of Carbonylated Proteins (CP) in the Embryo Significant variations vs. CTRL in the amount of CP were already observed from day four of incubation ( Figure 16 p p p p p p p p p 3.2.7. Whole Genomic Microarray and Real-Time PCR To check the impact of the ZnO NPs at the genomic level, an analysis using microarrays was performed according to the diagram presented in Figure 2 Figure 17 Figure 17 Comparing day four vs. day five, for ZnO OVAL, there was an increase in expression for 38 genes and a decrease in expression for 180 genes associated with signal transduction (including tyrosine kinase pathways). In contrast, for ZnO LONG, there was a respective increase in expression for 50 genes and a decrease in expression for 33 genes. For changes in gene expression related to energy metabolism, in ZnO OVAL, an increase in expression was observed for 15 genes, mainly related to metabolic changes in lipids, nucleotides, vitamins, and oxidative stress; the expression of 151 genes was downregulated. For ZnO LONG, the expression of only 38 genes was increased, while the expression of 36 genes was decreased. Real-time PCR analysis was performed to confirm the validity of microarray results. Three genes were selected for confirmation: COL6A2 STEAP3, PSMB7 Table 3 SDHA, Figure 18 COL6A2 p Expression for COL6A2 STEAP3 STEAP3 STEAP3 SDHA SDHA PSMB7 4. Discussion 4.1. Physicochemical Properties The structural, morphological, and optical differences observed between ZnO OVAL and ZnO LONG NPs reflect the impact of synthesis conditions and Eu doping on ZnO nanoparticle development. As revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the shift in XRD peaks toward higher angles in Eu-doped ZnO OVAL is notable. This behaviour is unusual, as Eu 3+ 2+ 35 39 40 39 41 2 3 3+ 42 3+ 43 27 Figure 3 3 2 4 3 6 2 3 ¯ ¯ 4 3 6 2 3+ 2+ 44 3+ The noticeable discrepancy between the sizes obtained from SEM ( Figure 4 The ZnO LONG nanoparticles exhibited a significantly larger average hydrodynamic diameter D = (2845 ± 95) nm compared to ZnO OVAL (369 ± 7) nm. It is important to note that the DLS technique assumes a spherical particle geometry and does not adequately account for shape anisotropy. This results in an overestimation of the size of long nanoparticles due to their slower translational diffusion. Consequently, the unusually large DLS size recorded for ZnO LONG may not reflect the aggregation of particles in aqueous suspension, but point towards the inherent limitations of the measurement technique when applied to long, anisotropic structures. The low polydispersity index (PDI), which is below 0.3 for both samples, indicates that the particles were well-dispersed at the time of measurement. Generally, the hydrodynamic diameters are larger than the transverse sizes obtained directly from SEM images, owing to the presence of hydration layers, surface-bound ions, or aggregation in suspension. The results of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) support the successful synthesis of stoichiometric ZnO LONG, with elemental ratios closely matching the theoretical Zn:O = 1:1 value. In the case of the Eu-doped ZnO OVAL sample, the presence of europium was confirmed at an atomic concentration of 0.32%, which is in reasonable agreement with the intended doping level of 0.5 mol%. This minor deviation falls within the expected error range for EDX quantification at low doping levels. These findings support the spectroscopic evidence for Eu 3+ 3+ In both types of ZnO NPs, the DLE band appears as a superposition of multiple emission components. This spectral heterogeneity reflects the involvement of multiple defect centres, which result from both the instability of point defects and their diverse structural forms. There is also considerable variation in the reported energy levels that individual point defects occupy within the band gap. Notably, the interpretation of the defect-related luminescence band remains highly debated, and its exact origin has yet to be definitively established [ 34 i 45 2 46 i 47 i 48 o Zn 49 The significantly lower I NBE DLE 27 4 50 zn i 50 5 0 7 2 3+ Figure 9 3+ 6 37 5 0 7 0 5 0 7 1 5 0 7 2 3+ 3v 37 In addition to the characteristic sharp emission lines, broad bands of a significantly lower intensity were also detected. These features suggest the presence of Eu 3+ Figure 9 3+ 3v 2+ The observed differences in zeta potential values between ZnO LONG and ZnO OVAL can be attributed to chemical composition surface-defect density variations and distinct morphological characteristics. ZnO LONG synthesised from zinc acetate exhibits an elongated, needle-like morphology, while the ZnO OVAL displays a more isotropic, oval shape. It is important to know that zeta potential measurements performed using electrophoretic light scattering, similar to the DLS measurements, are based on the assumption of spherical particle geometry. Anisotropic structures, such as elongated particles, tend to rotate in the applied electric field and can present heterogeneous surface charge distributions. These phenomena disturb electrophoretic (ELS) mobility measurements and often underestimate the zeta potential. Therefore, the relatively low zeta potential recorded for the extended ZnO nanoparticles (10.0 ± 0.4) mV may be partially attributed to these geometric effects, rather than reflecting a genuinely lower surface charge density or reduced colloidal stability. It is known that nanoparticles exhibiting a neutral or near-neutral surface charge (zeta potential ≤ ±10 mV) are typically unstable in dispension, making them susceptible to agglomeration, flocculation, or coagulation over time [ 51 NBE DLE 4.2. Biological Study A strong increase in zinc concentration in chicken embryos is seen for the ZnO OVAL on day three of incubation, followed by a rapid decrease on day four to the level of the control ( Figure 12 52 53 3 54 55 56 57 Figure 13 Figure 13 Figure 13 58 59 Comparing AAS results for ZnO OVAL and ZnO LONG, a relative shift in the increase in zinc concentration in the embryos and a subsequent drop in Zn levels can be observed for ZnO LONG on day four and day six, respectively. This may indicate that nanoparticles with an elongated shape manifest a lower ability to migrate within the egg, both into and out of the embryo. Also, the relatively lower zeta potential value may affect the dispersal of those NPs within a predominantly negatively charged environment of the egg. The importance of the shape and structure of the ZnO NPs on their biological properties is shown by the cell viability assay, where ZnO LONG exhibited higher toxicity to the primary CEFs with CD50 at 0.001 mg/mL, compared to 0.01 of ZnO OVAL. However, those results were not confirmed by in ovo experiments, where no effect of NPs on embryo viability was observed, further supporting the different dynamics of ZnO OVAL and ZnO LONG diffusion in the egg and their trafficking in the tissues of an embryo. The results for the Zn concentration in the egg white did not show any variation vs. CTRL, nor any statistical significance, and measured Zn concentrations did not exceed 5 mg/kg. Compared to the average Zn content in the egg [ 60 Figure 13 3 54 55 56 Figure 12 Figure 13 One of the consequences of elevated Zn content in the tissues is the increase in the level of ROS [ 7 Figure 16 Figure 15 Figure 16 2 2 Figure 14 Figure 14 The COL6A2 61 62 COL6A2 Figure 18 Figure 15 Figure 16 The SDHA 63 SDHA Figure 18 64 SDH 65 Figure 14 66 PSMB7 67 PSMB7 Figure 18 Figure 16 Lipid peroxidation is a marker of oxidative stress that can have a significant impact on the developing embryo. As can be observed, the increase in peroxidation (MDA) levels is more characteristic to ZnO OVAL exposure than to ZnO LONG ( Figure 15 The differences in the markers of the oxidative stress observed between ZnO OVAL and ZnO LONG (see Figure 14 Figure 15 Figure 16 Figure 17 Figure 18 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Table 2 Figure 13 Figure 13 The overall level of changes at the genomic level presented by the results of microarray study was overwhelming. Changes in the expression of 1487 identified genes (1108 assigned to pathways) for ZnO OVAL and 548 identified genes (358 assigned to pathways) for ZnO LONG shows not only a strong dependence on the shape of the nanoparticles used, but most crucially, the impact of ZnO NPs exposure on developing embryo. This was surprising, as our initial studies on polarised Caco-2 cell culture, which mimicked functional intestinal epithelium, showed no variation in the gene expression in response to oxide NPs exposure (data unpublished, pending patent application). In a parallel study conducted on a Danio rerio model, where the effects on changes in gene expression were compared following the administration of ZnO NPs and Zn 2+ 4, 4 68 2+ 5. Conclusions The comprehensive physicochemical characterisation of ZnO and ZnO with a content of 0.5%mol. Eu NPs synthesised via different hydrothermal routes demonstrated the significant influence of precursor chemistry and rare-earth doping on structural, morphological, and optical properties of obtained NPs. XRD analysis confirmed that pure ZnO crystallises in the hexagonal wurtzite structure (ZnO LONG), which seems to disallow doping with Eu ions. SEM imaging revealed a pronounced morphological transformation from elongated hexagonal prisms in undoped ZnO LONG to oval-like structures in Eu-doped ZnO OVAL nanoparticles, accompanied by a particle size and shape ratio reduction. XRD diffractograms of ZnO OVAL reveal no detectable europium-containing secondary phases. A shift in diffraction peaks toward higher 2θ angles was observed for Eu-doped ZnO OVAL, which suggests lattice compression, possibly due to surface segregation of Eu 3+ 3+ 5 0 7 2 3+ 3+ 2+ 3v Embryo exposure to both ZnO OVAL and ZnO LONG nanoparticles induced significant changes in oxidative stress parameters and affected the gene expression levels. The overwhelming impact of ZnO NPs on the genomic level showed how little is known of the possible effects of nanomaterials and how unreliable the studies conducted on the in vitro models are. In the case of ZnO OVAL, the dynamics in both NPs trafficking and response to oxidative stress suggest that their rapid diffusion, transmembrane trafficking and organism circulation may be at the bases of observed oxidative stress and gene expression changes. The most intriguing result was the association of the dynamic Zn removal with the development and functionalisation of kidneys in the chicken embryo, confirmed by confocal imaging for ZnO OVAL, which may indicate different NPs trafficking mechanisms in birds and mammals, or during embryonic and adult life. For ZnO LONG, regardless of higher in vitro toxicity, the observed dynamics of NPs trafficking and their influence on embryonic tissues (both oxidative stress and gene expression levels) were delayed and reduced, suggesting not only the effect of shape, but also possible influence of their anisotropic structure and heterogeneous surface charge distribution on their diffusion and intracellular and intra-organism distribution.
