Current therapeutic approaches, such as statins and stent implantation, suffer from issues including single-target action, notable side effects, and the risk of restenosis. Nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems have demonstrated considerable promise by enabling the codelivery of multiple agents directly to atherosclerotic lesions, thereby improving therapeutic efficacy and minimizing systemic toxicity. Among various nanomaterials, organic nanoparticles have recently emerged as a research hotspot in the field of AS treatment due to their excellent biocompatibility, degradability, and potential for targeted modification. This review systematically summarizes the recent advances and emerging trends in the application of organic nanoparticles for AS treatment, employing bibliometric analysis to delineate research frontiers. We employed bibliometric tools to analyze 1999 articles on organic nanocarriers for AS therapy indexed in the Web of Science Core Collection. The analysis included co-occurrence and clustering techniques to explore influential keywords and key contributors. Temporal analysis was applied to identify emerging research hotspots and track the evolution of this field. The literature reveals three major current focal areas: (1) the development of engineered biomimetic organic nanoparticles; (2) the design of multifunctional polymer-based organic nanocarriers; and (3) the innovation of organic-coated stents. This article not only provides a comprehensive overview of cutting-edge organic nanotechnologies for AS therapy, but also critically discusses the challenges in clinical translation, offering insights into future directions for the development of safe, effective, and personalized nanomedicine strategies against AS. atherosclerosis bibliometric analysis drug delivery organic nanoparticles nanotechnology Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities This work was funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

Introduction Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronic disease characterized by lipid deposition in the vascular wall, inflammatory responses, and fibrous tissue hyperplasia, serving as the primary pathological basis of cardiovascular diseases worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Nanoparticles, ranging from 1 to 1000 nm, can encapsulate, adsorb, or conjugate therapeutic agents including chemical drugs, proteins and nucleic acids, which enable controlled release, precise delivery and enhanced efficacy [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Bibliometrics relies on mathematical and statistical methods to sort out and analyze scientific research activities in specific research fields. Based on literature databases and metric attributes, it further identifies research frontiers and hot directions, providing strong strategic support for research. With the help of bibliometric analysis, researchers can easily grasp the publication dynamics of a specific research field in terms of annual publication growth, most influential countries/institutions, literature sources, and research hotspots, thereby forming an overall understanding of the field’s influence and development trends. In addition, bibliometric analysis can also objectively analyze the current status of a specific field and provide guidance for its future development path. Given the growing number of studies and rapid advancements in the field. This review employs bibliometric analysis to systematically examine recent research trends and identify hotspots in the application of organic nanoparticles for atherosclerosis treatment. Compared to previous reviews that primarily focused on inorganic nanocarriers, this work aims to highlight the innovative potential, translational advantages, and future directions of organic nanomaterials in AS therapy ( Scheme 1 2. Bibliometric Analysis 2.1. Data Collection Our review is based on the collected data from a series of research results in queries to the Web of Science (WoS) core collection and the Editions is Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)—1945-present. Web of Science (WOS) is widely regarded by researchers as a high-quality digital literature database and is also recognized as the optimal choice for bibliometric analysis. As a comprehensive multidisciplinary database, it covers all high-impact scientific journals and world-class indexing resources. Compared with databases such as Scopus or MEDLINE/PubMed, WOS can extract more complete information for bibliometric analysis. However, this database still has certain limitations, such as incomplete coverage and characterization of literature, as well as issues like language bias, time bias, and subject bias. First, thorough key search terms: TS = (atherosclero*), limit the disease to atherosclerosis. Second, our review aims to display the application of organic nanoparticles for atherosclerosis treatment comprehensively, hence, the second query focuses on the object of research domains: TS = (liposome* OR micelle* OR dendrimer* OR polymer OR “polymeric nanoparticle*” OR nanocapsule* OR hydrogel* OR “extracellular vesicle*” OR “protein cage*” OR exosome* OR “solid lipid nanoparticle*” OR “nanostructured lipid carrier*” OR “lipid-polymer hybrid NP*” OR “DNA block copolymer*” OR “polysaccharide nanoparticle” OR “chitosan nanoparticle” OR “hyaluronic acid nanoparticle*” OR “albumin nanoparticle” OR “protein-based nanoparticle” OR “cyclodextrin complex” OR “inclusion complex” OR “nanoemulsion” OR “microemulsion” OR “polymersome” OR “biomimetic nanoparticle” OR “high-density lipoprotein nanoparticles” OR “carbon nanotubes”, “graphene” and “fullerenes”). Finally, the document type is restricted to the article. 2.2. Visualization and Analysis Following data acquisition, the collected information underwent processing and graphical representation via the native analytical tools of Web of Science (WoS) and the scientometric visualization software VOSviewer (version 1.6.17, developed by Leiden University’s Centre for Science and Technology Studies). WoS facilitated dataset extraction and preliminary statistical evaluations, including chronological publication trends and geographic distribution of contributing regions. VOSviewer, a specialized platform for scientometric exploration, enabled the mapping of thematic clusters and the identification of evolving patterns through co-occurrence network analysis and density-based visualization techniques. 2.2.1. Publications Analysis A total of 1998 articles related to the application of organic nanoparticles for AS treatment were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection. The annual publication count, which reflects the developmental trends in the related research field, showed that from 2000 to 2018, the annual number of WOS core colletion publications remained below 100. Since 2019, however, annual WOS core colletion publications have consistently exceeded 100, accompanied by a continuous increase in citation counts ( Figure 1 Figure 1 2.2.2. Major Research Domains To deeply explore the classification and research priorities of the organic nanoparticles used for AS treatment, this study conducts a systematic analysis through keyword co-occurrence analysis and in-depth data mining. The keyword co-occurrence network is constructed based on the number of studies where two keywords appear simultaneously in titles, abstracts, or keyword lists, with author keywords effectively characterizing research focuses and trends. After setting a minimum occurrence frequency of 15, 217 keywords were extracted from 1998 studies, mainly forming three color-coded clusters ( Figure S1A The temporal distribution of research terms effectively reflects the dynamic evolution of the field. Therefore, this study further analyzes the evolutionary trajectory of keywords through a time-based dimension to reveal the development trends in the organic nanoparticles used for AS treatment ( Figure S1B 3. Research Hotspots of Organic Nanoparticles for as Treatment 3.1. Organic Coated Stents As shown in the bibliometric analysis, the blue cluster in the Figure S1A 30 31 32 33 34 3.1.1. New Polymeric Organics as Stent Coatings The third-generation DES, such as the Orsiro and SYNERGY stent, has mitigated in-stent restenosis through material innovation. The Orsiro stent uses a polylactic acid (PLA) degradable polymer drug delivery system loaded with rapamycin for programmed release, achieving 80% drug release within 3 months, with complete degradation of the polymer coating within 12–24 months [ 35 36 37 Figure 2 Vascular Reendothelialization Coated Stents Endothelial dysfunction refers to structural or functional abnormalities of vascular endothelial cells, leading to impaired regulation of vascular homeostasis, manifested as pathological states such as vasomotor dysfunction, imbalance between anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory responses, and disorders of coagulation/anticoagulation [ 38 39 40 2+ Anti-Inflammation Coated Stents Vascular mechanical injury caused by stent implantation activates neutrophils and macrophages, releasing large amounts of ROS (such as O 2 − 2 2 41 42 43 44 2 2 2 3.1.2. Biomimetic Nanoparticles as Stent Drugs DES typically uses chemical drugs such as paclitaxel or rapamycin [ 45 46 34 47 48 49 50 Figure 2 51 52 3.2. Traditional Organic Polymeric Nanoparticles In the hotspot areas identified by bibliometric analysis ( Figure S1A 53 3.2.1. Targeted Nanoparticles Traditional anti-atherosclerotic drugs such as statins and anti-inflammatory agents often cause systemic side effects. Targeted delivery can confine drugs to plaques, reducing dosage requirements. Targeted nanomedicines are drug delivery systems designed using nanotechnology, which employ nanoparticles (typically 20–200 nm in size) as carriers to precisely deliver drugs to atherosclerotic plaques while minimizing damage to normal tissues. The targeting mechanisms include passive targeting via the high permeability of inflamed sites and active targeting via surface-modified ligands that specifically bind to receptors at lesion sites [ 54 Figure 3 Table 1 55 56 57 58 59 Ligand-Modified Nanoparticles Designed for Specific Lesion Sites Endothelial cells in the AS site are different from normal tissues and are the targets of nanomedicines. Clinical observations showed that AS preferentially develops in curved and branching arterial regions, where endothelial cells are exposed to disturbed blood flow with characteristic low-magnitude oscillatory shear stress [ 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 VSMCs play a central role in plaque formation and evolution during AS, with their phenotypic transformation established as a promising therapeutic target. Specifically, in the early stages of lesion development, quiescent contractile VSMCs undergo phenotypic conversion to a synthetic phenotype, acquiring excessive proliferative capacity and migrating to the vascular intima [ 56 69 70 71 Foam macrophages are the hallmark cells of AS. During AS progression, monocytes migrate into the vascular intima and differentiate into macrophages, which form foam cells after phagocytosing oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), constituting the main component of the plaque lipid core [ 72 73 74 75 Macrophages are immune cells in AS development, with their functional states directly influencing plaque stability and disease progression. Macrophages are primarily categorized into pro-inflammatory (M1) and anti-inflammatory (M2) types. Early plaques are dominated by M2 macrophages, promoting fibrous cap thickening; advanced plaques have higher M1 macrophage prevalence, leading to uncontrolled inflammation and plaque vulnerability [ 76 77 78 79 80 81 The atherosclerotic extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a critical role in plaque formation, progression, and vulnerability, with its dynamic remodeling and compositional changes directly impacting the vascular microenvironment and plaque stability [ 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 Cell Membrane-Coated Nanoparticles Cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (CMNPs) represent an innovative biomimetic nanotechnology that endows synthetic nanoparticles with unique biological functions, such as immune evasion, target recognition, and inflammation tropism, by coating their surfaces with natural cell membranes [ 90 Macrophages represent large-sized and highly adaptable white blood cells that naturally serve as primary cellular effectors in inflammatory responses and tissue repair mechanisms. These cells possess the capabilities to transverse physiological barriers, evade immune detection, facilitate intracellular transport, and home to inflamed sites [ 91 92 93 Neutrophils, as natural “inflammation sentinels,” actively migrate to inflamed sites, and their membrane-coated nanoparticles inherit this property. Neutrophil membranes carry “self” surface molecules (e.g., CD47, CD11b/CD18) that bind to inhibitory receptors (e.g., SIRPα) in the immune system, transmitting “non-foreign” signals to suppress phagocytosis by macrophages and dendritic cells [ 94 95 96 Platelets, crucial for hemostasis, are closely associated with atherosclerosis at multiple stages and exhibit significant crosstalk with inflamed endothelium [ 97 98 99 Neutrophil Hitchhiking Nanoparticles In situ neutrophil hitchhiking is a promising strategy to leverage neutrophils’ innate chemotaxis for efficient delivery of nanomedicines and diagnostic reagents to inflamed/autoimmune sites [ 100 101 Ligand-Free Targeted Nanoparticles Traditional strategies often rely on ligand modification (e.g., antibodies and peptides) to enhance targeting but face challenges like immunogenicity and complex preparation. Recent studies showed that targeted delivery can be achieved without additional ligands by regulating nanoparticle composition or morphology, with advantages being deposition in lesions without specific receptor expression [ 102 103 pharmaceutics-17-01131-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Examples of nanoparticles targeting atherosclerotic plaque.

Stimulus-Responsive Nanoparticles In recent years, microenvironment-responsive nanodrug delivery systems have attracted increasing attention from researchers. These stimulus-responsive drug delivery systems are designed to trigger the release of contents from nanoparticles in an “intelligent” manner by leveraging changes in physiological conditions at lesion sites under disease states [ 106 60 107 108 109 110 Figure 3 ROS ROS plays a non-negligible role in the development of AS. ROS are generated during mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, which are crucial for maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, excessive production of ROS can cause a series of events closely related to AS development, such as endothelial damage, LDL oxidation, foam cell formation, monocyte migration, and degradation of the fibrous wall [ 109 111 Many ROS-responsive chemical groups can be used for designing stimulus-responsive nanomaterials, including hydroxymethylferrocene (Fc) [ 112 113 114 115 116 2 117 2 2 118 119 2 2 120 In addition to using ROS-sensitive linkages to break and release drugs under the action of ROS, another strategy for constructing drug delivery systems using ROS-responsive properties is to generate hydrophilic groups through the reaction of ROS-sensitive chemical bonds with ROS, thereby changing the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of polymers and promoting the dissociation and drug release of the drug-loaded system. For example, thioether groups (-S-) in polypropylene sulfide are introduced into the polymer through ring-opening polymerization, and their structure is ROS-responsive. Thioethers can be oxidized by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 2 114 121 2+ 2 2 3+ 112 pH Naghavi et al. measured the pH range of atherosclerotic plaques in humans and rabbits using two pH-sensitive fluorescent dyes, finding values of approximately 6.5–8.5 and 5.5–7.5, respectively [ 108 122 123 124 Leveraging the low-pH characteristics of AS lesion sites, pH-sensitive release nanoparticles can be designed for precise drug delivery. Hydrazone bonds, important pH-sensitive chemical linkages, are widely used in designing intelligent pH-responsive drug delivery systems. Formed by the condensation of carbonyl (C=O) and hydrazine (-NH-NH 2 + 125 126 127 128 129 2+ 130 + 2+ Blood Flow Shear Stress Hemodynamic factors such as blood flow shear stress (FSS) have increasingly garnered attention from scholars for their impact on the stability of atherosclerotic plaques. It is currently the consensus that the most frequent site for carotid atherosclerotic plaques is the carotid artery bifurcation, with nearly 95% of lesions located within 2 cm of the bifurcation origin [ 131 132 133 121 134 135 Enzyme A notable physicochemical feature in the late stage of AS development is the high expression of multiple proteases at plaque sites, leading to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and fibrous cap degradation, which reduces plaque stability. Enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [ 136 137 110 138 Cathepsin K (CTSK), a member of the papain-like cysteine protease family, is synthesized intracellularly as a precursor, activated under acidic lysosomal conditions, and secreted extracellularly, where it degrades the extracellular matrix. Studies have shown that CTSK is highly expressed in AS plaques and is closely associated with AS development [ 139 140 141 Cholesterol Cholesterol crystals are a critical component of atherosclerotic plaques, with their formation closely linked to abnormal metabolism of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [ 142 143 144 145 3.2.3. Multifunctional Synergistic Nanoparticles One advantage of using polymer nanomaterials as drug delivery carriers is the ability to achieve combination therapy by simultaneously carrying multiple drugs [ 146 Figure 3 Theranostic Nanoparticles Reliable diagnostic strategies are critical for improving AS management. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and computed tomography angiography (CTA) are clinical gold standards for visualizing atherosclerotic plaques [ 147 148 149 150 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become one of the gold standards for AS diagnosis due to its non-invasiveness, high resolution, and functional analysis capabilities. MRI generates high-resolution images using magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses without radiation exposure. The non-invasive, painless procedure with strong reproducibility provides safe support for long-term monitoring of plaque progression [ 151 3+ 152 128 3+ 3+ Two-Photon Excitation Aggregation-Induced Emission (TPE-AIE) is a novel optical material technology combining two-photon excitation (TPE) and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties. Its core mechanism involves exciting materials via simultaneously absorbing two low-energy photons and leveraging the enhanced luminescence of AIE materials in aggregated states to address challenges in biological imaging, such as penetration depth, photostability, and background interference [ 153 154 155 156 Ultrasound technology has become an important tool for AS diagnosis and assessment due to its non-invasiveness, real-time capability, and cost-effectiveness. Despite being a primary diagnostic technique with proven utility in AS detection, early-stage plaque detection remains challenging [ 157 158 159 160 3 4 Photoacoustic Imaging (PAI) is a non-invasive imaging technology combining optical excitation and acoustic detection, based on the photoacoustic effect where light energy is converted to heat, inducing thermoelastic expansion and generating acoustic signals [ 161 162 163 Multi-Target Therapy Nanoparticles The development of AS involves an intertwined pathological network of multiple links, including endothelial injury, lipid metabolism disorders, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune dysfunction. Single-target therapies, such as statins for lipid regulation, are effective but cannot comprehensively block other key pathological pathways [ 164 Elevated plasma cholesterol, particularly low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is a core driver of AS development. While chemical drugs like statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis, they suffer from insufficient lesion accumulation. Although nanotechnology can address these issues, the complex pathogenesis of AS has increasingly highlighted the limitations of single therapeutic strategies in tackling its multifaceted mechanisms, necessitating further enhancement of the therapeutic effects of single drug-loaded formulations [ 165 166 167 Persistent inflammation is a key determinant of plaque development. Macrophages, the most abundant white blood cells in plaques, play a major role in inflammation by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 168 169 170 + 126 171 3.3. Organic Biomimetic Nanoparticles The green cluster is focused on the organic biomimetic nanoparticles applied for AS treatment. As shown in the green cluster of Figure S1A,B 172 3.3.1. EVs from Specific Cell Sources According to the definition of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV), EVs are lipid bilayer-structured particles released by cells that cannot replicate autonomously, primarily including subtypes such as exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies [ 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 Based on the purpose of application and the characteristics of samples, various methods for isolating and purifying exosomes have been developed, mainly including ultracentrifugation, density gradient centrifugation, size exclusion chromatography (SEC), polymer precipitation, immunoaffinity, and microfluidic technology. Centrifugation is a classic and commonly used approach, which includes differential centrifugation and density gradient centrifugation [ 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 EVs’ surfaces contain various bioactive molecules, such as extracellular matrix proteins and cell surface receptors, while their contents include nucleic acids, proteins, and other substances, which exhibit specificity depending on the cell of origin [ 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 Table 2 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 Figure 4 Mesenchymal Stem Cells Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), as pluripotent stromal cells with multi-lineage differentiation potential and immunosuppressive properties, have been recognized as an important source of cells in regenerative medicine [ 203 204 205 206 207 Efferocytes There are a large number of uncleared apoptotic cells in the plaques of advanced AS. When apoptotic cells are not promptly cleared, they exacerbate the inflammatory response and acute event. Efferocytosis is considered the key to eliminating apoptotic cells under physiological and pathological conditions in vivo, which is crucial for maintaining homeostasis. Efferocytes are recruited by chemokines and “come find me” signals and eliminate apoptotic cells through phagocytosis [ 208 209 202 M2 Macrophages M2-type macrophages are a functional phenotype formed by the polarization of macrophages in a specific microenvironment. The main functions of M2 macrophages are to suppress inflammation, clear cell debris and apoptotic cells, and promote tissue repair. In the early stages of atherosclerosis or in stable plaques, M2-type macrophages are predominantly distributed in the fibrous cap and adventitial regions, exerting repair functions [ 210 211 212 EPCs EPCs, the precursor cells of vascular endothelial cells, originate from the bone marrow and are also present in small quantities in peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood, and adipose tissue [ 201 213 214 215 EVs Generated from Cells Under Stimulation In addition to directly isolating EVs from different cell sources for AS treatment, some studies have investigated the therapeutic effects of EVs generated from cell sources under various stimulations. It has been reported that pretreatment with cytokines, drugs, hypoxia, or physical factors can improve the biological functions of donor cells, and prepare them with the desired characteristics [ 216 217 218 2 pharmaceutics-17-01131-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Examples of EVs from specific cell sources for therapeutic applications.

Drug-Loaded EVs The contents of EVs are affected by factors such as the culture conditions of donor cells and the extraction process. Loading biological cargo into EVs offers a viable approach for significantly increasing therapeutic efficacy. The drug-loading strategies for EVs are primarily divided into two categories: exogenous and endogenous ( Figure 4 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 Gene Drugs Gene therapy can design targeted strategies against core pathological mechanisms of AS (e.g., lipid metabolism disorders, inflammatory responses, endothelial dysfunction) for precise treatment. However, naked gene drugs are highly susceptible to nuclease degradation in the bloodstream, which could be solved by using EVs as a promising new delivery platform for gene delivery [ 238 235 220 239 Chemical Drugs Traditional chemical drugs for AS (e.g., statins, aspirin) may cause risks of systemic toxicity with long-term use [ 17 240 241 242 243 3.3.3. EV Mimics Natural exosomes need to be extracted from cell culture media or biological fluids (such as blood and urine), with extremely low yields and complex purification processes, resulting in high costs and making it difficult to meet clinical or industrial demands. Exosome mimics can be prepared through artificial synthesis without relying on natural secretion processes, enabling large-scale production, significantly reducing costs and making it easier to promote industrial application ( Figure 4 173 Artificial cell-derived vesicles (ACDVs) are EV mimetics generated in laboratories via induced cell disruption (e.g., extrusion) [ 173 244 245 196 173 246 247 3.3.4. Engineering Strategies for EVs and EV Mimics The key challenges in EV heterogeneity, yield and purity of EV separation have hindered the standardized production of clinical-grade EV therapies. In addition, the targeting efficiency of EVs is highly influenced by parental and target cells. Meanwhile, EVs exhibit complex compositions, with their biodistribution affected by multiple factors, resulting in indistinct tissue specificity. These vesicles could be rapidly filtered by the liver and kidney tissue [ 248 Engineered nanovesicles can be produced by fusing the cell membrane with EVs. This method can preserve the therapeutic activity of EVs while enhancing their targeting ability. For example, in order to enhance the targeting ability of EVs, a number of studies fused EVs with platelet membranes to create engineered nanovesicles. M2-derived EVs (M2EVs) exhibit anti-inflammatory and tissue-repair properties but suffer from poor in vivo targeting. Platelet membrane surface proteins (e.g., GPIb) can target macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. By developing platelet membrane-decorated M2EVs (P-M2EVs), the study combines platelet targeting with M2EV therapeutic functions for precise AS treatment [ 249 250 Another kind of engineered nanovesicles can be produced by fusing liposomes with EVs. There are various strategies for the fusion of liposomes and exosomes, such as co-incubation and repeated freeze–thaw cycles. This approach, which involves fusing natural exosomes with liposomes to form larger and more functional engineered exosome/liposome hybrid nanovesicles, significantly improves drug loading efficiency and AS targeting ability [ 251 252 2 3 Although the exosome/liposome hybrid nanovesicles demonstrate an outstanding therapeutic effect, the acquisition process of EVs is complex, and the yield is relatively low. The hybrid vesicles prepared by fusing cell membranes and liposomes may have a higher yield and they are also multi-functional. For example, Qiu et al. [ 253 4. Prospects for Clinical Translation This review classifies the applications of organic nanoparticles in AS treatment through bibliometric analysis, highlighting three primary research directions including vascular organic stents, traditional polymeric nanoparticles, and biomimetic organic nanoparticles. Vascular organic stents have been widely used in the interventional treatment of coronary heart disease after 40 years of development. The Swiss team led by Urich Sigwart pioneered the development of bare metal stents (BMS), which provide mechanical vascular support through Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA), thereby reducing the rate of postoperative restenosis. Subsequently, drug-eluting stents (DES) composed of organic polymeric materials such as PLLA, PLGA were developed to inhibit intimal hyperplasia through local sustained release of antiproliferative drugs, further reducing the restenosis rate [ 254 Traditional nanoparticles such as liposomes have emerged as attractive drug delivery systems for AS treatment due to their capacity for targeted delivery. Engineering these nanoparticles to respond to pathological stimuli in the vascular microenvironment may enable in situ cargo release at target sites and improve the bioavailability of therapeutic agents. In the field of AS treatment, more and more clinical research on applying traditional organic polymeric nanoparticles for AS treatment continues. For example, CSL112 is a lipoprotein particle composed of human plasma apoA-I and soybean phosphatidylcholine, which promotes cholesterol efflux via the ABCA1 pathway to inhibit AS progression. The AEGIS-I clinical trial ( NCT02108262 255 NCT03473223 256 The application of organic biomimetic nanoparticles such as EVs in AS treatment represents the most cutting-edge and rapidly evolving research direction. Compared to traditional nanoparticles, EVs exhibit lower immunogenicity, minimal risk of immune rejection, and higher safety. However, their clinical translation is still in the early stages, with no EV-based therapies currently approved for market use. Key obstacles include challenges in large-scale production technical hurdles, the lack of unified quality standards, and concerns over the high production costs. Whether EV-based nanomedicines can offer a cost-effective and scalable solution to AS treatment remains to be determined. The development of engineered EVs with improved therapeutic effect may offer a promise for overcoming these barriers. Research on nanomedicines relies on reproducible and scalable production technologies, with benefits and risks balanced through Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and clinical trials. GMP is a key component of the quality assurance (QA) system for nanomedicines, aiming to ensure that nanomedicines are continuously and stably produced in accordance with regulatory requirements through reproducible and scalable manufacturing processes, thereby guaranteeing consistent quality. Due to the unique size (1–100 nm), matrix composition, and surface properties of nanomedicines, the complexity and specificity of their production processes impose higher requirements on GMP. During the scale-up from small-scale laboratory production to large-scale industrial manufacturing, GMP is essential to maintain the stability of key properties such as physicochemical characteristics and pharmacokinetics, while reducing toxicological risks. For liposomal nanomedicines, emphasis should be placed on stability, pharmacokinetics, and control of production process deviations. For block copolymer micelle-based nanomedicines, it is necessary to standardize chemical manufacturing and control (CMC), non-clinical toxicology, and early clinical trial design. For surface-coated (e.g., PEGylated) nanomedicines, the impact of the coating on plasma circulation time and stability needs to be evaluated to ensure detailed and accurate product descriptions.
