In this study, we assessed the concentrations of seven heavy metals (HMs) in forty-eight water samples and analyzed their correlation with zooplankton populations and human health risks at four sub-divisional sites in West Bengal, India. Sampling was conducted throughout the year. We used indices based on HMs and zooplankton to evaluate human health risks. The results revealed that the total taxonomic richness of zooplankton (Rotifera, Copepoda, and Branchiopods) was 72 species, with Rotifera richness 25, Copepoda 37, and Branchiopods 10 species. These results demonstrated a negative correlation between zooplankton abundance and HMs concentration, highlighting zooplankton’s potential as significant indicator species. Pearson’s correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between HMs concentration and zooplankton abundance ( P Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-99260-w.

These changes are largely driven by human activities and climate changes 1 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Heavy metal toxicity is persistent and poses long-term risks to living organisms. Tchounwou et al. 15 16 17 18 19 20 20 21 22 23 24 25 As far as the literature is concerned, the impact of heavy metals on water quality in relation to the ecological status of zooplankton and human health risk assessment has not been thoroughly studied. In this research, we examine both heavy metal and zooplankton-based indices to determine the water quality and assess the human health risks associated with freshwater ecosystems. The study encompasses diverse environmental condition, including ponds, canals, and waterlogged areas, reflecting the various ways these water resources are utilized by different user groups. This approach allows for a more accurate and precise evaluation of potential risks or threats. Materials and methods Description of study area In India, 740 million rural people depend on freshwater sources, and about 38 million suffer from waterborne diseases 26 27 28 The present study investigates the East Medinipur district in West Bengal, which spans an area of 4713 square kilometers and is geographically located between 21°38′ and 22°31′ N latitude and 87°27′ and 88°12′ E longitude. According to the 2011 Census, the district has a population of 5.09 million people, with approximately 87% residing in urban areas and 13% in rural areas. The land use in this region is categorized into six main types based on satellite imagery: agriculture (46.41%), vegetation cover (33.06%), wetlands (12.27%), built-up areas (5.05%), water bodies (3%), and sandy tracts (0.20%). Local residents rely heavily on surface water bodies for their daily needs. Our survey found that among the 3% of land covered by water bodies, 67% of the population uses ponds for household purposes, 13% use canals, and 7% depend on waterlogged areas. It was observed that more than 60% of the population is affected by waterborne and skin diseases due to the regular use of these water resources. Consequently, medical expenses have increased by 30% of total household expenditure. For our study, we selected four sites within the district, each located in one of the four sub-divisional areas: Study Site-I (SI) in Tamluk (1084.30 sq. km), Study Site-II (SII) in Haldia (683.94 sq. km), Study Site-III (SIII) in Egra (940.96 sq. km), and Study Site-IV (SIV) in Contai (1251.21 sq. km). The district is rich in rivers, including the Rupnarayan (drainage area 5.23 sq. km), Haldi (5.21 sq. km), Rasulpur (4.71 sq. km), Kangsabati (2.69 sq. km), and Keleghai (1.62 sq. km), as well as canals and other water resources (Fig. 1 2  Fig. 1 Study area map of present investigation.

Sample collection and data processing We collected 48 samples from different water bodies such as, including pond ecosystems, canals, and waterlogged areas. Each site was further divided into four sub-sampling locations.

To assess the relationship between heavy metals and zooplankton populations, Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated with a significance level of 0.05. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was utilized to explore potential associations among various parameters. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 24) and Past (version 4.13) software. Result Diversity of zooplankton population After analyzing 48 water samples, we identified three major groups within the zooplankton community: copepods (51.39%), rotifers (34.72%), and branchiopods (13.89%). This included 27 families, 39 genera, and 72 species, with 17 species yet to be identified. Among the rotifers, we found two classes, two orders, five families, six genera, and 25 species (one unidentified). The copepods were represented by three orders, 18 families, 27 genera, and 21 species, with 16 species unidentified. The branchiopods included three orders, four families, six genera, and 10 species. Dominant rotifer species were Brachionus falcatus B. calyciflorus B. forficula Cephalodella gibba Filinia terminalis Keratella cochlearis K. tropica Heliodiaptomus viduus Phyllodiaptomus annae Mesocyclops leuckarti Ceriodaphnia cornuta Daphnia carinata Daphnia magna Diaphanosoma sarsi Moina brachiata Moina macleaya S1 The annual average zooplankton density was 1063.5 individuals per liter (ind./L) in ponds, 850.56 ind./L in canals, and 973.44 ind./L in water-logged systems. Within these, rotifers were present at densities of 402.06 ind./L, 334.88 ind./L, and 377.06 ind./L, respectively; copepods at 390.38 ind./L, 288.13 ind./L, and 346.19 ind./L; and branchiopods at 271.06 ind./L, 227.56 ind./L, and 250.19 ind./L, respectively. At the Egra study sites-III, the highest annual zooplankton density was 1486.50 ind./L in ponds, with the lowest being 1259.00 ind./L in canals. At Haldia study sites-II, the highest density was 668.00 ind./L in ponds, and the lowest was 547.75 ind./L in canals. At Contai study sites-IV, the maximum density was 928.00 ind./L, with the minimum being 726.75 ind./L in ponds and canals, respectively. In Tamluk study sites-I, the highest density recorded was 1171.50 ind./L in ponds, with the lowest at 1057.75 ind./L in canals.

During the observation period, about 64.58% of water samples shifted from moderately polluted to heavily polluted, and approximately 18.75% became heavily polluted (Table 1 48 1 53 54 As per the result of Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), it suggests that occurrence of zooplankton and seven different heavy metals in the same water bodies. The HMs likely enter aquatic systems from common sources such as industrial waste, agricultural runoff, and municipal waste. This clustering suggests potential ecological interactions between the heavy metals and zooplankton community structure. Non-carcinogenic health risk assessments for the seven heavy metals revealed that nickel (Ni) and zinc (Zn) pose the highest potential health risks for both children and adults at all study sites (Table 2 55 7 52 7 52 Given the observed decline in zooplankton populations and rising heavy metal pollution, there is an urgent need for scientific management practices to protect water quality and human health. Although the HI analysis for dermal contact showed no immediate risks, cost-effective remediation techniques should be implemented to improve water quality. Further research is also needed to explore the relationship between zooplankton abundance, health hazard indices for heavy metals, and GIS-based studies to better understand the situation. Effective solutions are essential, as these aquatic systems provide critical ecosystem services. It is crucial for industrial sectors, agricultural bodies, and other stakeholders to comply with environmental standards and regulations to prevent contamination. Municipalities should establish designated areas for domestic waste disposal, and urban authorities should encourage the use of personal reverse osmosis (RO) purification systems. Additionally, the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides should be regulated. Public awareness campaigns at the village level can also help reduce pollution in aquatic ecosystems. Conclusion Freshwater ecosystems are vital for human health but are often threatened by unrecognized dangers. This study assessed the concentrations of seven HMs in 48 water samples and their impact on zooplankton populations and human health risks across four sub-divisional sites in West Bengal, India. The research was conducted seasonally throughout the year, utilizing indices based on HMs and zooplankton to evaluate health risks. The results indicated annual average zooplankton richness of 1063.5 individuals per liter (ind./L) in ponds, 850.56 ind./L in canals, and 973.44 ind./L in water-logged systems. Rotifers were found at densities of 402.06 ind./L, 334.88 ind./L, and 377.06 ind./L, respectively; copepods at 390.38 ind./L, 288.13 ind./L, and 346.19 ind./L; and branchiopods at 271.06 ind./L, 227.56 ind./L, and 250.19 ind./L, respectively. A negative correlation between zooplankton abundance and HMs concentrations suggests that zooplankton could serve as effective pollution indicators. Pearson’s correlation coefficient and hierarchical cluster analysis confirmed a significant relationship between HMs and zooplankton ( P The Metal Index and Nemerow Pollution Index showed that 83.34% and 97.92% of water samples, respectively, were contaminated by HMs. Nickel (Ni) and Zinc (Zn) were identified as metals with the highest health risk potential. The Health Hazard Index (HI) values revealed that children are at higher risk (HI > 1), mainly through ingestion, while adults face greater risks from dermal exposure. These findings provide crucial baseline data, underscoring the urgent need for measures to mitigate environmental health risks and promote sustainable practices.
