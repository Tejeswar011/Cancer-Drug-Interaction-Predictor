Introduction Infections involving the brain, spinal cord, optic nerves, and meninges-collectively known as central nervous system (CNS) infections are among the most debilitating conditions associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and lasting complications [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 This phenomenon assumes particular relevance in cancer patients, whose immunological milieu is often altered not only by the neoplastic process itself but also by the cumulative impact of therapeutic interventions such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and emerging immunomodulatory agents including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) like nivolumab [ 11 12 While ICIs enhance anti-tumor immunity by blocking inhibitory pathways such as programmed cell death (PD)-1/PD-L1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated (CTLA) protein-4, they can induce a state of immune dysregulation rather than classical immunosuppression. This dysregulated immunity may paradoxically increase susceptibility to infections through several mechanisms. Firstly, ICIs promote nonspecific T-cell activation, potentially disrupting immune homeostasis and impairing effective immune surveillance against pathogens, thereby facilitating opportunistic infections and reactivation of latent microbes. Secondly, neuroinflammatory effects associated with ICIs and underlying malignancy may compromise BBB integrity, allowing pathogens to breach CNS defenses and disseminate systemically. Thirdly, adjunctive treatments common in these patients, such as corticosteroids used to manage immune-related adverse events (irAEs), confer additional immunosuppressive effects that further elevate infection risk. Lastly, ICIs may indirectly alter mucosal immunity and microbiota composition, promoting overgrowth and translocation of commensal organisms like Eikenella corrodens 13 Haemophilus Aggregatibacter Cardiobacterium hominis Eikenella corrodens Kingella 14 15 16 E. corrodens 14 15 16 E. corrodens E. corrodens 2. Case Report A 50-year-old Caucasian man, former smoker (4–5 cigarettes/day for approximately 10 years; quit in 2014), with a history of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)-positive, non-keratinizing undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nasopharynx, initially diagnosed in April 2023 and staged as cT4N1M0 (Stage IVa), presented to our center with acute onset of high-grade fever (temperature 39 °C), altered mental status, severe aphasia, a new right oculomotor nerve palsy, and predominantly brachial right-sided hemiparesis not previously noted in the emergency department. The patient had recently initiated immunotherapy with nivolumab (240 mg IV every two weeks, since March 2025), with the most recent dose administered three days prior to symptom onset, in the context of leptomeningeal progression. The patient’s oncologic course had been marked by an aggressive disease trajectory. Initial treatment consisted of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (total dose 70–63–56 Gy over 35 fractions) and cisplatin (cumulative dose 185 mg/m 2 At the admission, initial vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, heart rate of 110 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Laboratory investigations demonstrated normocytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.7 g/dL; hematocrit 33.6%; MCV 83.2 fL), marked neutrophilic leukocytosis (white blood cell count 13.49 × 10 9 9 9 2 Figure 1 ® ® E. corrodens Following a structured process of shared decision-making with the patient’s family, a palliative approach was adopted. The patient was transitioned to comfort-focused care and subsequently transferred to a residential hospice facility for ongoing symptom management and end-of-life support. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Microbiological Culture and Microscopy Following bottle positivity, aliquots were sub-cultured onto appropriate solid media, including Chocolate Blood Agar (PVX), MacConkey Agar, Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA), Schaedler Agar and Columbia CNA Agar (bioMérieux, Marcy l’Étoile, France), and incubated under aerobic and microaerophilic conditions at 35–37 °C. Colony growth was assessed after 24–48 h. In parallel, Gram staining for morphological evaluation was performed by light microscopy (Olympus, Carl Zeiss, Cambridge, UK) at 20× and 100× magnification. 3.2. MALDI-TOF MS Identification of E. corrodens The acquisition and analysis of mass spectra were performed using the MALDI Biotyper ® 3.3.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of E. corrodens Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the E. corrodens ® 2 E. corrodens 3.5. Study Research and Inclusion Strategies We performed a comprehensive search of the following databases from 1958 to June 2025: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register; NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio Database; and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Reference lists and published systematic review articles were analyzed. We used the terms “ Eikenella corrodens Bacteroides corrodens In all the studies in which other bacteria or fungi isolated from patients, we considered only the results related to E. corrodens E. corrodens Exclusion criteria were articles discussing non-CNS and non-head and neck E. corrodens 4. Results 4.1. Blood Culture Isolation and Microscopic Examination of E. corrodens With clinical suspicion of bloodstream infection (BSI), blood cultures were obtained on the day of hospital admission from both peripheral venous (PV) access and a central venous catheter (CVC). Paired aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles were inoculated and incubated using the BACT/ALERT ® ® 2 E. corrodens Figure 2 4.2. MALDI-TOF MS-Based Identification of E. corrodens Identification of the isolate was performed using MALDI-TOF MS with the Bruker Biotyper ® E. corrodens 4.3. Sequencing-Based Identification of E. corrodens To definitively confirm the species identification of the bloodstream isolate, genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to PCR amplification targeting the 16S rRNA gene using primers 27F and 787R. The resulting amplicon was sequenced bidirectionally, and the consensus sequence was analyzed via BLAST against the NCBI nucleotide database ( https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi E. corrodens PV598151 4.4.

Conclusions The case presented herein illustrates how anatomical disruption and immunological imbalance—whether due to malignancy, local disease progression, or iatrogenic modulation of immune function—can synergistically facilitate microbial translocation from mucosal sites to the central nervous system and, ultimately, into the bloodstream. Emerging evidence suggests that ICIs, while enhancing anti-tumor immunity, may paradoxically compromise mucosal barrier integrity and microbiome homeostasis, increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections. These alterations underscore the need for longitudinal studies evaluating the impact of ICIs on the oral and sinonasal microbiota, particularly in head and neck cancer populations. Monitoring shifts in microbial composition could serve as both a biomarker of immune perturbation and a predictive tool for infectious complications. Future research should focus on characterizing the immunological and microbiological interfaces altered by ICIs and establishing standardized protocols for the rapid identification and management of invasive infections caused by fastidious oral organisms such as E. corrodens Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms13092135/s1 E. corrodens Author Contributions Conceptualization, T.C., C.M.M. and T.D.; methodology, T.C., C.M.M., M.Z. and T.D.; software, T.C., C.M.M.; validation, F.T., T.D., B.F., B.P. and M.S.; formal analysis, T.C. and C.M.M.; investigation, T.C., C.M.M., M.Z. and T.D.; resources, M.S.; data curation, T.C., C.M.M. and T.D.; writing—original draft preparation T.C., C.M.M. and T.D.; writing—review and editing, T.C., C.M.M., F.T. and T.D.; visualization, T.D.; supervision, T.D., B.P. and M.S.; project administration, T.D.; funding acquisition, M.S.
