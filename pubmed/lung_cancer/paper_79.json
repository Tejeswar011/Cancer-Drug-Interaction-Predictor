Recent studies have demonstrated that hydrazone derivatives\ncan\neffectively inhibit α-glucosidase and α-amylase enzymes,\nkey targets in diabetes management that regulate carbohydrate metabolism.     3TOP 1OSE Artabotrys sumatranus 1OSE Despite these\npromising findings, challenges remain in developing\nhydrazone derivatives with strong inhibitory activity and low cytotoxicity.\nThis study aims to address these challenges by synthesizing a series\nof novel hydrazone compounds guided by rational design principles.\nTheir inhibitory effects on α-glucosidase and α-amylase\nwere evaluated, alongside cytotoxicity assessments in human embryonic\nkidney cells (HEK293). Molecular docking analyses further elucidated\nbinding modes and affinities, contributing to the understanding of\ntheir potential as safer and more potent antidiabetic candidates. 2 Experimental Section 2.1 Materials and Methods All chemicals\nand solvents were analytical grade, purchased from Acros, Alfa Aesar,\nSigma-Aldrich and Merck in purity suitable for synthesis or analytical\ngrade.

The prepared reaction\nmixture was transferred to a 384-well plate designed for fluorescence\nreading. Fluorescence was measured every 10 min for 60 min using the\nThermo Variscan at excitation/emission wavelengths of 375/460–470\nnm.

The MTT assay included putting\nthe cells in an MTT solution (at 1 mg/mL concentration) and incubating\nthem for 1 h at 37 °C. The absorbance was measured at a wavelength\nof 570 nm using an Epoch microplate spectrophotometer. 2.6 Molecular Docking Molecular docking\nis a computational technique to predict how a ligand (e.g., a small\nmolecule, peptide, or drug candidate) binds to a specific target molecule,\nusually a protein or enzyme. By simulating molecular interactions\nat the atomic level, molecular docking provides valuable insights\ninto the structure–function relationships of biomolecules,\naiding in the rational design of therapeutics. The crystal structures of α-amylase (PDB ID: 4W93 5NN4 https://www.rcsb.org/  2PQR x y z x y z The docking results were analyzed using scoring functions to assess\nthe binding energies between the ligands and the enzymes. The ligands\nwith the highest binding affinities for the enzymes’ active\nsites, determined by the lowest binding energies, were identified.\nSubsequently, the two-dimensional structures of the resulting enzyme-ligand\ncomplexes were modeled, and the interactions (including hydrogen bonds,\nvan der Waals forces, and electrostatic interactions) between the\nligands and the amino acids in the active sites of the target enzymes\nwere examined. 2.7 Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations and MM/PBSA\nFree Energy Analyses Based on molecular docking and experimental\nstudies involving α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes,\ncompounds 8 10 During the initial\nenergy minimization stage, 1000 steps of the steepest descent algorithm\nwere applied to resolve steric clashes and achieve optimal geometric\nconfigurations. Following this, equilibration was performed in two\nphases: first, stabilizing the system under an isothermal-isochoric\n(NVT) ensemble, followed by equilibration under an isothermal–isobaric\n(NPT) ensemble, with each phase lasting 100 ps. The final production\nstage involved a 100 ns simulation using a 2 fs time step. Throughout\nthe simulations, the structural behaviors of the complexes were rigorously\nanalyzed using metrics such as root-mean-square deviation (RMSD),\nroot-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), and radius of gyration (Rg). Binding free energy calculations were performed using the Molecular\nMechanics Poisson–Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) method,\nemploying the GROMACS-compatible g_mmpbsa tool.

From this point of view, it is observed from the activity\nresults that the new hydrazone scaffolds based on acetohexamide inhibit α-amylase\nand α-glucosidase to different degrees. The different degrees\nof inhibition of enzymes by these synthetic derivatives can be explained\nby the electronic effect of the substituents in the synthetic molecules\nand the positioning of these substituents. The substituents in the\nsynthetic derivatives contain electron withdrawing and electron donating\ngroups.

It has been observed that the moderate electron withdrawing\nmethoxy group inhibits both enzymes better than the strong electron\ndonating nitro group. Based on this, it is shown that the novel hydrazone\nscaffolds based on acetohexamide containing strong electron withdrawing\ngroups in the scaffold can seriously inhibit these two enzymes. In\nconclusion, novel hydrazone scaffolds based on acetohexamide showed\nsignificant inhibition on α-amylase and α-glucosidase\nand can serve as lead molecules in the design of DM inhibitors. 3.3 PPAR-Gamma Ligand Activation Analysis In our study, we did not assess PPARγ activations, which may\nalso contribute to the beneficial effects of newly synthesized compounds. 3.4 In Vitro Cytotoxic Analysis All of\ncompounds were evaluated cytotoxic effect by the MTT test on the HEK293\ncell line.

ADME (which stands for Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism,\nand Elimination) is an important concept in the context of cellular\nbiology and biochemistry that describes the potential effect of a\nchemical or drug on a living system. This is because the movement\nand metabolism of molecules are determined by the physicochemical\nproperties of the molecule and the host system. The movement of molecules\nis called “kinetics” or “pharmacokinetics”\nand chemical properties such as polarity, molecular weight, molecular\nsize, chirality, HOMO/LUMO, and more all have an impact on the ADME\npotential of a molecule. However, the ADME concept can also be applied\nto non-pharmaceutical compounds, including those resulting from toxic\nexposure.

In this context, many computer\nsoftware containing different methods support practical studies. The\nradar images taken using the Swiss-ADME program, one of them, are\nevaluated, many parameters such as LIPO-lipophilicity, SIZE-molecular\nweight, POLAR-polarity, INSOLU-solubility, INSATU-saturation, FLEX-flexibility\ncan be examined.  1 14 Figure 1 2 8 11 12 14 7 9 10 13 3 4 5 6 5 Bioavailability\nradar visual of compounds 1 14 Toxicokinetics studies describe the rates at which\na substance\nenters a biological system and what happens to the substance once\nit enters the system. Measuring toxicity is an important step in drug\ndevelopment. However, current experimental methods used to predict\ndrug toxicity are expensive and time-consuming. This indicates that\nthey are not suitable for large-scale evaluation of drug toxicity\nat the early stage of drug development. For this reason, using the\nOSIRIS program, which is a computational model that can predict drug\ntoxicity risks, four toxicity risks are included in Table S1 11 11 The toxicities and toxicity classes of the target molecules were\nanalyzed by an in silico study using the Protox-II web server and\nare given with the data in Figure 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 1 2 7 11 12 14 50 5 50 8 50 3 4 6 50 9 10 13 50 1 2 7 11 12 14 3 4 5 6 8 10 9 10 13 6 Protox-II*** data of synthesized compounds.\n***­( https://tox-new.charite.de/protox_II/ PASS Online, a software developed by the Russian\nInstitute of Biomedical\nChemistry (IBMC) and freely accessible by browsers, predicts the biological\nactivities of compounds based on the structural formulas of synthesized\ndrug-like synthetic organic compounds and provides data.
