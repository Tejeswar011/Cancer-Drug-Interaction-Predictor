Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) combined with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with or without microwave ablation (MWA) for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). Materials and methods This retrospective study comprised 220 patients with uHCC who underwent TACE combined with a TKI and ICI with MWA (Group A: 105 patients (median age, 60 ± 10 years) and 82 (78.1%) were men) or without MWA (Group B: 115 patients (median age, 58.35 ± 10.27 years) and 97 (84.4%) were men) at multiple centers in China. The overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety were compared between the two groups. Results The OS, PFS, and ORR in Group A were significantly higher than those in Group B (OS, 21.30 ± 8.25 vs. 15.49 ± 7.41 months, p p p p p Conclusion The combination therapy (TACE + TKIs and ICIs) with MWA showed higher safety and significantly better OS, PFS, and ORR for uHCC than that without MWA. hepatocellular carcinoma microwave ablation transarterial chemoembolization immune checkpoint inhibitors combined modality therapy The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Approval for this retrospective study, which complied with the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki, was obtained from Institutional Ethics Committee of the four relevant participating institutions, and informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of this study. The diagnosis of HCC was based on the guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. The participant selection process is depicted in the flowchart in  Figure 1 Figure 1 Flowchart of the patient selection process. uHCC, unresectable hepatic carcinoma; TACE, transarterial chemoembolization; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor; ICIs, Immune checkpoint inhibitors; MWA, microwave ablation; BCLC, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer. Flowchart showing the selection process of patients with uHCC who underwent TACE combined with a TKI and ICI, with or without MWA, from January 1, 2019, to January 1, 2021. Out of 406 patients, 186 were excluded due to factors such as tumor thrombosis, cardiopulmonary issues, other malignancies, short treatment duration, additional treatments, BCLC stage A, and insufficient follow-up data. Patients were divided into Group A (105 with MWA) and Group B (115 without MWA), detailing enrollment numbers from four centers. The treatment decisions are based on the patient’s circumstances and the physician’s discretion. Multidisciplinary teams at the participating hospitals, which specialize in HCC, primarily make treatment decisions in accordance with the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) guidelines or the China National Liver Cancer guidelines. Before reaching a final decision, physicians ensure that patients and their family members are informed of the benefits and drawbacks of various treatment protocols, including potential treatment outcomes, financial implications, and treatment-related complications. The inclusion criteria in this study were as follows: eligible patients ≥18 years old with uHCC and at least one measurable lesion according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of ≤ 2; a Child–Pugh classification of A–B; and no coagulation dysfunction. Patients received the combination therapy (TACE + TKIs and ICIs) with or without MWA during the same period. Those with the following conditions were excluded: portal vein/hepatic vein tumor thrombosis in the main trunks; history of encephalopathy or refractory ascites; severe cardiopulmonary and coagulation insufficiency; history of other malignant tumors; existing immunodeficiency disease or a history of organ transplantation; duration of TKI and ICIs <2 months; Surgically respectable HCC; incomplete clinical or follow-up data. Follow-up was terminated on January 1, 2023. Treatment sequencing The patients were divided into two groups: Group A underwent TACE plus MWA combined with a TKI and ICIs, and Group B underwent TACE combined with a TKI and ICIs. TKIs TKIs (initiated 3-5 days pre-TACE): To normalize tumor vasculature and enhance subsequent chemoembolization delivery. The TKIs mainly included sorafenib (400 mg twice a day), lenvatinib (8 or 12 mg once a day, based on body weight), or apatinib (250 mg once a day), and dose reduction for TKIs due to toxicity was allowed. One of these medicines was selected based on the willingness and tolerance of the patient. TACE The patients included in the study received conventional TACE (cTACE) or drug-eluting beads TACE (DEB-TACE), which were performed according to a standard protocol by interventional radiologists from the participating centers with at least 10 years of experience. The treatment strategy for TACE was done “on-demand,” meaning it was implemented when incomplete necrosis of new lesions was suspected in the intrahepatic tumor. Subsequent TACE was discontinued when the patient’s liver function deteriorated to Child-Pugh class C (uncontrollable ascites, severe jaundice, overt hepatic encephalopathy, or hepatorenal syndrome), the ECOG performance status was >2, or the target lesions continuously progressed after three TACE sessions. cTACE was performed by injecting chemotherapy medicines and embolic agents into the tumor-feeding artery. The chemotherapeutic regimens used were determined by a multidisciplinary team (MDT) with standardized training prior to the procedure. Chemotherapy medicines like doxorubicin, epirubicin, and platinum were commonly used. The size and type of the embolic agent were determined according to the clinical practice of the participating center. In the case of DEB-TACE, various sizes (100–300and 300–500 um) of the embolic agent callispheres (Suzhou Hengrui Callisyn Biomedical Co.) loaded with 60 mg of doxorubicin per vial were used. The endpoints of embolization were the complete disappearance of the vessels supplying blood to the tumor or the development of the main trunk only and the gradual reduction in the flow of the contrast agent followed by its disappearance after 2–5 heartbeats. In general, the embolization endpoint of DEB-TACE is required to reach “near stasis,” the endpoint of cTACE should reach “complete stasis,” during the super-selective catheterization of the tumor-feeding artery ( 27 ICIs ICIs (administered 3-7 days post-TACE): To capitalize on tumor antigen release from chemoembolization-induced necrosis. Patients with Child–Pugh class A and B would receive the ICI (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, sintilizumab, and camrelizumab). ICI therapy was suggested at a standard dose once every 3 weeks. Temporary ICI interruption was allowed due to toxicity, but dose reduction was not allowed. MWA The MDT composed of hepatobiliary surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, and interventional radiologists conducted the case assessment. The indication for MWA was determined primarily by the identification of residual tumor following TACE, rather than by specific patient baseline characteristics. Additionally, procedural feasibility—defined by the availability of a safe and accessible ablation pathway as confirmed by medical imaging examination data—constituted an essential technical prerequisite for treatment allocation. A physician with more than 15 years of experience in minimally invasive treatment and a physician with more than 10 years of experience in imaging worked together to complete the preprocedural plan. The MWA performers in this study were experienced through unified training and clinical cases and adhered to the MWA technical guidelines for treating hepatic tumors. The ECO-100 water-cooled microwave device (ECO Microwave Electronic Institute, Nanjing, China) and microwave antenna (19G) were used for MWA. After routine preparation, a plain computed tomography (CT; Somatom 64 Sensation; Siemens, Muenchen, Germany) scan was performed to confirm the target tumor and puncture the path according to the preprocedural plan. Typically, the selection of the MWA strategy and the target tumor during preprocedural planning was based on the following criteria: a multidisciplinary consultation, wherein the target lesions were deemed resistant to regular on-demand TACE combined with systemic therapy; the presence of less than three new lesions while undergoing MWA; and the ability to deactivate all the target lesions during a single MWA procedure. A single antenna was generally used for the complete ablation of tumors with a maximum diameter of <30 mm. Alternatively, multiple overlapping ablations were performed to accurately judge the required number of ablations for tumors with a maximum diameter of >30 mm. The location of the needle placement effectively reduced residual tumors or recurrence. The treatment parameters were set at 50–70 watts, and the procedure lasted 7–15 min. After the MWA procedure, an immediate CT scan was performed to assess the ablation zone and the presence of complications. Antiviral treatment for hepatitis B virus Antiviral treatment regimens were determined by hepatology specialists within the MDT. Patients underwent regular follow-up and virological monitoring. HBV DNA quantification was not performed as part of routine surveillance. Assessments All patients were required to undergo a follow-up with laboratory tests and enhanced CT/Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans at intervals of 4–6 weeks after the first treatment. Tumor response was evaluated every 4–6 weeks after each treatment. The responses, including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD), were evaluated by two radiologists, both with >10 years’ experience, using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) and compared between the two groups. The objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and duration of response (DOR) were also assessed. OS was defined as the period from the date of uHCC diagnosis until the last follow-up date (or death). Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the interval between the initial TACE and radiologic disease progression (or death). Those who remained alive at the last follow-up date were considered “censored.” Follow-up and management of adverse events Patients with no tumor progression were advised to undergo follow-up every 3 months. Repeated MWA or TACE for residual tumors required a consensus decision made by the multidisciplinary team. The timing of subsequent TACE or MWA procedures depended on the treatment efficacy and the patient’s recovery. The severity of the AEs was assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE - Version 5.0). Grade 3 or 4 TKI-related AEs were encountered during targeted therapy, the medicine dose was reduced until the toxicity was manageable ( 28 Statistical analysis SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. Quantitative data are expressed as frequency, mean ± standard deviation, or median, with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The Mann-Whitney U test (non-normally distributed data) or Student’s t-test (normally distributed data) was performed for continuous variables analysis, and the Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was employed to compare categorical variables. Survival curves for PFS and OS were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Univariate analyses were performed to identify the predictive factors of survival using the log-rank test. Variables with a p p Results Demographic and treatment characteristics No significant differences in basic characteristics, including age, sex, ECOG score, BCLC stage, size of the tumors (cm), HBsAg positive, Child-Pugh class, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, and albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade were observed between the two groups. Likewise, there were also no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the type of TACE treatment, the type of TKIs, and the type of ICIs.

Discussion Sorafenib has been used as the standard therapy for uHCC, with a low effective rate and a high drug resistance rate, for decades. After the IMbrave 150 clinical trial showed that bevacizumab combined with atezolizumab significantly improved the ORR, mOS, and mPFS compared to sorafenib alone, the Food and Drug Administration authorized this combination therapy (bevacizumab + atezolizumab) as the first-line treatment for uHCC in 2020 ( 29 30 31 32 TACE, which can quickly and accurately reduce the initial tumor burden, embolize most of the blood supply vessels, and effectively treat portal vein thrombus, is the primary treatment method for uHCC. The inclusion of TACE may overcome the drawbacks of targeted therapy plus immunotherapy and increase the overall efficacy of the treatment ( 33 34 35 37 38 39 40 42  Figure 2 43 Combined modality therapy involving TACE, MWA, TKIs, and ICIs remains relatively underexplored in HCC, despite growing interest in integrating local and systemic treatments for uHCC ( 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 This study has several limitations. First, this multicenter, retrospective study included cases from four participating units; however, the baseline demographics were well-matched between the two groups, and the data were accurately recorded. Second, patients with portal vein/hepatic vein tumor thrombosis in the main trunks were excluded. Third, the patients included in the study were from four participating centers within the same medical construction region, which had close technical communication, training, and homogeneity in the TACE and MWA techniques and the treatment concepts for uHCC. Therefore, this study presents combined treatment strategies that may not be suitable for other medical regions. Furthermore, the retrospective design of this study, coupled with the heterogeneity in therapeutic agents employed, may diminish the statistical robustness of the outcomes. Nevertheless, no statistically significant differences were observed in drug usage profiles between the two patient cohorts. Importantly, univariate analysis of individual agents demonstrated that the survival benefits associated with each regimen were consistent with the survival advantage. Moreover, the treatment effects remained robust across multiple clinical endpoints, including ORR, PFS, and OS. This is the first large clinical case-control study to provide evidence of combining local and system therapy to treat patients with uHCC. In conclusion, the combination treatment mode involving TACE plus MWA combined with a TKI and ICIs demonstrated a longer PFS and OS with a manageable safety profile in patients with uHCC.
