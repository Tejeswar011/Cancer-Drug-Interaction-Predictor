This study aims to examine the association between multimorbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by gender and key socioeconomic factors among older adults in India. Method The Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) Wave-I data were used, and older persons aged 60 and above were selected for the study, which included 30,716 final samples. The HRQoL was measured based on a EuroQol Five-Dimension (EQ-5D) measure. The preliminary study used descriptive statistics to examine the baseline characteristics of the sample, the prevalence of chronic conditions, and the mean EQ-5D score. Aside from that, the findings on the association of EQ-5D score with exposure and the independent variables were carved out using a multiple linear regression model. Furthermore, the results were stratified by gender and tested for interactions. Results This study revealed that 23.8% of older adults had multimorbidity, with a higher prevalence among females and older age groups. Hypertension (32.7%), bone/joint diseases (19.6%), diabetes (14.3%), and stroke (2.5%) were common conditions. Individuals with multimorbidity exhibited significantly lower HRQoL scores (mean: 10.53) compared to those with single (8.98) or no morbidity (7.54). Adjusted regression models confirmed that multimorbidity (β = 2.19, 95%CI: 2.04,2.35) and female gender (β = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.71,1.00) strongly predicted poorer HRQoL. The association between multimorbidity and HRQoL was stronger in females compared to males. Lower socioeconomic status, rural residence, and poor self-rated health further exacerbated these disparities. These findings highlight the negative impact of multimorbidity on the physical and psychological well-being of older adults in India. Conclusions This study found that multimorbidity significantly reduces HRQoL among older adults in India, with women, individuals of lower socioeconomic status, and those reporting poor self-rated health experiencing the most significant burden. These findings highlight the need for gender-sensitive, equity-focused public health strategies aimed at managing chronic conditions and improving quality of life among the ageing population in India.

Multiple studies, including recent research in India and international systematic reviews, have demonstrated that older adults with multimorbidity experience lower scores in various domains of quality of life, including physical, psychological, and social well-being [ 12 13 21 26 27 The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is a comprehensive concept encompassing positive and negative aspects of an individual’s life and includes subjective evaluations of their physical, social, emotional, psychological, and mental functioning [ 28 29 28 30 31 32 33 Multimorbidity is associated with substantial adverse outcomes, including functional decline, higher healthcare utilization, and diminished HRQoL. Several studies have shown that multimorbidity adversely affects HRQoL, particularly in older adults. However, much of the Indian evidence is based on small-scale or region-specific datasets with limited focus on gender and socioeconomic disparities. While a few studies highlighted the negative impact of multimorbidity on HRQoL [ 11 32 11 21 34 Addressing this gap, the present study uses data from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) to examine the association between multimorbidity and HRQoL among older adults in India, and to assess how this relationship varies by gender and key socioeconomic factors. Method and materials Data source This study was based on cross-sectional survey data. The data for the analysis were drawn from the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI) wave-1, 2017–18. It is a nationally representative survey of 73,396 individuals, 31,135 male and 42,261 aged 45 and older, and their spouses (regardless of age) across all states and union territories of India. The survey’s main objective was to study the health status and socioeconomic well-being of older adults in India. The LASI adopted a multistage stratified area probability cluster sampling design to arrive at the eventual observation units: older adults aged 45 and above and their spouses, irrespective of age [ 8 The present study was conducted on respondents aged 60 years and above. After excluding individuals aged less than 60 years (41,494) and those with missing data (1,186), the final sample size comprised 30,716 older adults. Study variables Outcome variable The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was the primary outcome variable of the study. HRQoL represents a multidimensional construct that captures individuals’ perceptions of how health conditions affect their physical, mental, and social functioning [ 35 36 37 The EQ-5D framework examines five distinct health dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. This instrument has evolved over time, with versions featuring different levels of response categories - namely the EQ-5D-3 L (three levels) and the EQ-5D-5 L (five levels), where “L” indicates the number of response levels within each dimension [ 37 In this study, the EQ-5D was adapted to a binary response format (yes/no) for each dimension due to the structure of the LASI dataset. Each dimension was assessed through multiple related questions (except pain/discomfort, which used a single item), and the anxiety/depression domain incorporated the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale for a more nuanced assessment. Scores across all five dimensions were aggregated to create a composite HRQoL index, with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life. The full methodological details and operationalization of HRQoL in this context have been described in previous research [ 25 The comprehensive HRQoL index resulted in a theoretical range of 0 to 33 (observed mean = 8.681). This composite demonstrated strong internal consistency (scale reliability coefficient = 0.84). Higher values indicate greater health-related difficulties (poorer HRQoL), while lower scores reflect fewer functional limitations (better HRQoL). Exposure variable Multimorbidity constitutes the primary exposure variable in this study. The LASI dataset provided information on nine physician-diagnosed chronic conditions, assessed through self-reported measures confirmed by healthcare professionals. Participants were explicitly asked: “Has any health professional ever diagnosed/told you that you have the following chronic conditions or diseases?” The examined conditions included: elevated cholesterol levels, chronic lung diseases, chronic cardiac conditions, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer/malignant tumours, musculoskeletal disorders (bone/joint diseases), and neurological/psychiatric conditions. Additional information regarding the diagnosing physician, diagnosis timeline, and current treatment status was collected for affirmative responses. Chronic illness status was dichotomized as “No” (absence of diagnosed chronic conditions) or “Yes” (presence of at least one diagnosed chronic condition from the nine categories). Independent variables The analysis incorporated multiple sociodemographic and behavioural factors as independent variables based on the previous studies [ 25 Statistical analysis The preliminary study used descriptive statistics to examine the baseline characteristics of the sample, the prevalence of chronic conditions, and the mean EQ-5D score. Aside from that, the findings on the association of EQ-5D score with exposure and the independent variables were carved out using a multiple linear regression model. The linear regression model is expressed as follows: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathrm Y\\;=\\;{\\mathrm\\beta}_0\\;+\\;{\\mathrm\\beta}_1{\\mathrm x}_1\\;+\\;{\\mathrm\\beta}_2{\\mathrm x}_2\\;+\\;...\\;+\\;{\\mathrm\\beta}_{\\mathrm k}{\\mathrm x}_{\\mathrm k}\\;+\\;\\mathrm\\varepsilon$$\\end{document} Where Y \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\beta_0$$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$X_1,\\;X_2,\\;X_3,\\;....\\;,\\;X_k$$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\beta_1\\;\\beta_2\\;\\beta_1\\;........\\;\\beta_k$$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\varepsilon$$\\end{document} 38 For the robustness of the model, we have checked the model linearity, multicollinearity, and goodness of model fit.

Interaction effects between gender (reference: male) and individual chronic conditions on HRQoL were tested. Coefficients [95% CI] for females: Hypertension = 0.14 (− 0.14, 0.41); Diabetes = 0.30 (− 0.97, 0.66); Cancer = 0.24 (− 1.31, 1.78); Chronic lung disease = 0.11 (− 0.39, 0.61); heart disease = 0.30 (− 0.31, 0.90); Stroke = − 0.40 (− 1.32, 0.39); High cholesterol = 0.73 (0.04, 1.43); Bone/joint disorders = − 0.03 (− 0.38, 0.31) ® * p ** p *** p Discussion Multimorbidity was more prevalent among the older population, negatively impacting people’s quality of life and overall well-being. The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) reflects the overall health and well-being, including physical, mental, and social dimensions of well-being, and the studies show that multimorbidity conditions significantly negatively impact HRQoL. However, there was a drought in literature in the Indian context, especially among older populations, on how multimorbidity is associated with HRQoL and how gender plays a role. With this gap, this study examined the HRQoL and its association with multimorbidity among older adults in India. Our study has found that older individuals with a morbidity condition had a significantly lower level of HRQoL. Previous studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between chronic conditions and HRQoL [ 2 12 22 26 39 23 39 Globally, the study shows that chronic conditions lead to diminished HRQoL, reduced physical functioning, and a higher risk of depression and anxiety [ 40 41 32 Furthermore, the our study found that both single and multimorbidity prevalence were higher among females than among males. Additionally, females reported significantly lower HRQoL scores than their male counterparts. HRQoL was strongly associated with chronic conditions; individuals with multimorbidity had substantially lower HRQoL scores than those with only one or no chronic condition. Specifically, chronic diseases such as stroke, neurological disorders, heart diseases, and bone and joint conditions were significantly linked to lower HRQoL levels. This association also varied by gender. The interaction tests confirmed that multimorbidity (aggregated conditions) had a stronger association with poorer HRQoL in females. For individual chronic conditions, associations were directionally consistent across genders but not significantly stronger in females, except for high cholesterol, which uniquely affected males. This suggests that the overall burden of multimorbidity, rather than specific conditions, disproportionately impacts HRQoL among females. Previous results from studies by Sharma et al. (2023), Arokiasamy et al. (2015), and Pati et al. (2019) in India also show that the prevalence of multimorbidity was higher among females than males [ 31 32 42 10 12 43 45 46 The higher prevalence of chronic morbidity among women compared to men can be attributed to gender inequalities in resource allocation, including disparities in income, education, and healthcare. Chauhan et al. (2022) found that women, often disadvantaged in these areas, were more likely to experience multimorbidity. Their study highlighted that individuals with higher education levels, urban residents, and those in higher wealth quintiles had significantly higher risks of multimorbidity, factors that disproportionately affect women in India [ 47 34 The stepwise regression results highlight that socio-economic factors played a substantial role in explaining the gender gap in HRQoL. In the unadjusted model, women had significantly higher HRQoL scores (β = 2.31) compared to men. After accounting for demographic and socio-economic characteristics such as age, education, marital status, residence, caste, religion, employment, household economic status, and living arrangement in the semi-adjusted model, the gender difference reduced to β = 1.00, which is representing approximately 57% decline. However, lifestyle and health-related factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and self-rated health, were additionally considered in the full-adjusted model, the gender gap further declined modestly to β = 0.86, an additional 14% reduction. Overall, about 63% of the initial gender difference in HRQoL was explained by observed covariates, while approximately 37% of the disparity remained unexplained. Despite adjusting for a wide range of sociodemographic, economic and health characteristics, our findings reveal persistent gender differences in both multimorbidity prevalence and HRQoL among older adults. This suggests that these disparities are not fully explained by observable background factors. Biological sex differences may partially account for these variations, as women tend to live longer and may accumulate more chronic conditions over time [ 48 49 50 51 Lower education, poorest wealth, and poor health are also inversely related to lower HRQoL in our study. The management of multimorbidity is complex, caused primarily by the challenges of specialized healthcare, which results in fragmented care, polypharmacy, multiple treatment burdens, mental health problems, and increased healthcare utilization that strains available resources [ 12 21 52 54 55 Chronic condition management should target functions and abilities necessary to manage daily household and social activities, not only the disease itself [ 56 32 57 Our study is among the first to assess the relationship between multimorbidity and HRQoL in an Indian primary care context. We found an inverse relationship between the number of chronic conditions and HRQoL, for both physical and mental domains. Notably, the severity of conditions appears to be an even stronger predictor of diminished well-being than the mere count of chronic diseases. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of multimorbidity should incorporate both the number and severity of conditions to better inform clinical decision-making and public health planning. Limitations and future research directions This study provides important insights into the relationship between multimorbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among older adults in India; however, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The measurement of HRQoL was based on proxy EQ-5D indicators using binary responses, which may not fully reflect the range of quality-of-life experiences and limit comparability with studies using the standard EQ-5D-5 L tool. Additionally, multimorbidity was defined using nine physician-diagnosed conditions, which, while consistent with prior LASI studies, may underestimate true prevalence compared to definitions using a broader set of conditions [ 58 Conclusions In order to achieve the goals of healthy ageing and well-being in India, this study highlights the urgent need to address the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of older adults, particularly those living with multimorbidity. The results indicate that increasing age, female gender, widowed status, low educational attainment, poor economic status, and self-rated poor health are all significantly associated with lower HRQoL, with women bearing a disproportionately higher burden. These findings call for targeted public health interventions such as integrated chronic disease management, gender-sensitive care strategies, and improved access to geriatric services, especially in underserved areas. Strengthening primary healthcare systems to offer coordinated, person-centered care for older adults could play a vital role in improving their overall quality of life and reducing health inequalities. Policymakers should consider these insights when designing and implementing national ageing and non-communicable disease programs.
