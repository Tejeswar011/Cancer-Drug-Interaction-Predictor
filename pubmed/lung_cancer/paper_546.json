Percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting are widely used to treat AMI and have improved survival rates; however, the number of patients progressing to chronic heart failure (CHF) is rapidly increasing worldwide ( 1 2 3 4 5 5 Within the first few hours of cardiac or renal IR, a large number of cardiomyocytes and tubular epithelial cells die and release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as high-mobility group box 1 ( HMGB-1 6 7 5 8 Recent studies have reported a unique neutrophil subset highly expressing the cell surface protein sialic acid–binding immunoglobulin-type lectin F (SiglecF, homolog of human Siglec-8) in the mouse heart after AMI ( 9 10 hi lo 10 hi 11 12 lo 10 CD300-family molecules are encoded by 8 genes in humans and 12 genes in mice ( 13 14 15 16 17 + – + 18 19 19 Here, we showed that CD300a deficiency reduced inflammation-associated tissue damage and dysfunction in the heart and kidney after IR by increasing the efferocytosis by tissue-resident macrophages and decreasing the release of DAMPs from dead cells.

To examine whether CD300a is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac IRI, we established a murine model of myocardial infarction and reperfusion (MI/R) by the occlusion of the left anterior descending artery for 1 hour followed by arterial reperfusion ( Figure 1A Cd300a −/− Figure 1B Cd300a –/– Figure 1C Supplemental Figure 1A https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI184984DS1 + Cd300a −/− Figure 1D Supplemental Figure 1B 20 Cd300a −/− Figure 1E Supplemental Figure 1C Cd300a −/− Figure 1F Cd300a −/− Figure 1G Cd300a fl/fl Cd300a fl/fl Cd300a fl/fl Cd300a fl/fl Supplemental Figure 1D CD300a deficiency reduces IR-induced AKI and fibrosis.

To determine whether CD300a blockade ameliorates cardiac and renal IRI, we injected an anti-CD300a neutralizing mAb or control mAb i.v. into WT mice immediately after MI/R and 2 hours before biIRI and 2-step uIRI. Administration of this antibody did not affect the percentage of neutrophil and macrophage populations in the kidney 1 and 7 days after biIRI ( Supplemental Figure 6A 29 Cd300a −/− Figure 1 Figure 6, A–D 30 Figure 6E To analyze the effect of the anti-CD300a mAb on IRI in the kidney, we used the BM chimeric mice reconstituted with WT or Cd300b −/− Figure 3D Cd300a fl/fl Tomato fl/fl Figure 3E Figure 6F Figure 6, G and H Figure 6I Supplemental Figure 6 Supplemental Figure 6D CD300a on macrophages suppresses CD300b-mediated efferocytosis by inhibiting the CD300b-associated DAP12 activation in vitro and neurological damage after middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice ( 19 Figure 6, F, G, and I A humanized anti-CD300A mAb ameliorates renal IRI in humanized mice.

To study the role of efferocytosis in the development of IRI in humans, we used humanized mice. Treatment of the humanized mice with the humanized anti-CD300A mAb improved AKI after IR. Because the humanized anti-CD300A mAb specifically binds to human CD300A but not mouse CD300a, these results suggest that the mAb enhanced efferocytosis of mouse dead cells by tissue-resident human macrophages and suppressed the inflammation induced by DAMPs, preventing tissue damage such as that to tubular epithelial cells and glomeruli in the mouse kidney. This AKI model using humanized mice is useful for studying the role of humanized CD300A mAb in efferocytosis via human macrophages in vivo. Our results suggest that the anti-CD300A mAb can be used to treat ischemic organ diseases, including AMI, AKI, and others, and for the prevention of the transition to CHF and CKD. Methods Sex as a biological variable. Our study examined only male mice to avoid hormonal cycle–related variability. It is unknown whether the findings are relevant to female mice. Mice.

Male mice (8–12 weeks old, 23–29 g) were used to induce MI/R ( 38 2 39 ELISA. cTnI, NGAL, and HMGB-1 in the plasma were measured using a cardiac Troponin-I ELISA kit (CTNI-1-HSP, Life Diagnostics), mouse NGAL ELISA kit (KE10045, Proteintech), and HMGB-1 ELISA kit II (326078738, Shino-Test Corp.), respectively, in accordance with the manufacturers’ instructions. Infarct and ischemia area measurements. Twenty-four hours after MI/R, the heart was removed, and aortic cannulation was performed to inject 1 mL of saline to remove the remaining intracavitary blood. The LAD was re-ligated at the same location as in the ischemia induction, and then 0.5 mL of 1% Evans blue dye was injected into the aorta through the indwelling cannula to stain the non-ischemic area. Then, the heart was placed in an Eppendorf tube, frozen on dry ice, and sectioned into 1 mm short-axis slices. The slices were incubated with 1% 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution at 37°C for 15 minutes to stain viable myocardium as red and visualize the infarct area as white. The slices were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature. The non-ischemic area stained with Evans blue, the ischemic area stained with TTC (red area), and the infarct area (white area) were measured digitally using ImageJ software (NIH). Tissue preparation for histology. Hearts and kidneys were fixed with 10% formalin-buffered solution and embedded in paraffin. The heart and kidney slices, 3 μm thick, were stained by Masson’s trichrome, periodic acid–Schiff, or Sirius red, and analyzed using a digital BZ-X700 light and fluorescent microscope and BZ-X analysis software (Keyence). The percentage of fibrosis area was calculated as the ratio of fibrosis area to the whole ventricle wall or kidney in each section. To analyze acute tubular necrosis score in the kidney, the percentage of tubules that displayed cell necrosis, loss of brush border, cast formation, and tubule dilatation was counted as follows: 0, none; 1, <10%; 2, 11% to 25%; 3, 26% to 45%; 4, 46% to 75%; and 5, >76%. For the fibrosis score, 10 fields in ×200 magnification were reviewed in each slide. Immunohistochemistry. For multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC), antibody staining and signal amplification were performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol (Opal 7-Color Manual IHC Kit, PerkinElmer) ( 40 + + Echocardiography. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed using the Vevo 2100 imaging system (Fujifilm Visual Sonics) under anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane. Long-axis B-mode and M-mode images were used for measurement of the echocardiography parameters, including left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension (LVDd) and end-systolic dimension (LVDs). The Teichholz formula (volume = 7LVD3/[2.4 + LVD]) was used to calculate the LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and LV end-systolic volume (LVESV). LV ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional shortening (LVFS), measures of LV systolic function, were calculated using the following formula: LVEF (%) = (LVEDV – LVESV)/LVEDV × 100; LVFS (%) = ([LVDd – LVDs]/LVDd) × 100. Cell preparation. After mice were perfused with 20 mL PBS under deep anesthesia, their hearts and kidneys were collected and minced with scissors into about 0.5 mm pieces in 5 mL of RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The hearts were digested with collagenase II (200 U/mL; Worthington Biochemical) and DNase I (60 U/mL; Worthington Biochemical) at 37°C for 30 minutes with agitation on a rotator. Cells were separated using the gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and washed with PBS supplemented with 1% FBS. The kidneys were digested using a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by lysing of erythrocytes using the ammonium chloride–potassium (ACK) lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the isolation of renal macrophages, renal cells were isolated with CD11b + 41 Antibodies and flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with Zombie NIR (BioLegend), Zombie Violet (BioLegend), or propidium iodide to exclude dead cells and anti–mouse CD16/32 (clone 2.4G2, BD Biosciences) or a human FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec) in a staining medium (PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.01% sodium azide) for 15 minutes to block the Fcγ receptors.

Doublets were excluded by gating out the population defined by forward scatter and side scatter in the flow cytometry in all the experiments. For p-STAT3 expression analysis, cells were fixed in Phosflow Lyse/Fix buffer (BD Biosciences) for 10 minutes at 37°C and permeabilized with BD Phosflow Perm Buffer III for 30 minutes on ice before staining with anti–p-STAT3 (pY705) antibody. Biochemical analysis. Plasma BUN and creatinine were measured using FUJI DRI-CHEM SLIDE BUN-PIII and CRE-PIII, respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. Total RNA was extracted from renal cells 1, 5, and 7 days after biIRI or from neutrophils isolated from the heart 3 days after MI/R using FACSAria II (BD Biosciences).
