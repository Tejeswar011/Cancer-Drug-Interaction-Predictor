Introduction Natural antimicrobial cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) serve as a primary defense mechanism for hosts against pathogens and play a crucial role in the innate immune system. Their widespread occurrence across diverse species underscores their fundamental importance in organismal defense. Natural lipopeptides are often considered superior to synthetic counterparts because they exhibit lower toxicity, better environmental compatibility, and greater biodegradability. These properties make natural lipopeptides safer and more sustainable alternatives to chemical surfactants and synthetic compounds. Additionally, they also demonstrate strong biological activity even at low doses, with minimal toxicity, and lower risks of adverse effects such as allergies and irritation. Due to these advantages, natural lipopeptides are favored in diverse applications, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and agriculture. The substantial structural diversity of CLPs produced by various microbial strains suggests a wide range of natural physiological functions [ 1 2 3 4 5 The antimicrobial activities of CLPs encompass antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal effects, effectively suppressing many pathogenic strains responsible for widespread human diseases. For instance, Groupe et al. demonstrated that viscosin exhibits activity against enveloped viruses [ 6 7 8 Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli Enterobacter Salmonella Citrobacter Klebsiella Shigella 9 10 11 12 13 14 Acinetobacter baumannii Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus viridans Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 This review will focus on major common CLP producers, including Pseudomonas Streptomyces Bacillus Figure 1 Table 1 2.

Surfactins, Iturins, and Fengicins The surfactin, iturin, and fengycin groups consist of distinct compounds that share peptides of the same length but differ in amino acid residues at specific positions. Each group includes several homologs, varying in the length and isomerism of their fatty acid chains, resulting in significant structural diversity [ 199 Tyr 3 Pseudomonas 200 Figure 7 201 202 iso anteiso Tyr 9 d iso anteiso It was found that surfactin and iturin caused lysis of protoplasts prepared from B. megaterium Micrococcus luteus, 203 204 203 205 206 Mycoplasma hyorhinis Mycoplasma orale 207 205 207 Surfactins, iturins, and fengycins bind to membranes via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions and can disrupt lipid membranes depending on lipopeptide concentration due to micelle and pore formation. Detailed discussion of their incorporation into lipid bilayers, distribution between inner and outer leaflets, consequent lipid disorganization, and membrane permeabilization due to different modes of action is presented in exhaustive reviews [ 208 209 210 211 Both surfactin and iturin A induce current fluctuations indicative of ion-permeable pores in lipid membranes. Surfactin-induced current fluctuations span a broader range compared to iturin A. In glyceromonooleate–decane bilayers, the conductance of iturin A-induced pores in 1 M KCl ranged from 6 to 30 pS, whereas surfactin pore amplitudes ranged from 10 to 140 pS [ 49 51 49 50 49 50 51 52 200 49 51 52 Addition of fengycin to one side of a bilayer consisting of POPC/POPE/POPG/ergosterol at 0.1–0.5 μM leads to step-like current fluctuations of varying conductance in the pA range. Among channels induced by fengycin, single pores characterized by 1.5-fold higher conductance at positive transmembrane voltages than at negative ones predominate. Analysis of macroscopic current dependence on lipopeptide concentration suggests that fengycin dimers are involved in forming conductive subunits. Fengycin’s ability to form ion-conducting pores does not depend on the shape of membrane lipids but significantly correlates with the presence of negatively charged lipids, likely due to pore-forming properties depending on its membrane conformation [ 53 4.2. Octapeptins Octapeptins are a family of lipooctapeptide antibiotics with a broad antimicrobial spectrum, most of which were identified approximately 40 years ago [ 14 193 212 213 214 215 Bacillus circulans Paenibacillus tianmuensis 193 Figure 7 d Dab 8 d Ser 8 l Dab 8 l -Thr 9 l -Dab 10 N Figure 7 Phe Phe 5 Phe 4 Ser Dab 1 Phe d N N Using neutron reflectometry, Han et al.

The affinity of octapeptin C4 to model membranes was compared in the presence and absence of lipid A. Octapeptin C4 bound lipid A-free membranes but inserted significantly more into lipid A-containing membranes. Additionally, octapeptin C4 caused slight leakage of carboxyfluorescein from lipid vesicles composed of a neutral POPC and negatively charged POPG mixture (4:1 molar ratio) without lipid A [ 194 218 219 Table 1 54 4.3.

These fatty acids often contain unsaturation and/or multiple substituents, including halogenation, methylation, and hydroxylation. Incorporation of the fatty acid is enabled through hydroxylation or amination, typically at the β-carbon or another carbon, to facilitate bond formation. In some cases, hydroxylated fatty acids are further substituted with saccharides or amino acids [ 237 238 Puwainaphycins and minutissamides demonstrate diverse biological activities such as cardiovascular effects, antiproliferative properties, and antifungal action.

Conclusions CLPs are receiving increasing attention as a distinct class of compounds offering advantageous characteristics as antibiotics in comparison to small molecules and macromolecular antibodies. Pseudomonas Bacilli Another common feature of many CLPs is their ability to self-assemble at the target cell membrane. This assembly leads to membrane depolarization and/or leakage of intracellular components through the formation of oligomeric transmembrane pores or defects in lipid packing. The literature reports that CLPs assemble into aggregates composed of monomers ranging from 2 (e.g., iturin or fengycin) to 8 (e.g., tolaasin or daptomycin). Some aggregates form in solution, which facilitates delivery of higher concentrations of the agents to the target membrane. Typically, the ion-permeable aggregates generate current amplitudes in the picoampere range. Thus, CLPs are capable of forming pores according to generally accepted models of pore formation. Based on the structural features of the CLPs considered here, it can be assumed that agents with relatively large cyclic peptide rings and small external peptide segments are capable of forming toroidal pores. Examples include syringomycin E, viscosin, and daptomycin. A second group comprises CLPs with external peptide tails containing many amino acid residues, such as syringopeptins, tolaasins, and fuscopeptins. These agents form ion-permeable pores according to the barrel-stave model. For CLPs whose pore-forming capability has not been experimentally demonstrated, one may infer from the available data that they likely possess similar abilities. Given the rise in antibiotic resistance and the increasing mortality from infections, new antimicrobial drugs are being developed with the goal of resisting resistance development over time. This often involves formulating combination antibiotics. Such combinations not only enhance efficacy by targeting multiple pathways simultaneously, but also reduce the likelihood of resistance emergence in pathogenic strains. The findings from this review may help broaden the spectrum of available therapeutic agents.
