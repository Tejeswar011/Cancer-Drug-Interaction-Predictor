Given their intrinsic mechanisms of action and their biological nature, development of antidrug antibodies (ADA) represents an important aspect to consider during clinical evaluation. ADAs can potentially affect viral kinetics and/or dynamics, ultimately resulting in reductions or even loss of drug efficacy. Here, we present a semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model characterizing the interplay between V937 and neutralizing ADA in cancer patients receiving the V937 oncolytic virus. Methods The quantitative framework has been developed integrating viral load and ADA titers from 208 cancer patients who received V937 following intratumoral or intravascular administration, in monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. Results The model successfully captured both V937 time course and the dynamics of ADAs under the different settings, showing no meaningful impact of ADAs on viral kinetics. Moreover, tumor response was neither affected by the preexistence or development of ADAs, which can be explained by the primary role of the immune system in the response. Conclusions This quantitative and (semi-) mechanistic framework can be expanded to other oncolytic viruses and used to explore under which scenarios a relevant impact could be observed, thus supporting the development of novel oncolytic viral therapies.

We present a modelling framework characterizing the impact of neutralizing ADAs on viral kinetics and tumor response of the V937 oncolytic virus, integrating clinical data from different routes of administration, dosing schemas, and even in drug combination. This quantitative and (semi-) mechanistic framework can be expanded to other oncolytic viruses and used to explore the scenarios under which a relevant impact could be observed, thus supporting the development of novel oncolytic viral therapies. Introduction Since the approval of the first immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) in 2001, there has been an exponential increase in approved and under-development immunotherapies from biological origins. Biologics have an intrinsic capability to induce a humoral response leading to the appearance of antidrug antibodies (ADAs). Hence, the increased use of this type of therapeutics is raising questions regarding their potential immunogenicity, and ultimately, their impact on safety and clinical response [ 1 2 Different therapeutic areas have shown the important consequences of ADA formation for therapeutic proteins, mainly monoclonal antibodies. More specifically, ADAs can hamper clinical efficacy, directly neutralizing the drug activity and/or altering its pharmacokinetics (PK) [ 3 4 2 5 OV represents a growing class of anticancer agents that rely on their capability to preferentially replicate within tumor cells, inducing an immunogenic cell death and stimulating the host antitumor immunity [ 6 7 ADA occurrence should be viewed as a continuous dynamic process (rather than positive/negative) resulting from the interplay between the OV and the immune system of the host. The development of mechanistic-based mathematical models offers an opportunity to tackle complex systems, like the one presented here, integrating information from different sources in order to provide a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the impact of ADAs on PK, safety, and efficacy [ 8 9 In general, and regardless of the therapeutic area, models describing the dynamics of ADA formation and residence are scarce [ 10 11 V937 is a naturally occurring coxsackievirus that has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumor malignancies. The objective of this work was to develop a semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model characterizing the dynamics of ADA in cancer patients after receiving V937 OV in monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab following intratumoral or intravascular administration. In addition, the impact of ADA development on viral kinetics and tumor response was assessed. Material and Methods Clinical Studies For the analysis, V937 mRNA levels and anti-V937 antibody titers were pooled together from four different clinical trials. A detailed description of the protocols, including study design, patients, and dosing schemas can be found here [ 12 14 NCT02043665 12 NCT01227551 NCT01636882 13 NCT02565992 14 S1 1 Table 1 Summary of patient characteristics Protocol name V937 monotherapy V937 combination All V937-006 MK3475-200 Part A MK3475-200 Part B V937-007 Number of patients 70 18 85 35 208 Age (years) a 64 (15.3) [28–94] 63.2 (12.8) [31–80] 65.9 (9.8) [40.7–83.6] 68.3 (11.8) [43–94] 65.3 (12.5) [28–94] Sex b Male 45 (64.3) 13 (72.2) 60 (70.6%) 27 (77.1%) 145 (69.7) Female 25 (35.7) 5 (27.8) 25 (29.4%) 8 (22.9%) 63 (30.3) Weight (kg) a 86.9 (22.6) [45.7–146] 78.3 (15.4) [54.7–105] 81.1 (19.1) [68–150] 91.4 (24.4) [59.1–164]) 84.6 (21.3) [45.7–164] Race b White 69 (98.6) 17 (94.4) 75 (88.2%) 32 (91.4%) 193 (92.8) Asian 1 (1.4) 1 (5.6) 6 (7.1%) 1 (2.9%) 9 (4.3) Hawaiian 1 (1.2%) 1 (0.5) Black 1 (2.9%) 1 (0.5) Other 3 (3.5%) 1 (2.9%) 4 (1.9) Ethnicity b Hispanic 1 (1.4) 2 (2.4%) 1 (2.9%) 4 (1.9) Non-Hispanic 69 (98.6) 16 (88.9) 80 (94.1%) 34 (97.1) 199 (95.7) Not reported 1 (5.6) 1 (1.2%) 2 (1) NA 1 (5.6) 2 (2.4%) 3 (1.4) Indication b Melanoma 70 (100) 4 (22.2) 35 (100) 109 (52.4) NSCLC 5 (27.8) 46 (54.1%) 51 (24.5) BL 5 (27.8) 39 (45.9%) 44 (21.2) MRPC 4 (22.2) 4 (1.9) Baseline tumor size (mm) a 54.4 (41.2) [10–205] 85.5 (71.5) [15–272] 65.2 (44.5) [14–234] 63.6 (56.9) [13–274] 63.1 (48.9) [10–274] Baseline ECOG status b 0 49 (70) 7 (38.9) 39 (45.9%) 21 (60) 116 (55.8) 1 17 (24.3) 8 (44.4) 46 (54.1%) 13 (37.1) 84 (40.4) 2 3 (16.7) 3 (1.4) NA 4 (5.7) 1 (2.9) 5 (2.4) BL MRPC NA NSCLC a b The study protocols and amendments were approved by local institutional review boards or ethics committees at each participating institution. The studies were conducted in accordance with local laws, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients provided written informed consent. Sample Collection and Analytical Method Blood samples were obtained at different time points (Table S1 5 15 13 In addition, best overall response computed using the immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) criteria [ 16 Data Analysis Data were analyzed following the non-linear mixed effects modelling approach. For modelling purposes, reciprocal of ADA titers (i.e., dilution factor [DL]) were used and treated as a continuous variable. V937 mRNA serum levels ( n S2 6 17 Pharmacokinetic-Antidrug Antibody (PK-ADA) Model Development A sequential and integrative modelling approach was followed during model building, increasing model complexity as needed upon inclusion of new information. First, a population PK model was developed using V937 mRNA in the absence of pembrolizumab administration (i.e., monotherapy studies and measurements prior to initial pembrolizumab dose on day 8). At this step, only observations up to day 8 (~ 40%) were used to avoid the potential impact of ADA on viral pharmacokinetics. Different compartmental models were tested, including serum and a theoretical tumor compartment to accommodate for both administration routes (intravenous and intratumoral). First-order transit and elimination processes were assumed, unless otherwise indicated by the data. Additional model complexities such as viral replication were explored as additional drug inputs dependent on the OV levels in the theoretical tumor compartment. In this regard, viral dynamic models [ 18 19 The impact of ADAs on viral pharmacokinetics was evaluated taking into consideration the full time course of the continuous variable (hereafter referred to as the ADA model). A turnover-based model where viral levels ultimately induce the appearance of ADA was assumed. A varying number of compartments (i.e., transit compartment models) were explored to account for the delayed appearance of ADA in the different clinical studies. Similarly, the impact of ADA time course on viral PK clearance was explored analyzing both sources of information simultaneously. Finally, the impact of the main design covariates (i.e., route of administration, pre-existence of ADA levels, and combination therapy) on the ADA model was explored using a stepwise approach, first performing a univariate analysis of each of the covariates on different model parameters. A schematic representation of the final model, together with model equations, can be found in Fig. 1 2 Fig. 1 Schematic and mathematical representation of the final model for V937 viral kinetics and antidrug antibody (ADA) development. Upon intravenous or intratumoral administration, the oncolytic virus (OV) can distribute bi-directionally between serum (S) and tumor (TUM), and serum and peripheral tissues (PER), or can be cleared from serum. Note, that following IT administration, only a fraction of the dose will be available for distribution to serum. Subsequently, serum levels of the OV can activate B cells (Bcel1), which, with some delay (Bcel2 and Bcel3), will trigger the appearance of ADAs in the blood stream.

When models were nested, a drop of 3.84 or 6.63 in OFV was considered significant at the levels of 5 and 1%, respectively. Regarding parameter precision, non-parametric bootstrapping was used when relative standard errors (RSE) provided by NONMEM were not obtained or were unrealistically low. Model performance was evaluated using prediction corrected visual predictive checks (predcorr VPC) [ 20 Exploring Impact of ADA on Tumor Response Tumor size was not included in the current PK-ADA framework. As such, and to mechanistically evaluate the impact of ADA development on tumor response, the ADA model described in Sect. 2.2.1 1 15 4 SYN TR DEG 50 21 Model simulations were performed using RsSimulx 2.0.0 R package following a validation of model implementation (data not shown). Results PK Model The time course of V937 mRNA levels stratified by administration route and treatment group can be found in Supplementary Figure 1 (see ESM). A three-compartment model accounting for the central, the (theoretical) tumor and other tissue compartments adequately described the time course of V937 mRNA levels, as well as the percentage of data below the limit of detection (~ 45% of the data used for model building). Similar intercompartmental clearance was observed for both peripheral compartments (tumor and others), and thus a single parameter estimate was used to increase model stability ( p F IT ESM 7 Final parameter estimates can be found in Table 2 F IT Table 2 Final parameter estimates of the selected pharmacokinetic and ADA models Parameter Typical (RSE) a IIV [95% CI] PK model of V937 V S 87.9 (31.2) [47.2–159] CL (L/h) 111 (15.5) [78.7–148] 67.5 (14.4) [46.5–90.5] Q TUM Q PER 35.3 (33.9) [17.4–67.1] V TUM 103 (26.9) [58.8–173] V PER 893 (48.2) [454–1620] F IT 0.201 (32.0) [0.11–0.377] 4.17 (14.5) [2.22–7.11] b Error (log copies/mL) 1.33 (3.88) [1.22–1.43] ADA model K SYN 113 (10.3) [109–171] 395 (7.9) [211–508] EC 50 8 0.754 (13.8) [0.554–1.05] K TR -3 −1 5.14 (7.98) [4.34–5.92] 95.2 (7.70) [77.1–123] K DEG -3 −1 0.250 (12.8) [0.168–0.290] 96.8 (29.3) [81.4–374] Error (log DF) 1.01 (6.76) [0.900–1.18] ADA CL EC 50 cell F IT K DEG K SYN cells K TR cell OV Q PER Q TUM V PER V TUM a b \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\sqrt{{e}^{{\\omega }^{2}}-1}$$\\end{document} e 2 - 1 2 More importantly, the model that was developed was capable of describing not only the data used for model building (i.e., data prior to pembrolizumab administration and before the appearance of ADA), but also V937 mRNA levels observed during combination therapy and after multiple doses (Fig. 1 S2 1 2 Fig. 2 Prediction corrected (predcorr) visual predictive check of the final pharmacokinetic ( A B prediction interval ADA BLD DL i.v. i.t. x A PK-ADA Model After drug administration, an increase in neutralizing antibodies was observed in all patients (Supplementary Figure 1, see ESM 1 As a first approach to characterize the time course of ADAs, previously obtained population PK parameters were fixed, and different structural PD models were explored keeping both PK and ADA observations in the dataset (PPPD method [ 22 B cells 50 7 p p n 3 ESM 1 7 Fig. 3 In silico exploration of antidrug antibody (ADA) neutralization effect in oncolytic viral therapy.

A dose of 3 × 10 8 50 A simultaneous analysis of viral and ADA levels was attempted as a second step. However, ADAs did not show any significant impact on viral clearance when used as a continuous measure, nor as a categorical time-variant covariate. Final model representation and parameter estimates can be found in Fig. 1 2 Covariate Analysis In this step, a covariate analysis to evaluate the potential impact of route of administration, treatment (monotherapy versus combination) as well as pre-existing ADA levels on ADA development was undertaken, but none of the evaluated models was deemed superior. Results from this analysis can be found in ESM 3 Impact of ADA on Tumor Response The PK-ADA model was integrated into an existing quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model that mechanistically describes tumor volume over time in response to V937. This merged framework allows us to explore in silico a potential impact of ADA on tumor response. In this regard, a simulation exercise was conducted to explore the impact of different degrees of ADA neutralization after intratumoral administration, taking into consideration different infectivity levels (Fig. 3 Indeed, when OVs exhibit high infectivity (even in the absence of replication), a similar positive response is obtained after repeated intratumoral administration, regardless of the assumed neutralization level (Fig. 3 Interestingly, and supporting the simulation results, an impact of maximum individual predicted ADAs on best overall tumor response was not identified in our clinical setting, where high infectivity was estimated (Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Predicted levels of neutralizing antidrug antibodies (ADAs) by best tumor response according to iRECIST criteria. CR DF i.v. i.t. PD PR SD Discussion The increasing use of immunomodulatory agents for cancer therapies, such as antibodies targeting immune checkpoints, chimeric antigen receptor [CAR]-T cells or oncolytic virus, is raising questions regarding the potential impact of immunogenicity on treatment response [ 23 24 In this work, we present a novel population model to semi-mechanistically describe the interplay between V937 exposure and the development of neutralizing antibodies, integrating data from different clinical trials where two routes of administration (intravascular and intratumoral) were used, in addition to OV administration in monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab. In agreement with previous analyses of a subset of the PK data [ 15 There is a large debate on whether pre-existing immunity can decrease OV efficacy by enhancing viral clearance, which in many cases has resulted in the inclusion of seroprevalence as an exclusion criteria for clinical trials [ 13 25 26 27 In addition to pre-existing immunity, newly developed neutralizing antibodies have the potential to impact PK and tumor response. From a modelling perspective, most efforts have been focused on assessing the impact of ADAs as covariates on the PK of monoclonal antibodies [ 8 28 11 29 10 30 To account for the dynamics of neutralizing antibody appearance after oncolytic viral therapy, serum OV levels were used as the trigger for neutralizing antibody production via a saturable model (i.e., accounting for a maximum neutralizing antibody production rate). A relatively low EC 50 31 32 33 Despite the lack of impact of neutralizing antibodies on OV exposure, one important aspect to elucidate is the potential impact on clinical efficacy. Current preclinical and clinical data suggest that, even if OV replication might be decreased, pre-existing immunity should generally not be considered an obstacle to primary tumor clearance, at least in the setting of intratumoral OV therapy [ 26 34 35 36 Conclusion We present a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model capable of integrating information from multiple sources in order to successfully characterize the time course of both V937 and their trigger-neutralizing antibodies, and evaluate their interplay. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first efforts to address the dynamics of neutralizing antibodies in the context of oncolytic viral therapy. In this regard, this work provides valuable knowledge regarding the lack of significant impact of neutralizing antibodies not only on viral kinetics, but also on ultimate tumor response. Moreover, it provides a modelling framework to further explore in silico scenarios where immunogenicity could play a relevant role in viral kinetics, thus further supporting the quantitative understanding of the biological mechanisms behind oncolytic viral therapy.
