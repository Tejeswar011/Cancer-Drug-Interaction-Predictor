Blastomycosis is endemic in central and southern North America but rare in China. It can mimic community-acquired pneumonia, tuberculosis, or cancer. We describe a patient who initially had tuberculosis diagnosed and later had blastomycosis diagnosed through metagenomic detection, which aided diagnosis and treatment. Clinicians should consider blastomycosis in differential diagnoses for respiratory diseases.

( 1 1 2 Blastomyces percursus B. dermatitidis 3 4 B. percursus A 38-year-old man from Xinxiang, Henan Province, China, sought care after 4 months of cough, hemoptysis, and weight loss. He had been treated empirically with antimicrobial drugs at a local hospital without substantial improvement. He had no history of incarceration, foreign travel, or known immunosuppression. He worked as a truck driver and had lived locally for years. Chest computed tomography scans revealed bilateral lobar infiltrates and patchy opacities ( Figure 1 Aspergillus galactomannan Figure 1 Chest computed tomography (CT) images from a patient with disseminated blastomycosis mimicking tuberculosis, China. A, B) Chest CT at first admission revealed bilateral lobar infiltrates (A) and patchy opacities (B). C, D) Chest CT taken 2 months later showed resolution of left lung lesions but progression of right lung lesions. Two months later, the patient was readmitted with new cutaneous lesions on his abdomen and lower limbs, which were nodular and verrucous ( Figure 2 Figure 1 Figure 2 Cutaneous lesion on the abdomen from a case of disseminated blastomycosis mimicking tuberculosis, China. Two months after treatment for tuberculosis, new cutaneous lesions developed on the patient’s abdomen and lower limbs; molecular methods on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid detected Blastomyces percursus Repeat bronchoscopy was performed. GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Cephalid, https://www.cepheid.com B. percursus The patient received intravenous liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/d) for 2 weeks, then oral itraconazole (200 mg 2×/d) for 1 month. After treatment, both pulmonary and cutaneous lesions resolved. Itraconazole remains a preferred agent for treating mild-to-moderate pulmonary and disseminated blastomycosis ( 8 Blastomycosis can involve virtually any organ and often masquerades as TB, leading to frequent misdiagnoses. In this case, the patient was treated with multiple drugs for TB, delaying accurate diagnosis by > B. percursus 5 6 7 The delay in diagnosis led to unnecessary drug exposure and progressive dissemination, including cutaneous lesions. Medications for TB carry substantial risks, including hepatotoxicity and bone marrow suppression. The lack of reliable rapid diagnostic tests for B. percursus This case illustrates how blastomycosis, although rare in China, can mimic pulmonary TB and lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Clinicians should include blastomycosis in the differential diagnosis of unexplained pulmonary infections. Increasing awareness of endemic mycoses and integrating metagenomic tools into routine diagnostics could improve the precision and timeliness of care.
