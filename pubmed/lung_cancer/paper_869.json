While the majority of endometrial cancers are associated with excellent five-year survival, approximately 20% of patients with endometrial cancer recur and ultimately die from their disease. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-inspired pragmatic molecular classification of endometrial cancer has transformed categorization and risk group assignment of endometrial cancers [ [1] [2] [3] [4] POLE [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] POLE 10 POLE 11 12 13 Proteome profiling has been used to discover the biological underpinnings of various cancers such as altered metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Within the framework of molecular classification of endometrial carcinomas, there is tremendous interest in further refining prognosis or providing greater precision in treatment selection. Our objective was to determine the value of proteomic assessment of endometrial cancers, across and within the landscape of the 4 molecular subtypes and to assess the feasibility of proteomic stratification from first diagnostic biopsy. Our large scale proteomic analysis of the four endometrial cancer molecular subtypes using patient hysterectomy and biopsy material provides a rich resource that associates biological features for a cohort of molecularly defined endometrial cancers with associated clinical characteristics and outcomes data. Methods and materials Cohort description Following institutional review board approval, we identified a cohort of endometrial cancers that had previously undergone molecular classification and with complete clinicopathologic data and outcomes. A total of 184 individual formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) samples extracted for proteomics, from 150 individual cases. Two samples were removed from the subtype analysis because one had insufficient proteomics signal and the other was reclassified as an ovarian tumor. The remaining 182 samples in the study consisted of 159 hysterectomies and 23 endometrial biopsies (obtained from office pipelle/sample or curettage). For subtype analysis, we used the hysterectomy proteomic data only (n=148). To examine technical reproducibility, we included 11 replicate hysterectomy samples, defined as being from a different tumor block of the same case. To compare hysterectomy to biopsy, we included 21 biopsy samples which were matched to hysterectomy samples. The final cohort (n=148) used for subtype analysis contained 34 POLE 2 Protein isolation, reduction, and alkylation, FFPE tissue Tubes containing 10 µM slices of tissue were centrifuged for 1 min at 20,000 x g. Xylenes (800 μL, CAT #214736) was added to each tube, gently pipette mixed, and incubated for 5 min to deparaffinize the sample. Samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 20,000 x g and the supernatant discarded, then washed with an additional 800 μL of xylenes. 100 μL of lysis buffer (500 mM Tris-Cl pH 8, (CAT#C4706, Sigma), 2% w/v sodium dodecyl sulfate (Bio-Rad, CAT#1610302), 1% v/v NP40 (CAT#492016-100ML, Merck Millipore), 1% v/v Triton X100 (CAT#T8787, Sigma), 5 mM EDTA (Thermo Fisher, CAT#15575020), 50 mM sodium chloride (CAT#S7653, Sigma), 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride, 40 mM chloroacetamide (in HPLC water) was added to the sample and the solution was heated at 95°C for 90 min with mixing at 1000 rpm. Tubes were cooled to room temperature prior to sample cleanup using the single pot solid phase enhanced sample preparation (SP3) method [ 22 SP3 sample cleanup SP3 was adapted from the published method [ 22 ° TMT labeling TMT 11-plex labeling kits were obtained from Pierce (CAT#A34808). Each TMT label (5 mg per vial) was reconstituted in 500 μL of acetonitrile and frozen at -80°C. Prior to labeling, TMT labels were removed from the freezer and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature. TMT label was added to the peptide sample in two volumetrically equal steps of 10 µL (100 µg), 30 min apart at room temperature. Reactions were quenched by addition of 10 µL of 1 M glycine (CAT#G8898, Sigma). Labeled peptides were concentrated in a Labconco centrivap concentrator (CAT#781001010234) with a ThermoSavant RVT400 refrigerated vapor trap (CAT#RVT400-230) to remove acetonitrile, and the differentially labeled peptides were combined. All samples were labeled with one of 11 TMT labels and batched prior to mass spectrometry. Batches contained 8 tumor samples, one SuperMix control (a mixture of lysates of 13 common cancer cell lines [ 19 SepPak clean-up SepPak C18, 50 mg columns were purchased from Waters (CAT#WAT054960). TMT labeled samples were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma, CAT#T6508-100ML) to a final concentration of 1%. Columns were washed with two aliquots of 1 mL 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in HPLC grade acetonitrile (Sigma, CAT#34851) and conditioned using two aliquots of 1 mL 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in HPLC grade water. Samples were loaded and rinsed with three aliquots of 1 mL of 0.1% formic acid (Sigma, CAT#33015) in HPLC grade water and peptides were eluted using two aliquots of 600 µL 0.1% formic acid in 20%/80% HPLC water/HPLC acetonitrile. Sample volume was reduced to less than 200 µL by vacuum centrifugation. HPLC fractionation High-pH reversed phase separation was performed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system equipped with a diode array detector (254, 260, and 280 nm). Fractionation was performed on a Kinetix EVO C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 1.7 μm core shell, 100Å, Phenomenex). Elution was performed at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min using a gradient of mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8) and B (acetonitrile), from 3% to 35% over 60 min. Fractions were collected every minute across the elution window (8-52 min) for a total of 48 fractions which were concatenated to 12 final fractions (e.g. 1 + 13 + 25 + 37 = fraction 1; 2 + 14 + 26 + 38 = fraction 2, etc). Fractions were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid HPLC water prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis Analysis of peptide fractions was carried out on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid MS platform (Thermo Scientific). Samples were introduced using an Easy-nLC 1000 system (Thermo Scientific). Columns used for trapping and separations were packed in-house. Trapping columns were packed in 100 μm internal diameter capillaries to a length of 2.5-5 mm with C18 beads (Reprosil-Pur, Dr. Maisch, 3 μm particle size). Trapping was carried out for a total volume of 10 μL at a flow of 25 µL/min. After trapping, gradient elution of peptides was performed on a C18 (Reprosil-Pur, Dr. Maisch, 3 μm particle size) column packed in-house to a length of 25 cm in 100 μm internal diameter capillaries with a laser-pulled and fritted electrospray tip. Elution was performed at a flow rate of 450 nL/min. Mobile phase B (HPLC acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) was increased from 3-7% in mobile phase A (water and 0.1% formic acid) over 2 min, to 25% B over 94 min, to 40% B over 17 min, then a 1 min increase to 80% and the column was washed for 6 min. Data acquisition on the ThermoFisher Orbitrap Fusion was carried out using a data-dependent method. MS1 survey scans in positive ion mode covering the normal mass range of 350 – 1200 were acquired at a resolution of 120,000 (at m/z m/z Data processing of mass spectrometry data Raw MS data were searched using Sequest HT algorithm through Proteome Discoverer suite (v2.4) (Thermo Scientific), against a human reference (2018/08/03 Swissprot; 20,369 sequences). Precursor and fragment mass tolerance were set at 10 ppm and 0.05 Da, respectively. Dynamic modifications included Oxidation (15.995 Da, M), Acetylation (42.011 Da, N-Term), Methylation (14.016 Da,K) and TMT (229.163 Da,K). Static modification included Carbamidomethyl (57.021 Da, C), and TMT (229.163 Da, N-Term). Peptide-to-spectrum matches (PSM) were filtered using Percolator by searching the results against a decoy sequence set, only PSMs with FDR < 1% were retained in the downstream analysis. PSMs were further filtered out if they had a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) lower than 10 in the PIS channel and if they mapped to more than one unique protein. To normalize input signal, channel total intensity was scaled to 1e08. Each S/N was normalized to PIS channel (ratio) and, for each peptide, the median ratio of the 3 PSMs with the lowest isolation interference was used. Peptides were then median-aggregated to the protein level. Proteins with fewer than two identified peptides were excluded from analysis in the global proteome data. To estimate protein relative abundance, the S/N sum of the 3 highest abundance PSMs was taken and the average across channel was multiplied to S/N protein ratios obtained previously. Differential protein expression analysis was performed with Differential Expression analysis of quantitative Mass Spectrometry data (DEqMS) R package [ 23 24 25 26 27 A previously published endometrial carcinoma cohort [ 28 29 Data availability The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE [ 30 Additional methods for immunohistochemistry, organoid culture, CRISPR-Cas9 knockouts, and western blotting can be found in Supplemental Methods and Materials. Results Proteomics cohort description Global proteome profiling using the clinical SP3-CTP workflow [ 22 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Cohort Description. A. POLE B C Fig 1 Our cohort had approximately equal distribution of the 4 molecular subtypes; 34 (23%) POLE Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 In total, we quantified 6089 proteins, with a minimum coverage of 2 peptides, one of which was unique, with 3706 proteins quantified in each sample across the 23 TMT-11 batches. We tested for reproducibility between duplicate hysterectomy samples by analyzing the 11 biological replicate samples run, where a different tumor block from the same patient was sampled. The correlation between tumors sampled in different locations of the endometrium was very high, most having a Pearson correlation coefficient greater than 0.9, with the 3 lowest correlations (0.895, 0.905, 0.929) found within POLE Consensus clustering of proteomic data Consensus clustering was performed on hysterectomy samples from 148 patients, resulting in four proteomic clusters ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 POLE Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Clustering of the proteomic data.

The endometrioid tumors were enriched for proteins such as PIGR, ASRGL1, and HGD (Fig. S7A). We compared our results with those in the Dou et al. proteomic study which had also performed a comparison of serous and non-serous tumors [ 28 Protein expression in relation to ARID1A status ARID1A [53] [54] [55] Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Correlation between ARID1A expression and retinoic acid pathway and neutrophil infiltration.

A. B. C. D. Fig 5 Discussion Molecular classification in endometrial cancer has enabled consistent pathology classification and reporting, informs prognosis and risk group assignment, and can direct adjuvant conventional or targeted therapies. We performed SP3-CTP [ 22 POLE POLE Our study included 23 endometrial biopsies, of which 22 also had matched hysterectomy specimens from the same individual. Hysterectomies are generally performed several weeks to months after endometrial biopsy. We were able to achieve high quality proteomic data from biopsy specimens, and demonstrate a high degree of concordance with the matched biopsy-hysterectomy samples, suggesting the protein expression in these tumors remains relatively stable between the time of biopsy to hysterectomy. The ability to achieve whole proteome profiling from biopsy is extremely important as increasingly, molecular classification of endometrial cancer is being performed on these diagnostic samples and used to direct surgery and treatment, therefore proteomic refinement at this early time point would be hugely beneficial. Notably, we found an enrichment of blood proteins in biopsy samples and extracellular matrix proteins in the hysterectomy samples, both of which would need to be taken into account in interpreting proteomic data in future studies, and with removal of these components the concordance between samples from the same patient was increased. Unsupervised clustering of the proteomic data from all 4 molecular subtypes of endometrial cancer generated four clusters; ‘Adhesion’, ‘Immune’, ‘Proliferation’, and ‘Metabolic’. Pathway analysis showed enrichment for pathways involved DNA replication, transcription, and translation in the ‘Proliferation’ cluster. The proteins expressed in tumors of the ‘Proliferation’ cluster are associated with a high rate of proliferation and markers of poor outcome, such as a serous histotype and p53abn subtype. The proteins included ISG15, PRKDC, MCM4, and MCM6 [ 34 [56] [57] [58] 59 33 60 As the leukocyte activation pathway was associated with Cluster 2, as well as proteins expressed by immune cells (LYZ, MPO1, AZU1) it was named the ‘Immune’ cluster. Interestingly, this cluster was not enriched in MMRd and POLEmut tumors (although representatives from these and all molecular subtypes were noted) and had more p53abn, high stage, and high grade cases compared to the ‘Adhesion’ and ‘Metabolic’ clusters. Despite the high proportion of p53abn endometrial cancers the ‘Immune’ cluster had the better survival of all the clusters. The improved survival may be explained by a high level of immune infiltrates, which has been associated with better outcomes in endometrial cancer and other cancers. There is already strong evidence and FDA approval for ICI therapy in MMRd endometrial tumors, however, there is a great need to identify additional biomarkers to determine which mismatch repair proficient (MMRp) endometrial cancers may benefit from ICI’s. The Cluster 2 ‘Immune’ proteomic subset may represent an opportunity to identify patients who may benefit from ICI’s [ [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] The ‘Metabolic’ and ‘Adhesion’ clusters had intermediate survival and consist largely of endometrioid histotype. While these clusters provide little information on prognosis, they do give insight into the biology underlying the tumors in these two clusters. Proteins enriched in the ‘Adhesion’ cluster compared to the other clusters include proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton (CNN1, TAGLN, TPM1) [ [67] [68] [69] 70 71 Comparisons of differential protein expression between serous and endometrioid histotypes in our data were consistent with previous studies demonstrating enrichment of UCHL1, HMGA1, and TP53 (p53) in serous tumors [ 32 72 32 73 32 [72] [73] [74] 59 75 51 76 77 78 51 We compared the present proteomic study to a previous study of 95 tumors, of which 83 were endometrioid and 12 serous [ 28 POLE 28 POLE POLE 79 POLE POLE TP53 80 POLE POLE POLE 81 82 RPL22L1 was found to be enriched in our patients of MMRd subtype, as has been previously reported [ 28 83 [84] [85] [86] 43 44 [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] [93] [94] Some of the proteins expressed highly in NSMP tumors are often expressed in normal cells and are associated with tumors and better outcomes. The keratins found to be expressed more highly in NSMP tumors compared to other subtypes (KRT5, KRT6A, and KRT75) are basal cell markers and can be also found in endometrial hyperplasia [ 95 [95] [96] [97] 98 99 100 [101] [102] [103] 77 104 Within p53abn endometrial cancers, p53 protein was more highly expressed compared to the other 3 molecular groups, consistent with most p53abn tumors having missense mutations that cause an accumulation in p53 protein [ 105 106 107 GRB7 ERBB2 38 108 40 42 109 ERBB2 GRB7 110 [111] [112] [113] [114] [115] [116] GRB7 ERBB2 [117] [118] [119] Some recurrent mutations appear across all molecular subtypes, including ARID1A [53] [54] [55] ARID1A 55 [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] 125 126 127 Arid1A 128 Arid1A 129 130 131 In tumors with ARID1A expression, we observed increased expression of proteins involved in retinoic acid signaling, including RBP1, which binds retinol in the cytoplasm and CRABP2, which transports retinoic acid to the nucleus where it interacts with retinoic acid receptors to affect transcription. We demonstrate that depletion of ARID1A in cell lines and organoid molecules causes a decrease in RBP1 protein levels. Retinoic acid signaling is important for differentiation in the endometrium. RBP1 is expressed in normal endometrial epithelium and tends to be lost in atypical endometrial hyperplasia and in some endometrial tumors, with levels decreasing with higher tumor grade [ 132 133 134 135 The proteomic data were analyzed across the full endometrial cancer cohort and within the four molecular subtypes to test for associations with individual proteins and clinical outcomes. While some statistically significant differences in survival based of the expression of some proteins were found, the outcomes were not large enough or consistent enough to be of immediate clinical utility, but could be useful in understanding how the expression of some proteins impact the biology of the tumors and resultant clinical outcome variability. We found high nucleolin (NCL) to be associated with poor survival in NSMP subtype patients and confirmed this using IHC assessment in a small cohort of 157 endometrial cancers. In a second larger validation cohort of 475 endometrial cancers, NCL expression was associated with worse prognosis overall but not within NSMP. NCL has been previously reported to be prognostic in endometrial cancer [ 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 [144] [145] [146] [147] [148] While other studies have included proteomic analyses that include protein modifications, such as phospho-, acetyl-, and glyco-proteomics on prospective cohorts [ 28 149 POLE We anticipate additional molecular, proteomic and biomarker studies linked to outcomes may add further stratification to endometrial cancer molecular classification. Our study thus provides both the experimental replication and justification for future functional and biomarker studies to better define and clarify diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and for the investigation of driving oncogenic processes for potential treatments.
