SUMMARY Environmental factors play an important role in the onset and development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Previous studies have shown that global DNA methylation could be a useful biomarker in COPD. We hypothesized that COPD patients from two different Croatian regions might have clinical characteristics, quality of life, and global DNA methylation, which could be used as a possible epigenetic marker. The study included 136 COPD patients with an average age of 70 years, of whom about 70% were men. Among them, 37% were active smokers, 58% ex-smokers, and 5% non-smokers. There were 69 patients in Osijek and 67 in Zadar. The control group consisted of 64 subjects who were not diagnosed with COPD or other respiratory diseases, 32 from each center. We analyzed risk factors, severity and type of symptoms, exacerbations, comorbidities, and numerous parameters of lung function, phenotypic characteristics, quality of life, and global DNA methylation. We found that COPD patients in Zadar had more pronounced emphysema (P<0.001), while COPD patients from Osijek had more severe symptoms of cough and expectoration (P<0.001 for both). Patients from Osijek had more cardiovascular comorbidities (P<0.001) and depression (P=0.01) than patients from Zadar. Analysis of global DNA methylation found that patients with COPD had lower values than the control group, but the difference was not statistically significant.

COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 As climate and lifestyle could have a different impact on COPD patients, we assumed that COPD patients from two geographically different regions, such as the cities Osijek and Zadar, might have different clinical features, disease severity, disease course, and quality of life. Global DNA methylation shows the overall degree of genome methylation. It is relatively simple, non-invasive, and easily used in clinical practice ( 13 14 Patients and methods The study was first approved by the Ethics Committees of the Clinical Hospital Center Osijek and the Zadar General Hospital, and then by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, the University of Osijek (decision No. 2158-61-07-17-130, July 3, 2017). The study was performed from October 2017 to March 2019 and in that period all data were collected. Patients Based on the calculation of the mean effect in different numerical variants between the two independent groups, 136 patients with COPD, 69 patients treated in Clinical Hospital Center Osijek and 67 patients treated in General Hospital Zadar, were included in the study. There were 70% men and 30% women. According to smoking habits, there were 37% active smokers, 58% ex-smokers, and 5% non-smokers. The mean age of patients with COPD was 70 years (interquartile range 66-74). Patients in Osijek and patients in Zadar had similar demographic characteristics (Table 1). The ageand sex-matched control group was formed for the purposes of global DNA methylation analysis. It consisted of 64 subjects, 32 from each center, without diagnosis of COPD or other lung disease or respiratory symptoms and with normal spirometric parameters. The control group consisted of an equal number of men and women and an equal number of active/ former smokers and non-smokers. The mean age of control subjects was 71 years (interquartile range 65-77). Each participant signed the informed consent form. Patients with COPD were men and women over the age of 40 years with a previous diagnosis of COPD confirmed by spirometric findings of persistent airway obstruction according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (GOLD) criteria ( 1 1 Method Collection of detailed anamnestic data on smoking and other risk factors, symptoms, exacerbations, and comorbidities, and findings of pulmonary function (PFT), chest computed tomography (CT), cardiac ultrasound, and laboratory findings of eosinophils, total IgE, and global DNA methylation from peripheral blood were done in all patients. Relevant indicators of pulmonary function were obtained by spirometry, pulmonary diffusion, and arterial blood gas analysis (Table 2). Echocardiographic findings and chest CT scans were not older than 12 months before the enrollment and contained the data needed to assess the presence of pulmonary hypertension and the presence and extent of emphysema and bronchiectasis. They were interpreted by different experts in both centers, and there was no single method for evaluating these findings, nor were quantitative data used. If patients did not perform these tests or if the findings did not contain the required data, echocardiography and chest CT were performed subsequently. Patients quality of life and symptoms were assessed by four validated questionnaires. Short form-36 questionnaire (SF-36) is the most commonly used validated generic questionnaire for a comprehensive assessment of health status in the domain of physical and emotional health ( 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 A peripheral blood sample for global DNA methylation was taken from all patients and stored at -20°C until laboratory analysis ( 22 Statistical analysis Category data were presented as absolute and relative frequencies. Differences in category variables were tested by the chi-square test and, if necessary, by Fisher’s exact test. The normality of the distribution of numerical variables were tested by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences of normally distributed numerical variables between two independent groups were tested by Student’s test, in case of deviation from normal distribution by Mann-Whitney U test, and in case of three or more independent groups by analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test (post hoc Conover). Bonferroni correction was used for all multiple analysis. The correlations of normally distributed numerical variables were assessed by Pearson’s correlation coefficient r, and in case of deviation from the normal distribution by Spearman’s correlation coefficient ρ (rho). Regression analysis (bivariate and multivariate) will examine which factors influence higher values of global DNA ( 23 24 25 https://www.medcalc.org Results COPD patients from Osijek and Zadar did not differ significantly in age, sex, body mass index, age at diagnosis, symptoms, and lung function (Table 1). About 75% of patients in both groups were retired and no significant difference was found in terms of employment status between patients from Osijek and those from Zadar (Fisher’s exact test, P=0.89). There were no differences in the exacerbation rates (chi-square test, P=0.52), hospitalization rates, or emergency visit rates during the last 12 months (chi-square test, P=0.30). No differences were found in the distribution of obstruction severity (GOLD I-IV, chi-square test, P=0.31) and symptom severity and risk of exacerbations (GOLD A-D, Fisher’s exact test, P=0.89). There was also no statistically significant difference in any of the lung function indicators (Table 2). In terms of exposure to the risk factors, no significant difference in smoking habits was found between these two groups of COPD patients. In both groups of patients, the median PY was 45 (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.85), and more than 90% of patients had more than 20 PY (Fisher’s exact test, P>0.99). The median age of starting smoking was 17 years in patients in Osijek, and 19 years in patients from Zadar (Mann-Whitney U test P=0.16). In terms of exposure to biofuels during life, a total of 68 patients (51%) used woods for heating, significantly more in Zadar (61%) than in Osijek (41%) (chi-square test, P=0.02). Chest CT scan showed that COPD patients in Zadar had more severe pulmonary emphysema than COPD patients in Osijek (chi-square test, P<0.001), while patients from Osijek had more pronounced symptoms of cough and expectoration (chi-square test, P<0.001 for both). Patients from Osijek had significantly more cardiovascular comorbidities (chi-square test, P<0.001), and depression (chi-square test, P=0.01) than patients from Zadar (Table 3). The results of the SGRQ questionnaire were worse in patients from Osijek than in patients from Zadar for the total score and the impact domain, but the differences were not statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.49 and P=0.60, respectively) (Table 3). However, the results of the SF-36 questionnaire showed that patients in Osijek had a statistically significantly worse result than patients in Zadar in the domain of physical health, for the conceptual category of physical functioning (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.04), and for the conceptual category role limitations due to emotional problems in the domain of mental health, (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.03), while in other conceptual categories and overall score, there were no statistically significant differences between patients in Osijek and Zadar (Table 4). The EM (Expectation Maximisation) cluster analysis method found that subjects in the overall sample could be classified into two basic clusters according to global DNA methylation: 1. low-methylating DNA cluster with a larger number (n=170), and 2. high-methylating DNA cluster with a smaller number of participants (n=27) (Figure 1). Even though it was observed that control subjects and non-smokers had slightly higher values of global DNA methylation, but no statistically significant difference ware found between the group of COPD patients and the control group (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.97), between smokers and non-smokers (Mann Whitney U test, P=0.41), and neither between men and women (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.73). Besides, there was no statistically significant difference in global DNA methylation between COPD patients in Osijek and COPD patients in Zadar (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.73). It was noticed that control subjects in Zadar, and especially male control subjects, had higher values of global DNA methylation compared to other subjects. A statistically significant difference in global DNA methylation was found only in the group of male subjects in Zadar between COPD patients (median 2,3, interquartile range 1.9–3.2) and control subjects (median 4.1, interquartile range 1.9–5.3) (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.03). Female control subjects in Zadar had higher values of global DNA methylation (median 3.4, interquartile range 1.8–4.2) than COPD female patients in Zadar as well (median 2.4, interquartile range 2.0–2.9), but the difference was not statistically significant (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.34). It was also found that non-smokers had statistically significantly higher values of global DNA methylation (median 3.8, interquartile range 2.3–4.9) than smokers (active and former) (median 2.4, interquartile range 1.9–3.4) (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.01) only in participants in Zadar. Global DNA methylation was statistically significantly lower in patients who had a cough symptom (median 2.3 interquartile range 1.9–2.9) compared to patients who did not have a cough symptom (median 2.6, interquartile range 2.1–3.5) (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.04). Patients who had expectoration symptom also had lower values of global DNA methylation, but statistical significance was not achieved (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.08). Global DNA methylation was statistically significantly higher in patients with COPD in Osijek, who had depression as comorbidity (median 2.8, interquartile range 2.4–3.2), compared to patients without depression (median 2.2), interquartile range 1.9–2.9) (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.04). Analysis of the distribution of low-methylating and high-methylating values of global DNA methylation, cluster 1 and cluster 2, within the examined subgroups showed that the highest share of high-methylating samples (cluster 2) was in the control group, both men and women, and in male COPD patients in Zadar (Figure 2). The groups of subjects with global low-DNA methylation ( 1 2 Discussion Demographic characteristics and COPD duration and severity did not differ significantly between the patients from Osijek and those from Zadar. Patients in Osijek and Zadar were similarly exposed to the main risk factors for COPD and did not differ significantly in smoking habits, occupational exposure, or eating habits. However, significanltly more COPD patients in Zadar used wood to heat their homes throughout their lifetimes in comparison with patients in Osijek. Biofuel combustion is associated with increased COPD prevalence in persons minimally exposed to tobacco smoke in low-and middle-income countries ( 26 27 28 29 Significant differences in the characteristics of the disease, quality of life, and comorbidities were found between COPD patients in Osijek and Zadar. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of COPD patients in Osijek was worse than of those in Zadar. COPD patients in Osijek had significantly more cardiovascular comorbidities and depression, which certainly affected their quality of life. Patients in Zadar were found to have more pronounced emphysema, while patients in Osijek had more pronounced coughing and expectoration, i.e., symptoms of chronic bronchitis. These physical characteristics of patients with COPD have been recognized for a long time and are traditionally considered the main phenotypic differences of COPD patients – the phenotype of the so-called “pink puffer” with dominant emphysema and the phenotype of the so-called “blue bloater” with dominant chronic bronchitis ( 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 33 34 41 In our study sample, there were all degrees of COPD severity, but global DNA methylation was not associated with either degrees of obstruction or severity of symptoms. In the study by He et al ( 42 43 44 45 In our study, global DNA methylaton was lower in patients than in control subjects, but a significant difference was found only between a subgroup of male COPD patients and male controls in Zadar. In many malignant diseases, and other diseases as well, in which the association between DNA methylation disorders of certain genes and disease has been confirmed, global DNA methylation does not reflect the methylation of specific CpG sites of individual genes, but may indicate disease activity or treatment effect ( 46 47 48 49 50 51 Although our study showed some differences in the characteristics of COPD between patients from Osijek and Zadar, two different environments in which they were exposed to different environmental influences, we did not find a clear association with global DNA methylation as an epigenetic factor. Given the outstanding results observed in individual patient subgroups, a much larger sample size should be included in future studies to address the questions regarding this association. Better and more accurate results are likely to be obtained by measuring DNA methylation in sputum and/or exhaled air samples ( 52 Conclusion Global DNA methylation is influenced by various factors, including host characteristics and lifestyles, all of which need to be carefully considered in the research aimed at establishing the association between global DNA methylation and health outcomes ( 53 54 55 Acknowledgment The authors thank Providence d.o.o.
