Emerging evidence suggests that integrative oncology approaches may provide survival benefits when combined with conventional treatments. This study examines whether an integrative oncology treatment plan incorporating modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT) improves survival in GBM patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from GBM patients treated at the Integrated Health Clinic (IHC) between 2010 and 2024. Survival outcomes were compared between IHC patients receiving adjuvant integrative naturopathic therapies and a matched control group from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Kaplan–Meier survival estimates, and Cox proportional hazard models were conducted to assess survival differences. Secondary analyses evaluated the impact of treatment timing (≤120 days vs >120 days post-diagnosis) and age on survival. Results: The integrative treatment cohort demonstrated a lower hazard of mortality than the SEER group (HR = .72, 95% CI: .53-1.00, P P P Conclusions: The findings suggest that an integrative naturopathic approach incorporating mEHT may improve survival outcomes in GBM patients. Patients initiating integrative treatment earlier experienced a greater survival benefit, as did patients under 50 years of age. Further studies, ideally prospective randomized controlled trials, are warranted to validate these findings. glioblastoma multiforme integrative oncology naturopathic oncology naturopathic treatment hyperthermia modulated electrohyperthermia Oncology Association of Naturopathic Physicians pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes cover-date January-December 2025 typesetter ts1 Introduction Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), or grade IV astrocytoma, is the most common, aggressive, and deadly primary brain cancer in adults.  1  2  3 4 5  4 GBM is a treatment-resistant malignancy with poor prognosis and limited survival, even with the current standard of care.  6 7 8  9 9 10 Some of the more promising complementary therapies for GBM include high-dose intravenous vitamin C, which was found to be safe and well-tolerated when combined with radiation and TMZ, potentially improving patient outcomes by enhancing the efficacy of standard treatments 11 14 15 16 17 20 mEHT applies a RF carrier-wave with amplitude modulation  21  22  23 mEHT employs amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields to selectively target tumor cells, inducing cellular stress and apoptosis while sparing healthy tissue.  24  24  25 24 26 While integrative oncology is increasingly used in cancer care, evidence on its synergistic effects, potential side effects, and optimal integration models remains limited. Only 11 studies have investigated the effects of mEHT in GBM patients, with varying study designs and sample sizes (See Supplementary Table 1 27 37 28 30 36  27 Due to the individualized and dynamic nature of integrative oncology, standardizing treatment protocols for research purposes presents a significant challenge.  10  10  38 This retrospective study evaluates an integrative oncology treatment model for GBM, assessing survival outcomes following the integration of complementary therapies, including mEHT, with conventional care. Specifically, the study seeks to determine whether integrative oncology treatment improves survival in GBM patients compared to standard care, and if the timing of treatment initiation and age modify the treatment effect. Methods Study Design This retrospective chart review study was conducted at the Integrated Health Clinic (IHC) in British Columbia (BC), Canada, focusing on patients treated between 2010 and 2024. Patients who received integrative naturopathic care in conjunction with standard of care (referred to as integrative oncology treatment) were compared with controls derived from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The SEER database is a publicly available, de-identified collection of cancer case records from the United States.  39 Ethics Statement The study received approval from the Research Ethics Board (REB) at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine (CCNMREB055.Parmar). Notices were posted at clinic locations to inform patients of the study, with an option to opt out of participation. Opting out did not affect patients’ treatment plans. Participants To be eligible for inclusion, patients in both groups needed to have an initial diagnosis of grade IV GBM at age 18 or older. For IHC patients, an additional requirement was that they had undergone at least 6 sessions of mEHT treatments between August 1, 2010, and August 31, 2024. Patients in both groups were excluded if essential data were missing, such as diagnosis date, cancer type, grade, standard care treatments, or date of death. IHC patients were followed until death, loss to follow-up, or the end of the data collection period on August 31, 2024. Since naturopathic medical care is not covered by British Columbia’s medical services plan, IHC patients had to self-finance their treatment and travel. The version of the SEER database used for this study was the SEER 17 Nov 2023 submission, which includes diagnoses between 2000 and 2021. Before matching we reduced the SEER database to patients diagnosed between 2008 and 2021 because all IHC patients were diagnosed in 2008 or later. GBM patients were identified from the SEER database as records where the SEER Brain and CNS recode variable contained “1.1.2 Glioblastoma.” In the SEER database, cases diagnosed before 2017 were graded using a different coding system than cases diagnosed after 2017. For this study, for tumors diagnosed in 2017 or earlier, we filtered the grade to “Undifferentiated; anaplastic; Grade IV” and for tumors diagnosed after 2017, we filtered the pathological grade to “4.” Additional details on the SEER database, including the coding of grade, are available in the database documentation.  39 It is assumed that SEER patients did not receive mEHT, as the treatment is not available in the U.S. Although several FDA-approved hyperthermia devices are used in the U.S. (eg, COOK VH8500 Hyperthermia Treatment System, MEDIFOCUS 100A, PYREXAR BSD 2000, LABTHERMICS Sonotherm 1000), none provide mEHT specifically. While data on the use of other hyperthermia forms is limited, these therapies are generally not widely accessible in the U.S. 40 41  42 4 5  43 Intervention IHC patients received an integrative oncology treatment model (combination of conventional treatments and complementary naturopathic therapies) tailored to individual needs. This model included mEHT, high-dose intravenous vitamin C, targeted supplementation, immune support, acupuncture, and dietary and lifestyle counselling. The IHC patients in our study received mEHT treatments utilizing the Oncotherm EHY-2000+ device, which delivers modulated, capacitive radiofrequency (13.56 MHz) heating to target tumors with up to a 15 cm depth of penetration, maintaining a temperature range of 38.5°C to 42.5°C throughout the treatment session. The EHY-2000+ device is a Health Canada Class III Medical Device, is produced in the European Union, approved according to the European Medical Device Directive (CE-MDD), and produced in Good Manufacturing Process under ISO13485 standard, certified by TUV Product Service, Munich, Germany. Patients lay on their side on the Oncotherm EHY-2000+ treatment bed. Their head rested on a memory foam pillow coated with a special metal fabric, which helped carry the treatment signal by acting as part of the electrode system. A second, movable electrode—about 20 cm wide—was placed gently over the area of the head being treated, based on the doctor’s instructions. Patients were given a call bell in case they needed anything during the session and were checked every 10 to 15 minutes to make sure they were comfortable. The IHC brain protocol used on all GBM patients follows a structured step-up protocol to ensure optimal patient tolerance and safety ( Table 1 Table 1. mEHT Treatment Progression: Applied Power, Duration, and Modulation Settings.

All IHC patients also received conventional standard-of-care treatments prescribed by their neurosurgeons, medical and radiation oncologists. All patients in the IHC group received mEHT at some stage of their conventional treatment journey—some during radiation, others after radiation, some alongside TMZ, some after completing TMZ, and some following a recurrence of the disease. For patients undergoing radiotherapy with concurrent TMZ, mEHT sessions were administered 2 to 3 times weekly, timed before or after radiation sessions. For patients on the Stupp 5/23 cycles, mEHT was provided 2 to 3 times alongside TMZ, which was taken orally 30-minutes prior to mEHT as an adjunctive chemo-sensitizing treatment ( Table 2 Table 2.

Chemotherapy schedule mEHT schedule Temozolomide (TMZD) metronomic 1-3 times weekly TMZD 5/23 protocol 2-3 times during 5 days on TMZD Day 1 of 14-day cycle Day 1 and 3 of 14-day cycle Day 1 and 8 of 21-day cycle Day 1, 3, 8, 10 of 21-day cycle Day 1-3 of 21-day cycle Day 1, 3, 5 of 21-day cycle Data Collection Data from IHC patient charts were meticulously reviewed, including laboratory, imaging, and pathology reports, and treatment notes from medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists. Dates of death were verified through family confirmation, obituary searches, and Medical Services Plan (BC public health insurance) records. Variables of interest included date of death, age at diagnosis, sex, diagnosis year, grade at diagnosis, and receipt of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. A research assistant initially extracted the data, then the data were verified for accuracy by the study’s principal investigator. Equivalent data for SEER patients were extracted from the database. Survival time was provided in units of months in the SEER database, calculated as the floor of the death date minus the date of diagnosis, divided by the average number of days in a month (365.24/12). The same calculation was applied to survival time for patients in the IHC group to convert from days to months. Statistical Analysis From the patients in the SEER database that met the eligibility criteria, matched controls were selected using optimal propensity score matching with a ratio of 6 controls to 1 IHC patient. Age, sex, year of diagnosis, and treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy were included in the propensity score model and an exact match was required on sex. Propensity score matching controls for confounding at baseline (pre-treatment) by generating a sample of controls with similar distributions of the covariates as the treated group. The quality of the matching is evaluated by the standardized mean difference (SMD) between the 2 groups, and an SMD of less than 0.1 is generally accepted to indicate negligible differences between the matched groups.  44 There was often a delay between diagnosis and the start of IHC treatment, representing a period of “immortal time” included in the survival time when measured from diagnosis for IHC patients that is not present for SEER patients. Survival time measured from diagnosis, therefore, suffers from immortal time bias. To address this, we use the prescription time-matching approach  45 The sample was characterized using frequency for categorical variables, mean and standard deviation (SD) for symmetric continuous variables, and median and interquartile range (IQR) for skewed continuous variables. Survival time was visualized using a Kaplan–Meier (KM) plot, illustrating the survival probability over time per group. Descriptive statistics for the outcome included restricted mean and median survival times, calculated by group. The hazard ratio (HR) comparing the IHC group to the SEER group was estimated with a Cox proportional-hazards (Cox PH) model. Age, sex, year of diagnosis, and treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy were included in the Cox PH model to adjust for any remaining between-group discrepancies in these variables. In secondary analyses, we explored the effects of age and the timing of clinic treatment using stratification. The age strata were defined as <50 and ≥50 years of age and the treatment timing strata were defined as the initiation of clinic treatment before or after 120 days from diagnosis. SEER controls were assigned to the same strata as their matched IHC patient. The 120-day cutoff was selected to define an early treatment group based on the typical treatment timeline for GBM patients. After diagnosis, patients generally undergo standard-of-care treatment—including craniotomy surgery, radiation with TMZ—which typically spans 90 to 120 days from craniotomy to the completion of 6 weeks of radiation with TMZ. It is typically following this period that patients explore complementary naturopathic treatment options. Hazard ratios were calculated by estimating stratified Cox PH models. Analyses were performed with R Statistical Software (v4.1.2; R Core Team).  46 P Results There were 73 patients diagnosed with grade IV GBM who received at least 6 sessions of mEHT at the IHC between August 1, 2010 and August 31, 2024. Three patients were excluded because they were under age 18 at the time of diagnosis and 3 patients were excluded because they were missing information on standard of care treatments (surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy). The remaining 67 patients formed the IHC group. In the SEER database, there were 60 615 diagnoses of GBM. After restricting to diagnoses between 2008 and 2021, there were 41 948 records remaining. We then excluded diagnoses that were not grade IV (n = 24 920) and records from patients diagnosed before age 18 (n = 175), missing survival time (n = 112), or missing standard of care treatment (n = 9). A further 4 cases were removed during deduplication (ie, the process of removing later records from patients with multiple eligible diagnoses). The remaining 16 278 unique patients formed the pool of eligible controls for matching and 402 controls were matched. Of the matched controls, 159 died during the length of time between diagnosis and the start of clinic treatment of their matched IHC patient and were removed. The final sample included 243 matched controls. The IHC group had a median age of 52 years and more males (59.7%) than females (40.3%). The diagnoses were spread evenly over the 14-year study time period, with a median year of diagnosis of 2017 ( Table 3 Table 3. Sample Characteristics of SEER and IHC Groups After Matching.

Discussion This retrospective study evaluated the survival outcomes of GBM patients who received integrative oncology treatment including mEHT at the IHC compared to matched controls from the SEER database. Our findings suggest that the integration of mEHT and complementary naturopathic therapies with the standard of care may offer a survival benefit for GBM patients, particularly when treatment is initiated within 120 days of diagnosis. When survival was measured from the initiation of clinic treatment, IHC patients exhibited a median overall survival of 15 months, compared to 11 months in the control group, with an HR of .72, reflecting a 28% reduction in the risk of death. While promising, these results did not achieve statistical significance. Previous studies have suggested that integrative oncology may enhance treatment efficacy in glioblastoma. 11 16 27 37  36  30 mEHT utilizes amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields to selectively target tumor cells, inducing cellular stress and apoptosis while preserving healthy tissue.  24  25 A well-established and already FDA-approved non-invasive therapy for GBM, tumor treating fields (TTF),  47 18 48  24 49 50 48 51  18 Notably, patients who began integrative treatments within 120 days of diagnosis experienced a statistically significant 48% reduction in the hazard of death (HR = .52) compared to controls. In contrast, those who initiated treatment after 120 days did not show a meaningful survival benefit (HR = .98). These results align with recent advancements in GBM treatment, where novel therapies such as mEHT have shown promise in improving survival 18 19 30 32  37 Early intervention is essential for the effectiveness of all treatment modalities for GBM. Early intervention, including diagnosis and surgery within specific timeframes, significantly improves survival outcomes, with patients diagnosed within 2 weeks of symptom onset and who underwent surgery within 3 weeks living longer than those who received treatment at later stages.  52  18  18 Further stratification of our patient cohort by age revealed that patients diagnosed before age 50 experienced a significantly greater survival benefit from integrative oncology treatment compared to those aged 50 or older. This finding suggests that younger GBM patients may be more responsive to complementary and integrative therapies, potentially due to differences in tumor biology, immune response, or treatment tolerability. Prior studies have similarly noted that age is a key prognostic factor in GBM, with younger patients exhibiting better overall survival and a more favorable response to novel therapeutic approaches. 53 55 33 36  30 Beyond survival benefits, multiple studies have emphasized the safety and tolerability of mEHT. 28 33 36 Our results underscore the value of integrative oncology as a holistic approach to cancer care that extends beyond conventional treatments. Integrative oncology aims to combine conventional treatments with evidence-based complementary therapies to improve patient outcomes and quality of life. In our study, the integrative approach included a minimum of 6 sessions of mEHT within a comprehensive naturopathic oncology treatment approach. While our findings suggest a potential survival benefit associated with the early initiation of integrative therapies, the retrospective nature of our study and its limitations prevent us from drawing definitive conclusions about causality. One key consideration in integrative oncology is the disparity in access to such treatments. Studies have shown that uninsured GBM patients or those with lower socioeconomic status often have reduced survival rates and are less likely to receive standard treatments, 56 58  59 Limitations Our study is subject to several limitations, including its retrospective design, potential selection biases, and the inherent challenges of standardizing integrative oncology protocols. Patients pursuing integrative treatments often need to finance their care and travel to specialized clinics, and comparable socioeconomic data were not available for both groups in our study. Some patients used mEHT throughout their disease course receiving more treatments, while others used it for a specific time during treatment, and not throughout their care. These differences in dosing and timing may have also had an impact on individual disease progression and thus survival outcomes. Furthermore, while integrative therapies such as mEHT are not widely available in certain regions, it is possible that some control patients received other complementary treatments, which could lead to conservative estimates of the true effect of integrative approaches. In addition, although survival differences were observed, a causal relationship cannot be established without a randomized controlled trial. The retrospective design limits our ability to fully control for confounding factors, and residual bias cannot be excluded despite the matched design and multivariate survival analysis. Although we attempted to balance the IHC and SEER cohorts, only a limited number of matching variables were available (age, sex, year of diagnosis, and receipt of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy). Other clinically meaningful factors—such as tumor molecular profile, extent of surgical resection, performance status, comorbidities, or socioeconomic determinants of health—were not available. Thus, residual confounding cannot be excluded, and our analyses should be interpreted as exploratory and hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. Importantly, quality-of-life outcomes—central to evaluating the value of integrative approaches—were not systematically collected in this study and could not be assessed. Future Direction Despite all the limitations, the observed association between early initiation of integrative therapies and improved survival outcomes warrants further investigation. Our study serves as a preliminary step toward understanding the role of integrative oncology in GBM treatment. Given the individualized nature of integrative therapies, designing structured randomized controlled trials poses challenges. Future research should focus on prospective studies that not only evaluate survival outcomes but also assess patient-centered metrics such as quality of life and functional status over time. This comprehensive approach will provide a more holistic understanding of the potential benefits and limitations of integrative oncology in GBM care. Conclusions Our findings suggest that incorporating integrative naturopathic therapies with standard care may offer survival benefits for GBM patients, particularly when initiated early in the treatment course. These results contribute to the growing body of literature exploring holistic approaches to cancer care and underscore the potential of integrative oncology in improving outcomes for patients with aggressive malignancies like GBM.
