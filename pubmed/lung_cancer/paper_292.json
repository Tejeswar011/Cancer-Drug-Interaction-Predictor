Assessing health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) in multimorbid patients is essential for understanding the overall impact of the patient’s health conditions on wellbeing and the complexities of patient management. This study assessed the HRQoL of multimorbid patients in India using the EQ-5D-5L value set. This observational study included 906 patients from tertiary healthcare facilities in Odisha, India, and used consecutive time-based sampling methods, conducted from January to April 2023. The study examined the relationship between HRQoL measures and utility scores using ordinary least squares regression and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that mean utility scores decreased as the number of health conditions increased, with scores of 0.677 for one condition, 0.577 for two conditions, 0.354 for three conditions, and 0.098 for four or more conditions. Combining stroke/paralysis with other health issues resulted in negative utility ratings.

Given India’s rising burden of chronic diseases and the growing prevalence of multimorbidity, understanding its impact on HRQoL is particularly relevant to inform targeted healthcare strategies and improve patient outcomes in the Indian context ( 3 4 15 16 16 Methods Study design, participants, and setting An observational study was conducted among patients aged ≥18 years who visited the medicine outpatient department (OPD) at two tertiary healthcare and teaching hospitals in the state of Odisha, India. We have included patients aged 18 years and above attending the medicine OPD; first-time attendees on the designated sampling days, and patients providing informed consent to participate in the study. We have excluded the patients unable to participate due to insufficient cognition or debilitating conditions, inpatients, repeat visitors previously interviewed in the current study, and patients unwilling to participate or who refused consent. The participating facilities were the Kalinga Institute of Medical Science, Bhubaneswar (private), and SCB Medical College in Cuttack (public), representing both private and public healthcare sectors. Sample size and sampling frame The complex multimorbidity prevalence in India was 34.5% ( 17 N Z α d n n d 2 Z 2 1- α N We used consecutive time-based sampling methods. Through discussions with healthcare professionals at each institution, it was determined that approximately 70–100 adult patients visited the medicine OPD daily. Among them, a minimum of 25 were first-time attendees. Consequently, the decision was made to include all first-time visitors on every alternate working day, totalling around 12 days per month. This approach aimed to enrol at least 10 patients per day over 4 months, to reach a sample size of 480 patients at each facility. We were able to collect 403 responses from private and 503 from public health facilities. Data collection took place from January to April 2023. Study variables and data collection procedure We used a pre-validated structured Multimorbidity Assessment Questionnaire for Primary Care (MAQ-PC) to collect data. This instrument has a high internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha: 0.69), interrater reliability (Cohen’s Kappa: 0.78–1), and test–retest reliability (ICC: 0.970–0.741) ( 18 To enhance data validity, these self-reported conditions were cross-validated using prescription records obtained from patient pharmacy data. A subset of the data was used to construct a misclassification matrix comparing self-reported diagnoses with prescription-based diagnoses. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values indicated high concordance (substantial agreement, kappa = 0.78). Conditions were selected based on their clinical relevance, prevalence in the population, and data availability. Conditions with very low prevalence or unreliable self-reporting were excluded to improve data quality and analytical robustness. The EQ-5D-5L, a commonly employed health-related quality-of-life tool, entails a thorough evaluation of an individual’s health status across five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression ( 16 19 20 Consenting participants were interviewed following consultation with the relevant physician in the medicine department, ensuring minimal disruption to the hospital’s system. Exit interviews facilitated a comprehensive recording of diagnoses by reviewing prescriptions. To prevent duplication, each of the patients received a unique identification number, and those previously interviewed in the current study were excluded later. Exclusions from the study comprised patients unable to participate, those with insufficient cognition, and individuals with debilitating conditions who were unwilling to take part. Four public health professionals with previous experience in multimorbidity data collection conducted the interviews. They were proficient in the local language and skilled in quantitative interviews. The study received ethical approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee of ICMR-Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar (ICMR-RMRCBB/IHEC-2021/93 Date 30/12/2021). Written informed consent was acquired from all participants, with measures in place to guarantee patient confidentiality and anonymity. When patients could not provide necessary information, caregivers were approached for relevant details. Additionally, the hospital and outpatient department’s approval was secured before initiating the data collection process. Statistical analysis The demographic attributes of the patients were depicted through descriptive statistics, specifically frequency and percentage. Recognizing the importance of age as a predictive factor for multimorbidity, as well as its impact on associated health outcomes and HRQoL, we chose to conduct all analyses with age stratification—categorizing individuals into three groups: 18–39 years, 40–59 years, and 60 years and above. Individuals aged 60 and above are officially classified as older people or senior citizens, according to the 1999 National Policy for Older People ( 20 Data gathered by the EQ-5D-5L from participants undergo conversion into a health utility index, offering a quantitative assessment of the overall health state. The EQ-5D-5L score, derived from the five questions, spans a theoretical range from −0.923 (indicating a state worse than death) to 1 (representing the best possible health state). The utility values for all 3,125 conceivable health states were sourced from Jyani et al. ( 16 In order to explore factors associated with HRQoL, the univariate association between independent variables and HRQoL measures (utility score) was examined using ordinary least squares regression. Additionally, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was then conducted to determine the relationship between demographic variables, clinical outcomes (multimorbidity conditions) and lifestyle variables (physical activity – exercise) with utility score. In step 1, a linear regression model was constructed to evaluate the relationship between utility score (dependent variables) and demographic variables such as age, sex, residence, education, ethnicity, marital status and occupations. This approach allowed for the assessment of the independent effect of each demographic factor on utility scores while controlling for others. In step 2, the analysis was extended to include clinical outcomes (multimorbidity conditions) and lifestyle variables (physical activity – exercise) were added to the model. A multivariable linear regression model was used to examine the combined influence of these factors on utility scores, with all relevant variables entered simultaneously. The significance level was set at p Results The study included 906 participants, with 276 in the 18–39 age group, 398 in the 40–59 age group, and 232 in the 60 and above age group. In the participant group, 49% were female, 50% were male, and approximately 1% identified as third-gender. Approximately 59% reside in rural areas, 40% belong to the general caste, and 51% have completed high school/senior secondary education. Approximately 39% lacked health insurance coverage, and the mean monthly healthcare expenditure was 2,581 INR (Indian Rupees). Table 1 Table 1 Characteristic of study participants by age group.

Participants with multiple conditions tended to have lower average utility scores, while those with only one condition reported higher scores. The variability was substantial, with standard deviations ranging from about 0.42–0.65, and scores spanning from negative values (worse than death) up to perfect health ( Table 6 Table 6 Overall summary of utility scores and minimal important differences (MID).

It identified prevalent health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, revealing a significant decline in mean utility scores as the number of conditions increased. Specifically, utility scores declined from 0.677 for one condition to 0.098 for four or more conditions, with older adults particularly affected. Negative utility scores were associated with severe conditions like schizophrenia and stroke. The study found that younger age, urban living, higher education, marital status, regular physical activity, and fewer health conditions correlated with higher utility scores. The minimum important difference for perceived meaningful change in utility scores ranged from 0.21 to 0.32 points, indicating that more significant changes are necessary for those with multiple conditions. Understanding the patterns of common health conditions is critical for healthcare professionals and policymakers in developing targeted interventions. Recognizing the specific conditions that are common in a population allows healthcare professionals to tailor their approaches to early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. This knowledge enables the development of specialised care plans and interventions that address the distinct challenges presented by each common health condition. As a result, the HRQoL measurement is critical for understanding how chronic conditions, multimorbidity, and polypharmacy affect patients’ health. Studies such as Bhadhuri et al. ( 21 22 21–23 6 24 To improve responsiveness to the individual needs and experiences of patients with multiple health conditions, healthcare systems must take a holistic, patient-centred approach. Integrated care models, which encourage collaboration among various healthcare professionals, are critical for addressing the interconnected complexities of multimorbidity. Community collaboration addresses social determinants of health, and continuous monitoring and feedback systems enable timely adjustments to care plans. Previous research has highlighted the high healthcare costs associated with multimorbidity and its impact on HRQoL, particularly after hospitalisation ( 25–27 28–31 Individuals with multimorbidity are more likely to use health-care services, require complex medications, and have polypharmacy than those without. As a result, recognising and addressing multimorbidity is critical in shaping the design of effective healthcare systems. Previous studies relied on value sets from Thailand and the United Kingdom because there was no India-specific EQ-5D-5L value set available. As a result, developing an India-specific EQ-5D-5L value set became critical to ensuring more transparent and consistent decision-making ( 16 32 33 This study examines the impact of identified health conditions on quality of life, particularly those with low utility scores, as well as the difficulties and implications of managing multiple conditions. The study expands on age disparities, focusing on lower mean utility scores in the older age group with multiple conditions, and investigates potential causes and implications for tailored healthcare strategies ( 31 The results emphasise that conditions such as stroke/paralysis and schizophrenia/unipolar/bipolar disorder are associated with significantly negative utility scores, which suggests a significant decrease in quality of life. In contrast, diseases such as acid peptic disease and diabetes, despite their prevalence, have relatively higher mean utility scores, which implies a less significant impact on HRQoL ( 5 The results have substantial implications for the geriatric populations of India and other LMICs. As the prevalence of multimorbidity increases, older individuals experience significant declines in HRQoL, with the mean utility decreasing by nearly four times (from 0.677 to 0.098). The low scores were linked to severe conditions, including schizophrenia and stroke, underscoring the necessity of targeted integrative interventions in the older adults population to enhance their quality of life. Moreover, the estimation of QALYs at the population level will be facilitated by quantified disease-specific HRQoL, which will be useful for cost-effectiveness research and the allocation of resources for any rehabilitation programs, assistive devices, and home-based care among the geriatric population in India. Additionally, early screening and care for anxiety and depression among older populations may enhance QALYs and their opportunities for social engagement. Implications for policy and practices Promoting lifestyle modifications, recognizing multimorbidity’s social and psychological implications, and investing in community-based support programs, mental health services, and medication subsidies can improve access and affordability for patients. Nurses should promote lifestyle modifications such as regular physical activity and health education among patients, particularly in younger populations. Enhancing access to preventive and early diagnostic services, especially in rural and underserved areas. In order to address the holistic needs of patients, nurses should support community-based programs and mental health services. This study recommends clinicians for prioritizing integrated care models for managing multiple conditions through comprehensive care approaches. Incorporate utility score assessments into clinical evaluations to enhance comprehension of patient requirements. Recognizing the psychological effects of multimorbidity, including stress, anxiety, and depression, and integrating psychosocial support into care. Policymakers should improve access to preventive services, invest in community-based support programs, and subsidize essential medications. Addressing social determinants of health and supporting research on sociodemographic factors can improve healthcare access and quality of life. Limitations of the study The study faces limitations regarding its sampling method and sample size, which may affect the generalizability of its findings on India’s multimorbid patient population. Although efforts were made to include participants from both private and public healthcare sectors, the recruitment from two tertiary hospitals in a single state may not represent the diversity of multimorbid patients across the country. The sample size, calculated based on relevant parameters, was smaller than intended, particularly in the private sector, hindering comparisons of HRQoL between public and private facilities. Moreover, given the observational study design and the sampling strategy employed, several potential biases may influence the study findings. Selection bias could arise due to the inclusion of only patients attending the medicine outpatient departments on designated days, potentially excluding individuals with different health-seeking behaviors or those unable to visit the hospital, particularly the severely ill, disabled, or those from remote areas, which may limit the generalizability of the results. The patients with cognitive impairments or debilitating conditions were excluded, which could underestimate the prevalence or impact of multimorbidity in the broader patient population. Additionally, the sample was insufficient to analyze disease combinations by burden and their impact on quality of life, potentially introducing bias and affecting precision. Exclusion criteria, such as cognitive ability and refusal to participate, may have omitted valuable insights. Although the findings have demonstrated that an increase in the number of diseases results in a decrease in the health utility score, however, the relationship between specific diseases and their severity of impact on HRQoL is not thoroughly examined. These limitations highlight the need for further research with larger, more diverse samples to enhance the robustness and applicability of the findings. The study reports disease-specific utility scores and explores combinations of conditions, but it does not conduct an in-depth analysis of the individual impact of each disease on HRQoL within the regression models. These limits understanding of how specific conditions, such as depression or diabetes, independently influence quality of life, which could be addressed in future analyses for more nuanced insights. Conclusion The findings reveal that multimorbidity significantly reduces HRQoL, particularly in older adults with multiple health conditions. Moreover, conditions like stroke, parkinsonism, and dementia notably worsen utility scores, especially when combined. The findings stress the necessity for comprehensive healthcare strategies aimed at improving wellbeing in complex medical scenarios. Furthermore, context-specific minimal important difference thresholds are crucial for interpreting utility scores; smaller changes are significant for those with fewer conditions, while larger shifts are needed for those with multiple ailments. This understanding is vital for clinicians and researchers in assessing interventions and monitoring disease progression effectively.
