Background: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a widely applied analytical tool to study small organic molecules to larger biopolymers like proteins, RNA, and DNA. One of the major applications of NMR spectroscopy in the past two decades has been in the field of metabolomics. Metabolomics is the study of small molecules of <2000 Da, known as metabolites, within cells, biofluids, or tissues. This technique can describe the underlying biochemical activity and state of cells to represent the molecular phenotype [ 1 2 3 2. Metabolism in Brain Cancer The brain relies heavily on glucose as its main substrate for energy metabolism. Unlike other organs, which can utilize lipids, amino acids, or other sugars as a source of energy or operate under hypoxic conditions briefly, the brain is exclusively dependent on blood glucose and is responsible for a quarter of total glucose consumption in the body. The brain requires high energy consumption to fuel metabolic processes, including the operation of ion pumps, the synthesis of proteins, and the stabilization of the membrane [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 Cancer cells alter metabolism as a determinant of cell proliferation. To rapidly grow and divide, cancer cells must produce cellular energy to replicate their cellular contents. Rather than depend on the TCA cycle to produce ATP, in most cancer types, cancer cells preferentially rely on the conversion of glucose to lactate, irrespective of oxygen availability, defined as the Warburg effect. This is due to the inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 and an increase in lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH) activity [ 10 11 12 13 2.1. Gliomas The World Health Organization (WHO) revised its brain tumor classification to use a layered diagnosis concept, which combined histology and molecular pathology twice in the last decade (2016 and 2021) [ 14 15 16 16 2.1.1. Glioblastoma Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a grade IV astrocytoma and the most common malignant brain tumor in adults, representing almost half of all malignant primary brain tumors (46.1%) [ 17 18 Due to the rapid proliferation and hypoxic environment created by these cancer cells, it is not surprising that there is a metabolic shift observed in glioblastoma. An in vitro study of nine glioblastoma cell lines found that metabolic data can be used to distinguish between glioblastoma cell types [ 19 19 The group 2 cell lines, HS683 and LN405, saw a reduced concentration of glutamine, which is consistent with the overexpression of the OGDH gene. Valine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine, lactic acid, glutamate, citric acid, aspartate, asparagine, and methionine are the most significantly upregulated metabolites in group 2 cell lines compared to the other group 1, 3, and 4 cell lines. Upregulation of glutamate and aspartate was observed in the group 3 cell lines, A172, U343, and LN18. GABA, proline, glutamine, glutamate, methionine, citric acid, aspartate, and asparagine were found to be the most upregulated metabolites in comparison to the other groups. Glutamine and glutamate were found to be downregulated in the group 4 cell lines, U373 and BS149, whereas upregulation was observed in glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P). The most significantly upregulated metabolites in comparison to the other groups included succinic acid, serine, adenine, taurine, lysine, tyrosine, G3P, glucose, cis-aconitic acid, GABA, and proline [ 19 A different NMR study employed human urine and blood samples from 70 glioma patients and 70 healthy individuals. They found 20 metabolites to have differential levels, including citrate, pyruvate, glucose, formate, and creatine, which can be used to distinguish plasma samples from healthy individuals and those with tumors. Increased levels of phospholipids and total cholesterol were observed in the plasma profiles of brain tumor patients in comparison to healthy individuals [ 20 In another study focused on platelet metabolism in brain cancer patients—including those with GBM, astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, gliosarcoma, and meningioma—altered metabolic profiles were observed compared to platelets from healthy volunteers. In general, the concentrations of metabolites such as lactate, acetate, glutamine, glutamate, succinate, alanine, and pyruvate were decreased in patient samples. This represents one of the first pilot studies to explore platelet-based metabolism to distinguish brain cancer patients from healthy individuals using NMR spectroscopy. However, the study was conducted on a small sample size, necessitating further validation with larger cohorts. Nonetheless, the findings are intriguing and warrant continued investigation [ 21 Gliosarcoma is a rare form of glioblastoma that occurs in the glial cells of the brain surface or spinal cord and is characterized by its distinctive mesenchymal and glial differentiation [ 22 23 NMR can also be utilized to distinguish responsiveness to therapy, as seen in a 2019 NMR study on GBM cultures established from biopsies of 5 patients. In untreated cell lines, citric acid was undetectable; however, when treated with the drug YM155, cells less sensitive to this drug experienced a significant increase in citric acid. The less sensitive cells also saw a decrease in alanine and lactate after treatment [ 24 A study published in 2021 also explored different metabolic shifts throughout numerous tumor stages in glioblastoma, including during development, regression, and relapse in a mouse model. Throughout tumor development, alanine and PC were the first metabolites to significantly increase in the GBM models compared to controls, followed by glycerolphosphocholine, glycine, and valine later in development. Following radiotherapy, alanine, glycine, and valine were significantly decreased when compared to the untreated tumors. As treatment continued, NAD+ and PC also became significantly decreased in the treated tumors [ 25 Figure 1 2.1.2. Astrocytoma Astrocytomas are defined by a mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene. This mutation causes the production of 2-HG, which ultimately causes astrocytoma [ 26 27 Figure 2 28 29 An IDH1 mutation is caused by a point mutation, which distinguishes glioblastoma from astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma. This IDH1 mutation produces 2-hydroxyglutarate from a-ketoglutaric acid. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Neuroscience used human brain tumor samples and demonstrated that elevated 2-HG could be used as a biomarker of the IDH1/2 mutation status in gliomas, which would distinguish glioblastomas from astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas [ 30 Figure 2 31 30 Figure 2 IDH1/2 Point Mutation Produces 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), bypassing the TCA Cycle. TCA cycle metabolites are highlighted in rectangular light blue, TCA cycle byproduct 2HG in pink boxes, co-factors are shown in red font, enzymes in pink oval boxes, and mutated enzyme in purple oval boxes. The IDH1 point mutation is highlighted in a pink circular box. Early NMR studies on astrocytomas found that the absolute choline concentration in astrocytomas in vivo did not differ from normal white matter. However, in a 2010 study of pediatric brain tumors, it was observed that pilocytic astrocytoma had higher concentrations of fatty acids, representing a possible alteration in lipid metabolism in this pathology. Pilocytic astrocytoma is a glial, low-grade tumor with a good prognosis that begins in the astrocyte cells of the central nervous system [ 32 33 Pilocytic astrocytomas tend to be less aggressive tumors, which was further supported by the low levels of all choline-containing compounds, including PC and GPC [ 34 34 34 2.1.3. Oligodendroglioma Oligodendrogliomas are defined by two genetic alterations, like astrocytomas, they have an IDH mutation, and then are further defined by a 1p19q codeletion on the tumor cells’ chromosomes [ 35 In a 2008 human tumor study, a metabolic distinction between high-grade and low-grade oligodendrogliomas was established using high-resolution magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR on a 500 MHz spectrometer. At this time, low-grade and high-grade oligodendrogliomas were purely defined by histological features. The greatest metabolic distinction between high and low-grade tumors was observed in the metabolites related to amino acid metabolism. In high-grade oligodendrogliomas, an increase in alanine and valine production was observed, whereas metabolites involved in the Krebs cycle were seen to be decreased, including glutamate, glutamine, GABA, and NAA. A decrease in proline was also observed. This reflects the metabolic shift towards fermentative metabolism, supporting a greater hypoxic tumor environment in the high-grade oligodendrogliomas [ 36 2.1.4. Ependymoma Ependymomas are one of the most common solid brain tumors found in children [ 34 37 In a 2010 study, ependymomas were characterized by NMR as having upregulated myo-inositol signals [ 34 34 A study in 2018 was able to validate these earlier results [ 34 38 38 2.2. Medulloblastoma As a grade IV tumor, medulloblastomas are one of the most frequent and aggressive metastatic pediatric tumors that affect the central nervous system [ 34 39 Recent studies involving the utilization of NMR metabolomics on medulloblastoma have produced consistent results regarding significant metabolites that are upregulated, such as taurine, myo-inositol, free choline, PC, and GPC. However, as solution state NMR spectroscopy requires large amounts of tissue (~50 mg) and the extraction methods are laborious. HR-MAS is believed to be an advantageous alternative as it requires less sample and has a shorter acquisition time. In an early study, HR-MAS was performed on human tumors of varying grades for the comparison of various pediatric brain cancer metabolic profiles. Results revealed that the five medulloblastomas studied averaged higher levels of taurine, myo-inositol, PC, and GPC when compared to tumors of other grades in a cohort of 30 [ 40 40 34 In a similar study, HR-MAS was performed on 18 ependymoma, 36 medulloblastoma, and 24 pilocytic astrocytoma tissue samples, and different statistical tests were used to classify them based on their metabolic profiles. HR-MAS data showed that medulloblastomas exhibited significantly higher concentrations of ascorbate, aspartate, PC, taurine, and lipids, as well as lower glucose and scyllo-inositol in comparison to the other tumor types. The researchers in this study then used a Linear Discrete Analysis model to discriminate between the three tumor types and documented the differences in different discriminant functions. They noted that the metabolites that had the potential to separate medulloblastoma included PC, glycine, taurine, and isoleucine, and they could correctly classify medulloblastoma with 94.4% accuracy [ 38 In work performed on overexpressed smoothened (SMO) receptor transgenic mice with high incidence levels of medulloblastoma, HR-MAS was utilized to verify data obtained from 1 1 2 2 Figure 3 41 As previously stated, group III and IV mice are characterized by a worse prognosis than other tumor grades. Knowledge surrounding the exact mechanistic pathway is not completely understood, but it has been documented that the MYC gene, a family of proto-oncogenes involved in many cellular processes, is amplified in these cancers. It has been suggested that bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) bromodomain inhibitors may be promising for treating MYC-driven medulloblastomas [ 42 42 2.3. Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a product of the choroid plexus, serves many functions and is involved in many biological processes in the brain, such as maintaining interstitial homeostasis, providing protection/acting as a shock absorber, and providing nutrients to the CNS [ 43 44 45 46 1 46 2.4. Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis NMR metabolomics of the CSF has also been used as a diagnostic tool for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC). Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis is the involvement of both solid tumors and hematological cancers in the leptomeninges, the membranes that line the brain and spinal cord. LC is the third most common complication of the central nervous system, with a survival of 1 to 1.5 months in untreated patients and 3 to 6 months with treatment [ 44 44 Figure 4 47 2.5. Pituitary Tumors Pituitary tumors, particularly pituitary adenomas, are a diverse group of intracranial neoplasms that often significantly disrupt the endocrine system by altering the secretion of key regulatory hormones such as growth hormone (GH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and prolactin [ 48 49 50 To address these diagnostic deficiencies, NMR metabolomics can serve as a complementary approach. As discussed earlier in the review, NMR spectroscopy allows for quantitative profiling of metabolites, capturing downstream biochemical changes that reflect altered gene expression, enzymatic activity, and shifts in tumor metabolism—all critical indicators of cancer initiation and progression [ 51 52 1 1 53 2.6. Meningiomas Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors, making up about 30% of all primary CNS tumors. These tumors originate from the arachnoid cap cells of the meninges. Although the majority are classified as WHO grade I and considered histologically benign, their proximity to critical neurovascular structures can result in significant clinical symptoms such as headaches, visual disturbances, and seizures due to mass effect. However, many meningiomas grow slowly, thereby remaining clinically silent or exhibiting non-specific, intermittent symptoms, which complicates early detection and management [ 54 55 56 In recent years, NMR-based metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing the molecular phenotype of tumors through the analysis of biofluids or tissue extracts. This approach is particularly valuable for meningiomas, given the need for non-invasive diagnostic tools and biomarkers predictive of recurrence or malignancy. In a study, a serum metabolomics profiling approach coupled with machine learning algorithms was employed to distinguish meningioma patients from healthy individuals and to stratify tumors by WHO grade [ 57 The integration of NMR spectroscopy with machine learning classification models enabled high diagnostic accuracy, demonstrating the feasibility of using serum metabolite profiles as non-invasive biomarkers. These findings highlight the potential of metabolomics to support clinical decision-making by offering a metabolic fingerprint of meningiomas, facilitating early detection, grading, and personalized treatment strategies. 2.7. Peripheral and Central Nerve Tumors Peripheral and central nerve tumors encompass a diverse group of neoplasms, ranging from benign schwannomas and neurofibromas to highly aggressive forms such as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) and gliomas. These tumors often present diagnostic challenges due to anatomical complexity, non-specific symptoms, and a lack of reliable biomarkers to distinguish malignant from benign phenotypes, especially at early stages [ 58 59 A pivotal study utilized 1 60 2.8. Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor (DNET) Dysembryoplastic Neuroepithelial Tumor (DNET) is a benign glioma that has a known link to epilepsy. DNET occurs in the glial and neuronal cells of the cerebellum. DNET has an overall good prognosis, and treatment typically involves surgical resection. NMR spectroscopy has the potential to classify epilepsy-associated neuroepithelial tumors, such as DNET and ganglioglioma, allowing for therapies to be targeted to these diseases when treating epilepsy [ 61 62 A clinical study employing HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy compared metabolic data of hippocampi from 5 patients with DNET, 7 patients with gangliogliomas, 20 patients with type 1 hippocampal sclerosis (HS), 6 patients with type 2 hippocampal sclerosis, and 10 patients without hippocampal tumors or any signs of sclerosis. The study found that DNET hippocampi showed higher levels of lactate, alanine, ascorbate, and arginine as well as lower levels of glutathione, acetate, and glutamine when compared with hippocampi without tumors or sclerosis. Additionally, DNET and ganglioglioma showed statistically significant differences in the metabolism of choline. HR-MAS used in this study could potentially allow us to better distinguish varying metabolic pathways between DNET, ganglioglioma, and patients without tumors to improve our understanding of their relationship to epilepsy [ 62 2.9. Other Embryonal Tumors (Not Medulloblastoma) Embryonal tumors are a type of tumor that occurs in the embryonal cells of the brain, which are cells that remain from fetal development [ 63 2.9.1. Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor (ATRT) of the central nervous system (CNS) is an embryonal tumor with a dismal prognosis due to its aggressive nature. ATRT is one of the most predominant CNS tumors in young children. Treatment of ATRT typically involves conventional chemotherapy, high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous stem cell rescue (ASR), and intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy [ 64 Although little NMR metabolomics research has been performed on ATRTs, an HR-MAS study was performed on five frozen ATRT human tumor samples in comparison to other tumor types. This study uncovered that in comparison to medulloblastoma, ATRTs had significantly lower creatine. However, given the small sample size used in this study, more work needs to be performed to provide a detailed metabolic profile of ATRT [ 38 2.9.2. Embryonal Tumor with Multilayered Rosettes (ETMR) Embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) is an embryonal tumor of the brain or spinal canal with alteration of the Chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC). ETMR is often characterized by large areas of unmyelinated axons, dendrites, and glial cells with rosettes made of neuroepithelial cells [ 65 66 3. Future Directions NMR metabolomics has emerged as a powerful, non-invasive tool for unraveling the complex metabolic alterations associated with a multitude of brain cancers. Its ability to detect and quantify a wide range of metabolites in tissues, biofluids, and serums, in both human, mouse, and cell line models, offers critical insight into tumor biology, progression, and treatment response. NMR’s application in brain cancer research, such as the studies described in this review, has already yielded valuable biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring ( Table 1 67 The application of NMR spectroscopy to obtain rich structural information of molecules has led to significant scientific breakthroughs over the past century. But it is the rapid expansion of computing capabilities in the past decade that has set the stage for the latest revolution of NMR metabolomics, particularly with the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning. AI is already changing the current state of NMR metabolomics by enhancing data processing and workflows and enabling faster acquisition times. AI algorithms can automate tasks like spectral interpretation, predict NMR spectra, and even potentially design new NMR experiments. Recent developments in AI-based tools have significantly accelerated NMR data analysis. The DP4-AI platform, designed for automated interpretation of NMR spectra, has demonstrated a 60-fold increase in processing speed compared to manual human analysis [ 68 69 In the field of metabolomics, AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning algorithms are increasingly capable of processing complex one-dimensional spectra. These tools can perform baseline correction, metabolite identification, and quantification relative to reference compounds with improved accuracy and reduced error. The future of AI empowered NMR metabolomics in the brain and other organs will set the stage for the next round of innovations in diagnostic and metabolic biomarker space in medicine.
