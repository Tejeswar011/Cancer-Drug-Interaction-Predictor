CBFβ-SMMHC retains the RUNX-binding domain from CBFβ and also contains a second RUNX high-affinity binding domain (HABD) in the SMMHC tail, resulting in a higher binding affinity for RUNX1 than wild-type CBFβ ( 19 Another important domain is the C-terminal coiled-coil region of SMMHC, which interacts with mSin3A to repress transcription, and catalyzes homodimerization and multimerization of the CBFβ-SMMHC fusion protein ( 8 10 20 21 22 20 23 To unravel the underlying mechanism of RUNX1’s indispensable role in CBFB-MYH11 18 CBFB-MYH11 CBFB-MYH11 CBFB-MYH11-ΔHABD CBFB-MYH11-mDE Cbfb-MYH11-ΔHABD Cbfb-MYH11-ΔHABD Cbfb-MYH11 Runx1 Runx1 +/R188Q +/56M Mx1-CreCbfb +/56M Results Conditional Cbfb-MYH11-ΔHABD knockin mice exhibit a leukemia profile similar to that of Cbfb-MYH11 mice.

We then explored the effects of these two CBFβ-SMMHC mutations, CBFβ-SMMHC-ΔHABD and CBFβ-SMMHC-mDE, on RUNX1 function, focusing on how these mutations influence CBFβ-SMMHC binding affinity for RUNX1 and RUNX1 binding to its target DNA ( 28 E coli 19 Supplemental Figure 3 Supplemental Figure 3 Cbfb-MYH11-ΔHABD Cbfb-MYH11-mDE 28 Figure 2, A and B We also performed negative staining to evaluate the effect of the CBFβ-SMMHC mutations on filament formation, given the filament-forming properties of SMMHC ( 29 Figure 2C Figure 2D Figure 2D Supplemental Figure 4 22 23 Leukemogenic CBFβ-SMMHC proteins increase RUNX1’s DNA binding in vivo.

Peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow cells from mice were isolated and stained as described previously ( 17 Western blot analysis. Western blot was performed with standard protocols (Invitrogen, NuPAGE electrophoresis system). Internal control GAPDH was detected with anti-GAPDH (Abcam, ab8245), followed by anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (Vector Laboratories, PI-2000-1).

Negative staining was performed using a standard protocol as previously described ( 61 Luciferase reporter assay. 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC]) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS following ATCC recommendations. The cells were transfected with a CSF1R promoter–driven luciferase reporter plasmid ( CSF1R 38 EMSA. EMSA was performed following the IRDye oligonucleotide protocol from LICOR. Briefly, RUNX1 or RUNX1c-Q201Q proteins were generated using the TnT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A 20-nucleotide sequence from the CSF1R promoter (5′-CAAACTCTGTGGTTGCCTTG-3′) labeled with IRDye700 (Integrated DNA Technologies) was used as the DNA probe. Proteins were incubated with the probe at room temperature for 30 minutes, followed by electrophoresis in 4%–12% TBE gels with 1× TBE. Gels were then imaged using an Odyssey Imager (LICOR). Immunofluorescence. HeLa cells (ATCC) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS according to the recommendations of ATCC. HeLa cells grown on cover glasses were transfected with indicated plasmids. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 minutes. Immunofluorescence staining was performed with standard protocols. Mouse bone marrow cells were attached to glass microscopic slides with Cytospin (Shandon). The cells on the slides were then fixed with 4% PFA for 15 minutes, followed by 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes. Immunofluorescent staining was performed with standard protocols. RUNX1 protein was first stained with anti-RUNX1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-365644), followed by anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 fluorescent antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11031). Images were captured with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss) and analyzed with Zen software (Zeiss). The signal of the indicated protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus was quantified by Arivis software (Zeiss). RNA sequencing. Mice of the indicated genotypes were treated with pIpC. Two to three weeks after the final pIpC injection, LK cells were isolated from bone marrow using a BD FACSAria IIIu cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Eight weeks after the final pIpC injection, AMP cells were similarly isolated from bone marrow using the BD FACSAria IIIu cell sorter (BD Biosciences). Total RNA from LK and AMP cells was extracted with AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Poly(A)-selected stranded mRNA libraries were constructed using Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Unique barcode adapters were applied to each library. All libraries were combined in equimolar proportion into one pool for sequencing with a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer.
