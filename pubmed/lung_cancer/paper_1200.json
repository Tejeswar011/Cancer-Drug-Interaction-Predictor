Introduction Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric malignancy worldwide, accounting for 30% of all pediatric malignancies in developed countries and up to 50% in developing ones [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 18 23 24 + 12 13 25 26 27 28 18 29 30 31 2. Results 2.1. Clinical Characteristics of Studied Population Sixty-four children with de novo ALL were included. Saliva samples and bone marrow (BM) were collected at diagnosis; 35 of them were matched normal (saliva)-tumor (BM) tissues. Overall, 58% were male and 42% female, median age of the population was 104.2 months at diagnosis (range: 6.48–202.36 months) and 88% of patients were diagnosed with pre-B immunophenotype. Fourteen (22%) patients presented relapse and 12 (19%) died. The median of the follow-up of the patients was 72 months (range: 60–84 months) after diagnosis confirmation ( Table 1 2.2. Distribution of HLA Class I Alleles HLA genotype frequencies data were estimated for 64 ALL patients, of which 24 HLA–A*, 40 HLA–B* and 23 HLA–C* different alleles were identified. The most common HLA-A alleles in the ALL cohort were HLA-A*02:01 (15.6%) and HLA-A*24:02 (14.8%) present in 10 and 9 of the 64. Among HLA-B and -C alleles, HLA-B*39:05 (9.4%), HLA-B*07:02 (7%), HLA-C*07:01 (26.6%) and HLA-C*04:01 (16.4%) were the most frequent ( Figure 1 Table S1 2.3. High Correlation of Missense Mutation and Neoantigen Load The identification of potential neoantigens was carried out by including 35 paired normal-tumor samples. A total of 33,315 somatically acquired missense mutations were identified. A total of 9880 neoantigens were predicted by considering those peptides that could bind to at least one of the patients’ HLA-A, -B, or -C alleles with an affinity < 500 nM or %Rank < 2%. Even though neoantigens must ultimately be validated for their presentation and recognition by T lymphocytes, we will use the term “neoantigens” to describe “potential neoantigens” throughout the text. A single mutation can generate multiple neoantigens by binding to diverse HLA alleles or in distinct registers; nevertheless, predicted neoantigens were excluded if they displayed the same affinity binding to HLA as their wild-type counterparts. The number of neoantigens ranged from 0 to 4385, with a median of 47 per SYNGAP1 CUL1 COX11 PORCN CPA2 PEX5L TRAF3IP1 IRAK4 RRH CLK4 CLK1 CLTCL1 32 PORCN Figure S1 Table S2 Notably, we found that the number of neoantigens was positively correlated with the number of missense mutations (R = 0.994, p Figure 2 2.4. Association Among Clinical Features, Mutations and Neoantigens Numbers When analyzing by gender, we found that male presented more mutations and neoantigens than female ( X X p Table 2 X p X p Table 2 Figure S2 2.5. Number of Mutations, Neoantigens and Neoantigen Frequency Survival Analysis Patients were stratified in two groups to determine the association between the number of mutations (median = 174) and neoantigens (median = 47) compared to EFS and OS. We found no significant differences between them. As it has been previously described that low number of neoantigenic mutations could be used as an independent prognostic factor for clinical outcome in other cancers [ 33 34 35 Figure S3 2.6. High Correlation Between Number of Mutations in DNA Mismatch Repair Genes and Neoantigens Load As was previously documented, MMR-deficient cancers present a hypermutable state, which could generate a greater number of neoantigens that might be recognized by the immune system [ 26 36 37 MSH2 MSH6 MLH1 PMS2 MSH2 MSH6 MLH1 PMS2 Table S3 Figure 3 Figure 3 p p p Figure 3 Figure S4 3. Discussion The development of immunotherapy in recent years for ALL treatment has been focused on tumor-associated antigens which are overexpressed in leukemic cells but also expressed by normal cells in lower levels or in a specific stage or condition [ 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 43 45 46 18 23 24 22 In HLA-I alleles distribution, A*02:01, A*24:02, B*35:01, B*39:05, C*07:02 and C*04:01 were among the most frequent alleles as has been reported in Mexican ethnic groups like Tarasco, Tarahumara and Mestizo [ 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 55 57 58 59 60 A correlation between high missense mutational burden and predicted neoantigens load was found. Interestingly, our data differs from those published previously. First of all, a study of 100,000 human cancer genomes reported that pediatric malignancies, including pediatric ALL, had low abundance of somatic mutations (tumor mutational burden) [ 61 50 50 12 62 31 63 64 24 65 66 67 68 67 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 After in silico testing of whether the neoantigens can be presented by the MHC using computational prediction tools, additional steps are needed to know if the predicted neoantigens can be recognized by T-cells and induce an immune response: (a) assessing peptide transport from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum mediated by transporters associated with antigen processing is a crucial process in the intracellular presentation of cytotoxic T-cell epitopes [ 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 32 PORCN Another interesting finding was the relation among the higher mutational burden and neoantigen load with the presence of mutations in the DNA MMR genes MSH2 MSH6 MLH1 PMS2. p 26 MLH1 MSH6 MSH2 MLH1 MSH2, 86 36 The association analysis among neoantigen frequency per mutation and clinical (WBC, immunophenotype, EFS and OS) variables showed no statistical differences among groups, which could be explained by the sample size. Since it has been reported that mutational burden and neoantigen load is correlated with prognosis in diverse cancer types (i.e., melanomas, non-small cell lung cancers and colorectal cancer, etc.) [ 87 88 89 90 91 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Patients, Samples and Data Samples of tumor (BM) and normal (saliva) tissues of ALL pediatric patients which were collected at diagnosis and before clinical treatment were included. To identify somatic mutations, which were defined as variants present in tumor tissue but not in normal tissue of the patient, we obtain germline DNA through saliva samples. All patients were under 18 years old and recruited from 2014 to 2016, with a follow-up of >36 months after diagnosis confirmation. Cases were residents of the metropolitan area of Mexico City and recruited from public hospitals and health institutions from Mexico City by the Mexican Interinstitutional Group for the Identification of the Causes of Childhood Leukemia (MIGICCL). ALL diagnosis was confirmed by pediatric hematologists or oncologists according to morphology and immunophenotype of leukemic cells. Clinical data such as gender, age at diagnosis, WBC count, immunophenotype, risk of relapse, relapse and death were registered from the patients’ medical records. Risk stratification criteria from The National Cancer Institute (NCI) was employed. Standard risk: from 1 to 9.99 years of age or WBC count < 50 × 10 9 9 4.2. DNA Isolation and Exome Sequencing Germline DNA from saliva was isolated using prepIT.L2P ORAGENE Purification Kit (DNA Genotek Inc., Kanata, ON, Canada). Tumor DNA was obtained from mononuclear cells, which were isolated from BM mononuclear by density gradient centrifugation and using the Gentra Puregene Blood Kit (Gentra Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA purity and concentration were determined by Nanodrop spectrophotometer ND1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Paired-end whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed with Illumina NEXSeq, kit NexteraXT as previously described [ 92 93 94 95 96 https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html https://gatk.broadinstitute.org 4.3. Class I HLA Alleles Prediction and Peptides–HLA Binding Predictions Optitype ( https://github.com/FRED-2/OptiType 97 Tumor-specific missense mutations were identified to generate an amino acid sequence of potential neoantigens. Peptides covering nine tiling nonamers overlapping each missense mutation were extracted through a program designed with the SeqIO module of Biopython [ 98 99 50 4.4.

Conclusions In this study, we observed a high correlation between mutational burden and antigens load in ALL pediatric cases. Our data favors immunotherapy based on the discovery of neoantigens as an opportunity for developing new ALL treatment protocols in pediatric patients, particularly for treating ALL relapse, which can substantially reduce sequelae derived from conventional chemotherapy.
