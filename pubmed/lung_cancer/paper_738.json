Blocking GSDMD-NT pores is an attractive and promising strategy for mitigating inflammation. Here we demonstrate that SK56, an artificial intelligence-screened peptide, effectively obstructs GSDMD-NT pores and inhibits pyroptosis and cytokine release in macrophages and human peripheral blood leukocyte-induced pyroptosis. SK56 prevents septic death induced by lipopolysaccharide or cecal ligation and puncture surgery in mice. SK56 does not influence cleavage of interleukin-1β or GSDMD. Instead, SK56 inhibits the release of cytokines from pyroptotic macrophages, mitigates the activation of primary mouse dendritic cells triggered by incubation with pyroptotic cytomembranes and prevents widespread cell death of human alveolar organoids in an organoid–macrophage coculture model. SK56 blocks GSDMD-NT pores on lipid-bilayer nanoparticles and enters pyroptotic macrophages to inhibit mitochondrial damage. SK56 presents new therapeutic possibilities for counteracting inflammation, which is implicated in numerous diseases. Wang and colleagues show that an AI-assisted designed peptide obstructs GSDMD pores and inhibits IL-1β and IL-18 release and pyroptosis.

Peptide 11 (hereafter, SK56) exhibited the strongest inhibition of both IL-1β and IL-18 release in THP-1 cells compared to other tested peptides (Fig. 2a,b 2c 3d 1 3e 3f 2 3g Fig. 2 SK56 delays pyroptosis and IL-1β release and prevents mitochondrial damage without affecting cleavage of GSDMD or IL-1β. a −1 −1 n b a n P −7 P −8 c 1 + n d e d n e n −1 d e f h 3 f g h a n i n j −1 a c e g t Source data SK56 (15 μM) inhibited pyroptosis and decreased IL-1β secretion in BMDMs transfected with LPS compared to PBS control (Extended Data Fig. 3h,i 3j 2 2 2 3k–m 4a 2d,e 4b 2d,e 4c To investigate whether SK56 interacted with GSDMD-NT and gained entry into pyroptotic cells, we conjugated fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to the SK56 C terminus. Live-cell imaging in LPS + nigericin-treated THP-1 cells in which mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed with MitoTracker red indicated that SK56–FITC did not enter cells within 0–30 min but colocalized with the cell membrane and the mitochondria at 30 min after the addition of LPS + nigericin (Fig. 2f 3 2f,g 4d 2h 4d 29 2i 2j 4e 4f 4g 30 SK56 inhibits pyroptosis by blocking GSDMD-NT pore function Next, we used biolayer interferometry to analyze the effect of SK56 on pyroptotic cytomembranes.

Methods Ethics statement Human paracancerous lung tissue was collected at the Daping Hospital of Army Medical University.

HT-29 (HTB-38, ATCC) cells were maintained in McCoy’s 5a modified medium (16600082, Gibco). AC16 (CRL-3568, ATCC) and RAW264.7 (TIB-71, ATCC) cells were cultured in DMEM (11965092, Gibco). Male C57BL/6 mice (8 weeks of age) were anesthetized via i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbital at a dose of 70 mg per kg (body weight). The abdominal area was disinfected with an iodine tincture for 5 min, followed by disinfection with 75% ethanol for another 5 min. A midline incision was made to expose the abdominal cavity, and the skin was carefully retracted. The femurs were removed, as well as the surrounding muscle tissue. The bones were then disinfected with 75% ethanol for 30 s and washed three times with PBS. Using fine scissors, the joints at both ends of the femur were clipped, and bone marrow was extracted by flushing the cavity with precooled PBS using a 2-ml syringe. The collected cell suspension was filtered through a 200-μm mesh and centrifuged at 3,300 g g −1 −1 2 For canonical inflammasome activation, THP-1 cells were first differentiated by incubation with 150 nM PMA (HY-18739, MCE) for 24 h and then primed with LPS (1 μg ml −1 −1 2 2 5 2 5 Design and training of interactive interface generative models To obtain the training data, we collected real interactions from the PDB database and used these interaction data to train a slightly modified Transformer model (Fig. 1a 27 x–y–z Charge is an important influencing factor in protein interactions, and we quickly obtained the charge of all atoms in ~40,000 interaction interfaces using the ff14SB force field 50 e M e M e M The trained model can be used to output the ideal atomic coordinates, charges and atom types of an interaction interface.
