Although not involved in the development of the observed inflammatory reaction, such heightened sensitivity may help explain, at least in part, the sensory discomfort frequently reported in paediatric eczema, underscoring the need to address both immune and sensory dimensions of the disease.

Discussion Our findings support a new model in which the inflammatory and sensory features of early-onset paediatric eczema originate from molecular dysregulations of neuronal and immune compartments in utero triggered by fluctuations in the maternal HPA axis. These results provide a unique view on potent tissue-specific imprinting by maternal glucocorticoids and identify fetal skin mast cells as critical for full development of eczematous lesions at birth in response to otherwise innocuous mechanical friction (Extended Data Fig. 8 40 43 44 9 45 50 48 51 53 Mcpt5 cre Dta Early life is a critical period for the establishment of the microbiome and skin colonization 54 7 55 57 54 58 60 61 62 In summary, our results bring a new concept, in which early-onset eczema with remission could have a prenatal origin. It is interesting to speculate that such PS-associated ‘fragilized’ skin barrier at birth could then favour skin colonization by pathogenic microbiota 54 63 65 Methods Mice Mice were bred and housed in the local animal facilities of the Centre Régional d’Exploration Fonctionnelle et de Ressources Expérimentales (CREFRE) in pathogen-free sanitary conditions, with free access to water and food, and were submitted to alternating cycles of 12 h of light and darkness at an ambient temperature of 22 °C. C57BL6j mice were purchased from Janvier Labs or Charles River laboratories. Mcpt5 cre 66 Cdh5 creERT2 m T m G 9 P t 67 9 23 Animal study approval All animal care and experimentation were conducted in France in compliance with the guidelines of the European Union (86/609/EEC) and the French Committee of Ethics (87/848) policies and with the specific approval from the local ministry-approved committee on ethics in animal experimentation (Ethics Committee UMS006 CEEA-122; project no. 21938-2019090417341270v5). Upon arrival in the animal facility, the animals were housed in accordance with European Directive 2010/63/EU. The mice were kept in cages at 20–24 °C with 45–65% humidity, in groups of three for females and two for males, and litters were housed in groups of five. Timed pregnancies W8 to W10 male and female mice were subjected to timed pregnancies and introduced to a breeding diet (SAFE A03; 69.2% cereals, 6% animal proteins, 20.2% plant proteins and 4.6% vitamins and minerals) at E0. Successful mating was judged by the presence of vaginal plugs, which defined E0.5 post-conception. Female weight was monitored all along the gestation period, and gestation was confirmed by a significant increase in body weight, where a weight gain of greater than 3.5 g from E0 to E13 was indicative of gestation. In addition to wild-type pairing, mating pairs were designed as follows: Kit Wsh/Wsh Kit Wsh/Wsh Kit +/Wsh Kit + /Wsh iDTA fl/fl Mcpt5 cre + Chronic PS model PS was induced, as previously described 7 Metyrapone treatment CT and PS dams were injected intraperitoneally with 50 µg g −1 In utero tamoxifen administration and fate mapping For Cdh5 creERT2 ROSA mT/mG ROSA Tdt/Tdt Cdh5 creERT2 +/− ROSA mT/mG ROSA Tdt/Tdt Cdh5 creERT2 ROSA Tdt Cdh5 creERT2 ROSA mT/mG Model of mild wet skin friction Mouse back skin was shaved and treated with a PBS-filled gauze pad occluded in Tegaderm Transparent Dressing (3M Health Care) every 2 days. On day 5, the gauze pads were removed, and the mice were left without any treatment for 2 days. This cycle was repeated for extra 2 weeks. Two days after the last cycle of treatment, the mice were euthanized, and back skin specimens corresponding to the treated areas were obtained for analysis. Skin inflammation was graded by unbiased measurement of the epidermal thickness. Only skin lesions found in the patching area were taken into consideration. Mild model of tape stripping and TEWL measurements The back skins of W3 and W8–W12 mice were shaved using an electrical razor. To disrupt the skin barrier, tape strips (autoclave tapes) were pressed firmly against the shaved area and removed immediately after application. This procedure was repeated on day 1 (five tape strips for W8 and three tape strips for W3) and day 6 (two tape strips for W8 and three tape strips for W3). Tweezers were used to remove the tape in a fluent stroke. The tape strip application was always conducted by the same person to avoid any bias owing to strength and applied pressure differences. Barrier permeability was monitored using TEWL measurements (in g m −2 −1 Multiplex proximity extension assay (Olink) Skin sections were disrupted in RIPA Lysis Buffer (1:10; EMD Millipore Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (cOmplete Mini EDTA-free tablets; EASYpack; Roche) and homogenized using CKMix beads (Bertin) and Precellys 24 homogenizer. Skin sections were then processed with two cycles of 6,500 rpm for 20 s. The protein concentrations of clarified tissue were measured by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were subsequently normalized to a concentration of 0.5 mg ml −1 The obtained skin lysates, amniotic fluid and serum samples were analysed using a proximity extension assay using the Olink Target 48 Mouse Cytokine panel in the presence of internal (incubation, extension and detection CTs) and external CTs. Data were analysed using a preprocessing normalization procedure. For each sample and data point, the corresponding quantification cycle (Cq) value for the extension CT was subtracted, thus normalizing for technical variation in one run. Normalization between runs was then performed for each assay by subtracting the corresponding ΔCq value for the median of the three calibrator replicates from the ΔCq values generated. The normalized protein expression unit generated was on the basis of a log 2 −1 −1 Mechanical alloknesis test W8–W12 mice were shaved at the nape of the neck and acclimated for 30 min in the experimental room and then in Plexiglas boxes of the same size for 30 min, one day before the allokinesis test. The same habituation was carried out on the day of the test. Each mouse received five innocuous mechanical stimuli at the nape of the neck from two von Frey filaments (0.07 g and 0.4 g; Bioseb BIO-VF-M). The response of the mice after each stimulation was scored (0, no reaction; 1, head movement; 2, action towards the filament; 3, scratching), and the percentage of total response was plotted. Sticky-tape assay W8–W12 mice were acclimated for 30 min in the experimental room and then in Plexiglas boxes for 20 min. A white 12.7-mm circular adhesive tape was gently placed to the upper back of the mice between shoulders. The tape-directed responses of the mice were monitored as follows 67 x von Frey filament test W8–W12 were acclimated for 1 h in the testing arena. Increasing diameter filaments delivering increasing predetermined forces were applied perpendicularly to the hind paw surface of the mouse until they buckle. The 0.02-g von Frey filament was used as the starting filament. Subsequently, filaments of 0.04 g, 0.07 g, 0.16 g, 0.4 g, 0.6 g, 1.4 g and 2 g were used. Any brisk behaviour, including paw withdrawal, licking or shaking during the probing or immediately after the filament was removed, was considered as a positive response. For each mouse, the paw withdrawal threshold was determined as the filament force that induced a positive response on three of five trials. Passive cutaneous anaphylaxis The ears of W8 offspring were injected intradermally with 8-µg ciprofloxacine, an MrgprB2 agonist in 20-μl PBS. Ear swelling was measured every 10 min under light anaesthesia (2% isoflurane), starting just before injection (T0) and ending 2 h after injection (T120). Peanut-induced anaphylaxis Mice were sensitized with 1 mg of peanut extract (clinical-grade preparations used for skin testing; Stallergenes Laboratories) along with 10 μg of cholera toxin (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100-μl water (HCO 3 − Short model of asthma and lung dissociation W8 offspring were sensitized by intranasal administration of lipopolysaccharide on day 0 (D0) and either PBS or 20 µg (30 µl) of the HDM strain Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus −1 −1 Resiniferatoxin treatment To ablate TRPV1 + −1 Chemical sympathectomy 6-OHDA (Sigma) was dissolved in vehicle solution (0.01% ascorbic acid) in saline solution.

The sections were then washed 3 times in PBS 0.5% (w/v)% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 and incubated, if needed, with the following secondary antibodies in PBS 0.5% (w/v)% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature in the dark: Donkey anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen; A31571; 1:200), Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen; A11012; 1:200), Donkey anti-Sheep IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen, A21099; 1:200), Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen; A11008; 1:200) and Goat anti-Rat IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; A21247; 1:200). The slides were then washed, mounted in Mowiol medium and sealed with a coverslip. Z-stack images (512 × 512) were acquired using Leica STELLARIS, Leica SP8 and Zeiss LSM 710 Meta inverted confocal laser scanning microscopes and were processed using ImageJ (v.2.16.0) and Imaris (Bitplane; v.9.5.1) software. The MFIs of key epidermal proteins were analysed using the ‘measurement function’ of ImageJ software (v.2.16.0) on randomly chosen epidermal zones of identical areas on three non-overlapping sections (same total number of pixels). The cell bodies of neurons were counted on at least three images of three non-overlapping DRG sections (from lower thoracic to upper lumbar DRG) per mouse. Data were presented as percentage of Tdtomato + Haematoxylin and eosin Mouse back skin sections were stained according to standard procedures at the histopathology department CREFRE U006. Slides were then scanned using a Pannoramic Digital Slide Scanner (3DHISTECH). For measurement of epidermal thickness, three randomly selected measurements of the distance between the stratum corneum and the basal layer of the epidermis were recorded using the slide viewing application CaseViewer 2.3. Computational analysis of filament length of neurons in the skin The 3D high-resolution images were taken using a Leica TCS SP8 MP Meta inverted confocal microscope, as described above. The images were then processed using the software Imaris (Bitplane; v.9.5.1). The filament tracer algorithm was applied in the Tubβ3, TH, IB4, NFH and Gfrα2 channels for precise tracing of the trajectories and shapes of Tubβ3 + + + + + + Mouse tissue enzymatic digestion and gradient separation Cell suspensions from embryonic and adult mouse tissues were obtained through mechanical dissociation and enzymatic digest. Briefly, adult back skin from W8 or W24 mice was collected in pre-digestion medium, finely minced and incubated at 37 °C on a rotating plate to remove epithelial cells and other impurities. The samples were then digested for 45 min on a rotating plate with 1.25 mg of Liberase (Sigma) and 2.5 mg of DNAse I (Sigma) to disaggregate the tissue. The samples were further dissociated with the Miltenyi gentleMACS Dissociator, and cells were then enriched with a Percoll gradient. Fetal skin was collected, finely minced and digested in RPMI medium containing 0.1 mg ml −1 −1 −1 −1 Single-cell suspensions were then used for flow cytometry.

Immune cell populations were gated as follows: γδ T cells: CD45 + − − + + CD4 + + − − + − + − CD8 + + − − + − − + Regulatory T cells: CD45 + − − + + Natural killer cells: CD45 + − − − + Natural killer T cells: CD45 + − − + + ILC2: CD45 + − − − + ILC3: CD45 + − − + − Dermal dendritic cell: CD45 + + + + Langerhans cell: CD45 + + + Neutrophil: CD45 + + + + Monocyte: CD45 + + + − Macrophage: CD45 + + + Alveolar macrophage (adult lung): CD45 + + + + Basophil: CD45 + − + Eosinophil: CD45 + + + Mast cell (adult tissues): CD45 + − + + Mast cell (fetal skin): CD45 + − − + + All cells were pregated as viable (using SYTOX viability dye) singlets. Tissue RNA extraction Skin samples or DRG from adult mice were stored immediately in RNAlater then dissociated in TRIzol with the Miltenyi gentleMACS Dissociator. Tissue RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Qiagen Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Fetal mast cells were sorted, as described above. RNA was then extracted using RNeasy Qiagen Micro Kit according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. RNA quality and titres were analysed using NanoDrop. RNA was either used for bulk RNA-seq or real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Preparation of libraries for bulk RNA-seq Sample quality CT and libraries were prepared at the GeT-Santé facility 38 39 Bulk RNA-seq The quantification and sequencing of libraries were performed at the GeT-PlaGe core facility (Institut National de Recherche pour l’Agriculture, l’Alimentation et l’Environnement). Libraries were quantified by means of qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Roche) to obtain an accurate quantification. Libraries were equimolarly pooled, and RNA-seq was then performed on one S prime lane of the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina) using the NovaSeq 6000 S prime v.1 Reagent Kit (300 cycles) and a paired-end 2 × 150-pb strategy. FastQC was performed on sequence reads to evaluate the sequencing quality. Reads were then aligned on GRCm39 (mm10) as a reference genome using STAR (v.2.4.0) 68 69 70 Preparation of libraries for scRNA-seq Approximately 16,000 cells per sample were encapsulated into droplets using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v.3.1 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics). Briefly, after generation of nanolitre-scale Gel bead-in-EMulsion (GEM) using Next GEM Chip G, GEMs were reverse transcribed in a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) programmed at 53 °C for 45 min and 85 °C for 5 min and held at 4 °C. After reverse transcription, single-cell droplets were broken, and cDNA was isolated and cleaned with Clean-Up Mix containing Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then, cDNA was amplified with a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler programmed at 98 °C for 3 min, 12 cycles of (98 °C for 15 s, 63 °C for 20 s and 72 °C for 1 min) and 72 °C for 1 min and held at 4 °C. Subsequently, the amplified cDNA was fragmented, end-repaired, A-tailed, index adaptor ligated and cleaned with Clean-Up Mix containing SPRIselect Reagent Kit (Beckman Coulter) in between steps. Post-ligation product was amplified and indexed with a C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler programmed at 98 °C for 45 s, 14 cycles of (98 °C for 20 s, 54 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 20 s) and 72 °C for 1 min and held at 4 °C. The sequencing-ready libraries were cleaned up with SPRIselect beads. Libraries prepared using 10x Genomics technology were pooled and charged with 1% PhiX on one S prime lane of the NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina) using the NovaSeq 6000 S prime Reagent Kit v.1.5 (200 cycles) and the following sequencing parameters: 28 bp read 1, 8 bp index 1 (i7) and 150 bp read 2. The S prime lane generated a total of 434 × 10 6 Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis Preprocessing Transcript reads were demultiplexed, aligned to reference mouse genome (mm10 - GENCODE vM23/Ensembl 98) and quantified using the Cell Ranger v.7.0.1 (ref. 71 72 73 Processing We then ran the Seurat standard analysis pipeline: normalization, finding highly variable genes, scaling and PCA. Variance explainability of the principal component dimensions was observed, and the first 20 principal components were chosen for downstream analysis. The dataset consisted of two batches, which were integrated using the Harmony package v.1.0.3 (ref. 74 k Cell identification FindAllMarkers() function was used to determine the marker genes of the computed unsupervised clusters of the cells. By examining the expression of a set of canonical markers within our clusters, we successfully identified a total of 13 distinct cell types: Cd3e Itgae Trdc Cd207 Ly75 Xcr1 Flt3 Lyz2 Mrc1 Gzmb Ncr1 Ms4a1 Cd79b S100a9 S100a8 Il17a Il23r Ccr6 Gata3 Cpa3 Tpsb2 Krt14 Differential gene expression analysis For the annotated cell types, the Poisson test within Seurat’s FindMarkers() function was run to compare one group to another. Genes with P adj 2 Preparation of libraries for single-nucleus Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression The back skin of W8 and W24, CT and PS offspring ( n + Nuclei isolation Single nuclei were isolated following the 10x Genomics Nuclei Isolation for Single Nuclei Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing protocol ( CG000365 Single-nucleus partitioning and library preparation Nuclei were immediately treated using the 10x Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Nuclei Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression protocol ( CG000338 Sequencing The resulting gene expression and ATAC libraries were quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analysed for fragment size distribution using an Agilent TapeStation before sequencing. The libraries were pooled at the recommended ratio and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform at the Technology Cluster of the Toulouse Cancer Research Centre (CRCT) using paired-end reads (read 1, 50 bp; read 2, 49 bp; index 1, 8 bp; index 2, 24 bp) and using paired-end reads (read 1, 28 bp; read 2, 90 bp; index 1, 10 bp; index 2, 10 bp), targeting a sequencing depth of approximately 50,000 read pairs per nucleus for gene expression to achieve a sequencing depth of 3,350 median fragments per cell for 19,946 cells post-aggregation. Multiome data processing and integration Preprocessing and quality control Single-nucleus multiome sequencing data, including ATAC-seq and single-nucleus RNA-seq reads, were processed using Cell Ranger ARC (v.2.0.2). Reads were demultiplexed, aligned to the reference mouse genome (mm10 - GENCODE vM23/Ensembl 98) and quantified to generate filtered feature matrices and ATAC fragment files. The resulting datasets were loaded into Seurat (v.5.1.0) and Signac (v.1.14.0) for downstream analysis. Raw read files from all samples were merged into a single Seurat object, followed by quality control filtering to remove low-quality or multiple nuclei. Nuclei were retained if they met the following criteria: (single-nucleus RNA sequencing) 300 or more RNA features, total RNA counts of less than 5,000 and less than 10% mitochondrial RNA content; (snATAC-seq) ATAC peak counts between 100 and 20,000, nucleosome signal less than 0.75 and transcription start site enrichment score above 2. After filtering, a total of 12,499 high-quality nuclei were retained for downstream analysis: 2,130 nuclei from CT W8, 4,094 nuclei from PS W8, 3,767 nuclei from CT W24 and 2,508 nuclei from PS W24. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing data processing Gene expression values were log-normalized and scaled. Highly variable genes were identified; PCA was performed, retaining 50 principal components. Batch correction was applied using Harmony, and the corrected embeddings were stored for downstream analysis. snATAC-seq data processing For chromatin accessibility data, peaks with a minimum of five reads were retained. Term frequency–inverse document frequency normalization was applied, followed by singular value decomposition, keeping 50 latent semantic indexing components. Batch correction was applied using Harmony, and corrected embeddings were stored. Multiomic integration and clustering A weighted nearest neighbour graph was constructed using Harmony-corrected embeddings from RNA and ATAC data. The first 50 dimensions from RNA and 2–50 dimensions from ATAC were used. A joint UMAP was generated, and clustering was performed using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution of 0.1. For cell identification, similar markers to those listed above were used. Differential analysis of accessible regions To identify DARs of chromatin, pairwise comparisons were performed across experimental conditions. The analysis was conducted using the FindMarkers() function in Seurat with the model-based analysis of single-cell transcriptomics test, considering the chromatin accessibility data (ATAC assay). Comparisons were investigated for PS W8 versus CT W8, PS W24 versus CT W24 and PS W24 versus PS W8 groups. Only regions with a minimum detection rate of 5% across cells were considered. Genes associated with DARs were annotated using the ClosestFeature() function of Signac package (v.1.14.0). Significant DAR-associated genes were defined on the basis of a false discovery rate threshold of 0.05 and a log 2 Real-time qPCR analysis RNA (1 μg) preparations from mouse skin were used for total RNA reverse transcription with SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System kit (Invitrogen) using random hexamers (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for priming. Transcripts encoding chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 20, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interferon-γ, ILs (IL-10, IL-12p35, IL-12p40, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6), oncostatin M, retinoic acid receptor-related orphan nuclear receptor-γt, signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat; Stat3, Stat4 and Stat6) and transforming growth factor-β1 were quantified using real-time PCR using specific forward and reverse primers, the Takyon SYBR 2X MasterMix blue dTTP kit (Eurogentec) and quantified using the LightCycler 480 II (Roche Diagnostics).
