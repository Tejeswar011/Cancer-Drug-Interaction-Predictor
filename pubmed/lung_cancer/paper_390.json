Conventional therapeutic approaches exhibit disappointing efficacies due to difficulty in drug delivery and systemic cytotoxicity. In recent years, novel formulations of therapeutic drugs rised as alternatives for clinical treatment. Among them, cell-derived drug delivery systems (CDDSs) have garnered attention for their potential in treating PDs. By harnessing the innate migratory capabilities, barrier-crossing potential, high biocompatibility, and substantial drug-loading capacity of cell derivatives, CDDSs offer a promising approach for PD treatment. However, there was no systemic report in summarizing CDDSs in PDs. In this review, We first examined the biological properties and therapeutic advantages of various CDDSs in the context of PDs, including red blood cells (RBCs), stem cells, platelets, macrophages, neutrophils, tumor cells, microalgae, extracellular vesicles (EVs) and biomimetic cell membrane. We then discussed common preparation strategies and different modification methods of CDDSs. Finally, we summarized the current therapeutic advancements of CDDSs in multiple PDs. We hope this review serves as a valuable reference for utilizing CDDSs in the treatment of PDs and other diseases.

Introduction Pulmonary diseases (PDs) are the third leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, after cancer and cardiovascular diseases (Geiger et al. 2017 2022 2023 2021 2022 2021 2023 Nanotechnology, as an emerging filed, has found extensive application in PDs. This is attributed to its capacity to improve medication bioavailability and targeting, increase the period of drug accumulation in the lungs, and decrease systemic adverse effects (Zhong et al. 2021 2019 2015 2020 2007 2023 2024 2022 2022 2023 2022 2021 2021 2020 2021 2024 2023 2022 2015 2020 Table 1 Table 1. Advantages, limitations, and clinical translation readiness of three delivery systems.

The introduction of cell therapy 2.1. Biological classifications and functions of CDDSs RBCs, stem cells, macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes and others possess unique characteristics within bodies and show broad prospects in drug delivery. Here in this section, we describe the classification of various types of cells and their functions in PDs treatment ( Figure 1 Figure 1. Functions of different cells in the treatment of PDs. Figure was created with BioRender.com. 2.1.1. RBCs RBCs are the most abundant type of blood cells, and their primary biological function is to transfer oxygen and carbon dioxide to sustain normal physiological metabolism (Han et al. 2018 2015 2021 2006 2021 2023 2021 2022 2018 2020 2021 2.1.2. Stem cells Stem cells are a class of undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that have the potential to differentiate into various cell types within the body. Typically, these cells exhibit the capacity to drive tissue repair and regeneration, and they can directly target damaged lung tissue to promote its recovery (Cheng et al. 2022 2008 2013 2021 2010 2019 2013 2013 2021 2016 2021 2.1.3. Platelets Platelets are vital to human blood circulation, and in addition to coagulation and hemostasis, they also participate in other physiological processes, including thrombosis and vascular repair (Zhu et al. 2024 2019 2005 2022 2019 2019 2020 2.1.4. Macrophages Macrophages, which originate from blood monocytes, are versatile innate immune cells distributed across various tissues in the body (Guo and Qian 2024 2021 2024 2021 2024 2023 2.1.5. Neutrophils An essential part of the innate immune system, neutrophils are the most prevalent form of white blood cells in the human circulation. They take part in defense against cancers, autoimmune reactions, tissue healing after acute injury, and the regulation of chronic inflammatory responses, among other vital functions (Liew and Kubes 2019 2021 2018 2024 2.1.6. Tumor cells As a class of cells that proliferate abnormally, tumor cells have biological roles such as promoting angiogenesis, evading apoptosis, promoting rapidly cell division, facilitating migration and invasion, and having unique metabolic pathways (Lei et al. 2020 2021 2019 2019 2018 2024 2019 2011 2.1.7. Microalgae Microalgae are unicellular microorganisms capable of photosynthesis, including eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Their cell membranes exhibit a porous structure, primarily consisting of multi-layered fibrous structures such as cellulose, proteins, and algal polysaccharides, which contribute to their large surface area, and the polysaccharides and proteins within the cell walls endow microalgae with numerous functional groups, which are characteristics that promote their potential for drug binding (Zhou et al. 2023 2021 2020 2022 2020 2.1.8. EVs and exosomes EVs are membrane-bound vesicles released by cells, which can be classified into exosomes, microvesicles, and others based on their origin and size. These carriers originate from the cells themselves, and their membrane structure is similar to that of the host cells, giving them good biocompatibility and making them less likely to cause immune rejection, thereby providing a safe foundation for the treatment of PDs (Wang et al. 2022 2021 2021 2020 2015 2024 2021 2022 2015 2021 2022 2025 2.1.9. Cell membrane biomimetic A biomimetic cell membrane technology is a novel drug delivery system that has emerged in recent years. It primarily utilizes the bioactive components of natural cell membranes to encapsulate drugs. Such carriers can fully retain the surface receptors and functional proteins of their source cells, enabling them to mimic the biological behavior of natural cells during in vivo delivery. This approach aims to overcome the unique physiological barriers and pathological environments of the lungs (Fang et al. 2018 2023 2015 2023 2022 2016 2.2. Preparation strategies of CDDSs Cell carriers have been prepared using a variety of techniques, such as physical adhesion, chemical modification, biological phagocytosis, and genetic engineering ( Figure 2 Figure 2. Schematic illustration of the main drug-loading strategies of CDDSs. These strategies mainly include extracellular loading strategy, intracellular loading strategy and genetic technology. The figure was illustrated by Adobe Illustrator. 2.2.1. Encapsulating drugs within the interior of carrier cells The cytoplasmic compartments of cells offer ample space for drug loading, making intracellular encapsulation one of the simplest methods. Cells that naturally exhibit phagocytic abilities, such as neutrophils and macrophages, can directly ingest drugs into their cytoplasm (Guo and Qian 2024 2024 2020 2017 2018 2016 2014 2014 2021 2025 2.2.2. Attaching drugs to the surface of carrier cells The cell membrane is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and a phospholipid bilayer. Its surface is rich with ligands, receptors, and motifs, which allows drug carriers to connect to it (Zhang et al. 2021 2021 2022 2022 2014 2022 2023 2017 2.2.3. Techniques in genetic engineering An alternative preparation strategy involves integrating the genes encoding functional compounds into the genome of vector cells. In the field of tumor therapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology has garnered significant attention. CAR-T cell therapy, by integrating CAR-encoding genes into the genome of T cells, enables them to specifically recognize and eliminate tumor cells (Larson and Maus 2021 2017 2023 2016 2022 2023 2025 2.3. Cell uptake mechanisms, endosomal escape, and drug release kinetics involved in drug delivery systems 2.3.1. Cell uptake mechanisms In live cell delivery systems, drug uptake by cells is the initial and critical step. Taking macrophages as an example, their drug uptake is primarily achieved through phagocytosis, as macrophages can directly internalize drugs or drug-loaded particles via phagocytosis (Guo and Qian 2024 2019 2016 2020 2023 2019 2.3.2. Endosomal escape Endosomal escape is a critical step in drug release. Live cell delivery systems can achieve endosomal escape through various mechanisms, including the proton sponge effect and membrane fusion mechanisms (Xu et al. 2021 2016 2019 2024 2024 2020 2024 2015 2022 2.3.3. Drug release kinetics The drug release kinetics of live cell delivery systems are relatively complex and influenced by multiple factors. The release of drugs within cells may be associated with cellular metabolic activity. For example, when macrophages are in an inflammatory environment, their enhanced metabolic activity may lead to changes in the membrane permeability of intracellular drug-loaded vesicles, thereby accelerating drug release (Guo and Qian 2024 2021 2021 2023 2021 2016 2021 2019 2022 3. Application advances of CDDSs in PDs PDs seriously threaten the global health of people, and current clinical treatments for PDs are often associated with issues such as drug therapy side effects, bacterial resistance, and limited bioavailability (Zhong et al. 2021 Table 2 Table 2.

Pulmonary infection Pulmonary infection is an infectious lesion that occurs in the interstitium or parenchyma of the lungs and is one of the diseases that affect human health. Pneumonia manifests clinically as a lung infection, primarily driven by diverse pathogens. While the advent and advancement of antibiotics and viral vaccines have significantly curtailed pneumonia-related mortality, the escalating issue of antibiotic resistance has emerged as a formidable hurdle in the clinical management of pneumonia (Zhong et al. 2021 Figure 5(A) 2023 Figure 5(B) 2022 Figure 5(C) Figure 5(D) 2021 Figure 5(E) 2022 Figure 5.

PF PF is a progressive, long-term lung disease characterized by an overabundance of extracellular matrix components, leading to lung tissue scarring and impaired respiratory performance (Wang et al. 2024 2018 2019 2010 2017 2018 2013 2017 Figure 6(A) 2021 2003 2017 2018 Figure 6(B) 2020 Figure 6(C) 2023 Figure 6.

ARDS ARDS is a clinical condition marked by widespread alveolar damage, inflammation, and edema, which can result in acute respiratory failure and compromise gas exchange and oxygenation (Battaglini et al. 2023 2022 2018 2018 2020 2017 2014 Figure 7(A) Figure 7(B) 2024 Figure 7(C) Figure 7(D) 2022 2023 2015 2020 2021 2022 2015 2024 2021 2019 2024 Figure 7.

The clinical limitations and challenges of CDDSs 4.1. Safety and ethical issues Living cells face some safety issues when used as carriers. For example, platelets can promote tumor angiogenesis and maintain its vascular function, as well as enhance treatment resistance by promoting cancer proliferation and forming an immunosuppressive microenvironment, while also protecting and transferring tumor cells from attack (Li et al., 2022 2020 2022 2024 2014 2018 2020 4.2. The challenge of cell carrier delivery due to the complexity of PDs When drugs enter the lungs, they typically need to overcome two major pulmonary barriers. The first is the mechanical barrier. When the lungs are in a diseased state, such as during an infection, it may trigger bronchial constriction or excessive mucus secretion, which can narrow the airways. Additionally, the cilia on the pulmonary mucosa can clear particles deposited in the airways, which are specific manifestations of the pulmonary mechanical barrier (Newman 2017 2021 2020 2021 2009 2009 2026 2021 2023 2024 2023 2024 2022 2021 4.3. Production and clinical challenges Although cells, exosomes, EVs, and biomimetic membrane delivery systems have shown promising prospects in the treatment of pulmonary diseases, there are still many challenges to their clinical application. Currently, there are no unified and comprehensive regulatory standards for cells and exosomes. The diversity of cell sources, the complex preparation process of exosomes, and the uncertainty of their composition make it difficult for regulatory agencies to establish precise and universal evaluation criteria. Take MSCsas an example: MSCs from different tissue sources exhibit differences in biological characteristics, differentiation potential, and immune regulatory functions, posing significant challenges for quality control and safety assessment. For exosomes, each step from donor cell selection, exosome separation and purification to final product quality testing lacks standardized operating procedures. Additionally, large-scale production of high-quality cells, exosomes, and related delivery systems faces numerous difficulties. Cell culture requires strict control of environmental conditions, and cell growth rates are limited, making it difficult to obtain large quantities of uniform cell populations in a short time. Similarly, the separation and purification of exosomes are difficult to scale up. While ultracentrifugation is widely used, it is time-consuming, labor-intensive, yields low output, and is prone to contamination by impurities, making it unsuitable for meeting clinical demand. Storage conditions also significantly impact the stability and activity of these delivery systems. Both cells and exosomes require low-temperature storage, but long-term cryopreservation is costly, and the freeze-thaw process can damage them, leading to reduced viability. This further complicates their clinical application. Therefore, a production protocol compliant with GMP is crucial, yet current capabilities in this area remain limited. For exosomes and engineered cells, their preparation demands even higher standards. Exosome production requires ensuring that every step is standardized and reproducible, encompassing cell culture, exosome isolation, purification, and quality control. Simultaneously, the particle size distribution, protein, and lipid composition of exosomes must undergo rigorous testing to guarantee consistency and safety. Engineered cells, meanwhile, demand rigorous cell bank management, process control, and environmental monitoring. Parameters such as culture medium composition, cell density, and temperature must be tightly controlled to guarantee consistent cell stability and differentiation potential. Although there are many challenges, the clinical translation ofCDDSs for the treatment of pulmonary diseases is accelerating. Currently, a large number of clinical trials targeting ARDS, PF, and lung cancer are underway. As one of the most clinically mature CDDSs, MSCs have been widely applied in multiple clinical trials. For example, NCT04361942 NCT04447833 NCT04493242 NCT06919380 NCT03830619 5. Conclusions and perspective Cells, exosomes, EVs, and biomimetic membrane delivery systems are emerging carriers that bring new hope for the treatment of PDs. The inherent migration ability, barrier penetration potential, high biocompatibility, and significant drug-carrying capacity of cells show great potential in the treatment of PDs. As important mediators of intercellular communication, exosomes and EVs are rich in bioactive molecules, can regulate lung cell function, and have advantages such as low immunogenicity and good biocompatibility. They show anti-inflammatory and repair-promoting effects in the treatment of PDs. Biomimetic cell membrane delivery systems can simulate the structure and function of biological membranes, thereby enhancing the stability, targeting, and drug-carrying capacity of carriers, providing new strategies for the precise treatment of pulmonary diseases. Although they have been widely used in the treatment of pulmonary diseases, these carriers still face challenges in clinical applications. Cell carriers have limited sources, complex culture and amplification, and require long-term safety assessment. The large-scale preparation, purification, and quality control of exosomes and EVs lack standardized processes, affecting batch consistency and clinical application. The construction of biomimetic membrane delivery systems is complex, costly, and their long-term biosafety requires further investigation. In the future, it is necessary to deeply explore the mechanisms of action of these carriers, optimize preparation and delivery technologies, establish a comprehensive quality control and safety evaluation system, strengthen clinical research, and achieve clinical translation.
