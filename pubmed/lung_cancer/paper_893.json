Stanniocalcin‐1 (STC1) is a glycoprotein hormone involved in multiple biological processes in cancer cells. However, the function and underlying mechanism of STC1 in GBM still remain unclear. To this end, exploring the potential functional role and mechanism of STC1 inducing TMZ resistance becomes an urgent need for individual individualized strategies for GBM. The GSE151680 Glioblastoma (GBM), a neuroepithelial‐derived lethal malignancy, remains incurable due to its intrinsic heterogeneity, necessitating molecular biomarkers for precision therapeutics. STC1 promotes GBM progression and temozolomide (TMZ) resistance by activating the NF‐κB signaling pathway, which drives epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhances tumor aggressiveness. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of STC1 suppresses NF‐κB‐mediated EMT, reduces tumor invasion, and restores TMZ sensitivity in GBM models. Targeting the STC1/NF‐κB/EMT axis represents a promising therapeutic strategy for overcoming chemoresistance in GBM.

Bioinformatics analyses reveal STC1 overexpression correlates with advanced pathology and dismal prognosis. Functional studies demonstrate that STC1 genetic manipulation affects proliferation, invasion, and tumorigenesis, while its overexpression confers TMZ resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, STC1 activates NF‐κB signaling to drive EMT, thereby synchronizing metastatic potential with therapy tolerance. Crucially, NF‐κB inhibition reverses STC1‐mediated EMT and resensitizes GBM cells to TMZ. Our work delineates STC1 as a master regulator coupling NF‐κB‐driven EMT to TMZ resistance, providing a therapeutic nexus to dismantle GBM resilience. By transcending singular resistance mechanisms, this STC1‐NF‐κB‐EMT axis offers a multifaceted target to improve therapeutic outcomes in this recalcitrant malignancy. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Tissue Samples All the tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were from GBM patients treated in The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China. All glioblastoma tissue samples were obtained with the approval of the Scientific Ethics Committee at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University (approve no. 2021–695). Furthermore, patients provided written consent to participate in the study and to allow their samples to be used for research purposes. 2.2 Bioinformatics Analysis The GSE151680 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo p 2 p 2.3 Construction of the Prognostic Model and Predictive Performance Evaluation The prognostic model was conducted through Cox regression analysis using the survival R package, in which the top 20 prognosis‐related risk genes were presented and further evaluated by the Brier score value and the SHapley Additive exPlanations value (SHAP). These GBM samples were divided into two groups according to the overall survival using the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm, in which the filtered prognostic risk genes were used to construct the model. Then, the DEGs between the two groups were calculated by the limma package. 2.4 Immunohistochemistry ( IHC The tumor tissues of GBM were fixed using formalin solution and prepared into sections using paraffin‐embedded tissues. The tissues were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated with mouse anti‐STC1 antibody (1:500, ab239518, USA) at 4°C overnight. Then, the samples were incubated with secondary antibodies at 37°C for 3 h, and color development was performed using DAB solution. Subsequently, the tissues were restrained using hematoxylin, and the results were observed by microscope. 2.5 Cell Culture The GBM cell lines (U87, LN229, and A172) and normal human astrocyte (NHA) cell line from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's media (DMEM, Gibco, China) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO 2 2.6 Cell Transfection and Treatment The lentivirus overexpressing/knockdown STC1 was designed and constructed by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). GBM cells in the logarithmic growth phase were trypsinized and made into single‐cell suspensions. Added the transfection reagents Lipofectamine 2000 (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) and plasmids into the medium after the cells had grown to 80% confluence, followed by the transfection efficiency was detected. Then, cells were treated with TMZ. 2.7  qRT PCR Total RNA was extracted from GBM cell lines and tissues, and subsequently, the cDNA was obtained using the PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara, Kusatsu, Japan). Then, cDNA was used as a template for PCR amplification.

Each protein sample was subjected to 10% SDS‐PAGE. The protein was transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, MA, USA), and then the membranes were incubated with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. Following this, the PVDF membrane was washed three times with TBST (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and incubated with HRP‐conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) for 1 h at 37°C. The Amersham ECL Western Blot System (Cytiva) was applied to visualize the protein expression levels of each sample, using GAPDH as the loading control. The following antibodies were used: primary antibodies against STC1 (1:2000, ab239518, USA), E‐cadherin (1:1000, ab314063, USA), N‐cadherin (1:1000, ab76011, USA), Occludin (1:2000, ab216327, USA), Snail1 (1:1000, ab31787, USA), Vimentin (1:1000, ab92547, USA), IKKα (1:1000, ab32041, USA), P‐IKKα (1:1000, ab17943, USA), IκBα (1:1000, ab32518, USA), p65 (1:1000, ab32536, USA), and GAPDH (1:5000, ab8245, USA). Additionally, Anti‐Rabbit IgG and Anti‐Mouse‐IgG were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (cat. no. #7074 and #7076, respectively). 2.9  EdU The EdU assay kit (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) was utilized to conduct EdU staining. Cells were cultured in the medium containing EdU solution. Two hours later, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were treated with 0.5% Triton X‐100 in PBS solution and stained with iF555 and Hoechst 33342. The stained cells were observed using a fluorescence microscope. 2.10  CCK The GBM cells were inoculated into 96‐well plates, and then the appropriate amount of CCK‐8 reagent (Dojindo Chemical Laboratory, Kumamoto, Japan) was added to each well. The plates were incubated in an incubator to fully react the cells with the CCK‐8 reagent. The OD values were measured at 450 nm. 2.11 Wound Healing Assay The GBM cells in the logarithmic growth phase were digested into single‐cell suspensions and inoculated into a 6‐well plate. Then, we incubated the cells to a monolayer‐fused state and used a sterile lance tip to create a linear scratch on the cell monolayer. PBS buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) was used to wash the cells to remove cell debris and residue shed during the scratching process. The treated plate was placed in an incubator and continued to culture. The changes in the scratched area were observed using an inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and the migration of the cells was recorded. 2.12 Transwell Assay GBM cells were cultured to the logarithmic growth phase, digested, centrifuged, and resuspended in a serum‐free medium. The appropriate amount of cell suspension was added to the upper chamber of the transwell, and serum‐containing medium was added to the lower chamber. Twenty‐four hours later, the transwell was removed, and the cells were fixed and stained using crystal violet (Merck, MA, USA). The GBM cells that migrated to the lower chamber were observed and counted under the microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA). 2.13 Colony Formation Assay The monolayer cells in the logarithmic growth phase were obtained to count the cells. After that, the GBM cells were inoculated into 6‐well plates at 200 cells per well and incubated in an incubator for 2 weeks. At the end of the specified incubation period, the formation of colonies was observed under a microscope, and the number of colonies formed in each well was recorded. 2.14 Intracranial Xenograft Tumor Model Animals in this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine, Xi'an Jiaotong University (approval no. 2021‐695). All the nude mice in this study were chosen randomly. Six‐week‐old female nude mice were used for the intracranial xenograft tumor model. The U87 or LN229 cells transduced with or without lentivirus (1 × 10 5 2.15 Enrichment Analysis The expression profiles of GBM samples in the TCGA database were divided into two groups based on the expression of STC1. The DEGs between the two groups were identified using “limma” package, and then were conducted the enrichment analysis was conducted. GO and KEGG analyses were used to investigate STC1‐related candidate pathways, while GSEA analysis was used as validation. 2.16 Statistical Analysis To ensure the reliability of the results, all experiments were replicated across a minimum of three distinct groups. When comparing just two groups, we relied on the t p 3 Results 3.1 Identification of EDGs Associated With TMZ GBM The data from the GEO database were analyzed to screen DEGs which were correlated to TMZ resistance in U87 and U251 naïve or TMZ‐resistant cell lines using the limma software package and visualized using a volcano graph (Figure 1A,B 1C 1D,E 1F 1G 1H 1I p FIGURE 1 The differential expression genes (DEGs) in GSE151680 p 3.2 Elevated STC1 GBM The limma package was used to analyze the DEGs between the two groups of GBM patients with different prognoses mentioned above.

As well as STC1 was for study. Then, we validated STC1 expression in different databases. The results showed that STC1 was upregulated in GBM tissues and significantly associated with poor prognosis in GBM patients. Besides, the expression pattern of STC1 in GBM cell lines was consistent with the database. STC1 protein is initially discovered in fish, primarily produced by stannous bodies, and it is involved in regulating calcium/phosphorus balance [ 15 32 33 34 35 36 37 As we all know, EMT is considered to be the essential process in tumor cell metastasis and drug resistance [ 38 39 40 41 36 42 The results of GO, KEGG, and GSEA analysis also suggested that STC1 was enriched in the NF‐κB pathway. NF‐κB is present in almost all animal cells and responds to a wide range of stressors, including cytokines, radiation, heavy metals, and viruses [ 43 44 45 18 46 5 Conclusion In conclusion, the current study confirmed that STC1 promoted the malignant biological behavior of GBM cells through the EMT and NF‐κB pathway, implying STC1 was an attractive target for the development of new therapeutic strategies for GBM.
