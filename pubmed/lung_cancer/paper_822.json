Myeloid sarcoma (MS) is an uncommon solid extramedullary tumor composed of malignant myeloid blasts that can be located in various tissues. It is often associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but it can also be found in patients suffering from myeloproliferative disorders or myelodysplastic syndrome. Despite the lack of consensus on the best treatment for MS, this tumor is acknowledged to be radiosensitive. We report the case of a 33-year-old female diagnosed with MS involving the breast treated with salvage radiation, after having initially undergone systemic chemotherapy and an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. The purpose of this report is to discuss the significant impact of local radiotherapy in patients suffering from this unique condition.

The tumor is composed of malignant immature white blood cells of myeloid lineage. It often occurs with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or can present at the time of AML relapse. However, it can be diagnosed independent of bone marrow infiltration or circulating leukemia cells [ 1 5 1 2 3 5 2 6 7 1 5 Here, we report a case of MS localized to the breast without evidence of circulating leukemia cell or bone marrow infiltration, responding favorably to salvage local RT after initially being treated with standard AML treatment including multi-agent chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant. Case Report A previously well 33-year-old female, with no relevant past medical history, presented in October 2013 with a lump in her right breast. The lesion was biopsied, and the morphology and immunochemistry performed revealed an MS, most often associated with a form of AML. However, further investigations such as peripheral blood count, blood and bone marrow morphology were normal, indicating no evidence of AML. Subsequently, the patient underwent two cycles of chemotherapy which she tolerated well; the first, “7 + 3”, consisted of cytarabine (araC) and daunomycin, and two cycles of high-dose cytarabine (HDAC). The breast mass quickly resolved after the first cycle of chemotherapy. After initial induction chemotherapy, the patient was reviewed by several hematologists at two separate tertiary care hospitals. The patient, despite being in clinical remission, was keen for aggressive upfront management because of the fear of relapse and requested further treatment similar to the management of AML. Therefore, in May 2014, the patient underwent a matched unrelated donor (MUD) allogeneic stem cell transplant following a traditional myeloablative busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and anti-thymocyte globulin (BuCyATG) conditioning regimen. Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of traditional tacrolimus and a short course of methotrexate. The transplant was well tolerated, and no major complications were encountered. She did not develop GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppressive therapy and was quickly tapered off tacrolimus. In September 2014, she noticed another lump in her right breast, and ultrasound imaging confirmed a mass measuring 1.6 × 1.1 cm mass. Repeat biopsy confirmed recurrent MS at the site of original disease. She was referred for localized RT and underwent salvage treatment in November 2014. The entire right breast was treated to a cumulative dose of 25 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks, using a conformal RT technique with medial and lateral breast tangents. She tolerated her RT well, with no significant toxicity. She is now more than 10 years post-completion of salvage radiation, with no evidence of local recurrence or systemic relapse. Discussion MS, commonly referred to as GS in the published literature, is a rare tumor located outside of the bone marrow and composed of immature myeloid cells [ 1 5 8 9 chloros 10 1 3 5 11 1 5 MS presenting as a breast mass and only involving the breast is quite rare, and therefore the prognosis and natural history are not well defined. Also, there are no standard treatment guidelines for the management of localized MS of the breast [ 2 4 1 5 3 7 Table 1 2 4 12 21 Table 1 Recent Case Reports of Breast Myeloid Sarcoma (2014 - 2025): Clinical, Imaging, and Treatment Features References Patient age (yrs)/gender Presentation/symptoms Past hematologic disease Imaging findings Histopathology/IHC Systemic/surgical treatment Radiotherapy Outcome/follow-up Goncalves et al, 2014 [ 4 35/F Tender left breast nodule, 25 mm, upper outer quadrant N/A US/mammography: solid heterogeneous nodule about 22 mm, small ipsilateral axillary LN;

RT can play an important role in local disease control, palliation of symptoms and potentially increasing overall survival in some patients. Further, MS is known to be radiosensitive, and the successful use of low-dose RT (20 - 30 Gy with conventional fractionation) has been reported. Yet, specific total dose and fractionation have not been standardized [ 1 3 5 11 22 24 22 22 Similarly, the efficacy of low-dose RT on chloroma patients was demonstrated by Bakst et al [ 3 3 Consistent with the other studies, Chen et al [ 5 5 23 Although optimal dose remains uncertain, Bakst e al [ 11 11 While RT remains an effective local treatment for breast MS, particularly in achieving durable remission as highlighted in the current case, systemic management of residual disease or relapse remains challenging. In this context, emerging targeted therapies are gaining interest. Lessi et al [ 25 FLT3 26 The case presented in the current study is a 33-year-old female diagnosed with a recurrent MS at the site of original disease in the right breast. She was treated with 25 Gy in 10 fractions over the course of 2 weeks, a dose corresponding to the recommendations in the literature. She tolerated her RT well and has now been in CR of her disease for more than 8 years. Conclusions There is currently no consensus in the treatment guidelines for MS, whether it is isolated or accompanying a hematological neoplasia. Treatment modalities include systemic therapy with chemotherapy, and local therapy with surgical excision and/or RT. The benefit of RT on disease- or progression-free survival has not been clearly described in the literature. However, low-dose RT between 20 and 30 Gy with conventional fractionation provides excellent local control and palliation of symptoms with minimal toxicity. MS of the breast is a rare entity and often associated with a poor prognosis. Our case, in accordance with the literature, illustrates the efficacy of low-dose RT in treating a patient with relapsed MS of the breast without evidence of circulating leukemia cell or bone marrow infiltration. The salvage treatment of 25 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks resulted in a lasting local remission with minimal toxicity. Future prospective studies or larger case series are needed to validate the efficacity of RT and optimize treatment strategies for isolated breast MS.
