This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/404336-hidden-contribution-of-severe-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-to-recurrent-pneumonia-in-an-octogenarian-with-prior-gastrectomy We report the case of an 88-year-old man with a history of distal gastrectomy who developed recurrent episodes of pneumonia within short intervals despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. He presented with fever and increased sputum production only two days after discharge from a prior pneumonia admission. His medical history included Alzheimer’s disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and permanent atrial fibrillation. On admission, he was febrile and hypoxemic, with fine crackles on chest auscultation and new infiltrates on radiography and computed tomography. Despite the absence of overt swallowing dysfunction, the repeated recurrence prompted further evaluation. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed persistent Los Angeles grade C gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) despite proton pump inhibitor therapy. The patient also reported lying down immediately after meals, suggesting nocturnal and postprandial microaspiration as a key mechanism. Antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone improved the pulmonary infiltrates, and he was discharged with reinforced reflux precautions and continued acid suppression therapy. Following discharge, he adhered to these lifestyle modifications and has not required readmission for pneumonia. This case highlights GERD as an underrecognized cause of recurrent pneumonia in elderly patients without obvious dysphagia. A comprehensive evaluation for GERD is crucial in managing unexplained recurrent pneumonia, particularly in patients with dementia, prior gastric surgery, or other aspiration risk factors. 80 and over aged aspiration pneumonia bacterial dementia gastrectomy gastroesophageal reflux pneumonia pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition characterized by the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, most commonly presenting with symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation [ 1 2 3 Persistent GERD may not only lead to esophageal complications but can also contribute to extra-esophageal manifestations, including chronic cough and recurrent respiratory symptoms [ 4 5 Here, we report the case of an 88-year-old man with a history of distal gastrectomy who experienced recurrent pneumonia within a short period. Despite no apparent swallowing impairment on clinical examination, severe GERD was identified by upper endoscopy and confirmed as the primary cause of microaspiration leading to recurrent pneumonia, as supported by aspiration studies (e.g., videofluoroscopic swallowing study or scintigraphy). To our knowledge, GERD-induced pneumonia in an independent, very elderly patient without dysphagia is uncommon. This case highlights the importance of considering GERD as an underlying cause of recurrent pneumonia in older adults, particularly those with a history of gastric surgery. Case presentation An 88-year-old man was referred to a rural hospital with fever. He had been discharged just two days earlier after treatment for pneumonia with ceftriaxone 2g/day for a week. On the day of presentation, he developed fever accompanied by increased sputum production and abnormal breath sounds, prompting his primary physician to suspect recurrent pneumonia and refer him to our facility. His medical history included Alzheimer’s disease, dilated cardiomyopathy, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and permanent atrial fibrillation. Notably, he had undergone a distal gastrectomy with Billroth-I reconstruction for a gastric ulcer approximately 40 years earlier. Over the past year, he had been admitted eight times for bacterial pneumonia. His long-term medications included edoxaban 15 mg, esomeprazole 20 mg, sennoside 12 mg, carvedilol 10 mg, and magnesium oxide 990 mg daily. On arrival, he was alert and fully oriented. His vital signs were as follows: body temperature, 39.2 °C; blood pressure, 157/92 mmHg; heart rate, 100 beats/min; respiratory rate, 22 breaths/min; and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO₂), 91% on room air. Chest auscultation revealed fine late-inspiratory crackles in the right lung field and inspiratory crackles throughout the left lung field. There was no evidence of jugular venous distension, weight gain, or peripheral edema suggestive of heart failure. Laboratory tests revealed mild anemia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (Table 1 Table 1 Initial laboratory data of the patient Abbreviations: CRP, C-reactive protein; FiO₂, fraction of inspired oxygen; PCO₂, partial pressure of carbon dioxide; PO₂, partial pressure of oxygen; HCO₃⁻, bicarbonate; BE, base excess; cLac, lactate concentration Laboratory reference ranges may vary slightly by institution.

Empirical antibiotic therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone of 2 g/day was initiated on hospital day 1. On day 3 of admission, a videofluoroscopic swallowing examination (VE) was performed, confirming no dysfunction of swallowing. Additionally, bedside aspiration tests and assessment by the Speech and Language Therapy (SLT) team revealed no abnormalities. Given the unusually short interval between the previous pneumonia episode and the current relapse, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed on hospital day 5 for further evaluation. The endoscopy revealed persistent severe GERD, classified as Los Angeles grade C, despite ongoing proton pump inhibitor therapy (Figure 3 Figure 3 Endoscopy revealing persistent severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, classified as Los Angeles grade C, despite ongoing proton pump inhibitor therapy (white arrows) Notably, the patient reported that he frequently lay down immediately after meals. Taken together, microaspiration secondary to GERD was strongly suspected as the underlying cause of recurrent pneumonia. Follow-up chest radiography demonstrated significant resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates by hospital day 7, at which point ceftriaxone therapy was discontinued (Figure 4 Figure 4 Follow-up chest radiography demonstrating significant resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates by hospital day 7 The patient was discharged home in stable condition on hospital day 10 with reinforced instructions regarding postprandial posture modification and continued acid suppression therapy. To prevent reflux, he was instructed to remain seated for at least two hours after meals, which he adhered to consistently. Since then, he has not required any further hospitalizations for pneumonia. Discussion Ryu et al. reported that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was present in 32 of 52 patients (62%) with biopsy-proven aspiration pneumonia, suggesting that GERD frequently coexists with aspiration-related pulmonary infections [ 6 7 7 Beyond pneumonia, GERD has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory conditions such as bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ 8 Although GERD has been identified as an independent risk factor for pneumonia, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.48 (95% confidence interval: 1.31-1.67) [ 9 10 In most clinical scenarios, pneumonia improves promptly with appropriate antibiotic therapy, leaving little impetus for further investigation into underlying reflux [ 11 This case emphasizes that GERD should remain a differential consideration in elderly patients with unexplained recurrent pneumonia, particularly in those with a history of gastric surgery, dementia, or other aspiration risk factors [ 12 13 14 General physicians should be vigilant for occult aspiration pneumonia in older patients without new symptoms. In rural contexts, as societies age, an increasing number of older patients visit rural general hospitals, presenting with various vague symptoms that cause diagnostic difficulties [ 15 16 17 Conclusions We report a rare case in which GERD, secondary to distal gastrectomy, was identified as the principal cause of recurrent pneumonia via microaspiration in a super-elderly patient. This case highlights the importance of evaluating not only swallowing dysfunction but also GERD in elderly patients with repeated episodes of pneumonia. Comprehensive GERD management, including lifestyle modification and optimized pharmacologic therapy, may reduce pneumonia recurrence. Particular attention should be given to patients with a history of upper gastrointestinal surgery, as they are at increased risk of severe reflux and its respiratory complications.
