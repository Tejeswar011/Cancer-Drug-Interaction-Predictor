Summary Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents about 90% of kidney cancers, with 30%–40% of patients developing metastatic disease despite current treatments. Conventional chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T therapy targeting CD70 shows promise but faces challenges due to its autologous, personalized nature.

Clinical responses have been modest, likely due to the inherent challenges posed by solid tumors, including antigen heterogeneity and a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). 9 , 10 , 11 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 9 , 10 , 16 Recent advances in allogeneic cell therapies offer encouraging prospects. For instance, CD70-directed CAR-engineered natural killer (CAR70-NK) cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have demonstrated efficacy across various malignancies including RCC while also eliminating CD70-expressing alloreactive T cells. 17 17 17 5 , 18 , 19 , 20 To address these challenges, we employed our previously established hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) gene engineering technology and a clinically guided culture method to generate allogeneic CD70-directed CAR-engineered invariant natural killer T ( Allo 21 in vitro in vivo Allo Allo Results Profiling of primary RCC patient samples reveals the therapeutic opportunities for CAR-NKT cell therapy To characterize RCC and identify optimal therapeutic strategies, we performed flow cytometry analyses on 15 primary RCC patient-derived tumor samples ( Figure 1 Table S1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Biomarker profiling of primary RCC patient samples reveals therapeutic potential for CAR-NKT cell treatment (A) Experiment design to profile primary RCC patient tumor samples using flow cytometry. 15 RCC primary samples were included for analyses.

Tissue clearing and immunostaining were performed using the CUBIC (clear, unobstructed brain/body imaging cocktails and computational analysis) protocol. 97 , 98 , 99 Subsequently, samples were washed in PBS with gentle shaking at room temperature three times: for 3 h for the first two washes and overnight for the third. RCC tumor cells (RCC#22-FG) were genetically labeled with internal GFP. For immunolabeling of T cells, samples were incubated with an APC-conjugated anti-human CD3 antibody (BioLegend, cat no. 317318; 1:20 dilution) in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100. After staining, samples were again washed in PBS with gentle shaking at room temperature three times: for 3 h for the first two washes and overnight for the third. Post-staining fixation was performed in 1% formaldehyde at 4°C for 24 h, followed by an additional incubation at 37°C for 1 h. After fixation, samples were washed again in PBS with gentle shaking at room temperature three times: for 3 h for the first two washes and overnight for the third. Samples were then incubated in 50% CUBIC-R+(M) reagent (TCI, T3741) at room temperature for 2 days, followed by incubation in 100% CUBIC-R+(M) at room temperature for 4 days, with the reagent refreshed on days 1 and 2. Finally, samples were immersed in CUBIC mounting solution (TCI, M3294; refractive index = 1.520) for imaging. Imaging was conducted using a custom-built refractive index–corrected light-sheet fluorescence microscope (rc-LSFM). GFP-labeled tumor cells were imaged using a 473 nm laser with a 500/40 nm emission filter. APC-labeled T cells were imaged using a 589 nm laser and a 641/75 nm emission filter. Autofluorescence was captured using a 532 nm laser and the same 641/75 nm emission filter. In vivo BLI was conducted using the Spectral Advanced Molecular Imaging (AMI) HTX system (Spectral Instrument Imaging). Live animal images were captured 5 min after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of D-Luciferin, with doses of 1 mg/mouse for tumor cell (e.g., 786- O Allo In vivo Experimental design is shown in Figure 4 5 100 Allo 6 + 6 + In vivo Experimental design is shown in Figure S4 5 Allo 6 + In vivo Experimental design is shown in Figure 5 5 Allo 6 + 6 + In vivo O Experimental design is shown in Figure 5 O 5 Allo 6 + 6 + In vivo O CD70−/− Experimental design is shown in Figure 5 O CD70−/− 5 Allo 6 + 6 + In vivo Experimental design is shown in Figure 6 6 Allo 6 + 6 + In vivo Experimental design is shown in Figure 7 6 Allo 6 6 In vivo Experimental design is shown in Figure S7 O 6 Allo 6 + 6 + In vivo Experimental design is shown in Figure S7 O 6 + Allo 6 + 6 + + In vivo Experimental design is shown in Figure S7 Allo 6 + 6 + On Day 120, various mouse tissues were collected and analyzed by the UCLA Pathology Core.

Data were presented as pathologist’s scores of individual mouse tissues ( n Quantification and statistical analysis Graphpad Prism 9 software (Graphpad) was used for statistical data analysis. Student’s two-tailed t test was used for pairwise comparisons. Ordinary 1-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s or Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was used for multiple comparisons. Log rank (Mantel-Cox) test adjusted for multiple comparisons was used for Meier survival curves analysis. Data are presented as the mean ± SEM, unless otherwise indicated. In all figures and figure legends, “n” represents the number of samples or animals used in the indicated experiments. A p References 1 Hsieh J.J. Purdue M.P. Signoretti S. Swanton C. Albiges L.
