Among the various organs affected, the gut is particularly sensitive to radiation-induced damage, leading to conditions such as radiation-induced intestinal damage (RIID). Recent studies have emphasized the critical role of gut microbiota and its metabolites in mitigating radiation-induced injury. This review discusses the effects of IR on the mammalian and human gut microbiota. We examine the dynamics of gut microbiota composition during and after irradiation, and emphasize the protective role of the gut flora and the metabolites in the pathophysiological mechanisms exhibited during radiation injury. In addition, this article investigates how specific metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids and indole derivatives, may contribute to the mitigation of inflammation and promotion of gut barrier integrity. In addition, various therapeutic strategies based on modulating the gut microbiota, such as probiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, are discussed to understand their potential to prevent or mitigate RIID. Understanding the interactions between IR, gut microbiota and their metabolites provides new avenues for developing innovative therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes during and after radiotherapy. Future research directions could focus on optimizing microbiota-based therapies and exploring the role of diet and lifestyle in enhancing intestinal health during irradiation. ionizing radiation intestinal dysbiosis intestinal microbiota metabolites radiation-induced intestinal damage irradiation protection measures Central Guidance on Local Science and Technology Development Fund of Sichuan Province No. 2024ZYD0194 Open Project Program of Panxi Crops Research and Utilization Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province No. SZKF202309 Science and Technology Plan Project of Chengdu Longquanyi District No. 2024LQRD0045 This research was funded by Central Guidance on Local Science and Technology Development Fund of Sichuan Province, No. 2024ZYD0194; Open Project Program of Panxi Crops Research and Utilization Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, No. SZKF202309; Science and Technology Plan Project of Chengdu Longquanyi District, No. 2024LQRD0045. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction With the widespread use of ionizing radiation (IR) in research, industry, homeland security, and modern medicine, it has become virtually unavoidable for humans to be exposed to low doses of artificial IR on a daily basis [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 The gut microbiota is inseparably associated with gut health. The gut microbiota forms a symbiotic association with the host, mainly through its metabolites, maintaining a dynamic balance between the pathological and physiological processes of the host. But any alteration to this balance leads to ecological disorders [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 A number of technological and biological strategies have been developed to prevent and mitigate radiation damage to the gut, such as prophylactic surgical techniques, endoscopic treatments, topical treatments, anti-inflammatory drugs, and biological, chemical, and pharmacological therapies [ 14 15 16 17 18 Therefore, elucidating the link between IR, the gut microbiota and its metabolites is essential for the development of radiation injury-related preventive therapies. In this review, we will discuss the effects of IR on the gut microbiota of mammals and humans and the link between the gut microbiota and ionizing radiation-induced injuries. We hope to emphasize the protective role of the gut flora and their metabolites in the pathophysiological mechanisms manifested during radiation injury. The advantages and efficacy of modulating the gut microbiota are also discussed, and relevant therapies based on the gut flora and its metabolites are outlined. Finally, we outline the future directions of this approach for the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced injury. This study aims to clarify the potential of the gut flora and its metabolites and to explore new avenues of research and preventive therapeutic strategies for GI injuries induced by radiation exposure. 2. The Role of the Gut Microbiota in Human Health The human gut is a remarkably complex and diverse microecosystem, home to trillions of microorganisms that play essential roles in maintaining host health [ 19 20 21 The gut microbiota plays an important role in material metabolism, biological barriers, immune regulation and host defense [ 22 23 24 25 21 26 27 Recent studies have highlighted the profound impact of gut microbiota on host health, particularly in relation to dysbiosis—a state of microbial imbalance [ 28 29 30 Enterobacteriaceae 31 Moreover, the microbial transformation of certain substances has emerged as a key metabolic marker in the progression of various diseases [ 32 27 33 34 3. Radiation-Induced Intestinal Damage The gut is both a highly radiosensitive and an important dose-limiting organ. So radiation therapy for tumors of the abdominal, pelvic, and colorectal systems will typically develop RIID, leading to side effects that include vomiting, weight loss, anorexia, dehydration, diarrhea, and infections [ 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 3.1. Cellular Damage and Inflammation IR causes damage at the cellular level mainly by inducing DNA breaks, leading to cell death or dysfunction [ 39 43 40 44 45 46 The inflammatory response induced by radiation injury leads to the upregulation of various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which play a key role in amplifying the inflammatory response and recruiting immune cells to the site of injury [ 40 47 48 49 50 51 52 3.2. Vascular Injury with Hypoxia and Fibrosis IR severely damages the microvascular system within the intestinal tissues, injuring endothelial cells and destroying the integrity of the vascular barrier, leading to increased vascular permeability and reduced blood flow [ 53 54 55 56 40 57 58 3.3. Chronic Radiation-Induced Intestinal Damage While most epithelial and microvascular injuries occur during the acute phase of irradiation, unresolved epithelial barrier defects coupled with progressive vascular injury and fibrosis can evolve into chronic radiation-induced intestinal damage (RIID). Clinically, chronic RIID typically manifests after a latency of ≥90 days—often months to years—following radiotherapy, presenting with persistent diarrhea, malabsorption, abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, strictures, fistulae, and even obstruction, with substantial detriments to quality of life [ 59 60 40 61 62 Pathobiologically, chronic RIID is characterized by sustained endothelial dysfunction, vascular sclerosis, tissue hypoperfusion/hypoxia, and progressive fibrosis, culminating in mural thickening and mechanical stiffness [ 63 64 65 66 67 The natural history of chronic RIID reflects this multicellular cascade: (i) vascular rarefaction and barrier failure sustain ischemia and low-grade inflammation [ 65 68 69 4. Interaction Between Gut Microbiota, Its Metabolites and Radiological Bowel Injury 4.1. Changes in Gut Microbiota and Its Metabolites After Radiotherapy In a healthy state, the composition and species of the gut microbiota remain in a relatively stable state, and the main phyla of the gut microbiota are Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria Actinobacteria Fusobacteria Firmicutes Bacteroidetes 70 71 Table 1 7 72 73 Analysis of changes in gut microbial communities based on high-throughput sequencing techniques (marker gene sequencing and whole-genome shotgun metagenomics) revealed that changes in gut flora and their metabolites were not constant after radiation, which may be related to radiation duration, radiation level, radiation type and experimental subjects [ 52 80 81 Table 2 As can be seen from Table 1 Bacteroidetes Firmicutes Helicobacter Clostridium 12 72 81 82 83 84 85 4.2. The Role of Gut Microbiota and Its Metabolites in Radiation-Induced Intestinal Damage The interactions between IR, host response and the gut microbiota are complex, and the exact underlying mechanisms are still under investigation [ 86 13 82 4.2.1. Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFAs) SCFAs such as acetate (C2), propionate (C3), and butyrate (C4) are metabolites of intestinal microorganisms that act as signaling molecules to strengthen the intestinal barrier and modulate immunomodulatory functions [ 52 The Toll-like receptor (TLR) affects the activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, which, together with the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6), ultimately leads to the development of a pro-inflammatory response in ionizing radiation-induced epithelial injury [ 87 88 85 89 90 C4 has been shown to support the integrity of the intestinal barrier, promote the differentiation of colonic regulatory T cells, and exert anti-inflammatory effects [ 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 4.2.2. Indoles and Their Derivatives Indole or indole derivatives produced by tryptophan metabolism in Escherichia coli 98 99 100 Indole and its derivatives can enhance the integrity of the intestinal barrier, thereby mitigating RIID [ 101 102 103 104 101 105 101 106 107 108 109 IPA protects against gastrointestinal toxicity by preserving the intestinal bacterial conformation and small intestinal protein profile of radiation-challenged hosts while activating intestinal PXR/ACBP signaling, preventing radiation-associated hematopoietic syndromes and gastrointestinal syndromes without accelerating tumor growth [ 102 103 110 4.2.3. Other Intestinal Microbiota Metabolites In addition to short-chain fatty acids and indoles and their derivatives, a number of intestinal microbial metabolites can likewise mitigate IRRD. The gut flora transforms ellagitanninin in pomegranates, strawberries, and walnuts into urolithin A (UroA), which reduces radiation damage to the gut by decreasing p53 expression, inhibiting caspase 8 and caspase 3 overexpression, and remodeling the gut microbiota to improve the maintenance of gut homeostasis and regeneration. PGF2α activates the FP/MAPK/NF-κB axis to promote cell proliferation and inhibit apoptosis with radiation stress, counteracts infrared-induced alveolar structural damage and collagen accumulation, and reduces post-irradiation pro-inflammatory factors (TGF-β1, IL-1β, and TNF-α), preventing and mitigating IR injury [ 111 112 5. Therapeutics Based on Gut Microbiota and Its Metabolites Because of medical exposures and radiological and nuclear public health emergencies, the development of safer and more effective protection strategies to prevent and treat IR damage to humans has become critical. The following section describes the safety and efficacy of widely used strategies for protection against radiation toxicity: probiotics and bacterial supplements, antibiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation and so on ( Figure 1 5.1. Advantages of Gut Microbes and Their Metabolites in Mitigating Radiation Damage Many technological and biological strategies are currently being developed to prevent and mitigate radiation damage to the gut, such as prophylactic surgical techniques, endoscopic treatments, topical treatments, anti-inflammatory drugs, and biological, chemical, and pharmacological therapies [ 14 113 5.2. Probiotics and Bacterial Supplementation Probiotics are a group of active microorganisms that colonize the gut, restore the balance of the gut microbiota, and support overall health by modulating the immune response and maintaining the integrity of the gut, mainly including Lactobacillus Clostridium casei Bifidobacterium Actinomyces Lactobacillus acidophilus 114 115 116 Lactobacillus 117 Lactobacillus reuteri Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lactobacillus delbrueckii 118 Lactobacillus rhamnosus Bifidobacterium 119 120 Lactobacillus acidophilus Bifidobacterium longum 121 A new generation of probiotics, including bacterial strains such as Akermansia muciniphila Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 122 123 124 125 126 Combinations of probiotics have been used safely and extensively in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. The mixtures of prebiotics (nondigestible food ingredients that selectively stimulate the growth or activity of beneficial gut microorganisms, such as oligosaccharides, inulin, and resistant starches) and probiotics (oligogalactose, L. acidophilus Lactobacillus casei 37 127 5.3. Antibiotics Antibiotics, which treat individuals by killing and inhibiting pathogenic bacteria in their bodies, have a major impact on the restoration of the gut microbiota and have long been used to control infections in patients with compromised immune systems [ 128 129 130 9 131 132 133 133 134 135 Although antibiotics are essential for the treatment of ionizing radiation-induced dysbiosis and the prevention of bacterial infections, they may also have an indirect effect on the composition of the gut microbiota in different individuals and may instead promote an inflammatory response [ 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 In conclusion, antibiotics are effective against intestinal bacterial infections caused by abdominal radiation, but they should be applied in a standardized manner in order to avoid the emergence of a resistance crisis. 5.4. Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) involves extracting functional bacteria from the feces of healthy individuals through procedures such as centrifugal filtration and transplanting them into the gastrointestinal tract of a patient to restore balance to the dysbiotic intestinal microbiota for therapeutic purposes [ 146 147 148 149 150 Clostridioides difficile Xiao et al. observed higher levels of microbial-derived IPA in the feces of irradiated mice subjected to FMT, which reduced chronic inflammation, lowered the risk of hematopoietic organ damage and bone marrow suppression, and improved gastrointestinal function and epithelial integrity [ 102 151 151 All of the above studies suggest that FMT is a promising treatment for modifying microbial communities. However, there are risks associated with the procedure, including the potential spread of infectious agents and the lack of standardized protocols for donor selection, screening and fecal disposal [ 152 153 5.5. Other Protection Strategies The host and diet can control and influence the growth of the gut flora, which has been established as a method of preventing and mitigating IR-induced injury by remodeling IR-induced dysbiosis of the gut bacterial ecology. Natural herbs and their active ingredients can inhibit radiation-induced tissue damage and promote repair. And its mechanism of action is multi-targeted, multi-layered and, most importantly, with minimal side effects [ 154 155 156 157 158 These therapies provide good concepts for protection and repair of radiation damage ( Table 3 6. Conclusions and Future Directions RIID is a complex and challenging condition that has a significant impact on patients undergoing radiotherapy. Understanding the mechanisms, risk factors, and clinical manifestations of RIID is essential for developing effective management and prevention strategies. IR causes radiation enteritis by disrupting the immune system, disrupting the balance of the intestinal microbiota, and damaging the intestinal and vascular endothelium. The gut flora plays a crucial role in the etiology and treatment of radiation-induced injuries. As irradiation promotes the proliferation of harmful gut microbes, increasing the risk of intestinal diseases, beneficial bacteria that naturally inhabit the gut can directly affect the intestinal epithelium or modulate the intestinal immune system, thereby providing radiation protection. This review emphasizes the key role and mechanisms of the gut microbiota and its metabolites, as well as the complex interactions between the microbiota and radiation potency and injury, providing promising therapeutic avenues—microbiota-based therapies such as probiotics, FMT, antibiotics, and others—which have been discussed as a potential strategy for controlling radiation-induced injury. However, at the same time, RIID can be further exacerbated by reductions in probiotic populations and expression of their metabolites, etc. Despite the challenges, the potential benefits of microbiota-based therapies are substantial. Future research should focus on elucidating the specific mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influences radiation injury, optimizing therapeutic strategies. By deepening our understanding of the gut microbiota and its metabolites, we can develop innovative therapeutic approaches to prevent and manage radiation-induced injury, thereby improving patient outcomes and quality of life.
