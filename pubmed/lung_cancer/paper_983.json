See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a cornerstone procedure for the diagnosis and management of pancreatic and hepatobiliary diseases. Although its diagnostic role has been increasingly supplanted by noninvasive imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, the therapeutic applications of ERCP have continued to expand. ERCP is widely used and has a generally favorable safety profile. However, it is important to recognize expected post-procedural imaging findings and serious complications that can arise. The increasing complexity of therapeutic interventions and the growing volume of procedures have led to a higher incidence of complications that often present with overlapping clinical and laboratory features, underscoring the critical role of imaging in differential diagnosis. This review focused on the typical normal ERCP findings and the imaging characteristics of common complications, including pancreatitis, bleeding, ERCP-related infections, perforations, and stent-related complications. Computed tomography (CT) is particularly valuable in timely recognition, management, and surgical decision-making for these complications. Furthermore, MRI offers a radiation-free alternative for managing complications in selected patients. Therefore, radiological modalities, particularly CT and MRI, are critical tools for the rapid diagnosis, management, and surgical decision-making processes for post-ERCP complications.

Additionally, the figures present demonstrative cases from the authors’ institutions and include relevant clinical information and radiological findings. IMAGING STRATEGIES FOLLOWING ERCP: INDICATIONS AND PROTOCOL RECOMMENDATIONS Post-ERCP imaging is typically guided by a combination of clinical signs observed during the procedure and subsequent laboratory findings. Common indications for imaging include repeated or difficult cannulation, suspected duodenal perforation, acute or exacerbating abdominal pain, signs of fever or cardiovascular instability, declining hemoglobin levels, and elevated markers such as serum amylase, lipase, leukocyte count, and other acute phase reactants. CT is preferred for the initial assessment because of its speed and availability. However, both ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be utilized in specific clinical scenarios[ 10 11 Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is the preferred imaging technique for assessing acute post-ERCP complications, due to its ability to evaluate intraabdominal and retroperitoneal structures rapidly and comprehensively. A recommended multiphasic CT protocol typically begins with a noncontrast scan to detect hyperattenuating hemorrhagic collections or extraluminal air followed by the administration of oral contrast. Imaging during the arterial (25-30 seconds) and venous (60-70 seconds) phases enhances the visualization of vascular injuries and the assessment of associated inflammatory changes. US offers several advantages, including bedside applicability, real-time imaging, lack of ionizing radiation, low cost, accessibility, and repeatability[ 12 9 13 MRI provides valuable information with the added benefit of no ionizing radiation. Moreover, MRI is particularly useful in the evaluation of pancreatitis and pancreatitis-related fluid collections because it has superior soft tissue resolution and excellent tissue contrast differentiation[ 9 13 14 15 EXPECTED POST-ERCP IMAGING FINDINGS Certain imaging findings normally appear after ERCP and should not be mistaken for pathological conditions. In particular, the air within the intraextrahepatic bile ducts, which is consistent with pneumobilia, can be observed. This finding may continue for several weeks to several months in patients who have undergone sphincterotomy. Contrast material injected during ERCP may also appear on CT imaging as characteristic layering within the bile ducts and gallbladder (Figure 1 9 13 Figure 1  Typical imaging findings of air and contrast material in the biliary system after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Another condition secondary to ERCP or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is acute reversible duodenitis, which has the potential association with duodenal diverticula. Imaging findings include duodenal wall thickening, a target sign due to submucosal edema, and inflammatory changes in the periduodenal fat. The differential diagnosis is made by excluding other complications based on imaging and laboratory results and is accompanied by improvement in the findings on follow-up CT scans (Figure 2 9 13 16 Figure 2  Typical imaging finding of acute duodenitis after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Retroperitoneal air may be observed within 24 hours after ERCP in asymptomatic patients. This finding may result from excessive air insufflation during ERCP and can be classified as a Stapfer type IV perforation. The absence of fluid collections is an important distinguishing feature; however, it is not sufficient by itself to definitively exclude other types of perforations. It is recommended that this finding should be reported descriptively without directly using the term perforation. No specific treatment is required[ 9 17 18 ERCP-RELATED COMPLICATIONS PEP PEP is the most common ERCP-related complication. Its incidence varies between 4.0% and 14.1% depending on the patient’s risk factors[ 7 19 7 20 22 The ASGE, ESGE, and American Gastroenterological Association recommend the use of the Revised Atlanta Classification for evaluating PEP, including early CT imaging[ 11 20 23 24 25 26 15 The diagnostic criteria for PEP is currently debated, and clinicians should realize that abdominal pain or elevated serum amylase levels following ERCP is not always indicative of PEP. PEP diagnosis is most frequently based on the classification system introduced by Cotton et al 27 28 The revised Atlanta classification has been utilized in clinical practice due to its relevance to managing acute pancreatitis even though it was not specifically designed for diagnosing PEP. It classifies disease severity by the presence or absence of local complications, systemic inflammatory response, and organ failure within the first 48 h after symptom onset. Compared with the Cotton Consensus Criteria, the revised Atlanta classification is more effective in predicting the severity and mortality of PEP[ 8 21 23 29 30 The revised Atlanta classification recognizes two primary forms of acute pancreatitis: NP and interstitial edematous pancreatitis (IEP). NP tends to follow a more severe clinical course with higher rates of infection, organ failure, and mortality. Imaging reveals hypoperfused or non-enhancing areas indicating NP or peripancreatic necrosis. Early collections (within 4 weeks) are referred to as acute necrotic collections. Once encapsulated after 4 weeks, they are known as walled-off necrosis (Figure 3 23 4 5 Figure 3  Necrotizing pancreatitis, acute necrotic collections, and walled-off necrosis. Figure 4  Interstitial edematous pancreatitis and acute peripancreatic fluid collections. Figure 5  Acute peripancreatic fluid collections and pseudocyst. The CT Severity Index and the Modified CT Severity Index are commonly used to assess the severity of acute pancreatitis. There are no significant differences between the two indices. While clinical scoring systems more accurately correlate with systemic complications and mortality, radiological scoring systems demonstrate a stronger correlation with the diagnosis of severe disease, pancreatic infection, and the need for intervention[ 31 et al 32 CECT may overestimate the extent of NP during evaluation. Therefore, its use is limited in cases with small necrotic areas where accurate estimation of necrosis is challenging. CT is more sensitive for detecting gas within fluid collections. This is an indication of infection or enteric fistulation. However, the absence of gas does not rule out an underlying infection. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging can determine whether restricted diffusion is causing the infection of a collection[ 33 36 36 MRI with its superior soft tissue resolution offers greater accuracy for the assessment of small necrotic regions of the pancreas[ 33 3 33 34 35 33 35 36 Walled-off necrosis typically appears as a partially liquefied collection containing solid necrotic tissue and fatty debris. The advantage of MRI in soft tissue contrast over CT enhances the accuracy in assessing the solid parts of pancreatic and peripancreatic collections. As the amount of solid debris increases, the effectiveness of drainage through stents or catheters tends to decrease. Therefore, MRI is particularly useful in guiding therapeutic decisions, including the need for endoscopic necrosectomy[ 36 Infectious complications During ERCP, the endoscope and contrast medium may become contaminated with gastrointestinal flora before reaching the CBD. This event is typically clinically insignificant, but failure to achieve adequate ductal drainage can lead to biliary stasis and subsequent bacterial overgrowth. Infections commonly present as cholangitis. Even in the absence of overt clinical infection, bacteremia occurs in 15% of diagnostic ERCP procedures and 27% of therapeutic ERCP procedures. In high-risk patient groups, prophylactic antibiotic administration is suggested to minimize severe complications such as infective endocarditis[ 6 37 38 11 38 The ESGE recommends an initial evaluation with abdominal US or CT scan when an infectious complication following ERCP arises. If conservative treatment fails to achieve clinical improvement, repeat ERCP is advised[ 20 20 39 40 39 40  Cholangitis: 7 39 41 42 11 20 39 11 ERCP is an effective treatment modality for cholangitis, yet it also contributes to its development. The typical clinical presentation of cholangitis includes Charcot’s triad, which consists of fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain. In severe cases, hypotension and altered mental status may occur to form Reynolds’ pentad. This clinical progression is attributed to the translocation of bacteria from infected bile into the bloodstream. When incomplete biliary drainage is anticipated, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended. Moreover, biliary stents placed during ERCP may become obstructed over time, potentially resulting in delayed cholangitis[ 11 43 In patients with suspected cholangitis, US is the typical initial imaging modality. It reveals intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and biliary abscesses. CT and MRI can be employed for further evaluation. Imaging findings include thickened and contrast-enhancing bile duct walls, a prominently enhancing and edematous ampulla, periportal T2 hyperintense areas, and diffusion restriction. Heterogeneous hepatic parenchymal enhancement and cholangitic abscesses may be observed (Figure 6 43 45 Figure 6  Cholangitis.  Cholecystitis: 7 40 46 46 49 47 The clinical presentation of cholecystitis includes fever, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and a positive Murphy’s sign. Symptoms typically arise within 5 days after ERCP. The underlying mechanism is hypothesized to involve gallbladder dyskinesia or cystic duct obstruction and is potentially facilitated by contamination from non-sterile contrast material[ 41 48 49 Imaging findings on US include a thick-walled, hydropic gallbladder, and pericholecystic fluid. Moreover, CT and MRI reveal abnormal gallbladder wall enhancement (Figure 7 48 Figure 7  Cholecystitis.  Pyogenic liver abscess: 50 51 52 On US, abscesses smaller than 2 cm typically appear as hypoechoic nodules, while larger abscesses present as heterogeneous masses, ranging from hyperechoic to hypoechoic due to internal septations and debris. Therefore, US has limited specificity distinguishing abscesses from neoplasms. Posterior acoustic enhancement and the absence of flow signals on Doppler US, however, are suggestive of an abscess[ 53 A hepatic abscess appears as a heterogeneous solid mass on CT in the early stages. It typically develops a peripheral contrast-enhancing rim with a centrally hypoattenuating core as it progresses. Pyogenic liver abscesses may be difficult to differentiate from necrotic tumors. The double target sign in which the outer wall layer enhances later than the inner wall layer is an important feature for differentiation. Abscesses usually appear hypointense on T1-weighted MRI and hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI. Peripheral rim enhancement shows the double target sign on contrast-enhanced sequences and typically yields low apparent diffusion coefficient values on diffusion-weighted imaging (Figure 8 53 55 Figure 8  Pyogenic liver abscess. Hemorrhage Hemorrhage is a potentially serious complication of ERCP that most commonly results after sphincterotomy. It is an uncommon complication with an incidence of 1.2%-1.7%[ 7 47 56 The ASGE, ACG, ESGE, and JGES do not have specific guidelines addressing ERCP-related hemorrhage. However, they do provide guidelines concerning gastrointestinal bleeding in general[ 57 59 57 60 58 59 Acute duodenal wall hemorrhage appears as an area of high-attenuation wall thickening on imaging. The attenuation decreases as the hemorrhage evolves and often forms a pseudocapsule. Hyperattenuating blood can be seen within the CBD and the duodenal lumen in cases of intraluminal bleeding. Arterial phase acquisition with vascular window settings and maximum intensity projection reconstruction demonstrate active contrast extravasation in the duodenum (Figures 9 10 37 61 62 Figure 9  Acute duodenal wall and mesenteric hemorrhages. Figure 10  Hemobilia. A subcapsular hematoma resulting from the tearing of vascular or biliary structures during wire manipulation or balloon dilation may occur. In addition pseudoaneurysms can develop from irritation or erosion of adjacent vessel walls by biliary stents. These complications may require surgical or angiographic intervention (Figure 11 63 66 Figure 11  Hepatic pseudoaneurysm. Hemorrhage is classified as mild, moderate, or severe. Mild bleeding is self-limiting and can be managed conservatively. Moderate to severe bleeding may require repeated endoscopic interventions, such as epinephrine injection, placement of hemoclips, balloon tamponade, electrocauterization, temporary stent placement, or angiographic embolization or surgical treatment in severe cases[ 67 68 Perforation The incidence of ERCP-related perforation is 0.09%-1.67% with associated mortality rates reaching up to 8.00%[ 7 69 70 e.g. 11 18 71 ERCP-related perforations occur through several mechanisms. Luminal perforations, typically intraperitoneal, result from direct trauma from the endoscope. Retroperitoneal leaks occur when the sphincterotomy incision extends beyond the intramural segment of the bile or pancreatic duct. Perforation can also result from guidewire or stent migration. Clinically, perforation symptoms can mimic PEP, making diagnosis challenging. The extravasation of contrast material outside the lumen during the procedure should raise suspicion of perforation. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to life-threatening complications[ 11 71 72 73 Diagnosis of ERCP-related perforations during the procedure may involve direct visualization of a luminal defect or an indirect sign ( e.g. 11 69 74 In the classification system proposed by Stapfer et al 17 12 73 13 73 14 15 Figure 12  Stapfer type I perforation. Figure 13  Stapfer type II perforation. Figure 14  Stapfer type III perforation. Figure 15  Stapfer type IV perforation. A systematic review published in 2017 identified Stapfer type II perforations as the most frequent (58.4%), followed by type I (17.8%), type 3 (13.2%), and type IV (10.6%). The review highlighted that early surgical intervention is crucial for type I perforations due to a high risk of sepsis-related mortality, whereas conservative, non-surgical management is generally preferred for types III and IV. The timing of surgery was shown to be critical in type II cases, with early intervention associated with reduced mortality rates[ 70 When a perforation is suspected, abdominal CT with water-soluble oral contrast is recommended. Key diagnostic findings include extraluminal air, contrast extravasation, or fluid collections. Free air may be intraperitoneal or extraperitoneal depending on the injury site. In type II injuries, air most commonly accumulates between the head of the pancreas and the posterior aspect of the duodenum. It may also extend to the right perirenal or anterior pararenal space, the inferior vena cava, and the mediastinum[ 9 13 75 17 9 13 If there are no signs of peritonitis on CT and no evidence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, conservative management is appropriate. Small perforations are typically self-limiting and can close spontaneously, whereas larger perforations lead to the formation of infected biliary collections located intraperitoneally or retroperitoneally[ 9 13 76 73 Complications associated with biliary stents Stent placement is commonly used to treat biliary obstruction caused by benign and malignant conditions. Plastic and metallic stents are utilized and easily identifiable on CT imaging. Stent-related complications are categorized as primary or secondary. Primary complications include stent fracture and migration, while secondary complications encompass hemorrhage, perforation, infection, stent encrustation, stent obstruction, and tumor regrowth[ 77 79 e.g. e.g. 13  Stent migration: 16 17 80 81 78 80 82 Figure 16  Proximal stent migration. Figure 17  Distal stent migration. Distal migration of a biliary stent typically involves passage through the gastrointestinal tract without complication. However, there is the potential for perforation of the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, or colon[ 83 84 i.e. 18 79 Figure 18  Distal stent migration and duodenal perforation.  Stent fracture: 19 85 86 Figure 19  Stent fracture. via Post-sphincterotomy biliary stricture Post-sphincterotomy biliary stricture is a rare complication. It results from fibrosis at the sphincterotomy site and can develop months to years after the procedure. Strictures located just above the duodenal wall are classified as type 1, while those situated deeper within the bile duct are type 2. In type 1 strictures, a simple extension of the sphincterotomy may be sufficient, whereas type 2 strictures often require balloon dilation. Similarly, the pancreatic duct orifice may also become stenotic following sphincterotomy, leading to recurrent episodes of pancreatitis (Figure 20 38 68 Figure 20  Post-sphincterotomy biliary stricture. INTEGRATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INNOVATIVE IMAGING TECHNIQUES IN ERCP-RELATED COMPLICATIONS Studies involving artificial intelligence (AI) and novel imaging modalities in the radiological evaluation of ERCP-related complications have focused on pancreatitis, the most common ERCP-related complication. AI plays a significant role in the medical field, particularly in radiology, by aiding in lesion detection, characterization, segmentation, post-treatment response evaluation, and risk stratification[ 87 Hamada et al 88 et al 89 Dual-energy CT (DECT) is a sophisticated diagnostic modality that enhances tissue characterization by generating images at multiple energy levels within a single acquisition[ 90 91 et al 92 DECT-based virtual noncontrast imaging in cases of bleeding complications avoids the need for an initial noncontrast scan, thereby decreasing overall radiation burden by 30%[ 93 90 93 It is evident that emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and DECT are gaining significant traction in radiology and various medical applications. They will play a greater role in the prediction and evaluation of ERCP-related complications in the future. CONCLUSION ERCP is routinely performed in many medical centers and is a minimally invasive alternative to procedures that once required major surgery. While complications are relatively rare, they lead to considerable morbidity and even mortality. Due to the increasing complexity of the procedures, the ability of the clinician to interpret procedural findings in conjunction with laboratory results is crucial to select the optimal imaging strategy for timely diagnosis and effective treatment. CT is often the initial imaging modality employed at the presentation of ERCP-related complications due to its speed, accessibility, and ability to provide valuable diagnostic information. Emerging technologies such as DECT allow the acquisition of greater diagnostic information while minimizing radiation exposure. Although the current use of AI in assessing ERCP-related complications is limited and focused on PEP, its potential for broader application is expected to grow with future research on various complications. Radiologists play a vital role in identifying complications and recognizing expected post-procedural changes. Clear communication between radiologists and endoscopists is essential. It is crucial for both clinicians to understand normal and abnormal imaging features. In addition, structured classification systems of ERCP-related complications are needed for accurate reporting and optimal patient care. Future multidisciplinary research incorporating both radiological advancements and clinical insights will be pivotal in improving patient outcomes following ERCP.
