This, in turn, systematically amplifies concordant findings while attenuating evidence for tissue integrity, metabolic, symbiotic and network‐centric cues. This conceptual monoculture appears as a hidden dogma that impedes breakthroughs in our understanding of the immune system and the development of curative therapies. By institutionalising theoretical immunology as a formal discipline and treating models as explicit, testable tools rather than hidden assumptions, immunologists can sharpen hypothesis generation and achieve a better understanding of existing data. This essay provides an overview of empirically grounded theoretical models to counter monoculture, clarify how frames shape interpretation, and expand the field's conceptual toolkit.

Yet every observation in biology is inevitably filtered through theoretical models—the hidden frames of reference that structure scientific cognition, guide data interpretation and shape experimental design. These conceptual lenses influence which questions appear meaningful, the experiments we choose to perform, and the conclusions we allow ourselves to draw. Far from being optional, models are indispensable: they are the scaffolds through which scientists make sense of complexity and test hypotheses [ 1 Immunology provides a striking case. For decades, the self–nonself (SNS) model has dominated, casting immunity primarily as a defence against foreignness [ 2 3 4 5 6 The contrast with physics is instructive. Theoretical physics matured as a discipline well before many experimental breakthroughs, creating conceptual frameworks that anticipated technologies from semiconductors to GPS. Immunology, by comparison, has never developed a formal theoretical counterpart. Interpretive models remain largely subconscious and fragmented, leaving the field prone to incremental rather than exponential advances. If we aim for curative therapies, immunology cannot afford to move forward without making its theoretical foundations explicit, subjecting them to critical scrutiny, and improving them accordingly. This essay argues for the establishment of ‘theoretical immunology’ as a distinct discipline. Its mission is to bring interpretive lenses from the subconscious to the conscious, enabling immunologists to interrogate not only their data but also the hidden assumptions or models that guide its interpretation. A model's value is not confined to predictive accuracy. Its deeper utility lies in its ability to generate novel hypotheses, integrate scattered observations and reveal dimensions of immune behaviour invisible through other frameworks. Importantly, theoretical immunology does not treat models as a linear progression towards a single ‘correct’ view. Rather, models are understood as complementary perspectives, each illuminating specific facets of immune behaviour depending on context, scale and experimental design. The innovation lies in cultivating self‐awareness of these perspectives, building a discipline of theory that parallels the role theoretical physics has played in the hard sciences. Such a shift could catalyse transformative breakthroughs in immunology, turning the field from one dominated by incremental gains into one capable of producing curative interventions. Revisiting foundational questions—What signals initiate an immune response? How do effector T cells decide to cooperate or destroy?—through diverse theoretical lenses may hold the key to unlocking the next era of immunological discovery. 2 Theoretical Models of Lymphocyte Activation The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of theoretical models that account for the induction of immune responses. Although certain models also elaborate on mechanisms of immune tolerance, tolerance lies outside the primary scope of this discussion. 2.1 One Signal Model or Allorecognition of Signal I The SNS model of immunity posits that the immune system tolerates self and attacks nonself, implying that the immune system's tolerance of self‐antigens expressed by malignant cells results in cancer progression, escaping from self or peripheral tolerance results in autoimmunity, and alloreactivity results in graft rejection. The SNS model was first introduced by Burnet and Fenner in 1949 [ 2 7 8 9 2.2 The Evolution of the Two‐Signal Model and the Emergence of the Integrity‐Based Three‐Signal Model In a landmark Science paper, Bretscher and Cohn proposed CD4 + 3 10 3 11 12 13 14 4 5 15 16 16 2.3 From Two‐Step, Two‐Signal to Quorum Model In 1999, Peter Bretscher proposed two‐step, two‐signal model to explain the activation of B cells and T cells [ 17 17 18 2.4 The Discontinuity Model To unify the SNS and danger models, Thomas Pradeu proposed the discontinuity model of immunity in 2013 [ 19 19 20 21 22 19 2.5 Modelling T‐Cell Activation as a Quantum Cascade of Energy Transmission Inspired by the quorum model of immune activation, it was proposed that quorum sensing extends beyond cellular cooperation and can also operate at the molecular level [ 23 24 23 25 26 + 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 A comparative analysis of the current models of T‐cell activation is summarised in Table 1 TABLE 1 Theoretical models of T cell activation.

These debates are organised into the three topics outlined below: 4.1 Central Tolerance and Central Adaptation Most theoretical models of lymphocyte activation—except the adaptation model—accept the classical framework of central tolerance, wherein T cells are educated in the thymus through a two‐step selection process: cortical positive selection, which enforces MHC restriction and medullary negative selection, which eliminates strongly self‐reactive clones. This model has shaped decades of immunological thought and remains foundational across mainstream paradigms. Peter Bretscher proposed a unified model integrating central and peripheral tolerance. In his framework, central tolerance eliminates most self‐reactive clones within the thymus, while peripheral tolerance addresses antigens not encountered centrally, through mechanisms such as signal‐dependent inactivation [ 81 82 18 83 84 The adaptation model, however, offers a fundamentally different interpretation. It proposes a model of central adaptation, wherein T cells are not trained to become tolerant of self, but rather are educated to become self‐reactive in a regulated, functional manner, enabling them to participate in tissue homeostasis and physiological immune surveillance. According to this view, what has traditionally been interpreted as medullary negative selection may instead represent the elimination of defective T cells—cells that undergo apoptosis after receiving co‐stimulatory signals from APCs due to intrinsic defects in survival or signalling pathways [ 50 51 56 85 86 87 88 52 53 54 89 90 91 92 93 4.2 Tissue Homeostatic Immunity Although all major models of immunity have evolved to recognise that immune responses extend beyond host defence—acknowledging growing evidence for their roles in tissue homeostasis—they diverge in how they conceptualise the homeostatic functions of lymphocytes [ 94 95 16 50 51 56 96 97 98 4.3 T‐Cell Activation While all current models of T‐cell activation explain the process at the cellular level—emphasising the roles of APCs, B cells, pMHC complexes and co‐stimulatory signals—the quantum model shifts the focus to the molecular interface between pMHC and the TCR's CDR3 loop. It proposes that a quorum of pMHC–CDR3 interactions could be sufficient to trigger activation when a molecular activation threshold is reached [ 23 This model has recently been critiqued by Peter Bretscher [ 91 23 99 100 101 102 47 Regarding the affinity vs. avidity debate, both mechanisms likely coexist. While Bretscher has outlined compelling evidence for affinity‐based activation [ 103 + 104 105 105 106 5 The Case for Integrating Theoretical Immunology into Education and Scientific Discourse Immunology education at both undergraduate and graduate levels remains anchored in a narrow theoretical framework—primarily the SNS/INS paradigms, with limited exposure to alternative models such as the danger model. The dominance of these early models in immunology textbooks and curricula has created a conceptual monoculture, leaving students largely unaware of competing or complementary theoretical frameworks that underpin experimental design, data interpretation and therapeutic strategies. As a result, emerging immunologists often adopt these models as empirical truths rather than testable theoretical constructs, which impedes critical examination of foundational assumptions in the field. This epistemological gap stems from the absence of ‘theoretical immunology’ as a recognised subdiscipline. Unlike fields such as physics or evolutionary biology—where theoretical modelling is considered essential to understanding and guiding empirical work—immunology has not institutionalised a rigorous platform for developing, comparing or refining its theoretical foundations. Consequently, research and training tend to reinforce prevailing models rather than question or evolve them in light of discordant observations. This contributes to a form of intellectual inertia, wherein data that challenge the dominant paradigm are marginalised or overlooked, and innovation is constrained by conceptual boundaries that remain invisible to the very scientists operating within them. The impact of this theoretical void is particularly acute in translational immunology. Despite decades of research and investment, curative therapies for many immune‐mediated diseases—including autoimmune disorders, allergies and solid tumours—remain elusive. One contributing factor may be the misalignment between the theoretical assumptions driving therapeutic development and the biological realities they attempt to target. For instance, models that emphasise SNS discrimination may inadequately explain immune mechanisms or context‐dependent immune responses in tissue microenvironments, whereas alternative frameworks—such as the discontinuity model, the integrity model, or adaptation‐based theories—may offer novel explanatory and therapeutic insights that remain underexplored. 6 Conclusions When the theoretical foundations of immunology are left unexamined—and the field is tacitly narrowed to the SNS/INS lens—those assumptions harden into the status quo. Research design then optimises for questions that confirm foreignness/infection narratives, grant panels favour proposals that fit that frame and manuscripts that present discordant mechanisms are discounted as ‘outliers’. The result is path‐dependent science: incremental advances, repeated targets and immunotherapies that manage symptoms rather than reprogram immune–tissue decisions. Making our models explicit and testable breaks this loop, opening space for genuinely novel hypotheses, funding choices and curative strategies. I propose establishing theoretical immunology as a formal discipline—not a catalogue of abstractions, but a training‐centred framework for comparing, reconciling and refining competing models. For the next generation of immunologists, this means teaching models in operational terms with worked examples across organs and diseases, and embedding these practices through graduate curricula, plus dedicated conference tracks, seminar series, and targeted fellowships. Making theory a first‐class component of training will produce immunologists who can design experiments to discriminate among models, review grants for testability rather than conformity, and translate data into mechanism‐driven, curative immunotherapies. Making theory a first‐class citizen will not displace empiricism; it will provide the intellectual infrastructure that turns rapidly accumulating data into mechanism. It sharpens hypotheses, renders negative results informative, elevates peer review from preference to testability and creates conceptual space where genuinely new ideas can be recognised and funded. If we seek cures rather than incremental control in autoimmunity, transplantation, infection and cancer, we must stop treating models as invisible truths and start treating them as explicit, competing programmes—to be compared, refined or retired by evidence.
