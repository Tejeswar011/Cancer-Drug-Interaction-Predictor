Background Sleep disorders are very prevalent in cancer-related depression (CRD) patients, which seriously impacts their quality of life. But the curative effect of drugs is not ideal. Existing five-element music therapy (FEMT) is effective in improving sleep and emotion in cancer patients, but lacks attention to matching the patient’s subjective emotion to the music. In this study, we propose the innovative “FEMT based on emotion classification”, aiming to validate its effect on improving sleep and emotion in CRD patients, and to compare its efficacy with that of traditional FEMT. Methods 120 CRD patients were randomly divided into the emotional classification music group (ECMG), the traditional music group (TMG), and the no music group (NMG). The outcome index was the difference between the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) on the 14th and 28th days and baseline. the exploratory indexes were 5-HT, IL-1 β, IL-2, and TNF-α. Results Both ECMG and TMG significantly improved the total score of PSQI, HAMD, and HAMA. ECMG significantly improved sleep disorder on the 14th day, and improved both sleep disorder and daytime dysfunction on the 28th day.TMG improved overall sleep quality and daytime dysfunction on the 28th day. Conclusion Both therapies can effectively improve sleep disorders and negative emotions in patients with CRD. The former takes effect faster, while the latter has a more stable curative effect. The two therapies can be used as clinical adjuvant treatment, and personalized intervention programs can be selected according to patients’ needs.

It achieves the goal of helping individuals meet physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs through the application of music and instruments ( 28 29 30 36 37 38 39 42 43 44 45 46 47 52 53 55 2 Methods 2.1 Design This was a prospective, randomized, partially blinded, controlled, clinical trial. This experiment was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Xiyuan Hospital, Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Approval number: 2022XLA011-2), and has completed registration in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2200062181). This study was conducted from March 2023 to September 2024. The subjects came from the oncology outpatient clinics and wards of two hospitals in Beijing (Xiyuan Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences and Guanganmen Hospital of China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences). After fully explaining the research procedure, the subjects provided written informed consent. Evaluation and intervention were carried out in outpatient clinics and wards of the above two hospitals. FEMT is offered free of charge. 2.2 Participants Participant screening and recruitment were conducted by a research assistant who was an experienced nurse. The selection criteria were: (1) the disease was diagnosed as cancer; (2) Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score was≥ 8 and < 24; (3) age was ≥ 18 years old; (4) Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score was ≥ 60; (5) the expected survival time was more than 3 months; Participants were excluded if they were: (1) patients with suicidal motives and suicidal tendencies; (2) patients with critical illness in the advanced stage of tumor; (3) patients with serious diseases such as heart, liver, kidney, and hematopoietic system disorders; (4) unconscious or mentally ill; (5) pregnant women; (6) people with hearing impairment or those who could not cooperate with treatment. During the treatment process, those who had poor compliance, failed to be treated according to the prescribed plan, and for whom the curative effect could not be evaluated were also eliminated. The subjects were aware of the grouping situation, that is, they knew which group they belonged to. 2.3 Randomization and allocation concealment An independent research assistant performed the randomization procedure. According to the randomized list (1: 1: 1), the eligible subjects were randomly assigned to three groups: Emotional Classification Music Group (ECMG), Traditional Music Group (TMG) and No Music Group (NMG). The randomization list was generated by an independent research assistant using SAS software before recruitment. Allocation criteria were defined such that all subjects had an equal probability of being assigned to each group, consistent with a simple randomization design. The group identifiers corresponding to the list were sealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The person who prepared and maintained custody of the envelopes was blinded, and she, along with the independent research assistant responsible for randomization, was not involved in any other steps of the study. After the participants completed the baseline assessment, the envelope was opened by the therapist. 2.4 Interventions All participants were treated with routine regimens provided by oncologists. All therapists had more than 8 years of practical experience and had received professional training before the study began. We developed a “FEMT Software for Selecting Music Based on Emotion Classification”, which contained 153 music pieces screened and sorted by music experts ( 56 ECMG received FEMT, which selected music based on emotion classification. In the first treatment, the therapist briefly introduced the treatment procedure. The treatment plan was based on the music theory of the five elements of TCM, evidence-based evidence, and clinical experience of treatment experts. The therapist guided the patients to use the software and enter the corresponding music library according to the disease diagnosis and TCM syndrome differentiation of the participants. Users could freely select 9 songs in the limited music library according to their preferences (each song lasted about 3 minutes). These songs belonged to the corresponding modes and emotional categories. After selection, the playing order was automatically arranged in strict accordance with the divided emotional categories to generate a personalized song list. The therapist informed the participants of the specific listening methods in detail, and asked the participants to wear headphones, lie down, close their eyes and listen to the selected tracks in sequence when they were relaxed, and to feel the music carefully. They listened for 30–40 minutes once a day for 4 weeks, and were treated 28 times in total. TMG underwent traditional FEMT, following the same procedures as ECMG. However, the music library was limited to specific modes, with no emotional categories or specific order of playback. The participants were free to choose their own music. This listening session lasted 30–40 minutes daily for four weeks, for a total of 28 sessions. NMG received routine treatment based on its condition, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (  Figure 1 Figure 1 Research design and flow chart. 1 Hamilton depression scale (HAMD); 2 Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA); 3 Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); 4 Exploratory indicators (5-HT, IL-1β, IL-2, TNF-α). Flowchart of a randomized study with three groups: ECMG, TMG, and NMG. ECMG received 28 sessions of TCM five-element music therapy based on emotional categories. TMG received TCM music therapy without emotional focus. NMG received no therapy. Of 141 screened participants, 120 were randomized into three groups (40 each). Two dropped out from the intervention group, and one from the control group. Assessments occurred at weeks zero, two, and four. 2.5 Outcome measurement The main outcome was the change of total score and 7 factor scores of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) at baseline, 14th day, and 28th day. PSQI is an 18-item self-report questionnaire, which is divided into seven types of factors: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. PSQI is used to evaluate sleep quality and disturbances, which has been fully verified in the diagnosis of CRSD ( 57 58 59 Participants were asked if any adverse events (AE) occurred during each visit. The severity of AE is graded according to the AE General Terminology Standard V5.0. Any serious adverse events will be reported to the project researcher and ethics committee immediately. If too many serious adverse events occur, the trial will be stopped immediately. The outcome assessor was blinded. She was unaware of the patients’ group allocation and conducted evaluations based on the patients’ random codes. Unblinding was performed only after all assessments had been completed. She was not involved in any other research procedures. 2.6 Data monitoring This study was conducted by the Ethics Supervision Committee of Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, for data and safety monitoring, including independent experts such as statisticians and clinical experts. They were not involved in the conduct of the study, but held regular meetings to review its progress. 2.7 Statistical analysis Sample size estimation was performed based on the primary outcome measure (PSQI total score). A total of three groups were set up in this study. Using G*Power 3.1 software, an ANOVA model was selected for estimation. With the parameters set at f = 0.25, α = 0.05, power = 0.8, and considering an approximate 20% dropout rate, a total sample size of 120 cases (40 per group) was ultimately determined. For participant characteristic data, an R×C contingency table and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi-square test were employed to analyze intergroup differences. Given that the difference in age distribution between groups was statistically significant, subsequent analyses of covariance included age as a covariate in all models to adjust for its potential influence. The analysis of covariance was based on the assumption of a Compound Symmetry (CS) covariance structure and was conducted entirely using SAS software (V 9.4). Because of the statistical significance of age distribution between groups, age was taken as a covariate for covariance analysis. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to calculate the measured values of the total score of each scale and the PSQI at day 0, as well as the differences between day 0 and day 14, and between day 0 and day 28. Tukey’s test was used for pairwise comparisons. We also conducted power calculations with Welch’s test to reflect the credibility of the study results. Secondly, ANOVA was used to perform subgroup analyses for the changes in PSQI total scores by gender, cancer stage, and cancer type at day 0–14 and day 0-28. Mixed-effect models for repeated measures (MMRM) were used to conduct a type 3 test of fixed effects on each indicator score, to analyze the factors influencing each score, and to conduct within-group comparisons. Three subjects were excluded from the above analyses. They did not complete the evaluation program because they dropped out of the study. For biomarkers, this analysis was solely exploratory. Due to the considerable discrepancy in sample sizes before and after treatment and the lack of complete paired data, further robust analysis was limited. Therefore, listwise deletion was applied to missing data, and only the means and standard deviations of all available data were calculated. Due to the small sample size and the unpaired nature of the samples, only descriptive analysis was performed on the collected data, without inferential testing. This approach may introduce significant bias, and the results should be interpreted with caution. In this study, three subjects withdrew after randomization but before receiving the first intervention assessment due to death or worsening condition These subjects did not receive any intervention and did not generate any follow-up data available for analysis. Therefore, we adopted the Per-Protocol (PP) analysis, aiming to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention protocol in the participants who actually completed the treatment most accurately. All statistical tests were carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics 26, and a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A professional data processor conducted data analysis. The analyst was blinded and performed the analysis using group codes (e.g., experimental group = Group A). Unblinding was carried out only after all analyses had been completed. She was not involved in any other research procedures. 3 Results 3.1 Recruitment and baseline characteristics From March 2023 to September 9, 2024, we screened 141 subjects for eligibility. 120 subjects were randomly divided into ECMG (n=40), TMG (n=40) and NMG (n=40).

FEMT based on emotion classification and traditional FEMT have achieved better performance in improving PSQI total score, factor 5, and factor 7 scores. The difference in PSQI total scores from day 0 for TMG total scores at day 28 was greater than the difference from day 0 for NMG total scores (F = 3.58, P = 0.031, Pwr=0.68615) (  Figure 2  Table 2 Figure 2 PSQI total score.

Through the analysis of the mixed effect model, the comparison of each time point in the group, it was found that the total score, factor 5 score, and factor 7 score of PSQI on the 14th and 28th day after ECMG treatment were all lower than those on the 0th day. At the same time, TMG only decreased on the 28th day after treatment. There was no change in NMG. Using the type 3 test of fixed effects, it is found that the time factor influences factors 2, 3, and 6. Visiting time and the interaction between time and grouping influence total score, factor 5, and factor 7. Factor 4 is not affected.

Error bars represent variability. Through the analysis of the mixed effect model, the comparison of each time point in the group, it was found that the total scores of HAMD and HAMA in ECMG and TMG on the 14th day and 28th day after treatment were lower than those on the 0th day. At the same time, the total scores of HAMD in NMG had no change, but the total scores of HAMA on the 28th day after treatment were lower than those on the 0th day. Using the Type 3 test of fixed effect, it was found that the visit time and the interaction factors between time and grouping influenced the total score of HAMD and HAMA. 3.4 Exploratory indicators This study did not collect samples from all subjects. We obtained biological markers from 20, 22, and 21 subjects in the three groups, respectively, at intervention day 0, and from 15, 17, and 15 subjects in the three groups, at intervention day 28. After intervention, the levels of 5-HT and IL-2 in ECMG showed an upward trend, while the other two groups showed a downward trend. The level of IL-1 β in ECMG and NMG did not change significantly, but the level of IL-1 β in TMG decreased significantly. The levels of TNF-α in all three groups showed a downward trend, especially in TMG and NMG (  Table 5  Figure 5 Figure 5  (A) (B) (C) (D) Bar graphs depicting changes in levels of various biomarkers over time in different groups.

This study demonstrated that both emotion-based FEMT and traditional FEMT are effective in improving sleep disorders in depressed malignant tumor patients. The trial used a planned sample size based on the primary outcome measure, and baseline flattening was achieved through analysis of covariance The intervention variable was also singular, taking into account the expected dropout rate and the ability to detect differences in secondary outcome measures. Through post-hoc  Table 2 Emotion-based FEMT significantly improved sleep disturbances on day 14 of intervention and improved both sleep disturbances and daytime dysfunction on day 28. Traditional FEMT demonstrated significant improvements in overall sleep quality and daytime dysfunction on day 28. Both of them show different therapeutic advantages. FEMT based on emotion classification has a more obvious short-term curative effect and faster effect, while traditional FEMT has a more lasting curative effect. We speculate that this may be related to the playing order of emotion classification we set. In this experiment, we asked ECMG to listen to two kinds of music, namely, the sense of expression and the sense of talk, in order to induce participants’ emotions and guide them to enter the music scene faster. We ended with three kinds of music, namely, the sense of calm, freshness, and detachment, to calm down emotions or sublimate emotions. This can relieve the listener’s spirit and relax their body, so that they can easily enter deep sleep, reduce sleep interference, and accelerate the effect of FEMT based on emotional classification. In addition, according to the self-determination theory, enhancing individual choice autonomy may enhance the intrinsic motivation of treatment participation and then promote long-term treatment compliance ( 60 61 Unfortunately, FEMT based on emotion classification showed a very slight negative effect on sleep latency on the 14th day, although this turned into a positive effect on the 28th day. We guess that this may be because FEMT, based on emotional classification, adopts the step intervention of “emotional induction (expression/talk)-emotional calming (calm/detachment)”, which leads to short-term sympathetic dominance and increased physiological arousal level. However, the traditional FEMT may avoid continuous sympathetic activation because of its independent choice of playing sequence and random fluctuation of music stimulation intensity. With the continuous intervention of ECMG, parasympathetic regulation was gradually enhanced, and the balance of the autonomic nerves was reversed on the 28th day. But this guess needs to be verified by follow-up research. Moreover, at day 28, females demonstrated better sensitivity to FEMT, especially towards the traditional FEMT. Previous relevant studies have mentioned that females exhibit higher enthusiasm and acceptance when using complementary therapies such as music therapy and show more significant effects in music therapy ( 62 63 FEMT based on emotion classification and traditional FEMT have shown significant clinical efficacy in improving depression and anxiety of cancer patients, which proves that FEMT has unique therapeutic advantages in regulating the emotional state of cancer patients. It is worth noting that although the difference between the two groups is not statistically significant, the traditional FEMT shows a slightly better intervention effect than the FEMT based on emotion classification. We think this may be because although the structured playing of ECMG can accurately match the emotional categories, its fixed music sequence may interfere with patients’ immediate emotional expression needs and limit emotional mobility, thus having a certain impact on the curative effect. In addition, exploratory indexes (5-HT, IL-1 β, etc.) did not show significant changes, which may be related to insufficient sample size or the selection of biomarkers. Due to patient compliance and other issues, we can’t collect biological samples from all personnel. These sample data also do not show a significant result orientation. Therefore, they can only be regarded as our exploratory research, and their significance still needs further verification. They can be used as a reference for future researchers to study the biological indicators of FEMT. 4.2 Research status Existing studies have reported the significant impact of music therapy on cancer patients ( 64 65 71 71 72 73 4.3 Research implications Previous studies of Five Elements music therapy have primarily employed a relatively simple, receptive approach to music listening, lacking attention to the relationship between the patient’s subjective emotional experience and musical emotions. Categorizing traditional pentatonic music into emotional categories and adjusting the order of music playback based on the characteristics of each category not only leverages the unique characteristics of Five Elements music therapy but also highlights the correspondence between the patient’s subjective emotional changes and the musical emotion categories, making Five Elements music therapy more targeted and feasible. Our team’s proposed “FEMT for Music Selection Based on Emotional Classification” pioneered the integration of emotion classification into FEMT, constructing a personalized intervention framework of “emotion classification-music library optimization-music matching.” By systematically categorizing the emotional attributes of traditional Five Elements music and integrating its playback order, we explore more precise and effective methods for improving sleep and mood, which could provide innovative insights into the modernization of FEMT and the precision medicine paradigm. In terms of clinical validation, this study compared the efficacy of emotion classification-based FEMT and traditional FEMT through a multi-group randomized controlled design, clarified the added value of FEMT independent of conventional treatment, and verified its effectiveness and safety in improving sleep in patients with cancer and depression, providing an evidence-based basis for clinical promotion. 4.4 Limitations This study has the following limitations and improvement directions: First, three subjects dropped out after baseline measurement and before the assessment began. As they had no evaluation data, we did not include them in the analysis. This may introduce selection bias, and the results may overestimate efficacy. In the future, more precise analysis should be conducted to avoid potential bias from such handling. Secondly, the intervention cycle designed by the study is relatively short, and it is difficult to evaluate the persistence of the curative effect due to the lack of long-term follow-up data. In the future, it is necessary to seek relevant clinical studies with a longer intervention cycle and make follow-up records to verify the long-term curative effect. Thirdly, due to ethical and clinical feasibility constraints, biomarker data were not fully collected, and a priori 5 Conclusions For patients with CRD, FEMT for 4 weeks has a good effect on sleep disorders and negative emotions. FEMT based on emotion classification and traditional FEMT can be used as an effective supplementary treatment to intervene in sleep disorders and negative emotions of CRD patients in the clinic. Their clinical efficacy has its emphasis, and appropriate therapy can be selected according to the actual situation.
