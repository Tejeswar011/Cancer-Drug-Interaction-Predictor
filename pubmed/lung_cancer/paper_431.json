Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been implicated in both cancer progression and pain modulation, however, their specific role in CIBP remains unclear. The present study aims to elucidate the potential mechanisms by which lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 contributes to the development of CIBP. Methods A CIBP model was established by injecting Walker 256 mammary gland tumor cells into the tibial canal of rats. To assess cancer-induced pain behavior, the authors measured the paw withdrawal threshold and paw withdrawal latency. Transcriptome sequencing was conducted to identify the pathways and genes regulated by lncRNA NONRATT007487.2. Additionally, immunofluorescence, RNA fluorescence in situ Results It was observed that lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 was significantly upregulated in the spinal cords of CIBP rats. Knockdown of lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 alleviated both mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in these rats and appeared to inhibit the chemokine signaling pathway. Notably, CXCL1 expression was notably reduced following the loss of lncRNA NONRATT007487.2. FISH assays demonstrated co-location of lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 and CXCL1 in the spinal cord, and RNA pulldown assays confirmed the direct interaction between these two molecules. Conclusions The results indicated that lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 plays a crucial regulatory role in CIBP through its interaction with CXCL1, presenting a potential therapeutic target for alleviating nociceptive hypersensitivity associated with bone metastasis.

Animals and a cancer-induced bone pain model construction Female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (180–200 g, 8-week-old and 60–80 g, 4-week-old) were purchased from Anburui Biotechnology Co., Ltd. All the rats were housed in specific pathogen-free facilities under controlled conditions (22 ± 2°C, relative humidity 45%–55%, 12-hour light/dark photoperiod) and given free access to food and water. The procedures for the CIBP model were carried out according to the previous studies [ 16 17 2. Behavioral assessment Mechanical pain was assessed using von Frey filaments (Stoelting) as previous studies described [ 10 18 19 3. Transfection The negative control (NC), sh-lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 lentiviral vectors and pcDNA3.1-NC, pcDNA3.1-CXCL1 were synthesized by GenePharma. These vectors were delivered into rats via 4. RNA-seq analysis Three replicate samples from sh-lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 CIBP and CIBP rats underwent mRNA sequencing, conducted by Biozeron Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Following terminal anesthesia, rats were transcardially perfused with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to clear blood from the neurovascular system. The vertebral column was rapidly dissected from the L3 to L5 segments using laminectomy forceps. The total RNA of the spinal cord in the L3–L5 segments was isolated by a TRIzol reagent kit (Invitrogen). Post-extraction, an oligo (dT) bead enrichment step was executed, followed by reverse transcription of targeted mRNA into double-stranded cDNA using random primers. The cDNA fragments were used to construct the sequencing library. Sequencing was carried out on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Differential analysis of RNA-seq data between the groups was conducted using DESeq2, with significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified as false discovery rate < 0.05 and fold change ≥ 2. Additionally, KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment analyses were carried out. 5. Immunoﬂuorescence double staining The initial steps followed the immunohistochemistry protocol until antigen retrieval [ 20 6. RNA fluorescence in situ Fluorescence in situ 21 7. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction Total RNA was extracted from the spinal cord in L3–L5 segments tissues using TRIzol. The cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of RNA with an oligo (dT) primer (Takara). The RT-qPCR was performed using the ABI7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The relative gene expression level were calculated using the 2-△△Ct method. The primers sequences (5’–3’) of the genes are as follows: lncRNA NONRATT007487.2, F: AGCCAGTGGGTCACTTGTGTT, R: TTCTGCTAAAGTCCGGCTGAA; GAPDH, F: TGGAAAGCTGTGGCGTGATG, R: TACTTGGCAGGTTTCTCCAGG; and CXCL1, F: GATGGCGTCTGTCTGGTGAA, R: TCCTGAGACGAGAAGGAGCA. 8. RNA pulldown assay To investigate the potential interaction between lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 and CXCL1, an RNA pull-down experiment was conducted by the Pierce Magnetic RNA-Protein Pull-Down Kit (#20164; Thermo Scientific). Briefly, biotinylated RNA was combined with protein lysates extracted from the spinal cord in L3–L5 segments and streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads. After thorough washing, the beads were analyzed by immunoblotting to identify the captured proteins. 9. Statistical analysis Statistical evaluations were conducted utilizing GraphPad Prism software (version 9.0.1; GraphPad). The presented data represent mean ± standard deviation. Data normality was verified using Shapiro–Wilk test. Student’s t P RESULTS 1. Effect of lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 on cancer-induced pain behavior The results of RT-qPCR showed that lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 was notably increased in the CIBP rats compared with the control rats ( Fig. 1A Fig. 1B Fig. 1C Fig. 1D 2. Knockdown of lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 may inhibit the chemokine signaling pathway Subsequently, in order to investigate the potential pathway of lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 regulation, transcriptome sequencing between CIBP + sh-lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 and CIBP was performed. The results revealed 1,241 DEGs between the two groups, with 410 genes up-regulated and 831 genes down-regulated ( Fig. 2A Fig. 2B, C Fig. 3A, B Fig. 3B Fig. 4 22 3. CXCL1 was down-regulated in CIBP rats with lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 loss Chemokine-induced neuroinflammation plays a crucial role in the development of neuropathic pain [ 23 Fig. 5 2 P Fig. 6A 4. CXCL1 was involved in the regulation of lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 on CIBP progression Next, double immunofluorescence staining showed that CXCL1 was primarily co-localized with Neun, a neuronal marker, in spinal cord tissue, rather than with IBA1 (microglial marker) or GFAP (astrocytes marker) ( Fig. 6B Fig. 6C Fig. 6D, E Fig. 7 DISCUSSION This study elucidates the role of lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 in the modulation of CIBP, specifically highlighting its interaction with CXCL1. The findings indicated that lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 was remarkably up-regulated in the spinal cords of CIBP rats. This suggested that lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 may be a critical player in the pathophysiology of CIBP, potentially acting as a regulatory element in the development and progression of pain associated with cancer metastasis. CIBP represents a challenging clinical manifestation frequently observed following bone metastasis, particularly prevalent in breast cancer cases where the incidence of bone metastasis can reach up to 70% [ 24 25 26 LncRNAs play a pivotal role in the development of numerous human diseases, such as tumors, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders [ 27 28 11 29 via 9 10 Chemokine-mediated neuroinflammation is known to be critical in the progression of chronic pain [ 30 31 32 33 via 34 35 36 37 14 2 P 36 38 39 41 e.g. The authors speculate that lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 may enhance the stability or translation efficiency of CXCL1 by binding to specific regions of CXCL1 mRNA, preventing degradation by RNA-binding proteins ( e.g. 42 42 The data in the present study revealed a complex interplay between NONRATT007487.2 and CXCL1. While the lncRNA directly binds and regulates CXCL1 expression, the persistence of CIBP upon CXCL1 overexpression in lncRNA-deficient rats implied that exogenous overexpression of CXCL1 may bypass this NONRATT007487.2-mediated regulatory axis. This suggested that CXCL1 functions as a central effector in CIBP capable of integrating multiple upstream signals. NONRATT007487.2 is a key but not the sole regulator of CXCL1 in CIBP, and other pathways ( e.g. In conclusion, this study provided compelling evidence that lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 is a significant regulator of CIBP through its interaction with CXCL1. These results enhanced the understanding of the molecular underpinnings of CIBP and suggested that targeting lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 and related signaling pathways may offer a novel approach for the treatment of pain in cancer patients. Further research should focus on elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms through which lncRNA NONRATT007487.2 influences CXCL1 expression and exploring the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting this pathway.
