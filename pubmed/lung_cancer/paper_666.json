Cerebral radiation necrosis (CRN) is a late complication that can occur after the treatment of a brain tumor with focal radiation therapy, particularly stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Since an excessive production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from necrotic lesions is a possible etiology of radiation necrosis, the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab has been reported as an effective treatment option. We report a case of a 71-year-old Japanese male with CRN following SRS, successfully treated with bevacizumab. He had presented with aphasia and right lower-limb muscle weakness 6 years after a left upper lobectomy for lung adenocarcinoma. Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a metastatic brain tumor in the left temporal lobe. A craniotomy and pre- and post-operative SRS treatments were performed to relieve his neurological symptoms. Although initial symptom improvement was observed, the patient developed lower-limb muscle weakness and aphasia symptoms 7 months after the last SRS treatment. 11 18 Keywords Cerebral radiation necrosis Bevacizumab Stereotactic radiosurgery pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Handling Editor: DR AC Amit Chopra 1 Introduction Cerebral radiation necrosis is a late complication of radiotherapy that occurs in approximately 5 %–10 % of patients who have undergone radiotherapy [ [1] [2] [3] 4 5 6 7 The underlying cause of radiation-induced necrosis is thought to be a radiation-inducing upregulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α due to damaged oligodendrocytes and the subsequent release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [ 1 8 5 5 4 Since the pathophysiology of radiation necrosis is centered on the overexpression of VEGF [ 9 10 11 12 Here, we report the case details of a patient with CRN caused by stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) who was successfully treated with bevacizumab and did not experience recurrence four years after completing treatment. 2 Clinical report In September 2019, a 71-year-old Japanese man presented with conduction aphasia, phonological aphasia, and right lower limb muscle weakness 6 years after having undergone a left upper lobectomy for lung adenocarcinoma ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 The patient's clinical course. The numbers in brackets refer to the bevacizumab treatment cycles. SRT: stereotactic radiosurgery. Fig. 1 Approximately 4 months after the additional stereotactic radiosurgery, aphasia, right lower limb weakness, and gait disturbance appeared. At the patient's admission to our institution, he was alert and oriented, and his vital signs were normal. His aphasia symptoms included word recall and phonological abnormalities. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed no metastasis in the lungs. A head MRI examination revealed irregular margins with enhancing effects protruding into the excisional cavity in the patient's left temporal lobe on contrast enhanced T1-weighted images (T1WI) ( Fig. 2 11 11 Fig. 3 18 18 Fig. 3 Fig. 2 MRI of the brain lesions before treatment with bevacizumab. Contrast enhanced T1-weighted image (T1WI) (A) (B) (C) Fig. 2 Fig. 3 PET/CT fusion images. 11 (A) 18 (B) Fig. 3 Based on the absence of abnormal uptake on PET/CT fusion images, the patient was diagnosed with CRN. We treated the patient with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks for six cycles. The MRI examination conducted after two cycles of bevacizumab treatment demonstrated a significant reduction in the surrounding edema and lesion size with irregular contrast enhancement ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 T2-weighted FLAIR MRI following bevacizumab treatment. Images were acquired after two cycles (A) (B) (C) (D) Fig. 4 3 Discussion We have described the case of a patient with a metastatic brain tumor of lung adenocarcinoma with aphasia and muscle weakness due to CRN. The bevacizumab treatment improved his relapsed neurological symptoms (muscle weakness and aphasia), resulting in a reduction in both T1-weighted Gd enhancement and perilesional edema on FLAIR images. Differentiating radiation necrosis from brain metastases is challenging due to the common imaging features such as mass formation, edema, and contrast enhancement on MRI, caused by the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier [ 13 14 15 11 [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] 11 11 21 [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] 11 20 In our patient, the region surrounding the metastatic tumor extraction cavity in the left temporal lobe, which exhibited contrast enhancement, required differentiation from brain metastasis. However, the reduced tracer uptake on 11 11 Regarding the association between the occurrence of brain radiation necrosis and the pathology of cancer, adenocarcinoma histology in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is associated with an increased rate of radiation necrosis [ 22 22 23 24 The efficacy of bevacizumab for reducing perilesional edema, alleviating neurological symptoms, and improving the quality of life in affected patients has been described [ 10 12 Our patient was treated with a high dose of bevacizumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks for six cycles), but no adverse events such as hypertension, proteinuria, or pulmonary hemorrhage were observed. He safely completed all six cycles of treatment, achieving a marked reduction in necrotic volume and edema on MRI. The dosing strategy has varied in the treatment of CRN, typically ranging from 1 to 15 mg/kg administered every 2–3 weeks, with a median of four cycles (range 1–27 cycles) [ 1 25 Zhuang et al. reported that among 13 patients who responded to low-dose bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) administered for at least three cycles, 10 patients (76.9 %) experienced a relapse during a mean follow-up period of 10 months after the discontinuation of bevacizumab [ 26 9 In summary, we report a case of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma and cerebral radiation necrosis who had improvement in neurological symptoms, particularly muscle weakness and aphasia, after treatment with bevacizumab. Reports on the long-term outcomes of brain necrosis lesions after bevacizumab treatment remain limited. In this case, cerebral edema was successfully controlled without the use of steroids for 44 months after the final dose of bevacizumab. Bevacizumab may represent a valid treatment option for patients with symptomatic brain necrosis, especially in cases where the long-term side effects of corticosteroids are a concern.
