We highlight fetal membrane and placental biology, OoC history and background, and the designs of reproductive OoC platforms. Reproductive OoC designs include fetal membrane models such as the Fetal Membrane-on-a-chip (FMOC) and others, placental models such as the placenta on-a-chip, and full reproductive tract models such as EVATAR. Diverse fabrication strategies and the integration of multiple model materials are explored. OoC samples can be analyzed with many analytical techniques, including mass spectrometry, fluorescence microscopy, ELISAs, impedance spectroscopy, and electrochemical techniques. The future of reproductive OoC models is a promising technology for advancing preterm birth (PTB) research, pharmacology studies, and fertility technologies. organ-on-chip fetal membrane on-a-chip microfluidic fetal membranes placenta female reproductive tract pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1 Introduction Every year approximately 15 million infants are born preterm—before completing 37 weeks of gestation—making preterm birth (PTB) and PTB-related complications the leading cause of death among children worldwide ( Walani, 2020 Liu et al., 2015 Wikswo, 2014 Young and Huh, 2021 Reproductive OoC technologies are an emerging method for examining fetal membrane and placental biology. Fetal membrane and placental development and their supportive functions are key components in fetal maturation. This development can be displayed and manipulated in OoC platforms. The fetal membranes and the placenta interact through the fetal-maternal interfaces, the amniochorion-decidua parietalis and the placenta-decidua basalis, making study of the two organs in a single model advantageous. Likewise, while the reproductive organs are interconnected at the fetal-maternal interfaces, the placenta and the fetal membranes are two different organs with distinct activities and compartments. The functional and biological differentiation of the placenta and fetal membranes makes individual study of the two organ models viable. OoC platforms, including the fetal membrane on-a-chip (FMOC), placenta on-a-chip, and multi-reproductive organs ona-chip, are designed to mimic the cellular environment in vivo Lachaux et al., 2017 Ochs et al., 2014 in vivo Srivastava et al., 2024 OoC models can be paired with a wide range of analytical instrumentation to identify immune responses and to monitor transport mechanisms. Analytical methods can be as direct as fluorescence microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to more indirect techniques including high resolution-mass spectrometry and impedance spectroscopy. Analytical detection can be oriented in-line with the OoC or the sample can be removed from the model system for off-line data collection. For example, an off-line analysis could include a sample being removed from the OoC and being analyzed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ( Pemathilaka et al., 2019a Schuller et al., 2020 in vivo In this review, we describe fetal membrane and placental biology and provide background on human embryogenesis and the supportive structure of the reproductive organs. We explore OoC history, recent fetal membrane on-a-chip, placenta on-a-chip, reproductive tract on-a-chip, and in vitro in vitro 2 Human embryogenesis & fetal membrane biology Human embryogenesis is an intricate process that begins with an egg and sperm and ends with a fetus. The process initiates with the fertilization of an oocyte with sperm to form a double zygote, which divides and replicates ( Gerri et al., 2020 Gerri et al., 2020 Gerri et al., 2020 The blastocyst compartments include (1) trophoblast cells and (2) the inner cell mass ( Rossant and Tam, 2022 Rossant and Tam, 2022 Rossant and Tam, 2022 Figure 1 Often called the fetal membrane (singular), the trophoblast cells divide into the four extra-embryonic membranes—the amnion and chorion membranes, the yolk sac, and the umbilical cord ( Carlson, 2023 Herrick and Bordoni, 2023 Richardson and Menon, 2022 Carlson, 2023 Figure 1 Carlson, 2023 Lei et al., 2017 Shahbazi, 2020 Figure 1 Lei et al., 2017 Lei et al., 2017 Figure 1 Figure 1 Menon and Richardson, 2017 Hafez, 2017 Bazer and Johnson, 2018 Figure 1 3 Placental biology The placenta develops from the placental cytotrophoblast to form the syncytium and cytotrophoblast subsets that include villous, extravillous, and syncytiotrophoblasts ( Carlson, 2023 Herrick and Bordoni, 2023 Carlson, 2023 Herrick and Bordoni, 2023 Herrick and Bordoni, 2023 Carlson, 2023 Yin et al., 2024 Carlson, 2023 Yin et al., 2024 The decidua is a temporary organ that is shed with the placenta after birth. It comes from the endometrium, the membrane lining of the uterus, and has three sections—the decidua capsularis, decidua parietalis, and decidua basalis ( Carlson, 2023 Yin et al., 2024 Balasundaram and Farhana, 2023 The placenta’s primary function is to supply the growing fetus with hormones, oxygen, nutrients, and waste removal via transport and metabolic pathways ( Gude et al., 2004 Cindrova-Davies and Sferruzzi-Perri, 2022 Burton and Fowden, 2015 Zhou et al., 2023 Burton et al., 2016 Placental and fetal membrane organs are non-redundant. While interconnected, the placenta and the fetal membranes are separate organs ( Figure 2 Kay et al., 2011 Bischof and Irminger-Finger, 2005 Insausti et al., 2014 PTB and PPROM is often stimulated by factors such as mother’s age, weight, prenatal care, smoking, alcohol, drug abuse, hypertension or acute chorioamnionitis (CAM) ( Halimiasl et al., 2017 Eastman et al., 2022 Hastings-Tolsma et al., 2013 Czikk et al., 2011 Jain et al., 2022 Conde-Agudelo et al., 2020 in-utero Redline, 2012 4 OoC background External platforms that mimic fetal organs, such as reproductive OoC models, are well poised to be the frontier of reproductive research. Through reproductive research platforms, placental transport studies could provide deeper insight into drug transport mechanisms ( Ma et al., 2021 Annas and Sherman, 1999 Arumugasaamy et al., 2020 Annas and Sherman, 1999 Dally, 1998 Richardson et al., 2020a Ultrasound technology and 2D culture were revolutionizing techniques that altered the progression of research at their time. Ultrasound technology is used as a low-risk technique that allows for image investigations of the fetal-maternal functions, but it fails to show cellular or mechanistic functions. To examine cell functions directly, 2D cell culture—which is the growth of a monolayer of cells on the surface of a culture flask or petri dish—provided a beneficial foundation for basic concepts. 2D cell culture became widely popular in the 1950s with the establishment of the immortal HeLa cell line, leading to the advanced understanding of disease pathways, drug designs, and toxicology ( Singh et al., 2022 Richardson et al., 2020a Duval et al., 2017 Jensen and Teng, 2020 Sun et al., 2021 in vivo Bédard et al., 2020 Animal experiments involve ethically using an animal model, typically mice or rodents, to conduct scientific research. Animal models do display complex biochemical interactions and serve as a useful tool for scientific advancements—such as the development of the polio vaccine with monkeys ( Robinson et al., 2019 Castle et al., 1998 Barré-Sinoussi and Montagutelli, 2015 Van Norman, 2019 Gerri et al., 2020 Barry and Anthony, 2008 Carter, 2020 Maltepe et al., 2010 Carter, 2020 Maltepe et al., 2010 Carter, 2020 Maltepe et al., 2010 3D cell culture grew in popularity in the late twentieth century. The first OoC platform was a lung-on-a-chip model developed in 2010 by Donald E. Ingber and co-workers ( Sood et al., 2023 Herreros et al., 2022 Amirifar et al., 2022 Liu et al., 2022 Dalsbecker et al., 2022 Jastrzebska et al., 2016 Abulaiti et al., 2020 Lee et al., 2018 Ferreira et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2022 Ashammakhi et al., 2018 Sharma et al., 2021 Galateanu et al., 2022 Sosa-Hernández et al., 2018 Zarrintaj et al., 2022 Picollet-D’hahan et al., 2021 Ingber, 2022 Safarzadeh et al., 2024a 5 OoC models In this review, we describe 20 reproductive OoC platforms published after 2017, as previously written reviews have investigated preceding devices ( Richardson et al., 2020a Gnecco et al., 2018 Elzinga et al., 2023 Table 1 6 Fetal membrane models The fetal membrane on-a-chips (FMOC) are platforms modeled after OoC technology that incorporates various combinations of the amnion and choriodecidual tissues onto a substrate of choice. Different conditions, stressors, and toxins can be introduced into the platform, and the transport mechanisms and immune responses can be examined through various analytical instrumentation techniques. The goal is that FMOC researchers can replicate enough aspects of the reproductive system to advance current mechanistic understandings. Previous reviews by Gnecco et al. and Eastman et al. briefly highlight FMOC methods and an instrumented fetal membrane on-a-chip (IFMOC) ( Eastman et al., 2022 Gnecco et al., 2018 Streptococcus Eastman et al., 2022 Eastman et al., 2022 Figure 3 The PDMS butterfly model has been fabricated based upon 3D printing techniques previously described by O’Grady and co-workers ( O’Grady et al., 2021 Richardson, Menon, and coworkers have significantly contributed to the field with numerous studies incorporating the amnion fetal membrane, specifically the development of the amnion membrane organ-on-chip (AM-OOC) model. The AM-OOC was composed of two chambers connected by type IV collagen-coated microchannels to examine the interactive and transition properties of primary human amnion epithelial cells (AECs) and amnion mesenchymal cells (AMCs) ( Richardson et al., 2019 in vivo Richardson et al., 2019 Richardson et al., 2019 In 2020 Richardson et al. then utilized cigarette smoke extract and dioxin to compare traditional transwell culture systems and a repurposed two-chamber fetal membrane organ-on-chip device previously fabricated by Gnecco et al ( Gnecco et al., 2018 Richardson et al., 2020c Richardson et al., 2020c Richardson et al., 2020c Next, Richardson et al., in 2020 published an updated platform modeling ascending infection of E. coli coli Figure 4 Richardson et al., 2020b Richardson et al., 2020b The fabrication materials were similar to previous developments, but each cell layer or chamber was interconnected through an array of 24 microchannels to provide a series of microbiological functions ( Richardson et al., 2020b Richardson et al., 2020b Richardson et al., 2020b Richardson et al., 2020b Advancing this study was a 2021 publication by Radnaa et al. incorporating the recently constructed FMi-OOC to investigate fetal-maternal signaling. The work focused on fetal-maternal signals that initiate parturition with the protein HMGB1, which is associated with PTB ( Radnaa et al., 2021 Radnaa et al., 2021 Radnaa et al., 2021 Radnaa et al., 2021 Radnaa et al., 2021 In 2022, Kim et al. published on the efficacy of the four-chamber FMi-OOC system to study the response of an environmental toxin cadmium on the fetal membranes ( Kim et al., 2022 Kim et al., 2022 Kim et al., 2022 Kim et al., 2022 Kim et al., 2022 Kim et al., 2022 Ganguly et al., in 2021 and Richardson et al., in 2022 utilized the FMi-OOC model again to investigate organic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1 (OATP2B1) ( Ganguly et al., 2021 Richardson et al., 2022 Ganguly et al., 2021 Richardson et al., 2022 Studies of the fetal-maternal interface including the amniochorion and decidua are new and important areas of research. It is arguably one of the most vital biological pathways and medical intervention methods for this region are scarce. An area of study more commonly investigated for drug development is the human placenta and the mechanisms within its fetal-maternal interface as mimicked on a placenta OoC. 7 Placenta on-a-chip models As with the FMOC, various groups have created placenta on-a-chip platforms with different membrane materials to mimic various aspects of the placenta ( Pemathilaka et al., 2019b Cherubini et al., 2021 Cho et al., 2021 Gnecco et al., 2018 Elzinga et al., 2023 Pemathilaka et al., 2019c Lee et al., 2016 Mandt et al., in 2018 created a custom placenta membrane barrier for a 3D placenta on-a-chip model using 3D printing techniques. The chip was created with poly-(ethylene glycol)-dimethacrylate, glass plates, and PDMS spacers. The barrier was fabricated using high resolution two-photon polymerization (2PP) and cell biocompatibility and cellular barrier response was investigated. Within this design, 2PP was advantageous for creating micrometer precision barrier structures to precisely mimic the placental barrier microenvironment ( Mandt et al., 2024 Mandt et al., 2024 Mandt et al., 2024 Mandt et al., 2024 Mandt et al., 2024 In 2019, Pemathilaka et al. used a placenta-on-a-chip model to investigate caffeine transport across the placental barrier. Caffeine concentration was quantified on the fetal side of the placental barrier after being introduced on the maternal side via high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS-MS) ( Pemathilaka et al., 2019a Pemathilaka et al., 2019a in vivo Another transport study was conducted in 2020 by Mosavati and coworkers investigating glucose diffusion across an experimental placenta-on-a-chip membrane and a numerical 3D model ( Mosavati et al., 2020 Mosavati et al., 2020 Mosavati et al., 2020 Mosavati et al., 2020 In 2022 this same group examined nutrient exchange and glucose transport during infection using a placenta-on-a-chip model ( Mosavati et al., 2022 Mosavati et al., 2022 Mosavati et al., 2022 P. falciparum Mosavati et al., 2022 Mosavati et al., 2022 In 2023 Ghorbanpour et al. also used a commercial 3D placenta-on-a-chip model, this time to investigate immune responses during preeclampsia ( Ghorbanpour et al., 2023 Ghorbanpour et al., 2023 Ghorbanpour et al., 2023 Ghorbanpour et al., 2023 Another commercial 3D microfluidic chip comparative analysis was conducted by Pu et al., in 2021 to evaluate fetal trophoblast invasion with various matrix materials ( Pu et al., 2021 Pu et al., 2021 Pu et al., 2021 Pu et al., 2021 Cho et al., 2021 Biglari et al., 2019 Utagawa et al., 2022 McCain et al., 2014 Pitingolo et al., 2019 Leung et al., 2022 Nahak et al., 2022 Shyam et al., 2023 In 2022 Ko et al. used a gel-patterned system to analyze the changes in cell mobility with differences in oxygen concentration. While most devices primarily use PDMS for its low stiffness and oxygen control capabilities, the microfluidic chip in this experiment was fabricated with gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) to examine cell movement within a high stiffness material. The design consisted of microfluidic chambers stacked vertically with GelMA solution injected into the chamber for gel patterning ( Ko et al., 2022 Ko et al., 2022 Cho et al., 2021 In 2020, Schuller et al. conducted a nano-risk assessment of the placental barrier with the three most encountered nanoparticles ( Schuller et al., 2020 Figure 5 Schuller et al., 2020 The nano-risk assessment was conducted using silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, and zinc oxide, all which could potentially cause adverse effects in humans ( Schuller et al., 2020 Schuller et al., 2020 Schuller et al., 2020 in vivo Recently in 2024, Hori et al. also utilized TEER to examine mother to fetus barrier function of syncyotiotrophoblast cells formed from trophoblast organoids using human trophoblast stem (TS) cells ( Hori et al., 2024 Hori et al., 2024 Hori et al., 2024 Hori et al., 2024 Lermant et al., 2023 Lermant et al., 2023 The works described within utilized customized commercial chips and distinctive model designs to enhance placental barrier transport studies. To our knowledge, at the time of this review the placenta on-a-chip has yet to be used in a clinical trial that led to an approved FDA drug, but optimizing placenta on-a-chip fabrication conditions and transport studies pushes the field towards that desired outcome. Furthermore, while the most recent placenta OoC developments are highly promising, it is crucial to incorporate multi-reproductive organ models to precisely mimic cell crosstalk between multiple cell layers. Few studies have developed multi-reproductive organ models as that design must be highly intricate to recapitulate the full reproductive system. Laboratories which have developed multi-reproductive OoC platforms have greatly contributed to a largely understudied area. 8 Multiple reproductive OoC models Human reproduction is an elaborate event in which specialized tissues and organs collaboratively, yet independently support fetal development. Advancing the understanding of this process has led to the design of new technologies, such as multi-reproductive organ models. Once impregnated, the amniotic sac, yolk sac, umbilical cord, and placenta develop with unique interconnected cellular crosstalk, which can be modeled in microfluidic platforms such as the reproductive tract on-a-chip. In 2017 Xiao et al. published on the development of their microfluidic platform, EVATAR, which stimulates the in vivo Xiao et al., 2017 in vitro Figure 6 Xiao et al., 2017 The authors determined that the systems supported the investigation of cytokine expression, pregnancy-like hormone control, and liver metabolic studies ( Xiao et al., 2017 Reardon, 2017 Unlike any of the previously mentioned experiments, a study by Tantengco et al., in 2022 combines a vagina-cervix-decidua organ on-a-chip (VCD-OOC) and a four-chamber FMi-OOC model ( Tantengco et al., 2022 U. parvum Ureaplasma parvum Tantengco et al., 2022 Tantengco et al., 2022 Tantengco et al., 2022 Tantengco et al., 2022 U. parvum Tantengco et al., 2022 Tantengco et al., 2022 Tantengco et al., 2022 U. parvum Tantengco et al., 2022 Recently, Menon and coworkers have integrated their models to form a multi-organ feto-maternal interface on-a-chip, termed the FMi-PLA-OOC ( Safarzadeh et al., 2024b Kammala et al., 2023 Kammala et al., 2023 Safarzadeh et al., 2024b Safarzadeh et al., 2024b An early pioneer of organ on-a-chip modeling, Ingber, Mahajan, and coworkers, have developed a vagina on-a-chip to model vaginal microbiome-host interactions, such as that of anaerobic bacteria species found in bacterial vaginosis (BV) ( Mahajan et al., 2022 Mahajan et al., 2022 L. crispatus Gardnerella vaginalis Mahajan et al., 2022 Izadifar et al., 2024 Izadifar et al., 2024 Mahajan et al., 2022 in vivo Izadifar et al., 2024 The use of microfluidic modeling has largely advanced reproductive and IVF-related research, but many studies have yet to include the addition of sperm into female reproductive tract models. In 2024, Yaghoobi et al. published on the use of a female reproductive tract conditioned model to examine sperm separation for superior in vitro Yaghoobi et al., 2024 Yaghoobi et al., 2024 Yaghoobi et al., 2024 Described herein are a selection of experiments which work to recreate the reproductive system, placenta, and fetal membranes through models such as EVATAR, VCD-OOC, placenta on-a-chip, and fetal membranes on-a-chip. While there are numerous studies utilizing these 3D platforms, the field is highly specialized and is a unique niche within reproductive studies. These models have proven advantageous as a research tool, and with the passing of the 2023 United States FDA Modernization Act, experimental drugs can now be experimented on non-animal research alternatives including organ on-a-chip modeling ( Sunildutt et al., 2023 Marr et al., 2023 Safarzadeh et al., 2024b Blumenrath et al., 2020 9 Final remarks on fabrication strategies, transport mechanisms, immunology, and future directions OoC models are fabricated with a variety of materials and advanced printing techniques. Materials for organotypic platforms are typically polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), glass, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) or polycarbonate (PC) ( Cho et al., 2021 Banik et al., 2022 Cameron et al., 2022 Zhang et al., 2022 Eastman et al., 2022 Gnecco et al., 2018 Richardson et al., 2019 Richardson et al., 2020b Richardson et al., 2020c Radnaa et al., 2021 Kim et al., 2022 Ganguly et al., 2021 Mosavati et al., 2020 Pu et al., 2021 Ko et al., 2022 Tantengco et al., 2022 Pemathilaka et al., 2019b Cho et al., 2021 Gnecco et al., 2017 Schuller et al., 2020 Mandt et al., 2024 Mosavati et al., 2022 Ghorbanpour et al., 2023 Xiao et al., 2017 O’Grady et al., 2021 Leung et al., 2022 in vivo Pu et al., 2021 Biglari et al., 2019 Utagawa et al., 2022 Pitingolo et al., 2019 McClain et al., 2019 OoC models aim to address transport mechanisms and biomarker pathways. Transport mechanisms hold special value in discovering how infection ascends and how inflammatory biomarkers are triggered ( Richardson et al., 2020b Hansen-Pupp et al., 2005 Zhu et al., 2018 Korir et al., 2022 Pemathilaka et al., 2019a Mosavati et al., 2022 Dusza et al., 2023 Mandt et al., 2024 Mosavati et al., 2022 Pemathilaka et al., 2019b Pemathilaka et al., 2022 Pemathilaka et al., 2019a Schuller et al., 2020 Eastman et al., 2022 Richardson et al., 2019 Richardson et al., 2020c Richardson et al., 2020b Radnaa et al., 2021 Kim et al., 2022 Ganguly et al., 2021 Mandt et al., 2024 Mosavati et al., 2020 Mosavati et al., 2022 Pu et al., 2021 Tantengco et al., 2022 Cho et al., 2021 Gnecco et al., 2017 Immune responses due to foreign metabolites are a main component of OoC studies. Immune responses such as enzyme secretion ( Cho et al., 2021 Eastman et al., 2022 Korir et al., 2022 Richardson et al., 2020b Radnaa et al., 2021 Ghorbanpour et al., 2023 Xiao et al., 2017 Omere et al., 2020 Schuller et al., 2020 Richardson et al., 2019 Kim et al., 2022 Ganguly et al., 2021 Tantengco et al., 2022 Eastman et al., 2022 Gnecco et al., 2018 Ghorbanpour et al., 2023 Eastman et al., 2021 in vivo Fabrication strategies, transport mechanisms, and immunology studies are key aspects within each work reviewed here. With versatile OoC designs, models can be manipulated to study complex transport mechanisms across different cell compartments, and subsequently, the immune responses to these interactions are directly investigated. Overall, OoC technology is a novel and modern innovation to traditional research modeling that pushes reproductive investigations forward. The future of OoC modeling is optimistic with avenues for further study in areas ranging from the incorporation of pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to full human models ( Sunildutt et al., 2023 Sunildutt et al., 2023 Blumenrath et al., 2020 Richardson et al., 2022 Mahajan et al., 2022 10 Conclusion In this review, we explored fetal membrane and placental biology, OoC history, and recent reproductive OoC designs and advancements. We provided background on human embryogenesis and the supportive function and structure of the fetal membranes and placenta. Reproductive OoC designs encompass fetal membrane models including the FMOC, placental models including the placenta on-a-chip, and full reproductive tract models including the EVATAR. Within these OoC models, we noted the applications they aim to address, such as transport mechanisms and immunology. Advancements to fabrication strategies are highlighted, including the use of modern printing and model designs. Analytical techniques utilized with OoC technology are wide ranging and we provided mass spectrometry, fluorescence microscopy, ELISAs, and impedance spectroscopy examples. Future research opportunities involve overcoming current OoC limitations such as developing universal cell culture medium and reusable materials, while lowering fabrication costs ( Mahajan et al., 2022 Farhang Doost and Srivastava, 2024 in vitro Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Breck Owens for contributions to Figure 3 Funding The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.
