However, the exact causal association between LC and UCs remains obscure. Methods A two‐sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and the Genetic Risk Scores (GRS) method were used to assess the genetic relationships between LC and UCs. The risk of second primary cancer (SPC) was validated using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Results MR analysis demonstrated genetic associations between overall LC and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (overall LC: OR [95% CI] = 1.214 [1.003–1.469], p p p p Conclusions The MR study identified genetic associations between LC and UCs, revealing an elevated risk of SPC‐RCC after primary LC (PLC), particularly LUAD. This study lays a foundation for SPC‐RCC prevention after PLC, indicating the necessity of enhanced surveillance of PLC patients in clinical practice and further research into the shared biological pathways to provide innovative therapeutic alternatives.

This comprehensive analysis of potential connections between these cancers provides insights into shared and distinct etiological factors that could enhance prevention and treatment strategies. Further, extending the comprehension of the underlying etiological mechanisms through validation with SEER population‐based data can potentially guide future cancer prevention and treatment initiatives. 2 Methods 2.1 Study Design Figure 1 9 12 FIGURE 1 Study design and overview of Mendelian randomization (MR) study.

The study sample was restricted to a specific European population. Summary statistics for LC were obtained from the GWAS Catalog ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/home 13 https://www.finngen.fi/en 2.3 Selection of IVs Genetic IVs for LC and UCs were constructed based on the following criteria: (a) considering the limited availability of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SNPs were selected with a threshold of p −6 r 2 F 14 https://ldlink.nih.gov/?tab=ldtrait https://gwas.mrcieu.ac.uk/ 2.4  MR The main strategy employed in this study was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method to evaluate the bidirectional causal relationship between LC and UCs for the MR analyses. Based on the meta‐analysis, the IVW method was the most prevalent and extensively employed for MR analysis. It combines ratio estimates of SNPs in an IVW manner to determine the effect of risk factors on outcomes [ 15 16 p 17 18 17 19 2.5 Sensitivity Analysis Given that the IVW method could be biased by pleiotropic and heterogeneous IVs, sensitivity analyses were conducted to reduce these effects in the causal estimates.

This study retrospectively recruited patients with LUAD, RCC, and second primary RCC (SPC‐RCC) after primary LUAD (PLUAD) from the SEER database and obtained the relevant clinicopathological data. The inclusion criteria were: (a) diagnosed from 2004 to 2015; (b) aged > 18 and < 90 years; (c) white race; and (d) diagnosis histologically confirmed as LUAD and RCC. The exclusion criteria were: (a) cases in which the second malignant tumor has the same histology as the first malignant tumor; (b) patients with unknown TNM staging (Tx, Nx, Mx) as per the 6th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage system; (c) the type of reporting source was “Autopsy only” or “Death certificate only”; (d) patients diagnosed with a SPC within 6 months of the onset of the first primary malignancy; and (e) incomplete information. The multiple primary standardized incidence ratios (MP‐SIR) were defined as the ratio of the observed incidence of a second cancer in patients previously diagnosed with a specific type of cancer to the expected incidence derived from the SEER reference population. All standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and their related 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were obtained using the “MP‐SIR” session of SEER*Stat (v 8.4.3) [ 24 25 26 27 p 3 Results 3.1 Selection and Validation of IVs The selection procedure for IVs in this study is illustrated in Figure 1 p −6 F S1 In the reverse MR analysis from UCs to LC, 17 RCC, 17 BCa, and 128 PCa SNPs were selected as IVs based on the following criteria: independence from LD, a genome‐wide significance threshold of p −6 F S1 3.2  MR LC UCs In forward‐direction MR, in the overall LC to RCC MR study, IVW revealed credible evidence that overall LC was associated with an increased risk of RCC at the genetic level (IVW: OR = 1.214; 95% CI 1.003–1.469, p 2A 3A p 2B 3B p 2C 3C p 2D 3D p 2E 3E p 2F 3F p 2H 3H p 2G 3G p 2I 3I p 2J 3J p 2K 3K p 2L 3L FIGURE 2 Forest plot of two‐sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study based on the MR method from LC to UCs.

This study performed a subgroup analysis of overall LC and found that LUAD was primarily responsible for the increased risk of RCC. Therefore, we further used the SEER database to verify the relationship between LUAD and RCC. The findings revealed that the possibility of developing a second primary RCC (SPC‐RCC) after detection of primary LUAD (PLUAD) was markedly elevated compared to a reference US population with comparable age and racial demographics (SIR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.02–1.51, AER = 1.08, p Table 2 p TABLE 2 Standardized incidence ratios and absolute excess risks of second primary RCC after various latencies from a diagnosis of primary LUAD.

Recent inventions in cancer management, screening, and treatments have considerably enhanced the access of patients with early‐stage cancers to effective and timely care, resulting in significant increases in long‐term survival rates. The incidence of SPCs has increased considerably in recent decades as life expectancy has increased and cancer survival durations have extended [ 28 29 30 17 The exact cause of SPC is still unknown, but observational studies suggest that there may be a correlation between environmental variables, genetic predisposition, and choices of lifestyle in SPC development [ 31 7 32 33 34 In the study, we systematically investigated for the first time the relationship between LC (overall LC, LUAD, LUSC, and SCLC) and UCs (RCC, BCa, and PCa) at the genetic level by a two‐sample MR approach. The findings indicated that both overall LC and LUAD were substantially correlated with RCC, and LUSC was associated with BCa. However, in the reverse MR analysis, we found no association between them. Moreover, a genetic association was identified between RCC and SCLC. Simultaneously, the results of the GRS method revealed a genetic correlation between overall LC and LUAD with RCC, as well as between RCC and both overall LC and SCLC. Therefore, based on the MR analysis and GRS approach findings, this study focused on the significant associations between overall LC and LUAD and the incidence of RCC. Following this, the SEER database was used to validate the correlation between PLUAD and SPC‐RCC. The findings demonstrated that the possibility of developing SPC‐RCC after a PLUAD diagnosis was markedly higher than estimated for the reference US population (SIR = 1.25), particularly within 6–11 months post‐diagnosis of PLUAD. Based on the SEER database, the study further investigated the differences in clinicopathological features between LUAD, RCC, and SPC‐RCC after PLUAD. The survival analysis results indicated no discernible difference between RCC and SPC‐RCC after PLUAD or between LUAD and SPC‐RCC after PLUAD. This implies that patients with PLUAD and associated SPC‐RCC should prioritize RCC treatment, minimizing intervention in PLUAD, and thus may not require intensive treatment. Therefore, it is crucial to provide guidance for clinical prevention and treatment. In comparison to the general population, individuals who were eligible for LC screening were 1.6 times more likely to be diagnosed with kidney cancer, as demonstrated by the current study. A comprehensive kidney and lung cancer screening program could identify up to 25% of kidney cancers, aligning with our conclusions: patients with PLUAD have a 1.25 times greater risk of developing a SPC‐RCC than the normal healthy population (SIR = 1.25) [ 35 13 36 37 38 39 SUSD2 SUSD2 40 41 SUSD2 There are several advantages in our MR study. Firstly, it is the first MR investigation to systematically assess the genetic association between LC and UCs based on large‐scale GWAS data. Compared to earlier observational studies, MR analysis may substantially reduce potential biases, such as confounders and reverse causality, thereby strengthening causal inference. Secondly, the GWAS datasets of LC and UCs were primarily derived from the populations of European ancestry, substantially reducing the impact of population stratification. Further, the extrapolation of the US population data from the SEER database was consistent with the MR analysis' findings, suggesting that the derived conclusions are reliable. Finally, in addition to employing the IVW method as the main analytical methodology, we utilized the GRS method as a supplementary secondary analysis in combination with the SEER database for further verification. To ensure precision in the results, multiple MR complementary methods were also used, including the weighted median, MR‐Egger, MR‐RAPS, and MR‐PRESSO methods. However, we would like to acknowledge some limitations in our study. Firstly, this MR study exclusively involved the European population, while the SEER database predominantly reflects the US population, potentially constraining the generalizability of the results to other demographics. Further research should aim to replicate these findings in varied communities, including Asian and African groups, to ensure wider applicability. Secondly, this study was unable to totally eliminate the effect of horizontal pleiotropy, despite the implementation of rigorous measures to find outlier variants and minimize horizontal pleiotropy. The complex and poorly comprehended biological functions of multiple genetic variants may be the source of residual pleiotropy. Thirdly, the statistical power was as high as 99% when the relationship between overall LC and RCC was investigated, whereas it was less than 80% in the study of LUAD and RCC. To verify the findings and ensure adequate statistical power, it is necessary to employ larger sample sizes and more advanced methodologies. Fourthly, the limited number of IVs led to the adoption of a lower p 5 Conclusions This study has identified a genetic association between LC and UCs, establishing a crucial foundation for the precise prevention of SPC‐RCC after PLUAD, indicating an urgent need for higher awareness about the occurrence of SPC‐RCC and the prompt implementation of intervention and treatment. Moreover, the findings highlight the need for further research into the biological pathways associated with these cancers. Functional studies exploring the role of shared genetic variants in carcinogenesis could yield new therapeutic targets, especially for comorbid patients with LUAD and RCC. Moreover, targeted therapies that address common genetic pathways may provide novel treatment options for this subgroup of cancer patients.
