Summary Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most common nosocomial infections, leading to significant morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. HAP is previously associated with dysbiosis of the microbiota. However, the composition of the lung virome and its role in HAP pathogenesis remain unclear. Here, we longitudinally analyze the endotracheal virome in 87 critically ill patients, including 48 with HAP. Within the virome dominated by Caudoviricetes In silico Streptococcus Prevotella NCT02003196 NCT04793568 Graphical abstract Highlights • Lung virome is dominated by Caudoviricetes • Respiratory virome converge toward lower beta-diversity up to 4 days before HAP • 66 bacteriophages differentiate HAP and no HAP patients in an independent cohort • Bacteriophages targeting Streptococcus Prevotella Anani et al. show that shifts in the lung virome of intubated critically ill patients, particularly involving bacteriophages, are associated with the onset of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), with changes in the viral-bacterial interactome detected prior to symptom onset.

A longitudinal study combining 16S rRNA gene sequencing of rectal swabs and single-cell profiling of blood samples revealed that microbiota and immune function dynamics during critical illness are strongly interdependent. Intestinal dysbiosis was associated with compromised host defenses and increased susceptibility to HAP induction. 2 Fusobacterium Haemophilus Prevotella Streptococcus Veillonella 3 , 4 In addition to the technical challenges associated with virome studies, the lung virome is particularly difficult to characterize due to the risk of environmental contamination in clinical respiratory samples, 5 , 6 4 7 Anelloviridae 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 13 , 14 Because of the role of the gut virome in the pathogenesis of human infections, we hypothesized that studying the respiratory virome response to critical illness would increase our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAP. The aim of this study was therefore to characterize the dynamics of the respiratory virome in ICU patients in relation to different HAP susceptibilities. Results Clinical characteristics of the study population We analyzed 121 endotracheal samples from 87 intubated brain-injured patients admitted in ICU from the Immunology and Brain Injury Study (IBIS). Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes are described in Table S1 Table S1 Lung virome composition in critically ill patients Viral metagenomic sequencing was divided into four independent batches with a total of 42 sequencing controls (empty and MS2-spiked non-template controls to assess the risk of contamination along the process), and no batch effect was detected (Adonis permutation test, p p p Figure S1 Table S1 de novo Table S2 Table S2 Table S1 At ICU admission, we observed that the delay (in days) between HAP onset and sample collection had the largest effect on lung virome composition, accounting for 37% of the variation, followed by ARDS (20%) and HAP (17%), all of which showed significant effects (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted p Table S1 Data S1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Respiratory virome in critically ill patients (A and B) Effect size of metadata factors on lung virome variation at ICU admission (A) and during ICU stay (B).

We compared beta-diversity between specimens collected from a same patient (intra-patient) and from different patients (inter-patient) using three different indices: weighted Bray-Curtis and Hellinger to calculate distances based on viral abundance and Sorensen to account for viral presence-absence ( Tables S3 S4 Figure 1 p p p Figure 1 Inter-patient respiratory virome diversity decreased in patients with HAP To explore the global composition of endotracheal virome in relation to clinical outcome, we first studied differences between HAP and no HAP patients’ viromes at the alpha- and beta-diversity levels.

Therefore, we excluded samples from patients with HAP who already had HAP upon sampling and restricted the analysis to the first endotracheal aspirate in ICU patients who would later develop HAP (upcoming HAP group) and those without later documented HAP (no HAP group). Again, the virome alpha-diversity was not different between upcoming HAP and no HAP patients ( Figures 3 p 2 Figure 3 p Figure 3 p Figure 3 Figure 3 Virome diversity schemes of upcoming HAP and no HAP patients before the beginning of HAP (A) Shannon index in all samples in dotplots (Wilcoxon test, p (B) vOTU richness in all samples in dotplots (Wilcoxon test, p (C) PCoA of Bray-Curtis distance characterizing the clustering between samples of upcoming HAP and no HAP patients.

We followed a sliding window spanning 2 days with a 1-day step between each window, counting backwards from HAP onset for cases and from median day of HAP onset (fourth day after ICU admission) for controls ( Figure S9 Figure 4 Figure 4 Table S5 Figures 4 S10 Table S6 Figure 4 Figure 4 Respiratory virome convergence before HAP onset and its interactions with the healthy respiratory microbiota (A) Median of weighted Bray-Curtis (left), Hellinger (central), and Sorensen (right) dissimilarities between upcoming HAP (pink) and no HAP (blue) in sliding window timing before the HAP onset (window of 2 days with a 1-day step).

We analyzed samples from the PREV-HAP (preventive hospital-acquired-pneumonia) multicenter, randomized clinical trial, which tested interferon-gamma for the prevention of HAP in critically ill patients. 17 Data S1 Table S7 Figure S9 Table S7 Tables S7 S8 Consistent with our previous results and among the 29,821 vOTUs identified in this cohort ( Table S8 Caudoviricetes 10 Figures 5 S14 Table S9 Caudoviricetes Figure S15 Table S9 Anelloviridae 10 Circoviridae 10 Figures 5 S15 Figure 5 Validation of the viral convergence prior to the onset of HAP in an independent cohort (A) Heatmap showing the top 30 viral genera forming the respiratory virome (values expressed in log 10 (B) Median of weighted Bray-Curtis, Hellinger, and Sorensen dissimilarities in upcoming and no HAP patients during the sliding window 5–3 days before HAP onset.

Statistical significance was assessed by a two-sided Mann-Whitney U-test. Data from 58 to 30 endotracheal samples were used. Bray-Curtis, Sorensen, and Hellinger distances were used in (B). In this validation cohort, since endotracheal specimens from patients with HAP were not available 4 days prior to HAP onset, we extended the sliding windows for dissimilarity analysis. The median dissimilarity indices in the upcoming HAP group were all lower than those in the no HAP group within the 5–3 day sliding window (Wilcoxon test p p Figure 5 Tables S9 S10 Caudoviricetes Validation of the HAP-associated bacteriophage signature To evaluate the ability of the viral signature from the discovery cohort to predict HAP cases in the validation cohort, we first sought whether vOTUs of the viral signature identified in the IBIS cohort were also present in the PREV-HAP cohort. Using a BLASTn analysis, we identified 121/571 (21%) vOTUs of the whole viral signature from the IBIS cohort as present within the virome of PREV-HAP pre-onset samples with alignments greater than 500 bp and a median sequence identity percentage of 91% (IQR: 86%–95%). By focusing on the bacteriophages, this represented 84/455 (18%) vOTUs of the bacteriophage signature from IBIS conserved in PREV-HAP pre-onset samples (median sequence identity percentage of 92%; IQR: 89%–96%) ( Figure 6 Table S11 Caudoviricetes Figure 6 16 Mogibacterium Veillonella Prevotella Figure 6 Table S12 Figure 6 Figure 6 Validation of the bacteriophage signature (A) BLASTn-based similarity analysis of sequence identity between discovery cohort viral signature and validation cohort virome data.

We identified specific viral signatures preceding HAP onset, consisting mainly of Caudoviricetes High interpersonal variability of the lung virome was observed in adult patients hospitalized in ICU. These findings are in accordance with those previously observed in the gut virome of healthy or diseased adults 20 , 21 , 22 13 Caudoviricetes Alphatorquevirus Anelloviridae Anelloviridae 23 24 Picornaviridae Redondoviridae Redondoviridae Torbevirus 25 Data S1 Enterovirus Picornaviridae 26 Despite the complex variability in respiratory virome communities, we demonstrated a robust lung viral convergence as defined by a decrease in viral population dissimilarity up to 3 days before the onset of HAP. Virome convergence and viral signatures specific to HAP onset were mainly driven by Caudoviricetes 7 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 24 , 32 7 Caudoviricetes Caudoviricetes 33 13 Viral convergence was lost at and after HAP onset, which may be related to different bacterial etiologies of pneumonia and different antibiotic treatments. Specifically, we found that antibiotics can affect the diversity of the lung virome, consistent with previous findings in the gut. 34 35 E coli Staphylococcus E coli In a recent meta-analysis of 738 critically ill patients with HAP from seven different studies, Montassier and colleagues defined and validated an HAP-associated signature in the respiratory bacteriome characterized by a decreased abundance of the healthy microbiota. 3 Streptococcus Prevotella Caudoviricetes Streptococcus Prevotella 3 7 12 33 From a therapeutic perspective, we can speculate that specific measures could be taken to maintain respiratory microbiome eubiosis and prevent HAP induction through bacteriophage intervention. This could be done by avoiding environmental stressors or specific antibiotics that can activate prophages and stimulate the lysogenic-lytic lifestyle switch as shown for Prevotella Streptococcus 36 , 37 38 , 39 , 40 41 Caudoviricetes in vitro 42 , 43 , 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 Overall, achieving and maintaining equilibrium in virome-bacteriome associations within the respiratory microbiome is challenging because it is influenced by dynamic interactions between the immune system, bacteria, bacteriophages, and their environment. Understanding these complex dynamics is critical to elucidating the principles of microbiome stability and avoiding HAP induction. In conclusion, our analysis revealed the composition of the lung virome in critically ill patients and suggested a potential role of the virome in the pathophysiology of HAP. We identified a specific viral dysbiotic signature up to 3 days before HAP induction that targets beneficial bacteria and may cause the lung bacterial dysbiosis involved in HAP. This work significantly advances our understanding of HAP pathophysiology in relation to the lung virome and bacteriome. Limitations of the study This study has some limitations. First, the sample size was limited, especially in the sliding windows during the pre-onset period; in particular, in the external cohort, where only 21% of patients had HAP, validation in the HAP convergence window was limited to four patients with HAP and nine without HAP. Secondly, validation of the signature was limited to 18% of the training signature. Because of high individuality of the virome at the strain level, identification of signature at the genus or family level might help to identify conserved biomarkers. 33 in vivo Resource availability Lead contact Further information should be requested from the lead contact, Dr. Laurence Josset ( laurence.josset@chu-lyon.fr ).

Based on the vOTUs dRPKM matrix, Shannon index and richness plots were generated using ggplot2 v3.5.0. LOESS regression was used to generate trend lines and 95% confidence bands. Analyses prior to the onset of HAP were carried out by counting backwards from a defined day 0 for each patient. This day 0 corresponded to the time of HAP onset in each case, and as the median day of HAP onset after ICU admission in all control patients. Longitudinal plots were based on a sliding window with a window size of two days, with one day overlap between windows.
