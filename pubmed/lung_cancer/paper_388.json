Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism influences tumor progression, yet its role in melanoma subtypes and clinical outcomes is unclear. This study aims to delineate melanoma subgroups driven by SCFA metabolic dysregulation and identify mechanisms underlying their aggressiveness. Methods Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), we clustered 468 TCGA melanoma samples into six subgroups based on SCFA-related gene sets (GO:0019745, GO:0019746, GO:0006085). Survival, differential expression, and pathway analyses were performed to characterize high-risk subgroups. Key drivers were validated via CRISPR/Cas9, siRNA knockdown, and immunohistochemistry. Single-cell RNA-seq ( GSE215120 Results NMF clustering revealing a high-risk subtype (Group 6) with dysregulated short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism and poor survival. Group 6 exhibited upregulation of GLTP and RAPGEFL1, enrichment in melanogenesis, Hippo signaling, and skin/lipid metabolism pathways. Through integrative analysis, TEAD3 emerged as a key risk driver, with high expression correlating with poor prognosis. Functional validation demonstrated that TEAD3 knockout suppressed melanoma proliferation, migration, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing of acral melanoma revealed TEAD3-enriched tumor cells interacting with M2 macrophages via the GAS6-TYRO3 axis. Mechanistically, GAS6 + macrophages exhibited hypermetabolic phenotypes (elevated glycolysis/OXPHOS) that fueled GAS6 secretion. GAS6-TYRO3 signaling in TEAD3 + cells drove tumor aggressiveness by rewiring propionate metabolism, inducing methylmalonic acid accumulation via Mmut upregulation. Targeting this axis in myeloid-specific GAS6 knockout mice enhanced anti-PD-1 efficacy, boosting CD8 + T cell infiltration and survival. Conclusion We define a TEAD3-driven melanoma subtype reliant on SCFA metabolic reprogramming and M2 macrophage crosstalk. The GAS6-TYRO3 axis and Mmut-mediated methylmalonic acid accumulation represent actionable targets. Combining myeloid-GAS6 ablation with immune checkpoint blockade overcomes therapy resistance, offering a precision strategy for high-risk melanoma.

On one hand, SCFAs can exert anti-tumor effects by modulating immune cell activity and enhancing anti-tumor immunity [ 6 7 8 The heterogeneity of melanoma cells is a hallmark of the disease and a major contributor to its aggressiveness and therapeutic resistance. Melanoma tumors are composed of distinct subpopulations of cancer cells with diverse genetic, epigenetic, and phenotypic profiles [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 The dynamic interplay between melanoma cells and the TME further exacerbates tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. Among the immune cells within the TME, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in shaping the tumor landscape. TAMs are known to adopt a pro-tumorigenic (M2-like) phenotype, secreting cytokines and growth factors that enhance tumor cell survival, angiogenesis, and immune evasion [ 16 17 18 19 20 Despite significant advances in melanoma treatment, including the development of BRAF/MEK inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockers, therapeutic resistance remains a major obstacle. Targeted therapies, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib, have shown remarkable efficacy in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma; however, resistance often develops due to the activation of alternative signaling pathways or the emergence of resistant subclones [ 21 22 23 Methods Data acquisition and preprocessing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 468 melanoma patients were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database ( https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ GSE215120 Identification of melanoma subgroups Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering was performed using the R package NMF (v0.25.0) to stratify melanoma patients into subgroups based on gene expression profiles. The optimal number of clusters (k = 6) was determined by evaluating the cophenetic coefficient across a range of k values (k = 2 to 10). Short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-related gene sets (GO:0019745, GO:0019746, and GO:0006085) were downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) and used to further refine the clustering. Differential gene expression analysis between subgroups was conducted using the DESeq2 R package (v1.38.0). Genes with a fold change > 2 and an adjusted p-value < 0.05 (Benjamini-Hochberg correction) were considered significantly differentially expressed. Functional enrichment analysis Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using the clusterProfiler R package (v4.6.0) to identify enriched pathways in high-risk melanoma subgroups. The GSEA algorithm was run with 1,000 permutations, and pathways with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched. KEGG pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were conducted using the enrichKEGG and enrichGO functions, respectively, with a significance threshold of FDR < 0.05. Visualization of enriched pathways was performed using the dotplot and cnetplot functions. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis scRNA-seq data were integrated using the Harmony algorithm (v0.1.0) to correct for batch effects. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the top 2,000 highly variable genes, and the first 30 principal components (PCs) were used for downstream analysis. Cell clusters were identified using the Louvain algorithm with a resolution of 0.5 and annotated based on marker gene expression: cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs; PDGFRB, ACTA2), melanocytes/cancer cells (MLANA, TYR), T/NK cells (CD3D, NKG7), dendritic/proliferating cells (CD83, MKI67), endothelial cells (PECAM1, VWF), and macrophages (CD68, CD163). Cell-cell communication analysis was performed using the CellChat R package (v1.6.0). Ligand-receptor pairs were inferred using the default database, and significant interactions were identified with a p-value < 0.05. Metabolomics analysis Non-targeted metabolomics profiling was conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on TEAD3 + melanoma cells treated with GAS6 or PBS. Cells were harvested and metabolites extracted using 80% methanol. LC-MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a Vanquish UHPLC system. Data were acquired in both positive and negative ionization modes. Metabolites were identified using the MetaboAnalyst 5.0 platform with the HMDB and KEGG databases. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the KEGG pathway database, and significantly enriched pathways were defined as those with a p-value < 0.05. Methylmalonic acid levels were quantified using targeted LC-MS with a stable isotope-labeled internal standard ( 13 In vitro functional assays TEAD3 knockdown in SK-MEL-5. A-375 and MM9H-1 melanoma cells was achieved using three independent siRNAs (Thermo Fisher Scientific, siRNA IDs: s22334, s22335, s22336). Cells were transfected with 50 nM siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Knockdown efficiency was validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and Western blotting with anti-TEAD3 antibody (Abcam, ab133266). Cell proliferation was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Laboratories). Briefly, 2,000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plates, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. For Transwell migration and invasion assays, cells were seeded in chambers (8-µm pores; Corning) coated with Matrigel (invasion only; BD Biosciences). After 24 h, membranes were fixed in 4% PFA, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and imaged at 10 random fields/membrane using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope (10× objective). Cell quantification was performed via automated threshold-based analysis (NIS-Elements AR v5.21; object criteria: size > 50 μm², circularity 0.2–1.0), with data expressed as mean cells/field ± SEM. For scratch assays, confluent monolayers were scratched with a 200-µl pipette tip, imaged at 0 h and 24 h (EVOS M7000, 4× objective), and wound closure (%) was calculated using ImageJ v1.53 as: [1 − (Area 12 Seahorse XF Analyzer (Agilent Technologies) was used to measure oxidative phosphorylation (OCR) and glycolysis (ECAR) rates in GAS6 + and GAS6- macrophages. Cells were seeded in XF24 cell culture plates and incubated in XF assay medium (Agilent) for 1 h prior to analysis. ATP levels were quantified using the ATP Assay Kit (Abcam, ab83355) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TEAD3-KO B16F10luc cell generation TEAD3-knockout (KO) B16F10luc melanoma cells were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Two high-efficiency single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting TEAD3 exons were designed via the CRISPR Design Tool ( http://crispr.mit.edu/ sgRNA1: 5′-GACCTGCGCAAGATCCTGCT-3′ (Exon 2). sgRNA2: 5′-GTCATGGCTCCGTACCCGAG-3′ (Exon 4). Oligonucleotides were annealed and cloned into BbsI-linearized pSpCas9(BB)-2 A-Puro (Addgene #62988) using T4 DNA ligase. B16F10luc cells (70% confluent in 6-well plates) were co-transfected with 2 µg sgRNA plasmids using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher). After 48 h, puromycin selection (2 µg/mL) was applied for 72 h. Surviving cells were single-cell sorted by FACS into 96-well plates. Knockout efficiency was confirmed by qPCR and Western blotting. Myeloid-specific GAS6 knockout mice model Myeloid-specific GAS6 knockout mice were generated by crossing homozygous GAS6 fl/fl fl/fl +/− fl/fl +/− fl/fl −/− In vivo experiments For tumor growth assays, 1 × 10^6 TEAD3-KO or wild-type (WT) B16F10luc cells were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice ( n n Assessment of treatment-related adverse effects To comprehensively evaluate potential toxicities associated with therapeutic targeting of the GAS6-TYRO3 axis and its combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, we implemented a multi-parameter toxicity assessment protocol. Body weight was monitored every 3 days using a calibrated scale (Sartorius CPA225D, ± 0.01 g sensitivity). Serum biomarkers of organ dysfunction were analyzed at endpoint: liver function (ALT/AST; Sigma-Aldrich MAK052), renal function (BUN/creatinine; Abcam ab83362), and pancreatic injury (amylase/lipase; Invitrogen EIAMYL/EIAMSG) were quantified via commercial ELISA kits. Hematological profiles (complete blood counts with differentials) were assessed using an automated hematology analyzer (Sysmex XN-1000). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were sectioned at 4 μm thickness and stained for TEAD3 (Abcam, ab133266), N-cadherin (Cell Signaling Technology, #13116), and E-cadherin (Cell Signaling Technology, #3195) using standard IHC protocols. Antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95 °C for 20 min. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako) and DAB substrate (Vector Laboratories). For flow cytometry, single-cell suspensions from tumor tissues were prepared by mechanical dissociation and enzymatic digestion with collagenase IV (1 mg/mL, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were stained with antibodies against CD3 (BioLegend, 100204), CD8 (BioLegend, 100708), CD163 (BioLegend, 333602), and TIGIT (BioLegend, 151702) for 30 min at 4 °C. Data were acquired using a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer and analyzed using FlowJo software (v10.8.1). Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using R (v4.2.2) or GraphPad Prism (v9.0). Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Comparisons between two groups were performed using Student’s t-test, and multiple group comparisons were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences were assessed using the log-rank test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Identification of melanoma subgroups based on Short-Chain fatty acid metabolism and their association with clinical outcomes To investigate the heterogeneity of melanoma and its association with lipid metabolism, we analyzed RNA sequencing data from 468 melanoma patients obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Using the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm implemented in the R package NMF, we performed clustering analysis and selected six clusters based on the cophenetic coefficient (Fig. 1 1  Fig. 1 Identification of SCFA-Driven Melanoma Subgroups with Distinct Clinical Outcomes ( A B C D E-G E F G Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the six RNAseq-based clusters revealed that patients in Group 6 exhibited significantly worse overall survival compared to the other groups ( P 1 1 To gain further insights into the biological processes associated with Group 6, we conducted functional enrichment analysis on the 1,568 upregulated genes identified in this group. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed significant enrichment of the Melanogenesis pathway in Group 6 (Fig. 1 1 1 These findings suggest that Group 6 represents a distinct molecular subtype of melanoma characterized by dysregulated lipid metabolism, activation of melanogenesis-related pathways, and poor clinical outcomes. The upregulation of genes such as GLTP and RAPGEFL1, along with the enrichment of pathways involved in skin development and lipid metabolism, may provide potential therapeutic targets for this high-risk subgroup. Identification of TEAD3 as a key risk gene driving melanoma progression and poor prognosis To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving the poor prognosis of Group 6 melanoma patients, we performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and identified several immune- and cancer-related pathways significantly enriched in this subgroup, including GnRH signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, p53 signaling pathway, and Ras signaling pathway (Fig. 2 2  Fig. 2 TEAD3 Emerges as a Key Driver of Melanoma Progression. ( A B C D GSE215120 E F P G Risk forest plot analysis revealed that SFN, PLA2G4E, SERPINB5, WWC1, PAK 6 TEAD3 2 GSE215120 2 ADH7 SFN WWC1 PAK6 TEAD3 TEAD3 2 Consistent with these findings, survival analysis using TCGA melanoma data revealed that high TEAD3 P 2 2 Functional validation of TEAD3 as a critical driver of acral melanoma progression in vitro and in vivo To validate the functional role of TEAD3 in melanoma progression, we performed a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments using multiple melanoma cell lines and syngeneic mouse models. Initially, we designed three independent siRNAs targeting TEAD3 and confirmed their knockdown efficiency in the SK-MEL-5 human melanoma cell line. Quantitative PCR and Western blot analyses demonstrated that all three siRNAs significantly reduced TEAD3 mRNA (Fig. 3 3 3 3 3  Fig. 3 TEAD3 Knockout Suppresses Melanoma Growth and EMT. ( A-B A B C-E C E F-G F G H I-J J K To further generalize these findings, we extended the TEAD3 knockdown experiments to two additional melanoma cell lines, A-375 and MM9H-1. Consistent with the results in SK-MEL-5 cells, TEAD3 knockdown in both A-375 and MM9H-1 cells led to significant suppression of proliferation, migration, and invasion (Supplementary Figure S1 To investigate the impact of TEAD3 loss in vivo, we first generated a TEAD3-knockout (KO) B16F10luc cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The knockout efficiency was confirmed by qPCR and WB, which showed a complete absence of TEAD3 mRNA and protein expression in the KO cells (Figs. 3 3 3 3 To further evaluate the role of TEAD3 in a more clinically relevant and immunocompetent microenvironment, we utilized the YUMMER1.7 syngeneic mouse model, which closely mimics key characteristics of human immunotherapy-resistant melanoma. Similarly, TEAD3-KO YUMMER1.7 cells were generated via CRISPR/Cas9, and knockout was verified at both mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Figure S2 S2 S2 Finally, survival analysis showed that mice bearing TEAD3-KO tumors in both the B16F10luc and YUMMER1.7 models had significantly longer overall survival compared to those with WT tumors (Fig. 3 S2 TEAD3 expression promotes tumor malignancy via M2 macrophage crosstalk and GAS6-TYRO3 signaling in a spatially defined microenvironment To further elucidate the reasons behind the high malignancy of tumor cells with elevated expression of TEAD3, we isolated tumor cells from single-cell data and categorized them into high-risk and low-risk cancer cells based on their TEAD3 expression levels (Fig. 4 4 4 D 4 4 4 4  Fig. 4 TEAD3 Drives Tumor-M2 Macrophage Crosstalk via GAS6-TYRO3 in a Spatial Niche. ( A B C D E F-G F G H Hypermetabolic GAS6 + macrophages enhance GAS6 secretion via oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis in the tumor microenvironment To validate the single-cell RNA sequencing results, we isolated GAS6 + macrophages from B16F10luc-induced syngeneic melanoma tumors and adjacent normal tissues using flow cytometry, revealing a significantly higher proportion of GAS6 + macrophages in tumor tissues (Fig. 5 5 5 D 5 5 5 H  Fig. 5 Hypermetabolic GAS6 + Macrophages Drive GAS6 Secretion. ( A B P C-D C D E F G-H The GAS6-TYRO3 axis mediates macrophage-melanoma crosstalk to drive tumor proliferation, EMT, and metastasis To investigate the role of the GAS6-TYRO3 axis in mediating crosstalk between TEAD3 + melanoma cells and macrophages, we isolated TEAD3 + high-risk tumor cells from melanoma-bearing mice and established five experimental groups: [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 6 D 6 F 6  Fig. 6 GAS6-TYRO3 Axis Promotes Tumor Proliferation and EMT. ( A B C-D C D E-F E F P G GAS6 drives TEAD3 + melanoma cell aggressiveness by reprogramming propionate metabolism via mmut-mediated methylmalonic acid accumulation To investigate how GAS6 secretion interacts with TEAD3 + melanoma cells, we isolated TEAD3 + tumor cells from a B16F10luc melanoma mouse model and treated them with either GAS6 or PBS (control) during vitro culture, followed by non-targeted metabolomics sequencing. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed a clear separation between the GAS6-treated and control groups, indicating significant differences in their metabolic profiles (Fig. 7 7 7 34 35 7 E 7 7 7  Fig. 7 GAS6 Reprograms Propionate Metabolism via Mmut. ( A B C D E F G-H I J To further explore whether GAS6-induced MMA accumulation contributes to immunosuppression—a key rationale for targeting this pathway—we collected conditioned medium (CM) from four treatment groups of TEAD3 + tumor cells and co-cultured it with primary murine CD8⁺ T cells. We found that CM from GAS6-treated cells significantly upregulated exhaustion markers (PD-1, CD38, TIM-3, LAG-3) and induced cell cycle arrest in the G0-G1 phase in CD8⁺ T cells (Fig. 7 J 7 J Collectively, these findings reveal a critical metabolic-immune crosstalk whereby GAS6 reprograms propionate metabolism in TEAD3 + melanoma cells via Mmut-mediated MMA accumulation, which not only enhances cell aggressiveness but also fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment. This underscores Mmut and methylmalonic acid as promising therapeutic targets to disrupt both tumor-intrinsic and immune-suppressive mechanisms in melanoma. Myeloid-GAS6 knockout enhances Anti-PD-1 therapy by boosting antitumor immunity and improving melanoma treatment outcomes To investigate the role of the GAS6-TYRO3 axis in melanoma progression and its impact on immunotherapy efficacy, we generated myeloid-specific GAS6 knockout (Myeloid-GAS6 KO) mice and established a melanoma model by injecting tumor cells into these mice and wild-type (WT) controls. The mice were then treated with anti-PD-1 (α-PD-1) therapy. In WT mice, α-PD-1 treatment showed limited efficacy, whereas in Myeloid-GAS6 KO mice, α-PD-1 treatment significantly enhanced antitumor immunity, as evidenced by reduced expression of immunosuppressive markers (CD163 and TIGIT) and increased expression of the cytotoxic marker perforin in the tumor microenvironment (Fig. 8 8 8 8  Fig. 8 Myeloid-GAS6 Knockout Synergizes with Anti-PD-1 Therapy. ( A ) C D E To assess the potential adverse effects associated with the therapeutic strategies, we systematically evaluated body weight changes, serum biomarkers of organ function, and hematological parameters across all experimental groups. No significant differences in body weight were observed among the groups throughout the treatment period (Supplementary Fig. S3 S3 S3 Collectively, our results reveal that GAS6 + macrophages enhance glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to fuel GAS6 secretion, which interacts with high-risk TEAD3 + melanoma cells via the TYRO3 receptor. This crosstalk dysregulates propionate metabolism in tumor cells, leading to the accumulation of methylmalonic acid and promoting tumor proliferation and aggressiveness. Importantly, targeting the GAS6-TYRO3 axis in Myeloid-GAS6 KO mice sensitizes tumors to α-PD-1 therapy by enhancing CD8 + T cell infiltration and anti-tumor immunity, without inducing observable adverse effects, suggesting a promising and safe strategy to overcome resistance to immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma (Fig. 8 Discussion In this study, we identified a high-risk subgroup of melanoma characterized by dysregulated short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism, particularly propionate metabolism pathways, and poor clinical outcomes. Through integrated multi-omics analyses, we uncovered the critical role of TEAD3 in driving melanoma progression and its interaction with GAS6 + macrophages via the GAS6-TYRO3 axis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that myeloid-specific GAS6 knockout enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, providing a novel strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance in melanoma. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between tumor metabolism, immune modulation, and therapeutic responses, offering new insights into melanoma biology and treatment. TEAD3 emerged as a central regulator of melanoma malignancy, with high expression associated with poor prognosis and aggressive tumor behavior [ 24 25 26 28 Our study revealed that GAS6 + macrophages exhibit a hypermetabolic phenotype, characterized by enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, which fuels GAS6 secretion. This metabolic reprogramming enables GAS6 + macrophages to interact with TEAD3 + melanoma cells via the GAS6-TYRO3 ligand-receptor axis, promoting tumor proliferation, EMT, and metastasis. These findings are consistent with recent reports highlighting the role of GAS6-TYRO3 signaling in cancer progression and immune modulation [ 29 30 31 33 34 35 One of the most significant findings of this study is the synergistic effect of myeloid-specific GAS6 knockout and anti-PD-1 therapy in enhancing antitumor immunity and improving treatment outcomes. Myeloid-GAS6 KO mice exhibited increased CD8 + T cell infiltration, reduced immunosuppressive markers, and improved survival, even in the absence of anti-PD-1 treatment. When combined with anti-PD-1 therapy, these effects were further amplified, suggesting that targeting the GAS6-TYRO3 axis can sensitize melanoma to immune checkpoint blockade. This is particularly relevant given the limited efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in many melanoma patients, which is often attributed to an immunosuppressive TME [ 36 38 39 41 42 43 While this study provides mechanistic insight into melanoma progression and immunotherapy resistance, certain limitations must be acknowledged. First, our experimental models primarily reflect features of acral melanoma and the identified high-risk TEAD3 + subgroup; thus, the generalizability to other melanoma subtypes (e.g., BRAF or NRAS mutant, or triple wild-type tumors) requires further validation. Although we have supplemented our in vitro studies with additional cell lines (A375, MM9H-1), future research should include more diverse genetic backgrounds and patient-derived xenograft models to evaluate the broader applicability of our findings. Second, while our toxicity assessments indicated no significant adverse effects from myeloid-specific GAS6 deletion combined with anti-PD-1 in mice—with no marked changes in body weight, serum organ function markers, or hematological parameters (Supplementary Fig. S3 44 47 In conclusion, our study elucidates the pivotal role of the GAS6–TYRO3 axis and TEAD3-driven metabolic reprogramming in promoting melanoma progression and immune evasion, with particular relevance in acral and other high-risk melanomas. By integrating multi-omics and functional validation, we provide a rationale for stratifying patients based on TEAD3 expression and propose targeting GAS6 signaling or methylmalonic acid accumulation as a novel combinatorial strategy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. These insights reinforce the importance of understanding tumor-immune-metabolic crosstalk within the tumor microenvironment and highlight the potential of biomarker-guided therapy in melanoma.
