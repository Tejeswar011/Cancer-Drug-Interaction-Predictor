Currently, there are few reports on the clinical characteristics, genetic status, treatment strategies, and prognosis of SMPLC after radical surgery. Methods We retrospectively reviewed cases of SMPLC patients from January 2018 to October 2023. All patients underwent radical surgery and had genetic results using Next-generation sequencing (NGS) or Amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) for at least one lesion. Analysis was conducted on the clinical information, pathological types, genetic status, treatment strategies, and prognoses. Results We analyzed 72 patients with SMPLC in stage I-IIIA, and 64 of them were in stage IA. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation was the most common gene, followed by Tumor protein 53(TP53) and Kirsten Rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS). Among the population with EGFR mutations, EGFR L858R, EGFR 19DEL, and EGFR G719X are common, accounting for 47.6%, 33.3%, and 7.2%, respectively. Among the 72 patients, 66 were lung cancer-free with a median follow-up time of 32 months and six patients experienced disease recurrence with a median Disease-free survival (DFS) of 24 months. For stage IA patients, DFS was correlated with the presence of pathological high-risk factors (combined small cell lung cancer, solid/micropapillae subtype) ( P P Conclusion EGFR is a high-frequency mutation in early stage SMPLC. Radical surgery is a suitable treatment strategy for stage IA SMPLC patients, including those with EGFR sensitive mutations. Pathological high-risk factors and PDL-1 positive expression correlate with poorer prognoses in stage IA patients.

This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing Chest Hospital, Capital Medical University before its implementation. Inclusion criteria of cases  .SMPLC patients have pathology results that meet one of the following three characteristics, (1) The histologic types of each cancer are different. (2) Each cancer has distinct molecular genetic characteristics (driver gene mutations).(3) The foci are located in different pulmonary lobes, exhibit clear differentiation through comprehensive histologic assessment, and demonstrate divergent radiographic appearances. Which meets the 2016 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) criteria [ 3 All patients have at least one genetic result of major tumor tissue confirmed by Next-generation sequencing (NGS) or Amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction (ARMS- PCR). According to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) lung cancer staging criteria (version 8), patients are in stage I to IIIA. All patients have regular follow-up records and imaging data. Exclusion criteria  .Lung cancer complicated by second primary cancers. 2.Imaging findings suggest multiple primary lung cancers, but pathological confirmation has not been obtained via surgery. 3. Complicated with other severe diseases that affect survival. Research methods Clinical and pathological data of 72 patients were collected, including age, sex, TNM stages, pathological types, pathological high-risk factors, Programmed cell death ligand 1(PD-L1) expressions, gene mutation status, imaging of chest CT scan, treatment plans, surgical manners, Disease-free survival (DFS), etc. Pathological high-risk factors included combined small cell lung cancer, solid/micropapillae subtype(proportion ≥ 20%), vascular invasion, and spread through air spaces(STAS). The expression of PD-L1 was assessed using the Tumor proportion score(TPS) method, defined as (Number of PD-L1-expressing tumor cells/Total number of evaluable tumor cells) × 100%. The antibody used was 22C3. DFS between patients with different clinical or pathological characteristics was analyzed. DFS was defined as the time between surgery and the first occurrence of lung cancer relapse or metastasis. All tumors were staged separately according to their own TNM. For each patient, the tumor with the highest TNM stage was used to analyze. Due to the high proportion of stage IA patients in our study, which reached 88.9%, We focused on exploring the prognostic factors of this group of patients. The last follow-up date was December 31, 2024. Statistical methods Statistical software SPSS 26.0(Armonk, NY: IBM Corp) was used for data analysis. DFS was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method, and differences between groups were analyzed by log-rank test. P Genetic analysis Tissue ARMS-PCR was conducted by Xiamen Aide Biopharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd. and ten genes were checked including Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), Tumor protein 53 (TP53), Kirsten Rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), etc. Tumor tissue NGS test was performed by the DA8600 NGS system of Novogene Co., Ltd. and at least 26 genes were detected. Results Clinical information Among 72 SMPLCs, 70 patients had different primary lesions of adenocarcinoma. One patient with two primary lesions had different pathological types: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. One patient had three lesions, namely adenocarcinoma, microinvasive adenocarcinoma, and complex small cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma plus small cell carcinoma).Due to the specimens quality control for PD-L1 testing, there were 32 cases who checked the PD-L1 expression.

In our study, we found that DFS of stage IA patients was not correlated with the detailed staging (IA1, IA2, IA3), EGFR sensitivity mutation status, lobectomy or sub-lobectomy surgery manners, the number of lesions, and TP53/KRAS mutation status,.

Among 30 stage IA patients harboring EGFR sensitive mutation, DFS was also correlated with pathological high-risk factors ( P P Discussion According to epidemiological statistics, the incidence rate of MPLC varies from 0.8–14.5% [ 4 8 9 10 Analysis of gene mutation status for MPLC The genetic mutation status and microenvironment of MPLC are currently hot research topics. A single-cell sequencing study showed that different MPLC lesions in the same patient exhibited different types of gene mutations, and each patient’s lesion had different Single-Nucleotide Variants (SNVs), indicating that lesions in MPLC are independent from each other and have no common origin [ 11 12 12 13 15 2 2 2 In our study, EGFR mutations accounted for 54.5% of the total SMPLC lesions. The sequencing genes were TP53, KRAS, and Epidermal growth factor receptor 2(HER2). Furthermore, we found that EGFR mutations in early MPLC include various forms such as EGFR L858R, EGFR 19DEL, EGFR G719X, EGFR Delins, EGFR 20INS etc., among which EGFR L858R had the highest proportion. Our results demonstrate the detailed information of EGFR gene mutations in multiple primary lesions undergoing radical resection. Treatment strategies and prognoses for stage IA MPLC patients The current preferred option for early MPLC lung cancer is still surgery, including sub-lobar resection [ 16 17 18 19 Our article has a relatively small sample size, but we focused on the prognosis of patients with stage IA SMPLC. Previous studies have rarely focused specifically on the IA phase. The 64 stage IA patients with SMPLC in our research all underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Sixty-one of them were disease-free by the deadline of follow-up, which confirms the importance of surgery. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of their prognoses. Previous studies have showen that after R0 resection, follow-up is adequate for NSCLC in stage IA [ 20 21 22 23 PD-L1 has currently been established as a predictive biomarker for perioperative neoadjuvant and adjuvant immunotherapy. Higher levels of PD-L1 expression are associated with more significant survival benefits from immunotherapy [ 24 25 26 27 From the perspective of relevant biological mechanisms, high PD-L1 expression reflects tumor immune editing that has selected for more aggressive clones. These clones exhibit stronger metastatic potential even in early-stage disease. PD-L1 overexpression activates the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway to suppress T-cell function, thereby rendering early-stage tumors more invasive [ 28 29 30 31 Treatment strategies for SMPLC patients with EGFR mutations in stage IA after radical surgery EGFR-TKIs bring significant survival benefits and improvement in quality of life to patients harboring positive EGFR, and targeted therapy has become a very important treatment strategy for advanced NSCLC patients [ 32 The ADJUVANT/EVIDENCE study focused on completely resected pathological stage II-IIIA NSCLC patients with confirmed EGFR mutation. These clinical trials found that patients who received adjuvant therapy with Gefitinib/Erlotinib had significantly prolonged DFS and OS compared to chemotherapy. The ADRURA study [ 33 In our study cohort, the DFS of stage IA EGFR positive patients was similar to that of EGFR negative ones, which shows for early-stage SMPLC, EGFR may not be a negative prognostic factor. Among 30 stage IA EGFR positive patients, five of them received EGFR-TKIs adjuvant therapy. We found that patients receiving adjuvant therapy did not achieve better DFS. It is worth noting that this result needs to be viewed with caution, as drawing conclusions based on five cases is underpowered statistically, and larger sample studies are required to validate this finding. EGFR positivity included 19del, L858R and two cases of 19delins in our research. EGFR 19delins is a rare type and literature shows the sensitivity of EGFR-TKIs [ 34 36 But some stage IA EGFR mutated patients may should be paid more attention. A retrospective study found that in stage IA patients with EGFR positive mutations, the 5-year Recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate was higher in the subgroup of patients with moderate invasion dominated by papillae/acini than in highly invasive subgroups dominated by solid/micropapillae [ 37 38 Our research also showed that in the EGFR-sensitive population, patients with high-risk factors had shorter DFS, but whether they can benefit from EGFR-TKIs remains unknown. Currently, several clinical trials in China are investigating the application of furmonertinib (a third-generation TKI) as adjuvant therapy for EGFR-positive, single-lesion stage IA patients with high-risk factors; the results have not yet been published. Whether EGFR-TKIs can improve outcomes for high-risk, EGFR-positive MPLC patients requires further confirmation through prospective studies. We believe that in the current situation, patients with multiple primary stages of IA accompanied by EGFR mutations and high-risk factors require additional attention, such as increasing follow-up frequency. Due to the high frequency of EGFR mutations in the Asian population, our study may provide genetic mutation characteristics and prognostic references for early-stage SMPLC patients in this population. Despite this, our research has certain limitations. Being a single-center retrospective study, its design inherently gives rise to selection bias. Two distinct genetic testing approaches were employed in our investigation: NGS (applied to 47 lesions) and ARMS-PCR (utilized for 30 lesions). The heterogeneity between these two detection methodologies has the potential to impact the sensitivity of the testing outcomes. Conclusion EGFR, TP53, KRAS, and HER2 are high-frequency mutations in resectable early-stage SMPLC patients. EGFR mutations in early-stage SMPLC include various forms such as L858R, 19DEL, and G719X. Stage IA patients with pathological high-risk factors and PD-L1-positive expression have shorter DFS.
