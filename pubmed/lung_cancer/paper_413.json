Understanding the multifaceted functions of the matrix is crucial for advancing fields such as cancer research, given its integral and dynamic role in the tumor microenvironment. In this special issue, Skandalis and cols. [ 1 Tissue engineering of 3D in vitro 2 in vitro Beyond cell–cell interactions and biochemical signals, the tumor stroma is also defined by its unique mechanical properties, which are shaped by the composition and organization of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the primary producers and remodelers of the stromal ECM, and the heterogeneity among CAF subtypes has recently become a major focus of research. In this special issue, de la Jara Ortiz et al 3 in vitro in vitro Notably, growing evidence indicates that cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can exert either tumor‐promoting or tumor‐restraining effects. Current therapeutic strategies aim to shift this balance toward tumor‐restraining phenotypes.
