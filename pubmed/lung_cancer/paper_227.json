The progression and\ntreatment response of tumors depend not only\non the cancer cells themselves but more on the tumor immune microenvironment\n(TIME) in which they are located. The advancement of computer and\nsequencing technologies in recent years has led to a new era of development\nin immunology. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology,\nwhich allows for the detection of gene expression at the cellular\nlevel, has become a powerful tool in immunology research. scRNA-seq\ntechnology is revolutionary in its ability to analyze the genome,\ntranscriptome, and epigenome at the level of individual cells. Single-cell\nsequencing technology has revolutionized our understanding of the\ngene expression profiles associated with diseases. It offers unique\nadvantages in elucidating the heterogeneity of hybrid tumor cells\ncomprising cancer cells, stromal cells, immune cells, and various\ndifferentiated cells.  Among\nthe various cells in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME),\ntumor-associated neutrophils have been found in recent years to play\ncomplex and crucial roles in tumor progression, immune escape, and\ntreatment resistance. However, their specific roles in gastric cancer\nstill need to be further explored. Neutrophils are highly abundant\nimmune granulocytes with crucial functions in acute and chronic inflammation\nas well as adaptive immune responses. These cells are frequently found\nin the tumor immune microenvironment of cancer, and their role in\ntumorigenesis and development has been increasingly studied and better\nunderstood in recent years. According to research, cytokines and chemical\nsignals within the tumor immune microenvironment can polarize neutrophils\ninto different roles, influencing tumor progression. Specifically,\nneutrophils can transform into N1 tumor-associated neutrophils with\nantitumor effects through IFN-β, IL-1β, and IL-8. Alternatively,\nthey can become N2 tumor-associated neutrophils that promote tumor\nprogression, induced by TGF-β, GM-CSF, and IL-6.   The identification of tumor\nmicroenvironments containing various\ncell subtypes is a crucial application of single-cell sequencing,\nwhich also promotes the progress of tumor-targeted therapy and immunotherapy.\nNonetheless, research on neutrophils within the tumor immune microenvironment\nremains relatively scarce. Given this advantage, this study is based\non single-cell sequencing data of liver metastases from gastric cancer,\nreveals the molecular characteristics of TANs in metastatic gastric\ncancer, and accordingly develops and validates a novel prognostic\nrisk score, namely the NE-riskScore. This study utilized single-cell\nsequencing data from liver metastases of gastric cancer to investigate\nthe potential of tumor-associated neutrophils in immune typing, prognostic\nprediction, therapeutic efficacy guidance, and drug prediction for\ngastric cancer. Materials and Methods Data Acquisition and Processing Obtaining the single-cell\ntranscriptome profile of gastric cancer involved downloading the GSE163558 www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository https://www.gtexportal.org/ GSE26842 GSE84437 Construction of Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Network The PPI network analysis was performed using the STRING database\n( https://string-db.org/ Identification of Immune-Related Molecular Subtypes We used the “NMF” R package to cluster samples based\non prognostic genes and evaluated the clustering performance for numbers\nranging from 2 to 10. The prognostic performance of different molecular\nsubtypes was assessed using Kaplan–Meier curves for progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). To estimate ImmuneScore,\nStromalScore, EstimateScore, and tumor purity for each sample, we\nemployed the “estimate” R package and visualized the\nresults using the “ggpubr” R package. We analyzed the\nimmune cell infiltration compositions of different samples using the\nMCPcounter software. Additionally, we performed multiple GSEA analyses\nto compare the pathway enrichment differences between the two immune\nmolecular subtypes. Construction and Validation of Prognostic Risk Models The gastric cancer patient samples were randomly split into equally\nsized training and test groups. Neutrophil-associated signatures linked\nto prognosis were constructed using training data and were internally\nvalidated using test data. To identify survival-associated genes,\nwe performed univariate Cox regression analysis at a significance\nlevel of p GSE26842 GSE84437 Construction of Nomogram and Clinical Correlation Analysis of\nRisk Score Using the rms R package, we constructed a nomogram\nfor 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year overall survival (OS) by incorporating\nthe risk score, age, and tumor stage. We assessed the accuracy of\nthe predicted results using a calibration curve to evaluate the agreement\nbetween the predicted and actual outcomes. We further classified GC\npatients according to age (≤65/>65), gender (male/female),\nand clinical stage (I-II/III-IV). Additional verification of the predictive\nability of NE-riskScore across different subgroups was performed using\nsurvival analysis. We compared pathway enrichment between different\nrisk groups using the R package “GSEA” and enrichment\ndata (c2.cp.kegg.v7.4.symbols.gmt). Analysis of Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) and Immune Relevance Somatic mutant profiles of GC patients in both high- and low-risk\ngroups were obtained from the TCGA database using the “maftools”\nsoftware package. The immune cell infiltration status of TCGA GC patients\nwas determined through multiple methods, including TIMER, CIBERSORT,\nQUANTISEQ, XCELL, MCPcounter, and EPIC, as provided by TIMER2.0 ( http://timer.cistrome.org/ http://tide.dfci.harvard.edu/ Prognostic Gene Expression Analysis We utilized the\nTumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) database ( http://tisch.comp-genomics.org www.proteinatlas.org/ Patient Sample Clinical and pathological data from\n40 patients with advanced gastric cancer who underwent radical surgery\nand received treatment at Jiangsu University Affiliated People’s\nHospital between July 2020 and September 2024 were retrospectively\nanalyzed. Based on their initial evaluation of the efficacy of treatment\nwith the drug camrelizumab, the patients were categorized into two\ngroups based on their response: the good response group and the poor\nresponse group. Tumor initial evaluation referred to the efficacy\nevaluation conducted two months after the start of routine treatment\ncombined with camrelizumab immunotherapy. All 40 patients with gastric\ncancer were detected as MSS/pMMR, and imaging examinations showed\nat least one objectively measurable or evaluable tumor lesion. The\nresponse to treatment was evaluated using the Response Evaluation\nCriteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), which is a standard method for\nassessing the efficacy of treatments for solid tumors. Complete response\n(CR) refers to the disappearance of all lesions lasting for 4 weeks\nor more; partial response (PR) indicates a reduction of at least 30%\nin the total diameter of the target lesion lasting for 4 weeks or\nmore, based on the baseline total diameter as the reference; progressive\ndisease (PD) indicates an increase of at least 20% in the total diameter\nof the target lesion compared to its smallest sum in the study, or\nthe appearance of new lesions; stable disease (SD) refers to cases\nwhere the target lesion was neither reduced to PR nor increased to\nPD. Among the patients, 20 were in the good response group (CR + PR),\nand 20 were in the poor response group (SD + PD). Samples of both\ntumor and adjacent nontumor tissue were obtained from all 40 gastric\ncancer patients. The Medical Ethics Committee of Jiangsu University\nAffiliated People’s Hospital approved the study protocol, and\nall participants provided written informed consent. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) Standard protocols\nwere followed to extract total RNA from GC tissues using Trizol reagent\n(Solarbio, Beijing, China). Following the RNA extraction, reverse\ntranscription was performed using the PrimeScript RT kit and gDNA\nEraser (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan). qRT-PCR based on SYBR Green was used\nfor the analysis. The expression level was calculated by 2 –ΔΔCt Table S1 Drug Sensitivity Analysis and Molecular Docking The\nOncoPredictR package was used to evaluate drug sensitivity, and then\ncomparative analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank\ntest. To identify potential therapeutic small molecules, we retrieved\na list of compounds that interact with prognostic genes from the CTD\ndatabase ( http://ctdbase.org/ https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ https://www.uniprot.org Statistical Analysis We performed statistical analysis\nusing R software (V4.1.1) and GraphPad Prism 9.4.1 (GraphPad Software,\nUSA). The Wilcoxon test was used to compare gene expression levels\nbetween the tumor and normal tissues. A p-value of less than 0.05\nwas deemed statistically significant unless otherwise specified.

Enrichment Analysis and Construction of PPI Network We obtained transcriptome expression profiles from multiple sources\nto conduct our analysis. Specifically, we retrieved data on 375 gastric\ncancer tissues and 32 normal gastric tissues from the TCGA database,\nas well as an additional 174 normal gastric tissues from the GTEx\ndatabase. Using batch integration analysis, we integrated and compared\nthe data sets. 371 genes exhibited differential expression among the\n553 neutrophil marker genes in gastric cancer tissues, as revealed\nby the differential expression analysis ( Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure 2 Enrichment analysis and construction of\nthe protein interaction\nnetwork of differential genes: (A) Differential gene expression heatmap.\n(B) Bar and circular diagrams of GO enrichment analysis.

Immunophenotyping and Analysis of Immune Microenvironment To investigate whether the neutrophil-derived gene set could stratify\npatients into subtypes with distinct immune microenvironments, a characteristic\nwe intended to subsequently represent using a continuous NE-riskScore,\nwe performed non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering. Molecular\nclustering analysis was conducted in gastric cancer patients. We identified\ntwo molecular subtypes comprising all GC samples under the clustering\nthreshold of maxK = 10 ( Figures S2 and S3 Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure  Figure 3 Molecular subtyping\nand immune microenvironment analysis: (A) Consensus\nmatrix of NMF clustering results.

The current treatment modalities for this disease consist\nof surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. However, these therapies\nhave limited efficacy and may cause significant side effects. In the\nfield of gastric cancer treatment, molecular subtyping, immunotherapy,\nand precision medicine have become increasingly popular in recent\nyears. Currently, the molecular subtyping biomarkers that are clinically\nused in gastric cancer mainly include HER2, PD-L1, mismatch repair\nprotein deficiency (dMMR), microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor\nmutational burden (TMB).  The present study involved\nthe analysis of scRNA-seq data from\npatients diagnosed with metastatic gastric cancer. Through quality\ncontrol and dimensionality reduction clustering, we obtained marker\ngenes of immune cell types that infiltrated the tumor tissue. To investigate\nthe role of neutrophils in the tumor immune microenvironment, we conducted\nfunctional enrichment analysis and constructed interaction networks\nbased on the marker genes associated with neutrophils. Following the\nanalysis of differentially expressed genes, we conducted NMF molecular\nsubtyping of the samples and observed that patients in C2 exhibited\nsuperior OS and PFS compared with those in C1. After additional analysis\nof the tumor immune microenvironment, it was found that patients in\nC1 exhibited elevated levels of immune cell infiltration, immune scores,\nand immune checkpoint expression compared with those in C2. A risk\nscore model based on six prognosis-related genes was developed and\nvalidated in this study. Compared with previous studies, the innovation\nof this model lies in its clear cell origin (directly derived from\nthe scRNA-seq data of TANs), which avoids the noise caused by bulk\ndata decomposition and improves its accuracy and reliability. Therefore,\nthis model accurately distinguishes between high-risk and low-risk\ngroups, predicts prognosis, and exhibits superior performance compared\nto the other five models. The low-risk group showed longer overall\nsurvival compared to the high-risk group in the training, testing,\nentire, and external validation cohorts. Furthermore, the risk score\nwas identified as an independent prognostic factor for patients. To\nimprove the practicality of the risk model in clinical settings, we\ncreated a nomogram for assessing the 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates\nof patients. The low-risk group demonstrated enrichment in metabolic\npathways, such as DNA replication, carbohydrate metabolism, and peroxisomes,\nas indicated by GSEA analysis. Conversely, the high-risk group was\nenriched in cell signaling pathways, such as ECM receptor interaction\nand neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction. Additional immune\nanalysis demonstrated that the low-risk group had elevated levels\nof infiltration of diverse immune cells including T cells, B cells,\nand neutrophils. This group also exhibited increased tumor mutation\nburden and higher sensitivity to immune therapy in contrast to the\nhigh-risk group. After validation of this idea in 40 MSS/pMMR gastric\ncancer patients, it is apparent that the risk score model has the\npotential to predict the efficacy of immune therapy. In addition,\nthe evaluation of drug sensitivity in high- and low-risk\ngroups uncovered variations in the reaction to 22 prevalent chemotherapy\nand targeted medications, thus presenting novel perspectives for treatment\nselection according to the risk model. The difference in sensitivity\nto chemotherapy and targeted drugs between the high- and low-risk\ngroups provides a theoretical basis for “individualized chemotherapy”.\nAdditionally, we employed molecular docking to identify four small-molecule\ncompounds (tamoxifen, ICG-001, irinotecan, and doxorubicin) that have\nthe potential to ameliorate the negative prognosis associated with\nprognostic genes, thus presenting new avenues for targeted therapy\nin GC. Significant associations between six risk markers and the prognosis\nof gastric cancer patients were identified ( Figure  This study,\nbased on single-cell transcriptomics, has made new\nbreakthroughs in predicting prognosis, exploring immunotherapy, and\ndrug discovery related to tumor-associated neutrophils. However, there\nare still limitations to this study. To validate our conclusions,\nlarger-scale and multicenter clinical data are still required. In\naddition, further elucidation of molecular mechanisms is needed for\nnew prognostic molecular markers. Conclusions In this study, we provided a comprehensive\ndescription of the precise\napplication of neutrophils in the immune microenvironment of metastatic\ngastric cancer cells for survival prediction and immune therapy in\npatients based on single-gene transcriptomics. We developed a robust\nprognostic model derived from TANs, namely, the NE-riskScore. It is\nnot only a powerful prognostic prediction tool but also a comprehensive\nindicator that can reflect the status of the tumor immune microenvironment,\npredict the response to immunotherapy, and guide drug selection, providing\nnew perspectives and strategies for precision medicine in gastric\ncancer. In addition, we used virtual molecular docking to screen four\nsmall-molecule drugs targeting prognostic genes, which brings new\ninsights into targeted therapy.
