Its proper development relies on placental vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, along with adaptive remodeling of the maternal uterine vasculature. However, the mechanisms underlying placental development and the successful establishment of the maternal–fetal interface remain incompletely understood. As the third gaseous signaling molecule identified after nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) has been demonstrated to regulate vascular adaptation during pregnancy by promoting angiogenesis and neovascularization. Dysregulated H₂S biosynthesis has been implicated in pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia (PE), fetal growth restriction (FGR), and preterm birth (PTB), underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target. Recent studies have revealed that H₂S regulates placental function via multiple signaling pathways, including activating adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K + ATP Ca Ca Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12958-025-01465-1.

In early pregnancy, EVTs originating from the cytotrophoblast shell invade the maternal decidua and SAs, orchestrating essential vascular remodeling. iEVTs infiltrate the decidual stroma, while eEVTs migrate into the SA lumen, progressively replacing endothelial cells and inducing VSMC degradation. This transformation converts the tightly coiled, high-resistance SAs into widened, low-resistance vessels, optimizing maternal blood flow to the placenta and sustaining fetal development. Notes: EVTs: extravillous trophoblasts; iEVTs: interstitial EVTs; eEVTs: endovascular EVTs; SA: spiral Arteries; VSMC: vascular smooth muscle cell Recent genetic studies suggest that placental dysfunction is often underrecognized as a primary cause of congenital anomalies. Mouse models have shown that embryo lethality caused by certain gene deletions can be rescued by functional placentas, indicating that the placenta may play a decisive role in fetal survival and organogenesis [ 30 35 36 37 38 45 46 47 48 49 54 ATP Ca 51 54 55 56 49 57 58 Given that many pregnancy complications such as PE, FGR, PTB, and placenta accreta originate in early placentation but typically manifest later in gestation [ 59 60 H₂S biosynthesis and mechanisms Historical background and significance of H₂S H₂S was historically viewed as a toxic gas, primarily due to its inhibitory effects on mitochondrial respiration at high concentrations. However, research in the mid-20th century revealed its endogenous production in mammals, challenging the traditional toxicological paradigm [ 61 62 63 46 64 65 66 69 Biosynthesis and metabolic pathways of H₂S The synthesis and metabolism of H₂S in vivo involve a complex interplay of enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways. Its biosynthesis occurs through enzymatic reactions, while its degradation involves oxidation, methylation, binding to methemoglobin, and exhalation in a gaseous form. Enzymatic pathways of H₂S synthesis H₂S is primarily synthesized by three key enzymes: cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE), and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST). These enzymes collectively regulate H₂S production through interrelated metabolic pathways and function in specific physiological environments, including the uterus, placenta, ovaries, embryonic development, and pregnancy maintenance [ 69 2 70 71  Fig. 2 Biosynthesis of H₂S and tissue distribution of key enzymes (CBS, CSE, and 3-MST). A B CBS, encoded on chromosome 21, is a pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme and the first in the transsulfuration pathway. It catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine (Hcy) and serine (Ser) or cysteine to cystathionine (Cth) and H₂S [ 63 72 77 68 70 71 78 79 70 71 80 82 83 87 88 CSE, encoded on chromosome 1, is another PLP-dependent enzyme predominantly expressed in the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, kidneys, liver, uterus, and peripheral tissues [ 89 91 92 76 93 95 70 71 84 96 3-MST, encoded on chromosome 22, is a non-PLP-dependent mitochondrial enzyme that uses 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP) as substrate, with cysteine aminotransferase (CAT) and dihydrolipoic acid as cofactors [ 86 97 102 98 99 102 105 71 106 Microbial and dietary sources of H₂S: enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways Beyond endogenous enzymatic synthesis, gut microbiota, diet, and nonenzymatic chemical reactions provide significant contributions to systemic H₂S production, particularly in the gastrointestinal and circulatory systems. These sources work synergistically under physiological and pathological conditions to maintain H₂S homeostasis and expand its biological functionality. The gut microbiota represents a significant source of H₂S, which is generated through both enzymatic and nonenzymatic mechanisms. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), such as Desulfotomaculum Desulfovibrio Desulfobacter 107 108 Escherichia coli Salmonella enterica Clostridium 109 110 Staphylococcus Enterobacter 111 112 Dietary sulfur compounds also contribute to H₂S availability. Enzymatically, cruciferous vegetables (e.g., mustard greens, Chinese kale, and broccoli) are rich in isothiocyanates and glucosinolates, which are metabolized in the gut to release H₂S [ 113 113 116 117 117 118 Recent studies have shown that certain dietary sulfur compounds can modulate mammalian signaling pathways by releasing H₂S, which plays essential roles in cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neural, and immune functions. Reduced H₂S levels are associated with disorders such as hypertension, diabetes, and immune dysregulation [ 119 120 121 122 In summary, these microbial, dietary, and endogenous metabolism form an interconnected network, which complements enzymatic pathways and contributes to immune modulation, vascular regulation, and oxidative homeostasis—processes highly relevant in pregnancy. Under hypoxic or inflammatory conditions, such as those seen in placental insufficiency or gestational disorders, these alternative sources may become particularly active and influence maternal-fetal adaptation. Metabolic pathways of H₂S To maintain physiological H₂S homeostasis, biological systems use three primary metabolic pathways to eliminate or degrade H₂S, ensuring that H₂S levels remain within physiological limits and preventing its accumulation. These pathways include the mitochondrial enzymatic sulfide oxidation pathway, the cytosolic methylation pathway, and the heme-dependent sulfide oxidation pathway [ 93 Mitochondrial enzymatic oxidation: the primary clearance route Within mitochondria, H₂S is oxidized by sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) into protein-bound -SSH [ 123 124 125 126 127 129 76 113 130 93 131 Cytosolic methylation: a secondary backup In the cytoplasm, thiol S-methyltransferase catalyzes H₂S methylation using S-adenosylmethionine to genetate methanethiol (CH₃SH). CH₃SH can then be further converted into thiocyanate or dimethyl sulfide for excretion via urine or exhalation [ 93 113 127 131 113 Heme-dependent oxidation: a buffering and regulatory mechanism In plasma, H₂S binds to deoxyhemoglobin forming sulf-hemoglobin (S-Hb), reducing free H₂S toxicity and releasing it in response to fluctuating blood oxygen levels [ 132 133 134 136 137 139 93 140 142 H₂S metabolism involves both irreversible degradation and reversible storage-release cycles, forming a homeostatic buffering system. Under oxidative stress or hypoxia, thiosulfate and HSxS⁻ may regenerate H₂S, contributing to vascular protection, redox signaling, and metabolic adaptation. Importantly, dysregulated H₂S metabolism is implicated in diverse pathologies, including mitochondrial dysfunction (such as ETHE1 deficiency leading to excessive H₂S accumulation) [ 129 140 86 143 144 146 147 The role of H₂S in pregnancy-associated vascular adaptation and placental function Successful placental development depends on the intricate interactions between fetal trophoblasts and the maternal decidua, particularly the differentiation of trophoblasts and remodeling of uterine vasculature. During early pregnancy, cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) give rise to syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs) for nutrient exchange, and EVTs, which invade the decidua and drive SAR [ 8 148 9 149 9 150 153 154 155 21 156 15 157 12 158 The role of H₂S in placental vascular regulation and trophoblast function Normal placental development relies on trophoblast proliferation, migration, and invasion, which are essential for successful embryo implantation and maternal–fetal vascular remodeling. H₂S is increasingly recognized as a key modulator of these processes, not only by supporting trophoblast function but also by regulating vascular tone within the placental circulation. Mohammed et al. [ 159 ATP The role of H₂S in embryo implantation H₂S facilitates embryo implantation by promoting endometrial receptivity and embryo–epithelial adhesion. In vitro, silencing CBS in JAR cells significantly impairs embryo attachment to Ishikawa cells, indicating the role of CBS-derived H₂S in supporting adhesion via the transsulfuration pathway [ 160 161 H₂S and placental angiogenesis Placental angiogenesis is primarily regulated by local signaling molecules rather than autonomic innervation. H₂S complements the roles of NO [ 5 162 158 163 165 158 165 3  Fig. 3 Multiple Mechanisms of H₂S in Regulating Placental Angiogenesis. H₂S modulates placental vascular function and trophoblast invasion through multiple pathways, facilitating adaptive adjustments in placental blood flow. In early pregnancy, CBS-mediated H₂S production increases, which downregulates sFlt-1 and sEng expression, thereby enhancing PlGF levels and promoting trophoblast invasion, facilitating placental implantation and early development. In late pregnancy, H₂S regulates VEGF release by inhibiting miR-200c targeting VEGF mRNA and suppressing miR-20a and miR-20b targeting VEGF protein. This process enhances VEGF release, promotes placental vascular dilation, and optimizes placental blood flow supply. Overexpression of miR-21 inhibits CSE and SP1 transcription factors, reducing placental H₂S production. Additionally, miR-21 promotes the proliferation of VSMCs while inhibiting their differentiation, thereby affecting placental vascular function. H₂S primarily enhances NOS3 phosphorylation through the AKT1-NOS3 signaling pathway, which promotes NO production, leading to vasodilation and improved blood perfusion. The PI3K-specific inhibitor Wortmannin blocks NOS3 phosphorylation, whereas the MAPK3/1-specific inhibitor U0126 does not affect NOS3 activity. Moreover, H₂S activates the MAPK3/1 signaling pathway, enhancing placental endothelial cell proliferation and migration, further promoting placental angiogenesis. The H₂S donor NaHS significantly enhances these effects.

Exogenous H₂S donors (e.g., NaHS) enhance placental EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation, while trophoblast-derived H₂S further facilitates endothelial migration in a paracrine manner [ 49 167 169 H₂S and placental vascular dysfunction in pregnancy complications Defective H₂S signaling has been linked to impaired placental perfusion and vascular maladaptation in disorders such as PE and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). H₂S donors (e.g., NaHS) promote vasodilation in placental vessels through mechanisms partially dependent on K ATP 64 163 170 171 83 172 H₂S promotes trophoblast invasion by regulating mitochondrial dynamics The migration and invasion of CTBs are critical biological processes for SAR [ 173 173 174 175 176 177 24 177 These findings suggest that CTB invasion is modulated by low concentrations of H₂S, with CBS/H₂S maintaining mitochondrial function through Miro2C185/C504 persulfidation, thereby increasing the CTB migration capacity. Previous research has identified mitochondrial fission regulator 1-like protein (MTFR1L) in HTR-8/SVneo cells as a protein with two distinct H₂S-mediated persulfidation sites [ 76 178 178 4  Fig. 4 H₂S Promotes Trophoblast Invasion by Regulating Mitochondrial Dynamics. In normal pregnancy, H₂S promotes the persulfidation of MTFR1L, maintaining its stable expression and ensuring mitochondrial quantity, morphology, and function, including adequate ATP production, low ROS levels, and a high Δψm. These factors are crucial for trophoblast invasion and migration. The H₂S donor GYY4137 further enhances this regulatory effect, supporting normal placental function. Low-dose H₂S can stimulate CBS translocation to mitochondria, inhibit its degradation, and promote CBS aggregation on mitochondria, enabling Cys to be catalyzed into H₂S within mitochondria. Mitochondrial CBS/H₂S subsequently sulfhydrates Miro2-C185, promoting mitochondrial dynamics, thereby enhancing trophoblast invasion and migration.

[ 179 180 H₂S regulates UA vasodilation and perfusion to support placental development Adequate uterine perfusion is a prerequisite for proper placental development and fetal growth. During pregnancy, the maternal cardiovascular system undergoes significant adaptive changes, including increased blood volume and cardiac output, systemic vasodilation, and decreased vascular resistance, whereas blood pressure remains stable or only slightly decreases [ 154 155 181 154 182 184 Ca 5  Fig. 5 H₂S-Mediated UA Vasodilation. Pregnancy enhances VEGF-induced signaling, selectively upregulating CBS without affecting cystathionine γ-lyase CSE. This promotes CBS-mediated H₂S production, which in turn enhances S-sulfhydration of L-cysteine residues, leading to BK_Ca channel activation and subsequent vascular relaxation, thereby increasing uterine arterial blood flow. Additionally, H₂S facilitates eNOS phosphorylation, augmenting NO production, which further amplifies NO-dependent vasodilation, contributing to improved uteroplacental circulation. Notably, CBS inhibition CHH completely blocks VEGF-induced H₂S production, whereas CSE inhibition BCA has no significant effect, confirming CBS as the primary source of H₂S in this process. Notes: CHH: O-(carboxymethyl)hydroxylamine hemihydrochloride; BCA: b-Cyano-L-alanine; eNOS: Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Molecular mechanisms of H₂S-mediated UA relaxation H₂S acts as a potent vasodilator and proangiogenic factor, primarily synthesized in UAs via CSE and, under pregnancy or estrogen stimulation, via upregulated CBS expression [ 58 70 71 84 184 58 ATP 64 185 Functional assays support this role of H₂S donors, such as GYY4137 and NaHS, induce dose-dependent relaxation in UAs of both rodents and humans, with stronger responses observed during pregnancy [ 54 71 186 71 186 S-sulfhydration and potassium ion channels in H₂S-mediated UA relaxation S-sulfhydration, a key posttranslational modification by H₂S, enhances protein reactivity by converting Cys-SH groups to -SSH [ 187 188 51 186 52 158 189 191 Among the downstream targets, K ATP ATP 52 192 54 51 ATP Ca 51 54 186 Ca ATP 54 186 Ca 54 186 In addition to potassium channels, L-type Ca²⁺ channels are also abundantly expressed in uteroplacental smooth muscle and play a central role in regulating vascular tone, particularly under hypoxic conditions [ 193 194 195 196 197 Collectively, these findings highlight a pregnancy-specific mechanism in which H₂S promotes uterine vasodilation predominantly through S-sulfhydration and BK Ca Interactions of H₂S, NO, and CO in UA regulation The interactions among NO, CO, and H₂S add complexity to gaseous signaling in the vascular system, particularly in the uterine vasculature. Studies indicate that these three gaseous molecules are synthesized in UA ECs and/or VSMCs, where they independently or synergistically regulate vascular tone and homeostasis [ 64 198 49 168 64 199 200 201 The interaction between H₂S and CO is less understood. H₂S may enhance CO production via heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) upregulation under hypoxic conditions, indicating possible synergy in pulmonary vascular regulation [ 202 203 204 The role of H₂S in maternal–fetal immune tolerance and oxidative stress regulation The establishment of maternal–fetal immune tolerance is essential for a successful pregnancy and relies on the coordination between trophoblasts, decidual stromal cells, and maternal immune cells [ 205 206 207 208 214 24 172 215 Beyond immune regulation, H₂S also protects against oxidative stress and ischemia-reperfusion injury by activating pro-survival pathways, such as AKT, PKC, and ERK1/2 pathway [ 216 217 217 218 219 221 222 223 224 225 226 Regulation of H₂S synthesis and function by Estrogen H₂S plays a crucial role in regulating UtBF, promoting SAR, and maintaining placental oxidative homeostasis during pregnancy. Its biosynthesis and signaling are modulated by various factors, among which estrogen is a key hormonal regulator. Studies have shown that H₂S production in UA endothelium and smooth muscle is positively correlated with endogenous estrogen levels [ 71 Types of estrogens and their dynamic changes during pregnancy Estrogens are steroid hormones produced primarily by the ovaries, placenta, with dynamic shifts during pregnancy. In early pregnancy, the corpus luteum remains the primary source of estrogen, but by weeks 9–10, the placenta becomes the primary source via STB, relying on androgen precursors from maternal and fetal adrenal glands [ 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 During pregnancy, estrogen levels exhibit significant dynamic changes, particularly E2, which may reach concentrations up to 1,000 times than in the nonpregnant state [ 230 237 238 3 154 239 The complex role of Estrogen in the hemodynamic regulation of UtBF A critical function of estrogen during pregnancy is to increase UtBF and support placental perfusion [ 240 3 154 239 3 241 243 244 245 246 247 250 251 252 196 253 254 71 184 Ca Although NO is a major mediator of estrogen-induced vasodilation, studies show that NO inhibition accounts for only part of the effect (≈ 79% of UtBF increase; ≈26% of basal UA dilation), implying the existence of additional mediators, notably H₂S [ 47 251 Ca 255 258 259 251 259 261 262 48 263 Beyond vasodilation, estrogen exerts trophic effects at the maternal-fetal interface [ 264 265 267 268 Mechanisms of estrogen-mediated regulation of H₂S production H₂S is synthesized primarily by CBS, CSE, and 3-MST. Estrogen regulates the expression and activity of these enzymes through both genomic and nongenomic mechanisms, thereby increasing H₂S production (Fig. 6  Fig. 6 Estrogen-Regulated H₂S Pathways in Uterine Vasodilation. H₂S mediates estrogen (E₂β)-induced uterine vasodilation through genomic and non-genomic mechanisms. Genomic Pathway: E₂β crosses the cell membrane and binds to ERα and ERβ, which function as nuclear TFs. Upon binding to EREs, these receptors promote CBS gene transcription. The human CBS promoter contains multiple ERE sites, including αERE (ERα binding site), three βEREs (ERβ binding sites), a full α/βERE, and a half α/βERE (½α/βERE). Among these, α/βERE2 and ½α/βERE1 are crucial for basal CBS expression and E₂-induced CBS promoter activation. ERα and ERβ can form homodimers (ERα/ERα or ERβ/ERβ) or heterodimers (ERα/ERβ), regulating H₂S production.Non-Genomic Pathway: E₂β binding to membrane-associated ERα and ERβ directly activates Gαi-2/3, which subsequently stimulates pGC-A, catalyzing GTP conversion to cGMP. cGMP then activates cGMP-dependent PKG-I, which phosphorylates CSE, enhancing H₂S production. The generated H₂S diffuses into SMCs, promoting vasodilation via K-ATP or BK-Ca channels, thereby increasing uterine arterial blood flow. Notes: EC: endothelial cell; SMC: smooth muscle cell; TFs: transcription factors; EREs: estrogen response elements; pGC-A: particulate guanylate cyclase A; PKG-I: protein kinase I ER receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation of CBS Estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ display tissue-specific expression patterns. ERα is predominantly expressed in the pituitary, kidneys, and reproductive tissues, while ERβ is more widely distributed, particularly in reproductive organs and the brain [ 269 270 271 249 272 273 Estrogen selectively upregulates CBS, not CSE, to increase H₂S production. In OVX nonpregnant ewes, estrogen replacement increases CBS mRNA/protein expression and H₂S levelswithout affecting CSE [ 184 71 78 274 275 275 275 78 274 ERα and ERβ act as nuclear transcription factors (TFs) binding to estrogen response elements (EREs) within the CBS promoter [ 248 274 78 275 275 276 277 Estrogen promotes H₂S production via nongenomic signaling Beyond transcriptional control, estrogen rapidly promote H₂S production through nongenomic signaling pathways. Estrogen binding to membrane ERs (primarily ERα/ERβ) activates Gαi-2/3 proteins, which in turn stimulate particulate guanylate cyclase A (pGC-A), converting GTP to cGMP. cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG-I), which phosphorylates CSE, boosting enzymatic activity and H₂S synthesis [ 278 278 279 280 The potential role of H₂S and its donors in pregnancy-related disorders As an essential gasotransmitter, H₂S freely permeates cell membranes without requiring specific transport proteins, thereby rapidly activating biological signaling [ 281 282 283 285 286 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 Research and applications of H₂S donors in pregnancy complications H₂S has been increasingly recognized as a critical regulator of pregnancy physiology, exerting vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory responses, antioxidation, and cytoprotection. However, the direct clinical application of gaseous H₂S is constrained by its volatility, toxicity, and challenges in dose control. To overcome these limitations, various H₂S-releasing compounds have been developed to enable controlled, sustained delivery of H₂S. These donors offer a promising strategy for restoring H₂S homeostasis in pregnancy-related disorders, particularly PE, FGR, and placental dysfunction.

Wang et al. [ 158 300 301 180 In vitro and ex vivo studies further support these findings. NaHS induced dose-dependent vasodilation in human placental villous vessels, mediated primarily via K ATP 163 302 177 178 Moreover, H₂S donors may regulate necroptosis and cytoskeletal dynamics in trophoblasts. Zhang et al. [ 303 18 304 Despite these promising results, several challenges remain. Most current studies rely on HTR-8/SVneo cell lines and animal models that may not fully reflect the complexity of human PE. The pharmacokinetics, safety profile, and optimal dosing of H₂S donors during pregnancy also require further investigation. Future work should focus on developing stable, targeted, and biocompatible H₂S-releasing platforms, along with rigorous preclinical and clinical evaluations to explore their translational potential in PE therapy. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) The role of H₂S in metabolic regulation has gained increasing attention. Endogenously produced by pancreatic β-cells, liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and the hypothalamus, H₂S participates in maintaining glucose homeostasis by regulating both local and systemic glucose metabolism [ 305 306 310 311 313 314 315 316 Desulfovibrio piger GDM, defined as glucose intolerance first diagnosed during pregnancy, is primarily driven by IR and insufficient β-cell compensation [ 317 317 320 321 321 322 323 325 326 327 328 329 329 306 330 However, current research remains at an early stage. Existing studies have focused primarily on animal models or in vitro experiments, and key mechanisms—such as H₂S involvement in insulin signaling, glucose transport, gut microbiota, and placental function, require further elucidation. Notably, the placenta plays a crucial role in maternal–fetal metabolic regulation by secreting cytokines and hormones that influence IR [ 331 332 PTB Uterine quiescence is essential for maintaining pregnancy to term. H₂S production increases during pregnancy but drops sharply at labor onset [ 170 69 214 333 96 334 335 336 337 ATP Anti-inflammatory actions of H₂S further contribute to uterine quiescence. You et al. [ 214 333 334 Other mechanisms have also been implicated. Na₂S-induced uterine relaxation involves DIDS-sensitive Cl⁻ channels and redox- and Ca²⁺-mediated pathways [ 338 339 Collectively, H₂S plays a multifaceted role in maintaining uterine quiescence by suppressing inflammation and regulating uterine smooth muscle. Donors such as NaHS, GYY4137, and ATB-346 show promise as tocolytics. However, theirpharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy require further optimization and clinical validation. RSA RSA, defined as three or more consecutive miscarriages before 20–28 weeks of gestation [ 340 341 342 343 207 344 345 346 24 Impaired trophoblast invasion is another contributor to RSA, as failure to remodel maternal spiral arteries can lead to placental insufficiency and pregnancy failure [ 347 24 FGR FGR is a major contributor to adverse perinatal outcomes, including intrauterine fetal death, neonatal asphyxia, and hypoxemia. Moreover, FGR has long-term consequences, increasing the risk of cognitive developmental delays in childhood and metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases in adulthood [ 348 349 349 350 163 ATP 351 352 Overall, H₂S appears to be a key regulator of placental perfusion, vascular remodeling, and oxidative stress control. H₂S donors such as GYY4137 and DATS show therapeutic promise in improving placental function and promoting fetal growth. However, most findings are preclinical; robust clinical studies are needed to evaluate safety, efficacy, and optimal delivery strategies to guide potential translation into FGR therapies. Co-Therapeutic potential of H₂S donors: exploring combined treatment strategies H₂S and CO are both endogenous gaseous signaling molecules with overlapping biological activities, including vasodilation, anti-inflammation, and cytoprotection. This functional similarity has prompted the development of dual-donor compounds capable of simultaneously releasing H₂S and CO. Bai et al. first synthesized such CO-H₂S dual-donors, which exhibited enhanced bioactivity and significant anti-proliferative effects [ 353 The combined application of H₂S and NO donors has also attracted growing attention. NO is a well-established vasodilator that supports vascular tone, inhibits platelet aggregation, and enhances microcirculation. By combining NO and H₂S donors, researchers aim to leverage their synergistic effects, particularly in vascular protection and oxidative stress reduction during pregnancy. For example, Wang et al. [ 354 355 Although current research has focused primarily on cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and neuroprotection, H₂S-NO and H₂S–CO dual donors show synergistic anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and vasodilatory effects that could be highly relevant for pregnancy complications. These include modulation of inflammation at the maternal–fetal interface, enhancement of placental perfusion, and amelioration of vascular dysfunction in pregnancy-induced hypertension and PE. However, studies on dual gasotransmitter donors in the context of pregnancy remain scarce, and many lack comprehensive assessments of pharmacokinetics, long-term safety, and translational feasibility. Future research should focus on integrating in vivo models, ex vivo placental systems, and clinical trials to validate the therapeutic potential of H₂S-based combination strategies in maternal–fetal medicine. Conclusions H₂S, an essential endogenous gasotransmitter, plays multifaceted roles in placental development by regulating trophoblast invasion, angiogenesis, vascular remodeling, and immune homeostasis. Emerging evidence indicates that dysregulated H₂S production is closely associated with pregnancy-related complications such as PE, FGR, and PTB. Preclinical studies suggest that H₂S donors can improve placental perfusion and alleviate vascular dysfunction, highlighting their therapeutic potential. However, clinical translation remains limited by challenges in targeted delivery, dosing, and safety. Future efforts should focus on developing stable, tissue-specific H₂S-releasing compounds, clarifying molecular mechanisms, and exploring synergy with other gasotransmitters like NO and CO. Clinical trials and biomarker-driven strategies are needed to validate efficacy and enable personalized interventions. H₂S-based therapies hold promise as innovative approaches for preventing and treating pregnancy-related disorders, with further research critical to advancing their clinical application.
