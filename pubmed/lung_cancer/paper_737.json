We investigated whether postoperative proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy reduces granulation tissue duration through reflux-mediated mechanisms. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 89 laryngeal cancer patients undergoing function-preserving surgery (May 2020-December 2024). Patients received either postoperative PPI therapy (n=32) or standard care (n=57). Primary endpoint was granulation tissue duration. Secondary endpoints included Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) and Reflux Finding Score (RFS) changes. Mediation analysis explored whether PPI effects operated through reflux improvement. Results Granulation formation rates were comparable between groups (65.6% vs 57.9%, P=0.188). Among patients developing granulation tissue (n=54), the PPI group demonstrated significantly shorter duration (4.0 [4.0, 5.0] vs 8.0 [6.0, 9.0] weeks, P<0.001). PPI therapy produced superior improvements in RSI (14.0 [13.0, 16.0] vs 4.0 [3.0, 4.0], P<0.001) and RFS scores (8.0 [6.8, 9.0] vs 2.0 [1.0, 3.0], P<0.001). Strong negative correlations existed between reflux improvement and granulation duration (RSI: r=−0.76; RFS: r=−0.74, both P<0.001). Mediation analysis revealed RSI improvement accounted for 16.18% of PPI’s therapeutic effect. Benefits were most pronounced in females, early-stage tumors, and patients with lower baseline RSI scores. Conclusion Postoperative PPI therapy significantly reduces granulation tissue duration following laryngeal cancer surgery through both reflux-dependent and independent mechanisms, supporting routine perioperative acid suppression in this population.

This condition affects a substantial proportion of patients, with studies reporting incidence rates of 53.8% at one-month post-surgery 3 4 5 6 LPR involves the retrograde flow of gastric contents into the laryngopharynx, causing epithelial damage, ciliary dysfunction, and enhanced inflammatory response in laryngeal tissues. 7 8 9 10 Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent the gold standard in LPR pharmacological management due to their potent acid-suppressive properties. PPIs effectively reduce acid secretion by irreversibly inhibiting the hydrogen-potassium ATPase enzyme system in gastric parietal cells. 11 12 13 Despite theoretical rationale and preliminary clinical observations suggesting the potential benefits of PPI therapy after laryngeal surgery, systematic investigations remain limited. 14 15 To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a retrospective cohort study examining the effects of postoperative PPI therapy on granulation tissue formation and resolution following laryngeal cancer surgery. We hypothesized that PPI therapy would reduce granulation tissue duration through mechanisms potentially mediated by improvements in reflux indices. Additionally, we sought to identify patient subgroups that might derive differential benefits from PPI therapy, thereby informing more targeted postoperative care protocols for laryngeal cancer patients. Methods Study Design and Participants We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study at the Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Cangzhou People’s Hospital (Hebei, China). We reviewed medical records of consecutive adults with pathologically confirmed laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent surgery between May 1, 2020, and December 31, 2024. The Institutional Review Board of Cangzhou People’s Hospital approved the study protocol with a waiver of informed consent for this retrospective review. Patients were eligible if they met all of the following criteria: (1) underwent primary surgical treatment for laryngeal cancer, including function-preserving procedures (CO 2 Patients underwent one of three function-preserving approaches: CO 2 2 Treatment Groups and Protocol In May 2020, our department implemented a new clinical protocol for post-laryngeal cancer surgery care that included systematic use of PPIs. This change in practice created two natural cohorts for comparison. The PPI group comprised patients treated after protocol implementation, while the non-PPI group included those treated before the protocol change who received standard care without acid-suppressive medication. Patients in the PPI group received acid-suppressive medication starting on the seventh postoperative day. Standard therapy consisted of esomeprazole (Nexium®, AstraZeneca, batch numbers varied by supply period) 40mg daily (20mg twice daily) or rabeprazole (Pariet ® Reflux Assessment The RSI (a 9-item self-administered questionnaire with scores ranging from 0 to 45) was used to evaluate reflux symptoms, with scores >13 considered abnormal. The RFS (an 8-item laryngoscopic assessment with scores ranging from 0 to 26) was used to document laryngeal findings associated with reflux, with scores >7 considered abnormal. These assessments were extracted from medical records at preoperative baseline and during postoperative follow-up visits. While post-operative changes may influence these assessments, they remain standard validated instruments for clinical practice. We acknowledge the limitations of symptom-based assessment in post-operative patients and recognize that future studies would benefit from objective measures such as salivary pepsin assays or 24-hour MII-pH monitoring. All evaluations were conducted by fellowship-trained laryngologists, with analysis focusing on between-group differences to minimize surgical confounding. For analysis purposes, postoperative assessments were categorized into early (4–6 weeks), intermediate (8–12 weeks), and late (16–24 weeks) periods. For patients with persistent granulation, additional assessments were conducted as clinically indicated. Follow-up and Outcome Definitions Patients were followed postoperatively with regular laryngoscopic examinations. The standard follow-up protocol included examinations at weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 during the first three months; at weeks 14, 16, 18, 20, and 24 during months 4–6; and at weeks 30, 36, 48, and 60 during the remainder of the first year. After week 60, patients were examined every six months. The primary endpoint was granulation duration, defined as the interval (weeks) from the first documented evidence of postoperative granulation to the first documentation of complete epithelialization that remained resolved on subsequent examinations. Secondary endpoints included: (i) RSI and RFS scores as documented during clinical visits; (ii) calculated change scores from preoperative to postoperative assessments; (iii) correlations between changes in reflux metrics and granulation duration; (iv) mediation of the treatment effect through changes in RSI and RFS. Statistical Analysis Continuous variables are presented as median (interquartile range) for non-normally distributed data or mean ± standard deviation for normally distributed data, and categorical variables as frequencies and percentages. Normality was assessed using Shapiro–Wilk tests. Between-group comparisons were performed using Mann–Whitney U t 2 Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R version 4.0.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Two-sided P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Surgical techniques were similarly distributed between groups (P=0.183), with CO 2 PPI therapy significantly reduced granulation duration across all surgical techniques and anatomical subsites. Multivariable analysis demonstrated consistent benefits across CO 2 Supplementary Tables S1 S7 Mediation Analysis A mediation analysis was performed to investigate whether the effects of PPI use on granulation duration were mediated by changes in reflux indices ( Table 5 Figure 4 Table 5 Mediation Analysis of RSI and RFS on the Association Between PPI Use and Granulation Duration Mediator and Effect Type Estimate (β) 95% CI P Percentage Mediated (%) RSI change Indirect effect −0.63 (−4.17, 2.13) 0.760 16.18 Direct effect −3.36 (−6.24, 0.16) 0.080 83.82 Total effect −3.98 (−4.90, −3.12) <0.001 100.00 RSI path coefficients PPI use → RSI change 10.95 (10.03, 11.87) <0.001 — PPI use → Granulation duration −3.25 (−6.39, −0.10) 0.049 — RSI change → Granulation duration −0.06 (−0.34, 0.21) 0.648 — RFS change Indirect effect 0.33 (−2.44, 2.47) 0.760 −4.83 Direct effect −4.32 (−6.66, −1.78) <0.001 104.83 Total effect −3.99 (−4.82, −3.16) <0.001 100.00 RFS path coefficients PPI use → RFS change 6.11 (5.46, 6.75) <0.001 — PPI use → Granulation duration −4.24 (−6.80, −1.68) 0.002 — RFS change → Granulation duration 0.05 (−0.35, 0.44) 0.817 — Notes Abbreviations Figure 4 Mediation analysis of PPI use on granulation duration. Mediation models with ( A B Abbreviations Discussion This retrospective cohort study demonstrates that postoperative PPI therapy significantly shortens granulation tissue duration following laryngeal cancer surgery without affecting its incidence. Patients receiving PPIs experienced approximately 4 weeks reduction in granulation persistence compared to non-PPI patients, with complete resolution by 6 weeks in the PPI group versus persistence beyond 12 weeks in some non-PPI cases. These findings have important clinical implications for postoperative care in laryngeal cancer patients. Our results align with recent evidence on acid suppression in wound healing. Jin et al 16 17 14 Our mediation analysis revealed complex relationships between PPI therapy, reflux indices, and healing outcomes. RSI improvement mediated 16.18% of PPI’s total effect on granulation duration. While not reaching statistical significance with our sample size, this represents a clinically relevant pathway warranting further investigation. Sim et al 18 13 Intriguingly, we observed a suppression effect with RFS (negative mediation percentage of −4.83%), indicating that when accounting for RFS changes, the direct impact of PPI on granulation duration was stronger (−4.32 weeks) than the total effect (−3.99 weeks). This counterintuitive finding reflects the well-documented phenomenon that RFS items are not as responsive to treatment as the overall clinical picture and tend to lag behind RSI, 19 20 21 22 The biological mechanisms underlying PPI’s beneficial effects likely involve multiple pathways. LPR-induced inflammation is characterized by neutrophilic infiltration, epithelial damage, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines in laryngeal tissues. 10 23 24 25 12 24 Our subgroup analysis revealed significant variations in PPI efficacy across patient populations. The effect was more pronounced in females compared to males, patients with early T-stage disease compared to late-stage, and those with lower pretreatment RSI scores compared to higher scores. The gender difference aligns with findings by Lechien et al 26 16 27 From a clinical perspective, our findings suggest that PPI therapy should be continued even when endoscopic improvement lags, as the beneficial effects on granulation resolution may precede visible changes in overall laryngeal inflammation. Furthermore, the divergent mediation patterns between RSI and RFS highlight the value of incorporating subjective and objective assessments when evaluating treatment response in this population. The substantial shortening of granulation duration with PPI therapy may translate to earlier functional recovery, reduced healthcare utilization, and improved patient quality of life. 16 Our study has several strengths, including a well-defined patient cohort, standardized PPI protocol, comprehensive reflux assessment, and detailed subgroup analysis. Mediation analysis provides insights into potential mechanistic pathways that extend beyond simple associations. However, several limitations warrant consideration. The retrospective design introduces potential selection bias, although we attempted to mitigate this through multivariable modeling. Post-operative RSI and RFS assessment presents methodological challenges, as patients invariably experience dysphonia and mucosal edema that subside during natural healing, potentially confounding genuine LPR-related changes. Nevertheless, the consistent PPI benefits across different surgical techniques, combined with mediation analysis showing RSI improvement accounted for only 16% of therapeutic effect, suggest that direct anti-inflammatory mechanisms predominate. Our stratified analysis demonstrates PPI efficacy across all surgical approaches, with comparable granulation formation rates (~60%) but consistent therapeutic benefit regardless of surgical invasiveness, indicating effects through common inflammatory pathways. We did not have direct measures of tissue inflammation or objective reflux assessments such as pH monitoring or pepsin detection. 28 29 Future research should include prospective randomized trials to establish causality and optimize treatment protocols. Investigating different PPI regimens, adjunctive therapies targeting complementary inflammatory pathways, and direct assessment of tissue inflammatory markers would provide deeper mechanistic insights. Evaluating patient-reported outcomes such as voice quality and swallowing function would further elucidate the clinical benefits of shortened granulation duration. Conclusion Our study provides evidence that postoperative PPI therapy significantly reduces granulation tissue duration following laryngeal cancer surgery, with effects that appear to operate through reflux-dependent and reflux-independent pathways. The contribution of symptomatic improvement to this effect, though not reaching statistical significance in our sample, represents a clinically meaningful pathway that warrants further investigation in larger studies. These findings support the consideration of routine postoperative PPI administration in this patient population, particularly for females, those with early-stage disease, and patients with lower baseline reflux symptom severity. The complex relationship between endoscopic findings and healing outcomes underscores the need for comprehensive assessment approaches when evaluating treatment efficacy in this clinical context.
