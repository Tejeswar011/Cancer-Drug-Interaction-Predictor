Despite being widely used in clinical practice for more than seven decades, the understanding of their in vivo disposition including tissue biodistribution and kinetics of the nanoparticle degradation at the cellular level is not well-understood. Moreover, the critical quality attributes that influence in vivo pharmacokinetics have not been fully defined. In particular, the carbohydrate moiety plays an influential role in how the nanoparticulate iron–carbohydrate complex interacts with the biological system. Developing a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model would facilitate a deeper understating of the key nanomedicine attributes that predict in vivo performance. Because endogenous iron metabolism complicates pharmacokinetic modeling for this complex class of drugs, models of gold nanoparticles may provide a substantive roadmap to begin to build a viable PBPK model for iron–carbohydrate nanomedicines. In the future, PBPK models that integrate recent mechanistic data regarding tissue biodistribution and intracellular iron kinetics for parameterization have the potential to improve manufacturing quality and clinical use of these complex drugs. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025 Key Points  Iron–carbohydrate nanomedicines exhibit complex in vivo disposition, and pharmacokinetic modeling is complicated by underlying endogenous iron metabolism. Gold nanoparticles could provide an informative roadmap for pharmacokinetic modeling of iron–carbohydrate nanomedicines. Leveraging existing relevant modeling of gold nanoparticles and mechanistic data from the iron–carbohydrate nanomedicine that can be parameterized could generate PBPK models that optimize manufacturing quality and dosing for these widely used medications. Introduction Nanomedicines are generally engineered to circumvent pharmacokinetic (PK) challenges associated with some small molecule drugs. These challenges may be attributed to inherent limitations from unacceptable toxicity profiles, poor target tissue penetration limiting their efficacy potential, or their half-lives being too short to adequately furnish the desired pharmacologic effect [ 1 2 3 5 6 One therapeutic area that has benefited greatly from nanotechnology is iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is a ubiquitous global health problem affecting more than 2 billion people worldwide. Etiologies of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are diverse and affect an expansive array of patients, including people with a myriad chronic illnesses (e.g., cancer, chronic kidney disease, and rheumatologic disorders), women across the age continuum (e.g., menstrual and other gynecologic blood losses), as well as people who experience blood loss during traumatic injury or surgery. Intravenous iron products are colloidal suspensions of nanoparticles that broadly consist of a complex of polynuclear ferric oxyhydroxide cores with a variety of heterogeneous carbohydrate ligands to ensure that rapid release of iron in plasma does not occur. The development of iron–carbohydrate nanoparticles was prompted by the observation that the rapid dissolution of iron salts or ferric oxyhydroxide products in plasma was associated with deleterious, and potentially fatal, adverse effects including hypotension and cardiovascular collapse [ 7 1 Fig. 1 Proposed 3D physical structure of two iron–carbohydrate nanoparticles, ferric carboxymaltose and iron sucrose (from [ 17 Challenges related to biorelevant linkage between tissue biodistribution (where the pharmacologic activity occurs) and serum concentrations of both free and nanoparticle bound drug pose a twofold, unique challenge for iron–carbohydrate nanomedicines. First, there is no validated, widely available assay to measure the plasma concentration of intact iron–carbohydrate nanoparticle [ 8 1 9 10 11 12 12 13 14 C max C max C max C max 15 Table 1 Iron species in human physiology Iron species Iron valence Location Function Transferrin-bound iron (TBI) Fe 3+ Serum Transport Ferritin (Serum) Fe 3+ Serum Surrogate marker for storage Ferritin (Tissue) Fe 3+ Intracellular (mainly liver, spleen, muscles, bone marrow) Storage Hemosiderin Fe 3+ Intracellular (mainly liver, spleen, muscles, bone marrow) Deep storage Hemoglobin Fe 2+ Erythrocytes Oxygen transport Labile iron Fe 3+ 2+ May contribute to oxidative stress Non-transferrin-bound iron (NTBI) Fe 3+ Serum Intermediate/transitory state in metabolism Labile iron pool (LIP) Fe 2+ Cytosol May contribute to oxidative stress Physical Structure of Iron–Carbohydrate Nanoparticles Iron–carbohydrate nanoparticles consist of polynuclear ferric oxyhydroxide cores that vary in crystallinity structure and are surrounded by carbohydrate ligands. These nanoparticles differ in their particle size, particle size distribution, molecular weight, surface charge, and chemical composition of the carbohydrate ligands (Table 2 16 3 17 17 Table 2.

It should be noted that multiple techniques should be utilized to generate the multiple vantage points of the structure to better understand their structure–function relationship in vivo. Generally, the iron cores are in the range of 2 nm in size, and the hydrodynamic diameter of the whole particles determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) can range between 8 and 30 nm [ 17 21 17 21 22 z 22 23 22 17 . 17 1 17 Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME) Considerations for Iron–Carbohydrate Complexes in the Context of PBPK Models Absorption Traditional PK approaches for small molecule drugs follow the well-established paradigm that bioavailability is 100% following intravenous injection. However, this assumption must be fundamentally challenged when considering in vivo behavior of nanomedicines. As described previously, iron–carbohydrate nanoparticles must be delivered to the MPS to be biodegraded and metabolized to allow iron to be released from the nanoparticle and then incorporated into normal iron storage (tissue ferritin). The rate and extent of iron uptake and release have not been established in any in vitro model, and any validated model would need to have the capability to discern iron kinetics in the context of elevated hepcidin concentrations. A study funded by the US Food and Drug Administration attempted to develop an in vitro to in vivo correlation (IVIVC) model based on labile iron release from iron–carbohydrate nanoparticles using a chelatable iron high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay [ 24 25 9 26 25 14 27 Distribution The bioavailability of iron from the iron–carbohydrate complexes depends on cellular-level metabolism, making tissue distribution a critical factor in understanding and modeling the in vivo behavior of iron–carbohydrate complexes in both health and diseased conditions. Therefore, refining and validating in vitro uptake methodologies would greatly improve the predictive performance of parameters generated from these experiments [ 28 29 2 Fig. 2 Proposed biodisposition pathway for iron–carbohydrate nanoparticles (from [ 71 In an early study from 1969 using iron dextran, Henderson and Hillman administered radiolabeled ( 59 30 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{MPS storage }} = {\\text{ Total infused iron }}{-} \\, \\left( {{\\text{Iron in plasma at bone marrow aspiration }} + {\\text{ Iron in RBCs}}} \\right)$$\\end{document} MPS storage = Total infused iron - Iron in plasma at bone marrow aspiration + Iron in RBCs A plot of bone marrow iron grading versus calculated MPS stores showed an apparent positive correlation, emphasizing the role of MPS distribution in mobilizing bioavailable iron for transport to the bone marrow. Red cell utilization was determined by measuring whole blood radioactivity 10–14 days post-iron dextran infusion. In otherwise healthy anemic patients, red blood cell uptake of the administered iron ranged from 89 to 96%. By contrast, patients who were described by the authors to have a “complicating illness of an inflammatory nature” had far lower red blood cell uptake of radioactive iron, ranging from 26 to 86%. These data underscore substantial interpatient variability that must be accounted for in any models of iron–carbohydrate complex administration. In 1999, Beshara et al. evaluated the distribution of tracer labeled ( 52 59 31 33 The limitations of detailed tissue biodistribution studies in humans prompted a series of systematic biodistribution studies in an anemic male rat model [ 34 C max Metabolism Iron–carbohydrate complexes do not exhibit traditional drug–enzyme interactions that lead to water-soluble, excretable metabolites. In addition to continuous background endogenous iron metabolism, this poses another relevant challenge to developing PBPK models, as these types of interactions have been extensively modeled and can be relatively easily applied to new models. The exact mechanism of metabolism of the iron–carbohydrate complexes has not been extensively studied. It is also important to note that normal iron metabolism, in the absence of administration of an iron–carbohydrate complex, remains poorly understood when inflammation or other interfering conditions are present [ 35 36 Excretion Iron is typically highly conserved, and only limited excretion occurs in healthy patients, mainly by shedding of the gastrointestinal epithelium, gastrointestinal blood loss, menstrual blood losses, sweating, and exfoliation of skin cells [ 32 37 38 The in vivo biodisposition of iron–carbohydrate nanomedicines is complex and this translates to formidable challenges in characterizing their PK profile in vivo [ 6 39 40 41 40 Development of PBPK Models for Iron–Carbohydrate Nanoparticles: Challenges and Opportunities PBPK modeling is a computational modeling and simulation process that describes the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of chemicals, nanoparticles, and/or their metabolites in the body on the basis of the interrelationships among key physiological, biochemical, and physicochemical properties using mathematical equations [ 42 43 44 47 48 49 It is well-recognized that the ADME properties of small molecular drugs and nanoparticles are quite different. As such, the PBPK modeling strategies for small molecular drugs and nanoparticles are also different. Table 4 Table 4 Comparisons in pharmacokinetic properties and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling between small molecules and nanoparticles PBPK modeling considerations Small molecules Nanoparticles Dose metrics and unit In mass per unit volume, such as mg/L or mM/L for concentration of a chemical in plasma or mg/kg in tissues Usually, the same as small molecules in mass per unit volume [ 91 92 94 Absorption Approaches to simulate extravascular absorption for small molecules are well established. Depending on the administration route and availability of data, it could be a simple first-order linear absorption or a more complex mechanistic model, such as the advanced compartmental absorption and transit (ACAT) model for oral absorption. Approaches to simulate extravascular absorption of NPs remain to be established. In general, the absorption of NPs from extravascular routes is very low owing to the size of the particle. This makes it difficult to collect time-dependent kinetic data to build a PBPK model for extravascular routes. Currently most PBPK models for NPs are only for IV route, with a few that also include oral route, such as gold nanoparticles [ 52 95 Model compartment structure Both perfusion-limited and diffusion-limited model structures are appropriate depending on the physicochemical properties of the chemical (e.g., molecular weight, lipophilicity, and hydrophilicity) Most existing PBPK models for NPs are based on a permeability-limited model structure, such as gold nanoparticles [ 52 61 Circulation through body For many small molecules, systemic distribution occurs through the blood circulatory system Trafficking through the lymphatic system may also occur and dictate the structure of the PBPK model used. Note that for PBPK modeling of monoclonal antibodies, it is well accepted that the lymphatic system plays an important role in tissue distribution and should be included in a PBPK model [ 96 49 65 97 Plasma protein binding Small molecules can undergo nonspecific protein binding (e.g., plasma albumin) by an equilibrium process. This can be described as a saturable process (e.g., association rate constant, dissociation rate constant, and maximal binding capacity). Alternatively, this can be simply described using a plasma protein binding percentage assuming this percentage remains the same across a wide dose range, which can be supported if experimental data are available. NPs may associate with multiple proteins and other macromolecules in a dynamic fashion, sensitive to the environment, to form a biocorona that could be a primary determinant of biodistribution and elimination. Protein coronas could be “hard” or “soft” depending on the affinity and interaction between NPs and proteins. Approaches to incorporate biocorona formation kinetics into a PBPK model for NPs have not been established, but mathematical models describing the in vitro kinetics of nanoparticle-protein corona formation have been published [ 98 99 Cellular uptake In most cases, cellular uptake occurs by either diffusion down a concentration gradient or by classic molecular transporter systems (organic acid transporter system, p-glycoprotein, etc.) that are well described using saturable but reversible models (e.g., Michaelis-Menten) Cellular uptake is via capacity-limited vesicular transport systems with charge and size specificity (e.g., phagocytosis, micro- and macro-pinocytosis, and membrane rafts) [ 100 49 Tissue trapping Small molecules which are weak acids or bases get ion-trapped in tissues with different pH, as only the noncharged moiety can diffuse across the membrane. This process can be calculated using the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation NPs have colloidal properties that result in aggregation or agglomeration depending upon local microenvironment (pH and ionic strength). NPs may change size and surface properties when they enter tissue sites or cellular compartments (e.g., lysosomes), which may influence their movement, often trapping on the side of membrane promoting aggregation [ 101 102 First-pass effects The pathway of absorption of a small molecule chemical into the body may have a major impact on its subsequent deposition by first-pass hepatic metabolism If an absorbed NP forms a tight association with a biomolecule (e.g., protein and surfactant) in the process of absorption, its subsequent deposition could be changed. Metabolism or biotransformation Common for small molecule chemicals and are mediated by Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 enzymes. Metabolism is usually simulated using the Michaelis–Menten equation and can be measured using in vitro systems and then extrapolated to in vivo using physiological scaling factors. If experimental data are not available, metabolism can also be described using a simple first-order equation provided that the drug doses are within the linear kinetic range Many “hard” NPs (e.g., metal and carbon) are relatively inert and often too large to be degraded or metabolized by enzymes. However, several metal NPs, such as silver NPs, can be metabolized to become silver ions.[ 95 49 Excretion Mainly through urinary, fecal, and biliary excretion routes, and can be described using either first-order linear progress or saturable process depending on the mechanism and availability of data Excretion is generally slow for NPs due to long retention time in tissues, especially in tissues of the RES system (e.g., liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys) and the size limitation. Usually, small NPs (≤5–6 nm) are excreted through the kidney, and larger NPs are mainly excreted via biliary pathway [ 103 104 IVIVE IVIVE approaches are well established for small molecules. It is common to determine PBPK parameters in vitro and then extrapolate to a whole-body PBPK model using physiological scaling factors. The latest PBPK guideline from OECD provides details on how to develop and evaluate/validate a PBPK model based on in silico and in vitro data only Most published PBPK models for NPs were built on the basis of in vivo pharmacokinetic data. One recent study demonstrated it was possible to develop a PBPK model for NPs (e.g., quantum dots and polystyrene nanoparticles) based on in vitro cellular uptake data [ 65 51 48 Interspecies extrapolation It is well accepted that PBPK models are a scientifically-sound tool to perform interspecies extrapolation for small molecules Only a few studies have attempted to extrapolate PBPK models for NPs from animals to humans using the same approaches used for small molecules [ 57 62 105 PBPK modeling guidelines There are multiple guideline documents on how to develop, evaluate/validate, apply, and document PBPK models, such as from the EPA, WHO, and OECD PBPK modeling guidelines that are specific to NPs are still not available. In fact, a recent study showed that some commonly used PBPK modeling approaches for small molecules, such as route-to-route extrapolation, may not be applicable to NPs [ 52 Regulatory acceptance Multiple regulatory agencies (e.g., EPA, Health Canada, OECD, WHO) accept PBPK models in different areas, such as drug discovery and development and human health risk assessment of environmental chemicals The PBPK approach by itself is accepted by regulatory agencies in risk assessment of both small molecular chemicals and NPs. Several studies have shown that it is feasible to use PBPK models to assess the human health risk of a few types of NPs, such as silver nanoparticles [ 106 95 53 This table is modified based on Table 5 from Lin et al. [ 46 107 1 108 IVIVE NPs RES General PBPK Principles for Small Molecules and Applicability to Nanomedicines For small molecules, intravenous injection can be described as a single bolus dose that is directly added to the venous blood compartment. Following extravascular administration, the absorption process can be described as a simple first-order linear absorption process or a more complex mechanistic model, such as the advanced compartmental absorption and transit model for oral absorption [ 50 V max K m PBPK models can be developed using many different software platforms, including module-based software (e.g., Simcyp, GastroPlus, and PK-Sim), general programming software (e.g., R, Berkeley Madonna, and Python), traditional PK modeling software (e.g., Phoenix), and others (e.g., Excel). Depending on the software program, PBPK modelers may write all the mathematical equations for a new PBPK model if they choose the general programming software. Alternatively, PBPK researchers may use a module-based software platform; in which case, they can choose a prebuilt template and do not need to write the mathematical equations or do any programming. PBPK models for small molecules are very useful for many different applications mentioned above because these models can be used to predict the target organ dosimetry of chemicals, evaluate drug–drug interactions, perform in vitro to in vivo extrapolation, interspecies extrapolation (e.g., from animals to humans), extrapolation from the healthy to diseased subjects and across life stages, as well as extrapolation across exposure paradigms (e.g., from higher doses to lower doses, from short-term exposure to long-term exposure, and exposure from one administration route to another). However, due to the differences in ADME properties between small molecules and nanoparticles, many of these PBPK modeling strategies that work well for small molecules are not applicable to nanoparticles. For example, studies have shown that traditional route-to-route extrapolation and IVIVE for small molecules are not applicable to nanoparticles [ 51 52 Existing PBPK Models for Nanoparticles While there are still several challenges for PBPK modeling of nanoparticles, many PBPK models have been developed for different types of nanoparticles. There are already several review articles summarizing the progress and challenges of PBPK modeling for different types of nanoparticles [ 48 49 53 55 51 52 56 58 Compared with other types of nanoparticles, such as iron–carbohydrate nanoparticles, it is relatively simple to develop PBPK models for gold nanoparticles for the following reasons. First, gold is very stable and does not metabolize, biotransform, or degrade in the body; thus, it is not necessary to consider complex metabolism, dissolution, or biotransformation processes. Second, compared with other metal-containing nanoparticles such as iron oxide, titanium dioxide, and quantum dots, gold nanoparticles are considered inert and relatively safe; thus, it is not necessary to consider any toxicological responses that gold nanoparticles may induce that may change their ADME properties. Additionally, there are reliable and highly sensitive analytical methods, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), that can accurately quantify the plasma and tissue concentrations of gold, thereby providing high-quality PK data to build good-quality PBPK models. All of these factors make gold nanoparticles an ideal example to explore PBPK modeling methodology for nanoparticles in general. Among published PBPK models, Lin et al. published the first PBPK model for gold nanoparticles in healthy mice after intravenous injection [ 59 49 60 61 Built upon the PBPK model in healthy mice, Lin et al. extrapolated the model to healthy rats and pigs, then conducted an animal-to-human extrapolation by extrapolating the model from each animal species to humans separately, and then compared the performances of the derived three human models by evaluating with a clinical trial dataset of gold nanoparticles in mice [ 62 Cheng et al. extrapolated the Lin et al. model from healthy mice to tumor-bearing mice by including a tumor compartment [ 59 63 Based upon the PBPK model structure from Cheng et al. and the Nano-Tumor Database, Chou et al. incorporated machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches into this model to create a so-called artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted PBPK model for different types of nanoparticles [ 63 64 It should be noted that the above-mentioned PBPK models for gold nanoparticles are all based on single intravenous injection data. Chou et al. extrapolated the model from a single IV route to a multiroute model including intravenous injection, oral gavage, inhalational exposure, and intratracheal instillation [ 52 In vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) or correlation (IVIVC) has also been explored for gold nanoparticles. Dubaj et al. (2022) determined the in vitro cellular uptake and in vivo biodistribution of PEG-coated gold nanoparticles and used in silico PBPK modeling to evaluate the IVIVC. The authors measured the cellular uptake and release of PEG-coated gold nanoparticles in different human cell lines, including TH1, A549, HepG2, and 16HBE [ 51 40 65 The PBPK modeling strategies based on gold nanoparticles described above have not been applied to develop PBPK models for iron–carbohydrate nanomedicines but have been successfully applied to develop PBPK models for metal oxide-based nanoparticles, such as superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) [ 40 30 66 36 67 12 However, a recent study developed a PBPK model for intravenous administration of iron solutions in mice, and then the model was extrapolated to simulate the whole-body distribution of FCM nanoparticles in rats after intravenous administration [ 68 69 While the PBPK model by Fan et al. (2024) was for iron solutions in mice, the authors extrapolated it to simulate tissue distribution of FCM nanoparticles in rats and humans [ 68 11 70 The PBPK model by Fan et al. suggests that it is possible to build a PBPK model to simulate plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of iron solutions and iron carbohydrate nanoparticles in animals and humans, and their model provides a good starting point [ 68 3 40 Fig. 3 Schematic of a proposed PBPK model structure for iron carbohydrate nanoparticles. A B IH IT IV RBCs Another challenge is that different patients will have different levels of endogenous iron, differential local levels of inflammation that may require increased iron loads, thus changing the distribution profiles of iron–carbohydrate nanoparticles, and different pharmacodynamic markers, such as hemoglobin and serum ferritin, which will be quite different among different patient groups, such as healthy anemic patients, diseased anemic patients, and patients with iron deficiency without anemia. These patient-specific physiological factors are inextricably linked to the pharmacodynamic profile and must be considered when building a PBPK model for iron carbohydrate nanoparticles in humans. Finally, one critical aspect of building a validated PBPK model is to evaluate the model prediction with an independent dataset for the same drug formulation or a bioequivalent formulation from a different study. The model by Fan et al. was built on the basis of data from a single study in mice, without independent validation with another mouse dataset, which is a limitation [ 68 28 36 11 8 Summary Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are disease states that have benefited from nanotechnology for over seven decades, allowing the safe and effective administration of iron parenterally. Despite widespread clinical use, knowledge gaps remain regarding the PK profile of the intact nanoparticles and the complexity of studying PK in vivo due to background endogenous iron homeostasis. Although literature contains a plethora of PK studies on iron–carbohydrate complexes, the PK profiles are generated largely from total serum iron, which contains multiple, dynamic iron species, including drug-bound iron. Additionally, most of the sampling schemes precede uptake into the MPS, hampering dissection of the structure–function relationship. To accelerate the understanding of the PK/PD profiles of this class of complex drugs requires identifying the critical quality attributes for individual iron–carbohydrate complexes and establishing reproducible physicochemical characterization techniques. Only then can translational studies inform parameterization from potential in vitro release tests or cell uptake models for computational models. PBPK models that fully consider the multiple, complex parameters related to iron–carbohydrate nanoparticle use in patient populations have the potential to improve evaluation and clinical use of these complex drugs.
