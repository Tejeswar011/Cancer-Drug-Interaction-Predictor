This is a retrospective cohort study utilizing data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v3.1) database. Participants were categorized into tertiles based on LAR levels (low: <0.46, intermediate: 0.46–0.81, high: >0.81). The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare survival probabilities among patients in different LAR tertiles. Multivariable COX proportional hazards regression analysis and restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression were employed to assess the association between LAR levels and mortality in hypertensive patients. Additionally, subgroup and mediation analyses were conducted. A total of 4,504 patients were included in this study. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that hypertensive patients in the highest LAR tertile had the highest mortality rate (log-rank test, P P P P Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-18481-1.

Traditional biomarkers, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and renal function indicators, provide some insight into patient conditions but have restricted predictive value 7 In recent years, there has been growing interest in exploring novel biomarkers for critical care applications. For instance, lactate, a marker of tissue hypoxia and metabolic dysfunction, has been widely used for early diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and risk stratification in patients with septic shock 8 9 10 11 15 This study aims to explore the relationship between LAR levels and all-cause mortality in critically ill hypertensive patients, providing valuable insights into their short- and long-term prognosis. The findings may serve as a basis for developing strategies to improve survival and recovery outcomes in this high-risk population. Methods Data source In this retrospective cohort study, we utilized data obtained from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV, v3.1) database. This publicly accessible, de-identified dataset is provided by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, Massachusetts 16 17 One of the authors Zhichao Zhao was granted full access to the MIMIC-IV database and extracted the relevant data for this study using certification number [Certification Number: 64701219]. The use of MIMIC-IV was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of BIDMC, and the requirement for individual patient consent was waived as the dataset fully complies with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations. This study was reported in accordance with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for observational research 18 Selection of participants The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Flowchart of the study population selection. 1) Patients diagnosed with hypertension, identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes (Supplementary Table 1). 2) Patients aged 18 years or older. 3) Patients admitted to the ICU for the first time. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) Patients with missing survival data. 2) Patients with missing LAR or BMI data. 3) Patients with erroneous survival time or baseline data due to medical record errors. Finally, extreme LAR values outside the 1st–99th percentiles were removed ( n Exposure The primary exposure variable in this study was the LAR 19 Variable extraction The key variables extracted for analysis included demographics (age, body mass index [BMI], sex, and race); clinical comorbidities (heart failure [HF], myocardial infarction [MI], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM], cancer [CA], chronic kidney disease [CKD], and acute kidney injury [AKI]); initial ICU laboratory results (hemoglobin, red blood cell count, platelet count, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, and white blood cell count); treatment measures (antihypertensive medications and glucocorticoids); vital signs (non-invasive blood pressure monitoring [NBPM], respiratory rate [RR], oxygen saturation [SpO₂], and temperature in Fahrenheit [Temperaturef]); and severity scores, including the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. APACHE II was not included due to extensive missingness in MIMIC-IV and collinearity with SOFA and SAPS II, which were more consistently available and demonstrated robust prognostic value. Due to excessive missing data for BMI, samples with missing BMI values were excluded. For other variables with missing data of ≤ 20%, multiple imputation was performed to handle missing values 20 Statistical analyses Continuous variables following a normal distribution were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and compared using the t-test. Non-normally distributed continuous variables were expressed as median (interquartile range [IQR]) and compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were presented as percentages and compared using the χ² test. The t-test was strictly applied to normally distributed variables, confirmed via Shapiro-Wilk test. For non-normal variables, Mann-Whitney U was applied. This ensures appropriate statistical testing. To evaluate the 28-day survival differences among the three patient groups after ICU admission, Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves were first applied. Subsequently, a Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess the prognostic impact of LAR on survival, analyzing it as both a continuous and categorical variable. Candidate variables for Cox regression were selected a priori based on clinical relevance, prior literature, and data availability. A total of six Cox regression models were constructed, with each model progressively incorporating more covariates. The unadjusted model included no covariates, while Model 1 was adjusted for baseline demographic characteristics. Model 2 further adjusted for comorbidities, and Model 3 additionally incorporated treatment measures and vital signs within the ICU. Model 4 included the first recorded laboratory results in the ICU, and Model 5 further incorporated clinical severity scores. To assess multicollinearity, the variance inflation factor (VIF) was calculated for all models, with VIF > 10 indicating significant collinearity (Supplementary Table 2) 21 22 23 To further clarify the relationship between LAR and survival prognosis. Sensitivity analyses, including restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression and subgroup analyses, were conducted to verify the robustness of the findings. RCS analysis with four knots was applied across all six Cox models. Cox models were adjusted stepwise for demographics, comorbidities, treatments, labs, and severity scores (SOFA, SAPS II). RCS with four knots tested nonlinear associations. Subgroup analyses were performed based on comorbidities and treatment measures. Additionally, a mediation analysis was conducted to explore the potential mechanisms by which LAR influences 28-day ICU survival. This mediation analysis specifically tested whether illness severity (SOFA and SAPS II) explained part of the LAR effect on mortality. By quantifying direct and indirect effects, we demonstrated that although severity scores mediate part of the relationship, a significant direct effect of LAR remained, strengthening the evidence for LAR as an independent biomarker. The cumulative effect of LAR on survival was divided into the average direct effect (ADE), while the average causal mediation effect (ACME) represented the effect mediated through an intermediate variable. Mediation was considered statistically significant if both the association between X and M and the association between M and Y were significant 24 A two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.3.1).

Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 RCS analysis RCS analysis showed a nonlinear association between LAR and 28-day ICU mortality in the unadjusted model (P for nonlinearity = 0.026), with mortality risk increasing as LAR levels rose (Fig. 3 P P  Fig. 3 RCS analysis of the association between LAR and 28-day ICU mortality. Subgroup analysis Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the association between LAR and 28-day ICU mortality remained significant across most subgroups (Fig. 4 P P  Fig. 4 Subgroup analysis of the association between LAR and 28-day ICU mortality. Mediation analysis Mediation analysis demonstrated that SOFA and SAPS II partially mediated the association between LAR and ICU survival time (Fig. 5 P P P  Fig. 5 Mediation analysis of LAR’s effect on 28-day ICU survival time. Discussion This study utilizes the extensive MIMIC-IV database to explore the relationship between LAR levels and mortality in critically ill hypertensive patients. Our findings indicate that even after accounting for other factors that may influence the risk of mortality in critically ill hypertensive patients, higher LAR levels are still associated with an increased risk of death. Importantly, the mediation analysis is presented as a supporting analysis and indicates that illness severity mediates part—but not all—of LAR’s association with mortality. Furthermore, the RCS analysis reveals that this association is non-linear. Additionally, subgroup analysis further identifies an interaction between BMI, hypertension treatment, and mortality in hypertensive patients. Lastly, mediation analysis demonstrates that SOFA and SAPS II scores partially mediate the association between LAR and ICU survival time. Although APACHE II was excluded due to missingness and collinearity concerns, a subset sensitivity analysis with available APACHE II data showed consistent associations. LAR, as a novel biomarker, has demonstrated significant value in the prognosis assessment of various critical illnesses in recent years. A single-center retrospective cohort study revealed 25 26 27 28 We explicitly defined variable selection as based on clinical relevance, prior literature, and data availability to support model robustness. We restated tertile cutoffs (< 0.46, 0.46–0.81, > 0.81) and rationale for balanced distribution and reproducibility. Although our study did not delve deeply into the association between elevated LAR levels and increased mortality risk in critically ill hypertensive patients, we hypothesize that the inverse relationship between the two may be attributed to several physiological mechanisms. First, tissue hypoxia and lactate metabolism dysfunction: Hypertensive crises can lead to vascular endothelial dysfunction and inadequate microcirculatory perfusion, resulting in increased anaerobic metabolism and lactate accumulation. Literature suggests that elevated lactate levels are associated with high anion gap (AG) metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients, and unmeasured organic anions (UOAs) may further exacerbate lactate’s inhibition of mitochondrial function 29 30 27 28 30 28 31 27 26 31 In our study, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis further confirmed the existence of a non-linear relationship, with an increasing risk of mortality as LAR levels rise. Subgroup analysis revealed that among critically ill hypertensive patients, those with a BMI > 30 and those not receiving hypertension treatment had a higher risk of mortality. This may be related to the unique metabolic disturbances and chronic inflammatory state associated with obesity. Studies have shown 32 33 32 33 33 32 33 33 32 However, our study has several limitations that warrant discussion. First, as a retrospective cohort analysis, this study cannot entirely avoid the influence of confounding factors. For instance, variations in patient fluid resuscitation strategies and comorbidity management may affect lactate and albumin levels, but these treatment details were not fully recorded in the database. Additionally, the MIMIC-IV database lacks certain indicators closely related to the pathophysiology of hypertension (e.g., inflammatory cytokine levels, oxidative stress markers), which may limit a deeper exploration of the mechanisms underlying the association between LAR and prognosis. Second, although MIMIC-IV is a rich resource, its data originate from a single center, which may restrict the generalizability of our findings.
