Background MAST2 (Microtubule-Associated Serine/Threonine Kinase 2) is an enigmatic serine/threonine kinase that is considered to bridge microtubule-associated cytoskeletal architecture through its phospho-regulatory networks. Yet, MAST2 remains a dark horse in the human kinome, as the molecular details on its structure, upstream regulators, and downstream phosphorylation targets remain unknown. Methods and results To interpret MAST2-linked phospho-signaling dynamics, PubMed-indexed articles were curated based on predefined MeSH terms to obtain global cellular phosphoproteomics datasets. Among 105 class I phosphosites in MAST2 identified across cellular phosphoproteomics datasets, 2 phosphosites, S74 and S148, were represented more abundantly compared to other phosphosites, making them predominant and functionally significant. Expression coregulation analysis, aimed at interpreting phosphosites that consistently show either similar or opposite patterns of expression, was performed by computing the expression patterns of phosphosites in parallel with the predominant MAST2 phosphosite. Their frequencies were then ranked across differential datasets to ensure consistency, and Fisher's exact test was performed to assess the likelihood of the coregulation pattern. Potential biases within the datasets were mitigated using additional cutoffs. Interpreting these datasets, we identified the majority of high-confidence coregulated protein phosphosites of both predominant phosphosites to be involved in transcriptional regulation. This is consistent with reports that a nearby Arg89Gln mutation in MAST2 disrupts its transcriptional regulatory activity. Co-occurrence analysis of phosphosites within MAST2 revealed that these predominant sites tend to co-occur positively and share similarity in expression coregulation patterns with phosphosites in other proteins. Finally, novel upstream kinases that potentially phosphorylate the predominant phosphosites of MAST2, as well as potential downstream substrates that are phosphorylated by MAST2, were also identified from the high-confidence coregulation dataset. Conclusions We propose that phosphorylations at S74 and S148 of MAST2 are functionally similar, and that these phosphosites are candidate regulatory sites influencing the transcriptional regulatory activity of MAST2. Highlights • S74 and S148 of MAST2 are key phosphosites that positively co-occur. • S74 and S148 are candidate sites influencing the transcription regulatory activity of MAST2. • Identified MAST2-linked regulatory network of predicted kinases/substrates.

Specifically, the PDZ domain binds to the TKV motif of PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog), regulating its phosphatase activity, which in turn dephosphorylates PIP3 (Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate), thereby acting as a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling, a pathway central to cell division, survival, and tumorigenesis [ 5 [7] [8] [9] 10 11 6 Although MAST2 appears to be a kinase that links phospho-signaling to microtubule and cytoskeletal organisation, its molecular specificities regarding substrates, interacting partners, and protein complexes are poorly understood. However, overexpression of MAST2 has been reported to have proliferative effects both in vivo in vitro 12 13 14 15 11 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Assembly of global phosphoproteome datasets to investigate MAST2 phosphosite regulations The global cellular phosphoproteome datasets were curated and assembled in our laboratory as previously reported [ 16 17 18 2.2 Identification of predominant phosphosites representing MAST2 in phosphoproteomes The class-1 MAST2 phosphosites were extracted from human cellular phosphoproteome profile datasets. The number of qualitative profiles and quantitative differentially regulated datasets where each phosphosite of MAST2 is detected was computed and ranked. MAST2 phosphosites were represented across a wide range of frequencies in the cellular phosphoproteomics datasets, with certain phosphosites being poorly detected in multiple datasets, while others were frequently represented across the phosphoproteomics datasets. Phosphosites of MAST2 that are most frequently represented across multiple profiling and differential phosphoproteomics datasets were considered as predominant phosphosites of MAST2. 2.3 Identification and categorization of coregulated protein phosphosites with MAST2 predominant phosphosites Datasets with representations of Class 1 MAST2 phosphosites with their corresponding PubMed accessions are listed in Supplementary Table 1A and B To assess the significance and likelihood of the coregulation patterns, a one-sided Fisher's exact test (FET) was applied using a contingency table covering all possible patterns of phosphosite pairs occurrence across the phosphoproteomics datasets ( Supplementary Table 2A and B 19 2.4 Co-occurrence analysis of MAST2 phosphosites Phosphosites that co-occur within a protein are reported to be functionally associated [ 19 2.5 Retrieval of MAST2 interacting proteins The protein-protein interactors of MAST2 were obtained from databases such as HPRD [ 20 21 22 23 2.6 Kinase/substrates prediction of MAST2 Since no experimentally confirmed kinases or substrates for MAST2 were available, in-silico 24 25 26 27 2.7 Data visualisation Cytoscape [ 28 29 30 The PeptideCutter tool from the protein identification and analysis tools in the ExPASy server was used to identify trypsin-digested peptides of MAST2 [ 31 3 Results 3.1 Class-I phosphosites in MAST2 from global cellular phosphoproteome datasets Phosphoproteomics has evolved considerably over the past decades, owing to technical innovations, enhanced dataset accessibility, and its significance in elucidating cellular signaling and disease development. Aligned with that, Microtubule-associated serine/threonine kinase 2 (MAST2) emerged as a heavily phosphorylated protein kinase, with 104 phosphorylation sites reported in PhosphoSitePlus [ 32 33 Supplementary Table 1A–B The profiling datasets reported phosphorylations at 96 phosphosites in MAST2, while the differential data in total comprised expression patterns of 64 phosphosites. Considering these phosphosites are detected from diverse experimental/biological conditions, we ranked the frequency of detection of each phosphosite across profiling and differential datasets. Interestingly, these phosphosites ranged in frequency from weakly detected to abundantly detected phosphosites of MAST2. As abundantly detected phosphosites could be more reliably associated with the function of the protein, we looked for phosphosites that have the highest frequency of detection in both profiling and differential datasets. The most abundantly detected phosphosites were S74 and S148, with frequencies of 681 and 563 in profiling datasets and 70 and 48 in differential datasets. Hence, we considered them as predominant phosphosites of MAST2. Considering the positions of the predominant sites relative to the kinase domain, recent work from our team has classified MAST2 as a kinase with 'predominant phosphosites outside the kinase domain' (Pokd) [ 34 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Lollipop plot and structural visualisation of MAST2. (A) (B) (C) Fig. 1 3.2 Co-occurrence of phosphorylations within MAST2 Previously, Li et al., 2017 reported that the phosphorylations that co-occur within a protein are functionally associated [ 19 Fig. 2 Supplementary Table 3A Fig. 2 Phosphosites in MAST2 and their co-occurrence patterns. (A) (B) Fig. 2 3.3 Expression coregulation analysis of the predominant phosphosites of MAST2 To infer deeper insights into the regulation of MAST2 and its role in cellular processes, we took up a coregulation analysis approach to interpret the phosphosites in other proteins that consistently show expression co-differential regulation with the predominant phosphosites of MAST2. Initially, phosphosites reported in each differential dataset are classified and ranked based on the upregulation or downregulation patterns corresponding to the expression status of the predominant site. These positively or negatively coregulated phosphosites were further scrutinised using a stringent inclusion and exclusion criterion to ensure consistency in coregulation pattern and avoid any potential biases in the datasets. Subsequently, 156 positively coregulated and 24 negatively coregulated high-confidence PsOPs were identified with MAST2 S74, and 550 positively coregulated and 18 negatively coregulated high-confidence PsOPs were identified with MAST2 S148 ( Table 1 Supplementary Table 2C–D Table 1 Table containing the number of phosphosite coregulated with MAST2 predominant phosphosites after applying confidence cutoffs. Table 1 Predominant Site Type of Coregulation Number of coregulated Phosphosites after FET <0.05 Number of coregulated Phosphosites after frequency ≥15 % Number of coregulated Phosphosites after PMID confidence ≥3 Number of coregulated Phosphosites after Experimental code confidence ≥3 S74 Positive Coregulation 13250 164 156 156 S74 Negative Coregulation 8308 32 24 24 S148 Positive Coregulation 18216 595 550 550 S148 Negative Coregulation 6410 29 18 18 The top positively coregulated PsOPs with MAST2 S74 were VCL S290 and ANKS1A S647, with positive coregulation frequencies of 21 and 16, respectively, and the top negatively coregulated PsOPs with MAST2 S74 were HARS2 S67 and USP36 S464, with negative coregulation frequencies of 21 and 16, respectively. Similarly, the top positively coregulated PsOPs with MAST2 S148 were SRRM2 S1124 and RPS6 S236, with positive coregulation frequencies of 13 and 12, respectively, and the top negatively coregulated PsOPs with MAST2 S148 were FBL S124 and MLPH S337, with a negative coregulation frequency of 8 for both. The top 10 positive and negative expression coregulated PsOPs of both predominant phosphosites of MAST2 are represented in Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Bar graph illustrating the top 10 protein phosphosite coregulations with MAST2 predominant phosphosites. (A) (B) (C) (D) Fig. 3 Further, considering that the predominant phosphorylation sites S74 and S148 of MAST2 tend to be positively co-occurring, we hypothesized that the phosphosite coregulations associated with these phosphosites should be similar to some extent. Our analysis identified that 36 phosphosites in other proteins (PsOPs) showed similarly consistent positive coregulation with MAST2 predominant phosphosites. For instance, phosphorylation at S14 of the Iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme ISCU, which is associated with the stabilization of ISCU [ 35 3.4 Co-regulated phosphosites in currently known interacting partners of MAST2 To further interpret the association of coregulated phosphosites and MAST2 predominant sites, we assembled the list of proteins that are currently identified to interact with MAST2 from multiple repositories. Among the binary interactors of MAST2, we identified phosphorylation at S207 of Ras association domain-containing protein 1 (RASSF1) to be positively coregulated with S74 and phosphorylation at S369 of Ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-1 (RPS6KA1) to be negatively coregulated with MAST2 S74. Similarly, we identified phosphorylation at S582 and S610 of Kinesin Light Chain 2 (KLC2) and phosphorylation at S110 of Beta-2-syntrophin (SNTB2) to be positively coregulated with S148, and phosphorylation at S231 of Heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha (HSP90AA1) to be negatively coregulated with MAST2 S148 ( Fig. 4 Supplementary Table 3B 39 40 Fig. 4 Binary interactors of MAST2 and their phosphosite coregulations associated with MAST2 predominant phosphosites. Fig. 4 3.5 Analysis of novel upstream kinases associated with MAST2 Currently, experimentally validated protein kinases that phosphorylate predominant phosphosites of MAST2 are unknown in the literature. However, to identify potential kinases that could phosphorylate these phosphosites in MAST2, we predicted upstream kinases using in silico tools and integrated peptide screening-based kinase substrate data from Johnson et al. (2023) [ 27 27 Supplementary Table 3C 41 3.6 Analysis of novel MAST2 substrates MAST2 is one of the protein kinases for which no experimentally validated substrates have been reported yet. So in our efforts to identify potential substrates of MAST2, we utilised substrates predicted by in silico tools as well as Johnson et al. (2023) [ 27 Fig. 5 Supplementary Table 3D Fig. 5 Representation of potential upstream kinases and substrates of MAST2. Phosphosite coregulations and kinase substrate interactions are highlighted using distinct arrows. Fig. 5 Further, a range of phosphosite-specific functional associations were also noted with the coregulated phosphosites from the PhosphoSitePlus database [ 32 Fig. 6 Supplementary Table 3E Fig. 6 Circular dendrograms representing phosphosite coregulations with known phosphosite level functional significance. Positive and negative coregulations and the classes of biological processes associated are highlighted. Fig. 6 4 Discussion MAST2 is a heavily phosphorylated kinase that is understudied in terms of the upstream signals that activate it and the regulatory signals mediated by its protein kinase domain. Currently, MAST2 has been associated with cancers and neurodegeneration [ 1 42 Among the coregulations identified, VCL S290 and ANKS1A S647 were the top positive coregulated phosphosites with MAST2 S74. VCL (Vinculin) is an F-actin binding protein involved in cell matrix and cell–cell adhesion [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 Previously, MAST2 was reported to regulate the transcription of TFPI SERPINE1 TFPI SERPINE TFPI SERPINE1 11 36 37 38 Interestingly, ‘negative regulation of microtubule depolymerization’ was enriched in the protein-level enrichment analysis. Although MAST2 (Microtubule Associated Serine/Threonine Kinase 2) in its name denotes association with microtubules, the direct association of MAST2 with microtubule activity has not yet been reported [ 1 [51] [52] [53] Considering that MAST2 is one of the protein kinases for which no experimentally validated substrates are currently known, and that the kinases phosphorylating its phosphosites are also unidentified, our study provides meaningful insights into the poorly understood functions of MAST2. In addition to finding that S74 and S148 tend to co-occur and that RPSKA1 and MARK2 are kinases capable of phosphorylating these sites, respectively. The current study also identified 60 potential novel substrates phosphorylated by MAST2, with functional significance ranging from transcriptional regulation to cytoskeleton organization. Phosphoproteomics and the characterization of cellular phospho-signaling networks coordinated by kinases represent a rapidly expanding area of research [ 54 55 56 57 in-silico 58 5 Conclusions In conclusion, our study represents the first investigation into the intricate regulatory landscape of phospho-signals governing and governed by the serine/threonine kinase MAST2. Focusing on the predominant phosphosites S74 and S148 that were identified to be perturbed across several experimental conditions, we uncovered a multitude of phospho-signaling dynamics associated with MAST2. Our analysis revealed that phosphorylations at S74 and S148 of MAST2 tend to co-occur positively, and they are candidate regulatory sites influencing the transcriptional regulatory activity of MAST2. Furthermore, we identified high-confidence kinases capable of phosphorylating MAST2 phosphosites, as well as high-confidence substrates that MAST2 may phosphorylate. The phosphosite coregulation data generated through our in-silico pipeline provides a novel perspective for interpreting phosphorylation events and signaling patterns. By mapping the phosphosignaling landscape associated with MAST2, our study establishes a foundation for future experimental investigations into its functional significance.
