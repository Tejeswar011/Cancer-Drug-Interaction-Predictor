This mode of treatment can also compete with or supplement conventional radiotherapy, for example, if MRI does not fully capture the extent of the disease, including microscopic metastases. Targeted radionuclide therapy for patients with thyroid cancer, with certain somatostatin receptor 2-expressing tumors and with prostate-specific membrane antigen-expressing prostate cancer is approved, and numerous approaches of targeted radionuclide therapy for patients with metastatic cancer are in development (eg, using fibroblast activation protein as a target). Although brain metastases are rare in cancers with approved targeted radionuclide therapies, there is no a priori reason to assume that such treatments would not be effective against brain metastases if the targets are expressed and not shielded by the blood-brain barrier. Here, we discuss the current state of the art and opportunities of targeted radionuclide therapies for patients with brain and leptomeningeal metastases. brain leptomeningeal radioligand radiopharmaceutical target theranostics pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
