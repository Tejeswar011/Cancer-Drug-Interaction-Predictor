This variability is thought to stem in part from the diverse functional impacts of TP53 TP53 TP53 Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a cancer predisposition disorder caused by TP53 variants, but the way different TP53 variants contribute remains unclear. Here, the authors analyse TP53 mutagenesis datasets and identify five TP53 variant clusters that show associations with specific cancer patterns as well as potential clinical strategies.

Since we observed that carriers of monomeric variants had significantly increased osteosarcoma development compared to non-monomeric variant carriers, we expressed monomeric and non-monomeric variants in TP53 6a 4 TP53 6b 3 4 Fig. 6 Functional validation of TP53 a b TP53 c d e 35 n n n n n n th th P p 3 In many cases, amino acid substitutions at the same position were classified into different clusters. For example, R175C, R175G, R175H, R175L, R175P, and R175S, classified into clusters 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, and 2, respectively. We generated and expressed each R175 variant in H1299 cells to determine whether their differential clustering is substantiated by their oncogenic effects in cells. Based on the functional and clinical associations, we would expect R175C in cluster 4 to exhibit less pathogenicity compared to variants in clusters 2 or 3. Indeed, R175C behaved like wild-type TP53 to significantly repress colony formation (Fig. 6c 4 5e, f 5 6c 6c 30 5 5 6c Finally, we investigated whether biological differences exist between healthy non-cancerous cells obtained from variant carriers representing different clusters.

Previous models to predict variant pathogenicity treated it as a binary variable and limited the focus to pathogenic versus benign 37 38 TP53 1 4 39 Table 1 Summary of structural/functional features and clinical phenotypes associated with TP53 Variant Group Main Structural Features/Regions Functional Features Defining Cancer Phenotypes Cancer onset (median age in years with 95% CI) Cluster 1 Disordered regions Hypermorphic/WT-like function B/LB; Late onset; Atypical LFS cancer pattern 41 (32–45) Cluster 2 DBD, non-contact sites Hypomorphic Intermediate/attenuated phenotype 35 (32–39) Cluster 3 DBD, contact sites LOF/Dominant negative Classic LFS phenotype; Very early onset breast cancer 26.5 (25-28) Cluster 4 CTD WT-like function Attenuated phenotype; Young adult ACC onset 37 (30–47) Cluster 5 OD (monomeric) /TAD1/NTD hinge region LOF/Hypomorphic Osteosarcoma; Very early onset breast cancer a 31 (25–34) FS/NS/DEL Protein truncating LOF Classic LFS phenotype; Very early onset breast cancer 27 (26–28) a Cluster 1 and 4 variants performed best overall in functional mutagenesis screens by retaining the most TP53 activity (Fig. 2e–h 3a, b 4a–c 5b, c 3d, e 5a, b 4a–c 5d 5e 3a TP53 40 TP53 2e–h 6a–c 4d 5e, f In contrast to clusters 1 and 4, variant clusters that mapped to highly structured regions conferred the earliest onset. Cluster 3 variants are centered in the DBD, primarily at DNA-contact sites, are functionally deleterious, and have DN activity (Fig. 2d–h 3 3b, c 3 4a–c 5e 5d Interestingly, nearly all individuals in cluster 5 had variants located in the OD that disrupt oligomerization and result in monomeric TP53 species. Our functional and clinical evaluations of cluster 5 variants reveal that they are pathogenic, linked to early onset (Fig. 4 5e 5g 6a, b 3 Our examination of codon 175 variants underscores how subtle differences in TP53 amino acid substitutions can lead to remarkably diverse cellular outcomes (Fig. 6c 30 Although TP53 impairment is a well-known driver of cancer, many additional genetic and epigenetic factors contribute to an individual’s overall cancer risk. We questioned whether differences between TP53 variants could be observed in non-transformed cells, or if compensatory mechanisms might offset TP53 dysfunction. Previous research has revealed characteristic changes in skin fibroblasts from individuals with an elevated cancer risk, but this has not yet been established in TP53 variant carriers 31 34 6d 6e TP53 In conclusion, our study reveals a continuum of cancer risk associated with TP53 7 Fig. 7 Interpretation of TP53 This schematic representation illustrates TP53 Methods Functional datasets and unsupervised cluster analysis We selected saturation mutagenesis cellular functional screens as features for dimensionality reduction.

No commonly misidentified cell lines were used in this study. Transfections of pcDNA3.1 constructs were performed using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Skin biopsy samples were collected from patients at The Hospital for Sick Children, dissociated with collagenase for 1.5 h at 37 °C and centrifuged at 370 x g for 10 min. Cell pellets were homogenized with trypsin/EDTA and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were centrifuged and washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) before incubation with Alpha Minimum Essential Medium (AMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere. MTS colorimetric assay Dermal fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 2000 cells per well in 96-well tissue culture plates and cultured for 48 h. The protocol was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ab197010; Abcam). Briefly, two hours after the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) reagent was added to each well, absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a microplate reader (ELX800; BioTek). Western blotting Whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; 4–12% acrylamide gradient) and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Amersham). TP53 and β-actin were detected using a mouse anti-human TP53 monoclonal antibody (mAb; 1:1000 dilution; IC12, Cell Signalling) and rabbit anti-human β-actin (1:1000 dilution; 13E5, Cell Signalling). Oligomerization assay Supernatants from lysed total cell extracts (8ug) were incubated with 0.025% glutaraldehyde prepared in PBS. Crosslinking reactions were left to proceed for 30 min at 4 °C. Reactions were ended with the addition of 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5. Multimeric TP53 complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE before transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotting. Clonogenic assay Saos-2 and H1299 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 TP53 variants. After 6 hours, the cells were dissociated with trypsin, washed with PBS, and seeded at a density of 2000 cells in 6-well plates in DMEM with FBS. The media was replaced after 24 h with media containing 750 ug/mL G418 antibiotic and cells were incubated for 10 days (H1299 cells) or 14 days (Saos-2 cells). Media changes were done every 5 days. Cells were then fixed and stained in 80% methanol, 3.7% formaldehyde, and 0.025% crystal violet, and colonies were counted manually. 3D visualization of protein structures The crystal structure of a TP53 core tetramer was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB #3EXJ; https://www.rcsb.org/ Statistical analysis All statistical tests were performed using RStudio (version 2022.07.1 + 554; Posit, PBC) or GraphPad Prism (version 9). Linear relationships in matrix correlation plots were assessed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to determine differences between functional scores, Grantham’s distance, and ages at onset across all groups. Pairwise comparisons were then performed using Mann-Whitney U tests. Chi-squared tests were used to determine significance across groups for cancer type comparisons in variant carriers and differences of proline substitutions in clusters. Subsequently, pairwise comparisons were done using two-tailed Fisher’s exact test. All multiple hypothesis corrections for pairwise tests were done using the Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment to obtain the false discovery rate (FDR). Statistical analyses of dermal fibroblast and blood cell-based functional assays data was done using one-tailed unpaired t-tests.
