However, it is unclear whether specific subsets of conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) promote the differentiation of Tregs. We have identified a subset of lung resident type 2 cDCs (cDC2s) that display high levels of CD301b and have potent Treg-inducing activity ex vivo.

Thus, inhaled corticosteroids remain the primary treatment for asthmatics. Although these powerful anti-inflammatory drugs are effective in the short term, they affect multiple immune cell types and are therefore not appropriate for long term use. Immunotherapies in the form of SCIT and SLIT are effective; scRNA-seq of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients before and after SLIT treatment leads to clonal expansion of allergen-specific Tregs as well as trans-type Th2 cells that express high musculin TGF-β IL-2 48 One approach to mitigate the symptoms of asthma is to improve the efficiency of immunotherapy so that shorter regimens can be used. It is well established that Tregs suppress allergic responses and their differentiation is promoted in vitro by the cytokines TGF-β and IL-2 12 + + 18 + 49 A role for the IL-10 receptor on cDCs for tolerance induction was previously reported 44 + + + 41 Mgl2 + + Tgfb1 Cd200 + Furin 50 + Nrros Nrros + 51 + Our scRNA-seq data and cDC migration assays revealed that tolerance-inducing CD301b + 52 Ccr7 –/– plt/plt 53 54 Ccr7 –/– Ccr7 –/– GM-CSF drives proliferation of multipotent myeloid progenitors, resulting in the expansion of myeloid cells, including granulocytes, macrophages and cDCs 55 56 57 58 Csf2r 32 + Csf2rb ∆DC + Csf2 ∆ARE + + + + + Csf2rb ∆DC Flt3 59 The reduction of CD301b + Csf2rb ∆DC 60 61 + The present study reveals that lung resident cDC2s displaying CD301b are the predominant cDC2 subset at steady state, and that these cDCs preferentially induce Treg differentiation from naïve CD4 + + Methods Mice All animal procedures complied with institutional guidelines and were approved by the NIEHS Animal Care and Use Committee (Animal Study Protocols 05-22 and 05-23).

Alignment was performed with the mouse mm10-1.2.0 reference. The following feature libraries were included for antibody sequencing: CD200 (TCAATTCCGGTAGTC), CD301b (CTTGCCTTGCGATTT), CD11b (TGAAGGCTCATTTGT), and Ly6C (AAGTCGTGAGGCATG). Outputs from filtered count matrices were used for subsequent analyses. Rounded estimates from Cell Ranger were 3,500/5,000/6,500 cells, 195,000/120,000/90,000 mean reads per cells, and 3,000/3,100/3,500 median genes per cell for the 0 h, 6 h, and 18 h samples, respectively. 96% of RNA reads mapped to the reference genome, and 97% of all barcodes were valid. scRNA-Seq dimensionality reduction and clustering: Data from scRNA-Seq were processed using the Seurat v3.0 package in R version 3.6.1 ( http://satijalab.org/seurat/ 67 68 67 30 69 https://scvelo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ GSE261034 Csf2 35 Statistics Data are presented as mean ± SEM.
