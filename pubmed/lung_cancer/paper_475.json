How gene regulatory circuits are reshaped during ionizing radiation-induced tumorigenesis remains unclear, and little is known about the mediators that drive these processes. To decipher the chromatin alterations in radiation-induced lung cancer, we performed ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and Hi-C analyses of human bronchial epithelial cells and corresponding radiation-induced malignantly transformed cell lines. We found that this malignant transformation is accompanied by chromatin switching from the inactive B compartment to the active A compartment, an increased number of TADs and gained ATAC-seq peaks that mediate new distal chromatin contacts. We identified tumour protein 63 (TP63) as a mediator of new chromatin-accessible sites that anchor tumour-specific chromatin contacts in radiation-induced tumour cells. A TP63-mediated accessible chromatin site anchors a tumour-specific TAD boundary and multiple tumour-specific chromatin loops, which might underlie MYC Radiation-induced malignantly transformed cells undergo multi-scale 3D genome reorganization. TP63 acts as a key mediator, creating accessible chromatin sites that form tumour-specific loops activating the MYC oncogene during malignant transformation.

We developed a high-resolution map of 3D chromatin structures by using Hi-C in BEP2D cells, a human bronchial epithelial cell line, and their radiation-induced tumour cell counterparts to reveal alterations in chromatin structure at different scales, ranging from megabase-scale A/B compartments to the finest-scale chromatin loops anchored at specific genes. ATAC-seq was used to map genome-wide chromatin accessibility, revealing that chromatin contacts are enhanced and reinforced at tumour-specific open chromatin sites. By examining the predicted binding sites of 746 TFs, we identified tumour protein 63 (TP63) as a mediator that underlies the reinforcement of functional chromatin contacts in radiation-induced tumour cells. Via combined analysis of the putative TP63 binding sites with publicly available TP63 ChIP-seq datasets of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) 45 MYC MYC Results Ionizing radiation-induced tumour cells exhibit aberrant gene expression and pervasive accumulation of accessible chromatin sites To elucidate the interplay between chromatin accessibility and chromatin structure and their regulatory role in radiation-induced lung cancer, we established two malignantly transformed cell lines, BERP35T1 and BERP35T4, which were derived from BEP2D cells (a previously established human papillomavirus (HPV18)-immortalized human bronchial epithelial cell line 46 238 47 We subsequently performed RNA-seq and ATAC-seq to obtain atlases of the transcriptome and epigenome, respectively, of BEP2D, BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 cells. First, we identified alterations in gene transcriptional activity between normal and tumour cells with RNA-seq. Specifically, we identified 414 significantly upregulated and 204 significantly downregulated genes in BERP35T1 cells and 396 significantly upregulated and 284 significantly downregulated genes in BERP35T4 cells compared with BEP2D cells (Fig. 1A S1A, B Fig. 1 Ionizing radiation-induced tumour cells exhibit aberrant gene expression and pervasive accumulation of accessible chromatin sites. A B C To investigate the biological functions of the differentially expressed genes in ionizing radiation-induced malignantly transformed cell lines, we performed Gene Ontology (GO) pathway analysis of the upregulated genes in BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 cells (Fig. 1B 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 To identify the regulatory basis of aberrant gene expression in tumour cells, we analysed the chromatin accessibility profiles of these 3 cell types with ATAC-seq. We identified 14220 and 5360 gained ATAC-seq peaks in BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 cells, respectively, compared with BEP2D cells. However, we identified only 832 and 1043 ATAC-seq peaks in BEP2D cells that were lost in BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 cells, respectively (Fig. 1C 1C A/B compartment switching and alterations in intra-TAD structures are associated with dysregulated gene expression in ionizing radiation-induced tumour cells Accessible chromatin sites in nonpromoter regions delineate distal regulatory elements such as enhancers, and their interplay with the 3D chromatin architecture is the primary factor underlying their regulatory function 38 56 58 2A 2A 2B 59 P −22 P −18 P −4 P 2C Fig. 2 A/B compartments switching and alterations in intra-TAD structures are associated with dysregulated gene expression in the ionizing radiation-induced tumour cells. A A A B B A B B B A C A B B A P th th th th D P E A B B A F A/B To explore the biological significance of genes involved in the B-to-A switching, we performed GO pathway analysis based on these genes (Fig. S2A 60 55 Although the positions of TADs are generally conserved in different cell types 61 62 64 S2B 16 65 S2C 1 63 2 2D 2D 2E 2F, S2D Together, these results indicate that the chromatin architecture is altered at both the compartment level and the TAD level and that the changes at both scales are associated with alterations in gene expression in radiation-induced tumour cells. Dynamic changes in chromatin contact anchor gene expression in SDOC-increased TADs The significant association between alterations in SDOC and gene expression inspired us to further investigate the characteristics and potential regulatory impact of chromatin alterations in TADs with altered SDOC levels during radiation-induced malignant transformation. We first assessed the level of alterations in contact frequencies within the 3 groups of TADs classified according to the types of SDOC alterations during tumorigenesis. We found that alterations in contact frequency are significantly greater in TADs with increased levels of SDOC than in TADs with stable or decreased levels of SDOC. This observation is consistent when comparing both BERP35T1 cells with BEP2D cells and BERP35T4 cells with BEP2D cells (Fig. 3A Fig. 3 Dynamic changes in different SDOC during the process of radiation-induced tumor formation. A P P P P B th th P P C P P P We then sought to further investigate whether increased chromatin contact frequencies might contribute to aberrant gene activation in the BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 malignantly transformed cell lines. To this end, we assigned each gene to a locus pair if the transcription start site (TSS) of the gene overlapped with either anchor of the locus pair and defined them as “anchor genes”. All anchor genes were then categorized into nine groups on the basis of the SDOC alteration of their corresponding TADs and alterations in the contact frequency of the locus pair. Finally, alterations in the expression of anchor genes were compared between groups. Overall, genes located at an anchor of enhanced distal contact, which was defined as a locus pair with a differential contact frequency > 1, were generally upregulated regardless of whether the SDOC value of the corresponding TAD was altered, and genes located at an anchor of weakened distal contact, which was defined as a locus pair with a differential contact frequency < -1, were generally downregulated regardless of whether the SDOC level of the corresponding TAD was altered (Fig. 3B Then we checked whether the SDOC increase events are consistent between the BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 cell lines (Fig. S3A S3B 66 On the basis of the above results, we speculated that during radiation-induced malignant transformation of BEP2D cells, alterations in TADs as well as intra-TAD chromatin contacts may contribute to the abnormal expression of oncogenes. Therefore, we next investigated the contribution of SDOC alterations to oncogene expression. Briefly, we compiled the oncogene list 67 71 3C Together, our results suggest that the dynamic changes in SDOC values during radiation-induced tumorigenesis may be closely related to the dysregulation of gene expression, which may be accompanied by specific binding of transcription factors. TP63 is a mediator of tumour-specific chromatin contact As a variety of TFs have been shown to contribute to the establishment of cell-type-specific chromatin contacts that regulate the expression of cell identity genes 34 72 73 74 75 4A Fig. 4 TP63 is a mediator of tumour-specific chromatin contact. A B C P P D P P P On the basis of the observation of increased ATAC-seq peaks in both BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 malignant cells compared with BEP2D cells, we further hypothesized that certain TFs may be involved in mediating tumour-specific chromatin contacts via the generation of novel chromatin sites. We then identified potential TFs responsible for the generation of novel accessible chromatin sites in radiation-induced tumour cells by comparing the chromatin accessibility levels in normal BEP2D cells and tumour cells at all putative binding sites for each TF and measured the level of increase in chromatin accessibility by calculating the fold change in the mean ATAC-seq read density between normal cells and tumour cells. We also took the expression level of each TF into consideration to rule out potential false-positive results. Overall, multiple TFs presented high increases in chromatin accessibility ( > 3-fold) in BERP35T1 and relatively weak but consistent increases in BERP35T4. Among the analysed TFs, TP63 presented the greatest increase in chromatin accessibility in both BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 radiation-induced tumour cells compared with BEP2D cells, and it was also the only TF that presented a more than 3-fold increase in chromatin accessibility in both tumour cell lines (Fig. 4A 4B 4C S4A Histopathological analysis has indicated that BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 radiation-induced tumour cells originate from squamous cell carcinoma 47 45 4D 4B 23 S4B Together, these results show that tumour-specific opening of chromatin regions mediated by TP63 might underlie the formation and reinforcement of distal chromatin contacts in BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 tumour cells. TP63 anchors multiple tumour-specific chromatin loops that instruct MYC To gain further insight into the functional role of the reinforced chromatin contact anchored by gained ATAC-seq peaks in radiation-induced tumour cells, we performed a genome-wide search for differentially expressed genes anchored by increased distal chromatin contact in both the BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 tumour cell lines. We identified 48 genes, of which 46 were upregulated in both tumour cell lines, which is consistent with our findings that locus pairs with an increased contact frequency in tumour cells are associated with increased transcriptional activities of anchor genes. The 46 upregulated anchor genes, including the known oncogene MYC 3 5A 5B, C MYC 5C MYC Fig. 5 TP63 anchors multiple tumour-specific chromatin loops that instruct MYC oncogene activation in radiation-induced tumour cells. A B C Validation of TP63-mediated chromatin contacts and transcriptional regulatory roles To validate the role of TP63 in mediating novel chromatin contacts, we constructed a TP63-overexpressing BEP2D cell line to investigate the functional impact of TP63 (Methods). For comprehensive investigation of the impact of the chromatin architecture, epigenome and transcriptome of TP63, we performed Micro-C on WT BEP2D (BEP2DNC) cells, TP63-overexpressing BEP2D (BEP2DOE) cells and BERP35T1 cells and probed the transcriptome, chromatin accessibility, TP63 and cohesin binding and chromatin structure by profiling these cell lines using RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and CUT&Tag targeting TP63, STAG2 and CTCF. The RNA-seq data revealed significantly greater expression of the MYC gene in BEP2DOE cells than in BEP2DNC cells ( p −43 6A 6B, S5A Fig. 6 Effects of TP63 overexpression on gene expression, chromatin accessibility and chromatin structure. A B C D E F P We also found that the profile of gene expression alterations in TP63-overexpressing BEP2D cells compared with BEP2DNC cells significantly correlated with those observed in BERP35T1 cells compared with BEP2DNC cells ( p −300 S5B 6C S5C S5D To validate the role of TP63 in mediating chromatin reorganization and chromatin contact in the malignant transformation of BEP2D cells, we performed integrative analysis of our CUT&Tag and ATAC-seq data and assessed the potential impact of TP63 binding on the level of chromatin accessibility as well as the binding of CTCF and cohesin at the corresponding TP63 binding sites. We first noted that the number of TP63 CUT&Tag peaks (hereafter referred to as TP63 peaks) with increased chromatin accessibility was greater than that with decreased chromatin accessibility, suggesting an overall increase in the chromatin accessibility level at TP63 peaks, but the level of chromatin accessibility alteration varied at different TP63 peaks. To enable a detailed and context-dependent assessment of the regulatory impact of TP63 chromatin binding events, we further classified TP63 peaks into four categories according to alterations in chromatin accessibility with/without TP63 binding by comparing TP63-overexpressing BEP2D cells with WT BEP2D cells. Specifically, we classified the TP63 peaks into 4 groups: strongly increased (fold change≥4), slightly increased (2≤fold change<4), not significantly changed (0.5<fold change<2) and decreased (fold change≤0.5). We observed that the “strongly increased” group corresponded to the strongest TP63 peaks (fold change = 39.23), indicating that stronger and more robust TP63 binding results in a greater increase in chromatin accessibility. These results further support TP63 as a pioneer factor mediating novel accessible chromatin sites during the malignant transformation of BEP2D cells. We next explored how the four types of TP63 peaks affect CTCF and cohesin binding (Fig. 6D, S5E 76 On the basis of the above observations, we further explored the potential of TP63 binding to mediate chromatin contacts. We first studied the expression alterations of genes located in loop anchors (Fig. S5F 6D, S5E 6E, S5G Next, we explored whether increased interaction intensities led to the activation of gene expression. We compared the gene expression fold changes at class 1 TP63 peaks and class 2 TP63 peaks (Fig. 6F, S5H Compared with those in BEP2DNC cells, we observed novel chromatin contacts at similar genomic sites in BEP2DOE cells and BERP35T1 cells upstream of MYC gene (Fig. S6 S7 S6 S6 5 Together, these results validated the role of TP63 in mediating the opening of chromatin at binding sites, establishing novel CTCF binding sites, thereby potentially mediating chromatin contacts via elevated levels of cohesin blockade, favouring chromatin loop extrusion and resulting in activated gene expression. These epigenome and 3D genome alterations mediated by overexpressed TP63 contributed to the aberrant transcriptome and the activation of pathways related to the malignant transformation of BEP2D cells. Discussion Although alterations in the multilevel chromatin architecture have been characterized as hallmarks of tumorigenesis 6 7 First, we showed that the chromatin accessibility landscape undergoes pervasive alterations before and after tumorigenesis. The landscape of chromatin accessibility broadly reflects the regulatory capacity and is a critical determinant of chromatin organization and function 77 78 Second, we also showed that the remodelling of chromatin accessibility is closely related to finer-scale alterations in the 3D chromatin structure. Chromatin accessibility is determined by the linear structure of chromatin at the nucleosomal length scale, and higher-order nucleosome organization might also impact access to DNA 77 Third, we identified TP63 as a mediator of functional chromatin contact in BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 tumour cells. We propose that TP63 functions as a pioneer factor that creates accessible chromatin sites that recruit other TFs, including known insulators such as CTCF and YY1 30 MYC MYC 16 38 79 MYC MYC 80 44 MYC MYC MYC MYC Radiation has been reported to have a limited effect on 3D chromatin organization, with the main effect being the strengthening of TAD boundaries in repair-proficient cells 81 Our work revealed that the role of TP63 in mediating chromatin contacts is functionally related to the regulation of oncogene expression. As TP63 is specifically activated in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), our findings may provide new insight into the potential regulatory mechanisms underlying the development of LUSC. Furthermore, the comprehensive multi-omic dataset provided in our study could be a valuable resource for studying the regulation and function of 3D chromatin structure in the process of malignant transformation. In summary, this study, by integrating genome-wide high-resolution Hi-C data, chromatin accessibility profiling data and gene expression data, identified TP63 as a pioneer factor that facilitates remodelling of the 3D genomic architecture and might activate MYC Methods Cell culture The cell lines used in this study were described in detail in a previous paper 47 55 238 47 2. Lentivirus transfection NP63-overexpressing lentivirus (HBLV-h-TP63-3xflag-ZsGreen-PURO) and the corresponding control lentivirus (HBLV-ZsGreen-PURO) were purchased from Hanbio Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai). For lentivirus transfection, 2 × 10 5 Western blot Western blot analysis was performed via a standard technique. An anti-GAPDH antibody (#5174S, 1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology) was used as a control for whole-cell lysates. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-NP63 (#67825S, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-c-Myc (#18583S, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-SLUG (#9585S, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-CCND2 (#10934-1-AP, 1:1000, Proteintech), anti-TMEM40 (#sc-393601, 1:1000, Santa Cruz), anti-ARL4C (#10934-1-AP, 1:1000, Proteintech), 10202-1-AP Anti-rabbit IgG, and HRP-linked antibodies (#7074, 1:5000, Cell Signaling Technology). RNA-seq Total RNA was extracted from 1×10 6 4 ATAC-seq ATAC-seq was performed as previously described 82 2 TM TM Cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) assay CUT&Tag was performed according to the instructions of the Hyperactive® Universal CUT&Tag Assay Kit for Illumina (TD903, Vazyme). Briefly, 100,000 sorted cells were mixed with Concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads and permeabilized with digitonin. The cell-bead complexes were incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated at room temperature for one hour with pAG-Tn5. The nuclei were collected and subjected to a transposition reaction at 37 °C for 1 h with a Bio-Rad T100 Thermal Cycler. Then, the transposed fragments were extracted, purified and amplified by using the reagents provided by the kit. Libraries were analysed for size distribution with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system. Finally, the libraries were pooled together and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, and 2×150 bp paired-end reads were generated. The antibodies used in this study for CUT&Tag were specific for NP63 (#67825S, 1:50, Cell Signaling Technology), STAG2 (#5882S, 1:50, Cell Signaling Technology), CTCF (#3418S, 1:50, Cell Signaling Technology), Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (#Ab207, 1:100, Vazyme). Hi-C Approximately 2× 10 7 19 Micro-C-XL Micro-C-XL libraries were constructed according to previously established methods 83 84 RNA-seq data processing Sequence alignment to the hg19 reference genome was performed using HISAT2 v2.2.1. Reads with MAPQ < 30 were filtered out. Gene expression levels were determined using featureCounts v2.0.1. To assess the statistical significance of differential expression for each gene, the P p 2 p 2 p 2 ATAC-seq data processing Sequence alignment to the hg19 reference genome was performed using Bowtie2 85 86 We compared the ATAC-seq peak calling results for normal BEP2D cells with those for BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 tumour cells. First, the peak calling results (narrowPeak files) of all replicates were merged using the “merge” command in BEDtools software (v2.29.1). To rigorously identify gained or lost ATAC-seq peaks in tumour cells, we first excluded peaks that were identified in both the normal and tumour cell lines. We subsequently calculated the reads per kilobase of transcript per million reads mapped (RPKM) value of each ATAC-seq peak in tumour cells and calculated the RPKM value of the corresponding region in normal BEP2D cells. We then calculated the read intensity ratio between the tumour cells and normal cells using the following equation: 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${R}_{i}=\\frac{({{RPKM}}_{{ti}}+{Pseudovalue})}{({{RPKM}}_{{ni}}+{Pseudovalue})}$$\\end{document} R i = ( R P K M t i + P s e u d o v a l u e ) ( R P K M n i + P s e u d o v a l u e ) Ti Ni ni i i i i Hi-C data processing Sequence alignment to the hg19 reference genome was performed using Bowtie2.

To this end, we used TAD datasets generated by HOMER software and compared the two boundaries of each TAD in BEP2D cells to those of the overlapping TADs in both BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 cells. A TAD was identified as conserved among all 3 datasets if neither of the TAD boundaries in the BEP2D cell dataset were shifted by more than 1 bin in either tumour cell dataset. Then, we calculated the SDOC in the conserved TADs using the “get_SDOC.py” python script in the SDOC GitHub repository ( https://github.com/birmjiangs/SDOC 94 Calculation of the differential chromatin contact frequency First, z score normalization was performed on all Hi-C contact matrices in each dataset.

Then, for each group of locus pairs, the differential contact map between the BEP2D cell dataset and a tumour cell dataset was generated by subtracting the average z score-normalized contact map of the normal BEP2D cell dataset from that of each tumour cell dataset. Comparison of chromatin accessibility levels of TFBSs between normal and tumour cells Putative TFBSs were predicted using the MEME suite (v5.1.0). TF binding motif datasets were downloaded from the JASPAR database ( http://jaspar.genereg.net/ The chromatin accessibility level of each TFBS was assigned as the RPKM-normalized read intensity of the ATAC-seq peak containing the TFBS. The chromatin accessibility level of each TF was calculated as the mean of all the chromatin accessibility levels of all the TFBSs in the dataset. Statistical analysis and reproducibility The RNA-seq experiments for the BEP2D, BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 cell lines were repeated three times. The Hi-C experiments for the BEP2D, BERP35T1 and BERP35T4 cell lines were repeated three times.
