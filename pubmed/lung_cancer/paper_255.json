Although genetic factors are implicated in ARM pathogenesis, our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms remains limited for both non-syndromic and syndromic ARM. Despite recent advancements, the genes identified so far account for only about 30% of the diagnostic yield from exome sequencing. Our study aimed to identify potential novel disease-causing mutations associated with ARMs. We performed exome sequencing on 12 patients with ARM and discovered a pathogenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the MFHAS1 gene in two individuals with non-syndromic ARM. Additionally, we identified insertion/deletion (INDEL) and splice-site variants in five genes - SOX9, AOC4P, SKA3, KRTAP5-7, and PRSS2. Despite the insights provided by our study regarding the association of these variants with ARM occurrence, further functional and segregation studies in larger cohorts are necessary to validate these findings.

These malformations occur in approximately 1 in 3000 live births 1 2 3 4 5 The elevated risk of recurrence associated with ARMs underscores the probable contribution of genetic factors to their pathogenesis. Previous research has demonstrated that offspring of affected parents face a significantly increased estimated recurrence risk, up to 1,500-fold, while siblings of affected individuals exhibit a 32-fold increase in risk 6 SALL1 SALL4 MID1 GLI3 MNX1 CHD 4 ADNP BBS1 CREBBP EP300 FANCC KDM6A SETD2 SMARCA4 7 4 8 Materials and methods Sample collection and clinical data acquisition In this study, we enrolled 12 individuals diagnosed with ARM and their parents (if available). These patients had previously undergone surgery at Songklanagarind Hospital, Prince of Songkla University. Participants were categorized into two groups: syndromic and non-syndromic ARMs. Individuals with a known syndrome or presenting with two or more congenital anomalies were classified as having syndromic ARMs, while the remaining patients were classified as non-syndromic 9 The clinical information for all patients was retrieved from the electronic medical records of the hospital. The research protocol received ethical approval from the Human Research Ethics Unit of the Faculty of Medicine at Prince of Songkla University (REC 66-212-38-2) (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Overview of the workflow. Whole exome sequencing and data processing Whole exome sequencing was performed using the Agilent SureSelect XT Human All Exon v8 library preparation system (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). Library quantification was carried out with the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and size measurements were obtained using the Agilent D1000 ScreenTape assay. Sequencing was conducted on an Illumina NovaSeq-6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, California, United States) with paired-end reads of 150 base pairs, achieving an average targeted coverage depth of 200x. Subsequently, the paired-end sequence files were first assessed for quality using FastQC (v0.11.9) and then trimmed with Trimmomatic (v0.39) 10 11 12 13 CNV identification and prioritization We utilized the GATK-gCNV tool to detect rare copy number variations (CNVs) in our patient cohort 14 We filtered the CNVs according to GATK-gCNV recommendations, applying three criteria (1) The QS score had to meet or exceed the threshold for each variant type (> 400 for homozygous deletions, > 100 for heterozygous deletions, and > 50 for duplications), (2) The site frequency of the sample had to be less than 1% within the call set, and (3) The CNV had to be of good quality (> 200 raw CNV calls or > 35 CNVs with QS > 20). We then prioritized these CNVs using the 2019 ACMG/ClinGen Technical Standards for CNVs 15 16 Short variant calling and filtering We identified short variants (SNPs and INDELs) in our patients using GATK HaplotypeCaller. To determine true possible variants, we employed a Gaussian mixture model with 99% truth sensitivity. Before filtering variants, we conducted an initial assessment to ensure our participants were not affected by known genes associated with anorectal malformations (ARM). We obtained the list of these known ARM-associated genes from The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) database, focusing on two phenotypes: anorectal anomaly (HP:0012732; https://hpo.jax.org/browse/term/HP:0012732 https://hpo.jax.org/browse/term/HP:0002023 ADNP BBS1 CREBBP EP300 FANCC KDM6A SETD2 SMARCA4 7 We filtered the identified genetic variants to pinpoint de novo variants in affected individuals. This filtering process was conducted using bcftool (v1.17) 17 18 19 Variant classification The filtered variants were initially categorized into two groups: SNPs and INDELs. We assessed the clinical significance of all variants using data from ClinVar. Subsequently, we used AlphaMissense, an AI-based method, to predict the pathogenicity of the SNP variants, specifically focusing on missense variants 20 Statistical analysis We conducted statistical analyses of the clinicopathological features using the R environment. Ordinal variables were compared with Mann–Whitney U tests, while categorical variables were analyzed using Fisher’s exact tests. All statistical tests were two-sided, unless otherwise specified, and a significance threshold of p Results Clinical characteristics of the patients In this study, we analyzed germline variants in 12 patients with ARM. The clinical features of all patients are summarized in Fig. 2 S1 Within this subgroup, Individual P6 presented with ARM, dextrocardia, and malrotation of the right kidney, all as part of the VACTERL association. Additionally, pulmonary hypoplasia was observed in the right middle and lower lung, a rare co-occurrence previously reported in VACTERL association cases 21 22 Furthermore, Individual P10 presented with ARM, Hirschsprung’s disease, and vaginal stenosis, a combination not specifically related to any known syndrome. As part of our investigation, we obtained the family history of all individuals within our study cohort. The resulting data revealed that 9 out of 10 patients had no documented family history of ARM or VACTERL association among their relatives. However, individual P1 stood out, as two of their family members were affected by ARM: specifically, their sister and cousin.  Fig. 2 Clinicopathological information of patients Identification of variants in ARM-associated gene Our study aimed to identify potential novel disease-causing mutations associated with ARMs. Initially, we identified structural and small variants in known ARM-associated genes among our affected individuals to confirm that they all represent ARM cases with an unidentified predisposing gene. Upon examining variants within the list of previously known ARM-associated genes, we found no variants classified as of uncertain significance, pathogenic, or likely pathogenic. However, our CNV analysis identified candidate CNVs as duplications on chromosome 21 in two individuals, P2 and P3, within the genomic region chr21:14108709–46,664,624, exhibiting a consistent quality score (QS) of 3076.53. Notably, this duplication aligns with the Down Syndrome phenotype observed in both patients. This variant was classified as likely pathogenic according to ACMG classification. Consequently, we excluded these two individuals from our downstream analysis. Identification of potential novel disease-causing mutations After excluding individuals with ARM who carried known predisposing genetic variants, we focused our analysis on the remaining 10 cases to identify potential novel disease-causing mutations. Among these, three individuals underwent proband-only exome sequencing, five underwent duo exome sequencing (including both the proband and the mother), and two underwent trio exome sequencing. Following variant filtering, we identified 2,718 genes from the proband-only and duo exome sequencing datasets, and 12 genes from the trio dataset (Fig. 3 MUC3A SOX9 MFHAS1 KRTAPP5-7 PRSS2 MUC3A MFHAS1 MUC3A MFHAS1 SOX9 MFHAS1 KRTAPP5-7 PRSS2 3 S2 MFHAS1 MFHAS1 23 For the remaining 4 genes, we observed distinct patterns of variants. Specifically, SOX9 KRTAP5-7 PRSS2 SOX9 24 KRTAP5-7 25 PRSS2 26  Fig. 3 Germline variant identified in individual with ARM (a) Venn diagram illustrating the number of genes harboring variants in two groups classified by analysis method: proband-only/duo and trio whole exome sequencing (WES).

Discussion Previous studies on germline variants associated with ARM have elucidated the genetic underpinnings of this disorder. However, despite these advancements, the genes identified so far account for only approximately 30% of diagnostic yield from exome sequencing, leaving the majority of ARM cases without a discernible causative variant. In our study, we conducted exome sequencing analysis on a cohort of 10 ARM individuals with previously unidentified ARM-associated genes. Notably, we identified a SNP variant in the MFHAS1 MFHAS1 SOX9 KRTAP5-7 PRSS2 Interestingly, while mutations in the aforementioned genes were observed in 9 out of 10 individuals, individual P1, who exhibited non-syndromic features, did not manifest any identifiable causative gene. This phenomenon could potentially be attributed to epigenetic factors, which have previously been associated with VACTERL association 27 8 28 MFHAS1 Conclusions In summary, we conducted exome sequencing to evaluate germline variants in 10 ARM cases with previously unidentified ARM-associated genes. Our findings reveal an association between the SNP variant in MFHAS1 and INDEL variants in five other genes with the occurrence of ARM. These results suggest that these genes may be potential causative factors for ARM. Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
