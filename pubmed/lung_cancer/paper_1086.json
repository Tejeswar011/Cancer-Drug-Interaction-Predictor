Emerging evidence highlights N⁶-methyladenosine (m⁶A) modification, orchestrated by methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3), as a pivotal epigenetic driver of GC pathogenesis. While METTL3 is implicated in promoting tumorigenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance, a systematic synthesis of its multi-layered regulatory networks and clinical relevance remains elusive. This review comprehensively deciphers METTL3’s dual roles as an oncogene and RNA modifier, elucidating its mechanisms in reprogramming GC progression through m⁶A-dependent RNA stability, translation, and non-coding RNA interactions. We reveal novel axes such as HOXA10-TGFβ /Smad-METTL3, METTL3/IGF2BP3-HDGF-glycolysis, and METTL3-YTHDF1- PARP1-driven chemoresistance, underscoring its cross-talk with oncogenic signaling and metabolic reprogramming. Crucially, we pioneer a clinical perspective by evaluating METTL3’s diagnostic potential as a biomarker and its therapeutic vulnerability in immunotherapy and NSAID Graphical Abstract  Relationship between METTL3 and GC By analyzing all available publications reporting the role of METTL3 in GC, this review aims to interpret their relationships. The analysis findings in this review suggest that METTL3 is a risk gene in the GC lifecycle (tumorigenesis, EMT progression, metastasis, and drug resistance), as well as targeting METTL3 is effective for GC treatment. The underlying mechanisms for METTL3 functions include regulating apoptosis, aerobic glycolysis, angiogenesis, and the immune microenvironment of GC cells. In conclusion, this review highlights the clinical potential of METTL3 as a biomarker for diagnosis and a target for treatment in GC. Methyltransferase-3 (METTL3).

Mechanistically, METTL3 mediates m⁶A methylation across RNA species (mRNAs, ncRNAs, circRNAs), reprogramming oncogenic networks, metabolic flux, and TME dynamics (Zeng et al. 2020 HOXA10 2021 HDGF 2020 6 2025 (Graphical Abstract) Current research gaps include: (i) insufficient understanding of METTL3’s context-specific interactions with ncRNAs and metabolic regulators; (ii) limited exploration of METTL3’s immunomodulatory effects and synergy with immune checkpoint inhibitors; and (iii) unresolved challenges in translating METTL3-targeted strategies into clinical practice. This review bridges these gaps by synthesizing recent discoveries into a unified model of METTL3-driven GC progression, emphasizing its diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic relevance. By elucidating METTL3’s cross-talk with oncogenic signaling cascades and the TME, we aim to catalyze the development of m⁶A-based precision therapies for GC (Graphical Abstract) METTL3-mediated m 6 GC is often late when you finally perceive its existence, and people are caught off guard (Norwood et al. 2022 2022 Helicobacter pylori 2022 Helicobacter pylori 6 2023a b c d Helicobacter pylori 6 6 H. pylori METTL3 orchestrates multilayered oncogenic networks in GC pathogenesis METTL3-mediated m 6 6 2023 METTL3 as a bifunctional oncogenic hub Progression driver A comprehensive dataset analysis conducted by Liu et al.

Targets, mechanisms, and functions of METTL3 in GC are comprehensively summarized and analyzed. METTL3 functions as an oncogene or regulates target genes involved in the process of apoptosis, aerobic glycolysis, angiogenesis, and immune microenvironment of GC, contributing to tumorigenesis, EMT progression, metastasis, and malignant phenotypes. Methyltransferase-3 (METTL3). N 6 6 6 The escalation of METTL3 expression exhibits a positive correlation with the progression of tumor stage and grade, along with poor survival outcomes (Liu et al. 2020 6 2020 2020 1 1 Subsequent studies have further clarified METTL3's promotive role in regulating GC cell proliferation and migration, which operates via m6A modification of tumor-related genes—including YAP1 2021 SOCS2 2020 BATF2 2020 2020 2020 2020a b 6 2021 2021 2021 1 1 During tumor progression, the DNA damage repair mechanism can be reprogrammed by influencing the genomic integrity (Kiwerska and Szyfter 2019 2023 DUSP6 Cisplatin 2023 6 SUV39H2 SUV39H2 SUV39H2 2023 Cisplatin 1 , 1 Metastatic switch The elevated METTL3 expression shows a close correlation with an unfavorable prognosis in patients with GC (Okugawa et al. 2023 2023 2019 2019 ZMYM1 6 2020 METTL3 HDGF 6 HDGF 6 HDGF HDGF 2020 2020 2023 UCA1 6 Snail Snail 1 1 PBX1 functions as a positive transcriptional regulator of GCH1, enhancing its expression.

Therefore, targeting METTL3 might be therapeutic for GC. Metabolic reprogramming A strong correlation has been established between the diminished expression of protein phosphatase 2 catalytic subunit alpha (PP2Acα) and the manifestation of GC. Cheng et al.

Li et al. ( 2023a b c d 6 ( 1 ) lncRNA-driven metastatic programs Comprising a length exceeding 200 nucleotides and devoid of protein-coding capacity, lncRNAs constitute a multifaceted class with intricate functional dimensions (Mercer et al. 2009 2009 SNHG7/miR-186-5p/CCND2: N-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)- induced malignant transformation The underlying mechanism of lncRNAs in GC relates to METTL3. For example, MNNG exposure is closely associated with GC development, which alters cellular localization and might be the critical cellular note for malignant transformation (Gunes-Bayir et al. 2022 2023 6 SNHG7 2023 SNHG7 2020 PTEN PTEN 1 LncRNAs also function by interacting with miRNAs in GC development. For instance, lncRNA-BLACAT2 is upregulated abnormally in GC, which promotes GC proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis (Hu et al. 2021 METTL3 METTL3 METTL3 METTL3 2023 6 2023 1 RPRD1B/c-Jun/NEAT1: Lipid metabolism-fueled lymph node metastasis Lymph node metastasis is a key determinant of GC staging and prognosis (Peng and Su 2023 2022 2022 6 RPRD1B 2022 1 THAP7-AS1/Cullin4B (CUL4B): PI3K/AKT hyperactivation via epigenetic silencing Additionally, high expression of lncRNA THAP7-AS1 drives GC progression and associates with positive lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis (Liu et al. 2022a b 6 6 2022a b Consistently, lncRNA LINC02253 acts as an oncogene, with its high levels strongly linked to tumor size, lymph node metastasis, advanced nodal/metastasis stages, and poorer 5-year overall survival in GC patients.

However, chemoresistance and inevitable severe toxicity contribute to treatment failure and poor prognosis.

Methyltransferase-3 (METTL3). N 6 6 6 While METTL3 inhibition shows promise, limitations include: (i) off-target effects of small molecules (e.g., STM2457) on normal epithelia; (ii) tissue-specific roles—METTL3 is essential for hematopoietic stem cells, risking hematotoxicity; and (iii) compensatory upregulation of METTL14 or FTO in resistant clones.

(3) Diagnostic innovation: Engineer CRISPR-based m 6 Conclusion We establish METTL3 as an epitranscriptomic master regulator in GC, connecting molecular mechanisms to translational applications. By contrasting our findings with prior studies and emphasizing actionable therapeutic synergies, we provide a roadmap for overcoming GC’s therapeutic plateau. Future efforts should prioritize biomarker standardization and subtype-stratified trials to unlock the full potential of METTL3-targeted strategies in precision oncology.
