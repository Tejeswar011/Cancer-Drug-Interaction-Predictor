This condition is often linked to a wide range of underlying causes that can vary among patients. The most common and well-established causes of AKI include ischemia, which is characterized by inadequate blood flow to the kidneys; hypoxia, which refers to low oxygen levels in the kidney tissues; and nephrotoxicity, which involves damage to the kidneys due to toxic substances or drugs [ 1 2 MCHC, a common indicator of anemia, has been shown to correlate with the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 Despite the critical importance of understanding the factors influencing mortality risk in patients with AKI in the ICU, there is a notable scarcity of research specifically exploring the relationship between MCHC and mortality risk in this patient population. While several studies have examined various biomarkers and clinical indicators of mortality in patients with AKI, the potential role of MCHC as a predictor remains underexplored. To fill this gap in the existing literature, the present study was designed to thoroughly investigate the association between MCHC levels and mortality risk in ICU patients with AKI. This was achieved through a robust and comprehensive multicenter approach, allowing for a more generalizable and reliable assessment across diverse ICU settings and patient populations. By utilizing data from multiple centers, this study aimed to provide valuable insights that could inform clinical practice and potentially improve patient outcomes in this high-risk group of patients. Materials Data source This multicenter retrospective cohort study utilized data from two well-established and comprehensive databases, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) and eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU–CRD), which are widely used in clinical research to investigate various aspects of critical care [ 9 10 These databases provide a wealth of information that can be leveraged for a wide array of analyses, particularly those focusing on ICU patients and conditions, such as AKI. In adherence to the strict usage protocols and ethical guidelines established for these databases, one of the authors (Sheng Chen) successfully completed a Human subject research training course with record ID 66963781 and obtained credentialed user status on PhysioNet, the platform hosting the databases. This credentialing process ensured that all data used complied with the necessary ethical standards and that the researcher was well-versed in handling sensitive clinical data. After completing these necessary steps and signing the Data Use Agreement, our research team was granted formal access to the MIMIC-IV and eICU–CRD databases. This provided us with the opportunity to extract relevant data for this study while adhering to the necessary protocols governing the use of such information in research. The MIMIC-IV and eICU–CRD databases contain detailed patient information, including the length of hospital stay, results from various laboratory tests, data on medication administration, and measurements of vital signs. This wealth of clinical data is critical for understanding the nuances of patient care and outcomes in the intensive care setting. To safeguard patient privacy and ensure the ethical integrity of the study, all personal information was thoroughly de-identified before access. Personal identifiers were replaced with random codes to ensure confidentiality and anonymity of patient identities throughout the research process. Consequently, because no personally identifiable information was used in the study, patient consent was not required, and the study did not necessitate formal ethical approval in line with the de-identification procedures set forth for these databases. This approach allowed the study to maintain high standards of privacy and compliance while using valuable data for research purposes. Participants Patients diagnosed with AKI and admitted to the ICU were included in the analysis. The inclusion of these patients allowed for a focused investigation of the relationship between MCHC levels and mortality in ICU patients with AKI, specifically targeting this high-risk group. However, several exclusion criteria were applied to ensure that the study population was homogeneous and that the results were as reliable and representative as possible. The following patient groups were excluded from the analysis: (1) individuals younger than 18 years, as pediatric patients often exhibit different clinical characteristics and treatment responses, which could introduce confounding factors into the analysis and impact the generalizability of the findings; (2) patients who had multiple ICU admissions, as only the first admission was considered in this study to avoid potential bias from patients with recurring or prolonged ICU stays, which could complicate the interpretation of MCHC levels and mortality risk over time; and (3) patients who did not have a recorded MCHC value in their medical records. The exclusion of these individuals ensured that the analysis focused solely on patients for whom MCHC data were available, providing a complete and accurate data set for this investigation. These inclusion and exclusion criteria were carefully selected to enhance the clarity and robustness of our findings. Diagnostic criteria AKI was diagnosed based on the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, which define AKI as an increase in serum creatinine (Scr) by more than 0.3 mg/dL or 1.5 times the baseline value. The severity of AKI was staged according to these guidelines: stage I was defined as an increase in Scr by 1.5 times the baseline value or an increase of more than 0.3 mg/dL; stage II as an increase in Scr by two times the baseline value; and stage III as an increase in Scr by three times the baseline value or an Scr level greater than 4 mg/dL [ 11 Extraction of data R software was used for the systematic extraction and organization of data, enabling thorough and structured categorization into four distinct groups. This approach facilitated a comprehensive analysis of the various factors that could potentially influence the patient outcomes. Each group was carefully designed to capture different aspects of patient characteristics and clinical parameters, allowing for a multifaceted investigation of the relationship between these factors and mortality in ICU patients with AKI. The first group encompassed key demographic information, such as the patient's age, sex, and weight, which collectively formed a foundational profile of the study population. This group was crucial in providing essential context for the patient cohort, allowing for a better understanding of how these basic characteristics might interact with other clinical factors to affect the patient prognosis and outcomes. These demographic variables have long been recognized as important determinants in healthcare studies because they can influence disease progression and response to treatment. The second group focused on the comorbidities present in patients, including heart failure, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, paraplegia, sepsis, and stroke. These pre-existing health conditions were specifically included because they have the potential to significantly impact both the development of AKI and the subsequent outcomes of ICU patients. The presence of multiple comorbidities is known to increase the complexity of patient management and can alter the body's response to AKI, making it an essential factor to consider in any analysis of ICU patients. The third group comprised laboratory parameters measured within the first 24 h of ICU admission. This group included critical metrics, such as red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) counts, hemoglobin and platelet levels, serum sodium and creatinine levels, and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. These laboratory values are pivotal in assessing the physiological and metabolic states of patients at the time of ICU admission. Monitoring these parameters early in the course of critical illness can provide valuable insights into disease severity, the presence of ongoing inflammation or infection, and overall prognosis. These metrics are commonly used to guide clinical decision-making in the ICU and are integral to understanding a patient's health status. The fourth group consisted of illness severity scores assessed at the time of ICU admission. These scores included the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II), Oxford Acute Severity of Illness Score (OASIS), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Each of these scoring systems is widely used in clinical practice to evaluate the severity of acute illness and predict patient outcomes. For example, the SAPS II and OASIS scores consider various physiological measurements and clinical factors, whereas the CCI assesses the cumulative burden of comorbid diseases. The SOFA score specifically focuses on organ dysfunction and failure, which is particularly relevant in the context of ICU patients. By incorporating these established tools into the analysis, this study was able to comprehensively assess each patient's overall clinical condition, providing a more robust evaluation of disease severity [ 12 13 Finally, the last category considered in the analysis involved the use of medications during the ICU stay, specifically, drugs such as epinephrine, dopamine, and vasopressin. These medications are commonly administered to critically ill patients to support cardiovascular function and manage severe hemodynamic instability. The inclusion of this group allowed for the examination of how these interventions might influence patient outcomes, particularly in the context of AKI and its associated complications. By assessing the relationship between medication use and mortality, this study aimed to explore the potential impact of pharmacological management on patient survival in the ICU setting. Missing data Multiple imputation was used to impute missing values for variables with less than 20% missing values [ 14 Clinical outcomes The primary endpoints of this study were 30-day and 90-day mortality during hospitalization. The secondary endpoint was the all-cause mortality during hospitalization. Covariate selection and adjustment Potential confounders were specified a priori and harmonized across MIMIC‑IV and eICU‑CRD. Models adjusted for: (1) demographics/body size (age, sex, weight); (2) comorbidities (heart failure, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, sepsis, stroke, diabetes); (3) admission laboratory indices within 24 h (RBC, WBC, hemoglobin, platelets, serum sodium, serum creatinine, fasting blood glucose); (4) illness‑severity scores (SOFA, SAPS II, OASIS) and comorbidity burden (CCI); and (5) vasoactive medication use (epinephrine, dopamine, vasopressin). Covariates were chosen based on prior literature and clinical plausibility as common causes of both AKI and mortality risk [ 15 16 Statistical analysis Continuous variables in the data set were summarized and presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs), which provide a more accurate representation of the central tendency and spread, especially when the data are skewed or contain outliers. This method of reporting ensures that the results are not disproportionately influenced by extreme values, offering a more robust summary of the data for their interpretation. The choice of medians and IQRs is particularly useful in clinical research, where many variables, such as laboratory results or patient characteristics, may not follow a normal distribution. The Mann–Whitney U Categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages to provide a clear summary of the distribution of categorical data across the groups. To assess the differences between groups for these categorical variables, either the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was applied. The chi-square test is typically used for larger sample sizes, whereas Fisher’s exact test is employed when sample sizes are small or when expected frequencies are low, ensuring that the statistical tests used are suitable for the specific data conditions. For survival analysis, the Kaplan–Meier method was employed to construct survival curves, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of survival over time for both 30-day and 90-day mortality rates in the study cohort. This method provides a visual and statistical representation of survival probabilities and is particularly useful in clinical studies for understanding time-to-event data and comparing survival outcomes between different groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the relationship between MCHC and the risk of 30-day and 90-day in-hospital mortality. These models are well-suited for analyzing time-to-event data and assessing the effects of multiple predictors on survival outcomes. By adjusting for various confounders and covariates, the Cox model enabled a more accurate assessment of the independent association between MCHC and mortality risk. Furthermore, RCS were applied to the models to account for potential nonlinear relationships between the variables and primary outcomes. This approach helps capture more complex associations that may not be adequately represented by linear terms, providing a more nuanced understanding of the data. All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.2.3, a powerful statistical software environment that is widely used in clinical research. A p Results Characteristics of patients After applying the predefined exclusion criteria to the initial data set, 111,817 patients were ultimately included in the analysis, which consisted of two distinct patient cohorts (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Flowchart of the study population In the original cohort, the total number of in-hospital deaths was 7190, corresponding to an in-hospital mortality rate of 13.21%. This mortality rate reflects the severity of illness and high-risk nature of the patient population included in the MIMIC-IV database. Similarly, in the validation cohort, the number of in-hospital deaths was 8774, resulting in an in-hospital mortality rate of 15.29%. The slightly higher mortality rate observed in the validation cohort may reflect variations in patient characteristics or treatment protocols between the two databases and highlights the need for careful interpretation of cohort-specific findings.

Deceased patients had higher values for several key clinical and laboratory parameters, including weight, WBC count, SCr, blood glucose, and illness severity scores, such as the SOFA, SAPS II, OASIS, and CCI. These elevated values suggest that patients who died were generally in more critical condition, with more severe physiological impairments and a higher burden of comorbidities than those who survived. The higher SCr levels observed in deceased patients reflect a more advanced stage of kidney dysfunction, whereas increased WBC counts and blood glucose levels could be indicative of ongoing inflammation, infection, or metabolic disturbances associated with severe illness. In contrast, survivors in the original cohort tended to have higher hemoglobin, platelet count, weight, and RBC levels, which may reflect better overall health, improved hematologic function, and a more stable metabolic state. These differences suggest that patients who survived had a more favorable physiological profile at the time of ICU admission. In addition, the incidence of certain comorbidities was significantly higher in patients who died than in those who survived. Specifically, the incidences of heart failure, respiratory failure, atrial fibrillation, sepsis, and stroke were notably higher in the deceased group. These findings underscore the role of pre-existing health conditions in influencing the prognosis of critically ill patients, with patients with multiple or severe comorbidities at a higher risk of mortality. Conversely, the incidence of diabetes was lower in deceased patients than in survivors, which could be due to a variety of factors, including the possible effects of acute illness on glucose metabolism or differences in the management of diabetes in the ICU setting. These comorbidity prevalence patterns offer valuable insights into the complex interplay between underlying health conditions and mortality in critically ill patients. Similar trends were observed in the validation cohort, further supporting the robustness and generalizability of our findings. In this cohort, deceased patients also had higher values for age, WBC count, SCr, FBG, sodium levels, and severity scores, such as SOFA, SAPS II, OASIS, and CCI. These elevated parameters suggest that the findings from the original cohort were not limited to a specific database but rather reflected general patterns consistent across different critical care settings. Conversely, survivors in the validation cohort had higher levels of hemoglobin, weight, and RBC, similar to the original cohort, indicating that these parameters may be predictive of better outcomes in different patient populations. These consistent trends across both cohorts reinforce the idea that clinical and laboratory markers, along with comorbidity profiles, are important factors influencing patient survival in the ICU.

Multiple models have identified MCHC as a significant protective factor against mortality, reinforcing the robustness of the results across different patient populations. In the unadjusted model, the HR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.91–0.93, p p Similar findings were observed when MCHC was treated as a categorical variable in the validation cohort.

In the unadjusted model, the HR for the highest MCHC quartile compared with the lowest was 0.72 (95% CI 0.68–0.76, p p Together, these findings suggest that MCHC is a significant protective factor for in-hospital mortality, both as a continuous and categorical variable. The results were consistent across different patient cohorts, and the association remained significant even after adjusting for potential confounders, further highlighting the potential of MCHC as an important clinical indicator of mortality risk in critically ill patients. RCS for all-cause mortality In the original cohort, as illustrated in Fig. 3 B P P Fig. 3 RCS for all-cause mortality. A B C D For example, the impact of higher or lower MCHC levels on survival may vary depending on the range of MCHC values, with certain thresholds potentially indicating a higher risk of mortality, while others may be protective. This nonlinear association highlights the importance of considering such complex relationships when assessing clinical biomarkers and their roles in patient prognosis. The statistical significance of this nonlinear association further strengthens the hypothesis that MCHC may serve as a meaningful and potentially modifiable risk factor in the management of patients with AKI. In contrast, in the validation cohort, which is depicted in Fig. 3 D P P P These findings indicate that in the validation cohort, MCHC’s influence of MCHC on mortality risk appeared to be more straightforward, with the risk of mortality increasing or decreasing in a linear fashion as MCHC levels changed. The lack of a significant nonlinear association in the validation cohort implies that, for this patient population, MCHC may have a more consistent and predictable effect on survival, which could simplify its interpretation as a clinical marker of survival. This contrast between the original and validation cohorts emphasizes the potential variability in how MCHC functions as a prognostic factor in different clinical settings and suggests that additional factors, such as cohort-specific characteristics or treatment protocols, may influence the relationship between MCHC and patient outcomes. These contrasting findings between the original and validation cohorts underline the importance of considering the potential for both linear and nonlinear relationships when examining biomarkers in clinical studies. The findings also highlight the need for further exploration of the mechanisms underlying such differences and the factors that could contribute to the observed variation in MCHC's role of MCHC in predicting mortality across diverse patient populations.

This consistency across both cohorts underscores the robustness of our findings and suggests that the relationship between MCHC and mortality is not limited to a specific patient population or database. In the validation cohort, the same patterns were observed, further supporting the idea that MCHC is a reliable and generalizable predictor of patient survival. This replication of results in an independent cohort enhances the credibility of the findings, indicating that MCHC could be a useful clinical biomarker for predicting in-hospital mortality in patients with AKI. The confirmation of these trends across different data sets also suggests that the predictive value of MCHC may be applicable in diverse clinical settings, enhancing its potential utility in clinical practice. Overall, the stratified analysis presented in Tables 3 Discussion In this multicenter cohort comprising MIMIC‑IV and eICU‑CRD ( n MCHC reflects hemoglobin concentration within red blood cells and may capture aspects of oxygen‑carrying capacity, iron availability, and inflammation. Lower MCHC can accompany iron‑restricted erythropoiesis and systemic inflammatory states, both implicated in AKI pathophysiology. These pathways offer biologic plausibility for the observed inverse association. Survival analyses demonstrated stepwise separation across MCHC quartiles with highly significant log‑rank tests, while Cox models showed lower hazards in higher MCHC strata. Spline analyses suggested potential nonlinearity in MIMIC‑IV and an approximately linear pattern in eICU‑CRD, indicating some cohort‑level heterogeneity but concordant directionality. These differences in the relationship between MCHC and mortality across cohorts highlight the need for continued research to understand the underlying mechanisms and further explore how MCHC can be effectively integrated into clinical practice as a prognostic tool. The findings from both cohorts provide strong evidence that MCHC could be an important marker in assessing patient risk; however, future studies are needed to elucidate the factors that might influence the observed variations in different clinical settings. First. Notably, the association between MCHC and mortality appeared nonlinear in the original cohort yet approximately linear in the validation cohort. We interpret this difference as the likely consequence of case‑mix and context rather than a contradiction of the underlying signal. First, the cohorts differ in clinical composition and timing of early care, which may shift the distribution of MCHC—especially the lower tail where iron‑restricted erythropoiesis and systemic inflammation cluster; curvature is, therefore, most visible when more patients accumulate at low MCHC values. Second, MCHC is derived from hemoglobin and hematocrit, and variation in sampling time within the first 24 h and laboratory analyzer/calibration differences across centers can magnify edge effects at extreme values, smoothing the curve in one cohort and bending it in another. Third, practice heterogeneity may differentially influence hematocrit and thus MCHC without altering the overall direction of risk. Importantly, across both databases the direction and clinical message are concordant—higher admission MCHC is associated with lower short‑term mortality—with the shape difference confined largely to extremes of the distribution. These observations underscore that externally validated markers may exhibit cohort‑specific functional forms even when the prognostic direction is stable; future prospective work can delineate how anemia burden, inflammation, and early resuscitation practices modulate this curve. Beyond statistical significance, the magnitude and consistency of the association support clinical relevance for risk stratification. In fully adjusted models, the highest vs. lowest MCHC Quartile was associated with 35–38% lower hazard of death, and the association persisted when modeled continuously. While per‑unit effects are modest—as expected for a ubiquitous laboratory index—the quartile contrast reflects a risk separation that clinicians can recognize at the bedside. Given overall in‑hospital mortality in the 13–15% range in our cohorts, such hazard reductions are compatible with non‑trivial absolute risk differences, especially among patients at higher baseline risk. Importantly, MCHC is low‑cost and universally available at admission, and its signal was externally validated across two large databases after adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, severity scores, admission laboratories, and vasoactive use. We, therefore, view MCHC as a pragmatic adjunct that can enhance early risk triage and prompt evaluation of reversible contributors, rather than as a stand‑alone determinant of therapy. Prospective studies should quantify absolute risk reduction, reclassification, and clinical utility when MCHC is integrated into multivariable risk tools, but our present effect sizes indicate more than merely statistically detectable differences in this context. In ICU patients with acute myocardial infarction from MIMIC‑II, lower MCHC independently predicted hospital and 1‑year mortality [ 17 8 18 The MCHC has emerged as a significant prognostic marker in various medical conditions, particularly in relation to mortality risk. Several studies have explored the association between MCHC levels and patient outcomes across different diseases, highlighting its potential as a valuable biomarker for predicting the risk of death [ 3 4 7 19 20 The relationship between MCHC and the prognosis of AKI remains unclear. We propose several potential explanations for this association. MCHC represents the concentration of hemoglobin within RBC, which directly influences the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. In critically ill patients, particularly those with AKI, maintaining adequate tissue oxygenation is vital for sustaining the organ function. Higher MCHC levels may reflect an enhanced ability to deliver oxygen to tissues, thereby supporting organ function and improving survival, particularly in patients with compromised kidney function. Previous studies have shown that individuals with iron deficiency tend to have significantly lower MCHC values than those with normal iron levels [ 21 21 22 23 Similar to red cell distribution width, MCHC can be considered an inflammatory marker and may influence prognosis [ 4 24 25 26 27 28 Studies have demonstrated that the inflammatory response is not only involved in the onset and progression of AKI but also influences its prognosis and recovery [ 29 30 31 32 33 This is a multicenter study to specifically investigate the role of MCHC in the prognosis of ICU patients with AKI. The significance of this finding lies in its potential clinical implications: MCHC could be a valuable tool for clinicians to predict outcomes in critically ill patients, potentially guiding early interventions and personalized care strategies. Although higher admission MCHC was associated with lower short-term mortality, MCHC should be regarded primarily as a risk marker rather than a proven treatment target. Interventions that may secondarily shift MCHC act on its determinants—iron availability, red cell production/replacement, and dilutional effects—yet causal benefit from deliberately raising MCHC in ICU AKI is unproven. In practice, low MCHC should trigger diagnostic clarification (iron indices, bleeding/hemolysis assessment, review of fluid balance) rather than reflexive correction. Intravenous iron can improve erythropoiesis in true iron deficiency but meta analyses suggest a modest increase in infection risk, warranting caution in septic or highly inflamed states common in ICU–AKI [ 34 35 36 37 38 40 Accordingly, our findings support MCHC as a pragmatic, low cost marker to identify higher risk patients and to prompt correction of reversible causes (iron deficiency, bleeding, hemolysis, profound hemodilution) within current standards of care, rather than endorsing MCHC directed therapy. Prospective studies are needed to test whether interventions that incidentally raise MCHC—when clinically indicated and safe—translate into improved outcomes in ICU AKI. An important limitation is that we could not directly validate the proposed inflammation–iron axis within our cohorts, because canonical inflammatory and iron indices were not uniformly available across MIMIC‑IV and eICU‑CRD and/or exhibited high missingness in the first 24 h. We, therefore, relied on proxies—white blood cell count, sepsis status, and illness‑severity scores—to partially capture systemic inflammation, recognizing that these are imperfect substitutes. The literature supports a biological link between inflammation, iron handling, and AKI outcomes [ 41 46 First, this is a retrospective observational analysis using two large ICU databases; although cross‑database replication enhances robustness, the design precludes causal inference, and prospective validation in contemporary cohorts is needed to test transportability and clinical utility. Second, missing data may introduce bias. We applied multiple imputation for variables with < 20% missingness as prespecified, but acknowledge that if data were not missing at random, imputation may not fully remove bias; variables with greater or heterogeneous missingness (e.g., some laboratory measures) were not imputed and could limit precision. Third, despite extensive covariate adjustment (demographics, comorbidities, admission laboratories, illness‑severity/comorbidity indices, and vasoactive use), residual confounding remains possible due to unmeasured or incompletely captured factors. Measurement variability across sites and timing within the first 24 h may also contribute to misclassification. These considerations underscore that our findings support MCHC as a pragmatic risk marker rather than a treatment target, and they motivate prospective studies with standardized data capture to confirm clinical impact. Conclusion Admission MCHC was associated with 30-and 90-day mortality in ICU patients with AKI across two large databases. Our results suggest that MCHC could be a useful prognostic marker for critically ill patients with AKI and could help inform clinical decision-making. Next steps include prospective multicenter validation incorporating standardized early inflammatory and iron biomarkers, and pragmatic interventional evaluations of clinically indicated strategies to determine whether modifying determinants of MCHC can safely improve outcomes in ICU AKI.
