This novel bridging study demonstrates the clinical interchangeability of two PD-L1 IHC assays in first-line treatment of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-L1 ≥50%. METHODS In the phase III EMPOWER-Lung 1 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03088540 RESULTS A total of 871 patient samples were retrospectively tested using the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP263) assay (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), including 481 enrolled patients and 390 patients who did not pass screening (22C3 PD-L1 <50%). Concordance of 22C3 and SP263 was evaluated in 768 patient samples, with an overall percent agreement (concordance) of 88% between the two assays. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated in the PD-L1 ≥50% SP263+ population (including the 22C3+/SP263+ and 22C3–/SP263+ subpopulations). In the primary analysis, the clinical efficacy of cemiplimab versus chemotherapy in the 22C3+/SP263+ population (n = 324; OS hazard ratio [HR], 0.52 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.80]; PFS HR, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.59]) was similar to that in the 22C3+ population (n = 563). A sensitivity analysis of the overall SP263+ population showed consistent results with the primary analysis. CONCLUSION Similar efficacy (OS and PFS) was observed with the 22C3+ and SP263+ populations, demonstrating the interchangeability of these PD-L1 IHC assays for selecting patients with PD-L1 ≥50% for first-line cemiplimab monotherapy for advanced NSCLC. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes OPEN-ACCESS TRUE INTRODUCTION Over the past decade, immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have revolutionized the systemic treatment of multiple tumor types, including advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 1 2 4 CONTEXT   Key Objective To evaluate the clinical interchangeability of two PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays (PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx and VENTANA PD-L1 SP263) in first-line cemiplimab monotherapy for advanced non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-L1 ≥50%.  Knowledge Generated The overall percent agreement between the two assays was 88%. Clinical efficacy when comparing cemiplimab with platinum-doublet chemotherapy was similar between patients in the 22C3+/SP263+ population and the 22C3+ (primary analysis) population.  Relevance We demonstrate the interchangeability of two PD-L1 IHC assays for selecting patients with PD-L1 ≥50% for first-line cemiplimab monotherapy for advanced NSCLC. Cemiplimab is approved for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC in patients with no EGFR ALK ROS1 5 6 6 Multiple PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays, with unique staining characteristics and scoring approaches, were developed for various immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. 7 9 7 10 12 13 Some studies have assessed the analytical concordance of the different PD-L1 assays in various tumor types, including lung cancers, 14 16 1 15 18 10 19 22 This novel bridging study assessed clinical agreement between the Dako 22C3 assay and the VENTANA SP263 assay to identify patients with PD-L1 expression ≥50% who may benefit from treatment with cemiplimab, using samples from the phase III EMPOWER-Lung 1 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03088540 6 METHODS Sample Inclusion The study design details for EMPOWER-Lung 1 have been published previously. 6 EGFR ALK ROS1 A total of 871 samples from patients screened for the trial were retrospectively tested using the VENTANA SP263 assay, including samples from 481 patients who were enrolled in EMPOWER-Lung 1 (of a total of 710 patients randomly assigned in the study at the time of the primary analysis) 6 Bridging Analysis Concordance between the VENTANA SP263 and Dako 22C3 assays was evaluated based on a previously published study design. 23 The primary end points of the EMPOWER-Lung 1 study were OS and PFS, 6 23 Ethics Approval/Consent to Participate The study protocol was approved by the appropriate institutional review board. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients provided written informed consent for the use of specimens for research purposes. RESULTS In the EMPOWER-Lung 1 study, 3,662 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 710 met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned to receive cemiplimab monotherapy or chemotherapy (Fig 1 6 FIG 1.

Primary Analysis Estimated OS in the 22C3+/SP263+ population (n =324; HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.34 to 0.80]) was similar to that in the 22C3+ population for cemiplimab versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy (n =563; HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.42 to 0.77]; Table 2 2 TABLE 2.

Sensitivity Analysis Given that some patients could not be tested or had an invalid test result using the VENTANA SP263 assay, sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the impact of missing test results via multiple imputation. VENTANA SP263 assay results were imputed based on the observed concordance between Dako 22C3 and VENTANA SP263 status. The sensitivity analysis showed that the results in the overall SP263+ population were consistent with the primary analysis. Even in the worst-case scenario, in which no efficacy benefit in discordant patients was assumed, HRs for OS and PFS were comparable with the original HRs in the best-case scenario (Table 3 TABLE 3.

Adverse Events Assessment of the utility of the VENTANA SP263 assay was conducted on samples retained after completion of the study; as such, adverse events were neither expected nor reported. DISCUSSION In this bridging study of samples from patients with advanced NSCLC, we evaluated the clinical agreement of two PD-L1 IHC assays, Dako 22C3 and VENTANA SP263, using samples from patients who were randomly assigned to receive first-line cemiplimab in the phase III EMPOWER-Lung 1 study. We analyzed the clinical efficacy of cemiplimab versus chemotherapy in patients with PD-L1 ≥50%, comparing the ability of the two assays to identify those likely to benefit from cemiplimab treatment. The estimated treatment effect in the SP263+ population was robust and not affected by variations in the treatment effect assumed for patients discordant from Dako 22C3. Therefore, the VENTANA SP263 assay can be used to select patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression ≥50% for first-line treatment with cemiplimab monotherapy; this assay was recently approved in the United States as a companion diagnostic with cemiplimab. 24 The relatively low positive percent agreement (82.7%) was somewhat surprising as the VENTANA SP263 assay is typically more sensitive than the Dako 22C3 assay. 25 26 v v 16 27 31 6 6 Of note, there were several outlier results (such as a strongly positive Dako 22C3 result that the VENTANA SP263 assay showed close to 0%) observed in the concordance analysis. It is unknown why such discordance might have occurred; however, a plausible explanation may be related to tumor heterogeneity from the cutting of additional sections. Studies such as the Blueprint phase I 1 15 15 18 32 33 1 15 In conclusion, the EMPOWER Lung 1 study established the efficacy of first-line cemiplimab in patients with advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression ≥50% of tumor cells, as determined by the Dako 22C3 assay. In this analysis, comparison with the VENTANA SP263 assay showed a high level of analytical concordance, and an equivalent association of clinical efficacy (OS and PFS estimates) was found in the PD-L1 ≥50% population. The VENTANA SP263 and Dako 22C3 assays can be used interchangeably to identify patients with PD-L1 ≥50% who may benefit from cemiplimab therapy.
