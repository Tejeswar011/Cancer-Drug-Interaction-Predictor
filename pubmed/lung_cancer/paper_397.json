This subtype develops through the lepidic-filigree micropapillary (filigree)-conventional/overt micropapillary (mPAP) pathway. The present study aimed to identify key molecules that promote this progression. To this end, gene expression profiles specific to lepidic, filigree and mPAP elements were investigated in histological sections obtained from 4 different LUAD cases. The 10× Genomics Visium Spatial Gene Expression Solution was used due to its superior resolution compared with conventional microdissection techniques. Cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5) and mucin 21 (MUC21) were identified as common molecules with significantly elevated levels along the lepidic-filigree-mPAP pathway. Furthermore, the present findings indicated that CRABP2 may serve an important role in the early stage of this process, as its level significantly increases during the transition from the lepidic to the filigree substage. Immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of CRABP2, CEACAM5 and MUC21 proteins in 207 surgically resected LUAD samples (expanded sample size) was performed. The present study revealed an increase in the expression levels of CRABP2 between the lepidic and filigree elements, and between filigree and mPAP for CEACAM5 and MUC21. Thus, these three proteins were demonstrated to serve roles in the lepidic-filigree-mPAP pathway at different stages. Notably, these molecules were associated with poor prognosis, characterized by an elevated recurrence rate and poor survival rate. In conclusion, crucial molecules that promote the lepidic-filigree-mPAP pathway, and exhibit potential clinical utility as prognostic markers and molecular therapeutic targets, were identified. lung adenocarcinoma micropapillary histology filigree progression prognosis Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Science, Tokyo, Japan 21K15387 22K15410 The present study was supported by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Science, Tokyo, Japan (grant nos. 21K15387 and 22K15410). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the developed world, with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) being the most prevalent histological type. Various grading methods based on a histological perspective have been proposed to predict prognosis. The micropapillary subtype is a high-grade histological element that serves as a marker of poor prognosis ( 1 2 EGFR 3 via 4 5 6 The Visium Spatial Gene Expression Profiling System (10× Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) has facilitated comparisons of mRNA expression among various histologically distinct elements from a single tissue section ( 7 8 9 In the present study, we aimed to identify key molecules promoting LUAD progression using the Visium Spatial Gene Expression Solution, which offers better resolution than microdissection. We examined gene expression profiles specific to lepidic, filigree, and mPAP elements in identical histological sections to reveal key molecules that promote the lepidic-filigree-mPAP pathway. Materials and methods Patients All LUAD tissues analyzed in this study were surgically resected at the Kanagawa Prefectural Cardiovascular and Respiratory Center between January 1997 and December 2022. The proportion of smokers in lung adenocarcinoma in our study [50.5% (104/207)] was comparable with the previous study investigating Japanese cohort (56.2–61.9%) ( 10 12 Histopathological analyses Formalin-fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tissue sections were sliced and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The proportions of the histological elements (lepidic, acinar, papillary, mPAP, and solid elements) were recorded in 5% increments according to the WHO classification ( 5 6 13 Spatial gene expression profiling Four LUAD samples were analyzed using the Visium Spatial Gene Expression Profiling System (10× Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA). Briefly, the quality of RNA was analyzed using FFPE slides, and all samples that satisfied the DV200 requirement as a standard of RNA integrity were then subjected to the adhesion test. Eight tissue sections (n=2 each from the four LUAD samples) that included lepidic, filigree, and mPAP elements were mounted onto Visium Spatial Gene Expression Slides in oligo-barcoded capture areas (6.5×6.5 mm). Sequencing libraries were generated using Visium Spatial Gene Expression kits, followed by spatial transcript analysis using Visium Spatial Gene Expression Solution (10× Genomics) ( Fig. 1 2 Fig. 1C-1 Immunohistochemical analyses Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 207 surgically resected LUAD samples. FFPE tissue sections were incubated with primary antibodies against cellular retinoic acid binding protein 2 (CRABP2; polyclonal; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5; clone CB30; Lifespan Biosciences, Washington, DC, USA), and mucin 21 (MUC21; polyclonal; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA). The slides were autoclaved to retrieve antigens, and immunoreactivity was then visualized using Simple Stain MAX-PO (MULTI; Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). The reactions were further developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and counterstained with hematoxylin. The intensity of CRABP2, CEACAM5, and MUC21 staining in neoplastic cells was judged as negative (0), weak ( 1 2 Statistical analysis Categorical and continuous variables were respectively analyzed using Pearson chi-square tests or Fisher exact tests, the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's multiple comparison test and the Cox proportional hazards model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of recurrence were generated to establish a cut-off to distinguish ‘high’ from ‘low’ immunohistological scores. Kaplan-Meier curves of recurrence and survival were plotted, and differences in recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were analyzed using log-rank tests. Values with P<0.05 were considered significant. All data were statistically analyzed using JMP 9.0.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Results Changes in gene expression in each LUAD subtype The number of differentially expressed genes was considerably higher during the transition from lepidic to filigree than from filigree to mPAP among all four cases ( Fig. 2 Differentially expressed genes during the lepidic-filigree-mPAP progression Among the four cases, three genes ( CRABP2, CEACAM5 MUC21 Table SI Table SII Table SIII CRABP2 Table SIV Table V Table SVI Immunohistochemical expression of CRABP2, CEACAM5, and MUC21 in different histological elements Among the identified genes, we focused on three- CRABP2, CEACAM5 MUC21 Fig. 3 Fig. 3E and F Fig. 3I and L Fig. 3H and K Fig. 4 Fig. 5A Fig. 5B and C Fig. 5 Fig. 5A and B Fig. 5A and B Fig. 5 Cut-off values for ‘high’ and ‘low’ immunohistochemical scores The optimal cut-off immunohistochemical scores for CRABP2, CEACAM5, and MUC21, determined using ROC curves, were 100, 50, and 80, respectively. We then categorized the samples as ‘high’ or ‘low expressors’ in subsequent correlation analyses. Relationship among CRABP2, CEACAM5, and MUC21 immunohistochemical levels and clinicopathological characteristics The clinicopathological characteristics of the 207 LUAD cases are presented in Table I EGFR Table I Table I Relationship between CRABP2, CEACAM5, and MUC21 levels and highly malignant pathological factors High CRABP2, CEACAM5, and MUC21 expression levels were significantly associated with lymphatic canal invasion [CRABP2, 78 (66.7%) of 117 vs. 35 (38.9%) of 90; Pearson ×2 test, P<0.0001; CEACAM5, 71 (62.3%) of 114 vs. 42 (45.2%) of 93, P=0.0171; MUC21, 28 (73.7%) of 38 vs. 85 (50.3%) of 169, P=0.0112; Table I Table I 1 7 10 Relationships between CRABP2, CEACAM5, and MUC21 levels and postoperative outcomes Individuals with high CRABP2, CEACAM5, and MUC21 expression had significantly worse 5-year RFS rates [CRABP2: 50.7% vs. 73.8%, P=0.0002; CEACAM5: 55.6% vs. 86.5%, P<0.0001; MUC21: 5 58.3% vs. 72.2%, P=0.0475; ( Fig. 6 In addition, multivariate analysis revealed CRABP2 (P=0.0325) and CEACAM5 expression (P=0.0002) as independent predictors of disease recurrence and stage ( Table II A sub-analysis of stage I LUAD revealed that individuals with high CRABP2 and CEACAM5 expression had significantly worse 5-year RFS rates of 71.9% vs. 88.3% (P=0.009) and 68.6% vs. 91.1% (P=0.002), respectively ( Fig. S1 Discussion In the present study, we identified three molecules-CRABP2, CEACAM5, and MUC21-that play crucial roles in promoting the lepidic-filigree-mPAP progression. These molecules may be important in conferring aggressiveness to micropapillary, as their high expression levels were associated with lymphatic canal invasion, high recurrence rates, and poor 5-year survival rates. However, the stage at which these molecules exert their effects appears to vary. Specifically, CRABP2 is likely involved in the early transition from lepidic to filigree, whereas CEACAM5 and MUC21 are implicated in the later transition from filigree to mPAP elements. No significant differences in CEACAM5 CRABP2 To regulate the transcription of downstream genes, CRABP2 transports retinoic acid to the nucleus, where it binds to transcription factors. CRABP2 expression has been detected in lung cancer ( 14 15 16 via in vivo 14 CRABP2 17 18 18 The surface glycoprotein CEACAM5 is involved in cell adhesion, intracellular signaling, and tumor progression. This protein promotes cell proliferation and invasion via 19 20 21 22 MUC21 is a transmembrane mucin expressed in various human neoplasms, including lung carcinomas ( 13 23 13 13 24 25 et al 26 In the present study, we identified CRABP2 and CEACAM5 as independent prognostic markers for LUAD recurrence. Clinically, these molecules have various applications. First, immunohistochemical examination of CRABP2 and CEACAM5 in preoperative biopsied tissue or surgical resected tissue serves as predictive markers to determine the suitability of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Second, the plasma concentrations of these proteins may be used as a screening assay for the early detection of lung cancer ( 27 28 28 29 30 This study has some limitations. First, the quality of RNA extracted from FFPE specimens may deteriorate due to long-term storage or poor storage conditions (such as high temperature and humidity). Japan Pathology Quality Assurance System recommends using FFPE specimens within 2.5 to 3 years of preparation to ensure reliable genetic testing. We use FFPE specimens prepared within 3 years for the Visium Spatial Gene Expression Profiling System. Additionally, these FFPE specimens were stored at temperatures below 25°C. Second, the spatial resolution of the Visium platform was insufficient to analyze the microenvironment surrounding tissue elements (such as lepidic, filigree, and mPAP elements) each in LUAD. However, in recent years, the Xenium spatial transcriptomics platform, which offers higher resolution than the Visium spatial transcriptomics platform, has emerged. This technology will enable the analysis of the microenvironment for different tissue elements of LUAD in the future. In conclusion, we investigated the potential molecular basis of the lepidic-filigree-mPAP progression using the Visium Spatial Gene Expression Solution and identified three molecules that promote this progression. These molecules may have clinical utility as prognostic markers and as potential targets of molecular therapy. Supplementary Material Supporting Data Supporting Data Acknowledgements Not applicable.

(A) The CRABP2 score was significantly higher in filigree elements than in lepidic elements (P<0.0001) but no significant difference was observed between mPAP elements and filigree elements (P=0.8985). (B) The CEACAM5 score was significantly higher in filigree elements than in lepidic elements (P=0.0174) and significantly higher in mPAP elements than in filigree elements (P<0.0001). This difference was more significant between filigree and mPAP elements than between filigree and lepidic elements. (C) The MUC21 score was significantly higher in filigree elements than in lepidic elements (P=0.0094) and significantly higher in mPAP elements than in filigree elements (P<0.0001). This difference was more significant between filigree and mPAP elements than between filigree and lepidic elements.
