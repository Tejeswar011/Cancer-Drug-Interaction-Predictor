Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using Epredia Lab Vision PermaFluor aqueous mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #TA-030-FM), and images were acquired using the Nikon Ci-L microscope connected to a DS-Qi2Mc digital camera equipped with the NIS-ELEMENTS software (Nikon; version D). Finally, the fluorescence signal in the images was quantified using ImageJ software 1.53a (Java 1.8.0_172, National Institutes of Health). IHC analysis of tissues from HB mice Immunohistochemical sections of tissues from HB mice were deparaffinized, rehydrated in distilled water through an ethanol gradient (100%, 90%, and 70%; v/v), before processing with 3% (v/v) H 2 2 PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis The protein concentrations in plasma from all animal studies were applied to the gPKPDsim application 59 79 T- and B-cell peptide epitope prediction Potential T-cell epitopes were predicted by using the NetMHC4.1 tool, with 9-mer peptides against representative human HLA supertypes 80 81 Statistical analysis Statistical differences were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t p Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary Supplementary information  Supplementary Information Reporting Summary Transparent Peer Review file Source data  Source Data Publisher’s note These authors contributed equally: Kristin Hovden Aaen, Maria Francesca Testa.
