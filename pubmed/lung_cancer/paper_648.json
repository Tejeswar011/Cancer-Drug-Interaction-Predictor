Traditional manufacturing methods often fall short\nin achieving the level of precision required for such patient-specific\napplications. SLA is leveraged to craft patient-specific physical\nmodels, encompassing soft, hard tissues, and even introducing color\nto distinguish pathological components. 2.2 Digital Light Processing DLP utilizes\nlight to polymerize liquid resin into solid form.

There are various types of soft tissues, including skin,\ncardiovascular, neural, gastrointestinal, liver, kidney, ocular, and\nmusculoskeletal tissues. Each of these tissues serves distinct functions.\nThey may be damaged due to injury and need to be replaced with surgical\nprocedures. Replacing tissues with other materials poses significant\nchallenges due to issues of biocompatibility and functionality. Although\nthere are many methods for fabricating tissues, 3D printing enhances\nthe ability to create shapes and geometries ranging from simple to\ncomplex. However, 3D printing has limitations, as it cannot produce\nartificial tissues that replicate dynamic characteristics. This is\nwhere 4D printing comes into play using biomaterials to create artificial\ntissues with dynamic properties. Mimicking the required tissue is\nessential, and biomaterials are used to fabricate soft tissues that\ncan be used for replacements. The self-folding mechanism was employed\nto transform 2D planar geometry into 3D MHTs under the influence of\nexternal stimuli.  d co In the context of myocardial repair, 4D-printed cardiac\nscaffolds, incorporating polydopamine (PDA)/alginate and cell-laden\nhydrogel, are developed using NIR stimulus. Figure 4 (A) Use of\nthe photolithographic-stereolithographic-tandem printing\nstrategy (PSTS) in soft lithography to outline scaffolds, followed\nby SLA to imprint micropatterns. This approach enabled the captivating\nshape transformation of a flat heart construct (adapted with permission\nfrom ref 1 2 Heart, lung, and trachea were fabricated using\na 30% Sil-MA mixture\nand the DLP technique. When the heart, along with the aorta, the lungs\nenclosed within the thoracic cavity, and the trachea with its internal\nlumen, are pushed with the thumb and then released, they return to\ntheir previous shape.  Figure 1 2 Prior\nto the addition of gelatin, neural stem cells were distributed\nthroughout a hydrogel based on polyurethane (PU), exhibiting remarkable\ndifferentiation and proliferation at room temperature. Figure Figure The progress in 4D printing technology signifies a substantial\nadvancement in the domain of soft TE. Researchers may now utilize\nsmart materials and advanced printing processes to produce dynamic,\nbiocompatible structures that replicate the intricate shapes and functional\nproperties of genuine tissues. These advancements have immense potential\nfor various medical uses such as regenerating neural tissue and repairing\nthe heart. It has also been demonstrated how 4D printing can significantly\nimprove patient results. 3.1.2 Hard Tissue Engineering 3D printing\nis used to create patient-specific implants and scaffolds to replace\ntissues damaged by defects or injuries. Although these implants are\nbiocompatible, they often lack the ability to support natural regeneration.\nHowever, smart materials printed using 3D technology can evolve their\ncharacteristics over time. Additionally, these implants can mimic\nthe porous nature of bone, facilitating neural network development\nand vascularization. Advancements in fabrication through VPP allow\nfor increasingly intricate geometries. The 3D printing in the realm\nof cartilage TE, the pivotal role of 4D printing takes center stage\nin the regeneration of damaged cartilage tissue. Further, sol-gel-forming hydrogels\nwere used to repair the bone defect by filling the injured bone segments.\nThe bone was restored by using customized scaffolds that matched the\ndefect and repaired it. The neural network was then integrated to\nencourage bone development and aid in the healing process, Figure Figure 5 (A) Bone defect recures\nusing biomaterial. (a 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 Additionally, 4D printing facilitates the production\nof functionally\ngraded polymeric products characterized by tailorable mechanical properties,\nincluding the printing of soft muscles around bones using these materials.\nSuch multifaceted applications underscore the versatility of 4D printing\nin advancing cartilage TE and the creation of complex biological structures. The process of creating\nbiocompatible scaffolds by using SLA involves\nseveral sequential stages. Initially, the scaffold is constructed\nusing vinyl ester resin, and its structure is recorded through an\nSEM imaging technique. Biocompatible scaffolds are then evaluated\nin their original position. After an 8-week implantation period, newly\nformed bone exhibiting remarkable integration with the host is observed\nwith a detailed close-up view. Bone growth and proliferation are enhanced\nalong a surface resembling a sawtooth pattern.  Furthermore,\nSMP-based scaffolds were compressed into temporary\nshapes and reverted to their original form at a specific physiological\ntemperature. These SMP-based structures were 3D-printed and implanted\nfor mandibular bone repair, utilizing a HAp/PCL-based SMP. 3.2 Drug Delivery Devices Drugs have\nlong been instrumental in improving human health, with their chemical\ncompounds rigorously tested and administered to achieve therapeutic\neffects. Over time, the methods of drug delivery have evolved, becoming\nincreasingly complex and innovative in the quest for more effective\ntreatments for specific diseases. The emergence of 4D printing has\nheralded a new era in drug delivery, offering unprecedented control\nover medication release. A biodegradable, shape-memory intestinal\ndrug delivery device is fabricated via 4D printing using a photopolymerizable\nresin composed of poly­(β-aminoester) (PBAE) and stearyl acrylate\n(C18-acrylate).

Soft, biodegradable microswimmers,\nfabricated through 2PP using\nGelMA material, demonstrate complete degradability. Throughout the\nculture period, cell-secreted enzymes contribute to their gradual\nbreakdown, concurrently fostering cell attachment and proliferation.\nFurthermore, a magnetically propelled double-helical microswimmer,\nresponsive to external stimuli such as light, exhibits controlled\nrelease of the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. These light-triggered\ndrug release mechanisms are incorporated into magnetically actuated,\nbiocompatible, and biodegradable chitosan-based microswimmers, all\nof which are precisely engineered through the 2PP. Drug delivery systems mostly employ stimuli-responsive\n4D printing\nto precisely regulate drug release. co 3.3 Biomedical Devices Biomedical engineering\nhas been revolutionized by 4D printing, which creates minimally invasive\nbiomedical devices. These devices include cardiovascular stents, microfluidic\ndevices, soft grippers, actuators, disease detectors, and wound healers. 3.3.1 Micromachines Micromachines are\nused in biomedical engineering to control fluids and act as grippers\nduring minimally invasive medical procedures. Robotic surgical tools\ncan be used to manipulate tissue and aid in surgical operations. These\ntools can grab and manipulate tissue within the body without the need\nfor big incisions. They give means for carrying out accurate and complicated\ntherapies with the least amount of danger or injury to the patient. The fabrication of micromachines for biomedical applications is\nevolving. In this investigation, the incorporation of FeNi nanoparticles\n(NPs) into a photopolymer matrix was undertaken to leverage their\nfavorable characteristics, as illustrated in Figure 7 (A) Magnetically responsive\ngripper: (a 1 2 3 1 2 3 The MRP impeller is also used in sealed engines\nfor microfluidic\napplications and in controlled flow for remote and wireless applications.

Additionally, this material exhibits stretchability\nand is responsive to external stimuli, including variations in temperature,\npH, and chemical composition, influencing both its conductivity and\ndegradation characteristics. These hydrogels find application in wearable\ndevices, effectively measuring body movements and detecting signals\nfrom the fingers, knees, and vocalizations. These breakthroughs demonstrate\nthe potential of combining modern materials and creative printing\ntechniques to create complex biomedical devices that increase patient\ncare and improve the accuracy of medical operations. 3.3.2 Soft Robotics The field of soft\nrobotics in biomedicine is being revolutionized by 4D printing, as\nSMP are being used in heart stents, grippers for holding objects,\nhydrogel-based locomotive soft robots, and microactuators.

However, restricted material options, confined to photopolymer\nresins, underscore a critical necessity for the innovation of a diverse\nrange of cost-effective materials with outstanding properties compared\nto those of existing counterparts. While computational models have\ndemonstrated their utility in anticipating the performance of linear\nand rigid materials using data-driven approaches, the prediction of\nstimuli-responsive materials remains challenging due to their nonlinear\nlocomotion characteristics. The biomedical field has already experienced the influence of 4D\nprinting despite being a nascent technology. Envisaging rapid and\nconsistent expansions, the realization of 4D printing’s full\npotential is anticipated gradually.

In biomedical\nresearch, VPP technology is pivotal for fabricating\nbone grafts and bioactive scaffolds.   In dentistry, the selection of an appropriate biomaterial\nusing\nthe VPP technique is of paramount importance. While ceramic-metal\nalloys stand as the gold standard in dental applications, the biomaterials\nzirconia and lithium disilicate, despite demonstrating commendable\nmechanical properties, present certain limitations that necessitate\ncareful consideration in the context of VPP technology. Notably, zirconia\nexhibits a drawback concerning its incompatibility with UV light,\nposing a constraint on its effective utilization in VPP processes.
