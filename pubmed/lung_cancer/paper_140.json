Background Stroke remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with post-stroke pneumonia significantly impacting patient outcomes. Despite progress in stroke management, there was a lack of emphasis on targeted preventive measures for pneumonia. This study evaluates the impact of airway management guided by Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) on preventing post-stroke pneumonia. Methods A retrospective study was conducted with 100 stroke patients admitted to the general neurology ward between January and December 2023. Patients were divided into two groups based on chronological admission order: 50 received standard airway management (January–June 2023), and 50 received PMT-guided intervention (July–December 2023). The PMT group engaged in structured educational sessions (30 min daily for 7 days) and actionable coping strategies to enhance adherence to airway management. Outcomes assessed included incidence of post-stroke pneumonia (diagnosed by chest CT within 7 days post-admission), respiratory function, length of hospital stay, and cognitive and psychological measures. Results The PMT group showed a lower incidence of pneumonia (16% vs. 34%, p p p p p Conclusion PMT-guided airway management significantly enhances post-stroke outcomes through improved respiratory function, reduced pneumonia incidence, and better cognitive and psychological wellbeing.

Grounded in behavioral science, the intervention was designed to engage both patients and caregivers through structured educational sessions and actionable coping strategies. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study design This retrospective study evaluates stroke patients admitted to the general neurology ward of our hospital between January 2023 and December 2023. Among these patients, 50 underwent standard airway management (admitted January–June 2023), while the other 50 received airway management guided by the principles of the PMT (admitted July–December 2023). Patients were enrolled within 48 h of stroke onset and observed for 7 days with a study endpoint at discharge or 30 days post-admission, whichever came first. 2.2 Ethics statement This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of Nanjing Gaochun People’s Hospital (JS-NJ-010). Because the research relied solely on de-identified patient data and did not pose any risk or affect patient care, informed consent was not required for this retrospective study. This consent waiver was granted by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee, adhering to the regulatory and ethical standards applicable to retrospective research. 2.3 Eligibility and grouping criteria Inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: patients must meet the diagnostic criteria for stroke confirmed by MRI, CT, or other imaging modalities; be 18 years of age or older; voluntarily consent to participate in the study; possess a stable general condition and be conscious; have complete clinical data available; and be admitted to the general neurology ward within 48 h of stroke onset. Exclusion criteria were as follows: patients with psychiatric or cognitive impairments; those with concurrent conditions such as intracranial tumors, meningiomas, head trauma, intracranial infections, shock, or a history of head surgery; patients with cardiac or renal insufficiency; those with local oral or pharyngeal lesions; and patients requiring immediate ICU admission. 2.4 Post-hoc power analysis Prior to data analysis, a post-hoc power analysis was conducted using G*Power 3.1.9.7 for t-tests under the “Means: Difference between two independent means (two groups)” option. The settings included a two-tailed test with an effect size (d) of 0.6 and an alpha error probability ( α n 2.5 Treatment approach Control group (standard airway management): PMT group (PMT-guided airway management): 1 Structured educational sessions 2 Enhanced monitoring protocol 3 Family engagement program 4 Individualized risk assessment 5 Quality improvement activities 2.6 Diagnostic criteria for post-stroke pneumonia Post-stroke pneumonia was diagnosed based on the following criteria within 7 days of admission: (1) new or progressive infiltrate on chest CT scan performed at clinical suspicion; (2) at least two of the following: fever >38 °C, leukocytosis >12,000/μL or leukopenia <4,000/μL, purulent sputum; (3) onset >48 h after stroke admission. Chest CT was typically performed within 3–5 days post-stroke or earlier if clinical symptoms developed. 2.7 General information Demographic and disease-related characteristics of the patients were extracted from the medical records system. These included age, gender, body mass index (BMI), diabetes status, hypertension, smoking history, education level, marital status, employment status, stroke type and severity, level of consciousness, history of previous stroke, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease, antithrombotic treatment, dysphagia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Statistical analyses were conducted on various treatment-related factors, including the average length of hospital stay, antibiotic usage, duration of intubation and oxygen therapy, incidence and onset time of pneumonia, pneumonia severity, rate of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU stay, and occurrence of postoperative complications. 2.8 Pulmonary function Pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength were assessed post-care using a spirometer (Master Screen, CareFusion, Germany). During pulmonary function testing, patients stood upright with their heads in a neutral position, wearing a nose clip and holding the mouthpiece securely. The recorded parameters included forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), the ratio of FEV1 to FVC (FEV1/FVC), and peak expiratory flow rate. For assessing respiratory muscle strength, patients were seated upright. They performed a maximal inspiration immediately following a maximal expiration, maintaining an uninterrupted effort, and then exhaled slowly. This process was repeated three times with a 10-s interval between attempts, and the highest value was recorded as the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP). After a 10-min rest, patients quickly performed a maximal exhalation following a maximal inhalation, repeating this three times. The highest value obtained was recorded as the maximal expiratory pressure (MEP). 2.9 Assessment of stroke severity and level of consciousness The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess neurological impairment, with scores ranging from 0 to 42. Higher scores denote greater impairment. Specifically, a score of 0–1 suggests normal or near-normal status; 1–4 indicates a mild stroke or small stroke; 5–15 suggests a moderate stroke; 15–20 denotes a moderately severe stroke; and 21–42 reflects a severe stroke. The NIHSS has demonstrated a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.689, indicating acceptable internal consistency ( 15 The level of consciousness for both groups was assessed using the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), which has a total score of 15. Higher scores indicate greater alertness. The GCS has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.78, demonstrating good internal consistency ( 16 2.10 Functional independent measurement (FIM) The FIM was widely used to evaluate post-stroke participation. It encompasses six domains of daily function: self-care, sphincter control, transfer, locomotion, communication, and social cognition. The FIM consists of 18 items, each scored based on the level of assistance required, from 1 (complete dependence) to 7 (complete independence). The total score ranges from 18 to 126. The FIM demonstrates high internal consistency, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.973 ( 17 2.11 Barthel Index (BI) The BI was an ordinal scale designed to assess performance in activities of daily living. Total scores range from 0, indicating total dependence, to 100, indicating total independence. Specifically, scores between 0 and 20 reflect complete dependence, 21–60 indicate severe dependence, 61–90 suggest moderate dependence, and 91–99 denote mild dependence. The scale has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.81, indicating good internal consistency ( 18 2.12 State–trait anxiety inventory (STAI) The STAI comprises 40 items, divided into the State Anxiety Scale (S-AI) and the Trait Anxiety Scale (T-AI). Each item was rated on a 1–4 scale, with reverse scoring applied to positively worded items. Both the S-AI and T-AI have maximum scores of 80, with higher scores reflecting more severe anxiety levels in patients. The scale’s Cronbach’s alpha was 0.842, indicating high reliability ( 19 2.13 Patient health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) The PHQ-9 consists of 9 items, each rated on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3, resulting in a total score ranging up to 27. Higher scores indicate more severe levels of depression. The scale has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.78, demonstrating good reliability ( 20 2.14 Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) The MoCA scale comprises 11 items across eight cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuospatial skills, abstract thinking, calculation, and orientation. The total score was 30 points, with scores of 26 or above signifying normal cognitive function. Scores between 21 and 25 suggest moderate cognitive impairment, while scores from 0 to 20 indicate severe cognitive impairment. The MoCA scale has a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.87, reflecting strong internal consistency ( 21 2.15 36-item short form health survey (SF-36) The SF-36 was a health survey instrument divided into eight dimensions: physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical health (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health perceptions (GH), vitality (VT), social functioning (SF), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE), and mental health (MH). Each dimension was scored out of 100 points, with higher scores signifying better quality of life in that specific area. The SF-36 has a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.87, indicating strong internal consistency ( 22 2.16 Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using SPSS 29.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical data were represented as [ n χ 2 T T Continuous variables were tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro–Wilk method. For normally distributed data, results were presented in the format (X ± s). Non-normally distributed data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and results were expressed as the [median (25% quantile, 75% quantile)].

By focusing on the principles of threat appraisal and coping strategies inherent in PMT, the intervention effectively motivated patients and their families to adhere to airway management practices. This motivation was possibly key to the reduction in pneumonia incidences. Enhanced vigilance toward potential complications like extubation or airway obstruction fosters an environment of proactive healthcare, thus mitigating risks associated with pneumonia and mechanical ventilation. The incorporation of PMT appears to significantly impact respiratory function, as evidenced by improvements in forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow rate, and respiratory muscle strength. These enhancements could be attributed to the increased frequency of monitoring and the participatory role of family members in the intervention group ( 23 24 25 The PMT framework establishes clear linkages between cognitive appraisal processes and physiological outcomes through several mechanisms. First, threat appraisal enhances patients’ understanding of pneumonia severity, leading to increased vigilance in performing preventive behaviors. Second, self-efficacy building through hands-on training enables patients to effectively perform airway clearance techniques, directly improving respiratory parameters. Third, response efficacy education helps patients understand how specific interventions (such as positioning and oral hygiene) directly prevent aspiration, thereby increasing adherence ( 26 27 Furthermore, the structured PMT intervention resulted in significantly shorter hospital stays and a reduced need for intubation and oxygen therapy ( 28 29 The reduced incidence and severity of post-stroke pneumonia in the PMT group can be partially explained by the intervention’s tailored approach that factors in individual patient risks, such as obesity or existing ulcers, and adjusts management strategies accordingly. The meticulous assessment of each patient’s condition allows for timely interventions that address specific vulnerabilities, thereby helping to preempt the development of pneumonia ( 30 31 Cognitive and psychological improvements observed in the PMT group reflect the intervention’s holistic approach, integrating cognitive-behavioral strategies with practical airway management techniques. The active involvement of patients in their care plan through self-scoring systems and regular discussions enhances cognitive engagement, which might correlate with improved cognitive outcomes like memory recall and executive function ( 32 33 34 The results indicate that PMT-guided interventions not only reduce the physical complications associated with post-stroke management but also promote enhanced psychological wellbeing and cognitive recovery. Education and social support systems embedded in PMT could lead to patients experiencing reduced feelings of helplessness, which were known to exacerbate depression and anxiety in stroke patients ( 35 Comparing our findings with existing literature, several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of structured interventions in reducing post-stroke pneumonia. A recent systematic review by Chen et al. reported that multimodal interventions incorporating dysphagia screening and oral care reduced pneumonia incidence by 15–20%, similar to our 18% absolute risk reduction ( 36 37 38 Notably, the study highlights an intriguing interplay between educational interventions and physiological outcomes. By promoting understanding and anticipation of potential complications, the PMT framework likely improves adherence to medical advice, enhancing overall patient outcomes ( 39 40 An area of discussion centers on the potential scalability and generalizability of PMT-guided management. The structured nature and the ability to tailor interventions based on patient-specific factors suggest that such an approach could be effectively adapted across diverse clinical settings and patient populations. However, further research focusing on long-term outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and implementation barriers was necessary to delineate the broader applicability of PMT in clinical practice. While this study provides valuable insights into the impact of PMT-guided airway management on post-stroke pneumonia outcomes, there were several limitations that must be acknowledged. Firstly, the study’s sample size, though adequate for preliminary analysis based on our post-hoc power calculation (power = 0.844), may limit the generalizability of the findings across larger and more diverse populations. Additionally, the retrospective design introduces potential selection bias, as patients were grouped based on chronological admission periods rather than randomization. The comprehensive data collection in our study, while unusual for retrospective research, was facilitated by our institution’s standardized stroke care protocols and electronic medical records system. Nevertheless, the study’s design, relying largely on short-term follow-up (30 days maximum), does not capture long-term effects and sustainability of adherence to the PMT-guided protocols. The potential influence of unmeasured confounding variables, such as varying levels of caregiver support and differences in healthcare access, may also have impacted the outcomes. Furthermore, the reliance on self-reported adherence and psychological measures introduces the risk of response bias. The lack of detailed prospective sample size calculation, though addressed through post-hoc analysis, represents a methodological limitation. Future research should aim to address these limitations by employing larger, multi-center randomized controlled trials with extended follow-up periods and incorporating objective measures of adherence and psychological wellbeing to validate the robustness and applicability of the PMT framework in a broader clinical context. 5 Conclusion In conclusion, the study underscores the critical impact of PMT-guided airway management on the prognosis of post-stroke pneumonia. The results highlight the importance of patient and caregiver involvement, facilitated through structured educational interventions and personalized care strategies. Through enhancing respiratory, psychological, and cognitive outcomes, the PMT framework offers a promising approach to managing post-stroke complications. The findings support the integration of behavioral theories into clinical protocols and warrant further investigation through prospective, randomized controlled trials to establish the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of PMT-guided interventions in stroke care.
