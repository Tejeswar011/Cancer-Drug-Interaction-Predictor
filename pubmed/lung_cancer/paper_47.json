Summary Ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is one of the deadliest gynecological malignancies, with 10%–15% of patients exhibiting primary resistance to first-line chemotherapy. To characterize the molecular drivers of chemo-refractoriness, we perform multi-omics profiling of treatment-naive biopsies from patients with refractory HGSC enrolled in the DECIDER observational trial. We demonstrate that chemo-refractory HGSC is characterized by diminished interferon type I (IFN-I) and enhanced hypoxia pathway activity, and baseline IFN-I activity in chemo-naive cancer is an independent prognostic factor. Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial protein profiling analyses corroborate the importance of elevated IFN-I activity in response to chemotherapy. Importantly, in vitro NCT04846933 Graphical abstract Highlights • Low IFN-I activity in cancer cells is a marker of poor response in HGSC • Refractory HGSC shows a lack of cancer cell subpopulation with high IFN-I response • Exogenous interferon-alpha sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin Afenteva et al. combine multi-omics, single-cell, and functional analyses to show that diminished type I interferon signaling in cancer cells underlies inherent platinum resistance in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma. Exogenous interferon-alpha sensitizes cancer cells to cisplatin, nominating interferon pathway stimulation as a precision strategy for refractory disease.

The issue of chemotherapy resistance is particularly acute in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), which is one of the deadliest gynecological malignancies. In 2020 alone, there were approximately 200,000 deaths from ovarian cancer worldwide. 1 2 , 3 , 4 5 TP53 6 7 8 , 9 The standard of care for HGSC is cytoreductive surgery followed by platinum-taxane chemotherapy and possible maintenance therapy with anti-angiogenesis or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. 10 BRCA1 BRCA2 11 12 10 13 In our recent work, we revealed, using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from poorly responding patients with HGSC, that chemoresistance in HGSC is driven by pre-existing and induced cellular states, in particular, stress-associated cellular state. 14 7 Results Patient characteristics We established a subcohort of 31 NACT-treated patients with chemo-refractory HGSC from the prospective, longitudinal, multi-region, observational DECIDER trial (Multi-Layer Data to Improve Diagnosis, Predict Therapy Resistance and Suggest Targeted Therapies in HGSOC; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04846933 Figures 1 S1 STAR Methods 15 For comparison analyses, we selected 62 chemo-sensitive patients with similar baseline clinical characteristics, including the same treatment strategy but at least partial response to primary therapy and platinum-free interval, which is calculated from the last dose of platinum to first disease progression, exceeding 6 months ( Figures 1 S1 STAR Methods Table S1 16 p p Figure 1 Table S1 Figure 1 Study design and clinical characteristics of patients with chemo-refractory and chemo-sensitive HGSC from the DECIDER cohort (A) Schematic representation of sampling procedure and study design.

Treatment with IFN-alpha alone had a negative effect on the growth of COV362 and Kuramochi cells ( Figures S6 Figure S6 p p Figures 5 Discussion Molecular processes driving chemo-refractory disease are poorly understood, and no clinically validated biomarkers or effective therapeutic strategies currently exist for patients with HGSC who do not respond to first-line chemotherapy. To address this urgent but unmet problem, we leveraged the DECIDER observational trial to obtain multi-omics data from patients with chemo-refractory and chemo-sensitive HGSC. By focusing on treatment-naive tumor biopsies, our bulk RNA-seq and complementary analyses were designed to capture the inherent drivers of primary chemoresistance rather than post-treatment adaptive changes driven by rare subclones. 28 Our results show that the basal IFN-I pathway activity in cancer cells is a critical determinant of first-line chemotherapy response in HGSC. scRNA-seq and multiplexed imaging of patient tumor biopsies revealed a pronounced heterogeneity in IFN-I signaling across treatment-naive tumors. Specifically, higher baseline expression of IFN-stimulated genes correlated with improved platinum sensitivity, while low IFN-I activity was associated with poor outcome. Notably, the chemo-refractory tumors displayed a sparsity of IFN-responding cells, highlighting the importance of maintaining a substantial population of IFN-active cells to mediate effective response to treatment. Importantly, we showed that low IFN-I activity in cancer cells is an independent prognostic marker of poor response in patients receiving first-line platinum therapy. Furthermore, survival analysis demonstrated that lower IFN-I activity was also associated with shorter overall survival in the DECIDER cohort. Recent work on molecular characterization of adaptation and acute response to PARP inhibitors suggested that IFN signaling upregulation is an early response. 29 HIF1A 14 Within the confines of our cohort ( n 30 TP53 TP53 BRAF BRAF 31 31 The mechanistic relevance of IFN-I signaling was further supported by combination treatment experiments in ovarian cancer cell lines, which indicated that the IFN-mediated effect on platinum responsiveness is at least partly cancer cell intrinsic and does not solely depend on the tumor microenvironment. We studied two cell lines representative of the clinical scenarios observed in our patient cohort, COV362 and Kuramochi, which differed in their baseline IFN-I activity and, consequently, response to combination treatment. In COV362 cells, we detected baseline variability in IFN-I pathway activity within the cell population, with higher activity indicating a stronger response. Consistently, these cells displayed only a moderate increase in platinum sensitivity when the IFN-I pathway was activated by the addition of IFN-alpha. In contrast, Kuramochi cells exhibited uniformly low IFN-I pathway activity at baseline, and external stimulation with IFN-alpha significantly increased their sensitivity to cisplatin compared to COV362. This suggests that the majority of Kuramochi cells can benefit more from the combined effect (therefore causing a stronger effect in viability) than COV362, in which a subset of cells already have high expression of IFN-I response genes. These results suggest that enhancing IFN-I activity can effectively sensitize tumors with a sparse population of IFN-responding cells to platinum-based treatments. However, it is evident that IFN signaling is not the sole determinant of platinum sensitivity, as intrinsic differences in cisplatin responsiveness between cell lines like Kuramochi and COV362 reflect the involvement of additional resistance mechanisms. 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 Figure S6 Our results suggest that patients with chemo-refractory HGSC may benefit from the stimulation of IFN-I activity to enhance their responsiveness to chemotherapy. Indeed, our combination experiment in ovarian cancer cell lines demonstrated that IFN-alpha exposure can potentiate cisplatin-induced cell death, consistent with a prior phase 2 trial in non-small cell lung cancer in which cisplatin plus IFN-alpha-2 produced notable response rates with acceptable toxicity. 37 38 39 40 41 42 , 43 44 In conclusion, we established IFN-I pathway activity in cancer cells as a key determinant of the response to the primary platinum-based chemotherapy, offering both a putative biomarker and a therapeutic target to overcome chemo-refractoriness in HGSC. By providing a detailed examination of the underrepresented patient population in ovarian cancer research, our results advocate for the urgent initiation of clinical trials to evaluate IFN-I modulation strategies for chemo-refractory patients. Limitations of the study We acknowledge that the precise mechanism of IFN-I pathway suppression remains undetermined. Although the absence of recurrent genomic drivers points toward epigenetic or microenvironmental regulation, mechanistic dissection in immunocompetent pre-clinical models is still required. Our discovery cohort contained only 31 chemo-refractory tumors; under a Poisson model, this affords ∼90% power to detect recurrent alterations that occur in >13% of cases, and—with 47× median coverage—mutations present at < 15% variant-allele fraction in samples of <100% purity may have been missed. Additionally, although no subtype-specific effect was detected in the DECIDER cohort, the sample size may have limited power to reveal subtle IFN-I differences within individual HGSC molecular subtypes. Therefore, validation in larger, independent HGSC cohorts is essential to confirm the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of IFN-I signaling. Since the study focused on resistance to first-line chemotherapy, it remains an open question whether IFN-I also plays a key role in the acquired resistance observed in relapses.

For these analyses, we included patients diagnosed before 2022-03-31. The primary treatment strategy of all patients adhered to the ESMO guidelines, 10 15 13 Figure S1 Table S1 Cell lines and reagents Ovarian cancer cell line COV362 (Sigma-Aldrich) was cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin antibiotics (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Ovarian cancer cell line Kuramochi (JCRB Cell Bank) was cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin antibiotics. All cells were cultured at 37°C under 5% CO 2 Method details Sample preparation and selection Tissue specimens from tumors were collected during diagnostic laparoscopy before treatment or palliative ascites removal and were subsequently subjected to pathological examination. Peripheral blood samples or buffy coat extracts were extracted in Auria Biobank for all patients for DNA extraction and genomic sequencing to serve as germline reference for identifying somatic genomic aberrations using Chemagic DNA Blood Kit Special (PerkinElmer Inc., USA) and Chemagic 360 instrument (PerkinElmer Inc., USA). For other samples, to extract DNA and RNA simultaneously, we utilized the Qiagen AllPrep kit (#80204). Slides of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, scanned. A gynecopathologist (AVi) verified that all samples were indeed serous carcinomas. Tumor samples subjected to bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analyses originated from primary tubo-ovarian sites (ovaries and fallopian tubes) and solid metastatic sites (omentum, mesentery, and peritoneum). As many subsequent analyses required one sample per patient, we prioritized the samples from the solid metastatic sites. When multiple samples from solid metastatic sites were available for a patient, we selected the one with the highest abundance of EOC, according to PRISM. 19 Table S3 Whole-genome and RNA sequencing Tissue samples were extracted from fresh frozen tissue, and those with sufficient DNA/RNA content were sent to BGI (BGI Europe A/S, Denmark) or Novogene (Novogene Europe, UK) for library preparation and nucleotide sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed with either DNBSEQ (BGISEQ-500 or MGISEQ-2000, MGI Tech Co., Ltd., China), HiSeq X Ten (Illumina, USA), or NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, USA) as 100bp or 150bp paired-end sequencing with a median coverage of 47x. RNA sequencing was performed using DNBSEQ, HiSeq X Ten, HiSeq 4000, or NovaSeq 6000 as 100bp or 150bp paired-end sequencing. Bulk RNA-seq analysis RNA-seq preprocessing Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reads were processed using the SePIA pipeline 56 45 46 57 58 46 57 58 59 Bulk RNA-seq decomposition We employed the latent statistical framework PRISM to extract the sample composition, scale factors, and cell-type-specific whole-transcriptome profiles adapted to each transcriptomic sample. 19 Differential expression analysis Prior to differential expression analysis (DEA), we refined the matrix of raw read counts by filtering out genes that were not adequately profiled. The criteria for retaining genes in the analysis were as follows: (1) the gene must have a minimum of 15 total reads across samples within each comparison group, and (2) the gene must have at least 10 counts in at least some samples within each group. This filtering process resulted in an input matrix comprising 15,730 genes across 58 samples. For the DEA, we utilized the Python implementation of the DESeq2 framework pydeseq2 72 TF and pathway activity inference To assess the pathway activity, we employed the Python implementation of the DecoupleR 71 20 decoupler.get_progeny(top = 500) decoupler.run_mlm() 21 decoupler.get_collectri() decoupler.run_ulm() GSEA To infer functional enrichment scores, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 22 23 22 p Cell type abundance estimation The Kassandra 60 Single-cell RNA analysis Sample collection and data pre-processing Tumor samples were collected at the time of laparoscopy, incubated overnight to generate single-cell suspensions, and frozen for later scRNA-seq processing. The scRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single-Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v2.0 (10x Genomics) and were subsequently sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Jussi Taipale Lab at the Karolinska Institutet, Sweden) as well as the HiSeq 2500 and NovaSeq 6000 (Sequencing Unit of the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland). The fastq files were processed using the Cell Ranger software v.6.0.1, including steps for demultiplexing, alignment, barcode filtering, and unique molecular identifier (UMI) quantification. The reference index was created using the GRCh38.d1.vd1 genome with GENCODE v25 annotation. The filtered feature-barcode matrices were pre-processed using the Seurat v4.0.1 toolkit. 75 Cell type annotation Cell type annotation was performed on a broader cohort of 95 single-cell samples 14 , 19 , 24 , 76 , 77 Figures S5 MUC16 PAX8 WFDC2 COL1A2 DCN FGFR1 VIM CD14 CD3D CD79B CD8A FCER1G HLA-DRA NKG7 PTPRC 69 78 Figure S4 IFN-I and TFs activity score assessment To assess the IFN-I pathway activity, we employed the Python implementation of the DecoupleR 71 23 decoupler.get_resource(“MSigDB”) decoupler.run_ora() Figure 4 21 decoupler.get_collectri() decoupler.run_ulm() Cellular states assignment Cellular states were annotated by performing ORA using the marker sets curated in our previous publication. 14 decoupler.run_ora() WGS data analysis WGS data preprocessing The genomic DNA data processing was performed with the Anduril2 workflow platform 45 47 46 48 https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ 49 Mutation calling Somatic short variants were identified by collectively analyzing multiple tumor samples against a single matched normal sample for each patient. This analysis was performed using GATK v4.1.9.0 Mutect2, 79 80 81 7 82 54 55 83 84 85 Germline variants were called as previously described. 7 Tumor fraction estimation Tumor fraction was estimated using a modified ASCAT 50 18 Copy number and breakpoint calling Breakpoint and copy-number segmentation were determined by employing a combination of GRIDSS 61 86 61 87 7 62 62 , 88 89 Mutational signatures and signature events Mutational signatures were fitted, and SBS3- and ID6-based homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) statuses were computed as previously described 90 91 Curation of somatic aberrations To define the genomic status of genes involved in the IFN-I signaling cascade, we curated function-affecting mutations and the dosage of intact gene copies and summarized the dosage perturbation over the whole signaling cascade. First, we collected short somatic mutations and annotated, weighing a mutation as a loss-of-function if its consequence was protein truncation or if it was a missense mutation predicted deleterious unanimously by PolyPhen2 63 92 93 Tissue cyclic multiplex immunofluorescence (t-CycIF) Whole-slide HGSC FFPE samples were stained and scanned iteratively with validated antibodies (DAPI, E-Cadherin (CST, CAT 3199), CK7 (Abcam, CAT ab209601), Vimentin (CST, CAT 9855), pSTAT1 (CST, CAT 8183S)) using RareCyte CyteFinder scanner following the t-CycIF workflow 94 24 65 66 https://github.com/farkkilab/image_processing 25 pl.gate_finder pp.rescale 24 Functional cell lines experiments Cell viability assay To assess the relative 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of COV362 or Kuramochi cells to cisplatin and IFN-alpha, cell viability assays were performed. Briefly, cells (5,000 cells/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and cultured overnight, then treated with either vehicle or different concentrations of cisplatin (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50μM) or IFN-alpha (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000U/μl) for 72 h. For combination treatment, cells were treated with vehicle or 10U/μl of IFN-alpha combined with increasing concentration of cisplatin (0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 30, 50μM) for 72h. Cell viability was assessed by measuring luminescence using CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Cell Viability Assay (Promega) in 2014 Envision multilabel reader (PerkinElmer). Dose-response curves and relative IC50 were generated by GraphPad Prism 10. The IC50 curves of cisplatin for COV362 and Kuramochi cells are shown in Figure S6 Figure S6 Antibody-oligo conjugation Oligonucleotides were conjugated to two antibodies against HGSOC cell surface proteins β2-Microglobulin (β2M) and CD298 (BioLegend) by iEDDA-click chemistry according to CITE-seq antibody-oligo conjugation protocol ( https://cite-seq.com Single-cell RNA seq combined with cell hashing This experiment was performed using Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3.1 (Dual Index) (10x Genomics, CG000317 Single-cell RNA-seq analysis for cell line experiments We performed five replicated experiments for each cell line (COV362 and Kuramochi) under different concentrations of cisplatin (10%, 50%, and 200%) and at two time points (12h and 24h). The following steps were taken to analyze the data. Gene ranking based on cisplatin-induced expression changes For each experiment ( n d Classification of treated cells by cisplatin sensitivity For cells treated with 200% cisplatin for 24h, we calculated a cisplatin sensitivity score (CisSenScore). This was computed as the log ratio between counts in the 1,000 genes with the highest effect sizes (based on the universal cisplatin gene expression signature described above) and the 10,000 genes with the lowest effect sizes (to control for total count variations). To ensure robustness, we tested additional thresholds for defining cisplatin sensitivity (top 1%, 5%, and 10% genes vs. the rest), yielding consistent results ( Figure S7 n Transcriptional programs of heterogeneity in control cells For each experiment ( n Identification of transcriptional programs linked to cisplatin response For each experiment ( n prcomp() predict() For each PC, we calculated Cohen’s d cohen.d() d d d We identified 27 PCs (out of 100) that met these criteria, representing transcriptional programs in control cells that were associated with differential cisplatin sensitivity when upregulated or downregulated in treated cells. Characterization of transcriptional programs linked to cisplatin sensitivity Since we had 5 replicates per cell line, we expected to find the same transcriptional programs across experiments. To validate these patterns, we focused on transcriptional programs that consistently appeared across replicates. We performed hierarchical clustering of the 27 selected PCs and identified three clusters representing robust transcriptional programs associated with cisplatin sensitivity. For each cluster, we calculated the mean transcriptional program across all PCs within the cluster by gene. To further characterize these programs, we used GSEA 22 22 23 Quantification and statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed in R v4.5.0, Python v3.8.10, and Prism (GraphPad). Statistical tests for patient and cancer characteristics were performed using R with the Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U-test for ordinal or non-normal continuous variables. Statistical tests for transcription factor and pathway activities in bulk RNA-seq were performed using Python (package decoupleR v1.6.0), using a gene-weighted univariate linear model for CollecTRI TFs and a multivariate linear model for PROGENy pathways, with two-sided t-statistics references to the appropriate t-distribution to obtain raw p p n p p p Patient survival was analyzed using R (library survival v3.8.3), with a diagnosis of HGSC as the starting point of time at risk and death from HGSC as the endpoint. The follow-up was cut at 2023-01-31, and patients were censored at that time, if alive. One patient was censored at the time of non-HGSC-related death. Hazard ratios were estimated for the PROGENy JAK-STAT Z 16 n n Statistical testing of IFN-alpha and cisplatin effect on cell viability was performed in GraphPad Prism 10 using the nonlinear regression and F-test to compare the curve fit from different treatment models.
