To address these, several interventions were implemented, including sensitisation of physicians, training of laboratory staff, use of automated incubation systems, and improved availability of laboratory consumables. To assess the impact of these interventions, we conducted a follow-up study in a cross-section of inpatients (n = 1080) with suspected bloodstream infections (BSI) admitted in 2024. There were three key changes. First, there was a five-fold increase in requests for blood culture from 8% pre-OR to 40% post-OR. Culture requests were more frequent from child health department (63%) and intensive care units (53%) compared to surgery department (15%). Second, there was a reduction in delays: time from hospital admission to culture request was reduced from 2 days to 1 day, and the laboratory turn-around time was reduced from 7 days to 5 days. Third, there was a marginal improvement ( p blood culture operational research SORT IT bloodstream infections neonatal sepsis laboratory quality antimicrobial resistance antimicrobial susceptibility testing Volta Region Ghana TDR TDR.HQTDR 2422924-4.1-72863 This SORT IT programme was funded by TDR (Grant Number: TDR.HQTDR 2422924-4.1-72863).

Introduction Bloodstream infections (BSI) are serious infections associated with high morbidity, permanent disability, and mortality, requiring hospital admission and emergency care [ 1 2 1 The burden of AMR in hospitalised patients with BSI is globally high, with the greatest impact in Africa [ 3 4 Acinetobacter 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 For effective management of BSI, blood samples for cultures must be drawn prior to the initiation of empirical therapy, which can then be modified based on the CDST results [ 13 14 15 7 The Ho Teaching Hospital (HTH) is a tertiary health facility in Ghana that receives referrals from primary and secondary health facilities for the management of specialised and complicated cases. An operational research (OR) study at the HTH published by Boakye-Yiadom et al. in August 2023 revealed four key findings: (i) a low proportion of patients with suspected BSI had blood cultures requested (8%); (ii) a delay in requesting blood culture (median of 2 days from admission); (iii) high contamination rates in blood cultures (16%); and (iv) long laboratory turnaround times (median of seven days) [ 16 16 Following this study, some interventions were implemented to improve the utilisation and quality of blood culture services for diagnosing BSI. These included (i) sensitisation and training of the treating physicians and nurses such that they develop a high index of suspicion for BSI and use the correct techniques for collecting blood samples; and (ii) the use of automated incubation systems and improving the availability of laboratory consumables for blood CDST. In addition, the laboratory information management system and the EHR were strengthened to better capture key variables such as antimicrobial resistance data and hospital exit outcomes. To assess the impact of these interventions, we conducted a follow-up operational research study to assess if there has been any change in the utilisation and quality of blood culture services among inpatients with suspected BSI at the HTH in 2024. Our specific objectives were (i) to assess the number (proportion) who had a blood culture requested and performed (an indicator of utilisation); (ii) to assess the number (proportion) of specimens that were culture-positive, culture-negative, and culture-contaminated (an indicator of quality); (iii) to describe the common pathogens identified and their antimicrobial resistance patterns; (iv) to assess median duration between (a) the date of hospital admission and the date of specimen receipt at the laboratory and (b) the date of specimen receipt and the date of reporting of results (turnaround time); and (v) to describe the hospital exit outcomes and associated factors. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design This was a cross-sectional study with a retrospective uncontrolled before-and-after approach using secondary data from routine laboratory records and patient EHR between January and December 2024. 2.2. General Setting Ghana is a tropical country situated on the west coast of Africa and has a population of 33 million [ 17 17 2.3. Specific Setting The HTH, affiliated with the University of Health and Allied Sciences (UHAS), is a 306-bed capacity health facility offering tertiary healthcare services to the inhabitants of the Volta and Oti regions of Ghana and neighbouring Togo. The medical directorate comprises departments of internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, child health, public health, and diagnostics and rehabilitation, an accident and emergency unit, and both adult and neonatal intensive care units. In 2024, the outpatient attendance was 212,129, and admissions were 10,936 (Source: Annual Performance Review Report, HTH, Ghana, 2024). Laboratory services are centralised and span haematology, biochemistry, histopathology, serology, microbiology, and blood banking. Additionally, the laboratory serves as the public health reference laboratory for tuberculosis and HIV diagnosis and is part of the network of laboratories for COVID-19 testing services in the country. It is also a sentinel site for AMR surveillance in the country. Health information, including patient, laboratory, and pharmacy records, is managed electronically—mostly with the Lightwave Health Information Management System software (LHIMS), which feeds into the District Health Information Management System (DHIMS2) of the Ghana Health Service. While approximately 90% of the patients are covered by the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), it does not fully cover the costs of all the diagnostic tests, including blood CDST services. 2.3.1. Blood Culture Processing Workflow in HTH Blood culture requests are made by the attending physician via the patient’s EHR for clinically indicated cases. Physicians or nurses obtain aerobic blood culture bottles from the bacteriology unit for inpatients; anaerobic cultures were not part of the standard protocol for this study. Blood samples were drawn from peripheral veins, usually on the forearm for both adults and children. In accordance with the site’s protocol at the time of the study, skin antisepsis was performed using a 70% ethanol solution, allowing it to dry completely. Blood was directly drawn into a syringe—1–3 mL for neonates and 8–10 mL for adults, which are volumes deemed appropriate per standard guidelines—and aseptically transferred into the aerobic culture bottle. Upon receipt in the bacteriology laboratory, all samples underwent a visual inspection to verify the adequacy of the sample volume, in addition to checking labelling completeness. Specimens were then logged into blood culture reception registers (electronic and paper-based) and assigned a unique laboratory accession number. 2.3.2. Laboratory Processing of Blood Cultures Samples received at the blood culture bench are once again checked to confirm that the information on the request form, sample label, and specimen receipt register match. The culture bottle is then scanned, placed into an automated incubator (BD Bactec™, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Dun Laoghaire, Ireland), and incubated aerobically at 35–37 °C. The incubator scans the bottles every 10 min to detect any bacterial growth. Any bottle in which growth is detected is flagged red with a corresponding alarm. After five days of incubation in the automated incubator, if there is no growth, the equipment flags green, and the culture bottle is taken out and recorded as no bacterial growth (negative). This five-day protocol is consistent with the manufacturer’s guidelines for the detection of common bacterial and fungal pathogens and aligns with the objectives of this study. The laboratory scientist on duty then brings that bottle out, disinfects the cover with 70% ethanol, and using a sterile needle draws out 0.5 mL of the fluid. This is Gram stained and sub-cultured on appropriate media (one each on blood agar, chocolate agar in a candle-extinction jar, and MacConkey agar) and incubated aerobically at 35–37 °C. Upon growth of a bacterial pathogen, these are subsequently processed by biochemical means for phenotypic identification. Even though it is recommended to test paired samples, most of the blood samples received at the laboratory are solitary samples. Gram-positive pathogens recovered generally include Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus Escherichia coli Klebsiella Pseudomonas aeruginosa Acinetobacter Candida Aspergillus Staphylococcus Corynebacterium Bacillus Corynebacterium species Bacillus species Micrococcus species Propionibacterium Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is performed via disc diffusion as per CLSI guidelines [ 18 www.ingoco.com Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus 2.4. Study Population We included all inpatients at the HTH from 1st January to 31st December 2024 with clinical diagnoses of suspected BSI, including sepsis, septicaemia, septic shock, pneumonia, neonatal sepsis, catheter-related BSI, puerperal sepsis, septic abortion, urosepsis, endocarditis, meningitis, intra-cerebral abscess, pyelonephritis, enteric or typhoid fever, septic arthritis, peritonitis, cholecystitis, cholangitis, biliary tract infection, typhoid/enteric fever, intra-abdominal abscess, pelvic abscess, fever/pyrexia of unknown origin, osteomyelitis, Ludwig’s angina, and Fournier’s gangrene. 2.5. Data Variables and Data Collection Process In LHIMS, we searched and extracted data for all inpatients admitted during the study period. Additionally, we extracted data for all inpatients for whom blood cultures were requested and processed during the study period. We then merged the laboratory records for patients for whom blood cultures were performed using the patient hospital ID number. Variables extracted were the hospital ID, age, gender, dates of admission and discharge, ward of admission, clinical diagnosis, whether CDST was requested (yes/no), and hospital exit outcomes. Variables for laboratory data extracted included the date of specimen receipt by the laboratory, the result of blood culture (positive, negative, contaminated), whether a final report was issued (yes/no), and the date of the final report issue. For those with positive cultures, information on bacterial isolates identified and antimicrobial susceptibility results were extracted. These entries were subsequently anonymised, assigned unique study identification numbers, and exported for analysis. 2.6. Data Analysis Data were extracted from the LHIMS in Microsoft Excel format (Microsoft corporation™) and exported to Stata (version 16.0, Copyright 1985–2019, StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA) for analysis. We summarised the baseline demographic and clinical data of patients using frequency and proportions for categorical variables. For the continuous variables, we used mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range, as appropriate. The entire cascade of care was depicted in the form of a flowchart and included the following outcome indicators: (i) proportion of patients with suspected BSI for whom cultures were requested (indicator of utilisation); (ii) proportion of specimens processed at the laboratory and among them, the culture-positive proportion, the culture-negative proportion, and the contaminated proportion (indicator of quality); and (iii) frequencies and proportions of bacteria identified. Median (IQR) durations between (a) hospital admission and culture specimen receipt and (b) culture specimen receipt and the sharing of results were calculated. Hospital exit outcomes were categorised as favourable (recovered or discharged) or unfavourable (died, lost to follow-up, referred for further care, absconded, discharged against medical advice). To assess associations of demographic and clinical variables with the outcome indicators, we used chi-square test for comparing proportions. Multivariable analysis using modified Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator was conducted to assess the independent association of demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with (i) request for blood CDST and (ii) unfavourable hospital exit outcomes. Collinearity between the variables was assessed using variance inflation factor (VIF). Variables with a VIF of >10 were excluded from the multivariable analysis. Prevalence ratios (PR) or risk ratios (RR), as appropriate, with a 95% confidence interval (CI), were calculated as measures of association. A p 3. Results 3.1.

Factors Associated with Blood Culture Request Table 1 3.5. Factors Associated with Hospital Exit Outcomes Among the 1080 inpatients with BSI, 22.5% experienced unfavourable outcomes (21.3% death, 0.6% referral for further care, 0.6% absconded). Factors associated with unfavourable outcomes are shown in Table 4 4. Discussion This is the first study from Ghana examining the impact of a package of interventions post-OR study on the utilisation and quality of blood culture services at a tertiary care hospital [ 16 16 p 19 20 Furthermore, the persistently low diagnostic yield of 10% suggests that blood cultures are often requested for patients with a low pre-test probability of bacteremia, or that prior antibiotic use is common. This represents inefficient use of limited laboratory resources in a resource-constrained setting. Both high contamination and low yield undermine the core goals of Ghana’s National Action Plan on AMR by hindering the collection of reliable surveillance data and promoting inappropriate antimicrobial use, rather than enabling targeted, effective therapy. Nonetheless, the observed changes were likely to be due to a package of targeted interventions implemented after the initial operational research study. These included (i) the full-scale operation of an automated blood culture incubator; (ii) addressing the procurement and supply chain gaps for culture bottles and laboratory reagents; (iii) sensitisation of the core hospital management and clinicians at various diagnostic departments, as well as a dedicated Antimicrobial Stewardship (AMS) programme under the Commonwealth Partnership Antimicrobial Stewardship (CwPAMS) programme, which raised awareness about the need to request for cultures to aid targeted treatment; and (iv) capacity-building support for the laboratory staff [ 21 22 23 Under-use of blood cultures in LMICs is well-documented and largely due to limited laboratory capacity [ 24 13 25 The uptake of cultures was significantly higher among neonates and those who were severely ill (patients admitted to intensive care units and accident and emergency departments) compared to inpatients from surgery and obstetrics and gynaecology departments. The reasons for this are unclear and need further investigation. While pre-intervention barriers such as lower clinical suspicion of BSI and hesitancy to request testing may have historically contributed to this disparity, the institution of sustained sensitisation and stewardship interventions was specifically designed to mitigate these factors by raising awareness and demonstrating utility. Therefore, the persistence of this gap post-intervention suggests that intrinsic differences in the patient case mix, where surgical and obstetrics/gynaecology patients may less frequently present with classic sepsis syndromes compared to critically ill or neonatal patients, is now a more likely explanatory factor than physician resistance. This warrants further investigation to tailor future diagnostic stewardship efforts for these specific departments. The high uptake at the child health department is similar to observations made by Rahden et al. in Gambia [ 26 The overall decrease in laboratory turnaround time may be attributable to the use of automated blood culture system in the bacteriology laboratory and overall workflow improvements. Automated blood culture systems with automated alerts and continuous bottle monitoring are well known to speed up detection. Many recent studies in LMICs show that automated incubators detect >80% of positive bottles within 24 h compared to approximately 65–94% in the manual system [ 24 27 20 Despite these gains, blood culture contamination remained high at 14%, only marginally down from 16% pre-OR. This far exceeds international benchmarks such as that of the CLSI and related guidelines, which set a contamination target of <3%, with an ideal closer to 1% [ 20 28 28 20 The overall blood culture positivity for true pathogens remained low (10%), though showing an increment compared to the previous study (7%). This is in line with other Ghanaian and African reports. A nationwide Ghana surveillance found only 11.2% of cultures grew pathogens, and in a large Ghana referral centre, only 9.3% of blood cultures yielded true pathogens. Low diagnostic yield suggests cultures being requested for patients with a low probability of bacteremia, exposure to antibiotics prior to culture, or limited incubation of blood cultures to a maximum of five days, which may have failed to detect some slow-growing pathogens. Prior studies in Ghana have noted that early empirical antibiotics, often given before culture request, and even misdiagnosis of other febrile illnesses, contributes to low yields. It is also possible that inadequate blood volume reduced sensitivity. Low yield has clinical implications; thus, most patients with negative cultures will be treated empirically. Without a confirmed pathogen, clinicians lack definitive guidance to narrow therapy, underscoring the need to improve diagnostic accuracy. Diagnostic stewardship is therefore vital, and blood CDST requests should be reserved for patients with true clinical sepsis and obtained before antibiotics are started to maximise both yield and the utility of the results [ 29 The pathogen and CDST data are concerning for emerging resistance. Although numbers were small, most (five out of seven) of the Staphylococcus aureus 30 31 32 The broad antimicrobial resistance observed here, including high MRSA and resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, thus heightens the urgency of stewardship and justifies the emphasis in Ghana’s National Action Plan that empirical therapy should be guided by up-to-date local antibiograms. The overall mortality rate of 21.3% observed in our study aligns with the grave prognosis associated with bloodstream infections (BSI) in similar resource-limited settings across sub-Saharan Africa. A study from a large tertiary hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, reported a stark fivefold increase in mortality among patients with a positive blood culture (50.0% vs. 9.8% for culture-negative patients) [ 33 33 This study has several strengths. First, we had a large sample and included everyone with suspected BSI during the study period, thus enabling robust analysis of data including factors associated with culture request and hospital exit outcomes. Second, we used routine hospital data which are likely to reflect ground realities. Third, we followed the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines in conducting and reporting the results of our study. There are some limitations too. First, the overall numbers of true pathogens were small. Hence, caution is needed when interpreting the magnitude of resistance patterns observed. Second, the number of demographic and clinical factors available to assess associations with culture uptake and outcomes were limited (with some of them being collinear to each other). Third, we did not investigate the reasons for lower uptake from certain departments such as surgery and obstetrics and gynaecology. This needs further investigation using qualitative inquiry. However, the uneven uptake of blood culture across departments, reflecting real-world clinical practice, limits the comparability of AMR patterns and outcomes between these patient groups. The findings on resistance patterns are therefore most representative of the patient populations in high-uptake departments (e.g., Child Health, ICU) and may not be generalizable to all inpatients with suspected BSI. Fourth, using the interval from admission to issuance of laboratory report as a proxy for diagnostic lead time was based on the assumption that all patients had these infections at admission and did not account for possible healthcare-associated infections. Furthermore, the high proportion of solitary blood culture samples received by the laboratory represents a key limitation. The inability to obtain paired samples from separate venipuncture sites impedes our ability to reliably differentiate true bloodstream infection from contamination, particularly for common skin commensals like coagulase-negative staphylococci. This likely affects the precision of our reported contamination rate and the clinical interpretation of some isolates. Despite these limitations, our study has many implications and provides the basis for several recommendations. First, we need to investigate the reasons for the gap in the uptake of blood culture and act based on these findings. Moving from 40% to 100% will not be easy and will require a combination of approaches, which include (i) the targeted engagement of departments that are not optimally involved; (ii) a review of the cost structure of CDST services and collaboration with the Ministry of Health to offer it to patients free of charge; and (iii) the augmentation of traditional diagnostics such as CDST with rapid molecular and advanced identification systems such as Vitek—this is likely to reduce the turnaround times [ 34 5. Conclusions In conclusion, we found that a package of interventions based on the findings of an operational research study led to a major improvements in utilisation (five-fold increase in uptake of blood culture) and modest improvements in the quality of blood culture services—namely, a reduction in laboratory turnaround times and a marginal reduction in contamination rates—in a tertiary hospital in Ghana. Several recommendations have been made to achieve universal coverage of all patients with bloodstream infections with blood culture services.
