Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) is an unfolded protein response sensor with a significant role in endothelial integrity and barrier function. This study investigates the effects of Ceapin-A7, which is an ATF6 inhibitor, in mediating the protective effects of pasireotide (PAS) in the endothelium. Ceapin-A7 suppressed PAS-induced glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94) augmentation, cofilin deactivation, and MLC2 dephosphorylation. Furthermore, ATF6 inhibition counteracted the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects of PAS in human and bovine lung endothelial cells, as evidenced by increased ROS generation and suppression of pSTAT1, pSTAT3, pERK1/2, and pP38. Our study adds information on the protective actions of pasireotide in endothelial cells and supports ongoing efforts to enrich our knowledge of the pathophysiology of sepsis and lung injury.

Protease inhibitor ( AB287909 Cell cultures BPAEC were available from Genlantis (USA). The cells were maintained in DMEM (VWRL0101–0500) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum from VWR (USA). HULEC-5a were subcultured in media specific for endothelial cells (PCS-100-030), supplemented with a growth factor kit (PCS-100-040) from ATCC (USA). A solution of 1 × penicillin/streptomycin was added to the media ((VWR (USA)). The cells were grown at 37°C in a humidified environment of 5% CO 2 Western blot analysis Cell lysates were separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS-PAGE) Tris–HCl gels, and the protein content was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated for 1 h in a solution of 5% milk to block non-specific binding sites. The membranes were exposed to the appropriate primary antibodies at a concentration of 1:1,000 in a cold room for 16 h. Appropriate secondary antibodies (1:5,000) were used to detect the corresponding primary antibodies, and SuperSignal West Femto (PI34096) was used to generate the light, which was captured with the ChemiDoc System from Bio-Rad (USA). Original blots are provided in the Supplementary material section (see section on Supplementary materials Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) – dextran assay Paracellular permeability was estimated using 24-well transwell dishes. After treatment, the cells were incubated for 45 min with FITC-dextran (70 kDa, 1 mg/mL). 100 mL of media was removed from each receiver well to assess fluorescence, which was measured with a Synergy H1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Reader from BioTek (USA). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 485 and 535 nm, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement Cells were seeded onto a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 10 4 Densitometry and statistical analysis Densitometry was carried out using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health), and the data are described as mean ± SEM (standard error of the mean).

Upon endothelial hyperpermeability responses, protein-rich fluid leaks into the interstitial and alveolar spaces. Concurrently, endothelial cells shift toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype with upregulated expression of E-selectin, P-selectin, and ICAM-1, promoting neutrophil adhesion, activation, and migration ( 23 24 25 SSA were developed to bind to somatostatin receptors and suppress tumor growth. Dr Schally’s group and other investigators have synthesized cytotoxic somatostatin analogs, which are linked to compounds such as doxorubicin, to target cancer cells. These agents have been associated with anti-inflammatory activities, in addition to their tumor-suppressive effects. PAS was selected in our study because it is a multi-receptor, FDA-approved SSA, which ameliorates cell injury and vascular leak in endothelial cells and mice ( 17 10 9 11 Our findings reveal that inhibition of ATF6 leads to reduced expression of GRP94. This molecular chaperone is a downstream target of ATF6 signaling, which is essential for maintaining ER proteostasis and cell survival under stress conditions ( 26 27 28 Ceapin-A7 mitigates PAS-induced phosphorylation of cofilin and dephosphorylation of MLC2, both of which are pivotal regulators of actin filament remodeling, which is critical to endothelial barrier function. Cofilin inactivation stabilizes actin filaments and tightens intercellular junctions, thereby reducing endothelial permeability ( 29 30 31 ATF6 inhibition increases ROS generation, paracellular permeability, and inflammation. Dextran-FITC assay confirms that PAS enhances endothelial barrier integrity, an effect compromised by Ceapin-A7, supporting the idea that ATF6 is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling ( 32 33 The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway can promote vascular inflammation and permeability ( 34 35 36 Future studies utilizing genetically modified, endothelial-specific knockout mice will further our observations ( 37 Supplementary materials Declaration of interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the work reported.
