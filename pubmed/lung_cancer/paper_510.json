Anesthetics have long been recognized as essential pharmacological agents for surgical procedures, primarily valued for their ability to induce unconsciousness and provide analgesia. However, emerging research over the past 3 decades has revealed an additional and potentially transformative property of certain anesthetics: their ability to protect the heart against ischemic injury. This comprehensive review examines the cardioprotective effects of both intravenous and volatile anesthetics, with particular focus on propofol, ketamine, isoflurane, and sevoflurane. We analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying their protective actions, including modulation of mitochondrial function, reduction of oxidative stress, and regulation of key survival pathways such as PI3K/Akt/GSK3βand p53 signaling. The review evaluates preclinical evidence from cellular and animal models, as well as clinical studies investigating anesthetic-mediated cardioprotection in cardiac surgery patients. Special attention is given to the phenomenon of anesthetic preconditioning and postconditioning, their comparative efficacy, and the challenges in translating these protective strategies into clinical practice. We also discuss emerging concepts such as the role of microRNAs in mediating anesthetic-induced protection and the potential cardioprotective benefits of anesthetic combinations. Finally, we identify critical gaps in current knowledge and propose future research directions that may enhance the clinical application of anesthetic-mediated cardioprotection. general anesthesia propofol ketamine isoflurane cardiology The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Our analysis focuses on propofol, ketamine, and volatile anesthetics (isoflurane, sevoflurane), which represent the most extensively studied agents in cardioprotection research. Building upon previous comprehensive evaluations ( De Hert et al., 2005 Pagel and Crystal, 2018 Lin et al., 2021 Van Allen et al., 2012 Chiari and Fellahi, 2024 Tamura et al., 2025 The potential clinical impact of anesthetic cardioprotection is substantial. Successful translation of these effects could improve outcomes in cardiac surgery, enhance management of acute coronary syndromes, and potentially inform novel approaches to heart failure prevention. Furthermore, elucidation of these protective mechanisms may guide development of new pharmacological agents that provide cardioprotection independent of anesthetic effects, potentially benefiting non-surgical patients at risk of ischemic heart disease. 2 Mechanisms of anesthetic-induced cardioprotection 2.1 Propofol Propofol (2,6-diisopropylphenol) has emerged as one of the most clinically important intravenous anesthetics, with accumulating evidence demonstrating its remarkable cardioprotective properties ( Figure 1 H et al., 2021 Zhao et al., 2015 FIGURE 1 Molecular mechanisms of anesthetic-mediated cardioprotection. Diagram showing the pharmacological effects of Propofol, Ketamine, and Isoflurane/Sevoflurane on cardiac protection. Propofol effects: PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway activation, iron homeostasis regulation, FoxO transcription factors modulation, oxidative shielding, reduction of lipid peroxidation. Ketamine effects: cAMP signaling modulation, anti-inflammatory effects, NMDA receptor antagonism, context-dependent inotropy. Isoflurane/Sevoflurane effects: G protein-coupled receptor activation, mitochondrial protection, reduction of oxidative stress, microRNA modulation, metabolic advantages. The center features an illustration of a heart within a shield. The cardioprotective mechanisms of propofol are primarily mediated through activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway, a crucial survival pathway in cardiomyocytes. Detailed mechanistic studies have shown that propofol significantly upregulates Caveolin-3 (Cav-3), an essential membrane scaffolding protein that plays pivotal roles in cardiomyocyte function, signal transduction, and survival. These investigations demonstrated that propofol exerts a protective effect by specifically inhibiting proteasomal degradation of Cav-3 during the critical phases of ischemia-reperfusion injury. This preservation of Cav-3 leads to markedly enhanced activation of the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway ( Zhu et al., 2017 Recent advances in our understanding of propofol’s cardioprotective effects have revealed another significant mechanism involving its regulation of iron homeostasis in cardiomyocytes ( Zhang et al., 2019 Sun et al., 2024 Pan et al., 2022 in vivo Li et al., 2022 Further expanding our understanding of propofol’s multifaceted protective effects, studies have identified its significant influence on FoxO transcription factors, which serve as master regulators of cellular responses to oxidative stress. Comprehensive research has shown that propofol post-conditioning dramatically improves outcomes following hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced injury by reducing apoptosis and modulating autophagy in cardiac cells through upregulation of forkhead transcription factors ( H et al., 2021 Zhang et al., 2022 The intrinsic antioxidant properties of propofol deserve particular emphasis in any discussion of its cardioprotective mechanisms. The drug’s unique chemical structure, featuring a phenolic hydroxyl group, confers exceptional free radical scavenging capabilities that make it particularly effective at mitigating oxidative stress during the critical reperfusion period ( Marik, 2005 Hausburg et al., 2020 Ranjbar et al., 2014 Yoo et al., 1999 Xia et al., 2004 Shao et al., 2008 Perhaps most intriguingly, clinical and experimental observations have revealed that propofol’s cardioprotective effects follow a clear dose-response relationship ( Shao et al., 2008 Vanlersber et al., 2008 Shirakawa et al., 2014 2.2 Ketamine Ketamine has emerged as a uniquely versatile intravenous anesthetic with multifaceted cardioprotective properties that distinguish it from other agents in its class ( Figure 1 Trimmel et al., 2018 Molojavyi et al., 2001 Hirota and Lambert, 2011 Zanos et al., 2018 Hudetz and Pagel, 2010 Cope et al., 1997 Ko et al., 1997b Han et al., 2002 Zanos et al., 2018 Zhang et al., 2024 Jian et al., 2018 The drug’s cardioprotective mechanisms operate through an integrated network of pathways that address multiple aspects of ischemic and inflammatory myocardial injury. A particularly noteworthy mechanism involves ketamine’s modulation of cAMP signaling, which serves as a crucial second messenger system in cardiomyocytes ( Peña and Wolska, 2005 Hill et al., 1998 Ketamine’s robust anti-inflammatory properties constitute another major component of its cardioprotective arsenal ( Natoli, 2021 Ibrahim et al., 2017 Bi et al., 2024 Santos et al., 2025 Zhang et al., 2021 The NMDA receptor antagonism that forms the basis of ketamine’s anesthetic and analgesic properties also contributes meaningfully to its cardioprotective profile ( Tyagi et al., 2009 Abbaszadeh et al., 2018 Lisek et al., 2020 Iacobucci and Popescu, 2024 Ketamine’s effects on myocardial contractility present a fascinating paradox that underscores the context-dependent nature of its actions ( Kunst et al., 1999 Hanouz et al., 2004 Sprung et al., 1998 The convergence of these diverse mechanisms - spanning metabolic regulation, inflammatory control, receptor modulation, and functional preservation - establishes ketamine as an exceptionally versatile cardioprotective agent. Its multifaceted action profile makes it particularly valuable in complex clinical scenarios where myocardial ischemia coexists with systemic inflammation, autonomic instability, or pre-existing cardiac dysfunction. Looking forward, important research priorities include the development of optimized dosing protocols for specific high-risk populations (such as patients with septic cardiomyopathy or advanced heart failure), investigation of potential synergistic effects when combined with other cardioprotective strategies (including remote ischemic preconditioning or targeted temperature management), and exploration of its role in emerging applications like donor heart preservation for transplantation. 2.3 Volatile anesthetics Volatile anesthetics, including isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane, have been extensively documented to exert significant cardioprotective effects across both preclinical and clinical investigations ( Van Allen et al., 2012 Tanaka et al., 2004 Pratt et al., 2006 Suda and Uka, 2022 Hara, 2006 Riess et al., 2004 Figure 1 Agarwal et al., 2014a Kikuchi et al., 2015 Zhang T. et al., 2025 Isoflurane demonstrates comprehensive cardioprotection through several synergistic mechanisms: substantial reduction of oxidative stress, preservation of mitochondrial structural and functional integrity, and optimization of intracellular calcium homeostasis ( An et al., 2007 Agarwal et al., 2014b Liu and Liu, 2018 Lang et al., 2013 Li et al., 2012 Ge et al., 2022 Sevoflurane has emerged as a clinically promising cardioprotective agent, exerting its effects through multiple synergistic mechanisms. The anesthetic enhances myocardial ischemic tolerance primarily by activating protein kinase C (PKC) and mitochondrial ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, thereby preserving mitochondrial function during ischemia-reperfusion injury ( Hara et al., 2001 Jiang et al., 2016 Bouwman et al., 2007 de Ruijter et al., 2003 Bouwman et al., 2006 Guerrero-Orriach et al., 2024 Shao et al., 2025 Liu et al., 2025 These molecular effects translate to measurable clinical benefits, as demonstrated in randomized trials showing sevoflurane’s superiority over propofol in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Specifically, sevoflurane-treated patients exhibit reduced postoperative troponin release and improved ventricular functional recovery ( Marcos-Vidal et al., 2014 Likhvantsev et al., 2016 Beukers et al., 2025 Qin and Zhou, 2023 Ozarslan et al., 2012 Landoni et al., 2007 Volatile anesthetics also appear to influence myocardial metabolism in ways that may enhance ischemic tolerance ( van den Brom et al., 2013 Stowe and Kevin, 2004 Stowe and Kevin, 2004 Yamanaka and Hayashi, 2009 Zhang et al., 2023 + - Hu et al., 2023 Song and Hu, 2024 Modi et al., 2023 Zou et al., 2024 Ferrando et al., 2015 Bonanni et al., 2020 Zhang et al., 2023 Park et al., 2020 3 Comparative cardioprotective efficacy of anesthetic agents 3.1 Intravenous vs. volatile anesthetics The comparative cardioprotective efficacy between intravenous and volatile anesthetic agents has been extensively studied in both laboratory and clinical settings, with a primary focus on patients undergoing cardiac surgery ( Bonanni et al., 2020 Bein et al., 2005 De Hert et al., 2002 He et al., 2008 Liu et al., 2021 Schumacher et al., 2009 Diz et al., 2010 Wolf et al., 2021 The differential effects likely stem from distinct molecular mechanisms: volatile anesthetics primarily act through preconditioning pathways involving mitochondrial KATP channels and protein kinase C activation, while propofol’s benefits are more related to its antioxidant properties and direct effects on cellular survival pathways. This mechanistic diversity suggests potential advantages for either approach depending on the specific clinical scenario and patient characteristics. 3.2 Age and comorbidity considerations The effectiveness of anesthetic-mediated cardioprotection demonstrates significant variability across different patient populations, with age and comorbid conditions emerging as key determinants of therapeutic response ( van den Brom et al., 2013 Ruiz-Meana et al., 2020 Domene et al., 2025 Shirakawa et al., 2014 Advanced age similarly influences anesthetic cardioprotection, with experimental studies showing attenuated protective effects in senescent animal models for both volatile anesthetics and propofol ( Ruiz-Meana et al., 2020 Suleiman et al., 2015 Sniecinski and Liu, 2004 Liu and Xia, 2012 Drenger et al., 2011 Canfield et al., 2016 Amour et al., 2010 Canfield et al., 2012 These collective findings emphasize the necessity of developing personalized anesthetic regimens that carefully consider multiple patient-specific factors including developmental stage and chronological age, the presence and severity of metabolic comorbidities (particularly renal and hepatic function), baseline myocardial function, and the anticipated surgical stress and ischemic burden ( Zhu et al., 2024 Abraham et al., 2023 Zhu et al., 2023 Chen et al., 2025 Zhu SQ. et al., 2025 Yurkovich et al., 2024 4 Clinical applications and challenges 4.1 Cardiac surgery applications The most compelling clinical application of anesthetic cardioprotection lies in cardiac surgery, where ischemia-reperfusion injury remains an unavoidable consequence of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping ( Torregroza et al., 2020 Landoni et al., 2019 Uhlig et al., 2016 De Hert et al., 2002 Zangrillo et al., 2015 Zhang Y. et al., 2025 Yu and Beattie, 2006 Li and Yuan, 2015 Zangrillo et al., 2022 Piriou et al., 2000 De Hert et al., 2008 Landoni et al., 2013 Meybohm et al., 2015 Bagnol et al., 2024 Sandeep et al., 2022 Chen et al., 2022 Lurati Buse et al., 2012 Yu, 2011 4.2 Expanding applications in non-cardiac surgery While the cardioprotective effects of anesthetics are most extensively studied in cardiac surgery, emerging evidence suggests potential applications in high-risk non-cardiac procedures ( Van Allen et al., 2012 Landoni et al., 2009a Bas et al., 2012 Landoni et al., 2009a Harris, 2022 Chen et al., 2018 Kvarda et al., 2022 Eltzschig and Eckle, 2011 Jahn et al., 2022 Landoni et al., 2009b Hovaguimian et al., 2014 Kalogeris et al., 2012 Zaugg et al., 2014 Stoppe et al., 2017 Petersen et al., 2018 Habte et al., 2024 Landoni et al., 2009b Wong and Irwin, 2016 Hong et al., 2019 Schild et al., 2019 Yoo et al., 2024 Orriach et al., 2020 4.3 Translational challenges Despite compelling preclinical evidence demonstrating the cardioprotective potential of various anesthetics ( Li et al., 2024 Figure 2 Lin et al., 2021 Pagel, 2009 Kikuchi et al., 2015 Mio et al., 2008 Frässdorf et al., 2009 Alemany et al., 2023 Glance et al., 2018 Sandroni et al., 2021 See, 2023 Kahol et al., 2011 Zho et al., 2016 Riess, 2009 Priebe, 2005 Chiari and Fellahi, 2024 FIGURE 2 Challenges in translating anesthetic-induced cardioprotection from bench to bedside. Diagram titled \"Translational Challenges\" with four sections: Patient-Related Variability, Pharmacological & Multifactorial Complexity, Research & Clinical Translation Gaps, and Protocol Optimization Challenges. Each section lists specific challenges related to the main topic. A human figure and a mouse are depicted in the center. 5 Future directions To overcome current limitations and fully realize the clinical potential of anesthetic-mediated cardioprotection, several key research directions should be prioritized. First, there is an urgent need to develop validated biomarkers—using genomic, proteomic, or metabolomic profiling—that can identify patients most likely to benefit from specific anesthetic strategies. Integrating these biomarkers with emerging perioperative precision monitoring platforms, such as continuous hemodynamic and metabolic tracking, would enable dynamic, physiology-guided personalization of anesthetic regimens tailored to individual patient characteristics and real-time surgical demands. Second, investigating rational combinations of anesthetics—such as pairing volatile agents with propofol or adjuncts like dexmedetomidine—may yield synergistic effects that maximize protection while minimizing adverse outcomes; this approach should be systematically evaluated in both preclinical models and clinical trials. Third, exploring non-anesthetic drugs that target the same protective pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt activators or mPTP inhibitors) could lead to novel cardioprotective therapies applicable to non-surgical settings like acute coronary syndromes. Finally, large-scale, multicenter clinical trials employing standardized outcome measures are essential to establish evidence-based protocols for different patient populations and surgical contexts. These trials should incorporate advanced monitoring techniques to assess cardioprotection in real-time and employ long-term follow-up to evaluate lasting clinical benefits. Importantly, as recent advances highlight the need to integrate organ protection with patient-centered recovery outcomes, future studies should simultaneously evaluate both cardioprotective efficacy and functional recovery metrics—as demonstrated in non-cardiac settings where anesthetic selection directly influences quality of recovery—to comprehensively optimize perioperative care ( Zhu S. et al., 2025 6 Conclusion The cardioprotective effects of anesthetics represent an exciting convergence of anesthesiology and cardiovascular science. While challenges remain in translating these effects into consistent clinical benefits, the accumulated evidence strongly supports the concept that anesthetic choice can meaningfully influence cardiac outcomes. As our understanding of the underlying mechanisms continues to grow, so too will our ability to harness these effects for patient benefit.
