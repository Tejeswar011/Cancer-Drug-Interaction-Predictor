Although quality-of-life compromising afflictions, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), are driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), there is a growing appreciation that the concentration of VEGF is not the only influencer of vascular dysfunction within the retina. Herein, activin A (activin), a ligand of the transforming growth factor-β superfamily, attenuated VEGF-induced vascular endothelial–cadherin disorganization, pore formation, and permeability of primary human retinal endothelial cells. Efforts to further investigate the mechanism of this phenomenon revealed that activin reduced the expression of Rab11, which was required for the activin effect. The activin effect was not observed in cells with suppressed expression of the endosomally localized protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP1b), whereas protein tyrosine phosphatases present on the plasma membrane were dispensable. Activin attenuated VEGF-mediated phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 at 30 minutes and longer post-stimulation time points. Together, these data support the concept that activin suppressed VEGF-induced barrier relaxation by perturbing trafficking of activated VEGF receptor 2. This activin-based suppression of responsiveness to VEGF was compromised in the endothelium of pathologic blood vessels from patients who developed end-stage proliferative DR. This defect rendered human retinal endothelial cell hyperresponsive to VEGF and was not observed in retinal vessels of diabetic mice, which do not develop the angiogenic forms of DR. These data provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of proliferative DR in patients.

The most common forms are activin A (βA-βA) and activin B (βB-βB). Activin A (activin) is expressed by various vascular cell types and ensures the formation of stable, mature multilayered vessels. 22 ACVR2B ACVR1B 23 Inhba Acvr1b 24 Here, VEGF-driven cellular responses were attenuated following a 48-hour exposure to activin, 25 Materials and Methods Materials Primary human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were purchased from Cell Systems (ACBRI 181; Kirkland, WA).

Mice Diabetes (DM) was induced in 8-week–old male C57BL/6J mice (Jax number 000664; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), as previously described. 26 ad libitum 2 Retinal Vessel Isolation Retinal microvessels were insolated as described previously. 27 LS006328 Cell Culture HRECs were seeded onto tissue culture dishes that were coated with a 0.04% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and cultured in Lonza endothelial cell basal media supplemented with EGM SingleQuots, 5% penicillin-streptomycin solution, and D-glucose to a final concentration of 30 mmol/L. Cells were cultured in this medium for at least 10 days before use. Cells cultured in high glucose were used to model DM, and thereby are a more appropriate match to endothelial cells from patients with DM. The culture medium was refreshed every 24 hours; the cells were passaged within 24 to 48 hours of reaching confluence. Isolation of Patient Retinal Endothelial Cells Patient retinal endothelial cells were isolated from vitrectomy cassettes obtained after vitrectomy surgery. The contents of the vitrectomy cassette were poured into 50-mL conical tubes and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1000 × g PECAM1 VWF, CDH5 CLDN5 The demographics of the patients are listed in Supplemental Table S1 Cellular Permeability The electrical resistance of the cell monolayer was assessed using an electrical cell-substrate impedance-sensing (ECIS) ZThera instrument (Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY), as previously described. 28 6 Gelatin Trapping Assay The gelatin trapping assay protocol and the formulation of biotinylated gelatin were as previously described. 28 Cells were washed three times with room temperature DPBS and then treated with 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. After three 5-minute washes with ice-cold DPBS, cells were incubated with permeabilization solution (0.25% Triton X-100 in DPBS) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Once cells were permeabilized, they were washed again with DPBS three times for 5 minutes per wash. Plates were blocked with AD buffer (10% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.05% Tween 20 in DPBS) for 1 hour at room temperature. After aspirating the AD buffer, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with 1:400 dilution of VE-cadherin primary antibody in AD buffer. The next day, the cells were washed with DPBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 three times for 5 minutes per wash and then incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with 1:1000 fluorescently tagged secondary antibody in AD buffer. Once the incubation with the secondary antibody was complete, cells were washed two times in DPBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and once in PBS for 5 minutes per wash, and then counterstained with DAPI diluted in DPBS 1:1000 for 1 minute. After one final wash with DPBS, 12-mm glass coverslips were mounted onto the glass bottom using a drop of antifade mounting media. Plates containing fixed cells were subjected to imaging with a Zeiss confocal microscope (Jena, Germany). At least two images per plate were collected at ×63 (scale bar = 20 μm) using the 405-nm (DAPI), 488-nm (VE-cadherin), and 594-nm (streptavidin) lasers. Quantification of pore intensity was accomplished using ImageJ-Fiji version 2.1.0/1.53c (NIH, Bethesda, MD; https://imagej.net/software/fiji 28 2 2 siRNA HRECs were plated onto 60-mm gelatin-coated plates and grown to confluency in complete Lonza medium without antibiotic supplements. Cells were transfected with 2 mL of 10 or 20 nmol/L nontargeting control or the indicated si-On-target complexed with Dharmacon transfecting reagent (1:2 ratio) in Opti-mem medium. The medium was replaced with complete Lonza medium 24 hours after transfection and incubated for another 24 or 48 hours before sample collection for quantitative real-time PCR or Western blot analysis. For ECIS analysis, cells were plated to confluency on two 100-mm gelatin-coated dishes cultured in Lonza medium without antibiotic supplements. Cells were transfected with 10 nmol/L siACVR1B or siACVR2B or 20 nmol/L siPTPRB, siPTPN1, siPTPRJ, or nontargeting control siRNA complexed with Dharmacon transfecting reagent (1:2 ratio) in serum-free medium for 24 hours. After this incubation, cells were plated on gelatin-coated 8-well chamber slides for ECIS (8W10E+). At 24 hours later (48 hours after transfection with siRNA), cells were treated with activin for 0, 10, 18, or 24 hours, whereupon the ECIS assay began, in which 100 ng/mL VEGF or vehicle was added (after 48 hours of knockdown). For siRNA directed against RAB11a (siRAB11a) experiments, cells were plated on chamber slides and allowed to adhere for 24 hours. They were then transfected with 10 nmol/L siRAB11a or nontargeting control siRNA for 48 hours. Following transfection, cells were treated with 100 ng/mL VEGF or vehicle, and TEER tracings were recorded for at least 20 hours. Plasmids and Lentivirus Preparation and Transduction in HRECs Lentivirus was produced by transfecting three types of plasmids [LeGo-Mcherry (Addgene, Watertown, MA) or LeGo-mCerulean-Rab11a, 29 29 5 Quantitative Real-Time PCR RNA was extracted from freshly isolated retinal vessels using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (catalog number 74034; Qiagen), as outlined in the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was extracted from cultured cells using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). The RNA concentration and purity were determined via spectrophotometry (Implen NanoPhotometerTM NP80; Westlake Village, CA). In total, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with a cDNA-synthesis kit (HighCapacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit; Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed using the QuantStudioTM 7 Flex system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA) with Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). For normalization and relative quantification, the cycle threshold values of the housekeeping gene β-actin was used. Quantitative real-time PCR was conducted using gene-specific primers ( Table 1 Table 1 List of Gene-Specific Primers Mouse Forward primers Reverse primers Acvr1 5′-CTCAGACCCGACATTAACTTCTC-3′ 5′-GACAGCATTGACTCTCCTTCTT-3′ Acvr1b 5′-CTGTGGCTTGTCTCTGACTATC-3′ 5′-CCATGCCATCAGGAGGTAAATA-3′ Acvr2b 5′-GTTTGTCTTCGTGGGTGTAATG-3′ 5′-CAAGGGTGTTGCTCCAAATG-3′ β-actin 5′-GAGAGGTATCCTGACCCTGAA-3′ 5′-TGAAGGTCTCAAACATGATCTGG-3′ RNA Sequencing Total RNA was isolated from triplicate dishes of HRECs that were plated onto 60-mm gelatin-coated plates, grown to confluency, and then exposed to vehicle or activin (50 ng/mL) for 24 hours using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was assessed by the University of Illinois at Chicago Genome Research Core using Tapestation. Libraries were prepared and sequenced by the University of Chicago Genomics Facility. The sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Basic processing of the raw data was performed by the University of Illinois at Chicago Research Informatics Core, as previously described. 30 The activin RNA-sequencing (RNASeq) data have been deposited to the Gene Expression Omnibus database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc= GSE291008 GSE291008 For patient retinal endothelial cells, cells were homogenized using a QIAshredder column (Qiagen), and the RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality was assessed before sequencing using Tapestation (Agilent) by the University of Chicago Genomics Facility. Libraries were prepared and sequenced by the University of Chicago Genomics Facility using the NOVASeqX (Illumina).

This study was performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Single-Cell RNASeq Analysis The single-cell RNASeq transcriptomic data set that was reanalyzed in this study was GSE178121 33 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc= GSE178121 33 Pecam1 Cdh5 Pdgfrb Cspg4 34 Western Blot Analysis HRECs were plated onto 60- or 35-mm gelatin-coated plates and grown to confluency before treatment. Cells were treated with 50 ng/mL activin or vehicle for 24 hours. For VEGF signaling experiments, then serum starved for 2 to 3 hours (Lonza media with 2% fetal bovine serum and all supplements except VEGF) before adding 100 ng/mL VEGF or vehicle for 5, 10, 15, 30, or 360 minutes. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.5) and lysed in an electrophoresis sample buffer (10 mmol/L EDTA, 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.2 mol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 200 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.2% bromophenol blue). Proteins were resolved on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blot analysis. The membranes were blocked in TBST (10 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20) containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 hour at room temperature and then probed overnight at 4°C with the specific primary antibody. Following the washing steps, the membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, or at 4°C with secondary antibodies. The specific protein bands were visualized with the ImageQuant LAS 4000 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantified using ImageJ version 1.53 ( http://imagej.nih.gov/ij VEGFR2-Rab11 Colocalization Immunostaining for VEGFR2 and Rab11 was performed as described for the Gelatin Trapping Assay. VEGFR2 was stained using a 1:400 dilution of VEGFR2 primary antibody and 1:500 dilution of fluorescently tagged secondary antibody. Rab11 was stained using a 1:200 dilution of Rab11 primary antibody and 1:200 dilution of fluorescently tagged secondary antibody. Plates containing fixed cells were subjected to imaging with a Zeiss confocal microscope (Jena, Germany). At least four images per plate were collected at ×63. Quantification of VEGFR2 and Rab11 colocalization was accomplished using ImageJ-Fiji version 2.1.0/1.53c ( https://imagej.net/software/fiji The bar graph depicts the percentage of VEGFR2 signal above the noise threshold, which overlaps with Rab11 signal above the noise threshold. Statistical Analysis Data analysis/graphs were prepared using GraphPad Prism version 10.4.1 (GraphPad Software, Boston, MA). Results The Early Activin Effect Develops in <48 Hours Exposing primary HRECs to activin for 48 hours was previously shown to suppress VEGF-mediated permeability. 25 Initially, activin co-administered to cells with VEGF had no effect, but progressively attenuated VEGF-induced permeability, as assessed by monitoring the electrical resistance across the monolayer ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Supplemental Figure S1 Figure 1 Supplemental Figure S1 Figure 1 Supplemental Figure S1 Figure 1 Supplemental Figure S1 Figure 1 Activin affects agonist-dependent permeability in an agonist-dependent manner. Basal and agonist-induced permeability of primary human retinal endothelial cells was quantified in real time using electrical resistance using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing. A: B: A C: B dashed-line boxed area Left: Right: t A C P P The effect of activin on cytokine-induced barrier relaxation was also tested. TNF-α–driven barrier relaxation was enhanced instead of suppressed, as was the case with VEGF ( Figure 1 Supplemental Figure S2 Table 2 Supplemental Figure S2 Table 2 Table 2 Summary of the Influence of Activin on Basal and Agonist-Induced Permeability Variable Effect of 24-hours activin on permeability Basal None VEGF Attenuated TNF-α Enhanced IL-1β Variable IL-6/sIL-6R None sIL-6R, soluble IL-6 receptor; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor. Activin Affects Agonist-Mediated Changes in the Physical Properties of the Barrier The effect of activin on the physical properties of the barrier in both basal and agonist-induced settings was investigated. The first physical parameter considered was pores within the monolayer. This outcome was detected by observing and quantifying the retention of fluorescently labeled streptavidin added to the medium of cells plated onto a layer of biotinylated gelatin. 28 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Activin suppresses and enhances vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)– and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α–mediated pore formation. A: B: C: Arrows double arrows B C P P A The second physical property of the barrier examined was the organization of VEC, one of the components of the adherens junction. 35 36 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Activin suppresses and enhances the impact of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, respectively, on the disorganization of the adherens junction. A: B: A 2 2 C D: C D E F: E F C F P A B Although each of the agonists induced disorganization of VEC, the nature of the disorganization was distinguishable. VEGF and TNF-α both increased straight junctions, but VEGF induced the finger morphology to a greater extent than TNF-α ( Figure 3 Combining the pore and VEC organization data enabled the characterization of a leaky barrier. Paracellular pores (red signal near green signal) were exclusively associated with barriers harboring areas of disorganized VEC ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Furthermore, the disorganization of VEC was insufficient for pore formation because not all barriers in which the VEC was disorganized held pores ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 The effect of activin on the organization of VEC and pore formation was agonist-dependent ( Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 1 Figure 2 3 Suppressed Expression of Rab11 Is Required for the Early Activin Effect To investigate how activin attenuates VEGF-mediated barrier relaxation, receptor considering trafficking, which influences the fate of activated receptor tyrosine kinases such as VEGFR2, was examined. 37 Figure 4 10 , 11 , 38 RAB5A RAB11A, RABEP2 Table 3 RAB11A Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Activin reduces expression of Rab11.

A: B C: A D: Figure 1 dashed-line boxed area P Suppression of Rab11 was tested to determine whether it was the only change necessary for the early activin effect; however, this was found not to be the case. Activin attenuated VEGF-induced permeability in siRAB11A cells as well as in cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA (siSCR) ( Figure 5 Supplemental Figure S5 Because trafficking affects the half-life of receptor tyrosine kinases, the effect of activin on this parameter for VEGFR2 was assessed. Figure 6 Figure 6 Activin suppresses VEGFR2 phosphorylation after ≥30 minutes of stimulation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A: B C: C A C P Rab11's involvement in the early activin effect suggests a role for VEGFR2 trafficking, which would influence the duration of its activation. Consequently, the influence of activin on the extent and kinetics of VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGFR2 was evaluated. In activin-treated cells, VEGFR2 phosphorylation was reduced following ≥30 minutes exposure to VEGF ( Figure 6 Figure 6 25 The Early Activin Effect Is Dependent on PTP1b The first step in investigating the involvement of PTPs in the early activin effect was to determine if activin altered their expression. Activin had no impact on the expression of PTP1b, VE-PTP, or DEP-1 in the time frame corresponding to the early activin effect ( Figure 7 Figure 7 25 Figure 7 The early effect of activin begins prior to any detectable change in the levels of PTPs. A: B: B P The second approach to test the importance of PTPs demonstrated that PTP1b was required for the early activin effect. In this series of experiments, the consequence of reducing the expression of each of the three PTPs on the ability of activin to suppress VEGF-induced barrier relaxation was investigated. Activin could not attenuate VEGF-induced permeability in cells in which expression of PTP1b was reduced ( Figure 8 Supplemental Figure S6 Figure 8 Supplemental Figure S6 Supplemental Figure S7 Figure 8 PTP1b ( PTPN1 A: PTPRB PTPRB B: dashed-line boxed area P Comparison of the early and late activin effect mechanism indicated that activin uses multiple mechanisms to antagonize VEGF-mediated activation of VEGFR2. At first, activin altered the trafficking of activated VEGFR2 by reducing the level of Rab11 and promoting dephosphorylation and degradation of activated VEGFR2. As the duration of exposure to activin increased, the VE-PTP level increased, thereby inactivating VEGFR2 at the plasma membrane, even before it begins to traffic. The Molecular Profile of Patient Retinal Endothelial Cells Suggests Hyperresponsiveness to VEGF The relevance of the activin effect (suppression of responsiveness to VEGF) in the context of clinical PDR was investigated. The progression of DR is marked by distinct stages starting with loss of resilience to DR, followed by the appearance of non-proliferative DR. Non-proliferative DR results from DM-induced damage to the vasculature resulting in capillary dropout and diminished blood flow to the neural retina. 41 5 42 Endothelial cells were isolated from these surgically derived patient specimens by pelleting the material present in the vitrectomy cassette, lysing red blood cells, enzymatically digesting the pelleted material to generate a single-cell suspension, and then isolating the endothelial cells using CD31 + A rank-order analysis approach was used to assess whether the expression of a given gene was altered in the endothelium of patients with end-stage PDR compared with the endothelial data set from non-DM/DR donors. 31 43 GAPDH TBP CDH5 VWF Figure 9 Supplemental Figure S8 NOS3 44 Figure 9 Figure 9 ACVR2B A: GAPDH TBP PECAM1 NOS3 ACVR2B P B: ACVR2B ACVR2B C: Figure 1 dashed-line boxed area A n A n A P P This same approach was used to determine whether the expression of genes encoding members of the activin pathway was altered in the endothelium of patients with end-stage PDR. Expression of ACVR2B Figure 9 ACVR1B INHBA FST One implication of reduced expression of ACVR2B 23 ACVR2B Figure 9 Figure 8 45 , 46 ACVR2B 42 Attempts to perform the above-mentioned experiments with patient-derived endothelial cells instead of HRECs were unsuccessful. This is partly because of the small number of cells recovered from a given patient. Primary endothelial cells do not thrive if their numbers are low. Expression of Acvr2B Is Increased in the Retinal Vessels of Mice that Develop DR The clinical data described in the preceding section were complemented by comparing the expression of members of the activin pathway in retinal vessels isolated from control mice and mice that had developed DR. The first approach to address this question used the single-cell RNASeq data set from Sun et al. 33 Figure 10 Cdh5 Pecam1 Pdgfrb Cspg4 Figure 10 Supplemental Figure S9 47 Acvr2b Figure 10 Acvr1b Inhba Fst Figure 10 Acvr2b A: B: Pecam1 Cdh5 Pdgfrb Cspg4 C: Acvr2b Acvr2b D: E: line D n D n D P P The second approach to assess the effect of DR on the expression of the activin pathway in the retinal vasculature involved quantitative real-time PCR analysis of retinal vessels isolated from mice with DR or age-matched non-DM control mice ( Supplemental Figure S10 Acvr2b Acvr1 Acvr1b Figure 10 Inhba Fst Increased expression of activin receptors suggests hyporesponsiveness to VEGF. Indeed, analysis of the gene expression profile in the hybrid cells with gene set variation analysis revealed that they had significantly reduced activation of VEGF signaling, VEGFR2-mediated vascular permeability, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase activation gene sets in diabetic retinas ( Figure 10 In summary, activin expression was negatively correlated with VEGF-driven pathogenesis. In diabetic mice, which do not advance to PDR 48 , 49 Discussion Exposing cells to activin for 48 hours increases expression of VE-PTP, which dephosphorylate VEGF-activated VEGFR2 and thereby attenuate a cell's sensitivity to VEGF. 25 Although activin suppressed a cell's ability to respond to VEGF, it had the opposite effect when the same cells were stimulated with TNF-α and enhanced TNF-α–mediated barrier disruption. Trafficking is a potential explanation for this observation. Although it is likely that the activin-mediated reduction in the level of Rab11 broadly affects trafficking, VEGF and TNF activate their receptors and their subsequent trafficking differently. VEGFR2 is a tyrosine kinase whose activation involves the phosphorylation of key tyrosine residues that stabilize a catalytically active conformation of its intracellular domain. 50 51 52 53 DR that manifests in diabetic rodents reflects the early, pre-angiogenic stage of DR that develops in patients. 52 53 54 55 56 26 , 54 , 55 48 , 49 , 56 57 58 59 The growing recognition of the existence of endogenous systems that regulate responsiveness to VEGF provides a rationale for developing therapies aimed at restoring vascular homeostasis through mechanisms distinct from the conventional anti-VEGF approaches. These conceptual advances guide the development of biomarkers and therapeutics for patients with vascular diseases. Activin itself may not be the best therapeutic target because it has opposing effects on VEGF and TNF-α, both of which promote the pathogenesis of diseases such as PDR. 60 Disclosure Statement None declared.
