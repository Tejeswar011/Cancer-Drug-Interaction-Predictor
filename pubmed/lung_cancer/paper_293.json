This issue becomes even more pressing during times of armed conflict and the subsequent recovery period, as research indicates an increased incidence of T2DM among combat veterans, largely due to post-traumatic stress disorder. Although numerous antidiabetic drugs are currently available, achieving optimal control of hyperglycemia continues to be problematic.

Chemical structures of twenty-one molecules are displayed in a grid, each labeled by a number. The structures contain fused aromatic rings, heteroatoms like nitrogen, and various functional groups including fluorine, methyls, and hydroxyl groups. 2.2 Pharmacological studies 247 White male Wistar rats, each weighing between 260 and 280 g and aged 3.5 months, were employed in the experimental investigations. These animals were procured from the “Biomodelservis” nursery and maintained on a standard diet under a regular light–dark cycle, with unrestricted access to food and water. All experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the “Regulations on the Use of Animals in Biomedical Research” ( 86 2.2.1 Preliminary screening Prior to the commencement of the experiments, the rats were fasted overnight, and each animal was weighed. The test substances were administered intragastrically in either an aqueous solution or as a finely dispersed suspension stabilized with Tween 80, at a dosage of 50 mg/kg. The hypoglycemic potential of the synthesized compounds was determined by assessing the alterations in blood glucose levels before and following administration. For each compound, glucose levels were measured in six rats at 2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-hours post-administration. The evaluation of the potential hypoglycemic activity was based on the observed change in blood glucose concentration after a single oral dose, with measurements obtained via a “One Touch Select” blood glucose meter. A dynamic area under the curve (AUC) was calculated, where the time intervals (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours) served as the z-coordinate and the percentage decrease in glucose levels as the y-coordinate. 2.2.2 Induction of primary insulin resistance Primary insulin resistance was induced by administering daily intramuscular injections of dexamethasone at a dosage of 0.125 mg/kg over a period of 13 days ( 87 88 87 88 2.2.3 Oral glucose tolerance test Glucose was administered intragastrically at a dosage of 3 g/kg using a noninvasive probe. Blood samples for glucose determination were collected immediately before administration and subsequently at 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes thereafter. A dynamic area under the curve (AUC) was calculated, where the time intervals (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5 hours) served as the z-coordinate and the percentage increase in glucose levels as the y-coordinate. 2.2.4 Adrenaline test Rats received an intragastric dose of a 0.18% adrenaline solution at 0.5 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected for glucose analysis immediately before the administration, and at 30 and 90 minutes after the dose. 2.2.5 Rapid Insulin test Insulin was administered intraperitoneally at a dosage of 1 unit/kg. Glucose levels were measured immediately before and 30 minutes after injection. 2.2.6 Statistical analysis Data were processed using standard statistical software packages, specifically “Microsoft Office Excel 2003” and “STATISTICA ® 2.3 Docking study Docking was carried out using the CB-Dock service ( 89 90 3 Results 3.1 Pharmacological studies At the initial stage, in order to identify promising candidates for further in-depth investigation of hypoglycemic activity, the blood glucose-lowering effect of a series of synthesized compounds was assessed using a normoglycemic model. The selection of doses for the experimental compounds was based on the efficacy of structurally related drugs or those with similar mechanisms of hypoglycemic action, as recommended by established guidelines. Based on these considerations, a dose of 50 mg/kg was chosen. Each compound was tested on a group of six rats during the screening phase. To evaluate the glucose-lowering effect over time, the percentage reduction in blood glucose was measured every two hours following oral administration of the test compound. Based on these data, the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the mean percentage decrease in blood glucose over time. The results of the hypoglycemic activity assessment in the normoglycemic model (  Table 1 Table 1 Effect of the tested compounds on blood glucose levels in rats under normoglycemic conditions.

The selection of compounds was based on their pronounced glucose-lowering activity under normoglycemic conditions, as well as their belonging to different classes of triazino[2,3-c]quinazoline derivatives. Specifically, compound 17 contains the simplest substituent at 6th position, compound 3 incorporates pharmacophoric sulfo-group, compound 18 bears a camphoric acid moiety, and compound 20 can be considered a structural analogue of biguanides. This model reproduces key pathological features such as impaired secretory function of pancreatic β-cells, development of insulin resistance, reduced carbohydrate tolerance, and decreased sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin action. Glucose homeostasis parameters were assessed using the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), the adrenaline test, and the short insulin test. These tests allow for the evaluation of basal glycemia, insulinemia, and carbohydrate tolerance.

In the group of animals treated with compound 18, the average increase in blood glucose levels at 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes after glucose loading increased to 42.8%, 52.4%, 46.4%, and –1.7%, respectively. Moreover, the area under the glucose-time curve (AUC) was the lowest among all tested groups, reaching 53.16%*h (  Table 2  Table 3 The short insulin tolerance test was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of both the liver and peripheral tissues to insulin. Analysis of the obtained results demonstrated that none of the tested compounds were capable of enhancing liver or peripheral tissue sensitivity to insulin. The average reduction in blood glucose levels 30 minutes after insulin administration in all groups treated with the test compounds showed only minor differences compared to the control group (  Table 4 3.2 Docking studies Considering that biological studies have identified a promising hypoglycemic agent—namely, 1,2,2-trimethyl-3-(3-methyl-2-oxo-2 H c Docking was carried out using the CB-Dock service ( 89 90  Table 5 Table 5 The results of the docking study.

The highest affinity was observed for 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (PDB ID: 2BEL), with an AutoDock Vina score of –10.6 kcal/mol. To better understand the interaction patterns between compound 18 and the molecular targets, docking results were visualized, allowing identification of the specific amino acid residues involved in ligand binding and the nature of these interactions (  Table 6 Table 6 The nature of amino acid moieties involved in formation of molecular target-ligand complex and nature of interactions.

This type of interaction is known to contribute significantly to the strength and stability of ligand binding. Among these, the complex formed between compound 18 and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (PDB ID: 2BEL) stands out. It features three conventional hydrogen bonds involving the carboxyl group of the ligand and amino acid residues ILE46(B), GLY47(B), and ASN119(B), suggesting a particularly strong and specific interaction (  Figure 2 91 Figure 2 Visualization of docking study of compound 18 toward 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (PDB ID: 2BEL).

Interaction types include van der Waals (green), conventional hydrogen bonds (green dotted lines), carbon hydrogen bonds (gray), pi-sigma (purple), and pi-alkyl (pink). 4 Discussion The findings of this study support the growing body of evidence that emphasizes the need for novel hypoglycemic agents with multi-target pharmacological properties ( 92 94 Particular attention should be paid to metformin, a biguanide that remains the cornerstone of T2DM pharmacotherapy ( 95 97 98 100 101 102 103 105 An emerging area of interest in diabetes research is the role of gut microbiota ( 106 107 108 111 112 114 Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of patients with T2DM to infectious diseases ( 115 117 118 121 122 125 126 128 Genetic variability also plays a substantial role in the heterogeneity of T2DM presentation and treatment response ( 129 131 132 137 138 140 141 143 Importantly, T2DM rarely occurs in isolation and is often accompanied by multiple comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder ( 144 146 147 150 Taken together, our results suggest that [1,2,4]triazino[2,3-c]quinazoline derivatives represent a promising chemical class for the development of novel hypoglycemic drugs. However, the complexity of T2DM requires an interdisciplinary approach that includes not only pharmacology, but also microbiology, genetics, immunology, and psychosomatic medicine ( 151 153 154 156 157 160 in vitro in vivo 161 163 164 167 168 170 5 Conclusions Substituted and condensed [1,2,4]triazino[2,3- c H c H c H c c Data availability statement The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.
