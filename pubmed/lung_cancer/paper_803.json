This investigation focused on characterizing these relationships in both Chinese and non-Chinese patients to further refine the dosing regimen for trilaciclib in Chinese patients with ES-SCLC. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) and exposure–response (E–R) analyses were conducted using pooled data from four randomized phase 2/3 trials involving Chinese and non-Chinese patients with ES-SCLC. PopPK analysis revealed that trilaciclib clearance in Chinese patients was approximately 17% higher than that in non-Chinese patients with ES-SCLC. Sex and body surface area influenced trilaciclib pharmacokinetics in both populations but did not exert a significant clinical impact. E–R analysis demonstrated that trilaciclib exposure increased with a dosage escalation from 200 to 280 mg/m 2 2 Keywords trilaciclib small cell lung carcinoma pharmacokinetics population characteristics dose–response relationship ethnicity pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Pharmacological Society 2024 ",
