Summary Background Cognitive decline (CD) is an age-related process exacerbated by metabolic syndrome (MetS), which may be mitigated by lifestyle interventions. Plasma biomarkers hold promise for early CD detection, but prospective evidence is limited. Therefore, we aimed to prospectively determine associations between peripheral neurology-related proteins and CD, and to assess whether the lifestyle intervention of the PREDIMED-Plus trial could modify these associations. Methods A 6-year observational study including 314 PREDIMED-Plus participants with overweight/obesity and MetS (mean age: 65 years, 44% women) were randomised to an intensive weight-loss intervention or a control group. At baseline and 3-year follow-up, plasma neurological and inflammatory proteins were quantified using proximity extension assay (OLINK neurology panel, n = 92), ELISA (C-reactive protein, amyloid-beta 40, phosphorylated tau 231 and adiponectin, n = 4) and Luminex (interleukin-6, n = 1). Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 years. Elastic net regression identified proteins predictive of four cognitive domains, and protein composite scores of cognitive function were generated. Linear-mixed models assessed their associations with 6-year CD and tested for interactions with intervention. Findings Distinct baseline protein composite scores, including 18, 18, 16, and 17 proteins, were identified for global cognitive function (GCF), attention, executive function, and general cognitive function (GenCF), respectively. Of these, seven proteins (RSPO1, CD200, EDA2R, VWC2, GDNF, CD38, and ADAM23) were consistently associated across all cognitive domains. Protein composite scores of GCF and GenCF were significantly associated with 6-year CD, with PREDIMED-Plus interventions modulating these associations only for changes in GCF ( P Interpretation This study identified protein signatures that are associated with CD and observed that a weight loss, energy-reduced Mediterranean diet, and physical activity may influence the relationship between these protein signatures and cognitive outcomes in older adults with MetS. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and clarify causal relationships.

Several studies have reported significant cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers—such as phosphorylated tau and amyloid-beta—and Alzheimer's disease (AD), or dementia, suggesting that these biomarkers may reflect underlying pathological processes and serve as potential indicators of early disease stages of AD or dementia. Over the past two years, plasma proteomic signatures associated with dementia and AD have been reported; however, evidence specifically focusing on cognitive function remains limited. Many candidate plasma biomarkers have primarily been studied in vitro in vivo Added value of this study The PREDIMED-Plus cohort comprised of 6874 community-dwelling older adults with overweight/obesity and metabolic syndrome at enrolment. In this sub-study, we focused on 314 randomly selected participants who were free of dementia or mild cognitive impairment at baseline. These participants had available plasma proteomic data at baseline and three years of follow-up, as well as cognitive data at baseline, and at the 2, 4, and 6-year follow-up assessments. Concretely, distinct baseline plasma neurology and inflammatory protein signatures of cognitive performance were associated with a 6-year global cognitive decline or a decline in some cognitive domains. Notably, this is the first study to show that an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and physical activity intervention aimed at weight loss, significantly modulated the association between the protein signatures identified and the global cognitive decline over time. Implications of all the available evidence Based on our findings, further studies are needed to replicate these findings in broader populations and confirm the proteomic signatures' relevance in predicting cognitive decline or dementia. To explore the molecular mechanisms by which the lifestyle intervention with energy-reduced Mediterranean diet and physical activity mitigates the associations between the identified proteomic signature and cognitive decline requires further research. Introduction Cognitive decline (CD) is an age-related process associated with several neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, whose development can be exacerbated by the presence of metabolic comorbidities. 1 2 Nowadays, proteomics has emerged as an important tool for studying early biomarkers of disease and prognosis, providing crucial insights into their underlying molecular mechanisms. 3 4 In the last years, the levels of some blood proteins have been related to cognitive function or decline in different populations. 5 6 7 8 9 , 10 11 12 13 Therefore, the present study aimed to identify potential peripheral protein biomarkers of an elevated risk of CD and test whether a healthy lifestyle intervention aimed at weight loss can mitigate the deleterious effect on CD. Methods Study sample This study presents a prospective analysis conducted over a 6-year follow-up period within a subset of participants from the PREDIMED-Plus trial framework. Concisely, PREDIMED-Plus is a multi-centre, randomised, parallel-group trial, aimed at assessing the long-term effects of an intensive lifestyle intervention with an energy-reduced Mediterranean diet (erMedDiet) and physical activity, on cardiovascular disease and mortality. 14 15 ad libitum 14 For the present longitudinal study, we included a sub-sample of 314 participants with overweight (n = 68; 6-year weight loss, mean [SD]: −1·14 [2·97] kg) or obesity (n = 246; 6-year weight loss, mean [SD]: −2·68 [4·27] kg) and without mild cognitive impairment or dementia at baseline from the PREDIMED-Plus Reus centre. The selection criteria were based on older adults with overweight/obesity and MetS, with available cognitive performance data at baseline and over 6 years of follow-up, and proteomic data at baseline and 3 years of follow-up. Of these, 260 participants had cognitive performance assessments available at all follow-up time points ( Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 1 Participants' study flow-chart 2 Fig. 2 Overview of study design, proteomic profile and analytic approaches. www.BioRender.com Ethics The protocol received approval from the Institutional Review Boards at all study locations and is available at www.predimedplus.com/en/ www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN89898870 Exposure Fasting blood samples were collected at baseline and 3 years of intervention. Following centrifugation, serum and plasma aliquots were stored at −80 °C until required for biochemical analyses. Proteomic profiling was conducted to quantify neurology-related protein biomarkers in plasma collected at baseline and after a 3-year follow-up period using different analytical technologies ( Fig. 2 2 Plasma concentrations of p-tau231, Aβ40, high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), and adiponectin were measured using a sandwich ELISA. The Human p-tau231 and the Human Aβ40 ELISA Kits (FineTest®, Wuhan, China, cat # EH5058 and # EH2684) were used for p-tau231 and Aβ40 quantification, respectively. Hs-CRP and adiponectin levels were assessed using the ELISA Kits (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, cat # RAB0096 and # EZHADP-61K/EZHADP-61BK). Interleukin-6 levels were assessed using the Luminex immune assay (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, cat # HCYIL6-MAG) following the manufacturer's protocol.

Covariates Sociodemographic and lifestyle data were collected using questionnaires administered by trained staff in face-to-face interviews. The information gathered included age, sex (self-reported), education level, civil status, and smoking status. Additionally, Spanish-validated questionnaires were administered to assess physical activity, energy intake and adherence to a 17-item erMedDiet score. 18 19 20 21 Statistics Primary analyses followed an intention-to-treat principle, with missing longitudinal data for individual cognitive scores, erMedDiet, BMI and physical activity imputed via multivariate imputation by chained equations (ten imputations per missing value). Sensitivity analyses were conducted on participants with complete cognitive data through follow-up. To mitigate multicollinearity, Gaussian linear regression with an elastic net penalty was employed to build models of plasma proteomic profiles for each cognitive domain. A 10-fold cross-validation (CV) approach was implemented using the PREDIMED-Plus baseline data as the discovery population. First, we trained the model by dividing the discovery population into 10 training-test sets (90-10%, respectively) and performing a 10-fold CV to identify the optimal tuning hyperparameters. The regularisation parameter (λ) was determined by contrasting the value that minimised mean squared error (lambda.min) with the more conservative selection under the one-standard-error rule (lambda.1se). Concurrently, the mixing parameter (α) was varied from 0 (pure Ridge) to 1 (pure Lasso) in increments of 0·1. The optimal prediction accuracy in the test sets was obtained with α = 0·3 for GCF, α = 1 for GenCF, α = 0·2 for Att, and α = 0·4 for ExF. After tuning parameters, a 10-fold CV was performed again using the discovery population. From each fold, nonzero protein coefficients were extracted, and only those selected in all ten iterations were retained; their mean coefficients were then used to compute domain-specific protein composite scores. Model performance in the discovery phase was assessed by averaging the Pearson correlation between observed cognitive scores and the protein-based composite scores across folds. For internal validation, these baseline-derived regression protein coefficients were applied to Year 3 proteomic data in the same 314 participants, and the resulting predicted scores were correlated with Year 4 cognitive z-scores. Reported correlation values represent the mean across CV folds for both discovery and validation populations; P Enrichment of elastic net regression-selected proteins for GCF was tested by Fisher's exact test with false discovery rate ( FDR Linear mixed-effects (LMM) models were used to evaluate the association between baseline protein composite scores and longitudinal 6-year changes in cognitive performance. Random slopes for the time were included, with each patient modelled as a random intercept. In all analyses, time was treated as a categorical variable, with each visit represented by an indicator variable. Robust variance estimators (sandwich estimators) were applied to address heteroskedasticity when appropriate. Multivariable models were adjusted for baseline age (years), sex (male/female), educational level (low, secondary, high), time, study arm (control/intervention), smoking status (current, former, never), physical activity (MET-min/week, time-varying), BMI (kg/m 2 To assess longitudinal associations between each baseline protein and cognitive performance, the same methodology was consistently applied. Potential effect modification by age, sex, educational level, and PREDIMED-Plus study arm was assessed by introducing interaction terms into the fully adjusted models. These terms accounted for the covariate and protein composite scores corresponding to each outcome.

In this sub-study, we identified different baseline protein composite scores related to 6-year changes in GCF and other cognitive domains. Indeed, the results of the internal validation suggest that all four protein composite scores capture a biologically meaningful signal and that the same protein composite scores predict multiple domains of cognitive function 3 years after the baseline assessment. Seven of these identified proteins were associated with changes across all the cognitive domains, suggesting that they may play an important role in the pathophysiology of CD and could be considered potential targets for interventions. Moreover, our findings suggest that lifestyle intervention can modulate the association between the GCF protein composite score and CD, highlighting its potential role in mitigating CD. Despite significant advances in understanding the roles of cognitive-related proteins in dementia, prior research has predominantly focused on single-protein analyses, 22 3 23 24 25 26 , 27 28 8 In contrast, a subset of proteins within the GCF signature (NTRK3, RGMB, MME, MSTN, GDNF, ADAM23, and CD38) were linked with higher cognitive performance, suggesting potential neuroprotective roles. Enrichment analysis indicated that NTRK3, GDNF, and CD38 protein network is related to the calcium signalling pathway. In the brain, increases in postsynaptic calcium trigger cascades of signalling events that are essential for neuronal integrity. 29 30 31 32 , 33 In our study, seven proteins were consistently associated with cognitive function across all cognitive domains. Of these, RSPO1, EDA2R, VWC2, and CD200 were associated with lower cognitive performance. The RSPO1, a Wnt signalling regulator, is expressed in the CNS during embryonic development, and its upregulation has been linked to dementia, and negatively correlated with cognitive performance. 34 , 35 36 , 37 38 8 36 , 39 40 28 41 42 Three overlapping proteins—GDNF, CD38, and ADAM23—were positively associated with cognitive performance across all cognitive domains. GDNF, expressed in neurons and astrocytes, 43 44 45 46 47 , 48 49 50 51 52 8 53 Altogether, our findings align with associations previously reported between some of these proteins and CD or dementia. However, the absence of a consistent directional pattern across certain proteins suggests that their influence on cognitive function may be context-specific. Interestingly, although MAPT and APP, recognised biomarkers of AD, 54 As an interaction for intervention arm was found between the GCF protein composite score and changes in cognitive performance, associations were explored individually for each treatment group. Notably, this association was significant in the CG, while the association with CD was mitigated in those participants of the IIG. These findings support the hypothesis that lifestyle interventions might influence the association between the protein composite score of GCF and CD in older adults with overweight/obesity and MetS, although the mechanisms implicated are largely unknown. Weight loss induced by an erMedDiet and physical activity has been shown to benefit neuroimmune regulation, inflammation, and insulin sensitivity at both peripheral and brain levels, potentially improving cognitive performance. 12 , 55 56 57 55 , 58 11 56 , 59 This study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, as an observational study, it is subject to potential reverse causality and residual confounding, preventing the establishment of cause-and-effect relationships. Second, as the study population consisted of older, individuals with overweight/obesity and MetS at high cardiometabolic risk, the findings may not be generalisable to the broader population. Third, while our sample size afforded adequate power to detect moderate-to-large interactions (Cohen's d d Our study also has the following strengths: (1) it was built on a large, successful 6-year RCT, which provided a unique setting to address our research questions because of its well-characterised study population with overweight/obesity and MetS, high compliance to the interventions, and low rates of dropout; (2) rigorous control of multiple potential confounders; (3) the use of extensive sensitivity and stratified analyses; and (4) the simultaneous measurement of inflammatory and neurology proteins. In conclusion, we identified a baseline protein composite score associated with GCF decline in older adults with overweight/obesity and MetS. These proteins are potentially involved in the mechanisms underlying CD and warrant further investigation as possible targets for future interventions. In addition, we documented for the first time that a weight-loss lifestyle intervention with an erMedDiet and physical activity promotion, can modulate the association between the baseline cognitive protein composite score and 6-year changes in cognitive function, highlighting the potential role of this type of intervention in mitigating the deleterious effect that this proteomic signature may have on CD. Future studies are warranted to replicate these results in larger and more diverse populations. Furthermore, longitudinal studies with repeated and more extended protein determinations will be particularly valuable to unravel causal pathways and track the temporal dynamics of these proteins in relation to CD. From a mechanistic perspective, integrating proteomics with other omics platforms—such as genomics, metabolomics, and transcriptomics—alongside neuroimaging and functional assays could provide deeper insight into how these proteins could influence brain health.
