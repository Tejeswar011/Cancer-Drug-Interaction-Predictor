However, the clinical values of probable RS remain unclear. Therefore, we conducted a longitudinal study to determine its impacts on short- and long-term all-cause mortality. Our data were extracted from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. A total of 5,006 participants were selected as a cohort in 2011, and followed up until 2020. According to the JWGRS, probable RS was defined as a coexistence of low respiratory muscle strength and low appendicular skeletal muscles (ASM) mass. Hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality were calculated through Cox regression analyses. After an average of 9 years of follow up, 1,176 of the 5,006 participants (23.49%) died. Cox proportional hazard regression showed that low ASM mass (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.09–1.41, P < 0.001), low respiratory muscle strength (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.11–1.54, P = 0.001), and probable RS (HR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.15–1.48, P < 0.001) were associated with increased all-cause mortality. However, when the follow-up period was shortened to 2 years, the association between probable RS and all-cause mortality became non-significant (P = 0.246), although it remained significant for respiratory-related mortality (HR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.39–7.18, P = 0.006). Diagnosing probable RS and leading to intervention could significantly prevent and reduce the burden of long-term all-cause mortality.

CHARLS is a prospective cohort initiated in 2011 recruiting socially and geographically representative Chinese adults aged ≥ 45 from 450 villages, 150 counties, and 28 provinces. A total of 17,705 adults were examined at baseline, and subsequently followed up every 2 or 3 years. The content of the examination involving demographic information, health status and functioning, health care and insurance, work retirement and pension, anthropometric measurements, and so on. Detailed information on the CHARLS has been reported in previous literature 10 Up to now, a total of 5 waves of data have been released by the CHARLS project (wave 1, 2011y; wave 2, 2013y; wave 3, 2015y; wave 4, 2018y; wave 5, 2020y). Participants with the following criteria were excluded: (1) missing age or age < 60 in wave 1; (2) lack of key data such as gender, weight, height, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) or covariates in wave 1; (3) not participating in any follow-up from wave 2 to wave 5. Finally, a total of 5,006 community-dwelling Chinese adults aged ≥ 60 were chosen as a cohort for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality analyses. The detailed screening process is presented in Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Flowchart of the sample selection process. Assessment of probable respiratory sarcopenia According to the JWGRS, probable RS was defined as the presence of low respiratory muscle strength plus low ASM mass. In our study, PEFR was used to indicate low respiratory muscle strength, with a cut-off set at < 80% of the predicted value 11 12 13 15  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{ASM}} = 0.{\\text{193}} \\times {\\text{weight }}\\left( {{\\text{kg}}} \\right) + 0.{\\text{1}}0{\\text{7}} \\times {\\text{ height }}\\left( {{\\text{cm}}} \\right) - {\\text{4}}.{\\text{157}} \\times {\\text{gender}} - 0.0{\\text{37}} \\times {\\text{age }}\\left( {{\\text{years}}} \\right) - {\\text{2}}.{\\text{631}}$$\\end{document} where sex was set to 1 for men, 2 for women. According to the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) 2019, low ASM mass for men and women were < 7.0 kg/m 2 2 16 Outcome definition In this study, the primary outcome was all-cause mortality, assessed during both the 2-year and 9-year follow-up periods. Cause-specific mortality, as a secondary outcome, was derived from the 2-year follow-up data and included deaths due to respiratory causes, as well as non-respiratory causes, which were classified into cancers, cardiovascular diseases (further categorized as coronary heart disease and stroke), and other medical causes. Covariates Variables that were mentioned in previous related studies 16 17 18 16 18 Statistical analysis The baseline characteristics of older adults are presented as numbers (percentages) according to the probable RS status. Statistical differences were compared by the chi-square test and Fisher exact test as appropriate. As the specific date and cause of death were only recorded in wave 2, the life table, stratified by ASM mass (low/normal to high), PEFR (low/normal to high), or probable RS status (yes/no) was used to characterize the change tendencies of all-cause mortality over 9 years of follow-up. The log-rank test was used to assess the equality of survival between the low ASM mass/low PEFR/probable RS and normal groups. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to investigate the relationship between low ASM mass/low PEFR/probable RS and all-cause mortality after adjustment for potential confounding factors. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed using Schoenfeld residuals. Subgroup analyses were performed, and P P Results In 2011, a total of 5,006 eligible older adults were included in our study. Among them, 1,450 (28.97%) were diagnosed with probable RS, 1,274 (25.45%) with sarcopenia, and 1,078 (21.53%) with both sarcopenia and probable RS.

After a mean observation time of 9 years, multivariable analyses demonstrated that having probable RS or its components (low ASM mass and low PEFR) were associated with a 31%, 24% and 31% increased risk of all-cause mortality, respectively, in Chinese community-dwelling older adults. However, when the follow-up was reduced to 2 years, the association between probable RS and all-cause mortality was no longer significant, although it remained significant for respiratory-related mortality. These findings suggest that low ASM mass, low PEFR, and probable RS present a gradually accumulating health risk, which does not immediately affect all-cause mortality in the short term but contributes to an increase in long-term mortality. Recently, a meta-analysis conducted by Zhou et al. 19 19 20 21 22 P On the basis of cause-specific mortality analyses, we found that older adults with probable RS were confronted with a three-fold higher risk of respiratory mortality. The mechanisms for the association of probable RS with increased respiratory mortality may be attributed to airway clearance disturbance and decreased ventilatory reserve. Due to respiratory muscle weakness, older adults with probable RS were not only more likely to suffer from shortness of breath, but also unable to clear foreign pathogens, inflammation, secretions, or allergic factors effectively. Both dysfunctions may increase their susceptibility to various respiratory diseases. For example, Okazaki et al. 6 P 23 24 25 26 27 8 28 29 30 32 33 35 36 37 39 The present study has several strengths. First, our sample population was from a nationally representative longitudinal survey for the community-dwelling older adults, which made generalizability of our findings relatively high. Second, this is the first study to prospectively investigate the association of probable RS defined by JWGRS with all-cause mortality after adjustments for multiple confounding factors in Asia. Third, the present study provided new evidence for reducing long-term all-cause mortality through intervention of probable RS in the community-dwelling older adults. The limitations of this study must be acknowledged. First, PEFR was used in our study to represent respiratory muscle strength due to its practicality in large-scale epidemiologic surveys. However, PEFR is influenced not only by respiratory muscle capacity but also by airway patency, underlying pulmonary conditions and participant effort, and may not fully reflect true inspiratory muscle strength (e.g., maximal inspiratory pressure). This limitation should be considered when interpreting our findings. Nevertheless, our stratified analysis showed that the association between probable RS and all-cause mortality remained consistent regardless of chronic lung disease status, suggesting that the predictive validity of PEFR in this context may be robust. Second, ASM mass was estimated using an anthropometric equation rather than directly measured by DXA. Although the predictive formula by Wen et al. 40 41 42 S5 Conclusions In conclusion, our findings suggest that probable RS significantly increases the risk of long-term all-cause mortality, likely due to respiratory-related deaths, among community-dwelling older adults in China. These results highlight the need for diagnosing and intervening in probable RS. Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
