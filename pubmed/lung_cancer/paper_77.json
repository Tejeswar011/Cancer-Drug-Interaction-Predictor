However, there is currently no consensus on the management of recurrence after CCRT and durvalumab consolidation therapy. The present study describes the case of a 52-year-old male former smoker with stage IIIB NSCLC who experienced recurrence in the right hilar, mediastinal and bilateral supraclavicular lymph nodes after an initial response to CCRT and durvalumab. A treatment regimen involving combined durvalumab, tremelimumab, cisplatin and pemetrexed achieved stable disease and was continued as maintenance therapy. However, the patient later developed brain and bone metastases, indicating progressive disease. This case highlights the challenges of managing recurrent NSCLC after CCRT and durvalumab consolidation therapy. Combining immunotherapy and chemotherapy may offer a viable approach, underscoring the need for further research and standardized protocols. chemoradiotherapy durvalumab immunotherapy NSCLC recurrence tremelimumab Funding: pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, and treatment strategies vary depending on the stage of disease and patient performance status. For patients with locally advanced NSCLC who have a good performance status, concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment, combining systemic chemotherapy with thoracic radiotherapy to enhance local control and improve survival outcomes ( 1 2 3 4 Case report A 52-year-old man with a 20-pack-year smoking history presented to Toranomon Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) in April 2023 with an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level of 17.8 ng/ml (day 0). Chest computed tomography revealed a 23 mm irregular mass in the left upper lobe hilum, with lymphadenopathy in the left hilar and mediastinal regions ( Fig. 1A-D 18 18 18 Fig. 1E-G Fig. 1H 3 Fig. 1I Fig. 1J-M 2 2 Fig. 2C 5 6 5 7 9 During the initial concurrent chemoradiotherapy, no significant adverse events were observed. On day 92, maintenance therapy with durvalumab (10 mg/kg, every 2 weeks) was started. After 5 cycles of durvalumab maintenance therapy, the follow-up chest CT revealed mild radiation pneumonitis around the lesions, which did not require treatment. In addition, a reduction in the size of the primary tumor and left hilar lymph node metastases was observed ( Fig. 2D 18 Fig. 2E On day 217, the treatment regimen was adjusted to include durvalumab (1,500 mg), tremelimumab (75 mg, every 3 weeks), CDDP (75 mg/m 2 2 10 2 6 Fig. 2F Maintenance therapy was administered for 5 cycles. On day 477, a 6-mm brain metastasis developed in the left cerebellum ( Fig. 3B 18 Fig. 3B From day 561, the patient received combination therapy with CBDCA (AUC 6, every 3 weeks) plus nab-PTX (100 mg/m 2 Fig. 3C Fig. 3C Fig. 3D 11 12 Discussion This case demonstrates the potential of combining durvalumab, tremelimumab, and chemotherapy to treat NSCLC recurrence during durvalumab consolidation therapy after CCRT. A five-year follow-up study from the PACIFIC trial reported a median overall survival (OS) of 47.5 months for patients receiving durvalumab after CCRT compared to 29.1 months in the placebo group ( 13 A retrospective analysis of 15 Japanese institutions examined patients with locally advanced or unresectable NSCLC who experienced disease progression after CCRT and durvalumab consolidation therapy. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: early discontinuation (progression within 6 months of durvalumab initiation), late discontinuation (progression between 7 and 12 months after durvalumab initiation), and accomplishment (progression after 12 months of durvalumab initiation) ( 14 Previous research showed that patients with metastatic melanoma who progressed after PD-L1 therapy benefited more from a combination of PD-L1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) treatments than from CTLA-4 monotherapy, showing an objectively higher response rate (31% vs. 13%; P<0.0001) and longer median OS (20.4 vs. 8.8 months; hazard ratio 0.50; P<0.0001) ( 15 16 The phase III POSEIDON trial evaluated first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC by comparing a regimen of durvalumab, tremelimumab, and chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone. This combination significantly improved the progression-free survival and OS of patients ( 6 17 However, none of these studies included patients with recurrence after concurrent chemoradiotherapy or durvalumab consolidation. Our case differs in this regard, as the patient experienced disease progression during durvalumab consolidation following CCRT, a clinical context not evaluated in either study. Although informative, these findings may not be directly applicable to post-CCRT recurrence. Furthermore, although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy such as bevacizumab is an established option for advanced NSCLC, its administration following stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is associated with a markedly increased risk of pulmonary hemorrhage ( 18 In our patient, the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy, including durvalumab, was beneficial for treating NSCLC recurrence during durvalumab maintenance after CCRT. Given the absence of driver mutations and negative PD-L1 expression at the initial diagnosis, this combination was selected to enhance efficacy by targeting different immune checkpoints with durvalumab and tremelimumab. Further accumulation of cases is recommended to strengthen these findings, and additional clinical experience is essential to validate the effectiveness of this treatment strategy in a broader patient population.
