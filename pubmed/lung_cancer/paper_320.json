Blood flow was measured by Laser Doppler imaging before artery ligation (pre-FAL), immediately after ligation (post-FAL), and 14 days after ligation (FAL-14D) ( Fig. 1A Fig. 1A Fig. 1B Fig. 1B Fig. 1C 19 Fig. 1. scRNA-seq analysis reveals the cell landscape in murine limb tissue after FAL.

OSM cytokines exert activity via the signal transducers gp130, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor, and OSM receptor, leading to the downstream activation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades ( 34 Fig. 4P + + + Fig. 4P Fig. 4Q 34 35 Fig. 4R Therefore, macrophages, especially M2 and TREM2 hi + OSM blockade impedes ischemic tissue regeneration in murine ligated hindlimbs To determine whether activation of the OSM signaling pathway plays a role in the repair of ischemic hindlimbs, we inactivated OSM signaling in murine muscle by infection with adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)–OSM or AAV9-negative control (NC) and subsequently performed the ligation. Two weeks later, confocal imaging analysis showed successful infection of the gastrocnemius by AAV9-NC and AAV9-OSM (fig. S8A). Flow cytometry analysis showed that OSM expression in the AAV9-OSM group was significantly reduced compared with that in the AAV9-NC group (fig. S8B). The recovery of blood perfusion was significantly reduced in AAV9-OSM–treated FAL-14D animals ( Fig. 5A Fig. 5B Fig. 5, C and D Fig. 5, E to J Fig. 5.

As the control, biopsies were obtained from a patient without any evidence of PAD who was undergoing amputation after a traffic accident. After digested with enzymes and filtered to remove muscle fibers, single live nucleated cells were sorted by FACS for subsequent scRNA-seq (fig. S10, A and B, and table S1). Our data revealed cellular diversity in human ischemic skeletal muscle, identifying a total of 17 cell clusters attributed to putative biological identities based on DEGs ( Fig. 7A Fig. 7B Fig. 7C − − + + Fig. 7, C and D − + Fig. 7D Fig. 7. scRNA-seq analysis confirms the OSM–ANGPTL signaling axis in human lower limb ischemic tissues.

The fibroblasts were divided into five subclusters: Fibro_ECM, Fibro_Adhesion, Fibro_APC, Fibro_SCX, and Fibro_Pro-regen ( Fig. 7L CXCL14 + PTN IGF1 SFRP1 Fig. 7M IGF2 HGF FN1 IGF1, SERPINE1 SERPINE2 COL1A1 PCOlCE2 CXCL14 + + + + As the main recipient of OSM signals, the proregenerative fibroblasts increased substantially with ischemia (28.2% in Ctrl and 54.3% in PAD; Fig. 7, N to P Fig. 7Q Fig. 7, R and S The OSM signaling pathway is markedly enhanced in human ischemic/regenerative tissues To provide additional support for the role of OSM-mediated fibroblast-macrophage interactions in ischemic tissue repair, we obtained human skeletal muscle samples from eight patients after lower limb amputation because of critical ischemia. The characteristics of the patients and muscle samples were provided in table S8. Samples were collected from two different regions of each amputee on the basis of computed tomography angiography and muscle color and integrity ( Fig. 8A Fig. 8.

We only obtained human skeletal muscle samples from eight patients after lower limb amputation because of critical ischemia. The sample number was relatively low. In addition, the clinical feasibility and effectiveness of targeting OSM-ANGPTL signaling axis to promote the revascularization of ischemic lower limbs remain to be explored. In addition, we only got these male samples for the present human study, which may be consistent with the trend of epidemiology of PAD.

M2021245). Human ischemic skeletal muscle samples were obtained from eight patients who underwent elective lower extremity amputation at Peking University Third Hospital (China). Characteristics of the patients and muscle samples were provided in table S8. Three patients suffered from chronic limb ischemia, defined as ischemia resulting in either long-lasting rest pain (>2 weeks) and/or tissue loss. Five patients had acute lower limb ischemia because of either an embolism or major thrombosis with occlusive atherosclerosis. Samples were collected from two different regions of each amputee: One sample was collected from a region that macroscopically represented the healthiest part of the amputee (proximal), and the other one was chosen from a region that showed more profound ischemia on the basis of the color and integrity of muscle (distal). In the samples used for scRNA-seq, the control group was from the amputation biopsy of a patient involved in a traffic accident who had no evidence of peripheral arterial occlusive diseases. Ischemic skeletal muscle samples were obtained from a patient undergoing amputation due to severe lower limb ischemia. All clinical individuals were confirmed in advance to lack major organ diseases or exclusion criteria, such as liver failure, dialysis, cancer, chemotherapy, and pregnancy. The study participants were approached by vascular surgery staff, and informed consent was obtained. Animals All animal procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University Health Science Center in accordance with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, International Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) guidelines. CTR and DTR mice were generously provided by Q. Xu from School of Medicine, Zhejiang University. The generation of these two mouse strains has been described previously ( 18 HLI model Animals were intubated and anesthetized with inhaled 2.5% isoflurane. Then, each animal was placed in the supine position on the preoperating table. Hair removal cream was applied to thoroughly remove the hair from the hindlimb. Using aseptic technique, the femoral artery was located, and the neurovascular bundle was exposed. Then, the vessels (artery and vein) were separated from the nerve. The distal external iliac and distal femoral arteries and veins were sutured using a 7.0 nonabsorbable polypropylene, and the segments of the iliofemoral artery and vein between the distal and proximal knots were transected with spring scissors. After the incision was closed with an absorbable suture, the animal was placed on a heated pad and monitored continuously until awake. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging Noninvasive measurements of hindlimb perfusion were obtained by scanning before and 30 min and 14 days after ligation using a Laser Doppler perfusion imager (PeriScan PIM3 System, Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden). Animals were anesthetized with inhaled 2.5% isoflurane, and the hair was removed with depilatory cream. Serial scanning of surface blood flow was performed on hindlimbs. A color-coded image denoting a specific relative perfusion level was displayed on a video monitor; poor or no perfusion was displayed as blue, and the highest perfusion level was displayed as red. All images were evaluated with LDPIwin 3.1 software (PeriScan PIM3 System, Perimed). To account for variables such as temperature and ambient light, blood perfusion is expressed as the ratio of ischemic to nonischemic limbs. The mice were placed on a 37°C heating pad to reduce heat loss during measurements ( 54 Immunofluorescence staining The amputated muscles from the participants and the mouse gastrocnemius muscles were retrieved, fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde, embedded in optimal cutting temperature (O.C.T) water-soluble blend of glycols and resins , frozen, and cut into 7-μm sections at −22°C. Cross sections were fixed in precooled acetone and blocked for 1 h at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Sections were incubated with primary antibody at 4°C overnight, washed in PBS, and then incubated for 1 hour in blocking buffer with the appropriate secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Abcam, ab104139). The following primary and secondary antibodies were used: Laminin (Sigma-Aldrich, L9393), F4/80–fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Abcam, ab60343), PDGFRα-allophycocyanin (APC) (Invitrogen, 11-1401-82), CD34–phycoerythrin (PE) (Invitrogen, RM3604), CD34 (Abcam, ab81289), tdTomato (Rockland, 600-401-379), VIM–Alexa Fluor 488 (Abcam, ab185030), VIM–Alexa Fluor 594 (Abcam, ab154207), DLK1 (ABclonal, A2715), Tmem119 (Proteintech, 27585-1-AP), ANGPTL2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-393747), CD31 (Abcam, ab222783), CD31 (Abcam, ab9498), CD31-APC (BD Biosciences, 551262), integrin α 5 1 5 1 To further preliminarily evaluate the spatial relations (that is colocalization) among different fluorescence channels, we used the ImageJ tool Plot Profile to create a plot of fluorescence intensity values in a boxed region drawn on the image. The higher overlap degree of different fluorescence intensity values means the higher colocation degree. BM transplantation BM cells were collected from the cavities of the femur and tibia in donor mice, separated into a single-cell suspension by passage through a 40-μm cell filter (Falcon, 352340), and then resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) before transplantation (American Type Culture Collection, 30-2002). Recipient mice received total body irradiation of 9.0 gray for 6 hours. Recipients were injected through the tail vein with a suspension containing 5 × 10 6 Muscle-infiltrating single-cell suspensions Mouse tissues Hindlimb gastrocnemius muscles were removed at 14 days after FAL or sham operation (10 mice per group). A single-cell suspension was prepared from hindlimb muscles by mechanical and enzymatic dissociation as previously described ( 19 g Human tissues Human muscle tissues were stored in prechilled PBS. A single-cell suspension was prepared from lower limb muscles by mechanical and enzymatic dissociation as previously described ( 55 g Flow cytometric analysis Isolated single cells from an amputated muscle in a patient or from the mouse gastrocnemius (with muscle fiber fragments removed) were suspended in PBS. For the staining of certain cells, the cells were incubated with conjugated antibodies (1 μm per 10 6 After the unbound antibodies were washed away, the cells were analyzed using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). scRNA-seq and data processing Both male and female C57BL/6 J and Cd34 T2 + − + For further analyses and visualization, the R package Seurat (version 3.2.2) was used ( 56 P adjusted We performed scRNA-seq of the human samples from the Ctrl and patients with PAD separately. A single-cell suspension was obtained from each group using the above method. Subsequent experiments, including scRNA-seq and data processing, were the same as described for the mouse samples. Focused analysis of specific cell clusters In the mouse dataset, fibroblasts and macrophages were extracted by “subsets,” and unbiased clustering was performed again with a resolution of 0.3 or 0.2, respectively. To improve the accuracy of naming the subclusters, clusters with an average of fewer than 15 cells per group were removed. In the human dataset, fibroblasts and monocytes/macrophages were extracted by subsets, and unbiased clustering was performed again with a resolution of 0.2 or 0.1, respectively. To improve the accuracy of naming the subclusters, clusters with an average number of fewer than 20 cells per group were removed. Cell-cell contact analysis with CellChat Cell-cell contact analysis was performed with the R package CellChat (1.1.3) ( https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat 29 To compare the information flow with each signaling pathway between the Sham and HLI groups, we created CellChat objects using data from two groups merged by “mergeCellChat.” Stacked bar charts were drawn using “rankNet” (mode = “comparison,” STACKED = F, do.stat = TRUE). Cell-cell contact analysis with iTALK The R package iTALK (0.1.0) was also used to investigate cell-cell cross-talk between cell clusters that we identified ( 57 Pseudo-time trajectory analysis Pseudo-time analysis was performed on fibroblast subset lineages from our integrated single-cell data using the R packaged Monocle (version 2.18) ( 58 Enrichment analysis For functional pathway analyses, all cluster-specific markers or DEGs resulting from the “FindMarkers” function in Seurat were used for Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, GO analysis, and GSEA. For the GO and KEGG analyses, a list of genes was imported to the web-based tools Metascape ( https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1 59 https://david.ncifcrf.gov 60 P P Macrophage isolation from the single-cell suspensions Macrophages were isolated from mouse muscle samples and purified by a positive magnetic cell sorting system using mouse anti-F4/80 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-121-301) and a standard procedure. Briefly, a single-cell suspension was prepared from mouse gastrocnemius muscle. Cell pellets were suspended in 90 μl of PBS and 10 μl of Anti-F4/80 MicroBeads UltraPure per 10 7 Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction Total RNA was isolated from single-cell suspensions of mouse muscle samples and biopsies from patients with PAD using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using 5 × All-In-One RT MasterMix (ABM Inc., Vancouver, Canada). RT-PCR amplification was performed using 2 × RealStar Green Power Mixture (GenStar, San Diego, CA, USA), and the results were recorded using the Mx3000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The target mRNA levels were normalized to β-actin mRNA levels. The primer sequences used for RT-PCR are listed in table S10. Western blot analysis Biopsies from patients with PAD were lysed in cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer to extract total protein. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Equal amounts of total protein were resolved by 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against OSM (ABclonal, A6163), OSMR (ABclonal, A6681), and GAPDH (ABclonal, AC033) and then with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated secondary antibodies (ABclonal, AS014). The blots were visualized by an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) after incubation with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, MA, USA). Hematoxylin and eosin staining Muscle samples from humans and mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours and dehydrated overnight in 20% sucrose. The samples were then embedded in paraffin and cut into 6-μm-thick sections. Tissue sections were deparaffinized and hydrated in xylenes and ethanol gradients. These sections were then stained with hematoxylin for 15 min, rinsed in running tap water, and stained with eosin for 3 to 5 min. Last, the slices were dehydrated and sealed with neutral resin. Anti-OSM neutralizing antibodies treatment Both male and female C57BL/6 J mice were used for the experiments. Mice were randomly divided into the anti-OSM antibody group and the isotype antibody group. Mice in each group underwent FAL at 8 weeks old and received an intraperitoneal injection of anti-OSM polyclonal antibody (1 mg/kg; R&D Systems, AF-495-NA) or isotype antibody (normal IgG) (R&D Systems, AB-108-C) on the third day after surgery. AAV9 production and injection To reduce OSM expression in muscle, short hairpin–mediated RNA (shRNA) targeting OSM (Gene ID: 18413) was used. shRNA sequences were ligated into an AAV9 vectors encoding green fluorescent protein. Both male and female C57BL/6J mice were used for the experiments and were randomly divided into the AAV9-OSM group and the AAV9-NC group. AAV9-OSM or AAV9-NC was directly injected into the gastrocnemius muscle of each mouse immediately after FAL using a 29-gauge (0.33-mm) needle connected to an insulin syringe. Each mouse was injected with 2.5 × 10 10 Assessment of limb ischemic damage Mice were examined preoperatively, immediately postoperatively but after recovery from anesthesia, and at 1 and 2 weeks after the induction of HLI. Functional grading was performed according to the modified Tarlov scale to detect less severe levels of ischemia as follows: 0 = autoamputation of leg; 1 = leg necrosis; 2 = foot necrosis; 3 = discoloration of two or more toes; 4 = discoloration of one toe; 5 = discolorations of two or more nails; 6 = discoloration of one nail; and 7 = no necrosis. Statistical analysis scRNA-seq data were analyzed by R packages Seurat, monocle, CellChat, and iTALK. The other data are expressed as the means ± SEM unless otherwise stated. Datasets were compared using unpaired two-tailed Student’s t P Acknowledgments This work was supported by Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Research Center of Future Digital Healthcare and Alibaba Cloud.
