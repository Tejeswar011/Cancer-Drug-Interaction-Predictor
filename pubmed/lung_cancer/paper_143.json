However, there is a lack of information about its survival benefit in these patients. Objective We want to investigate the association of PBT with the overall survival (OS) of sarcoma patients. Methods We used the National Cancer Database and assessed the OS using multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, race, education, income, insurance status, histology, comorbidity score, radiation therapy dose, chemotherapy, surgery, and year of diagnosis. Results Among the 117,694 patients, 3,573 (3%) received PBT. Patients receiving PBT had longer OS than those receiving photon radiation therapy (PRT) (HR: 0.73, CI: 0.68 -0.79). PBT was also associated with improved OS compared to PRT in chordoma (HR: 0.57, CI: 0.44-0.74), rhabdomyosarcoma (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.47- 0.72), or chondrosarcoma (HR: 0.35, CI: 0.24-0.51) patients. Among patients who received surgery, PBT was associated with improved OS compared to PRT in chordoma (HR: 0.37, CI: 0.22-0.60), chondrosarcoma (HR: 0.52, CI: 0.28-0.97), or osteosarcoma (HR: 0.32, CI: 0.12-0.89) patients. Among patients with no surgery, PBT was associated with improved OS compared to PRT in chordoma (HR: 0.57, CI: 0.44-0.74), rhabdomyosarcoma (HR:0.56, CI: 0.44-0.70), chondrosarcoma (HR:0.24, CI: 0.15-0.37), osteosarcoma (HR: 0.51, CI: 0.30- 0.87), or other histology type (HR:0.76, CI: 0.66-0.86) patients. Conclusion The use of PBT was associated with improved OS compared to photon RT in sarcoma patients.

However, clinical evidence is still scarce. The early clinical use of PBT was mostly in pediatric cancers, including sarcomas of the skull base and spine ( 6 8 9 10 11 15 16 21 With the increase in PBT facilities from only two in 2004 to 42 in 2022 in the U.S., the number of cancer patients who received PBT also increased from 1,206 in 20004 to 6,291 in 2022 ( 22 23 23 25 26 Materials and method Data source Data were extracted from the National Cancer Database (NCDB). The NCDB is the largest hospital-based cancer registry in the U.S., representing more than 70% of the cancer cases diagnosed annually. The NCDB is a consortium of more than 1500 accredited cancer hospitals that the American College of Surgeons administers. The analysis included patients diagnosed with sarcoma between 2004 and 2022. Other variables included age at diagnosis (years), insurance types (private, Medicare, Medicaid, other governmental, and no insurance), race, sex, Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index (0, 1, ≥2), year of diagnosis (2004–2013 or 2014–2022), neighborhood education level, median household income, and histology type. International Classification of Disease for Oncology, Third Edition (ICD-O-3) was used to determine sarcoma patients. Major histology types included Chordoma (9370,9371,9372), Rhabdomyosarcoma (8900,8901,8902,8910,8912,8920,8921), Ewing sarcoma ((9260), Chondrosarcoma (9220,9221,9231,9240,9242,9243), and other types that included the remaining histology codes. Patients who received RT dose >80Gy or who were missing RT dose were excluded. The study was exempt from review by the institutional review board as it analyzes de-identified data. Informed consent was also not needed. The flowchart of the study participants is provided in  Figure 1 Figure 1 Flow chart of the study participants. Flowchart illustrating sarcoma patient data from 2004 to 2022. Total patients: 724,974. Exclusions: 607,280, including no RT (516,145), non-proton/photon RT (81,324), dose over 80 Gy (9,706), and missing dose (105). Remaining 117,694 meet criteria: 114,121 received photon RT (97.0%), and 3,573 received proton RT (3.0%). Statistical analysis We reported the frequency and proportion of all the variables by PBT and photon RT. Time trends in the use of PBT were also reported by year of diagnosis. The association of the factors associated with the use of PBT was investigated by performing multivariable logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio was reported as the measure of association with the probability of receiving PBT compared to photon RT. The Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to estimate the median survival time and compute the log-rank test to compare survival time across the PBT and photon RT groups. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to estimate the variable’s HR and 95% CI with a focus on PBT vs. photon RT. SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc), was used to perform analyses. All tests were 2-sided with a significance level being set at P = 0.5. Results Patient characteristics Of the 117,694 study participants, 3,573 (3%) patients received PBT. Among those who received PBT, 391(10.9%) received <45 Gy,1512 (42.3%) 45–60 Gy, and 1670 (46.8%) 60–80 Gy RT dose. The use of PBT increased from 1.3% in 2004 to 11% in 2022. The use of PBT was <1% in patients younger than 18 years and 1.7% in adult patients in 2004 (  Figure 2  Table 1 Figure 2 Time trends in the use of PBT by year in sarcoma patients.

There was not enough sample size for the remaining histology types.

While a higher proportion of patients received chemotherapy in the proton RT group than photon RT 1,577 (44.3%) vs. 31875 (28.2%), the overall results of proton RT vs. photon RT did not change when we stratified by chemotherapy. Proton RT was associated with improved OS than photon RT in patients who received chemotherapy (HR:0.73, 95% CI: 0.66-0.81; p<0.001) and those who did not receive chemotherapy (HR:0.72, 95% CI: 0.64-0.80; p<0.001). We wanted to perform an analysis stratify by histology and neoadjuvant and adjuvant RT. However, there was not enough sample size for the neoadjuvant group. Among the adjuvant RT, the OS results did not change from the general Cox regression model. Discussion The current study is the largest to evaluate PBT’s association with sarcoma patients’ OS in real-world settings. It is the first study to report that sarcoma patients who received PBT had longer OS than those who received photon RT. In the current study, more than 50% of the patients who received PBT were younger than 40 years old. This is important since PBT has been reported to improve normal tissue sparing and to reduce cognitive issues ( 26 In the analysis stratified by histology, the use of PBT was associated with improved OS compared to photon RT only in patients diagnosed with chordoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or chondrosarcoma. Among patients who received surgery, PBT was associated with improved OS in patients diagnosed with chordoma, chondrosarcoma, or osteosarcoma. Among patients who did not receive surgery, the use of PBT was associated with improved OS in patients diagnosed with chordoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and other histology types. When the analysis was restricted to an RT dose of 60–80 Gy, among patients who received surgery, PBT was associated with improved OS compared to photon RT only in patients diagnosed with chordoma. Among those who did not receive surgery, PBT was associated with improved OS compared to photon RT in patients diagnosed with chordoma or chondrosarcoma. The survival findings reported in our study are similar to some other studies of PBT in sarcoma patients. The five-year survival rate of 85% in chordoma patients in the current study, is comparable to the five-year survival rate reported in some published case series ( 27 30 27 30 27 31 32 The three and five-year survival rates of 78% and 71% for rhabdomyosarcoma patients in our study are comparable to 81% and 77% reported in clinical trials ( 33 34 35 34 35 36 The improved OS associated with the use of PBT compared to photon RT in chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients might be due to a higher dose of RT being delivered safely when PBT was used in these patients. Most chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients who received 60–80 Gy were treated with PBT. In chordoma specifically, 90% of PBT-treated patients received 60–80 Gy versus 44.5% in the photon RT cohort. Thus, the apparent overall survival advantage with PBT could reflect dose escalation, as these tumors are relatively radioresistant. Nevertheless, in our study PBT remained associated with improved OS even when analyses were restricted to patients receiving 60–80 Gy. The survival benefit of PBT in chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients was also not driven by the benefit of surgery as PBT was associated with better OS compared to photon RT when the analysis was stratified by surgery. Our study found that, among patients who did not undergo surgery, proton beam therapy (PBT) was associated with improved overall survival across chordoma, chondrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and pooled “other” sarcoma histologies. Ewing sarcoma was the only histology in which PBT was not associated with improved OS, irrespective of surgical status. These results suggest that PBT may confer a survival advantage in the presence of gross disease, including tumors traditionally considered radioresistant. The signal in the non-surgical subgroup is notable given longstanding skepticism about radiotherapy for radioresistant histologies such as osteosarcoma. Although osteosarcoma is generally less responsive to radiation and surgery is preferred when feasible, radiotherapy can improve local control—and potentially survival—for unresectable axial disease or after resections with positive margins ( 4 NCT05691478 An argument could be made that the improved OS associated with the use of PBT may be due to the imbalance between PBT and photon RT reported in  Table 1 The use of PBT increased from 1.4% in 2004 to 12% in 2022. The increase in the use of PBT is due to many reasons, the most important being the increase in the number of PBT facilities in operation ( 37 39 38 39 Pediatric patients were more likely to receive PBT compared to adult sarcoma patients. The higher likelihood could be due to the stronger clinical evidence and a stronger belief in the benefit of the use of PBT in pediatric cancers, including CNS tumors and sarcomas of the skull base and spine ( 6 40 41 The higher odds of using PBT in patients with private insurance compared to Medicare, Medicaid, and no insurance is an indication of the challenge and barriers in accessing advanced treatment techniques in patients without private insurance. Patients with Medicare had the lowest odds of receiving PBT, which may be due to the strict requirements for the approval of PBT. An alternative payment model has been introduced for Medicare recipients, which focuses on reducing Medicare expenditure and overuse of treatment with unproven benefits while preserving the quality of care ( 42 Patients living in an area with ≤$50,353 neighborhood income level were also less likely to receive PBT. Previous studies of non-small cell lung cancer and other cancers have reported similar findings ( 43 45 Despite being the first and largest study of PBT use in sarcoma patients, it has several limitations. Important limitations include the retrospective nature of NCDB, which makes the database prone to errors. Some additional limitations include the lack of information about acute and late toxicity, recurrence, reirradiation, performance status, cause of death, and disease progression. Only 3% of the patients received PBT, which makes this population unique with different characteristics, such as the ability to have access to new and modern treatments at a high cost. Due the different characteristics of the PBT group, the role of different time periods, different age groups, and different dose levels can not be ingored when assessing the impact of PBT on the OS of these patients. Nevertheless, this comprehensive study of the NCDB is the first study to report the survival benefit associated with the receipt of PBT in children and adult sarcoma patients using a large database. Despite a sharp increase in the number of PBT facilities, the use of PBT in sarcoma patients remains low compared to the number of patients who receive photon RT. In conclusion, the use of PBT was associated with improved OS compared to photon RT. In the stratified analysis by histology, the use of PBT was associated with improved OS in patients diagnosed with chordoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or chondrosarcoma. In the subset analysis among patients who received surgery on the tumor, the use of PBT was associated with improved OS in patients diagnosed with Chordoma, chondrosarcoma, or osteosarcoma. In the no-surgery group, only in Ewing sarcoma patients, PBT was not associated with improved OS. When the analysis was stratified by surgery and restricted only to 60–80 Gy, PBT use was associated with improved OS only in chordoma patients who received surgery, while its use was associated with improved OS in chordoma and chondrosarcoma patients who did not receive surgery. Finally, our study revealed that the use of PBT among sarcoma patients has increased, but there is still a large gap between the number of patients who should receive PBT and patients who are receiving PBT. The increase in the number of PBT facilities is a step in the right direction, but much more is needed to adopt a broader use of PBT.
