Background Although neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (nICT) has revolutionized the management of locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the inability to accurately predict pathological complete response (pCR) remains a major barrier to treatment personalization. We aimed to develop and validate an interpretable machine learning (ML) model using pretreatment multimodal features to predict pCR prior to nICT initiation. Methods In this retrospective study, 114 ESCC patients receiving nICT were randomly allocated into training (n=81) and validation (n=33) cohorts (7:3 ratio). Predictors of pCR were identified from pretreatment clinical variables, endoscopic ultrasonography, and hematological biomarkers via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Eight machine learning algorithms were implemented to construct prediction models. Model performance was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) provided feature importance and model interpretability. Results Following feature selection, 17 variables were incorporated into model construction. The Random Forest (RF) model demonstrated perfect discrimination in the training cohort (AUC = 1.000, sensitivity = 1.000, specificity = 1.000, PPV = 1.000, NPV = 1.000), while maintaining robust predictive ability in the independent validation cohort (AUC = 0.913, sensitivity = 0.733, specificity = 0.889, PPV = 0.846, NPV = 0.800). Decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed favorable clinical utility. SHAP analysis identified alcohol consumption, circumferential involvement ≥50%, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as the key contributors to pCR prediction. Conclusions We established a clinically applicable, interpretable ML model that accurately predicts pCR to nICT in ESCC by integrating multimodal pretreatment data. This tool may optimize patient selection for nICT and advance precision therapy paradigms. esophageal squamous cell carcinoma neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy pathological complete response machine learning model interpretability The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Multiple studies confirm that pCR is associated with improved overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Blum MM et al. reported that in the MD Anderson cohort, patients with pCR had significantly longer median OS (71.3 vs. 35.9 months) and RFS (70.8 vs. 26.1 months) compared to non-pCR patients ( 6 7 7 8 Currently, the predictive biomarkers capable of stratifying pCR and assessing survival outcomes for nICT in ESCC remain to be established. Although some biomarkers seem valuable, such as CD8+ T cell infiltration, programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) ( 9 10 11 12 13 Materials and methods Study cohort This retrospective study included 140 consecutive patients with ESCC at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (SYSUCC, Guangzhou, China) between July 1, 2021, and July 1, 2024, who received neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy. The inclusion criteria were defined as follows: (1) histologically confirmed ESCC with clinical staging classified as cT3–4aNanyM0 or cT1–2N+M0; (2)completion of at 1–2 cycles of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy;(3)subsequent esophagectomy following the completion of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. Exclusion criteria comprised: (1) Prior or synchronous malignant tumors (n=3); (2) Patients who received neoadjuvant immunotherapy at external hospitals and lacked baseline laboratory test data (n=23). After screening, a total of 114 eligible ESCC patients were ultimately included, which was randomly divided into a training set (81 patients) and a test set (33 patients) in a 7:3 ratio. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee at Sun-Yat sen University Cancer Center (Guangzhou, China; Approval No: SL-B2025-111-01).The requirement for informed consent was waived by the institutional review board given the retrospective design and complete anonymization of all patient data. Procedures The study design schematic is presented in  Figure 1 Figure 1 Study design flowchart. (A) (B) Flowchart illustrating a study process: Panel A depicts cohort collection, data acquisition, and feature selection with training (70%) and test (30%) sets, endoscopic ultrasound, blood tests, data cleaning, and LASSO analysis. Panel B covers machine learning analysis, model performance comparison, and evaluation, listing algorithms (RF, GBM, MLP, SVM, NN, GP, NB, XGB), using ROC curve, radar chart, confusion matrix, DCA curves, heatmap, and model interpretation. Model development and validation We performed feature selection using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression thereby enhancing prediction accuracy and increasing model stability through elimination of non-predictive features. Eight ML models, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Gaussian Process (GP), Naive Bayes (NB), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) were used to predict the pathological response of nICT in ESCC patients. The final hyperparameters for each prediction model were optimized using the optimal feature subset, employing 5 repetitions of 5-fold cross-validation coupled with the default hyperparameter grid search provided by the “caret” package. Model performance comparison The predictive performance of the models was evaluated using established metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy. The optimal predictive model was selected based on the highest AUC in both training and test sets. Calibration of the optimal model was subsequently validated using calibration curves and quantitatively via the Hosmer-Lemeshow test to evaluate the agreement between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes, whereas decision curve analysis (DCA) was employed to quantify clinical utility by estimating net benefit across a range of threshold probabilities. Model explanation Interpreting ML models remains a complex task. To address the “black box” dilemma, the SHAP framework employs game-theoretic principles to quantify feature significance and elucidate predictive outputs. This approach enables both instance-specific and overall model interpretation by quantifying individual feature contributions to predictions, thereby enhancing transparency and explainability of algorithmic decision-making processes. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were conducted using R (version 4.3.1) and SPSS software (version 18.0). Normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as mean ± SD and compared using Student’s t-test. Non-normally distributed continuous data are reported as median (IQR) with Mann-Whitney U tests. Categorical variables are presented as frequencies (%) and analyzed by chi-square tests. Feature selection employed LASSO regression (R “glmnet” package). Machine learning models were implemented via the “caret” package in R, which provides a unified interface for algorithmic implementation using specified methods: RF (method=“ranger”), GBM (method=“gbm”), MLP (method=“mlp”), SVM (method=“svmRadial”), NN (method=“NN”), GP (method=“gausspr Radial”), NB (method=“native_bayes”), XGB (method=“xgbTree”). Model performance was evaluated by ROC analysis (R “pROC” package). Comparative performance across metrics was visualized using radar plots. The optimal model’s classification results (TP/TN/FP/FN) were displayed in confusion matrices for training and test sets. Clinical utility was assessed via decision curve analysis (DCA) quantifying net benefit across threshold probabilities. Statistical significance was defined as two-tailed P < 0.05. Results Patient characteristics The training set comprised 81 patients (median [IQR] age, 61 [58–66] years; 61 male [79.01%]), including 41 smokers (50.62%) and 22 alcohol consumers ((27.16%). Clinical staging distribution was: stage II (n=7, 8.64%), stage III (n=50, 61.73%), and stage IV (n=24, 29.63%). Following nICT, all patients underwent surgery, with pCR achieved in 36 cases ((44.44%) based on the pathological assessment of the surgical specimens. The test set included 33 patients (median [IQR] age, 64 [58–68] years; 30 males [90.91%]), with 19 smokers (57.58%) and 13 alcohol consumers (39.39%). Stage distribution was: II (n=6, 18.18%), III (n=18, 54.55%), and IV (n=9, 27.27%). The pCR was observed in 15 patients (45.5%).There were no significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics between the training and test sets.

Heatmap analysis of RF model variables A heatmap was constructed to visually characterize the discriminatory capacity of the RF model in predicting pCR following nICT in ESCC patients. The multivariate visualization matrix employed color gradients to depict the spatial distribution of the predictive variables across the ESCC cohort, while simultaneously mapping algorithm-derived pCR probability scores against histologically confirmed treatment outcomes. Differential clustering patterns emerged between pCR and non-pCR cohorts (  Figure 5 Figure 5 Heatmap visualization of variables associated with pathological complete response (pCR) prediction in ESCC patients after nICT using the Random Forest (RF) model.

Model explanation To elucidate the underlying decision-making process of the RF model, we employed the SHAP method for model interpretability. SHAP analysis quantifies the marginal contribution of each feature to the prediction by computing Shapley values, enabling a comprehensive assessment of feature-specific impacts on the model’s output. The SHAP summary dot plot (  Figure 6A  Figure 6B Figure 6 Interpretation of the Random Forest (RF) model for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis.

Panel B displays a bar chart ranking features by mean absolute SHAP value, with alcohol having the highest value.

Beyond global feature importance, we utilized the SHAP plot illustrates the local contributions of individual features to the RF model predictions.  Figure 6C Discussion This study presents a deep learning-derived model for the early prediction of pCR in ESCC patients receiving neoadjuvant immune checkpoint therapy. By integrating clinical indicators, laboratory biomarkers, and endoscopic ultrasonography features, we identified predictive biomarkers and systematically evaluated eight machine learning models for pCR prediction. The random forest algorithm demonstrated superior predictive accuracy across both in the training cohort (AUC 1.000) while maintaining robust performance in the test cohort (AUC 0.913), outperforming traditional clinical indices. Notably, we derived a novel probabilistic scoring system from the RF model that revealed significant differences between pCR and non-pCR groups across all patient strata. This clinically applicable tool provides accurate pCR prediction prior to treatment completion, potentially identifying candidates most likely to benefit from nICT. Such stratification may mitigate overtreatment risks while advancing personalized therapeutic strategies for ESCC. In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a revolutionary oncologic therapy, demonstrating particularly pronounced advantages in neoadjuvant settings for ESCC. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy has transformed ESCC management through immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) administered preoperatively to induce tumor regression, downstage clinical disease, and improve complete resection rates ( 14 15 5 Tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and PD-L1 expression have been investigated as potential biomarkers for immunotherapy response, yet their clinical utility remains controversial ( 16 17 18 19 2 20 21 4 Our study integrated pre-neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy features from ESCC patients, including endoscopic ultrasonography delineating local tumor characteristics, peripheral blood biomarkers reflecting systemic immune status, and clinical parameters capturing baseline host factors. Subsequent multimodal fusion of local-systemic-host data overcomes the spatiotemporal limitations of conventional response assessment methods, with the RF algorithm demonstrating exceptional accuracy in predicting pCR for ESCC patients receiving nICT. SHAP analysis quantified feature contributions to pCR prediction, identifying alcohol, circumferential involvement, high NLR,high CRP and high ALT as the top five predictors. The directional influence and quantitative impact of individual features exhibited dynamic shifts upon their intrinsic values and combinatorial interactions with co-occurring variables, highlighting the demonstrating the model’s complexity in predicting ICI efficacy for each patient. Then, we explored the relationship of these features and ICI efficacy. Firstly, the development of ESCC demonstrates a strong correlation with ethanol intake ( 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Currently, individual research teams have developed models for predicting therapeutic efficacy following neoadjuvant therapy in ESCC patients. However, it is worth noting that all these predictive models primarily rely on the the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1). Since the response patterns of tumors treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) may differ from those of conventional therapies, pseudoprogression and mixed responses can lead to RECIST 1.1 misclassifying such cases as progressive disease (PD) during immunotherapy evaluation. Ultimately, the gold standard for efficacy assessment remains postoperative pathology. Machine learning offers a transformative solution by decoding complex biological patterns through iterative algorithmic learning from multimodal datasets. Unlike rule-based methods, ML frameworks excel at capturing nonlinear relationships and subtle feature interactions—capabilities critical for modeling the heterogeneity of the tumor immune microenvironment. In this study, we innovatively developed a RF model derived scoring system provides clinicians with an objective tool to stratify patients most likely to benefit from nICT. Furthermore, all the predictive factors included in the RF model are routine examination items for ESCC patients during hospitalization and are easily accessible, providing feasibility for the clinical application. Although the developmen of RF model demonstrated robust predictive performance in this study, there are still some limitations. Firstly, the retrospective design may introduce selection bias despite strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, which may limit the generalizability of the prediction model. Secondly, the model was developed using data exclusively from a single Chinese medical center. Although internal validation has confirmed the predictive efficacy of the model, the relatively small sample size and lack of external validation in this study may affect the robustness and broad applicability of the prediction model. Moreover, while Random Forest achieved the highest mean AUC, its apparent advantages over most comparators were not statistically robust to multiple testing correction. This suggests these differences may represent random variations amplified by repeated comparisons. Therefore, this work as a retrospective exploratory analysis, subsequent studies should organize multicenter, prospective large-scale studies involving ESCC patients from various regions and medical institutions aimed at dynamically evaluating the predictive performance of the model in real clinical settings. Additionally, integrating multi-omics data, including genomic, radiomic, and proteomic features, holds promise for improving prediction accuracy by capturing the complex biological mechanisms underlying tumor-immune interactions, ultimately facilitating the development of a more refined and clinically useful immunotherapy prediction model. Conclusion Our study established an interpretable random forest model using baseline endoscopic ultrasonography and hematological parameters that accurately predicts histological response to neoadjuvant immune checkpoint therapy in ESCC patients. Validated across independent cohorts, the model offers a clinically actionable tool for pretreatment identification of responders, thereby optimizing personalized therapeutic strategies while reducing unnecessary healthcare expenditures and mitigating immune-related adverse events through early intervention.
