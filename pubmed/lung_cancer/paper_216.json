Purpose Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of lens epithelial cells (LECs) is a predominant pathological driver for fibrotic cataracts. This study explores the role and mechanism of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC1A), a key mitochondrial regulator, in EMT of LECs. Methods RNA-sequencing analysis was applied to reveal biological changes during human lens epithelial fibrosis. Primary rabbit LECs were treated with TGFβ2 to induce EMT. Mitochondrial alterations were evaluated by MitoTracker staining, transmission electron microscopy, mitochondrial membrane potential assay, ATP content assay, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay. Loss- and gain-of-function studies were performed to uncover roles and mechanisms of PGC1A in EMT of LECs. Changes of PGC1A, EMT markers, and mitochondrial regulators were analyzed by Western blot, immunofluorescence staining, and RT-qPCR. Cell migration was assessed using the cell scratch assay. Ex vivo whole rat lenses were treated with TGFβ2 to induce fibrotic cataract to evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of PGC1A on lens fibrosis. Lens epithelial fibrosis was examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunofluorescence staining. Results PGC1A was decreased with significant mitochondrial dysfunction during TGFβ2-induced EMT of LECs. PGC1A silencing promoted EMT by enhancing TGFβ2-Smad2/3 signaling, accelerating subcapsular fibrotic plaque formation. PGC1A upregulation protected LECs from TGFβ2-induced EMT by restoring mitochondrial health and energy metabolism. Mechanistically, PGC1A inhibition decreased mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM), which mediated protective effects of PGC1A on mitochondria and LECs. Further, ZLN005, a PGC1A agonist, attenuated fibrotic lens opacity via preventing LECs from EMT. Conclusions PGC1A safeguards LECs against EMT by restoring TFAM-mediated mitochondrial energy metabolism under TGFβ2 stress, offering potential targets for the treatment of lens epithelial fibrosis. epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) PGC1A lens epithelial cells (LECs) mitochondria fibrotic cataract pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Lens epithelial cells (LECs) are the principal cells of the crystalline lens throughout life by supporting its development and homeostasis. During embryonic development, LECs are determined to form lens fibers and lens epithelium, constructing a transparent lens under different ocular environmental signals. 1 2 Activation of TGFβ signaling, triggered by injuries such as ocular trauma, intraocular surgeries, and metabolic disorders or inflammation, could induce aberrant epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of LECs. 3 3 , 4 5 Programmed degradation of nuclei and membrane-bound organelles including mitochondria during lens fiber maturation is a necessity for lens transparency. 6 7 7 – 9 10 – 14 15 – 17 Here, we revealed that loss of PGC1A promoted TGFβ2-smad2/3 signaling transduction to aggravate EMT of LECs and lens epithelial fibrosis, which accelerated subcapsular fibrotic plaques formation. Conversely, PGC1A upregulation restored mitochondrial health and respiration, thereby attenuating TGFβ2-Smad2/3 signals and EMT of LECs. Mechanistically, mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a key effector of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism through its contributions to transcription for essential proteins of the OXPHOS machinery, 18 Methods RNA-Seq Data Analysis Our RNA-seq data of human lens epithelial explants (HLEEs) was acquired as previously described (Project Accession No. PRJCA010973, GSA Accession code No. HRA002775). 19 P P 2 20 Isolation, Culture, and Treatment of Primary LECs All procedures involving animals adhered to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-Sen University. Primary LECs were isolated from 2-month-old New Zealand White Rabbits and cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM; 11095080; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; 10099141C; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Thornton, AU) and 1% non-essential amino acids (11140050; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). To induce EMT, primary rabbit LECs were treated with 10 ng/mL TGFβ2 (302-B2-010; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) for 0 to 3 days. To identify the effects of TGFβ2 on mitochondria in LECs, primary rabbit LECs were treated with or without TGFβ2 for 2 days. To upregulate PGC1A to inhibit TGFβ2-induced EMT in LECs, ZLN005 (20 µM, HY-17538; MedChemExpress, Shanghai, China) or an equal volume of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the culture medium 24 hours before treatment with or without TGFβ2 for 2 days. In Vitro Transfection With Plasmid and siRNA For gain-of-function studies, pcDNA3.1-PGC1A (oePGC1A) and negative control (oeNC) plasmids were obtained from Dahongbio. For loss-of-function studies, siRNAs targeting PGC1A (siPGC1A), TFAM (siTFAM), and negative control (siNC) were purchased from Ribobio. Following the manufacturer's instructions, plasmid (1.25 ng/mL) or siRNA (100 nM) was mixed with Opti-MEM and transfection reagents using Lipofectamine 3000 (l3000015; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and added when primary rabbit LECs reached 70% confluency. After transfection for 24 hours, primary rabbit LECs were treated with or without 10 ng/mL TGFβ2 for 2 days. Ex Vivo Whole Lens Culture and Treatment Intact whole lenses were isolated from 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (C11965500BT; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 1% FBS. Any opaque lenses due to dissection were discarded and only transparent lenses were used for further experimentation. After siRNA (100 nM) transfection or ZLN005 (20 µM) treatment for 24 hours, lenses were treated with or without 10 ng/mL TGFβ2 for 4 days. Culture medium was renewed every other day throughout the culture period. Each group contained lenses from separate animals ( n MitoTracker Staining Morphological changes of mitochondria in primary rabbit LECs were evaluated by Mitotracker Deep Red ( M22426 Transmission Electron Microscopy Primary rabbit LECs were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde overnight at 4°C, followed by a PBS wash 3 times and being postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 2 hours at 4°C. Samples were dehydrated with gradient ethanol and embedded in epon resin, and polymerized at 60°C for 48 hours. The blocks were ultrathin-sectioned at 80 to 100 nm with a diamond knife using an ultramicrotome (UC7; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate for 20 minutes and lead citrate for 12 minutes. Images were captured using a transmission electron microscopy (Tecnai G2 Spirit; FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and then analyzed by ImageJ software to measure the ratio of cristae number to the mitochondrial area (µm²). Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using MT-1 MitoMP Detection Kit (MT13; Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). According to the manufacturer's instruction, live primary rabbit LECs were treated with MT-1 working solution (MT-1 Dye diluted in the culture medium at 1:1000) for 30 minutes at 37°C. Following an HBSS wash twice, the images were obtained with the imaging buffer using a confocal microscope (LSM980; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). The fluorescent intensity was analyzed using ImageJ software. Mitochondrial or Glycolytic ATP Content Assay Mitochondrial and glycolytic ATP of primary rabbit LECs were detected by the Glycolysis/OXPHOS Assay Kit (G270; Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Primary rabbit LECs were incubated with or without 1.25 µmol/L oligomycin for 3 hours at 37°C. After incubation with ATP working solution at 25°C for 10 minutes, the relative light unit was assessed using a microplate reader (Infinite 200 Pro; Tecan, Mannedorf, Switzerland) to determine glycolytic and mitochondrial ATP levels. Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in primary rabbit LECs were measured using an ROS Assay Kit (S0034S; Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. LECs were washed with pre-warmed PBS, and then incubated with 10 µM fluorescent probe DCFH-DA free of light at 37°C for 20 minutes. After incubation, LECs were washed three times with HBSS to remove extracellular DCFH-DA. Fluorescence images were captured immediately using a fluorescence microscope (DM3000; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Protein Isolation and Western Blot Primary rabbit LECs and rat lens epithelium were lysed in RIPA buffer (P0013C; Beyotime, Shanghai, China) with PMSF and PhosStop (04906837001; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Proteins were separated by SurePAGE gels (GeneScript Biotech, Nanjing, China) and transferred onto PVDF membranes (IPVH00010; Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). After blocking with 5% BSA, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed by secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) at a dilution of 1:2000 for 2 hours at room temperature. Targeted protein bands were visualized with immobilon Western chemiluminescent HRP substrate (WBKLS0500; Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) using a ChemiDoc imaging system (12003153; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The intensity of protein bands was determined and further normalized to β-actin using ImageJ software. Primary antibodies used in this study included: PGC1A (sc517380, 1:200; Santa Cruz), FN (ab137720, 1:1000; Abcam), α-SMA (ab7817, 1:2000; Abcam), ZO-1 (617300, 1:1000; Invitrogen), E-cad (14472, 1:1000; CST), MFN1 (14739, 1:1000; CST), MFN2 (9482, 1:1000; CST), DRP1 (8570, 1:1000; CST), phospho-Smad2 (3108, 1:1000; CST), phospho-Smad3 (9520, 1:1000; CST), Smad2/3 (8685,1:1000; CST), TFAM (176558, 1:10000; Abcam), NRF1 (ab175932, 1:3000; Abcam), NRF2 (sc28312, 1:200; Santa Cruz), and β-actin (3700, 1:3000; CST). RNA Extraction and Real-Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (74104; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and converted to first-strand cDNA with PrimeScript RT Master Mix (RR036A; Takara, Kutsatsu, Japan). The qPCR was performed using the QuantiNova SYBR Green PCR kit (208054; Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on a QuantStudio 7 Flex system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). Relative RNA expression was quantified using the comparative 2 -ΔΔCt Cell Scratch Assay Cell migration was evaluated using a cell scratch assay. Primary LECs were seeded onto 6-well plates and grown to 100% confluency. A scratch was made using a sterile 200 µL pipette tip. After removing detached cells by PBS wash, LECs were cultured in FBS-free medium. Scratch areas were imaged 10 hours after the scratches were made using a light microscope. The percentage of the healing area to the entire scratch area was analyzed using ImageJ software. Immunofluorescence Staining and Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Primary LECs were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 minutes. Lenses were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated in gradient ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. After antigen retrieval, freshly-cut lens sections were blocked in 3% BSA with 0.3% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 hour, and incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight, followed by incubation of fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:1000, CST) free of light for 1 hour at room temperature. After counterstaining with DAPI for 5 minutes, the images were captured using a microscope (DM3000; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Primary antibodies included: FN (ab137720, 1:100; Abcam), α-SMA (ab7817, 1:100; Abcam), ZO-1 (617300, 1:100; Invitrogen), E-cad (14472, 1:100; CST), and Smad2/3 (8685,1:400; CST). For H&E staining, lens sections were prepared as described above and stained with hematoxylin solution (BA-4097; BASO Diagnostics, New Taipei City, Taiwan) and eosin solution (BA-4098; BASO Diagnostics, New Taipei City, Taiwan). Images were obtained using a microscope (DM3000; Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Statistical Analysis All experiments were repeated at least three times. All data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9. Two-tailed unpaired Student's t P P P Results Mitochondria Were Dysregulated Accompanied With Decreased PGC1A During TGFβ2-Induced Lens Epithelial Fibrosis and EMT of LECs To clarify whether TGFβ2 would influence mitochondrial function in LECs, we screened out DEGs ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Figure 1.

As shown in Figures 1 1 Fig. 1 21 Fig. 1 22 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 23 , 24 Figs. 1 1 Fig. 1 Supplementary Fig. S1 As revealed in RNA-seq during human lens epithelial fibrosis (see Fig. 1 Figs. 1 Fig. 1 Taken together, these results demonstrated that mitochondrial homeostasis was disrupted in morphology, organization, and bioenergetic function accompanied with PGC1A decrease during TGFβ2-induced lens epithelial fibrosis and EMT of LECs, implying mitochondria as signaling organelles in regulating LECs fate under TGFβ2 stress. Knockdown of PGC1A Aggravated TGFβ2-Induced EMT of LECs by Enhancing Smad2/3 Activation To identify the regulatory role of mitochondria in EMT of LECs under TGFβ2 stress, loss-of-function studies were conducted using siRNAs to downregulate PGC1A in primary rabbit LECs ( Figs. 2 Figs. 2 25 Figs. 2 2 Figure 2.

We continued to investigate whether PGC1A deficiency could promote lens epithelial fibrosis through EMT of LECs using an ex vivo fibrotic cataract model with TGFβ2-treated whole rat lenses. While the lenses remained transparent with TGFβ2 treatment after 2 days, the lenses with PGC1A silencing under TGFβ2 treatment displayed white plaques, which became more widespread than TGFβ2-treated lenses after 4 days ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Figs. 3 Figure 3.

As expected, PGC1A overexpression inhibited Smad2/3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in TGFβ2-treated LECs ( Figs. 5 Figs. 5 Figs. 5 5 Figure 5.

TFAM was Inhibited by TGFβ2 Stress and PGC1A Silencing PGC1A has been reported to regulate mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism through targeting multiple transcription factors, such as nuclear respiratory factor 1/2 (NRF1/2) and TFAM. 15 Figs. 6 6 18 Figs. 6 Figs. 6 Figure 6.  Expression of TFAM was regulated by TGFβ2 and PGC1A. A, B C D, E F G, H n P P P TFAM Mediated the Protective Effects of PGC1A on Mitochondrial Activity and Epithelial Identity of LECs Thus, we continued to identify the role of TFAM in mitochondrial energy metabolism and EMT of primary rabbit LECs. Loss of TFAM enhanced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad2/3 ( Figs. 7 Figs. 7 7 Figure 7.  TFAM mediated the protective effects of PGC1A on mitochondrial activity and epithelial identity of LECs. A – F G – M A, B C, J blue D , E, K , L F, G H, I M blue n Scale bars P P Meanwhile, TFAM knockdown decreased mitochondria-derived ATP while increased glycolytic ATP in LECs with TGFβ2 treatment ( Fig. 7 Fig. 7 We then investigated whether TFAM served as the downstream effector of PGC1A to relay TGFβ2 signals in LECs, and found that PGC1A overexpression in the absence of TFAM failed to suppress Smad2/3 signal transduction ( Figs. 7 Figs. 7 The above results revealed that PGC1A regulated mitochondrial activity in ATP production and EMT of LECs through the key mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM, indicating TFAM as an indispensable downstream effector of PGC1A for lens epithelial maintenance via protecting mitochondrial respiration in LECs. PGC1A Agonist ZLN005 Alleviated Lens Epithelial Fibrosis via Protecting LECs From EMT The therapeutic potential of PGC1A in fibrotic cataracts was then evaluated by using ZLN005, a small-molecule agonist of PGC1A, to enhance mitochondrial function in primary rabbit LECs. 33 Figs. 8 8 Fig. 8 Figs. 8 8 Figs. 8 Figs. 8 Figure 8.  PGC1A agonist ZLN005 prevented TGFβ2-induced metabolic switch and EMT of LECs. A, B C D, E F, G H I blue J, K L, M n H, I Scale bars L Scale bars P P P Next, we explored the inhibitory role of ZLN005 in lens epithelial fibrosis within fibrotic cataract model of whole rat lenses. ZLN005 inhibited EMT of LECs, suppressed excessive proliferation and abnormal multilayering of mesenchymal cells beneath the anterior lens capsule ( Figs. 9 Figs. 9 9 Figure 9.  ZLN005 attenuated formation of TGFβ2-induced subcapsular fibrotic plaques in rat lenses. A blue B, C D E n A, D Scale bars Scale bars P P Taken together, ZLN005, the PGC1A agonist, attenuated fibrotic lens opacity via protecting LECs from EMT. Discussion LECs play a dominant role in the establishment and maintenance of lens transparency. Lens epithelial fibrosis resulted from EMT of LECs lays the foundation of fibrotic cataractogenesis, 3 , 4 5 As the major cells containing functional mitochondria in mature lenses, LECs are the most metabolically active cell population. Growing evidence reveals mitochondria as not only the cellular power sites, but also signaling organelles to alter cell states and tissue functions in response to extrinsic or intrinsic stresses. 34 9 , 35 – 37 NCT02538536 NCT03421431 NCT02030977 38 – 41 First, we found that TGFβ2 disrupted mitochondrial morphology and structure, which inevitably caused functional breakdown including metabolic reprogramming in ATP synthetic pathway with decreased OXPHOS and enhanced compensatory glycolysis. We then explored the effect of mitochondrial dysfunction on EMT of LECs through functional studies of PGC1A. Here, we found that PGC1A was decreased during lens epithelial fibrosis and loss of PGC1A promoted TGFβ2-Smad2/3 signaling to aggravate EMT of LECs, which destroyed lens epithelium integrity and accelerated subcapsular fibrotic plaques formation. Conversely, PGC1A upregulation restored mitochondrial health with enhanced biogenesis and mitochondrial respiration, which then prevented EMT of LECs via repressing Smad2/3 activation. These findings demonstrated that mitochondria respiratory defects induced by TGFβ2 could aggravate EMT of LECs through Smad2/3 activation. Next, how PGC1A regulates energy metabolism under TGFβ2 stress to alter LECs fate draws our attention. Multiple downstream transcription factors have been identified to be regulated by PGC1A and involved in the expression of both nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded genes to adapt mitochondrial respiration. 15 18 42 , 43 Intriguingly, how does alterations in mitochondrial energy metabolism regulate mesenchymal transition of LECs? The switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis as a mitochondrial metabolic alteration was noted in EMT during tumor metastasis since a century ago. 44 45 , 46 47 – 49 50 , 51 Given the above, our study implies the essential role of mitochondrial respiration in maintaining lens epithelial integrity under TGFβ2 stress. In previous studies, mutations in mtDNA or nuclear-encoded genes such as optic atrophy 3 (OPA3), which is associated with defective OXPHOS, could result in developmental cataracts, 52 – 54 Beyond cellular metabolism, mitochondria are essential in maintaining redox homeostasis by producing antioxidants and regulating redox modifiers such as NAD+ and glutathione, which broadly influences cell fate and tissue health. 7 , 55 – 59 Fig. 1 Supplementary Fig. S1 60 , 61 62 63 64 , 65 66 – 68 Supplementary Fig. S1 Mitochondria also have a central role in intrinsic apoptotic cell death. 69 , 70 Supplementary Fig. S2 Supplementary Figs. S3 S4 71 72 73 74 75 Fig. 1 Supplementary Fig. S3 Deciphering the role and mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction in EMT is essential for developing therapeutic strategies for fibrotic disorders. Finally, we explored the potential of a pharmaceutical approach targeting PGC1A in mitigating EMT of LECs and found that ZLN005, a small-molecule activator of PGC1A, attenuated EMT, and fibrotic lens opacity via upregulating TFAM and restoring mitochondrial respiration. Nevertheless, therapeutic efficacy observed in ex vivo lens culture system requires confirmation in combination with in vivo assessments. In the future, in vivo animal models will be applied to confirm the scientific findings of this study and explore more potential drug candidates based on mitochondria protection. In summary, our study unveils the novel role and mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction in EMT of LECs during lens epithelial fibrosis ( Supplementary Fig. S5 Supplementary Material Supplement 1 Acknowledgments Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82070944, No. 81721003), the Guangzhou Science and Technology Planning Project (No. 2025A03J3975), National Key R&D Program of China (2023YFC2506100), the State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-Sen University.
