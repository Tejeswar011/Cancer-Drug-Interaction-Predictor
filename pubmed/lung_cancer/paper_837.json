However, there is limited research on the pharmacokinetics of I-BET151, especially the lack of methods for determining the concentration of I-BET151 in vivo. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to establish an HPLC-MS/MS method for determining the plasma concentration of I-BET151 and use it for pharmacokinetic study in rats. Methods The chromatographic column is a Poroshell 120EC-C18 column (50 mm × 4.6 mm, 2.7 μm). The mobile phase consists of water containing 20 mmol ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid, and methanol containing 0.1% formic acid, with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The extraction of I-BET151 is liquid–liquid extraction, and the extraction solvent is ether:dichloromethane=2:3. The HPLC-MS/MS method was validated based on the guidelines of quantitative methods for biological samples in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, including specificity, standard curve, lower limit of quantification, residual effects, precision, recovery rate, matrix effects, stability, etc. Results The results showed that the established method met the requirements of methodological validation standards and could be used for pharmacokinetic studies of I-BET151. The pharmacokinetic results displayed that the half-life of oral and intravenous administration of I-BET151 was 4.3 h and 3.1 h, respectively. The oral bioavailability was about 60%, indicating that I-BET151 had a high oral bioavailability and appropriate half-life, demonstrating good clinical application prospects.

However, there is a lack of corresponding data and reports on the pharmacokinetic behavior of I-BET151 in vivo, which directly affects the subsequent development of preparations, drug interaction studies, and formulation of dosing regimens. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct systematic pharmacokinetic studies on I-BET151. In terms of in vivo drug concentration determination, HPLC-MS/MS is the most commonly used detection method. Compared to HPLC, UV spectrophotometry and immunoassay, HPLC-MS/MS method has many advantages, such as high specificity, high sensitivity, high throughput, and the ability to simultaneously detect multiple drugs and metabolites, making it the gold standard for in vivo analysis of small molecule drugs. 19–21 Methods Experimental Reagents I-BET151 (purity 99.5%) and diazepam (internal standard, IS, purity 99.9%) were purchased from Selleck & bimake (Texas, USA) and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively (St. Louis, USA). Methanol and acetonitrile were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, USA). Water was prepared using a Milli-Q water purification system procured from Millipore (Millipore Corp., USA). Formic acid and ammonium acetate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA). All solvents and chemicals were HPLC-grade and did not require further purification before application.

The ionization mode of I-BET151 and diazepam was positive. The MRM transition of I-BET151 and diazepam was m/z 416.0/311.1 and m/z 285.1/193.0. The main MS parameters were displayed in Table 2 Table 2 MS Parameters of I-BET151 and Diazepam Ionization Mode Transition (m/z) Collision Energy (v) Declustering Potential (v) Spray Voltage (v) Cell exit potential (v) I-BET151 Positive 416.0→311.1 29 110 4500 10 Diazepam Positive 285.1→193.0 44 80 4500 6 Stock Solutions, Quality Control Samples and Calibration Standards Two milligrams of I-BET151 reference substance was weighed precisely and placed in a 10 mL volumetric flask. Methanol was added to dissolved I-BET151 and the volume was made up to the mark, preparing a stock solution of 200.0 μg/mL for later use. Additionally, 1.00 mg of diazepam reference substance was precisely weighed and put into a 10 mL volumetric flask, methanol was added to dissolve it and the volume was adjusted to the mark, obtaining a 100.0 μg/mL stock solution. Then, gradually diluted the I-BET151 stock solution with methanol to obtain a series of I-BET151 standard solutions with concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 2.0, 5.0, 20.0, 50.0 and 100.0 μg/mL; 200 ng/mL diazepam solution was obtained by diluting the diazepam stock solution. Took 100.0 μL of rat blank plasma, and added 10.0 μL of the I-BET151 series standard solutions and 10.0 μL of 200 ng/mL diazepam solution, respectively, to prepare plasma samples with I-BET151 concentrations of 20.0, 50.0, 200.0, 500.0, 2000.0, 5000.0, and 10000.0 ng/mL. According to the procedures described as “Treatment Method of Plasma Samples”, took 2.0 μL for analysis and recorded the chromatogram. The peak area ratio of I-BET151 to diazepam was plotted on the y-axis, and the concentration of I-BET151 was plotted on the x-axis. We can use the least squares method to obtain the best fitting curve, which is the standard curve. The quality control (QC) samples were used to evaluate the method stability, including high-concentration QC, medium-concentration QC, low-concentration QC and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). Their concentrations were 8000.0 ng/mL, 500.0 ng/mL, 40.0 ng/mL, and 20.0 ng/mL, respectively. Plasma Sample Processing Method A 100.0 μL sample of plasma was taken and placed in a 7.0 mL plastic round-bottom EP tube with a stopper. 10.0 μL of the diazepam solution and 3 mL of the mixed extraction solvent (ether:dichloromethane = 2:3) were added. It was vortexed for 6 min, and then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 8 min. The supernatant was taken and transferred to a 10 mL pointed-bottom EP tube. The solvent was evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen stream at 40 °C. Then it was redissolved with 300 μL of methanol, vortexed for 6 min and centrifuged at 15000 rpm for 8 min. The supernatant was taken for injection analysis. Method Validation All validation procedures of the developed HPLC-MS/MS method were performed following the Chinese pharmacopoeia guidelines for bioanalytical method validation. 22 Specificity A sample of 100.0 μL blank plasma obtained by mixing the blood from 6 rats was taken. Without adding the internal standard, the operations were carried out based on the procedures “Plasma Sample Processing Method” section, and 3.0 μL of the sample was injected to obtain the chromatogram. A suitable concentration of I-BET151 solution was added into the blank rat plasma to prepare a simulated plasma sample. The operations were carried out based on the procedures “Plasma Sample Processing Method” section, and 3.0 μL of the sample was injected to obtain the chromatogram. The plasma samples collected from rats after administration, following the procedures in the “Processing Methods for Plasma Samples” section, and 3.0 μL of the supernatant was injected to obtain the chromatogram. It was required that the response of the interfering components should be lower than 20% of the response of the lower limit of quantification of I-BET151 and lower than 5% of the response of diazepam. Linearity, LLOQ and Carryover According to the results of the preliminary experiment, the linear range of I-BET151 was set to be 20.0–10,000.0 ng/mL. It was required that the recalculated concentration of the calibration standard should be less than ±15% of the labeled value, and the LLOQ should be within ±20%. The LLOQ refered to the lowest concentration of the analyte in a sample that can be reliably quantified, and it should have acceptable accuracy and precision. In this study, the LLOQ was the lowest point of the standard curve. The carryover effect would affect the accuracy of the determination, and the carryover should be investigated and minimized. After injecting the sample with the highest concentration of the standard curve, a blank plasma sample was injected to evaluate the carryover effect. It was required that the carryover in the blank plasma sample after the high-concentration sample should be within 20% of the LLOQ and should not exceed 5% of diazepam. Accuracy and Precision Accuracy described the degree of closeness between the detected concentration and the labeled concentration of the analyte, while precision described the degree of closeness of the concentrations of the analyte obtained from repeated determinations and was defined as the relative standard deviation of the concentration determination. Took 100.0 μL of blank plasma and carried out the procedures described as “Preparation of Standard Curve”. Quality control (QC) samples of I-BET151 were prepared at three concentrations of low, medium and high (40.0, 500.0, 8000.0 ng/mL) respectively. Six samples for each concentration were prepared according to the procedures described as “Plasma Sample Processing Method” and conducted continuous determinations for 3 d. Then, the concentrations of the QC samples were calculated according to the standard curve. The accuracy and precision were calculated according to the results of the QC samples. It was required that both the relative standard deviation (RSD) of precision and the relative error (RE) of accuracy should be lower than 15.0%. Extraction Recovery and Matrix Effect A sample of 100.0 μL blank plasma was taken and carried out the procedures described as “Preparation of Standard Curve” to prepare QC samples of I-BET151 at three concentrations of low, medium and high (40.0, 500.0, 8000.0 ng/mL), respectively. Six samples for each concentration were prepared according to the procedures described as “Plasma Sample Processing Method” to obtain the peak area A. Additionally, another 100.0 μL of blank plasma was taken and mixed with 3 mL of the extraction solvent, it was vortexed for 6.0 min and centrifuged at 3000.0 rpm for 8.0 min. Then, the supernatant was taken into a 10.0 mL plastic tube, 10.0 μL of I-BET151 solution and 10.0 μL of diazepam solution were added, respectively. The processing steps were carried out based on the procedures “Plasma Sample Processing Method”, the sample was injected to obtain the peak area B. The extraction recovery rate was calculated according to the ratio A/B of the peak areas of the two treatment methods for each concentration. A sample of 100.0 μL blank plasma was taken and mixed with 3 mL of the extraction solvent, it was vortexed for 6.0 min and centrifuged at 3000.0 rpm for 8.0 min. Then, the supernatant was taken into a 10.0 mL plastic tube, 10.0 μL of I-BET151 solution and 10.0 μL of diazepam solution were added, respectively. The processing steps were carried out based on the procedures “Plasma Sample Processing Method”, the sample was injected to obtain the peak area A. Next, 100.0 μL of water was taken and mixed with 3 mL of the extraction solvent, it was vortexed for 6.0 min and centrifuged at 3000.0 rpm for 8.0 min. Then, the supernatant was taken into a 10.0 mL plastic tube, 10.0 μL of I-BET151 solution and 10.0 μL of diazepam solution were added, respectively. The processing steps were carried out based on the procedures “Plasma Sample Processing Method”, the sample was injected to obtain the peak area B. The matrix effect was calculated according to the ratio A/B of the peak areas of the two treatment methods for each concentration. Stability The stability of I-BET151 in rat plasma was assessed using QC samples under following conditions, including short-term stability (room temperature, 12 h), long-term stability (−20 °C, 30 d), freeze-thaw stability (from −20.0 °C to room temperature, three cycles) and autosampler stability (4 °C, 24 h). The RE should be less than 15%. Dilution Integrity A plasma sample of I-BET151 with a concentration of 40000.0 ng/mL was prepared, and it was diluted with blank plasma to prepare plasma samples with concentrations of 500.0 ng/mL and 8000.0 ng/mL, respectively. Three samples for each concentration were prepared according to the procedures described as “Plasma Sample Processing Method”. It was required that the RE% between the detected concentration and the theoretical concentration of all dilution tests should be less than 15.0%. Application Animal Experimental Protocol Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing approximately 200 g were randomly divided into 2 groups, with 10 rats in each group. The rats were fasted for 12 h before the experiment but had free access to water. All rats use procedures were in accordance with the regulation for animal experimentation issued by the State Committee of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China. In addition, this experiment was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Cancer Hospital of China Medical University, ethical number KT20240319. In the first group, the rats were administered I-BET151 suspension by gavage, and the dosage was 20 mg/kg. In the second group, I-BET151 solution was administered via the tail vein at a dosage of 20 mg/kg. Blood samples of approximately 0.3 mL were collected from the rat eye sockets using heparinized capillary glass tubes (inner diameter 0.9–1.1 mm) at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after administration. The blood samples were placed in 1.5 mL heparinized and dried centrifuge tubes. The samples were then centrifuged at a speed of 3000 rpm for 6 min to separate the plasma. The extracted plasma was processed and analyzed according to the “Plasma Sample Processing Method”. Processing and Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Parameters After completing the pharmacokinetic experiment on rats and detecting the plasma concentrations of each group at various time points, the Drug and Statistics Software (DAS) 3.0 software was used to process and analyze the data. The software was utilized to calculate important pharmacokinetic parameters such as the maximum blood drug concentration (C max max 0→t 1/2 0→∞ d Results and Discussion Method Optimization Although the MRM mode of mass spectrometry did not require the analytes to meet the baseline separation standard, it was required that the chromatographic peaks of the analytes were sharp and symmetrical, and the retention time should be moderate, which was closely related to the composition of the mobile phase, the selection of the chromatographic column, and the column temperature, etc. Through systematic optimization, it was found that when the chromatographic column was Poroshell 120 EC-C 18 Table 1 In order to obtain highly sensitive and stable analyte signals, parameters such as the ionization mode, collision energy, declustering voltage, ion source temperature, and curtain gas were optimized. Through optimization, it was found that the response of I-BET151 and diazepam were higher and more stable in the positive ion ionization mode, and the noise was lower as well. The MS parameters, chromatograms and the final ion pairs were shown in Table 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 The diagrams of daughter scan of I-BET151 and diazepam. There were mainly three extraction methods for biological samples, namely solid-phase extraction, protein precipitation, and liquid–liquid extraction. Among them, the protein precipitation method was the simplest, but it was generally very difficult to completely precipitate the matrix, resulting in poor sample cleanliness, which was likely to cause the contamination of the mass spectrometry ion source and the occurrence of the matrix effect. The samples processed by the liquid–liquid extraction method and the solid-phase extraction method had higher cleanliness, but the processing procedures were more complicated than the protein precipitation method and required the support of other equipment. In this study, taking the extraction recovery as the measurement standard, I investigated diethyl ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, a mixed solvent of diethyl ether and dichloromethane (diethyl ether:dichloromethane=1:1), and a mixed solvent of diethyl ether and dichloromethane (diethyl ether:dichloromethane=2:3), respectively. The results showed that when the mixed solvent of diethyl ether and dichloromethane (diethyl ether:dichloromethane=2:3) was used as the extraction solvent, I-BET151 and diazepam could obtain higher and more stable recovery. Method Validation Specificity The results of the specificity demonstrated that the endogenous substances in the plasma did not interfere with the determination of I-BET151 and diazepam. It indicated that the matrix in the plasma could be largely removed thoroughly by liquid–liquid extraction. The typical chromatograms of the blank plasma, I-BET151, and diazepam were shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 Representative HPLC-MS/MS chromatograms for I-BET151 and diazepam in rats plasma samples: ( A B C D Linearity and LLOQ In different rat plasma, eligible linearity was obtained at 20.0–20,000.0 ng/mL for I-BET151, and the typical equation of the calibration curve was as follows: y=0.4793x+1.1085 (r=0.9998). The LLOQ of I-BET151 was 20.0 ng/mL.
