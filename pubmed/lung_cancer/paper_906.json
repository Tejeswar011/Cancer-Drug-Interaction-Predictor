The pathological progression of RA is driven by an imbalance between pro‐inflammatory and anti‐inflammatory cytokines, with elevated levels of IL‐6, TNF‐α, IFN‐γ, GM‐CSF, and IL‐17A indicating severe inflammation. These inflammatory cytokines further stimulate macrophage type 1 (M1) polarization, fibroblast‐like synoviocyte (FLS) transformation, and T cell activation, leading to exacerbation of the disease (Figure 6I [  56  57 ] [  58  59 ] 6H 8:2 8:2 8:2 S9 3 Discussion The Tri‐ARTEX system is inspired by EVs, which have been considered as potential cell‐free therapeutics for various diseases, including RA.

Subtle changes in membrane mechanical properties can profoundly affect the therapeutic efficacy of Tri‐ARTEXs for RA treatment. We hypothesized that modulation of systemic biodistribution and anti‐inflammatory effects of the liposomes could be attributed to the fine‐tuning of liposomal membrane elasticity, as controlled by polymer fraction. The lipid/polymer hybrid system showed increased liposomal membrane elasticity with a greater PEO‐ b b b b [  33 ] [  66  67 ] Besides improved mechanical properties and therapeutic performance, this polymer modification also plays a critical role in enhancing the biocompatibility of the Tri‐ARTEX system. DOTAP liposomes, while extensively investigated cationic lipids for gene and drug delivery, are known to cause rapid systemic clearance at high doses due to their strong positive surface charge.

The amphiphilic triblock copolymer, PEO‐ b b −1 −1 TM TM TM m −1 TM TM Synthesis of Cy5.5‐Conjugated DOPE Cy5.5‐conjugated DOPE was synthesized by using the ester‐amine reaction according to standard protocols.

ADSCs were detached by TrypLE TM 6 g g Preparation of ADSC‐Derived EVs Passage #5 or #6 ADSCs were used for EV preparation. ADSCs were cultured in complete DMEM at 80% confluency. The cells were washed twice with DPBS, and then the culture medium was changed to FBS‐free DMEM. After 24‐h starvation, the supernatant media were filtered through 0.22‐µm filters to remove cell debris from the medium. The filtered sample was then purified by centrifugation using an Amicon® Ultra (AU) filter (100k MWCO) to remove other large‐molecule proteins and to concentrate the EV solution. Each supernatant was collected and serially centrifuged at 300 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, 2000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, and 10 000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min.

For DLS measurements, samples were exposed to a He‐Ne red laser with a 633‐nm wavelength that was set at a scattering angle of 90°. Three measurement replicates were recorded per sample. The morphologies of both Tri‐LIPs and Tri‐ARTEXs were imaged using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL‐2100F instrument, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. For sample preparation, the Tri‐LIPs and Tri‐ARTEXs were placed onto a 200‐mesh carbon‐film‐coated grid without drying, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and rinsed with deionized water. QCM‐D Measurements For QCM‐D analysis, Tri‐LIPs were prepared with 10 m m m [  50 ] −1 −3 Western Blotting EVs and ARTEX were lysed by 1x RIPA buffer containing 1x cOmplete EDTA‐free protease inhibitor cocktails, followed by centrifugation to remove the lysate. Total protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay. Protein samples were separated by SDS‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked with 5% skim milk buffer. The membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies, followed by incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies at room temperature. The ALIX primary antibody was obtained from Abcam (Camb, UK), while CD63 and Hsp70 antibodies were included in the ExoAb antibody kit (System Biosciences, CA, USA). An electrochemiluminescence chromogenic substrate was applied to visualize the target bands, and imaging was performed using a ChemiDoc system (Bio‐Rad, USA).
