Abstract Fatigue is a common and often debilitating adverse event among patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, yet its underlying immunologic mechanisms remain poorly defined. We prospectively collected clinical data and blood samples from patients with solid tumors receiving ICI therapy. Patients were prospectively surveyed at month 2, 4, or 6 on treatment to assess for the presence and severity of fatigue as compared with treatment baseline. We analyzed peripheral lymphocyte populations by cytometry by time of flight and peripheral levels of 39 cytokines with a Luminex multiplex assay to identify dynamic immune changes associated with ICI-related fatigue. Of 53 patients enrolled, 31 (58.5%) reported worsening fatigue during ICI therapy. Patients reporting fatigue exhibited broad early-treatment elevations in circulating cytokines, with the most prominent increases observed in the Th1-associated cytokine cluster, including IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-12. In parallel, several clusters of cytotoxic effector CD8 + + Significance: This study illuminates dynamic changes in peripheral cytokines and immune cell clusters that are associated with ICI-related fatigue. Namely, this study implicates the Th1 pathway as a novel contributor to ICI-related fatigue and identifies ICI-related fatigue as a clinical surrogate for immune activation in patients receiving ICI therapy. Recognizing that fatigue may be a biomarker of heightened immune activity influences monitoring strategies and informs supportive care interventions during immunotherapy.

These therapies block inhibitory receptors such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, inducing a potent antitumor immune response in a subset of patients ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Fatigue is common in patients with cancer independently of ICI treatment and is thought to result from a complex interplay between inflammation, changes in ATP and muscle metabolism, anemia, comorbidities, and cytokine dysregulation ( 8 9 10 11 12 13 In this exploratory study, we prospectively analyzed changes in peripheral blood cytokine levels and immune cell populations in patients with solid tumors treated with ICI therapy who reported ICI-related fatigue. We also investigated the clinical implications of ICI-related fatigue on cancer-related outcomes. Materials and Methods Study design and patient inclusion Patients with solid tumors who received ICI treatment as standard of care at Johns Hopkins University were approached and consented for this study from May 2021 to May 2023. Clinical data were censored on April 1, 2025. Inclusion criteria included patients 18 years of age or older with pathologically confirmed solid tumors treated with ICI (including anti–PD-1/–PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents). All patients enrolled in the study had a peripheral blood sample collected at baseline prior to initiation of the ICI. Subsequently, peripheral blood samples were collected at month 1, 2, 4, and 6 if the patient was continued on ICI and available. Patient demographic information was obtained from the electronic medical record system, EPIC. Cancer groups for Gastrointestinal/Genitourinary (GI/GU) and other cancers are defined in Supplementary Table S1. The development of irAEs was assessed on an ongoing basis by the treating physician, and irAEs were graded based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5. Investigator-assessed best responses to therapy were based on RECIST v1.1 criteria. All clinical information was reviewed by two study team members, including at least one medical oncologist reviewer. Fatigue survey Patients were contacted by phone at their 2-month treatment timepoint to query for increasing fatigue since starting ICI therapy. Patients who were not successfully contacted or did not respond at month 2 could be recontacted at month 4 and month 6. Patients who were successfully contacted were asked to complete a survey to assess the impact of immunotherapy on fatigue. Patients were specifically asked, “As compared to just before you started the current immunotherapy treatment, do you feel more fatigued?” If the patients answered “yes” to the initial question, they were posed a confirmatory question to assess for a fatigue score, “If yes, how much more fatigued do you feel from a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worse increase in fatigue imaginable.” Patients with fatigue scores between 1 and 5 were categorized as low fatigue, and patients with fatigue scores between 6 and 10 were categorized as high fatigue. Patients who responded that they felt more fatigued were scored as experiencing ICI-related fatigue for all analyses, whereas patients who did not note more fatigue were scored as not experiencing ICI-related fatigue. The survey was performed by an evaluator who was blinded at the time of survey to the clinical status of the patient and all correlative data. This fatigue survey was a sub-study of the Johns Hopkins Immunotherapy biobank, a prospective effort to understand biomarkers of response, resistance, and toxicity of immunotherapy treatment. Among 103 patients prospectively enrolled in the parent study from May 2021 to May 2023, 53 patients were successfully contacted and surveyed about fatigue. No contacted patients declined to participate. Plasma collection Blood samples were collected and processed as previously described by our team ( 14 16 Cytokine measurements The Bio-Plex 200 platform (Bio-Rad) was used to determine the concentration (pg/mL) of target cytokines in plasma as previously described ( 14 16 Cytometry by time-of-flight staining, acquisition, and analyses All cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) staining, acquisition, and analyses were performed at the Johns Hopkins CyTOF core facility as previously described ( 14 16 6 6 103 103 194 195 Statistical methods For samples collected on treatment, fold change for each timepoint was calculated relative to baseline to account for inter-patient variability. Important timepoints for our analysis included the early on-treatment timepoint, which occurred at 2 months after treatment initiation. Nonparametric methods were used to assess group differences for the cytokine analyses given skewing in the distributions; the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used when assessing statistical differences between two groups.

Early on-treatment fatigue is associated with multiple cytokines, including Th1-associated cytokines To account for the eventual heterogeneity of treatment courses, including progression, irAE development, and study attrition, the 28 patients with early on-treatment timepoints (month 2) were analyzed separately. This cohort’s demographics can be found in Supplementary Table S3. Globally, there is an overall greater increase in cytokines from baseline to early on-treatment in patients who experienced ICI-related fatigue compared with patients who did not ( Fig. 1A Fig. 1B–D Figure 1. Early on-treatment log 2 A, 2 B C D P P We next investigated whether the severity of fatigue correlated with the magnitude of Th1-associated cytokine elevation. Although patients with higher fatigue scores exhibited numerically greater fold increases in IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-12 compared with those with lower fatigue scores, these differences did not reach statistical significance. To assess whether the observed associations might be confounded by tumor progression, we conducted subgroup analyses stratified by disease status. Importantly, when patients with radiographic disease progression were excluded to account for cancer-related fatigue, IFN-γ and IL-12 remained significantly elevated in fatigued patients (Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, among patients with progressive disease, Th1-associated cytokine changes were not significantly associated with fatigue. When all patients who received ICI with chemo/anti-VEGF therapy were excluded, Th1-associated cytokine IFN-γ also remained significant (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, the proportion of patients with ICI-related fatigue was identical in patients who received ICI monotherapy and ICI chemo/anti-VEGF combination therapy (Supplementary Table S1). These findings suggest that the link between Th1 cytokine elevation and fatigue in ICI-treated patients is independent of tumor progression, or other agents administered in combination with ICIs, and likely reflect ICI-related immune activation. Cytotoxic effector T cells increase in abundance in patients with ICI-related fatigue There were 30 patients with immune cell abundance measured at baseline and early on-treatment, of whom 18 had ICI-related fatigue. The demographics of the fatigued CyTOF cohort are presented in Supplementary Table S5. Two clusters of cytotoxic effector T cells were annotated TcEFF_I and TcEFF_III, both primarily characterized by shared CD3 + + Fig. 2A B Fig. 2C D + + Figure 2.

Discussion Although fatigue is one of the most common side effects of ICI therapy, the biological mechanisms underlying ICI-related fatigue are not well understood. We examined changes in plasma cytokines and immune cell populations among ICI recipients to understand the underlying immune mechanisms of ICI-related fatigue ( 13 + 17 Although we observed a relationship between fatigue and Th1-skewed immune activation—and despite prior studies demonstrating that Th1 polarization is generally associated with favorable immunotherapy outcomes ( 18 2 19 This study has several limitations. First, cancer progression may confound the assessment of ICI-related fatigue. We attempted to mitigate this potential confounder by asking patients to specifically identify fatigue that worsened on ICI therapy in relation to a baseline of prior to ICI treatment initiation. Additionally, in a sensitivity analysis restricted to patients without progressive disease, the association between fatigue and elevated Th1-associated cytokines remained significant. In contrast, among patients with disease progression, Th1 cytokine changes were not linked to fatigue, suggesting distinct mechanisms underlying ICI-related fatigue versus cancer-related fatigue. Another potential confounder is the known association between fatigue and various irAEs, including endocrinopathies, which are independently associated with fatigue; notably, fatigue has been reported to precede irAE onset by about a week ( 20 21 5 22 + Supplementary Material Supplemental Table 1 Supplemental Table 1 shows cancer types and treatment regimens represented in the cohort.
