Highlights • Chronic rhinosinusitis impacts shift in the gut microbiome composition. • It may lower reduce Haemophilus parainfluenzae • It may alter gut environment, causing a rise of the hazardous microbes Bilophila. • It is linked to changes in gut microbiota's metabolic pathways. Objective Gut microbiome dysbiosis is associated with various diseases. Causal association between Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) and gut microbiome is yet unknown. This study aimed to investigate the potential causal relationship between CRS and gut microbiome dysbiosis. Methods We used Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data from FinnGen database for CRS. The Dutch Microbiome Project study provided data on gut microbiota species. A total of 334,182 individuals were included. Two-sample bidirectional Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis was used to investigate causal relationship between CRS and gut microbiome. The main methods of evaluation were Inverse Variance Weighting (IVW), weighted median, weighted mode, and MR-Egger regression. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess heterogeneity and pleiotropy. Results Forward MR analysis indicated CRS is potentially linked to decreased risk of Haemophilus parainfluenzae p p -N- d p p p Conclusion This study reveals CRS exerts a causal impact on shifts within the composition of the gut microbiome and also links to the changes of gut microbiota-related metabolic pathways. The risk of changes in gut microbiota should be of greater concern in patients with CRS than in the general population. Level of evidence Mendelian Randomized (MR) studies are second only to randomized controlled trials in terms of the level of evidence.

CRS offers serious health problems for 5%‒12% of the general population, with main symptoms including nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, facial pain/pressure, and a diminished or lost sense of smell that lasts for more than 12 weeks. 1 1 2 3 The human microbiome refers to the diverse group of bacteria that inhabit and interact with the human body, especially the immune system and epithelial cells on mucosal surfaces, such as airways. 4 5 6 7 The nasal cavity and the gut are anatomically linked and both have a diverse natural microbiota.

Selection of SNPs Using the three MR analysis assumptions, we chose Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to CRS as IVs. Effective IVs were SNPs that showed a strong correlation with exposure ( p r 2 14 2 2 15 , 16 Two-sample MR Using the “TwoSampleMR” package in R software (version 4.3.1), we conducted bidirectional MR analysis to determine the causal relationship between CRS and 412 microbiological groups. Causal relationships were assessed using the Inverse Variance Weighted (IVW) model, 17 18 19 19 Statistical analysis We used MR-Egger regression to detect and correct for pleiotropy bias. We employed the Weighted Median method to guarantee accurate causal estimations, even in the case that up to 50% of the SNPs are invalid. 20 Q Q 21 R http://www.r-project.org Results Instrumental variable selection We extracted a certain number of SNPs from the CRS dataset (finngen_R10_J10_CHRONSINUSITIS), all of which met our predetermined selection criteria. Specifically, the IVs significantly associated with CRS ( p −8 Causal relationships between CRS and gut microbiota species According to the IVW MR analysis results (Supplementary Table 2), CRS was genetically predicted to have a potential causal relationship with 12 gut microbiota species ( p Gammaproteobacteria Pasteurellales Pasteurellaceae Haemophilus Haemophilus parainfluenzae Alistipes indistinctus Alistipes.s Odoribacter splanchnicus Odoribacter.s The results showed that CRS was most significantly associated with an increased risk of Bilophila (OR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.02–1.27, p Haemophilus parainfluenzae p Fig. 3 Fig. 3 This forest plot displays the Mendelian Randomization assessment of the association between chronic rhinosinusitis and gut microbiota. Fig. 3 Causal associations between CRS and gut microbiota metabolic pathways The IVW MR analysis results (Supplementary Table 3) found CRS was genetically predicted to have causal relationships with 21 gut microbial functional metabolic pathways ( p d p p p Fig. 3 Sensitivity analyses No pleiotropy was found by the MR-Egger regression intercept or the Cochran Q Reverse MR analysis When gut microbiota or signaling pathways were included as exposures, the genome-wide threshold for screening SNPs was set at 5 × 10 −10 p Discussion In this study, we revealed that CRS was associated with an increased risk for 7 gut microbiota taxa and a decreased risk for 5. CRS showed the most significant decreased risk association with Haemophilus parainfluenzae p Bilophila spp p N d p p The microbial genome of microbes that live on and within the human body, including the gastrointestinal system, urogenital tract, mouth cavity, nasal passages, and lungs, is referred to as the human microbiome. 22 23 24 25 26 27 5 , 28 , 29 Haemophilus parainfluenzae 30 31 29 2 32 33 Previous studies have elucidated a significant increase of Proteobacteria in various chronic inflammatory disorders, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, 34 35 36 37 38 CRS pathogenesis consists of damage to the epithelium barrier, compromised mucociliary clearance, and dysfunctional local host-environment interactions. 39 , 40 23 41 42 43 9 44 The species of the gut microbiota with alterations brought about by CRS differ from those described in earlier research because of different data sources and experimental methods. 8 , 9 L L d -N- d d L Our findings suggest that targeting the gut microbiota may offer novel therapeutic strategies for CRS treatment options. Some bacterial particles, vaccinations, bacterial lysates (dead cells), and live probiotic strains have been shown in studies to have immunostimulant characteristics. 9 , 45 46 , 47 In previously published observational studies, the small sample sizes, low levels of evidence, and inconsistencies at baseline lead to questionable reliability of results. Excluding the effect of confounding factors (antibiotic usage and aging), our study investigated the causal relationship between CRS and gut microbiome and drew more reliable conclusions. This study also has some limitations. First, the population included in this study was European, and the lack of data on other ethnicities may have implications for our causality. The genetic makeup of various populations may produce differing outcomes that call for additional research. Second, our investigation only utilized datasets related to CRS without the phenotypes or endotypes of CRS. This issue may influence the outcomes, especially considering the pathophysiological differences among CRS endotypes. Our understanding of the relationship between CRS and gut flora would be enhanced by additional studies exploring the effects of different endotypes of CRS. Finally, even with the use of SNPs as a proxy for reducing potential bias, the underlying processes of the causal relationships shown in the study need to be further confirmed in well-designed investigations, such as experimental mechanistic research models. Conclusions In conclusion, we found the variations in the risk of Haemophilus and Bilophila within the Proteobacteria in CRS patients, indicating that CRS may modify the optimal intestinal environment for Proteobacteria. Our study showed that CRS increases the risk of gut microbiome dysbiosis, potentially serving as a risk factor for alterations in gut microbiome composition and disruptions in gut microbiota-related metabolic pathways. This finding provides additional support for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between CRS and the gut microbiome.
