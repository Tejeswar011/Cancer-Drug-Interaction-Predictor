See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ BACKGROUND The albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score was developed as a prognostic tool for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its new role as an indicator of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients is under investigation. AIM To investigate the ALBI score as a non-invasive means of assessing the extent of liver fibrosis in chronic HCV patients. METHODS We evaluated hospital records of 231 eligible chronic HCV patients from King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Buraydah, Saudi Arabia. Demographic/clinical data, liver function tests, non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis, and ALBI score/grades were evaluated before and two years after direct-acting antivirals (DAA) treatment. RESULTS The median ALBI score improved from -2.51 to -2.62 after DAA treatment ( P P P P CONCLUSION The ALBI score appears to be a useful non-invasive marker for assessing liver fibrosis in chronic HCV patients and may serve as a valuable tool for monitoring hepatic function during and after DAA treatment.

One such marker is the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, calculated based on serum total bilirubin and serum albumin. It was developed as a prognostic marker for patients with HCC[ 10 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 20 23 MATERIALS AND METHODS Study design and participants We conducted a hospital records-based study at King Fahad Specialist Hospital in Buraydah, Qassim, Saudi Arabia, where a sample of 231 eligible adult patients (98 men, 133 women) with a chronic HCV diagnosis were selected. The study was approved by the Ministry of Health’s Regional Research Ethics Committee - Qassim Province, Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia (Approval No. 1441-667587) and received administrative permission from the hospital to gain access to its patient records. All selected patients had received one of the locally available HCV DAA regimens and completed a two-year follow-up after the end of their treatment. Patients were excluded from the study if they had alternative documented causes of liver disease (other than HCV) such as co-infection with hepatitis B virus, human immunodeficiency virus, autoimmune hepatitis, metabolic disorders, Wilson’s disease, hemochromatosis, and/or alcohol-related liver disease, or concomitant liver or biliary cancers, end organ failure, and/or were pregnant. Data extraction Data for all study variables were obtained from hospital records, including demographic and clinical data such as age, gender, alcohol intake, liver cirrhosis status, presence of hepatic/portal hypertension complications, type of DAA used, achieved sustained virological response, and comorbidities. Laboratory values before and two years after DAA treatment, including serum ALT, AST, bilirubin, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, alpha fetoprotein, HCV RNA viral load, HCV genotype, complete blood count, activated partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio were obtained as well. The ALBI score was calculated using each patient’s serum levels of albumin and bilirubin with the following formula: ALBI score = [logarithm base 10 bilirubin (μmol/L) × 0.66] + [albumin (g/L) × (-0.0852)]. Then the patients were stratified into three grades based on their ALBI scores: Grade I (≤ -2.60), grade II (> -2.60 to ≤ -1.39), and grade III (> -1.39)[ 10 9 9 6 24 Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS version 28 (Chicago, IL, United Stated). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the data normality.

DISCUSSION Our study presents new data that can fill the knowledge gaps regarding the ALBI score’s predictive value for liver fibrosis severity in patients with chronic HCV infection. To our knowledge, this is the first study to give these predictive values for the ALBI score against liver fibrosis stages defined noninvasively by FibroScan. In addition, we evaluated the ALBI score’s diagnostic value against recognized biological NITs of liver fibrosis (AST/ALT ratio, APRI and FIB-4). In our study, the ALBI score had significant improvement following DAA treatment and preserved a positive correlation with biological NITs of liver fibrosis (AST/ALT ratio, APRI, and FIB-4 scores) before and after DAA treatment. Johnson et al 25 Taking FibroScan as a yardstick, the ALBI score successfully discriminated between advanced and non-advanced fibrosis, a finding that opens the door for using the ALBI score in the battle against liver fibrosis. This adds to recent research in this regard[ 26 2 5 P et al 27 via 27 28 Moreover, our multivariate linear regression analysis model revealed that the ALBI score has the highest positive correlation, in relation to the other standard NITs, for predicting the extent of liver fibrosis, which further supports its future value in this regard. Alongside the above, it is worth noting that most biological NITs for liver fibrosis have limitations regarding their sensitivity values, as reported in multiple studies[ 8 29 25 27 Recent studies have found a positive correlation between the ALBI score and inflammatory markers/indices, such as the peripheral inflammatory cell ratios in patients with HCC[ 30 Study limitations The study had a relatively small sample size, and its retrospective nature did not allow for optimum follow-up of the patients or precise prediction of the factors associated with the ALBI score’s improvement. In addition, only baseline FibroScan results were recorded in the system for the patients. Study strength This study is one of the few studies to provide data on the ALBI score’s predictive value in detecting the degree of liver fibrosis in relation to FibroScan. In fact, our research was generated based on researchers’ recommendations to fill the knowledge gaps related to ALBI score’s predictivity as mentioned in the limitation sections of previous studies[ 27 31 CONCLUSION The ALBI score could be used as an indicator of the degree of liver fibrosis and liver function in patients with chronic HCV infection who are treated with DAA. Future larger prospective studies are required for better assessment of the diagnostic and predictive value of the ALBI score for liver fibrosis and function.
