Heterologous prime–boost vaccination has emerged as a promising approach to enhance immune responses by combining vaccines with complementary mechanisms of antigen delivery and immune activation. Here, we evaluated the immunogenicity of heterologous regimens combining the licensed inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (VLA2001) with the replication-deficient Orf virus-based vector vaccine (Prime-2-CoV). Using a mouse model, we compared these regimens to homologous vaccinations with each vaccine alone. Among the combinations tested, priming with VLA2001 followed by boosting with Prime-2-CoV induced the strongest spike-specific antibody responses, superior ACE2-binding inhibition against pre-Omicron variants, and robust Th1-biased immunity, with robust CD4 + + Orf virus viral vector vaccines heterologous prime-boost SARS-CoV-2 VLA2001 Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen 10.13039/501100002345 The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

They offer broad immune activation, excellent safety profiles, even in vulnerable populations, and practical advantages in storage and distribution. However, because they rely on exogenously administered antigens, classical inactivated vaccines typically induce strong humoral responses but elicit only limited cellular immunity. To overcome this limitation, advanced formulations incorporate immunostimulatory adjuvants. A prominent example is Valneva’s inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine VLA2001 ( 14 15 We previously described a novel vaccine platform based on a highly attenuated Orf virus vector (ORFV), derived from the D1701-VrV strain of the Parapoxvirus 16 17 18 19 20 21 21 29  Figure 1A 16 in vivo 20 17 30 Figure 1  In vitro (A) (B) (C) Diagram displays Prime-2-CoV virus genomic structure and staining analysis. Panel A shows genome locations for Spike and Nucleocapsid. Panel B includes flow cytometry plots for Spike+ and Nucleocapsid+ staining across different conditions. Panel C presents cell surface and intracellular staining images showing expression of Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins, with nucleic acid visualized in blue. To explore the potential immunological synergy between these two complementary vaccine technologies, we evaluated heterologous prime–boost regimens combining Prime-2-CoV and VLA2001 using SARS-CoV-2 as a clinically relevant and immunologically well-characterized model. We compared this heterologous strategy with homologous two-dose regimens in which each vaccine was administered alone. Humoral and cellular immune responses were assessed, including neutralization capacity against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, to determine whether the combination elicited an improved immunogenicity profile. Our findings support the concept that heterologous vaccination can enhance immune protection by leveraging the distinct strengths of different vaccine platforms. 2 Materials and methods 2.1  In vitro To evaluate antigen expression by the ORFV-based vaccine vector Prime-2-CoV via flow cytometry, Vero cells were seeded into 24-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) at a density of 2 × 10 5 ® For immunofluorescence microscopy, 4 × 10 4 2.2 Ethics and animals Animal housing and experimental procedures were conducted in strict accordance to Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations recommendations and followed the guidelines of the Regional councils. Experiments were conducted by Synovo GmbH, Tübingen, Germany and all animal procedures (including surgery, anesthesia and euthanasia, as applicable) used in the current study were approved by the regional authority under the Project License Nr. 35/9185.81-7/SYN 12/20. 2.3 Immunization The ORFV-based vaccine vector Prime-2-CoV, encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins of the ancestral Wuhan strain, was prepared as previously described ( 16 We chose an outbred strain to better approximate genetic diversity and reduce strain-specific biases in humoral and T-cell readouts, which is common practice in vaccine immunogenicity screens ( 31 6 8 2 2.4 Detection of specific serum IgG by ELISA Spike-, nucleocapsid (N)- and ORFV-binding antibodies were quantified in mouse serum samples using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Nunc Maxisorp 96-well plates (Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) were coated overnight at 4°C with 5 μg/ml of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein (cat. no. 40589-V08B1, Sino Biological) or N protein (cat. no. 40588-V08B, Sino Biological) or 10 7 10 10 2.5 RBDCoV-ACE2 RBDCoV-ACE2, a previously published multiplex ACE2 inhibition assay ( 32 33 36 2.6 Intracellular cytokine staining Cryopreserved splenocytes were thawed, rested for 4 hours at 37°C in complete RPMI medium, and seeded into 96-well round-bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) at a density of 2 × 10 6 ® 2.7 Germinal center B cells and T follicular helper cells Cryopreserved splenocytes were thawed and rested for 4 hours at 37°C in complete RPMI medium. To block Fc receptors, cells were incubated with TruStain FcX™ (anti-mouse CD16/32, cat. no. 101320, BioLegend) for 10 minutes at room temperature. Surface staining was then performed for 30 minutes at 4°C using an antibody cocktail targeting the following markers: CD3ϵ (cat. no. 100320), CD4 (cat. no. 100531), CD8α (cat. no. 100730), CD62L (cat. no. 104406), CD44 (cat. no. 103032), CD19 (cat. no. 115530), CXCR5 (cat. no. 145529), PD-1 (cat. no. 135220), and GL7 (cat. no. 144608), along with Zombie Aqua™ Fixable Viability Dye (cat. no. 423102, all BioLegend). Samples were acquired on an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed using FlowJo ® 2.8 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Normality of data distributions was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Group comparisons were conducted using the Mann–Whitney U test or Kruskal–Wallis test, as appropriate. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical significance is indicated as follows: *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001; ****p < 0.0001. Data are presented as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM), geometric mean with geometric standard deviation (SD), or medians, as indicated in the figure legends. 3 Results 3.1 Spike and nucleocapsid antigen expression from Prime-2-CoV The Prime-2-CoV vaccine candidate used in this study was previously described ( 16 37 38 To confirm antigen expression, Vero cells were infected with Prime-2-CoV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 16 hours in the presence or absence of cytosine arabinoside (AraC), a DNA synthesis inhibitor that blocks late viral gene expression. ORFV-Mock-infected cells served as controls. Flow cytometry analysis revealed robust spike antigen production, detectable both at the cell surface and intracellularly (  Figure 1B These findings were supported by fluorescence microscopy, demonstrating spike localization on the cell surface and intracellular expression of both spike and N proteins, consistent with observations from flow cytometry (  Figure 1C 3.2 Spike-specific IgG responses To assess the immunogenicity of heterologous prime-boost vaccination regimens combining a novel Orf virus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Prime-2-CoV with the inactivated and adjuvanted whole-virus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Valneva VLA2001, we immunized mice using various homologous and heterologous prime-boost combinations (  Figure 2A Figure 2 Humoral immune responses following homologous and heterologous immunization with Prime-2-CoV and VLA2001 in CD-1 mice.

We first evaluated spike-specific IgG responses by ELISA. A single immunization with 10 6  Figure 2B 3.3 Nucleocapsid-specific IgG responses We next examined antibody responses against the N protein. Here, we observed a distinct pattern. As a whole-virus vaccine, VLA2001 effectively primed N-specific IgG responses, with significantly higher levels than a single dose of Prime-2-CoV (  Figure 2C 3.4 IgG subclass profiles and Th1 bias To evaluate the qualitative nature of the humoral response and infer T helper cell polarization, we assessed the ratio of IgG2a to IgG1 in serum samples. All vaccination regimens elicited a predominant IgG2a response over IgG1, indicative of a Th1-skewed immune profile (  Figures 2D, E 3.5 ORFV-specific IgG responses To assess the immunogenicity of the ORFV vector itself, we measured antibody responses against Prime-2-CoV. A single immunization induced detectable ORFV-specific IgG in mice, with markedly increased titers observed following a second homologous dose (  Supplementary Figure S1A  Supplementary Figures S1B, C 3.6 ACE2 binding inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern We next evaluated the functional capacity of vaccine-induced antibodies to inhibit ACE2 binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 VoC using the RBDCoV-ACE2 assay.

ACE2 binding inhibition (%) in serum was measured at two time points: day 14 (two weeks after the first immunization) and day 35 (two weeks after the second immunization). Inhibition was assessed against the following RBD variants: (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) Graphs A to E display ACE2 binding inhibition percentages for various virus strains (WT, Beta, Delta, BA.2, XBB.1.5) on days 14 and 35 across different vaccine combinations, with annotations for statistical significance. Graph F is a radial chart comparing the binding inhibition across the same virus strains for four vaccine strategies. Homologous boosting with VLA2001 did not appreciably increase ACE2 binding inhibition relative to priming alone. In contrast, heterologous boosting of VLA2001-primed animals with Prime-2-CoV significantly enhanced ACE2 binding inhibition of pre-Omicron VoC, indicating a synergistic effect of this prime-boost direction. While boosting Prime-2-CoV-primed animals with VLA2001 also improved responses, the effect was less pronounced, reinforcing the superior boosting capacity of Prime-2-CoV. Among all tested regimens, two doses of Prime-2-CoV induced the highest levels of ACE2 binding inhibition against 4 out of 5 tested VoC (  Figure 3F 3.7 Germinal center B cells and Tfh cell responses The formation of germinal centers (GCs) and interactions with T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are crucial for the generation of high-affinity antibodies and long-lived memory B cells. We evaluated the presence of GC B cells and their interaction with Tfh cells in spleen. All vaccine regimens, regardless of combination, induced comparable frequencies of GC B cells and Tfh cells engaging in GC interactions (  Supplementary Figure S2A 3.8 CD4 + To further characterize the cellular arm of the immune response, we analyzed antigen-specific CD4 + + +  Figure 4A + + Figure 4 Antigen-specific CD4 + 6 (A, B) + ex vivo (A) (B) (C, D) + (C) (D) (A, B) (E, F) (E) + (F) + Graphs and heatmaps show immune responses in different vaccination groups.

We pre-specified an intramuscular, clinically aligned immunogenicity screen to test for sequence-dependent synergy between two distinct platforms. Among the combinations tested, priming with VLA2001 followed by boosting with Prime-2-CoV elicited the most robust and broadly reactive immune responses, with a favorable Th1 bias. These results underscore the versatility and immunopotency of ORFV vectors and support their use as adaptable components in future heterologous vaccination strategies. A key observation is the strong spike-specific antibody response induced by the VLA2001/Prime-2-CoV combination. This heterologous regimen matched or exceeded responses observed with homologous Prime-2-CoV vaccination and outperformed homologous VLA2001. Notably, even a single low-dose immunization with Prime-2-CoV elicited stronger responses than a subdose of VLA2001, underscoring the potent immunogenicity of the ORFV-based vector. Importantly, Prime-2-CoV was particularly effective as a booster following VLA2001 priming, whereas the reverse sequence was less immunogenic. This order dependence likely reflects non-redundant platform biology—including distinct antigen production kinetics, compartmentalization of antigen presentation, and adjuvant signatures—that are optimally combined when whole-virus priming precedes vector boosting. Consistent with these findings, ACE2 binding inhibition assays indicated superior neutralizing activity against pre-Omicron VoC in animals receiving Prime-2-CoV-containing regimens. The heterologous VLA2001/Prime-2-CoV combination outperformed homologous VLA2001, supporting a sequence-dependent improvement with this prime-boost strategy. Although neutralizing responses against Omicron-lineage VoC were generally reduced, homologous Prime-2-CoV vaccination achieved the highest inhibition among the groups, underscoring its broad neutralizing potential. These differences are likely attributable to distinct antigen designs. Prime-2-CoV expresses a pre-fusion stabilized spike protein (D614G, K986P/V987P, furin site deletion) ( 38 16 14 All Prime-2-CoV–containing regimens induced strong, polyfunctional CD4 + + 39 40 In addition to spike, Prime-2-CoV also encodes the nucleocapsid antigen. While VLA2001 alone was able to prime nucleocapsid-specific IgG and CD4 + 2 41 42 43 45 44 45 46 47 In contrast to CD4 + + In vitro in vivo + + + 48 + 49 These findings suggest that re-engineering nucleocapsid expression for stronger early-phase activity may enhance antigen availability and increase the magnitude of N-specific immune responses. However, elevated N expression has been associated with immunopathology in preclinical models and should be carefully evaluated ( 46 50 Consistent with earlier data ( 16 51 52 53 17 All tested regimens induced a Th1-biased immune profile, as indicated by elevated IgG2a/IgG1 ratios and antigen-specific IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-2 secretion by CD4 + 14 Despite comparable frequencies of germinal-center B cells and T-follicular-helper cells in all groups, the heterologous VLA2001/Prime-2-CoV combination elicited the strongest antibody responses. Thus, while the key cellular machinery of affinity maturation is engaged by every regimen, the order and nature of the prime and boost decisively shape the magnitude and breadth of the humoral response. Pre-existing immunity to spike or nucleocapsid antigens does not influence the immunogenicity of either when delivered by whole-virus and ORFV vector platforms. We did not observe correlations between pre-boost N-specific IgG (day 21) and post-boost spike-specific IgG titers (day 35), or vice versa, nor between spike- and N-specific IgG titers after boost (  Supplementary Figures S3A-C +  Figure 4C +  Figure 4D + +  Supplementary Figures S3D-F + + + +  Supplementary Figure S3G + + + +  Supplementary Figure S3H Our findings align with growing evidence supporting the immunological benefits of heterologous vaccination. For instance, Barros-Martins et al. ( 11 12 54 55 Real-world and clinical studies have shown that inactivated vaccines can substantially benefit from heterologous boosting. For instance, priming with inactivated CoronaVac followed by a ChAdOx1-S booster induced stronger antibody responses compared to homologous CoronaVac vaccination, whereas the reverse sequence, ChAdOx1-S priming followed by CoronaVac boosting, was considerably less effective ( 56 57 58 Beyond immunological efficacy, heterologous strategies offer practical advantages for public health. They increase flexibility in vaccine deployment, enable better use of existing supply chains, and may mitigate platform-specific limitations. For example, adenovirus-based vaccines have been linked to rare but serious adverse events such as vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia, limiting their use in some populations ( 59 Our results further support incorporating multiple viral antigens, beyond spike, in vaccine designs. While spike remains the primary target of neutralizing antibodies, conserved internal proteins, such as nucleocapsid, may broaden immune protection ( 60 62 16 60 63 65 66 68 60 63 64 2 41 69 71 60 72 60 66 73 69 74 60 66 73 72 75 72 76 77 75 This study has several limitations. It is a preclinical proof−of−concept in mice without viral challenge. Vaccinations were administered intramuscularly to mirror the clinical use of both platforms; accordingly, we focused on systemic readouts and did not analyze mucosal compartments such as lung tissue, lung-draining lymph nodes, or bronchoalveolar lavage. Neutralizing antibodies were assessed using an ACE2-RBD competitive inhibition assay as opposed to pseudo- or live-virus based neutralization assays. While it does not directly measure neutralization, such assays have been used by several other groups ( 78 80 34 + While our study focused on intramuscular administration to mirror clinical use, the site of acquisition for SARS-CoV-2 is the respiratory mucosa ( 81 74 26 82 83 84 Beyond SARS-CoV-2, the ORFV platform’s capacity to express multiple immunogenic antigens and induce strong Th1-biased immune responses makes it an attractive technology for vaccines against other pathogens that demand broad and durable immunity. In summary, Prime-2-CoV is as a potent booster vaccine when combined with VLA2001 in a heterologous prime-boost regimen. This combination elicited strong spike- and nucleocapsid-specific immune responses with favorable Th1 polarization. Within the scope of this intramuscular immunogenicity screen, these data support advancing ORFV-based vectors as adaptable components of heterologous vaccination strategies beyond COVID-19. The platform warrants evaluation against other respiratory pathogens where breadth and durable T-cell immunity are priorities. Future work should establish durability and protection and, for respiratory viruses, quantify airway mucosal immunity and test targeted intranasal boosting strategies.
