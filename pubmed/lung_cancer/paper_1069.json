They may precede cancer diagnosis or signal its recurrence, highlighting their potential value as early warning signs. Their recognition is critical for timely diagnosis and appropriate management. Methods We performed a systematic review of case reports and case series published between 2010 and 2023 in PubMed database, focusing on six major syndromes: cancer-associated retinopathy (CAR), melanoma-associated retinopathy (MAR), bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP), acute exudative polymorphous paraneoplastic vitelliform maculopathy (AEPPVM), paraneoplastic uveitis (PU), and paraneoplastic optic neuropathy (PON). We extracted demographic, clinical, immunologic, oncologic, therapeutic, and outcome-related data. Results A total of 132 articles comprising 147 patients were included: 53 with CAR, 22 with MAR, 26 with BDUMP, 16 with AEPPVM, 11 with PU, and 19 with PON. Visual impairment was bilateral in over 90% of cases. The most frequently associated malignancies were lung cancers (notably small-cell lung carcinoma), gynecological cancers, and melanoma. Onconeural autoantibodies were tested in serum—most commonly revealing anti-recoverin and anti-alpha-enolase in CAR, and anti-CRMP5 in PON—but were never assessed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), despite its potential diagnostic value. Therapeutic approach was highly heterogeneous and largely empirical, with systemic corticosteroids being the most commonly used treatment. Visual prognosis varied but was especially poor in CAR, for which 49.1% of patients experienced worsening vision. Notably, in CAR, an early oncologic diagnosis (within 6 months after symptom onset) was significantly associated with a favorable visual outcome ( p Conclusion We identified a clinical profile of patients in whom paraneoplastic ocular syndromes should be suspected. These rare inflammatory disorders may serve as early indicators of malignancy. Further studies are needed to improve diagnostic pathways, optimize immunologic workup (including CSF testing), and guide therapeutic strategies.

They remain a rare entity, affecting only 0.01% of patients with malignancies [ 5 The eye is theoretically protected from pathogenic inflammatory reactions to prevent significant loss of function due to tissue damage. In this respect, several mechanisms contribute to its immunological privilege, providing a state of immune tolerance. These include secretion of intraocular immunosuppressive factors, major histocompatibility complex class II low expression, and effector T cells conversion into regulatory T cells, Programmed Death-Ligand 1 and Fas-Ligand expression, which induce apoptosis of immune cells [ 6 One explanation for the occurrence of ocular paraneoplastic disorders is based on the concept of “molecular mimicry”: a tumor may express some antigens similar to those naturally present in various organs, including the eye [ 7 8 Ocular paraneoplastic disorders can take different clinical forms. They represent an important warning signal and can sometimes precede the discovery of cancer, occur in parallel with its progression, or herald a recurrence. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive description of these ophthalmic inflammatory phenomena associated with cancer through a systematic review of the literature between 2010 and 2023. Methods The PubMed database was used to conduct a systematic literature review, using the keywords: “cancer-associated retinopathy”, “melanoma- associated retinopathy”, “paraneoplastic retinopathy” “bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation”, “paraneoplastic vitelliform retinopathy”, “paraneoplastic acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy”, “paraneoplastic uveitis”, “paraneoplastic optic neuropathy” and “paraneoplastic optic neuritis”. A single reviewer screened all abstracts retrieved to finalize article selection. The set of identified articles was cross-referenced with those retrieved from a search using the MESH term “paraneoplastic ocular syndromes “.  Inclusion criteria were: clinical case descriptions and clinical case series, published between January 2010 and December 2023, with an available abstract, in French and English. Exclusion criteria were: general reviews, pathophysiology articles, exclusive therapeutic reviews, and pediatric cases. Collected information included age, sex, age at diagnosis of the ophthalmic condition, age at oncological diagnosis, type of ophthalmic condition and associatedclinical and paraclinical data at diagnosis (visual acuity at diagnosis, slit-lamp examination, fundus examination, angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electroretinogram (ERG)), results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis, anterior chamber or vitreous biopsy, presence of circulating autoantibodies, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), data on local or systemic ophthalmic treatments (corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and biologic therapies), oncological and hematological diagnoses, their management (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, targeted therapy), and outcomes after treatment regarding ophthalmic and oncological conditions. The primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological characteristics of the population identified through the systematic literature review. The secondary aims were to describe clinical data related to ophthalmic conditions, biological data focusing on autoantibodies, investigate the timeline between ophthalmic conditions and cancer diagnosis, describe immunosuppressive treatments used for ophthalmic conditions, and assess the evolution of ophthalmic conditions in relation to cancer progression. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 5 ® Results Enrolled population A literature search of the PubMed database identified 481 articles related to ocular paraneoplastic syndromes published between 2010 and 2023. Among these 481 articles, 155 focused on cancer associated retinopathy (CAR, 32.2%), 83 on melanoma associated retinopathy (MAR, 17.3%), 48 on acute exudative polymorphous paraneoplastic vitelliform maculopathy (AEPPVM, 10%), 94 on bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP, 19.5%), 64 on paraneoplastic uveitis (PU, 13.3%), and 37 on paraneoplastic optic neuropathies (PON, 7.7%). Of the 481 articles initially identified, 287 were excluded (59.7%) according to predefined eligibility criteria: 58 were general reviews (20.2%), 20 were focused exclusively on therapeutics (7%), 36 were dedicated to pathophysiological mechanisms (12.5%), 155 described non-paraneoplastic inflammatory ophthalmic conditions (54%), 4 involved pediatric patients (1.4%), and 2 were duplicate reports (0.7%). Ultimately, from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2023, 132 case reports or case series were included in this systematic literature review, comprising: 48 articles on CAR, 22 on MAR, 14 on AEPPVM, 21 on BDUMP, 11 on paraneoplastic uveitis, and 16 on paraneoplastic optic neuropathies (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Flow chart of reports selected according to PRISMA guidelines. CAR: Carcinoma associated retinopathy, MAR: Melanoma associated retinopathy, AEPPVM: Acute exudative paraneoplastic polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy, BDUMP: Bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation, PU: paraneoplastic uveitis, PON: paraneoplastic optic neuropathy.

Among patients with paraneoplastic uveitis and paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, involvement was also predominantly bilateral, but to a lesser extent, at 72.7% and 78.9%, respectively. Decreased visual acuity was the most common symptom, observed in 100% of patients with BDUMP, AEPPVM, paraneoplastic uveitis and paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, in 83% of patients with CAR, and to a lesser extent in patients with MAR (77.3%). Half of the patients with MAR also reported hemeralopia and photopsia. Visual field defects were present in 75.5% of patients with CAR and 63.6% of those with MAR. Among patients with CAR, 13% had associated uveitis, which was panuveitis in over 70% of these cases. In patients with paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, 36.8% also presented with uveitis, all of which were isolated intermediate uveitis. Retinal vessel vasculitis, predominantly venous vasculitis, was observed in 24.5% of patients with CAR and in 9.1% of those with paraneoplastic uveitis. In addition, involvement of the outer segment of the photoreceptors and of the ellipsoid zone on OCT was noted in 37.9% of patients with CAR. A serous retinal detachment, consistent with the relevant pathologies, was observed in 68% of patients with BDUMP and in 68.8% of those with AEPPVM. Mixed cone and rod involvement on ERG was more frequently found in patients with CAR than in those with MAR (83.3% vs. 59.1%), whereas isolated rod involvement on ERG was more commonly observed in patients with MAR than in those with CAR (40.9% vs. 2.4%). Brain MRI was rarely performed across all paraneoplastic conditions and was mostly normal when conducted, except in cases of paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, where 31.6% of patients showed inflammatory signals involving the optic nerve (Table 1 Biological data The search for serum onconeural autoantibodies was mainly conducted in patients with CAR, MAR, and paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, with testing rates of 71.7%, 72.7%, and 94.7%, respectively. On the other hand, it was less frequently performed in patients with paraneoplastic uveitis, with a testing rate of 27.3%. Antibody testing in the cerebrospinal fluid has never been performed. In patients with CAR, anti-alpha-enolase antibodies (42.9%) and anti-recoverin antibodies (32.1%) were the most commonly detected. In patients with MAR, anti-TRPM-1 antibodies were the most frequently identified (35.7%). Among patients with paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, anti-CRMP5 antibodies were found in 92.3% of cases. Lumbar puncture usage varied according to the underlying pathology. It was performed in only 13% of patients with CAR and not at all in those with MAR, BDUMP, or AEPPVM. In contrast, lumbar puncture was more frequently performed in patients with paraneoplastic uveitis and paraneoplastic optic neuropathy with respective rates of 36.4% and 57.9%. In cases of paraneoplastic uveitis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was always normal when it was performed. In patients with paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, around one-third of the patients presented increased CSF protein.

At the time of ophthalmic diagnosis, 15% of patients with CAR had evidence of metastatic disease. By definition, 100% of cancers associated with MAR are melanomas. At the time of the ophthalmic diagnosis, 68.2% of patients had metastatic melanoma, and 31.8% had a recurrence which was metastatic in over 90% of cases. In patients with BDUMP, the most commonly associated cancer type was also lung cancer (42.3%), followed by gynecological cancers (19.2%) and urological cancers (19.2%). At the time of the ophthalmic diagnosis, metastatic involvement was present in 38.5% of cases. In patients with AEPPVM, melanomas were the most frequently associated cancers (50%), followed by multiple myelomas (31.3%). At the time of the ophthalmic diagnosis, 62.5% of patients (with non-hematologic cancers) had metastatic involvement. Paraneoplastic uveitis was predominantly associated with pulmonary cancers (36.4%) and lymphomas (27.3%). At the time of the ophthalmic diagnosis, the malignancy was metastatic in 27.3% of cases. In patients with paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, lung cancer was also the most frequently diagnosed cancer, affecting 63.9% of patients. At the time of the ophthalmic diagnosis, the oncological involvement was metastatic in 31.6% of cases. In most cases, the oncological diagnosis was made after the onset of visual defect, except in patients with BDUMP and AEPPVM, where the underlying malignancy was already known in respectively 42.3% and 43.8% of cases at the time of ophthalmic involvement. The neoplasm was identified following the ophthalmic diagnosis in 81.1% of patients with CAR, 59.1% with MAR, 57.7% with BDUMP, 100% with paraneoplastic uveitis, and 78.9% with paraneoplastic optic neuropathy.

Systemic corticosteroids were the most commonly administered treatment. All patients with paraneoplastic uveitis and all those with paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, when they were treated, received systemic corticosteroids. Among treated patients with MAR, 85.7% received either oral or intravenous corticosteroids. In patients with CAR, 29.7% of treated patients received systemic corticosteroids, and 24.3% received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) at immunomodulatory doses. Among those treated for BDUMP, 77.8% underwent plasmapheresis and 33.3% received systemic corticosteroids. In the AEPPVM group, 85% of treated patients received systemic corticosteroids, and 57.1% received immunosuppressive treatment related to their underlying myeloma. (Table 3 Visual prognosis Visual prognosis was assessed based on the evolution of visual acuity, with a favorable outcome defined as either complete recovery or improvement, and an unfavorable outcome defined as stable or worsening visual impairment. In the group of patients with CAR, 49.1% had an unfavorable visual outcome, while 35.8% had a favorable one. Visual outcome was unavailable in 15.1% of cases. No correlation was observed between favorable visual prognosis and age, sex, type of visual symptoms, or the presence of retinal vasculitis. Immunosuppressive treatment, autoantibody positivity, presence of metastases at diagnosis, and the type of associated cancer were not predictive either. However, an early oncological diagnosis—within six months of ophthalmic symptoms onset—was significantly associated with a favorable visual outcome ( p 4 Table 4 Visual prognosis in subgroups patients with CAR Favorable visual outcome n Unfavorable visual outcome n p Mean age, years (SD) 64 (8.3) 62 (13) 0.8 Median age, years (IQR) 65 (12) 65 (14) 0.8 Female, n 11 (57.9) 16 (61.5) 0.8 Visual acuity loss, n 16 (84.2) 23 (88.5) 0.7 Visual field defect, n 14 (73.2) 19 (73.1) 0.9 Retinal vasculitis, n 4 (21.1) 6 (23.1) 0.9 Immunosuppressive treatment, n 14 (73.7) 16 (61.5) 0.5 Corticosteroids, n 13 (68.4) 15 (57.7) 0.5 Oncologic diagnosis < 6 months after visual involvement, n 17 (89.5) 16 (61.5) 0.03 Serum autoantibodies, n 8 (42.1) 13 (50) 0.6 Presence of metastases, n 4 (21.1) 4 (15.4) 0.7 Pulmonary neoplasm, n 9 (47.4) 9 (34.6) 0.4 Gynecological neoplasm, n 5 (26.3) 9 (34.6) 0.9 In the MAR group, 63.6% of patients experienced a favorable visual outcome, while 27.3% had an unfavorable outcome. No clinical or biological characteristic appeared to be associated with visual prognosis in patients with MAR. Among patients with BDUMP, half experienced a favorable visual outcome and the other half an unfavorable one. In the AEPPVM group, 50% of patients showed a favorable visual outcome, while 18.8% had an unfavorable outcome. For patients with paraneoplastic uveitis, 63.7% had a favorable outcome and 9.1% an unfavorable one. Finally, in patients with paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, 42.1% experienced a favorable visual outcome, while 26.3% had an unfavorable evolution. (Table 3 Discussion In this systematic review of inflammatory ocular paraneoplastic syndromes, we identified and analyzed 147 patients. These included 53 patients with CAR (36.1%), 22 with MAR (15%), 26 with BDUMP (17.7%), 16 with AEPPVM (10.9%), 11 with paraneoplastic uveitis (7.5%) and 19 with paraneoplastic optic neuropathy (12.9%). This review highlights the rarity of these conditions and raises the possibility of underdiagnosis. To date, no systematic review has covered the full spectrum of paraneoplastic ocular syndromes. However, a UK-based review focusing solely on CAR between 1984 and 2022 identified only 28 patients [ 9 The median age across these syndromes ranged from 58 to 68 years, with an overall median age of 64.5 years. These figures closely align with the median age at cancer diagnosis in France in 2023—70 years for men and 68 years for women [ 10 11 12 1 Geographically, most patients originated from Europe, North America, or Asia (mainly Japan). There was a clear underrepresentation of cases from Africa and South America, likely due to limited healthcare access and diagnostic limitations in those regions. In the majority of cases, paraneoplastic ocular manifestations were bilateral and resulted in significant visual acuity loss. CAR and MAR patients presented with more varied symptoms, including photopsia, photophobia, and dyschromatopsia. Night blindness was also more common in MAR, consistent with bipolar ON cell involvement, which is responsible for rod signal transmission. Visual impairment appeared to be less severe in MAR, in line with previously published data [ 1 Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was rarely performed, across all syndromes. Its diagnostic utility depends on the specific condition: in BDUMP and AEPPVM, where fundoscopic findings are characteristic, lumbar puncture offers limited additional information. In contrast, in cases like CAR, MAR, uveitis, and optic neuropathies, lumbar puncture may provide valuable diagnostic insight, although no formal guidelines currently recommend its routine use [ 13 14 15 16 2 6 17 18 19 20 21 22 Taken together, these findings show that antibody testing should serve as an adjunctive tool and be interpreted only in the appropriate clinical context—such as rapidly progressive bilateral vision loss with characteristic OCT and ERG abnormalities—rather than as a confirmatory diagnostic criterion. Their main value lies in reinforcing clinical suspicion in a compatible setting, particularly in older patients (> 60 years) with suspected paraneoplastic ophthalmic syndromes, where both serum and CSF testing may be considered. Most associated cancers were pulmonary, predominantly small-cell lung carcinomas. This finding is consistent with the literature, as lung cancer is the most common neoplasm in paraneoplastic syndromes [ 23 8 24 25 These findings highlight the internist’s role in diagnosing these rare syndromes. A paraneoplastic hypothesis should be considered in patients over 50 presenting with bilateral idiopathic ocular inflammation and visual decline, especially with cancer risk factors (smoking, alcohol use, environmental exposures). Early diagnosis enables treatment of the neoplasm at a potentially curable stage. Chest computed tomography (CT) is already recommended in adults over 50 with chronic non-infectious uveitis to exclude sarcoidosis [ 26 There is currently no consensus regarding treatment. Systemic corticosteroids were the most commonly used immunosuppressive treatment, despite limited high-quality evidence supporting their efficacy [ 1 27 28 29 30 CAR was frequently associated with a poor visual prognosis: 50% of patients worsened versus 35.8% improved. The evolution of the disease appeared independent of cancer control, and immunosuppressive therapies often failed to improve vision. In our series, early cancer diagnosis and prompt oncologic treatment were the only factors associated with better visual outcomes. In BDUMP, visual outcomes were mixed. Plasmapheresis appeared correlated with improvement. Other paraneoplastic eye conditions generally had more favorable visual outcomes, often better than their oncologic prognosis. In MAR, favorable visual outcomes may reflect effective melanoma treatment with visual improvement closely linked to tumor burden reduction [ 11 31 Our study has some limitations. The main limitation lies in the small sample sizes within each subgroup, most include fewer than 30 patients, with the exception of CAR ( n 5 Furthermore, our study also presents several strengths. This is the first systematic review to comprehensively address all paraneoplastic ocular syndromes. The long inclusion period (2010–2023) allows for meaningful follow-up, enabling the assessment of both visual and oncological outcomes. While not without limitations, this approach provides a broad and detailed understanding of the management of these rare conditions. This knowledge is crucial, as it may facilitate earlier oncological diagnosis and help prevent the inappropriate use of immunosuppressive therapies, which could potentially promote tumor progression. Conclusion Paraneoplastic ocular syndromes, although rare and under-researched, represent a significant diagnostic challenge due to their potential role as early indicators of cancer or cancer recurrence. Early recognition may allow for faster cancer diagnosis and better visual prognosis. In this context, this study presents a systematic review of the scientific literature from 2010 to 2023. These findings help define the clinical contexts in which paraneoplastic syndromes should be suspected, and highlight the diagnostic value of a multidisciplinary approach. In conclusion, this work lays a foundation for improving the understanding and management of these syndromes. It emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and multidisciplinary care. It also advocates for structured initiatives—such as national patient registries—to refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Enhancing patient outcomes will require better care coordination and continued clinical research on these rare but revealing conditions. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.
