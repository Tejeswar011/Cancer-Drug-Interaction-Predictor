Figure 2 2 3 2 3 Figure 2 2 3 Figure 2 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 Figure 2 In this study, the incorporation of GOx into the INTG heterojunction was expected to eliminate glucose and transform it into oxidative H 2 2 42 Figure 2 Figure S2 Figure 2 2 - 2 2 Verification of the pro-oxidative effect and mechanism of the INTG heterojunction The pro-oxidative effect of the INTG heterojunction is attributed to the incorporation of the INT heterojunction. In the present study, a density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed to reveal the pro-oxidative mechanism, with a focus on the generation and transfer of electrons. The constructed theoretical model is shown in Figure 3 2 3 3 2 2 Figure 3 2 3 3 2 3 2 43 low upp To further explore the structural optimization, the total and partial density of states (DOS) at the interfaces of the INT heterojunction were systematically calculated ( Figure 3 3 2 Figure 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 2 3 Figure 2 An oxygen adsorption model was constructed for further verification. As shown in Figure 3 ads ads 2 3 Figure 3 1 2 2 - Preparation of INTG-laden GelMA hydrogels and double-layer MNs Characterization of INTG-laden GelMA hydrogels In this study, four types of hydrogels (GM, GIO, GTC and GITG) were prepared using ultraviolet (UV)-mediated crosslinking 44 Figure 4 45 2 3 3 2 Figure 4 The physical properties of the hydrogels were comprehensively characterized. The hydrophilicity was assessed via water contact angle measurements ( Figure 4 Figure S3 P Figure 4 Figure 4 Characterization of INTG-laden double-layer MNs As in our previous report 46 47 Figure 4 Figure S4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure S5 48 51 Thus, PTT is useful in terms of accelerating diabetic wound healing. In this study, the photothermal effect of GITG MN was effectively regulated by the NIR light ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Biocompatibility evaluations of INTG-laden double-layer MN The biocompatibility of the microneedles was evaluated using a subcutaneous transplantation model in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. As shown in Figure 4 in vivo Figure S6 P 52 53 Blood and organ samples from the treated SD rats were also collected for a series of biocompatibility tests. Blood biochemical tests indicated that the levels of each indicator were within the normal range ( Figure 4 P Figure S7 Figure S8 GITG MN have pro-oxidative nanozyme-like activity under NIR irradiation The above results demonstrated the pro-oxidative properties of the INTG heterojunction. Owing to its lower oxygen adsorption energy (-3.01 eV) and heterojunction structure, the INTG heterojunction can generate oxidative ·OH, 1 2 2 - Figure 5 1 2 2 - Figure 5 Figure 5 1 2 2 - As shown in Figure 5 2 2 2 2 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure S10 Figure S10 P Figure 5 2 2 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure S10 Figure S10 P 2 2 Glutathione (GSH) is the most important antioxidant against oxidative stress in organisms, including bacteria. To evaluate GSH oxidation capacity, we performed the 5,5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB) assay, the common method for GSH quantification ( Figure 5 2 2 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure S10 Figure S10 GITG MN capable of eliminating bacterial infection and bacterial biofilms Evaluation of a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity GITG MN combined with PTT (GITG/N) can generate a large amount of ROS, representing a promising approach for antibacterial and antibiofilm treatment 54 E. coli S. aureus 55 Figure 6 E. coli S. aureus Figure S9 2 3 The bacterial survival ability was evaluated via a colony formation assay ( Figure 6 E. coli S. aureus Figure 6 E. coli S. aureus Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Evaluation of antibacterial and antibiofilm activities Bacterial biofilms are a primary cause of recurrent infections in diabetic patients. Live bacteria produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) and adhere to the surface of the substrate, forming a drug resistance barrier 56 57 Figure 6 E. coli S. aureus P Figure 6 Bacterial autoaggregation is one of the key factors contributing to the shaping and maturation of biofilm communities and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) is another key factor to form biofilms, maintain the stability of biofilm skeleton and protect bacteria in biofilms from the damage of antibacterial drugs. Therefore, the bacterial autoaggregation experiment and EPS detection experiment were conducted. Figure S11 E. coli S. aureus E. coli S. aureus Figure S12 These results suggested that GITG/N treatment has effectively inhibited the proliferation, survival and bacterial biofilm formation of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The broad-spectrum antibacterial and antibiofilm activities of GITG/N treatment are attributed mainly to the burst of ROS generated by the GITG MN. Moreover, the incorporation of mild PTT might also increase the sensitivity of bacteria to ROS 58 GITG MN accelerate diabetic wound healing An S. aureus in vivo Figure 7 Figure S13 59 Figure 7 in vivo in vivo The wounds almost healed within 14 days, as shown in photographs of the wound sites ( Figure 7 Figure 7 P Figure 7 The antibacterial effects of the different materials were verified in vivo Figure 8 Figure S14 60 61 Neo-skin tissue was resected for a series of IF staining analyses. On Day 4, markers of oxidative stress (ROS) and inflammatory intensity (IL6 and CD45) were detected ( Figure 8 Figure S16 P Figure 8 Figure S16 P Figure 8 Figure S16 P Figure 8 In summary, the GITG/N treatment has accelerated diabetic wound healing via antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, thereby improving cell proliferation, vascularization, collagen deposition and remodeling. However, the GITG/N treatment showed limited effects on wound ROS levels. In this study, ROS were only produced under NIR irradiation and quickly reacted with bacteria or were eliminated. The GITG/N group typically showed no detectable ROS production without NIR irradiation. The GTIG/N group also depleted glucose via GOx, which inhibited bacterial survival and proliferation, thereby alleviating oxidative stress injury and maintaining good biocompatibility. Conclusions This study developed double-layer GITG MN with broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifilm properties to enhance diabetic wound healing, while maintaining excellent biocompatibility. An INTG heterojunction was immobilized onto the GITG MN tip arrays for transdermal delivery, functioning as a nano-micro platform to amplify ROS and deplete glucose. The INTG heterojunction structure enhanced the oxygen absorption ability, promoted the transfer of photogenerated electrons, and increased the production of ROS. The combination of GITG MN with mild PTT (GITG/N) has effectively inhibited bacterial proliferation and survival, and prevented the formation of bacterial biofilms by producing a burst of ROS. The overall antibacterial effect of GITG/N treatment was comparable to that of sensitive antibiotics, such as ampicillin.

X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO MPD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nexus 670) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB 250XI) were used to determine the material composition. The heterojunction structure of INTG was verified via UV-visible absorption spectroscopy (PE lambda 750), valence band X-ray diffraction (VB-XPS, X'Pert PRO MPD), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL, FLS980 Series of Fluorescence Spectrometers) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200X). Verification of the pro-oxidative effect and mechanism The structural model of the INT heterojunction was constructed based on first principles calculations. Details of the DFT calculation are provided in the supporting information 2 - 1 2 Preparation and characterization of INTG-laden GelMA hydrogels and double-layer microneedles GelMA was obtained by crosslinking gelatin and MA, according to our previously reported methods. In brief, 2 g of GelMA was dissolved in 8 mL of water to prepare a 20 wt% GelMA solution. Next, 20 mg of INTG was added to the mixture, and a solution of INTG-laden GelMA was obtained after magnetic stirring for 30 min and centrifugation. The obtained solution was poured into the corresponding mold and cross-linked under UV light (500 W) for 5 min, yielding a hydrogel named GITG. For comparison, GelMA hydrogel, GelMA/Ti 3 2 2 3 The gel-forming process of the hydrogels was recorded using a phone camera, and the morphology of the hydrogels was observed by SEM. A compressive test was performed with an electronic universal testing machine (CMT6103), and the water contact angle was measured using a contact angle tester (Dataphysics OCA20). To evaluate the swelling capacity and the time required to reach swelling equilibrium, freeze-dried hydrogels from each group were first weighed and then immersed in saline solution. The mass was recorded at different time points, and the water uptake ratio was calculated. Double-layer microneedles of GITG were synthesized according to the following three steps. Firstly, to obtain the needle tip layer, the INTG-laden GelMA solution was poured into the mold, and air bubbles were removed using a vacuum drying oven. The solution containing bubbles in the upper layer was carefully removed using a cotton swab. Secondly, a 20 wt% GelMA solution was added to the upper layer of the mold and gelled using UV light (500 W) for 5 min. Finally, the double-layer microneedles were prepared after drying and demolding. The other experimental methods are provided in the supporting information Statistical analysis Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). For comparisons between two independent groups, independent-sample t-tests were employed, while multiple group comparisons were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc test when significant main effects were detected. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software version 21.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA).
