Background The gut microbiome is a vital component of an organism’s health, influencing metabolism, immune function, and overall homeostasis. In this study, we aimed to characterize the gut microbiota of healthy domestic short-hair cats in South Korea and evaluate the effects of age, body condition score (BCS), sex, and diet on microbial composition. Methods From August to December 2023, 40 healthy cats aged 1–14 years with a body condition score (BCS) of 5–9 were selected. Cats were excluded if they had taken probiotics or antibiotics, exhibited gastrointestinal symptoms within the last 6 months, or had blood work abnormalities. DNA quantification was performed, and libraries targeting the V3 and V4 regions were prepared according to the Illumina 16S metagenomic sequencing protocol with a read length of 2 × 300 bp. The relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum, genus, and species levels was assessed according to the age, sex, diet, and BCS of the cats, with major bacterial groups selected for chart analysis. Results Examination of the fecal samples from 40 healthy cats (aged 0.5–14 years) using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed 2,721 bacterial amplicon sequence variants. The predominant phyla were Bacillota, Bacteroidota, and Actinomycetota. Although age did not significantly affect alpha diversity, a trend toward increased diversity was observed in cats aged 7–14 years.

Consequently, in this study, we aimed to analyze the gut microbiota of healthy KSH cats living in South Korea and evaluate whether age, sex, BCS, and diet significantly impact its composition, providing insights into factors that influence the composition of the feline gut microbiome. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Animals and metadata collection All experimental procedures were approved by the Seoul National University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (approval number: SNU-231010-4) and adhered to the university’s ethical guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. This study was designed as a cross-sectional observational study to assess the gut microbiome of healthy KSH cats. To identify suitable healthy cats, approximately 600 cat owners completed a detailed survey. The survey collected metadata on each cat’s identity, including name, age, neutering status, fecal consistency score, diet, gastrointestinal-related clinical signs, history of antibiotic or medication use, and the presence of comorbidities. Stool consistency was assessed using the 7-point Nestlé Purina Fecal Scoring System (1 = very hard/dry; 7 = watery diarrhea) ( 24 Based on the survey responses, 50 cats were initially shortlisted. These cats subsequently underwent thorough physical examinations and hematological assessments. Following these evaluations, 40 cats that met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) fecal score between 2 and 3; (2) body condition score between 4 and 9; (3) no gastrointestinal signs within the past 6 months; (4) no history of antibiotics, steroid, GI protectants, or probiotics administration within the past 6 months; (5) normal hematological and biochemical parameters; (6) up to date on vaccinations and parasite control; and (7) no evidence of systemic illness. The final 40 enrolled cats included 4 intact females, 13 spayed females, and 23 neutered males, aged 0.5–14 years, with a BCS range of 4 to 9. The BCS of each cat was assessed by a professional veterinarian ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Scheme of animal selection. For the body condition score, a 9-point scale was used, while for the fecal core assessment, a 7-point scale was utilized. GI, gastrointestinal; BCS, body condition score; FeLV, feline leukemia virus; FIV, feline immunodeficiency virus. Flowchart titled \"Patient Selection\" outlining an online survey conducted from August to December 2023 with 600 participants. Fifty patients meeting inclusion criteria, such as fecal score between 2-3 and body condition score between 4-9, were selected. Criteria included no GI signs in the past six months, no recent history of specific treatments, and being up-to-date with vaccinations. Of these, 10 were excluded for medical reasons like elevated enzyme levels, leaving 40 included patients. 2.2 Sample collection and DNA extraction Participants in the study were provided with standardized kits to collect small fecal samples, which were subsequently returned by mail. Each kit included 2 mL screw-cap tubes containing 100% molecular-grade ethanol and silica beads to preserve the sample integrity during transportation. Upon arrival, the samples were transported to the laboratory and stored at temperatures below −80°C to ensure microbial DNA stability until DNA extraction. DNA was extracted using the DNeasy PowerSoil Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative DNA analysis was performed using the Quant-IT PicoGreen assay (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, United States). 2.3 Library construction and sequencing To target the V3 and V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, sequencing libraries were constructed following the Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation protocol. During the first PCR, 5 ng of genomic DNA was amplified in a reaction mixture containing 5x reaction buffer, 1 mM dNTPs, 500 nM universal forward and reverse primers, and Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase. The thermal cycling conditions for the initial PCR involved denaturation at 95°C for 3 min and 25 amplification cycles at 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C at 30 s, followed by final extension at 72°C for 5 min. This initial amplification, using Illumina adapter overhangs, utilized a universal primer pair consisting of V3-F.: 5′-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′ and V4-R: 5′-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′. Following amplification, AMPure XP beads (Agencourt Bioscience, Beverly, MA) were used to purify the PCR products. For the second PCR, the final sequencing library was constructed using Nextera XT Index primers with 2 μL of the purified product from the first PCR. The second PCR followed the same conditions as the above; instead, 25 cycles were used. PCR products were purified using AMPure XP beads to remove contaminants and ensure high-quality libraries. Quantitative analysis of the purified library was conducted using qPCR following the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems) protocol, optimized for Illumina platforms. The quality and size of the library were assessed using the TapeStation D1000 ScreenTape system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 300 base pairs) was performed on the MiSeq™ platform (Illumina, San Diego, United States) by Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea), generating high-resolution data suitable for downstream microbial community analysis. 2.4 Gut microbial analysis The raw sequencing data generated using the MiSeq platform were converted into FASTQ files using index sequences. Adapter and primer sequences were trimmed using Cutadapt (v3.2) with default parameter ( 25 26 Taxonomic classification of ASVs was performed using BLAST+ (v2.9.0) ( 27 28 2.5 Statistical analysis Microbial diversity (alpha diversity) within groups was calculated based on ASVs using the Shannon index, Inverse Simpson index (Gini-Simpson), Chao1 estimator, and Faith’s Phylogenetic Diversity (PD_whole_tree), all implemented in QIIME (v1.9). Unless otherwise specified, all values are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Beta diversity, reflecting differences in microbial community composition between groups, was assessed using weighted UniFrac distances. Principal coordinate analysis was used to visualize community composition. All statistical analyses were performed in R (v4.0.3) and visualized using ggplot2 (v3.2.1) for box plot generation. Predictor variables included age group (categorized as 0.5-1 year, 2–6 year, and 7–14 year), sex (neutered male and spayed female), BCS, and diet (dry food and dry + wet food). Statistical significance was set at p p Significant variations in microbial diversity indices and relative abundances were compared between groups using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test or Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by Dunn’s post-hoc test. Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed at both the phylum and genus levels to examine associations between bacterial taxon abundance and predictor variables, including age, sex, BCS, and diet. Beta diversity differences between groups were analyzed using UniFrac distance matrices and tested statistically by PERMANOVA. The core microbiome was calculated by identifying taxa present in at least 50% of samples with a minimum relative abundance of 0.1%, to define prevalent and biologically meaningful microbial taxa representative of the healthy cat population studied. 3 Results 3.1 Core microbiome of healthy KSH cats Fecal samples from 40 healthy KSH cats, aged 0.5–14 years and with a BCS 4–9, were analyzed for their gut microbiome composition ( Table 1 Table 1 Twenty-two core microbiome genera identified in healthy KSH cats.

Additionally, box plots on the right illustrate relative abundances of specific bacteria: Blautia hominis, Blautia schinkii, Lachnoclostridium edouardi, and Clostridium perfringens, comparing the two conditions. 3.2 Age Comparative analysis across age groups, categorized as 0.5–1 year, 2–6 year, and 7–14 years, revealed no significant differences in alpha diversity measures (ASVs, Shannon, Gini-Simpson, PD_whole_tree). However, most indices exhibited a trend toward increased microbial diversity with age ( Figure 3A Figure 3B p Phocaeicola p Segatella p Supplementary Table S2 Phocaeicola vulgatus p Phocaeicola coprocola p Bacteroides stercoris p Figure 3C 3.3 BCS Neither alpha nor beta diversity measures demonstrated significant differences between the BCS groups.

Previous research in healthy domestic cats from the United States identified Bacillota, Bacteroidota, and Actinomycetota as the predominant phyla, with Prevotella Bacteroides Collinsella Blautia Megasphaera 18 29 Bacteroides Prevotella 30 In the present study, Bacillota made up 50% of the total microbiome, whereas Bacteroidota was 30% and Actinomycetota was 8% at the phylum level, which is similar to previous findings ( 18 29 Segatella Bacteroides Collinsella, Blautia Megasphaera Segatella Blautia Phocaeicola Bacteroides Peptacetobacter Biological aging, estimated from frailty or physiological markers, has been linked to lower microbial diversity and richness, greater abundances of frailty-associated bacteria, impaired SCFA pathways, and reduced gut stability, irrespective of chronological age ( 31 18 Studies on age-related gut microbiome changes in cats have reported mixed findings influenced by health status, diet, and external factors ( 32 33 34 In our study, although no significant differences in alpha diversity were observed, a decline in diversity was noted from 0–1 years to 2–6 years, followed by a slight increase in the 7–14 year age group. This pattern aligns with prior findings, suggesting that the initial decline could be attributed to the stabilization of the gut microbiome during adulthood, whereas the subsequent increase may reflect microbial adaptation to aging ( 34 Previous research on obese cats in the United States reported a significant decrease in microbial diversity, with a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increased relative abundances of Bifidobacterium Dialister Olsenella provencensis Campylobacter upsaliensis 15 In contrast, our study did not observe a significant increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio relative to BCS. Instead, the abundance of specific microbiota such as Ruminococcus torques 35 Ruminococcus torques A study conducted in the United Kingdom reported no significant sex-specific differences in gut microbiome composition between intact male and female cats when environmental factors were controlled, which contrasts with the findings of our study ( 19 In the present study, the relative abundances of Sutterella massiliensis Finegoldia magna Sutterella massiliensis Sutterella Finegoldia magna 36 37 38 Diet significantly influences gut microbiota composition in humans, with high-fiber diets increasing butyrate-producing bacteria, which contribute to SCFA production and improved gut health in humans ( 39 Blautia Blautia 40 Blautia hominis Blautia schinkii Clostridium perfringens Clostridium perfringens 41 Previous studies conducted across different states in the United States have reported that commercial dry and wet food diets differ in their protein, carbohydrate, and fat ratios, which can promote the growth of specific bacteria and alter the gut microbiome composition ( 22 32 42 18 4.1 Limitations The limitations of the present study are as follows: First, the study involved 40 cats, which is a relatively small sample size, and thus, the results may not be highly generalizable. However, in previous studies showing differences between diseased and healthy groups, the number of healthy cats was smaller than in our study. Therefore, the healthy cats in this study could serve as a reference group for future comparisons with diseased groups. Second, in most cases, the exact age of the cats could not be confirmed. Age information obtained from owner reports was therefore classified into three broad categories (0.5–1 year, 2–6 years, and 7–14 years). This approach prevented the use of age as a continuous variable and limited further subdivision of the existing ranges, which may have reduced the ability to detect subtle age-related variations in the microbiome. Sample sizes were unequal across age groups. In addition, covariates co-varied with age: all cats in the 7–14-year group were fed a dry-only diet, had higher BCS, and were spayed or neutered; this constrains our ability to isolate age effects from diet, BCS, and sex status. Third, health status was determined by questionnaire and screening, and detailed dietary monitoring was not performed. These factors may have contributed to the variability observed in the microbiome. In addition, the cross-sectional design provides only a snapshot of the gut microbiota at a single time point, preventing causal inference or assessment of temporal dynamics. Fourth, the voluntary, survey-based recruitment process influenced the final sample size and demographic composition. Most enrolled cats were neutered males, reflecting regional ownership trends rather than intentional selection. Although this allowed comparison between neutered males and females, intact animals were under-represented. Future studies should specifically evaluate the combined effects of sex and neuter status in larger, more balanced cohorts. Fifth, dietary information was obtained from owners, and comprehensive nutritional profiles (e.g., macronutrient and fiber content) were unavailable for all commercial products. The main diet types are summarized in Table 2 Table 2 Characteristics of the 40 healthy cats in the reference set.

While the core microbiome was defined by Bacillota, Bacteroidota, and Actinomycetota, distinct differences were observed at the genus level, including the distribution of Segatella Blautia Phocaeicola Bacteroides Peptacetobacter This study was partially supported by the Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University.
