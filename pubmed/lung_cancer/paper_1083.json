Methods FIH trials of anticancer drugs initiated between 2007 and 2017 were investigated in this study. The trials were searched using ClinicalTrials.gov. Results There were 22 FIH trials conducted in Japan and 261 in the US. Of these, six drugs (27.2%) were approved in Japan and 27 (10.3%) were approved in the US, indicating that the probability of approval was significantly higher for FIH trials conducted in Japan than in the US. Comparison of the characteristics of FIH trials between Japan and the US, showed that 81.8% of the FIH trials conducted in Japan were sponsored by the top 20 pharmaceutical companies, whereas 55.6% in the US were sponsored by non-top 20 companies ( P 0 P 0 P 0 Conclusion We inferred that the FIH trials conducted in Japan are multiregional clinical trials by major pharmaceutical companies with Europe and the US, and are conducted with drugs that are expected to have a high probability of successful approval.

However, from approximately the year 2000, drug lag has become a problem in Japan, and the utilization of overseas data and bridging strategies have become popular as drug development strategies, and clinical development in Japan has been following that in Europe and the US [ 5 6 7 9 10 4 11 13 14 Therefore, this study focused on Japan and the US as countries where FIH trials are conducted, and aimed to clarify the characteristics and background of FIH trials of anticancer drugs conducted in these two countries. Furthermore, for understanding differences in the characteristics of FIH trials in the two countries, we aimed to examine whether there is a difference in the probability of drug approval between cases where the FIH trial of the drug is conducted in Japan and in the US. Materials and methods Selection of drugs and database for research This study covered a 10 years period from Jan 2007 to Dec 2017, focusing on a ± 5 years period around 2012, when the guidance on FIH trials was issued in Japan. FIH trials of anticancer drugs initiated in Japan or the US during that 10 years period were surveyed. ClinicalTrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ Condition/disease: “Oncology”. Other terms: “first in man” or “first-in-human”. Study Status: All studies. Study Phase: Phase 1. Study type: Interventional. Location: “Japan” or “United States”. The above data extraction using ClinicalTrials.gov was performed on June 1, 2024. Data collection and abstraction Information on the background of each drug, its regulatory background and the application for drug approval was collected from public sources. Information of the drugs approved in Japan was collected from the website of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) website ( https://www.pmda.go.jp/PmdaSearch/iyakuSearch/ http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/ 15 Statistical analysis We used descriptive statistics to characterize the new drugs and their indications. We used the chi-square test for trend comparisons of regulatory characteristics between public knowledge-based application and other applications. All statistical tests were two-tailed, and P Results FIH trials investigated A search on ClinicalTrials.gov on June 1, 2024 found 36 FIH trials in Japan and 520 in the US over the 10 years study period from Jan 2007 to Dec 2017. Each trial was reviewed closely and 14 trials in Japan and 259 trials in the US were excluded due to reasons such as “there is another FIH trial”, “the pharmaceutical product cannot be identified”, “it is an FIH trial of a combination trial” and “it is not an FIH trial of a pharmaceutical product”. Ultimately, 22 FIH trials in Japan and 261 in the US were investigated in this study. The FIH trials investigated in this study are shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Flowchart of FIH trials investigated in the study We examined FIH trials from 2007 to 2017, with a primary focusing on those conducted in 2012, when the FIH guideline was issued, and the years immediately before and after. Additionally, the change over time in the number of FIH trials conducted in Japan or the US is shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Number of oncology FIH trials from 2007 to 2017 in Japan and the US Comparison of the characteristics and background of FIH trials between Japan and the US Table 1 P 0 P Table 1 Characteristics of oncology FIH trials from 2007 to 2017 in Japan or the US Items Japan the US P N % N % Total number 22 100.0 261 100.0 – Mechanism of action Cytotoxic drug 0 0.0 3 1.1 0.860 Molecularly-targeted drug 10 45.5 134 51.3 Antibody preparation 9 40.9 85 32.6 Antibody drug conjugate 3 13.6 25 9.6 Immunotherapy 0 0.0 7 2.7 Hormonal drug 0 0.0 1 0.4 Others 0 0.0 6 2.3 Cancer type Solid cancer 16 72.7 210 80.5 0.063 Hematologic cancer 3 13.6 28 10.7 Solid cancer and Hematologic cancer 3 13.6 23 8.8 Sponsor size/type Top 20 company 18 81.8 116 44.4 0.003 Other company 4 18.2 132 50.6 Investigator/government 0 0.0 13 5.0 Sponsor capitol Domestic company 2 9.1 13 5.2 0.450 Foreign company 20 90.9 235 94.8 Number of patient 50 3 13.6 106 40.6 0.044 51–100 2 9.1 59 22.6 101–200 7 31.8 47 18.0 201–300 4 18.2 24 9.2 301–400 0 0.0 7 2.7 401–500 1 4.5 4 1.5 501 5 22.7 14 5.4 We also investigated the countries where FIH trials of anticancer drugs in Japan or the US were conducted. More than 80% of the FIH trials in Japan were also conducted in the US and Europe as multiregional clinical trials. In contrast, about half of the FIH trials in the US (49.0%) were conducted in the US alone, and the percentage of trials conducted as multiregional clinical trials was significantly lower than in Japan ( P 0 2 Table 2 Location of oncology FIH trials from 2007 to 2017 in Japan or the US Japan The US P Location N % Location N % Japan 22 100.0 the US 261 100.0 < 0.001 Japan + the US 19 86.4 the US + Japan 20 7.7 Japan + Europe *1 18 81.8 the US + Europe *1 103 39.5 Japan + China 4 18.2 the US + China 7 2.7 Japan + others *2 18 81.8 the US + others *3 107 41.0 Japan only 0 0.0 the US only 128 49.0 * * * Comparison of probability of approval between Japan and the US We examined whether the drugs investigated in the FIH trials conducted in Japan or the US were approved in Japan or the US.

At that time, Japan had the capability to create pharmaceutical products through basic research; however, it was pointed out that Japan was unable to conduct clinical research trials and lacked the capacity to conduct FIH trials. This situation was said to show that a “valley of death” existed between basic and clinical research [ 6 16 6 6 14 17 18 To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to comprehensively review FIH trials in Japan, and compare them with those in the US. In the present study, a comparison of the number of FIH trials between the two countries showed that the number of FIH trials conducted in the US was 10 times higher than those in Japan. The change in the number of trials over time showed an increasing trend in both Japan and the US. However, every year, the US conducted more FIH trials than Japan. Comparing the characteristics of FIH trials in Japan and the US, many trials in Japan were conducted by the top 20 sales pharmaceutical companies, whereas many trials in the US were conducted by non-top 20 pharmaceutical companies. We inferred that major pharmaceutical companies conduct FIH trials in Japan, whereas they are conducted in the US by bio-ventures and other companies. The number of patients was significantly higher in FIH trials conducted in Japan than those in the US. Comparison of the regions where the FIH trials were conducted revealed that, most of the FIH trials conducted in Japan were also conducted in the US and Europe, whereas the percentage of FIH trials conducted in the US that were being conducted in other countries was significantly lower. We inferred that Japan is currently participating in FIH trials that are conducted as multiregional clinical trials. The present study also examined the probability of drug approval following FIH trials conducted in Japan and the US. Previous studies in Europe and the US have shown that the probability of approval for pharmaceutical products that have undergone FIH trials is as low as 8–10% [ 19 20 21 22 The present study has several limitations. First, we used ClinicalTrial.gov as our search database for clinical trials; however, trials and pharmaceutical products not registered with it were not investigated. Second, we investigated approval status based on information from public sources such as company websites, but pharmaceutical companies may not have announced the discontinuation of new drug development, and these drugs may have been classified as under development. Third, the probability of approval may be influenced by several potential confounders outside the scope of this study (e.g., cancer type, mechanism of action, investigational site selection, and size of company etc.). Finally,, since only anticancer drugs are included in this study, FIH trials in other areas are expected to yield different results. Conclusion We investigated FIH trials of anticancer drugs initiated in Japan or the US between 2007 and 2017. The number of FIH trials in Japan and the US increased annually; however, we found that the backgrounds including “sponsors”, “number of patients” and “regions where FIH trials are conducted” are different between Japan and the US. In addition, the probability of approval was higher for anticancer drugs that underwent FIH trials in Japan than for those in the US. FIH trials in Japan and the US exhibited differences in characteristics. Further, the probability of approval was higher for anticancer drugs that had undergone FIH trials in Japan than those in the US. Based on these, it was inferred that the FIH trials conducted in Japan are clinical trials by major pharmaceutical companies, are conducted as multiregional clinical trials in collaboration with Europe and the US, and with drugs that are expected to have a certain high probability of successful approval.
