(2015) Hill et al. (2024) regardless Bleske-Rechek et al., 2015 Past research has identified ways in which the language or data displays used to describe research findings can exacerbate the tendency to incorrectly draw causal conclusions from correlational designs. For example, Hatfield et al. (2006) statistical methodological design Xiong et al. (2019) Hatfield et al. (2006) Xiong et al. (2019) A second, less studied, reasoning error Unfortunately, a focus on one type of reasoning error emerging from correlational designs may ignore a second reasoning error: incorrectly concluding there cannot be a causal relationship reflected in a correlational study. Yet, this latter error might be hidden if instructors only teach and assess students’ recognition that causal conclusions should not be drawn from a correlational study. In Introductory Psychology, instructors often contrast correlational studies with experimental studies in which it may be possible to draw causal conclusions because alternative explanations can be ruled out. In particular, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) is often taught as a gold standard (or top of hierarchy) methodology that allows for researchers to appropriately draw a causal conclusion (for a discussion, see Wielkiewicz, 2024 Deaton and Cartwright, 2018 Goldberg, 2019 Barrowman, 2014 Hill, 1965 possible Both reasoning errors are important given the range and complexity of real-world research questions, some of which are not amenable to an RCT. This is particularly important in psychology, where many of the variables of interest (e.g., personality characteristics, exposure to environmental toxins, risk factors for depression) are unethical or impossible to manipulate experimentally. A correlation between variables is generally considered a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for establishing causality (but see also Barrowman, 2014 Deaton and Cartwright, 2018 Goldberg, 2019 potential Hill, 1965 Wielkiewicz, 2024 Fisher, 1957 1958 In an introductory course, students should know that while it is not possible to draw a causal conclusion from a single correlational study, the possibility of causation should not be ruled out. While the phrase “correlation does not equal causation correlation does not equal causation” correlation cannot mean causation. cannot possible Evidence of student errors In our teaching at multiple types of institutions (community colleges, large-enrollment research universities, and small liberal arts institutions), we anecdotally observed many student comments in class that indicated the hidden error of incorrectly concluding that a causal relation was not possible in a correlational study. This suggested to us that some students may be making a reasoning error that we had not been addressing in our instruction or assessment. As a first step toward assessing students’ understanding of whether causal relationships can be established or are possible The question stem and answer choices are shown in Figure 1 could not possible Figure 1 Multiple-choice question used to probe possible misconceptions in identifying what conclusions can correctly be drawn from a methodologically correlational study and distribution of student answer choices ( N Figure presents multiple-choice question prompt and four answer choices, as well as the distribution of student answers. The question prompt reads: A researcher invites 300 college students to participate in a 3-month study of mood and social media. Forty-seven students agree to participate and report their social media usage and their feelings of sadness and loneliness every day for three months. The researcher finds a significant positive correlation between how much time the students spend on social media and their self-reported feelings of loneliness and sadness. Which of the following can be concluded from the study above? The four answer choices are that A) social media causes negative emotions such as sadness and loneliness, B) negative emotions such as sadness and loneliness cause people to spend more time on social media, C) either A or B could be possible, D) neither A nor B could be possible. The bar chart shows most students chose C, followed by D, with minimal choices for A and B. Annotations indicate A and B as incorrect causal conclusions, C as correct, and D as incorrectly concluding that causation is not possible. We administered this question on an exam to 124 students across five different sections of a single-semester Introductory Psychology taught by one of two instructors at a small four-year liberal arts college (the first and second author). All sections of the class were taught in-person. The assessment question was embedded in a unit exam (one of three for the course, worth ~20% of students’ final grade) that was administered proctored, in person, and closed-note / closed-book. Specific demographic information about students participating was not collected as part of this study, but typically two-thirds of students who take the Introductory Psychology course at this college are first year students. Within the undergraduate college, 99% of students are traditional college age (under age 26 years), and approximately two-thirds of students identify as mono-racial White. Both instructors, who each have taught Intro Psych at least 20 times, regularly use the phrase “ correlation does not equal causation Figure 1 possible not possible The distributions observed in the aggregate above were remarkably consistent across the five sections.

Possible sources of confusion Given that students incorrectly conclude that no causal relationship can exist in a correlational study at relatively high rates, why might that be? We propose several possible sources of this confusion below and hope that future work isolates these to identify their possible contribution to students’ reasoning errors. One source of confusion might be the phrase “ correlation does not equal causation “Correlation does not mean causation,” correlation means no causation In other instantiations of the phrase, such as “ correlation does not imply causation” Whitehead and Russell, 1910 correlation does not indicate causation A second source of confusion could be the types of examples given during instruction, which might have a biasing effect as well. As noted earlier, instructors often use memorable examples such as the association between ice cream consumption and shark attacks. These examples are often selected to address the concern that students might mistakenly assume correlated variables must be causally related. The heightened focus on these kinds of examples, especially if used to the exclusion of examples in which correlated variables are in fact causally related, might directly or implicitly bias students toward assuming that a correlation cannot mean causation. Together, these potential sources of confusion point to an overarching issue in which Introductory Psychology courses may focus on one type of reasoning error from correlational designs to the potential exclusion of the other. Balancing course coverage to emphasize both Stevens et al., 2016 Wielkiewicz, 2024 Barrowman, 2014 Matute et al., 2015 Wielkiewicz, 2024 Mueller et al., 2020 Pedagogical implications The phrase “ correlation does not equal causation” Hill et al., 2024 Horton, 2023 First, we recommend that instructors consider their choice of wording very carefully when using a short phrase to convey which types of conclusions can be drawn from a correlational study. For example, the use of “imply” in the phrase, “ correlation does not imply causation correlation does not guarantee causation correlation does not necessarily mean causation Hill et al. (2024) However, this finding lends itself to a second recommendation, which is that instructors use a broad range of carefully considered examples when teaching about correlation and causality. A more even-handed presentation of examples, in which spurious correlations or third variable problems do not take center stage (as they do in the ice cream / shark attacks example), may help prevent students from assuming that “ correlation never means causation Fisher, 1957 1958 supports Finally, in addition to addressing pedagogy, instructors should attend to assessment. That is, not only should instructors ensure that students do not mistakenly assume that correlation always means causation, but instructors should also ensure that students do not assume correlation never means causation. Assessments designed to identify the former error might be missing the latter error, and there is no need to trade one mistake for another. Intentionally looking for this second misconception might be important, as it may be invisible even among students who learn to parrot back the phrase ‘ correlation does not equal causation.’ Limitations and future directions While the focus of this paper was to highlight a ‘hidden error’ among students and spur discussion among the Psychology teaching community, there are also limitations to the data presented that future work can address. First, while the single multiple-choice item used here provides a window into correlational reasoning errors, future work could use a broader range of questions and question types to assess student understanding and correlational reasoning errors more broadly. For example, different types of scenario stems or relationships (both clearly not causal and plausibly causal) could challenge students to consider these possibilities more deeply in different applied contexts. Instructors may also wish to include short-answer questions that require students to identify and discuss all possible causal explanations in a particular correlational scenario, including an assessment or consideration of their relative likelihood. There are also potential problems with the specific item used here which suggest possible targeted manipulations in future studies. In particular, option (D) in the current assessment item may have been confusing to some students. A clearer option (D) could be worded as ‘Neither A nor B is possible.’ As well, in the four-alternative, forced-choice question used here, students may have been able to use test-taking strategies unrelated to their actual understanding of correlation and causation to rule out both causal conclusions (answer choice A and B), recognizing that it would not be possible for just one of those options to be correct. While in some correlational studies, causality in one direction can be ruled out due to temporal ordering or other factors, in this example that was not possible. An alternative type of question getting at this learning outcome might include a causal option only in one direction to address this limitation. Expanding the assessment questions and including targeted manipulations could clarify the nature and scope of this reasoning error among students, as well as suggest areas for instruction and pedagogical innovation. This points to a related limitation, which is that while we have identified a reasoning error and suggest possible sources of the confusion and instructional remedies, we do not yet have data showing that specific changes will reduce the error in students. It will be important for instructors both to assess whether their own students are making this reasoning error and, if so, what pedagogical strategies are effective at reducing it. As instructors engage this type of reasoning error, we hope a set of evidence-based curriculum materials that support students’ correlational reasoning can be developed and disseminated. Conclusion We hope this paper spurs increased discussion, teaching ideas, and pedagogical research among psychology instructors related to correlational reasoning.
