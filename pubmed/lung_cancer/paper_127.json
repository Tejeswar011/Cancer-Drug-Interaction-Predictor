Background Benefit finding (BF) improves quality of life in maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) patients, yet population heterogeneity remains understudied. This study explores how self-efficacy and social support jointly influence BF patterns and identifies distinct patient subgroups. Methods This multi-center cross-sectional study was conducted from April to September 2023 at five tertiary hospitals in Shanghai, China, enrolling 352 MHD patients. Data from the Benefit Finding Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Perceived Social Support Scale were used to construct a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model employing five-fold cross-validation, with a maximum depth of 3 and a minimum leaf node size of 10%. Results The CART model (R²=0.278) identified five distinct BF subgroups ( p p p p Conclusion BF levels in MHD patients demonstrated significant variations influenced by the combined effects of self-efficacy and social support. The decision tree model successfully identified patient subgroups with distinct psychological resource configurations. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for implementing stratified and personalized psychological interventions in clinical practice. Clinicians can identify and prioritize vulnerable patients who simultaneously lack self-efficacy and social support, offering them targeted positive psychological interventions that may potentially improve treatment adherence and long-term prognosis. renal dialysis self-efficacy social support benefit finding decision tree The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Research indicates that BF levels vary according to social environment, and individual characteristics ( 19 20 21 22 22 23 According to the Conservation of Resources Theory proposed by Hobfoll, psychological adaptation essentially involves the acquisition, preservation, and allocation of resources ( 24 25 Self-efficacy, a core concept in Social Cognitive Theory, reflects an individual’s confidence in their ability to execute specific behaviors or achieve desired goals ( 15 26 27 28 29 Social support refers to the emotional, informational, and practical assistance individuals receive from their social networks ( 30 31 32 33 To investigate how different configurations of self-efficacy and social support shape BF levels and their potential heterogeneity, this study employed the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model, a machine learning approach, to examine how these psychological resources interact to form distinct patterns of perceived benefits among MHD patients. The CART model offers unique advantages for understanding BF heterogeneity through its ability to identify non-linear relationships, capture complex interaction effects, and create clinically meaningful patient subgroups ( 34 This study aims to: (1) explore the heterogeneity of BF among MHD patients using a regression-based decision tree model with self-efficacy and social support as stratification variables; (2) analyze demographic and clinical characteristic differences across identified subgroups; and (3) provide theoretical foundation and practical guidance for developing targeted, stratified psychological interventions. 2 Methods 2.1 Study design This study employed a multicenter cross-sectional survey design, aiming to identify distinct subgroups of BF among MHD patients and to provide a foundation for implementing targeted psychosocial interventions. 2.2 Participants This study recruited 364 MHD patients from the nephrology inpatient departments of five tertiary general hospitals in Shanghai, China, between April and September 2023. Inclusion criteria were as follows:(1) Diagnosed with ESRD ( 32 During data quality control, 12 questionnaires were excluded due to incomplete responses or errors, resulting in 352 valid questionnaires, with an effective response rate of 96.70%. The sample size was determined based on the empirical rule for CART analysis. Considering that this study included two primary predictor variables (self-efficacy and social support), each potentially generating two to three meaningful branches, and accounting for possible interaction effects, we anticipated approximately eight terminal nodes in the final model. Following the rule that each terminal node should contain at least 30 observations, the minimum required sample size was estimated to be 240 participants. Our final sample of 352 valid participants exceeded this requirement, ensuring the statistical stability of the analysis ( 35 2.3 Measurement instruments 2.3.1 Demographic and clinical data questionnaire The questionnaire was developed by the research team based on a review of the literature and included information on demographic variables such as gender, age, marital status, and employment status. It also collected clinical data including disease etiology, presence of chronic co-morbidities, duration of dialysis, complications associated with haemodialysis, etc. 2.3.2 Benefit finding scale The BFS was developed by our research team based on literature review, qualitative interviews, and quantitative analysis. It comprises 26 items across six dimensions—personal growth, health behavior change, appreciation of life, realization of social support, altruism, and spiritual development—rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = “not at all” to 4 = “very much”). Total scores range from 0 to 104, with higher scores indicating greater BF. The BFS demonstrated strong psychometric properties following content validity assessment, exploratory factor analysis, and cultural adaptation, with an overall Cronbach’s α of 0.924 and subscale coefficients of 0.66–0.89 ( 36  Supplementary Materials 2.3.3 General self-efficacy scale Originally developed by Professor Ralf Schwarzer and colleagues in 1981 ( 37 2.3.4 Perceived social support scale Developed by Blumenthal and colleagues and later translated and adapted into Chinese by domestic scholars ( 38 2.4 Data collection Data were collected by uniformly trained researchers during patients’ hemodialysis sessions. Eligible patients were informed of the study’s objectives and procedures, and written informed consent was obtained prior to participation. Participants were then guided to complete the questionnaire independently. For those with reading difficulties, researchers read the items in a standardized manner and recorded the responses. Upon completion, each questionnaire was immediately reviewed for completeness, and any with missing or invalid responses were excluded from the dataset. The entire process required approximately 15–20 minutes per participant. 2.5 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using Python 3.12 and IBM SPSS version 27.0. Python-based analyses employed data processing and visualization libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib. Categorical demographic variables were described using frequencies and percentages [n(%)]. Continuous variables were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Data conforming to normal distribution were reported as mean ± standard deviation (Mean ± SD), while non-normally distributed data were described using the median and interquartile range (IQR). To explore the interaction between self-efficacy and social support in relation to BF and to identify patient subgroups, a regression-based decision tree model was employed. The total BF score served as the target variable, with self-efficacy and social support scores as predictor variables. For model parameter settings, a maximum tree depth was 3 to ensure interpretability of the results while avoiding overfitting ( 39 35 40 Based on the data distribution, the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was applied for categorical variables, and the Kruskal–Wallis H test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for continuous variables to examine subgroup differences in demographic and clinical characteristics. For variables showing significant differences ( p post hoc 3 Results 3.1 Demographic characteristics A total of 352 patients undergoing MHD were enrolled in this study, including 193 males (54.83%) and 159 females (45.17%). Among them, 152 patients (43.18%) were aged over 60 years, with a mean duration dialysis of 7.51 ± 6.78 years.

M, Mean; SE, Standard Error. 3.3 Performance evaluation of the CART A five-fold cross-validation was conducted to assess the performance and stability of the decision tree model. The cross-validation results showed a mean coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.126 (SD = 0.068), a total R² of 0.278, a mean squared error (MSE) of 212.204, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 11.203. These findings indicate that the final model explained 27.8% of the variance in BF, with an average prediction error of approximately 11.2 points. This level of predictive accuracy provides meaningful information for identifying subgroup differences in BF. 3.4 Subgroup classification of BF based on decision tree model Based on a CART model, five distinct subgroups of BF were identified among MHD patients, using social support and self-efficacy as the splitting variables (  Figures 1  3  Table 3 Figure 1 Decision tree model identifying subgroups of BF based on self-efficacy and social support. Each internal node shows the splitting criterion (e.g.”GSES≤ 16.5”) with the variable name and threshold value. Terminal nodes (leaves) are labeled 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8, representing the five distinct patient subgroups. Values inside each node indicate: squared_error, samples, and value (mean BF score). The color intensity corresponds to the mean BF score, with darker colors indicating higher BF levels. GSES, General Self-Efficacy Scale score; PSSS, Perceived Social Support Scale score. Decision tree for BF Subgrouping with eight nodes. Node 0 splits based on GES ≤ 16.5, leading to nodes 1 and 2. Node 2 splits on PSSS ≤ 54.5, leading to nodes 3 and 6. Node 3 splits on GES ≤ 25.5, leading to nodes 4 and 5. Node 6 splits on GES ≤ 29.5, leading to nodes 7 and 8. Each node displays squared error, sample size, and value.

Subgroup1 (leaf1, n=37, 10.51%) –Low Self-Efficacy Constrained Group: Characterized by markedly low self-efficacy (GES ≤16.5), with minimal internal coping capacity and the lowest BF score (M = 45.41). Social support did not contribute significantly to subgroup differentiation. Subgroup2 (leaf4, n=70, 19.89%) – Psychological Resource Relatively Deficient Group: Both self-efficacy (16.5 < GES ≤25.5) and social support (PSSS ≤54.5) were below average. Limited psychological resources corresponded to a modest BF score (M = 56.44). Subgroup 3 (leaf5, n=59, 16.76%) – Internally Belief Driven Group: Despite low social support (PSSS ≤54.5), higher self-efficacy (GES >25.5) supported a relatively favorable BF level (M = 64.33), highlighting the compensatory role of internal resources. Subgroup4 (leaf7, n=135, 38.35%) –Balanced Resource Adaptation Group: Patients showed moderately high levels of both self-efficacy (25.5 < GES ≤29.5) and social support (PSSS >54.5), achieving above-average BF (M = 67.12) through balanced resource utilization. Subgroup5 (leaf8, n=51, 14.48%)–Psychological Resource-Integrated Advantage Group: With the highest levels of both self-efficacy (GES >29.5) and social support (PSSS >54.5), this group exhibited the greatest BF (M = 78.41), reflecting optimal psychological resilience and adaptation. All categorical variables showed statistically significant differences across the five subgroups (p < 0.001).

Self-efficacy and social support, as core psychological resources, interacted to define five subgroups with markedly different BF levels. Self-efficacy was the dominant predictor, while social support exerted a conditional moderating effect, particularly at moderate self-efficacy levels. Demographic differences in sex, education, and employment across subgroups underscore how social context shapes the configuration of psychological resources. These findings reveal actionable targets for precision psychosocial interventions. The decision tree model explained 27.8% of the variance in BF among MHD patients, which represents a moderate but clinically meaningful level of predictive power. The remaining unexplained variance likely reflects the complex, multidimensional nature of BF, which is influenced by numerous factors beyond self-efficacy and social support, including personality traits, coping strategies, and cultural factors that were not captured in the current model. Patients undergoing MHD in this study exhibited moderate-to-high levels of BF, consistent with previous studies ( 41 43 44 45 46 The decision tree model identified self-efficacy as the primary variable distinguishing BF levels, consistent with its central role in social cognitive theory. As discussed by Barlattani et al., within the social cognitive model, self-efficacy is a key construct influencing health-related behaviors and psychological adaptation, and is regarded as a major predictor of both intention and health behavior ( 47 15 48 Although social support was not the primary splitting variable in the model, its synergistic role was most evident in the “ Balanced Resource Adaptation Group” and “Psychological Resource Integrated Advantage Group”. Patients with high levels of self-efficacy and social support achieved the highest BF scores. Bland ( 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 57 Notable sociodemographic differences were observed across subgroups, suggesting that psychological resource configurations may be shaped by underlying demographic factors. In terms of gender distribution, both male and female patients were primarily represented in the “Balanced Resource Adaptation Group,” characterized by moderately high self-efficacy and strong social support. This indicates that balanced psychological resources—regardless of gender—can facilitate better BF outcomes. However, a notably higher proportion of female patients appeared in the “Psychological Resource-Integrated Advantage Group,” suggesting that when women possess both high self-efficacy and high social support, they are more likely to achieve optimal BF. “Statistical analysis confirmed this gender-related pattern (χ² = 9.72, p 58 p 15 47 59 5 Limitations This study employed a cross-sectional design with samples drawn from five tertiary hospitals in the metropolitan area of Shanghai, eastern China, providing reasonable representation of urban hemodialysis patients. However, this sampling approach introduced a distinct urban bias, potentially limiting the generalizability of findings to community or rural dialysis centers. Future research should broaden sample coverage by including more diverse geographic regions and healthcare facility levels to enhance external validity. The study focused solely on self-efficacy and social support as predictor variables. The limited explanatory power of the model suggests that BF may be influenced by unmeasured confounders such as individual affective temperament, depression, coping strategies, social desirability bias, and health literacy. Incorporating a wider range of relevant variables is recommended to develop a more comprehensive predictive model. Data collection relied entirely on self-report questionnaires, which may introduce social desirability bias, particularly in measures of BF and social support. Future studies should consider multi-method data collection approaches, including objective assessments, clinical observations, or qualitative interviews, to minimize methodological bias.Although cross-validation was used to evaluate the stability of the decision tree model, the absence of external validation samples or more rigorous techniques such as bootstrapping may increase the risk of overfitting, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design precludes the examination of dynamic changes in BF or causal relationships among variables. While CART analysis can identify predictive relationships and interaction patterns, these should not be interpreted as causal. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate the developmental trajectories of BF and its dynamic associations with psychological resources. 6 Implications and practical significance Our findings demonstrate that BF is a multifaceted construct shaped by the interaction of multiple psychological resources. Using a decision tree model based on self-efficacy and social support, we identified five subgroups with distinct profiles, offering a foundation for stratified psychological intervention. Patients with limited psychological resources should be prioritized for foundational support targeting coping beliefs, social connectedness, and psychoeducation. Conversely, those with relatively strong resources may benefit from advanced strategies focused on deepening self-reflection, expanding positive emotions, and enhancing meaning-making. Traditional “one-size-fits-all” approaches may fail to meet the heterogeneous psychological needs of dialysis patients. Instead, precision interventions grounded in psychological resource structures may enhance BF, improve quality of life, and support long-term adherence—advancing the clinical application of targeted psychological care in chronic disease management. 7 Conclusion This study employed decision tree methodology to reveal the complex heterogeneity in BF among MHD patients. Results indicate that self-efficacy and social support are key psychological resources influencing BF, demonstrating diverse pathways through which patients cope with chronic illness challenges. For patients with low self-efficacy, clinical teams should prioritize self-efficacy enhancement programs, such as progressive self-management training and successful experience accumulation. For patients with higher self-efficacy but insufficient social support, interventions should focus on strengthening social support networks, including family support training, peer support groups, and community resource connections. For patients with robust psychological resources, maintenance psychological interventions and empowerment programs may be appropriate. Healthcare teams can utilize the decision tree classification tool proposed in this study for rapid screening and grouping, enabling optimized resource allocation and precise intervention matching. Future research should employ longitudinal designs to explore the dynamic development of BF, incorporate additional potential influencing factors to assess applicability across different cultural and clinical contexts, and develop differentiated intervention protocols for various psychological subgroups to validate their effectiveness in improving psychological adaptation and quality of life among dialysis patients.
