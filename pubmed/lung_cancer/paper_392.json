Early diagnosis plays a crucial role in preventing the progression of DKD. However, owing to the heterogeneity of its clinical presentation and multifactorial pathogenesis, early prediction of rapid progression remains a clinical challenge globally [ 4 5 5 The study of biomarkers in DKD is still in a growing stage, and information about the timely diagnosis of DKD is incomplete. Recent evidence exploring novel biomarkers of renal tubulointerstitial injury and inflammation is vital for achieving more precise predictions of the progression of DKD. Among the broadly classified novel biomarkers, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) [ 6 7 NGAL is a member of the lipocalin superfamily and is structurally characterized by sequences of 178 amino acid glycoproteins and a molecular weight of 25 kDa [ 8 9 More recently, inflammatory signaling pathways have been recognized to play a significant role in the progression of DKD. MCP-1 (CCL2), a potent monocyte attractant belonging to the CC subfamily of chemokines, is produced by mononuclear leukocytes, epithelial cells of cortical tubules, and podocytes [ 6 7 10 11 However, studies on the diagnostic accuracy of these biomarkers with respect to disease severity are scarce. This is the first study in the Indian population to assess the diagnostic role of a combination of two key pathogenic pathway indicators, NGAL and MCP-1, in predicting rapid DKD progression. The present study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of two novel noninvasive biomarkers, urinary NGAL and MCP-1, in differentiating between rapid progressors and nonrapid progressors. We also explored the prevalence, clinical profile, and potential risk factors associated with rapid progression. Materials and methods Study population This was a prospective observational study conducted at Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, MAHE, Manipal, India. A total cohort of 145 T2DM patients with DKD from October 2021 to June 2024 was studied after approval from the institutional ethics committee (IEC-421-2021) and Clinical Trails Registry India (CTRI/2021/09/036450). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Inclusion criteria All T2DM patients aged above 18 years who were clinically diagnosed with DKD as per the KDIGO guidelines (CKD stages 1–3) were included in this study. Exclusion criteria DKD patients with superimposed nondiabetic renal disease, advanced CKD stages (CKD 4 and CKD 5), autoimmune disease, active urinary tract infection, renal calcular disease, cancer, and less than 6 months of follow-up were excluded. Data collection Baseline clinical and demographic data, including age; height; weight; body mass index; sex; waist–hip ratio; abdominal circumference; and biochemical laboratory parameters, such as the urine albumin (ALB) creatinine level and the serum levels of blood sugar, creatinine, urea, total cholesterol, triglycerides, bicarbonate, and HbA1c, were recorded for all patients according to the protocol. Blood pressure was measured at the hospital via via via Following baseline assessments, patients were prospectively followed up until the end of the observation period. The outcome studied was the rapid decline in the eGFR. At the end of the follow-up, patients were categorized into rapid progressors and nonrapid progressors on the basis of a decrease in the eGFR. Urinary NGAL and MCP-1 assay A single time-point estimation of urinary NGAL and MCP-1 was performed in the baseline sample. Eight milliliters of a urine sample for biomarker analysis was collected once at the time of enrollment. The urine samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was stored at 800 °C until analysis. A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to measure the biomarkers quantitatively, including in duplicate samples. A fine test ELISA kit (Cat. No EH0012) was used for urine NGAL (uNGAL). A Diaclone ELISA kit (Cat. No 873.030.096) was used for urine MCP-1 (uMCP-1) analysis. The optical density was read by using a Thermo Scientific Multiskan FC ELISA reader. uNGAL levels are expressed in ng/ml, whereas uMCP-1 levels are expressed in pg/ml.

The prevalence of rapid progression in our population was 38.6%, with a median eGFR decrease of −12 mL/min/1.73 m 2 2 15 16 2 2 4 In our study cohorts, we observed a higher incidence of rapid progression among patients with baseline hypertension and CVD. This aligns with findings from recent studies indicating that patients with hypertension and CVD are more susceptible to rapid progression [ 4 17 2 4 17 17 18 19 20 An analysis of biochemical parameters revealed that only the fasting blood sugar level and UACR were significantly higher in rapid progressors than in nonprogressors, which was consistent with the findings of Makoto et al. who reported that patients with poor DM control and proteinuria had a rapid decline in renal function [ 21 22 In the recommended medication regimen, those who were on the RAAS or SGLT2i were less likely to experience rapid progression. However, in our cohort, there were fewer patients on these drugs in both groups, and this difference was not statistically significant. Tubular biomarkers constitute a sensitive index for assessing tubular damage. In this study, we measured the tubulointerstitial injury marker uNGAL and found a significant difference in the median uNGAL levels between rapid progressors and nonprogressors. This 25-kDa protein, which is part of the lipocalin superfamily, is abundantly released into the blood and urine by tubular cells, reflecting renal damage during DKD progression. Under physiological conditions, circulating NGAL is filtered by the glomeruli and almost entirely reabsorbed by proximal tubular epithelial cells. Elevated NGAL levels indicate ongoing renal damage and are associated with the progression of DKD [ 8 23 24 25 26 27 25 23 28 9 MCP-1 is a potent chemokine that plays a crucial role in recruiting monocytes to the tubulointerstitium in DKD. The infiltration of inflammatory cells into renal tissue is a key contributor to the progression of DKD, as it promotes a proinflammatory microenvironment that intensifies tissue damage and drives fibrosis. In DKD, MCP-1 protein and mRNA expression have been detected in cortical tubules and infiltrating mononuclear cells. Moreover, urinary MCP-1 levels are positively correlated with the severity of both tubulointerstitial and glomerular lesions [ 6 7 29 a a 23 30 31 30 32 23 33 29 a 34 35 Our study highlights the multifactorial pathogenesis of DKD and sheds light on the existing knowledge gap and lack of evidence on the ability of biomarkers from key pathways involved in DKD progression to predict rapid progression. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the role of NGAL and MCP-1 both individually and as a combined panel alongside the uACR. In this study, although both biomarkers were independent risk factors for rapid DKD progression, uMCP-1 showed better diagnostic performance than NGAL in terms of prediction, suggesting that uMCP-1 may be a promising biomarker for predicting rapid eGFR decline in DKD patients. However, further studies are needed to validate its added value over conventional markers such as the uACR. These results have important clinical implications, as uMCP-1 could aid in identifying high-risk patients for enrollment in clinical trials or for targeted, intensified interventions. These findings also provide further evidence supporting the role of MCP-1 in the pathogenesis of human DKD progression. This is particularly significant given that specific MCP-1 inhibitors are now available for clinical studies, offering the potential to reduce proteinuria [ 23 36 37 38 39 The limitations of this study include its single-center observational design and the absence of a comparison of NGAL and MCP-1 levels with those of healthy controls. Additionally, the study did not include estimations at two time points (baseline and follow-up). Data on renal endpoints such as the need for renal replacement therapy and mortality could not be obtained because of the short follow-up period. Conclusion A significant proportion of type 2 DKD patients in our population had rapid progression. The presence of hypertension, cardiovascular disease, high fasting blood sugar, and high SBP were significantly associated with this acceleration. While uACR remains a conventional biomarker, its diagnostic accuracy is limited in certain clinical scenarios, underscoring the need to explore novel biomarkers for more precise prediction of DKD progression. Our findings demonstrate that uNGAL and uMCP-1 levels are elevated in rapid progressors and increase progressively with worsening albuminuria. Both biomarkers, along with uACR, emerged as independent predictors of rapid decline, with uMCP-1 showing superior diagnostic performance characterized by higher sensitivity and specificity. The combined assessment of uMCP-1, uNGAL, and uACR significantly enhanced predictive accuracy, emphasizing the importance of multipanel biomarker strategies for better risk stratification. Incorporating these biomarkers into routine clinical practice could facilitate earlier detection of high-risk patients, enabling more timely and targeted therapeutic interventions to potentially mitigate disease. However, larger, multi-center studies with longer follow-up are needed to validate these findings.
