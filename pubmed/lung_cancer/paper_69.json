AuNPs can significantly enhance energy\ndeposition depending on\ntheir size, shape, and distribution.  The size of AuNPs influences their toxicity\nand therapeutic efficacy,\nwith smaller particles showing greater reactivity and the potential\nto cross biological barriers more easily, increasing both efficacy\nand toxicity risks due to inflammation and oxidative stress.   Importantly, despite their anatomical differences, Drosophila melanogaster The Drosophila  Drosophila Drosophila Drosophila  Given these challenges,\nthis study focuses on the use of ultrasmall\nAuNPs to enhance the local radiation dose in radiotherapy and assess\ntheir potential toxic effects and impacts of radiation after nanoparticle\nadministration. Using Drosophila melanogaster 2 Materials and Methods Our experimental\nworkflow ( Figure Drosophila melanogaster 1 Experimental workflow.\nAuNPs were synthesized, characterized, and\nadministered to Drosophila 2.1 Gold Nanoparticles – Synthesis and\nCharacterization AuNPs were synthesized using the chemical\nreduction method. A solution of HAuCl 4 4 The AuNP plasmon band was\nconfirmed by UV–vis spectroscopy using an Ultrospec 2100 pro\n(Amersham Pharmacia). Particle size distribution was measured by dynamic\nlight scattering (DLS) using the Zeta Sizer system (Malvern Instruments,\nU.K.), with a fixed angle (173°) and a 633 nm He–Ne laser.\nThe morphology and size of the AuNPs were examined using transmission\nelectron microscopy (TEM) with a JEOL-JEM-100 CXII (JEOL, Japan).\nA 1000-fold diluted AuNP sample was dropped onto a copper grid covered\nwith a conductive polymer, and images were processed using ImageJ\nsoftware. 2.2 Flies Strains and AuNPs Exposition Experiments were conducted using Drosophila melanogaster Eight experimental\ngroups were formed distributed as follows. Group 1: flies received\na standard diet; Group 2: flies received a diet containing AuNPs;\nGroup 3 and Group 4: similar to the first and second groups, respectively,\nbut were also exposed to irradiation; Group 5: embryos received a\nstandard diet; Group 6: embryos received a diet containing AuNPs;\nGroup 7 and Group 8: similar to the seventh and eighth groups, respectively,\nbut were also exposed to irradiation. For each experimental group,\naround 20 males flies with 3 days old were placed in a vial, with\neach treatment replicated in triplicate. The AuNP-enriched diet\nwas prepared by mixing the nanoparticle\nsolution into freshly melted fly food, followed by vigorous stirring\nbefore distribution into vials. The final AuNP concentration was set\nat 100 pmol/L, a nonlethal dose,  –7 Groups 2, 4, 6, and 8 were fed the AuNP\ndiet until day 11, when\nirradiation was performed. After exposure, these groups were switched\nto the standard diet. This design allowed evaluation of both isolated\nand combined effects of AuNPs and irradiation. 2.3 Irradiation Irradiation was performed\nusing an X-ray source operating at 220 kV and 13 mA, delivering a\ntotal dose of 30 Gy in a single fraction at a rate of 3.6 Gy/min.\nThis dose was selected based on previous studies demonstrating its\neffectiveness in analyzing sublethal biological effects and stress\nresponses induced by irradiation.  2.4 Development and Lifespan Embryo-containing\nvials were kept in the incubator, and developmental timing was assessed.\nEmbryo development was quantified based on two parameters: the hatch\nrate during the first 3 days and the total hatch rate. These metrics\nrepresent, respectively, the proportion of flies hatched within the\nfirst 3 days relative to the total number of hatched flies, and the\ntotal number of hatched flies relative to the total number of pupae.  For lifespan analysis, adult flies were transferred to fresh\nvials every 3 to 4 days. Importantly, transfers were conducted without\nCO 2 2 2.5 DNA Damage To evaluate the local\neffects of irradiation with and without AuNPs, adult flies were anesthetized\n3 days postirradiation, and gut tissues were dissected in 1X phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS). Guts were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 1 h\non a shaker at room temperature. After three 20 min PBS washes, samples\nwere incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 0.5% Triton\nX-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Immunostaining was\nperformed using the primary antibody mouse anti-γH2Av (1:40,\nDSHB), incubated for ∼24 h at 4 °C in PBS/0.5% Triton\nX-100 + 2% BSA. Samples were then washed three times (20 min each)\nin PBS/0.5% Triton X-100 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature\nwith secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 568 donkey antimouse and Hoechst\ndye (Invitrogen Molecular Probes, 1:1000), also diluted in PBS/0.5%\nTriton X-100 + 2% BSA. Final washes (3 × 20 min) were performed\nin PBS. Tissues were mounted between glass slides and coverslips (Electron\nMicroscopy Sciences) using Prolong Gold Antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen). Images were acquired with a Leica SP8\nconfocal microscope. Laser,\nfilter, and gain settings were kept constant across experimental groups.\nAll samples were imaged sequentially using a 20× oil immersion\nobjective and analyzed with Fiji software. 2.6 Statistical Analysis All statistical\nanalyses were performed using RStudio software. Group comparisons\nof embryo hatch rates were conducted using the Mann–Whitney\ntest. Survival distributions from lifespan experiments were evaluated\nusing bootstrap analysis of median survival, with significance adjusted\nfor multiple comparisons using Bonferroni’s method. 3 Results TEM analysis ( Figure n Figure Figure 2 (a) TEM images of the gold nanoparticles after dialysis.\n(b) Particle\nsize distribution (diameter) obtained from TEM and DLS.

Ten days after exposure, pupae from irradiated\nand nonirradiated embryos maintained on either standard food or AuNP-supplemented\nfood were evaluated ( Figure Figure Figure 3 Vials containing eggs, larvae and pupae in a) regular\ndiet and\nb) AuNPs diet (photos taken by the author MPS); c) hatch rate at day\n3 and total number of pupae hatched; d) Kaplan–Meier survival\ncurves of adult flies.

However, under the AuNP-supplemented diet,\nalthough pupae were observed in the irradiated group, none reached\nadulthood ( Figure Kaplan–Meier survival curves\n( Figure Canton\nS 3.2 DNA Damage To evaluate the cellular\neffects observed with the combination of AuNPs and radiation, immunofluorescence\nimages were obtained from the guts of flies from different groups\n( Figure 4 Immunofluorescence images from guts of\nflies from different groups.\na) Normal food; b) AuNPs food; c) Normal food + X Ray; d) AuNPs food\n+ X Ray.

Qualitative analysis of γ-H2AV immunostaining\nrevealed increased\nDNA damage in nonirradiated flies fed with AuNPs compared to the control\ngroup on a standard diet, suggesting that AuNP exposure alone induces\nDNA damage. Among irradiated flies, those on a standard diet exhibited\ngreater γ-H2AV labeling than the control group, while flies\nexposed to both AuNPs and X-rays showed the highest overall labeling\nintensity. Quantitative analysis of γ-H2AV-positive cells\n( Figure 4 Discussion This study used Drosophila melanogaster Drosophila  Drosophila Previous studies have used Drosophila Drosophila Based on this rationale, we investigated the combined effects of\nultrasmall gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and X-ray irradiation on the\ndevelopment and lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster Because\nof their small size, AuNPs can more effectively penetrate\nbiological tissues and interact closely with cellular components.\nThis supports their role as efficient radiosensitizers without substantially\nincreasing systemic toxicity. Although we did not directly assess\nAuNP internalization in Drosophila Exposure to\nAuNPs alone resulted in developmental delays, though\nit had no significant impact on hatching rates. However, when combined\nwith irradiation, embryonic development was completely halted, suggesting\na deleterious synergistic effect. This finding is consistent with\nprevious reports indicating that nanoparticles can amplify the biological\nimpact of radiation and enhance tumor targeting in clinical radiotherapy. Lifespan analysis revealed that irradiation\nreduced overall survival.\nHowever, flies that received both AuNPs and irradiation showed a slight\nsurvival advantage compared to those that received irradiation alone.\nThis finding suggests a potential protective effect that may be due\nto the reduction of oxidative stress. Additionally, DNA damage analysis\nrevealed an increase in γ-H2AV foci in flies exposed to both\nAuNPs and X-rays. This lends further support to the hypothesis that,\nwhile enhancing the effects of radiation, AuNPs may also modulate\ncellular repair mechanisms. These biological effects are consistent\nwith the anticipated changes\ndue to the radiation quality induced by high-Z nanoparticles. The\npresence of AuNPs has been shown to modify the local radiation field\nby emitting secondary electrons, including photoelectrons, Compton\nelectrons, and Auger electrons, when exposed to ionizing radiation.   In nonirradiated flies,\nour findings are consistent with previous\nstudies showing that AuNPs can induce DNA fragmentation and shorten\nlifespan.   Beyond their physical properties that enhance local radiation\ndose\nthrough secondary electron emission, ultrasmall AuNPs may modulate\nbiological pathways associated with oxidative stress and DNA repair.\nPrior studies have demonstrated that AuNPs can alter the redox balance\nof cells,  The localized generation\nof low-energy Auger electrons leads to\nclustered DNA damage that is difficult to repair, thereby increasing\nthe cytotoxicity of radiotherapy.  Collectively,\nour findings establish Drosophila\nmelanogaster 5 Conclusion In conclusion, our results\ndemonstrate that the combination of\nultrasmall AuNPs and X-ray irradiation significantly impacts embryonic\ndevelopment, adult lifespan, and DNA integrity in Drosophila\nmelanogaster Drosophila 6 Limitations and Future Directions The\nfindings of this study provide important insights into the\nmodulation of radiobiological responses by nanoparticles. However,\nseveral aspects require further investigation. First, only a single\nradiation dose of 30 Gy was assessed. This dose was selected based\non prior studies that demonstrated sublethal biological effects in\nDrosophila models. Exploring additional dose points would allow for\nthe creation of a more comprehensive dose–response curve. The\nconcentrations of AuNPs used in this study (100 pmol/L) were chosen\nbased on preceding studies indicating minimal toxicity. However, employing\nvarying concentrations could facilitate a more profound understanding\nof the nanoparticle burden and its biological ramifications. Furthermore,\nthe present study focused exclusively on ultrasmall AuNPs (∼4\nnm), which behave differently from larger nanoparticles with regard\nto cellular uptake and radiosensitization. Comparative analyses involving\na range of particle sizes and compositions would contribute to a more\nrobust understanding of the mechanisms involved.
