This subgroup exhibits minimal primary tumor volume and absence of nodal involvement, suggesting potentially different treatment responsiveness compared to advanced limited-stage disease. Existing clinical trials reveal limited representation of this specific cohort [ 6 10 The therapeutic equipoise between chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy alone in T1-2N0M0 SCLC remains unresolved. While chemoradiotherapy demonstrates superiority in mixed-stage cohorts, its added benefit over radiotherapy in truly localized disease with favorable prognostic features warrants investigation. This retrospective cohort study addresses this critical unmet need by directly comparing survival outcomes between chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy monotherapy in a rigorously defined T1-2N0M0 SCLC population. We hypothesize that radiotherapy alone may achieve equivalent therapeutic efficacy, with implications for treatment de-escalation strategies and future trial design. Materials and methods Patients A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using data extracted from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database spanning the period 2000–2020. SCLC cases were identified according to International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third edition (ICD-O-3) histological codes (8041/3, 8042/3, 8043/3, and 8044/3). Patient selection protocols have been previously described in our published work [ 11 13 Eligible participants met the following criteria: (1) histopathological confirmation of SCLC diagnosis (2), absence of previous malignancies, and (3) clinical staging confirming T1-2N0M0 disease. Patients were excluded if they: (1) underwent surgical intervention, or (2) received no treatments. Data collection and grouping Baseline demographic variables included age, sex, and race. Tumor characteristics comprised primary site, laterality, histological grade, and T stage classification. Treatment modalities were categorized into three groups: chemoradiotherapy, radiotherapy alone, and chemotherapy alone. Outcome measures Overall survival (OS) served as the primary endpoint, defined as the interval from diagnosis to death from any cause as recorded in SEER. Cancer-specific survival (CSS) constituted the secondary endpoint, calculated as the time from diagnosis to SCLC-attributed mortality according to SEER coding. Statistical analysis Age was dichotomized at the median value for comparative analyses. Categorical variables were compared across treatment groups using χ² tests or Fisher’s exact tests where appropriate. Kaplan-Meier methodology with log-rank testing was employed for survival curve comparisons between groups. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression identified potential prognostic factors, followed by multivariate analysis. To mitigate confounding, propensity score matching (PSM) was implemented through a logistic regression framework. One-to-one nearest-neighbor matching without replacement was performed using calipers of width 0.05 standard deviations of the logit-transformed propensity scores to optimize balance precision. Results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical computations were performed using SPSS Statistics (Version 26.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) and R software (version 4.2.2). Two-tailed P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Notably, radiotherapy demonstrated non-inferiority to chemoradiotherapy in CSS and OS endpoints, particularly in elderly patients (≥ 70 years). Current guidelines recommend surgical resection for early-stage SCLC [ 5 14 15 16 17 18 19 22 However, accurate preoperative staging remains critical due to frequent occult nodal metastases. While chest computed tomography shows only 60% accuracy for N0 staging [ 23 25 26 29 While CSS outcomes appeared comparable between chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups, this finding warrants cautious interpretation. The inherent limitations of SEER database prevented us from distinguishing sequential radiotherapy-chemotherapy regimens from truly monotherapy approaches. As sequential therapy has been shown to compromise CSS compared to concurrent regimens [ 9 The apparent OS advantage of chemoradiotherapy in univariable analysis was notably attenuated after multivariable adjustment (HR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.00-1.82; P Competing risk analysis of mortality causes provided critical insights. While 5-year SCLC-specific mortality rates were comparable, non-cancer mortality demonstrated a striking reduction with chemoradiotherapy (13.3% vs. 30.2%), driven predominantly by cardiovascular events. This finding suggests that while radiotherapy may offer comparable tumor control, survival benefit of chemoradiotherapy primarily stems from reduced non-cancer mortality in younger, fitter patients. PSM further validated these observations. After balancing for age and T stage, both CSS and OS became statistically indistinguishable between treatment arms. This suggests that radiotherapy alone may represent a reasonable treatment de-escalation strategy for carefully selected elderly patients with potential comorbidities. Notably, our chemoradiotherapy cohort demonstrated superior survival compared to historical controls [ 30 31 P P 32 The KEYNOTE-799 trial suggested promising antitumor activity of pembrolizumab plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy and manageable safety in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer [ 33 For patient ineligible for chemoradiotherapy, the optimal treatment paradigm remains undefined. While our analysis showed non-inferior survival outcomes with radiotherapy alone compared to chemoradiotherapy, these findings require prospective evaluation. Notably, concurrent immunotherapy and radiotherapy show promise mechanism in killing cancer cells. Concurrent immunotherapy and radiotherapy may be a treatment option in patient ineligible for chemoradiotherapy. Key considerations include cost-effectiveness analyses and rigorous toxicity profiling, particularly in elderly populations where treatment tolerance is paramount. In conclusion, our study challenges the traditional dominance of chemoradiotherapy in stage T1-2N0M0 SCLC, demonstrating comparable efficacy for radiotherapy alone in appropriately selected elderly patients. Future directions should focus on immunotherapy integration strategies tailored to early-stage disease biology and patient-specific factors.
