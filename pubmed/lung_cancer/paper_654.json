In end-stage silicosis, lung transplantation may be the only available treatment. While double lung transplantation has long-term survival benefits over single lung transplantation, this issue was not assessed in patients with silicosis. Research question Our study aimed to evaluate survival outcomes in silicosis patients undergoing lung transplantation, comparing single versus double lung transplants. Study design and methods This is a single-centre retrospective cohort study of all patients who underwent lung transplantation for silicosis at our centre between March 2006 and March 2024. Results During the study period, our centre conducted 778 lung transplantations, 40 of them (5.14%) were for silicosis, 25 single lung transplants and 15 double lung transplants. Double lung transplantation recipients experienced a more challenging surgical course due to adhesions and difficulty in explantation, associated with a significantly higher volume of blood products (8.00±15.13 units vs 24.85±24.41 units, p=0.023) and longer ischaemic times (243.63±85.36 min vs 327.67±95.23 min, p=0.009). There was no significant difference in the risk of death or re-transplantation in the single lung versus the double lung group (HR 1.163, 95% CI 0.473 to 2.861; p=0.74). Additionally, the two groups had no significant disparities in pulmonary function test results at 1 and 3 years post-transplant (51.93±22.43 vs 66.67±32.09 forced expiratory volume in the first second percent predicted at 36 months follow-up, p=0.25). Conclusion Given the intricate surgical procedure required for transplanting lungs in cases of silicosis, longer ischaemic times, increased need for blood products and the absence of definitive evidence supporting double lung transplantation in this population, it may be prudent to contemplate prioritising single lung transplantation for these patients.

Lung transplantation may be necessary for end-stage silicosis, but the benefits of single versus double lung transplantation have not been well-studied in this population. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Survival was similar between single and double lung transplantation, which was associated with a more challenging surgical course. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY Given the complexity of double lung transplantation and the lack of survival benefit over single lung transplantation, it may be more prudent to consider prioritising single lung transplantation for patients with silicosis. Introduction Silicosis is a preventable yet irreversible fibrotic lung disease resulting from inhaling respirable crystalline silica. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 6 10 11 5 12 Lung transplantation in silicosis is complicated technically and associated with bleeding and haemodynamic instability. 12 13 14 15 Patients and methods Data collection This was a single-centre retrospective observational cohort study of all patients who underwent lung transplantation for silicosis at our centre between March 2006 and March 2024. Patients referred for transplantation already had a confirmed diagnosis of silicosis, established according to the criteria outlined by the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, as detailed previously. 6 16 Organ allocation decisions for SLT were made based on organ availability. In some instances, lungs were split between two recipients, with one lung allocated to each patient based on limited organ availability and clinical need. Data regarding the transplant surgery were collected electronically and included the duration of surgery, blood product use, ischaemic time, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and bypass support. We recorded the vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) for each patient at the end of the transplantation surgery. This score serves as an objective measure to quantify the haemodynamic support level provided. Numerous studies have shown a correlation between elevated VIS values and unfavourable outcomes. 17 Pulmonary function tests, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), total lung capacity (TLC) and carbon monoxide diffusion in the lung (DLCO) were gathered before the transplant and at monthly follow-up visits. Pulmonary function tests were performed per the American Thoracic Society criteria for reproducibility and validity. 18 19 The study’s primary endpoint was graft survival, which encompasses post-transplantation mortality and graft failure (ie, re-transplantation). Patients were censored at their last known follow-up date. Mortality data were cross-checked using the National Population Authority’s system. Statistical methods The statistical analysis for this paper was generated using SAS Software, V.9.4. Continuous variables were presented by mean±SD or median (IQR). Categorical variables were presented by (n, %). The normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A t-test was used to compare the value of normally distributed continuous variables between study groups, Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for non-normal continuous variables, and Fisher’s exact test was used to compare the value of categorical variables between study groups. The Kaplan-Meier model was used to assess time to event by study group. Two-sided p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Patient and public involvement Patients or the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting or dissemination plans of our research. Results During the study period, 778 lung transplants were conducted in our centre, 40 of them for silicosis, as illustrated in figure 1 20 Figure 2 Figure 1 Annual number of lung transplantations performed for silicosis, classified as single lung transplantation (orange bars) or double lung transplantation (grey bars), from 2006 to 2024.

Figure 2 CT scans of the chest for a silicosis patient are depicted prior to ( A B C D All were men with a median age of 52 years (range 28–72). All patients had a history of chronic or subacute silica dust exposure, with a median work tenure of 20 years (range 4–43 years). The exposure included the cutting, processing, polishing and assembly of natural and artificial stone as part of the production of kitchen and bathroom countertops in 38 (95%) patients and paint and sand work in 2 (5%) patients. 24 (60.0%) patients had a history of smoking with a mean duration of 12.42 pack years.

Pulmonary function tests at baseline were similar on the DLT and SLT groups with a mean percent predicted FEV1 of 29.88%, a mean percent predicted TLC of 55.97%, and a mean percent predicted DLCO of 35.12%. After the transplant, the two groups had no statistically significant differences in pulmonary function test results at one- and 3 year post-transplant. At 6 months post-transplant, the mean percent predicted FEV1 was 48.13% for SLT and 59.82% for DLT (p=0.12), while the mean percent predicted FVC was 50.67% for SLT and 57.82% for DLT (p=0.29). Similar patterns persisted at the 12-month and 36-month intervals ( figure 4 online supplemental table 2 Figure 4 Box plot diagram representing pulmonary function test outcomes at various time intervals post-lung transplantation.

Discussion This study represents the most extensive investigation into lung transplantation for individuals with end-stage artificial stone-related silicosis. Furthermore, it compares SLT and DLT outcomes in this population. Our findings indicate that DLT recipients faced a significantly more challenging surgical course, with increased blood product usage and longer ischaemic times. At the same time, overall survival did not differ substantially between SLT and DLT groups. Survival after lung transplant in silicosis was previously examined in several small reports. 1221 24 9 16 17 et al 23 24 25 Lung transplantation in silicosis is challenging due to the difficulty of lung resection when the lungs have adhered to the chest wall, and multiple large, calcified lymph nodes are present. We demonstrated that operative times were significantly longer in the DLT group, though this is to be expected. 26 et al 12 et al The relatively low rate of intraoperative conversion from planned DLT to SLT (6 out of 25 cases, 24%) suggests that pre-allocation decision-making processes may be more influential in determining post-transplant outcomes than intraoperative surgical findings. This indicates that experienced transplant teams can effectively assess patient suitability for DLT versus SLT during preoperative evaluation, considering factors such as the extent of pleural adhesions, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and overall surgical risk. This finding supports the importance of thorough pre-transplant evaluation specifically tailored to the unique challenges posed by silicosis, including detailed chest imaging analysis and multidisciplinary team assessment to optimise surgical planning and resource allocation. This leads to the question of whether an SLT is a better option for patients with silicosis to minimise postoperative risk. Lung transplantation, whether single or double, serves as a therapeutic choice for individuals with advanced lung disease that does not respond to conventional medical treatment. 27 28 29 14 30 14 31 32 Our study has several limitations as it is a single-centre retrospective analysis. Although this is the largest cohort of patients with artificial stone silicosis who underwent a lung transplant, the number of patients was limited due to the relative rarity of this condition. Thus, it is important to acknowledge that the wide CIs for our survival analysis reflect the limited sample size and prevent us from concluding equivalence between SLT and DLT outcomes. Our findings should be interpreted as insufficient evidence to demonstrate differences rather than evidence of no difference between treatment approaches. The small sample size also made it impossible to adjust for relevant confounders, which limited our ability to make definitive claims regarding treatment effect. The predetermined procedure type, SLT versus DLT, also introduces potential pre-allocation bias. Additionally, our study did not include outcome measures such as the 6 min walk test, diffusion capacity, patient symptoms or quality of life measures, which would have provided valuable additional insights into transplant efficacy and functional recovery. While we were able to assess survival outcomes and basic pulmonary function tests, the inclusion of more detailed functional assessments could have enhanced our evaluation of the comparative benefits of SLT versus DLT and should be included in future prospective studies. Our study showed that lung transplantations due to silicosis comprised 5.14% of total lung transplants in the same period, while the rate is 0.2% in the American population. 25 22 33 In conclusion, our study highlights the significance of lung transplantation for the treatment of end-stage silicosis, suggesting comparable outcomes between SLT and DLT. Given the intricacies of the surgical procedure involved in lung transplantation for silicosis, including longer ischaemic times, an increased demand for blood products and longer ICU stay, coupled with the lack of definitive evidence supporting DLT in this population, it may be prudent to contemplate prioritising SLT for these patients. Larger, multicentre studies would help provide additional evidence regarding optimal transplant strategies in silicosis patients. As the incidence of silicosis remains high locally and globally, ongoing research and collaborative efforts become crucial in refining treatment strategies and enhancing outcomes for individuals affected by this condition.
