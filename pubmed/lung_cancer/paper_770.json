Methods Target gene silencing was achieved using the shRNA-mediated lentivirus method. Apoptosis was identified using the Annexin V PE/7-AAD double-staining assay. Cell viability was assessed with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Protein expression was detected by Western blotting. Results In vitro, knocking down CSE1L promoted caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteins expression and induced apoptosis in AML cells. Knockdown of CSE1L enhanced AML cells' sensitivity to Ara-c. knockdown of CSE1L reduced the expression levels of p-JKA2 and p-STAT3 proteins, while no significant difference was observed in the expression levels of total JAK2 and STAT3 proteins. Furthermore, JAK2 overexpression reversed the increase in Ara-c toxicity to AML cells caused by CSE1L knockdown. Conclusion In conclusion, our study reveals that CSE1L is a potential therapeutic target for overcoming Ara-c resistance in AML cells. Thus, we have gained new insights into the oncogenic process of CSE1L in AML cells and raised the prospect of knockdown of CSE1L in AML in combination with cytarabine-targeted therapy.
