Objectives CT and MRI scans of the shoulder can lead to the identification of incidental findings (IF), which can have a major impact on the further treatment of the patient. The aim of this retrospective study was to record the prevalence of IF, incidentalomas (IT) and malignant IT for CT and MRI examinations of the shoulder and to investigate the effect of patient characteristics on the statistical occurrence of IF, IT and malignant IT. Materials and methods A total of 903 shoulder examinations (415 CT, 488 MRI) were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of IF, subsequently categorized (harmless IF, IT requiring clarification, malignant IT) and analyzed regarding patient characteristics. The statistical analysis was carried out using independent t- and chi-square tests. A significance level of p < 0.05 was set. Results Among the 903 patients evaluated (436 female, 467 male), 153 (16.9%) patients experienced IF (harmless IF: 101 (11.2%) patients, IT: 94 (10.4%), malignant IT: 4 (0.4%). The average age of the patients without IF and IT was significantly lower compared to the patients with IF and IT (p < 0.001). While IF occurred in 31.1% of the CT, IF was only detected in 4.9% of the MRI (p < 0.001). Conclusion IF have a high prevalence (16.9%), especially in CT examinations of the shoulder, which increases with age. The exact detection and initiation of appropriate therapy is of great clinical importance, as early detection of life-threatening diseases enables more effective treatment and a potential gain in health and lifespan.

The standard imaging technique for assessing pathologies such as fractures, dislocations, bony injuries, soft tissue calcifications and joint deformities is conventional x-ray. For the diagnosis of more complex pathologies, such as rotator cuff tears, tumorous and inflammatory diseases, but also for the preoperative planning of total shoulder replacements, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently used. As both technologies continue to evolve, the number of imaging examinations will continue to rise in the near future. 1 2 3 , 4 4 , 5 6 7 8 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study design and ethics approval The present study is a retrospective, monocentric study at a Department of Orthopedics at the University Hospital XXX. A positive vote from the local Ethics Committee has been received (sign: 2021-854). 2.2 Data collection The patient data from the CT and MRI examinations were provided by the Department of Radiology of the University Hospital XXX. The radiological findings and reports were analyzed and completed by evaluating the digital patient files. The patient data was recorded in pseudonymized form in a database and graphically displayed using Microsoft® Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA). 2.3 Patient collective 1743 radiological studies of patients who received a CT or MRI examination of the shoulder between 2011 and 2021 were primarily included. Among these, all examinations of the shoulder with a primary orthopedic or trauma related question and which were indicated by the Department of Orthopedics (n = 1119) were included in this study. In addition, studies were excluded whose examination field of view was too small to show relevant other parts of the body besides the shoulder. For each patient, only the first examination in the specified evaluation period was evaluated. With this, 144 repeated examinations were excluded and each examination corresponds to a single patient. The entire patient population therefore comprised of 975 patients, of which 472 (48.4%) patients received a CT examination and 503 (51.6%) patients received an MRI examination. The entire study population (n = 975) was further evaluated regarding the orthopedic indication of each examination and a distinction was made as to whether it was only related to the shoulder or whether it also included other anatomical regions. Further regions included e.g. Skull, neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis. Only the examinations that exclusively examined the shoulder region were included (n = 903) ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Flow chart of the included examinations. Fig. 1 2.4 Recording and classification of incidental findings The radiological findings of each included examination were examined for the identification of IF and were included in the database. Only IF detected outside the shoulder which were previously unknown were considered. As mentioned before, each examination could yield multiple IF. Each IF was assigned to one of several possible categories based on its clinical relevance. IF, which had only little clinical relevance, were not pursued further, but were directly categorized as harmless IF 9 Table 1 Table 1 Harmless IF of the respective anatomic region (IF: incidental finding). Table 1 Anatomic region Harmless IF Head frontal hyperostosis, swelling or obstruction of the paranasal sinuses, osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint Neck arteriosclerosis, carotid elongation, carotid stenosis, hypoplastic vertebral artery, edema Spine and Skeletal degenerative changes, previous rib fracture, bone hemangioma, osteopenia, osteoporosis, rib sclerosis Thorax arteriosclerosis, fibroadenoma, gynecomastia, calcified lymph nodes, edema, lipomatosis, residual thymic tissue o Aorta: Aortic elongation, aortic kinking, aortic sclerosis o Axilla: hematoma, non-specific lymph nodes o Vascular anomalies: Artery lusoria, collateral circulation o Heart: cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac valve sclerosis, coronary sclerosis o Lung: atelectasis, dystelectasis, pleural calcification, lobe venae Abdomen arteriosclerosis, elevated diaphragm, stenosis of the celiac trunk o Gallbladder: cholelithiasis o Liver: liver cyst o Stomach: Hiatal hernia o Spleen: Accessory spleen, splenomegaly o Kidney: urinary stasis, nephrolithiasis, renal atrophy The categorization as harmless IF is consistent with the classification of Lumbreras et al., 9 Table 2 Table 2 Categorization of Incidental findings (IF: Incidental finding, IT: Incidentaloma). Table 2 IF Categories Description Harmless IF IF that most likely had no direct or little clinical relevance and required no further action IT IF that required further clarification or activity Malignant IT IF which is confirmed to be malignant by further investigation received disease value A step-by-step analysis of the patients and their characteristics was carried out based on the relevance of the findings in the three different IF categories. First, the patients who had IF with the highest relevance or disease value were considered as malignant IT, subsequently patients with IT and finally patients with IF. This made it possible to achieve a more differentiated determination of the prevalence for different scenarios according to IF relevance and scope of examination. 2.5 Recording of additional clinical parameters In addition to the IF, other patient and examination related data were recorded and evaluated. This includes data such as age, height and weight. It should be noted that information about height was only recorded for 40.5% (n = 395) and weight for only 47.2% (n = 460) of the total 975 patients, due to lack of data in patient files. Therefore, all information on height and weight refers only to these patients. In addition, two age groups were formed, with a distinction being made between adults (18–64 years) and seniors (65 years and older). This classification was based on the definitions of age groups as found in the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Thesaurus of the United States National Library of Medicine and used for indexing articles in the MEDLINE database. 10 2.6 Evaluation and statistical analysis The evaluation and statistical analysis of the data using independent t- and chi-square tests was carried out with the program IBM SPSS® Statistics (IBM Germany, Ehningen, Germany). The Fisher-Boschloo exact test was calculated using the NC State University website (Department of Statistics NC State University, 1996). P-values of <0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. 3 Results 3.1 Demographic data of the patient population A total of 903 patients were included in the study (436 (48.3%) females, 467 (51.7%) males, age: 55.41 ± 18.08 years). 621 (68.8%) patients belonged to the age group between 18 and 64 years and 282 (31.2%) to the age group of at least 65 years. In the age group of 18–64 years, the average age was 46.05 ± 12.95 years, in the group of at least 65 years average age was 76.03 ± 7.67 years. When the patients were separated according to the examination modality, the average age of the CT population was 62.78 ± 18.71 years, whereas that of the MRI population was 49.14 ± 14.91 years. Height was measured for 364 (40.3%) patients and ranged from 140 cm to 198 cm (170.36 ± 10.07 cm). Weight was reported for 420 (46.5%) patients and ranged from 30 kg to 150 kg (81.05 ± 19.82 kg) ( Table 3 Fig. 2 Table 3 Demographic data of patient population (SD = standard deviation). Table 3 n proportion of patients [%| average SD Age [years] 903 100 55.41 18.08 Age Group 18 64 [years] 621 68.8 46.05 12.95 Age Group >65 [years] 282 31.2 76.03 7.67 Height [cm] 364 40.3 170.36 10.07 Weight [kg] 420 46.5 81.05 19.82 Fig. 2 Distribution of age among included patients. Fig. 2 3.2 Incidental findings Among the 903 patients evaluated, IF occurred in 153 (16.9%) patients (harmless IF: 101 (11.2%), IT: 94 (10.4%), malignant IT: 4 (0.4%)). A total of 321 IFs (191 harmless IF, 117 IT and 13 malignant) occurred among these 153 patients, with each of these patients having between one to ten IFs (mean = 2.10) ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Occurrence of patients with different IF (patients can occur multiple times). Fig. 3 3.3 Harmless incidental findings 191 harmless IF occurred in 101 patients. The most common benign IF were degenerative changes of the thoracic spine, which occurred in 32 (3.5%) patients, followed by aortic sclerosis in 24 (2.7%) and other degenerative changes of the skeleton in 21 (2.3%) patients. In contrast to degenerative changes in the thoracic spine, the latter related to the entire skeleton. 3.4 Incidentalomas 117 IT in 94 patients were revealed during the evaluation. The most common IT were enlarged axillary lymph nodes in 23 (2.5%) patients, followed by thyroid goiter in 22 (2.4%) patients and pulmonary nodules in 18 (2.0%) patients. 3.5 Malignant incidentalomas During the investigation period, 13 IT turned out to be confirmed malignant in four patients. The most common malignant IT were osteolysis of the cervical spine and the skeleton, as well as pulmonary nodules, each occurring twice (0.2%). 3.6 Analysis of incidental findings Patients without IF were statistically significant younger (p < 0.001) and heavier (p = 0.002) than patients with IF. No statistical difference was found regarding height (p = 0.074). While the average age of patients without IT was 12.52 years lower (p < 0.001) and patients without IT weighing an average of 7.11 kg more (p = 0.014) than patient with IT, there was no significant difference regarding height (p = 0.180). No statistically significant differences regarding age, weight and height were obtained regarding the appearance of malignant IT ( Table 4 Table 4 Comparison of IF findings regarding age, weight and height (IF: incidental finding, IT: incidentaloma, MIT: malignant incidentaloma). Table 4 IF ∅ p (IF vs. ∅ IT ∅ p ∅ MIT ∅ p (MIT vs. ∅ Age [years] 66.48 53.15 <0.001 66.63 54.11 <0.001 71.50 55.34 0.074 Weight [kg] 75.03 82.46 0.002 74.85 81.96 0.014 70.33 81.12 0.348 Height [cm] 168.38 170.81 0.074 168.45 170.63 0.180 168.67 170.38 0.770 Analysis of gender remained without significant differences (IF: 19.0% women vs. 15.0% men, p = 0.105; IT: 12.2% women vs. 8.8% men, p = 0.097; malignant IT: women 0.5% vs. 0.4% men, p = 1.000). Significant differences in age groups were obtained for IF and IT, not for malignant IT. In case of administration of contrast agent, significant differences were only shown in IF ( Table 5 Table 5 Comparison of IF findings regarding age group and administration of contrast agent (IF: incidental finding, IT: incidentaloma, MIT: malignant incidentaloma). Table 5 Age 18-64 Age>64 p-value Contrast Agent ∅ Contrast Agent p-value IF 9.8% 32.6% <0.001 26.6% 16.2% 0.033 IT 6.1% 19.9% <0.001 14.1% 10.1% 0.321 MIT 0.2% 1.1% 0.070 0.5% 0.0% 1.000 When considering the modality, 129 CT scans and 24 MRI examinations showed IF. As a result, IF occurred in 31.1% of the 415 CT examinations and 4.9% of the 488 MRI examinations. There was a statistically significant relationship between modality and occurrence of IF (p < 0.001). Further analysis of IT revealed statistically significant association between modality and occurrence of IT (p < 0.001) with 18.8% of the CT scans and 3.3% of the MRI examinations. All four examinations with malignant IT were CT examinations. The MRI examinations did not reveal any malignant IT in all 488 patients. This resulted in a frequency of 1.0% for malignant IT in CT examinations with a statistically significant relationship between modality and occurrence of malignant IT (p = 0.031). 4 Discussion Our results indicate that IF have a high prevalence in high resolution shoulder imaging and that they are more frequently found in CT scans compared to MRI examinations, presumably caused by the confined field of view as a limiting factor in MRI and the higher age in the CT population. While IF occurred in 31.1% of the CT, IF were only detected in 4.9% of the MRI scans. Harmless IF occurred in 101 (11.2%) patients, IT in 94 (10.4%) and malignant IT in four (0.4%). Additionally, IF and IT prevalence are significantly higher in older patients. There was no significant correlation between prevalence of malignant IT findings and demographic data found. In the literature, there exist limited evidence regarding the prevalence of IF in shoulder imaging. While there are only few studies investigating the prevalence of incidental shoulder enchondromas 11 12 13 , 14 15 Previous studies investigating IF prevalence in shoulder imaging reported similar results to our findings. Chen et al. investigated the prevalence as well as the clinical impact of IF on preoperative 3D planning CT scans for total shoulder arthroplasty. 3 7 16 4 4 Like shown in our own study, previous published studies reported that the frequency of IF occurrence varies between different modalities. 9 , 17 , 18 9 Additionally, the prevalence of IFs not only varies with imaging modality, but is also influenced by patient age. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 18 15 15 In the literature, a strong association between higher weight and more frequent occurrence of IF and IT is reported. 27 28 With an increasing number of imaging examinations in the future as well as the higher spatial resolution at which these examinations are carried out, 29 , 30 20 , 31 4 15 32 For the majority of IF, it can be stated that they usually do not represent true neoplasms or at least are not associated with clinical morbidity. 33 19 34 24 8 1 35 9 36 This study has some limitations that need to be mentioned. In this retrospective, descriptive study, the radiological findings were evaluated, but not the originally recorded examination material. Therefore, only IFs that were discovered and recorded by the radiologist could be evaluated. This leaves an uncontrollable risk of false-negative findings. Some studies whose examination field of view was too small to show relevant other parts of the body besides the shoulder were primarily excluded, but there may be instances in which the incidental finding is inherent to the structures of the shoulder itself (e.g., a chondroid lesion in the humeral head, an intramuscular lipoma within a rotator cuff muscle). Therefore, there could be some missed findings. A further limitation was the comparability of the examination volumes, especially of the CT examinations. Despite the same clinical question and the requested examination, volumes of different sizes were recorded and evaluated. Therefore, it can be assumed that studies with unusually small or large volumes could distort the determined prevalence. Furthermore, certain findings can be classified as either harmless or relevant depending on the patient's age. 9 5 Conclusion IF have a high prevalence (16.9%), especially in CT examinations of the shoulder, which increases with age. With an increasing number of imaging examinations in the future and an aging society, the prevalence of IF will probably continue to increase over the next few years. The exact detection and initiation of appropriate therapy is therefore of great clinical importance, as early detection of life-threatening diseases enables more effective treatment and a potential gain in health and lifespan. Therefore, further evidence-based classification systems and guidelines should be developed to establish an effective and confident clinical management of IF.
