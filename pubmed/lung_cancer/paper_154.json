Clinical efficacy Clinical trials have shown that KRAS G12C inhibitors improved objective response rates and progression-free survival compared with standard treatments. These trials have obtained promising results in personalized cancer therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring the KRASG12C mutation. Importance of co-mutations Co-mutations in genes like KEAP1, SMARCA4 and CDKN2A can significantly impact patient outcomes and response to KRAS G12C inhibitors, with certain co-mutations associated with poor prognosis. Pharmacokinetics & safety Each KRAS G12C inhibitor comes with its own pharmacokinetics profile. Sotorasib and adagrasib are both well tolerated, though gastrointestinal adverse events are common and can be managed with supportive care. Predictive biomarkers Liquid biopsies show promise in detecting KRAS mutations, monitoring treatment response and predicting overall survival, making them a valuable tool in managing NSCLC. Resistance mechanisms Development of resistance to KRAS inhibitors can occur through various genetic alterations and activation of alternative pathways. Combination therapies may help overcome these resistance mechanisms. Future directions Ongoing and future clinical trials aim to further explore the efficacy of KRAS G12C inhibitors, their combinations with immunotherapies, and other novel compounds to improve treatment outcomes in NSCLC.
