Isolated unilateral absence of pulmonary artery is a rare congenital malformation and often asymptomatic in adults. However, aneurysm formation in the aortopulmonary collateral vessels carries a potential risk of life-threatening hemorrhage. This case report describes a 79-year-old woman who presented with rupture of a mediastinal collateral aneurysm associated with isolated unilateral absence of pulmonary artery. We discuss the clinical course, including vascular morphology changes, and subsequent endovascular treatment. Notably, this case demonstrates the rupture of a de novo collateral aneurysm rather than a preexisting one.

However, it can also present alone, known as isolated UAPA (IUAPA), with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 200,000 adults. 1 2 3 , 4 Case report A 79-year-old woman with a history of IUAPA, right-sided aortic arch, aortic stenosis (without other congenital anomalies such as bicuspid aortic valve) treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation 4 years prior, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and rheumatoid arthritis presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden-onset chest and back pain. Recent medication history included an oral corticosteroid for rheumatoid arthritis discontinued 1 month before presentation and oral lascufloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic, taken for parotid swelling for 2 days before admission. Hemodynamic status on arrival was stable. Blood biochemical findings were largely within normal reference ranges, except for a decreased hemoglobin level (10.1 g/dL). Acute myocardial infarction was excluded in the emergency department. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 20-mm pseudoaneurysm arising from a fusiform 30 mm aneurysm in the mediastinal collateral vessels, surrounded by mediastinal hematoma without extravasation ( Fig 1 Supplementary Fig Fig 2 Fig 1 Computed tomography angiography (CTA) image showing a 20-mm pseudoaneurysm surrounded by mediastinal hematoma. Arrow Fig 2 Reconstructed computed tomography angiography (CTA) images showing the absence of the left main pulmonary artery and excessive systemic-to-pulmonary collateral arteries with multiple aneurysms ( red Arrow A 6F guiding sheath (Destination; Terumo) was inserted through the right common femoral artery. A mediastinal collateral artery arising from the distal descending aorta was coaxially catheterized with a 5F polyurethane catheter (RLG; Hanako Medical) and a 1.7F microcatheter (Carnelian Pixie; Tokai Medical Products). Angiography demonstrated that this artery supplied the left lower lung lobe and revealed a saccular pseudoaneurysm originating from a fusiform aneurysm located in the middle third of the collateral artery ( Fig 3 A Fig 3 B Fig 3 (A) arrow Arrowheads (B) arrow (C) arrow No postprocedural complications were encountered, and CT performed after the embolization confirmed NBCA filling within the aneurysm and adjacent arteries ( Fig 3 C Discussion Ruptured aortopulmonary collateral aneurysms associated with IUAPA are extremely rare. In this case, CT angiography (CTA) imaging from 4 years before the rupture allowed for longitudinal morphological assessment. Notably, no abnormalities were detected at the eventual rupture site on the prerupture CTA, although five other aneurysms visible on the same prerupture CTA that did not change in size on postrupture CTA. These findings indicate that new collateral aneurysms may form and rupture at a faster rate than preexisting ones. However, owing to the absence of interval imaging between the prerupture and postrupture CTAs, the growth rate of the ruptured aneurysm could not be evaluated. Aneurysm formation observed in patients with aortopulmonary collaterals is thought to be caused by chronic high-flow velocities through excessive collateral arteries. 5 6 Although no consensus exists on the risk of vascular injury with fluoroquinolone use, the US Food and Drug Administration has warned against their use in high-risk patients, including those with a history of aneurysms of the aorta or other blood vessels. Although the exact mechanism has not been confirmed, quinolones exhibit a high affinity for connective tissues. Adverse events such as Achilles tendon rupture can occur within 48 hours of starting fluoroquinolone treatment. 7 8 No consensus has been reached regarding the optimal management of hemorrhage from collateral vessels in patients with IUAPA. Therapeutic management should be guided by the clinical presentation and the patient's anatomy, including associated collateral circulation. 1 , 9 1 10 Transcatheter treatment of pseudoaneurysms can be performed by embolization of the inflow and outflow vessels. Embolic agents such as coils and NBCA are commonly used materials. Coils are generally preferred when the microcatheter can reach the outflow vessels, because the risk of tissue ischemia is lower than with NBCA. However, NBCA provides an effective alternative in cases where catheterization of the outflow vessel is not possible, 11 Conclusions Aneurysm formation in the aortopulmonary collaterals in patients with IUAPA is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. This case demonstrates the clinical course and vascular morphology changes before and after aneurysm rupture, highlighting the importance of careful observation not only of known aneurysms but also of the entire collateral vasculature on imaging.
