Introduction Iran, with its expansive geography and diverse climate zones, is recognized as one of the most botanically rich countries in the world. Hosting more than 8000 identified plant species, including 1727 endemics, Iran ranks among the top ten countries globally in terms of floristic diversity [ 1 2 Tripleurospermum disciforme 3 Chrysanthemum disciforme Chamaemelum disciforme Matricaria disciformis 4 Anthemis nobilis Anthemis wiedemanniana Matricaria chamomilla Tripleurospermum disciforme 5 T. disciforme Matricaria chamomilla 6 The genus Tripleurospermum 7 8 9 9 10 11 12 Tripleurospermum 13 Tripleurospermum 13 14 In addition, triterpenoids such as taraxasteol, lupeol, and betulinic acid have been identified in T. disciforme 15 16 17 18 T. disciforme The therapeutic efficacy of T. disciforme 19 20 21 22 23 24 Ethnobotany serves as a vital bridge between ancestral knowledge and contemporary science, focusing on the documentation, analysis, and interpretation of plant use within specific cultural and ecological contexts [ 8 T. disciforme T. disciforme In this context, we hypothesize that Tripleurospermum disciforme 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Ethnobotanical Surveys In this ethnobotanical study, a total of 100 residents from the provinces of Guilan, Qazvin, and Alborz were interviewed. Participants were recruited through a convenience sampling strategy, based on voluntary participation at local herbal markets. The results indicated that individuals aged between 30 and 49 years represented the primary users of medicinal plants, accounting for 58% of respondents, whereas those aged over 70 showed the lowest rate of use, comprising only 1%. These findings are in line with ethnobotanical research conducted in Angola, where individuals within the same age range were identified as the most frequent users of medicinal plants [ 25 Furthermore, this study revealed that 84% of medicinal plant users were natives of the Guilan, Karaj, and Qazvin provinces. The data also support previous findings indicating that women were the predominant consumers of medicinal plants compared to men [ 25 26 27 25 28 Ethnobotanical studies reveal that a significant portion of people acquire medicinal plants by purchasing them at markets or specialized stores ( Figure 1 Ethnobotanical research further indicates that the use of medicinal plants reaches its peak during transitional seasons, particularly in both the rainy season and the dry season ( Figure 1 25 In the provinces of Guilan, Qazvin, and Karaj, the reliance on medicinal plants was predominantly influenced by communal knowledge and shared experiences, with 65% of users indicating that their use was based on the experiences of others ( Figure 2 25 As for plant conservation practices, 21% of participants reported using shade-drying methods to preserve medicinal plants ( Figure 2 The present survey demonstrated that the most frequently cited plants belong to the Lamiaceae family ( Figure 3 29 30 According to our findings, the two families Lamiaceae and Asteraceae represent the most widely used medicinal plants. Similar results have been reported in other regions of Iran, including the forests of Arasbaran [ 31 32 33 34 Based on the therapeutic indications of the medicinal plants, most were employed to treat disorders of the digestive system (26%), followed by those related to nervous system disorders (20%) (see Figure 3 Moreover, a separate study conducted by [ 35 36 37 38 39 Regarding preparation methods, infusion was the most preferred technique among users, employed in 45% of cases, followed by decoction (19%), use in natural form (15%), and maceration (13%). Comparable trends have been observed in other regions of Iran, where infusion and decoction are also the predominant methods of preparation [ 40 These methods are often preferred due to their simplicity and the use of water as a solvent, as highlighted in previous studies [ 26 41 Furthermore, the highest proportion of medicinal plant use has been attributed to leaves, accounting for 39% in the Arasbaran forests of northern Iran [ 31 42 43 33 31 34 It is important to note that, although this approach provided direct access to key informants and facilitated the collection of relevant data, the sample size (n = 100) was relatively limited and no stratification by age, gender, or specific communities was performed. Consequently, the results should be interpreted with caution, as the data may not fully represent the wider population and may be subject to selection bias, particularly favouring individuals more actively involved in local herbal trade. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, the survey offers valuable exploratory evidence on regional practices and provides a foundation for future studies employing stratified or larger-scale sampling strategies. Quantitative Statistical Analysis of Ethnobotanical Results The Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) values ranged from 0 to 1, indicating the level of agreement among informants on plant use for specific ailments. Low values suggest diverse or uncertain knowledge, while high values reflect strong consensus and likely indicate culturally important and trusted remedies. The recorded traditional uses were grouped by therapeutic indications ( Table 1 The highest ICF value (0.85) was verified for the digestive system, followed by the nervous system (0.82) and wound healing (0.77). Although all ICF values were greater than 0.5, the lowest ICF was obtained for the urinary system. The strong preference of the local population for specific medicinal plants, based on their therapeutic applications, is supported by high fidelity level (FL) values ( Table 2 For instance, Mentha Mentha Mentha piperita 44 Cinnamomum zeylanicum 45 Camellia sinensis Tripleurospermum disciforme Tripleurospermum 13 Camellia sinensis 46 Tripleurospermum disciforme Thymus vulgaris Thymus daenensis Thymus eriocalyx Mentha spicata Mentha longifolia 43 Tripleurospermum disciforme Thymus lancifolius Mentha spicata Mentha longifolia 47 Of particular interest is Thymus kotschyanus 48 49 50 In the domain of gastrointestinal health, Echium amoenum 51 Stachys lavandulifolia 47 51 52 Echium amoenum Tripleurospermum disciforme Stachys turcomanica 34 Crocus sativus 53 54 55 Crocus sativus 56 57 Finally, Zingiber officinale 58 59 Table 3 The most frequently cited species in the dataset were Tripleurospermum disciforme Thymus kotschyanus Echium amoenum Mentha Our findings align with previous ethnobotanical investigations conducted in Bojnord, North Khorasan Province, Iran, where Tripleurospermum disciforme Echium amoenum Tripleurospermum disciforme 34 Mentha longifolia Mentha spicata Mentha piperita Thymus daenensis Thymus eriocalyx Tripleurospermum disciforme 43 T. disciforme Thymus lancifolius Achillea biebersteinii 47 Thymus lancifolius 47 Zingiber officinale 60 61 62 63 64 65 The UV metric, which indicates the relative importance of a plant based on the frequency of its reported use by informants, further supports these findings. The highest UVs were recorded for Tripleurospermum disciforme Thymus kotschyanus Echium amoenum Crocus sativus Camellia sinensis Rosmarinus Cinnamomum zeylanicum Lavandula angustifolia Stachys lavandulifolia Malva sylvestris Zingiber officinale Previous studies have validated the therapeutic potential of Lavendula angustifolium 56 66 67 Lavandula angustifolia Camellia sinensis Salix aegyptiaca Salix aegyptiaca Stachys lavandulifolia Citrus aurantium Cinnamomum zeylanicum Rosmarinus officinalis Mentha pulegium Mentha longifolia Mentha piperita Mentha aquatica Mentha spicata Crocus sativus Echium amoenum Tripleurospermum disciforme Tripleurospermum disciforme Rosmarinus officinalis Rosa x damascena Thymus vulgaris Thymus daenensis Thymus eriocalyx Thymus lancifolius Adiantum capillus veneris Salvia sclarea Malva sylvestris Achillea santolinoides Wilhelmsii Achillea millefolium Achillea biebersteinii Achillea wilhelmsii Achillea Urtica urens Ziziphora clinopodioides Salvia officinalis Camellia sinensis 34 35 43 47 51 56 68 69 2.2. Tripleurospermum Disciforme Among the medicinal plants documented in the ethnobotanical survey, Tripleurospermum disciforme 2.2.1. Phytochemical Characterization The untargeted metabolomic profiling of Tripleurospermum disciforme Table 4 m z p Differences in the phytochemical profiles were evident depending on the solvent used, with methanol and ethyl acetate showing greater extractive efficiency compared to hexane, particularly for polar and mid-polar metabolites. These findings highlight the importance of solvent selection in non-targeted metabolomic studies and reflect the chemical diversity of the extracts. The annotation strategy, integrating accurate mass, isotopic pattern, MS/MS fragmentation, and ion mobility data, aligns with current standards in untargeted metabolomics and offers a high degree of confidence for structural assignment. Although further validation through analytical standards or orthogonal techniques could complement the results, the adopted workflow provides a comprehensive and reliable overview of the metabolite composition of Tripleurospermum disciforme A detailed list of the annotated compounds, along with their chromatographic, spectral, and ion mobility properties, is available in Supplementary Table S1 Figure 4 Figure 5 2.2.2. Antioxidant Activity Among the evaluated extracts of Tripleurospermum disciforme 50 Table 5 In contrast, recent studies [ 70 50 Tripleurospermum insularum 71 Tripleurospermum disciforme 72 Tripleurospermum disciforme 20 Tripleurospermum disciforme Tripleurospermum insularum 71 70 Tripleurospermum disciforme 22 73 Tripleurospermum insularum 71 74 Here, considering the very strong antioxidant activity of ethyl acetate extract, it can be suggested that chlorogenic acid may play a role in this activity, due to its absence in other extracts. Chlorogenic acid (5-O-caffeoylquinic acid) is a phenolic compound belonging to the hydroxycinnamic acid family. It is known for its wide range of beneficial health effects, including managing metabolic syndrome, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activity, lipid-lowering and blood pressure-regulating properties, and predominantly significant antioxidant activity [ 75 76 77 78 79 13 80 81 82 83 2.3. Antimicrobial Activity In the disc diffusion assay ( Supplementary Table S2 Regarding MIC determination ( Table 6 B. cereus T. disciforme S. aureus T. disciforme As found in this study, previous studies showed that T. disciforme Staphylococcus epidermidis S. aureus 20 T. disciforme Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa Candida albicans Aspergillus niger, Bacillus cereus Bacillus subtilis 20 Bacillus cereus Bacillus subtilis 84 85 86 O Bacillus 87 88 89 B. subtilis 89 In turn, several studies have highlighted the strong antimicrobial properties of essential oils derived from various plants, including T. disciforme S. aureus B. subtilis Klebsiella pneumoniae E. coli P. aeruginosa 90 T. disciforme T. disciforme 91 However, further studies are required to explore its full therapeutic potential and to identify the specific bioactive compounds responsible for its antimicrobial properties. 2.4. Cellular Viability The effect of T. disciforme v v Figure 6 In NHDF cells, the chloroform and methanol extracts displayed similar patterns: both the solvent controls and the lowest extract concentrations (0.05 and 0.5 mg/mL) significantly reduced cell viability when compared to the untreated control.

The chloroform extract induced a strong cytotoxic effect: chloroform alone significantly reduced viability ( p p p p In contrast, the methanol and ethyl acetate extracts produced no statistically significant effects on MCF-7 viability at any concentration. Although fluctuations were noted, particularly at 0.5 mg/mL ethyl acetate, where a slight increase in viability was observed, the high variability and lack of significance indicate minimal impact on tumour cell metabolism or survival. The hexane extract, however, induced this effect in MCF-7 cells. At 0.5 mg/mL, viability was significantly increased ( p p Collectively, these findings indicate that T. disciforme These results highlight the potential of T. disciforme 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Ethnobotanical Surveys 3.1.1. Guilan, Qazvin, and Alborz Provinces Geo-Ethnographical Profile Guilan Province is located in the north and northwest of Iran, covering an area of 14,711 km 2 92 The northern provinces of the country Guilan, Mazandaran, and Golestan, as well as the Talesh region in Azerbaijan, are home to 3234 vascular plant species, encompassing 856 genera and 148 families. Of these, 475 species of medicinal plants have been identified in the forests of Guilan Province [ 93 94 The population of Qazvin Province was approximately 1.3 million, with 600,000 residing in Qazvin City. Despite comprising only 1% of Iran’s total land area, it is in the northern half of the country, between latitudes 35°37′ and 36°45′ N and longitudes 48°45′ and 50°50′ E. Although it ranks as the 26th largest province in Iran, Qazvin boasts a remarkably diverse climate due to its position between the arid central plateau and the northeastern mountainous regions. The province also exhibits significant altitudinal variation, with Siyalan Mountain reaching 4175 m as its highest point and the banks of Manjil Dam Lake at 300 m as its lowest. This elevation disparity greatly influences both precipitation and temperature. Annual rainfall varies from 210 mm in the eastern regions to 550 mm in the northwest, while temperature fluctuations are considerable, with extreme highs recorded in the central plains and severe lows in the northwestern highlands of Avaj. Average temperatures gradually decrease from the lowlands toward the foothills and mountainous areas [ 95 Alborz Province, covering 519,391.5 ha, constitutes approximately 0.3% of Iran’s total land area. Geographically, it lies between 50° and 51.30° east longitude and 30.35° and 30.36° north latitude, positioned along the southern slopes of the Alborz mountain range. The province exhibits diverse topographical characteristics. Its northern areas ascend to altitudes of 4104 m, forming a continuous mountain range stretching from east to west. Meanwhile, the central region consists primarily of plains, sitting at an average altitude of approximately 1500 m. Overall, most of the province lies at elevations ranging from 1500 to 2000 m [ 96 3.1.2. Field Interview This survey was conducted over a six-month period during the first semester of 2023. A semi-structured, face-to-face questionnaire was administered to 100 local individuals in the herbal markets of the Guilan, Qazvin, and Alborz provinces. The questionnaire primarily focused on ethnobotanical claims and traditional beliefs held by local communities in these three regions. It also gathered demographic and personal information, including respondents’ age, gender, relationship with the locality, education level, knowledge level, most used plants, plant identification, utilized plant parts, and methods of preparation. Subsequently, scientific identification and authentication of the cited plants were carried out using Flora Iranica [ 97 98 6 69 www.theplantlist.org 3.1.3. Quantitative Analysis of the Ethnobotanical Results All statistical results were firstly prepared using Microsoft Excel 2013 (Windows, Washington, DC, USA). Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) was utilized to assess the consistency of traditional knowledge regarding plant usage across various ailment categories, using Equation (1) ICF = (N ur t ur (1) ur t 26 41 Fidelity level (FL) index was assessed to identify the most culturally significant plant species associated with specific health conditions, especially in cases where multiple species are used for the same ailment. The FL was calculated using Equation (2) FL = (Np/N × 100) (2) 26 41 Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC) index does not differentiate between specific uses or categories of use for a plant; it is simply a general record of how often a plant is cited in relation to any reported use by an individual. This means that it reflects the frequency with which a plant is mentioned in ethnobotanical studies, but it does not provide detailed information about the specific purpose or category (e.g., medicinal, culinary) for which the plant is used. The RFC index is expressed by Equation (3) RFC = FC/N (3) 26 41 Use value (UV) index was calculated using Equation (4) to gauge the overall significance of each plant species in the local traditional knowledge system, i.e., UV = ΣUi/N (4) 26 41 3.2. Collection and Identification of Plant Materials The dried flowering tops of Tripleurospermum disciforme 3.3. Extraction (Preparation of Extracts) About 1500 g of the top flowers of T. disciforme T. disciforme 3.4. Phytochemical Characterization and Phenolic Profile An untargeted metabolomic approach was employed to characterize the phytochemical composition of the samples. Analyses were conducted by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) coupled to a trapped ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometer (timsTOF-MS; Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany), equipped with a VIP-HESI electrospray ionization source. Samples were previously dissolved in minimal volumes of hexane, ethyl acetate, or methanol, and 5 µL of each solution was injected into a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C18 RRHD column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.8 µm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Chromatographic separation was achieved using a binary mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B), under a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The gradient programme lasted 30 min, including a re-equilibration phase. Mass spectrometric detection was performed in both positive and negative ionization modes. The capillary voltage was set at ±4500 V and the end plate was offset at ±500 V. Nitrogen was used as the nebulising gas (8 bar), drying gas (8 L/min at 240 °C), and sheath gas (4 L/min at 450 °C). Spectra were acquired over an m z 0 2 Data processing was carried out using Data Analysis MetaboScape m z Combining these approaches, a total of 43 tentative identifications were obtained through SL + AL + SF. Additional matches were retrieved using AL + SF (237 features), SL + SF (64 features), and SF alone (1605 features). 3.5. Biological Activities Evaluation 3.5.1. Antioxidant Activity The antioxidant activity was evaluated using the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay. A calibration curve was constructed with methanol solutions of DPPH (85–4.25 mg/L). Absorbance was measured at 517 nm, and the capacity of free radical scavenging was calculated accordingly to Luís et al. [ 99 50 99 100 3.5.2. Antimicrobial Activity Microorganisms and Media Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts were tested against three Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus Enterococcus faecalis Bacillus cereus Pseudomonas aeruginosa Salmonella Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae Acinetobacter baumannii Determination of Disc Diffusion Assay The antimicrobial activity of Tripleurospermum disciforme w v 8 Determination of Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) The MIC of the extracts was evaluated by the microdilution method as described by [ 101 5 3.6. In Vitro Studies Using NHDF and MCF-7 Cells 3.6.1. Cell Culture Human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7; ATCC ® ® Cells were routinely maintained in 75 cm 2 2 At confluence, adherent cells were detached using trypsin-EDTA solution (0.125 g/L trypsin and 0.02 g/L EDTA). Prior to each experiment, cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion using a Neubauer haemocytometer, and suspensions were adjusted to the required density in the appropriate complete culture medium. 3.6.2. Preparation of the Solutions of the Compounds Under Study Hexane, chloroform, methanol, and ethyl acetate extracts of T. disciforme 3.6.3. Cytotoxicity Assay and Protein Quantification NHDF and MCF-7 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 4 2 Cells were exposed for 48 h to T. disciforme In one plate per cell type, antiproliferative activity was assessed using the MTT assay. Following 48 h exposure, the medium was aspirated and cells were washed with 100 µL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). MTT solution (5 mg/mL in PBS) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After removal of the MTT solution, formazan crystals were solubilised in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an xMark™ microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). In parallel plates, total protein content was quantified using the Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, cat. no. 23227), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, after treatment, cells were washed with PBS, and plates were wrapped in aluminum foil and frozen at −20 °C for at least 24 h. The working reagent was prepared by mixing 50 parts of Reagent A with 1 part of Reagent B. Plates were thawed, and 20 µL of PBS was added to each well, followed by 200 µL of working reagent. Plates were mixed on a shaker for 30 s and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, absorbance was recorded at 562 nm, and protein concentration was determined against a standard curve. 3.6.4. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 10.6.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). Comparisons among multiple groups were conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. For pairwise comparisons, Student’s t p For each experimental condition, the mean absorbance values obtained from the MTT assay and protein quantification were calculated, and the ratio of MTT/protein was determined. This normalization allowed for the evaluation of metabolic activity relative to total protein content, thereby distinguishing whether changes in MTT reduction reflected variations in cell number (biomass) or alterations in cellular metabolic activity. 4.
