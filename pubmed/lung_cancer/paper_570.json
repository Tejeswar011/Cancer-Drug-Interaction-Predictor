The aim is to characterize serum exosome protein expression profiles in patients diagnosed with OLP and to identify potential disease-associated candidate proteins. Methods Serum samples were collected from 30 participants, comprising erosive OLP patients, non-erosive OLP patients, and healthy controls (n = 10 per group). Serum exosome proteomes were compared across groups following validation of exosomal integrity using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Western blotting. Label-free quantitative proteomic profiling was performed with Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometry, integrated with bioinformatics analyses to identify differentially expressed proteins. Results About 138 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs, 39↑/99↓) in OLP patients vs controls, with subtype-specific profiles (70 DEPs in non-erosive, 99 in erosive). Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that these proteins were predominantly associated with extracellular vesicles, protein binding, and immune response regulation. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis highlighted enrichment in the complement and coagulation cascade ( p Conclusion The identified differentially expressed proteins in serum exosomes and their association with the complement and coagulation cascade pathway appear to contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of OLP. FN1 and C3 dysregulation directly contributes to OLP pathogenesis via immune-stromal crosstalk. Core proteins such as FN1 and C3 may serve as promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, warranting further validation.

It commonly presents with mucosal irritation, xerostomia, pain, and other inflammatory symptoms, resulting in diminished quality of life for affected patients. Clinically, OLP is classified into two major forms: the non-erosive type, which is characterized by white striae, and the erosive type, which is associated with mucosal ulceration and greater discomfort. 1 2 3 4 The etiology of OLP is not yet fully understood, with potential contributing factors, including immune dysregulation, microbial infection, local mucosal trauma or chronic irritation, and genetic predisposition. 5–7 8 9 Exosomes are small, cell-derived extracellular vesicles measuring approximately 50 to 200 nm in diameter. These vesicles encapsulate molecular contents reflective of their cells of origin and serve as key mediators of intercellular communication. Exosomes are involved in various physiological and pathological processes, including immune modulation, regulation of cellular differentiation, and facilitation of viral transmission. 10–12 13 Previous studies on exosomes in OLP have primarily focused on the RNA level. Plasma exosomes from OLP patients showed significantly upregulated miR-34a-5p, Hcmv-miR-UL59 from OLP patients. 14 15 16 Due to inconsistencies between gene and protein levels, and given that protein diversity far exceeds that of genes and involves more complex classification, further research into the protein components of serum exosomes in OLP is warranted. Experimental Section In this study, serum samples were collected from healthy individuals and patients diagnosed with different OLP subtypes (erosive, non-erosive). Through comparative proteomic profiling of serum exosomes, we aimed to identify disease-associated proteins that could serve as novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers at the serum protein level. Research Participants Patients diagnosed with OLP who visited the Department of Oral Mucosa at Fujian Medical University Union Hospital between September 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, and who met the inclusion criteria, were enrolled in this study. The required sample size was determined using PASS 15.0.5 software with a test power of 0.90 and an allowable error of 1%, resulting in a target of 20 patients. Given the higher prevalence of OLP among women, the enrolled cohort consisted of 4 male and 16 female patients, with ages ranging from 27 to 68 years (mean age: 53 ± 9 years). 17 Inclusion criteria: (1) Clinical features consistent with non-erosive OLP (slightly elevated white lacy striae forming reticular or radial lesions or white plaques on the oral mucosa) or erosive OLP (presence of mucosal erosion and ulcers), with diagnosis confirmed by tissue biopsy and histopathology, according to the World Health Organization definition of OLP. (2) Absence of systemic diseases, including infectious, allergic, or autoimmune conditions. (3) Absence of other known oral mucosal disorders. (4) No evidence of gingivitis or periodontitis. Histopathological criteria: Presence of a well-defined, band-like lymphocytic infiltration confined to the superficial connective tissue, accompanied by liquefaction degeneration of the basal cell layer, and absence of epithelial dysplasia. Exclusion criteria: (1) History of smoking or alcohol abuse; current pregnancy or lactation. (2) Concurrent infectious, allergic, cardiovascular, hematological, or endocrine disorders. (3) Use of systemic or topical anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory drugs within the past 3 months. (4) Presence of oral lichenoid reactions, including lichenoid contact reactions and drug-induced lichenoid eruptions.

Sample Collection and Processing Samples were collected from each participant individually. All participants were instructed to fast and refrain from drinking liquids after 8:00 PM the night prior to sample collection. 18 Serum Exosome Extraction Exosome isolation and purification were performed as follows. Serum samples were thawed in a 25°C water bath and then incubated on ice. Sequential gradient centrifugation was conducted at 4°C: first at 2,000 × g for 10 minutes, followed by 10,000 × g for 30 minutes. The resulting supernatant was collected at each step. Column chromatography purification was then performed. A 500 μL aliquot of the sample was loaded onto the column after discarding the initial buffer. The bottom cap of the SEC column was removed to collect successive 0.5 mL fractions. The first 3 mL (void volume) was discarded. Once the sample reached the top screen of the column, additional buffer was added, and a 1.5 mL high-purity exosome fraction was collected. For ultrafiltration concentration, the ultrafiltration tube was pre-activated by pre-cooling in an ice bath, followed by filtration with ultrapure water for 5 minutes. A sample volume ≤ 4 mL was then loaded and centrifuged at 7,500 × g for 30 minutes. The final product was resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by vortexing and recovered by washing the membrane surface five times to ensure complete yield. Serum Exosome Characterization and Validation Exosome Protein Extraction and Quantification A defined volume of exosome PBS resuspension was collected, and an equal volume of radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer was added for lysis and protein extraction. The mixture was incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes, with agitation every 10 minutes. Following lysis, samples were centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 15 minutes at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a new centrifuge tube. Protein concentration of the exosomes was determined using a BCA assay working solution. Exosome WB Identification Gel electrophoresis was conducted based on the molecular weight of the target protein using 1.5 mm thick glass plates and 15-well sample combs. Initial electrophoresis was performed at a constant voltage of 80 V until the loading buffer indicator reached the separating gel, after which the voltage was increased to 120 V and continued until the indicator reached the bottom of the gel. Membrane transfer was carried out using a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane with a pore size of 0.22 μm under a constant current of 200 mA for 90 minutes. The membrane was then blocked with 5% skim milk powder diluted in PBS with Tween ® Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis Stored frozen samples were thawed in a 25°C water bath and subsequently placed on ice. Exosome samples were diluted using 1× PBS and directly analyzed using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). Transmission Electron Microscopy Detection A 5 μL aliquot of the exosome sample was deposited onto a copper grid and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes. Excess liquid was gently removed using absorbent paper. One drop of 2% uranyl acetate was added to the grid and incubated for 1 minute at room temperature. Excess solution was removed using absorbent paper, and the grid was air-dried for 20 minutes before observation under the transmission electron microscope (TEM). Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics Analysis Proteomic sample preparation was conducted as follows: 10 μL of magnetic beads were washed with PBS and resuspended in 25 μL PBS. The exosome samples were added, and two incubation cycles of 5 minutes each were performed to allow binding. Following magnetic separation and removal of the supernatant, 100 μL lysis buffer (containing 7 M urea, 2% SDS, and 1× protease inhibitor) was added. After vortex mixing, the samples underwent ice bath lysis for 30 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 minutes. The supernatant was collected for protein extraction, and protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay. Subsequently, 20 μg of protein underwent reduction and alkylation (final concentration of 10 mM dithiothreitol [DTT] at 37°C for 1 hour, followed by iodoacetamide [IAA] reaction in the dark for 40 minutes). Proteins were precipitated with five volumes of acetone and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 hour. The resulting pellet was washed twice with acetone, air-dried at room temperature, and subjected to overnight enzymatic digestion with trypsin at 37°C. Peptides were purified using MonoSpin C18 desalting columns through sequential steps: activation with acetonitrile, equilibration with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), sample loading, washing with TFA, and elution with 50% acetonitrile. The eluted peptides were then concentrated by freeze-drying and stored for subsequent mass spectrometry analysis. Prior to mass spectrometry, 1 to 2 μg of each sample was reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid. Peptides were separated via a C18 analytical column (1.9 μm, 75 μm × 20 cm) at a flow rate of 200 μL/min. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) was performed using the Orbitrap Exploris 480 + FAIMS Pro system, with full scan resolution of 60,000 across the m/z range of 350 to 1600. Higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) was applied with a fragmentation collision energy of 30%. Mass spectrometry data were searched against a reference database using Proteome Discoverer 2.4 software.

( A B C Protein Identification and Differential Protein Screening Label-free relative quantification was performed using peptide peak intensity (Precursor Intensity) derived from first-level mass spectrometry as the quantitative parameter. Protein expression abundance (Abundance) was calculated through weighted algorithms based on peak intensity. Standardization of peak intensity for each protein across samples yielded the Abundance Normalized values for quantitative analysis. During pairwise group comparisons, mean signal intensity per group was calculated to determine the fold change ratio. Student’s t p p Serum Exosome Protein Concentration in Each Group The measured serum exosome protein concentrations were 0.379 ± 0.177 μg/μL for the non-erosive group, 0.354 ± 0.095 μg/μL for the erosive group, and 0.533 ± 0.273 μg/μL for the normal group. One-way ANOVA analysis revealed no statistically significant difference among the three groups ( p Unique Peptide Number Distribution and Peptide Sequence Length Distribution Figure 2A Figure 2B Figure 2 Contiune.

Among these, 39 proteins were upregulated, including those involved in signal transduction and receptor activity such as platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB), calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CALCRL), and Ras homolog family member B (RHOB); immune response-associated proteins including human leukocyte antigen-DRB1 (HLA-DRB1), CD46, and complement C3; ECM composition and adhesion molecules such as FN1, LTBP1, and fibulin 1 (FBLN1); as well as proteins involved in metabolism and transport including biotinidase (BTD), dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH), and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Ninety-nine proteins were downregulated, including those related to cytoskeletal structure and adhesion (eg, TLN1, VCL, ITGA2B); signal transduction (eg, RAP1B, type 2 phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphatase [PIP4P2], SRC); immune response (eg, human leukocyte antigen-A [HLA-A], ficolin 1 [FCN1], proteasome 20S subunit beta 7 [PSMB7]); and vesicle/membrane transport (eg, syntaxin 11 [STX11], vesicle-associated membrane protein 5 [VAMP5], CD9/CD63). Comparison between the non-erosive group and the normal group identified 70 differentially expressed proteins, of which 30 were upregulated. These included proteins associated with immune responses (eg, HLA-DRB1, immunoglobulin heavy variable 2–70 [IGHV2-70], IGHV3-43, and CD46), coagulation and hematological regulation (eg, carboxypeptidase B2 [CPB2], coagulation factor XIII B chain [F13B], and serpin family F member 2 [SERPINF2]), ECM composition and adhesion (eg, FN1, thrombospondin 4 [THBS4], and FBLN1), as well as signal transduction and receptor-related proteins (eg, CALCRL, RHOB, and transmembrane 4 L six family member 1 [M4SF1]). Forty proteins were downregulated, including those associated with cytoskeletal organization and adhesion (eg, alpha-actinin 1 [ACTN1], VCL, capping actin protein of muscle Z-line subunit alpha 2 [CAPZA2], and tropomyosin 3 [TPM3]); signal transduction (eg, RAP1B, GNA13, RHOG, and FYN); immunity and inflammation (eg, HLA-A, FCN1, and triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-like [TREML]); and vesicle/membrane transport (eg, STX11, VAMP5, and tetraspanin 33 [TSPAN33]). In the comparison between the erosive group and the normal group, 99 differentially expressed proteins were identified, including 52 upregulated proteins. These included those associated with signal transduction (eg, PDGFB, CALCRL, RHOB), immune response (eg, HLA-DRB1, CD46, C3), coagulation and fibrinolysis (eg, SERPINA10, kallikrein B1 [KLKB1], fibrinogen alpha chain [FGA]), ECM and adhesion (eg, FN1, extracellular matrix protein 1 [ECM1], collagen type VI alpha 1 chain [COL6A1]), and metabolism/transport (eg, BTD, DBH, LDLR). Forty-seven proteins were downregulated, including those involved in adhesion and cytoskeletal organization (eg, calponin-2 [CNN2], ITGA2B, ITGB3, VCL); signal transduction and metabolism (eg, PIP4P2, YWHAB, YWHAQ, PLA2G7); immune regulation (eg, ITGAM, C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 2 [CXCR2], ADP-ribosyltransferase 4 [ART4]); and vesicle/membrane transport (eg, DCTN2, solute carrier family 44 member 1 [SLC44A1], and CD9). Comparison between the non-erosive and erosive groups revealed 20 differentially expressed proteins, including 7 upregulated proteins. These were involved in metabolic regulation (eg, solute carrier family 25 member 6 [SLC25A6], lipoprotein lipase [LPL]), cytoskeletal and adhesion components (eg, TPM3, desmoglein 1 [DSG1]), immune and inflammatory response (eg, interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein [IL1RAP]), and ECM or signaling pathways (eg, THBS4, coiled-coil domain-containing protein 13 [CCDC13]). Thirteen proteins were downregulated, including immune-related proteins (eg, IGHV1-2, pulmonary surfactant-associated protein A1 [SFTPA1], and TREML1) and those involved in adhesion and signal regulation (eg, neural cell adhesion molecule 1 [NCAM1], integrin subunit alpha 4 [ITGA4], and CALCRL/tescalcin [TESC]). Basic Bioinformatics Analysis of Serum Exosome Differential Proteins Between OLP Disease Group and Normal Group GO Enrichment Analysis of Serum Exosome Differential Proteins Between OLP Disease Group and Normal Group GO enrichment analysis was conducted on differential proteins identified between the disease group and the normal group. Within the Biological Process (BP) category, proteins were primarily associated with cell adhesion, regulation of cell adhesion, response to wound, and wound healing. In the Cellular Component (CC) category, enrichment was mainly observed in vesicles, extracellular region, and extracellular space. Molecular Function (MF) analysis indicated enrichment in homoprotein binding, protein complex binding, and signal receptor binding, as presented in Figure 3A Figure 3 Biological information analysis of proteins differing between normal group and OLP disease group based on serum exosome samples.

In the biological process category, proteins were mainly enriched in response to carbohydrate, response to organic substance, and response to oxygen-containing compound. Cellular component terms were primarily concentrated in the extracellular region, extracellular space, and vesicles. Molecular function terms were mostly related to calcium ion binding, protein homodimerization activity, and protein complex binding, as presented in Figure 6A Figure 6 Biological information analysis of proteins differing between non-erosive OLP group and erosive OLP group based on serum exosome samples.

The process begins with the invagination of the cell membrane, leading to the formation of endocytic vesicles. These vesicles subsequently incorporate intracellular proteins, enzymes, and various biomolecules during continuous fusion processes, eventually maturing into multivesicular bodies (MVB). MVBs may either fuse with the cell membrane to release exosomes into the extracellular space or be directed to lysosomes for degradation. 19 In this study, vesicle components were extracted using the qEV reagent kit based on SEC, followed by a triple-characterization strategy comprising TEM for morphology, NTA for particle size, and validation of exosome marker proteins. The isolated vesicle population demonstrated typical exosomal morphological characteristics, with surface marker expression consistent with classical exosome profiles and particle sizes within the expected exosomal distribution range. Quantitative proteomics based on mass spectrometry (MS) represents the current standard for analyzing the overall protein composition of biological samples. Core steps include protein/peptide separation from clinical samples, mass spectrometry detection, and subsequent data processing to elucidate protein structure, abundance, function, and interaction networks. 20 Compared with the normal group, the OLP disease group showed upregulation of proteins involved in signal transduction and receptor activity, such as PDGFB, as well as proteins related to immune response, including HLA-DRB1, CD46, and C3. Among the downregulated proteins, PSMB7 is also related to immune processes. Previous studies have found that PDGFB promotes cellular proliferation, differentiation, and migration during angiogenesis and tissue development and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular, fibrotic, and neoplastic disorders. 21 22 23 24 There were a total of 70 differentially expressed proteins between the non-erosive group and the normal group, among which the upregulated proteins were enriched in proteins related to immune response, including HLA-DRB1, IGHV2-70, IGHV3-43, CD46; downregulated proteins were associated with cytoskeletal and adhesion proteins (such as ACTN1, VCL, CAPZA2, TPM3), immune and inflammatory proteins (like FCN1), and membrane transport and vesicle-related proteins (including STX11). The upregulation of HLA-DRB1 and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IGHV2-70 and IGHV3-43) indicated activation of autoimmune mechanisms. 25 26 27 Upregulated ECM components such as FN1, THBS4, and FBLN1 are known to promote collagen cross-linking, leading to mucosal stiffening and characteristic whitening and hardening observed in non-erosive OLP. 28 29 Differences between the erosive group and the normal group include upregulation of proteins involved in signal transduction regulation and immune response, such as C3, SERPINA10, and KLKB1, which are related to coagulation and fibrinolysis. Downregulated proteins are involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal regulation, signal transduction and metabolic regulation, immune and inflammatory responses, and membrane transport and vesicle formation. Hyperactivation of complement component C3 may result in excessive C3b deposition and formation of C5 convertase, which facilitates membrane attack complex (MAC) formation and leads to direct keratinocyte lysis. 30 31 32 The main upregulated proteins between the non-erosive group and the erosive group were SLC25A6 and LPL, which are involved in metabolic regulation; DSG1, which is related to the cytoskeleton and adhesion; and THBS4, which is involved in the construction of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and signaling. The downregulated proteins were related to immunity, cell adhesion, and signaling. These differential expression patterns indicate that the transition from non-erosive to erosive OLP may reflect a shift toward “reparative inflammation and metabolic adaptation.” The upregulation of THBS4, a pro-fibrotic ECM protein, may accelerate basement membrane stiffening, while DSG1 elevation enhances intercellular adhesion, potentially limiting lateral spread of epithelial lesions. 33 In the serum exosome proteomics analysis of OLP, the disease state demonstrated notable differences compared to the normal group. Upregulated proteins, including signal transduction factors (PDGFB, CALCRL), immune molecules (HLA-DRB1, C3), and ECM components (FN1, FBLN1), were predominantly associated with pro-inflammatory processes, ECM deposition, and metabolic regulation. In contrast, downregulated proteins such as cytoskeletal proteins (VCL, TLN1), signaling molecules (SRC, RAP1B), and immune factors (HLA-A, FCN1, PSMB7) were mainly involved in cell adhesion impairment, inhibition of migration, and attenuation of immune responses. Erosive OLP was characterized by the co-activation of coagulation and complement pathways (upregulation of C3 and FGA) and basement membrane stiffening (upregulation of COL6A1), contributing to mucosal barrier disruption. The non-erosive form primarily exhibited antibody gene alterations (upregulation of IGHV) and neural repair dysregulation (upregulation of THBS4 with downregulation of NCAM1), manifesting clinically as persistent white reticular lesions. These distinctions indicate that erosive OLP is driven by a thromboinflammatory microenvironment that facilitates tissue injury, whereas non-erosive OLP is associated with immune and neuroregulatory disturbances that maintain keratinization abnormalities. Notably, shared molecular targets such as CALCRL, FN1, and VCL may offer therapeutic relevance across OLP phenotypes. GO enrichment analysis of differential serum exosome proteins revealed consistent enrichment across all groups in the extracellular region, extracellular space, and vesicle-related components. These findings support the hypothesis that exosomes function as vehicles for modulating the OLP microenvironment by targeted delivery of proteins such as complement components, ECM-related molecules, and signaling factors. In terms of molecular function, enrichment in protein binding, protein complex binding, and signal receptor binding across all groups suggests that these proteins participate in the formation of functional complexes (eg, immunological synapses and ECM networks), which may enhance pathological signaling cascades. Biological process analysis demonstrated distinct patterns among the groups. In the disease group versus normal group comparison, enrichment was observed in processes related to cell adhesion and wound healing, indicating a disruption in mucosal barrier repair mechanisms driving ECM fibrosis. The non-erosive versus normal group comparison was enriched in immune system regulation and stress response pathways, indicating a persistent immune-inflammatory condition reflective of a chronic disease state. The erosive versus normal group exhibited enrichment in substance transport and localization regulation, potentially linked to impaired vesicle trafficking and delayed tissue regeneration. Lastly, the comparison between non-erosive and erosive groups demonstrated enrichment in response to organic substances and oxidative stress, highlighting differences in the local metabolic microenvironment, such as lipid peroxidation, and variations in nociceptive signaling potentially mediated by calcium signaling imbalances. These findings collectively indicate that the progression of OLP subtypes involves dynamic remodeling of the tissue microenvironment mediated by exosome-transported differential proteins. The transition from non-erosive to erosive forms appears to follow a pathological trajectory marked by “immune suppression → metabolic dysfunction → compensatory reparative inflammation”. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of serum exosome differential proteins across the four groups revealed three commonly enriched pathways: platelet activation, focal adhesion, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. These findings indicate that, irrespective of OLP subtype, coagulation disturbances, disruptions in cell-ECM interactions, and cytoskeletal remodeling are consistently implicated. This indicates that a pathological framework involving complement, coagulation, and cytoskeletal systems may represent the central pathogenic mechanism underlying OLP. Specifically, MAC activity and fibrin microthrombus formation (mediated by FGA and C3) likely contribute to basement membrane injury. Simultaneously, disrupted integrin-ECM signaling (involving FN1 and ITGB3) and actin cytoskeleton disintegration (TPM3 and CAPZA2) together drive the breakdown of the epithelial barrier. Notably, the complement and coagulation cascade pathways were significantly enriched in the disease, non-erosive, and erosive groups, but were absent in the comparison between non-erosive and erosive groups, indicating that the transition toward erosive OLP may coincide with reduced dominance of the coagulation system. Subtype-specific pathway enrichment revealed additional distinctions. In the disease group, “proteoglycans in cancer” and “SNARE vesicular transport” pathways were significantly enriched, potentially reflecting abnormalities in ECM glycosaminoglycan metabolism and exosome secretion mechanisms, respectively. In the non-erosive group, enrichment in “antigen processing and presentation” and “leukocyte transendothelial migration” pathways implied a greater reliance on adaptive immune infiltration. The erosive group was uniquely enriched in the “renin-angiotensin system” and “neutrophil extracellular trap formation” pathways, indicating the contribution of angiotensin II-driven inflammation and NETosis-mediated tissue damage. In the non-erosive versus erosive comparison, novel enrichment of metabolism-related pathways was observed, including PPAR signaling and cholesterol metabolism. Inhibition of PPARγ, a central regulator of lipid metabolism, may result in energy deficiency during tissue repair, while disruptions in cholesterol metabolism may impair membrane integrity. Concurrent enrichment of the “intestinal immune network for IgA production” further implicated oral-gut mucosal immunity in the phenotypic transition. Collectively, these findings indicate the need for stage-specific therapeutic strategies. Targeting RAP1 and integrin signaling may stabilize epithelial adhesion in non-erosive OLP, while suppressing the PI3K-AKT-NETosis axis and regulating PPARγ activity may be more effective during erosive progression. Persistent complement-coagulation axis activation across all subtypes highlights a promising unified therapeutic target. Protein-protein interaction network analysis of differential proteins between the disease and normal groups identified several key regulators of OLP pathophysiology, including FN1, ALB, ACTB, C3, APOA1, ITGB3, TLN1, ITGA2B, VCL, SRC, FLNA, ACTR2, MASP1, PLA2G7, DCTN2, YWHAB, CDC42, YWHAQ, RAP1B, and LTBP1. Here, FN1 emerged as the central hub protein, with the highest betweenness centrality, interacting with integrin receptors (ITGA2B and ITGB3), focal adhesion mediator (VCL), and TGF-β anchor (LTBP1). Upregulation of FN1 promotes the formation of abnormal ECM fiber networks, while downregulation of ITGB3 and VCL disrupts integrin-actin signaling, ultimately contributing to epithelial-mesenchymal detachment, a fundamental mechanism in erosion formation. Furthermore, the complement-coagulation axis demonstrated positive feedback amplification. The lectin pathway initiator MASP1, which was upregulated, activates C3 convertase, facilitating C3 cleavage and MAC assembly. Simultaneously, upregulated phospholipase PLA2G7 hydrolyzes oxidized phospholipids to generate prothrombotic mediators, collectively promoting microvascular occlusion and basement membrane breakdown. Within the cytoskeletal and tissue repair network, disorganization of actin structures (with downregulation of ACTB, FLNA, and ACTR2) and impairment of cellular migration signals were evident. Members of the 14-3-3 protein family (YWHAB and YWHAQ) sequestered phosphorylated SRC and CDC42, thereby inhibiting activation of RAP1B-mediated cell spreading, resulting in defective epithelial regeneration. This interaction map indicates a three-tier pathological cascade in OLP: FN1-integrin mechanical coupling dysfunction leads to epithelial-ECM separation; the MASP1-C3-PLA2G7 axis drives a thromboinflammatory cascade; and inactivation of SRC and CDC42 via 14-3-3 proteins impairs reparative function. The hub proteins FN1 and C3 represent central nodes in this network and may serve as optimal candidates for future targeted interventions. This study proposes that the complement-coagulation-ECM axis forms the pathological framework of OLP: complement overactivation (C3↑) and antigen processing defects (PSMB7↓/FCN1↓) create an autoimmune cycle, which, through HLA-DRB1 overpresentation of self-antigens, drives CD4+ T cell-mediated chronic inflammation and basal cell apoptosis. Simultaneously, subtype-specific tissue remodeling manifests as accelerated collagen cross-linking by the FN1-THBS4 complex in non-erosive types, forming white stripe lesions, while the KLKB1-SERPINA10 axis in erosive types activates thrombin and inhibits fibrinolysis, inducing microthrombosis and degrading the COL6A1 basement membrane structure, ultimately leading to epithelial detachment. At the microenvironmental level, the transition from non-erosive to erosive types reflects metabolic-immune compensatory reprogramming—upregulation of SLC25A6/LPL provides repair energy, downregulation of IGHV weakens autoimmune attacks, but NCAM1 deficiency disrupts neurogenic anti-inflammatory signals, trapping the lesion area in a vicious cycle of “high-energy repair-inflammation resolution impairment.” This framework not only elucidates the dynamic coupling mechanism of immune dysregulation, matrix dissolution, and metabolic adaptation but also proposes an innovative therapeutic strategy targeting the C3/FN1 core nodes in conjunction with the KLKB1-SLC25A6 pathway regulation. Limitations This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. Firstly, the relatively small sample size may reduce the statistical power to detect smaller effect sizes and limit the generalizability of our findings to broader populations. Secondly, although stringent purification protocols were employed (combining size-exclusion chromatography and validation via TSG101/ALIX positivity and Calnexin negativity), potential co-isolation of non-exosomal components inherent to current isolation techniques cannot be entirely ruled out. This may introduce confounding factors in downstream omics analyses; thus, results should be interpreted with this caveat in mind. Thirdly, variability in exosome isolation and characterization methods across laboratories remains a recognized challenge. Despite adherence to MISEV2018 guidelines and strict protocol standardization, inherent technical variability could affect quantitative comparisons between samples. Finally, our bioinformatics analyses, while utilizing established databases and pipelines, are subject to limitations. These include dependence on underlying statistical assumptions (eg, normality, homogeneity of variance), incomplete functional annotations in reference databases, and the impact of selected significance thresholds (eg, p-value/FDR cutoff), which may influence the accuracy of differential expression and pathway enrichment results. Despite these limitations, our findings provide valuable preliminary evidence. Future studies with larger cohorts, refined isolation/characterization techniques, mechanistic studies using in vitro/ex vivo models and experimental validation of bioinformatic predictions are warranted to confirm and extend these observations. Conclusion High-purity serum exosomes were successfully isolated using SEC in combination with NTA, TEM, and WB, providing a reliable methodological basis for subsequent omics-based investigations. Distinctive characteristics of the differential protein profiles were observed. Regarding common features across OLP subtypes, all groups demonstrated significant enrichment of complement and coagulation cascade pathways (including C3 and FGA), dysregulation of cell adhesion (evidenced by FN1 and VCL downregulation), and immune abnormalities (with HLA-DRB1 upregulation and HLA-A downregulation). In terms of subtype-specific features, the erosive subtype was marked by coagulation and fibrinolytic imbalance (with KLKB1 and SERPINA10 upregulation) and basement membrane damage (COL6A1 upregulation), whereas the non-erosive subtype demonstrated pronounced autoantibody activation (IGHV upregulation) and impaired neural repair (NCAM1 downregulation). Key pathogenic mechanisms were further delineated. Disruption of fibronectin-integrin (FN1-ITGB3) signaling contributed to epithelial-extracellular matrix separation, facilitating erosion formation. The MASP1-C3-PLA2G7 axis promoted a thromboinflammatory microenvironment, which, in conjunction with inactivation of SRC and CDC42 mediated by 14-3-3 family proteins (such as YWHAB), impeded tissue repair processes. Collectively, the complement-coagulation cascade and cytoskeletal remodeling were identified as integral components of a unified pathological framework underlying OLP. Identified serum exosome proteins, particularly FN1 and C3, and their associated networks represent highly promising non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers. Critically, these findings provide a strong rationale for developing targeted therapies, including complement inhibitors (eg, anti-C3) and strategies promoting epithelial regeneration. In essence, this work defines the critical exosomal protein landscape of OLP, elucidates novel subtype-specific mechanisms within a unified pathological framework of thromboinflammation and cytoskeletal dysfunction, and directly points the way towards improved diagnosis and mechanism-based therapeutics.
