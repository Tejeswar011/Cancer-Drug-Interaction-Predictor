Specifically, in-depth analyses were implemented to forecast the underlying roles of circRNAs. The objective of this research was to identify the possible intervention targets for subsequent studies. Materials and methods All animal experiments conducted in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Bengbu Medical University (approval No.2023483) and were performed according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. The source of the animals is Hangzhou Ziyuan Experimental animals Technology Co., Ltd (SCXK(ZHE)2024-0004). We have obtained informed consent from Hangzhou Ziyuan Experimental animals Technology Co., Ltd to use the animals in the study. Laser-Induced CNV mouse model C57BL/6J male mice aged six to eight weeks were selected for our study. Mouse models were formulated as previously described [ 15 16 Cell culture and transfection Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were examined as described in prior reports [9]. The cells from the tibias and femurs of the mice, which are common extractions in such studies, were fostered in a differentiation medium comprised of 20% FCS, RPMI (Invitrogen, UK), 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 U/mL penicillin, 50 µM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 20 ng/mL macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; Peprotech, USA). The cells were maintained in this condition for eight days, and then M-CSF was consumed. Additionally, IL-4 (20 ng/mL, PeproTech) was added to trigger M2-type macrophages for 1 day [ 17 The BMDMs were then transfected with the Lipofectamine RNAiMax reagent in light of the producer’s guidance. In short, the cells were transfected using either one circRNA_0000273 Smart Silencer or one circRNA Smarter Silencer negative control (China); following the transfection (> 85%), the cells were fostered for 2 days before testing. Microarray analysis Samples were separated on a nano-UPLC liquid-phase system EASY-nLC1200 and detected by an on-line mass spectrometer (Q Exactive). The analysis was performed on a 100 μm ID × 15 cm reversed-phase column (Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 μm, Dr. Math). The mobile phases were 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile aqueous solution (2% acetonitrile) in liquid A and 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile aqueous solution (80% acetonitrile) in liquid B. The chromatographic column was operated with 100% A and 100% B as the mobile phase. The column was equilibrated with 100% liquid A. The sample was loaded directly onto the column by the autosampler. The sample was injected directly onto the column by an autosampler and separated by the column at a flow rate of 300 nL/min with a gradient of 120 min. Mobile phase B: 8–35% for 92 min, 35–45% for 20 min, 45–100% for 2 min, 100% for 2 min, 100–2% for 2 min, 100–2% for 2 min, 100–2% for 2 min. 100–2% for 2 min, 2% for 2 min. The digests were separated by nano-UPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry on a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). The analysis was performed on for 120 min/sample in positive ion detection mode, with the parent ion scanning range of 350–1400 m/z. The DDA acquisition mode was: 10 fragmentation spectra (MS2 scan, HCD) were acquired after each full scan. 70,000 resolution at m/z 200 for MS1 and 35,000 resolution at m/z 200 for MS2; the MS1 AGC was 1E + and the MS2 AGC was 1E+. The resolution is 35,000 at m/z 200; the MS1 AGC is 1E + 6, the MS2 AGC is 1E + 5, and the maximum ion injection time (Max IT) is 100 ms for MS1 and 120 ms for MS2. The normalized collision energy (NCE) is 28%, the isolation window is 2 m/z, and the dynamic exclusion time is 30 s. The NCE is 28%, the isolation window is 2 m/z, and the dynamic exclusion time is 30 s. The NCE is 28%, and the isolation window is 1 m/z. LC-MS/MS raw data were searched and quantified using MaxQuant (version 1.5.6.0). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were then discerned ( P Bioinformatics analysis To explore the possible biological functions of circRNAs, the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery was applied in the data analysis. After that, the targets underwent functional analysis through the KEGG pathways. Specific binding modes were construed between the miRNAs and circRNAs through the bioinformatics approach. The MREs of the differentially expressed circRNAs were defined on the grounds of the miRana and TargetScan algorithms. A P Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) All RNAs were obtained through TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, U.S.A.). Subsequently, the RNAs were subjected to reverse transcription through the Prime Script RT Master Mix kit and quantitative PCR using the SYBR Green Master Mix on one ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Each specimen was enlarged three times, with data construed through SDS software.

Statistical analyses of the differences between diverse groups were conducted using the software SPSS 19.0 and the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Student’s t P P Results CircRNA expression profiles in the CNV mouse model The circRNA expression profiles in the RPE-choroid-scleral compounds extracted from the CNV mice on day 7 and the control mice were rated by microarray analysis. Using a profiling microarray, we identified 134 circRNAs (74 upregulated and 60 downregulated) that were remarkably differentiated ( P 1 1 1  Fig. 1 Heat map (A, B) of differentially expressed circRNAs between CNV and control samples ( P Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses To investigate the underlying biological function of the circRNA-targeted mRNAs, gene ontology (GO) terms were detected (Fig. 2 2 2 2 2  Fig. 2 GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of differentially expressed circRNAs ( P MiRNA response element analysis of dysregulated circrnas in CNV Research has shown that certain circRNAs could work as miRNA sponges for the expression of mRNAs. Against this background, this study forecast circRNA/miRNA interactions on the grounds of TargetScan and miRana. We examined whether the top six increased and the top six decreased circRNAs were capable of binding to miRNAs. The discoveries manifested that the 12 circRNAs could possibly bind to five disparate miRNAs (Table 2  Table 2 Identification of differentially expressed CircRNAs-Binding MiRNAs Gene Symbol CircRNA ID Fold Change MRE1 MRE2 MRE3 MRE4 MRE5 Up regulated Stxbp5l chr16:37129799-37142446- 5.493 miR-6993-5p miR-107-5p miR-6357 miR-12186-3p miR-204-3p Unc13b chr4:43165744- 43,182,859+ 5.334 miR-7240-5p miR-29a-3p miR-3065-3p miR-7009-5p miR-6998-3 Pcdh15 chr10:74450156–74,454,101+ 3.988 miR-7007-5p miR-5621-5p miR-744-3p miR-425-5p miR-367-5p Runx1 chr16:92644154-92668812- 3.988 miR-128-1-5p miR-8098 miR-7062-5p miR-3473d miR-128-2-5p Pik3r1 chr13:101701447-101709742- 3.822 miR-8113 miR-7687-5p miR-16-1-3p miR-7083-5p miR-1964-5p Mbnl1 chr3:60613263- 60,614,736+ 3.650 miR-666-3p miR-1197-5p miR-214-3p miR-134-5p miR-761 Down regulated Pax3 chr1:78121578- 78,122,756- 4.168 miR-6940-5p miR-7076-5p miR-6998-3p miR-92a-2-5p miR-667-5p Pcbp3 chr10:76781832-76800914- 4.096 miR-7001-5p miR-92a-2-5p miR-18b-5p miR-6931-5p miR-346-3p Klhl15 chrX:94,261,963–94,262,117+ 3.946 miR-7094-1-5p miR-3077-3p miR-99a-5p miR-138-5p miR-5124b Hace1 chr19:37087538-37139221- 3.485 miR-721 miR-7064-5p miR-6389 miR-34a-5p miR-130a-3p Wwc1 chr11:35852194-35861949- 3.309 miR-677-5p miR-432 miR-6407 miR-7016-3p miR-107-5p Bbs9 chr9:22490818- 22,514,093+ 3.261 miR-150-5p miR-6989-5p miR-6991-3p miR-29b-2-5p miR-7071-5p CircRNA_0000273 Mediates the Gene Expression of M2 Macrophages In Vitro and In Vivo Previous studies reported that noncoding RNAs are related to M2 macrophages [ 15 18 3 p 3 p  Fig. 3 Gene expression of circRNA_0000273 (A), Arg-1 (B), Ym-1 (C), iNOS (D) and TNF-α (E). circRNA_0000273, Arg-1 and Ym-1 were significantly increased in IL-4 induced Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM), while TNF-α and iNOS were significantly decreased.

Data are presented as mean + SEM, n p To investigate whether circRNAs could regulate M2 macrophages, a circRNA_0000273 Smart Silencer or negative control was transfected into the M2 macrophages. It was found that inhibiting circRNA_0000273 resulted in a decrease in circRNA_0000273, Arg1, and YM-1 gene expression (Fig. 3 p 3 p To understand whether circRNAs can modulate M2 macrophages in vivo, CNV mice were induced.

CNV area determined by choroidal flatmounts performed at day 7, the CNV area receiving circRNA_0000273 Smart Silencer significantly reduced at 7 day. Data are presented as mean + SEM, n p Discussion As a multi-step and multi-factorial pathological process [ 1 19 Using microarray analysis, it was discovered that 134 circRNAs were remarkably differentially expressed ( P It is known that circular non-coding RNAs consist of a covalently closed continuous ring, lacking a 5’ cap and 3’ tail. Compared with linear RNA, the unique structure of circRNA makes it have a longer half-life and stronger resistance to RNase R. Therefore, recently many circRNAs have been successfully demonstrated as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for many different diseases. CircRNA plays an important biological role in many life activities. Studies have shown that circRNA can bind to host genes at their synthesis sites and regulate the formation of by forming RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loop structures), which can cause transcription pausing or termination. Moreover, circRNA can perform biological functions by acting as ceRNA or miR sponge. In addition, some circRNAs can bind to proteins, thereby affecting the functional effects the target protein. CircRNAs influence biological activities via multiple molecular mechanisms. GO enrichment analysis have revealed that the most remarkably enriched GO terms of the host genes of dysregulated circRNAs were “cellular component organization” (biological reaction), “organelle” (cell component), and “protein binding” (molecular function). These enriched GO terms remind us that circRNAs are associated with cellular component dysregulation in CNV formation. Generally, it has been established that endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction play key roles in the progression of CNV [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 25 26 27 Certain studies have shown that circRNAs are capable of working as miRNA sponges, which means that they significantly affect pathological and physiological processes via the regulation of parental gene expression. Our study explored circRNA/miRNA interactions on the grounds of TargetScan and miRana. Previous investigations showed that miRNA-155 could regulate CNV formation, and here, it was predicted that chr1:15709485–15,714,225 + and chr7:132949585–132,960,734 + could interact with miRNA-155. Accordingly, it was indicated that circRNAs could possibly bind to discrepant miRNAs, thereby demonstrating that circRNAs were able to modulate gene expression as miRNA sponges. Nevertheless, further in-depth experiments are indispensable for validating this assumption. Many researches showed that M2 phenotype macrophages were the main players in CNV formation, while regulating M1/M2 transformation could impact the progress of CNV. However, it is still unknown whether circRNAs can regulate macrophage polarization and CNV. In this research, it was found that circRNA_0000273 expression increased in M2 macrophages and CNV. Further, the experiments revealed that circRNA_0000273 could inhibit M2 macrophage gene expression in vitro and in vivo. For the purpose of examining the function of circRNAs, our research employed the intravitreal injection method, and consequently, it was found that circRNA_0000273 could inhibit CNV. However, in this study, we only observed the expression of macrophage polarization indicators at the gene level. In the future, we will use more methods, such as flow cytometry to observe the polarization and regulation of macrophages in CNV formation. In conclusion, we examined aberrantly expressed circRNAs in a CNV mouse model and found that circRNA_0000273 was a potentially novel target for CNV prevention and treatment. More research is needed to further explore the relationship between circRNA expression and CNV formation, as well as the mechanisms and functions of modified circRNAs in CNV pathology.
