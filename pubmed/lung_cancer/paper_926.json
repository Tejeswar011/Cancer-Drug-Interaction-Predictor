However, the mechanisms of their role in CRSwNP remain unclear. This study aimed to identify CRSwNP biomarkers related to macrophage polarization and metabolism, and elucidate their molecular regulatory mechanisms. Methods In this study, transcriptomic data of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) were obtained from public databases. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened via differential expression analysis. Subsequently, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify key module genes related to macrophage polarization-related genes (MP-RGs), which were then cross-referenced with metabolism-related genes to screen for candidate genes. After that, two machine learning methods—least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and random forest (RF)—were applied to further screen these candidate genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for the training set and validation set were constructed, and gene expression validation was conducted to finally determine the biomarkers. Finally, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to verify the expression levels of prognostic genes. Results ALOX5, HMOX1, and PLA2G7 were identified as biomarkers for CRSwNP, with AUC >0.7 in both training and validation sets, showing strong diagnostic potential. A nomogram, built on these three biomarkers, exhibited superior diagnostic performance. Enrichment analysis suggested that these biomarkers might be implicated in immune pathways. Furthermore, all three biomarkers were found to be correlated with asthma. Selenium was identified as a co-target of ALOX5 and HMOX1, presenting potential therapeutic targets for CRSwNP. A total of 10 key miRNAs regulating these biomarkers were identified, and the upstream long non-coding RNAs of hsa-miR-642a-5p, including FOXC1 and NEAT1, were predicted. Additionally, the transcription factor FOXC1 was found to concurrently regulate all three biomarkers. RT-qPCR results validated that the expression levels of ALOX5, HMOX1, and PLA2G7 were significantly elevated in CRSwNP patients, corroborating the findings from bioinformatics analyses. Conclusion ALOX5, HMOX1, and PLA2G7 were identified as biomarkers linked to macrophage polarization and metabolism in CRSwNP. These findings offer new insights for early prevention strategies and clinical drug development in CRSwNP. chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps macrophage polarisation metabolism machine learning biomarkers The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Network Bioinformatics 1 Introduction Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous condition characterized by inflammation of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, which is associated with a complex etiology and a high propensity for recurrence. Its prevalence is estimated at 10.9% among adults in European countries, 14% in the United States, and 8% in China ( Chen M. et al., 2023 Zhu et al., 2022 Chen G. et al., 2023 Macrophages are highly adaptable cells capable of sensing and responding to changes in their surrounding microenvironment. Upon activation, these cells are generally classified into two main types: classically activated (M1) macrophages and alternatively activated (M2) macrophages, based on their distinct functions. Both macrophages and monocytes, which fall under the category of phagocytic cells, play a pivotal role in both non-specific and specific immunity in vertebrates. M1 macrophages are activated by interferon-γ, lipopolysaccharide, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. They mediate Th1 immunity, produce pro-inflammatory mediators, and sustain inflammatory responses. Conversely, M2 macrophages are activated by IL-4, IL-13, IL-10, macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or transforming growth factor β. These macrophages elicit anti-inflammatory responses, promote tissue remodeling, and mediate Th2 immunity ( Liu C. et al., 2022 Zhu et al., 2022 Shaghayegh et al., 2022 Metabolism is intricately linked to the maintenance of normal vital functions. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) encompasses a group of conditions that involve various metabolic abnormalities, including obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, among others. Research has indicated that MetS increases the risk of postoperative recurrence in patients with CRSwNP, with this risk rising proportionally to the number of MetS components. Additionally, studies have identified alterations in a range of metabolites, such as amino acids, fatty acids, and sugars, within the nasal mucosa of CRSwNP patients. These aberrant metabolic changes are implicated in the pathogenesis of CRSwNP, suggesting a potential connection between MetS, metabolite dysregulation, and the recurrence of this chronic condition ( Chen Y. et al., 2024 Qin et al., 2022 Wang T. et al., 2023 He et al., 2020 The preliminary research has revealed that few studies have explored the correlation between macrophage inflammatory response and metabolic pathways in CRSwNP. Therefore, this paper seeks to elucidate the prediction of macrophage alterations and to identify biomarkers related to metabolism in CRSwNP patients, as well as their molecular biological significance. By utilizing transcriptome data, the objective is to identify macrophage polarization-related genes (MP-RGs) and metabolism-related genes (MRGs), thereby providing new insights for the treatment of CRSwNP. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data source Datasets GSE136825 GSE194282 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds GSE136825 GPL20301 GSE194282 GPL17692 Zhou et al., 2023 Zhao et al., 2021 Possemato et al., 2011 2.2 Detection and identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) The DESeq2 package (v 1.38.0) ( Love et al., 2014 2 Gustavsson et al., 2022 Gu and Hübschmann, 2022 2 2.3 Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified key modular genes associated with MP-RGs The scores of MP-RGs in the training set were determined using the single-sample gene set enrichment analysis algorithm from the GSVA package (v 1.46.0) ( Hänzelmann et al., 2013 P Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 R 2 p 2.4 Elucidation and functional characterization of candidate genes Using the ggvenn package (v 0.1.9) ( Zheng et al., 2022 Following the identification of the candidate genes, clusterProfiler software (v 4.7.1.003) ( Yu et al., 2012 http://string-db.org Liu et al., 2020 2.5 Identification of signature genes through machine learning approaches To identify genes closely associated with CRSwNP, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method penalized regression model was constructed using the glmnet package (v 4.1.4) ( Li et al., 2022 Alderden et al., 2018 2.6 Identification of biomarkers and construction of a nomogram To evaluate the ability of the signature genes to distinguish between CRSwNP and normal samples, the pROC package (v 1.74.0) ( Robin et al., 2011 Sachs, 2017 2.7 Enrichment analysis of gene sets [gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approach] To determine the biological pathways and functions of biomarkers in the training set, the psych package (v 2.2.9) ( Author anonymous, 2023 Qing et al., 2022 P 2.8 Construction of molecular regulatory networks To explore the molecular regulatory mechanisms associated with the biomarkers, the miRDB ( https://www.mirdb.org http://mirwalk.umm.uni-heidelberg.de/ http://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/index.php http://www.jaspar.genereg.net 2.9 Disease association and drug prediction analyses To obtain biomarker-disease associations, biomarkers were imported into the Disease Gene Network database ( http://www.disgenet.org/ 2.10 Validation of gene expression by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) The expression of these biomarkers was confirmed using RT-qPCR. Five pairs of CRSwNP and control tissue samples were obtained from the Affiliated Hospital of Yunnan University. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the hospital’s ethics committee (approval number: 2024229).

The quality and concentration of extracted RNA were verified using a NanoPhotometer N50, with OD260/280 ratios ranging from 1.8 to 2.0, indicating high RNA purity. Next, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using the SweScript First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol: the reaction mixture (20 μL total volume) included 4 μL of 5× reaction buffer, 1 μL of reverse transcriptase, 1 μL of oligo (dT) primer, 1 μg of RNA template, and nuclease-free water to volume. RT-qPCR was performed using the 2 × Universal Blue SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Yeasen, China) on a CFX96 real - time PCR detection system (BIO - RAD, United States). The 10 μL reaction system contained 5 μL of 2xUniversal Blue SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix, 1 μL of forward primer (10 μM), 1 μL of reverse primer (10 μM), 3 μL of cDNA template. The thermal cycling conditions were: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 20 s, annealing at 55 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. After the reaction was completed, specificity was verified via melting curve analysis.

In the 28 enriched GO-CC entries, candidate genes were associated with structures such as the “ion channel complex”, “transmembrane transporter complex”, and “phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex”, among others. Within the 132 GO-MF categories, associations were found between the candidate genes and functions such as “metal ion transmembrane transporter activity”, “channel activity”, and “lipase activity”, among others ( Figure 3A Figure 3B Figure 3C Figure 3C FIGURE 3  (A) (B) (C) Three-panel graphic depicting biological data analysis.

The results demonstrated that ALOX5, HMOX1, and PLA2G7 exhibited AUC values of 0.818, 0.902, and 0.853, respectively. These values exceeded 0.7, indicating that these three genes possessed a strong capacity to differentiate between CRSwNP and normal samples. This is depicted in Figure 5A Figure 5B P Figures 5C,D FIGURE 5  (A) (B) (C) (D) (A) Six ROC curves for PLA2G2A, ALOX5, HMOX1, PLA2G7, and GNMT, showcasing training data with varying AUC values.

The mean absolute error is 0.019 with n equals 103 samples. 3.5 GSEA uncovers biomarker function and signaling pathways GSEA analysis revealed that the biomarkers ALOX5, HMOX1, and PLA2G7 were significantly associated with 1,859, 2,228, and 2,025 pathways, respectively, in the training set. The top 10 pathways for each biomarker are presented in Figures 7A–C Supplementary Tables S1-S3 FIGURE 7  (A) (B) (C) Three-panel graph showing enrichment plots for different biological terms across datasets.

Panels differ in terms and patterns displayed. 3.6 Biomarkers are involved in complex molecular regulation Two databases were queried to predict key miRNAs potentially targeting the biomarkers, resulting in the identification of 10 key miRNAs corresponding to the three biomarkers. The miRNA-mRNA regulatory network revealed that no miRNAs targeted all biomarkers simultaneously ( Supplementary Figure S1A Supplementary Figure S1B Figure 8A Figure 8B FIGURE 8  (A) (B) (C) (D) (A) Network diagram showing microRNAs (purple) and genes (red) relationships with long non-coding RNAs (green).

Error bars represent standard deviation. 4 Discussion Research has demonstrated that in chronic sinusitis, an increase in M2 macrophage polarization contributes to the development of nasal polyps ( Bao et al., 2023 Chen Y. et al., 2024 He et al., 2021 In this study, candidate genes were selected by integrating MP-RGs, MRGs and CRSwNP DEGs, and three biomarkers (ALOX5, HMOX1, PLA2G7) were finally determined by machine learning, ROC analysis and expression level verification. Furthermore, PCR analysis confirmed their elevated expression levels in CRSwNP. Prior research has established a four-gene diagnostic model for CRSwNP, which includes HMOX1 and ALOX5 ( Wang et al., 2024 Arachidonic acid lipoxygenase (ALOX) plays a critical role in catalyzing the conversion of polyunsaturated fatty acids to lipid hydroperoxides, a process that may lead to cell membrane damage and ferroptosis ( Liu et al., 2023 Hu et al., 2023 Chen T. et al., 2024 Heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) is an inducible enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of cellular heme, resulting in the production of biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free ferrous iron, a measurable indicator of oxidative stress ( Schipper et al., 2009 Zheng et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2024 Wang et al., 2025 Wu et al., 2022 PLA2G7, also known as platelet-activating acetylhydrolase, belongs to the phospholipase A2 family and encodes the protein lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2). This enzyme plays a pivotal role in catalyzing the hydrolysis of phospholipids, resulting in the release of free fatty acids and lysophospholipids ( Huang et al., 2020 Casas et al., 2010 Canning et al., 2016 Li et al., 2021 Zhang et al., 2024 ALOX5, HMOX1, and PLA2G7 are genes that have been implicated in asthma. Research findings indicate that approximately 25% of patients with CRS also suffer from asthma, in contrast to only 5% of the general population. Notably, the association between asthma and CRS becomes more pronounced in patients with CRSwNP, where the prevalence of asthma increases to 30%–70%. This subgroup of CRS patients also experiences a more severe and progressive form of asthma ( Galletti et al., 2023 Abdo et al., 2022 Liu J. et al., 2022 Mougey et al., 2013 GSEA analysis revealed that the three biomarkers were enriched in pathways associated with immune cell interactions, particularly in “immunomodulatory interactions between lymphocytes and non-lymphocytes” and “natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity”, among others. Previous studies have shown that the proportion of CD8 + + Smith et al., 2017 FOXC1 has been found to simultaneously regulate the three biomarkers. As a TF within the FOX family, FOXC1 is defined by a conserved “forkhead” or “wing helix” DNA-binding domain and is involved in various cellular processes, including growth, metabolism, and survival. Prior research has indicated that FOXC1 acts as a hypoxia-activated TF, thereby facilitating cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, several studies have reported that FOXC1 expression can be induced under conditions of myocardial ischemia ( Chen et al., 2021 Li et al., 2024 The predictive analysis of drugs in this study showed that SELENIUM was predicted by both HMOX1 and ALOX5. As an essential trace element for the human body, selenium is the core cofactor of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), which can scavenge intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxides, and reduce the damage caused by oxidative stress to tissues ( Maia et al., 2024 Huang et al., 2012 Wang S. et al., 2023 Carlson et al., 2010 Zhao et al., 2024 Yang et al., 2022 Toppila-Salmi et al., 2025 Jiang et al., 2021 Kim and Yeo, 2013 5 Conclusion In conclusion, this study investigated the correlation between CRSwNP and macrophage polarization and metabolism. Additionally, the expression of three biomarkers was validated, thereby establishing a foundational basis for subsequent experimental work. Nonetheless, there are still some shortcomings in this study. First, the small sample size in RT-qPCR validation may limit the generalizability of the results, and subsequent studies will expand the sample size to verify biomarker expression. Secondly, this study has not yet deeply elucidated the association between biomarkers and nasal mucosal macrophages, and more nasal mucosa-specific immunohistochemistry or functional experimental validation is still needed, and subsequent studies will focus on this direction.
