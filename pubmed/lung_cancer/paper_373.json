Somalia lacks national data on household smoke exposure risk (SER), a measure based on fuel type and cooking location. Methods We analyzed data from 15,823 households in the 2020 Somalia Health and Demographic Survey. SER was categorized as very low, low, medium, or high. Descriptive analysis and ordinal logistic regression identified associated factors, adjusting for sampling weights. Results High SER affected 60.3% of households; 36.3% had medium SER. Only 3.2% and 0.2% were in the low and very-low categories. Larger households had greater SER odds (AOR = 1.19). Surprisingly, middle- and high-income households had higher SER than the poorest. Media exposure reduced SER (AOR = 0.88), and nomadic households had significantly lower risk (AOR = 0.19) than urban ones. Regional differences remained significant. Conclusion Most Somali households face high SER, shaped by household size, wealth, media access, and geography. Clean cooking programs should focus on high-density homes, promote awareness through media, and tailor approaches to local contexts. Expanding access to clean fuels and improving ventilation can reduce household air pollution in Somalia.

These regions vary significantly in terms of access to infrastructure, socioeconomic development, and household energy practices, providing a comprehensive national context for understanding household SER. The data used in this study covered only 16 regions of Somalia. It is important to note that the Lower Shabelle and Middle Juba regions are missing from SDHS data. Data source and study sample This study relied on secondary, fully de-identified data from the 2020 Somali Demographic and Health Survey (SDHS), which was conducted by the Somali National Bureau of Statistics in collaboration with international partners and aligned with recognized ethical guidelines. All data were accessed via the DHS Program repository under approved use, with ethical approval for this secondary analysis waived by the institutional review board because of the anonymized nature of the dataset and absence of personally identifiable information. The SDHS used a stratified multistage cluster sampling technique to ensure the inclusion of households from diverse regions, residence types (urban, rural, and nomadic), and socioeconomic backgrounds. The survey collected nationally representative data on health, nutrition, demographic characteristics, and household conditions of the participants. For this analysis, the household recode (HR) file was used, which contains responses related to household composition, cooking fuel type, and location. Households with complete data on these variables were included, resulting in a final sample of 15,823. All analyses maintained strict confidentiality and complied with the established ethical and data protection standards. The final sample provided a rich representation of Somali households across diverse geographical and sociocultural settings. Study variables The primary outcome variable in this study was the SER, which was derived by integrating data on the cooking fuel type and cooking location. The cooking fuels were classified into clean and dirty categories. Clean fuels included electricity, gas, and other modern energy sources, whereas unclean fuels included biomass-based options such as wood, charcoal, and dung. Cooking locations were categorized as outdoor or indoor. Based on the combination of fuel type and cooking setting, the households were classified into four SER levels: Very Low SER was assigned to households using clean fuel and cooking outdoors; Low SER referred to those using clean fuel but cooking indoors; Medium SER described households using unclean fuel and cooking outdoors; and High SER indicated households using unclean fuel and cooking indoors. This classification method follows previous studies using Demographic and Health Survey data and provides a composite measure that captures both pollution source and exposure intensity [ 17 18 Independent variables were selected to capture a range of household demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic characteristics that were hypothesized to influence the SER. These included the sex and age of the household head, household size, school attendance of the household head, household wealth index, media exposure status, type of residence, and region of residence. Household size was categorized based on the number of members, and education was defined based on the school attendance status. Wealth was measured using the DHS composite wealth index and divided into poor, middle, and rich categories. Media exposure reflected whether any household member was exposed to newspapers, radio, or television. Residence types included urban, rural, and nomadic, and the regional classification followed the administrative boundaries defined in the SHDS. Data analysis Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the distribution of sociodemographic variables and estimate the prevalence of each SER category in the national sample. The analysis also explored regional variations in SER using frequency tables and graphical visualizations. An ordinal logistic regression model was used to investigate the predictors of the SER. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals were computed to identify the strength and direction of the associations between the independent variables and SER level. Prior to regression modeling, multicollinearity was assessed using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), with all variables falling below the threshold of concern, indicating no serious collinearity issues. Statistical significance was set at a threshold of 5%. All analyses were conducted using STATA version 16, incorporating sampling weights to account for the complex survey design and ensure nationally representative estimates. Results This section delineates the findings derived from the analysis of 15,823 Somali households, encompassing the sociodemographic structure of the sample, the prevalence and distribution of SER, and the identification of factors significantly associated with SER through multivariate analysis. Sample characteristics The analysis encompassed 15,823 Somali households, whose sociodemographic characteristics are presented in Table 1 1  Table 1 Sociodemographic characteristics of households (Unweighted N Characteristics Category Frequency Percentage (%) Sex of household head Male 10,573 66.82 Female 5,250 33.18 Age of household head < 30 2,762 17.46 30–40 5,424 34.28 41–54 3,548 22.42 > 54 4,089 25.84 Number of household members <=4 5,207 32.91 > 4 10,616 67.09 School attendance of household head Yes 5,506 34.80 No 10,317 65.20 Wealth index Poor 8,830 55.80 Middle 2,745 17.35 Rich 4,248 26.85 Media exposure Exposed 3,847 24.31 Not Exposed 11,976 75.69 Type of residence Urban 6,426 40.61 Rural 4,482 28.33 Nomadic 4,915 31.06  Fig. 1 Percentage of SER by region in Somalia Prevalence and distribution of Smoke Exposure Risk (SER) The findings indicate a substantial burden of smoke exposure risk, with the majority of households classified as having a High SER (60.34%). Medium SER was also prevalent, characterizing (36.32%) of households (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Prevalence of SER in Somalia Further examination revealed significant regional heterogeneity in the proportional distribution of SER levels (Fig. 3 Several regions, including Sanaag, Bari, Mudug, and Lower Juba, displayed a more balanced distribution between Medium and High SER prevalence. Although generally a minor category, Low SER (orange bars) reached notable proportions in Nugaal (8.8%) and Bari (8.1%). Consistent with the overall prevalence, the Very Low SER (red bars) constituted a negligible percentage (typically < 1%) in nearly all regions. This visualization clearly demonstrates substantial geographical disparities in the relative burden of different SER levels across Somalia, motivating the subsequent multivariate analysis to explore the underlying determinants.

The prevalence of high SER in Somali households was 60.34%, and an additional 36.32% experienced medium SER. This high prevalence highlights a significant public health challenge associated with indoor air pollution. Compared to other regional studies using similar SER categorizations based on fuel type and cooking location, Somalia’s high SER prevalence is lower than the 76.4% reported in Tanzania [ 10 12 8 P 9 8 19 A positive association was observed between wealth and the SER in Somalia.

First, the cross-sectional nature of the SDHS data prevents the establishment of causal relationships; the analysis identifies associations, but causality cannot be inferred. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the dynamics of fuel transition and SER changes over time. Second, the SER measure relies on self-reported primary cooking fuel and location, which may be subject to recall or social desirability bias. It does not capture the nuances of fuel stacking (using multiple fuels), cooking duration, stove efficiency, specific biomass characteristics, or actual ventilation levels, all of which significantly affect actual exposure. Third, while the model was adjusted for several key covariates, unmeasured confounding factors, such as local fuel prices, supply chain reliability, security conditions affecting fuel gathering or market access, and specific cultural beliefs about cooking, could have influenced the observed associations. Finally, the findings are specific to the Somali population in 2020 and, while providing crucial national insights, may not be directly generalizable to other countries or time periods without caution, given Somalia’s unique and evolving contexts. Conclusion This study reveals a critical public health concern in Somalia, where most households face a high risk of smoke exposure due to reliance on polluting fuels and indoor cooking practices. The findings demonstrate that 60.34% of households fall under the high SER category, with notable regional disparities and strong associations with household size, wealth, media exposure, and type of residence. Counterintuitively, wealthier households were more likely to experience higher SER, potentially due to enclosed housing structures and the indoor use of polluting fuels. Nomadic households exhibited significantly lower SER, likely because of outdoor cooking practices and better ventilation. These findings highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions that extend beyond economic assumptions. Efforts to reduce SER in Somalia should focus on promoting access to affordable, clean fuels, enhancing public awareness through mass media campaigns, and incorporating culturally appropriate, region-specific strategies. Future policies must also consider the structural and environmental conditions that influence indoor air quality. Efforts should prioritize targeted subsidies for LPG to enhance the affordability and accessibility of clean fuels across urban and rural settings. NGOs can play a vital role in facilitating public awareness campaigns, community engagement, and supporting the distribution of clean cooking technologies. Effectively reducing household SER requires coordinated, cross-sector collaboration among health, energy, and environmental sectors to ensure sustainable, culturally appropriate interventions. Addressing SER is essential not only for improving respiratory and overall health outcomes but also for advancing broader sustainable development and equity goals in the country.
