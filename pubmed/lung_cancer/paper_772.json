Circumstances varied greatly by region and hospital, depending on COVID-19 prevalence, case mix, hospital type, and available resources. These challenges have disrupted screening programs and have been particularly distressing for both women with a breast cancer diagnosis and their providers. Summary This review explores the retrospective impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary breast cancer care. It analyzes changes in screening participation, diagnosis rates, treatment modalities, and the delivery of psycho-oncological support during the pandemic. The study found a significant reduction in breast cancer screenings and a subsequent stage shift in diagnoses, with fewer early-stage and more advanced-stage cancers being detected. Additionally, the review discusses the psychosocial challenges faced by patients and the adaptations made in care delivery, such as the increased use of telemedicine. Despite these challenges, the healthcare systems showed resilience, with core treatment services largely maintained and rapid adaptations to new care models. Key Messages There was a marked decrease in breast cancer screenings and early diagnoses during the pandemic, with a shift toward more advanced-stage detections. While there was an increased use of neoadjuvant therapies and telemedicine, essential breast cancer treatments were mostly sustained, reflecting the resilience of healthcare systems. The pandemic significantly impacted the mental health of breast cancer patients, exacerbating anxiety and depression and highlighting the need for improved psycho-oncological support. The full impact of these disruptions on long-term breast cancer outcomes remains uncertain, necessitating ongoing monitoring and adaptation of care strategies to mitigate adverse effects.

A shutdown of healthcare services was necessary for COVID-19 management globally. Concerns about this impact as well as the redesign of clinical services, redistribution of resources, and changes in treatment priorities are still discussed. Breast cancer practice is based on different stages of care: screening programs, diagnostic assessments, surgery, adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatments, and radiotherapy [ 1 2 3 6 Following global recommendations, breast cancer screening, diagnosis, inpatient care, treatment, aftercare, and follow-up continued at limited capacity but were prioritized according to medical necessity. All treatment changes are particularly critical for cancer patients due to their increased susceptibility to infection and disease progression. A multitude of medical treatments result in immunosuppression, which consecutively elevates the risk of contracting COVID-19 and subsequently experiencing higher morbidity or mortality [ 3 7 8 Methods Search Strategy The literature search was conducted in the PubMed databases using a predefined search algorithm. Different search algorithms were utilized for meta-analyses, randomized control trials, systematic reviews, reviews, observational studies, cohort or cross-sectional studies and studies by certified centers. We combined a search strategy of free-text terms and MeSH headings for the topic “breast cancer and COVID-19” combined with screening, diagnosis impact, guidelines, treatment, surgery, stage shift, aftercare, psycho-oncology, and survivorship. The search strategy included MeSH terms in combination with the basic search of “sars cov 2” OR “covid 19” AND “breast neoplasms,” followed by one of the specific topics: AND “psycho oncology”; AND “diagnosis” OR “mass screening” OR “early detection of cancer”; AND “aftercare”; AND “guidelines as topic”; AND “time”; AND “clinical trials as topic”; AND “neoplasm staging”; AND “therapeutics” OR “therapy”; AND “survivorship.” Additional relevant topics were identified through cross-referencing the citation lists of retrieved articles. The searches were performed up to June 9, 2023, exploring evidence published from January 1, 2020, onward ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1. The flowchart illustrating the systematic review of the literature on breast cancer during pandemic times in PubMed. *Selection criteria included evidence-based studies encompassing randomized controlled trials (RCT), certified center studies, meta-analyses, observational studies, cohort or cross-sectional studies, reviews, or systematic reviews. Eligibility Criteria From the 1926 primary hits, relevant studies were selected based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, initially at the title and abstract level, followed by the full-text level ( Fig. 1 https://doi.org/10.1159/000541015 Results Outpatient Care Sector Screening in First Care Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many patients were not able to participate in early detection programs. Reduced office hours in outpatient medical practices, practice closures during the period of lockdown and contact restrictions changed the management of screening examinations and regular early detection programs. Particularly, elderly women (76.1% of pre-COVID-19), especially minorities, faced greater declines, and limited recovery in breast cancer, exacerbated by higher COVID-19 mortality and severe infection rates [ 9 10 10 12 This could have an impact on further treatment and diagnosis. Several studies have been published with heterogenous observations on the effect of the pandemic on breast cancer screening, its impact and need to be discussed. Mast et al. analyzed the pooled data from 60 US healthcare organizations for participation in cancer screening programs. During the pandemic peak between March 15 and June 16, 2020, 285,000 breast exams were missed, which represents a deficit of >63% relative to the number of screenings that would be expected based on the historical average. Focusing on the acute lockdown period, the high impact and decrease on mammography screening programs generally as well as in particular the German mammography screening program, could be determined [ 11 13 14 Figure 2 Fig. 2. Overview and types of included studies. On average, 30% of female patients consistently and dependably engage in early detection programs in Germany [ 15 Fig. 3 16 Figure 2 Figure 2 Fig. 3 Figure 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 3. Changes in breast cancer screening participation (2019–2022) based on billed mammography screening services by the statutory health insurances. a b c d 16 Also, a major German health insurance company demonstrated in its cohort of adult-insured patients a 6.5% decrease in screening services overall and in particular a 9% decrease in billed mammographies of the years 2019 and 2020 [ 17 18 8 19 10 16 17 Data for breast cancer incidences in Germany from 2021 or more recently remain scarce. We conducted an analysis utilizing official cancer registries from three German states, focusing on breast cancer incidence rates for 2019 and 2021 (as depicted in Fig. 4 20 22 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4. Breast cancer incidence changes (2019–2021) in three German states. a b Genetic Screening Programs in High-Risk Patients Especially BRCA1/2 mutation carriers benefit from early detection programs. The intensified early detection with additional mammary magnetic resonance imaging helps detect stage 1 tumors with reduced chemotherapy treatment. However, medical laboratories have been switched to SARS-CoV-2 virus diagnostics as part of the COVID pandemic. Expert personnel from the predictive field were frequently reassigned to support virus diagnostics. This resulted in a reduction of BRCA testing and delayed predictive gene mutation analysis for at least March–April 2020, which did not increase significantly after the lockdown phase and stayed apparent in 2020 [ 23 24 23 24 10 14 Diagnosis and Stage Shift Consequently, there was a significant decrease in early breast cancer diagnoses [ 25 26 In terms of delayed diagnostics, a 2-month delay in secondary care could lead to a loss of lifetime: Sud et al. [ 27 27 A slight stage shift was visible in European collectives. An Italian single-center study documented a significantly lower proportion of in situ breast cancer diagnosis (stage 0–1/I–II, or Tis and T1; −10.4%) and an increase in node-positive (+11.2%) and stage III breast cancer (+10.3%) during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period [ 28 29 1 Psycho-Oncological Care The pandemic also led to a sense of isolation and decreased social support, as well as increased psychological distress in oncological patients ( Table 1 5 30 31 34 35 31 36 36 37 38 Table 1. Modulators for increased fear in breast cancer patients [ 29 32 36 Cancer-associated anxiety Pandemic-related stressors Multipliers of anxiety and depression  Relapse Treatment consequences Financial + occupational + social insecurities  Illness or illness of family members Fear of reduced treatment quality Changes in treatment plan Delay in diagnosis/therapy Worsening prognosis or progression  Lack of supportive networks, family support groups Reduced psycho-oncological support Reduced communication with medical and nursing staff + lack of communication about the impact of COVID pandemic Inpatient Care Sector General considerations how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the inpatient care sector of breast cancer patients is primarily the compensatory effort of all departments of the hospital to support the care for a rising number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Virus. Primarily the intensive- and intermediate-care capacities of hospitals were shifted toward caring for the severe cases of COVID-19. Additionally, medical personnel were infected with the disease and were therefore sometimes missing an extended period of time. Furthermore, wards caring for breast cancer patients had to support intensive- and intermediate-care wards by lending personnel [ 3 4 39 40 Amount of Breast Cancer Surgeries The management of early breast cancer is built around the surgical care for the malignancy. To assess, the decline in breast cancer surgeries, the study group around Cairns, has compared the number of surgical procedures performed in 2019 and 2020 and found no decline in the overall volume of operations since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though they have seen a short-term decline in screening and diagnostic mammograms during the same time period, there was no significant difference in breast cancer stage at the time of operation [ 41 5 A German survey conducted in 18 comprehensive cancer centers with a total of 621 patients analyzed, investigated whether the pandemic had any effect on those patients’ cancer care. In this study, which included 76% female patients with the predominant malignancy being breast cancer (50% of total patients), 12.9% of patients reported that there was any change in cancer care. Regarding the surgical and systemic treatments 1.6% and 2.3%, respectively, reported any change in their therapeutic modalities which in most of the cases meant a postponement [ 42 43 17 44 45 45 46 49 50 50 51 Impact on Breast Reconstruction Surgeries Most published articles state that there definitely was an influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on the mode and timing of breast reconstruction. According to Fancellu et al. [ 47 52 52 53 54 54 Shift in Treatment Modalities? The pandemic forces clinicians to modify guidelines which recommend treatment changes to balance the risk of a COVID-19 infection with disease progression. Comparing these data internationally, a large population-based retrospective study in the USA has seen a marked shift toward the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (12% vs. 38%) as well as neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (5% vs. 27%) during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Those changes did not persist and returned to the pre-pandemic distribution of treatment modalities [ 2 55 25 39 Impact on Activity of Clinical Trials Also, the clinical trial activity was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Early during the pandemic, the initiation of new clinical trials on cancer and patient enrollment was severely disrupted by −46 to −57% in the USA. This decline likely reflects a diversion of resources toward immediate patient care during the pandemic. For non-US-based studies, the drop was less dramatic with an overall reduction of 27%. Nevertheless, the initial decline recovered progressively and eventually reached pre-pandemic levels [ 4 56 58 59 Discussion The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges for breast cancer care and patients, with several key areas of impact emerging from the literature. These include screening, diagnosis, therapy, inpatient care, aftercare, and the psychological well-being of patients. The pandemic has disrupted routine breast cancer screenings, resulting in potential delays in early detection (majority of studies at least 49%) and subsequent treatment initiation (18–29%) [ 1 26 45 Nevertheless, in Germany, most breast cancer patients received treatment within an appropriate time frame, but the effects of reduced follow-up are yet to be estimated. Many effects will only be answered in a larger time frame with the help of cancer registries. The screening programs experienced the largest drop during the lockdown, with a decrease of −67% in Europe and −35% in North America. After the lockdown, breast cancer screening started to recover slightly, with a rebound effect becoming noticeable at the end of 2020 and during 2021 [ 8 16 It is important to emphasize that elderly individuals over 50 years, those with a migration background or those with low socioeconomic status are especially affected by lack of early detection measures. These results suggest that recall systems need to focus on these groups in the future. Recalls for early detection measures need to be intensified and transitional extension of age limits need to be discussed. Polities should focus on identifying any underlying cultural barriers to ensure a return to routine care. Surprisingly, the effects of delayed BRCA testing during the COVID-19 pandemic have been poorly reported with few existing studies [ 23 24 Most published studies have not reported a significant decrease in surgical procedures and inpatient breast cancer care was able to be maintained during the pandemic. Modified surgical pathways did not significantly affect the morbidity and mortality rates compared to the pre-pandemic period. Although some studies have noted an increased use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, no treatment delays were evident [ 43 60 Furthermore, the disruption of clinical trials was short-lived, and it is unlikely to significantly slow down the pace of clinical research and development of new drugs [ 4 56 57 45 Different modeling studies exist and should be considered carefully [ 27 61 65 1 German cancer registries are providing the first nationwide insights, which are indicating that the impact on breast cancer incidence and mortality could be lower than expected, resulting in a small long-term effect [ 5 16 17 44 4 31 33 36 38 Isolation, fear of contracting the virus, treatment uncertainties, and reduced social support led to heightened stress levels and mental health concerns among this vulnerable population [ 66 66 67 68 32 69 70 The COVID-19 pandemic posed significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide, but it also led to several positive developments in breast cancer care. A study by McKinsey [ 71 72 74 Additionally, the pandemic spurred the rapid implementation of minimally invasive techniques and outpatient treatment options, reducing hospital stays and infection risks, thereby enhancing the efficiency and safety of breast cancer [ 75 76 77 72 74 77 78 Conclusion Based on this literature review, we have found that the impact on breast cancer care was unexpectedly not as significant as predicted. The redesigned guidelines and modifications in medical and/or oncological healthcare, which were enforced due to the pandemic, were successfully implemented in clinical settings by healthcare professionals. Especially in the context of breast cancer care, early signs indicate a better outcome than initially feared during the acute phase of the pandemic. However, quantifying the consequences of the pandemic will require several years due to the delay in the dissemination of population-based surveillance data. Nevertheless, the pandemic significantly affected the mental well-being of breast cancer patients. This underscores the importance of timely and effective communication of breast cancer management guidelines to alleviate the fears of the general public.
