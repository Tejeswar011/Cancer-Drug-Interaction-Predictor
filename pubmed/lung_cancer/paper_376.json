A hybrid decision tree-Markov model with a one-year time horizon was used to estimate health economic outcomes. The model considered probabilities of treatment response, mortality, and treatment-emergent adverse events; costs of antifungals and healthcare utilization; and patient utility. For olorofim, patient-level data from the open-label, single-arm, Phase IIb study of olorofim for the treatment of proven or probable IA with limited treatment options (Study 32, NCT03583164 KEYWORDS antifungal therapy olorofim invasive fungal diseases aspergillosis pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes cover-date October 2025 INTRODUCTION Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) pose a substantial risk of illness and death, especially among individuals with weakened immune systems ( 1 2 1 2 Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is the most common fungal disease of the lungs. IA patients may develop cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis as the result of the fungus’s capacity to invade pulmonary blood vessels, resulting in ischemia and infarction of lung tissue ( 3 4 Aspergillus 5 6 IA is principally treated with antifungal triazoles, including voriconazole, isavuconazole, and posaconazole ( 6 7 8 Aspergillus fumigatus 9 – 12 1 13 There is an urgent need for new classes of antifungal agents for IFIs caused by molds, including IA, with only three classes of antifungals currently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved: polyenes, mold-active azoles, and echinocandins ( 1 13 9 – 12 14 Olorofim is an orally administered inhibitor of the class 2 fungal dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme ( 1 NCT03583164 15 MATERIALS AND METHODS We followed the 2022 Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) to report this cost-effectiveness analysis ( 16 Model structure and population We constructed a hybrid decision tree-Markov model in Microsoft Excel to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating patients with IA with limited alternative antifungal treatment options with either olorofim or currently available salvage therapy over a one-year time horizon ( Fig. 1 Fig 1 Diagram describing the hybrid structure of the model, where a decision tree with five time points (days 7, 14, 28, 42, and 84) is followed by a three-health-state (alive success, alive failure, and death) Markov model. IA = invasive aspergillosis; M = Markov node; TEAE = treatment-emergent adverse event. Patients with invasive aspergillosis receive either salvage therapy or olorofim. Outcomes are determined by TEAEs and clinical success, leading to Markov states: alive with success and failure, or death, tracked through short- and long-term cycles. The model assumed all patients were at least 18 years of age, with proven IFI caused by Aspergillus 17 6 7 6 7 17 – 19 15 Treatment effects For both olorofim and salvage therapy pathways, patients were first distributed based on treatment-specific probabilities of having a hepatic treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE), a renal TEAE, or no TEAE, derived from Study 32 and prior literature ( 15 20 21 15 19 15 19 22 23 Table 1 TABLE 1 Clinical and economic inputs used in the model a Parameter Input DSA PSA Source Lower value Upper value Distribution Length-of-stay coefficients (fraction of day per 24 hours spent in the health state) Ward – success 0.20 0.13 0.29 Log Normal Maertens et al.

Patients who were still alive at the end of the decision tree entered the Markov model were assumed to stay either in the same treatment success/failure state (i.e., no transition between treatment success and treatment failure was considered) or die. In the Markov portion of the model, mortality was based on a median survival of 3.5 years similar to common underlying immunocompromising disease states ( 24 During the decision tree, patients accrued days in the hospital general ward and intensive care unit (ICU) based on whether patients experienced treatment success, treatment failure, or death. Ward and ICU length-of-stay estimates for each outcome were derived from Study 32 ( 15 Costs Throughout the decision tree model, costs captured were related to antifungal therapy, hospital ward or ICU lengths-of-stay, hepatic and renal TEAEs, and intravenous (IV) antifungal treatment at home ( Table 1 Average wholesale prices (AWP) sourced from RedBook were used for antifungal drug costs ( 27 https://www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT05101187 19 Table 1 6 7 15 28 Ward costs were estimated as average cost/day in hospital, sourced from National Inpatient Sample data for all hospitalizations using the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project interface (HCUPnet) ( 29 26 17 24 Health utility Health utility values were assigned to treatment success and failure health states and applied throughout the entire model time horizon ( Table 1 15 30 25 Model outputs The model included the total treatment costs (2023 USD) for olorofim and currently available salvage therapy arms, as well as the cost breakdown per treatment arm (i.e., drug acquisition costs, healthcare resource utilization [HCRU], ward/ICU stays, hepatic and renal TEAEs and at-home antifungal IV administration). Health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost-effectiveness results were presented in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is the difference in costs divided by the difference in health outcomes. We expressed ICER as cost/QALY gained and incremental net monetary benefit (INMB), which represents the value of an intervention (olorofim) in monetary terms, calculated by multiplying the incremental benefits (QALYs) by the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold and then subtracting the incremental costs. A positive incremental INMB indicates that the intervention is cost-effective (or dominant) compared with the alternative at the given WTP threshold. The WTP threshold used in the base case analysis was $50,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses For the deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA), each model parameter was assigned a point estimate and uncertainty parameters (i.e., “lower” and “upper” values). These values were set according to distributional information provided in the original source when available. If not available, the lower and upper values were assumed to be ±20% of the point estimate. The DSA varied one parameter at a time to assess the impact of each parameter independently on the model’s conclusions. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) drew values for each variable from their individual uncertainty distributions. For event rates and health utility values, a beta distribution was used to restrict draws to the range of 0 to 1. For costs and HCRU estimates, gamma distributions were fitted to prevent values less than zero. Three scenario analyses were undertaken, including extending the time horizon to 5 years (costs and outcomes discounted at an annual rate of 3%); using a hospital perspective (analysis restricted to 28 days); and applying a hospital perspective while using alternative historical efficacy data for salvage therapy. For the latter scenario analysis, clinical response data from Walsh et al. ( 19 A threshold sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the maximum cost at which olorofim would remain cost-saving and cost-effective, assuming WTP thresholds ranging from $50,000/QALY to $300,000/QALY. RESULTS Base case analysis The estimated one-year cost of treating proven or probable IA in patients with limited alternative antifungal options was $167,971 with olorofim and $208,696 with currently available salvage therapy, resulting in annual cost savings with olorofim of $40,725 ( Table 2 Table 2 TABLE 2 Results of the base case and scenario analyses a Base case results Intervention Total costs Total LYs Total QALYs ICER INMB Salvage therapy $208,696 0.370 0.220  Olorofim $167,971 0.764 0.462  Incremental (deterministic) −$40,725 0.393 0.242 Olorofim dominant $52,827 Incremental (probabilistic) N/A N/A N/A Olorofim dominant $52,553 Cost breakdown by treatment arm for the base case analysis Salvage therapy Olorofim Incremental Treatment costs $110,270 $65,500 −$44,142 Healthcare resource use $97,893 $102,471 $4,578 ICU $19,018 $19,068 $50 Ward $76,966 $83,390 $6,424 Renal TEAE $1,907 $0 −$1,907 Hepatic TEAE $2.40 $12.40 $10 IV antifungal at home $532 $0 -$532 Scenario analyses results Scenario Incremental QALYs gained Incremental costs ICER INMB 5-year time horizon 0.787 −$40,725 Olorofim dominant $80,082 Hospital perspective (28-days) 0.010 −$41,286 Olorofim dominant $41,763 Hospital perspective (28-days) and alternative salvage therapy historic control 0.007 −$38,371 Olorofim dominant $38,705   a ICER = incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; INMB = incremental net monetary benefit; ICU = intensive care unit; IV = intravenous; LYs = life years; QALYs = quality-adjusted life years; TEAE = treatment emergent adverse event; NA = Not Applicable. Sensitivity and scenario analyses The results of the DSA (one-way sensitivity analysis) suggested the inputs with greatest impact on the results were patient weight (as it influenced dosage and certain drug costs), cost/day of olorofim and ICU days accrued by the patients who die ( Fig. 2 Fig 2 Deterministic sensitivity analysis (tornado plot). Tornado plot depicts sensitivity of INMB to input variations. Patient weight and olorofim cost per day have the largest impact, while ICU and ward coefficients, death timing, and success rates show moderate to minor influence. Results of the PSA in the form of a cost-effectiveness plane are presented in Fig. 3 Fig 3 Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (cost-effectiveness plane). QALYs = quality-adjusted life years; USD = United States Dollars. Scatterplot of probabilistic sensitivity analysis depicts most simulations fall in the southeast quadrant, indicating olorofim yields higher QALYs at reduced costs compared with salvage therapy, supporting its cost-effectiveness. The model’s conclusions did not change in any of the scenario analyses, with olorofim being dominant (less costly, more effective) ( Table 2 The maximum cost at which olorofim would be cost neutral (ICER = $0/QALY gained) was $1,470/day. The acquisition cost at which olorofim was cost-effective ranged from $1,638/day at a WTP threshold of $50,000 to $2,476/day, at a WTP threshold of $300,000/QALY ( Fig. 4 Fig 4 Threshold sensitivity analysis of olorofim cost. ICER = incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; QALY = quality adjusted life year; USD = United States Dollars. The acquisition cost at which olorofim was cost-effective ranged from $1,638/day at a WTP threshold of $50,000 to $2,476/day, at a WTP threshold of $300,000/QALY. DISCUSSION The estimated one-year cost savings was $40,725 and total incremental QALYs gained was 0.24 for olorofim compared with currently available salvage therapy. Thus, this economic model demonstrated olorofim to be the dominant treatment option compared to currently available salvage therapy in patients with IA with limited alternative treatment options. The model results’ direction was maintained in both the DSA and PSA, showing its robustness in the face of parameter uncertainty. Among the most influential drivers of cost differences between the two cohorts was antifungal drug acquisition costs, with olorofim being $44,770 less costly than currently available salvage therapy over the model time horizon. Also, as olorofim is an oral medication, its use negates the need for outpatient IV administration, further reducing antifungal-related costs. As an added benefit of oral medication, the elimination of daily manipulation of percutaneously inserted and/or chronically indwelling central venous catheter may reduce the frequency of catheter-associated bacterial bloodstream infections, as well as the nursing time and materials for IV administered antifungal agents. For ambulatory patients, an oral olorofim formulation mitigates the inconvenience and cost of patient time needed to receive IV therapy. The lower total costs in the olorofim arm were achieved despite a modest ($4,578) increase in HCRU, driven by a better survival outcome modeled for olorofim with increased number of hospital ward days compared with currently available salvage therapy. The cost of olorofim has yet to be established, and therefore, our value of $907/day is an assumption and intended to reflect a discounted cost of L-AMB (a frequent component of salvage therapy). Notably, we found olorofim would still be dominant versus salvage therapy up to an acquisition cost of $1,470/day and would remain cost-effective compared to salvage therapy if priced between $1,638 and $2,476/day, depending on the acceptable WTP threshold. IA occurs primarily in immunocompromised patients ( 2 31 32 There are few cost-effectiveness analyses of IA treatments in patients requiring salvage therapy. Herbrecht and colleagues performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of posaconazole versus a salvage therapy external control arm ( 33 P Due to the urgent need for new salvage treatments for patients suffering from IA and the ethical challenges of randomizing such patients to placebo or already failed therapies, assessing the cost-effectiveness of olorofim based on Phase IIb trial data (Study 32) ( 15 19 15 19 19 15 19 Since the study period of 1996–2001 from which the control population was derived from Walsh et al. ( 19 Aspergillus fumigatus 6 11 34 35 8 36 – 42 41 36 42 39 43 44 41 42 15 21 20 21 8 15 19 Following economic modeling best practices, simplifying assumptions were made to achieve a balance between the model’s complexity, the available data, and the overall suitability of the model to answer the research question ( 45 24 46 Conclusions Olorofim is an economically dominant alternative to currently available salvage therapy for IA patients with limited suitable alternative treatment options from a US payer perspective. At its estimated price, olorofim resulted in lower total one-year treatment costs and antifungal therapy costs, and more QALYs gained. With the unmet need for novel antifungals to treat rare IFIs such as IA, new cost-effective treatments would fill a gap in care. This model will inform early clinical and payer decision-making for olorofim-eligible IA patients with limited suitable alternative treatment options.
