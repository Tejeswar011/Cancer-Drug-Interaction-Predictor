Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a food supplement (Atusin ® Methods A post-surveillance, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical study was conducted over 6 months. Participants with acute uncomplicated bronchitis were administered the combination preparation (verum group) or placebo for 10 days in total. The primary outcome was clinical cure, defined as a ≥ 75% reduction in baseline Bronchitis Severity Scale (BSS) score after 10 days. Results In total, 310 participants were randomized 1:1, of which 155 and 150 participants in the verum and placebo group, respectively, were included in the efficacy and safety analysis sets. A statistically significantly higher number of clinically cured participants was observed in the verum group compared to the placebo group on all reporting days until the end of study intervention administration (Day 10: p p p Conclusions The study shows that the studied combination preparation, containing scientifically proven active substances that bring together key mechanisms for cough relief, is effective in the treatment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis.

Therefore, the current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a food supplement (Atusin ® Bromelain was included in this combination preparation as it is a complex mixture of proteolytic cysteine proteases obtained from the stem of a pineapple ( Ananas comosus 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 27 28 Green Brazilian propolis is a resinous natural product that contains a mix of active substances, including terpenes, cinnamic acids and caffeic acids and their esters, amino acids, and polyphenols [ 29 30 30 31 Providing this combination preparation in 1 capsule is hypothesized to result not only in a reduction of the severity of AB symptoms, but also in a higher efficacy in rapid relief of the frequency of cough attacks, a lower amount of pills to be taken, and increased patient adherence. Methods Study design A post-surveillance, prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallelgroup clinical study ( NCT06142994 Study population Adults with a clinical diagnosis of “Acute uncomplicated bronchitis” meeting all of the following key inclusion criteria were eligible to participate in the study:  ≥ 6 cough attacks* (*cough consisting of ≥ 3 consecutive coughs) in the day preceding the screening visit; Bronchitis Severity Scale (BSS) score [ 32 33 cough severity of ≥ 4 on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S1 for more details) at screening; body temperature < 39 °C; duration of symptoms ≤ 5 days before enrollment in the study; occurrence of initial symptoms (sputum production with impaired expectoration) within 2 days prior to initiation of study intervention; non-smokers* (*stopped smoking ≥ 6 months before enrollment). Key exclusion criteria included: history of or current confounding respiratory disease (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic rhinitis, chronic sinusitis or chronic bronchitis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis, and lung cancer), a lung radiogram revealing pulmonary inflammatory opacities, suspected pneumonia, concurrent bacterial infection, and antibiotic intake. A list of all criteria can be found in the Supplementary Material, Appendix S2. All participants provided a signed informed consent prior to study participation. Study intervention The studied food supplement was a gastro-resistant capsule containing a fixed dose of 120 mg distillate of 4 types of purified essential oils (79.2 mg eucalyptus [ Eucalyptus globulus Citrus aurantium dulcis Citrus limon Myrtus communis The studied combination preparation was manufactured according to the local manufacturing guidelines and Good Manufacturing Practices for Dietary Supplements (including Eurofins GMP, ISO 9001, ISO 22000, and HACCP). To ensure blinding, the placebo product was identical to the studied combination preparation in composition, appearance, form, and packaging, but without the active ingredients. The dosing regimen was also the same. The first dose of the studied combination preparation/placebo was administered orally immediately after the participant’s enrollment in the study (i.e., at the end of Visit 1). During the study period, the studied combination preparation/placebo was administered orally by the following regimen: 2 capsules 3 times/day, at least 30 min before food with a large amount of water, for 10 days. The group receiving the studied combination preparation will from hereon be referred to as the verum group. Randomization and blinding The randomization software Randomsamp ® Study schedule Each participant was followed for 14 days in total, including 3 scheduled study visits and a telephone call:  Visit 1 (on Day 1): screening for eligibility, randomization, collection of baseline data, and first administration of studied combination preparation/placebo. Visit 2 (on Day 4): assessment of efficacy, tolerability, and compliance after 4 days of studied combination preparation/placebo administration. Visit 3 (on Day 10): assessment of efficacy, tolerability, and compliance after 10 days of studied combination preparation/placebo administration. Telephone call (on Day 14): follow-up on participant’s condition 4 days after the last dose of studied combination preparation/placebo. Data management Participant data were collected by a trained investigator by means of electronic case report forms (eCRFs). Each investigator’s database was password protected. All participants were assigned an identification number in the study to which all study-related data were linked. Each participant received an electronic patient diary, with username and password, in which the participant reported daily the parameters to be collected as described in Section ‎2.7. Study outcomes In this study, the primary outcome was clinical cure, which was defined as a ≥ 75% reduction in baseline BSS score after 10 days. The BSS score [ 32 33 Secondary outcomes included:  Frequency of daytime cough attacks, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) using the BSS and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the Acute Bronchitis Severity Score (ABSS) [ 34 Time to ≥ 75% reduction in frequency of daytime cough attacks. Cough severity, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 on a VAS ranging from 0 (i.e., absent) to 10 (i.e., the most severe possible cough) on a 10cmlong line calibrated per cm [ 35 Frequency of nocturnal cough attacks, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) using the BSS and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the ABSS (0 = missing/very rarely [1–2 times/night], 1 = rarely [3–5 times/night], 2 = occasionally [6–10 times/night], 3 = frequently [11–20 times/night], 4 = constantly [> 20 times/night]; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S4 for more details). In the study, achieving a score equal to 0 was considered clinically significant. Improvement of expectoration, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) using the BSS and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the ABSS (0 = no difficulty, 1 = easy, 2 = somewhat difficult, 3 = very difficult, 4 = extremely difficult; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S4 for more details). In the study, achieving a score equal to 0 was considered clinically significant. Chest pain and discomfort on coughing, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) using the BSS and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the ABSS (0 = not even once, 1 = rarely, 2 = from time to time, 3 = often, 4 = constantly; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S4 for more details). In the study, achieving a score equal to 0 was considered clinically significant. Quality of life measured as a limitation of daily activity due to cough, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 1 (baseline) and by the participants on Days 1 through 10 using the ABSS (0 = not even once, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe, 4 = very severe; see Supplementary Material, Appendix S4 for more details). In the study, achieving a score equal to 0 was considered clinically significant. Response to study intervention, as assessed by the investigator at Visit 3 (end of study intervention administration) using a verbal rating scale (0 = symptoms resolved, 1 = symptoms improved compared to baseline, 2 = symptoms unchanged compared to baseline, 3 = symptoms worsened compared to baseline). In the study, participants with a score of 0 or 1 were defined as ‘responders’; participants with a score of 2 or 3 were defined as ‘non-responders’. Adverse events (AEs), as recorded daily by the investigator in the eCRF and by the participants in the electronic patient diary from Days 1 through 10 as the incidence of mild, moderate, and severe serious and nonserious AEs. Sample size and statistical analysis Determination of the sample size took into account 1 of the secondary outcomes, i.e., the frequency of daytime cough attacks, and the use of Student’s T-test. A study investigating the efficacy of Myrtol standardized in adults with AB reported an average reduction in the frequency of daytime cough attacks in the target group compared to the placebo group of 12.3% and a standard deviation of 0.43 [ 16 Primary and secondary endpoints were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. The efficacy analysis set included all participants who had provided informed consent, had efficacy data reported on eCRF and electronic patient diary, and had received study intervention as planned over ≥ 7 days (i.e., participants who received the total scheduled dose of the studied combination preparation/placebo over at least 7 consecutive days). Participants who discontinued early due to insufficient efficacy (including a complication of AB requiring treatment), or participants who withdrew their consent to participate but received 40% of the study intervention and had efficacy data available up to and including Day 4, were not excluded from the efficacy assessment analysis. Missing efficacy data were attributed using the method of the last observation carried forward which was recorded on a previous visit/day by the investigator in the eCRF and by the subject in the electronic patient diary. In the efficacy analysis set, the missing information was only filled in for missing CRF/electronic patient diary data that resulted from study drug ineffectiveness (premature termination of the study due to lack of efficacy including fever, signs of pneumonia, complication of the condition requiring treatment prohibited in the study). The safety analysis set included all participants who had provided written informed consent and received ≥ 1 dose of the study intervention. For comparison of continuous variables between groups, the Student’s T-test was used and for comparison of dichotomic variables between groups, the Pearson χ 2 Statistical analysis was initiated after data collection was complete, the database was closed, and each participant was assessed for eligibility and signed informed consent.

All AEs per reported term occurred in a maximum of 2 participants per group. One AE of induced cough and 1 AE of herbal taste sensation, both reported by participants receiving the studied combination preparation under study, were deemed by the investigator to be related to the intervention. One participant in each group (0.6% and 0.7%, respectively) experienced a severe AE related to hospitalization due to surgery. This resulted in the discontinuation of these participants from the study intervention and study. All other AEs were considered mild.

All values are n (%). a Discussion This post-surveillance, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical study evaluated the efficacy and safety of Atusin CAP in comparison to a placebo for the treatment of AB. Most outcomes were based on the BSS and ABSS, 2 validated clinical scoring systems for recording the severity of AB both at initial diagnosis and in terms of responsiveness to therapy [ 33 34 35 This study pre-defined a clinical significance level of a ≥ 75% reduction in overall bronchitis severity (assessed by BSS, thus reflecting the 5 most important symptoms of AB) in the clinical study protocol. The studied combination preparation did reach the ≥ 75% reduction in overall bronchitis severity, frequency of daytime cough attacks, and cough severity. Other randomized clinical studies investigating the clinical effectiveness of phytotherapeutics have shown beneficial effects over placebo. In a study by Kähler et al. [ 36 37 16 The current study demonstrated that the studied combination preparation clinically significantly reduced the severity of bronchitis more rapidly compared to placebo, with a statistically significantly higher frequency of clinical cure being observed in the verum group compared to the placebo group on all reporting days until the end of study intervention administration. In the verum group, 100/155 participants were cough-free at the end of study intervention administration, compared to 75/150 in the placebo group (Day 10: p 6 In general, few AEs were reported, all of mild severity except for 2 severe serious AEs considered to be unrelated to the study intervention. Only 2 AEs in the verum group (Feeling of herbal taste and Inducing cough) were considered to be related to the study intervention. There were no differences in the incidence of AEs between the verum and the placebo group, demonstrating that the studied combination preparation is safe and well-tolerated in adults. Notably, the studied combination preparation is innovative in its composition, being a formula that combines essential oils with other active substances (i.e., bromelain and green Brazilian propolis). To allow the formulation of products with oily active ingredients and poorly water-soluble, lipophilic substances, an innovative excipient is used. This allows the presence of essential oils in the form of a powder and its combination with dry, water-soluble substances. Similar to usual practice in primary care, no microbiological testing was carried out in this study since almost 90% of AB episodes are of viral etiology and, therefore, antibiotic treatment is not indicated [ 2 7 Future studies could be conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of the studied combination preparation in children and in comparison with other phytotherapeutics. Conclusions To conclude, this was a randomized, placebo-controlled study reporting on well-defined outcomes that are relevant to daily clinical practice. It demonstrated that the combination preparation studied, which contains active substances with mechanisms for cough relief, is effective in the treatment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis. Therefore, the studied combination preparation provides an alternative treatment option for patients with AB, especially in primary care.
