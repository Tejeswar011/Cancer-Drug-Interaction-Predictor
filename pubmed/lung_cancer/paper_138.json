The cells were cultured for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with growth medium (10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) in a 37 °C humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 2 2. 2.3 Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay Cell viability was assessed using a CCK-8 assay (Dojindo). SH-SY5Y cells (3.5 × 10 4 2 2 2 2.4 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay Cytotoxicity was evaluated by measuring LDH release from the cytoplasm into the culture medium upon plasma-membrane damage. The cells were plated at 3.5 × 10 4 2 2 2.5 Detection of intracellular ROS Intracellular ROS activity was assessed using the cell-permeating fluorescent redox probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). The cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3.5 × 10 4 2 2 2.6 Analysis of mitochondrial membrane potential Mitochondrial function was assessed by monitoring mitochondrial membrane potential using a fluorescent dye, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1; Invitrogen). The cells were pretreated without LCD (control or H 2 2 2 2 2.7 Quantification of intracellular ATP Intracellular ATP levels were measured using the ATP Assay Kit (ab83355; Abcam), which employs a fluorometric enzymatic reaction to quantify ATP via phosphorylation of glycerol. For reagent preparation, Converter Mix B and Developer Mix N were each dissolved in 220 µL Buffer 23 and kept on ice. A 0.1 mM ATP standard was freshly prepared from a 10 mM stock and serially diluted (0–10 µL) in Buffer 23 to a final volume of 50 µL per well. Cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, lysed in 100 µL Buffer 23 by pipetting, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C; the supernatants were used for analysis. For each well, 1–50 µL of cell extract was adjusted to 50 µL with Buffer 23, followed by addition of 50 µL ATP reaction mix. Control reactions lacking Converter Mix B were included to assess background. After 30 min incubation at room temperature in the dark, fluorescence was measured at 535/587 nm. 2.8 RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real-time qPCR Cells were seeded in 100 mm cell culture plates at 4 × 10 6 2 2 Table 1 TUBB3 NES GAP43 MAP2 −ΔΔCT Livak and Schmittgen, 2001 β-actin TABLE 1 List of qRT-PCR primers.

Permeabilization was performed using PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. To prevent nonspecific binding, the cells were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 10% FBS and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. They were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody, anti-βIII-tubulin, diluted in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20, the cells were incubated for 1 h with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Abcam) and 0.5 μg/mL DAPI (Invitrogen) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Fluorescence intensity was measured using the Operetta CLS High-Content Imaging System (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, United States) with a ×20 confocal objective. Images were analyzed using Harmony 6.1, which provides various modules for assessing neurite outgrowth. 2.10 Western blotting The cells were lysed using RIPA buffer (Rockland Immunochemicals) supplemented with a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, United States). Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay. For analysis, 20–40 μg of protein per lane was subjected to electrophoresis on 8%, 12%, or 15% SDS-PAGE gels, followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, United States). The membranes were blocked with 3% skim milk in PBS containing 1% Tween 20 for 1–2 h at room temperature, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies targeting Bax (sc-7480), Bcl-2 (sc-7382), caspase-3 (sc-56053), caspase-7 (sc-56063), GAPDH (sc-47742), PARP-1 (sc-8007), p38 (#9212), or p-p38 (#4511), all diluted 1:1000. After washing with PBS containing 1% Tween-20, the membranes were treated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP or goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP) for 2 h at room temperature. Detection was performed using the WesternBright ECL substrate (Advansta, San Jose, CA, United States). Images were captured using the ChemiDoc XRS+ imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories). 2.11 Statistical analysis The results are expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), derived from three or more independent experiments. Analyses were performed using SPSS 12 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States) for Windows. Statistical significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s post hoc p 3 Results 3.1 LCD protects SH-SY5Y cells against H 2 2 SH-SY5Y cell growth and proliferation and LCD cytotoxicity were measured and evaluated qualitatively using CCK-8 and LDH assays.
