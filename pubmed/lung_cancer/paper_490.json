Data-driven gated (DDG) CT can correct registration and quantification but requires a radiation dose of 1.3 mSv and 1 min of acquisition time. AI registration (AIR) does not require an additional CT and has been validated to improve registration and reduce the ‘banana’ misregistration artifacts around the diaphragm. We aimed to compare a validated AIR and DDG CT in registration and quantification of avid thoracic lesions misregistered in DDG PET scans. Methods Thirty PET/CT patient data (23 with 18 68 18 max max Results DDG CT outperformed AIR in misregistration correction and quantification of avid thoracic lesions (1.16 ± 0.45 cm). Most lesions (46/51, 90%) showed improved registration from DDG CT relative to AIR, with 10% (5/51) being similar between AIR and DDG CT. The lesions in the baseline CT were an average of 2.06 ± 1.0 cm from their corresponding lesions in the DDG CT, while those in the AIR CT were an average of 0.97 ± 0.54 cm away. AIR significantly improved lesion registration compared to the baseline CT ( P max P P Conclusions DDG CT outperformed AIR in both localization and quantification of the thoracic avid lesions. AIR improved registration of the misregistered PET/CT. Registered lymph nodes could be falsely misregistered by AIR. AIR-induced distortion of the rib cage can also negatively impact image quality. Further research on AIR’s accuracy in modeling true patient respiratory motion without introducing new misregistration or anatomical distortion is warranted.

It is a standard imaging tool for managing cancer patients for surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these treatments [ 1 2 3 4 5 Average CT, which is averaged from the cine CT images acquired at the gantry rotation of less than 1 s over a respiratory cycle, is an effective solution to improve the registration of CT and PET [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 DDG CT, which is derived from the change of the lung density and the body circumference of the cine CT images over a respiratory cycle, has been shown to register well with DDG PET [ 12 13 12 12 13 13 Deep-learning artificial intelligence (AI) for improving PET AC by elastic registration of the CT is a promising technique to reduce misregistration artifacts in PET/CT caused by respiratory, gross voluntary motion, or both [ 14 15 15 16 17 14 One promising AIR is a computational neural network (CNN) trained in a supervised fashion for the registration task. It does not rely on the pre-aligned pair of inter-modality images generally required during training [ 18 19 10 20 15 15 14 The training and validation of AIR included 22 WB PET/CT datasets of 18 68 68 15 0 15 20 20 10 10 10 20 To gain a better understanding of the potential benefits and limitations of misregistration correction with AIR, we aimed to evaluate motion-free avid lesions of DDG PET in patient studies that were identified to have a misregistration artifact and were misregistration corrected by both AIR CT and DDG CT [ 2 12 Methods and materials Thirty WB PET/CT patient data with at least one avid lesion in the thorax impacted by misregistration were retrospectively recruited to compare AIR and DDG CT for misregistration correction. The selection of the patients was sequential in time. The 30 studies included three radiotracers: 23 with 18 68 18 18 68 68 18 68 18 13 13 The data were collected on the GE Discovery MI 25-cm axial field-of-view (AFOV) PET/CT scanners [ 21  Helical CT scan of 120 kVp, 0.984 pitch, 0.5 s gantry rotation time, 64 × 0.625 mm x-ray collimation, tube current modulation (TCM) based on anterior to posterior scout view, noise index = 30, maximum mA = 560 and minimum mA = 60 and 100 for without and with injection of iodinated contrast, respectively. For iodinated contrast injection, the CT scan would start 56 s after injection of 100 cc of iohexol (Omnipaque-300) or iodixanol (Visipaque-320); PET scan of acquisition time per bed position of 2 min for the torso of body mass index (BMI) < 35, 2.5 min for BMIs ≥ 35 but < 40, and 3 min for BMIs ≥ 40. The overlap between two consecutive bed positions was 25 slices or 28%. When the scan reached the legs, acquisition time was reduced to 1.5, 2, and 2 min for BMIs of < 35, 35 to 40, and ≥ 40, respectively; Low dose cine CT scan of less than 1 min acquisition time for about 14 cm coverage over the misregistration area was acquired for 5 s per 2 cm scan position [ 13 22 The cine CT data was sent to a server for DDG CT processing. The patient was discharged. The data transfer and processing time for the DDG CT data was approximately 3 min. The DDG CT was sent back to the server and was used for AC of the DDG PET between 30 and 80% of the respiratory cycle to avoid image blurring. The correction was typically performed during the acquisition of the first one to two-bed acquisitions of the data of the next patient. Non-AC DDG PET data was paired with misregistered CT data and processed by the AIR to generate an AIR CT for AC of the DDG PET data, which was derived from the quiescent breathing phases of 30 to 80%. All DDG PET images were reconstructed with the ordered subset expectation-maximization with 2-iterations and 17 subsets (VPFX-S), including time-of-flight (VUE Point FX), image recovery (SharpIR), and a Standard Z-filter with a post-reconstruction filtering of 5 mm filter cutoff. The various PET reconstructions differed only in the attenuation map used: baseline misregistered CT, AIR CT, or DDG CT. For each patient, up to three lesions were selected for analysis, and lesion quantification and PET/CT registration were compared. The criterion for correct registration was complete overlap between radiotracer activity in PET and the corresponding soft tissue (lung nodule or lymph node) visualized on CT. Lesion SUV max max Results There were 51 avid thoracic lesions in the 30 patients. Misregistration correction by DDG CT was accurate for all 51 lesions. All the lesions were near the diaphragm. The lesion sizes were 1.16 ± 0.45 (mean ± standard deviation) cm. Relative to AIR CT, DDG CT improved lesion registration between DDG PET and CT in 90% (46/51) of the lesions, with the remaining 10% (5/51) being similar between AIR CT and DDG CT. The lesions in the baseline CT were an average of 2.06 ± 1.0 cm from their corresponding lesions in the DDG CT, while those in the AIR CT were an average of 0.97 ± 0.54 cm away. AIR CT significantly improved lesion registration compared to the baseline CT, based on the two-tailed paired t-test ( P max max P P max 13 max Figure 1 18 max max  Fig. 1 A 0.9-cm lung nodule was registered in DDG CT ( c a b max The following studies illustrate the benefits and limitations of AIR.

In this study of 30 patients, all 51 lesions were registered between DDG CT and DDG PET. Although the diaphragm position improved from baseline to AIR, most lesions (46/51, 90%) remained misregistered after AIR. Only 10% (5/51) of the lesions maintained similar registration correction between AIR and DDG CT. An example that highlights this is the 0.8 cm para-cardiac lymph node still misregistered by AIR in Fig. 4 max max 16 CT contrast injection in 13 studies and 21 lesions increased SUV max 2 3 6 7 8 max 23 max max The findings agreed with the results of the previous two studies that AIR improved the registration of PET and CT when it was compared to baseline PET/CT with misregistration [ 10 20 20 10 10 10 The results of EE CT to match with DDG PET were inconsistent between this retrospective study, which used DDG CT derived from a FB cine CT after the PET scan, and the prospective study, which used a BH CT at EE before the PET scan [ 10 max 10 9 10 2 13 24 The finding that AIR could introduce additional misregistration on the already registered lymph nodes in Figs. 7 8 9 8 15 There may be limitations to using AIR for misregistration correction of the PET/CT data. AIR relies on the deformation of misregistered CT data, which may have lost some granularity or detail due to deep inspiration during the CT scan and may still contain motion artifacts that are difficult to eliminate. AIR was trained with limited data sets (10 for training and 12 for validation) [ 15 2 3 4 5 6 AIR was trained using simulated misregistered data derived from registered PET/CT scans, rather than actual misregistered and corrected PET/CT pairs. This is due to the general unavailability of such paired data in clinical practice [ 15 This study has some limitations. First, the AIR was trained using data from one vendor and evaluated using data from another, potentially introducing a training bias that could make the AIR appear less favorable. Cine CT is not yet available on Siemens PET/CT scanners. However, it has become the scan mode for intelligent 4D-CT of Siemens CT scanners for radiation therapy treatment simulation and may be incorporated into Siemens PET/CT scanners in the future [ 25 Conclusions DDG CT demonstrated superior performance to AIR in both misregistration correction and quantification of most avid thoracic lesions on DDG PET. Both quantification and signal-to-background ratios significantly increased from AIR to DDG CT. While AIR improved both localization and quantification of avid thoracic lesions, most corrections still exhibited residual misregistration. Furthermore, AIR sometimes falsely misregistered previously aligned lymph nodes and distorted the aorta and rib cage, potentially degrading image quality. Further research is needed to improve AIR’s accuracy in modeling respiratory motion without introducing new misregistration or anatomical distortion.
