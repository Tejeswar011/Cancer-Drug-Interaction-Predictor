Recently, scholars have begun examining the sugar industry’s use of similar tactics to downplay sugar’s role in obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and tooth decay. Archival records show sugar-industry-funded scientists criticized evidence linking sugar to these harms and deflected attention to other risk factors. Sugar’s connection to tooth decay has been the most difficult harm for the industry to deny. Evidence is emerging that the industry turned to promoting fluoride as the solution to tooth decay thereby averting calls for reducing sugar consumption. Newly accessible sugar and dental industry documents enable investigation into whether fluoride research was manipulated to deflect from sugar’s role in tooth decay, and later to defend fluoride when evidence of fluoride’s own harmful effects arose. Method Internal documents from sugar and dental organizations were examined and compared to the published scientific record. The Industries Documents collection at the University of California San Francisco was the main source of records. Analysis was in the context of the current understanding of how vested interests manipulate science to defend their products. Results Records dating back to the 1930s demonstrate the sugar industry, sometimes in cooperation with dental interests, exaggerated fluoride’s effectiveness and downplayed safety concerns. The sugar industry’s science manipulation campaign preceded the better-known tobacco industry campaign defending cigarettes. Key leaders of the sugar industry’s campaign transferred to the tobacco industry, which then adopted many of the sugar industry’s tactics and financed research from some of the same sugar-conflicted scientists. Currently, a prominent safety issue with fluoride is developmental neurotoxicity. Evidence indicates that researchers with undisclosed conflicts of interest with sugar and allied industries produced biased reviews downplaying this risk. Conclusion Recently available records reveal a long history of the sugar industry distorting fluoride science. Many of the sugar industry's tactics were later adopted by the tobacco industry and mirrored by industries involved in asbestos, lead, pesticides, climate change denial, and others. Researchers and policymakers should be aware of the distorted scientific record regarding fluoride effectiveness and toxicity.

Kearns and colleagues found evidence that the industry sought to shift attention from reducing sugar consumption to alternative caries preventive methods like fluoridation [ 2 6 7 At present, the foremost safety concern for fluoride is developmental neurotoxicity. Rapidly accumulating scientific evidence suggests fluoride has the potential to lower child IQ [ 8 15 16 18 19 20 21 The campaign by the sugar industry to manipulate fluoride science to serve its interests has an unusual feature when compared to better-known campaigns such as those of the tobacco, asbestos, and lead industries, or more recently the fossil fuel industry with climate change [ 22 23 26 Doubt is Their Product: How Industry’s Assault on Science Threatens Your Health 27 28 Propaganda 29 1 The convergence of corporate, dental, and public health interests has produced a unique case of “bending science” which deserves greater recognition. Both David Michaels and the authors of Bending Science: How Special Interests Corrupt Public Health Research 27 31 32 The consequences for public health of delaying acknowledgment of fluoridation’s neurotoxic harm may rival those of the archetypal tobacco and lead industry campaigns to delay regulation of their products. Estimates of the IQ lost from lead in the US for the most-exposed generation born from 1950 to 1980 average about 5 IQ points per person [ 33 34 2 36 37 38 Methods The main source of primary documents was the online Industry Documents repository at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) [ 39 40 43 44 45 Several secondary sources were used to help guide this research and they pointed to additional primary source documents. The secondary sources include recent papers by Kearns and Hujoel on sugar industry manipulation of science and dentistry; the book The Fluoride Deception 1 5 46 47 48 54 Analysis of the historical record was in the context of a growing body of research on industry efforts to distort science [ 22 27 55 61 31 This history of the sugar industry’s manipulation of science follows several threads that sometimes develop in parallel, and at other times diverge or intertwine. The overall history, and the findings within each thread, will generally be presented in chronological order. To more easily see connections between people, organizations, and events in a historical context, a visual timeline was created that displays major events, people, and organizations (Additional File 1, Figure S1). In the timeline, major organizations have color-coded horizontal bars, while vertical arrows highlight events connecting different organizations. Another aide for keeping track of the people and organizations is a list of the major actors with short descriptions, provided in Additional File 1, Figure S2.

Image source [ 82 https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-journal-of-nutrition While Stare and the sugar industry were promoting the safety and wholesomeness of sugar, they were also promoting fluoridation as the solution to the one health effect the sugar industry could not easily deny: tooth decay [ 74 76 4 3 80 81 5 Fig. 3 Extracted from one of Fred Stare’s hundreds of weekly syndicated newspaper column articles [ 80 Stare had founded the Harvard Nutrition Department in 1942 and from its beginning funded it largely with donations he solicited from sugar and food industries [ 83 84 Nutrition Reviews 6 4 86 Fig. 4 From Harvard Medical School student newspaper, reproduced in [ 86 97 As early as 1957, letters from the Boston Nutrition Society to the president of Harvard University had complained that Stare’s nutritional advice seemed to be bought by the food industries that funded him [ 87 83 In 1978 Stare founded, with his protégé Elizabeth Whelan, the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), an industry front-group claiming independence yet almost wholly funded by food, chemical, oil, and pharmaceutical companies [ 88 93 94 95 96 1930s: Earliest efforts by sugar industry Gerald Cox at Mellon Institute of Industrial Research seeks “philosopher’s stone” against tooth decay … and discovers fluoride In 1930, fourteen years before Keys and Stare got their first sugar industry grants, the industry started funding what was called The Sugar Fellowship at the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research [ 98 5 99 100 Fig. 5 Chemist Gerald J Cox of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research. Cox was contracted to study dental caries in rats for the Sugar Institute, Inc. in 1930 and was the first person to publicly suggest fluoridation of municipal water systems in 1939. Image in public domain  The investigation was a part of a study of cane sugar in the diet and was sustained by the Sugar Institute, Inc., an association of cane sugar refiners. [The study found] that susceptibility to tooth decay can be controlled in rats by dietary means. Specifically, evidence has been obtained that there exists a substance which if present in adequate amount in the diet of the mother rat during pregnancy and/or lactation the young will not develop tooth decay when later fed a caries producing diet. As the substance appears to be of the nature of a vitamin it has been named, tentatively …\"dentamin\"as a contraction of\"dental vitamin” Cox’s experiments were in rats given dozens of different types of diets, either to the mothers or their offspring. His first experiments found that rats do not naturally develop any caries, no matter how much sugar is in their diet. Thus, Cox had to “induce caries” in them by giving them a hard cracked-corn diet that caused fractures in their tooth enamel that could then develop into caries [ 101 103 104 To shift attention from this confirmation that sugar accelerates induced caries, he focused on the diet of the mother instead of her pups. A maternal high-sugar diet would not greatly affect the offspring’s caries susceptibility [ 105 106 107 108 109 There are conflicting accounts of how Cox came to consider trying fluoride [ 46 increase 110 105 In many of his trials, more than one factor differed between the control group and the treated group, so it was difficult to determine which factor may have played a role in altering caries rates. This problem was noted by external experts asked to review Cox’s work in 1935 when the Sugar Institute, Inc. was terminating its funding and Cox was seeking funding from a charitable organization, the Buhl Foundation. Officials at Buhl asked independent experts in nutrition research to review Cox’s studies. One of them, the head of the Pennsylvania State College Agriculture and Biochemistry Department, responded “while I should like to be able to give it my endorsement, there are so many doubts raised in my mind [by the] uncontrolled variables” [ 111 Cox’s published paper reporting his fluoride results is filled with caveats, weakly supported assumptions, and contradictory results. One of the three groups of offspring rats with maternal fluoride diet supplementation had a caries rate that was “the highest that we have observed on any ration” [ 105 Whether or not Cox’s experiments justified it, by September 1939 he would be the first person to publicly propose artificial water fluoridation. His paper did not disclose his connection with the sugar industry [ 105 112 Shortly before he had announced his proposal for water fluoridation, he had drawn up an application to patent fluoridation of water and foods, although it apparently was never filed [ 113 114 115 116 118 116 Cox’s experiments eventually gave the sugar industry much of what it wanted. Although he concluded sugar did accelerate caries in what he considered poorly developed teeth, he claimed that fluoride in the mother’s diet could produce offspring teeth that were resistant to decay, even when the offspring had a high-sugar diet [ 119 Decades later, the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Dental Research (NIH/NIDR) sponsored the first rigorous human study to see whether prenatal fluoride supplementation of the pregnant mother could reduce caries in their offspring [ 120 121 Cox’s claim that maternal fluoride exposure reduced caries in their children was accepted by many dentists, and was part of the basis for decades of the dominant position that fluoride acted to reduce decay by being incorporated into the developing tooth enamel while the teeth were still below the gums. While the belief was eventually replaced with the present understanding that fluoride reduces decay predominantly by direct contact with erupted tooth surfaces and provides little, if any, dental benefit from fetal and infant exposure before the teeth have erupted [ 121 122 11 13 123 126 Recently discovered evidence linking sugar industry to fluoridation promotion: Robert Hockett of the Sugar Research Foundation Evidence of links between the sugar industry and fluoridation promotion were noted as early as 1957 by fluoridation-opposing physicians Exner and Waldbott, and discussed from a social science perspective by Brian Martin in 1991 [ 6 127 1 3 128 129 Manipulating science; which came first, sugar or tobacco? The science manipulation methods used by SRF have sometimes been described as originating with the tobacco industry, such as in David Michaels’ book Doubt is Their Product 27 32 130 7 6 8 140  Fig. 6 Key people connecting the sugar industry to the dental establishment and tobacco industry. A 141 B  Dear Sirs:  I note this morning the announcement that an industry committee has been formed to investigate “all phases of tobacco use and health” especially the reputed relation between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Ten years ago a very similar industry association, The Sugar Research Foundation, Inc., was formed to investigate charges that refined sugar is a primary cause of diabetes, tooth-decay, polio, B vitamin deficiencies, obesity, “mid-morning hypoglycemia” and many other conditions.  [As scientific leader of the Sugar Foundation]... During a period of nine years, I organised and directed research projects in medical schools, hospitals, universities and colleges which exonerated sugar of most of the charges that had been laid against it.... The program also required me, as Scientific Director, to lead and to assist in public relations activities such as symposia, radio programs, preparation of moving pictures, publication of pamphlets etc. I delivered scores of talks and addresses before popular, industry and scientific groups.  The challenge of the present situation to the cigarette industry is so similar to that which I helped the sugar industry to meet, that I am tempted now to suggest that my experience and background may be useful to the new Tobacco Industry Research Committee. In a follow-up letter by Hockett to the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC) and the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton who were initially in charge of managing TIRC, he says that he had worked with one of the Hill & Knowlton agents 10 years previously “on the problems of the sugar industry” and the “many delicacies” of funding “academic research by industrial groups” [ 142 143 9 145 149 10 When Hockett moved from sugar to tobacco he not only brought his own expertise at manipulating science, but he also brought two favored grantees of sugar industry funding with him: Ancel Keys and Fredrick Stare. Both started receiving TIRC grants for projects on tobacco and health [ 156 11 A few years later, Hockett arranged to have Stare pass tobacco industry money through the Harvard Nutrition Department to an anthropologist, Carl Seltzer, who was nominally employed by the department [ 161 164 12 13 Sugar is essential ingredient in cigarettes making them more harmful and addictive There was another link between the sugar and the tobacco industries, a link that played a key role in the rapid increase in cigarette sales starting early in the twentieth century. Sugar was found to reduce the alkalinity of tobacco smoke to make it mild enough to inhale into the lungs, something not typically done with the previous common methods of smoking tobacco in pipes and cigars. “Sugar and tobacco have a long and incestuous history”, says Robert Proctor in his landmark study on the tobacco industry [ 166 In one of Hockett’s SRF science bulletins from 1949 an article describes the crucial role of added sugar in making cigarette smoke less irritating [ 167 168 169 170 166 14 167 In 1950, the SRF commissioned a report by a biochemist/statistician to estimate the market for sugar in the burgeoning cigarette industry. The report, titled “Tobacco and Sugar” confirmed for the sugar industry leaders what was a little-disclosed foundation of the American cigarette industry [ 171 15   “Were it not for sugar, the American blended cigarette and with it the tobacco industry of the United States would not have achieved such tremendous development as it did in the first half of this century.” … tobacco and sugar … mutually promote consumer acceptance and consumption. The sugar and tobacco industries were intertwined from the early days of commercial cigarettes, and through Hockett and Stare, seemed to directly help each other with funding of “bent science”. 1940s-1950s: The sugar industry manipulates American Dental Association positions on fluoride Following Cristin Kearns’ pioneering investigations of sugar industry manipulation of science and dental policies, another dentist, Philippe Hujoel, extended Kearns’ research with additional historical documents showing the sugar industry influenced American Dental Association (ADA) policies on fluoride. Hujoel is a dental researcher who has long been concerned about mainstream dentistry’s relative disinterest in dietary sugar as an important factor in tooth decay, as well as dentistry’s dismissal of the role of Vitamin D in preventing tooth decay [ 4 5 175 176 4 5 16 Hockett and the SRF also seem to have helped sway the ADA to drop its previous concerns about adverse health effects of fluoride. Hockett and his public relations counsel Fice Mork (Fig. 6 186 Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA) 187 188 In 1942, a few years before the SRF started working with the ADA, an executive from the sugary cereal manufacturer Kellogg’s, named Emory Morris, was made chair of an ADA committee that set the association’s dental health policy [ 5 17 5 189 191 5 Another connection between Kellogg and the ADA arose in 1945 when the editor of the ADA’s scientific journal JADA 18 191 JADA 5 19 According to an account by the dentist Philip Jay, who was dean of the University of Michigan Dental School and a primary advocate for the first human trial of fluoridation in Grand Rapids Michigan in 1945, the Kellogg Foundation gave at least the initial funding for that trial [ 195 196 199 Sugar industry sponsors 1944 symposium promoting fluoridation to thousands of dentists and public health officials There were other revolving doors between ADA and the SRF, including ADA’s long-time public relations counsel in the 1930s, Fice Mork (see Fig. 6 200 201 20 In a 1945 letter from Fice Mork that was distributed to SRF board members about the causes of tooth decay, he acknowledged sugar’s central role, but ended positively, saying: The entire question of dental caries, from our point of view, is one that both Dr. Hockett and I have been studying very carefully. We have discussed this for hours at a time and we are developing one or two ideas … this whole story of tooth decay is one that we are now approaching from the right angle. Fluorine is it 205 Mork played a critical behind-the-scenes role in getting a special 1944 symposium on fluoride and tooth decay held in New York City that was funded by the SRF [ 206 Furthermore, Mork and Hockett arranged for the SRF to pay not just for the symposium but also the substantial cost to print and mail over 100,000 free copies of the symposium proceedings to every dentist in the United States, along with many pediatricians, public health officials, and dental schools. Mork reported to his superiors at SRF how effective this was in boosting enthusiasm for water fluoridation, stating: “Following distribution of this book on fluorine, many local health departments have started agitating for a fluorine program of their own” [ 207 208 21 The presentation that most explicitly promoted water fluoridation was that by David Ast, Chief of the New York State Health Department Dental Bureau. He announced that a fluoridation trial in Newburgh NY with Kingston NY as the “control” had already started examining children in June 1944. He assured the audience that “Special attention will be given to the questions of … mental development and emotional stability” in children and “Adult examinations will determine the effects, if any, of fluorine in small concentrations on older age groups (past 50 years).” [ 208 The planning committee for the Newburgh-Kingston trial held private meetings. Transcripts of the meetings were uncovered decades later and show they discussed concerns that fluoridation could harm the developing brains of children as well as harm older adults, but they quietly abandoned the planned studies (see Additional File 3). Fluoride neurotoxicity studies in children would not be publicly discussed in the United States until almost 60 years after fluoridation was begun and had been rolled out across 2/3rds of the US population [ 212 18 213 In what appears to be a follow-up to the SRF-funded fluoride symposium, the records of the SRF from June 1945 include a press release written by Fice Mork promoting the first-ever human fluoridation and health experiment that was just getting underway in Newburgh NY [ 214 Fice Mork, long-time public relations counsel for the ADA, and SRF’s first public relations counsel, appears to have been central to the sugar industry’s early promotion of water fluoridation. He started with influencing his many dental contacts; then expanded to all the dentists in the USA by mailing the symposium proceedings book to each of them as well as to many public health officials and pediatricians; and eventually reached the general public via news stories and by inciting local fluoridation promoters across the country, who, after reading the symposium proceedings, were “agitating for a fluorine program of their own” [ 207 1970s: Sugar industry manipulates the NIH National Caries Program Kearns’ first paper, published in 2015, showed how the sugar industry manipulated the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Caries Program of the 1970s (Fig. 7 2 8 Fig. 7 Kearns’ 2015 paper finding sugar industry ghost-writing of the NIH/NIDR National Caries Program.

Used and adapted under CC BY license from Kearns et al. 2015 [ 2 A later example of the sugar industry encouraging the National Caries Program to promote fluoridation is found in the transcript of a 1975 conference in Washington DC sponsored by the ISRF and attended almost solely by sugar industry executives and a few NIH National Institute of Dental Research (NIH/NIDR) staff. The head of the National Caries Program, James Carlos DDS, in a Q&A session lamented the stalled progress in increasing fluoridation in the USA, saying “From now on the battle – and that is a fair term – is going to be extremely hard.” A sugar industry attendee responded “Is this not an area where the National Institutes of Health and the sugar industry might cooperate to promote water fluoridation to the various recalcitrant communities?” [ 215 1950s-2020s: Corruption at National Academies of Science: reviews of fluoride science conflicted by sugar, food, tobacco, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries’ money The Sunday, April 23, 2023 edition of the New York Times (NYT) 216 217 218 61 NYT 22 Conflicts of Interest (COI) at the National Academies at all levels have been a concern for years [ 61 220 With fluoride and fluoridation, the National Academies has a history of conflicts of interest dating back 70 years to its first reports on the subject in the early 1950s. Since then, at least ten reports discussing fluoride safety and effectiveness have been issued, the most recent in 2021 [ 14 115 212 221 227 An NRC 1993 review of fluoride health effects followed the pattern of downplaying evidence of harm and had prominent fluoridation advocates on its panel [ 225 228 229 230 231 232 234 23 It is unknown whether the National Academies was aware of Wagner’s substantial consulting contract with a tobacco and processed food company. No public acknowledgment of these conflicts was ever disclosed by the National Academies. In addition to substantial payments from RJR Nabisco, Wagner also had contacts with the processed food and chemical industry front-group ILSI, an organization that would play a continuing role in manipulating fluoride science as described below [ 238 241 The NRC 1993 review committee that Wagner chaired was described by a committee member of a later NRC 2006 review as having “mostly researchers who were in support of fluoridation” [ 242 243 245 In 2003 Wagner was initially appointed to the next NRC committee reviewing fluoride health effects, but soon afterwards he abruptly resigned, possibly as a result of complaints of conflicts of interest submitted to NRC for other committee members [ 212 246 247 Despite Wagner’s removal from the NRC 2006 committee, the influence of the processed food and chemical industry continued. The chair of the NRC 2006 committee was Wagner’s colleague, John Doull, who also had numerous conflicts of interest with the processed food and chemical industries [ 248 249 24 247 250 251 Conflicts of interest at NASEM concerning fluoride continue to the present day. 25 2000s: Coca-Cola donates $1 million to pediatric dentistry association in 2003, gets policy changed from “[sugary drinks] a significant factor … for dental caries” to “not clear” A more recent, and more blatant, example of the sugar industry continuing to influence dentistry occurred in 2003 when Coca-Cola donated $1 million to the small professional organization The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD) [ 256 257  The academy became a laughing stock when the public (and its members) learned of the deal—imagine, an organization ostensibly concerned about children’s teeth taking money from arguably the world’s biggest producer of sugary foods. But the situation got worse when AAPD President David Curtis defended his group. He stated: “Scientific evidence is certainly not clear on the exact role that soft drinks play in terms of children's oral disease.” That was quite different from the group’s previous position: “frequent consumption of sugars in any beverage can be a significant factor in the child and adolescent diet that contributes to the initiation and progression of dental caries.” What a difference a million dollars makes! The AAPD, like most organizations of dentists, has a long-standing policy of promoting water fluoridation [ 258 259 The sugar industry wasn’t alone in using front groups in the early promotion of fluoridation Although the newest uncovered evidence points squarely at the sugar industry as one of the first industries to manipulate science to promote fluoridation, other powerful industries and government interests were also playing important roles in influencing science, public opinion, and dentistry. The investigative journalist Chris Bryson spent ten years uncovering thousands of pages of documents revealing the role of fluoride-polluting industries like those that produce aluminum, steel, and chemicals [ 260 The Fluoride Deception 46 135 The aluminum industry appears to have been the earliest to spin fluoride science, starting in 1931 almost immediately after fluoride was found to be the cause of dental mottling (now known as dental fluorosis). Alcoa’s internal investigations soon revealed dental fluorosis was appearing in children living near their polluting factories. But Bryson’s book was published before most of the sugar industry documents came to light. If they had been available, he might have included chapters on how the sugar and processed food industries were also manipulating the evidence to influence dentists, doctors, public health officials, and the public. Taken together, the role of powerful commercial and government interests may answer the frequent question of newcomers to the issue of fluoridation: “If it is so bad, then why is it done?”. Many dentists and public health officials seem not to have been aware of the industry manipulations. From the earliest days, they hoped for a “magic bullet” against tooth decay, and many may have suspended their critical thinking. Fluoridation promoters continue to try to dismiss evidence of its risks and of its limited effectiveness, and vested interests continue to feed them biased science, as will be discussed next. 2020s: Manipulation of fluoride science continues to this day The sugar industry along with the processed food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries, has continued to try to manipulate the science to protect fluoridation from the rapidly emerging evidence demonstrating fluoride’s neurotoxicity. Numerous studies have now found reduced IQ in children exposed to levels of fluoride common, or only slightly higher, than in the US population [ 8 18 26 20 261 262 263 264 265 63 In 2020, while a lawsuit filed by environmental groups against the US EPA's lax regulation of fluoridation was gaining traction, and as drafts of a National Toxicology Program systematic review on neurotoxicity were indicating that fluoride could lower children's IQ, this group of ostensibly independent German researchers published their own review [ 20 266 213 267 268 269 Fluoridation promoters have trumpeted the Guth et al. articles [ 270 272 9 10 27 Fig. 9 November 2021 email from Hengstler to CDC Oral Health Division Director Casey Hannan accepting an invitation for Zoom meeting to discuss the Guth et al. 2020 paper.

Email obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to CDC and is in the public domain Not only were the authors of Guth et al. apparently asked to secretly help the CDC counteract NTP’s systematic review of fluoride neurotoxicity, they were also chosen to peer-review an update of a New Zealand government report on fluoridation that contains numerous errors and makes conclusions almost identical to those of Guth et al. [ 276 277 277 281 Bias in the German SKLM commission review of fluoride neurotoxicity (Guth et al. 2020) The Guth et al. articles are fundamentally flawed and biased. They repeat discredited claims put out by groups like the secretive Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) report authors (who published anonymously and refused to release their names, and whose reports were subsequently withdrawn) and the industry-friendly Science Media Centre (SMC) of the United Kingdom [ 282 291 10 11 13 292 293 294 The Guth et al. 2020 review identified 23 human epidemiological studies of the association between fluoride and developmental neurotoxicity and acknowledged that 21 of the 23 found higher fluoride exposures associated with lower intelligence. However, in their criticisms of the studies finding adverse associations, they make statements not based on, and contradictory to, what was reported in the original papers. Instead of citing the papers, they cite letters-to-the-editor by fluoridation defenders that criticized a 2012 and 2014 review of the older literature. 28 295 296 279 297 298 267 299 Guth et al. employ recognized methods of “bending science” [ 31 Bending Science “Chapter 3. shaping science, creating research to fit one’s needs.” The Guth et al. review extols the Broadbent 2015 study while overlooking its serious weaknesses that can explain why it found “no effect” of fluoride on IQ. A major weakness was the lack of contrast in total fluoride exposure between the “fluoridated” and “non-fluoridated” subjects, thereby almost guaranteeing that little difference in IQ would be found between the groups [ 300 10 292 “Chapter 4. Hiding Science, Concealing Unwelcome Information.” Guth et al. omitted mention of the Grandjean 2019 and NTP 2019 reviews, both of which concluded the scientific evidence was strong that fluoride was a developmental neurotoxin. “Chapter 5. attacking science, turning reliable research into ‘junk’.” For example, falsely stating the studies linking fluoride to lowered IQ “lack control of confounding factors such as … well-known neurotoxicants”, which ignores the fact that several of the higher quality studies accounted for lead, mercury, arsenic, manganese, and other neurotoxicants. Furthermore, reviews by Choi (2012), Grandjean (2019), and NTP (2020) concluded many of the studies that did not explicitly control for these neurotoxicants were unlikely to have suffered confounding because, in the specific settings where the studies took place, there was unlikely to be an association between the other neurotoxicants and fluoride [ 16 213 267 300 “Chapter 8. packaging science, assembling an expert group to advance a favored outcome.” The German committee that wrote the Guth et al. review (SKLM commission) has been chaired for decades by the industry-friendly senior authors Hengstler and Eisenbrand as described below. These examples from Guth et al. are tactics the sugar and allied interests have long used to manipulate the science. A recent analysis comparing five different industries, including the sugar industry, identified 28 specific science manipulation tactics [ 56 Are the Guth paper authors truly independent? Almost all the 31 co-authors of the Guth papers appear to be members of a single committee, the SKLM commission of the German Research Academy, which is charged with reviewing food safety [ 301 302 303 304 Who are Eisenbrand, Hengstler, and their German SKLM commission that evaluates risks of chemicals in foods? Eisenbrand (Fig. 11 305 29 Fig. 11 Graphic icon representing Gerhard Eisenbrand who is the science director of ILSI Europe, an industry front-group. He also has other industry conflicts of interest and was long-time chair of the German SKLM food safety committee, now chaired by Hengstler. (See photo of Eisenbrand presenting at an event for industry front-group ILSI [ 309  But Eisenbrand’s most egregious conflict comes from his long-time leadership of the European branch of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), an industry front group. ILSI has been funded and controlled largely by the sugar, processed food, pharma, and chemical industries [ 264 265 308 Overall, the picture emerges of an organized and at least partially covert influence exerted by industry in [Germany’s] central federal institutions that are concerned with risk assessment and research funding …. › Gerhard Eisenbrand is the chair of a committee for the risk assessment of food products (SKLM) at the German Research Foundation (DFG), a member of the Committee for Genetically Modified Food and Feed at the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and a member of the scientific board of scientific advisors at the BfR. At the same time, he is executive and scientific director of ILSI Europe. Through his contacts with the DFG, BfR, BLL [“probably the most influential lobbying association for the food industry in Germany”] and ILSI, Eisenbrand is one of the people who are at the center of a dense network between industry and German authorities, which enables organized and systematic influence. If you look at the BfR, DFG and EFSA [European Food Safety Authority] together, it is amazing how many people who are on the committees at the BfR, DFG or EFSA are in contact with ILSI at the same time ILSI was founded in 1978 by Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola, General Foods, Kraft (owned by the Philip Morris tobacco company), and Procter & Gamble. “ILSI grew very quickly into a powerful force, and began to also lobby for agriculture and genetic modification; pesticides and pharmaceuticals; confectionery; and eventually, even for such unhealthy consumable products such as cigarettes.” [ 264 12 310 Fig. 12 Some of the corporate funders of ILSI. Adapted and modified, with permission, from Corporate Accountability 2020 report “Partnership for an unhealthy planet” [ 311 ILSI has spawned numerous divisions including its Health & Environmental Science Institute (HESI), whose staff includes a former employee of Exponent, Inc., the same industry consultant company hired by EPA to supply expert witnesses to defend fluoridation in a recently concluded lawsuit brought by environmental groups [ 19 266 312 315 At a congressional hearing in 2007, Dr. Jennifer Sass of the environmental group NRDC revealed troubling close connections between EPA and ILSI: “… a relationship that has demonstrably compromised the quality of EPA’s scientific inquiry is the Agency’s relationship with … ILSI.” EPA has even given ILSI millions of dollars in grants [ 316 Consumer transparency advocacy group US Right to Know (USRTK) says plainly that ILSI “is a food industry lobby group” [ 265 58 52 A 2019 article in The Guardian 30 57 320 321 In a 2015 email copied to ILSI’s then director, Suzanne Harris, and executives from firms such as Coca-Cola and Monsanto, ILSI’s founder Alex Malaspina, a former Coca-Cola vice-president, complained bitterly about new US dietary guidelines for reducing sugar intake. “These guidelines are a real disaster!” he wrote. “They could eventually affect us significantly in many ways; Soft drink taxations, modified school luncheon programs, a strong educational effort to educate children and adults to significanty [sic] limit their sugar intake,, [sic] curtail advertising of sugary foods and beverages and eventually a great pressure from CDC [the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention] and other agencies to force industry to start deducing [sic] drastically the sugar we add to processed foods and beverages.” ILSI also has “cozy ties” with the CDC. Investigative reporter Carey Gillam wrote, “What is Going on at the CDC? Health Agency Ethics Need Scrutiny”. She reported “ILSI has a history of working to infiltrate public health organizations … with scientists, money and research to garner favor for industry products and strategies.” [ 322 323 An analysis of both public and internal industry documents by Mialon et al. (2021) found that ILSI has recently taken a step beyond manipulating nutrition science. ILSI is now trying to promote weak scientific integrity principles that ignore “the risks of accepting corporate funding”, resulting in standards that suit “industry’s interests rather than public health ones [ 55 Details of tactics used by ILSI to influence the science and public policy of obesity, a high-priority product defense issue for Coca-Cola, have been reported by Greenhalgh [ 324 327 327 In the Guth et al. reviews Eisenbrand declares no conflicts of interest. Also, no documentary evidence was found of Eisenbrand informing the other SKLM committee members and coauthors of the Guth et al. reviews of his potential conflicts of interest with ILSI and other corporate entities with financial interests related to fluoride. SKLM did not respond to requests for its meeting minutes. However, Eisenbrand has been a member and chair of similar German advisory committees on chemical risks that post their meeting minutes online (committees of the German Federal Institute for Risk Assesssment or BfR). BfR policy requires declarations and recording of potential conflicts of interest at the beginning of each meeting, but in no meetings did Eisenbrand declare his leadership role in ILSI as a potential conflict [ 328 331 Who is Hengstler, who has taken over as chair of the German SKLM commission from Eisenbrand? Hengstler (Fig. 13 332 Fig. 13 Graphic icon representing Jan Hengstler, current Chair of German SKLM food safety commission In a counter-editorial a former Program Administrator of the NIEHS (National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences) component of NIH wrote with some sarcasm [ 333 The authors are … a group of [toxicologists] with no expertise in the endocrine-disrupting chemical scientific field, with undisclosed ties to the chemical industry, who have written an editorial so important it needed to be published in eight journals simultaneously. But is the science accurate? Unfortunately, no. French journalist Stéphane Horel found undeclared industry connections of many of the toxicologist editors [ 334 They call themselves\"prominent\"specialists; they are not. They solemnly declare that they have no conflict of interest; however, half of them have collaborated with the chemical, pesticide, food or cosmetics industry over the last three years. Radically opposed to any regulation of endocrine--disrupting chemicals in Europe, 19 scientists have chosen to voice their opinions while an important decision-making process is underway in Brussels. In 2013, Hengstler took part in a similar tactic of publishing identical editorials in multiple toxicology journals, again claiming EDCs were not a problem. That editorial was also timed to influence EU policy regulating EDCs. The outcry from the scientific community was equally great in 2013, with a counter-editorial issued by 48 editors of leading journals in the fields of endocrine and environmental health [ 335 The editorial … capitalizes on uncertainty, as it seeks to foment doubt on the relevance of EDCs. Although the science behind EDC health effects is unequivocal, there continues to be unrelenting pressure from individuals and corporations with stakes in the status quo to keep doubt alive. Phillipe Grandjean and David Ozonoff, co-editors of the journal Environmental Health 54  The parallel editorials in these scientific journals are not about specific research findings, nor existing science-based public policy. Instead they are written with the sole purpose of influencing pending policy decisions of the European Commission. Fluoride was identified by the US National Research Council in 2006 as an EDC because of its association with thyroid dysfunction which has been identified as a mechanism for fluoride’s adverse effects on the developing brain [ 17 212 In 2019, Hengstler may have invented a new tactic to influence science in what he called a “satirical” editorial that essentially ridicules research and researchers who report finding toxic effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals at low doses [ 336 337 In 2013 Hengstler was on the European steering committee of a toxicology organization funded by chemical industries that organized a conference dominated by presenters from chemical and pharma companies including Dow, DuPont, Syngenta, ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Unilever [ 338 340 In 2011, Hengstler was the lead author of a report that exonerated BPA (bisphenol A) of harm. An investigative reporter uncovered several authors’ links to the BPA industry [ 341 Four authors of a new report concluding that bisphenol A is safe have ties to companies and groups that benefit from the controversial chemical. The report was written by the Advisory Committee to the German Society for Toxicology …. One of Hengstler’s first publications, from 1994, concluded that cigarette smoke may be protective against genetic damage, a finding that likely pleased the tobacco industry [ 342 343 A German organization working on the issue of genetically modified organisms did a careful analysis of Hengstler’s industry ties and concluded [ 344 … analysis shows that the journal [ Archives of Toxicology Bolt, co-editor with Hengstler of Archives of Toxicology 344 By 2004, Bolt and Hengstler had moved on from tobacco industry funding to chemical industry funding with a paper based on work paid for by the European Chemistry Industry Council (CEFIC). For years CEFIC has had the largest EU lobbying spending out of over 400 registered companies and organizations. CEFIC spent over $10 million in 2022 and had a staff of 89 lobbyists [ 345 346 347 348 31 This brings us full circle back to the Guth 2020 and 2021 articles on fluoride neurotoxicity, which had Hengstler and Eisenbrand as senior authors and were published in Hengstler’s journal Archives of Toxicology Discussion The documentary record implicates the sugar industry in the manipulation of fluoride science. This manipulation exaggerated fluoride’s effectiveness against tooth decay, starting with Cox’s claim that prenatal fluoride was necessary, and downplayed the harmful side-effects of dental use of fluoride, including from water fluoridation. The sugar industry used the same science manipulation tactics as the tobacco industry later became known for, but did so at least a decade before the tobacco industry. Indeed, the tobacco industry seems to have adopted many of its tactics directly from the sugar industry via PR people and scientists who first worked for the sugar industry but later switched to the tobacco industry. Another outstanding and possibly unique feature of the sugar industry’s campaign to promote and defend fluoride is that the sugar industry helped “enlist” dentists and their main trade organization, the American Dental Association, along with public health agencies, to be the public face of fluoride promotion. The documentary evidence suggests that without the sugar industry’s distortion of the scientific evidence, the dental profession might not have been as enthusiastic about the promotion of fluoride. Campaigns by other industries and companies on issues like smoking, asbestos, lead, dioxin, pesticides, other toxic chemicals, and climate change have not enjoyed the advantage of substantial support from healthcare providers, their professional organizations, and government public health officials. This investigation benefitted greatly from access to a large body of primary documents from inside the sugar industry, many of which contain information the industry never intended to become public. Several of the archives have been digitized and are available online, some with excellent full-text search functions that greatly facilitated the investigation of specific research questions. Although many sugar industry documents and records from people associated with the sugar industry were available, several of the archives only became public by chance so there may be additional documents that could potentially add more details or even alter the interpretation of events. However, sugar industry records from the 1930s to the 1960s seem relatively complete. They show a consistent strategy with fluoride whose interpretation seems unlikely to be significantly altered by any missing documents. A more serious limitation arises with trying to obtain internal communications of the sugar industry and researchers who had conflicts of interest during more recent time periods. Some NGO groups have been able to obtain internal documents from the sugar and related industries using public records access laws like the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), but the record is not nearly as complete as that available from earlier periods. For example, there are very few internal documents and emails available for the Guth et al. authors with hidden conflicts. Also, unlike the many lawsuits against tobacco and chemical companies, which have produced a rich source of internal industry documents, there have been few lawsuits against sugar companies or related industries. Internal records of Eisenbrand and other members of the German SKLM committee that might reveal links between ILSI or other corporate or institutional actors and the Guth et al. reviews of fluoride neurotoxicity are not available. Interviews with these people or others with direct knowledge, along with new public records requests, should be considered for future research. Similarly, the role the National Academies may have played in allowing sugar industry conflicts of interest was difficult to assess because internal documents of the National Academies are not easily available. As a private organization, it is not subject to FOIA and it has a history of resistance to public disclosure of conflicts of interest [ 216 219 On balance, however, the limitations on the availability of relevant documents were not so great that they prevented uncovering evidence of a consistent sugar industry strategy to distort the science of fluoride’s effectiveness and safety. Conclusion Industry’s long history of manipulating science: from defending lead, to sugar, to cigarettes, to endocrine disrupting chemicals, to fluoridation The Guth et al. articles claiming fluoride is not neurotoxic at levels commonly found in humans appear to be just the latest example in a long history of industry manipulation of fluoride science. Over the decades, the sugar and allied industries started by promoting fluoridation as the miracle solution to tooth decay, but are now shifting their efforts to try to defend it from the emerging science showing it may have been lowering children’s IQ all along, just like “low-level” childhood lead exposure. The lead industry used many of the same tactics to defend its product and to delay regulation [ 131 353 354 When will the dentists and government public health officials who promote fluoridation realize they have been misled by powerful industries working behind the scenes from the very earliest days of fluoridation? Dedication This article is dedicated to the memory and good work of the late Dr. David Egilman, MD, a fearless fighter for scientific integrity against vested interests. He summarized what he believed was the root of the problem [ 355 While most of us have been taught to view scientific research as an unbiased source of knowledge that defies political or economic interests, in fact science plays a central role in corporate efforts to maximize profits. Egilman also adapted a famous quote by Dr. Irving Selikoff, champion of workers exposed to asbestos, who stated, “statistics are people with the tears wiped away”. Egilman transformed this to: “corporations are human beings with empathy washed away”, focusing on what he saw as the root cause of the tears along with a side-swipe at the US Supreme Court’s complicity in granting corporations personhood.

Those trials have been cited up through the present to promote fluoridation. The monograph was by Australian dentist Philip Sutton and gave detailed critiques of the methods and conclusions of the seminal trials. Sutton obtained a copy of a letter to his US publisher from the Nutrition Foundation which tried to discourage publication, suggesting the publisher’s reputation would be tarnished if it published Sutton’s monograph [ 85 7 Arguably, the lead industry had already been using some of the methods of manipulating science starting in the 1920s to downplay the evidence that leaded gasoline and lead paint were neurotoxic risks to workers, the public, and children [ 131 134 46 135 46 46 136 8 Earlier, from 1931–1935, Hockett had worked for the US Public Health Service (PHS) in the same office that was conducting an investigation of the relationship between fluoride, dental fluorosis, and caries [ 137 138 139 9 A succinct example of Hockett’s adherence to the tobacco industry’s strategy of casting doubt on the science is his response at a 1978 congressional hearing on smoking and health. Following an hour of evasive responses, Hockett finally answered a congressman’s questions about whether lung cancer was linked to smoking, and inserted the word “doubt” twice in the space of a single line [ 144 Congressman MAGUIRE. If people were to stop smoking, Doctor, do you think the rate of lung cancer would go down in this country, based on your best scientific estimates and your best tentative judgments? Dr. HOCKETT. I doubt it. I doubt it would go down very much. 10 Goss was known as John Hill’s “right-hand man” and helped lead Hill & Knowlton’s public relations (PR) campaign for the tobacco industry. Goss eventually became president of Hill & Knowlton [ 150 146 147 151 154 145 155 11 TIRC documents reveal that Ancel Keys was being funded by the tobacco industry for work on smoking and heart disease [ 157 157 157 158 160 12 According to The Center For Media and Democracy’s SourceWatch, Stare essentially laundered money for Seltzer from the tobacco industry: “Over a number of decades, more than $2 million in tobacco money passed through secret accounts and were channeled to Seltzer via Stare. The companies paid on a pro-rata basis according to their sales. The money then went into a secret ‘Special Account #4’ held by the Kansas City law firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon. Payments were then made as grants to the Department of Nutrition, where Stare took his cut, and passed the rest to Seltzer.” [ 162 13 The arrangement in which Stare surreptitiously passed tobacco money to Seltzer (while taking a cut) lent the name “Harvard” as cover for Seltzer’s cigarette defense efforts. It lasted from 1963–1977, and netted Seltzer over $2 million. Archived financial statements of Stare’s Harvard Nutrition Department from its inception in 1942 until 1971 have recently been made available online in Harvard University archives [ 42 165 162 14 Proctor describes the link between sugar and tobacco: “This business of sugar in tobacco leaf is a fascinating one — and insufficiently appreciated outside the tobacco man’s labs. Sugar and tobacco have a long and incestuous history, and as one leading insider put it in the 1940s, ‘Were it not for sugar, the American blended cigarette and with it the tobacco industry of the United States would not have achieved such tremendous development as it did in the first half of this century.’ The American-blend cigarette … was in fact a candied-up contraption.” [ 166 15 The consultant who wrote “Tobacco and Sugar” was Dr. Francis Weiss. SRF’s science director Hockett would again turn to Weiss in 1955 after Hockett had become associate science director of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC), asking for assistance in counteracting recent studies linking smoking to lung cancer [ 172 In order to dramatize the dangers in drawing\"cause and effect\"conclusions from parallel trends in two developments, I would be glad to have some concrete examples in the form of charts. There must be many growth curves for environmental factors that would parallel roughly or closely the growth in incidence of lung cancer in the United States. I would like to find several that would appear to be at least as logically connected with the etiology of the disease as cigarette smoking, and also several which are almost certainly unrelated. Showing actual curves of these two kinds should be an effective way of emphasizing the need for caution in drawing conclusions as to what causes what Some of the changes I can think of which have come about in the last thirty years are listed Examples from Hockett’s list reveal a fertile mind trying hard to counteract the already strong evidence that linked cigarettes to lung cancer: 1. Use of diesel engines. 3. Use of oleomargarine. 5. Use of lead in gasoline. 8. Hospitalization insurance. 9. Use of electric razors. 12. Routine chest X-rays. 14. Income tax rates. Hockett’s argument against the seminal Doll & Hill smoking and lung cancer studies ignores the fact that they were not time correlation studies but case–control studies [ 173 174 It would seem, according to some of the critics of our conclusion that “tobacco-smoking is a factor in the production of carcinoma of the lung”, … that we ourselves based that conclusion in part–and even largely–upon the observation that over the last 50 years cigarette smoking and the recorded mortality from lung cancer have risen together. In fact our conclusion is based upon evidence that is entirely independent of that time correlation. … Evidence based on 1,465 lung cancer patients and 1,465 carefully matched controls does, we submit, carry some weight. In view, however, of the emphasis that has been placed, quite wrongly in our view, upon the correlation in time we might perhaps remind the reader briefly of the salient features of that survey. … To limit the possible variables, the design of our survey deliberately made them equal in sex, age, place of interview, and, largely, in hospital of admission. It will be seen that they have also revealed themselves to be remarkably alike in other characteristics – their social class and their occupations, their residence near a gas works, their heating in the home, their previous history of certain respiratory diseases. In relation to smoking they do not differ in their use of petrol lighters, of hand-rolled cigarettes, of different brands of cigarettes; they do not differ in the habit of inhaling. With these striking equalities–particularly in some aspects of smoking–it would seem to us to be unreasonable to argue that either our controls or our cases are biased, and therefore not comparable, or that the information given by the two groups is not equally reliable. … This evidence, we repeat, is quite independent of the time correlation. Despite Doll & Hill’s clear rebuttal of the time correlation argument, Hockett is still hoping to use it in 1955, three years after it was debunked. 16 In recent years a campaign by the Swedish candy industry to influence dental science has been uncovered, which started in the late 1940s. The campaign was apparently independent of the US sugar industry’s campaign but had ethically troubling aspects that are reminiscent of some activities related to the promotion of fluoridation in the US [ 46 177 This study is frequently cited in the dental literature as the best evidence that sugar causes tooth decay, a finding that was apparently in doubt by some dentists when the study was started and continues to be disputed by the sugar industry even today. But the Vipeholm study’s findings held a silver lining for the sugar industry. Another conclusion was that the frequency of sugar consumption was more important than the total amount as a risk factor for caries. To this day in Sweden, there is a policy encouraging children to have all the candy they want but reserved for only one day a week on Saturday [ 178 179 The leader of the dental experiment at Vipeholm, Dr. Bengt Gustafsson, was involved in another ethically troubling experiment in Sweden, more directly involving fluoridation. Gustafsson was an advisor and behind-the-scenes promoter of a secret trial of adding fluoride to the drinking water of half the city of Norrköping, starting in 1951, without telling the public or even the local dentists [ 180 Some of the very first fluoridation trials in the US were also done on mental institution patients, without their knowledge, but those experiments are rarely mentioned when fluoridation is promoted [ 181 182 183 184 In 1970 the sugar industry’s ISRF Scientific Advisory Board (which included Fred Stare) discussed their desire to replicate the Vipeholm study, with orphans given sticky candy, but in a fluoridated area. Presumably, the sugar industry hoped to demonstrate that with fluoridation even sticky candy would not increase the risk of caries. The same meeting also endorsed a suggestion by Fred Stare for a survey of sugar consumption trends in fluoridated US cities. The purpose of such a study was stated explicitly “If sugar consumption has stayed the same during this time, while dental caries has been reduced by 60%, this information can be useful in improving the image of sugar” [ 185 17 The committee was the Council on Dental Health. 18 The ADA’s Hillenbrand being named to a committee of the Kellogg Foundation was just one of many “interlocking directorates” between the dentist groups, sugary foods manufacturers, The Nutrition Foundation, and even chemical company executives concerned about liability from their fluoride pollution. Charles Kettering, who had helped develop the fluorochlorocarbon Freon for DuPont and then the lead additive tetra-ethyl lead used in leaded gasoline (he became president of the Ethyl Company that marketed the lead additive), joined the ADA’s board of trustees in 1936. It is unclear why he had an interest in dentistry, but he had a clear interest in defending fluoride-polluting industries [ 46 Another surprising member of a board of directors was the President of MIT, Karl Compton, who was named the chair of the trustees of the Nutrition Foundation when it was founded in 1941. The Nutrition Foundation was a food industry front-group and it eventually merged with ILSI, a current-day industry front-group. Compton was a physicist, not a nutritionist or health professional. Soon after joining the Nutrition Foundation board of trustees he was to play a key role helping manage the Manhattan Project. Compton also was apparently close to the SRF’s Hockett, because he was named by Hockett as one of his top three references when Hockett applied for the position of science director of the tobacco industry’s research foundation in 1954. The Nutrition Foundation was closely linked to the Harvard Nutrition Department through Fredrick Stare. Stare was the editor of the Nutrition Foundation’s journal and his own Harvard Nutrition Department was largely funded by the food industry, especially sugary and processed foods [ 192 19 The “fluoride-skeptic” JADA 193 194 194 The Colonial Sugar Refining Company countered these opinions by citing unnamed dental experts in New South Wales [a different territory] who favoured fluoridation as an alternative to the elimination of dietary carbohydrates. Three days later, Mr R Muir (General Secretary of The Sugar Growers Council) launched an acrimonious public attack on the dental profession. Muir defended the nutritional value of sugar, questioned its relevance to caries and accused the dental profession of ‘singular failure to improve the dental health of Australians’. Former animosities between the sugar industry and the dental profession were ignited and Queensland’s fluoridation cause lost a potential ally. The Queensland experience, counterpoised against what happened in the US, suggests the importance of sugar industry cooperation with dental interests to spread fluoridation. 20 Ironically, Fice Mork’s paternal grandfather, with whom he shared his given name, owned a cigar store and then a cigar manufacturing company [ 202 204 21 The SRF-funded symposium on fluoride and tooth decay held in October 1944 was widely publicized. In contrast, another symposium, on fluoride’s adverse health effects on workers, had been held in secret several months earlier in January 1944, also in New York City. The symposium on adverse health effects was by invitation only, mostly to medical directors of industries with fluoride liability risks from worker exposures and community air pollution. The funder of the symposium on adverse health effects was kept secret, similar to the symposium on fluoride dental benefits. The funder of the adverse health effects symposium was the Manhattan Project, the top-secret WWII era program to develop an atom bomb. The Manhattan Project even got the US Public Health Service to be the ostensible organizer of the symposium. The Manhattan Project harnessed massive resources from many industries and required large quantities of fluoride. The government and its corporate partners had serious concerns about fluoride’s adverse effects on the workers, and potential lawsuits from damage to farms and people living near factories emitting fluorides. Only one person presented at both symposiums, and that was dentist David Ast, who was promoting what he hoped would be the first-ever human trial of intentionally fluoridating drinking water [ 46 The coincidence of the two symposiums, around the same time, one of which promoted fluoride and the other defended fluoride raises questions on whether there were any connections between the people behind the two symposiums. I could not find documents connecting the sugar industry campaign directly to that of the Manhattan Project or the fluoride-polluting industries. However, intriguingly, the SRF’s Robert Hockett had connections to three people who were at the highest levels of the Manhattan Project. They were Karl Compton, James Conant, and Vannevar Bush who were the presidents, respectively, of MIT, Harvard, and the Carnegie Institution and all held leadership positions as WWII presidential science advisors overseeing the Manhattan Project [ 209 211 140 46 4 5 46 22 A week after the initial exposé the NYT 219 23 In a letter Wagner sent to his contact, the vice president of research at RJ Reynolds (RJR), he boasted of being named to the National Academies permanent Committee on Toxicology and the chairmanship of its fluoride health effects committee [ 233 235 Wagner also arranged for several scientific conferences that would allow tobacco industry employees to present with the explicit arrangement that RJR would, in return, “contribute” generous funding for each conference, such as “a minimum contribution of $35,000” [ 236 Wagner led an attack on the most junior (and only female) member of a research team that had published a paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association 237 24 For more on other conflicts of interest involving FEMA and current sugar-industry-connected individuals, see footnote 29. 25 NASEM was contracted to peer-review the National Toxicology Program’s (NTP) systematic review of fluoride neurotoxicity in 2020 and 2021 [ 14 227 252 253 254 255 26 The letter-to-the-editor, by Seddek & Ghallab, briefly summarizes the Guth 2020 article but does not add any commentary [ 261 27 Among thousands of pages of documents obtained through FOIA, no records were found of the CDC Oral Health Division reaching out to authors of any of several published reviews that concluded there was an association between fluoride and reduced IQ in children, nor to any authors of the dozens of primary studies finding fluoride neurotoxicity. The FOIA documents instead reveal sustained efforts by CDC to alter and even block the NTP report from publication [ 273 275 28 Guth et al. repeatedly cite letters-to-the-editor by Feldman 2014; Gelinas and Allukian 2014; Sabour and Ghorbani 2013; and Sutton et al. 2015 [ 20 29 A more recent conflict of interest that was not acknowledged in Eisenbrand’s declaration for the EU was his membership in the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association (FEMA) committee on food additives Generally Regarded as Safe (GRAS) [ 306 60 59 249 307 30 ILSI also has close connections with the successor organization of the SRF, currently called The Sugar Association, Inc. The president of the Sugar Association, Courtney Gaine, worked for ILSI before moving to The Sugar Association [ 317 318 319 31 Bolt and Hengstler have another apparent conflict of interest as the leaders in the toxicology section of the German Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors (IfADo) [ 301 349 350 351 352 Publisher’s Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
