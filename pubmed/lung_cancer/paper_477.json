Currently, curative surgical resection remains the primary treatment for early-stage lung cancer. However, 60% of lung cancer patients are ineligible for surgery due to various reasons (such as poor cardiopulmonary function or refusal of surgery). Microwave ablation of pulmonary nodules is an effective local treatment method that preserves lung parenchyma. However, being an invasive procedure, postoperative complications are inevitable in some patients. There is currently a scarcity of research that examines perioperative factors comprehensively, with few predictive models available in this context. Through analyzing the clinical data of 117 patients undergoing microwave ablation, our study identified BMI (Body mass index), emphysema, reduced lung diffusion capacity, and number of pleural punctures as independent risk factors for pneumothorax in patients with pulmonary nodules undergoing microwave ablation. Additionally, postoperative electrolyte imbalance was recognized as an early independent predictor for pneumothorax in these patients. Emphysema, tumor-pleura distance ≤ 10 mm, and maximum ablation power represent independent risk factors for postoperative pleural effusion after lung microwave ablation, while postoperative neutrophils count serves as an early independent predictive factor. The nomogram prediction models based on the above variables demonstrate strong predictive value, offering valuable guidance for clinical decision-making.

In 2022, there were 2.48 million new cases of lung cancer globally, accounting for approximately one-eighth of all cancer diagnoses, with 1.82 million deaths attributed to lung cancer, representing nearly one-fifth of all cancer-related deaths 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Due to the relatively special tissue structure of the lungs, MWA demonstrates higher convection and lower heat settlement effects in inflated lung tissue than other thermal ablation techniques, as well as strong penetrating power. Therefore, MWA has a high thermal efficiency, rapid temperature increase, short ablation time, a relatively uniform high-temperature thermal field, and a wide range of necrosis in the coagulation zone 10 11 9 6 12 10 13 13 16 13 17 Materials and methods Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria: (1) Pulmonary nodules with confirmed pathology or a high suspicion of malignancy on chest CT; (2) Inoperable due to comorbidities such as advanced age, previous history of lung resection, poor cardiopulmonary function, or refusal of surgery due to significant anxiety or fear; (3) Unilateral or bilateral lung nodules ≤ ≤ ≤ Exclusion criteria: (1) Severe bleeding tendency or coagulation dysfunction uncorrectable within a short timeframe (prothrombin time > 18 s, prothrombin activity < 40%, platelet count < 50 × 10 9 Research subject A retrospective analysis was conducted on 112 patients (undergoing a total of 117 MWA sessions) with pulmonary nodules treated in the Department of Thoracic Surgery at our hospital from November 2020 to May 2024, during which a total of 125 pulmonary nodules were successfully ablated. The data were sourced from patient medical records, nursing documentation, and various auxiliary examinations, all of which were collected by one individual and subsequently confirmed and validated by another. The analysis of complication data centered around the aggregate number of lung MWA procedures (117 sessions), focusing on complications with an incidence rate exceeding 10%. Out of the total cohort, pneumothorax was observed in 30 patients, accounting for 25.6%, while postoperative pleural effusion occurred in 23 patients, representing 19.7% of cases. All patients included in this study were informed of the relevant surgical risks preoperatively, and their informed consent was obtained. This retrospective study adhered to the principles of the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (Approval No. 2021-Technology-95). Ablation methods All patients received an enhanced chest CT before MWA to evaluate the location, number and size of the tumors, as well as their relative relationships to important organs, blood vessels and bronchi. All laboratory tests were completed 1–3 days before MWA. In cases of preoperative electrolyte imbalances, manual intervention was necessary for correction before reevaluation. Relevant staging tests, such as bone scans or head CT scans, and PET/CT as needed, were also conducted to evaluate lymph node involvement and distant metastases. Under the guidance of multi-slice spiral CT (scan parameters: voltage 120 kV, current 250 mA, pitch 0.984, rotation speed 0.6 s, thin-layer scanning with a slice thickness interval of 1 mm), MWA was performed using the ECO MWA system (Nanjing ECO Medical Equipment Co., Ltd.), with a frequency of 2450 MHz and adjustable continuous wave output power ranging from 0 to 60 W. The effective length of the microwave antenna was 10–15 cm, with an outer diameter of 1.6 mm. The power and time parameters of the MWA device were set according to the size and location of the nodules. Prior to ablation, 5–10 mL of 1% lidocaine was administered for local anesthesia. A water-cooling system was simultaneously used during ablation to prevent heat damage to adjacent tissues or organs caused by the rapid expansion of the ablation zone. And complete ablation was achieved when the ground-glass shadow beyond the edge of the tumor measured about 5 to 10 mm. Following removal of the ablation needle, a CT scan was performed immediately to assess the ablation status and check for complications such as pneumothorax. The entire surgical procedure took place in a sterile environment, with continuous monitoring of the patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation to ensure stable vital signs. After surgery, routine chest X-rays should be performed 6 h postoperatively to detect delayed complications. In subsequent treatment or follow-up examinations, chest tube drainage may be necessary for patients with pneumothorax causing > 30% lung collapse, pleural effusion causing > 10% lung collapse, or for those with significant symptoms 18 Observational indicators Preoperative information Gender, age, BMI (Body Mass Index), COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), emphysema, history of ipsilateral lung surgery, maximum nodule diameter, tumor-pleura shortest distance, FVC (Forced Vital Capacity), FVC as a percentage of predicted, FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s), FEV1 as a percentage of predicted, PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow), FEV1/FVC, DLCO (Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity), pulmonary ventilation function and pulmonary diffusion function.

Discussion Despite the advancements in robotic assistance systems 19 20 6 18 21 28 Pneumothorax is the most common complication observed in patients undergoing lung MWA, with an incidence rate of 25.6% in this retrospective study, consistent with rates reported in previous studies ranging from 8.5 to 63% 6 7 14 26 29 37 38 23 32 33 35 39 41 Emphysema is characterized by permanent enlargement of the distal air spaces in the lung, which results in the destruction of alveolar walls 42 6 21 23 32 43 45 6 32 46 47 48 2 P 49 50 Furthermore, other relevant studies have reported that a history of lung surgery 36 43 51 6 36 43 6 18 36 51 6 18 35 6 18 52 18 51 27 32 38 53 36 45 51 32 18 32 44 54 35 55 6 45 45 37 Pleural effusion is a common complication following MWA, second only to pneumothorax, with an incidence rate of 19.7% in this retrospective study, consistent with previous findings ranging from 1 to 60% 6 29 31 33 56 43 57 25 6 23 25 29 33 43 56 In 2008, Tajiri et al. 57 6 18 58 23 6 23 25 57 58 58 21 58 59 55 Other relevant studies have reported that factors such as the use of cluster electrodes 6 58 6 18 6 18 6 37 37 Based on the independent risk factors identified in this study, a visual nomogram predictive model was developed for pneumothorax and pleural effusion in patients undergoing MWA for pulmonary nodules. By integrating relevant clinical data, preoperative risk stratification of patients undergoing MWA can be conducted to assess the postoperative risks of related complications. The predictive model’s discriminative ability was evaluated using ROC curves, yielding an AUC of 0.863 for pneumothorax prediction and 0.888 for pleural effusion, demonstrating great discriminative performance. Additionally, utilizing the bootstrap method with 1000 resamples, a calibration curve for the model was generated, showing strong agreement between predicted and actual outcomes. In clinical practice, incorporating this predictive model can facilitate early identification of patients at high risk for pneumothorax or pleural effusion post-MWA, enabling more rigorous preoperative preparation, timely diagnosis, intervention, and ultimately, preventing adverse outcomes. This study has several limitations, including its single-center design, limited sample size, and lack of external validation of the dataset. And overfitting might be present when conducting consistency validation of predictive models. Additionally, the study did not differentiate between immediate-onset and delayed-onset pneumothorax in patients, nor did it address cases where pneumothorax coexisted with pleural effusion. In the future, further validation of this predictive model is expected to be supplemented through large-sample multicenter studies. In summary, a low preoperative BMI, concomitant emphysema, impaired lung diffusion function, and an increased number of pleural punctures are independent risk factors for pneumothorax in patients undergoing MWA for pulmonary nodules. Additionally, postoperative electrolyte imbalance was recognized as an early independent predictor for pneumothorax in these patients. Preexisting emphysema, the shortest tumor-pleura distance of ≤ 10 mm, and higher ablation power are independent risk factors for postoperative pleural effusion in these patients. while elevated NEUT levels within 24 h postoperatively serves as an early independent predictive factor. The predictive model developed from these factors demonstrates high accuracy and clinical applicability. Moving forward, MWA, as an independent technique akin to surgery and SBRT, is expected to play an increasingly significant role in the comprehensive treatment of pulmonary tumors.
