Immunotherapy with “check-point inhibitors” (CPI) is complicated by immune related adverse events (IRAE), occurring in a large fraction of patients, with organ-specific inflammation of immunologic aetiology. We hypothesized that such IRAE are associated to regulatory T cell (Treg) dysfunction. To start testing this hypothesis, we have now compared organ targets of CPI-induced IRAE with those described in IPEX (Immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked) patients carriers of deleterious mutations in the Foxp3 gene leading to deficient/absent Treg. Method We compared the frequency of autoimmune diseases (AID) in three groups of conditions: CPI-induced IRAE, IPEX patients, and the General Population (GP) through a PubMed search from 01/01/1998 to 31/05/2024. For each group, and each autoimmune disease, the highest reported frequency was selected, listed in reference to CPI-IRAE and classified from the highest to lowest prevalence. Identified were enteropathy, rash (eczema or other dermatitis), transaminitis/hepatitis, hypothyroidism, increased lipase/exocrine pancreatitis, arthralgia/inflammatory arthritis, hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes mellitus, haemolytic anaemia, Sjögren´s syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and systemic sclerosis. Results While dermatitis and thyroid disease are also the most frequent AID in the GP, the latter, together with enteropathy, hepatitis, and adrenal insufficiency are much more frequent in CPI-IRAE and IPEX. Of note, the most frequent systemic AID in the GP such as de novo Sjögren´s syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and systemic sclerosis are extremely rare in CPI-IRAE (few case reports) and not described in IPEX. Conclusion Our finding provides further evidence for the possibility that the functional inhibition/inactivation of Treg is a plausible contributing mechanism in the physiopathology of CPI-IRAE.

The treatment is believed to remove inhibitory signals, either at the level of anti-tumour effector (cytotoxic) T cells or of their interaction with tumour targets [ 1 2 Immunotherapy with combination CPI (anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1) is complicated by immune related adverse events (IRAE), occurring in 86.8% of patients, with organ-specific inflammation of immunologic aetiology [ 3 4 Immune dysregulation polyendocrinopathy enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) is an inborn error of immunity caused by deleterious mutations in the Foxp3 gene. This transcription factor is required for the development and suppressor function of Treg. Although there are diverse immune-mediated manifestations, neonates and infants with IPEX and consequent Treg dysfunction usually present with a triad of organ-specific autoimmunity, most commonly enteropathy, dermatitis, and endocrinopathy, invariably lethal if left untreated [ 5 Aside from rare monogenic disorders, key determinants of most individual organ-specific autoimmunity remain to be established. Here we present findings supporting the hypothesis that CPI contribute to IRAE due to Treg depletion/dysfunction and hope to provide insight into organ-specific auto-immune diseases. Methods We aimed to compare the frequency of Autoimmune Diseases (AID) between CPI-IRAE, IPEX patients, and the General Population (GP). First, we reviewed PubMed registered highest reported frequency for each CPI-IRAE identified as autoimmune (including antagonists of both the CTLA-4 and PD-1 axis) from meta-analysis, systematic and focused reviews, and Phase III clinical trials. The following keywords were used: “immune mediated adverse events due to ipilimumab and nivolumab”. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported frequency ratios. The date of publication, bibliographic reference, number of patients and frequency of IRAE can be found in Supplementary Table 1 2 3 5 The frequency of autoimmune conditions was compared between CP-IRAE and the GP and CP-IRAE and IPEX by Pearson correlation (p value less than 0.05 considered to be statistically significant). No further statistical inferences were made based on the facts that a proper comparison of prevalence rates demands estimates of bias from confounding variables, which were unmatchable, and, most importantly, such an analysis would be prejudiced by the low base rate of organ-specific autoimmunity in the GP, as opposed to its high prevalence in the small sample of IPEX patients. Results While dermatitis and thyroid disease are also the most frequent AID in the GP, the latter, together with enteropathy, hepatitis, and adrenal insufficiency are much more frequent in CPI-IRAE and IPEX. Of note, the most frequent systemic AID in the GP such as de novo 1 Table 1 Frequency of Immune-Related Adverse Events (IRAE) found in cancer patients treated with check-point inhibitors (CPI) compared to the corresponding prevalence in the general population (GP) and patients with immune dysfunction, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome (IPEX) Target organ/Auto immune disease CPI-IRAE (%) Order of f GP (%) Order of f IPEX (%) Order of f Gut (diarrhoea/colitis) 45 1 1.4 4 100 1 Skin (eczema/other dermatitis) 42 2 7.7 2 89 2 Liver (transaminitis/hepatitis) 20 3 0.07 7 20 6 Thyroid (hypothyroidism) 17 4 8.8 * 1 26 5 Exocrine pancreas (pancreatitis/↑ lipase) 16.8 5 0.01 ɫ 10 Rare/underestimated 9 Joints (arthralgia/inflammatory arthritis) 14 6 4.86 ‡ 3 9 7 Pituitary gland (hypophysitis) 8 7 0.88 † 5 Not described Adrenal gland (insufficiency) 4.2 8 0.02 § 8 1.5 8 Endocrine pancreas (type 1 diabetes mellitus) 2.6 9 0.5 6 49 3 Erythrocytes (haemolytic anaemia) 0.6 10 0.02 9 33 4 Salivary/lacrimal glands (Sjögren´s syndrome) N ɸ 1.06 Not described Musculokeletal (polymyalgia rheumatica) N ɸ 0.86 Not described Enthesis (ankylosing spondylitis) N ɸ 0.8 Not described Skin, joints, kidney, marrow and nervous system (systemic lupus erythematosus) N ɸ 0.52 Not described Brain (multiple sclerosis) N ɸ 0.38 Not described Skin, lung, heart, gut, kidneys (systemic sclerosis) N ɸ 0.06 Not described Legend: f stands for frequency; *no iodine deficiency in the population; ɫJapanese data mostly regarding IgG4-related disease; ‡reports to rheumatoid arthritis; †surgical archive from 1986 to 2004. It therefore may underestimate the true occurrence of IgG4 hypophysitis, first recognized as an entity in 2006; §excludes congenital adrenogenital disorders; ɸ% undisclosed There are large differences between CPI-IRAE and the GP with respect to adrenal insufficiency, hepatitis and enteropathy, with striking similarities between IRAE and IPEX for the same pathologies. Pearson correlation revealed a statistically significant strong interaction between CP-IRAE and IPEX ( r p r p Discussion and Conclusion If CPI were to simply enhance autoimmunity, ensuing de novo As the sole known defect in IPEX is the absence (in null mutations) or deficiency (in hypomorphic mutations) of Treg function, it is tempting to propose that functional inhibition/inactivation of Treg is a plausible contributing mechanism to the physiopathology of IRAE. CPI-IRAE and IPEX clinical phenotypes differ in the frequency of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), rarely reported as IRAE in CPI-treated patients. The fact that IPEX patients with hypomorphic Foxp3 mutations also remain unaffected by T1DM is suggestive that partial Treg function suffices to ensure pancreatic islet cell immune homeostasis (Supplementary Table 4 5 As limitations to the present report, we recognize that (i) we did not differentiate between milder from severe (≥ 3) adverse events graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. All grade adverse events were included. However, we wish to point out that there is a very likely underestimation of the real frequency of bona fide versus Organ-specific autoimmune diseases develop when immune dysregulation causes tissue damage. Despite limitations due to the retrospective nature and heterogeneity of the included studies, the key strength of our study is the fact that cancer immunotherapy patients represent unique but unexplored human models for unravelling determinants of AID, a longstanding question in fundamental immunology. As cancer incidence continues to rise, millions of patients will be eligible for immunotherapy and we believe the time has come for questions on AID to be systematically addressed, namely by generating more complete immunological information in these patients. We would hope that this will be the case in a good fraction of the thousands of ongoing clinical trials with CPI therapy.
