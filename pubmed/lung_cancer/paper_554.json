With an incidence of approximately 4.5 cases per million children, RMS accounts for 5%–10% of all pediatric tumors and 45% of soft tissue sarcomas [ 1 RMS is highly heterogeneous and is classified into distinct histological subtypes, including embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS), each exhibiting unique pathogenesis, clinical manifestation, and prognoses [ 2 3 4 Over the past few decades, multidisciplinary treatment strategies have significantly improved outcomes for RMS patients, with 5‐year survival rates reaching approximately 70% for low‐risk and some intermediate‐risk cases [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Thiostrepton (TST), a structurally unique and biologically diverse compound, was first isolated from Streptomyces azureus 12 TRIM6 TIS21/FOXM1 PAX8 13 14 15 16 17 18 Despite its promising antitumor effects in various cancers, the role and mechanisms of TST in RMS remain unexplored. Investigating the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of TST in RMS holds significant clinical value and may pave the way for novel treatment strategies for this aggressive pediatric malignancy. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Screening of Potential Therapeutic Compounds Raw data from RMS‐related datasets ( GSE28511 GSE141690 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ p |log  2 (Fold Change)| https://clue.io/ p 2.2 Cell Culture The RMS cell lines A204 and RD were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium (supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) and Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (DMEM) (supplemented with 10% FBS), respectively. Cells were maintained at 37°C, 5% CO 2 2.3 Cell Proliferation and Half Maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC50) Determination (Cell Counting Kit‐8 [CCK‐8] Assay) Log‐phase A204 and RD cells were seeded in 96‐well plates at 10,000 cells/well and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then treated with varying concentrations of TST (0, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 25, 50, 100 μmol/L, prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]), along with medium and PBS controls. After 24 h, 10 μL of CCK‐8 reagent was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader, and IC50 values were calculated using SPSS and GraphPad Prism. 2.4 Cell Proliferation Assay (CCK‐8 Assay) Log‐phase A204 and RD cells were seeded in 8 × 96‐well plates (10,000 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were treated with 5 μmol/L or 10 μmol/L TST, along with DMSO vehicle control, medium‐only, and PBS groups. At 0, 24, 48, and 72 h, 10 μL CCK‐8 reagent was added, followed by 2‐h incubation. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm to assess proliferation. 2.5 Wound Healing Assay Log‐phase A204 and RD cells were adjusted to 5 × 10 5 2.6 Transwell Assay A 5% Matrigel matrix was prepared in serum‐ and antibiotic‐free medium and applied to Transwell inserts (60 μL/insert). After 3‐h incubation at 37°C, excess liquid was removed, and inserts were hydrated with 100 μL serum‐free medium for 30 min. Serum‐starved cells (1 × 10 6 2.7 Apoptosis Assay Log‐phase A204 and RD cells (2 × 10 5 2.8 Cell Cycle Analysis Log‐phase A204 and RD cells (1 × 10 6 2.9 Animal Model Establishment Nineteen 4–6 week‐old male BALB/c‐nu mice were housed in a specific pathogen‐free (SPF) facility. Log‐phase RMS cells (5 × 10 7 19 TST group (0.1 mL TST, 17 mg/kg, every 2 days). Cyclophosphamide (CTX) group (0.1 mL, 20 mg/kg, every 2 days). PBS control group (0.1 mL PBS, every 2 days). Treatments lasted 4 weeks, with tumor volume measured every 6 days. After 4 weeks, mice were anaesthetized, blood was collected via orbital puncture, and organs/tumors were excised for histological analysis or frozen storage. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed to assess apoptosis induction, and organ toxicity was evaluated. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University. 2.10 Transcriptome Sequencing A204 cells were treated with TST or DMSO control, washed with cold PBS, and lysed in Trizol for RNA extraction. RNA quality was assessed using Nanodrop 2000 and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. mRNA was enriched using Oligo(dT) magnetic beads, and libraries were constructed via fragmentation, reverse transcription, and end repair. Library quality was verified using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina platform (PE150 mode), generating ≥ 30 M reads/sample. After quality filtering, reads were aligned to the reference genome using hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts 2 (HISAT2), and fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads (FPKM) values were calculated using StringTie. DEGs ( |log  2 (FC)| p 2.11 Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS 21.0 and GraphPad Prism, presented as mean ± SD.

By leveraging GEO database‐derived hub genes as search indices within Cmap, researchers can rapidly screen for potential anticancer compounds, accelerating drug discovery and facilitating drug repurposing strategies. This approach has already demonstrated its clinical value, as evidenced by the repurposing of the antiparasitic drug albendazole for hepatocellular carcinoma (NCT04823192), achieving a 46% disease control rate in Phase I trials [ 25 26 27 Our study provides compelling evidence that TST significantly inhibits RMS cell proliferation, migration, and invasion both in vitro and in vivo while promoting apoptosis. These findings align with extensive preclinical research demonstrating TST's broad antitumor activity across multiple cancer types through diverse molecular mechanisms. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of TST on cells exhibits a remarkable dose dependence. As the concentration of TST rises, its inhibitory efficacy on cells gradually strengthens. During the in‐depth analysis of the experimental results, it was discovered that the basal apoptosis levels in the control groups of the A204 and RD cell lines were relatively high. Through analysis, it is hypothesized that certain factors in the cell‐culture process, such as subtle differences in the composition of the culture medium and the culture environment, might have influenced the experimental outcomes. However, the specific impact of these factors on the experimental results remains to be further explored in depth. In breast, lung, and prostate cancers, TST primarily targets ribosomal function, binding to the 50S subunit to prevent aminoacyl‐tRNA accommodation at the A‐site, thereby disrupting translation initiation/elongation and suppressing oncogenic protein synthesis [ 28 29 30 31 32 33 Bcl‐2 30 34 It is worth noting that our transcriptomic analysis revealed significant suppression of the PI3K‐AKT pathway in TST‐treated RMS cells, with marked downregulation of downstream effectors ( AKT JAK eNOS BRCA1 PEPCK G6Pase CDKs 35 36 37 38 39 40 It should be emphasized that TST not only inhibits the PI3K‐AKT pathway but also exhibits multi‐target effects. TST can inhibit protein synthesis, disrupting the normal production process of proteins within tumor cells. This interference further affects the growth and proliferation of tumor cells. Meanwhile, TST can regulate FoxM1. As a key transcription factor, FoxM1 plays a vital role in processes such as the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells. TST's regulation of FoxM1 further impacts the biological behavior of tumor cells. These interrelated multi‐target effects collectively contribute to the complex mechanism of action of TST. In conclusion, our work establishes that TST exerts potent anti‐RMS effects primarily through inhibition of aberrant PI3K‐AKT signaling. Given the pathway's well‐documented role in RMS pathogenesis and treatment resistance, TST represents a promising candidate for further preclinical and clinical evaluation in this aggressive pediatric malignancy. Building on these findings, our future research will focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying TST‐mediated PI3K‐AKT pathway modulation. We will further explore synergistic therapeutic strategies combining TST with targeted agents (e.g., mTOR inhibitors, mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors) or immune checkpoint inhibitors, aiming to enhance antitumor efficacy and overcome drug resistance. Systematic preclinical studies will be conducted to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic potential of TST‐based regimens in advanced RMS models. These efforts aim to provide robust preclinical evidence to support the clinical translation of TST for RMS patients.
