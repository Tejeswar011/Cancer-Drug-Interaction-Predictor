The primary symptoms include disequilibrium due to vestibular nerve dysfunction, as well as sensorineural hearing loss resulting from damage to the cochlear nerves, which run in parallel within the internal auditory canal. In rare instances, tumor growth can lead to brainstem compression, with potentially fatal outcomes. However, reports for predicting the clinical course in individual patients are limited [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 VSs can be broadly classified into hereditary (bilateral) and sporadic (unilateral) cases based on the onset mode. Hereditary VSs, as part of neurofibromatosis type‐2 (NF2)‐related schwannomatosis, are known to result from germline variants in NF2 9 10 11 12 NF2 13 NF2 14 15 16 NF2 17 18 19 20 21 22 17 18 19 20 21 23 24 25 26 In this study, we focused on applying molecular genetic approaches, which have been widely used in the clinical management of other tumors in recent years, to predict the clinical course of VSs. Specifically, we aimed to perform a comprehensive genetic analysis of sporadic VSs by integrating several methods to elucidate the etiology of each case and investigate correlations with clinical characteristics. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Patient Selection From June 2020 to March 2022, this study included 19 Japanese patients with sporadic VSs who consented to participate, out of a total of 26 patients who underwent surgery at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery or the Department of Neurosurgery at Keio University Hospital. Blood samples were collected from 12 patients, and tumor tissue samples were obtained from all patients during surgery. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Keio University School of Medicine (20190111, 20211018). Clinical symptoms, including preoperative hearing status and disequilibrium as reported by patients, as well as tumor characteristics, such as length (mm), volume (mm 3 3 27 28 2.2 Genetic Analysis Whole‐exome sequencing (WES) was performed on tumor tissue DNA from all patients. Resected specimens were promptly fixed with the PAXgene Tissue System (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and paraffin‐embedded after PAX fixation (PFPE). Tumor cellularity was estimated on hematoxylin and eosin‐stained PFPE sections, and only tumor‐rich regions (containing ≥ 50% tumor cells) were macro‐dissected for DNA extraction to minimize contamination by non‐neoplastic cells. Capture libraries targeting 19,396 exons were constructed and sequenced on the NovaSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA) with a mean on‐target coverage depth of ~300×. Somatic variants were called with the PleSSision‐Exome pipeline (Mitsubishi Space Software) and were considered positive when the variant allele frequency (VAF) was ≥ 4% and all pipeline quality filters were satisfied. Because sporadic VSs are not associated with germline NF2 variants, a tumor‐related gene panel analysis was also performed on peripheral blood leukocyte DNA from 12 patients to confirm the absence of germline variants. 2.3 Merlin Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry was performed on 5‐μm thick formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded tissue sections. NF2 1 FIGURE 1 Sporadic vestibular schwannoma with Merlin immunostaining (Merlin‐IHC). (a) Case 1 demonstrates loss of immunoreactivity. (b) Case 4 demonstrates retained immunoreactivity. 2.4 Methylation‐Specific PCR Methylation of the NF2 25 2.5 Multiple Ligation‐Dependent Probe Amplification To identify large deletions not detected by WES, multiple ligation‐dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed to measure the copy number of NF2 2.6 Real‐Time PCR qPCR Tumor‐derived mRNA was transcribed into cDNA via SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Monitoring was performed via Thunderbird Next SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Amplification and qPCR measurements were performed via the Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus system.

For Patient 4, two possibilities were considered: (1) the degree of methylation was mild and (2) a dominant‐negative effect, where the gene product of the altered allele inhibited the function of the normal allele's gene product, leading to tumorigenesis despite normal protein expression. In Patient 12, the missense mutation in one allele did not cause significant structural abnormalities, allowing Merlin expression, albeit with impaired function. The qPCR results indicated that the two cases with positive Merlin staining had relatively low ΔCt values, suggesting increased expression levels of NF2 NF2 NF2 Recent advances in next‐generation sequencing have enabled large‐scale molecular biological analyses, revealing a broad spectrum of genetic abnormalities in various tumors. In malignant tumor research, molecular biological analysis of surgically resected tumors is considered a method for predicting clinical outcomes (e.g., BRAF 38 39 This study suggests that the pathogenesis of sporadic VSs is driven by monoclonal factors involving NF2 NF2 NF2 40 41 NF2 42 43 44 S100B MCP‐3 This study had several limitations. One limitation is the small sample size, which may have resulted in inconsistencies compared with other studies. A post hoc power analysis suggested that approximately 64 patients would be required to achieve sufficient statistical power (80% at α 5 Conclusion A comprehensive genetic analysis of sporadic VSs revealed somatic changes in both NF2 NF2 Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
