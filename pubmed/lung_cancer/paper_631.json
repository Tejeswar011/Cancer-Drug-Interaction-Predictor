The ubiquitin-like SUMO proteins covalently modify substrates and their functional properties. Here we report that SAE1 regulates p53 signaling through its ability to SUMOylate p53 and dissect the upstream modifiers of SAE1. Basal SAE1 levels were elevated in NSCLC cells, especially lung adenocarcinoma A549 and squamous cell carcinoma PC-10 lines. To probe SAE1 function, we utilized lentiviral short hairpin RNAs to stably knock down SAE1 in A549 and PC-10 cells. Knockdown of SAE1 significantly impeded the immune invasion in NSCLC in vitro and in vivo and promoted cell cycle arrest of NSCLC cells in vitro. Mechanistically, SAE1 knockdown suppressed p53 nuclear export and SUMOylation, while zinc finger protein 184 (ZNF184) with abnormally reduced methylation in NSCLC increased SAE1 transcription. Notably, the silencing of p53 rescued the immune evasion impeded by SAE1 knockdown, and SAE1 overexpression also rescued the antitumor benefits of sh-ZNF184. Overall, this study elucidates that abnormally reduced methylation of ZNF184 mediates transcriptional activation of SAE1 and impedes p53 expression through SUMOylation, thereby governing cell cycle arrest and promoting immune evasion in the NSCLC progression.

A549 cells were seeded and cultured in Ham’s F-12 K containing 10% FBS + 1% penicillin/streptomycin, PC-9 in RPMI-1640 medium, and HBE135-E6E7, HCC-1588, PC-10, and LLC cells in DMEM, which were maintained in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 A549, PC-10, HCC-1588, and LLC cells were infected using lentiviruses of short hairpin RNA (sh)-SAE1, sh-ZNF184, oe-SAE1, sh-p53, sh-negative control (NC), or oe-NC. All lentiviruses were from OriGene (Beijing, China). The stable cells were finally screened using 2.5 µg/mL puromycin for subsequent experiments. A549 and PC-10 cells were treated with 6 µM DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Azacytidine (5-aza) (99.91%, HY-10586, MedChemExpress, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) or the control DMSO in a cell growth medium for 4 h. RT-qPCR Total RNA from the cells was extracted using TRIzol reagent (15596026CN, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (18091050, Invitrogen). RT-qPCR was performed on a TurboQ Real-Time Quantitative Gene Amplifier (Blue-Ray Biotech Corp., Taiwan, China) using the One Step PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (RR064B, Takara Bio Inc., Tokyo, Japan) with GAPDH as a reference gene.

After the denatured proteins were cooled to room temperature, the protein samples were loaded into the SDS-PAGE gel wells and transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immediately after the membrane transfer, the protein membrane was rinsed with Western wash buffer (10X) (P0023C3, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 2 min and sealed with bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight at 4 °C. The WB assay was performed using the primary antibodies to ZNF184 (1:1000, MBS9400600, MyBioSource, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), SAE1 (1:2000, GTX113602, GeneTex, Inc., Alton Pkwy Irvine, CA, USA), p53 (1:1000, GTX638291, GeneTex), Perforin (1:1000, ab256453, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), and Granzyme B (GzmB) (1:1000, ab134933, Abcam) at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, a secondary antibody: goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) (1:20000, ab6721, Abcam) was added and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate (34580, Thermo Scientific) was used, followed by exposure imaging and recording. Anti-GAPDH (1:1000, ab9485, Abcam) served as a loading control. Co-culture of NSCLC cells with PBMCs Human PBMCs (932027, NovoBiotechnology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium and activated for 1 week with Dynabeads Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 for T Cell Expansion and Activation (11161D, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) [ 16 4 ELISA The levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α in the supernatant of the co-culture system were measured using the Human IFN-γ High Sensitivity ELISA Kit (ab236895, Abcam) and the Human TNF-α ELISA Kit (ab100654, Abcam). Nucleoplasmic separation and WB assay A549 and PC-10 cells were lysed using NE-PER Nucleus and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent (78833, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The lysates were centrifuged at the highest speed for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was harvested as the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in cytosolic extraction buffer, vortexed vigorously for 15 s, and incubated on ice for 1 min. This step was repeated four times. The extracted cytoplasm and nuclei were incubated with anti-p53 antibody (1:1000, ab32049, Abcam) overnight at 4 °C and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) (1:20,000, ab6721, Abcam) for 2 h at room temperature. SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate was added, and the signal was detected by exposure imaging and recording. Anti-histone H3 antibody (1:5000, ab1791, Abcam) was used as an internal reference for the nuclear fraction, while the anti-GAPDH antibody (1:1000, ab9485, Abcam) was used for the cytoplasm. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay The coding sequence of SAE1 was first inserted into the pGEX4T-1(YH004, FungHui Bio, Changsha, Hunan, China) plasmid containing a GST tag, and the GST-SAE1 protein was subsequently expressed. The GST pull-down assay was performed using the Pierce GST Protein Interaction Pull-Down Kit (21516, Thermo Scientific). The recombinant protein of GST-SAE1, GST protein, was coupled with agarose microbeads in the kit, followed by co-incubation with cell lysates from A549 and PC-10 cells (another 5% lysate sample was taken as Input). After the incubation, the non-specific binding proteins were removed, and elution was performed using 2 × SDS loading buffer solution, followed by WB analysis. Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and in vitro SUMOylation assay We purchased the wild-type (WT) Flag-p53 plasmid with SUMOylation-deficient Flag-p53 K320R mutant plasmid from VectorBuilder (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) and used Lipofectamine 3000 Transfection Reagent (L3000015, Invitrogen) to transfect A549 and PC-10 cells with sh-NC or sh-SAE1. The cells were lysed, and the lysates were incubated overnight with Flag antibody (1:50, 2368, Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA, USA) to form antigen-antibody complexes, which were then captured by recombinant protein G-agarose 4B (101242, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The beads were mixed with p53 protein and centrifuged to separate the immunoprecipitated complexes. The complexes were rinsed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, 0.5% dithiothreitol). To examine the level of SUMO modification of p53 by SAE1, WB analysis was performed on the immunoprecipitated complexes. The following protein-specific primary antibodies were used: SUMO2/3 antibody (1:50,000, ab109005, Abcam), SAE1 antibody (1:25,000, ab185552, Abcam), and Flag antibody (1:1000, 2368, Cell Signaling Technologies). The membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies and for 1 h at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) (1:20,000, ab6721, Abcam) as the secondary antibody. SuperSignal West Pico PLUS chemiluminescent substrate was used for signal detection and exposure imaging. Cell cycle assay Cell Cycle Assay Kit (E-CK-A351, Elabscience, Houston, USA) was used to assess the cell cycle. Approximately 5 × 10 5 g g g Clonogenic assay Pre-cultured A549, PC-10, and HCC-1588 cells in the logarithmic growth phase were first digested with 0.25% trypsin and blown into single cells. Then, differently treated cells were seeded separately in pre-warmed Petri dishes at 37 °C in a gradient density of 200 cells per dish, and the cells were slightly shaken to disperse evenly to avoid adhesion. The culture was terminated when clones were visible to the naked eye in the Petri dishes. The upper layer of clear Liquid was removed, and the cells were carefully rinsed with PBS 2 times and treated with 5 mL 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After treatment with 1 mL crystal violet staining solution for 20 min, the cells were dried, then observed and recorded under the microscope. Scratch assay NSCLC cells were prepared into a single-cell suspension using 0.25% trypsin, seeded into 12-well culture plates, and cultured to 100% confluence. The cell layer was scraped with a 1 mm pipette tip. After the addition of 1.5 mL fresh medium, the cells were imaged at 0 h using a microscope and again under a microscope after 24 h of incubation. Transwell assay NSCLC cells were suspended in an FBS-free medium and loaded in the upper chamber of Transwell plates, with 0.5 mL of complete medium added to the basolateral wells. The inserts were carefully removed after 24 h of incubation. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 1% crystal violet. After washing with PBS, cells in the chambers were gently removed, and the number of cells on the outer surface of the inserts was counted and imaged under a microscope. Apoptosis assay TUNEL assays were performed using the CoraLite 594 TUNEL Apoptosis Detection Kit (Red Fluorescent) (PF00009, ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL, USA). NSCLC cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min, followed by the addition of 50 µL of mixed TUNEL reaction solution containing 2 µL of TdT enzyme and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in the dark. The cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark with 2 µg/mL DAPI. Finally, the red fluorescent cells were observed by a fluorescence microscope. Animal models This in vivo study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Harbin Medical University. Female C57BL/6 N mice (4–5 weeks old, 213, Vital River, Beijing, China) were housed in pathogen-free conditions. A total of 1 × 10 6 3 2 Flow cytometry Flow cytometry was applied to detect T cell activation in the co-culture system of NSCLC cells and PBMCs. The co-cultured PBMC were washed with a staining solution for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and stained with allophycocyanin (APC)-CD3 monoclonal antibody (17-0038-42, Invitrogen, San Diego, USA) and PE-CD8a monoclonal antibody (12-0088-42, Invitrogen) on ice in the dark for 1 h. The cells were resuspended in PBS solution containing 5% BSA and 2 nM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and then analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). For mouse tumor samples, the tumor tissue was first ground, filtered, and processed into a single-cell suspension. Samples were sealed with CD16/CD32 antibody (45-0161-82, Invitrogen), and dead cells were excluded using the LIVE/DEAD Fixable Blue Dead Cell Stain Kit, for UV excitation ( L34961 + Immunohistochemical staining Tumors and paired paracancerous tissues from NSCLC patients were incubated with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide after deparaffinization. Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer. After being sealed with 5% goat serum, the sections were incubated with anti-SAE1 (1:500, GTX113602, GeneTex) overnight at 4℃, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000, ab6721, Abcam). As chromogenic substrate, diaminobenzidine (P0203, Beyotime) was used, and the stained sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin (C0107, Beyotime). The images were captured by microscopic observation and analyzed for the percentage of SAE1-positive cells using Image J software.

After 16 h, cells were co-transfected with 100 ng of pGL3 Basic Vector (212936, Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA) inserted with the full-length fragment of the SAE1 promoter using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher) with 10 ng of pRL Renilla Luciferase Control Reporter Vectors (E2231, Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). After 48 h of transfection, luciferase activity was detected using Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay Kit (11401ES60, Yeasen Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Relative activity was assessed using the ratio of the firefly luciferase signal to the Renilla luciferase signal. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) The MeDIP kit (55009, Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used. Genomic DNA was first extracted from tumor and paracancerous tissues of NSCLC patients using the QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (56304, Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). DNA fragments (300–500 bp) were obtained after sonication. Before antibody addition, 10% of the sample was collected for the input sample. Immunoprecipitation was performed using the 5-mC mouse monoclonal antibody, the Bridging antibody, Mouse IgG, and protein G magnetic beads in the kit. Methylated DNA was extracted and analyzed by qPCR using the primer sequences of the ZNF184 promoter region (chr6: 27472968–27473317) (Left: 5’-ACCTCTTTCCACGCCTACAA-3’; Right: 5’-AAAAGACTGGCGGCGAAAAT-3’). qMSP Genomic DNA was extracted from tumor tissues and paracancerous tissues of NSCLC patients, A549, and PC-10 cells as described above. Purified DNA was exposed to sulfite using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (59104, Qiagen). The qMSP assay was performed using a TurboQ real-time quantitative gene amplifier. Amplified PCR products were separated by 3% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized with GelRed nucleic acid stain (SCT123, Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). Statistics GraphPad Prism 10.4.2 software was used for analysis. Measurement data were expressed as mean ± SD. Student’s t-test was used to determine the significance of differences between two groups, and comparisons among multiple groups were performed using analysis of ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, * p p Results SAE1 is significantly overexpressed in LUAD and LUSC We analyzed the expression of key factors involved in SUMOylation, including SENPs (SENP1, SENP2, SENP3, SENP5, SENP6, and SENP7), SAE1, UBA2, UBC9, and SUMOs (SUMO1, SUMO2, and SUMO3), in LUAD and LUSC using the UALCAN database ( https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/ 1 17 18 19 9  Fig. 1 SAE1 is significantly highly expressed in NSCLC.

A B C D n E n F G H p To determine that ZNF184 DNA was regulated by hypermethylation in NSCLC, we first collected tumor tissues from NSCLC patients as well as paired paracancerous tissues. The methylation level of the ZNF184 promoter in NSCLC tumor tissues was lower than that in paracancerous tissues by 5-mC antibody-mediated MeDIP assay (Fig. 10 10 We also treated A549 and PC-10 cells with the general DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza. As revealed by qMSP (Fig. 10 10 10 Discussion It was concluded from our data that the transcription factor ZNF184 upregulated SAE1 expression to catalyze the SUMOylation of p53, thus promoting NSCLC cell proliferative, migrating, and invasive properties and accelerating cell evasion from CD8 + 11  Fig. 11 Hypothetical model. Abnormal reduction of DNA methylation leads to upregulation of ZNF184 expression, which further mediates SAE1 transcriptional activation and thus enhances p53 nuclear export, leading to progression of NSCLC through inhibition of antitumor function of CD8 + Using comprehensive bioinformatic analyses of publicly available datasets from UALCAN and Kaplan-Meier Plotter, we discovered that SAE1 is markedly overexpressed in LUAD and LUSC compared to normal tissues. Strikingly, high SAE1 expression strongly correlated with worse OS, FP survival, and PPS in NSCLC patients. Consistently, SAE1 is highly expressed and associated with poor OS in patients with multiple myeloma [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 Our study also elucidates how SAE1 contributes to immune evasion, a major mechanism of therapeutic resistance in NSCLC.

First, despite the constrained sample size, the findings are encouraging and necessitate additional validation in a more substantial clinical cohort to substantiate the clinical relevance of SAE1 as a biomarker in NSCLC. Additionally, the significance of multivariate modeling is fully acknowledged, and the implementation of comprehensive Cox regression is planned for a larger, prospectively collected cohort. Conclusion In conclusion, this study provides novel evidence that SAE1 overexpression, induced by hypomethylation of ZNF184, drives NSCLC cell immune evasion through dysregulating SUMOylation-dependent p53 signaling. Targeting this pathway may offer new therapeutic opportunities to reverse immune suppression and enhance immunotherapy responses in NSCLC patients.
