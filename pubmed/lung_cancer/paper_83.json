Its aberrant expression or activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several diseases, particularly cancer. Early detection allows for the development and application of targeted therapies that can inhibit PEAK1 activity, potentially improving treatment outcomes.

Introduce Pseudopodium-enriched atypical kinase 1 (PEAK1) is an atypical kinase that plays a broad role in biological processes such as cellular signaling, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell migration. 1,2 2 3 4,5 4 6 7 In mRNA research, PEAK1 mRNA refers to the messenger RNA that encodes the PEAK1 protein. 8 9 10 11 12,13 14 12 Recent advances in nanomaterial-based electrochemical biosensors have further expanded the detection capabilities for nucleic acids. For instance, Zhang et al. 3 4 2 3 15 et al. 16 et al. 14 15,17,18 To enable direct detection of mRNA, we introduced CRISPR–Cas13. Cas13a is an RNA-targeting enzyme that utilizes specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to guide the recognition and cleavage of complementary RNA sequences. 19 20 21,22 20,23 24–26 In this study, by integrating CRISPR–Cas13 with an electrochemical biosensor, we leverage the strengths of both technologies to achieve highly sensitive, specific, and portable RNA detection. The electrochemical transduction mechanism relies on the modulation of electron transfer efficiency at the electrode interface. Specifically, the hairpin-structured ReRNA reporter is terminally labeled with methylene blue (MB), a redox-active molecule that generates a measurable current signal through differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). Upon Cas13a activation, the collateral cleavage of ReRNA results in the detachment of MB from the electrode surface, leading to a quantifiable decrease in the redox current. This signal-off mechanism is highly sensitive to the conformational changes of surface-immobilized RNA probes, as demonstrated by the significant signal enhancement observed with hairpin-structured reporters compared to linear RNA analogs ( Fig. 3A and B via 27 28 29 2. Experiment section 2.1 Materials and reagents Normal intestinal epithelial cells (NCM460) and colorectal cancer cells (DLD-1) were obtained from Prof. Chaoxia Zhou at department of biochemistry and molecular biology, Harbin Medical University (HMU). The DMEM culture medium required for cell culture was obtained from Thermo Fisher-Gibco™, fetal bovine serum was obtained from Clark Bioscience (Virginia, United States), and penicillin/streptomycin was obtained from Beyotime (Shanghai, China). Cas13a and 10× NEBuffer were obtained from Novoprotein (Suzhou, China). HPLC-purified crRNAs, RNase inhibitors, and RNA Markers were obtained from Sangon Biotech Co, Ltd (Shanghai, China). RNase-free water was obtained from Solarbio Science (Beijing, China). 6-Mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH), tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), and polyethylene glycol sorbitan monolaurate (Tween-20) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). All RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified from Sangon Biotech Co, Ltd (Shanghai, China). All chemicals were used without any further purification and were prepared by dilution with ultrapure water. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were carried out at room temperature (25 °C). 2.2 Instrumentation Electrochemical measurements were conducted using the CHI660E electrochemical workstation from Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co, Ltd. The gel electrophoresis experiment was conducted with DYY-10C electrophoresis apparatus (China Liuyi Instrument Company). Imaging using Azure c300 chemiluminescence imaging system from Azure Biosystems. Atomic force microscopy (Suzhou Feishman Precision Instrument Company) is used to characterize AuNPs on electrode surfaces. 2.3 Configuration probe The synthesized ReRNA-MB was delivered in lyophilized powder form. Upon receipt, the sample was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 1 minute, followed by the addition of an appropriate volume of DEPC-treated water to achieve the desired concentration. The solution was then thoroughly mixed using a vortex mixer and briefly centrifuged. After allowing it to stand at 4 °C for 16 hours, the prepared ReDNA-MB was stored at 4 °C for short-term frequent use or at −20 °C for long-term storage. For further preparation, 5 μL of 1 mmol L −1 −1 2.4 Preparation of the ReRNA-Modified biosensing electrode Electrochemical measurements were performed using a CHI660E electrochemical analyzer and a three-electrode system, with a platinum wire as the counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and a gold electrode as the working electrode. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) at −0.2–0.6 V was obtained in a 0.5 mM [Fe(CN) 6 3−/4− The bare GE was freshly polished by using 0.05 μm alumina powder to obtain mirror-like smoothness followed by sonicating with ethanol and deionized water in an ultrasonic bath. The electrode was then immersed into piranha solution (H 2 4 2 2 4 2.5 Cell culture and RNA extraction (1) After discarding the culture medium, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then digested with 1 mL of trypsin for 3 minutes. The suspension status of the cells was observed under a microscope. Subsequently, 2 mL of culture medium was added to resuspend the cells, and the mixture was transferred to a 15 mL centrifuge tube, followed by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 5 minutes. Finally, the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in 2 mL of fresh culture medium before being transferred to a new culture flask. (2) After discarding the culture medium, 1 mL of PBS was added to each well for washing. This washing step was repeated twice, followed by the addition of 1 mL of Trizol to each well for homogenization. The mixture was then transferred to a 1.5 mL EP tube and allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes. Subsequently, 200 μL of chloroform was added to each tube, vortexed until the solution turned pink, and left to stand for another 5 minutes. The samples were then centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 400 μL of the clear supernatant was carefully transferred to a new EP tube, mixed with 400 μL of isopropanol by gentle inversion, and allowed to stand for 10 minutes before being centrifuged for another 10 minutes. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed twice with 1 mL of 75% ethanol, followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes each time. After air-drying to remove residual ethanol, the RNA pellet was finally dissolved in RNase-free water. 2.6 Target RNA detection protocol Before the testing, the modified biosensing platform was further rinsed with the washing buffer. Subsequently, the Cas13a-mediated cleavage assay was carried out by adding 10 μL of mixture solution (1 μL 50 nM Cas13a, 1 μL 1 μM crRNA,2 μL 10× NEBuffer, and 1 μL of target RNA) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Afterward, the solution was dropped onto the biosensor surface and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and washed with the washing buffer. The electrochemical differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) measurements were performed in 4 mL of 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 M NaCl and 5 mM MgCl 2 2.7 Gel electrophoresis analysis Prepare a 3% agarose gel to verify the ssRNA enzyme activity of Cas13a. Perform electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer (2 mM EDTA and 89 mM Tris-borate, pH 8.3) at a constant voltage of 100 V for 30 minutes. Finally, visualize the gel using a gel imaging system. 3.
