Treatment remains challenging, considering the multifactorial nature of the condition and the limited high-quality evidence supporting pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions. Objectives: This review aimed to critically appraise level I evidence from randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for adolescents with JFM. Methods: Seven published peer-reviewed clinical trials were examined, including studies investigating duloxetine, milnacipran, pregabalin, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), and the integrated Fibromyalgia Integrative Training Teens (FIT) program, which combines CBT with neuromuscular training. Outcomes of interest included pain intensity, functional disability, depression symptoms, physical activity, and adverse events. Results: Pharmacological agents such as duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin demonstrated modest improvements in pain, but failed to produce consistent benefits in function or mood, and were associated with a high incidence of adverse effects. CBT significantly improved functional disability and depression symptoms, yet it had a limited impact on pain reduction or objectively measured activity levels. The FIT Teens program showed superior outcomes in pain intensity and biomechanical function compared to CBT alone, suggesting a synergistic effect of combining psychological and physical reconditioning strategies. Conclusions: Current evidence supports the use of multimodal treatment approaches in JFM. Non-pharmacological interventions, particularly when integrated with structured exercise, offer meaningful benefits with minimal safety concerns. Larger, methodologically rigorous trials are needed to establish optimal treatment pathways and long-term outcomes for this complex and underserved paediatric population. multidisciplinary care chronic pain mood disorders functional impairment adolescent health treatment outcomes cognitive behavioural therapy This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Juvenile fibromyalgia (JFM) is a chronic pain syndrome that affects up to 6% of school-aged children and adolescents, with the most common age of onset between 11 and 15 years [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 4 11 12 13 11 14 3 15 7 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 This systematic review evaluated the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological management in JFM. The outcomes of interest were patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), the rate of adverse events, and the rate of adolescents who discontinued the treatment regimen. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Eligibility Criteria All the RCTs comparing the efficacy of pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of JFM were accessed. According to the author’s language capabilities, articles written in English, German, Italian, French, and Spanish were eligible for consideration. According to the Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine [ 37 2.2. Search Strategy This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses: the 2020 PRISMA statement [ 38 P (Population): JFM; I (Intervention): Pharmacological and non-pharmacological management; C (Comparator): Not applicable; O (Outcome): PROMs, adverse events and therapy discontinuation. T (Timing): minimum 8 weeks of follow-up D (Design): RCT. In January 2025, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were accessed with no time constraint. The keywords used for the search using the Boolean operators AND/OR are reported in Table 1 2.3. Selection and Data Collection Two authors (T.B. and F.S.) independently performed the database search. All the resulting titles were screened by hand, and the abstract was accessed if suitable. The full text of the abstracts that matched the topic of interest was accessed. If the full text was not accessible or available, the article was excluded from consideration. A cross-reference of the bibliography of the full-text articles was also performed for inclusion. Disagreements were debated and mutually solved by the authors. A third senior author (N.M.) made the final decision in case of further disagreement. 2.4. Data Items Two authors (T.B. and F.S.) independently performed data extraction. The baseline data were extracted, including author, year of publication, journal, length of follow-up, number of women, number of patients, and their related mean age. Data concerning the following PROMs were collected at baseline and at last follow-up: Children’s Depression Inventory (CDI) [ 39 40 2.5. Assessment of the Risk of Bias and Quality of the Recommendations The risk of bias was assessed according to the guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [ 41 2.6. Synthesis Methods The main author (F.M.) performed the statistical analyses following the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [ 42 3. Results 3.1. Study Selection The literature search identified 166 articles. Of them, 47 were duplicates and, therefore, excluded. An additional 108 studies were excluded: study design ( N N N N N Figure 1 3.2. Risk of Bias Assessment Given the appropriate randomisation sequence generation and the balanced allocation concealment, the risk of selection bias was low. In four of the included studies, a double-blinded phase was followed by an open-label phase. Patients were not blinded in most of the included studies, and blinding of assessors was often performed, leading to a moderate to high risk of performance bias and a low to moderate detection bias. The overall risk of attrition and reporting bias was low to moderate, as was the risk of other biases. Concluding, the risk of bias graph evidenced a good quality of the methodological assessment ( Figure 2 3.3. Study Characteristics and Results of Individual Studies Data from 849 patients were included for analysis. The mean length of follow-up was 12.8 ± 5.2 weeks. The mean age was 15.2 ± 0.4 years.

Results Syntheses In adolescents with juvenile fibromyalgia, pharmacological management has not shown consistent primary analgesic benefits, whereas psychological and neuromuscular approaches have yielded clearer functional gains ( Table 3 29 30 36 32 33 34 35 31 4. Discussion 4.1. Pathophysiology and Treatment Challenges in Juvenile Fibromyalgia JFM is a chronic and debilitating condition characterised by diffuse musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood symptoms, primarily affecting adolescent females [ 11 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 19 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 3 11 16 49 50 51 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 4.2. Pharmacological Therapies: Efficacy and Limitations The pharmacological management of JFM remains a matter of debate, with available evidence offering limited support for its standalone use in adolescents [ 27 14 97 99 100 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 36 29 114 P 30 4.3. Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy and Psychological Management CBT has emerged as one of the most commonly studied non-pharmacological treatments for JFM, with multiple trials supporting its efficacy in improving functional outcomes and emotional well-being [ 101 102 103 104 28 33 33 34 4.4. Multimodal Approaches: The Role of FIT Teens The persistent limitations of pharmacological and psychological monotherapies in JFM have prompted a growing interest in integrative models of care. One of the most promising innovations in this field is the FIT Teens programme, which combines cognitive-behavioural therapy with a structured neuromuscular exercise regimen [ 31 35 46 87 115 46 16 35 35 31 4.5. Functional Outcomes and Physical Activity Engagement Functional impairment is a core component of JFM, with significant limitations reported in school attendance, physical activity, and participation in daily life [ 116 34 117 118 4.6. Safety Considerations and Adverse Events In the management of JFM, safety and tolerability are of particular concern, especially given the chronicity of the condition, the young age of patients, and the complexity of pharmacological interventions. Adverse events (AEs), treatment-emergent side effects, and psychological risks must be carefully weighed when considering therapeutic options, particularly pharmacological agents that act on central pain processing mechanisms. Among the pharmacological treatments evaluated in adolescents with JFM, duloxetine has raised specific concerns. In a RCT, although duloxetine resulted in a higher proportion of patients achieving a clinically relevant reduction in pain (≥30% and ≥50%), a significantly higher rate of treatment-emergent AEs compared to placebo (82.4% vs. 62.4%, p 36 29 30 31 33 35 4.7. Study Limitations and Methodological Heterogeneity Several methodological shortcomings and a high degree of heterogeneity across studies limit the current evidence on the treatment of JFM. Although the Cochrane risk of bias tool indicated an overall acceptable methodological quality, moderate concerns regarding blinding and attrition should be acknowledged. These issues may have inflated placebo responses or led to incomplete outcome reporting, thereby reducing the certainty of the evidence and highlighting the need for more rigorous trial designs in this field. These limitations must be carefully considered when interpreting the findings and applying them to clinical practice. Of the seven studies included in the present review, three were conducted by the same research group, which may increase the risk of bias. The sample sizes in most RCTs remain modest, particularly in the pharmacological studies. For example, the milnacipran trial was terminated early from poor recruitment, failing to complete the double-blind withdrawal phase, and precluding statistical analysis of the primary endpoint. Similarly, the pregabalin trial enrolled 107 participants; while larger than previous efforts, the trial may have lacked sufficient power to detect small to moderate treatment effects on the primary outcome. The relatively small sample sizes increase the risk of type II error and limit the ability to conduct subgroup analyses or assess treatment moderators. There is significant variability in trial designs, including differences in inclusion criteria, diagnostic frameworks, outcome measures, and follow-up durations. Some studies used the Yunus and Masi criteria for JFM [ 30 32 33 34 36 29 31 35 119 120 4.8. Future Directions Future research on the management of JFM should prioritise large-scale, multicentre trials with harmonised diagnostic criteria and standardised outcome measures. Longer follow-up periods are crucial for evaluating the durability of treatment effects, particularly in relation to functional restoration and engagement in physical activity. There is a clear need for head-to-head comparisons of pharmacological agents and combined approaches such as FIT Teens, as well as mechanistic studies exploring the role of central sensitisation, biomechanics, and fear of movement. Moreover, the potential use of novel agents such as low-dose naltrexone for the treatment of juvenile fibromyalgia should be investigated. Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist, which, if administered in low doses, produces a decrease in pain level in patients with fibromyalgia [ 27 5. Conclusions JFM is a definite clinical challenge, both in terms of diagnosis and management. Pharmacological treatments such as duloxetine, pregabalin, and milnacipran have been studied in adolescents, but their overall benefit remains modest and often limited to pain reduction, with inconsistent effects on function and mood. On the other hand, non-pharmacological interventions, particularly cognitive-behavioural therapy, appear more effective in improving functional outcomes and emotional well-being, although their impact on pain is less clear. Emerging integrative models, such as the FIT Teens programme, offer a promising direction by combining psychological support with targeted physical training. Despite these developments, the available evidence remains scarce, and high-quality, long-term studies are urgently needed. Future research should aim to clarify the most effective combinations of treatment components and define individualised pathways for this underserved patient population.

Author, Year Treatment Outcome of Interest Main Results Arnold et al., 2015 [ 29 Milnacipran (50 to 100 mg/daily) Pain, PGIS, PedsQL: Generic Core Scales, Multidimensional Fatigue Scale, MASC, CDI, AEs, vital signs (blood pressure, Heart rate) body weight, electrocardiograms, and laboratory tests, LTR Mean improvements in pain, global disease severity, quality of life, and fatigue symptoms at the end of both open-label periods. Nausea, headache, vomiting, and dizziness as most common reported adverse events. Mean increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Arnold et al., 2016 [ 30 Pregabalin (75 to 450 mg/daily) vs. placebo primary efficacy outcome: change in mean pain score based on the subject’s daily pain diaries (NRS). Secondary efficacy outcomes: mean pain score at each week, from daily pain diaries with a 24-h recall period; the change in mean pain score at week 15 with a 1-week re- call period; PGIC, change in sleep quality score at endpoint and at each week, parent GIC, FIQ-C. Not significant improvement in mean pain score at endpoint. Significant improvements with pregabalin versus placebo in secondary outcomes of change in pain score by week and patient global impression of change. No significant improvement in other secondary outcomes measuring pain, sleep, and FM impact. Safety in line with pregabalin’ known profile in adults Black et al., 2021 [ 31 CBT vs. FIT Teens Isokinetic hip and knee strength, dynamic postural stability, and 3-D motional analysis of functional tasks conducted on a standardized drop vertical jump task. Improvements in hip abduction strength and greater external hip rotation in the FIT Teens group. Decreased hip adduction in the FIT Teens group. Hengartner et al., 2021 [ 32 Duloxetine (30 to 60 mg/daily) vs. placebo Severe treatment-emergent psychiatric adverse event including all AE related to suicidality and other psychiatric disorders, treatment discontinuation due psychiatric adverse event Significant treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and behaviour with duloxetine. The incidence of severe treatment-emergent psychiatric adverse events significantly higher in duloxetine group. Kashikar-Zuck et al., 2012 [ 33 CBT Primary outcome: FDI. Secondary outcomes: CDI, VAS, tender point sensitivity, physician’s global assessment on a 0–10-cm VAS, HRQOL using the PedsQL Generic Core Scales and PedsQL Rheumatology Module, sleep quality. AEs. CBT was superior to FM education in reducing the primary outcome of functional disability. Depression symptoms reduction was significant for both groups. Reduction in pain was not significant in either group Kashikar-Zuck et al., 2013 [ 34 CBT vs. Education Actigraphy, FDI, CDI Self-reported functioning improved in the CBT group but no significant changes were seen in either group for activity counts, sedentary, moderate, or vigorous activity. The CBT showed lower peak and light activity. Kashikar-Zuck et al., 2018 [ 35 CBT vs. FIT Teens Primary outcomes: VAS, FDI. Secondary outcomes: CDI, TSK-11, PCS-C; 40, Aes FIT Teens group had significantly greater decreases in pain. FIT Teens reported significant improvements in disability, but did not differ from CBT at the 3-month Upadhyaya et al., 2019 [ 36 Duloxetine (30 to 60 mg/daily) vs. placebo Primary outcome: mean change in 24-h average pain severity of BPI. Secondary outcomes: BPI-modified short form: adolescent version severity and interference scores, PPQ (pain right now, worst pain, and average pain items), CGI-severity: overall, CGI-severity: mental illness, FDI-child, FDI-parent, CDI, Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, treatment response (≥30%, ≥50% reductions on BPI average pain severity), AEs, laboratory values, height, weight, vital signs, and electrocardiograms. Change in BPI average pain severity was not different between duloxetine and placebo. Duloxetine was better in treatment response (≥30% and ≥50% reductions on BPI average pain severity) and improvement of the general activity and relationships items on the BPI interference subscale. Onset of treatment-emergent adverse event more frequent in the duloxetine group ",
