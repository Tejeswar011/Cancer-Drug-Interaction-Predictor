All PLCs cleave phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP 2 3 3 2+ 1 2 3 PLCε is activated downstream of G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) through binding of the Rap1A, RhoA, and Ras GTPases, as well as the Gβγ heterodimer. Activation likely proceeds through simultaneous membrane localization and activation, with the G protein dictating the location of activation 2 4 s 12/13 2+ 2+ 5 6 7 11 10 12 12/13 2 3 2 2+ 13 17 The ability of PLCε to hydrolyze substrates at different intracellular sites is due to its subfamily-specific regulatory domains and insertions. Like other PLCs, PLCε contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, four EF hand repeats (EF1-4), the catalytic TIM barrel, and a C2 domain (Fig. 1a 3 18 3 19 20 3 21 22 23 Fig. 1 The PLCε EF1/2 hands and Y-box are required for maximum RhoA-dependent activity. a R. norvegicus b G14V- p p p p p G14V p p p RhoA is the most robust activator of PLCε, increasing its activity ~5-10-fold over basal in cell-based assays 3 24 25 1a 23 26 In this work, we define the minimal structural requirements for RhoA-dependent activation of PLCε. Prenylated RhoA·GTP is required for maximum activation, but a soluble mutant also stimulates the lipase, demonstrating the mechanism likely involves both membrane localization and allosteric components. Informed by newly annotated PLCε domain boundaries, we show PLCε variants retaining the PH domain and EF hands 1/2 (EF1/2) are robustly activated by the GTPase, whereas variants that lack the Y-box, the N-terminus, CDC25, PH domain, and/or EF1/2 hands have decreased basal and RhoA-stimulated activities. Our cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction of a RhoA·GTP–PLCε complex reveals an integral role of the EF hands in the mechanism, with RhoA·GTP binding to a PLCε subfamily-specific insertion in this domain, ~60 Å away from the active site and Y-box in the TIM barrel. Mutation or deletion of the PLCε EF hand insertion compromises RhoA-dependent activation in cells. Comparison of the RhoA·GTP–PLCε reconstruction to other PLCε structures shows that RhoA binding induces conformational changes within the EF hands that likely contribute to allosteric activation. Results RhoA-dependent activation of PLCε requires EF hands ½ Previous studies investigating RhoA-dependent activation of PLCε used variants truncated at the N-terminus, removing all or parts of the CDC25 domain, PH domain, and EF1/2, based on sequence conservation, or the C-terminal RA domains 14 27 28 18 3 3 3 3 29 30 G14V 1a, b 23 31 G14V G14V 1a, b 1b Maximum RhoA-dependent activity of PLCε variants decreased progressively as its N-terminus was truncated. To confirm the role of the EF hands, particularly EF1/2, in RhoA activation of the holoenzyme, we generated a series of chimeras between PLCε and PLCβ3, which is not regulated by RhoA (Fig. 2a 2a 1 G14V 2b Fig. 2 PLCε/β3 chimeras confirm the EF hands are essential for RhoA-dependent activation. a b G14V t p p p p p Maximum activity requires prenylated RhoA For PLC enzymes regulated by G proteins, maximum lipase activation requires the G protein activators to be prenylated and/or acylated 3 32 G14V 33 34 G14V 2 RhoA·GTP binds to the PLCε E2α′ helix of the EF hands Cryo-EM single particle analysis (SPA) was used to determine the structure of RhoA·GTP bound to PLCε PH-C. This variant is activated by RhoA (Fig. 1a, b 18 30 35 18 1 2 36 3 5 1 Table 1 Cryo-EM data collection, refinement, and validation statistics EMDB: EMD-43927, EMD-43928 Data collection Grids Copper Quantifoil Vitrification method FEI Vitrobot Microscope FEI Titan Krios Magnification 81000 Voltage (kV) 300 Detector GATAN K3 (6k × 4k) Electron exposure (e − 2 57.8 Number of frames 40 Defocus range (mM) 0.6–2.0 Pixel Size (Å) 0.527 Data processing Number of micrographs 6378 Initial particle images (no.) 1,329,298 Final particle images (no.) 209,463 Symmetry C1 Map resolution (Å) 3.3 FSC threshold 0.143 Refinement Map sharpening B factor (Å 2 133.2 Map CC 0.80 Model composition Non-hydrogen atoms 8544 Protein residues 1065 Ligands 3 B factor (Å 2 Protein 20.13/162.65/57.21 Ligand 27.98/138.95/134.91 R.m.s. deviations Bond lengths (Å) 0.004 Bond angles (°) 0.924 Validation MolProbity score 1.60 Clashscore 6.17 Rotamer outliers (%) 1.05 CaBLAM outliers (%) 1.45 Ramachandran plot Favored (%) 96 Allowed (%) 4 Outliers (%) 0 In the RhoA·GTP–PLCε PH-C reconstruction, clear density is observed for the PH-RA1 domains (Fig. 3 19 30 18 35 Fig. 3 RhoA·GTP binds to the PLCε EF hands. a b 1a c a 2+ 2+ d e RhoA·GTP binds exclusively to the EF hands via its switch I and switch II, consistent with other RhoA–effector enzyme complexes (Fig. 3 6 36 38 7 18 39 3d 4 7 2 3d 4 3d 4 18 35 Fig. 4 The PLCε E2α′ helix is needed for RhoA-dependent activation. a b G14V t p p p p p p p c d t p p p p There are differences in the intramolecular interactions between the RhoA complex and the PLCε EF3-RA1 and Fab–PLCε PH-C structures 18 30 40 8 9 8 9 18 30 10 The PLCε E2α′ helix is required for RhoA·GTP-dependent activation We first tested whether the PLCε E2α′ helix and flanking loop are needed for RhoA-dependent activation (Fig. 4a, b 7 4a, b Q63E 11 20 41 G14V 12 Residues in PLCε that interact with RhoA·GTP in the structure were also mutated to test their role in activation (Fig. 4c 7 4c 4c 4c 4d 4d Discussion In this study, we provide the first molecular insights into the mechanism by which RhoA activates PLCε. Using cell-based assays, we show that the EF hands are critical for RhoA-dependent activation, whereas the Y-box, previously thought to be involved in the process, is needed for general lipase function. The role of the Y-box is not yet known, but because these variants are detected by Western blot at the correct molecular weight, the lack of activity seems unlikely to reflect a folding defect. To define the regions of the EF hands necessary for activation, we generated chimeras wherein the PLCε EF hands were replaced, in whole or in part, with those of PLCβ3. However, only a chimera containing the PLCβ3 EF1/2 subdomain could be activated by RhoA in cells (Figs. 1 2 3 4 11 PLCε must interact with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to hydrolyze its PIP 2 2 18 2 18 30 8 5 10 1a, b Fig. 5 Schematic for RhoA-mediated PLCε activation. Under basal conditions, PLCε is autoinhibited by the X–Y linker in the cytoplasm. RhoA is activated downstream of G 12/13 Whether other G protein activators of PLCε regulate lipase activity through similar mechanisms has yet to be determined. It seems that membrane localization will always be a key component because the autoinhibitory X–Y linker would need to be displaced via interfacial activation at the membrane 3 21 3 41 42 43 20 3 In the future, studies that integrate the role of the membrane in PLCε function are needed for a complete understanding of regulation. PLCε translocates to the cytoplasmic leaflets of the plasma and perinuclear membranes, hydrolyzing PIP 2 2 3 Methods Cloning of PLCε and variants A pCMV vector encoding R. norvegicus PLCε with a C-terminal FLAG tag (gift from A.V. Smrcka, U. Michigan) was used as a template to generate PLCε PH-C (residues 837–2282), EF-C (residues 1038–2282), and EF3-C (residues 1284–2282). The Y-box (residues 1667–1728) was deleted in PLCε and EF-C by Q5-site-directed mutagenesis (New England BioLabs, Inc.). In-Fusion cloning (Takara Bio USA, Inc.) was used to generate PLCε and PLCβ3 (in a pCI-neo vector, Promega) chimeras. For PLCε/β3 EF, PLCε residues 1038–1355 were replaced with PLCβ3 152–304, PLCε/β3 EF1/2 replaced PLCε residues 1038–1284 with residues 152–216 from PLCβ3, and PLCε/β3 EF3/4 replaced PLCε residues 1035–1355 with PLCβ3 residues 217–304. Internal deletions in the PLCε EF hands (Δ1275–1289, Δ1287–1298, and Δ1275–1298) and point mutants were generated with In-Fusion cloning (Takara Bio USA, Inc.). PLCε PH-C was subcloned into pFastBac HTA (ThermoFisher) for protein expression and purification 41 2 Table 2 Primers for generating PLCε and RhoA mutants Primer name Sequence 5′ to 3′ RhoA G14V TGTTGGTGATGTAGCCTGTGGAA RhoA G14V ATCACCAGTTTCTTCCGG EF-C Forward GAAGGCCCAACCTTGGCA EF-C Reverse CATCTTGACCAGGATCCG EF3-C Forward GCTGCTGCAAGCATTGTG EF3-C Reverse CATCTTGACCAGGATCCGCCC PLCΔY Forward AGAACTCCTAAATGCTATC PLCΔY Reverse TGAATTTAGAGTTGACAGG W1051E Reverse GTGCTCTCTCTCCTACCACCAAACAACTCC F1187E Forward CCAGAGCGAAATGGTCTCAGACAGTAACATGAG F1187E Reverse ACCATTTCGCTCTGGAAGCCTTTCATTCCTC V1189K Forward TTCATGGAATCAGACAGTAACATGAGTTTCATTG V1189K Forward GTCTGATTCCATGAAGCTCTGGAAGCC I1279E Forward GAGGCAGGAATCTGACGCCATTGCTGCTG I1279E Reverse TCAGATTCCTGCCTCTGGTTGTCAGAAAGC A1282K Forward ATCTGACAAAATTGCTGCTGCAAGCATTGTGA A1282K Reverse GCAATTTTGTCAGATATCTGCCTCTGGTTGTCA I1283E Forward TGACGCCGAAGCTGCTGCAAGCATTGTGAC I1283E Reverse GCAGCTTCGGCGTCAGATATCTGCCTCTGG A1286K Forward TGCTGCTAAAAGCATTGTGACTAATGGCACTGG A1286K Reverse ATGCTTTTAGCAGCAATGGCGTCAGATATCTGC I1295E Forward CACTGGGGAAGAAAGCACGTCCCTGGGC I1295E Reverse CTTTCTTCCCCAGTGCCATTAGTCACAATGC Δ1275–1289 Forward TTTCTGACACTAATGGCACTGGGATTGAAAGCA Δ1275–1289 Reverse CATTAGTGTCAGAAAGCTGCTGCTTACTCTTC Δ1287–1298 Forward CTGCTGCATCCCTGGGCATATTTGGGGTC Δ1287–1298 Reverse CCAGGGATGCAGCAGCAATGGCGTC Δ1275–1298 Forward TTTCTGACTCCCTGGGCATATTTGGGGT Δ1275–1298 Reverse CCAGGGAGTCAGAAAGCTGCTGCTTACTCTTC T977E Forward GCTTCAGGAAACCGACAATAGATTACTGCACTTCG T977E Reverse TCGGTTTCCTGAAGCCCATAGAGCAGCG F1012E Forward ACGGAAGGAACCTGACCAAAGACAACAGTGG F1012E Reverse TCAGGTTCCTTCCGTATCTTTCTCACAGC F1203E Forward CGAGCTGGAAAAATCATTCAGCATAAGGAGCCGC F1203E Reverse GATTTTTCCAGCTCGACGAATTCAATGAAAC F1206E Forward CAAATCAGAAAGCATAAGGAGCCGCAAG F1206E Reverse ATGCTTTCTGATTTGAACAGCTCGACG R1209E Forward CAGCATAGAGAGCCGCAAGGACTTGAAGG R1209E Reverse CGGCTCTCTATGCTGAATGATTTGAACAGCTCG Q1408E Forward TCTACAGCGAGGTCCTCTTGCAAGGATG Q1408E Reverse GGACCTCGCTGTAGAGCTCCACAGAGG L1460E Forward CTCCGACGAGCCAATCATCATATCCATTGAGAAC L1460E Reverse ATTGGCTCGTCGGAGGTGATGAAGGCAC PLCε ΔEF Forward AAGGCCCAATGGATAAAGACAATTTCGCCTC PLCε ΔEF Reverse TATCCATTGGGCCTTCATACCGACC PLCε/β3 EF Forward linearize: ATGGATAAAGACAATTTCGCCTC PLCβ3 insert: CGGTATGAAGGCCCATTCCTGCGCAAAGCATACACG PLCε/β3 EF Reverse linearize: TGGGCCTTCATACCGACC PLCβ3 insert: ATTGTCTTTATCCATCTCCTCGCCTCCCAGGTAGC PLCε/β3 EF1/2 Forward linearize: ATGGATAAAGACAATTTCGCCTC PLCε insert: ATCTTTGAGCGGTTCGCTGCAAGCATTGTGACTAATGG PLCε/β3 EF1/2 Reverse linearize: GAACCGCTCAAAGATTTCCAAGG PLCε insert: ATTGTCTTTATCCATCAGAAACCTTGCAAACCCT PLCε/β3 EF3/4 Forward linearize: CTGAACAAGCTGTGTCTGCGG PLCε insert: CGGTATGAAGGCCCAACCTTGGCACATGCTGTGG PLCε/β3 EF3/4 Reverse linearize: TGGGCCTTCATACCGACC PLCε insert: ACACAGCTTGTTCAGAGCAATGGCGTCAGATATCTGCC PLCβ3/ε EF2 Forward linearize: CTGCGGCCGGACATTGAC PLCε insert: ATGTTCTCAGCAGACTTCATTGAATTCGTCGAGCTGT PLCβ3/ε EF2 Reverse linearize: GTCTGCTGAGAACATCTTCAGG PLCε insert: AATGTCCGGCCGCAGCACAATGCTTGCAGCAGCA PLCβ3/ε E2α’ Forward linearize: CTGCGGCCGGACATTGAC PLCε insert: CTGAACAAGCTGTGTCTTTCTGACAACCAGAGGCAGA PLCβ3/ε E2α’ Reverse linearize: ACACAGCTTGTTCAGGAACCG PLCε insert: AATGTCCGGCCGCAGTTCAATCCCAGTGCCATTAGTCACA Expression and purification of PLCε variants R. norvegicus Spodoptera frugiperda g Cloning of RhoA variants The cDNA encoding wild-type human RhoA (residues 1–194, gift from J.J.G.
