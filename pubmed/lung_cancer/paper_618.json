Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and two human B cell lymphoproliferative diseases. KSHV-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) is expressed in KSHV-infected cancer cells. Thus, LANA is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention for KSHV-associated diseases. Here, we devised a cancer gene therapy vector using the adeno-associated virus (AAV), which capitalizes on the LANA’s function to maintain terminal repeat (TR)-containing circular genomes and the TR’s enhancer function for KSHV-inducible gene promoters. By including two TR copies with a lytic inducible gene promoter (TR2 -OriP -OriP -OriP -OriP -OriP -OriP Graphical abstract Izumiya and colleagues have demonstrated a novel proof of concept for developing gene therapy targeting malignancies caused by oncogenic herpesviruses. They leveraged the virus’ well-designed transcriptional program to restrict therapeutic gene expression exclusively to cells infected with Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. This approach opens a promising new pathway for treating herpesvirus-associated cancers.

KSHV is the causative agent of Kaposi sarcoma, 1 , 2 3 , 4 5 , 6 7 , 8 9 10 , 11 The KSHV viral genome consists of an approximately 140-kb unique coding region flanked by large copies of high G + C 801-bp terminal repeat (TR). 12 13 14 14 12 , 13 DBD 15 16 17 In addition to being a LANA-binding sequence, KSHV TR was found to function as a gene enhancer for inducible viral gene promoters. 18 , 19 cis 18 18 One of the critical barriers of gene therapy is the safe and efficient delivery of genetic material to the target tissues/cells, which is carried out by delivery vehicles. There are two gene therapy vectors: viral and non-viral. 20 , 21 21 , 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 Indirect gene therapy, a method that converts the prodrug into a lethal (cytotoxic) drug within the tumor cells, demonstrates great promise and is being evaluated in clinical trials. The advantage of an indirect approach is to have an additional step, which makes the therapy adjustable and, therefore, safer for patients. The most studied indirect therapy is based on introducing the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene with ganciclovir (GCV) administration. 35 , 36 37 , 38 Here, we designed and evaluated a KSHV-associated disease-specific gene therapy vector. We first examined TK/GCV indirect therapy with AAV because KSHV is a herpesvirus and GCV alone showed some efficacy in preventing KSHV-associated tumor progression in clinics. 39 , 40 , 41 Results Preparation and validation of KSHV-infection-specific gene expression cassette Recent reports demonstrated that KSHV TR is not only a LANA-binding sequence for KSHV episome maintenance but also possesses gene enhancer function. 18 , 42 Figure 1 18 , 42 Figure 1 OriP 43 , 44 18 , 43 , 45 , 46 , 47 Figure 1 OriP 48 Figure 1 Construction of KSHV-infection-specific gene expression cassette (A) Schematic diagram of cloning strategy to generate specific gene therapeutic vector.

With serum-free defined culture media, we could also avoid using animal proteins, which reduces biosafety concerns. AAV therapeutics prepared with recombinant baculovirus platforms are being evaluated in human clinical trials. 49 The TR2- OriP materials and methods Figure 1 OriP Figure 2 13 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Activation of TR2- OriP (A) Schematic diagram of iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation for AAV isolation.
