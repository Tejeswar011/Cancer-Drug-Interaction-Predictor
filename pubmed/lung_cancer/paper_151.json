Earlier studies have shown that at the time of BM detection, 60% of the patients reported BM‐related symptoms,  7  2  8  2 68 BM occur predominately in NET patients with liver metastases and are often multiple.  2 111 99m 68  9 18  10  11 Metastatic disease confers shorter OS in NETs.  12  3  13  1  13  10  13  14  15  9  16  10 In this study, we hypothesize that BM in patients with Si‐NET diagnosed on 68 2 PATIENT AND METHODS 2.1 Study population We screened 753 Si‐NET patients, who underwent 68 WHO tumour grade and Ki‐67 index at diagnosis was noted. In the event of a subsequent tumour biopsy/biopsies, WHO tumour grade and Ki‐67 index obtained closest to the time of BM diagnosis was recorded. The liver tumour burden was classified according to an arbitrary scale: Stage I (fewer than 5 metastases in the same lobe), Stage II (bilobar and/or 5 to 10 metastases) and Stage III (more than 10 metastases or diffuse metastatic disease). Symptoms such as pain and BM‐related fractures were registered, as well as administered analgesics and external beam radiation therapy. The number and location of BM were documented, and the patients were first divided into groups with 1, 2, 3–5, 6–10 and >10 BM. After investigating a threshold of increased mortality risk, patients with BM were further divided into two groups (≤5 BM vs. >5 BM), which was also used according to a relatively even distribution of the number of patients within the two groups. To further evaluate the prognostic impact of BM on OS, a control group of age‐ and sex‐matched Si‐NET patients with liver metastases (Stage IV disease), but without BM, was used. The control patients were identified from the initial cohort of 753 patients who underwent 68 n The 68 2.1.1   68 DOTATOC  68 68 2.1.2   68 DOTATOC PET CT The patients underwent PET/CT on a digital time‐of‐flight PET/CT scanner (Discovery MI, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee Wisconsin, USA in Uppsala and Siemens Biograph Vision 600, Erlangen, Germany in Örebro) utilizing clinical routine examination protocols. Whole‐body examination was performed from the proximal thighs to the base of the skull, 3 min per bed position, 1 h after i.v. injection of 2 MBq/kg body weight of 68 Concomitant CT was performed according to a clinical standard examination protocol whereby the liver was examined during i.v. contrast‐enhancement (Jomeprol 400 mgI/mL, 0.6 g of iodine/kg body weight, 5 mL/s) in the late arterial phase (portal‐venous inflow phase) and the neck–thorax–abdomen and pelvis were subsequently scanned in the venous contrast‐enhancement phase. All appropriate corrections were applied to the PET data, and the PET images were reconstructed using time‐of‐flight Ordered Subset Expectation Maximization (OSEM) with 3 iterations and 16 subsets, including resolution recovery, a 5‐mm Gaussian post‐processing filter, and a matrix size of 256 × 256 with a reconstructed field‐of‐view of 50 cm. 2.2 Ethical considerations This retrospective study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the ethics review boards at the participating centres in Sweden (Diary number 2020‐00539) with amendments. 2.3 Statistical analysis Data were registered in Microsoft Excel 2016. Nominal data are presented as number of patients and percentages, and scaled data are presented as means and medians with ranges. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed to assess OS and BM stratified into ≤5 BM or >5 BM, synchronous BM and Stage IV disease, according to the first available 68 Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine the prognostic impact of the presence and extent of BM.

Median age at diagnosis was 62 years (range 29–83), whereas median age at BM diagnosis was 67 years (range 49–88) and 64 patients were women (45%). Synchronous BM was seen in 46 patients (33%). All tumours were well‐differentiated; 58 were WHO Grade 1 (G1), 67 were Grade 2 (G2), 1 was Grade 3 (G3), while 12 tumours were of unspecified grade. The median Ki‐67 at diagnosis was 3% (range 1%–30%). The median (±SD) follow‐up period was 41 ± 39 months. At diagnosis, the CS was present in 48 patients (35%) and PC was encountered in 48 patients (35%), whereas hepatic metastases were present in 94 patients (68%). Among 48 patients with CS, 17 patients (35%) manifested concomitant PC. CHD was present in 31 patients (22%) and was three times more common in patients with >5 BM than in those with ≤5 BM ( p Re‐biopsy was performed in 53 patients (38%) due to progressive disease, and 4 patients were subjected to two re‐biopsies. Only two patients had biopsies from their BM. Primary surgery was performed at NET diagnosis in 100 patients (73%). All patients were treated with SSA.

Palliative external beam radiation therapy of BM was administered to 10 patients (7%). Compression of the spinal medulla was found in four patients (3%) and fractures in six patients (4%). The location of the pathological fractures was in the vertebral column and in ribs, the latter due to metastatic pleural overgrowth. 3.2 BM impact on OS Among the 138 patients with BM, the median OS was 130 months from the time of NET diagnosis and 43 months from the time of BM diagnosis.

Compression of the spinal medulla was seen in 3% and fractures in 4%. Earlier studies on the symptomatology of NET‐related BM are sparse. In a previous study, only 9% of patients had BM; however, this study was limited by the fact that BM were detected by conventional radiology,  17 68  1  5  17 68 68  18 68  13  17  19 Regarding the prognostic impact, we found that patients with BM had a median OS of 130 months from NET diagnosis and 43 months from BM diagnosis, implying that BM could be a late event in the clinical course of the disease. OS was also significantly decreased in patients with >5 BM compared to those with ≤5 BM (18 months vs. 75 months, p p p  17 The prognostic role of BM as an independent negative predictor for survival was confirmed in a multivariable analysis along with the extent of bone disease. Though, BM do not seem to cause a high number of fractures and associated hospitalization complications in our patient cohort, accounting for direct mortality. The impact on survival of locoregional surgical resection of the primary tumour in Stage IV disease is controversial with contradicting results in previous studies.  1  3  13 p  19 Interestingly, CHD was present in 22% of our patients with BM, especially patients with >10 BM presenting a prevalence of CHD up to 42%. Generally, an approximately 6% prevalence of CHD has been described in previous literature, which is in line with our study in the subset of Stage IV patients without BM.  20 The therapeutic approach to BM in Si‐NET patients is not well established. Treatment in disseminated NET disease is palliative, with the aims to prolong progression‐free survival and to reduce the NET symptoms and pain. Effective treatment of disseminated disease indeed requires a multimodal approach. SSA constitute an established symptomatic and antiproliferative treatment in well‐differentiated NET.  21  22  22  21  23  23  24  24  9 Bone‐directed therapies include orthopaedic surgery, external beam radiation therapy, bisphosphonates and denosumab. Bone pain relief has been described in up to 90% of patients treated with external beam radiation therapy.  25  26 Our study has some limitations, including its retrospective nature and multi‐centre design. Thus, different surveillance approaches, with variable time intervals for functional imaging in the two participating centres, may confound the results regarding the time of BM detection and setting the baseline for survival estimates. There is also a risk of referral bias in our study, since tertiary referral centres may have included patients with more advanced disease. Furthermore, in this type of study it was, because of ethical and logistical reasons, not possible to biopsy and achieve histopathological verification of all BM diagnosed on 68 68 A strength of our study was the homogeneous and large cohort of Si‐NET patients with BM, and that the detection of these metastases was based solely on 68 Also, we excluded patients with poorly differentiated NECs and NETs of other primary origin than the small intestine to minimize tumour heterogeneity in our cohort. Although central nuclear medicine imaging review was not undertaken in all patients, expert reading of 68 Given that the current detection rate of BM is higher than in previous reports, larger multicentre studies in patients with NETs may better delineate the clinical impact of BM and suggest more advantageous treatment strategies, particularly among emerging bone‐specific treatments. 5 CONCLUSIONS  68 AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS  Maria Wedin: Eva Tiensuu Janson: Göran Wallin: Anders Sundin: Kosmas Daskalakis: CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
