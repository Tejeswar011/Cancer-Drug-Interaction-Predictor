The psoas muscle index (PMI), a radiologic marker of sarcopenia, may offer prognostic value in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, a population frequently characterized by frailty and high perioperative risk. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of 32 patients who underwent LVAD implantation between 2017 and 2022 and had preoperative CT imaging within 45 days. PMI was calculated from bilateral psoas muscle area at the L3 vertebral level, normalized to height. Sarcopenia was defined as the lowest sex-specific quartile of PMI. Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), 90-day mortality, and postoperative length of stay (LOS). Results: Eight patients (25%) met criteria for sarcopenia. Sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic groups had similar demographics, comorbidities, and nutritional status. While there were no significant differences in overall, 90-day, or 1-year mortality between groups, among those who died post-implantation, the sarcopenic group had significantly shorter OS (median 38 vs. 597 days, p sarcopenia psoas muscle index LVAD heart failure This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Heart failure (HF), affecting 64 million people worldwide, continues to be one of the leading causes of global morbidity, mortality, and elevated healthcare cost burden [ 1 2 2 3 3 4 Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have emerged as an alternative mechanical circulatory support intervention for patients who may not be optimal OHT candidates [ 5 6 7 Despite advancements in LVAD technology and improved survival rates, implantation remains associated with significant risks, given the frailty and co-morbidities frequently seen in end-stage HF populations [ 8 9 Sarcopenia, defined as the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and functional capacity, has been consistently linked to adverse surgical postoperative outcomes and increased morbidity [ 10 11 11 In recent years, the psoas major muscle has been utilized as a metric of sarcopenia. The psoas plays a critical role in maintaining posture and supporting the spine and pelvis and is readily and reliably identified on cross-sectional imaging, especially computed tomography (CT), making it an important metric point for sarcopenia [ 12 13 14 Despite these findings, the prognostic value of PMI in patients undergoing LVAD and OHT implantation remains unexplored. This study seeks to evaluate the prognostic significance of the Psoas Muscle Index (PMI) in predicting overall survival (OS) and postoperative length of stay (LOS) among patients undergoing LVAD evaluation. By focusing on LVAD recipients, a population characterized by significant physiologic stress, surgical complexity, and heterogeneous recovery potential, we aim to clarify whether PMI-diagnosed sarcopenia can contribute to risk stratification in overall survival and chronological mortality risk. We hypothesize that sarcopenic status, as defined by PMI, would be predictive of poorer outcomes, including lower OS and prolonged LOS. By investigating the role of PMI as predictive of clinical outcomes, this study seeks to inform clinical practice by identifying patients who may benefit from preoperative nutritional intervention and to contribute to the growing body of evidence on the importance of preoperative risk stratification in LVAD candidates. If validated, PMI assessment could be seamlessly incorporated into preoperative workflows, tailoring prehabilitation regimens prior to device implantation. 2. Methods This study was a single-center retrospective analysis. The study population consisted of 41 patients who underwent LVAD implantation between 2017 and 2022. As this was a retrospective study, the sample size was determined by the number of patients who underwent LVAD implantation with preoperative CT imaging available within 45 days. No a priori power calculation was performed, and our analysis is therefore exploratory in nature. Psoas muscle area was measured at the L3 level of the CT scan, and PMI was then calculated using the formula (left psoas area + right psoas area)/height 2 15 3 Inclusion criteria were patients who underwent LVAD implantation between 2017 and 2022 and had a preoperative CT abdomen/pelvis within 45 days of surgery. Exclusion criteria were patients without available CT imaging in this timeframe or without at least one year of follow-up data. These criteria were chosen to balance the proximity of imaging to the operative event with feasibility in clinical practice. Exclusion criteria included (1) patients without computed tomography abdomen/pelvis (CTAP) imaging within 45 days of implantation and (2) patients without one year of follow-up information after implantation. The 45-day imaging window was selected to balance the need for proximity to the surgical event while allowing flexibility for clinical scheduling constraints. This interval has also been adopted in prior sarcopenia studies as a reasonable compromise between precision and feasibility [ 3 Study data were collected and managed using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) electronic data capture tools hosted at Temple University Hospital. We collected information regarding patient demographics, comorbidities, social history, date of diagnosis, hand grip strength (HGS), mini-nutritional assessment (MNA), and outpatient milrinone use. The principal outcome measures gathered were postoperative LOS, overall mortality, deceased within 90 days of implantation, deceased within 1 year of implantation, and deceased with the same admission as implantation. 2.1. Definition of Sarcopenia Pre-interventional CT scans were accessed using eRAD PACS Viewer Version 7. PMI was obtained by measuring the cross-sectional area of bilateral psoas muscles at the level of L3 ( Figure 1 2 2 16 16 17 18 19 1st quartile PMI values were calculated as 4.99 cm 2 2 2 2 2.2. Statistical Analysis The characteristics of the sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic OHT and LVAD recipients were compared using T 3. Results 3.1. Cohort and Sarcopenia Distribution A total of 108 cases of LVAD recipients were reviewed, of which we identified 32 patients with computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis (CTAP) within 45 days of implantation. Sarcopenia was present in eight (25%) of LVAD patients. The 32-patient population was divided into an 8-patient sarcopenic cohort and a 24-patient non-sarcopenic cohort ( Figure 2 3.2.

Key Findings This study demonstrates that while baseline demographics and comorbidities were similar between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic LVAD recipients, there was a striking difference in early postoperative survival among those who died after implantation. Specifically, the sarcopenic cohort exhibited a median OS of just 38 days compared to nearly 600 days in the non-sarcopenic group. Although this difference did not translate into statistically significant disparities in long-term or overall mortality rates, the early postoperative hazard was markedly higher in the sarcopenic group. This pattern suggests that sarcopenia exerts its most profound influence during the high-stress perioperative window, a period characterized by surgical trauma, inflammatory activation, hemodynamic adjustments, and rapid metabolic shifts. Once this acute vulnerability period is survived, patients, regardless of preoperative sarcopenia status, appear to achieve a more stable survival trajectory under LVAD support. 4.2. Comparison with Existing Literature In our study, PMI-defined sarcopenia was associated with significantly lower OS among LVAD recipients who died postoperatively, with all sarcopenic deaths occurring within 90 days of implantation. This reinforces the concept that skeletal muscle mass is not merely a reflection of nutritional status but a surrogate for the body’s ability to withstand and recover from major surgical stressors [ 4 5 6 20 21 22 23 Sarcopenia, as defined by skeletal muscle mass on imaging, has been consistently linked to worse perioperative outcomes. Recently, Yang et al. demonstrated sarcopenia as determined by skeletal muscle index (SMI) on CTAP to be associated with increased 30-day and 90-day postoperative mortality [ 20 21 22 23 p 21 4.3. Potential Mechanisms These results have direct relevance to LVAD candidate selection, preoperative optimization, and postoperative rehabilitation strategies. Skeletal muscle mass plays a vital role in metabolic and physical recovery following major surgery [ 24 25 26 27 Toth et al. demonstrated that in chronic heart failure, immobility and reduced activity levels contribute to a disproportionate loss of oxidative type I muscle fibers, mitochondrial dysfunction, and diminished capillary density, which together impair endurance capacity and further accelerate sarcopenia. This muscle phenotype shift reduces fatigue resistance and may limit postoperative rehabilitation potential even when cardiac output is restored by LVAD support [ 28 29 4.4. Impact on Rehabilitation and Recovery Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) following LVAD implantation is a critical component of the recovery process. For non-sarcopenic patients, participation in CR has been associated with improved exercise tolerance, reduced hospital readmission rates, and better long-term survival [ 30 31 Shakuta et al. showed that sarcopenic patients who failed to improve during CR faced significantly higher all-cause mortality, suggesting that recovery of muscle mass may be a critical determinant of long-term prognosis. This results in a vicious cycle of inability to participate in CR, perpetuating muscle loss, increased frailty, and exacerbated vulnerability to postoperative complications [ 30 32 28 29 30 4.5. Long-Term Implications Although our study found no significant difference in long-term survival between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients after 90 days, the early perioperative period appears to be a critical window in which sarcopenia exerts its greatest influence. This likely reflects the compounded impact of surgical stress, pre-existing frailty, and the metabolic demands of advanced HF, all of which disproportionately affect patients with diminished skeletal muscle reserves. Once sarcopenic patients survive this vulnerable phase, they may benefit from hemodynamic improvements provided by the LVAD. This hemodynamic stabilization, coupled with participation in structured cardiac rehabilitation, could allow sarcopenic patients to regain strength and functional capacity to equal that of their non-sarcopenic cohorts. The current literature suggests that the improved cardiac output and end-organ perfusion afforded by LVAD support can attenuate the chronic catabolic state seen in advanced HF, leading to an adequate increase in lean muscle mass, reversal of oxidative fiber loss, and improved mitochondrial function when coupled with prehabilitation and perioperative optimization. In some cohorts, postoperative increases in muscle mass have been associated with better functional performance and reduced rehospitalization risk, underscoring that sarcopenia in the LVAD population may be a modifiable, not fixed, risk factor given appropriate interventions. Thus, early identification of sarcopenia and preoperative interventions aimed at improving muscle mass and strength may be essential for optimizing participation in post-LVAD cardiac rehabilitation. PMI, given its ease of measurement and validated correlation to sarcopenic status, provides an accessible and consistent method of identifying these patients in the preoperative setting for potential intervention. As seen in our study, there is a significant added value in triaging patients for sarcopenia with PMI. Incorporating PMI into pre-LVAD risk stratification algorithms could help direct high-risk patients toward intensified prehabilitation strategies, potentially improving both early and late outcomes. 4.6. Limitations This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the results. First, the limited sample size, particularly within the sarcopenic cohort, may have contributed to non-significant p 4.7. Future Directions Future research should focus on investigating the potential for recovery of the psoas muscle area following LVAD implantation and its correlation with long-term outcomes. Given the association between sarcopenia and poor perioperative results, it would be valuable to explore whether improvements in muscle mass, particularly the psoas muscle, occur as patients stabilize hemodynamically with LVAD support. Such studies could incorporate serial imaging to track changes in PMI over time, coupled with functional measures such as grip strength, 6 min walk test distance, and patient-reported quality-of-life scores. Linking anatomical recovery to functional recovery would help clarify whether muscle mass restoration directly translates to improved independence and reduced morbidity. Furthermore, studying the factors that promote muscle recovery, such as nutritional interventions, physical therapy, and structured cardiac rehabilitation, could identify strategies to optimize pre- and post-implantation management for sarcopenic patients. Ultimately, utilization of PMI in the preoperative setting to stratify patients based on 90-day mortality risk could allow for patient-centered multimodal prehabilitative interventions that may increase the long-term mortality benefits observed in the non-sarcopenic cohort and LVAD recipients at large. 5. Conclusions PMI-defined sarcopenia is associated with significantly worse early postoperative survival in our study. This highlights the critical role of skeletal muscle reserves in surgical recovery and suggests that PMI could serve as a practical tool for risk stratification in LVAD candidates. Moreover, early identification of sarcopenia in LVAD candidates could enable targeted nutritional and rehabilitative interventions to improve perioperative outcomes. Larger prospective studies will be necessary to validate our findings and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of sarcopenia on LVAD outcomes and whether interventions can impact survival in this high-risk population.
