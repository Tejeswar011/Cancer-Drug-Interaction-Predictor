Initial imaging and laboratory findings were predominantly indicative of trauma and nonspecific inflammatory responses, which obscured the clues of parasitic infection. The definitive diagnosis was achieved through comprehensive epidemiological history collection and parasitic detection in pleural fluid, highlighting the importance of considering parasitic diseases in cases with atypical infectious manifestations. case report eosinophils paragonimiasis pleural effusion traumatic fracture pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:30.09.2025  M.

Importantly, clinicians should remain alert to parasitic infection even without eosinophilia, and pleural effusion examination can be critical for timely diagnosis. 2 Case Report The patient is a 42‐year‐old male residing in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China. On September 27, 2024, he presented to the emergency department with ‘head and chest trauma for 5 hours’, complaining of chest pain and difficulty breathing following an accidental fall. The initial diagnosis at the primary hospital was ‘rib fracture with massive pleural effusion’, but relevant examination data were missing. He was subsequently transferred to a higher‐level hospital, where the diagnosis included bilateral lung contusion, massive pleural effusion, and fractures of the 4th to 6th ribs on the right side. Blood tests showed elevated white blood cell count (12.28 × 10 9 Microscopic examination of pleural effusion and sputum revealed numerous typical Paragonimus eggs, golden‐yellow and elliptical (80–118) × (48–60) μm with an operculum and thickened posterior shell, consistent with the morphological features of Paragonimus (Figure 1 FIGURE 1  Paragonimus westermani Paragonimus Serum ELISA testing indicated positive IgG antibodies for Paragonimus 1 TABLE 1 Serologic results of parasitic antibody detection by ELISA.

It is often caused by consuming undercooked freshwater crabs or crayfish containing metacercariae [ 6 Paragonimus westermani 7 8 8 9 10 11 Paragonimiasis and tuberculosis have similar clinical manifestations, with the key points for differentiation being that the former is accompanied by peripheral eosinophilia, lesions in the middle and lower lung fields, and migratory imaging findings, with pathology predominantly showing eosinophilic infiltration; the latter typically affects the upper lung fields, exhibits stable imaging, and presents with necrotizing granulomas on pathology [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 5 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 22 26 27 28 The patient in this case was admitted due to trauma, with initial imaging showing rib fractures and pleural effusion, which masked and delayed the diagnosis of underlying paragonimiasis. Laboratory tests indicated elevated white blood cells and neutrophils, consistent with general inflammation, but notably, peripheral blood eosinophils remained within the normal range. Previous studies have emphasised that eosinophilia is an important clue for paragonimiasis [ 5 CT scans of paragonimiasis commonly reveal five types of manifestations: inflammatory infiltration, peribronchitis‐like shadows, cystic shadows, pleural effusion, and cavities [ 29 5 Author Contributions Man Luo drafted the manuscript.
