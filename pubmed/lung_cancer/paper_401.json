The iGN is composed of GNPs conjugated to a synthetic toll‐like receptor (TLR) 7 ligand, an antigen peptide, and a mannose sugar chain. However, the effect of the combination of different sugar chains and antigen peptides on iGN‐mediated anticancer immunotherapy remains to be elucidated. Objective We compared the anti‐tumor effects of two different sugar chains: α‐mannose and sialic acid. Results We showed that not only the sugar chain but also the antigen peptide plays a pivotal role in iGN uptake by immune cells. In contrast to α‐mannose, which promoted GNP internalization by bone marrow‐derived dendritic cells (BMDC), sialic acid modification resulted in limited cellular uptake. The integration of major histocompatibility complex class I‐restricted ovalbumin peptides drastically changed this cellular recognition pattern, particularly for sialic acid‐modified iGN. The peptide largely improved the uptake of nanoparticles, delivery of the TLR 7 ligand, and subsequent activation of the type I interferon pathway in BMDC. Sialic acid‐modified iGN demonstrated comparable induction of CD8 + Conclusions These results indicate that antigens, and not only the sugar chain, critically determine both the cellular internalization and immunotherapeutic efficacy of iGNs. This study presents a new design principle for glyco‐nanovaccines, where peptides override glycan synergy and determine therapeutic efficacy. This study explores how antigen peptides and sugar chains affect the efficacy of glyco‐nanovaccines (iGN) in cancer immunotherapy. We show that antigen peptides, rather than sugar chains, are key to nanoparticle uptake and immune activation, with sialic acid‐modified iGN showing similar anti‐cancer efficacy to α‐mannose‐modified iGN in a mouse model. antigen peptide gold nanoparticle immunotherapy sugar chain TLR7 ligand Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development 10.13039/100009619 JP22cm0106382 JP22gm6210030 Japan Society for the Promotion of Science 10.13039/501100001691 24H00864 24H00865 Takeda Science Foundation 10.13039/100007449 Japan Science and Technology Agency 10.13039/501100002241 JPMJFR226J JPMJPR17HA Hoansha Foundation 10.13039/100016923 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  N.

To investigate the impact of peptide conjugation to glyco‐nanoadjuvant, we developed iGNs conjugating the model antigen OVA “SIINFEKL,” which binds to mouse H‐2Kb MHC class I molecules, to α‐mannose‐ or sialic acid‐conjugated glyco‐nanoadjuvants. Following the established synthetic protocol for α‐mannose‐type iGN (referred to as miGN), the long OVA peptide sequence “SGLEQLESIINFEKL” was conjugated to 1V209–SAα2–3Gal–GNP to produce sialic acid‐type iGN (referred to as siGN) (Figure 2A S2A,B S2C S2D,E S3 Next, we conducted an in vitro uptake assay using both the iGN variants. In contrast to the observations with each glyco‐nanoadjuvant (Figure 1B 2B Ccl3 2C 2D 3.3 Gene Expression Profiling Reveals Immune Activation in BMDCs siGN To investigate the impact of peptide conjugation to glyco‐nanoadjuvant on BMDC activation, we examined the gene expression profiles in siGN‐treated BMDCs compared with 1V209–SAα2–3Gal–GNP‐treated (control) BMDCs (Tables S1 S2 p 3A S3 3B 3C 3D FIGURE 3 Gene expression profiling reveals immune activation in BMDCs stimulated by siGN.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the therapeutic effects of iGN in a murine syngeneic tumor model of EG7, a mouse T lymphoma cell line expressing OVA. EG7 cells were transplanted into the back flanks of mice, followed by intradermal administration of iGN at the tail base three times every 3 days (on days 5, 8, and 11 after transplantation) (Figure 5A 5B 5C 5D FIGURE 5 Antigen‐conjugated glyco‐nanovaccines induce effective anti‐cancer immune responses.

It is possible that the peptide interacts with other cellular receptors or alters the physical characteristics of the GNPs. Burgdorf et al. demonstrated that mannose receptors mediate the internalization of OVA antigen by APCs [ 48 49 To evaluate the impact of peptide conjugation on the physical properties of the GNPs, we measured their zeta potential (Figure S3 50 GNPs have been applied in clinical trials owing to their high biocompatibility and accessibility to surface functionalization [ 20 21 51 52 53 The OVA/EG7 model employed in this study consists of EL4 murine T lymphoma cells engineered to express OVA, and is widely used to study MHC class I‐mediated antigen presentation and CD8 + In conclusion, our findings suggest that both α‐mannose and sialic acid‐based glyco‐nanovaccines could serve as viable platforms for cancer immunotherapy when properly designed with integrated antigens. Flexibility in glycan selection offers the potential to optimize other aspects of vaccine design, including stability, production costs, and tissue‐specific targeting. This study paves the way for the rational design of vaccines that harness the interplay between glycans and peptides, thereby offering new opportunities to improve cancer immunotherapy.
