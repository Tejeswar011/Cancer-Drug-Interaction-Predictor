Neurologists are in a unique position because they are integral in providing patient centered care, understanding neurologic disease and illness trajectory, and how disease can affect patients' sense of self and values. Currently, little is known about neurologists' perceptions and challenges in care planning and palliative care for their patients. Methods Neurologists from one Canadian academic institution participated in a 30-minute semistructured interview from November 2022 to April 2023. Interviews were conducted until saturation was reached and confirmed. Interviews occurred online through a secure platform or in-person and were recorded. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative method using constructivist grounded theory. Member checking was conducted post interview. Results Ten neurologists participated across a broad spectrum of neurology experience and subspecialties. We developed a detailed theory of understanding neurologists' attitudes and perceptions of palliative care. When neurologists delay or fail to initiate care planning discussions or palliative care, it results from a complex interplay between patient, physician, and resource accessibility factors. Certain contextual factors, such as a first visit or follow-up, inpatient vs outpatient setting, clinic culture, and the type of clinic practice, are factors that can influence these conversations. As a result, physicians may fail to use available resources, or they may involve other care providers or refer to subspecialty neurologic clinics. However, this delay can still lead to patient and provider harm. Opportunities to improve care exist with continuing education opportunities for trainees and staff, collaboration with palliative care specialists, and health systems support, such as increasing public awareness to address misconceptions about palliative care and resource availability. Discussion Our findings identify that failure or delay to initiate care planning and palliative care by neurologists results from a complex interplay between local culture, experience, context, practice type, and patient factors. Opportunities to improve care include increasing educational opportunities, building integrated and collaborative practices, and dedicated health systems support. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
