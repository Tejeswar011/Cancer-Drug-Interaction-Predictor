Structured reporting (SR) of imaging reports may enhance interdisciplinary communication and clinical decision‐making; however, its utility compared to non‐structured reporting (NSR) in IBD remains unclear. This systematic review evaluated IBD clinician perceptions of SR versus NSR in IBD‐related imaging. Methods Embase, MEDLINE, and CENTRAL were searched to January 2025 for studies comparing SR and NSR in abdominal and pelvic imaging for IBD, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and intestinal ultrasound (IUS). The primary outcome was perceived clarity and clinical utility by the referring clinician, with report completeness evaluated as a secondary outcome. Results Six studies met inclusion criteria, comprising 199 IBD patients and 224 scans (105 MRI, 119 CT), with a total of 550 SR/NSR report pairs evaluated by 19 clinicians. No eligible studies assessed pelvic MRI or IUS. In four of five studies, clinicians perceived SR as clearer than NSR. Similarly, SR were viewed as having greater clinical utility for assessing disease activity, identifying disease phenotype, and influencing management decisions in four studies. SR were also associated with more complete reporting based on predefined radiological criteria in three studies. Conclusion Clinicians generally perceived SR to provide greater clarity and clinical utility than NSR in IBD‐related imaging, potentially enhancing interdisciplinary communication and clinical decision‐making. Further research is needed to validate these findings and evaluate their impact on patient outcomes in routine IBD practice. computed tomography inflammatory bowel disease magnetic resonance radiology structured reporting pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  R.

Srinivasan Structured Versus Non‐Structured Reporting of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Imaging: A Systematic Review JGH Open 9 10 2025 e70288 10.1002/jgh3.70288  Funding: 1 Introduction Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and intestinal ultrasound (IUS) are important cross‐sectional imaging modalities used in the diagnosis and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [ 1 2 3 Despite their central role in clinical care, radiology reports vary considerably in structure and content across institutions and between practitioners [ 4 5 6 7 Structured reporting (SR) has emerged as an alternative format of radiology reporting that uses reproducible, template‐based frameworks with predefined required and optional elements. SR promotes consistency, improves report completeness, and facilitates clearer communication between radiologists and referring clinicians [ 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Given the chronic, relapsing nature of IBD and the need for serial imaging, a more structured approach to radiology reporting may improve interdisciplinary communication, reduce diagnostic ambiguity, and facilitate optimal clinical decision‐making [ 16 17 18 19 1 16 17 18 19 TABLE 1 Key radiological features to consider when reporting inflammatory bowel disease activity and complications, based on current guidelines.

The full search strategy, including keywords and operators used, is shown in Table S1 2.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Studies eligible for inclusion in this systematic review included clinical trials (non‐randomized or randomized) and observational studies (prospective or retrospective) that included (1) patients with IBD who required (2) cross‐sectional abdominal or pelvic imaging using MRI, CT, or IUS where (3) SR was compared with NSR, and (4) the primary outcome of perceived clarity or clinical utility from referring clinicians was reported. Studies that included mixed cohorts, that is, cohorts that included patients with and without IBD, were only eligible for inclusion when outcomes specific to patients with IBD could be clearly delineated. Other exclusion criteria were unpublished studies and studies not published in English. 2.3 Outcomes The primary outcome was to assess the perceived clarity and clinical utility of SR compared to NSR in cross‐sectional imaging for IBD evaluation. The secondary outcome was the completeness of radiology reports. 2.4 Definitions SR was defined as any radiology reporting method that utilized a predefined template, specified the organization of the radiology report, outlined required radiological content, or included a checklist of key radiological items to be reported. NSR was defined as any reporting structure that did not meet the criteria for SR and was generally defined as those that did not make any specification regarding report content or structure. The referring clinician was defined as the medical practitioner who requested cross‐sectional imaging and included medical and surgical clinicians. Clarity was defined as the degree to which key radiological features relevant to IBD were clearly conveyed and easily extractable from the radiology report. The clinical utility of the reporting structure was defined as the perceived benefit in identifying disease activity, characterizing disease phenotype, or influencing clinical decision‐making. Report completeness was assessed through objective evaluation of the presence of radiology content against predefined radiological parameters. 2.5 Study Selection and Data Extraction Two authors (RWL, ZM) independently screened eligible study titles and abstracts identified by the search and excluded those that were unrelated based on the pre‐specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. This process was undertaken with the assistance of the Covidence software program [ 21 2.6 Risk of Bias Assessment The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by two authors (RWL, ZM). The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool for quasi‐experimental study was used to evaluate the risk of bias of the six included studies [ 22 3 Results 3.1 Search Results The search strategy identified 1625 studies, with three additional studies identified through citation tracking. After removing 250 duplicates, 1378 unique records were screened by title and abstract. Thirty‐eight articles were identified for full‐text review, with six studies identified to meet all eligibility criteria (Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram. 3.2 Risk of Bias Assessment Study quality was evaluated using the JBI critical appraisal tool. All six included studies were nonrandomized observational studies, comprising four full‐text publications and two conference abstracts. Based on the overall appraisal scores, two studies were rated as high quality, while the remaining four were assessed as moderate quality (Table S2 Both studies conducted by Wildman et al. were designated to be of high quality, each receiving an overall JBI score of 87.5% (7/8). Apart from the concern for study reliability from the lack of referring clinician and radiologist blinding, the methodologies of both studies fulfilled all other JBI criteria [ 23 24 25 26 27 3.3 Study Characteristics Five of the six included studies were retrospective in design, with the final study incorporating retrospective and prospective elements (Table 2 n n TABLE 2 Studies comparing structured versus non‐structured imaging reports in inflammatory bowel disease.

Across six observational studies, SR was consistently preferred over NSR in key domains, including clarity, clinical utility, and report completeness (Table 3 TABLE 3 Comparison of structured and non‐structured radiology reporting in inflammatory bowel disease. Outcome SR versus NSR  Primary outcome: Referring clinician perception Clarity Improved by SR in most studies [ 23 26 27 28 24 Ease of information extraction Improved by SR in all studies [ 23 24 27 Ability to identify disease activity Improved by SR in all studies [ 23 24 25 26 Impact on clinical decision‐making SR led to more management changes [ 25 27 Secondary outcome Report completeness Improved by SR in all studies [ 23 24 27 Abbreviations: NSR, non‐structured reporting; SR, structured reporting.

Two studies assessed this outcome and found that referring clinicians were more likely to initiate or adjust treatments, such as corticosteroids and biologics, when using SR rather than NSR [ 25 27 Despite support from consensus guidelines such as SAR CDFP‐SPR‐AGA and ECCO‐ESGAR, the adoption of SR in IBD imaging remains inconsistent [ 16 17 18 19 23 24 25 28 23 24 27 30 31 32 33 34 35 4 23 24 25 28 TABLE 4 Radiological parameters included in structured reporting templates in inflammatory bowel disease.

It is also important to consider radiologist perspectives on SR in the context of IBD. A recent survey of Italian radiologists found that approximately one‐third routinely employed SR for MRE in IBD, recognizing its benefits in enhancing report clarity, completeness, and communication with referring clinicians [ 36 37 Several limitations of this systematic review should be acknowledged. First, only six studies met the inclusion criteria, most of moderate quality, involving a total of 19 referring clinicians from medical and surgical specialties. The small number of eligible studies and the limited sample of clinicians restrict the generalizability of the findings to broader IBD clinician populations and illuminate the potential for publication bias. Moreover, the uneven representation of medical and surgical clinicians limits insights into the role of SR in surgical decision‐making. These factors underscore the need for broader stakeholder engagement and more representative sampling in future research. Second, the composite primary outcomes of perceived clarity and clinical utility were subjective and seldom explicitly defined. Although SR was comparably defined in five of six studies, NSR was only defined in half. Collectively, these inconsistencies highlight the need to standardize outcomes and reporting definitions in future research. Third, none of the included studies evaluated SR in pelvic MRI or IUS, both of which are routinely used in IBD care. IUS is frequently performed by gastroenterologists, who directly report and integrate findings into clinical practice. It would therefore be valuable to explore how reporting practices differ between gastroenterologists and radiologists in IBD. The communication of radiological findings in complex perianal Crohn's disease on pelvic MRI represents another important and clinically relevant area. A study by Tuncyurek et al. exemplified this importance by comparing SR and NSR of pelvic MRI in 105 patients (47 with IBD) and found SR provided greater clarity (mean 7.1–8.3 vs. 5.2–7.6), surgical planning utility (7.1–7.6 vs. 5.8–7.1), and report completeness (81.3%–88.3% vs. 61.2%–72.5%; all p 38 The current ECCO‐ESGAR guidelines encourage, but do not mandate, the use of validated radiological disease activity scores and standardized reporting templates in IBD care [ 2 16 25 23 p 39 5 Conclusion and Future Directions Effective communication between radiologists and IBD clinicians is essential to support optimal clinical decision‐making. This systematic review highlights the potential for SR to enhance interdisciplinary communication and standardize the presentation of key radiological findings in IBD. This is particularly relevant in Crohn's disease, where MRI plays a central role in evaluating complex disease, monitoring interval changes, and assessing treatment response. As radiological treatment targets for both luminal and perianal Crohn's disease become more clearly defined, the need for clear, consistent, and actionable imaging reports is likely to increase. Fostering a productive and collaborative relationship between radiologists and IBD clinicians remains critical to ensuring that reports are not only comprehensive and standardized but also nuanced and clinically relevant. However, current evidence comparing SR with NSR is limited by methodological heterogeneity, variation in reporting templates, and a lack of high‐quality prospective studies. Notably, none of the included studies evaluated SR in the context of pelvic MRI or IUS, both of which are important and frequently used investigations for the assessment of Crohn's disease. Future research should prioritize prospective, real‐world evaluations of SR in IBD, with particular attention to clinical impact, reporting efficiency, interobserver variability, and the integration of AI. Efforts to align reporting templates with expert consensus guidelines and to integrate radiologist perspectives will be essential for supporting wider implementation and sustained clinical utility.
