The cells were cultured in DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mmol/L glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific). For all experiments, cells were used within 10 passages after thawing. Cell lines were not tested for Mycoplasma Establishment of a retroviral vector with random barcodes The pcx6 vector was constructed by inserting random 10–base-pair (bp) DNA barcode sequences upstream of the start codon of the target genes in the pcx4 vector ( 35 K/N/HRAS K/N/HRAS https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic https://www.aacr.org/professionals/research/aacr-project-genie/aacr-project-genie-data/ K/N/HRAS K/N/HRAS Retrovirus production and 3T3 cell infection To produce recombinant retroviruses, the recombinant plasmids were transduced together with packaging plasmids (Takara Bio) into human embryonic kidney 293T cells. The 3T3 cells were infected with ecotropic recombinant retroviruses in 96-well plates using 4 μg/mL of Polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 hours. Focus formation assay For focus formation assay (FFA), 3T3 cells expressing various K/N/HRAS 36 Proliferation competition assay 3T3 cells expressing various KRAS Drug sensitivity assay using the MANO method in vitro A schematic of the MANO method is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. This method uses a retroviral vector that enables the stable integration of individual genes into the genome of assay cells, including 3T3 cells, along with 10-bp barcode sequences. For the drug sensitivity assay, 3T3 cells expressing the respective K/N/HRAS Q33226 HRAS PrestoBlue cell viability assay The transformed 3T3 cells expressing three KRAS HRAS 50 Western blot analysis Parent 3T3 and 3T3 cells with individual variants were treated with the indicated BI-2865 concentrations for 1 day. Subsequently, the cells were lysed in 1% NP-40 lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 15 minutes on ice. Protein separation and detection were performed using an automated capillary electrophoresis system (Simple Western system and Compass software; ProteinSimple, RRID: SCR_025095). Antibodies against the following proteins were used: KRAS (1:10, E2M9G, cat. # 71835, RRID: AB_3705482), MEK1/2 (1:50, cat. # 9122, RRID: AB_823567), phospho-MEK1/2 (Ser217/221; 1:50, 41G9, cat. # 9154, RRID: AB_2138017), cleaved caspase-3 (Asp175; 1:50, 5A1E, cat. # 9664, RRID: AB_2070042), and GAPDH (1:50, 14C10, cat. # 2118, RRID: AB_561053). All primary antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Moreover, the signals were detected using a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody and visualized using the ProteinSimple software.

The unweighted and quadratic-weighted κ values were 0.416 and 0.651, respectively, indicating moderate to substantial agreement according to the criteria of Landis and Koch. These findings suggest that the model effectively captures ordinal relationships among scores and approximates true FFA scores with reasonable fidelity. Sensitivity estimates for individual scores ranged from 36.8% (score 2) to 81.5% (score 4), whereas specificity ranged from 71.4% to 98.4%. Balanced accuracy was the highest for score 4 (76.5%) and lowest for score 2 (64.4%), reflecting variable discriminative performance across score categories. Positive predictive values ranged from 42.1% to 80.0%, indicating varying levels of classification confidence depending on the score. The proliferative capacity of the KRAS In the FFA, we identified 35 KRAS KRAS KRAS Analysis based on the FFA score revealed that higher FFA scores were associated with greater proliferative capacity (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Variants with strong transforming activity (FFA score of 3 or 4) exhibited significantly higher proliferation compared with WT KRAS We next compared the proliferative capacity of the 35 rare KRAS KRAS Drug sensitivity screening against KRAS The drug sensitivity of KRAS KRAS KRAS Fig. 3A NRAS HRAS NRAS HRAS Figure 3. Drug sensitivity of KRAS A, KRAS 50 B, KRAS HRAS n 50  KRAS 50 50 30 The results of the drug sensitivity assay were validated using the PrestoBlue cell viability assay. In the PrestoBlue cell viability assay, the G12A, G12C, G12D, G12E, G13C, G13D, G13F, G13Y, Q61P, and K117Y variants showed a tendency toward more sensitive to BI-2865 than the G12L, G12R, G12W, G13P, and Q61L variants, although the difference was not statistically significant ( P t Fig. 3B 50 r The ability of BI-2865 to inhibit downstream signaling pathway was evaluated through Western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S9). MEK1/2 phosphorylation was inhibited at 500 nmol/L in G12A (sensitive variant), whereas it is inhibited around 10 μmol/L in G12R (resistant variant). Cleaved caspase-3, a hallmark of apoptosis, was observed in 3T3 cells with KRAS KRAS Discussion To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to perform a comprehensive functional analysis of rare RAS RAS 45 47 K/N/HRAS 48 KRAS mutants’ cycle between the “on” and “off” states and depend on nucleotide exchange for their activation ( 18 49 50 39 39 51 54 Among the 17 variants that were newly identified as BI-2865 resistant by the MANO method, only G13P is a missense mutation. A plausible resistance mechanism of the G13P mutation is reduced GTPase activity. Substitution of glycine—a small, flexible, and nonpolar residue—with proline, a rigid amino acid with a cyclic structure, likely imposes conformational constraints on the P-loop, which spans residues G10 to V14. This structural restriction may hinder the dynamic conformational changes required for efficient GTP hydrolysis. The P-loop plays a critical role in stabilizing the phosphate groups of GTP and is essential for GTPase activity ( 55 The remaining 16 resistant variants were primarily classified as insertions, duplications, or deletion–insertion mutations located in or around critical structural regions such as the P-loop (G10–V14) and switch II (G60–E76). Mutations involving insertions or duplications within these key structural elements are likely to induce substantial conformational changes in the KRAS protein, thereby profoundly affecting its GTPase function and structural integrity. Mutations affecting the P-loop, such as V9_G10dup, G10dup, G10_A11insTG, A11_G12dup, G12_G13insV, G13dup, and G13_V14delinsDI, are likely to impair the flexible phosphate-binding architecture required for GTP hydrolysis. Its conformation is highly sensitive to residue size and polarity. These mutants are biased toward the constitutively active, GTP-bound state of KRAS, thereby diminishing the availability of the GDP-bound conformation targeted by BI-2865. Furthermore, local structural distortion likely interferes with the inhibitor binding pocket itself, physically blocking BI-2865 access. Additionally, insertions or duplications located in the switch II region, such as T50_E63dup, L52_G60dup, D54_E62dup, Q61_S65dup, E62_E63insDDTAGQE, E62_A66dup, Y64_S65insMDILDTAGQEEY, S65_Y71dup, and A66_G75dup, may directly perturb the structural integrity of the BI-2865–binding surface, resulting in impaired drug binding and reduced inhibitory efficacy. Mutations in this region, particularly large insertions and tandem duplications, cause severe structural distortion, almost certainly inhibiting GTP hydrolysis and reconfiguring the BI-2865–binding surface beyond recognition. Collectively, these results suggest a unified mechanism for BI-2865 resistance in KRAS KRAS Clinical validation is needed to confirm these preclinical data. There are currently no clinical trials of BI-2865 and its structural analog of BI-2493. However, BI 3706674, a related compound, is under clinical investigation for patients with gastroesophageal cancers carrying KRAS NCT06056024 This study has potential limitations that should be acknowledged.
