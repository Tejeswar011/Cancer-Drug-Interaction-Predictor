With a disturbing increase in mortality and disease burden, there remains a need for effective early-stage theragnostic and prognostic biomarkers. In this work, we improved on BrcaDx ( https://apalania.shinyapps.io/brcadx/ Methods We analyzed the transcriptomic profiles of breast cancer patients from public-domain databases such as the TCGA using stage-encoded problem-specific statistical models of gene expression and unveiled stage-salient and progression-significant genes. Using a consensus approach, we identified potential machine learning features, and considered six model classes for each learning problem, with hyperparameter optimization on a training dataset and evaluation on a holdout test dataset. A nested approach enabled us to identify the best model class for each learning problem. Results External validation of the best models yielded balanced accuracies of 97.42% for cancer vs normal; 88.22% for metastatic v/s non metastatic; 88.79% for ternary molecular subtyping; and ensemble accuracy of 94.23% for histological subtyping. The model for molecular subtyping was validated on a 26-sample TNBC-only out-of-distribution cohort, yielding 25 correct predictions. We performed a late integration of multi-omics datasets by validating the feature space used in each problem with miRNA profiles, methylation profiles, and commercial breast cancer panels. Discussion Pending prospective studies, we have translated the models into BC-Predict that forks the best models developed for each problem in a unified interface and provides a complete readout for input instances of expression data, including uncertainty estimates.

This may be balanced with the curse of dimensionality that dominates machine learning. AI models based on whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing may be impractical and uninterpretable. McKinney et al. have developed a mammogram-based AI model for breast cancer screening rivalling radiologist readings, paving the way for AI-based decision support systems ( McKinney et al., 2020 Mostavi et al., 2020 Zhao et al., 2020 Bastien et al., 2012 Gao et al., 2019 Mohaiminul Islam et al., 2020 Zhang et al., 2022 Almstedt et al., 2020 Soliman et al., 2020 Baskota et al., 2021 Bartlett et al., 2019 Muthamilselvan et al., 2023 The heterogeneity of breast cancer poses formidable challenges, and individual cancer manifestations vary so much that the available biomarker panels retain validity only in limited settings, thereby leaving a large cohort indeterminate ( Güler, 2017 Brierley et al., 2016 Kourou et al., 2015 Horr and Buechler, 2021 Johnson et al., 2021 Vaidya et al., 2018 Fu et al., 2017 Fitzgibbons et al., 2000 Rakha et al., 2010 https://apalania.shinyapps.io/BC-Predict https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.25282906 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Problems related to the characterization of breast cancer heterogeneity Four problems related to the delineation of individual breast cancers with respect to the expression data of patient samples were considered: Is the patient sample ‘cancer’ or ‘normal’? If cancer: predict ‘non-metastatic’ (stages I, II or III) or ‘metastatic’ (stage-IV cancer). If cancer: predict the molecular subtype of the cancer. If cancer: predict the histological subtype of the cancer. A generalized workflow for the problems is depicted in Figure 1 FIGURE 1 ML model development for Cancer vs. Normal binary classification. Data-driven optimization of a multi-phase workflow, including nested model selection, is shown. Hypothesis space pruning is achieved via feature selection techniques, leading to a consensus gene-signature. Six different classes of machine learning algorithms were considered, with hyperparameter optimization via k-fold cross-validation on the training dataset and model class selection on the holdout test dataset. External validation of the best model yielded a robust assessment of generalizability. Problem-specific substitutions yield workflows adapted to the other problems considered. Flowchart depicting a data analysis pipeline for BRCA. It begins with data preprocessing, involving TCGA-BRCA data and removal of minimal variance genes. The data is split into training and independent validation datasets. Feature engineering uses Linear modeling genes and a two-tier contrast to select stage-salient genes. Hypothesis space optimization is performed via feature selection by RFE and Boruta, leading to consensus features. These load onto a machine learning model, followed by k-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. The model undergoes external validation on ICGC-KR cancer and GTEx normal data sets. 2.2 Dataset preprocessing Preprocessing was done in a manner similar to Sarathi and Palaniappan ( Sarathi and Palaniappan, 2019 Summary, 2016 Giuliano et al., 2018 Table 1 TABLE 1 Stage-wise distribution of TCGA breast cancer samples based on AJCC system, 2018 revision.

Luminal A is HER2 negative, whereas Luminal B could be either HER2 positive (accounting for 30% of HER2 positive) or HER2 negative (majority of Luminal B). S.No. HER2 status ER status PgR status Ki-67 labelling index Intrinsic subtype 1 + + + Any Luminal B (HER2 positive) + – – + 2 + – – n/a HER2+ 3 – + + Low (<14%) Luminal A High Luminal B (HER2 negative) + – Low (<14%) Luminal A High Luminal B (HER2 negative) – + Low (<14%) Luminal A High Luminal B (HER2 negative) 4 – – – n/a Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) The two most common histological subtypes of breast cancer are infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC - no special type) and infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) ( Weigelt et al., 2010 Winchester et al., 1998 Genes that had minimal variation in expression across the samples (i.e., σ < 1) were removed. Cancer samples which were missing stage annotation details were removed. The expression dataset was subjected to variance-stabilization using voom limma Law et al., 2014 Chawla et al., 2002 www.r-project.org 2.3 Construction of feature space Feature spaces for each problem were constructed using only the training dataset. Initially the differential expression of genes across cancer stages relative to healthy samples was studied using linear modelling with limma ( Ritchie et al., 2015 y = α + β 1 X 1 + β 2 X 2 + β 3 X 3 + β 4 X 4 (1) Where the independent variables are indicator variables of the sample’s stage, the intercept  α  β i We then applied a two-level contrast protocol ( Muthamilselvan et al., 2023 Stage-salient genes obtained from all possible pairwise contrasts between the cancer stages using the following model: y = β 0 X 0 + β 1 X 1 + β 2 X 2 + β 3 X 3 + β 4 X 4 (2) Where the controls themselves constitute one of the indicator variables (  X 0  β i Monotonically expressed genes obtained from strictly increasing or strictly decreasing mean expression across the cancer stages. In addition, expression contrasts specific to the problem under consideration were used, namely: contrast of non-metastatic vs. metastatic cancers using the following model modified from Equation 2 y = μ 0 X 0 + μ 1 X 1 + μ 2 X 2 (3) Where the  μ i three-way pairwise contrasts between the molecular subtypes; viz. (i) Luminal vs. HER2+, (ii) Luminal vs. TNBC and (iii) HER2+ vs. TNBC using the following model modified from Equation 2 y = δ 0 X 0 + δ 1 X 1 + δ 2 X 2 + δ 3 X 3 (4) Where the  δ i contrast of ductal vs. lobular histologies using the following model modified from Equation 2 y = ϑ 0 X 0 + ϑ 1 X 1 + ϑ 2 X 2 (5) Where the  ϑ i The above strategies yielded problem-specific chimeric feature spaces that could span the informative dimensions in each case. 2.4 Building problem-specific classification models A composite feature space comprising the top-ranked genes from the linear model, stage-salient genes, and genes from the problem-specific contrast was subjected to the consensus of two feature selection techniques: (i) Boruta, a wrapper algorithm using Random Forest to select features based on a measure of importance to the outcome variable of interest ( Kursa and Rudnicki, 2010 Figure 1 2.5 Nested model selection Subsequent to an 80:20 train-test split, algorithm-specific hyperparameter configuration was optimized using 10-fold cross-validation on the training dataset for each of the six algorithms considered. Different algorithm classes were then compared based on their outer-fold testset performance, to identify the optimal algorithm class for each learning problem. The design of such a nested model selection prevents information leakage between model tuning and evaluation, and provides for a more reliable assessment of model generalizability to unseen cohorts than merely cross-validation. Evaluation metrics on the holdout testset as well as external datasets (described below) included balanced accuracy, F1-score, area under ROC (AUROC), Mathews’ correlation coefficient (MCC), and Positive Predictive Value (PPV). 2.6 Validation The overall best model for each problem was validated primarily by performing inference on out-of-domain external datasets.

By exerting control over the expression of target genes, miRNAs act as oncogenes, tumor-suppressive genes, and modulators of distant metastasis in breast cancer. To identify differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs, we used the miRSeq dataset from the same TCGA BRCA cohort ( gdac.broadinstitute.org_BRCA.Merge_mirnaseq__illuminahiseq_mirnaseq__bcgsc_ca__Level_3__miR_isoform_expression__data.Level_3.2016012800.0.0.tar.gz Ru et al., 2014 Ag et al., 2015 Wang, 2008 Enright et al., 2003 Huang et al., 2022 2.6.2.2 Identification of differential methylation-driven genes (DMDGs) Epigenetic processes such as methylation could contribute to changes in gene expression and drive pathological processes. To evaluate differentially methylated genes, we used the Level3-processed 450k methylation dataset from the same TCGA BRCA cohort ( gdac.broadinstitute.org_BRCA.Merge_methylation__humanmethylation450__jhu_usc_edu__Level_3__within_bioassay_data_set_function__data.aux.2016012800.0.0.tar.gz Cedoz et al., 2018 Muthamilselvan et al., 2022 2.7 Development of cascade classifier A prediction pipeline that integrates the predictions from all the models into one combined readout was designed. A schematic for one such cascade model is shown in Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Design of BC-Predict. A schematic of a cascade model for early-stage breast cancer subtyping and prognosis is presented. If the sample is predicted as ‘cancer’ in the first level, it is passed through three more models in the second level that holistically characterize the cancer sample toward personalized medicine. Flowchart depicting cancer diagnosis. Starting from \"Features from new Sample\" leading to \"Cancer Vs Normal.\" If cancer, it branches into \"Lobular vs Ductal,\" \"Non-metastatic vs Metastatic,\" and \"Molecular Subtyping,\" culminating in a \"Combined Readout,\" exemplified as \"Metastatic Ductal Triple-negative breast cancer.\" A \"Normal\" branch also originates from the \"Cancer Vs Normal\" decision point. 3 Results The TCGA BRCA dataset consisted of 1,212 samples, each with the measurement of expression of 20532 genes. Post data preprocessing, we obtained an annotated dataset of 1,178 samples x 18880 genes (Supplementary File S1). An adj. p.value cut-off of 0.05 yielded 14838 DE genes in breast cancer samples. Tightening the significance to adj. p-value < 1E-05 still yielded 10167 DE genes, underscoring the persistence of genome instability in the March of cancer ( Hanahan, 2022 Figure 3a Figure 3b Table 4 Figure 4 FIGURE 3 Mining of candidate biomarkers.

Six model classes were optimized on the train data for each problem and subsequently evaluated on the holdout test to identify the best model class for that problem (Supplementary File S8). A summary of the best overall model for each problem and its validation on the external dataset(s) is presented in Table 7 TABLE 7 The best model class and its performance for each of the problems of interest: (i) normal v/s cancer using ten features, (ii) metastatic v/s non-metastatic using five features, (iii) molecular subtyping using 16 features, and (iv) histological subtyping using 24 features. Nested model selection was used to identify the best model class, with subsequent validation on external datasets. In the case of histological subtype, a voting ensemble of the two models shown was used for the external validation.

The importance scale ranges from zero to one hundred. 3.4 Histological subtype classification Stratified sampling of the TCGA BRCA dataset based on the histological subtype (‘IDC’ or ‘ILC’) yielded a training dataset of 624 IDC and 162 ILC samples, and a test dataset of 156 IDC and 40 ILC samples. The contrast shown in Equation 5 Table 7 in situ Table 7 www.github.com/apalania/BC-Predict_Histological 3.5 Validation with miRNA analysis Stage-salient miRNA were identified using the two-level contrasts of the miRNA expression data, and then their targets were identified using the R multiMiR library (Supplementary File S13). Based on these results, we determined the concordance between the regulatory miRNAs and their target genes. Temporal concordance in expression exists if the salience in miRNA expression is at least as early as the salience in target gene expression. If the expression pattern of miRNA is discordant with its target gene, a paradoxical aberration with a protective function is possible. Table 8 TABLE 8 Putative target stage-salient genes mapped with their regulatory stage-salient miRNA. Concordance in expression is noted if miRNA overexpression is observed with target gene downregulation or vice-versa. Evaluation of temporal concordance is useful if concordance in expression exists. If there is no concordance in expression, temporal concordance is not evaluated. Genes that display concordance with regulatory miRNA in the direction of expression as well as temporal dimension are emphasized.

We obtained a total of 22 stage-salient DMGs from the consensus of Averep, Mvalue, and MethylMix procedures: 1 stage-I salient DMG (VOPP1), 8 stage-II salient DMGs (HS3ST3B1, CPLX1, EGR1, GMDS, ITPKB, TGFB1I1, C6orf145, SHC1), 10 stage-III salient DMGs (BTLA, TNFAIP2, PHYHIPL, LYN, MAML2, C16orf62, GPRC5B, CAPN9, AIPL1, AGAP1), and 4 stage-IV salient DMGs (CNP, TSPYL5, SLC7A5, HCN2). Salient methylation of a gene is an epigenetic mechanism to tune gene expression and would precede changes in its expression. In this respect, the stage-II salient methylation of EGR1 possibly set the stage for its stage-IV salience (minimization) in expression. It is observed that the stage-IV salient hypermethylation of HCN2 was at odds with its stage-IV salient overexpression. Mining the methylation patterns of all stage-salient genes for differential methylation-driven genes revealed five transcriptionally predictive genes negatively correlated with gene expression, namely AKR7A3, COX7A1, DEGS2, EGR1, and FOXA1 ( Figure 6 Table 9 ahead of FIGURE 6 Mixture model of methylation densities, and scatter of expression vs methylation for the respective cluster of each stage-salient differential methylation-driven gene. (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Nine-panel grid showing DNA methylation and gene expression data for various clusters. Panels (a) to (e) display density plots and scatter plots for genes FOXA1, AKR7A3, COX7A1, DEGS2, and EGR1, respectively. Density plots include mixture components highlighted in orange, green, and purple. Scatter plots reveal negatively correlated trends between DNA methylation and gene expression, marked by different colors for mixture components. TABLE 9 Summary of the stage-salient differential methylation-driven genes. Since the methylation of each gene was assayed at a variable number of CpG probe locations, the methylation patterns at different probes for a given gene were clustered based on Pearson’s correlation coefficient cut-off (>0.7). Significant clusters were used to obtain values for: effect size of differential methylation across mixture components, significance of the methylation pattern, coefficient of correlation between expression and methylation, and concordance. Sign of the DM effect signifies the type of aberrant methylation (hyper/ hypo) across the mixture components.

In a recent study, we applied dimensionality reduction and unsupervised learning to the space of nine expression features (viz. NEK2, PKMYT1, MMP11, CPA1, COL10A1, HSD17B13, CA4, MYOC, LYVE1) and addressed the ‘cancer’ vs. ‘normal’ binary classification, producing BrcaDx ( https://apalania.shinyapps.io/BrcaDx Muthamilselvan and Palaniappan, 2023 Figure 2 Taghizadeh et al., 2022 4.1 Literature discussion We searched Pubmed ( www.pubmed.gov W et al., 2012 Subramaniam et al., 1998 Wu et al., 2003 4.1.1 Top genes from linear models Players in cell cycle regulation featured among the top genes of the linear model, namely NEK2, PKYMT1, DEPDC1, KIF4A and CA4. Aberrations in cell cycle regulation facilitate sustained proliferative signalling and evasion of the growth suppressor, which are complementary hallmarks of cancers ( Hanahan, 2022 Croteau et al., 2012 Luong et al., 2022 Arora et al., 2016 Masuda et al., 2012 Ali and Wendt, 2017 Cao et al., 2021 Gu et al., 2019 Wei et al., 2019 Liu and Fang, 2021 Song et al., 2017 The 34 stage-salient candidate biomarkers identified here were cross-referenced with the Human Protein Atlas ( Uhlen et al., 2017 4.1.2 Early-stage salient genes Supplementary File S18 shows the expression distribution of early-stage salient genes in all the TCGA samples grouped by stage. Notice the curved trend in expression signifying salience of expression in an intermediate stage of cancer progression, not the terminal stage. Nicotine in tobacco exerts its action through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which initiate cell proliferation ( Singh et al., 2011 Lam et al., 2007 Zhang et al., 2014 Piskór et al., 2020 Mi et al., 2015 Zhao et al., 2019 L et al., 2019 He et al., 2019 4.1.3 Stage-III salient genes Supplementary File S18 includes the expression distribution of stage-III salient genes in all the TCGA samples grouped by stage. It is known that KCNK15 is overexpressed in BC ( S et al., 2013 Dookeran et al., 2017 Kanda et al., 2016 Tervasmäki et al., 2014 R et al., 2019 V et al., 2014 Makoukji et al., 2015 Margheri et al., 2012 Fu et al., 2019 Blanco et al., 2012 4.1.4 Stage-IV salient genes Supplementary File S18 includes the expression distribution of stage-IV salient genes in all the TCGA samples grouped by stage. A monotonic trend of downregulation culminating in a stage-IV extremum is discernible. Suzuki et al. examined the role of EGR3 in BC and concluded that its overexpression in concert with the expression of other genes is necessary to establish invasive and metastatic BC ( Suzuki et al., 2007 Lu et al., 2005 Bamberger et al., 1999 Chen et al., 2011 Li et al., 2020 Taylor et al., 2008 Seborova et al., 2019 Pampalakis et al., 2014 Lallet-Daher et al., 2013 Zhong et al., 2021 4.2 Improving histological subtyping The distinction between IDC and ILC has previously frustrated learning algorithms. An XGBoost model with 147 clinical, histopathological, mammogram features, and sonographic features has been reported with an internal testset accuracy of 0.84 on the binary classification problem ( Vy et al., 2022 Zeng and Zhang, 2020 Roy et al., 2020 Corso et al., 2018 Li et al., 2011 stacking the classifiers: the ensemble of XGBoost and neural network used herein showed that the classifiers disagree on many instances preventing a consensus classification. In such cases, improvements to the performance tradeoff could be achieved by ‘weighting’ the contribution of the two constituent models to the final prediction. using cross-modal features, including from early integration of multi-omics and spatial dynamics at cellular resolution. 4.3 Commercial gene panels for breast cancer Available genomic assays (commercial or otherwise) for prognosticating breast-cancer adjuvant chemotherapy include the following gene-signature panels: Prosigna (50 genes from PAM50 for intrinsic subtype classification, 8 housekeeping genes used for signal normalisation, 6 positive controls, and 8 negative controls) OncotypeDX (16 cancer related +5 reference gene panel), EndoPredict (3 proliferation-associated genes, 5 hormone receptor-associated genes, 3 reference genes), MammaPrint (70 cancer-related genes; prognostic only) ( van de Vijver et al., 2002 Breast Cancer Index (exploring benefit of extension of adjuvant hormonal therapy beyond 5 years based on a 11-gene signature), HER2DX (exploring benefit of neoadjuvant systemic therapy in HER2+ BC based on a 4-gene signature) ( Prat et al., 2022 Guardant 360 ( Guardant, 2020 Foundation Medicine, 2020 Scanning the signatures in these genomic assays against the ten features used in our ‘normal’ vs. ‘cancer’ model yielded: two genes in common with Prosigna (FOXA1, MMP11), one gene with OncotypeDX (MMP11), one gene with HER2DX (NEK2), and one gene with Breast Cancer Index (NEK2). Scanning these signatures against the 16 features used in our molecular subtyping model yielded: four genes with Prosigna (ERBB2, FOXA1, GRB7, MLPH), four genes with HER2DX (ERBB2, GRB7, STARD3, AGR3), two with OncotypeDX (GRB7 and ERBB2), and two with Guardant360 (ERBB2, GATA3). Scanning these signatures against the 24 features used for histological subtyping yielded: one gene with Guardant360 (CDH1). Scanning these signatures against the five features used in the non-metastatic vs. metastatic model did not identify anything in common. These results indicate that the models developed in this work are novel and deserving of clinical validation. A summary of the existing gene-signature diagnostic tests (with their indications and outcomes) together with a comprehensive comparative study is provided in Supplementary file S19. 4.4 BC-predict To transition the results obtained from our studies, we developed BC-Predict which serves the models developed in a cascade inference engine and provides a comprehensive characterization of the given sample ( Figure 2 Beeley, 2016 https://apalania.shinyapps.io/BC-Predict The metastatic model does not distinguish among the stages in pre-metastatic cancer. A refinement may be necessary to discriminate between the early-stage cancers (stages I and II) and stage-III cancers among the pre-metastatic cancers. The molecular subtype model lumps ‘Luminal A’ and ‘Luminal B’ into the ‘Luminal’ class. Both luminal A and B are HER2-and ER+, however the A subtype is PR+ and the most common molecular subtype comprising 50%–60% of breast cancers whereas the B subtype accounts for 15%–20%, mostly PR- and with low levels of Ki-67. Thus Luminal B has distinctly better prognosis than Luminal A. Increased data size and quality could afford production of better models that differentiate between these subtypes. The ILC histological subtype tends to be radiologically and clinically hard to detect, manifesting more as thickening with occult mammogram rather than mass, hence research is urgent to improve the detection of this class, as discussed above. The identified gene-signature panels could be enhanced with the inclusion of reference gene normalization, for more robust predictions. In addition, all models would need to be fine-tuned for distribution shifts possible in different populations, though the identity of the biomarkers is likely invariant. Initiatives akin to the Indian Cancer Genome Association ( Dixit and Sadanandam, 2021 Gene-signature methods remain the clinical standard for both their effectiveness and utility, and works such as ours are a step forward in resolving difficult challenges. Such diagnostic models need to be clinically validated and approved for use by national regulatory bodies such as the FDA (Food and Drug Administration, USA), MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, UK), EU MDR (European Union Medical Device Regulation), NMPA (National Medical Products Administration, China) and CDSCO (Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, India). Models are complicated by cohort selection bias; for e. g., breast cancer in Black population presents in younger patients and more difficult to treat forms (aggressive, grade-III, TNBC or HER2+) than in Hispanic population, with poorer prognosis. Also, metastatic breast cancer is rarely synchronous (more metachronous) in developed nations as opposed to metastatic cancer on presentation in emerging nations. In addition to these variations, AI-based diagnostic modalities need to contend for the interplay of risk factors that could enable or confound the predictions: pre-menopausal vs. post-menopausal, node-positive or not, complete hormonal profile and NPI score. Clinical validation of BC-Predict would involve the synthesis and use of specific forward and reverse primers for each model feature to perform qRT-PCR on the isolated RNA of resected biopsy sample from a patient.
