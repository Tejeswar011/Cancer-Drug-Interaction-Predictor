In COVID-19, evidence suggests that hyperactivation of the complement system can lead to tissue damage and provoke dysregulation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in vascular damage observed in severe COVID-19. There is still little evidence regarding the role of plasma levels of these molecules in the clinical evolution of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Methods The study included individuals 18 years of age or older with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, admitted to two referral hospitals in the Northeast Region of Brazil between August 2020 and July 2021. Plasma samples were collected within 24 hours of hospital admission. Patients were followed up until discharge, and complications during hospitalization were duly recorded. Plasma levels of the following complement proteins were determined by Luminex: C2, C3, C3b/iC3b, C4, C4b, C5, C5a, MBL, C1q, factor I, factor D, factor B, and factor H. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to correct the results according to possible confounding factors. Results The study included 267 patients (134 critical and 133 severe), with mean ages of 54 and 52 years, respectively. Plasma levels of C2, C5a, factor B, and factor D were significantly higher in patients who required intensive care unit admission, required ventilatory support, developed sepsis, developed cardiorespiratory arrest, or developed acute kidney failure. On the other hand, C4b level was lower in patients who developed complications. Complement proteins were significantly associated with laboratory parameters related to coagulation and kidney function. Conclusion These findings show that the complement system is associated with COVID-19 complications and laboratory parameters of coagulation and kidney function. These results suggest that these molecules may be potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets in the clinical progression of COVID-19.

As of May 1, 2023, more than 753 million cases had been reported worldwide, resulting in more than 6.8 million deaths [ 1 The complement system is an important primary immune defense mechanism against viruses, consisting of a proteolysis-based activation cascade composed of more than forty plasma proteins [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 Although the main function of the complement system in viral infections is to protect the host from invading viruses, complement overactivation also appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Indeed, studies have reported that complement activation was associated with greater disease severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and increased mortality [ 8 16 17 19 Although previous studies have investigated complement system protein levels in COVID-19, they were limited to investigating some individual components in relation to clinical course and susceptibility to infection in small cohorts. In our study, we investigated the association of the components C2, C3, C3b/iC3b, C4, C4b, C5, C5a, MBL, C1q, factor I, factor D, factor B, and factor H with the severity of COVID-19, post-hospitalization complications, and their relationship with laboratory parameters. Methods Study design, location, and target population This is a cross-sectional, analytical study with a quantitative approach. Samples were included from individuals of both sexes, 18 years of age or older, with COVID-19 confirmed by molecular (RT-PCR) or immunological testing, who were hospitalized between August 2020 and July 2021 at the University Hospital of the Universidade Federal do Vale do São Francisco (HU-UNIVASF/EBSERH) and the Field Hospital of the Municipality of Petrolina, both reference centers for the treatment of COVID-19 in the Vale do São Francisco Region, in the city of Petrolina, Pernambuco, located in the Northeast Region of Brazil. Patients were classified as critical when they developed critical disease, whether pulmonary, with high-flow oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure, and intubation), septic shock, or damage to any other organ that required ICU admission. Patients who developed pneumonia, required low-flow oxygen, or were admitted to ward beds were classified as severe. This study received approval from the Ethics Committee of the Hospital das Clínicas of the Federal University of Pernambuco (HC/UFPE) under register number CAAE: 38.196.620.0.0000.8807, and it was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Sample collection and processing Biological Material was collected by the nursing service within 24 h of patient admission, by means of vacuum venipuncture in a tube containing EDTA, and subsequently sent to the HU/UNIVASF Clinical Research Laboratory (LAMUPE). After receipt, the samples were processed, separated into blood, serum, and plasma. They were then stored in refrigerators at − 80 °C until the plasma was used. Complement protein quantification A multiplex assay (Luminex xMAP), based on technology that uses Magnetic beads, was used to determine plasma levels, by means of a commercially available MILLIPLEX MaP Human Complement Panel 1 and 2 kit (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA. Number: HCMP1MAG-19 K) following manufacturer instructions. Concentrations of complement proteins, including C2, C4b, C5, C5a, MBL, factor D and factor I (panel 1), C1q, C3, C3b/iC3b, C4, factor B and factor H (panel 2), were analyzed on a Luminex 200 system, and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was obtained. Statistical analyses The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to verify whether variable distribution was normal. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. Pearson’s chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Spearman’s correlation test was performed to correlate plasma levels and laboratory parameters. Results were presented using a heat Map and network analysis, with strength of correlation coefficients displayed on a color scale. To reduce the risk of bias, the significant results were adjusted for possible confounding factors using a multivariate Logistic regression model. Data were stored and analyzed using JASP 0.18.3 software. Column graphs were constructed using GraphPad Prism software, version 9.0. Results The study included a total of 267 patients: 134 admitted to the ICU and classified as critical and 133 admitted to ward beds and classified as severe. The mean age in the severe group was 52 years; in the critical group it was 54 years ( p p 1 In relation to comorbidities, only the occurrence of obesity was significantly different between the groups, with a prevalence of 28.3% in the critical group versus 15.1% in the severe group ( p p p 1  Table 1 Baseline characteristics and clinical evolution of the patients included in the study Severe COVID-19 N Critical COVID-19 N P Demographic Age, years (mean ± SD) 52.4 ± 14.9 54.1 ± 17.2 0.38 Male, n (%) 81 (60.9) 77 (57.5) 0.57 Female, n (%) 52 (39.1) 57 (42.5) Comorbidities Diabetes mellitus, n (%) 36 (27.2) 49 (36.5) 0.10 Hypertension, n (%) 54 (40.9) 63 (47.0) 0.32 Obesity, n (%) 20 (15.1) 38 (28.3) 0.009 Chronic kidney disease, n (%) 2 (1.5) 6 (4.4) 0.16 Chronic heart disease, n (%) 3 (2.2) 5 (3.7) 0.49 Asthma, n (%) 2 (1.5) 7 (5.2) 0.09 Cancer, n (%) 1 (0.7) 4 (2.9) 0.18 COPD, n (%) 1 (0.7) 4 (2.9) 0.18 Clinical evolution Invasive ventilation, n (%) 0 106 (79.1) < 0.001 Cardiorespiratory arrest, n (%) 0 35 (32.4) < 0.001 Sepsis, n (%) 0 26 (20.1) < 0.001 Acute kidney injury, n (%) 0 43 (32.8) < 0.001 Death, n (%) 0 50 (37.3) < 0.001 Length of stay, days (mean ± SD) 5.8 ± 6.7 15.0 ± 12.1 < 0.001 Legend – Complement system protein levels were assessed from samples collected within 24 h of admission.

In contrast, other coagulation markers such as INR, prothrombin time, and APTT were inversely correlated with the proteins C2, C5a, C1q, C4, in addition to factors B and H. A significant correlation was also observed for creatinine and urea, which are markers of kidney failure, with C2, C5, and factor D (Fig. 7  Fig. 7 Network analysis of complement proteins and laboratory parameters in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

ALT: alanine transaminase; AST: aspartate transaminase; Cr: creatinine; CRP: C-reactive protein; INR: international normalized ratio; MBL: mannose-binding lectin; TBIL: total bilirubin, WBC: white blood cell Discussion Our results suggest that complement proteins play an important role in the clinical course of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. These findings reinforce previous evidence found in European populations and bring new data regarding the dynamics of these proteins and the risk of complications during hospitalization, including outcome, risk of invasive ventilatory support, sepsis, kidney failure, and cardiopulmonary arrest. The complement system plays a complex role in COVID-19. Previous studies have demonstrated activation of the complement system by all three pathways in lung and kidney tissue samples from patients with COVID-19 [ 10 20 MBL2 21 22 23 25 Thus, while the complement system plays a crucial role in combating SARS-CoV-2, especially early in infection, it may also have a deleterious effect by exacerbating inflammation and interacting with the coagulation cascade. This can lead to tissue damage, vascular changes, and thrombosis observed in severe COVID-19 cases [ 26 In this study, we observed that plasma levels of C2, C5a, factor B, and factor D were significantly higher in critical patients, regardless of the severity parameter used, including ICU admission, invasive ventilatory support, cardiopulmonary arrest, and kidney failure. Our findings are consistent with Ma et al. (2021), who also found significant associations between levels of C5a, factor D, factor B, and adverse outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients [ 27 Several previous studies have explored the relationship between complement components and clinical parameters of COVID-19 [ 28 41 43 17 19 Our results also indicate high levels of factor B and factor D in severe clinical conditions. Transcriptome analyses have shown that factor B is one of the complement genes most strongly induced following SARS-CoV-2 infection, and inhibition of factor B significantly reduced C3a production in vitro [ 29 44 27 30 34 In addition to the alternative pathway, our study revealed elevated C1q levels in patients requiring invasive ventilatory support, those who developed sepsis, and those with acute kidney failure. Although this association did not remain statistically significant in multivariate analysis, previous studies, such as Castanha et al. (2022), reported that C1q levels were significantly elevated in severe cases and correlated with higher IgG titers, greater complement activation, and increased disease severity [ 36 C1q, a key initiator of the classical pathway, is activated by antigen-antibody complexes. The intense inflammatory response and immune complex formation in critically ill patients could stimulate C1q production by inflammatory cells, potentially explaining the elevated C2 levels observed in our study. The components C2 and C4 are consumed during activation of the classical and lectin pathways, and compensatory hepatic production may occur to replenish depleted levels. However, findings regarding C1q are conflicting. Alosaimi et al. (2021) found no significant difference in C1q levels between critical and mild COVID-19 cases in a small cohort in Saudi Arabia [ 31 34 Interestingly, we found lower plasma C4b levels in patients who developed severe disease manifestations. This contrasts with previous reports suggesting that fragments of activated complement components would be elevated in severe patients [ 27 33 Beyond assessing associations between complement levels and clinical severity, we also performed a network analysis exploring the interaction between complement components and routine laboratory tests at admission. We found significant correlations between complement proteins and markers of coagulation (platelets, INR, PT and APTT) as well as kidney function (creatinine, urea). The correlation between plasma complement activation and coagulation parameters likely reflects a complex interplay where complement activation, triggered by SARS-CoV-2, promotes endothelial injury, expression of procoagulant factors, and direct interaction with coagulation pathways [ 26 45 46 15 37 47 Our study has several limitations. We did not assess complement activation in tissue samples, which might more accurately reflect local complement activity in response to infection. Nevertheless, the study has important strengths, including the enrollment of unvaccinated patients, a relatively large sample size, and the comprehensive analysis of complement components across all three activation pathways. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, that the complement system is associated with severe clinical outcomes in COVID-19, including the risk of ICU admission, need for invasive ventilatory support, sepsis, cardiorespiratory arrest, acute kidney failure, and death. In addition, we show that complement components correlate with laboratory parameters related to coagulation and kidney function. Together, these results enhance the understanding of how plasma complement levels are linked to clinical and laboratory markers of COVID-19 severity. Our study also suggests that complement proteins may serve as potential biomarkers of disease progression or as therapeutic targets for the treatment of COVID-19. Supplementary Fig. 1.
