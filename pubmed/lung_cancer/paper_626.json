This study aimed to evaluate treatment patterns and disease outcomes in patients with metastatic head and neck ACC. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed with metastatic head and neck ACC between January 2005 and December 2023. Results A total of 51 patients were included in the study, of whom 36 (70.6%) received at least one line of systemic treatment. The median overall survival (OS) for the entire cohort was 29.21 months. Patients with lung metastases had significantly longer OS compared to those without (44.52 vs. 11.04 months, p Conclusion There is no consensus on the optimal treatment approach for metastatic ACC, and therapeutic strategies remain heterogeneous. Patients with lung metastases had better survival outcomes than those with metastases at other sites.

Platinum-based regimens are the most frequently selected treatment for metastatic ACC; however, response rates remain low. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), including sunitinib, sorafenib, dovitinib, lenvatinib, and axitinib, have not shown a substantial improvement in metastatic disease outcomes [ 7 11 12 Method We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving patients diagnosed with metastatic head and neck ACC, who were treated and followed up at two tertiary Hospitals in Ankara, Turkey, between January 2005 and December 2023. The study included patients who Had a diagnosis of ACC of the head and neck, were older than 18 years of age, and had distant metastasis. Patients without metastatic disease, as well as those with extensive locoregional disease without distant metastasis who received palliative systemic therapy due to inoperability, were not included in the analysis. Additionally, patients with missing data for survival analysis were excluded. We extracted demographic information (e.g., age, gender), performance status, date of metastatic disease, treatment date of the last follow-up, and mortality status. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate overall survival (OS) in the entire study population. Secondary objectives were OS and PFS among patients who received systemic therapy for metastatic disease. OS-1 was defined as the time from the date of metastatic disease to the date of death. OS-2 was defined as the time from the beginning date of first-line systemic treatment to the date of death for patients who received at least one line of the systemic treatment. PFS was defined as the time from the beginning date of the treatment to the date of radiologic progression or death. All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24.0 for Mac (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Continuous variables were expressed as medians with Q1-Q3, while categorical variables were presented as percentages. Survival outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. All p-values were two-sided, with statistical significance defined as p Results A total of 51 patients with metastatic head and neck ACC were included in the study. The median age was 50.18 years (Q1: 40.3, Q3: 57.8). Among the patients, 26 (51%) were female, and 31 (62%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0. Only 4 (7.8%) patients Had metastatic disease at diagnosis. Regarding primary tumor sites, 15 (29.4%) originated from the major salivary glands, 13 (25.5%) from the oral cavity and hypopharynx, and 7 (13.7%) from the nasal sinuses.

The most used agents for second-line therapy were single-agent taxanes (7 patients) and TKIs (3 patients received axitinib, 1 lenvatinib, and 1 sunitinib) (Table 2 2 Discussion There is no consensus on the optimal treatment regimen for patients with metastatic head and neck ACC. Despite including two academic centers in this study, a wide variety of treatment regimens were used even in first-line therapy. Further research and collaborative efforts are required to develop and establish standardized treatment protocols. The median OS for metastatic disease was 29.21 months for the entire cohort, while it was 26.78 months in patients who received systemic treatment. This difference may be attributed to baseline imbalances, as patients selected for systemic therapy often present with more symptomatic disease, greater tumor burden are not candidates for metastasectomy. Furthermore, adenoid cystic carcinoma is typically an indolent malignancy, and currently available systemic treatments have demonstrated limited efficacy with low objective response rates. These factors, combined with the retrospective design, underscore the need for cautious interpretation of the results. In our cohort, platinum-based combination therapies were the most frequently used regimen in first-line treatment (21/36, 58.3%), while single-agent taxanes were the most frequently used in second-line treatment (7/24, 29.2%) and TKIs in third-line treatment (8/14, 57.1%). Median OS with first line treatment was 26.78 months. The median PFS was 5.53, 6.11, and 4.53 months for the first, second and third lines of the treatment, respectively. Disease progression was the primary reason for treatment discontinuation across all three lines of therapy. The PFS and OS values in our study are consistent with those reported in previous chemotherapy studies. CAP is the most studied combination therapy, but the studies included a small number of patients [ 13 15 14 16 16 19 In patients with metastatic ACC, anti-VEGF TKIs serve as an alternative treatment option besides chemotherapy. The phase II trial of sorafenib included patients, nearly Half of whom Had received prior systemic treatment. The ORR was 11%, while the median PFS and median OS were 11.3 and 19.6 months, respectively. Two phase II trials investigated the efficacy of axitinib in patients with recurrent or metastatic ACC. The first trial, which included patients who experienced disease progression within 6 months, reported an ORR of 9.1% and a median PFS of 5.7 months [ 8 20 7 In our cohort, better OS was observed in patients with lung metastases compared to those without lung metastases (44.52 vs. 11.04 months, p 4 21 22 7 8 23 Given the modest efficacy of existing treatments for metastatic ACC, there is a pressing need for more effective therapeutic options. Several trials are now underway to evaluate the effects of different medications. There are ongoing trials evaluating the effects of stereotactic body radiotherapy for the early treatment of oligometastatic ACC ( NCT04883671 NCT04974866 NCT06118086 NCT04209660 NCT06322576 Our study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, its retrospective design is subject to inherent biases, including selection bias and missing data, which may have influenced the outcomes. Second, the small sample size limited our ability to conduct additional analyses for prognostic factors and multivariate analysis to eliminate potential confounding factors. Third, despite including only two centers, treatment approaches were heterogeneous, which prevents us from providing consistent survival outcomes and assessing radiologic response rates specific to particular therapies, due to variability in imaging follow-up intervals and treatment protocols. Lastly, due to the retrospective nature of our study and the inclusion of patients treated over an extended time span, we were unable to report toxicity data. In conclusion, there is no consensus on the treatment of metastatic ACC, and therapeutic approaches remain heterogeneous, largely depending on the physician's preference. Disease prognosis can be estimated based on metastatic sites, with patients having lung metastases showing better survival outcomes. There is a need for more clearly defined criteria for initiating treatment and more standardized therapeutic approaches. To achieve this, further studies are required to develop biomarkers that can identify patients who may benefit from treatment and to determine prognostic factors that can guide clinical decision-making.
