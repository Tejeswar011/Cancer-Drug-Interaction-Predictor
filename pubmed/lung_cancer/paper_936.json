However, the potential additional protective effects of ezetimibe remain unclear in real-world settings. This study investigated whether statin/ezetimibe combination therapy provided further cancer risk reduction beyond statin monotherapy. Methods A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. Patients with dyslipidemia (total cholesterol ≥ 240 mg/dL) diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 were included and categorized into statin users, statin/ezetimibe users, and nonusers. Cancer incidence over 5- and 10-year follow-up periods was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographic, clinical, and lifestyle factors. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to account for potential confounders, and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the stability of the findings. Results Among 68,353 patients, 9,267 were statin users, 383 were statin/ezetimibe users, and 58,703 were nonusers. Statin users exhibited a reduced cancer risk at 5 years (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80–0.89) and 10 years (aHR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.87–0.94). Statin/ezetimibe users demonstrated a greater reduction in cancer risk (5 years: aHR, 0.30; 95% CI 0.28–0.32; 10 years: aHR, 0.70; 95% CI 0.67–0.73). Trend analysis confirmed an incremental trend in cancer risk reduction with increasing lipid-lowering therapy intensity ( P Conclusion This real-world study suggests that ezetimibe, when combined with statins, is associated with additional cancer risk reduction beyond statin monotherapy, as observed across both overall and direct comparative analyses. Further research is warranted to confirm the independent effects of ezetimibe and its potential role in cancer prevention.

Some studies suggest that ezetimibe may play a role in cancer prevention and treatment, particularly in cancers associated with high Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) expression (Gu et al. 2022 2021 2021 2021 Despite growing evidence supporting the potential cancer-preventive effects of lipid-lowering therapies, the additional benefits of ezetimibe when combined with statins remain unclear, particularly in population-based cohorts reflecting actual treatment patterns. Therefore, this study emulated a target trial using real-world data to examine the association between statin use and cancer risk over 5- and 10-year follow-up periods to validate its protective effects, then assessed whether adding ezetimibe further reduced cancer incidence. Using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), a large, nationally representative cohort from South Korea, cancer incidence rates were analyzed among patients with dyslipidemia, identified based on their total cholesterol levels and other clinical criteria. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were applied to adjust for potential confounders such as age, sex, and comorbidities. Methods Data source NHIS is a universal health insurance system for all Koreans that covers 97% of the population (Kim et al. 2020 2017 2008 Study design and population To determine the long-term effects of ezetimibe in combination with statin therapy on cancer incidence, a target trial was emulated using data from the NHIS-HEALS, a nationally representative cohort in South Korea. This approach reduces bias inherent in observational studies by defining key trial components (eTable 1) (Matthews et al. 2022 To define medication exposure while avoiding immortal time bias, a fixed administrative index date (January 1, 2008; January 1, 2010; or January 1, 2012) was assigned to each participant based on the timing of dyslipidemia diagnosis. For example, participants diagnosed between 2004 and 2006 were evaluated for lipid-lowering medication use during the subsequent two-year window (2006–2007), and their follow-up for cancer incidence began on January 1, 2008. Medication exposure was thus fully determined before the start of follow-up. The use of two-year intervals reflects the biennial schedule of Korea’s national health screening program, ensuring alignment between drug exposure and baseline health status. Participants were grouped into 5- or 10-year follow-up cohorts starting from their respective index dates. If participants overlapped within the same follow-up period, the latest available health screening data were used as the baseline. The same strategy was applied to non-users (individuals who received no lipid-lowering medications), who were identified from the same screening population and assigned index dates based on their dyslipidemia diagnosis period. This design ensured temporal comparability across groups and emulated a target trial framework with clearly defined baseline, treatment assignment, and follow-up protocols (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Flow diagram for the inclusion of the study population Exclusion criteria were applied to ensure a newly diagnosed dyslipidemia cohort. Participants were excluded if they had a history of lipid-lowering medication use prior to the index date (n = 19,142), a prior cancer diagnosis (n = 5932), a follow-up duration of less than 6 months (n = 1322), or missing covariate information (n = 4208). Unlike studies that focus on highly selective populations, the study did not impose additional exclusions beyond prior cancer diagnosis. This approach allows the findings to reflect real-world clinical practice, where patients with dyslipidemia often present with multiple comorbidities and diverse treatment histories. By including a broad patient population, the present research provides a more generalizable assessment of the long-term effects of lipid-lowering therapy on cancer risk. After these exclusions, 68,353 eligible individuals were included in the analysis cohort (Fig. 1 Study participants were classified into three groups according to lipid-lowering medication use: nonusers (no medication, non-lipid-lowering drug users), statin users (statin monotherapy), and statin/ezetimibe users (combination therapy). In addition to this three-group classification, participants were also categorized as lipid-lowering drug users (statin or statin/ezetimibe therapy) and nonusers to assess whether the absence of lipid-lowering therapy was associated with a higher risk of cancer. Two primary comparisons were performed to evaluate associations with cancer risk: lipid-lowering drug users vs. nonusers, statin users vs. nonusers, and statin/ezetimibe users vs. statin/ezetimibe nonusers (a heterogeneous group including both statin users and nonusers). This comparison strategy was employed to reflect real-world treatment patterns and evaluate the potential impact of ezetimibe in a clinical setting. Unlike randomized controlled trials (RCTs), where treatment allocation is randomized, observational studies must account for variability in treatment selection. In routine clinical practice, patients with dyslipidemia receive statin monotherapy or combination therapy with ezetimibe depending on cardiovascular risk and cholesterol levels. Accordingly, comparing statin/ezetimibe users with a broader group of patients who did not receive ezetimibe provided a more representative assessment of treatment effects in actual clinical practice. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Busan University Hospital (No. 04-2023-001). Exposures Lipid-lowering medication usage was defined on the basis of the prescription records of statin-only and statin/ezetimibe during the designated two-year exposure period. The duration of prescription records for each lipid-lowering medication was summed. If the total number of prescribed days was greater than 120, the patient was defined as either statin or statin/ezetimibe users according to the lipid-lowering medication. If any lipid-lowering medication was prescribed with a ≥ 90-day interval, the event was not counted as medication usage. In addition, those who were prescribed any lipid-lowering medication for more than 90 days were excluded from the analysis. The lipid-lowering medications (statin or statin/ezetimibe) that were used for the study are listed in eTable 1–3, respectively. If any participant was defined both as a statin and a statin/ezetimibe user, the participant was regarded as a statin/ezetimibe user. Outcomes The primary outcome was any diagnosis of cancer during hospitalization, defined by an ICD-10 code (International Classification of Diseases-10 code, C code). The secondary outcomes were defined as any diagnosis of colorectal (C18–C20), gastric (C16), pancreatic (C25), or lung cancer (C33–C34) during hospitalization, as defined by the ICD-10 codes. Each outcome was assessed for 5-year and 10-year follow-up periods from the designated index date through the exposure period. Patients who were previously diagnosed with cancer were excluded from the analysis. Key variables Key variables were identified at the time of dyslipidemia diagnosis. Baseline information for age, sex, total cholesterol, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), household income, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, fasting serum glucose, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and medical history (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and comorbidities) was evaluated. Serum total cholesterol levels were measured via enzymatic methods. MVPA was measured by the summed frequency of moderate (e.g., jogging, tennis) or vigorous physical activity (e.g., cycling, running) per week. Consequently, it was categorized into four levels as follows: 0, 1–2, 3–4, or ≥ 5 episodes of MVPA per week, which has been used in previous studies (Lim et al. 2023b 2 2 2 2 2023 2024 2023 2017 2023a 2011 Statistical analysis To evaluate the association between lipid-lowering medication use and cancer risk, descriptive statistics were first computed. Continuous variables were presented as the mean (standard deviation [SD]), and categorical variables were expressed as n (%). The 5-year and 10-year cumulative cancer incidence was initially assessed using Kaplan–Meier survival curves, and differences between groups were evaluated using the log-rank test. These analyses were conducted without statistical adjustments to reflect real-world treatment patterns. However, baseline differences between treatment groups necessitated further statistical adjustment to account for potential confounding and improve comparability between groups. Since lipid-lowering medication use was not randomly assigned, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to balance baseline characteristics. IPTW was used to create a pseudo population by assigning participants weights corresponding to the inverse of their treatment likelihood based on covariates (Chesnaye et al. 2022 2011 2017 2021 2022 2021 To compare cancer risk across the three treatment groups (nonusers, statin users, and statin/ezetimibe users), adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to preserve real-world treatment distributions. To further assess the independent contribution of ezetimibe, an additional comparison was conducted between statin/ezetimibe users and statin-only users. This focused analysis aimed to isolate the additive benefit of ezetimibe beyond statin therapy. Site-specific cancer risks were also evaluated between these two groups. Subgroup analyses were conducted by stratifying patients according to age (40–60 years, ≥ 60 years), sex (men, women), household income (lower half, upper half), cigarette smoking status (non-, ex-, and current smokers), alcohol consumption status (yes, no), and score (0, 1, ≥ 2). A P Results Baseline characteristics A total of 68,353 dyslipidemia patients without prior lipid-lowering medication use were included from the NHIS-HEALS database: 9,267 statin users, 383 statin/ezetimibe users, and 58,703 nonusers (Table 1 1 Table 1 Descriptive characteristics of the study participants Lipid-lowering drug usage after dyslipidemia diagnosis Nonusers Statin users Statin/ezetimibe users Age, years 59.0 (8.2) 58.2 (8.8) 59.7 (8.5) Sex, n (%) Men 28,735 (49.0) 3790 (40.9) 169 (44.1) Women 29,968 (51.1) 5477 (59.1) 214 (55.9) Total cholesterol, mg/dL 259.5 (21.7) 265.1 (26.1) 269.8 (29.4) MVPA, n (%) Physically inactive 29,978 (51.1) 4648 (50.2) 199 (52.0) 1–2 times MVPA/week 19,897 (33.9) 3162 (34.1) 124 (32.4) 3–4 times MVPA/week 6219 (10.6) 1077 (11.6) 45 (11.8) ≥ 5 times MVPA/week 2609 (4.4) 380 (4.1) 15 (3.9) Household income, n (%) Lower half 21,132 (36.0) 3324 (35.9) 114 (29.8) Upper half 37,571 (64.0) 5943 (64.1) 269 (70.2) Body mass index, kg/m 2 < 18.5 8 (2.1) 713 (1.2) 58 (0.6) 18.5–23 106 (27.7) 17,694 (30.1) 2385 (25.7) 23–25 120 (31.3) 17,109 (29.2) 2595 (28.0) ≥ 25 149 (38.9) 23,187 (39.5) 4229 (45.6) Systolic blood pressure, mmHg 127.3 (16.4) 131.0 (17.2) 130.9 (17.1) Diastolic blood pressure, mmHg 81.3 (11.4) 81.2 (11.2) 81.3 (11.4) Triglyceride, mg/dL 134.0 (81.4) 138.0 (105.3) 121.8 (74.5) Fasting blood glucose, mg/dL 106.2 (34.6) 108.5 (38.2) 101.2 (28.7) Alcohol consumption, n (%) Yes 23,330 (39.7) 3190 (34.4) 127 (33.2) No 35,373 (60.3) 6077 (65.6) 256 (66.8) Cigarette smoking, n (%) Nonsmoker 41,750 (71.1) 7023 (75.8) 285 (74.4) Ex-smoker 6013 (10.2) 855 (9.2) 33 (8.6) Current smoker 10,940 (18.6) 1389 (15.0) 65 (17.0) Hypertension, n (%) 26,740 (45.6) 6754 (72.9) 274 (71.5) Diabetes, n (%) 6698 (11.4) 2170 (23.4) 87 (22.7) Charlson Comorbidity Index, n (%) 0 24,419 (41.6) 1834 (41.6) 72 (18.8) 1 15,483 (26.4) 2069 (22.3) 71 (18.5) ≥ 2 18,801 (32.0) 5364 (57.9) 240 (62.7) MVPA, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity; NHIS, National Health Insurance Service Initial real-world assessment of cumulative cancer incidence To assess visual differences in cumulative cancer incidence among treatment groups, an initial evaluation was conducted without statistical adjustments, reflecting real-world treatment patterns (Fig. 2 P P 2 P 2 P 2 Fig. 2 Kaplan–Meier curves for cumulative cancer incidence over 5- and 10-year follow-up periods by lipid-lowering medication use. a b c d P P a b P c P d Broad comparison of cancer risk by lipid-lowering drug use While the initial real-world assessment of cumulative cancer incidence provided insight into treatment patterns without statistical adjustments, baseline differences between groups required further analysis using IPTW-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models (eTable 4–6). These models allowed for a more balanced comparison between treatment groups. Individuals who did not use statins or statin/ezetimibe had a significantly higher risk of cancer incidence compared to lipid-lowering drug users. Over the 5-year follow-up period, nonusers exhibited an increased overall cancer risk (aHR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.16–1.28), and this elevated risk persisted at 10 years (aHR, 1.12; 95% CI 1.08–1.16) (Table 2 Table 2 Higher risk of 5-year and 10-year incident cancer in nonusers compared with lipid-lowering drug users Lipid-lowering medication Event/total Person-year Crude rate/1000PY Before IPTW After IPTW Age-adjusted HR Multivariable-adjusted HR a Age-adjusted HR Multivariable-adjusted HR a Nonusers (vs. lipid-lowering drug users) 5-year incident cancer 3138/58703 283,793 11.1 1.17 (1.07–1.29) c 1.22 (1.10–1.35) d 1.23 (1.17–1.29) d 1.22 (1.16–1.28) d 10-year incident cancer 4695/44513 388,930 12.1 1.08 (1.00–1.17) b 1.12 (1.03–1.21) c 1.13 (1.09–1.17) d 1.12 (1.08–1.16) d Patients with dyslipidemia were classified as using lipid-lowering medication if they used the medication for more than 120 days within 2 years following diagnosis.

If any lipid-lowering medication was used before the diagnosis of dyslipidemia within 2 years, the study participants were excluded.

In the IPTW-based analysis, statin users exhibited a lower risk of overall cancer incidence compared to nonusers, with a reduced risk observed at both 5 years (aHR, 0.84; 95% CI 0.80–0.89) and 10 years (aHR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.87–0.94) (Table 3 Table 3 Lower risk of 5-year and 10-year incident cancer in statin or statin/ezetimibe users compared with respective nonusers Lipid-lowering medication Event/total Person-year Crude rate/1000PY Before IPTW After IPTW Age-adjusted HR Multivariable-adjusted HR a Age-adjusted HR Multivariable-adjusted HR a Statin users (vs. nonusers) 5-year incident cancer 459/9352 45,379 10.1 0.87(0.79–0.96) d 0.84 (0.76–0.93) d 0.84 (0.80–0.88) d 0.84 (0.80–0.89) d 10-year incident cancer 796/7641 67,372 11.8 0.93 (0.87–1.01) 0.91 (0.84–0.98) b 0.90 (0.87–0.93) d 0.91 (0.87–0.94) d Statin/ezetimibe users (vs. statin/ezetimibe nonusers) 5-year incident cancer 10/383 1872 5.3 0.48 (0.26–0.89) b 0.46 (0.24–0.85) b 0.30 (0.28–0.32) d 0.30 (0.28–0.32) d 10-year incident cancer 29/312 2783 10.4 0.37 (0.59–1.22) 0.82 (0.57–1.18) 0.66 (0.63–0.69) d 0.70 (0.67–0.73) d Patients with dyslipidemia were classified as using lipid-lowering medication if they used the medication for more than 120 days within 2 years following diagnosis.

The protective effect persisted at 10 years, though with a slightly attenuated association (aHR, 0.70; 95% CI 0.67–0.73) (Table 3 In the primary IPTW-based analysis, both statin and statin/ezetimibe users exhibited significantly lower cancer risk compared to their respective comparison groups. However, in the comparison between statin/ezetimibe users and statin/ezetimibe nonusers, residual imbalance remained for sex (SMD = 0.15) and total cholesterol (SMD = 0.13) despite IPTW adjustment (eTable 5), both of which are variables closely related to treatment decisions in clinical practice. To address this residual confounding, additional sensitivity analyses were conducted using greedy nearest-neighbor matching. The results were consistent with the primary analyses and showed a lower cancer risk in both statin and statin/ezetimibe users (eTable 9). Cancer risk associated with adding ezetimibe to statin therapy To explore the potential incremental benefits of adding ezetimibe to statin therapy on cancer risk in a real-world setting, cancer incidence was assessed using an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model across treatment groups: nonusers, statin-only users, and statin plus ezetimibe users (Table 4 P P Table 4 Hazard ratios for 5-year and 10-year cumulative cancer incidence according to lipid-lowering medication usage Cancer incidence Lipid-lowering medication Statin/ezetimibe users Statin users Non-lipid-lowering drug users P 5-year incident cancer 0.44 (0.24–0.82) c 0.84 (0.75–0.92) d 1.00 (reference) < .001 0.52 (0.28–0.97) b 1.00 (reference) – 0.04 10-year incident cancer 0.81 (0.56–1.16) 0.90 (0.83–0.97) c 1.00 (reference) 0.04 0.89 (0.61–1.29) 1.00 (reference) – 0.53 HR, hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval a b P c P d P To supplement these findings and more precisely evaluate the added benefit of ezetimibe, statin/ezetimibe users were compared with statin-only users. As shown in Table 4 P Subgroup analyses (eTable 11 and 12) showed a general trend of reduced cancer risk across most subgroups, particularly in individuals aged ≥ 60 years and those in the upper-income half. In the statin/ezetimibe user group, lower cancer incidence was consistently observed in older adults, males, higher-income individuals, and nonsmokers over both 5- and 10-year follow-ups. Among statin users, the protective association was stronger in females, nonsmokers, nondrinkers, and individuals with a CCI ≥ 2. While a trend toward greater cancer risk reduction with more intensive lipid-lowering therapy was observed ( P Discussion Dysregulated cholesterol metabolism is associated with increased cancer risk and poor prognosis. Statins and ezetimibe, which lower cholesterol through distinct mechanisms, have been explored for their potential role in cancer prevention. While statins have been widely studied, fewer investigations have assessed ezetimibe, particularly in real-world settings. This study examines whether adding ezetimibe to statin therapy further reduces cancer incidence over 5- and 10-year follow-up periods in a nationwide cohort of dyslipidemia patients. To evaluate the potential protective effects of ezetimibe on cancer incidence, the first analysis utilized Kaplan–Meier survival curves to explore unadjusted differences in cumulative cancer incidence, reflecting real-world treatment patterns. While statin monotherapy did not show a significant association with reduced cancer incidence, statin/ezetimibe combination therapy appeared to have a short-term protective effect that was not sustained over time (Fig. 2 To provide a more robust assessment of the relationship between lipid-lowering therapy and cancer risk, IPTW adjustment was applied to balance baseline characteristics between treatment groups. The analysis demonstrated that individuals who did not receive lipid-lowering therapy had a significantly higher incidence of cancer compared to those who did (Table 2 3 . 2021 2008 2005 2023 2005 2011 2006 2007 Several large-scale trials have examined the role of ezetimibe in cardiovascular disease prevention, with cancer incidence assessed as a secondary outcome. The Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) trial initially raised concerns about a potential increase in cancer risk among ezetimibe users, but subsequent analyses incorporating data from the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) and Improved Reduction of Outcomes Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) trials found no significant association between ezetimibe use and cancer incidence (Green et al. 2014 2008 2022 2015 2017 2 While these findings suggest a potential protective effect associated with the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy, methodological considerations remain. Although IPTW achieved acceptable balance in most covariates, residual imbalance persisted for sex and total cholesterol in the comparison between statin/ezetimibe users and nonusers. This likely reflects real-world treatment patterns, as ezetimibe is often selectively prescribed to patients with uncontrolled cholesterol levels or statin intolerance, and sex influences cardiovascular risk and treatment decisions. Because these variables are closely related to treatment assignment, complete covariate balance may be difficult to achieve through weighting alone. The relatively small number of statin/ezetimibe users may have further limited balance. Nevertheless, consistent results from additional matching-based sensitivity analyses support the validity of the observed association between ezetimibe use and reduced cancer risk. To determine whether ezetimibe provided additional protective effects beyond those of statin monotherapy, a trend analysis was performed, revealing a statistically significant dose-dependent reduction in cancer incidence associated with lipid-lowering medication use (Table 3 Importantly, while the initial comparison between statin/ezetimibe users and statin/ezetimibe nonusers demonstrated a statistically significant benefit at both 5 and 10 years, this design does not allow for direct isolation of the effect of ezetimibe, as the comparison group included both statin users and nonusers. This strategy was chosen to reflect real-world treatment patterns in South Korea during the early phase of ezetimibe adoption. Although ezetimibe was approved in South Korea around 2005, its clinical uptake remained limited for several years. According to national registry data, ezetimibe was prescribed in only 4.5% of dyslipidemic patients in 2016 and 12.8% in 2019 (Oh et al. 2024 Several mechanisms may explain the cancer risk reduction associated with lipid-lowering therapy, including anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects. Dysregulated cholesterol metabolism contributes to cancer progression by promoting tumor cell survival and metastasis. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, which reduces intracellular cholesterol synthesis and disrupts lipid raft formation involved in oncogenic signaling (Garcia-Ruiz et al. 2012 2015 1996 2022 2015 2017 2023 This study offers several notable strengths in this area of research. First, the present study is the first to investigate long-term outcomes by comparing the associations between the use of lipid-lowering drugs, including statins, the combination of statins and ezetimibe, and incident cancer risk. While previous studies have examined the relationship between statins and cancer risk, few have assessed the impact of statin/ezetimibe combination therapy on long-term cancer incidence. Following the SEAS trial, many researchers sought to explore the potential link between ezetimibe and increased cancer risk. Subsequent follow-up studies demonstrated no association between ezetimibe and increased cancer risk. The finding of the present study demonstrated that combining statins and ezetimibe offers a greater cancer risk-lowering effect than statin use alone, highlighting the potential benefits of combination therapy. Second, the study utilizes real-world data from the Korean NHIS database, which provides a comprehensive and representative dataset for evaluating lipid-lowering therapy effects in actual clinical settings. Unlike RCTs, which often involve selective patient populations with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria, real-world data based studies reflect real-world treatment patterns and adherence behaviors. This approach enhances the external validity of our findings and increases their applicability to routine clinical practice. Third, the large-scale NHIS dataset includes a broad and diverse population, covering a wide range of demographic and clinical characteristics. This allows for a more representative assessment of lipid-lowering therapy effects across different patient subgroups, including those with varying baseline risks for cancer. The ability to analyze a heterogeneous population strengthens the generalizability of our findings. Fourth, this study benefits from a long-term follow-up period of up to 10 years, which enables a comprehensive evaluation of cancer risk over time. Many prior studies have focused on short-term outcomes, whereas our analysis accounts for both 5-year and 10-year cumulative cancer incidence. This extended observation period provides valuable insights into the potential long-term protective effects of lipid-lowering therapy against cancer. However, this study has several limitations that should be considered. First, this study relied on observational data to examine the association between lipid-lowering medication use and cancer incidence, which introduces the possibility of unmeasured confounding and imbalances across treatment groups. For example, drug intensity could not be evaluated, as the dataset only included information on prescription frequency, not on dosage or pharmacologic strength. These limitations make it difficult to evaluate whether higher drug intensity leads to greater cancer risk reduction and to directly compare treatment effects between groups. Second, although the study provides long-term follow-up data of up to 10 years, the relatively small number of cancer cases among statin/ezetimibe users limited the statistical power. This reflects the low adoption of combination therapy during the study period in South Korea. To minimize potential biases and improve comparability, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied. Nevertheless, the limited sample size remains a key constraint in interpreting certain secondary outcomes. Third, cancer-specific risk factors such as Helicobacter pylori infection, family history, or adenoma history were not available or could not be reliably defined using the NHIS-HEALS database, which may have led to residual confounding in site-specific analyses. However, the absence of these variables was consistent across all study groups, which likely minimized the risk of differential bias. Furthermore, avoiding the inclusion of variables that are inconsistently measured or poorly defined may have helped preserve analytical consistency and reduce the risk of misclassification-related bias. Forth, the long latency period of cancer development limits the ability of a 5- to 10-year follow-up to fully assess the long-term effects of treatment on cancer risk. However, similar follow-up durations have been commonly adopted in previous pharmacoepidemiologic studies on lipid-lowering agents, including statins (Chen et al. 2023 2015 Conclusion In conclusion, this real-world study suggests that adding ezetimibe to statin therapy may be associated with a further reduction in cancer risk compared to individuals not receiving ezetimibe. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating lipid-lowering therapy in real-world settings, where treatment decisions reflect actual clinical practice. Further studies are needed to confirm the role of ezetimibe in cancer prevention across diverse populations and to explore its underlying biological mechanisms.
