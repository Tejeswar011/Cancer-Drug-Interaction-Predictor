EBV is a recognized oncogenic driver, whereas COVID-19 may heighten cancer risk by immunological dysregulation, persistent inflammation, and reactivation of latent viruses. We underscore molecular similarities (e.g., NF-κB activation, T-cell exhaustion) and clinical ramifications for high-risk individuals, stressing the necessity for interdisciplinary research to alleviate dual viral risks. EBV, a well-known oncogenic virus, has been linked to numerous malignancies, including lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric cancer. Through the production of viral proteins that interfere with immune evasion, cellular signaling, and genomic integrity, it encourages malignant transformation and ultimately results in unchecked cell proliferation. Because of its capacity to induce tissue damage, immunological dysregulation, and chronic inflammation, COVID-19, which is brought on by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has become a possible carcinogen. The virus’s influence on cellular pathways and its long-term effects on the immune system may raise the chance of malignancy, particularly in people with pre-existing vulnerabilities, even if direct correlations to cancer are still being investigated. When two viruses co-infect a host, the review highlights the possibility of synergistic effects that could hasten the development of cancer. It describes how overlapping mechanisms like inflammation, immune suppression, and viral reactivation may be used by a combined EBV and COVID-19 infection to exacerbate carcinogenic processes. Gaining an understanding of these relationships is essential for creating tailored treatment plans and enhancing cancer prevention in high-risk groups.

Introduction Viral infections are estimated to be the cause of a significant portion of cancers worldwide, accounting for 15% of all malignancies. Oncogenic viruses are those that can cause cancer among the various types of viruses [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Table 1 14 15 16 17 18 19 The purpose of this review is to investigate how EBV and COVID-19 interact to cause cancer. With COVID-19’s new but potentially important long-term consequences and EBVs well-established role in cancer, it seeks to illustrate the ways in which both viral infections contribute to carcinogenesis. This review aims to improve knowledge of how both viruses may hasten the development of cancer by investigating the possible synergistic effects of co-infection through overlapping processes such as immune suppression, chronic inflammation, and viral reactivation. The review concludes by highlighting the significance of further investigation into how these viruses affect cancer in order to guide treatment plans and enhance cancer prevention, especially in high-risk groups. The SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the inflammasome, which is a significant source of inflammation. This can cause chronic inflammation and post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), commonly known as “long COVID”. Prolonged inflammation can worsen immunological dysregulation and lead to neurological harm, such as demyelination of brain cells and disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) [ 38 39 Figure 1 40 41 42 43 The importance of addressing viral infections in oncology research is highlighted by this study, which examines the complex roles of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and COVID-19 in cancer development, highlighting their mechanisms in promoting carcinogenesis. EBV, a known oncogenic virus, has been linked to a number of cancers, including lymphomas, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric cancer, while COVID-19 has been linked to influencing cancer progression through immune dysregulation and inflammatory responses. The study shows how both infections can disrupt cellular processes, leading to tumorigenesis. By examining their shared and distinct pathways, the study hopes to identify potential therapeutic targets. This narrative review synthesizes current literature on EBV and COVID-19’s interplay in cancer, focusing on mechanistic overlaps (e.g., immune evasion, chronic inflammation) and clinical implications. We highlight seminal studies (2019–2023) to explore hypotheses like EBV reactivation post-COVID-19 and its oncogenic synergy. 2. EBV and Cancer EBV persists latently in B-cells, evading immune detection. Reactivation during immunosuppression (e.g., COVID-19) drives oncogenesis by immortalizing B-cells, inhibiting apoptosis, and causing genomic instability [ 29 EBV, which is usually transmitted by saliva, is frequently acquired during childhood or adolescence and can result in infectious mononucleosis, also referred to as “mono” or the “kissing disease”. Under some circumstances, EBV targets and infects B-cells selectively, integrating its viral genome into these cells and laying the groundwork for possible oncogenic (cancer-causing) processes [ 19 30 31 32 Furthermore, the interaction between EBV and the host’s immune system raises the risk of virus-associated cancers, especially in immunocompromised people. Research on the processes by which EBV changes from a latent infection to an active cause of oncogenesis is still crucial since it provides information about possible treatment targets and prophylactic measures. Additionally, in recent years, there has been a growing interest in the connection between EBV and autoimmune illnesses. Research has indicated a possible connection between EBV infection and the onset of diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [ 33 34 35 36 Immunotherapeutic Advances in EBV-Associated Cancers Immunotherapeutic Advances in EBV-Associated Cancers Recent breakthroughs have revolutionized treatment for EBV-driven malignancies, particularly nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and lymphomas, by targeting viral immune evasion mechanisms ( Figure 1 Table 2 Meanwhile, LMP1 functions as an oncoprotein, imitating specific cellular receptors to promote cell proliferation and survival. LMP1 stimulates critical pathways such as *NF-κB* and *JAK/STAT*, promoting cell proliferation, preventing apoptosis, and increasing invasiveness of infected cells. LMP1 also promotes the expression of angiogenic factors and inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a favorable milieu for tumor growth. Its capacity to activate these pathways highlights LMP1s function in altering infected B cells and promoting the advancement of EBV-associated malignancies [ 44 45 46 Figure 2 19 47 48 49 3. SARS-CoV-2 Entry Mechanisms and Their Effect on Host Cell Functions in COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the globe, leading to a global health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus from the coronavirus family, characterized by its spike (S) protein, which plays a key role in the virus’s ability to enter human cells. The virus primarily targets respiratory epithelial cells, although it can also affect other organs such as the heart, kidneys, and intestines [ 50 51 52 Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 50 53 54 55 56 57 SARS-CoV-2 first facilitates entrance and replication by binding to ACE2 receptors on infected cells. Cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 are released as a result, causing tissue damage and starting the inflammatory signaling process. Neutrophils and macrophages are activated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which results in the creation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) ( Figure 3 43 67 68 69 4. Potential Cancer Links of COVID-19 The correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer risk is complex and under active investigation. COVID-19 can influence cancer formation and progression by both direct viral actions and indirect mechanisms such as immune system dysfunction and chronic inflammation. Chronic inflammation in long COVID, characterized by increased IL-6, TNF-α, and inflammasome activation, resembles pro-tumorigenic microenvironments; nevertheless, direct data connecting long COVID to de novo cancer start is scarce. Present hypotheses concentrate on extended immunological dysregulation (e.g., T-cell depletion) facilitating latent EBV reactivation. DNA damage induced by inflammation in chronically infected tissues. In patients with long COVID, continuous inflammatory reactions may raise the chance of developing cancer over time, particularly through the accumulation of cellular damage and disrupted tissue homeostasis [ 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 43 81 82 83 These viruses may become more carcinogenic in infected people if they reactivate. Similar to this, changes in the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself, namely in immune-modulating proteins, may also change how the virus interacts with host immune systems, which could lead to the development of tumors. Although research into these pathways is ongoing, there is growing worry that the viral infection and the ensuing dysregulation of the immune system may cause new cancers to develop or hasten the course of already existing ones [ 83 84 85 86 87 Figure 4 88 89 90 91 SARS-CoV-2’s systemic disturbances and immune suppression may make it more difficult for the body to regulate tumor growth in people who have already received cancer treatment. SARS-CoV-2 can sometimes accelerate the development of malignancies that were stable or in remission before the infection. Additionally, failure to continue cancer therapies during acute infection or recuperation may result in adverse consequences, such as the advancement or recurrence of the disease [ 35 92 93 94 95 5. Dual Threat of EBV and COVID-19 in Cancer Development: The Synergistic Effects A well-known oncogenic virus, EBV is closely linked to the emergence of certain cancers, such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and Burkitt’s lymphoma. Concerns have been raised by recent research on the possible synergistic effects of EBV and COVID-19, especially in immunocompromised people like transplant recipients or patients with chronic COVID. Periods of immunosuppression have been shown to cause EBV reactivation, and COVID-19 infection may function as a catalyst for latent EBV reactivation, raising the risk of virally induced malignancies [ 14 22 96 97 98 40 99 100 101 Moreover, significant alterations in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been linked to COVID-19 infection, which may further promote the carcinogenesis linked to EBV. The COVID-19-induced inflammatory reactions may increase EBV replication, encourage viral latency, or contribute to a tumor-promoting environment (TME). This is especially important for tumors like nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which is intimately linked to EBV infection. In these cases, the virus can affect the surrounding tissue milieu as well as the host’s immune response. Tumor Promotion and Immune Evasion [ 37 43 102 103 104 105 Table 4 40 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 COVID-19, on the other hand, interacts with the immune system in several ways, many of which may exacerbate EBV-associated malignancies. SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has been shown to impair the function of T-cells, B-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells—critical components of the immune system that play vital roles in immune surveillance against infections and malignancies. In particular, the COVID-19-induced immune suppression, characterized by lymphopenia and a dysfunctional immune response, may compromise the host’s ability to control latent EBV infections [ 31 98 121 122 40 123 124 125 Additionally, there is evidence of a delayed or inadequate immune response in COVID-19 patients, which may make it more difficult to eradicate EBV-infected cells. This protracted immunosuppression may enable EBV to remain dormant and maybe encourage the malignant development of infected cells [ 43 106 126 127 Figure 5 103 128 129 130 6. Clinical Implications, Impact on Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment: Global healthcare systems have been severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the prompt diagnosis and treatment of a number of illnesses, including cancer. Regular screenings and timely diagnostic treatments are generally necessary for cancer detection, but many of these were postponed or delayed because of the pandemic’s constraints and the healthcare system’s preference for COVID-19 cases [ 35 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 7. Future Directions Managing patients with EBV-related tumors during the continuing COVID-19 epidemic necessitates comprehensive, interdisciplinary treatments that address both viral infections simultaneously. Clinicians must be attentive in monitoring for possible EBV reactivation in COVID-19 patients, especially given the immunosuppressive nature of both diseases. Establishing treatment strategies that balance cancer medicines with adequate viral infection care is crucial for sustaining these patients’ health and well-being. Future studies should concentrate on a few critical areas to gain a better understanding of the intricate interactions between EBV, COVID-19, and cancer. One of the key research directions should be the study of viral reactivation mechanisms, particularly in the context of COVID-19-related immune regulation. Understanding how COVID-19 exacerbates EBV reactivation may aid in the development of targeted therapeutic options to prevent cancer progression in these vulnerable patients. Additionally, during the pandemic, studies on immune regulation and the discovery of biomarkers for outcome prediction in patients with EBV-related malignancies may enhance prognosis and direct more efficient treatments. Future studies on targeted medications that can simultaneously treat immunological alterations caused by viruses and cancer appear promising. Ultimately, the connection between EBV, COVID-19, and cancer emphasizes how urgently collaborative research projects are needed to develop improved techniques for the detection, control, and therapy of these dual-threat diseases. Global problems brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and EBV infections have significantly impacted the onset, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. EBV, a well-known oncogenic virus, has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of malignancies, and its relationship with COVID-19 further complicates the clinical management of cancer patients. The combined effects of COVID-19 and EBV can exacerbate tumor progression, impair immunological responses, and delay timely therapy since they share common immune dysregulation pathways. The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional challenges by delaying cancer diagnosis, disrupting treatment regimens, and creating new vulnerabilities for an already immunocompromised group of cancer patients with EBV. In addition to making it more difficult for the body to fight viral reactivation, the immune suppression caused by COVID-19 also lowers the efficacy of cancer treatments, which worsens the prognosis for these individuals. Treatment approaches need to adapt going ahead to address the combined threat of COVID-19 and EBV. Improving patient outcomes will need to incorporate multidisciplinary approaches to treat both viral infections at the same time while adhering to cancer treatment plans. In order to create targeted treatments that meet the unique immunological challenges presented by COVID-19, more research is required to comprehend the molecular processes allowing EBV reactivation in this setting. Last but not least, the connection between viral infection and cancer emphasizes the necessity of learning more about the interactions between viruses like EBV and contemporary global health issues like COVID-19. We can reduce the impact of these two dangers on cancer patients worldwide by developing more efficient diagnostic, treatment, and preventive methods through continued research and cooperation. 8. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic and EBV infections are presenting concurrent global challenges that have significantly changed the development, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. EBV, a well-known oncogenic virus, has long been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of malignancies, and its relationship with COVID-19 further complicates the clinical management of cancer patients. COVID-19 and EBV share the same pathways of immune dysregulation, and when they work together, they can impair immune responses, hasten the growth of tumors, delay timely treatment responses, and postpone prompt medical attention. The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional challenges by delaying cancer diagnosis, disrupting treatment regimens, and creating new vulnerabilities for an already immunocompromised group of cancer patients with EBV. In addition to making it more difficult for the body to fight viral reactivation, the immune suppression caused by COVID-19 also lowers the efficacy of cancer treatments, which worsens the prognosis for these individuals. Future treatment approaches must be modified to address the combined threat of COVID-19 and EBV. Improving patient outcomes through the use of interdisciplinary techniques to treat both viral infections at the same time while safeguarding cancer treatment regimens will be crucial. More research is needed to understand the molecular pathways underlying EBV reactivation in the context of COVID-19 and to develop tailored therapies that consider the unique immunological challenges presented by both illnesses. Ultimately, this link between viral infection and cancer emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of how viruses such as EBV interact with contemporary global health crises like COVID-19. Through continued study and collaboration, we can develop more effective diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive methods to reduce the burden of these concurrent risks on cancer patients worldwide.

The figure showed how immune responses like T cell exhaustion and molecular mimicry interact with viral infections like Epstein-Barr virus and SARS-CoV-2. It draws attention to effects on B cells, chronic inflammation, and inflammasome activation. Among the repercussions are demyelination and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which may be a factor in Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). The intricate connection between immune systems, viral infections, and long-term health consequences is highlighted in the diagram. Figure 2 EBV-Associated Malignancies: Cell-Specific Transformation and Lymphoproliferative Disorders. This figure explains how the EBV interacts with different cell types, such as B cells, NK/T cells, and epithelial cells. It draws attention to how proliferative NK/T cells and lymphoblastoid cells can change and develop into cancer. The graphic highlights the emergence of cancers such as epithelial cancers and natural killer (NK)/T cell lymphoma. It emphasizes how EBV promotes cancer and cellular proliferation. This illustration links the pathophysiology of several malignancies to EBV infection. Figure 3 SARS-CoV-2 Immune Response: Viral Entry, Immune Activation, and Tissue Injury. The figure depicts the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, emphasizing important elements that cause inflammation, such as PAMPs and DAMPs. It demonstrates how ACE2 receptors, which involve neutrophils, NETs, and macrophages, contribute to viral entry and subsequent tissue damage. The figure shows how NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and antibody production are activated to eliminate viruses. Additionally, it shows how infected cells undergo apoptosis and develop syncytia. The intricate relationship between viral infection and host immunological responses is highlighted in this figure. Figure 4 Mechanisms of COVID-19 Pathogenesis: Viral Reactivation, Systemic Inflammation, and Multi-Organ Damage. This figure demonstrates SARS-CoV-2’s systemic effects, with a focus on its capacity to pass the blood-brain barrier and reawaken latent diseases such as EBV, CMV, HHV-6, and tuberculosis. It emphasizes immunological dysfunction and inflammation produced by viral proteins such as S, N, and E proteins. The graphic depicts lung damage and the lung-gut axis, demonstrating how the virus affects intestinal protein permeability and induces endothelium damage. It also focuses on microbiota dysbiosis, microbial translocation, and the release of inflammatory chemicals such as LPS and PGN. This image emphasizes SARS-CoV-2’s extensive influence on many organ systems and immunological responses. Figure 5 Potential Pathways Linking Acute COVID-19, EBV Reactivation, Inflammation, Autoreactivity, and Long COVID. This figure illustrates hypothesized mechanisms connecting acute COVID-19 infection to Long COVID, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation, systemic inflammation, and autoimmune responses (autoreactivity). The arrows suggest possible interactions or progression between these factors. viruses-17-01195-t001_Table 1 Table 1 The comparison between EBV and COVID-19 (caused by SARS-CoV-2) based on their characteristics, effects on cancer, and related factors.
