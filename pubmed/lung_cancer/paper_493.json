The assessment was based on indicators such as Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), Health Assessment Questionnaire, and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Additionally, the study investigated the impact of dosage, disease duration, and serum markers—C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)—on treatment efficacy. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials yielded data from 69 studies involving 7999 patients. Efficacy models for DAS28, ACR20, and ACR50 were developed to explore the impact of time and dosage, with simulations conducted to predict outcomes at 12 weeks. Results showed that the maximum reduction in DAS28 (Emax) was −54.90% (RSE: 13%), with an ET50 of 20.6 weeks (RSE: 26%). For ACR20 and ACR50, Emax values were 70.3% (RSE: 3%) and 49.4% (RSE: 24%), with ET50s of 6.69 (RSE: 7%) and 27.3 (RSE: 37%) weeks, respectively. Neither dosage nor patient‐specific factors like disease duration, CRP, or ESR significantly influenced efficacy. MTX is effective in the early treatment of RA but often fails to achieve remission in patients. efficacy methotrexate model‐based meta‐analysis rheumatoid arthritis pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:30.09.2025 Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation, persistent synovitis, and eventual joint destruction.  1  2  3  1  4 Management strategies for patients with RA are outlined in the guidelines of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR).  5  6  7  8  9  1  6  10 In clinical practice, approximately one third of patients with RA receive monotherapy with boDMARDs or bsDMARDs, often because of MTX intolerance or non‐adherence.  11  6  12  13  14  15  10 To date, numerous systematic reviews and meta‐analyses have been conducted on MTX treatment for RA.  16  17 Recently, a model‐based meta‐analysis (MBMA) was developed to evaluate drug efficacy and compare different treatment strategies.  18  17  19  20  21 This study aimed to establish an MBMA model for MTX monotherapy in patients who responded well to MTX by quantifying the effects of treatment duration, dosage, disease duration, baseline levels of C‐reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) on efficacy. Methods Search Strategy We conducted a comprehensive literature search across PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBAS, covering studies up to April 29, 2024. The search terms used were title/abstract: “rheumatoid arthritis” and “methotrexate” or “MTX” and “efficacy.” Our study was restricted to clinical trials and articles published in English. All included trials met the following criteria: The trial must include patients diagnosed with RA who are receiving MTX monotherapy. The trial must be an RCT. The trial must report at least one of the following outcomes: Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), or ACR of 20, 50, or 70. For studies with a crossover design, only data from the first phase were analyzed. Patients were not required to receive MTX treatment within 3 months prior to the start of the trial. Trials in which patients with an inadequate response to MTX continued to receive MTX were excluded. Non‐randomized trials were excluded because they are generally associated with a higher risk of bias (e.g., selection bias and confounding factors), which could compromise the validity of the results. Data Extraction We created an Excel database to categorize the relevant characteristics of the various studies. Information collected from each selected clinical trial included the authors, publication year, sample size, study country, treatment strategy, disease duration, and baseline values of various participant indicators. The primary outcome measures collected included DAS28, HAQ, and ACR 20, 50, or 70. Graphical data were extracted using WebPlot Digitizer (version 4.7). The evaluation metrics for modeling DAS28, HAQ, CRP, and ESR were assessed using the mean percentage change, accounting for potential baseline effects on treatment efficacy. The formula used was as follows: E % = E t − E baseline E baseline t baseline In the dataset analysis, if the percentage of missing values for a covariate was ≤30%, the covariate was included in the final model, and missing values were imputed using the median value of that covariate from the database. If the percentage of missing values for a covariate was >30%, the covariate was discarded and excluded from the final model. For cases where the sample size corresponding to the efficacy measurement time points was not reported, the sample size at the study endpoint was used for imputation. All data were independently extracted by two researchers, and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion. The data extraction error between the two researchers did not exceed 2%. The average of the values was considered the final value. Since this study is a meta‐analysis based solely on data extracted from previously published studies, ethical approval and informed consent is not required. Model Developing Following a preliminary analysis of the dataset, we used the sigmoid maximum effect (E max E i , j = E max × e η i × Tim e j E T 50 × e η i + Tim e j i,j max 5  0 i 2 The variability at each time point within a single study was represented by the correlation residual and residual variability (RUV). In the MBMA, between‐arm variability and RUV were related to sample size and measurement precision. Therefore, weights (W) were applied to adjust for these factors as follows: W = 1 N The variability at each time point was described using additive, proportional, exponential, and combined models with adjustments made to the model structures as follows: Additive : Y = E i , j + W × ER R 1 + RUV Proportional : Y = E i , j × W × 1 + ER R 1 + RUV Exponential model : Y = E i , j × W × e ER R 1 + RUV 1  22 Four baseline characteristics were considered: dose, disease duration, CRP, and ESR. As continuous covariates, they were included in the model using the following functional forms: P i , j = θ 1 + θ 2 × CO V i − CO V median P i , j = θ 1 × CO V i / CO V median θ 2 P i , j = θ 1 × e θ 2 × CO V i − CO V median i 1 2 i median Covariates were selected using a stepwise approach that included both forward and backward elimination processes. Each covariate was added to the base model one at a time, with only one parameter changed at a time. If the objective function value (OFV) of the model decreased by more than 3.84 (χ 2 P After forward selection, the model may include unnecessary covariates, which could lead to reduced model stability or over‐parameterization. Therefore, backward elimination was performed to remove inappropriate covariates. During this process, one covariate was removed. If the OFV of the model changed by more than 10.83 (χ 2 P Model Evaluation The effectiveness and accuracy of the model were assessed by plotting goodness‐of‐fit (GOF) charts, which included the following: Scatter plot of individual predicted values (IPRED) versus observed values (DV) Scatter plot of population predicted values (PRED) versus DV Scatter plot of conditional weighted residuals (CWRES) versus PRED Scatter plot of CWRES versus time Bootstrapping, a widely used model evaluation technique, involved creating 1000 bootstrap datasets by resampling with replacement. Each dataset was used to fit the model, and the resulting parameters were compared with those of the final model to assess internal stability and validity. The proportion of successful model estimations (robustness) was calculated, and the median and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (2.5%‐97.5%) were computed for each parameter. This analysis helps determine whether the estimated parameters of the final model fall within the corresponding CIs. The predictive performance of the final model was assessed by a visual prediction check (VPC). Based on the estimated parameters of the final model, 2000 Monte Carlo simulations were conducted. The 95% CIs for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of the simulated datasets were plotted. If the model performed well, the observed data should fall within the CIs of the corresponding percentiles of the simulated datasets. The final model was evaluated using the leave‐one‐out cross‐validation (LOO‐CV) method. In this approach, data from one study were excluded to create a new dataset, and the model was refitted on this new dataset. The parameter estimates obtained from each dataset were compared to assess the stability of the final model. Model Simulation After the final model was established, the model parameters and their standard errors for each trial were obtained through Bayesian. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation was performed 10,000 times to calculate the median efficacy and the 2.5%‐97.5% percentiles of each model at 12 and 24 weeks. Software Model estimation and simulations were performed using the Gfortran compiler (version 4.6.3) in conjunction with NONMEM (version7.5.0), Pirana (version 2.9.7), and Perl‐Speaks‐NONMEM (version 5.3.0) was used for model execution. Diagnostic graphics and visual predictive checks were performed using the R software (version 4.3.3). Results Characteristics of Included Studies In the initial retrieval phase, 3768 studies were included. Finally, a total of 69 studies involving 7999 patients were included for analysis.  1  4  8  12  15  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67  68  69  70  71  72  73  74  75  76  77  78  79  80  81  82  83  84  85  86 1 1 S1 S2 Figure 1 Flow diagram for study selection.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Model Developing Of the selected studies, 31 reported efficacy outcome data for DAS28, while 38, 40, 41, and 35 studies reported endpoint data for the HAQ, ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70, respectively. Owing to substantial missing data for HAQ and ACR70, models for these outcomes could not be successfully fitted. However, the time‐DAS28, time‐ACR20, and time‐ACR50 effect models were successfully established. Table S1 We examined the effects of MTX dose, RA disease duration, CRP level, and ESR in the base model. Covariates were not investigated on ET50 because ISV was unsuccessful in being evaluated.

Discussion MTX remains a cornerstone in the treatment of early RA and a key component in combination therapies.  5  6  87  88  5  6  88  16  89  90  91  6  10  87 DAS28 is a commonly used measure of clinical efficacy.  87  6  10  87  92 max‐DAS28 50‐DAS28  5  5 The ACR criteria are also used to evaluate RA remission.  6  6  87 The inability to fit the dose–effect model in this study was disappointing, likely because the majority of studies did not report the average MTX dose. Additionally, none of the efficacy models successfully incorporated covariates, particularly dosage. This does not necessarily indicate that dosage had a minimal impact on efficacy. The difficulty in fitting the model is likely attributed to a non‐standard dosing regimen of MTX, which was not administered in a fixed‐dose manner. Although we attempted to analyze efficacy using average doses, the absence of this parameter in most studies necessitated using average values as substitutes, which hinders accurate model description. Some studies have identified a positive correlation between MTX dose and efficacy. However, research on the relationship between disease duration and treatment efficacy remains limited.  93 To control confounding bias, enhance the reliability of results, and provide the highest quality evidence, RCTs are preferred in MBMA due to the randomization and strict enrollment of subjects.  17  18  94 This study had certain limitations. First, it included only English‐language literature, which may have led to incomplete data collection and a small sample size. Second, the study focused solely on studies involving good responders to MTX or studies on initial MTX. Future studies should conduct MBMA analyses specifically for patients with poor response to MTX. Third, the study did not analyze bDMARDs and tsDMARDs, which are highly effective in the later stages of RA treatment. Future research should investigate these drugs’ efficacy over time, dose–response relationships, and the impact of other factors on their efficacy. Additionally, drug toxicity is a significant and often intolerable factor for patients undergoing RA treatment. Future research should analyze the occurrence of adverse events associated with different drugs and dosages. Finally, this study did not comprehensively evaluate the effects of covariates on ET50. Future studies could leverage larger datasets or use mechanism‐based pharmacodynamic models to further elucidate the relationships between covariates and ET50. Conclusions This study established a time‐efficacy model to systematically evaluate the dynamic efficacy of MTX monotherapy in RA. The model revealed that only a minority of patients (22.7%) achieved clinical remission by week 24. Despite MTX being widely recommended as an anchor drug in RA, this finding demonstrates that the efficacy of monotherapy may be insufficient to meet the treatment goals in the most patients.
