Consequently, investigations into the chamber‐specific biology of the hypertensive human heart have not previously been done. Biobanked, postmortem human heart tissue presents a unique opportunity to understand the pathogenesis of human cardiovascular diseases through detailed multiomics analyses. Here, we examine the effects of hypertension on the cardiac transcriptome, cellular subtypes, and metabolic profile. We performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq), single‐nucleus RNA‐seq (snRNA‐seq), and metabolomics on ventricular and atrial samples from donors with hypertension ( n n 2 METHODS 2.1 Heart procurement, dissection, and preservation Postmortem human hearts were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange. No contact was made by the investigators with human participants and deidentified donor information was provided to the investigators. The Boston University Institutional Review Board deemed Protocol H‐42979 exempt. Hearts were stored during transport in cardioplegic solution (Belzer UW Cold Storage Solution: 320 mOsm, [Na+] = 29 mEq/L, [K+] = 125 mEq/L, pH = 7.4 at 20°C), systematically dissected, flash frozen, and stored to maintain the anatomical registration for multiomics as previously described (Moreira et al., 2023 2.2 Multiomics 2.2.1 Bulk RNA RNA was extracted from right (RV) and left (LV) mid‐ventricular wall samples using the Qiagen RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit. RNA recovery was quantified using a NanoDrop N‐D 1000 spectrophotometer. Libraries were prepared with ribosomal RNA depletion utilizing the Kapa Roche KK8561KAPA RNA Hyper+RiboErase HMR and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 2000 instrument by the Boston University Microarray and Sequencing Resource core. For bulk RNA‐seq data, reads were mapped with STAR and read counts were analyzed across samples by Wald tests using DESeq2 2023 z z 2.2.2  snRNA Single nuclei suspensions were isolated from flash frozen tissue samples and processed for single nucleus RNA sequencing using 10× Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ v3.1 as previously described (Tucker et al., 2020 2023 2015 2018 2019 For clustering, the top 500 highly variable genes were identified using Pearson residuals (Lause et al., 2021 2019 SORBS2 MYH7 PECAM1 VWF DCN MYH11 PDGFRB CD163 MRC1 SKAP1 PTPRC NRXN1 NCAM2 To resolve subtypes, we performed reciprocal nonparametric differential expression testing (Wilcoxon rank‐sum) between communities identified by Leiden clustering at a resolution of 0.15. Genes upregulated in each contrast ( p The dataset was subsequently split into atrial and ventricular subsets for chamber‐specific analysis or into cell type specific objects for subclustering analysis. In both instances, the same normalization, clustering, and cell type assignment strategy was applied to each subset independently. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to calculate marker gene cell type specificity with a p p p 2000 2023 2022 For analysis of cell cycle, counts were obtained at the cell type level for each identified subcluster and used for comparative analysis of population changes across hypertensive and nonhypertensive condition states. S phase and G2M phase cell cycle scores were calculated using the “Score cell cycle genes” tool in Scanpy. Composite cell cycle scores were calculated by combining the S and G2M scores. Significant alterations in cell cycle parameters were determined using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test and the Mann–Whitney U An annotated data object containing PCA scores and a UMAP embedding generated using the previously described Scanpy pipeline, was round‐tripped to R as a SingleCellExperiment using zellkonverter::readH5AD. Scanpy embeddings were mapped to reducedDim(sce, “PCA”) and reducedDim(sce, “UMAP”). Neighborhoods were defined with miloR on the PCA space by constructing a k‐nearest‐neighbor graph ( k 2 p Quality control metrics and metadata can be found in Table S1 2.2.3 Metabolomics Untargeted metabolomics was conducted on left and right ventricular (LV and RV) tissues. Polar metabolite profiling was performed similar to the procedure described previously (Yang et al., 2024 g On the day of the analysis, the samples were resuspended in 50 μL of 60/40 acetonitrile/water. The LC–MS was performed at the University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center Metabolomics Platform, as described (Yang et al., 2024 2 2021 stats PMI Hours ~ PC1 + PC2 + … + PC 10 For PCs associated with PMI ( q 2015 2.2.4 Bioinformatics and statistical analysis For analysis, we opted to group samples according to disease state (HTN vs. NTN) and use high‐level pathway enrichment analyses rather than blood pressure as a continuous variable to avoid overfitting our small sample size. As this was a pilot study, we focus on high order biology rather than individual gene or metabolite differential expression. For all statistical testing, a significance threshold of an FDR q 3 RESULTS 3.1 Donor characteristics All heart donors were female with similar body mass indexes, causes of death, and postmortem intervals (Figure 1a 1a 1b FIGURE 1 Donor demographics and heart characteristics. (a) Demographics of heart donors with ( n n 3.2 Bulk RNA We sought to identify molecular alterations associated with hypertension in human cardiac samples using a multiomics approach. We first performed bulk RNA‐seq on LV and RV tissues from each donor, which segregated by disease state in PCA of gene expression but not by donor site (Figure 2a q 2b SIK1 FIGURE 2 Bulk RNA sequencing of hypertensive versus normotensive left (LV) and right (RV) ventriclar samples demonstrate altered metabolic and gene‐regulatory programs.

Points in red or blue are significantly (FDR q n n SIK1 q We then performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, which revealed coordinately higher upregulation of genes in hypertensive myocardium compared to tissue from normotensive referents that are involved in DNA unwinding and replication, branched‐chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, and NAD‐dependent deacetylases (Figure 2c 3.3  snRNA To determine the effect of hypertension on myocardial cell type composition and cellular states, we performed snRNA‐seq on a total of 39,201 nuclei isolated from hypertensive and normotensive LV and LA tissues. UMAP dimension reduction revealed cell‐type and disease‐state‐specific diversity (Figure 3a 3b 3c,d FIGURE 3 Single‐nucleus RNA sequencing of hypertensive versus normotensive left ventricles and left atria (LA) reveals altered endothelial proliferation and mural cell proportions.

This pilot study revealed several molecular profiles associated with hypertension despite the small sample size and varied donor demographics. Importantly, this study utilized hearts from hypertensive donors that had not undergone gross anatomic remodeling, consistent with an earlier disease process, and provides a unique look into early hypertensive heart disease pathophysiology. We identified several consistent gene‐regulatory and metabolic signatures associated with hypertension across our multiomic approaches. Collectively, our RNA‐seq and metabolomics suggest altered NAD + + + + + 2015 + 2018 2015 The altered NAD + 2014 We observed a higher abundance of many metabolites involved in the early steps of glycolysis in our hypertensive cardiac samples, as well as those in the pentose phosphate pathway. Given the increased relative abundance of NADH compared to NAD + + 2017 Additionally, we observed coordinately higher expression of genes associated with BCAA metabolism in hypertensive cardiac tissue. This aligns with previous work showing an association of elevated circulating BCAA levels with hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases (Fine et al., 2024 We identified a proliferative transcriptional expression program related to DNA unwinding and replication in both our RV and LV bulk RNA‐seq. snRNA‐seq data allowed us to isolate this proliferative signal to the cardiac endothelial cell population in hypertensive donor hearts. Cardiac endothelial cell proliferation may reflect compensatory angiogenesis driven by the pro‐hypertrophic stimuli of systemic hypertension (Gogiraju et al., 2019 Leveraging snRNA‐Seq, we were able to identify site‐specific cell types associated with hypertension. Mural cells, composed of pericytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, are a heterogenous group of resident cardiac cell types that influence a variety of processes associated with hypertension (van Dijk et al., 2015 2021 5 LIMITATIONS Although our sample size is limited, the collected cardiac biospecimens represent a rare snapshot into hypertensive heart disease before gross anatomic remodeling. With our small sample size, it is likely that only genes and metabolites that had a large effect size on the difference between disease groups were detected. Future studies, with larger sample sizes, are needed to understand the contributions of altered reductive stress to transcriptional and metabolic alterations associated with hypertension and to determine the contributions of unique VSMC cell states in hypertensive heart disease. The phenotypic data reported with each donor heart was a combination of self‐reported information and limited chart documentation. Important information, such as specific antihypertensive regimens, was not available for some donors. More comprehensive phenotyping and clinical profiles would improve the ability to determine associations between cardiac tissue biology and disease types. 6 CONCLUSION We performed site‐specific multiomics on paired postmortem human hearts and identified both chamber‐ and cell‐type‐specific transcriptomic profiles, a transcriptomic and metabolomic signature of reductive stress, dysregulated BCAA metabolic gene expression, and depletion of atrial cVSMCs associated with hypertension compared to tissue from normotensive referents. Future efforts aimed at pairing detailed spatial multiomics with rich phenotypic data may help to identify novel therapeutic targets in human cardiovascular disease.
