It does not require pre-assumption of pathogens and is suitable for detecting unknown infections, mixed infections, or rare pathogens ( Gu et al., 2019 Chiu and Miller, 2019 Jia et al., 2023 Jiang et al., 2024 Liu et al., 2021 Wang et al., 2024 Zhang et al., 2024 2024 Furthermore, the utility of mNGS in differentiating fungal colonization from infection have been explored, primarily by establishing thresholds for pathogen-specific read counts. For instance, Liu et al. demonstrated that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) mNGS could distinguish Pneumocystis jirovecii Liu et al., 2021 Jia et al., 2023 Aspergillus Jiang et al., 2024 Mucorales In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of mNGS, culture and OMT in distinguishing Mucorales 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study design and participants This retrospective study included 71 patients with mucormycosis hospitalized at the Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital from September 2021 to September 2024. The corresponding medical records were reviewed, and the clinical data analyzed including demographic characteristics, type of underlying disease, diagnosis, clinical course, treatment, and outcome. BALF, blood, SCF and tissue were used for pathogen identification through CMT, including culture for bacteria (blood agar plates, Chocolate, and MacConkey) and fungi (Sabouraud agar plates), and OMT methods, including 1-3-β-D-glucan (G) test (Fungi (1,3)-β-D-glucan assay kit, Gold Mountainriver Tech Development Co.,LTD, Beijing, China), galactomannan (GM) test (Galactomannan test kit, Dana Biotechnology Co.,LTD, Tianjing, China) and smear microscopy for fungi (KOH or Phenol cotton orchid stain), aiming to provide a methodological assessment. 2.2 Criteria for Mucorales In this study, the diagnoses of invasive Mucorales Donnelly et al., 2020 Mucorales Mucorales Mucorales Mucorales Mucorales Mucorales Donnelly et al., 2020 Feys et al., 2022 Jiang et al., 2024 Mucorales Mucorales Mucorales Donnelly et al., 2020 Feys et al., 2022 Jiang et al., 2024 2.3 Sample collation and mNGS detection Clinical samples, including blood, BALF, CSF, pus, pleural fluids, and tissue, were collected using aseptic techniques when clinicians suspects a pathogenic microorganism infection but has not yet found etiological evidence. And chemical DNA or RNA stabilizers were used to minimize the possibility of nucleic acid degradation at the time of sample collection. The detailed methods regarding the wet lab and bioinformatics had been described previously ( Zhou et al., 2022 2.4 ROC curve construction The ROC curve is constructed based on the Mucorales Mucorales 2.5 Statistical analysis The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics. The chi-square test was applied to the categorical variables. A student t-test was used for continuous variables.
