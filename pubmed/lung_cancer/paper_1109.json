Paclitaxel (PTX), a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for solid tumors, is particularly neurotoxic, and no effective treatment exists for paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN). Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that remove acetyl groups from histone and non-histone proteins, including transcription factors and cytoskeletal components. This study evaluates the HDAC6 inhibitor ITF6475 for its potential to prevent PIPN and compares its effects with ricolinostat, a well-established HDAC6 inhibitor previously studied in cisplatin-induced neuropathy models. Female C57BL/6 mice received PTX vehicle (VEH) or PTX (70 mg/kg intravenously, once per week for four weeks), and the remaining four groups received PTX with co-treatment of either ricolinostat (50 mg/kg orally, daily) or ITF6475 (1, 6, or 12.5 mg/kg orally, daily). Neurophysiological assessments at the end of treatment showed a significant reduction in caudal sensory nerve action potential amplitude across all PTX-treated groups compared to the VEH group. At the same time, PTX treatment led to the development of mechanical allodynia. However, co-treatment with the HDAC6 inhibitor prevented significant differences compared to the VEH group. PTX-induced reduction in intraepidermal nerve fiber density was significantly prevented in the PTX + ITF6475 (1 mg/kg) group, and PTX-induced increase in neurofilament light levels was reduced in all ITF6475 co-treated groups. These findings support the potential of ITF6475 in preventing small fiber damage in a severe, chronic PIPN model. paclitaxel neuropathy histone deacetylase 6 neuroprotection small fibers ITF6475 an Italfarmaco S.p.A. research grant the 2022 PRIN project 2022ZL4JP8 the AIRC grant IG 25788 This study was supported by an Italfarmaco S.p.A. research grant.

Introduction Improvement in the treatment of solid and hematological tumors significantly increased the long-term survival of cancer patients, but sometimes, these patients experience long-term treatment-related side effects that can have severe consequences on their quality of life [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 7 8 9 10 11 CIPN affects, with different clinical patterns and severity, patients with various common tumors, such as breast, lung, gastrointestinal, and prostate cancers, as well as rarer malignancies like testicular and ovarian cancers, and multiple myeloma. The incidence of CIPN can exceed 80% in patients, depending on the chemotherapy regimen used, and its symptoms are often irreversible, significantly diminishing patients’ quality of life [ 12 The most commonly neurotoxic anticancer drugs have different antineoplastic mechanisms, including binding to nuclear DNA, inhibition of proteasomal activity, and disruption of the microtubular array. These mechanisms are not necessarily the same causing CIPN, but, particularly regarding the anti-tubulin agents, this might be the case. Paclitaxel (PTX), the first-in-class drug of the taxane family, is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for solid tumors (particularly breast, ovary, lung, prostate, and head-and-neck cancers), acting by hyper-stabilizing cancer cell microtubules, which are essential structures for highly dividing cells, such as cancer cells. Through this mechanism, PTX promotes the assembly of tubulin dimers into stable microtubule bundles and inhibits their breakdown, thus disrupting the cell cycle. In fact, this tubulin stabilization leads to cancer cells’ mitotic arrest in the G2/M phase, ultimately causing cell death and preventing their replication. PTX is very effective, but it is also particularly neurotoxic, causing severe axonopathy involving all types of nerve fibers (commonly named PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy, or PIPN), for which there is currently no effective treatment. While the exact mechanisms underlying PIPN are not fully understood, research suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and microtubule aggregation—leading to cytoskeletal damage and impaired axonal transport—play key roles [ 13 Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes responsible for removing acetyl groups from histone and non-histone proteins, including transcription factors and cytoskeletal components. HDAC6, a specific member of this family, deacetylates α-tubulin in microtubules, thereby regulating mitochondrial transport [ 14 15 CIPN, as well as the use of HDACH6 as a putative neuroprotectant agent, has been extensively investigated using rodent animal models. Experimental research on CIPN induced by drugs such as cisplatin and vincristine, as well as studies on PIPN and inherited neuropathy models, suggest that HDAC6 inhibitors have neuroprotective effects [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Most known HDAC6 inhibitors are hydroxamic acids, which rely on the hydroxamic group for enzyme inhibition. However, these compounds present pharmacological challenges: their rapid metabolism leads to a short circulation time, limiting sustained target inhibition. Additionally, hydroxamic acid hydrolysis can release hydroxylamine, a genotoxic and potentially carcinogenic compound, making these molecules unsuitable for chronic neuropathy treatment [ 25 To address these limitations, a novel class of non-hydroxamic, non-genotoxic HDAC6 inhibitors has been developed. These compounds exhibit high selectivity for HDAC6, reducing off-target effects. One such compound, ITF6475, has shown strong HDAC6 inhibition without toxicity in animal studies following both intravenous and oral administration [ 26 In this study, ITF6475 was evaluated for its potential to prevent PIPN and was compared in a thoroughly characterized mouse model [ 27 22 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Drugs and Animal Model The care and husbandry of animals were conducted in agreement with the institutional guidelines in compliance with national (D.L.vo n. 26/2014) and international laws and policies (EU Directive 2010/63/UE; Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, U.S. National Research Council, 8th Ed.). According to the Italian laws and regulations, the study plan was assessed by the Superior Institute of Health and authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health (authorization number 777/2022-PR). A paclitaxel (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA, USA) solution was prepared before each administration; the powder was dissolved in Tween80 10%, EtOH100 10%, and saline solution 80% and administered intravenously (i.v.). Ricolinostat and ITF6475 solutions were prepared before each administration, respectively, in DMSO 5%, PEG400/H2O 50/50, and methocel 0.5%, and administered orally (p.o). C57BL/6 female mice (Inotiv, Udine, Italy) were used and randomized into six different groups (19 mice/group): one group was treated with PTX vehicle i.v., 1 time/week for 4 weeks and methocel 0.5% os, daily (VEH group); a second group was treated with PTX, i.v., 70 mg/kg 1 time/week for 4 weeks (PTX group) [ 17 Figure 1 At baseline and at the end of treatment, neurophysiological evaluations and dynamic tests were performed ( Figure 1 g 2.2. Nerve Conduction Studies The onset of PIPN was assessed by evaluating the sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and nerve action potential amplitude (SNAP) of caudal and digital nerves using the electromyography apparatus (Matrix Light, Micromed, Treviso, Italy). NCV and SNAP were measured by placing a couple of needle recording electrodes (cathode and anode) at the base of the tail (for caudal recordings) or at the ankle bone (for digital recordings) and a couple of stimulating electrodes 3.5 cm away from the recording points (for caudal recordings) or close to the fourth toe (for digital recordings). Latencies were measured from stimulus onset, and peak-to-peak amplitudes were calculated. The NCV was calculated considering the measured distance between the recording and the stimulating negative electrode divided by the latency. The intensity, duration, and frequency of stimulation were set up to obtain optimal results and the maximal amplitude of the potential. All the neurophysiological determinations were performed under standard conditions in a temperature-controlled room (22 ± 2 °C) and the animal under isoflurane anesthesia along the whole procedure with continuous monitoring of vital signs [ 27 28 2.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessment For the determination of ITF6475 in mouse plasma (n. 3 mice/group), aliquots of 20 µL of samples were deproteinized by adding 300 µL of acetonitrile. After centrifugation, 100 µL of the supernatant was collected from each sample and allowed to dry in a nitrogen flow at 35 °C. The residue was then reconstituted in 150 µL of the mixture in 90% water/10% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Quantification of ITF6475 in the samples was carried out on a calibration curve in the range 1–1000 ng/mL. Quantification of Ricolinostat in mouse plasma was carried out on aliquots of 20 µL and deproteinized with 200 µL of acetonitrile. Aliquots of 100 µL of the supernatant were collected and diluted with 100 µL of the mixture in 90% water/10% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The calibration curve range was 1–1000 ng/mL. Samples were analyzed in an LC-MS/MS system, constituted by a Prominence Shimadzu HPLC (Shimadzu Italia S.r.l., Milano, Italy) and an API6500+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with TurboIonSpray (Sciex, Milano, Italy). Analyses were carried out in a positive mode. The system was managed through the software Analyst 1.7.2 (Sciex, Milano, Italy). 2.4. Dynamic Aesthesiometer Test The mechanical nociceptive threshold was assessed using a Dynamic Aesthesiometer Test (model 37450, Ugo Basile Biological Instruments, Comerio, Italy), which generated a linearly increasing mechanical force. At each time point, after the acclimatization period, a servo-controlled mechanical stimulus (a pointed metallic filament, 0.5 mm diameter) was applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw, which exerted a progressively increasing punctuate pressure, reaching up to 15 g within 15 s. The pressure evoking a clear voluntary hind paw withdrawal response was recorded automatically and taken as representing the mechanical nociceptive threshold index. The mechanical threshold was always assessed on alternating sides every 2 min on 3 occasions to yield a mean value. The results represented the maximal pressure (expressed in grams) tolerated by the animals. There was an upper limit cutoff of 20 s, after which the mechanical stimulus was automatically terminated. The examiner (ACa) was blinded regarding the treatment of the animals [ 27 2.5. Histopathological Analysis Liver, spleen, thymus, kidneys, and sternum were collected and fixed in 10% buffered formalin at room temperature for 4 days. After fixation, the sternum was decalcified for 48 h at room temperature in 10% buffered EDTA. After trimming, these samples were paraffin-embedded, cut into 3 µm thick sections, stained with hematoxylin–eosin, and examined with an Olympus BX51 light microscope (Olympus, Segrate, Italy). 2.6. Neuropathology Caudal nerves were isolated for morphological analysis and processed as previously described [ 29 27 2.7. Skin Biopsy To evaluate the IENF density, glabrous skin punches from the plantar hind paw were fixed in paraformaldehyde-lysine and periodate sodium (PLP) 2%, cryoprotected and serially cut in 20 μm thick sections. Sections were immunostained with rabbit polyclonal anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP 9.5; Proteintech, Illinois, Rosemont, IL, USA) using a free-floating protocol. The total number of PGP 9.5-positive IENF crossing the dermal-epidermal junction was counted by a blinded examiner (ACh) under a light microscope at 40× magnification (Nexcope Ne920 AUTO light microscope, TiEsseLab Srl, Milano, Italy). IENF density was expressed as the number of IENFs/length of epidermis (mm) [ 27 2.8. Serum for NfL Analysis Serum NfL concentrations were measured using an automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay instrument LUMIPULSE G600 (LUMIPULSE G NfL Blood kit, Fujirebio, Pomezia, Italy). The concentration was expressed in pg/mL [ 27 30 31 2.9. Statistical Analysis The numerosity of each group was defined using a power calculation based on the changes in nerve conduction study results, as previously carried out in similar experiments [ 27 p 3. Results 3.1. General Toxicity The administrations of PTX, ricolinostat, and all doses of ITF6475 were well tolerated by animals, and no mortality was observed. No mice showed evidence of relevant general toxicity. All groups treated with PTX alone or in combination with ricolinosat and all doses of ITF showed a statistically significant increase in body weight vs. VEH ( Figure 2 Histopathological analysis of thymus, spleen, sternal bone marrow, liver, and kidneys showed, at the end of the treatment period, in all the mice examined and treated with PTX alone or in combination with ricolinostat or ITF6475, thymic and splenic hypoplasia associated with reactive extramedullary ectopic hematopoiesis. Mild, diffuse hepatic lipidosis was observed in approximately 25% of the PTX-treated mice examined. At the end of treatment, no pathological findings consequent to treatment were observed in the sternal bone marrow and kidneys. 3.2. Pharmacokinetic Assessment In mouse plasma, ITF6475 is 99% protein-bound (personal observation), while hydroxamic acids such as ricolinostat are not heavily protein-bound. With this assumption and taking into account that AUCs of ITF6475 increase linearly with dosage, whereas AUCs of ricolinostat increase non-linearly at doses above 25 mg/kg, we can extrapolate that free drug exposures of ITF6475 at the dose of 12.5 mg/kg may be similar to exposures of ricolinostat at the dose of 50 mg/kg. Table 1 3.3. Neurotoxicity Assessment Neurophysiological evaluation performed at the end of treatment ( Figure 3 Only the PTX and PTX + ITF12.5 groups also showed a statistically significant reduction in caudal NCV if compared with VEH. No alterations in digital NCV were observed, while the PTX, PTX + ITF6, and PTX + ITF12.5 groups showed a statistically significant reduction in digital SNAP. At the end of treatment, PTX induced the development of mechanical allodynia as assessed with the Dynamic Aesthesiometer Test ( Figure 4 p p p A statistically significant reduction in IENF density was observed in the PTX group compared with the VEH group ( p Figure 4 p p p NfL analysis performed after completion of PTX treatment ( Figure 4 p p The morphological analysis of the proximal caudal nerves performed at the end of treatment revealed severe axonopathy with numerous degenerated fibers in animals treated with PTX alone or in combination ( Figure 5 Figure 6 4. Discussion The occurrence of CIPN remains a relevant unmet clinical need, with important implications during cancer treatment, and potentially severe, long-term (even permanent) neurological side effects. These side effects may result in impaired sensation and coordination, neuropathic pain, limited dexterity in performing fine manual tasks, impaired balance, and increased risk of falls [ 7 Among putative neuroprotectants with a low risk of reducing anticancer activity of chemotherapeutic drugs, HDAC inhibitors are particularly interesting. In fact, their use has also been suggested as anticancer combination drugs, acting by altering the epigenetic landscape of cancer cells by restoring acetylation and reactivating tumor suppressor genes. These effects might contribute to cycle arrest, to the promotion of cancer cell apoptosis, and, eventually, to the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation. Moreover, the combination of HDAC inhibitors and other chemotherapy drugs could not only exploit the synergistic action of both compounds, but it could also allow the use of lower doses, with a significant decrease in their respective toxicities and a reduction in cancer cell drug resistance. Acetylation is also a key process in normal cells, being involved in protein folding, autophagy, transcription regulation, signal transduction, differentiation, and neural function, where it acts as a mediator of axonal and neuronal regeneration [ 32 Specifically regarding HDAC6, its inhibition has demonstrated efficacy in numerous neuroprotective preclinical studies on both chemotherapy-induced and inherited neuropathies [ 33 34 35 The current understanding of PIPN remains inadequate for effective patient management, with multiple mechanisms proposed [ 36 37 38 39 Although the precise mechanism by which HDAC6 inhibition mitigates neuropathy is not fully understood, evidence suggests that this enzyme plays a crucial role in mitochondrial trafficking and energy metabolism. Impaired mitochondrial transport, along with disrupted microtubule dynamics, has been implicated in various neuropathies beyond PIPN [ 17 40 41 42 43 14 Additionally, HDAC6 interacts with and deacetylates mitochondrial membrane proteins such as Mitochondrial Rho-GTPase (Miro1) and Mitofusin, which are responsible for anchoring mitochondria to motor proteins. This deacetylation weakens mitochondrial attachment, potentially disrupting transport [ 17 34 Given prior reports of HDAC6 inhibitors mitigating aspects of CIPN in animal models [ 16 19 22 27 27 Our results show that ITF6475 is more effective than ricolinostat, another HDAC6 inhibitor previously evaluated in CIPN models [ 22 The neuroprotective effect of ITF6475 was further supported by changes in NfL levels at the end of treatment. While all PTX-treated groups exhibited significant NfL elevations, those receiving ITF6475 had considerably lower increases compared to mice treated with PTX alone or in combination with ricolinostat. This observation, together with the significant protection of reduction in digital nerve SNAP induced by PTX administration achieved by the co-administration of ricolinostat and ITF6475 at the 1 mg/kg dose, suggests that a positive effect was observed on large myelinated fibers, although it seems that small fibers are more effectively protected, based on behavioral and IENF density assessments. This finding is largely consistent with previous studies on HDAC6 inhibitors, which focused on less severe neurotoxic exposure and lacked detailed pathological assessments of myelinated fibers. Nonetheless, these studies consistently demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibitors alleviate small fiber neuropathy and neuropathic pain, as evidenced by behavioral assessments and IENF density measurements. In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that HDAC6 inhibitors, particularly ITF6475, can effectively prevent small fiber damage in a severe, chronic PIPN model, as demonstrated through behavioral, pathological, and serological evaluations. The difference in the neuroprotective efficacy between small and large myelinated fibers may stem from the severity of nerve damage in our PIPN model, which involves prolonged high-dose PTX exposure. Alternatively, it could indicate a selective efficacy of this neuroprotective strategy.
