It is rare—less than 40 cases have been reported to date. The typical radiological features are those of an expansile lytic lesion with chondroid calcification, cortical destruction and frequent extraosseous extension, suggesting an aggressive benign or low-grade malignant tumour. On MRI the lesion returns low T1 and high T2 signal and usually shows intense contrast enhancement. Histologically the lesion is characterised by a spindle cell proliferation, areas of ossification and benign cartilage nodules resembling the epiphyseal plate, the latter considered the hallmark of this tumour. We present a case of fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma in the rib of a 28-year-old female, a very uncommon location for this tumour. The case is also exceptional because of the age of the patient and its unusual imaging appearances: the lesion showed no evidence of chondral-type matrix mineralisation, displayed profound T2 hypointensity and only minimal enhancement following intravenous Gadolinium administration. fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma bone tumour rib chest atypical CT MRI pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Clinical presentation A 28-year-old female presented to her general practitioner with breathlessness on a background of recurrent infections following an episode of COVID-19 infection. The patient reported intermittent pain in the left shoulder, which was exacerbated by deep inspiration and lifting, as well as paraesthesia in the left hand following strenuous activity. There was no palpable mass. The patient was a non-smoker with no relevant past medical history. The chest was clear on auscultation and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. A chest radiograph was performed which showed a well-marginated, peripherally calcified expansile lytic lesion arising from the left first rib ( Figure 1 Figure 1. Posteroanterior chest radiograph targeting the left upper zone showing a well-circumscribed peripherally calcified (arrows) expansile lytic lesion arising from the left first rib. Linear densities projected over the mass are also likely to reflect predominantly peripheral mineralisation. The appearances suggest the mass is extrapulmonary. CT of the chest confirmed an expansile lytic lesion involving most of the first rib, sparing the posterior 2.8 cm but reaching the costochondral junction anteriorly ( Figure 2 Figure 2. Axial (superior A; inferior B), coronal (C) and sagittal (D) CT images of the left first rib. There is marked expansile remodelling of the rib with anterolateral chest wall deformity. The proximal interface with the bone is not aggressive (arrow, A). The peripheral calcification on radiographs corresponds to irregular cortical thickening; there are intermittent cortical breaches (C). Other calcific foci, the appearances of which suggest curvilinear ossification, are predominantly peripheral (asterisk). Fusiform expansion of the rib is seen (D). On MRI, the lesion demonstrated profound but heterogeneous low signal intensity on all sequences. The predominantly peripheral areas of ossification were hyperintense on fluid-sensitive sequences (T2-weighted/STIR) ( Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 3. Coronal T1 (A) and STIR (B), axial T1 (C) and T2-weighted (D) MR images of the lesion. It shows heterogeneous low signal intensity on all sequences. There is no perilesional oedema. Lobular hyperintense areas are seen on fluid-sensitive sequences, corresponding to ossified foci on CT (arrows, B and D). Figure 4. Axial T1 pre- and post-contrast fat-saturated (A, B) MR images demonstrate enhancement of the ossified foci (asterisks) and periphery of the lesion (arrows, B). These appearances raised the possibility of fibrous dysplasia given the low T2 signal on MRI, but bone destruction was thought to be unusually aggressive. CT guided needle biopsy of the lesion was performed under general anaesthesia. Initial histology suggested a fibrous tumour which was difficult to classify but with no features to suggest malignancy.

Discussion Fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma (FM) is an extremely rare intra-osseous lesion which was first described by Dahlin et al in 1984. 1 2–4 Most cases of FM have occurred in the long bones of children and young adults, with occasional cases in flat bones and vertebrae: the median age at diagnosis is 13 years, but there is a wide range (three months to 27 years) and a slight male predilection. 2 1 , 2 5 Radiographically, FM is lytic, shows expansile remodelling, cortical destruction and frequent extra osseous extension. 2 , 6 1 , 2 , 7 2 , 3 , 7 2 Our patient presented at quite an old age for this diagnosis (28 years) - the second oldest recorded case. The location of this lesion in the rib is rare (only the third documented case in a rib). 1 , 4 3 8 2 Radiological differential diagnoses in general include fibrous (such as fibrous dysplasia, fibrosarcoma, desmoplastic fibroma, and chondromyxoid fibroma) and cartilaginous (chondrosarcomas, including clear cell, dedifferentiated and mesenchymal) tumours. Other possible radiological diagnoses include plasmacytoma and giant cell tumour. Mesenchymal hamartoma of the chest wall can resemble FM radiologically and histologically: it occurs almost exclusively in infants, an age group which is only rarely affected by FM. Overlapping imaging features include an extrapleural lesion, an expansile rib mass and mineralisation which is usually chondroid in nature. However, chest wall hamartomas can erode and displace adjacent ribs and show haemorrhagic, peripherally enhancing cystic spaces (secondary aneurysmal changes). 9 The lesion that most closely resembles FM radiologically is fibrous dysplasia with cartilaginous differentiation (fibrocartilaginous dysplasia), which can be indistinguishable. 2 10 GNAS 2 Close histological mimics include desmoplastic fibroma and low-grade central osteosarcoma (LGCOS), which can resemble each other if ossification in the latter is inconspicuous. Confirmation of FM from needle biopsy alone can be difficult: a recent case of FM of the pelvis was diagnosed as desmoplastic fibroma due to the lack of cartilaginous nodules. 3 In summary, fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma is an extremely rare intra-osseous lesion, and the rib is one of the most unusual sites. Imaging features can closely resemble fibrous dysplasia with cartilaginous differentiation. The case presented in this report was atypical in lacking chondroid matrix mineralisation, the typical strong post-gadolinium enhancement and showing profound hypointensity on fluid-sensitive MR sequences. Needle biopsy can be misleading if the histological hallmark of the lesion, cartilaginous nodules resembling the epiphyseal growth plate, is inconspicuous. Learning points Fibrocartilaginous mesenchymoma can rarely present in the rib as a lytic expansile destructive lesion. Imaging most closely resembles fibrous dysplasia with cartilaginous differentiation. In our case the lesion demonstrated profound hypointensity on fluid sensitive MR sequences, a paucity of enhancement and lack of chondroid mineralisation. These atypical features have not been previously reported. Needle biopsy alone may be misleading if the growth-plate-like, nodular, cartilaginous component is not identified.
