Background An increasing number of cancer medicines are being developed and approved. Access to these medicines is important for improving patient outcomes and overall quality of care, yet achieving equitable access across countries in Europe is challenging. Method This study reviews inequities in access to novel cancer medicines in countries of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA), and neighboring countries, at three critical stages: regulatory approval, reimbursement approval, and use in clinical practice. It also examines reasons contributing to these inequities. The analysis builds on published evidence from a predefined set of international stakeholders. Results Inequities vary across the three stages. At the regulatory stage, disparities are minimized within EU/EEA countries due to centralized approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), while worse access exists outside this region. Reimbursement of EMA-approved medicines varies significantly, with rates ranging from 0% in Malta to 96% in Germany, and timelines spanning <100 days to nearly 1000 days. Alternative access schemes enable (limited) access before and after regulatory and reimbursement approval, which may change conclusions about access in some countries. Clinical use exhibits a 10-fold difference across countries in some cases, with Central and Eastern Europe consistently lagging. Contributing factors include country-specific prioritization of pharmaceutical companies for regulatory and reimbursement applications, health technology assessment (HTA) processes and criteria, constraints in financial resources for medicines and testing infrastructure, suboptimal care processes, organization, and continuing medical education. Conclusion Patient access to novel medicines differs widely across European countries, caused by financial, organizational, administrative, and capacity reasons. Policy harmonization, as seen with mandatory regulatory approval by the EMA and the EU HTA Regulation, has the potential to reduce inequities, but it will not address underlying economic and health care system constraints. Achieving equity will require a balance between innovation, affordability, and sustainability in health care systems. Highlights • Access to novel cancer medicines in Europe varies widely at regulatory, reimbursement, and clinical use stages. • EMA approval eliminates regulatory disparities in EU/EEA, but access lags in all other countries, notably in Eastern Europe. • Reimbursement rates and timelines vary greatly across countries, with best access in Germany. • Clinical use shows up to 10-fold differences, with Central and Eastern Europe trailing countries in other regions. • Equity requires aligning innovation with affordability, system capacity, and sustainability in health care systems.

A significant challenge for health care payers with constrained budgets are the prices of new cancer medicines (i.e. monthly/annual costs per treatment), which have been increasing since 2000 (based on list prices). 12 , 13 14 1 Another challenge is the lack of robust evidence on the relative effectiveness of new cancer medicines when regulatory bodies or third-party payers make their assessments. For instance, in regulatory approvals of cancer medicines by the EMA from 2017 to 2022, the proportion of single-arm trials underpinning the approval rose from 28.6% to 53.6%. 15 16 17 18 1 , 14 , 19 20 21 22 Material and methods Study design and definitions According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), access to new cancer medicines is a multidimensional concept encompassing availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality. 22 , 23 Existing evidence on access to new cancer medicines in Europe was reviewed. Reports and studies published by a predefined set of international stakeholders from 2015 until April 2025 were considered; see Supplementary Appendix A https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105810 The definition of cancer medicines and the geographical coverage of Europe in this review follows the definition used in the underlying source. Novel (or new or innovative) medicines are usually defined as those that have been launched anywhere globally within the last 1-15 years and still have market exclusivity. Essential cancer medicines that are on the World Health Organization’s Essential Medicines List (WHO EML) are not the focus here. The geographical focus is on countries of the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) and neighboring countries. Data analysis and outcome measures The metrics to quantify inequities in access across countries come mainly from the underlying source. For regulatory approval, this included the proportion of approved medicines relative to some reference basket, as well as the time until approval. For reimbursement approval, the two main metrics were the proportion of medicines with regulatory approval that are reimbursed and the time from regulatory to reimbursement approval. For use in clinical practice, the measurement is more complicated in the absence of standard units for all cancer medicines such as defined daily dose, 24 22 Results Regulatory approval The authorization of a new medicine by the regulatory agency in a country is the first stage for patient access. The decision to approve is made after an assessment of the evidence on safety, quality, and efficacy provided by the applying pharmaceutical company. Inequities across countries There are no inequities in regulatory approval across EU/EEA countries, while all other European countries experience fewer and slower approvals; see Supplementary Appendix B https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105810 25 26 , 27 22 , 27 , 28 20 , 29 It should also be noted that some patients may have access to new cancer medicines before regulatory approval through alternative access schemes, 30 14 , 31 32 14 22 Reasons for inequities Two main reasons for inequities in regulatory approval across countries have been cited by the OECD. 22 33 28 , 34 Reimbursement approval Decisions to reimburse/cover an authorized medicine and include it in the drug formulary are made by third-party payers (government, sickness funds, health insurances) at the national or even subnational level in European countries. 14 Inequities across countries Landmark studies by ESMO and an annual report by EFPIA about the reimbursement status of new cancer medicines in Europe show that high-income countries in Northern, Western, and Southern Europe generally reimbursed the greatest proportion of medicines, while less affluent, mostly non-EU countries in CEE reimburse fewer medicines. 19 , 35 , 36 19 , 36 Supplementary Appendix B https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105810 35 14 37 Figures 1 2 Figure 1 Proportion of EMA-approved cancer medicines with local reimbursement in 2024 compared to countries’ GDP per capita in 2023. 35 Figure 2 Time from EMA approval to local reimbursement in days for new cancer medicines in 2024 compared with countries’ GDP per capita in 2023. 35 Studies by the OECD that have focused on the reimbursement status of specific indications of cancer medicines generally found a similar pattern of slower reimbursement and a lower reimbursed proportion in CEE countries together with Malta. 14 , 22 38 20 , 29 , 31 , 39 , 40 Certain nuances in studies on reimbursement are noteworthy, which may change conclusions about access in some countries. Firstly, reimbursement is often not a binary decision, as the eligible patient population might be restricted compared with the scope of regulatory approval or there might be restrictions on physician or provider specializations allowed to prescribe (e.g. only specialized centers). 30 14 , 35 , 38 14 , 41 30 Reasons for inequities Many different reasons have been established to explain differences in reimbursement and the time to reimbursement across European countries. In general, the total time period is shaped by factors and processes that are in control of both the applying company and the national authorities as noted by the OECD and EFPIA. 22 , 33 14 , 33 42 , 43 14 Processing times for P&R applications most often account for the majority of the time between EMA approval to reimbursement approval. 14 22 33 33 38 33 33 Third-party payers may anticipate insufficient budget to implement reimbursement decisions. 22 , 33 44 Use in clinical practice A positive reimbursement/coverage decision by a third-party payer does not necessarily translate into immediate access for all intended patients across a country. Only when a medicine is prescribed will it be accessible to patients in clinical practice. Inequities across countries The latest available numbers on the use of cancer medicines across European countries in costs and volume are from 2023 1 Supplementary Appendix B https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105810 1 1 , 21 Figure 3 21 Figure 4 Figure 3 Uptake of targeted lung cancer medicines in standard weekly doses per lung cancer death in 2023 compared to countries’ GDP per capita in 2023. 1 Figure 4 Uptake of trastuzumab in standard weekly doses per breast cancer death in 2018 compared to countries’ GDP per capita in 2018. 21 Medicine shortages might also affect use. Studies by ESMO found that reimbursed medicines were almost always available in Western Europe when prescribed, but less so in CEE, especially in non-EU Eastern European countries. 19 , 36 An important question is whether medicines have been prescribed according to clinical guidelines. A study of treatment patterns in non-small-cell lung cancer in 12 countries showed that, compared with recommended standards in ESMO guidelines, most countries seemed to treat a lower proportion of patients with cancer medicines than recommended, with Poland and the UK only treating about half of the recommended patient population. 45 45 Reasons for inequities Several interconnected reasons may explain country differences in the use of new cancer medicines in clinical practice. ESMO emphasizes the cost and affordability of newer medicines as a major factor contributing to inequities. 19 33 46 19 33 , 47 , 48 Testing infrastructure constraints are another pivotal reason. There is a large variation in the availability of adequate diagnostic facilities across countries, especially for advanced molecular testing required for many new cancer medicines. 49 , 50 31 , 49 , 50 51 14 Slow adoption of new cancer medicines is another reason. Despite reimbursement, new medicines may take months or years to be used on a broad scale in all clinics across a country and in all clinically eligible patients. 14 , 52 14 , 33 14 , 46 Discussion With rising cancer incidence, the urgency for access to new and effective medicines is increasing. Regulatory approval is a necessary but not a sufficient prerequisite for reimbursement approval, which in turn is often a necessary but not a sufficient prerequisite for access in clinical practice. In discussions of access to new medicines it is therefore important to define at which stage in the lifecycle of a medicine and in which way access is measured. Across European countries, equitable access to new cancer medicines remains elusive, except at the regulatory stage in the EU/EEA countries. A diverse list of reasons for inequities has been identified, going beyond the financial dimension and also pointing to organizational, capacity, and administrative aspects. Interestingly, there seems to be broad consensus on most of these reasons across the reviewed reports and studies of the included stakeholders. The centralized marketing authorization by the EMA has eliminated disparities in regulatory approval within the EU/EEA. However, inequities and worse access persist outside this co-operation, particularly in Serbia, Türkiye, and other Eastern Europe countries. Switzerland and the UK have joined Project Orbis together with other regulatory bodies from high-income countries to accelerate approval, 53 54 Reimbursement inequities are much pronounced, with significant variation in both the reimbursed proportion of EMA-approved medicines and the time to reimbursement. Economic factors, coupled with companies’ launch strategies, the complexities of national HTA processes and cost-effectiveness thresholds, and administrative hurdles, contribute to worse access in CEE countries than those in Northern and Western Europe. However, both the OECD and EFPIA note that a 100% reimbursement rate of EMA-approved medicines/indications is neither necessary nor essential from a clinical perspective. 22 , 33 14 55 , 56 17 38 Two recent developments might reduce disparities in reimbursement in the coming years. Firstly, in 2022, EFPIA member companies issued a commitment to file P&R applications in all EU countries no later than 2 years after EMA approval, provided that local systems allow it. 57 The use of new cancer medicines in clinical practice varies greatly across Europe, with CEE countries recording the lowest usage rates, which can have implications for patient outcomes. Factors contributing to these disparities include the costs and affordability of medicines together with underfunded health care budgets, limited diagnostic infrastructure and routines and funding for biomarker testing, delays in integrating new treatments into local guidelines and protocols, and imbalances in continuing medical education. Addressing these barriers requires investment in health care, infrastructure, human resources, and organization. Establishing regional centers of excellence and promoting cross-border collaborations could enhance capacity in resource-constrained countries. Limitations This review has several limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, the analysis relies heavily on evidence from a set of international stakeholders. While these sources provide valuable insights, their perspectives may be influenced by specific agendas or focus areas, potentially introducing bias. Secondly, measuring access to cancer medicines is inherently challenging due to the lack of standardized metrics. The use of different methodologies across studies, such as self-reported survey responses from local experts or the use of sales data that is partly estimated, could introduce variability in findings. Moreover, many analyses only focus on a medicine and its first approved indication but not any subsequent indications, which limits the generalizability of the findings. The timeframe for follow-up in many studies is limited, which may underestimate the (time to) reimbursement and use. A differentiation of medicine access along ESMO-MCBS scores would be desirable to measure access according to clinical benefit. Thirdly, the studies reviewed often rely on aggregated national-level data, which may not fully capture subnational disparities in access. Local differences in health care infrastructure, resource allocation, and decision-making processes may contribute to inequities in clinical use that are not evident in national averages. The establishment of nationwide clinical cancer registries would help create real-time monitoring systems for treatment uptake and outcomes across all hospitals. Collecting structured real-world data from electronic patient records is the most important basis for establishing real-world evidence on the clinical effectiveness of new cancer medicines. The analysis of treatment patterns, adherence to guidelines, and meeting quality targets could provide valuable insights to guide policy interventions and improve equitable use. At present, there is a fundamental lack of these data in most countries. Finally, while this review synthesized information on reason for inequities in access, the underlying qualitative insights were not always systematically collected. Future research incorporating qualitative methods would enhance the understanding of barriers to access and guide more targeted interventions. By addressing these limitations, future studies can provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of inequities in access to cancer medicines across Europe. Conclusion Achieving equitable access to novel cancer medicines in Europe remains a significant challenge and demands a multifaceted approach. While regulatory approval processes have achieved harmonization within the EU/EEA, stark differences persist in reimbursement and use in clinical practice. Transferring more competences from the national to the European level, as exemplified by the EMA and the recent EU HTA Regulation, could reduce inequities. However, addressing disparities in reimbursement and clinical use requires local solutions tailored to each country’s economic and health care system constraints. Policymakers should prioritize medicines with proven clinical value, align reimbursement decisions with available resources, and consider investing more in health care where needed, especially in CEE countries. More data-driven online monitoring systems through clinical cancer registries to track utilization patterns of new medicines—also compared with recommended standards in clinical guidelines—should be established and feed into a permanent quality assurance cycle. This should be complemented by qualitative research to understand deviations from recommended standards and to help design solutions. Ultimately, achieving equity will require a balance between innovation, affordability, and sustainability in health care systems. References 1 Manzano A. Svedman C. Hofmarcher T. Wilking N.
