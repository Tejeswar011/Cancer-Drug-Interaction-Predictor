Despite its well-documented carcinogenicity, critical gaps remain in understanding the health impacts of chronic low-level airborne exposure and the multi-modal mechanisms driving inorganic arsenic toxicity. This narrative review synthesizes recent molecular research and population health data to explain how airborne inorganic arsenic causes harm through multiple biological pathways. Key novel insights include (1) a comprehensive analysis of inorganic arsenic-induced oxidative stress and epigenetic dysregulation, revealing transgenerational effects via germline epigenetic markers; (2) a critical evaluation of the linear no-threshold (LNT) model, demonstrating its overestimation of low-dose risks by 2–3× compared to threshold-based evidence; and (3) descriptions of mechanistic links between inorganic arsenic speciation, organ-specific pathologies (e.g., neurodevelopmental impairments, cardiovascular diseases), and pollution mitigation strategies. This study connects molecular mechanisms with public health strategies to improve arsenic risk assessment. It focuses on how inorganic arsenic alters gene regulation (epigenetics) and combines exposure from multiple sources, while also clarifying uncertainties about low-dose effects and refining safety standards. airborne inorganic arsenic toxicological mechanisms risk assessment carcinogen This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Arsenic (As), a naturally occurring metalloid with an average crustal abundance of 1.5–2 mg/kg, exhibits complex environmental behavior due to its diverse chemical speciation [ 1 2 III V 3 3 4 5 3 6 7 8 9 Although arsenic exposure via drinking water has been extensively characterized, the risks of airborne inhalation remain underappreciated [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 2 11 2. Methods 2.1. Search Strategy A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Web of Science databases for publications from 1 January 2000 to 1 June 2025. Search terms included ‘airborne arsenic,’ ‘toxicity mechanisms,’ and ‘risk assessment,’ restricted to English-language studies. Inclusion criteria encompassed sample size (>20), experimental controls, and statistical rigor. 2.2. Quality Assessment Eligible studies were required to report direct measurements of ambient total arsenic concentration, molecular toxicology assays (e.g., in human cell lines or animal models), or epidemiological analyses of ambient arsenic exposure. Only peer-reviewed journal articles and reports were considered. Exclusions involved studies with (1) fewer than 10 participants; (2) a lack of original data or reliance on secondary analyses; or (3) simulated exposures in molecular toxicology or epidemiological contexts. 3. Levels of Airborne Arsenic 3.1. Global Distribution The global distribution of airborne arsenic is characterized by spatial heterogeneity, primarily dictated by the intensity of pollution sources, meteorological conditions, and geographical features [ 16 3 17 3 17 Figure 1 17 17 17 18 19 20 Arsenic concentrations in industrial hotspots have increased by several orders of magnitude ( Figure 1 21 22 3 3 17 23 2.5 3 3 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 18 3 23 30 18 3 17 18 3 18 31 32 3.2. Chemical Forms The environmental behavior and biological toxicity of airborne arsenic are intrinsically linked to its chemical speciation [ 10 III V 3 10 3 3− 4 3− 2.5 31 III V 32 17 Organic arsenic compounds, including methylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), have been detected in atmospheric particulate matter in specific environments such as coastal regions and marshlands, at concentrations raging from 0.01 pg/m 3 3 8 8 25 The association of arsenic with PM 2 5 17 33 III 33 9 3.3. Particle Size-Dependent Deposition The health implications of inhaled arsenic are critically dependent on the aerodynamic diameter of the carrier particles, which governs their deposition patterns within the respiratory tract and subsequent systemic bioavailability [ 4 4 26 4 26 4 26 26 3 4 2 5 3 4 3.4. Intervention Effects on Temporal Trends Long-term monitoring data provide compelling evidence that concerted pollution control measures (e.g., flue gas desulfurization, baghouse filters, etc.) can significantly attenuate airborne arsenic concentrations [ 32 2 5 34 35 36 37 38 18 35 9 4. Biological Transport Mechanisms and Metabolic Fate While ingestion through drinking water remains the predominant exposure route for the general population, inhalation represents a toxicologically distinct pathway that bypasses first-pass hepatic metabolism and leads to prolonged retention in lung tissue [ 39 39 39 The deep penetration of fine particulate arsenic into the alveolar region facilitates rapid dissolution in the pulmonary surfactant layer and efficient absorption into the systemic circulation [ 39 39 39 Following gastrointestinal and/or pulmonary absorption, inorganic arsenic undergoes a complex process of systemic distribution, biotransformation (primarily methylation), and elimination [ 4 9 39 13 40 41 A growing body of epidemiological evidence has established positive associations between ambient airborne arsenic exposure and a spectrum of adverse health outcomes, particularly cardiovascular effects such as myocardial infarction, coronary events, impaired heart rate variability, hypertension, systemic oxidative stress, and inflammation [ 42 43 44 42 43 44 5. Molecular Mechanisms of Arsenic Toxicity The toxicity of airborne arsenic is not attributable to a single pathway but rather emerges from a cascade of interconnected molecular events predominantly driven by oxidative stress [ 45 46 47 III 5.1. Multiple Pathways of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) Generation The excessive generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) constitutes a critical initiating event in arsenic toxicity driven by multiple synergistic pathways ( Figure 2 III 45 45 46 47 45 46 47 5.2. Collapse of Antioxidant Defense Systems In parallel to inducing ROS production, arsenic systematically dismantles the cell’s antioxidant defense network [ 48 49 50 3 3 48 49 50 III 48 49 50 5.3. Molecular Consequences of Oxidative Damage The relentless oxidative assault orchestrated by arsenic manifests as extensive damage to all major classes of biomolecules, driving cellular dysfunction and death [ 51 51 52 Lipid peroxidation is another major outcome. ROS can attack polyunsaturated fatty acids in cellular membranes, generating reactive aldehydes like malondialdehyde (MDA). MDA, in turn, cross-links with membrane proteins, impairing the function of critical transporters like Na + + 53 54 55 Organelle integrity is not spared. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER), under oxidative duress, activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which can culminate in apoptosis [ 45 53 56 45 53 56 6. Signaling Pathway Disorders The widespread molecular damage induced by arsenic inevitably leads to the dysregulation of critical cellular signaling networks that govern cell fate, identity, and function [ 57 58 59 57 58 59 6.1. Abnormal DNA Methylation Arsenic exerts a profound and paradoxical influence on the epigenetic landscape, primarily through disrupting DNA methylation patterns. It depletes S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor. SAM is utilized for both the methylation and detoxification of arsenic, and its depletion leads to DNA hypomethylation [ 57 57 58 59 Conversely, arsenic also induces localized promoter hypermethylation of specific tumor suppressor genes [ 59 60 9 59 60 These epigenetic alterations are not limited to the exposed individual; arsenic can cause hypermethylation at imprinting control regions (e.g., H19) in germ cells and placental tissue, which is associated with adverse developmental outcomes like low birth weight, suggesting a mechanism for its transgenerational effects [ 61 62 6.2. Reprogramming of Histone Modifications The pattern of covalent modifications on histone proteins is another key epigenetic target of arsenic [ 54 63 64 65 The balance of histone methylation is also skewed. Arsenic reduces repressive marks like H3K27me3 by inhibiting the methyltransferase EZH2, while it increases activating marks like H3K4me3 [ 66 67 68 66 67 68 65 66 67 68 6.3. Dysregulation of Non-Coding RNA Networks The regulatory roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) represent a critical layer of arsenic’s toxic influence. Arsenic exposure remodels the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile, often promoting a pro-oncogenic environment [ 69 70 71 69 70 71 Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also involved. The expression of lncRNA MALAT1 is highly elevated in arsenic-transformed cells. MALAT1 acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) or sponge, sequestering miR-200c and further enhancing ZEB1 expression, thereby stabilizing a pro-metastatic gene program [ 72 73 72 73 6.4. Transgenerational Epigenetic Effects Perhaps one of the most concerning aspects of arsenic toxicity is its capacity to inflict health effects that transcend the exposed generation. This is particularly notable following oral exposure, such as through contaminated drinking water. Animal studies involving oral administration show that ingested arsenic causes systemic epigenetic changes in sperm and eggs [ 62 74 62 74 In zebrafish models, ancestral arsenic exposure results in hundreds of differentially methylated sites in the sperm of F2 males, with these sites enriched in genes critical for development and signaling [ 62 74 BDNF 62 74 7. Regulatory Disorders The epigenetic and oxidative damage orchestrated by arsenic converges on the dysregulation of core signal transduction pathways that are fundamental to controlling cell growth, stress response, and inflammation [ 75 76 7.1. Disorder of MAPK Signaling Network Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways respond to arsenic in a biphasic, dose-dependent manner. At low doses, arsenic promotes cell proliferation and survival by preferentially activating the Raf-MEK-ERK signaling axis. This is characterized by increased phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, leading to a elevated proliferation index in cells like keratinocytes [ 75 76 77 In stark contrast, high-dose arsenic exposure activates the stress-responsive JNK and p38 MAPK pathways [ 75 76 77 75 76 77 7.2. Dysregulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling The PI3K/AKT pathway, a central regulator of metabolism, growth, and survival, is profoundly affected by arsenic in a time-dependent manner. Short-term exposure can activate AKT, providing a transient survival signal [ 70 78 70 78 A key downstream effector of AKT is the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a master regulator of protein synthesis and cell growth [ 56 78 56 78 56 78 7.3. Activation of NF-κB Inflammatory Signaling The transcription factor NF-κB is a primary mediator of inflammatory responses and is chronically activated by arsenic, creating a persistent state of low-grade inflammation. Arsenic induces the phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of IκBα, the inhibitor that sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm. This releases NF-κB dimers (e.g., p65/p50) to translocate into the nucleus [ 44 79 Furthermore, As III 44 80 44 80 −/− 44 80 44 80 7.4. Calcium Signaling and Cytoskeletal Regulation Arsenic disruption of calcium homeostasis affects cellular functions [ 15 73 44 Arsenic disrupts the precise spatiotemporal control of intracellular calcium (Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 81 Elevated cytosolic Ca 2+ 81 81 2+ 81 8. Organ-Specific Toxicity Mechanisms The systemic distribution of arsenic following inhalation exposure culminates in distinct pathologies across major organ systems ( Figure 3 77 82 83 84 85 8.1. Neurotoxicity Arsenic-induced neurotoxicity presents a dual challenge, impairing both developmental processes in the young and accelerating degenerative pathways in adults ( Figure 3 77 82 83 84 85 77 82 83 84 85 51 77 78 77 82 83 84 85 8.2. Hepatotoxicity The liver, as a primary site of arsenic metabolism, is particularly vulnerable [ 86 87 88 86 87 88 86 87 88 8.3. Nephrotoxicity The kidney’s role in concentrating and excreting arsenic makes it a key target for damage primarily affecting the proximal tubules [ 89 90 91 + + 89 90 91 89 90 91 8.4. Cutaneous Toxicity Dermatological manifestations provide visible markers of chronic arsenic exposure [ 92 93 92 93 92 93 92 93 8.5. Cardiovascular Toxicity Arsenic wreaks havoc on the cardiovascular system by targeting endothelial homeostasis [ 44 94 44 94 44 94 44 94 8.6. Reproductive Toxicity Arsenic’s reproductive toxicity exhibits stark gender specificity and extends transgenerationally via epigenetic inheritance. Studies administering doses such as 50 mg/kg sodium arsenite in rodent models (e.g., mice) have observed these effects in offspring after only one to two generations of exposure [ 74 95 96 74 95 96 74 95 96 Section 6.4 9. Health Risk Assessment and Regulatory Challenges The translation of mechanistic toxicology into public health policy remains fraught with challenges, primarily due to outdated risk models and inadequate regulatory frameworks that fail to capture the complexity of arsenic toxicity. 9.1. Controversies in Carcinogenic Risk Assessment Models The prevailing Linear No-Threshold (LNT) model, used by agencies like the U.S.’s EPA, estimates cancer risk from infinitesimally low doses by extrapolating linearly from high-exposure occupational data [ 39 97 This model derives an inhalation Unit Risk Factor that predicts 43 excess lung cancers per 100,000 individuals from lifetime exposure to 1 μg/m 3 3 39 97 39 97 39 97 39 97 9.2. Current Regulatory Standards and Limitations As shown in Table 1 98 99 100 3 10 3 3 98 99 100 9.3. Scientific Challenges in Standard Setting Three major gaps undermine current regulatory efforts. First, standards regulate airborne arsenic in isolation, ignoring the aggregate risk from concurrent exposure via drinking water, food, and soil, leading to a significant underestimation of total body burden and health risk. Second, children and pregnant women exhibit heightened susceptibility due to developmental vulnerabilities and immature detoxification systems, yet no standards incorporate safety factors to protect these groups specifically. Regulating total arsenic, rather than distinguishing between highly toxic inorganic species (e.g., As(OH) 3 3 42 95 99 9.4. Biological Monitoring and Risk Early Warning Moving beyond environmental concentration measurements, biomarker-based strategies offer a path toward personalized risk assessment [ 40 52 59 100 40 52 59 40 52 59 10. Future Research Directions Bridging the identified knowledge gaps requires a concerted shift toward innovative methodologies and interdisciplinary integration. Priority must be given to defining the dose–response curve for low-dose, chronic inhalation exposure using sensitive omics technologies. Long-term animal inhalation studies coupled with single-cell epigenomic profiling (e.g., scATAC-seq) of target tissues like lung and brain will elucidate the precise thresholds for epigenetic dysregulation. Furthermore, multi-generational model studies are essential to decipher the mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance and identify germline-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that serve as biomarkers for transgenerational risk [ 57 62 74 3 102 103 104 73 105 To overcome the current regulatory silos, we must develop and validate integrated PBPK/PD models that simulate arsenic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics across the life course, incorporating genetic (AS3MT status), physiological (pregnancy), and nutritional (folate levels) variables. These models should aggregate exposure from all relevant routes (air, water, diet, dust) to generate a holistic risk estimate, providing a scientifically robust foundation for setting truly protective public health standards [ 40 97 11. Conclusions This review synthesizes the substantial and complex body of evidence on the toxicology of airborne arsenic, delineating a pathway from molecular insult to public health crisis. I have established that arsenic’s toxicity is not a simple story of chemical poisoning but a multifaceted saga involving oxidative stress, epigenetic reprogramming, and signaling network disruption, culminating in organ-specific pathologies from neurodevelopmental deficits to carcinogenesis. Our analysis concludes that existing regulatory frameworks are fundamentally inadequate to address this complexity. The rigid LNT model overestimates low-dose risks, while existing standards fail to protect the most vulnerable and ignore the reality of cumulative, multi-route exposure. The way forward demands a paradigm shift. Future research must prioritize defining the nonlinear, low-dose mechanisms and transgenerational consequences. Risk assessment must evolve to embrace integrated, biomonitoring informed models that account for total human exposure. Public health efforts should use new technology to control pollution sources. They should also focus protection on the most vulnerable people. Only through such a comprehensive and mechanistic approach can we hope to mitigate the global health burden imposed by persistent airborne arsenic pollution.
