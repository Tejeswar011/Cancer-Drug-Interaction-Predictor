A recent phase 1 trial demonstrated that inhaled recombinant human interleukin-15 (rhIL-15) immunotherapy is safe and may be effective against lung metastases in dogs with metastatic OSA or melanoma. Notably, baseline lymphopenia correlated with clinical benefit in that trial. Building on these findings, this study evaluates whether preconditioning with doxorubicin to induce transient lymphodepletion before inhaled rhIL-15 immunotherapy improves the overall response rate in dogs with metastatic melanoma or tumors of bone. Methods Dogs with established pulmonary metastases from melanoma or bone tumors were treated with doxorubicin (30 mg/m 2 Results Ten dogs were enrolled, with eight reaching the Day 35 evaluable response assessment. One dog achieved a complete response lasting over 1 year, and two had stable disease, yielding an overall clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 30% and an overall response rate (ORR) of 10%. Doxorubicin preconditioning did not alter the toxicity of inhaled rhIL-15 therapy. While doxorubicin treatment decreased absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC), as expected, this reduction did not improve the CBR or ORR compared to the prior study evaluating inhaled rhIL-15 monotherapy. Transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells did not reveal a significant increase in natural killer or cytotoxic T-cell population frequencies following doxorubicin and inhaled rhIL-15 therapy. Conclusions Preconditioning with standard doses of doxorubicin does not alter the clinical response or safety profile of inhaled rhIL-15 therapy in dogs with advanced pulmonary metastatic disease. Further research is needed to evaluate combinatorial treatment strategies that enhance the efficacy of inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with advanced metastatic disease.

Specifically, naturally occurring canine osteosarcoma (OSA) and melanoma provide an important bridge between preclinical mouse studies and human clinical trials [ 1 2 2 7 8 9 10 8 6 11 8 11 A recent phase 1 trial evaluating inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with metastatic OSA and melanoma demonstrated that the therapy was well tolerated and induced durable responses in a subset of dogs. Furthermore, dogs with a lower baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) were statistically more likely to experience clinical benefit and showed a greater fold increase in ALC after treatment. Therefore, we hypothesized that reduced systemic lymphocyte populations might decrease ‘cytokine sinks’ [ 12 13 14 11 Methods Patient enrollment Complete patient eligibility is outlined within the study operations manual (SOM) (supplemental information). Briefly, this trial recruited client-owned dogs with naturally occurring metastatic bone tumors or melanoma at the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital (VMTH). Dogs were required to be over 1 year old, weigh at least 5 kg, have a Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (VCOG-CTCAE v2) performance score less than 2, and present with one or more lung lesions measuring at least 1 cm in diameter on thoracic radiographs, consistent with gross pulmonary metastatic disease from histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma or tumors of bone [ 15 Study design and treatment The trial schema is provided in Fig. 1 16 8 8  Fig. 1 Study design of clinical trial. Schema of canine clinical trial of doxorubicin and inhaled rhIL-15. Doxorubicin was administered on Day 0, and inhaled rhIL-15 was delivered by nebulizer twice daily for 14 days, starting on Day 7. Blood was drawn prior to treatment and on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 35. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated on Days 0, 7, and 21. Response was evaluated by thoracic radiograph (CXR) on Days 0, 35, 49, and every 8 weeks thereafter Clinical and investigational assessments Clinical assessments, including physical exam and vital signs, were performed at all study visits. On Day 7, temperature and blood pressure were measured before the first inhaled rhIL-15 treatment and 1 h, 3 h, and 5 h post-treatment. Follow-up visits, including physical examinations, CBC, and PBMC collections, were performed before doxorubicin administration on Day 0, before initiation of inhaled rhIL-15 on Day 7, and on Day 14, and Day 21 (Fig. 1 15 8 17 NanoString nCounter Whole blood was collected in EDTA tubes from patients at Day 0 (pre-doxorubicin), Day 7 (post doxorubicin), and Day 21 (post-rhIL-15). PBMCs were isolated via Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation and frozen in liquid nitrogen for later RNA extraction. RNA was isolated from frozen PBMC using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo International) according to the manufacturer’s modified protocol for “RNA purification from the aqueous phase after Tri Reagent extraction.” Briefly, PBMC were mixed with 500 µL Trizol and further lysed using a bead mill. 100 µL of chloroform was added to the lysate, mixed well and centrifuged. The aqueous phase was removed, mixed with an equal volume of 100% ethanol and added to a Zymo-Spin IICR column. After centrifugation and a quick wash, on-column DNA digestion was performed, followed by additional washes. Total RNA was eluted with 35µL RNAse/DNAse free water and 1 µg was submitted to Canopy Biosciences (Hayward, CA) for quality testing (Qubit and Bioanlyzer) and NanoString nCounter analysis. DV200 values were above 40% for all samples and RIN values ranged from 2 to 9. Gene expression analysis of 780 genes (Supplementary Table 1) was performed using the NanoString nCounter Canine Immuno-oncology (IO) Panel (Seattle, WA, USA). Data was analyzed using NanoString’s nSolver Analysis Software v4.0 with Advanced Analysis Module v2.0 plugin and included differential gene expression (DGE) analysis, gene set analysis (GSA), and cell type profiling. For cell type profiling analysis, we utilized the cell type scores to analyze the relative immune cell abundance levels across the time points in this study. The cell type score is calculated as the mean of the log2 expression levels for the probes linked to the specific cell type of interest. From this calculation, the cell type abundance in a single sample cannot be quantified, but the relative cell abundance level across time points or conditions can be analyzed. Here, we evaluated differences in cell type scores in the patient PBMCs across Days 0, 7, and 21. Patient samples were paired across timepoints for DGE analysis, and statistical significance was determined through the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Statistical design and power analysis A sample size of ten was estimated to provide 80% power to detect an overall response rate (ORR) change from 11 to 50% using conditioning chemotherapy, a difference between our historical ORR (the null hypothesis) and the higher ORR of interest at the 0.05 level (1-sided). Using this study design, it is unlikely that modest improvements in ORR would be detected. Graph generation and statistical analysis were performed through GraphPad Prism software (v10.2.3). Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were utilized to examine survival outcomes. Statistical significance was defined as p Results Clinical characteristics Ten dogs were enrolled in the study, including five dogs with OSA, four with melanoma, and one with multilobular tumor of bone (MLB). Of the four dogs with melanoma, prior to clinical trial enrollment, two had failed previous immunotherapy with the ONCEPT® Canine Melanoma Vaccine (Patient 205 and 210), two had surgery to remove the primary tumor (Patient 207 and 210), and one received palliative radiation (Patient 210). Following the clinical trial, one dog with melanoma received palliative radiation on Day 35 (Patient 208). In the five dogs with bone tumors, prior to enrollment, four underwent surgery to remove the primary tumor and received carboplatin treatment course; the other dog received palliative radiation (Patient 201). Histological or cytological confirmation of the primary tumor was available in all dogs.

Survival (days) was measured from Day 0 of clinical trial Adverse events All AEs during the 21-day treatment course were captured and are provided in Supplementary Table 2. One patient experienced a serious AE following doxorubicin, developing a grade 4 neutropenia and grade 2 fever, which resolved within 2 days following hospitalization and supportive care. No other treatment-related serious AEs (grade 3 or above) were attributed to either the doxorubicin or inhaled rhIL-15 treatments. Overall, preconditioning doxorubicin did not alter the toxicity compared to the initial phase 1 trial [ 8 Hematologic changes The objective of this study was to determine if lymphocyte reduction would improve response to inhaled rhIL-15. Hematologic parameters were evaluated to confirm doxorubicin resulted in lympho-reduction. The ALC significantly decreased 7 days after doxorubicin administration (Day 7) compared to baseline (Day 0), declining from a mean ALC of 1452 to 1023 cells/µL ( p 2 p p 2 p 2  Fig. 2 CBC values demonstrate significant reduction of WBC, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes seven days after doxorubicin treatment.

Figure 3 3 3  Fig. 3 Preconditioning doxorubicin does not alter clinical response to inhaled rhIL-15. A B C NanoString transcriptomics Using the NanoString nCounter Canine IO Panel, we next analyzed the differential gene expression (DGE) and cell type abundance measurements between patient PBMC collected at Day 0 (pre-doxorubicin), Day 7 (post-doxorubicin), and Day 21 (post-rhIL-15). Through analyzing the proportion of immune cell types – namely T cell subtypes, NK cells, and B cells – we sought to determine whether doxorubicin would induce indiscriminate lympho-reduction at Day 7 and whether inhaled rhIL-15 immunotherapy increased the proportion of cytotoxic cells at Day 21.  Fig. 4 NanoString analysis of patient PBMC samples demonstrates a reduction in B-lymphocyte populations following doxorubicin.

Next, we analyzed cell type scores to assess relative immune cell population abundance levels in all dogs from Day 0 to Day 7. No difference was observed in the proportion of hematopoietic cells, based on scores determined for CD45 + cells (Fig. 4 4 18 4 p 2 p Table 2 Top 20 Down- and upregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PBMCs in dogs before and after treatment with doxorubicin (Day 7 vs. Day 0).

Utilizing pairwise analysis, there were 257 upregulated genes, and 318 downregulated genes in PBMC populations following doxorubicin treatment and two weeks of inhaled rhIL-15 immunotherapy (Day 21), relative to baseline (Day 0) (Supplementary Table 4, Supplementary Fig. 2B). Similar to the cell type score analysis on Day 7, no difference in cell type scores was observed for CD45 + cells, T cells, CD8 + T cells, exhausted CD8 + T cells, cytotoxic cells, Th1 cells, or NK cells from Day 0 to Day 21 (Fig. 5 5  Fig. 5 NanoString analysis of patient PBMC samples demonstrates no significant alteration in T and NK cell type score following 2 weeks of inhaled rhIL-15 treatment. NanoString nCounter platform advanced analysis cell type profiling of patient PBMC samples on Day 21 and 0 using the Benjamini-Hochberg method to determine statistical significance. The cell score is calculated as the mean of the log2 expression levels for the probes linked to the specific cell type of interest. Presented is the mean and standard deviation of cell scores on Day 21 vs. Day 0 for the following cell types— ( A C D E F G H p Given that no differences were observed in the proportion of T cells or NK cells on Day 21 when evaluating all patients together, we sought to determine whether we could observe differences in the evaluated cell type scores in the subset of patients who exhibited clinical benefit in this trial. When analyzing the two dogs with stable disease and the one dog with a CR, we found that there was no significant alteration in the proportion of CD45 + cells, T cells, CD8 + T cells, exhausted CD8 + T cells, cytotoxic cells, Th1 cells, or NK cells on Day 7 vs. Day 0 or Day 21 vs. 0 (Supplementary Fig. 5A-G, 6 A-G). The B cell score was significantly decreased in responder patients on Day 7 and Day 21, as was consistent with the cell type score analysis conducted on all patients (Supplementary Fig. 5H, 6 H). To further elucidate whether transcriptomic changes in the PBMC populations would correlate with clinical benefit, we analyzed the cell type score of T-cells, CD8 + T cells, cytotoxic cells, and exhausted CD8 + T cells on Days 0, 7, and 21 in patients segregated based on response (Supplementary Fig. 7A-D). Interestingly, the single dog with a CR trended towards a higher cell score for T cells, CD8 + T cells, and cytotoxic cells relative to dogs with PD or SD. The patient with a CR also had a low exhausted CD8 + T cell score on Day 0 but was at similar levels to dogs with PD or SD on Days 7 and 21. This observation could support the notion that response to inhaled rhIL-15 therapy may be associated with the proportion of effector immune cell types at baseline. However, no conclusions can be made based on a single observation. Discussion Based on the previous phase 1 trial evaluating inhaled rhIL-15 in dogs with metastatic tumors of bone or melanoma, we expected to observe an improved ORR to inhaled rhIL-15 with the addition of doxorubicin. However, preconditioning doxorubicin resulted in a similar ORR (10%) and CBR (30%) compared to inhaled rhIL-15 treatment alone (11% and 39%, respectively) [ 8 As observed in our previous trials, no allergic reaction or anaphylaxis was seen, and no pulmonary-related AEs were attributed to inhaled rhIL-15 [ 8 18 19 8 Next, we evaluated the changes in the immune cell type population following doxorubicin. Hematological parameters have been demonstrated to correlate with response to therapy in canine cancer patients [ 20 21 8 22 In addition to hematological changes, we evaluated the differential gene expression and immune cell type population changes following doxorubicin and inhaled rhIL-15 therapy. NanoString transcriptomic analysis of patient PBMCs revealed no differences in the proportion of CD8 + T cell, Th1 cell, NK cell, or cytotoxic cell population levels following doxorubicin treatment on Day 7. Specifically, CBC results confirmed the overall lymphocyte count decreased following doxorubicin, but transcriptomic analysis demonstrated no selective decrease of any specific T-lymphocyte subset. A limitation of the NanoString platform is we could not directly evaluate differences in the population frequencies of T-regulatory cells. A previous study, however, has demonstrated doxorubicin induces T cell lymphodepletion without selectivity for T-regulatory cells [ 22 23 24 25 Lastly, we anticipated that inhaled rhIL-15 immunotherapy would increase the proportion of cytotoxic cells, including CD8 + T and NK cells. However, NanoString transcriptomic analysis of all patient PBMCs revealed that there were no differences in the proportion of CD8 + T cell, Th1 cell, NK cell, or cytotoxic cell population levels following inhaled rhIL-15 immunotherapy on either Day 7 or Day 21, compared to Day 0. We previously demonstrated low systemic exposure in dogs treated with inhaled rhIL-15. Therefore, it is not surprising that inhaled rhIL-15 may result in minimal systemic changes in PBMC populations [ 8 26 27 8 Several limitations of this study should be noted. First, rhIL-15 was used, rather than recombinant canine IL-15. While we did not observe any allergic or anaphylactic reactions to human IL-15, it is likely to result in the production of neutralizing antibodies, which may further limit the efficacy of this treatment. Consistent with our previous studies using inhaled human IL-15 in dogs [ 8 18 8 8 Despite these limitations, three patients exhibited clinical benefit, supporting further research into optimizing inhaled rhIL-15 immunotherapy. However, other factors may have influenced these responses. Tumor type could have played a role in response to therapy. One of the dogs with SD had a primary tumor identified as MLB, a slow-progressing bone cancer. This characteristic may explain this patient’s slow progression of pulmonary nodules [ 28 29 30 31 32 The dog that achieved a CR was initially classified as having unconfirmed PD due to new lesions identified on Day 35 thoracic radiographs. At that time, the owners elected to withdraw the dog from the study to pursue palliative radiation for the primary tumor located on the lower right mandible. We hypothesized that the new radiographic lesions observed after the completion of inhaled rhIL-15 therapy at Day 35 represented pseudoprogression (PP), emphasizing the importance of keeping PP in the differential diagnosis following immunotherapy treatment [ 33 34 35 36 37 Conclusion Preconditioning with doxorubicin did not improve the clinical response to inhaled rhIL-15 immunotherapy in dogs with metastatic tumors of bone or melanoma. Three out of ten dogs experienced clinical benefit. While doxorubicin induced indiscriminate lymphodepletion, it did not alter the response rate or toxicity profile of inhaled rhIL-15. These findings confirm that durable responses occur in a subset of dogs with advanced metastatic disease and support continued investigation into optimizing inhaled rhIL-15 immunotherapy for canine patients with metastatic sarcoma or melanoma.
