Inflammation helps the immune system identify and eliminate disease-causing and foreign stimuli and initiate the healing process. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been often used in treating inflammation. Synthetic drugs have been associated with severe effects, necessitating the need for alternative medicinal agents. Herbal remedies have comparatively fewer side effects, are widely available, and are arguably affordable, which makes them more attractive therapeutic agents.

Introduction The term “inflammation” (phlogosis) is defined as the body's immunological reaction to tissue damage caused by exposure to infections, radiation, and noxious chemicals, as well as trauma. It is characterized by pathophysiological responses such as accumulation of blood cells and plasmatic fluid in the site of injury and helps the body's immune system to identify and fight pathogens and facilitate the healing process [ 1 2 Globally, the leading causes of significant mortality are chronic inflammatory diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes chronic illnesses as a public health concern. Over 50% of all deaths worldwide are attributable to chronic inflammatory diseases, including neurodegenerative ailments, chronic kidney disease, autoimmune disorders, stroke, liver disease, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and ischemic heart disease [ 3 Although inflammation is important to the well-being of the body, it subjects individuals to discomfort and distress. Essential inflammation may be irritating to healthy tissues, whereas excessive inflammatory reaction presents deleterious effects on an individual [ 4 3 5 6 The WHO estimates that 80 percent of people in underdeveloped nations treat illnesses and disorders using medicinal plants [ 3 7 8 Recently, botanical-based products (nutritional, agricultural, and medicinal) have increased commercial significance in a myriad of pharmaceutical, agro-based, and nutraceutical industries [ 9 The demand for herbal medicines has risen as a result of consumers realizing that natural products have fewer adverse effects, are accessible, and are more affordable [ 10 11 12 Herbal formulations or natural products are crucial sources in the development of novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics. Under stressful conditions, medicinal plants often synthesize secondary metabolites. These metabolites possess various pharmacological effects against various diseases and disorders, including inflammation [ 13 13 14 Currently, studies are being carried out to establish whether traditional use of medicinal plants is supported by empirical scientific evidence. Ficus sycomorus F. sycomorus 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Medicinal Plant Sample Collection Based on ethnobotanical knowledge obtained from a local traditional herbalist in Embu County, Kenya, fresh leaves of F. sycomorus 2.2. Preparation of Plant Materials The medicinal samples underwent a thorough sorting, cleaning, cutting into small pieces, and 2 weeks of shade drying. The dried plant materials were ground using an electric mill and stored in paper bags ready for extraction. 2.3.

Experimental Animals Swiss albino mice, Mus musculus ad libitum 2.4.2. Induction of Inflammation Inflammation was induced in mice through injection of carrageenan (0.1 mL, 1% commercial grade type 1) solution into left hind paw subplantar tissue. Inflammation was confirmed by measuring paw diameter before and after induction using digital vernier calipers. 2.5. Study and Experimental Design This investigation used a completely random controlled experimental study design. An experimental design was derived from the study design. Randomly, mice were assigned to 6 groups ( n F. sycomorus 16 Table 1 The paw diameter was measured 30 min before injecting carrageenan and then in the 1st, 2 nd rd th 16 (2) Percentage Inhibition = V c − V t V t × 100 , V c V t 2.6. Phytochemical Screening 2.6.1. Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) One gram of DCM leaf and stem bark extract of F. sycomorus The plant extracts were analyzed using the following parameters using an Agilent Gas Chromatograph (7683 Agilent Technology, Inc., Beijing, China) connected to a 5975c inert XL EI/CI Mass Spectrometer in full scan mode gas chromatography. Column HP_5MS is a low-bleed capillary with a 0.25 mm diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness, and 30 m length that contains 5% phenyl methyl siloxane. Before analyzing the extracts, the temperature of the oven, the flow rate of helium, and the electron gun of the gas chromatography and mass spectrometry were programmed. An electron ionization apparatus with an ionization energy of 70 eV was used during analysis. At a steady flow rate of 7.2 mL per minute, helium (99.99%) was utilized as the carrier gas. The injector and mass transfer line temperatures were adjusted to 250°C and 200°C, respectively. The oven was programmed to operate at 50°C/minute for 50 min, reaching 285°C in 9 min, with a 50 min run time. The oven's original operating temperature was 35°C for five minutes, followed by a 10-degree Celsius rise every minute to 280°C for 10 minutes. The mass spectrometry was operated with the following parameters: 250°C for the interface temperature, 1666 µsec for scan speed, 40–550 M/Z for scan range, 70 eV for ionization energy, and 50–70 min for total retention period. The concentration of each component in the sample was calculated using the beta-sitosterol linear equation y x 2.6.2. Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC–MS) Samples (1 g) were each dissolved in 1 mL (90:10 MeOH, deionized distilled H 2 Two solvents, water and MeOH, each acidified with formic acid (0.01%), formed the mobile phase. The gradient system that was utilized was 0–2 min, 5% B; 2–4 min, 40% B; 4–7 min, 40% B; 7–8.5 min, 60% B; 8.5–10 min, 60% B; 10–15 min, 80% B; 15–19 min, 80% B; 19–20.5 min, 100% B; 20.5–23 min, 100% B; 23–24 min, 95% B; and 24–26 min, 95% B. The autosampler tray was cooled to 5°C. The ultra-performance liquid chromatography was interfaced with an electrospray ionization (ESI) in positive ionization mode. The settings that were used were the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range of 40–2,000, the sampling cone voltage of 30 V, the capillary voltage of 0.5 kV, the source temperature of 150°C, and the desolvation temperature of 120°C. The flow rate for nitrogen desolvation was 800 L/h. MassLynx Version 4.1 SCN 712 software was utilized to collect the data. Adducts, common segments, literature, online databases (METLIN, ChemSpider), and, when accessible, co-injections to validate with genuine samples were used to generate molecular ion peaks. After the mass spectra for each peak were generated, possible phytochemicals were established. The linear equation of the oleic acid standard ( y x 2.7. Statistical Data Analysis The data were cleaned and then organized for analysis utilizing Minitab statistical software Version 21.0. Means ± SEM (standard error of the mean) were computed to generate descriptive statistics. To ascertain the statistical variations between the various test groups, the inferential statistic one-factorial ANOVA (analysis of variance) was employed. In case of statistical variations, pairwise mean comparisons were performed using Tukey's multiple comparisons. An independent/unpaired t p 3. Results 3.1.

Discussion Inflammation causes suffering and minimizes victims' productivity [ 17 18 19 20 7 F. sycomorus F. sycomorus In the current study, the F. sycomorus 3 21 22 The findings of the current investigation corroborate with that of Alemu et al. [ 23 Leonotis ocymifolia 24 Verbascum sinaiticum 25 Senna didymobotrya Eucalyptus globulus 26 Acacia mellifera The most widely used standard model for acute inflammatory research to assess the anti-edematous effects of medicinal plants is carrageenan-induced paw inflammation [ 27 st 28 27 29 28 30 In this study, the changes in paw edema thickness were utilized to establish the anti-edema potential of the extracts. Carrageenan caused an increased paw edema 1 h after the injection, and then the edema subsided after 4 h. The DCM stem bark extract produces a dose-dependent response in the 1 st rd th 26 rd th 25 In the current study, diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was chosen as the reference drug. Diclofenac exerts an anti-edema effect by blocking COX-2 activity. This inhibits the synthesis of PGE2, one of the essential components of inflammatory mediators [ 31 The MeOH and DCM extracts usually extract a higher proportion of polar and nonpolar compounds, respectively [ 21 22 32 33 The LC–MS analysis of the extracts revealed various secondary plant metabolites that possess anti-inflammatory effects. These secondary metabolites included terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic acids, and phytosterols [ 34 35 36 6 3 6 37 36 38 Several mechanisms are involved in the production of anti-inflammatory effects by flavonoids, including enhanced immune mechanisms and ROS scavenging, inhibition of lipoxygenase activity, suppression of leukotriene synthesis, inhibition of synthesis of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and suppression of activities of COX-2 and PGE2 [ 36 37 37 39 3 37 The flavonoids that were identified in this study included catechin, genistein, rutin, luteolin, biochanin, eriodictyol, quercetin, and kaempferol. Catechins (flavanols) exert their anti-edema effect by regulating the deactivation of inflammation signaling pathways such as MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways [ 40 41 42 43 The strong anti-edema actions of luteolin (flavone) are achieved by inhibiting NF-κB and STAT3 (signal transducer and the activator of transcription-3) signaling pathways [ 44 45 46 47 48 49 The phenolic acids were also identified in this study. Phenolic acids are polyphenols that have methoxyl groups, one or more hydroxyl groups, and a carboxylic acid group [ 50 50 51 52 Using LC–MS analysis, phenolic acids, including p-coumaric, ferulic, vanillic, and chlorogenic acids, were found in the four extracts. Chlorogenic acid exerts its anti-edema effects by suppressing levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, PGE2, and NF‐κB [ 53 54 55 p 56 57 58 The LC–MS analysis also identified phytosterols. The steroid skeleton that makes up phytosterols is defined by a saturated bond between C-5 and C-6 sterol moieties. Numerous studies have documented the impressive pharmacological properties of phytosterols, which include antioxidant, chemopreventive, anti-edema, antidiabetic, and antiatherosclerotic activities [ 59 60 61 Fatty acids were also identified using LC–MS analysis. Carboxylic acids that have lengthy aliphatic chains and can be either unsaturated or saturated are known as fatty acids. They are characterized by a methyl group (−CH3) and a carboxyl group (−COOH) [ 62 63 The GC–MS analysis also detected compounds that have been associated with anti-inflammatory effects, including terpenoids, terpenes, alkaloids, fatty acids, vitamins, phytosterol, and fatty acid methyl ester. Terpenoids are a modified class of terpenes that have distinct functional groups and methyl groups that have undergone oxidation at various positions. Terpenoids are hydrocarbons containing oxygen [ 64 65 The terpenes that were identified in this study included p-cymene (monoterpene), benzene, 2,4-dimethyl-1-(1-methylethyl)- (monoterpene), pseudo phytol < 6E, 10Z -> (diterpene), and olean-18-en-28-oic acid, 3-oxo-, methyl ester (triterpene), while terpenoids included phytol acetate < E -> (diterpenoid), cyperotundone (sesquiterpenoids), and zierone (sesquiterpenoid). Numerous studies have demonstrated that naturally occurring terpenoids and their derivatives have anti-inflammatory properties. Terpenes and terpenoids have been found to downregulate the levels of TNF-α [ 66 Alkaloids were also detected using the GC–MS analysis. Alkaloids are naturally occurring organic compounds with nitrogen atoms [ 67 68 69 Fatty acids were also detected using GC–MS analysis. They included methyl p-tert-butyl phenyl acetate and isopropyl hexadecanoate. Fatty acids are documented to possess an anti-edema effect [ 70 3 71 Vitamins were also detected using GC–MS analysis in this study. Vitamins exert their anti-edema effects through the scavenging of ROS [ 72 According to this investigation, at the higher dosage of 200 mg/kg bw, the MeOH stem bark extract exhibited superior activity in comparison to the other three extracts. In general, it was evident that the MeOH extracts were more effective as compared with the DCM extracts. The better anti-edema effect of MeOH stem bark extract could be attributed to the polar phytocompounds. It is also possible that phytocompounds that had better anti-inflammatory effects were highly concentrated in the stem bark. 5.
