COPD makes it harder to breathe and can lead to serious lung problems after surgery. Doctors often use breathing tests before surgery to predict these complications, but these tests are not always accurate. In our study, we focused on a different kind of test called the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). This test measures how much oxygen a patient can use during exercise, known as peak oxygen uptake (VO 2 2 2 2 2 Keywords Postoperative complications Lung cancer Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Cardiopulmonary exercise test Pulmonary function This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (21K11325). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf no pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes accessibilitySummary WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility-pdf-ua-compliance yes Introduction In recent years, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), which is less invasive than conventional open thoracic surgery, has become popular for lung cancer resection. VATS is less invasive to the chest wall and reportedly offers advantages such as reduced postoperative pain and shorter hospital stay [ 1 2 Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPC), such as pneumonia and atelectasis, are associated with increased mortality and length of hospital stay [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Although VATS may reduce the incidence of PPC in pneumonectomy compared to that in open thoracotomy [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 14 15 16 If both the predicted postoperative % diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (PPO-%DLCO) and the predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume % in 1 s (PPO-%FEV 1 17 2 18 20 2 15 In contrast, a report on peak VO 2 2 21 2 2 2 Methods This single-center, retrospective cohort study included lung cancer patients with COPD who underwent preoperative CPET at the Department of Respiratory Surgery, Kindai University Hospital, between January 2017 and March 2024. The diagnosis and classification of COPD were established according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines [ 22 1 1 VATS was defined as a thoracoscopic procedure with an incision length of 8 cm or less. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients who underwent reoperation in the postoperative period, (2) patients who underwent a procedure other than lobectomy, (3) patients with complications that would affect the performance of CPET, and (4) patients who were deemed inappropriate by the principal investigator to participate in the study. Postoperative complications, such as pneumonia and atelectasis, were defined as PPC, and patients with Clavien-Dindo grade II or higher were followed up for 30 days after surgery [ 23 Investigation and Evaluation All participants underwent CPET using a bicycle ergometer according to the ramp 10 W protocol (10 W/min -1 2 2 The extent of emphysema was assessed using computed tomography (CT) scans of 1.0-mm slices obtained within 1 month of lung cancer resection, and the lung percentage of low attenuation area (LAA%) was measured using a Synapse Vincent volume analyzer (Fujifilm Medical, Tokyo, Japan). The software automatically quantified the LAA% in the bilateral lung areas using a threshold of less than −950 Hounsfield units (HU) to distinguish emphysema from other tissues. The LAA% was calculated by subtracting the relevant emphysema volume from the total lung volume and applying the lower threshold of −950 HU to the total lung percentage. PPC was evaluated using chest radiography, chest CT, and Clavien-Dindo grade for the presence of pneumonia and atelectasis within the first 30 days after surgery. PPO-%FEV 1 24 PPO − % FEV 1 PPO − % DLCO = preoperative % FEV 1 preoperative % DLCO × number of remaining lung areas / total lung areas . The number of lung areas was calculated to be 18 (right upper lobe, 3; right middle lobe, 2; right lower lobe, 5; left upper lobe, 4; and left lower lobe, 4). Statistical Analysis Patients were divided into those with and without PPC (PPC and non-PPC groups, respectively). Continuous variables were compared using an unpaired t t 2 ® p Results Between January 2017 and March 2024, a total of 1,347 patients underwent lobectomy, of whom 564 had COPD and 44 underwent preoperative CPET. Four patients were excluded, as they could not perform accurate CPET measurements (depression, previous stroke, arteriosclerosis obliterans, or home oxygen therapy). Overall, 40 patients were eligible for analysis ( Fig. 1 Table 1 Fig. 1. Flowchart depicting patient selection process. Between January 2017 and March 2024, 1,347 patients underwent lobectomy, of whom 564 had COPD and 44 underwent preoperative CPET.

First, this was a single-center study with a small sample size, and the comorbidities included not only COPD but also orthopedic, cardiac, and cardiovascular diseases. However, these comorbidities may not have affected the CPET results, given the inclusion and exclusion criteria for CPET and the performance status of the population being maintained within 0–1, making the present results relatively reliable. Second, nutritional status may also be related to PPC; however, the characteristics of this population did not include an index of nutritional status. Nevertheless, as no cases of sarcopenia were observed in the study population, the influence of nutritional status was considered low. Third, compared with pulmonary function tests, peak VO 2 2 In conclusion, the findings highlight the limitations of traditional pulmonary function tests in this context and underscore the value of CPET in providing a more accurate risk assessment. Incorporating CPET into preoperative evaluations can enhance risk stratification and guide perioperative management strategies, thereby potentially reducing the incidence of PPC in this high-risk population. Future research should focus on larger, multicenter studies to validate these findings and explore the integration of CPET with other predictive tools to further refine risk assessment protocols for lung cancer surgery patients with COPD.
