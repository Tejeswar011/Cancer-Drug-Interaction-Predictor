Isolated tricuspid valve regurgitation has been shown to be associated to a significant mortality. 1 Surgery for tricuspid valve disease has been taking place at least since the decade of 1960. 2 3 3 4 5 Importantly, tricuspid valve surgery has not been studied in adequately powered clinical trials. Accordingly, only observational data exist concerning this type of surgery. Tricuspid valve surgery has not been shown in meta-analysis data to surpass medical treatment, in what concerns 1-year and 2-year mortality rates. 3 Kawsara et al 6 In the series of patients described by Wang et al 7 In what concerns the report by Dreyfus et al 8 The willingness to accept a mortality risk in the surgical context is probably different if different types of surgery are considered. The problem has been studied in the case of weight loss surgery, and the mean acceptable mortality risk to undergo this type of surgery was 6.7%, but the median risk was only 0.1%. 9 10 11 In summary, surgery for isolated tricuspid valve regurgitation has a relatively high in-hospital mortality rate, has not been adequately validated by clinical trials, and may not surpass medical therapy. This type of surgery should be avoided in most cases, pending further information on this issue. It is conceivable that selected cases certainly exist in which surgery could be justified, but the general rule should be avoidance. More recently, transcatheter interventions have been developed, involving edge-to-edge repair, valve replacement, or other methods. Unlike what happens with surgery, some of these techniques have been studied in controlled clinical trials, which is the current adequate way to validate a medical intervention. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients, 12 In another clinical trial, in this case studying transcatheter valve replacement versus medical therapy in 400 patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation, an improvement in symptoms and in quality of life was noted in the active intervention group. 13 In yet another study involving 300 patients (edge-to edge repair versus control), similar findings were observed, with better results for tricuspid regurgitation and in quality of life for the transcatheter group of patients. 14 In a further study with transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement, in 126 patients, 1-year mortality was 10.3%. 15 16 Favorable effects of transcatheter intervention on overall mortality or on hospitalization were not documented by any of the controlled studies, and disturbing data were noted in what concerns major bleeding and new pacemaker or cardiac implantable electronic device, especially in the valve replacement patients. One-year mortality for the three studies comparing percutaneous intervention to medical therapy alone, 12 14 1 Figure 1.

CI, confidence interval. For references, see main text ( 12 14 In the meta-analysis by Suc et al, the in-hospital mortality for percutaneous intervention was 1%, 1-year mortality was 18%, and 2-year mortality was 22%. These latter values, however, did not differ from the medically treated patients. 3 17 Data from clinical trials failed to confirm previous registry data showing better survival in patients treated by transcatheter tricuspid valve interventions. 18 19 The rather disappointing results concerning different types of interventions on overall prognosis may be associated to the not unfrequent changes in the pulmonary circulation of the patients in this setting. In some cases, tricuspid valve regurgitation may be an effect, rather than a cause, of the clinical situation. For instance, in the study by Wang et al, 20 An intriguing role for atrial fibrillation (AF) in this context has been highlighted. Although tricuspid regurgitation could cause AF by means of functional and structural changes in the right atrium, it is the opposite situation of AF leading to tricuspid regurgitation that has received more attention. 21 23 22 23 24 24 25 26 In fact, in the three controlled clinical trials presented above involving percutaneous intervention, 12 14 1 1 Table 1 Number of patients with atrial fibrillation in three trials studying tricuspid valve percutaneous interventions.

For references see text ( 12 14 AF, atrial fibrillation. Chronic pulmonary disease was also seen in more than 10% of patients in some of the reports previously mentioned 7 8 12 13 This is a rapidly evolving field, as new techniques are developed and new results are published, and present day conclusions may be surpassed at any moment by new scientific findings. For the moment, we can conclude that surgical treatment of isolated tricuspid valve regurgitation should be avoided as a routine procedure. We can also conclude that transcatheter intervention, although unable to change overall prognosis, can be reasonably considered in patients with significant symptoms. Since tricuspid valve intervention, namely, transcatheter intervention, seems to be unable to prolong life but seems to be able to increase quality of life, in the setting of a disease with a significant mortality rate, it can be labelled as a kind of cardiac palliative care, for the time being. Although palliative care, in patients with cancer as in other diseases, has been mostly centered on drug interventions, the experience with tricuspid valve transcatheter interventions may add to the list of cardiac invasive interventions with palliative intent, which currently includes balloon aortic valvuloplasty. 27 The treatment of atrial fibrillation, including anticoagulation, is firmly based on clinical trial data. Although the role for rhythm control and for rate control are still a matter of debate, data from AF-associated tricuspid regurgitation may contribute to this discussion. Despite the fact that patients with isolated tricuspid regurgitation and AF may differ from patients with AF enrolled in most AF trials, it is reasonable, for the moment, to treat these patients under the current state of the art for AF, pending further information on the subject. Further research is needed to clarify the best approach for isolated tricuspid valve regurgitation, especially concerning the role and timing of valve interventions and interventions on AF.
