GDN showed no obvious cytotoxic effects in cultured chondrocytes, synoviocytes and bone marrow MSCs. GDN effectively entered into chondrocytes and promoted proliferation in TBHP-induced chondrocytes. GDN inhibited oxidative stress and inflammatory response in TBHP-induced chondrocytes. GDN alleviated OA-related pain and cartilage degeneration in posttraumatic OA rats. GDN effectively promoted matrix anabolism and inhibited catabolism in ex vivo GDN inhibited oxidative stress and promoted chondrocyte proliferation in vitro in vivo These findings reveal GDN could be a promising therapeutic strategy for OA patients.
