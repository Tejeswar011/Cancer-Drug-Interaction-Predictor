The tumor microenvironment (TME) of HCC is characterized by several different fibroblastic and immune cell types, all of which affect the initiation, progression and metastasis of this malignant cancer. This complex immune TME can be divided into an innate component that includes macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, mucosal-associated invariant T cells, natural killer cells, natural killer T cells, and innate lymphoid cells, as well as an adaptive component that includes CD4 + + Keywords Hepatocellular carcinoma Immune microenvironment Immunotherapy.

We propose here to summarize the latest findings in the field of liver cancer research and its microenvironment, including the immune cells involved in the initiation and progression steps of HCC. We also summarize novel tools and therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling the associated immune response responsible for HCC pathogenesis. Characterization of the HCC microenvironment Involvement of fibroblastic cells in promoting HCC development Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) HSCs are among the primary instigators of precancerous fibrosis through the production of various extracellular matrix (ECM) components following their transdifferentiation into α-smooth muscle actin-expressing myofibroblasts [ 24 26 27 28 29 HSCs are known to be activated through various different mechanisms and pathways after liver injury, ranging from cytokines and chemokines to oxidative stress and autophagy [ 25 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 Filliol et al. reported that nonactivated quiescent HSCs and cytokine-producing HSCs play a protective role in the context of HCC, as opposed to their activated myofibroblastic and tumor-promoting forms, further suggesting that HSC activation plays a considerable role in HCC formation and proliferation [ 39 40 41 42 43 4 44 45 46 45 47 48 49 50 4 51 Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) In addition to being the main source of myofibroblasts, quiescent HSCs are also the origin of ~85% of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in HCC-ME [ 52 53 27 54 55 + 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 Impact of the gut‒liver axis on HCC development The liver is anatomically and functionally linked to the gut through the portal circulation, rendering it continuously exposed to gut-derived microbial components. Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier—often described as a “leaky gut”—facilitates the translocation of bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), bacterial DNA, and metabolites into the liver. This microbial translocation activates hepatic immune cells through pattern recognition receptors such as TLRs, triggering chronic inflammation and contributing to fibrosis, a key step in hepatocarcinogenesis. The interplay between microbial signals and hepatic immune responses represents a critical component in the pathogenesis of HCC, particularly in the context of chronic liver injury and metabolic liver diseases [ 9 64 66 Akkermansia muciniphila A. muciniphila + A. muciniphila 67 Emerging evidence has shown that alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota—often referred to as dysbiosis—are associated with the progression of chronic liver disease and the development of HCC. In particular, a study demonstrated that a high-fat/high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet induces distinct microbial dysbiosis associated with altered production of ROS and microbial metabolites, including increased taurocholic acid (TCA) and reduced levels of 3-indolepropionic acid (IPA), which promotes the transition from MASLD to HCC [ 68 69 4 70 Bifidobacterium pseudolongum 71 + 72 Ruminococcaceae Porphyromonadaceae Bacteroidetes 73 Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron + 74 75 Recent studies have begun to link the gut microbiota composition with the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with HCC, suggesting that certain microbial profiles may predict therapeutic outcomes [ 76 77 Bacteroides fragilis 78 79 Bacteroides Veillonella + regs + 80 Lachnoclostridium Prevotella 9 81 Senegalimassilia anaerobia 82 Faecalibacterium 83 Bacteroides ovatus 84 regs + 85 86 Impact of innate immune cells on HCC development The liver is enriched with a unique population of resident immune cells that play a central role in maintaining immune homeostasis and orchestrating responses to hepatic injury and malignancy. In the context of HCC, this immunological niche becomes significantly altered, with resident immune cells contributing to both tumor-promoting inflammation and antitumor surveillance. Key players such as resident myeloid cells (such as Kupffer cells (KCs) and dendritic cells), liver-resident NK cells, and tissue-resident T cells adapt to the TME, as do resident ILC3s, where their phenotypic and functional plasticity profoundly influences HCC progression and immune evasion (Figs. 1 2 Fig. 1 Impact of myeloid cell-mediated immunosuppression and cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion within the hepatocellular carcinoma immune microenvironment. One of the prominent members of the immune TME is myeloid cells, which mainly consist of TAMs derived from resident KCs or infiltrating MNMs through the action of various novel molecules and cytokines. TAMs secrete a wide variety of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, that are involved in the initiation and progression of HCC. TAMs also act on all steps of HCC growth via various newly discovered mediators and molecules. TANs constitute another major type of myeloid cell that is commonly observed in the HCC TME and is differentiated from neutrophils through various chemokines. TANs also produce proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and secrete NETs that favor HCC growth. In addition to TAMs and TANs, macrophages and neutrophils can also differentiate into M-MDSCs and PMN-MDSCs, respectively, which also play tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive roles within the TME. Owing to their inherent cytotoxic and antitumor role, CTLs are prone to inhibition and exhaustion mediated by the surrounding TME through various complex and heterogeneous mechanisms, ranging from extracellular molecules to interactions with other immune cell types.

PMN-MDSCs and T regs H Macrophages Macrophages are generally found in two forms in the liver: infiltrated monocyte-derived macrophages and liver-resident macrophages named KCs, with the latter representing approximately one-third of nonparenchymal cells in the human liver [ 87 89 90 91 92 low low high 92 The most studied impact of macrophages on the progression of HCC is their role in immune evasion/escape, notably through their malicious use of ICIs such as the PD-L1/PD-1 axis to induce immunosuppression, mainly toward CD8 + + 93 + 94 95 regs 96 + 97 98 98 + 99 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 69 106 107 108 + 109 + 110 111 + 112 113 31 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 The IL-1 family of cytokines contains 11 members, including the highly inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-1α. For example, macrophages are known inducers of IL-1β production and secretion. Gao et al. demonstrated that blocking autophagy resulted in the release of IL-1β through the inflammasome complex inside macrophages to contribute to HCC progression [ 122 high regs 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 Dendritic cells (DCs) Conventional DCs (cDCs = myeloid DCs = mDCs) are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that bridge innate and adaptive immunity by initiating T-cell responses through the presentation of antigens and costimulatory signals. cDCs can be subdivided into cDC1s and cDC2s according to their phenotypic traits, with cDC1s stimulating CD8 + + 130 131 + + 132 133 regs + 134 135 SLC7A11 136 + + 137 + 138 lo regs 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 Neutrophils Neutrophils are the first responders of the innate immune system, known for combating infections and tissue damage, which is facilitated by their main effector functions of degranulation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, they, especially tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), have been correlated with HCC for many decades [ 150 151 152 153 154 151 155 In the scientific literature, neutrophils have been shown to be involved in each step of HCC, ranging from hepatocarcinogenesis to metastasis, through direct and/or indirect actions in HCC-ME. For example, Teo et al. reported that a specific subset of TANs can promote tumor stemness, assist in immune escape and even promote metastasis in MASH-HCC [ 156 157 158 159 160 161 + regs 162 32 regs 163 164 + 165 166 167 168 CXCR2 is a chemokine receptor found (but not limited to) in neutrophils that is commonly understood to aid in the recruitment of TANs into the HCC-ME. As a CXCR2 ligand, CXCL1 was found to be upregulated within HCC cells in response to acetyl-CoA accumulation and consequently led to TAN recruitment, favoring tumor growth/metastasis [ 169 170 + 171 172 + 173 + 174 175 Many studies have also demonstrated the relationship between neutrophils and anti-PD-1 therapies. For example, tumor cells can induce a specific subset of neutrophils (CD10 + + + 176 177 178 + regs 179 180 Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) MDSCs are a heterogeneous group of immature myeloid immune cells that have immunosuppressive functions in the context of many cancers and can be broadly categorized into monocytic (M)-MDSCs and polymorphonuclear/granulocytic (PMN)-MDSCs on the basis of their phenotypic and functional properties. They were first described as T-cell [ 181 182 + + + -/low + + + + + + 183 184 188 189 191 MDSCs regulate HCC development by exerting their immunosuppressive function through many different mechanisms depending on their subset, since M-MDSCs harbor macrophage-like and PMN-MDSCs harbor neutrophil-like immunomodulatory functions in HCC. For example, PMN-MDSCs suppress T-cell proliferation/function by secreting arginase-1 (ARG1) to reduce the level of L 192 193 194 195 Taken together, the use of various biomarkers, inducers and effectors of MDSCs as therapeutic targets via monoclonal antibodies/antagonists is a promising research field in the treatment of HCC. For example, CCL1 + 196 197 6 198 199 200 201 202 Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells MAIT cells are a subset of innate-like T cells found in several mucosal sites and organs that display both innate and adaptive traits, mostly due to the presence of a semi-invariant T-cell receptor (TCR) that is coupled with a TCR β-chain that recognizes riboflavin metabolites (e.g., 6-formylpterin) that are not produced in homeostatic human metabolism [ 203 204 205 206 207 The literature has focused on the protective or malignant properties of MAIT cells in HCC because of their highly heterogeneous nature [ 208 209 210 + 99 regs 211 212 regs 213 214 Natural killer (NK) cells NK cells are group 1 ILC3s that play key roles in antiviral and antitumor immune responses through an effector cytotoxic phenotype. This cytotoxicity is not limited by the presentation of non-self-antigens through MHC-I on the surface of infected/cancer cells, which differs from that of cytotoxic CD8 + However, this normally highly efficient antitumor response might be circumvented by HCC-ME, which inhibits the infiltration of NK cells and induces a dysfunctional phenotype within the TME [ 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 TDEs are known to decrease NK cell activation and cytotoxicity in various cancer types [ 225 226 227 high 228 Generating new cutting-edge immunotherapies by using the natural cytotoxic phenotype of NK cells to our advantage and/or finding ways to overcome known pathways leading to their dysfunction is an interesting field of research. Known methods, such as CAR-NK cell therapy (similar to CAR-T-cell immunotherapies), are used alone or in combination with other forms of antitumor therapies [ 229 230 231 232 233 138 234 235 + 236 237 238 239 240 241 Natural killer T (NKT) cells NKT cells are a subset of innate-like T lymphocytes that are restricted to the recognition of CD1d on the surface of APCs and express both NK-like and T-like molecules that distinguish them from these two distinct cells. Under normal functional conditions, NKT cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α. Logically, these cells play a widely understood role in antitumor immunity, similar to NK cells and T cells, and the presence of exhausted NKT cells is similarly observed in the TME of several cancer types [ 242 243 244 245 246 Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) ILCs are tissue-resident immune cells that can generally be divided into three subpopulations, namely, type-1 ILCs (ILC1s), ILC2s, and ILC3s, which are found mainly in mucosal tissues to aid in the innate immune response toward microbes and cancer. ILC1s are thought to functionally mirror Th1 cells, ILC2s mirror Th2 cells, and ILC3s mirror Th17 cells [ 65 + 247 173 227 248 70 Influence of adaptive immune cells on HCC development CD4 + The hepatoprotective role of CD4 + 249 + 250 H H + 251 H + H H regs H + + + H H 252 244 The IL-17 family is a proinflammatory cytokine family, with IL-17A being the most abundant member that signals through its ubiquitously expressed heterodimeric receptor IL-17RA/IL-17RC and is produced mainly by Th17 cells but also includes γδ T cells, Tc17 cells (CD8+IL-17 + 253 H 254 255 256 H H H 257 258 259 IL-17 is known to increase the expression of profibrotic genes such as TGF-β1, indicating its potential contribution to the induction of cirrhosis and, consequently, HCC. Circulatory IL-17 levels are notably useful in predicting HCC in its earlier stages in human patients with cirrhosis. For example, the deletion of IL-17 signaling results in the attenuation of fibrosis by decreasing inflammatory cytokine and STAT3-mediated collagen production, whereas the deletion of IL-22 signaling results in the exacerbation of fibrosis [ 260 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 -/- 268 - 269 270 257 Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play a pivotal role in driving the malignancy of liver cancer in all stages of HCC development because of their stem cell-like properties [ 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 + 279 280 281 The metastatic and angiogenic properties of IL-17 have been studied in various experimental models, such as through the discovery that CAF-secreted CXCL11 upregulates the expression of circUBAP2 within HCC cells, which counteracts the inhibitory effect of miR-4756 on IFIT1 and IFIT3 [ 125 125 282 H 283 284 + reg 285 286 CD8 + CD8 + 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 + 294 + 295 CCL5 296 297 Regulatory T cells (T regs T regs + regs + regs reg eff regs 298 SOX12 can induce the recruitment of T regs 299 regs + 162 regs 96 reg 300 reg 301 B cells B cells are lymphocytes that are activated through BCR-mediated antigen recognition and costimulatory signal reception to become antibody-producing plasma cells, the central players of adaptive humoral immunity.

In recent years, many scientific breakthroughs have been made in the field of cutting-edge technology discoveries to study the TME, especially those that are able to study multiple biomarkers simultaneously and are enhanced with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) [Table 1 307 308 Table 1 Overview of current cutting-edge techniques in HCC immune research Technique Methodology Applications References Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) Consecutive IF staining of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections • Extracellular or subcellular location of HCC markers • Biomarker changes in different etiology-derived HCC [ 112 308 315 Flow cytometry (FC) Fluorescent labeling of cell-surface antigens subjected to laser excitation • Transmembrane receptor analysis • HCC immune cell sorting • Immunophenotyping • Identification of novel HCC immune subsets [ 119 299 316 317 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) cDNA library is prepared from isolated single cells for high-throughput sequencing • Immune profiling • Immunophenotyping • Identification of novel HCC immune subsets [ 318 320 Multiomics (spatial proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics) Integrates protein, gene expression, and metabolite profiling with spatial resolution. • Spatial distribution of immune cells • Immune-evasive niche identification • Linkage of metabolic rewiring with HCC progression.

With the use of known markers of different immune cell types already used in standard immunohistochemistry (IHC) or immunofluorescence (IF), mIF differentiates itself by allowing the analysis of multiple markers on the same tissue sections with successive staining–stripping protocols, with up to 18–20 different markers being able to be visualized on a single section [ 309 310 311 312 313 108 112 314 315 316 Another major technique used in the characterization of the immune TME in HCC research is flow cytometry (FC), along with its modified and/or improved counterparts, such as cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF) and imaging mass spectrometry (iMS). FCs have been used for several decades to characterize the different transmembrane biomarkers of individual cells and, notably, to isolate these cells for further analysis or subset identification [ 120 300 317 318 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has paved the way for HCC research in recent years. Various techniques, such as microfluidics, can be used to isolate single cells and isolate the RNA to be reverse transcribed to cDNA, building an extensive library that can be sequenced with high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods, allowing for an improved and personalized glance into the complex heterogeneous HCC TME. Notably, scRNA-seq can be used to identify different transcriptional immune cell subsets residing in peritumoral or intratumoral HCC tissues and thus assess their respective roles in the immunopathophysiology of the TME [ 319 320 321 Spatially resolved omics technologies, including spatial proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, are transforming cancer research by enabling the localization of molecular information within the native tissue architecture. In HCC, these tools are increasingly used to dissect the spatial organization and functional states of immune cells, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying tumor progression and immune evasion. Spatial proteomics techniques such as imaging mass cytometry have enabled high-resolution profiling of the immune TME in HCC, as exemplified by a study that constructed a single-cell atlas from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of patients with MASH-HCC, HBV- or HCV-related HCC, and healthy donors [ 322 132 323 112 324 325 + 326 327 328 Finally, hepatocyte-derived organoids are currently very promising research tools for studying the structural complexity of HCC [ 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 Understanding the underlying mechanisms by which tumors escape immune surveillance is essential for improving current anticancer therapeutic strategies and patient outcomes. To this end, several experimental animal models mimicking clinical observations in patients have provided comprehensive information on how the immune microenvironment influences HCC initiation and progression [Table 2 3 Table 2 Overview of experimental animal models in HCC immune research Model Principle Advantages Disadvantages References Experimental mouse models Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs)/transgenic models Use of knock-in/knock-out models for GEMMs, and use of mutated oncogenes under liver-specific promoter for transgenic models. • Immunocompetence. • Native TME. • Limited mutational heterogeneity. • Long latency. • High-cost of breeding and caging [ 177 336 337 Chemically induced mouse models Exposure to hepatic carcinogens to induce chronic liver damage and subsequent HCC. • Immunocompetence. • Ease and cost-effective. • Tumor heterogeneity. • Interindividual variability. • Long latency.

Genetically engineered/transgenic mice: Chemically induced models: Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice: Syngeneic mice: Dietary models: Genetically engineered/transgenic murine models of HCC Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have been pivotal in mimicking the genetic and histological characteristics of human HCC, wherein oncogene or tumor-suppressor genes are activated or suppressed, respectively, to induce tumorigenesis within the native and immunocompetent hepatic microenvironments of various mouse strains. In addition to mating-related logistical shortcomings, the major disadvantage of this model is the resulting homogeneity of the tumor, since the number of genetically engineered genes within one mouse strain is limited and does not entirely reflect the heterogeneous nature of human cancer. Models such as the Alb-Cre mice used with LSL-TGFB1R and Myc-driven models allow for the investigation of specific mutations and their effects on immune cell infiltration and function within the TME [ 178 337 338 Chemically induced murine models of HCC Chemical carcinogens, such as the genotoxic compound DEN, are commonly used to induce de novo HCC in mice and provide insights into the role of the immune system in hepatocarcinogenesis. It is commonly used in addition to CCl 4 4 339 340 Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PTDXs) PDTX models, in which human HCC tissues are implanted into immunocompromised mice, enable the study of the human immune microenvironment and the tumor response to immunotherapies. This model has shown promise in evaluating the role of immune checkpoints and responses to therapies [ 329 334 341 Syngeneic mouse models Although ectopic/subcutaneous tumor injection models are widely used because of their simplicity and reproducibility, they are limited in replicating HCC-ME due to their metastatic nature. Orthotopic engraftment of syngeneic cell lines into the hepatic subcapsular space is a much more reliable method to mimic and analyze HCC-ME since it promotes an intact immune system and allows the study of immune responses to tumors. Since the injected HCC cells are syngeneic with the host murine liver, the use of immunocompromised mice, as opposed to PTDX models, is not needed. They are particularly useful for evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapies such as PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors [ 342 343 344 As multiple environmental factors are involved in and contribute to the development of chronic liver diseases associated with HCC development, several experimental animal models have been proposed to mimic the clinical observations made in patients [Fig. 3 Western diets (high-fat-cholesterol-sugars) The prevalence of MASLD and its advanced form, MASH, is drastically increasing in proportion with the rate of obesity in western and developing countries [ 9 345 162 4 346 + 347 348 68 Alcohol The correlation between alcohol consumption and the incidence of HCC has been characterized in many studies and meta-analyses for several years [ 349 350 10 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 141 High-fiber Since dietary fiber cannot be digested and absorbed by the digestive system, it is an important nutritious source for the gut microbiome; specifically, fermented low-sugar fiber-containing foods are overwhelmingly considered a healthy carbohydrate choice. Although the literature suggests that fiber generally has a hepatoprotective effect [ 358 359 360 361 362 Emerging therapeutic strategies for HCC treatment Conventional HCC treatments Many treatments for HCC are available, and the choice of their applicability depends on HCC features, underlying liver function and patient comorbidities [Fig. 4 3 363 366 Fig. 4 Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system and corresponding treatment strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This figure illustrates treatment allocation according to tumor burden, liver function (Child‒Pugh classification), and performance status (ECOG: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group). Curative approaches—including liver resection, ablation, and transplantation—are recommended for early-stage disease (BCLC 0–A). Intermediate-stage HCC (BCLC B) is typically managed with transarterial therapies; however, systemic therapy may also be considered a first-line option in selected patients with high tumor burdens or who are unsuitable for transarterial therapies. Advanced-stage disease (BCLC-C) is treated with systemic agents, including immunotherapy-based regimens such as atezolizumab–bevacizumab, durvalumab–tremelimumab, and nivolumab–ipilimumab. End-stage disease (BCLC D) is managed with best supportive care. Treatment goals vary by stage and include curative intent, disease control, downstaging, or symptom management. Notably, the integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors with locoregional therapies such as TACE is an emerging strategy under active investigation, particularly in intermediate-stage HCC, and may further refine future therapeutic algorithms Table 3 Results from positive Phase 3 clinical trials used in first-line therapy studiesres Phase 3 clinical trials IMBRAVE 150 HIMALAYA Checkmate 9DW Treatment Atezolizumab–Bevacizumab Sorafenib Durvalumab–Tremelimumab Sorafenib Nivolumab–Ipilimumab Sorafenib Overall survival (median) months 19.2 13.2 16.4 13.8 23.7 20.6 Overall survival rate at 24 months - - 40.5% 32.6% 19% 39% Overall survival rate at 36 months - - 30.7% 19.8% 38% 24% Overall survival rate at 48 months - - 25.2% 15.1% - - Disease-free survival (median) months 6.8 4.3 3.8 4.1 9.1 9.2 Objective response rate 30% 11% 20% 5% 36% 13% The recent positive results from the interim analysis of the Phase 3 IMbrave050 trial, in which patients at high risk of HCC recurrence following LR or ablation were randomized to receive atezolizumab plus bevacizumab for 12 months after curative treatment or surveillance (recurrence-free survival: 0.72, 95% CI 0.56–0.93), prompted a reconsideration of adjuvant therapies for this high-risk population [ 367 363 n n p 368 369 TACE is the first-line treatment for intermediate-stage disease, which includes unresectable multinodular lesions without vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread in patients with preserved liver function. TACE can also be used in early-stage HCC when curative treatment is not feasible or has failed and as waiting or downstaging treatment in cases of LT [ 370 371 372 373 374 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) The major change in HCC management in the last few years has been the recent positive results of immunotherapy. For a long time, TKIs were the only therapeutic option for advanced HCC. However, recent advances in clinical studies involving ICIs have profoundly transformed the management of this cancer. These treatments include anti-PD-1 agents such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab; anti-PD-L1 agents such as durvalumab and atezolizumab; and anti-CTLA-4 agents such as tremelimumab and ipilimumab. The IMbrave150 trial, a phase III study, compared the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab with sorafenib. The results revealed that atezolizumab and bevacizumab significantly improved OS (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.42–0.79; p p 375 376 p 377 p 368 NCT04039607 378 379 ICIs are generally well tolerated but can be associated with immune-mediated adverse effects, with an increased risk when two ICIs are used simultaneously. Owing to this risk, ICIs are not recommended for patients with moderate to severe autoimmune diseases, making TKIs the first-line treatment of choice for these patients [ 380 381 The potential impact of liver disease etiology on the ICI response was first suggested in subgroup analyses from the IMbrave150 trial [ 375 p p p 382 383 The use of bevacizumab in systemic treatments for advanced HCC has raised concerns due to the risk of bleeding, particularly in patients with portal hypertension (PHT) and esophageal varices (EVs), given its anti-VEGF mechanism of action. In the IMbrave150 study, the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was greater with atezolizumab+bevacizumab (2.4% for PHT-related bleeding vs. 0.6% with sorafenib) [ 375 384 385 386 384 385 387 377 Molecular approaches to predict immunotherapy efficacy in HCC patients Molecular biomarkers offer insights into the molecular landscape of HCC, and their identification and targeting represent key steps to improve HCC patient outcomes. Currently, only 30% of patients with advanced HCC respond to ICIs, highlighting the need for predictive biomarkers to guide treatment decisions. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) A high TMB is correlated with improved immune responses in certain cancers. However, in HCC, high TMB is rare (0.8%), and no clear association with ICI response has been demonstrated [ 388 Microsatellite instability (MSI) MSI/dMMR tumors are linked to increased lymphocytic infiltration and improved ICI responses in various cancers. However, the MSI incidence in HCC is very low (<3%), limiting its applicability [ 388 TP53 gene mutations Mutations in the TP53 gene are associated with specific IFN-γ gene signatures, increased infiltration of Treg Foxp3+ cells, reduced CD8+ T-cell infiltration in HCC, and increased mortality rates among 369 HCC patients. These mutations could predict a poor response to immunotherapy [ 388 Wnt/β- In 40–80% of HCCs, dysregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is associated with ICI resistance, shorter overall survival (9.1 vs. 15.2 months), and shorter progression-free survival (2.0 vs. 7.4 months) than in patients with nonmutated Wnt/β-catenin tumors. Wnt/β-catenin pathway genes may serve as predictive biomarkers for immunotherapy efficacy [ 389 390 391 IFNAP signature This 11-gene signature related to interferon‒gamma signaling and chemotaxis is correlated with anti-PD1 responses [ 392 Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) ctDNA consists of short DNA fragments released by tumor cells, providing insights into tumor mutational landscapes and acting as a liquid biopsy. In HCC, frequent somatic mutations affect pathways such as TERT (60%), TP53 (30%), CTNNB1 (20%), oxidative stress, and Akt/mTOR. Pilot studies have confirmed that ctDNA detection in HCC patients is strongly correlated with plasma and tumor mutations (e.g., TERT, TP53, and CTNNB1). The mutation burden increases with BCLC stage. Among patients treated with atezolizumab-bevacizumab, persistent ctDNA mutations or the emergence of new mutations correlated with disease progression, suggesting that ctDNA is a promising tool for evaluating systemic treatment response and detecting tumor subclonal selection [ 393 Artificial intelligence (AI) An AI model, the ABRS-P, was developed to predict progression-free survival in HCC patients treated with atezolizumab-bevacizumab via histological slides. When validated across multiple cohorts, the model demonstrated a significant association between high ABRS-P scores and improved treatment response [ 394 PD-L1 expression While PD-L1 serves as a predictive biomarker in other cancers, its utility in HCC remains controversial. Data from studies such as CHECKMATE 040, KEYNOTE 224, IMbrave150, and HIMALAYA indicate similar responses to ICIs regardless of PD-L1 expression levels [ 388 Enhancing the immunotherapy response with multimodal combinations Only ~30% of liver cancer patients currently respond to immunotherapy, underscoring the need for more effective treatment strategies. To address this, emerging approaches increasingly focus on rational combination therapies that target complementary mechanisms of resistance. Among these, triplet regimens and vaccines are generating increasing interest. The ongoing PRODIGE 81–FFCD 2101–TRIPLET-HCC trial is evaluating the combination of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, and ipilimumab, with results pending [ 395 396 397 TIGIT as a therapeutic target in HCC T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) has emerged as a promising immune checkpoint in the HCC-ME. As an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells and NK cells, TIGIT plays a crucial role in immune evasion by dampening antitumor immune responses, thereby contributing to HCC progression. Notably, a high baseline presence of intratumoral macrophages and T regs + 398 399 398 Vaccine therapy for HCC Therapeutic vaccines for HCC aim to stimulate the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells in patients with existing disease. These vaccines utilize various approaches to achieve this goal, each differing in their mechanisms and production methods. Among these, peptide vaccines have gained attention for their ability to use small protein fragments corresponding to tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), such as glypican-3 (GPC3). These peptides specifically activate T lymphocytes, enabling them to identify and destroy tumor cells with minimal off-target effects. For example, a phase I clinical trial involving GPC3-derived peptides demonstrated their capacity to elicit immune responses in HCC patients without causing severe adverse effects [ 400 + + + 401 402 DC vaccines have also emerged as a promising strategy to enhance antitumor immunity in cancer patients. DCs are key APCs that process and present tumor antigens to T cells, promoting a targeted immune response. In the development of DC vaccines, dendritic cells are extracted, loaded with TAAs or tumor lysates ex vivo, and reintroduced into patients. These modified DCs travel to the lymph nodes, where they activate tumor-specific T cells, enhancing the immune response against the tumor. Clinical trials evaluating DC vaccines have shown encouraging results. For example, a phase I trial investigated a dendritic cell vaccine primed with AFP, a protein frequently overexpressed in HCC, using COMBIG-DC (ilixadencel). When administered intratumorally, the vaccine showed positive immunogenicity and was well tolerated, as evidenced by blood marker analysis [ 403 Other innovative vaccine strategies are currently under development. DNA vaccines operate by delivering plasmid DNA encoding TAAs into host cells, thereby triggering the immune system to identify and eliminate cancer cells. Similarly, mRNA vaccines leverage messenger RNA to instruct host cells to produce tumor-associated proteins, which subsequently elicit an immune response. Early studies of mRNA vaccines targeting AFP or personalized neoantigens have demonstrated promising results, generating robust immune reactions. Tumor cell lysate vaccines represent another avenue, utilizing fragments of disintegrated tumor cells as a rich source of antigens to stimulate the immune system. When paired with DCs, these lysates significantly enhance antigen presentation and T-cell activation. Research has further revealed that lysates from HCC cells may prevent immune cell exhaustion, suggesting a novel method to sustain effective antitumor responses [ 404 CAR-based therapy for HCC The mechanism of CAR-T-cell therapy relies on engineering patient T cells to specifically target tumor cells. T cells are harvested and genetically modified in vitro to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), comprising an antigen-binding domain (scFv), a transmembrane anchor, and an intracellular signaling domain. This design enables CAR-T cells to bind tumor-specific antigens and promotes cytotoxic activity independent of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) presentation. Additionally, CAR-T cells can proliferate and form memory cells, providing sustained antitumor immunity. Recent advancements include second- and third-generation CARs with enhanced costimulatory domains (e.g., CD28 and 4-1BB) for improved persistence and activity. An optimal antigen for CAR-T-cell therapy in cancer should be highly expressed on tumor cells while demonstrating little to no expression on normal, healthy cells. In HCC, a significant focus is on antigens such as GPC3, which is expressed in more than 70% of HCC cases [ 405 408 409 410 411 412 Despite its potential, CAR-T-cell therapy faces significant obstacles in HCC. The fibrotic TME and insufficient T-cell trafficking limit therapeutic delivery. Immunosuppressive cells, such as T regs 412 413 412 In addition to T cells, innate immune cells such as NK cells are being explored for CAR-based therapies in other cancers and in HCC [ 414 229 415 416 417 418 418 419 Conclusion and future perspectives Despite significant advances, understanding the immune microenvironment in HCC remains a complex and evolving challenge. The introduction of immunotherapy has significantly modified the landscape of HCC management, improving patient outcomes; ICIs are currently recommended as first-line treatments for advanced HCC, and they are likely to become the standard of care for intermediate HCC when combined with locoregional therapy in the coming years. This shift encouraged us to adopt a more dynamic approach to patient management, continually reassessing the potential for curative treatments on the basis of the patient’s response. However, the immune landscape of HCC is shaped by a multitude of factors, including chronic inflammation, fibrosis, metabolic dysfunction, and gut‒liver axis dysregulation, all of which contribute to an immunosuppressive and heterogeneous TME. A major predicament lies in the dynamic and context-specific nature of immune responses, which vary not only between patients but also across disease stages and etiologies [ 420 To further elucidate the intricate immune milieu in HCC, future efforts must prioritize the integration of multiomics approaches, spatial transcriptomics, and high-dimensional single-cell technologies to map immune cell phenotypes, functions, and interactions within their anatomical context [ 133 421 422 423 Deniz Seyhan is currently a participant in the NIH Graduate Partnerships Program (GPP) and a graduate student at Sorbonne University and is affiliated with Sorbonne University and the NIH GPP.
