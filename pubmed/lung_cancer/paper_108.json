This study identified granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3) as a key mediator of IPF progression. Elevated CSF3 expression was observed in the lung tissues of IPF patients. Recombinant CSF3 promoted myofibrogenesis in lung fibroblasts, whereas CSF3-deficient mice were protected from bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Treatment with novel CSF3-neutralizing antibodies significantly restored fibrosis in IPF mice by suppressing myofibroblast differentiation and reducing ECM deposition. Here, we demonstrated a reciprocal regulatory relationship between CSF3 and TGF-β that amplifies pro-fibrotic signaling. Our mechanistic studies revealed that CSF3 acts as an upstream regulator of TGF-β, forming a positive feedback loop that significantly accelerates the fibrotic process. Knockout or neutralization of CSF3 suppressed fibrosis by reducing TGF-β levels, whereas treatment with recombinant CSF3 promoted fibrosis with increased TGF-β expression. Notably, while CSF3 inhibition reduced TGF-β expression levels, it did not decrease them below normal levels. This finding suggests that inhibiting CSF3 could simultaneously reduce fibrosis by suppressing excessive TGF-β expression while also minimizing side effects by maintaining TGF-β homeostasis. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that CSF3 is a critical driver of IPF pathogenesis and that targeting CSF3 may provide a therapeutic strategy by modulating TGF-β signaling and restoring the ECM and cellular homeostasis.

This activation leads to the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, promotes ECM deposition, and contributes to tissue remodeling and scar formation. 7 9 10 11 12 13 15 Colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3), also known as granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), is a hematopoietic cytokine traditionally recognized for its role in promoting the production of granulocytes and stem cells from the bone marrow. In addition to its established role in hematopoiesis, CSF3 also regulates various immune responses, particularly the proliferation, survival, and activation of neutrophils. 16 17 18 18 19 In IPF, fibrosis progresses with minimal active inflammation. 20 21 22 16 18 Recent studies have suggested that CSF3 may play a broader role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis, independent of its effects on neutrophils. 18 23 18 24 26 The primary aim of this study is to investigate the functional role of CSF3 in the pathogenesis of IPF, extending beyond its established effects on neutrophils. Our data provide compelling evidence that CSF3 is a crucial mediator of pulmonary fibrosis progression. We demonstrate that CSF3 promotes myofibroblast activation and ECM deposition in lung fibroblasts, while genetic deletion of CSF3 confers protection against bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Mechanistically, we show that CSF3 acts as an upstream regulator of key fibrotic pathways, particularly through the activation of TGF-β, a central mediator of fibrosis. Moreover, our findings indicate that neutralizing CSF3 can reduce fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-β signaling, deactivating myofibroblasts, and restoring the ECM and cellular homeostasis. These findings position CSF3 as a promising therapeutic target for IPF, with the potential to improve patient outcomes by disrupting the pathological processes that underlie disease progression. Results CSF3 is elevated and correlated with fibrosis pathogenesis in pulmonary fibrosis To identify potential biomarkers for pulmonary fibrosis, we analyzed microarray datasets ( GSE71351 GSE134692 GSE71351 GSE134692 1a 1a GSE134692 GSE71351 1b 1b Fig. 1 CSF3 is elevated and correlated with fibrosis pathogenesis in pulmonary fibrosis. a GSE134692 n GSE71351 n b GSE134692 GSE71351 c d e f g h n i j k j k l GSE10667 t Further analysis of IPF patient-derived fibroblasts (IPDF) demonstrated that knockdown of CSF3, along with FGF1, IL1β, and CCL11, resulted in changes in fibrosis marker expression. CSF3 had the most profound effect on the expression of fibrosis markers (Supplementary Fig. 1c 1c 1d–f In the BLM-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis, increased CSF3 expression was also demonstrated in lung tissues via IHC staining (Fig. 1g 1h, i 1j, k 1l Additionally, immunostaining for the CSF3 receptor (CSF3R) revealed elevated expression of CSF3R in both IPF patient samples and BLM-induced IPF mice, consistent with the increased expression of CSF3 (Supplementary Fig. 2a–e CSF3 knockout attenuates pulmonary fibrosis progression To investigate the role of CSF3 in pulmonary fibrosis, we used a CSF3 knockout (KO) mouse model and administered BLM via intratracheal injection (Fig. 2a 2b, c 2d, e 2f, g 3c 3a, b 2h, i 2j–l 4a–c 2m 4d Fig. 2 CSF3 knockout attenuates pulmonary fibrosis progression. a b c b c c +/+ −/− n d–i d e f g h i +/+ −/− j k l m t CSF3 induces pulmonary fibrosis through the CSF3R/STAT3 signaling axis To investigate whether CSF3 contributes to the induction of pulmonary fibrosis, recombinant CSF3 (rCSF3) was administered to human and mouse lung fibroblasts (HLF and MLF). Treatment with rCSF3 increased the expression of fibrosis markers in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3a, b 5a–d 3c 5e 3d 5f 3e 3f 3g −/− 3h–k 3l, m −/− 3n, o 5g, h Fig. 3 CSF3 induces pulmonary fibrosis through the CSF3R/STAT3 signaling axis. a b c b c d e f g h–k h i j k +/+ −/− l m l m n o n o −/− t Evaluation of CSF3-neutralizing antibody FB-101 in pulmonary fibrosis models To evaluate the therapeutic potential of neutralizing CSF3 in pulmonary fibrosis, we developed a CSF3-neutralizing antibody, FB-101, and assessed its efficacy in two distinct BLM-induced IPF mouse models. The reversal therapeutic effect was achieved by IP injection of FB-101 starting 5 days after BLM injection (Fig. 4a 6a 4b–d 6b, c 4e 6d 4f–j 4k, l 6e 4m, n Fig. 4 Evaluation of CSF3-neutralizing antibody FB-101 in pulmonary fibrosis models. a b c b c n d e f–j f g h i j k–n k l m n o–q o p q r t In vitro experiments with IPDF and BLM-MLF confirmed that FB-101 inhibited fibrosis marker expression and reduced CSF3 levels (Fig. 4o–q 7a–c 4p 8a 7d 7e 8b 4r 7f An additional intraperitoneal mouse model induced by BLM confirmed that FB-101 treatment significantly suppressed fibrotic changes in lung tissue, inhibited fibrosis marker expression, and reduced the hydroxyproline content (Supplementary Fig. 9a–f 9g–j CSF3 acts as an upstream regulator of TGF-β in pulmonary fibrosis We demonstrated that the loss of CSF3 function, achieved through neutralizing antibody treatment or gene expression depletion, can prevent and restore the development of pulmonary fibrosis in mouse models. Given the crucial role of TGF-β1 in pulmonary fibrosis, including its involvement in EMT, fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT), ECM deposition, and myofibroblast activation, we aimed to investigate the relationship between CSF3 and TGF-β1 in IPF pathogenesis. GSEA of high versus low CSF3 expression groups in the IPF cohort revealed a positive correlation between TGF-β1 and CSF3 expression (Supplementary Fig. 10a To assess the role of CSF3 in regulating TGF-β1 expression in IPF, we utilized both intraperitoneal and intratracheal BLM-induced mouse models, treating the mice with FB-101 (Fig. 5a, e 5b, f 5d, h 5c, g 10b–d 10e 5i, j 10f Fig. 5 CSF3 acts as an upstream regulator of TGF-β in pulmonary fibrosis. a b–d b c d e f–h f g h I j i j k +/+ −/− l m l m +/+ −/− n–p n o p −/− t To confirm these findings, we used a CSF3 KO model (Fig. 5k 5l 5m −/− 5n–p 10g, h 10i To further investigate the role of CSF3 in TGF-β1 signaling in IPF pathogenesis, we silenced TGF-β receptor II (TGF-βRII) in HLF treated with rCSF3. As expected, the induction of fibrosis marker expression by CSF3 was significantly reduced when TGF-βRII was knocked down (Supplementary Fig. 11a–c 11d 11e 11f 11g, h 11I 11j 11k CSF3 neutralization restores alveolar type 2 cells and modulates immune cell recruitment in pulmonary fibrosis In response to various lung injuries, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells undergo replication and expansion to facilitate tissue repair. However, in the context of pulmonary fibrosis, a pathological condition characterized by excessive scarring, the population of AT2 cells, which are essential for repair, is depleted. In this study, we observed that the depletion of AT2 cells in the lungs during pulmonary fibrosis was restored upon treatment with FB-101 in two distinct BLM-induced IPF mouse models (therapeutic and inhibition) (Fig. 6a 6a 6b 12a 6c 6d 12b Fig. 6 CSF3 neutralization restores alveolar type 2 cells and modulates immune cell recruitment in pulmonary fibrosis. a b c +/+ −/− n n d e Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence that CSF3 plays a crucial role in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Our data demonstrate that CSF3 promotes myofibroblast activation and ECM deposition in lung fibroblasts. Mechanistically, CSF3 functions as an upstream regulator of TGF-β, promoting its expression and signaling. Furthermore, CSF3 acts as a key effector in the progression of pulmonary fibrosis induced by TGF-β. The positive feedback loop between CSF3 and TGF-β appears to constitute a central pathway that regulates both the initiation and progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Furthermore, neutralizing CSF3 can reduce fibrosis by inhibiting TGF-β signaling, deactivating myofibroblasts, and restoring the ECM and cellular homeostasis. These findings position CSF3 as a promising therapeutic target for IPF, with the potential to improve patient outcomes by halting disease progression (Fig. 6e Discussion IPF is a progressive and fatal lung disease with no definitive cure. Currently, FDA-approved antifibrotic drugs primarily serve as palliative treatments, slowing disease progression but failing to halt or reverse the underlying pathological processes of IPF. 2 27 28 29 30 In the present study, we identify CSF3 as a key cytokine in the progression of IPF. Our findings show that CSF3 expression is significantly elevated in lung tissues from IPF patients compared with healthy controls. This increase in CSF3 levels is associated with fibrotic mediators and processes such as ECM remodeling, EMT and FMT, which are central to the pathogenesis of fibrosis. 31 33 One of the intriguing findings of this study is the elevation of CSF3 in IPF tissues, despite the absence of significant inflammation after disease onset. Traditionally, CSF3 is known to regulate neutrophil survival, proliferation, and recruitment, with neutrophils playing a central role in acute inflammation. 34 35 36 35 37 38 39 41 However, our findings demonstrate that recombinant human CSF3 administration significantly enhances fibrogenesis in human lung fibroblasts, promoting their differentiation into myofibroblasts and driving increased expression of key ECM components. In contrast, knockout of the CSF3 gene confers protection against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, suggesting that CSF3 is integral to the fibrotic response. Furthermore, the administration of CSF3-neutralizing antibodies resulted in a notable reversal of pulmonary fibrosis in IPF mouse models, supporting the hypothesis that CSF3 is a central mediator in the development and maintenance of fibrosis. This therapeutic effect was associated with a reduction in TGF-β expression and signaling, deactivation of myofibroblasts, and restoration of collagen homeostasis. These findings provide direct evidence linking CSF3 to the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, thereby supplementing the currently limited understanding of CSF3’s effects on fibroblasts and the fibrotic process. In addition to extending previous research that primarily focused on the role of CSF3 in neutrophil biology, these results underscore the potential of targeting CSF3 as a viable therapeutic strategy for IPF. Neutrophils play a multifaceted role in IPF. While they are essential for the early inflammatory response to lung injury, their continued presence in fibrotic tissue has been linked to disease progression. 42 35 38 43 18 24 44 45 The relationship between CSF3 and TGF-β is of particular interest. TGF-β is a principal driver of fibrosis and is capable of inducing fibroblast activation, myofibroblast differentiation, and ECM production. 46 48 48 49 50 51 Additionally, our findings indicate that CSF3 influences the expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase alpha (P4HA), a pivotal enzyme implicated in collagen synthesis and fibrosis. 52 53 54 Despite these promising results, several limitations should be recognized. While the bleomycin-induced mouse model is widely used, it may not fully capture the chronic progression and complex etiology of human IPF. To complement this limitation, recent clinical studies have implicated CSF3 in the pathogenesis of IPF. Elevated CSF3 levels have been detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of IPF patients, with significant correlations to impaired lung function and poor prognosis. 18 In conclusion, our study identifies CSF3 as a critical cytokine involved in the initiation, progression, and maintenance of pulmonary fibrosis. By acting as an upstream regulator of TGF-β, CSF3 enhances key fibrotic pathways and promotes the pathological processes of IPF. Targeting CSF3 with neutralizing antibodies represents a promising therapeutic strategy to restore fibrosis, selectively suppress excessive TGF-β signaling while preserving normal homeostatic functions. Given the limitations of current therapies, CSF3-targeted treatments offer a novel approach to address the unmet need for more effective therapies for IPF. Our findings provide a strong rationale for further clinical investigations into CSF3 inhibition as a potential treatment for IPF and other fibrotic diseases. However, although antibody-based therapies such as CSF3-neutralizing antibodies exhibit high target specificity, the possibility of off-target effects cannot be entirely excluded. Therefore, comprehensive evaluation through toxicological and safety studies will be essential to ensure clinical applicability. Materials and Methods Experimental animals and bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis model The Animal study was approved by the Hanyang University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (IACUC No. 202270107 A). Seven-week-old C57BL/6N female mice (weighing ~20 g) were purchased from Orient Bio, and pulmonary fibrosis was induced via intraperitoneal or intratracheal (IT) bleomycin (BLM) injection. Briefly, BLM was administered at 1 mg/kg once and 100 mg/kg four times, respectively, to establish IT and intraperitoneal (IP) pulmonary fibrosis models. To determine the effect of CSF3 inhibition on preventing pulmonary fibrosis, randomly divided groups of mice received four IP injections of PBS, control IgG, or anti-CSF3 antibody (250 μg/kg) at intervals of 2 days (IT model) or 3 days (IP model), the day after BLM administration. Mice were monitored daily and sacrificed 14 days (IT model) or 21 days (IP model) after BLM administration to collect fresh lungs. The left lung was used for histological analysis, and the right lung was used for molecular biochemical analysis, such as qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and hydroxyproline assays. The therapeutic effect of neutralizing CSF3 antibodies (FB-101) on pulmonary fibrosis was assessed by delayed administration of antibodies to BLM-injected mice. Antibodies were administered intraperitoneally at 500 μg/kg for the IT model and 250 μg/kg for the IP model four times every other day. The CSF3-deficient mice were generated at Macrogen Inc. using the CRISPR/Cas9 system in a C57BL/6 background. In a comparative study of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis in CSF3-deficient and wild-type mice, BLM was administered at 1 mg/kg once for IT injection and 100 mg/kg four times for IP injection. For the CSF3-induced fibrosis model, low doses of BLM were treated first to induce minimal inflammatory responses, and then recombinant CSF3 was used. Female mice (7-week-old) were given a BLM solution (20 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally on day 1). Mice were sacrificed on day 30. The 8-week-old female mice were injected intraperitoneally with recombinant mouse CSF3 protein at a concentration of 100 μg/kg every other day for 4 weeks (3 times per week) starting on day 1 to induce pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Mice were then sacrificed on day 30. Primary lung fibroblast isolation Primary mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF) were isolated from whole lungs of wild-type C57BL/6 treated with/without BLM and CSF3 KO (CSF3 −/− 55 Measurement of hydroxyproline content and siRNA knockdown Hydroxyproline content in mouse lung tissue or primary lung fibroblasts was quantified using a hydroxyproline assay kit (Chondrex, Inc., #6017) using 10 mg of mouse tissues according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for small interfering RNA (siRNA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The TGFβRII or CSF3R siRNA was purchased from Santa Cruz (Cat. No. sc-36657 for TGFβRII) or Genolution, Inc. for CSF3R. The corresponding target sequences are 5’-GGUGUCGUACCGCGUUCUAUU-3’ for CSF3 (i), and 5’-GUUUGACUCCCGAACAUCAUU-3’ for CSF3 (ii), respectively. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and human tissue array (TMA) In this study, immunohistochemical analysis was performed with the left lung lobe of mice as previously described. In brief, 4 μm-thick sections from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissue blocks were deparaffinized with xylene, dipped in 100%, 95%, 80% and 70% ethanol for hydration and washed with tap water for 10 min. Heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) was performed using citrate buffer, pH 6.0 (Sigma, #C9999). After blocking with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), sections were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBST (10% Tween 20 in PBS), the sections were washed with PBST (10% Tween 20 in PBS) and then treated with biotinylated pan-specific secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, 1:200) for 1 h. After incubation with ABC solution (Vector Laboratories, #PK-6100), the signal visualization was performed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories, #SK-4100). Counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin for 3 min. Sections were mounted, and images were captured using an IX71 microscope (Olympus). Human pulmonary interstitial fibrosis tissue array samples were purchased from US Biomax Inc. (#LC561a), and IHC was performed using anti-CSF3 or CSF3R antibody according to the IHC analysis protocol. IHC scores were obtained using Image J with the algorithm of the IHC profiler. 56 Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). For this purpose, publicly available RNA-seq and microarray gene expression profiling datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and analyzed using GSEA software (version 4.3.3). The datasets from both healthy individuals and IPF patients are publicly accessible via GEO (accession numbers: GSE134692 GSE71351 GSE10667 GSE134692 GSE71351 GSE10667 GSE10667 Histological staining Paraffin-embedded mouse lung samples were cut to obtain 4-μm-thick slices. Sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated for histological staining. For Hematoxylin–Eosin (H&E) staining, lung sections were sequentially subjected to hematoxylin (YD diagnostics, #S2-5), differentiation in 70% ethanol containing 1% HCl, and alcoholic Eosin (BBC Biochemical, # MA0101015). Masson’s trichrome staining of lung sections was conducted according to the manufacturer’s instruction kit (Bio Quochem, #KH07007). Picrosirius red staining was carried out using the Picro Sirius Red Stain Kit (Abcam, #ab150681) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Collagen fiber was evaluated using a BX50 microscope (Olympus) with a polarizing filter as previously described. Micrographs were digitized into 8-bit grayscale images using ImageJ software. Collagen fiber areas were then quantified in black and white by adjusting the threshold without damaging the original image.
