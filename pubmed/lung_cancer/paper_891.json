A series of benzylamine- and benzimidazole-substituted compounds were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity. Key findings include the identification of naphthalene and quinoline-based scaffolds with hydroxyl substitutions, which exhibited superior inhibition of PAD1 and PAD4 (IC 50 13 16 50 13 16 PAD inhibitor Citrullination Structure-activity relationship Naphthalene scaffold Enzyme inhibition pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
