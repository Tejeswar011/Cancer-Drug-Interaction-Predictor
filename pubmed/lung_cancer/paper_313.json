A BSTRACT Introduction: Over half of the world’s population cooks using solid fuels, which poses serious health hazards, making women and children more vulnerable to household air pollution (HAP). Despite progress towards universal access to cleaner fuels, 47% of families continue to use fossil fuels. Objectives: This review aimed to understand the perceptions of solid fuel users in South Asian countries regarding the use of solid fuel for lighting, heating, and cooking. Materials and Methods: The perceptions of solid fuel users were categorized into six key domains derived from the Social Ecological Model (SEM): (a) Community, Family, and Health, (b) Home, Space, Place, and Roles, (c) Cultural and Cooking Practices, (d) Environment, and (e) Practice and Policy Development. This scoping assessment was conducted using the PRISMA-ScR guideline, and finally twenty-four articles were selected from four databases: Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and PubMed. The result was categorized under six key domains based on the SEM. Results: The review revealed inconsistencies and a research gap in HAP perceptions. Participants prioritized household security over ventilation and short-term health over the long-term benefits of treatment. Women and children, experiencing higher HAP exposure rates than men, had less decision-making authority over the use of solid fuels, highlighting a socio-demographic gender gap. Community norms and cultural traditions play a crucial role in policy and practice. Conclusion: Further research and locally-based, community-led interventions are necessary to bridge these gaps and minimize the global burden of illness related to HAP. Addressing the identified gaps and disconnects is crucial to decreasing the global illness burden linked to HAP.

Improved Cooking Stoves (ICS) are cooking devices designed to use less fuel and emit less smoke than traditional stoves. They offer a range of benefits, including decreased fuelwood consumption, better indoor air quality, decreased greenhouse gas emissions, and improved health for users.[ 6 6 7 8 9 The key difference lies in household responsibilities. Traditionally, women in South Asia are the primary cooks, they spend more time near the stove, inhaling harmful pollutants released when using solid fuels like firewood. Men, typically not involved in everyday cooking, have less exposure. This unequal exposure creates a gender gap in health problems linked to air pollution from solid fuels. Hence, due to cultural norms, women disproportionately bear the health risks of using solid fuels for cooking due to their primary role in household chores.[ 10 When introducing new cooking methods, it is essential to consider the interplay of cooking practices and cultural norms, particularly in South Asian countries, where social and festive feasts prepared in traditional ways often hold significance in religious events.[ 11 12 13 14 A major barrier to long-term behavior changes and the adoption of healthier cooking practices is a lack of knowledge about the detrimental health consequences of HAP.[ 15 16 17 18 Despite the availability of cleaner cooking methods, their adoption remains uneven. This disparity might be attributed to a knowledge gap regarding the health effects of (HAP) generated by solid fuels. While robust evidence exists linking solid fuel use and HAP exposure to adverse cardiovascular and respiratory health outcomes,[ 19 20 21 The Social Ecological Model (SEM) is a theory-based framework [ Figure 1 21 22 23 Figure 1 Social ecological model theory-based framework Understanding community perspectives on solid biomass fuel use is essential for developing effective interventions that align with local needs and practices. Conducting a systematic scoping review of the available literature can yield significant insights into household attitudes, obstacles to adopting cleaner energy, and how primary care and public health initiatives can help to reduce the risks associated with HAP. This study intends to compile existing evidence regarding the perceptions of solid biomass fuel utilization in South Asian homes, emphasizing key themes that can inform policy, healthcare practices, and community-oriented interventions. By merging insights from various studies, this review aims to assist family medicine and primary care providers in tackling health issues related to HAP through culturally appropriate and evidence-based approaches. Materials and Methods Design A scoping assessment was conducted using the PRISMA-ScR, guideline[ 24 Search method To locate relevant studies, searches were conducted using four internet databases: Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed. We conducted a structured search by using search terms. The search terms included “Perceptions”, OR “Perspective”, OR “Belief”‘, “Lived experience”, OR “Experience”, OR “Voice”, OR “Attitude”, OR “Living” AND “Household air pollution”, “Indoor air Pollution”, “Solid fuel” AND South Asian countries. Finally, we combined these search terms with each database’s unique search technique and set of Boolean operators (AND/OR). Eligibility criteria This scoping review employed a systematic approach to identify relevant studies on solid fuel use in South Asia. Here’s a breakdown of the criteria for inclusion and exclusion based on the Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework:  1. Population (P) Inclusion:  2. Concept (C) Inclusion:  3. Context (C) Inclusion: Additional considerations  Language: Only studies published in English from the year 2000 to 2021 were considered eligible. Study Design: Exclusion criteria  Case reports, reviews, and editorials were not included. Research that exclusively examined non-domestic solid fuel consumers’ opinions (traders, construction workers, etc.). Studies that didn’t look into participants’ opinions or experiences with using solid fuels. Results Search results and screening process The scoping review employed a rigorous search strategy to identify relevant studies. A comprehensive search using various keywords was conducted across relevant academic databases. This initial search yielded a total of 9484 articles. Duplicates were identified and removed using reference management software, resulting in 9229 unique articles. Level 1 screening Titles and abstracts of the 9229 articles were screened against the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria (outlined previously). This level of screening excluded 9142 articles that did not meet the eligibility criteria. Reasons for exclusion could include:  Focus on non-domestic solid fuel users (e.g., commercial users). Investigation of topics unrelated to user perceptions of solid fuel use. Publication dates outside the specified timeframe (2000–2021). Language other than English. Full-text screening The remaining 87 articles underwent a full-text review for a more in-depth evaluation. Following this detailed analysis, an additional 63 articles were excluded due to:  Lack of focus on user perceptions of solid fuel use. Failure to explore one or more of the designated areas of interest (cooking, heating, lighting). Final selection A total of 24 studies were considered eligible for inclusion in the scoping review after all the filters were applied [depicted in Figure 2 Figure 2 Flow diagram of included studies Distribution of studies The results analysis is categorized under six key domains based on the Socio-Ecological Model: (a) Health, community, and family life, (b) Roles, home, place, and space, (c) Environment, (d) Cultural and cooking practices, and (e) Practice, and policy development. Notably, the domains of health and cooking and cultural practices encompassed nearly half of the selected studies [ Table 1 Table 1 Evidence of the perception of solid biomass fuel utilization in Southeast Asian countries Author year Country Objective Study design/study setting Methods of data collection Study participants/sample size Focus of study (SF vs. ICS) Perceptions of domestic fuel users’ main focus of study? Outcomes Other findings Alam et al.,[ 31 Bangladesh To assess, the health effects of burning biomass in improved cookstoves, by taking into account socioeconomic conditions. Mixed methods Questionnaire (qualitative and quantitative questions), FGD Women ICS users/60 ICS Yes Most of the responders (93%) said that their hands were less rough, and 88% said that using the improved system prevented hand burns during cooking. The majority of women (98%) experienced changes in their lifestyle and overall health. The typical stove no longer poses as many health risks. After using ICS, women’s share of the household income increased by 0.24% (or 13.83 taka/month on average). 25% less time spent cooking and 45 takas less money spent on fuel every month. By using the ICS, the typical household saved 1.5 kg of fuel and 45 minutes every day. Ali et al.,[ 36 Pakistan To learn the community’s perceptions on household air pollution resulting from the utilization of biofuels. Qualitative Questionnaire Men and women aged 19–95. Of the participants, 26% were female and 74% were male. SF Yes The majority of respondents (94.7%) knew that utilizing dry wood, having adequate ventilation, and a host of other strategies are better ways to reduce pollution and the prevalence of diseases than LPG and natural gas. In the summer, the majority of cooking (79.8%) is done outside, while in the winter, inside. The women made a significant decision (69%) about fuel selection, primarily based on the fuel’s availability and affordability. Baquié and Urpelainen[ 39 India To identify factors that are predictive of cooking arrangements and fuel availability satisfaction. Mixed- methods/rural Survey Homes ( n n n Different fuel types Yes Access to LPG, a contemporary cooking fuel, is a strong indicator of high subjective satisfaction, mostly due to faster cooking and lower smoke levels. Although households find it inconvenient to gather firewood, they are not happy about having to travel great distances to buy it. The factors that matter most are subjective satisfaction, smoke reduction, cooking speed, and food quality (difficulty, expense, and safety). Bhogle[ 44 India, Karnataka To explain the collaboration of NGOs and a self-help group to provide rural women the chance to become stove entrepreneurs and earn money. Qualitative/rural village Case study 35–45 years old women/118 households ICS No (equal focus on NGOs) It seems that the strategy of utilizing women as distributors of stoves has been effective. Additionally, the money made from building stoves stays in the hamlet and in the hands of the women who live there. It guarantees that high-quality stoves that live up to user expectations can be installed using local expertise and resources, free from the need for government intervention or onerous paperwork, approvals, inspections, etc., The money made from building stoves stays in the village and in the hands of the women who live there. Borah[ 25 India, Meghalaya To ascertain the degree of perceived physiological effort, physiological responses, and muscular-skeletal problems during firewood collection. Mixed- methods/rural Questions Tribal women 20-50 years old/40 SF No Getting firewood is one of the most strenuous jobs for women since, compared to many industrial workers, they have a higher Cardiovascular Stress Index. Average heart rate, energy expenditure, total cardiac cost of labor, and physiological cost of labor were 47.92 ppm, 11.90 kj/min, 8529.59 beats, and 129.67 bpm, respectively, when gathering firewood. The cardiovascular stress index was 47.25, which is relatively high compared to many people engaged in manufacturing operations. Farm women assessed perceived physical exertion as “heavy to very heavy.” The prevalence of musculoskeletal issues was also very high, with farm women reporting severe to extremely severe pain in their neck, head, arms, wrists, fingers, and upper and lower backs. Since gathering firewood contributes to environmental degradation, it is not a practice that should be promoted. In addition, millions of women and girls worldwide run the risk of being sexually assaulted, physically assaulted, or even killed while gathering the firewood needed to prepare meals for their families. Devakumar et al.,[ 27 Southern Nepal To investigate women’s perceptions and actual experiences with the negative health effects of household air pollution. Qualitative/urban and peri-urban areas FGDs and artwork Women/26 HAP Yes Women and small children were thought to be the most susceptible, with the respiratory and ocular systems suffering the most physical impacts. Women who were exposed to air pollution experienced reduced food intake and fatigue as psychosocial impacts. Feelings of helplessness were clear: “I am uneducated and I do not understand much. I just cook the food”. Time to find a solution was an issue, particularly for mothers who had young children to look after. It was evident that feelings of helplessness were present: “I am not educated and do not understand, All I do is prepare the food. It was an issue to find the solution for mothers who had young children to look after. Firdaus and Ahmad[ 26 India To evaluate the self-reported sickness of the studied families and to measure the indoor air quality of households using an integrated survey and interview technique. Qualitative/urban Questionnaires Heads of households/5949 HAP and SF Yes The majority of health issues were linked to elements of inadequate housing and/or deteriorated indoor air quality. The use of conventional fuels (64%), the absence of a kitchen (59%), exposure to ambient tobacco smoke (ETS) (55%), and inadequate ventilation (55%), were shown to pose the greatest health concerns. One of the most common health issues inhabitants face is acute respiratory infections (43%) which have a substantial correlation with using traditional fuels (adjusted OR 2.7, 95% CI 2.3–3.1). The use of conventional fuels (adjusted OR 3.8, 95% CI 3.4–4.3), exposure to ETS (adjusted OR 2.5, 95% CI 2.2–2.7), and inadequate ventilation (adjusted OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.13–1.41) are all significantly associated with asthma. There is also a significant association between ETS exposure and cardiovascular illnesses (adjusted OR 2.25, 95% CI 2.01–2.53) and lung cancer (adjusted OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.38–1.71). It is clear that indoor environmental conditions has a significant impact on health. Gould and Urpelainen[ 9 India To provide the findings of an LPG usage survey to comprehend how clean cooking fuel might be incorporated into the energy mixes of rural homes. Qualitative/rural 2014-2015 ACCESS survey Households/8500 LPG Yes Fuel prices are a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Since few homes switch to LPG when they utilize firewood, fuel stockpiling is the norm. Positive opinions of LPG as a practical and hygienic cooking fuel are held by both users and non-users. Though affordability hinders a full switch from traditional biomass to clean cooking fuels, the growing usage of LPG in rural India holds considerable potential. Gupta and Köhlin[ 43 India To examine the demand for different fuels using a rating exercise that demonstrates how different factors influence fuel preferences. Mixed methods Survey Households/5000 Various fuel types No (preference more than perception) Due to poor cross-price elasticities, the subsidies have less potential to reduce pollution from fuels like coal and fuelwood, but there is more chance for improvement if LPG is more widely available and people are more conscious of indoor air pollution. Households consider several characteristics linked to each fuel option before them in addition to price and market-related criteria when selecting a domestic fuel for daily consumption. The household determined the five most significant attributes for each fuel to be: (i) Fuel price; (ii) Cost of cooking device (oven, hot plate, stove, etc.) required to use the fuel; (iii) Fuel ease of handling, storage, and use; (iv) Fuel availability as perceived by the household; and (v) Indoor air pollution caused by fuel use, based on information available to the household. Hessen et al.,[ 34 Nepal To assess the elements of the kitchen and motivational aspects that could affect the execution of better cookstove initiatives. Qualitative/rural Questionnaire Caregivers of households/62 ICS Yes As opposed to 16% of caregivers with traditional stoves, all caregivers with improved stoves indicated satisfaction with their appliances. No variations in the amount of time spent cooking or in the kitchen. Less smoke and enhanced health were the primary driving forces for the installation of an upgraded stove. The villagers agreed to pay 8% of their annual gross per capita revenue to have a better stove built. The shortcomings in the new stoves’ design that could have affected their ability to reduce smoke. Jeuland et al.,[ 45 North India To compile data on user preferences for ICS features that burn biomass, such as fuel requirements, pollution, and inconvenience. Quantitative/rural WTP (willingness to pay) surveys Households/2120 ICS No (preference more than perception) Families have a substantial innate dependence on and preference for traditional stoves; this preference exceeds the $10 and $5, respectively, that they are ready to pay for realistic (33%) reductions in smoke emissions and fuel requirements. Preferences for stove features are very diverse and connected with several aspects of the home (such as spending, patience, risk of preferences, and the gender of the head of the household). Although households show a cautious interest in some aspects of ICS, it is doubtful that ICS will be widely adopted because many homes seem to prefer traditional stoves to ICS with comparable features Khushk et al.,[ 35 Pakistan To evaluate women’s acceptance of improved stoves and their effects on society, health, and acceptability. Qualitative/rural Questionnaire and FGDs Women/259 ICS Yes The majority of women stated that using smoke-free stoves, or SFS, improves their health and produces less smoke. According to the multivariate analysis, women who use SFS are less likely than those who use TS (traditional stoves) to experience symptoms of dry cough (AOR ¼ 0.61; 95% CI 0.26–1.41), sneezing (AOR ¼ 0.54; 95% CI 0.22–1.30), and tears while cooking (AOR ¼ 0.51; 95% CI 0.21–1.21). Perhaps as a result of the small sample, the results were not statistically significant. The CO levels were 15.4±3.4 ppm on average (±S.E.) in SFS and 28.5±5.7 ppm in TS kitchens with a mean difference of ) 13.1 (95% CI ) 29.5 and 3.2). The majority of women were unaware of the fuel use and stove efficiency. Women who used traditional stoves reported coughing, breathing difficulties, and more tears during cooking (TWC). Malakar et al.,[ 37 India To investigate how social structure contributes to the continued use of solid fuels in cooking. Qualitative/rural Interviews and FGDs Women and Men (25–80 years) 31 families SF Yes Solid fuel cooking is entwined with structural components like long-standing customs, customs that generate income traditionally, gender roles, and a feeling of community. The decisions made by households to stick with solid fuels even after modern alternatives have become available and accepted are heavily influenced by these variable. The following factors could cause efforts aimed at decreasing the use of solid fuels to fail: 1) concentrate primarily on providing contemporary fuels; 2) ignore contextual social barriers; and 3) implement as standalone projects. Malakar[ 40 India To look into the circumstances surrounding a household’s decision to hold off on adopting LPG technology in favor of TV technology. Mixed- methods/rural Interview (qualitative and quantitative questions) and participant observations Women and men/12 households Various fuel types Yes The decision to accept or reject improved fuels is not much influenced by one’s income level. It is crucial to comprehend the larger framework of decision-making that families function in and use to make all of their decisions to comprehend the fuel choice option made by a household. If we look into why people prefer or reject a particular fuel over another, it might not provide a clear image for us. Miah et al.,[ 28 Bangladesh To ascertain the traditional cooking stoves’ structural features, the quantity of wood fuel used, and the environmental and socioeconomic effects of the use of wood fuel in traditional cooking stoves. Mixed- methods Semi-structured questionnaire Households/60 Cooking stoves and various types of fuel No The quantity of wood fuel used annually by each family was greatly influenced by factors such as size, income, quantity cooked, and number of burning hours. The study found that accounting for variations in family sizes, each family used 4.24 tons of fuelwood annually. According to the survey, 53% of families used biomass fuels with kerosene, 5% used LPG, and 42% used exclusively biomass fuel. Homestead woodlands provided 40% of the biomass fuel. It has been determined that the incomplete burning of biomass in conventional cooking stoves causes significant health risks to people and adds to global warming. Eighty-three percent of the people would like to prefer improved cooking stoves over traditional cooking stoves. Rahut et al.,[ 10 Pakistan To investigate the trends and determinants of Pakistani urban households’ use of cooking fuel, to examine the variables influencing the household’s fuel selection, to validate the variables influencing the fuel selection, and to carry out multiple robustness tests regarding the impact of household wealth and education at varying levels on fuel choice behavior. Qualitative/Urban and rural areas The study examines the many forms of energy that urban families utilize for cooking by using the 2014-2015 Pakistan Social and living standards measurement survey and robust econometric methods Households/78,635 (13,965 urban households and 64,670 rural households) Cooking fuel Yes Solid fuels are used for cooking by a sizable section of Pakistan’s urban population, which is bad for the environment and people’s health. More precisely, wealthier and better-educated households favor clean energy sources like gas for cooking, whereas fuelwood, dung, and crop residue are typically used by poorer households. Additionally, it demonstrates that human capital, household economic status, gender, and area affects the fuel that homes use to cook. Rhodes et al.,[ 33 Peru, Nepal and Kenya To narrate the traditional cooking practices and use of stoves and figure out the implications of these practices for the adoption of ICS and stove design. Qualitative Interviews and direct observations Women (20-49 years)/117 ICS Yes Across different sites, cooking practices exhibit general similarities, but locally specific norms and preferences influence traditional stove use and desired improvements. These tailored stoves facilitate easy cooking and maintenance. While women in each setting express a desire for new stoves, they articulate distinct alterations to meet their needs. A single stove design for locally available biomass fuels won’t suffice across all three sites. Locally produced or adapted improved cookstoves may better address diverse cooking demands and environmental concerns.” Creating a cookstove design that fits everyone’s needs is challenging due to diverse user values and requirements. Rouse[ 29 India To provide the results and lessons discovered from a continuous program to enhance biomass cook stoves. Qualitative Discussions and observations Women ICS No Designing and implementing efficient and sustainable energy solutions requires gaining a thorough understanding of beneficiaries, including their needs, attitudes, resources, and environment. One strategy to assist assure the efficacy, applicability, and sustainability of a stove program is to involve the community in the design, testing, and manufacturing of the stove. It is stressed how important it is for field workers to talk about problems, listen to stakeholders, watch people cooking, and be flexible. Sunikka-Blank et al.,[ 38 India To understand how female inhabitants’ cooking, thermal comfort, entertainment, childrearing, and working practices have altered since the relocation, as well as how relocation impacts domestic energy usage and the elements that influence it, is necessary to comprehend Mumbai’s primary slum rehabilitation housing typologies. Qualitative Semi-structured interviews and FGD (with local communities- relevant) Women/25 Housing Yes The significant disparities in gender-based patterns across all households surveyed: women handle all domestic tasks, even when they have outside jobs. After rehabilitation, women’s domestic habits underwent a significant transformation. Water availability and LPG have altered cooking and cleaning habits. Because dwelling typologies have been poorly designed, comfort practices have evolved to rely heavily on electric appliances like air conditioners and fans. Activities related to cleaning, amusement, and raising children have shifted indoors. This has resulted in decreased social engagement, a loss of women’s social capital, and a higher energy intensity. Gender dynamics is a crucial component of sustainable housing and energy access for slum rehabilitation, as well as how housing and energy affect women’s behaviors. Thurber et al.,[ 30 India To evaluate the advantages and difficulties of a commercial approach to the distribution of the “Oorja” stove in India. Mixed- methods Surveys and interviews Households/998 ICS No To evaluate the advantages and difficulties of a Pre-existing stove mix among homes and the level of Oorja marketing in a region both had a major impact on Oorja purchase rates. LPG-using families saw the highest adoption rate since Oorja’s pelletized biomass fuel lowers expenses for them. Oorja’s marketing messages about smoke and health did not have a substantial impact on the choice to buy, but they did seem to change how people in the home felt about smoking. The Oorja case study demonstrates that these companies can grow to a significant size with enough funding support as well as astute marketing and distribution plans. Bhojvaid et al.,[ 46 India To investigate the differences in preferences and perceptions for ICS in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, as evidenced by 11 rural villages or hamlets’ semi-structured focus groups and interviews. Qualitative Semi-structured interviews were conducted with homes residing in or close to the communities chosen for the focus group discussions, as well as structured focus groups that adhered to a certain questionnaire and protocol. Women and men/103 ICS Yes Observed that preferences for ICS are positively correlated with perceptions of time savings and health, and detected cautious curiosity in novel ICS technologies. Additional respondent and community variables, such as gender, education, past exposure to clean stoves and organizations that support comparable technologies, and social norms asseen by neighbors’ behavior, also seem to be significant. It is anticipated that a mix of carefully planned social marketing and promotion activities, supply-chain enhancements, and possibly incentives to lower the upfront cost of stoves will be needed to expand the acceptance and use of ICS in rural India. Wang and Bailis[ 32 India To highlight the socio-political factors behind the traditional chulha cookstove’s removal. Qualitative Surveys, semi-structured interviews Households ICS Yes Through the use of cleaner stoves and the removal of traditional ones, underprivileged people can break away from behaviors that reinforce their social stigma. Because they are more sensitive to the strong smoke of chulha, which contaminates their kitchenware, clothes, and utensils, lower caste homes tend to get rid of chulha more quickly. Weaver et al.,[ 41 Dhaka, Bangladesh To determine the impact of household behavioral and structural interventions to increase ventilation on in-door PM2.5 concentrations; characterize the acceptability and feasibility of behavioral and structural ventilation interventions in a low-income urban area; and explain the relationships between current ventilation structure and behaviors and PM2.5 concentrations. Mixed- methods In-depth inter-views Households/88 Household intervention No There are difficulties to raising ventilation, and in places with high ambient PM2.5 concentrations, even while ventilation may lower indoor PM2.5 concentrations. There was very little change in the length of high PM2.5 concentrations when doors and windows were opened. A number of factors were found to be motivators, such as comfort, and obstacles, such as perceived theft risk, physical space constraints, and landlord resistance to ventilation measures. Wijayatunga and Attalage[ 42 Sri Lanka To highlight the policy concerns related to rural electricity supplies and potential remedies for them within the framework of Sri Lanka’s broader energy sector picture. Mixed- methods Questionnaire Energy supplies No Unless significant legislative changes occur in this sector, it is doubtful that the rural people will switch from using biomass to any other fuel type for cooking. When contrasted with the nearly free availability of biomass, one of the primary obstacles to the growth of cooking fuel consumption in LPG, kerosene, and electricity is the high cost of operation. Additionally, households are not encouraged to switch to more convenient fuels by living in rural areas. The lack of awareness and accessibility of renewable energy technologies for the rural populace has resulted in significant limitations on the utilization of biogas and solar power. Health The studies examined the perceptions of long-term health issues, including significant pain in the wrists, neck, head, and upper and lower back, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), that are linked to firewood collection and exposure to solid fuel.[ 25 26 27 28 29 30 26 26 27 25 Because children were always in the household when the mother cooked, concerns were frequently expressed for the children, who were believed to be especially susceptible to breathing in smoke or getting burned.[ 27 31 32 33 31 34 35 et al. 35 According to Alam et al. 31 36 36 et al 30 Community and family life Many studies stress the importance of community attitudes, actions, customs, and convictions regarding the usage of solid fuels and the implementation of Improved Cook Stoves (ICS).[ 31 35 37 38 37 38 31 27 10 10 Significant gender disparities in household practices highlight that women perform all tasks regardless of their employment status, leading to substantial changes in women’s household routines following rehabilitation.[ 38 38 38 Roles, home, place, and space Solid fuel cooking generates soot and smoke,[ 39 32 35 40 32 27 27 36 41 Cultural and cooking practices According to our review, household cooking behaviors are influenced by cultural customs, norms, and habits.[ 33 37 37 32 42 In particular, younger generations seemed less concerned about Improved Cook Stoves (ICS) bursting and creating fires and were more easily persuaded to embrace new habits.[ 32 33 37 33 Additionally, the research found that the variety—or lack thereof—of fuel types readily available in the vicinity of the dwelling influences the choice of cooking fuel.[ 43 9 32 38 For some, the time spent getting fuel was an opportunity to interact with others. Some appreciated the flexibility and adaptability of open solid fuel stoves since they reduced the amount of lifting necessary to move large cooking pots; allowing them to be placed on the ground and moved to different positions as needed. Cooking capacity was also a major factor in choosing the stove/fuel type used for particular meals, considering how many people could be fed, how big a cooking pot a given stove could heat, what kinds of household cooking pots could be used with that method, and how many cooking pots could be used at once.[ 33 38 44 Compared to conventional solid fuel-based fires, issues with enhanced biomass cookstoves and stoves using cleaner fuels were more often related to their longevity, upkeep, and repair.[ 34 38 32 33 Environment Solid fuel harvesting, particularly firewood collection, is a major contributor to deforestation.[ 25 27 27 27 27 25 Practice and policy development In the review, microeconomic restrictions surfaced as a major topic about practice and policy development as a roadblock to shifting behavior away from solid fuels. It has long been known that cleaner fuels or technology (Improved Cook Stoves [ICS]) are expensive.[ 27 46 et al. 27 9 9 43 43 43 Research showed that good stoves that meet user expectations can be built using local skills and resources without depending upon government mechanisms, complex paperwork, approvals, or inspections.[ 44 44 Observed that preferences for ICS are positively correlated with perceptions of time savings and health.[ 46 39 39 Considering that firewood is a free fuel, households don’t appear to mind the hassle of collecting it. As they have to travel and spend limited funds on a basic need, they view the trip to the firewood markets as convenient.[ 39 43 27 42 42 Discussion The scoping review adopted a social-ecological lens to examine the complex decision-making processes surrounding solid fuel use within South Asian households. Moving beyond basic cost-benefit analyses, the review explored the multifaceted nature of fuel choice. It acknowledges the interplay between social factors (e.g., cultural norms, gender roles) and ecological considerations (e.g., fuel availability, environmental impact) that influence household decisions. This Social Ecological Model (SEM) framework provides a holistic understanding of the dynamics underlying solid fuel use, enabling the development of targeted interventions that address the social, cultural, and environmental dimensions of this challenge. Fuel choices are influenced by a confluence of practical considerations (cost, accessibility) and less tangible elements like cultural norms and gender roles. Our review brings to the fore the gaps between the perception of solid fuel users and the different domains (health, policy, etc.) of SEM, which can be termed “disconnects.” For instance, while most research links solid fuel use to adverse health effects (respiratory issues), some studies report no correlation or even perceive smoke as having benefits (insect control).[ 47 38 Crucially, these results show that applying theoretical frameworks to (health) behavior modification may be relevant to improving our knowledge of how to create long-lasting interventions that lower HAP.[ 48 49 50 51 Solid fuel use exhibits temporal variations. Fuel selection is a dynamic process influenced by immediate needs (number of family members, season, food preparation).[ 52 53 33 37 33 54 41 42 51 47 55 27 32 56 57 The final disconnect lies in the gap between household needs and policy interventions. Policies aimed at reducing dependence on fossil fuels (subsidies, for example) are often perceived as ineffective by the communities they target.[ 58 59 60 53 53 Similarly, even though some Improved Cookstoves (ICSs) have been subsidized, they are still mostly out of reach for the poorest households. Incentives are not always monetary; however, as participants point out, for instance, the Maharashtra State Government (India) grants awards for “Clean Villages”.[ 53 52 53 Again exposure to household air pollution from biomass fuel significantly increases the risk of poor health compared to cleaner alternatives like liquid fuels with inadequate ventilation. These insights are particularly relevant within the context of South Asian countries, where solid biomass fuel remains a dominant energy source due to socioeconomic and cultural factors. The study underscores the urgent need for improved awareness and interventions promoting cleaner cooking technologies and enhanced ventilation to mitigate the adverse health effects of household air pollution.[ 61 62 Finally, the findings highlighted the paucity of research on people’s perceptions of policy and practice (law, stakeholder roles, etc.) as well as the environment (deforestation, for example, and the relationship between ambient air pollution and household air pollution [HAP]), as well as the societal domains covered by the social ecology model. Future research should delve deeper into these areas. For instance, how do communities perceive the effectiveness of current policies in addressing fuel availability and access? Additionally, how do cultural norms and social structures influence the adoption of cleaner technologies? By investigating these questions, researchers can contribute to the development of more targeted interventions that promote sustainable fuel transitions in South Asia. Relevant to family physician and primary health care provider HAP is a significant public health issue, especially in low- and middle-income countries like those in South Asia, where it contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Family medicine practitioners are often the first to address these health concerns. This article provides valuable insights into the perceptions and practices around solid biomass fuel use in South Asia, offering healthcare providers crucial information for patient education and health promotion in rural or underserved populations. It explores cultural and behavioral factors that influence biomass fuel use, which can guide primary care physicians in tailoring interventions to promote healthier fuel alternatives and prevent diseases. By emphasizing the growing link between environmental factors and health outcomes, this systematic review contributes to the understanding of environmental health, a key area for primary care providers in addressing chronic diseases. Conclusion and Recommendations The scoping review provides valuable insights into the under-researched area of user perceptions regarding solid fuel utilization for lighting, heating, and cooking in South Asia. It identified a research gap, noting that prior studies have primarily focused on interventions with Improved Cookstoves (ICS), neglecting to explore user perceptions of traditional open fires or basic cookstoves. This review addresses this gap by bringing together the perspectives of solid fuel users across South Asian countries, particularly regarding the consumption and collection of solid fuels, and underscores the value and viability of investigating user perceptions regarding solid fuel use. By understanding these perceptions through a social-ecological lens, policymakers and researchers can develop more effective interventions that address the social and cultural as well as the technical components of fuel usage and environmental factors influencing household behavior. The review emphasizes the need for further community-based research to comprehend the lived experiences more fully and the complexities surrounding solid fuel use in various contexts. This includes delving into Gendered Decision-Making; the intricacies of how gender roles influence household decision-making around fuel choices and cooking practices and Sociocultural Influences; and the role of food-related customs and traditions in shaping user perceptions and practices. Future interventions aimed at promoting cleaner fuel transitions or mitigating the health and environmental impacts of solid fuel use must consider the user’s perspective. This necessitates incorporating an understanding of user perceptions into intervention design and implementation. Interventions should be designed with a nuanced understanding of the complex gendered and social dynamics within households. By acknowledging and addressing these dynamics, interventions can be more effective in establishing the necessary “connections” and bridging the various “disconnects” identified in this review. By implementing these recommendations, future research and interventions can contribute to a more holistic and user-centered approach to addressing the challenges associated with solid fuel use in South Asia. In the end, this may result in the creation of more sustainable and equitable solutions for promoting cleaner and healthier cooking practices in the region.
