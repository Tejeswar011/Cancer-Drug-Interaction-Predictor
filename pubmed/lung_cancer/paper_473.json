We observed a trend of temporal control of DUSP6 expression with disease progression, although the results were not statistically significant (Fig. 2 35 36 S1  Fig. 2 DUSP6 A N N N B C in situ DUSP6 D DUSP6 E DUSP6 F 35 G H I J DUSP6 KRT19 35 P P P P PDAC has a highly complex microenvironment and is mainly composed of dense fibroinflammatory stroma consisting predominantly of activated stromal fibroblasts and immunosuppressive immune cell types.

We demonstrated that DUSP6 inhibition has cell-specific effects on migratory potential while simultaneously inducing glycolysis in PDAC cells. However, we were unable to establish a direct correlation between the two processes.

Briefly, 2-4 × 10 4 3 Lactate assay For lactate measurement, 2.5 × 10 4 g Statistical analysis Sample sizes were chosen to achieve a minimum of triplicate samples for all the experiments. For the assessment of statistical significance between two groups, Welch’s t-test was used for parametric data, while Mann-Whitne test was used for non-parametric data. For comparison across multiple groups, Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA test or mixed-effects analysis with Šídák’s multiple comparisons test were used when appropriate for parametric data; for non-parametric data, Kruskal-Wallis test was performed. Data normality was determined based on Q-Q plots distribution. All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software (RRID: SCR_002798, link), and the results were considered significant at α = 0.05. * P P P P Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
