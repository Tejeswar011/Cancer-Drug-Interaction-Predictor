Introduction Polycythemia vera (PV) is a complex myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by the clonal and autonomous proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in the pathological expansion of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic lineages. The hallmark feature of PV is increased erythropoiesis, resulting in elevated red blood cell mass, often accompanied by leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. The molecular pathogenesis of PV is predominantly driven by somatic mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene. The JAK2 V617F point mutation is identified in approximately 95% of patients, whereas activating mutations in exon 12 of JAK2 account for most of the remaining cases [ 1 Constitutive activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway resulting from these somatic mutations fundamentally alters cellular homeostasis and promotes aberrant hematopoietic proliferation. This molecular dysregulation is characterized by erythropoietin-independent erythroid colony formation and heightened sensitivity to hematopoietic growth factors, reflecting the loss of normal cytokine signaling pathways. The clinical manifestations of PV include thrombotic complications, microvascular disturbances, and the risk of progression to post-polycythemic myelofibrosis or secondary acute myeloid leukemia. Accordingly, early and accurate diagnosis of PV is critical, not only for risk stratification but also for timely therapeutic intervention to mitigate disease-related complications and improve long-term outcomes [ 1 2 A persistent challenge in clinical practice is differentiating PV from secondary polycythemia (SP), a reactive condition arising from physiological or pathological elevations in erythropoietin (EPO) levels. SP may arise from chronic hypoxic states, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and erythropoietin-secreting neoplasms. Despite the integration of serum erythropoietin measurements, bone marrow histopathology, and molecular testing for JAK2 mutations into current diagnostic algorithms, the substantial overlap in clinical features and laboratory findings between PV and SP often complicates accurate diagnosis [ 3 Recent advances in high-throughput molecular technologies have significantly enhanced our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of various diseases. Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful approach for characterizing the complex biochemical alterations associated with various pathological states. Metabolomics provides valuable insights into both physiological processes and disease-associated biochemical alterations by enabling the comprehensive profiling of low-molecular-weight metabolites in biological samples [ 4 5 The application of metabolomics to hematological malignancies has revealed that metabolic reprogramming is a fundamental hallmark of disease progression. Malignant hematopoietic cells undergo profound alterations in their metabolic profiles, reflecting the increased energetic and biosynthetic demands associated with their uncontrolled proliferation. These shifts often manifest as distinct metabolic signatures that can serve as biomarkers of disease states and therapeutic responses. In the context of MPNs, previous studies have reported significant disruptions in central carbon metabolism, including enhanced glycolytic flux, increased glutaminolysis, and altered fatty acid oxidation pathways [ 6 7 8 The dysregulation of cellular metabolism observed in PV extends beyond the metabolic demands of increased cellular proliferation and may play an active role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Understanding these metabolic alterations may reveal novel therapeutic targets and prognostic indicators of PV. Recent evidence suggests that metabolic reprogramming within hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells significantly influences their self-renewal capacity, differentiation potential, and resistance to conventional therapies [ 9 In this context, the present study aimed to elucidate the unique metabolic landscape of PV using comprehensive metabolomic profiling. By comparing metabolic signatures across PV and SP, we aimed to identify disease-specific metabolic patterns that may inform future diagnostic algorithms and guide targeted therapeutic interventions. This study represents an important step towards integrating metabolomic tools into the clinical management of PV and related myeloproliferative disorders. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population This prospective observational study was conducted between January 2024 and March 2025. The study included adult patients (≥18 years of age) who were diagnosed with PV or SP and were followed up at the hematology outpatient clinic. A total of 65 patients were included in the study, comprising 25 with SP and 40 with PV. A subgroup was conducted among patients with PV to compare those receiving treatment (tPV) ( n n PV patients were excluded if they had a history of other hematologic malignancies, active infections, pregnancy, hemoglobinopathy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, BMI > 30, severe hepatic or renal dysfunction, or any other significant comorbidities that could potentially confound the metabolomic analyses. As secondary polycythemia encompasses a wide range of clinical entities that may markedly impact the metabolic profile, we confined our study to a well-defined and carefully selected subgroup of patients. The secondary polycythemia (control) group comprised individuals negative for both JAK2 V617F and JAK2 exon 12 mutations, with normal or slightly elevated serum EPO levels, hematocrit (Hct) values >50%, <65%. Bone marrow examination was performed for patients who have normal EPO but high hematocrit levels to exclude MPNs. In the SP group, patient selection was guided by a comprehensive clinical and diagnostic evaluation, including arterial blood gas analysis (to identify methemoglobinemia and high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathies via P 50 In addition to the standard exclusion criteria for the PV group, patients with clinically significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma requiring treatment, congenital or acquired cardiac shunts, known hemoglobinopathies (Hb D, thalassemia, Hb S, or high-oxygen-affinity variants), EPO-secreting tumors, sleep apnea, or obesity (BMI > 30), and thyroid disfunction were excluded. Accordingly, the final SP cohort represented a clinically well-defined and highly selective group, consisting of patients with no identifiable etiology other than smoking, normal or slightly elevated erythropoietin concentrations, preserved or only mildly impaired pulmonary function, and absence of JAK2 V617F and JAK2 exon 12 mutations. To reduce the influence of potential confounding variables on the metabolic profiles, patients in the PV and SP groups were matched primarily based on age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) values. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their enrollment in the study. 2.2. Sample Collection Peripheral blood samples were collected into hemogram tubes containing EDTA following an overnight fast of 8–12 h. After collection, the samples were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at +4 °C, and the plasma supernatant was carefully separated and transferred into clean tubes. These aliquots were stored at −80 °C until further analysis. On the day of analysis, all samples were transported to the laboratory using dry ice to maintain the cold chain and were analyzed. 2.3. Metabolite Extraction Plasma samples were thawed at room temperature, and 0.1 mL of each sample was transferred into a microcentrifuge tube. Subsequently, 0.2 mL of cold methanol: water (9:1, v v v v 2.4. LC/MS Analysis Analyses were performed using a Q-TOF LC/MS system (Agilent Technologies 6530, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Sample injections (10 µL) were carried out using gradient elution on a reversed-phase chromatography column (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.5 µm; XBridge, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The column was maintained at 35 °C, and the autosampler was set to 4 °C. The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min. The mobile phases consisted of (A) water with 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The elution gradient was as follows: 95% A at 0 min, 65% A at 2 min, 5% A at 8 min, returned to 95% A at 10 min, and maintained for 5 min as a post-run. The mass spectrometer operated in negative ionization mode, with a scan range of mass to charge ( m z 2.5. Data Processing Raw chromatographic data were exported in “.mzdata” format and processed using MZmine 2.53 software. Data processing included mass detection, chromatogram deconvolution, peak alignment, isotope grouping, and metabolite identification. Peaks present in extraction blank samples were excluded to eliminate background contaminants. To minimize noise, features with blank/QC signal intensity ratios exceeding 0.3 were removed. From the remaining peaks, those with percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) below 50% across quality control samples were retained to ensure analytical reproducibility. Peak areas were normalized using total peak area normalization. Each peak intensity was divided by the sum of all peak intensities within that sample, then multiplied by the average total intensity across all samples to maintain scale comparability. Metabolite identification followed a tiered approach according to the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) guidelines. Where possible, metabolites were confirmed at confidence Level 1 using our in-house library of authentic standards (Mass Spectrometry Metabolite Library, IROA Technologies, Virginia, USA) through retention time matching and MS/MS fragmentation pattern verification. For metabolites without available standards, putative identification was performed based on accurate mass matching (<5 ppm mass error) with metabolomic databases (HMDB, METLIN) and isotope pattern similarity. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were performed on normalized peak intensities. Univariate statistical analysis identified significantly altered metabolites between groups using Student’s t p 2.6. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS software version 26.0. Continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, whereas categorical data were summarized as frequencies and percentages. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was employed to evaluate the normality of continuous variables, and Levene’s test was used to examine the homogeneity of variances. For variables with a normal distribution, group comparisons were made using Student’s t 3. Results 3.1.

Discussion The current metabolomic analysis revealed that PV and SP possess distinct metabolomic profiles characterized by 67 significantly altered metabolites that differentiate between the two conditions. These findings are consistent with emerging evidence suggesting that metabolic reprogramming is a fundamental characteristic of hematological malignancies that extends beyond the well-established genetic and cellular alterations [ 6 10 11 The metabolic heterogeneity observed between PV and SP is consistent with findings from other malignancy comparisons, in which primary tumors consistently exhibit altered metabolic landscapes compared with reactive conditions [ 12 13 14 4.1. Metabolomic Differentiation Between SP and PV 4.1.1. Central Carbon Metabolism and Energy Production The 4.29-fold elevation of D-glucose in PV patients, alongside increased citric acid (1.91-fold) and succinic acid (2.34-fold), suggests active oxidative metabolism rather than the Warburg effect typically observed in hematological malignancies [ 15 16 17 18 11 This preserved TCA cycle activity in PV contrasts with the predominance of glycolysis in acute leukemias, potentially reflecting slower proliferation kinetics [ 19 20 4.1.2. Amino Acid Metabolism and Cellular Signaling The striking upregulation of 3-sulfinoalanine (13.14-fold) and cysteic acid (6.46-fold) in patients with PV compared to those with SP provides novel biochemical evidence of a distinct oxidative stress signature in PV, directly implicating the characteristic prothrombotic phenotype [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 Furthermore, perturbation of taurine and hypotaurine metabolism offers mechanistic insights into the altered cellular osmoregulation in patients with PV. This aligns with the findings in other cancers, including leukemia, where taurine dysregulation is associated with increased cellular stress and resistance to apoptosis [ 29 30 31 32 4.1.3. Nucleotide Metabolism and Cell Proliferation In PV, the reduction in deoxyuridine (−2.71-fold) and inosine (−1.53-fold) appears paradoxical for a proliferative disease but reflects a metabolic reprogramming strategy seen in hematologic cancers. Evidence shows that malignant cells rewire their nucleotide metabolism to prefer the salvage pathway over de novo synthesis. For instance, Tran et al. (2024) demonstrated that circulating nucleosides like inosine are key to tumor purine pools, and inhibiting their salvage blocks tumor growth in vivo [ 33 Similarly, broader reviews emphasize that successful malignancies depend on upregulated nucleoside transport and salvage enzyme activity to streamline the conversion of extracellular nucleosides into deoxyribonucleotides [ 34 35 Thus, the low extracellular deoxyuridine and inosine in PV likely indicate increased cellular uptake and salvage activity in proliferating cells, rather than nucleotide substrate deficiency. This aligns with the known behavior of malignant hematopoietic and myeloid cells, which often overexpress nucleoside transporters (e.g., ENT1/2, CNTs) and salvage kinases to rapidly recycle nucleosides into DNA precursors [ 36 Furthermore, PV patients exhibited a significant upregulation of inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate (IP3) (3.19-fold), indicating disrupted phosphoinositide signaling. IP3, a crucial second messenger, mediates the release of intracellular calcium [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 4.1.4. Hormonal and Neuroendocrine Perturbations Although thyroid dysfunction was an exclusion criterion in the study, the significant elevation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) (16.72-fold) in PV patients is an unexpected finding, as thyroid dysfunction in hematological malignancies is typically attributed to autoimmune or iatrogenic causes rather than primary neuroendocrine dysregulation [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 Concurrently, the observed downregulation of estriol supports prior epidemiological data, indicating sex-related differences in PV presentation and outcomes [ 49 50 4.1.5. Alterations in Redox-Active Metabolism and Antioxidant Defense Elevated hydrogen selenide levels (VIP = 1.37) in patients with PV suggest altered selenium metabolism, which is crucial for the cellular antioxidant defense mechanism. Hydrogen selenide is vital for selenoprotein biosynthesis, including glutathione peroxidases (GPXs) and thioredoxin reductases, which maintain redox balance and prevent oxidative DNA damage. Oxidative stress is a recognized hallmark of MPNs, with JAK2V617F mutations increasing ROS levels and contributing to genomic instability [ 51 52 53 54 55 56 4.1.6. Impaired Retinoic Acid Metabolism and Megakaryocytic Dysfunction Retinoic acid signaling is crucial for hematopoietic differentiation, with retinoid receptors (RARs and RXRs) regulating the expression of lineage-specific transcription factors. The megakaryocytic program is specifically controlled by transcription factors, such as GATA-1, FOG-1, and NFE2, which synergistically regulate megakaryocyte-specific gene expression [ 57 58 59 60 60 61 Our metabolomic analysis identified a significant downregulation of 4-hydroxyretinoic acid in PV patients compared to SP (−2.62-fold), offering new insight into impaired retinoid signaling in PV. This supports the hypothesis that disrupted retinoid metabolism contributes to characteristic features like thrombocytosis and megakaryocytic hyperplasia. Since RA derivatives inhibit JAK2, STAT3, and STAT5 phosphorylation [ 62 63 4.2. Impact of Cytoreductive Therapy on Metabolic Profiles 4.2.1. Therapeutic Normalization of Glucose Metabolism Our observation of restored glucose metabolism in patients with PV following cytoreductive therapy represents a novel and potentially significant systemic treatment effect. While previous studies have highlighted the cardiovascular benefits of cytoreductive therapy, particularly hydroxyurea, in reducing thrombosis and inflammation in PV, its metabolic implications have largely remained unexplored [ 64 65 This study offers the first clinical metabolomic-based evidence that cytoreductive therapy can normalize dysregulated glucose metabolism in hematologic malignancies. This is highly relevant, as JAK2-driven PV models demonstrated profound metabolic dysregulation, including hypoglycemia and cachexia, supporting the concept that these malignancies exhibit metabolic alterations that may be therapeutically targeted [ 66 This finding contrasts with the patterns observed in solid tumors, where cytoreductive or cytotoxic therapies often fail to reverse cancer-associated metabolic reprogramming [ 67 68 69 70 4.2.2. B-Vitamin Metabolism and Co-Factor Availability A significant downregulation of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD) (−6.37-fold) and upregulation of nicotinamide ribotide (3.39-fold) in untreated PV patients indicated dysregulated niacin (vitamin B3) metabolism and NAD+ biosynthesis. Reduced NAAD suggests impaired de novo NAD+ synthesis through the kynurenine pathway, further supported by decreased L-3-hydroxykynurenine (−3.25-fold), a key intermediate in tryptophan-to-NAD+ conversion [ 71 NAD+ is a vital cofactor for energy metabolism (glycolysis, fatty acid oxidation, TCA cycle) [ 72 73 The substantial downregulation of phosphoribosyl formamidocarboxamide (−10.06-fold, VIP = 1.40) suggests impaired folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism, which is essential for purine synthesis and DNA methylation [ 74 This finding, combined with altered B-vitamin cofactor availability, indicates widespread metabolic reprogramming that affects nucleotide biosynthesis and epigenetic regulation in PV pathogenesis. These B-vitamin metabolic alterations may serve as early biomarkers for disease progression and suggest potential therapeutic targets for early-stage PV management through targeted vitamin supplementation strategies. Our data point to a significant dysregulation in the NAD+ biosynthetic pathway, a key component of B-vitamin metabolism, particularly in untreated PV patients. However, we contend that it is premature to recommend supplementation trials; instead, future studies should focus on mechanistic research to determine if this pathway represents a viable therapeutic target. 4.2.3. Lipid Metabolism and Cellular Membrane Composition The elevation of octanoyl-CoA (4.51-fold) in ntPV patients provides evidence of altered fatty acid metabolism in PV, extending previous observations of dyslipidemia in MPNs [ 75 4.3. Shared Metabolic Pathways and Disease Mechanisms 4.3.1. Glutamate Metabolism The consistent enrichment of glutamate metabolism across multiple comparisons identified this pathway as a central metabolic node in the pathogenesis of PV. These findings support recent studies demonstrating that glutamine addiction represents a metabolic vulnerability in hematological malignancies [ 76 77 The centrality of glutamate metabolism in our analysis is consistent with its role in maintaining cellular redox balance through glutathione synthesis, which is particularly relevant given the oxidative stress signature observed. This metabolic phenotype differs from that of solid tumors, where glutamine metabolism primarily supports biomass production rather than antioxidant defense [ 78 4.3.2. Purine Metabolism and DNA Synthesis The enrichment of purine metabolism ( p 79 80 81 82 4.4. Clinical Implications and Diagnostic Potential 4.4.1. Biomarker Development The distinct metabolic signatures identified in this study provide a foundation for developing clinically applicable diagnostic biomarkers. The Variable Importance in Projection analysis identified specific metabolites with high discriminatory power, including deoxyuridine (VIP: 1.71) and IP3 (VIP: 1.28), which could be incorporated into targeted metabolomic panels. These findings complement recent studies developing metabolomic diagnostic approaches for other hematological malignancies [ 83 84 85 The diagnostic potential of metabolomic profiling is particularly relevant, given the ongoing challenges in distinguishing PV from secondary causes of polycythemia. Our metabolic signature approach may provide complementary information to existing molecular diagnostic methods, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing the time to diagnosis. 4.4.2. Therapeutic Target Identification The metabolic perturbations identified in this study reveal potential therapeutic vulnerabilities that extend beyond the traditional cytoreductive approaches. The oxidative stress signature suggests that antioxidant interventions may provide therapeutic benefits, consistent with recent clinical trials examining antioxidant supplementation in MPNs. Similarly, B-vitamin pathway perturbations indicate potential therapeutic opportunities for cofactor supplementation. The metabolic normalization observed following cytoreductive therapy validates current therapeutic approaches and provides mechanistic insights into the benefits of treatment. These findings support early therapeutic interventions to prevent metabolic complications, consistent with current clinical guidelines emphasizing prompt treatment initiation. 4.5. Study Limitations Several limitations should be acknowledged when interpreting these results. The cross-sectional study design limits the assessment of temporal metabolic changes and their relationship with disease progression. Additionally, the heterogeneity in treatment regimens among treated patients may have introduced confounding variables affecting metabolic profiles. Notably, the stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria for the SP cohort, while necessary to create a metabolically uniform comparison group, may limit the generalizability of our findings and may not capture the full metabolic diversity of SP. This approach intentionally reduced the heterogeneity typical of SP cases seen in clinical practice. Therefore, the metabolic distinctions identified may be most applicable to a specific subset of the SP population rather than its entire spectrum. Future studies incorporating more heterogeneous SP etiologies will be essential to validate whether the identified metabolic signatures consistently distinguish PV from various SP subtypes. Second, in our subgroup analysis, the treated PV patients were significantly older than the untreated group. This age imbalance is an inherent consequence of current treatment guidelines, which often recommend cytoreductive therapy for older patients. We did not adjust for age due to sample size, so age-related metabolic changes are a potential confounder. These findings require cautious interpretation pending future studies with age-matched or statistically adjusted cohorts. Polycytemia without an identifiable etiology, evaluation of erythrocyte 2,3-DPG levels, bisphosphoglycerate mutase deficiency, and oxygen-sensing pathway gene mutations (EpoR, VHL, PHD2) were not possible due to technical limitations. Metabolite identification represents another important limitation; while a subset of metabolites was confirmed at MSI Level 1 using authentic standards and MS/MS fragmentation, many metabolites remain at Level 2 (putative annotation based on accurate mass and database matching). Although not all metabolites achieved Level 1 confirmation, the consistency of pathway enrichment patterns and the validity of relative quantification support the biological relevance of the observed metabolic differences between PV and SP. Overall, we view this study as hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing. The identified metabolic signatures require validation in independent cohorts with appropriate multiple testing corrections, and such confirmatory efforts will be essential before any clinical application. 5. Conclusions This comprehensive metabolomic analysis revealed that PV and SP exhibit fundamentally different metabolic landscapes, reflecting distinct disease mechanisms. The identification of specific metabolic signatures provides new insights into PV pathogenesis and offers potential avenues for improved diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. The normalization of metabolic profiles following cytoreductive therapy validates current treatment approaches, revealing the broader systemic effects of therapeutic interventions. These findings advance our understanding of the metabolic basis of MPN and provide a foundation for developing metabolically targeted therapeutic strategies. The integration of metabolomics into clinical practice may ultimately improve outcomes for patients with polycythemia through enhanced diagnostic accuracy, risk stratification, and personalized treatment approaches.
