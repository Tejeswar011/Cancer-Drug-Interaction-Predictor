Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is clinically classified as an advanced-stage malignancy, characterized by therapeutic resistance and substantially diminished survival outcomes. The 5-year survival rate for mCRC is significantly lower than that for early-stage CRC. A multi-dimensional computational framework was implemented to dissect CRC transcriptomics. Gene expression profiles were systematically acquired from TCGA and GEO repositories. A series of data were then analyzed using ssGSEA algorithm, xCell algorithm, edgeR, limma, DAVID enrichment analysis, CytoHubba, ROC logistic regression and correlation analysis. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed 7 tumor-infiltrating immune cell subtypes exhibiting significant abundance disparities between metastatic and non-metastatic colorectal cancer cohorts. Further integrative analysis identified 28 immune-related metastatic colorectal cancer differentially expressed genes (ICDEGs) in metastatic lesions. Through comprehensive analysis, 9 pivotal hub genes ( AGTR1 CD86 CMKLR1 FGF1 FYN IL10RA INHBA TNFSF13B VEGFC AGTR1 CD86 CMKLR1 TNFSF13B TNFSF13B CD86 IL10RA Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-18589-4.

Early detection and intervention have been demonstrated to substantially enhance survival outcomes and significantly improve prognostic indicators in CRC patients 6 7 8 9 10 LINC01705 SERPINE1 11 LINC01614 SPP1 12 11 12 ANO7 SLC38A4 13 14 Inflammatory cells significantly contribute to both tumor initiation and progression, while adaptive immune mechanisms are crucial in controlling neoplastic expansion and metastasis. The development and advancement of CRC are fundamentally regulated by complex tumor-host interactions within the specialized tumor microenvironment. Recent research has progressively elucidated the multifaceted roles of immune cells in CRC pathogenesis, with particular scientific focus on their involvement in tumor promotion, immunological surveillance, and the intricate dynamics of immune evasion mechanisms 15 16 17 This investigation marks the first application of the xCell algorithm to comparatively analyze immune infiltration patterns between CRC and mCRC. Subsequently, we implemented an integrated bioinformatics pipeline to identify and characterize DEGs associated with CRC progression to metastasis.

The investigation involved systematic screening of TCGA-CRC and GEO databases to identify immune-related differentially expressed genes.

( A B C D Discussion mCRC represents a highly aggressive malignancy whose development is intricately associated with multiple factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental determinants, and alterations in the TME 53 54 55 56 57 Collective significance of altered immune and stromal populations The integrated immune deconvolution using both ssGSEA and xCell revealed a profoundly remodeled TME in mCRC. The enrichment of endothelial cells and lymphatic endothelial cells populations underscores the critical role of neovascularization in supporting metastatic growth and dissemination. The significant increase in neutrophils points towards a dominant pro-tumorigenic, immunosuppressive inflammation within the mCRC TME 58 59 60 61 62 Mechanistic roles of hub genes in metastasis and TME remodeling To identify more robust diagnostic biomarkers, we systematically screened 2599 and 2005 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 28 immune-related DEGs (ICDEGs), from CRC and mCRC samples in the TCGA and GEO databases, respectively. Functional enrichment analyses through GO and KEGG pathways revealed that these ICDEGs were predominantly associated with immune responses, suggesting their potential involvement in immune cell regulation.

Firstly, it represents the first application of the xCell algorithm to comparatively analyze immune infiltration patterns specifically between primary CRC and mCRC, providing novel insights into the evolving tumor immune microenvironment during metastasis. Secondly, we employed a robust, multi-dimensional bioinformatics framework integrating data from multiple independent datasets (TCGA-CRC, GSE33113 GSE26906 GSE41568 AGTR1 CD86 CMKLR1 FGF1 FYN IL10RA INHBA TNFSF13B VEGFC AGTR1 CD86 CMKLR1 TNFSF13B TNFSF13B CD86 IL10RA However, several limitations warrant consideration. Primarily, the retrospective nature of this investigation, relying on publicly available datasets, necessitates validation in prospective clinical cohorts with larger sample sizes and more detailed clinical annotations to substantiate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of the identified biomarkers. Secondly, while we identified key genes and correlations, the upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms governing the expression and function of these nine hub genes, as well as their precise interactions with the infiltrating immune cells, require further comprehensive molecular and cellular exploration. Lastly, extensive in vivo and in vitro experimentation, encompassing human sample analyses and animal model studies, should be conducted prior to clinical translation of these findings. Despite these limitations, this investigation provides comprehensive insights into the distinct immune infiltration landscape of mCRC and identifies 9 potential diagnostic biomarkers. The significant associations established between these biomarkers, suggesting their interplay may play a pivotal role in mCRC progression by modulating immune responses. Collectively, this study offers novel perspectives on the immunoregulatory mechanisms underlying mCRC and establishes new avenues for future diagnostic and therapeutic research in this field.
