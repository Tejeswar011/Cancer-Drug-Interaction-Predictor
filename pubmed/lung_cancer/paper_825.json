While digital technologies like wearable devices and mobile applications have been widely adopted, large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are emerging as promising technologies with the potential to enhance chronic disease management. However, the scope of their current applications in chronic disease management and associated challenges remains underexplored. Objective This scoping review investigates LLM applications in chronic disease management, identifies challenges, and proposes actionable recommendations. Methods A systematic search for English-language primary studies on LLM use in chronic disease management was conducted across PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Google Scholar to identify articles published between January 1, 2023, and January 15, 2025. Of the 605 screened records, 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. Data on study objectives, LLMs used, health care settings, study designs, users, disease management tasks, and challenges were extracted and thematically analyzed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Results LLMs were primarily used for patient-centered tasks, including patient education and information provision (18/29, 62%) of studies, diagnosis and treatment (6/29, 21%), self-management and disease monitoring (8/29, 28%), and emotional support and therapeutic conversations (4/29, 14%). Practitioner-centered tasks included clinical decision support (8/29, 28%) and medical predictions (6/29, 21%). Challenges identified include inaccurate and inconsistent LLM responses (18/29, 62%), limited datasets (6/29, 21%), computational and technical (6/29, 21%), usability and accessibility (9/29, 31%), LLM evaluation (5/29, 17%), and legal, ethical, privacy, and regulatory (10/29, 35%). While models like ChatGPT, Llama, and Bard demonstrated use in diabetes management and mental health support, performance issues were evident across studies and use cases. Conclusions LLMs show promising potential for enhancing chronic disease management across patient and practitioner-centered tasks. However, challenges related to accuracy, data scarcity, usability, and ethical concerns must be addressed to ensure patient safety and equitable use. Future studies should prioritize the integration of LLMs with low-resource platforms, wearable and mobile technologies, developing culturally and age-appropriate interfaces, and establishing robust regulatory and evaluation frameworks to support safe, effective, and inclusive use in health care.

Inaccurate Data and Inconsistencies in Responses Inaccurate and inconsistent responses emerged as a significant challenge (18/29, 62%), primarily due to poor data quality, inherent biases in training datasets, and the limited scope of knowledge constrained by the model’s training cutoff [ 6 22 23 31 54-56 54-56 57-59 8 12 60 61 22 50-52 undefined undefined 62-64 Limited Datasets The scarcity of high-quality datasets for chronic diseases accounted for (6/29, 21%). Studies highlighted limitations and narrow coverage of publicly accessible clinical training datasets due to data privacy and institutional restrictions [ 16 19 21-23 39 undefined undefined 15 65 54-56 66 Computational Resources and Technical Challenges The computational demands of training LLMs for health care applications remain a significant challenge (6/29, 21%). Consequently, low computing resources approaches, such as quantization, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), Quantized LoRA (QLORA), Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation, and REFT [ 67-73 74 75 76 Usability and Accessibility Concerns Usability and accessibility concerns accounted for (9/29, 31%), including issues with text-only interfaces for some LLMs, cultural misalignments, and outputs ill-suited for pediatric or elderly populations [ 18 28 40 28 40 31 77-79 undefined undefined Legal, Ethical Issues, and Regulatory Issues Legal, ethical, and regulatory concerns (10/29, 35%) remain a key issue in LLM adoption in health care. Studies identified data privacy, biases, misinformation, responsibility, and accountability for LLM-generated content as key concerns. Although several AI frameworks have been proposed, the absence of standardized guidelines and regulatory approvals creates significant gaps [ 27 80-82 undefined undefined 27 83 84 LLM Evaluation Evaluation gaps accounted for (5/29, 17%), reflecting critical shortcomings in current methodologies for assessing LLM performance in clinical contexts. The existing automated evaluation metrics mainly focus on predictive performance using metrics such as accuracy and F 1 22 85 85 30 85 Table 3 Table 3. Key challenges and recommendations.

Limitations of the Study Although quality assessment was conducted using MMAT, studies were not excluded based on their methodological rigor. As a result, including moderate and low-quality studies may have influenced the reliability and consistency of the reviewer’s findings. The varied methodological designs across studies may have affected the interpretation of results and conclusions drawn. Furthermore, the review was limited to only English-language publications, which may have introduced language bias and limited the generalizability of our findings, particularly in contexts where LLMs are being adapted to local languages or integrated into culturally specific health care practices. The exclusion of databases such as Embase and Web of Science may have limited the comprehensiveness of the search. Future research can consider broader database coverage and non-English sources to enhance diversity and scope. Implications for Practice and Future Research This scoping review reveals several critical implications for the integration of LLMs in chronic disease management. First, it is essential to address the accuracy issues identified in 18/29, 62% of studies. This calls for both technical solutions (domain-specific fine-tuning, reinforcement learning (RL), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks [ 61 64 40 76 Finally, future research should focus on multimodal LLMs that can synthesize diverse data inputs from wearable devices and mobile health applications for holistic patient monitoring [ 19 31 35 Conclusion This scoping review highlights the growing potential of LLMs in supporting chronic disease management through patient education, diagnosis and treatment, emotional support, self-management support, decision support, and prediction tasks. While LLMs offer promising capabilities, their effective integration into health care still requires addressing key challenges related to accuracy, accessibility, usability, and ethical and privacy concerns. Future research should focus on integrating LLMs with mobile and wearable technologies, creating culturally and age-appropriate interfaces, and exploring integration with low-resource platforms. Addressing these research gaps will ensure equitable and safe use of LLMs across diverse health care settings.
