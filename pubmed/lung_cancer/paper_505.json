Background Up until now, no clear consensus has been reached on the role of serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) levels in predicting survival in patients with lung cancer. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the prognostic value of serum KL-6 levels before treatment in lung cancer. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies from inception to June 23, 2025. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024568549). Results Thirteen studies involving 1,723 patients were included in this meta-analysis. High serum KL-6 levels before treatment were associated with shorter progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 1.89, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: 1.46–2.44, P<0.001; heterogeneity: I²=6.5%, P = 0.37) and overall survival (OS) (HR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.37–2.26, P<0.001; heterogeneity: I²=51.9%, P = 0.023). Subgroup analysis revealed the significant value of elevated KL-6 level for predicting OS of patients with lung cancer without interstitial lung disease (ILD) but not for those with ILD. The pooled results indicated that OS and progression-free survival were shortened when serum KL-6 level exceeded 500 U/mL. The serum KL-6 level determined using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay had a greater predictive value for OS than that determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in this study. Conclusion Elevated serum KL-6 levels (>500 U/mL) before treatment represent a biomarker for poor prognosis of lung cancer for Asian patients without ILD. However, in patients with pre-existing ILD, these elevated levels are more likely to indicate the severity and activity of the underlying fibrotic lung disease rather than providing independent prognostic information about the cancer itself. Electrochemiluminescence immunoassay was recommended for determining the serum KL-6 level.

( 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Literature search The articles we included in the study adhered to the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting checklist. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024568549). Two investigators (Hong Huang and Chenye Feng) independently searched for relevant articles on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase published up to June 23, 2025. The search terms included (“KL-6” or “Krebs von den Lungen-6” or “MUC-1” or “mucin-1”) and (“lung cancer” or “lung carcinoma”) (  Supplementary Table S1 2.2 Selection criteria The articles that met the following criteria were included: (a) primary research enrolling patients with lung cancer and (b) studies evaluating the independent prognostic value of circulating KL-6 levels before treatment for patient survival. Meta-analyses, reviews, and case reports were excluded. The two reviewers independently screened and assessed the studies, and differences in opinion were resolved through discussion. 2.3 Data collection Hong Huang and Liangyu Fu independently extracted the following data using a standard form: population characteristics, study design, treatment regimens, statistical model, data on outcomes, and other research details. Wei Wang was consulted to resolve the disagreements. We contacted the corresponding authors to obtain the missing data when necessary. 2.4 Quality assessment Hong Huang and Liangyu Fu independently performed the quality assessment and discussed the inconsistencies with Wei Wang, who made the final decision. Quality assessment was performed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool ( 11 2.5 Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using Stata version 15.0. We calculated the pooled hazard ratio (HR) for KL-6 level and patient survival. The multivariate-adjusted HRs were extracted for studies that reported both univariate and multivariate results using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. For studies that did not report hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) directly, these values were estimated from Kaplan–Meier survival curves using the method described by Tierney et al. ( 12 2 2 13 14 15 3 Results 3.1 Study identification and study characteristics A total of 1,735 articles were retrieved. After removing 444 duplicate records, 1,271 studies were excluded based on their titles and abstracts. Eight articles were excluded after careful reading of the full texts. Two studies were excluded because the KL-6 level was not measured before treatment ( 16 17 18 19 20 21 23 24 7 8 24 33  Figure 1 Figure 1 The protocol for searching and selecting studies. CA153, carbohydrate antigen 153; MUC1, mucin 1; KL-6, krebs von den Lungen-6. Flowchart detailing the selection process for a review. Initially, 1,734 records were identified through database searching and reference lists. After removing 444 duplicates, 1,291 records were screened. From these, 1,271 were excluded based on title and abstract. Twenty full-text articles were assessed, with 8 excluded for reasons such as improper measurement of KL-6, irrelevant data, or measuring other biomarkers. One article provided data for two populations. Thirteen studies were included in the review.

The results showed that the patients with elevated KL-6 expression before treatment had shorter PFS than those with normal levels (HR, 1.89, 95% CI: 1.46–2.44, P < 0.001; heterogeneity: I 2  Figure 2A  Figure 3A Figure 2 Forest plot of the predictive value of KL-6 in (A) (B) Panel A displays a forest plot showing the hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for five studies, with weights from a random-effects model. The overall HR is 1.89. Panel B shows a similar forest plot for twelve studies, resulting in an overall HR of 1.76. Both panels illustrate studies’ HRs on a logarithmic scale, with each study's weight varying, indicated as percentages. Figure 3 Forest plot of subgroup analysis in (A) (B) Forest plots display hazard ratios with confidence intervals for various subgroups in two panels, A and B. Panel A shows data by cut-off values and treatments with sample sizes and studies. Panel B includes study design, comorbidity, assay method, cut-off values, and treatment regimen details. Hazard ratios and confidence intervals are aligned horizontally with a reference line at one. The plots indicate statistical significance and heterogeneity through I-squared and p-values. 3.3 KL-6 and OS Twelve studies involving 1,519 patients focused on the predictive value of KL-6 level for OS. The study by Kikuchi et al. evaluating the effect of per U/mL increment in KL-6 level on survival found that it was not a prognostic factor for NSCLC (HR 1.00, 95% CI: 0.99–1.00, P = 0.564). The remaining 11 studies statistically analyzed KL-6 level as a dichotomous variable. The pooled results indicated that higher KL-6 expression was associated with shorter OS (HR 1.76, 95% CI: 1.37–2.26, P < 0.001) (  Figure 2B The results of the subgroup analyses based on studies that analyzed KL-6 as a dichotomous variable are as follows (  Figure 3B 3.4 Heterogeneity analysis and sensitivity analysis Statistically significant heterogeneity was found in OS (I²=51.9%, P = 0.023) (  Figure 2B  Figure 3B 24 26 27  Supplementary Figure S1  Supplementary Figure S2  Figure 4 Figure 4 Sensitivity analysis of the predictive value KL-6 in (A) (B) Panel A and B show meta-analysis estimates with individual studies omitted. Panel A lists five studies from Tanaka 2012 to Nakahama 2023, with estimates around 1.89. Panel B includes eleven studies, from Tanaka 2012 to Tomita 2016, with estimates centered around 1.76. Each plot displays lower and upper confidence interval limits. 3.5 Publication bias No significant publication bias was observed in the studies on OS (P = 0.07) (  Figure 5B  Figure 5A  Supplementary Figure S3  Supplementary Table S3 Figure 5 Funnel plots for studies on (A) (B) Two funnel plots labeled A and B show pseudo 95% confidence limits.

Both plots analyze standard error of HR against HR. 4 Discussion Previous meta-analyses have reported the predictive role of serum cytokeratin 19 fragment concentrations for the prognosis of lung cancer based on serological biomarkers, but only for NSCLC ( 34 35 MUC1, an oncogenic molecule, promotes the occurrence, development, and metastasis of lung cancer through multiple mechanisms ( 36 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 7 27 The results of the subgroup analysis showed that the KL-6 level determined using the ECLIA test was more predictive of OS for lung cancer than that determined using the ELISA method. The original data for KL-6 were not provided in the included studies. Therefore, we were unable to perform direct comparisons or consistency analyses between the two detection methods. No study has reported direct comparisons of ELISA and ECLIA for KL-6 measurement. However, previous studies have reported that ECLIA has superior diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and concordance rates to those of ELISA in detecting viral antibodies ( 45 47 Most of the included studies used a cut-off value of 500 U/mL for KL-6 level, whereas Han et al. ( 31 7 28 Serum KL-6 levels were elevated in patients with ILD relative to those without; this was especially observed among patients with ILD who had disease progression and poor prognosis ( 9 48 49 50 51 52 53 24 32 31 Park et al. ( 28 54 We explored potential sources of variation to ensure the reliability of the findings based on the significant heterogeneity observed in the OS results. Subgroup analyses stratified by comorbidities, KL-6 detection methodologies, and lung cancer treatment regimens failed to identify significant sources of heterogeneity. The Galbraith plot showed that the studies by Miyazaki 2 ( 24 26 27 28 30 24 Some limitations of our study should be highlighted. First, most of the enrolled studies were retrospective. However, the quality assessments of the included studies were acceptable, and the pooled results were positive. Prospective cohort studies are needed for clinical verification in the future. Second, the samples in the study were all from Asian individuals, and the recommendation of a cut-off value of 500 U/mL was derived exclusively from cohorts of Asian individuals. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated significant ethnic variations in KL-6/MUC1 expression levels ( 55 57 58 59 28 The elevated KL-6 level before treatment was a biomarker of poor prognosis of patients with lung cancer without ILD in the Asian population. ECLIA may be a more sensitive method for detecting the prognostic value of KL-6. This hypothesis warrants confirmation in direct head-to-head comparative studies. The cut-off value of approximately 500 U/mL is frequently used and associated with poor prognosis in Asian patients with lung cancer. However, it requires rigorous validation in large, prospective, multi-ethnic cohorts before it can be considered for broad clinical application, especially given the known genetic variations that affect baseline KL-6 levels. For patients with lung cancer and ILD, serum KL-6 levels >500 U/mL is more likely to indicate the severity and activity of the underlying fibrotic lung disease rather than providing independent prognostic information about the cancer itself, further investigation is still required to validate that whether KL-6 is a cancer-specific predictive biomarker for these population and what is an optimal cut-off value.
