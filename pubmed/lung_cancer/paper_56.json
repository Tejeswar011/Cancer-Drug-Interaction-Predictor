Research has highlighted that females may be less likely to achieve treatment targets and are more prone to discontinuing therapy, though data on sex-specific adverse events is limited. This analysis investigates sex differences in treatment outcomes, persistence, discontinuation reasons, and adverse events during first-line b/tsDMARD therapy. Methods In this analysis bionaïve patients with PsA from the RABBIT-SpA register were included at the start of their first b/tsDMARD. Therapy persistence was estimated using the Cox-regression adjusted for age. Descriptive analyses were used to examine and compare sex–specific differences on reasons for therapy discontinuation. Results A total of 457 female patients and 343 male patients were included. Females exhibited more severe joint involvement and poorer patient-reported parameters, such as higher disease activity, more pain, and greater functional limitations. In contrast, males showed more pronounced skin involvement and a higher prevalence of nail psoriasis. Females had lower treatment persistence rates, both in the overall analysis of all first-line b/tsDMARDs and in subgroup analyses restricted to TNFi and IL17i therapies. At 12 months, 52% of females and 68% of males remained on their initial b/tsDMARD therapy. Notable sex differences were also observed in the reasons for therapy discontinuation: males more frequently discontinued due to lack of efficacy or remission, while females more often stopped treatment due to adverse events. Our safety analysis indicated that although female patients experienced a greater number of overall adverse events, males reported serious adverse events at twice the rate. Conclusions Our findings underscore the need for sex-specific treatment strategies and more comprehensive research into biological and sociocultural factors influencing therapy persistence and reasons for discontinuation in real-world settings. Tailored treatment strategies are needed with regard to biologic therapy to overcome worse therapeutic outcomes in female patients with PsA. Clinical trial number Not applicable.

The primary treatment objective is to achieve remission or at least minimal disease activity (MDA), aiming to prevent further joint damage and enhance patients’ overall well-being. The current EULAR (European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology) recommendations stress the importance of a tailored treatment strategy, taking into account individual patients’ needs, comorbidities and preferences. To optimize individualized therapy, it is essential to recognize the influence of sex on these factors. Accordingly, research on the effect of sex on treatment choices, treatment efficacy, and treatment maintenance was prioritized in the recommendations for future research in PsA [ 7 Current studies suggest that male sex may have a favorable impact on therapy persistence and outcome, with females less likely to achieve MDA [ 7 9 The most common reasons for early therapy discontinuation in longitudinal observational studies include remission, lack of efficacy, and serious and non-serious adverse events (SAEs and AE) [ 10 11 12 The objectives of our analyses were to examine sex-specific differences in clinical parameters and first-line therapy persistence, as well as reasons for discontinuation. Additionally, we provide sex-stratified data on frequencies of SAEs and AEs occurring during the first-line b/tsDMARD therapy and leading to discontinuation. Patients and methods Data source The RABBIT-SpA register is a German longitudinal observational cohort study focused on monitoring and evaluating the safety and effectiveness of b/tsDMARDs in patients with PsA in a real-world setting. Patients can be included by a rheumatologist with the start of a new b/tsDMARD or with a conventional systemic treatment e.g. csDMARD or NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) [ 13 14 Patients All PsA patients enrolled between October 2017 and database closure in March 2024 were included. For these analyses, only b/tsDMARD-naïve patients with PsA who initiated their first-line b/tsDMARD and who have a follow-up time of at least one year were selected (Supplementary Figure S1 In our register, sex was reported as “female”, “male”, or “other”. Since no patient’s sex was reported as “other”, this study only refers to female and male patients. While the distinction between sex and gender is well established in the social sciences, it remains a complex and evolving issue in medical research [ 15 Statistical analyses and variables Definition of variables Characteristics at the beginning of first-line therapy of female and male participants were compared using appropriate descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations, and percentages. The physician eCRF contains data on treatment history and the current disease activity status and treatment regimen. Physicians record the onset of symptoms and the time of diagnosis. Disease duration is calculated in years since diagnosis, while diagnostic delay represents the time in years between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. Additional clinical parameters reported by the physician include dactylitis, axial involvement, and nail psoriasis, which are assessed using a binary yes or no response, enthesitis (SPARCC score including 16 entheses), swollen joint counts (66 joints, SJC-66), and tender joint counts (68 joints, TJC-68). The affected body surface area (BSA) is noted as a percentage and the C-Reactive Protein (CRP) value is provided as continuous value in mg/l. The DAS-28-CRP is calculated using 28 swollen and tender joint counts, CRP (mg/l), and patient global assessment. Physician global assessment is rated on a numeric rating scale (NRS 0–10). The DAPSA is a continuous measure focusing on joint involvement and providing granular information about disease activity [ 16 17 18 Patients provide data on sociodemographic characteristics and a variety of patient-reported outcome measures. The patient global assessment, pain, and sleep disturbance are rated on NRS 0–10. The WHO-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5) is a widely used five-item instrument for screening depressive symptoms, yielding a total score from 0 to 100, with scores below 29 indicating moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Higher scores reflect greater well-being [ 19 20 Therapy persistence rate The Kaplan-Meier method was utilized to estimate therapy persistence to visualize the time-to-treatment discontinuation of the first-line b/tsDMARD therapy for the two groups of interest. One therapy episode was defined as an episode of the same active substance that has not been paused for more than 90 days. Patients who continued therapy after database close or were lost-to-follow up were censored. To analyze the direct effect of sex on therapy persistence, we used a minimally adjusted model. Age was included as covariate, as it may influence therapy persistence independently, through factors such as comorbidities, treatment tolerability, or healthcare-seeking behavior, but is not considered a mediator in the relationship between sex and therapy persistence. Additional covariates that could potentially act as mediators, such as disease severity or other sociodemographic factors, were deliberately excluded to avoid attenuating or obscuring the direct effect of sex [ 21 22 Reasons for discontinuation Physician-reported reasons for discontinuation were categorized into adverse events, lack of efficacy, remission and other reasons. For all patients who stopped their first-line therapy during observation proportion of reasons for discontinuation were analyzed. Adverse events analysis To enhance clarity, SAEs and AEs are collectively referred to as events unless otherwise specified and needed. In this event analysis we only included patients for whom the reason to discontinue was reported as “(serious) adverse event”. The specific event(s) that led to therapy discontinuation cannot definitively be identified, due to the way events are reported in the register, because physicians are not explicitly asked to specify which specific event or a combination of events was the reason for discontinuation. Therefore, to identify an event as a treatment-related reason for discontinuation, we used the following assumptions: The primary criterion to classify an event, as either treatment-related or non-treatment-related, was the causal relationship to the therapy indicated by the physician as ‘definite,’ ‘probable,’ or ‘possible’. Secondly, if no information on the causal relationship was provided or it was indicating an ‘unlikely’, ‘no causal’ or ‘unknown’ relationship, the event was selected time-based. This means if the event occurred no more than 90 days before and 14 days after the date of therapy discontinuation, it was eligible for selection and therefore matching to the therapy episode. The risk windows for neoplasms and malignancies were extended to the end of observation time. If an event could not be classified as either having a causal or time-based relationship to the first-line therapy, it was considered out of range and excluded from further event analysis.

The most common infections were influenza, oral herpes, nasopharyngitis, and cystitis. One serious flare event occurred in one female. One serious cardiologic event was reported for one male patient, which was an intracardiac thrombus. Neurologic/psychiatric events were reported in nine females (12 AEs) and three males (3 AEs) but no serious adverse events occurred in this category. Neurologic/psychiatric events include, among others, depression, headache, dizziness, and mood swings. One female had a haematologic AE, which was leucopenia. A benign neoplasia event was documented in three females. These were pulmonary mass, papilloma and uterine leiomyoma. The most frequently documented events were labeled as “other events”, and included for example allergic conditions, diarrhea, skin disorders, alopecia, other musculoskeletal disorders, and pruritus.

Patients may be represented in multiple categories Discussion This study investigated the differences between female and male patients with PsA, regarding variations in disease characteristics, therapy persistence, and reasons for discontinuation. Furthermore, we placed a special focus on sex differences in treatment-related adverse events in a real-world setting. We analyzed 800 patients starting their first b/tsDMARD therapy. We had a higher number of female patients in the cohort, and they were, on average, two years older than males. Females had a one year longer diagnostic delay, exhibited worse health-related outcomes, and showed higher musculoskeletal disease activity at the start of treatment while males presented more severe skin involvement. These findings align with previously presented data from systematic reviews on observational studies and randomized clinical trials [ 3 23 24 TNFi was the most frequently prescribed b/tsDMARD among both sexes, followed by IL17i, which were more commonly prescribed to males, while females more often received IL23i. As IL17i are particularly effective in treating skin manifestations [ 25 26 Regarding treatment, females had lower persistence rates for both TNFi and IL17i in our study. This corresponds to results from the Danish DANBIO register, where males also remained on TNFi first-line therapy for a longer duration [ 27 10 28 29 A trend observed across multiple studies suggests that females experience higher rates of discontinuation due to side effects, particularly with TNFi and IL17i therapies. This observation is further supported by a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which found lower response rates and higher discontinuation rates when treated with TNFi and IL17i in females. On the other hand, for Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi), the efficacy between the sexes was similar, but females experienced a higher incidence of adverse events, which could contribute to their lower therapy persistence [ 23 These sex-based differences in therapy persistence may be further elucidated by examining the reason for therapy discontinuation, where we found notable differences. While the most common reason for discontinuation among both sexes was lack of efficacy, interestingly, males were three times more likely to discontinue therapy due to remission, further supporting the findings related to treatment response and effectiveness. Females, on the other hand, were more likely to discontinue treatment because of safety events. Our safety data showed that, during the initial b/tsDMARD intervention, females had more safety events overall, but SAEs were reported twice as often in males. This finding aligns with a worldwide study on differences in reporting drug events in which male reports were more frequently classified as SAE [ 30 31 As expected, the most common treatment-related events overall were infections, neurologic/psychiatric and other events, with more non-serious events reported in females. Most of the infectious events were attributable to flu-like infections. In a study on patients with psoriasis receiving bDMARDs, females had significantly more fungal and herpes simplex infections compared to males [ 32 23 33 Our findings underscore significant sex-specific differences among patients with PsA in terms of baseline characteristics, treatment outcomes, and persistence with therapy. Moreover, we provide novel insights into the underlying reasons for treatment discontinuation, revealing distinct patterns between female and male patients. Additionally, our analysis highlights sex-based disparities in the nature and incidence of adverse events. Strengths and limitations A strength of our study is the large prospective, observational, real-world data source providing a close monitoring of efficacy and safety under all approved b/tsDMARD strategies within predefined follow up intervals. The sample size enabled sex-stratified analyses on reasons for therapy discontinuation, along with detailed information on adverse events. Limitations: Due to the observational nature of the registry, causal inferences cannot be drawn from our findings. As we only capture sex as a simple variable, we cannot separate sex and gender but recognize that both biological processes and gender roles likely influence outcomes. Due to the design of the questionnaires, we could not determine the exact event that led to therapy discontinuation, but had to make assumptions and assigned the events primarily via temporal context. In 35% of therapy discontinuations, the reason for discontinuation was not documented. This proportion of missing information may have influenced the observed distribution of discontinuation causes between sexes and should be considered when interpreting these results. While we adjusted only for age to retain the total observed effect of sex, other potential confounders (e.g., comorbidities, smoking, concomitant drugs) were not included in the models. Thus, residual confounding may contribute to the observed sex differences and our findings should be interpreted accordingly. Differences in reporting behavior between sexes may have influenced our findings. In particular, females may be more likely to report less severe AE, potentially inflating AE-related discontinuation rates compared to males. This possible reporting bias could partly explain the observed sex differences and should be considered when interpreting the results. Conclusion This study observed sex differences in PsA, with women showing higher baseline disease activity and musculoskeletal burden, but lower therapy persistence, particularly with TNFi and IL17i therapies. Male patients were more likely to discontinue treatment due to remission, while females discontinued more often due to side effects, highlighting a key difference in treatment-related adverse events. These findings emphasize the need for sex-specific strategies in managing PsA to improve therapeutic outcomes and patient satisfaction. More nuanced research into both biological and sociocultural factors influencing therapy outcomes in PsA is needed, especially in real-world settings. Observational studies provide valuable insights but the lack of standardized reporting of sex data limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions. Capturing sex-related variables across all types of studies is an important future direction to broaden our knowledge and deepen our understanding of the underlying factors contributing to observed disparities.
