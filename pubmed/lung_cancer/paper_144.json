Background The relationship between sarcopenia and clinical outcomes in patients with bladder cancer (BC) has been inconsistently reported in the literature. Some studies have identified sarcopenia as a potential prognostic indicator associated with reduced survival following radical cystectomy (RC). Objectives This study was conducted to systematically evaluate the prognostic significance of sarcopenia in patients with bladder cancer undergoing RC. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CHINAHL, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) Databases, and Wanfang Database, up to August 23, 2023, to identify both retrospective and prospective cohort studies. To assess the methodological quality of the included studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was utilized to evaluate the risk of bias. Furthermore, heterogeneity and potential publication bias were examined, and both subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to ensure the robustness of the findings. Results A total of 18 studies comprising 3,110 patients were included in the quantitative synthesis. The results of meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of sarcopenia was estimated to be 49% (95% CI: 41% to 57%, I 2 2 2 Conclusion Sarcopenia is commonly observed among patients with bladder cancer and appears to be an important prognostic indicator associated with decreased OS and CSS in those undergoing radical cystectomy. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings.

Screen the reference of the included articles to identify any other eligible studies. The following Mesh terms and keywords were include: ‘bladder’, ‘urothelial carcinoma’, ‘muscle-invasive bladder cancer’, ‘non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer’ ‘ sarcopenia’, ‘skeletal muscle index’, ‘muscle strength’, ‘Psoas muscle index’, the detailed search strategy is shown in  Supplementary Table S1 We use the Boolean operators “OR” and “AND” between the groups. The publication year of these articles was limited to January 1, 2008 to September 2023, and only full-text original research articles are considered. All search results are downloaded and imported directly into Zotero, version 6.0. Eligibility criteria We enrolled studies according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) study population: patients with any type of bladder cancer; (2)) indicator: sarcopenia (each study definition was applied, because no unique definition exists); (3) evaluated the prognostic value of preoperative sarcopenia; (4) outcomes: overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival(CSS), the prevalence of sarcopenia, or other available data of survival; (5) study type: prospective or retrospective studies. The exclusion criteria are: (1) the sample size was less than 50; (2) no available data for analysis; (3) studies with incomplete data, such as prevalence of sarcopenia, incomplete baseline characteristics, or other critical survival data. Study selection The study selection process was conducted by two independent reviewers (Zhang and Liu), who initially screened titles and abstracts to identify potentially eligible articles. Subsequently, a separate pair of reviewers (Li and Cao) independently assessed the full texts to determine study inclusion or exclusion. Reasons for exclusion were documented, and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion. If consensus could not be achieved, a third reviewer was consulted to make the final decision. Data extraction Two authors (Zhang and Yang) independently extracted relevant data from all eligible studies, including author names, study design, sample size, disease types, treatment modalities, patient age, sarcopenia definitions, and follow-up durations. The extracted datasets were cross-checked, and any discrepancies were resolved through consultation of the original articles. The study selection process is illustrated in the PRISMA flow diagram (  Figure 1 Figure 1 The article selection process. Flowchart depicting a study selection process. Identification phase shows 950 records from databases, with 235 duplicates removed. Screening phase shows 715 records screened, excluding 653 based on titles and abstracts, leading to 62 eligible for full-text review. Eligibility phase excludes 45 reports, resulting in 17 eligible studies. Included phase details 18 studies in qualitative review and meta-analysis. A manual reference search added 1 study. Quality appraisal Two reviewers independently assessed the risk of bias and overall study quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) ( 21 Definition of outcomes To ensure consistency in the analysis, we have adopted standardized operational definitions for OS and CSS based on widely accepted criteria in the oncology field. OS is defined as the time from the date of diagnosis or treatment initiation to the date of death from any cause, or the last known follow-up date if the patient is still alive. CSS is defined as the time from the date of diagnosis or treatment initiation to the date of death specifically due to cancer, with patients who die from other causes being censored. Given the variability in definitions across studies, we have taken the following approaches:1. For studies that did not explicitly define OS or CSS or used a non-standard definition, we referred to the most commonly accepted definitions in the literature, as described above. When possible, we consulted with the authors of these studies for clarification to ensure the consistency of the outcomes. 2. For studies where the definition of OS or CSS significantly differed from the standardized definition, we excluded them from the pooled analysis to prevent excessive heterogeneity. Data synthesis For analysis, the results extracted from the included studies were input into Stata 15.0 software package. The endpoints of OS and CSS were characterized by HR and 95%CI, and the pooled prevalence were estimated by proportion. The degree of heterogeneity was tested by Cochrane’s Q test (p value) and the I 2 22 2 2 23 24 Finally, the sensitivity analyses was performed to examine the influence of each study on the pooled estimates of the primary outcome. The data of included studies were divided into subgroups according to regions, measurement and median follow-up time. Due to the limited number of studies in certain subgroup analyses, sensitivity analyses were performed only for meta-analyses comprising more than two studies. All statistical tests were two-sided, with a significance threshold set at P < 0.05. Results Study selection In total, 950 related citations (PubMed: 259, EMBASE: 246, Web of science:160, Cochrane Library:160, CINAHL: 55, CNKI:15, Wanfang:12) were identified and qualified through electronic database search, of which 235 were duplicates. After screening titles and abstracts and removing duplicate references, 715 articles were selected on the basis of inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 45 were excluded because of irrelevant outcome and population, not evaluate the sarcopenia, not treated with RC. A total of 18 studies ( 17 19 23 25 38  Figure 1 Characteristics of the included primary studies A total of 18 studies were included, all of which were retrospective and included 3,110 patients who were treated with RC. Eligible patients were relatively old, with a median age ranging from 44 to 92 years, and most were from the United States and Japan. In terms of the definition of sarcopenia, most of these studies identified sarcopenia by measuring SMI ( 17 19 23 25 28 30 32 34 36 38 29 33 37  Table 1  Table 2 Table 1 The definition of sarcopenia.

Each horizontal line represents a study, with a square indicating the prevalence estimate and horizontal lines displaying the confidence interval. Estimates are divided into subgroups with diamonds representing pooled results. A vertical line marks the overall pooled estimate at 0.51, with individual weights listed on the right. Heterogeneity statistics are provided. Figure 3 Forest plots for the pooled prevalence of sarcopenia stratified by country. Forest plot comparing prevalence from studies in non-Asia and Asia regions. Each study is listed with prevalence, 95% confidence intervals (CI), and weight percentage. Non-Asia subgroup has a pooled prevalence of 0.54 with a 95% CI of 0.44 to 0.63, showing heterogeneity (I² = 94.9%). The Asia subgroup shows a pooled prevalence of 0.44 with a 95% CI of 0.31 to 0.57, also with high heterogeneity (I² = 94.8%). The test for heterogeneity between groups yields a p-value of 0.246. Effects of sarcopenia on overall survival Data from 15 studies, including 2,784 participants, were available to meta-analyze overall survival. Of the included studies, OS was defined in 12 from treatment initiation to death, or the last follow-up ( 15 17 19 26 27 29 33 37 25 35 38 2  Figure 4 Figure 4 Forest plot of the hazard ratios of sarcopenia for overall survival and cancer-specific survival. Forest plot showing hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for studies on OS and CSS. Each study's HR and CI are plotted with associated weights. Subgroup analyses show combined HRs: OS subgroup HR is 1.64 and CSS subgroup HR is 1.86. Heterogeneity is noted in the OS subgroup with an I-squared of 76.5% and p-value of 0.000. CSS subgroup heterogeneity is 0% with a p-value of 0.931. Overall heterogeneity between groups has a p-value of 0.410. Effects of sarcopenia on cancer-specific survival Data from 9 studies, including 1514 participants, were available to meta-analyze cancer-specific survival. Of the included studies, CSS in 7 studies was defined as the interval from RC to death attributable to bladder cancer progression or metastasis. CSS was not clearly defined in the remaining two studies. The results of meta-analysis showed that sarcopenia was associated with poor CSS, the pooled HR is 1.86 (95% CI: 1.45 to 2.27, I 2  Figure 4 Subgroup analyses We conducted subgroup analyses based on geographical region, measurement methods, and follow-up time separately for the outcomes of OS and CSS, as shown in  Table 3 Table 3 Subgroup analyses of OS and CSS.

The results showed that sarcopenia measured using SMI (International Consensus) was correlated with a decrease in OS (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.35 to 1.70, P < 0.001), while SMI(Martin) did not reach statistical significance (HR: 1.75, 95% CI: 0.66 to 2.83, P < 0.080). Both measurement methods, SMI (International Consensus) and SMI(Martin), had an impact on the decrease in CSS (HR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.32 to 2.21, P < 0.001; HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.28 to 3.40, P < 0.001). Regarding median follow-up time, we used a cut-off of 30 months for subgroup analysis. The results showed that sarcopenia was associated with a decrease in OS regardless of whether the median follow-up time exceeded 30 months (HR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.36 to 1.71, P < 0.001; HR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.67, P < 0.013). For CSS, subgroup analysis with a median follow-up time exceeding 30 months revealed an association with sarcopenia (HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.44 to 2.29), but no statistically significant association was observed in the subgroup with a median follow-up time of less than 30 months (HR: 2.08, 95% CI: 0.81 to 3.36, P < 0.187). Forest plots for all outcomes are provided in  Supplementary Figures 5  10 Sensitivity analyses and publication bias To evaluate the robustness and reliability of the primary analysis, sensitivity analyses were conducted by sequentially excluding individual studies. The results indicated that the overall survival outcomes remained consistent regardless of the removal of any single study, including those of relatively lower methodological quality. The results are shown in  Supplementary Figure 1 Publication bias was assessed using Begg’s test, and funnel plots were examined for symmetry. The P-values for Begg’s test were 0.223 for OS and 0.978 for CSS, suggesting no significant evidence of publication bias in the meta-analysis. The funnel plots are provided in the  Supplementary Materials Discussion This meta-analysis of 18 studies including 3,110 patients aimed to determine the predictive value of sarcopenia for prognosis in patients treated with RC. Our results showed that the pooled prevalence of sarcopenia defined as SMI (International Consensus) was 56% (95% CI: 48% to 64%, I 2 2 In accordance with the results of the meta-analysis, the forest plots clearly demonstrated that sarcopenia could significantly predict worse OS and CSS. The association between sarcopenia and decreased survival has been previously described in various malignancies. For instance, Peng et al. ( 43 44 40 Moreover, we methodically stratified the dataset based on geographic region, the measurement of sarcopenia, and the median duration of follow-up. The subgroup analyses consistently underscored the significant statistical association between sarcopenia and OS following RC. Given the disparities inherent to the Asian and Western populations, we conducted an evaluation of the relationship between sarcopenia and OS in two regions. The results demonstrate that sarcopenia was independently associated with increased risks of postoperative CSS in both the Asian and non-Asian subsets, which was consistent with previous research endeavors. For example, Miyake et al. ( 30 27 40 Our analysis identified a significant association between sarcopenia and reduced CSS, regardless of whether sarcopenia was defined according to the international consensus criteria or Martin’s definition. Likewise, we performed a subgroup analysis of the predictive value of Sarcopenia for CSS in patients with bladder cancer. No disparities were observed between populations in Asian and non-Asian regions, as sarcopenia exhibited significant predictive value for CSS in both groups. Nevertheless, within the subgroups categorized by follow-up duration, we did not identify statistically significant findings for the groups with a median follow-up time of less than 30 months. This may be attributed to the limited inclusion of studies in this group, and further confirmation of these results necessitates additional cohort studies in the future. Yamashita et al. ( 36 32 In summary, our systematic review reinforces the clinical significance of sarcopenia in patients undergoing RC for bladder cancer, as it serves as a noteworthy predictive factor for both overall survival OS and CSS. The identification of sarcopenia as a predictor for OS and CSS carries important clinical implications. Early screening for sarcopenia in bladder cancer patients could help clinicians make more informed treatment decisions, such as incorporating preoperative nutritional optimization, physical therapy, or sarcopenia-related interventions. This could improve postoperative recovery and long-term survival outcomes for these patients. Nevertheless, an undeniable issue persists in the field—there remains a lack of consensus regarding the definition of sarcopenia. Despite all included studies diagnosing sarcopenia through CT scans, variations in measurement criteria across multiple studies continue to pose a substantial hindrance to inter-study comparisons. Further diagnostic research is imperative for determining the optimal criteria for CT scan-based diagnosis of sarcopenia in bladder cancer patients. Furthermore, in future research within this field, it is essential to not only report patients’ survival outcomes but also specify the start and end times of follow-up periods for both OS and CSS. Additionally, focus should be directed toward aspects such as postoperative care management, surgical complications, cancer-related fatigue, and quality of life, among other pertinent factors. This approach will reduce heterogeneity between studies and better assess the prognostic value of sarcopenia in bladder cancer. Limitations While this meta-analysis consolidates current evidence and highlights sarcopenia as an important prognostic indicator in BC, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, substantial clinical heterogeneity among the included studies limited the feasibility of performing meta-analyses for several outcome measures. Second, the diverse definitions of sarcopenia employed across the studies, despite primarily relying on CT scans, exhibited variations in scanning levels and thresholds. Such differences between studies may have biased our results. Likewise, inconsistencies in the definitions of OS and CSS may introduce bias in the pooled results. Third, all included studies were retrospective in nature, which may have introduced a higher risk of bias and contributed to the observed inter-study heterogeneity. Furthermore, it is important to note that all of the included studies were published in English or Chinese, which may have led to language bias. Consequently, the findings should be interpreted with caution, and their applicability to clinical practice remains limited. Prospective, well-designed studies are warranted to further validate the prognostic significance of sarcopenia. Conclusion Sarcopenia is highly prevalent in patients with bladder cancer and emerges as a significant prognostic factor for impaired OS and CSS in BC patients undergoing RC. Further diagnostic research is imperative for determining the optimal criteria for CT scan-based diagnosis of sarcopenia in bladder cancer patients. More prospective studies are required to confirm our findings.
