Findings In this cohort study of 814 cancer survivors and 6481 individuals without prior cancer undergoing LCS, cancer survivors were more likely to be older and have increased comorbidities. Rates of positive low-dose computed tomography scans were similar between the 2 groups, but rates of lung cancer detection and all-cause mortality were slightly higher among cancer survivors. Meaning These findings suggest that LCS may result in early detection of second primary lung cancer in cancer survivors and should be evaluated in larger studies. This cohort study compares characteristics, low-dose computed tomography interpretation, lung cancer detection rates, and all-cause mortality rates among cancer survivors vs individuals without prior cancer undergoing lung cancer screening. Importance Cancer survivorship in the US is increasing greatly, and cancer survivors are at increased risk of developing second primary cancers, with lung cancer being the most common. However, data on lung cancer screening (LCS) with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) in cancer survivors are lacking. Objective To compare characteristics, LDCT interpretation, lung cancer detection rate (CDR), and all-cause mortality rate among cancer survivors vs individuals without prior cancer undergoing LCS. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study used North Carolina Lung Screening Registry (NCLSR) data from 2015 to 2019 among individuals undergoing LCS at 8 sites in North Carolina. The NCLSR was linked with the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry from 2000 to 2020 to identify cancer survivors and individuals without prior cancer. Data analysis was performed from June 2024 to April 2025. Exposure Undergoing LCS. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was whether lung cancer was diagnosed within 1 year after the first LCS examination. Comparison of demographic characteristics between cancer survivors and those without prior cancer was performed with χ 2 Results Of a total of 7295 individuals (mean [SD] age, 64.71 [6.34] years), 814 were cancer survivors (425 men [52.2%]), and 6481 (3290 men [50.8%]) had no history of cancer. Compared with the individuals without prior cancer, cancer survivors were older (3267 individuals without prior cancer [50.4%] vs 501 cancer survivors [61.6%] were aged ≥65 years; χ 2 1 P 2 2 P 2 2 P 2 1 P 2 1 P 2 1 P 2 1 P 2 2 P Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of LCS-screened individuals, cancer survivors were more likely to be older and formerly smoked and had slightly more comorbidities compared with individuals without prior cancer. Although rates of positive LDCT findings were similar, these findings suggest that the lung CDR may be higher in cancer survivors vs those without prior cancer and should be evaluated in larger studies. The complex relationship between cancer survivorship and the risk of second primary lung cancer underscores both the challenges and the opportunities for preventive care, such as LCS, in this population. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf no pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction With the combination of an increasingly aging (≥65 years) population 1 2 3 4 A cohort study between 1997 and 2014 of 457 334 Danish adults aged 40 years and older with a prior cancer diagnosis (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) found that 12.3% (56 114 individuals) developed an SPC. 5 5 6 The complex association between cancer survivorship and the risk of SPC underscores the challenges and opportunities for preventive care, including cancer screening in this population. Lung cancer screening (LCS) has been recommended in the US since 2013, 7 8 9 10 Several organizations recommend extending LCS to high-risk individuals outside the NLST inclusion criterion, including long-term cancer survivors, after 4 years of surveillance without recurrence. 11 12 9 Methods The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill institutional review board approved this study with a waiver of informed consent, because the study demonstrated no more than minimal risk to participants or their privacy. Reported data were deidentified in accordance with 45 CFR §46. 13 STROBE Data Sources We used data from the North Carolina Lung Screening Registry (NCLSR), a National Cancer Institute–funded registry that collects prospective data, including demographic characteristics (age, sex, race [categorized as Black, White, and other, which includes American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Other Pacific Islander, and any race not otherwise specified], and ethnicity from electronic health record databases), lung cancer risk factors, LCS examination information, follow-up procedures, and outcomes of individuals undergoing LCS at participating imaging sites across North Carolina. We included data on race and ethnicity in this study because there are known differences in lung cancer risk, lung cancer rates, and lung cancer screening rates, completion, and follow-up among racial and ethnic groups. Details of the LCS-eligible and screened population have been previously described. 14 Ascertainment of Cancer Survivor Status Using data from the NCLSR from patients screened for lung cancer at 8 sites in North Carolina from 2015 to 2019, we linked to the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry (NCCCR) data from 2000 to 2020 to ascertain whether a patient had any cancer diagnosis before the baseline LDCT examination and a lung cancer diagnosis after LCS. From the NCCCR, we used information on the primary site and histology to code the prior cancer type (eg, colon or breast) and the diagnosis dates. Where a prior cancer was found, we computed the time between the cancer diagnosis and the LCS. If any individual had more than 1 cancer diagnosis, we used the most recent cancer diagnosis date. We excluded individuals with a previous diagnosis of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Outcomes The LCS examination result was based on the radiologist’s reported LDCT interpretation, using the American College of Radiology’s Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) assessment. 15 Measures Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected in the NCLSR. For cancer survivors and those without prior cancer, we calculated (1) the probability of developing lung cancer within 5 years using the Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (LCRAT) model 16 17 18 19 20 Statistical Analysis Data analysis was performed from June 2024 to April 2025. Using χ 2 15 P P Results Among our cohort of 7295 individuals screened for lung cancer (mean [SD] age, 64.71 [6.34] years), 814 (11.2%) were cancer survivors (425 men [52.2%]), and 6481 (88.8%) had no prior cancer (3290 men [50.8%]) ( Figure 2 1 P 2 2 P 2 2 P Table 1 2 1 P 2 1 P Figure.

Discussion In this cohort study, cancer survivors who underwent LCS were older, were more likely to have formerly smoked, and had higher rates of respiratory and cardiovascular comorbidities compared with LCS-screened individuals without prior cancer. Yet, we found that cancer survivors and those without a history of cancer had similar rates of positive LDCT findings, comparable rates of the median 5-year probability of developing lung cancer, and similar mortality rates at 1 year after LCS. Both the median 5-year score of dying from lung cancer if not screened and the lung CDR were slightly higher among cancer survivors than those with no history of cancer, although there was insufficient evidence of a statistical difference. Our findings align with our secondary analysis of 1071 cancer survivors (4.1%) participating in the NLST. 21 21 21 22 Our findings that breast, prostate, bladder, lung, and colorectal cancer and HNC were the most common prior cancers among cancer survivors corroborate with existing data, including international data. 5 22 23 24 5 23 P P P 24 The complex association between cancer survivorship and the risk of an SPC underscores both the challenges and the opportunities for delivering preventive care, such as screening for lung cancer, the most common SPC, among the rapidly growing population of cancer survivors. This population represents a clinically heterogeneous population characterized by differences in underlying comorbidities, including long-term adverse effects from prior cancer diagnosis and treatments. Cancer treatment can accelerate aging, 25 26 27 In contrast to prior findings of higher rates of positive LDCT at the first LCS examination, potentially attributable to changes in lung parenchyma (eg, inflammation or fibrosis) caused by prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy among cancer survivors, 22 Strengths and Limitations To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date comparing LCS LDCT results, lung CDR, and all-cause mortality among cancer survivors and individuals without a history of cancer in the general population undergoing LCS. Our study is strengthened by the multisite representation of LCS in the population and the linkage with state cancer registry data to confirm prior cancer diagnoses. Our study also has several limitations. First, although the NCSLR data are collected from multiple sites, including academic and community health care settings, they are from 1 state, and differences in cancer survivors LCS across the US may exist. Second, the small cancer survivors sample size may limit the precision of the estimates. Third, there is also potential misclassification of personal cancer history (eg, individuals who moved into the state after receiving a cancer diagnosis). Fourth, lung cancer mortality could not be evaluated because of the small case numbers and restrictions on sharing cell counts fewer than 16. Fifth, missing values for core variables required for the LCRAT and LCDRAT macros may have engendered bias for risk score analyses. Sixth, among the subset of cancer survivors with prior lung cancer, we were unable to confirm that the screen-detected lung cancer was a second primary lung cancer vs a recurrence of the primary lung cancer. Conclusions In this study, rates of LDCT were similar between cancer survivors and individuals without prior cancer. Prioritizing LCS in cancer survivors to assess effectiveness and outcomes is an area of potential high impact. For one, we expect a substantial increase in the number of cancer survivors in the next 2 decades. Moreover, this population is at increased risk of developing an SPLC. Although age and smoking history are a practical way to select individuals at risk for lung cancer who may benefit from LCS, consideration of clinical variables associated with increased risk of lung cancer, such as a history of cancer, should be evaluated in the context of individualized shared decision-making and assessment of net benefits and risk of LCS. Further research in this growing population may help refine screening protocols and enhance survivorship care.
