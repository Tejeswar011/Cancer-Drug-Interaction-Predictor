Hence, our study aimed to investigate the potential correlation between emphysema as an exposure factor and BC as the outcome, while accounting for various covariates associated with BC. Methods: Participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database from 1998 to 2016 were selected for analysis. Initially, ineligible individuals were excluded from this analysis. Subsequently, chi-square test and t Results: After excluding ineligible individuals, 4,937 participants remained, comprising 152 patients with BC and 4,785 controls. The baseline table revealed significant differences between BC and control samples in terms of emphysema ( p −2 p −4 p −3 p −4 p −4 p −2 p p −2 Conclusion: The study’s findings indicating a correlation between emphysema and BC, with emphysema may be a risk factor for BC.

According to data from the World Health Organization, over 2.3 million new cases and 670,000 death from BC were reported in 2020, accounting for 11.7% of all cancer cases. 1 2 3 4 3 Emphysema is a component of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that severely reduces quality of life. It is a potentially fatal condition characterized by airflow restriction and lung inflammation, primarily due to damage to the alveolar walls and small airways. 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 To bridge this knowledge gap, we utilized the extensive National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) dataset to assess the relationship between emphysema and BC in this study. A baseline table was created, and the differences in clinical features between the control group and the BC group were analyzed using chi-square tests and t Materials and Methods Data extraction NHANES is an annual study conducted in the United States of America. It purposes to estimate the health and nutritional status of adults by collecting data and information related to health. All NHANES participants must provide written consent before participating in the survey, and all data are available online. The inclusion criteria for this analysis involved 92,062 participants from the period of 1998 to 2016. Initially, the data were cleaned according to covariates such as sex, age, marital status, education, and alcohol consumption to exclude data that lacked clinical information. The data cleaning process was shown in Supplementary Table S1 Definition of variables In this study, emphysema was considered as the exposure factor, and BC was the outcome. BC was characterized by participants being queried with the question, “Has a doctor or any other health professional ever informed you that you have cancer or any type of malignancy?” Those who responded affirmatively were subsequently asked, “What kind of cancer is this?” Only respondents who reported BC as their primary and single tumors were included. In a similar manner, emphysema was identified as individuals who responded positively to the query “Has a doctor or other health professional ever informed you that you have emphysema?” Additionally, several covariates were employed in this study. Among them, household income poverty ratio and number of pregnancies were continuous variables without grouping criteria. Meanwhile, some classified variables were employed. Specifically, age included ≤50 and >50 groups. Race encompassed Mexican American, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic White, other Hispanic, and other races (including multiracial). Marital status contained never married, married, and divorced. The education level encompassed the following categories: less than 9th grade, 9–11th grades (including 12th grade with no diploma), high school graduate/GED or equivalent, some college or associate degree (AA degree), and college graduate or above. Body mass index (BMI = weight/height 2 2 2 2 Statistical analysis To explore the difference in the included variables and exposure factors between patients with BC and controls, chi-square test and t-test 13 p Following this, to examine the relationship between emphysema and BC, weighted multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to construct three logistic regression models by “nhanesA” (v 1.0) 14 p Furthermore, to analyze the effects of emphysema on BC within various crowd, weighted stratified logistic regression was employed to conduct risk stratification analysis by “survey” (v 4.2.1) 15 p In general, all analyses were clearly executed via p Results Characteristics of participants Among the initial 92,062 participants, a total of 4,937 individuals met the inclusion criteria after applying the exclusion criteria outlined in Figure 1 Table 1 2 t-test p p p p p p FIG. 1.

To further confirm the stability of the correlation between exposure factors and BC risk across different races. Based on the selected exposure factors, stratified analysis was conducted through weighted stratified logistic regression to further evaluate the association between exposure factors and BC. Additionally, the combined risk stratification analysis produced a forest plot that similarly demonstrated that emphysema increased BC risk (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.25–5.41, p Fig. 2 FIG. 2. Baseline characteristics of the study population. To exclude the influence of smoking on the results, we conducted a comprehensive review of relevant literature and datasets to collect detailed smoking history information, including current smokers, former smokers, and never smokers. However, after incorporating smoking as a covariate in our survival analysis, we found that the p Supplementary Fig. S1 16 Regarding emphysema duration, the only available relevant information in the database was the age at which patients were diagnosed with emphysema. We attempted to incorporate this variable into our analysis. However, this reduced our sample size to just 72 cases. Among these 72 samples, one case had missing data, and of the remaining 71 samples, only 8 cases were positive for the outcome while 63 were negative ( Supplementary Table S2 As shown in the Supplementary Tables S3 Supplementary Table S4 Overall, we found a significant association between emphysema and BC, with emphysema may be a risk factor for BC. This finding may be helpful in BC treatment. Discussion In this study, the results of multiple regression analysis revealed a correlation between emphysema and BC. By examining the baseline statistical table, we discovered significantly differences in the emphysema population sizes between patients with BC and control groups, indicating that emphysema affects BC significantly. Furthermore, there were notable variations in the effect of emphysema on BC across the three model modifications, suggesting that other factors had no discernible effect on the influence of emphysema on BC. Using risk stratification analysis, we discovered that emphysema has an OR value greater than 1, indicating that it is a risk factor for BC. Several studies have reported the association between tumors and respiratory diseases. A previous study found that cancer patients with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infections typically exhibit mild clinical symptoms. However, in certain cases, SARS-CoV-2 Omicron infections can lead to severe illness or even death; therefore, early infection management and vigilant observation are important. 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Pulmonary emphysema is a chronic lung disease characterized by persistent abnormal air content, excessive swelling, and damage to the airway wall. The primary cause of emphysema is recognized to be cigarette smoking. 24 25 23 26 11 Compared to previous studies, our study had several advantages. Our study explored the potential association between emphysema and BC, utilizing the NHANES database from 1998 to 2016, which included 4,937 participants. Through weighted multivariate logistic regression analysis, our research confirmed a correlation between emphysema as an exposure factor and BC as an outcome. The study considered multiple BC-related covariates and conducted risk stratification analysis to further examine how emphysema impacts BC incidence across different population groups. These findings provide a potential theoretical basis for developing BC treatment strategies. This study has confirmed emphysema as a significant risk factor for BC. Given this finding, exploring novel therapies for patients with both conditions is of great importance. From a pathological mechanism perspective, both conditions exhibit dysregulated immune microenvironments, providing a theoretical basis for immunotherapy. Previous studies suggest that immunotherapeutic interventions could simultaneously enhance immune responses to combat cancer while improving respiratory function. 27 28 29 30 31 32 However, our study has several limitations. First, while using the NHANES database to analyze the association between emphysema and BC, we recognize potential selection bias due to sample selection and recruitment methods, and data reliance on self-reporting, especially with missing sensitive information like smoking history. Despite smoking being a crucial factor affecting emphysema and BC, 33 34 To summarize, this study combines the NHANES database to explore the relationship between emphysema and BC. The results showed significant differences in the impact of emphysema on BC under three model adjustments, indicating that the impact of emphysema on BC was not significantly affected by other covariates. The results of risk stratification analysis showed that the OR for emphysema was greater than 1, suggesting that emphysema may be a risk factor for BC. Conclusion Patients with BC have a higher prevalence of emphysema compared with those without BC. Our findings highlight the importance of emphysema prevention and management in patients with BC.
