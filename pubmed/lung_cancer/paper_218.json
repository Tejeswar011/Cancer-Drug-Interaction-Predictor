Open burning and open detonation (OB/OD) of explosive and hazardous wastes creates various toxic waste products, including particulate matter, that is released into the atmosphere and capable of generating significant health impacts upon exposure. The last commercially run OB/OD thermal treatment facility in operation in the United States is located near the rural community of Colfax in central Louisiana. To evaluate the community’s concerns about the potential health impacts from air pollution due to the facility’s regular open burning of explosive and hazardous wastes, we examined the disease burden in Colfax compared to the surrounding parish and state. In a cross-sectional study, we analyzed hospitalizations and mortality (2000–2018) where a primary or secondary disease code was associated with cardiovascular, respiratory, thyroid and skin disease. After adjusting for age, sex and race, morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were significantly higher in Colfax compared to the surrounding areas. In addition, comparing age-adjusted rates across geographies, stratified by race and sex, revealed place-based differences within sub-populations. The higher estimated prevalence of disease conditions is consistent with long-term particulate matter exposure and suggests a need for comprehensive exposure studies within the community. Our data further stress the need for enhanced epidemiological studies and tailored statistical methods to address exposures and environmental health impacts in rural populations, with fewer than 2,500 individuals, like Colfax. open burning hazardous waste rural communities environmental health health impact The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The facility's ongoing open burning of explosive and hazardous waste has raised significant concern among residents about long-term exposure to particulate matter and other toxic byproducts.We present a cross-sectional analysis of hospitalization and mortality data (2000–2018) for cardiovascular, respiratory, thyroid, and skin diseases in Colfax, comparing these rates to the surrounding parish and the state. This study was driven by residents citing various respiratory, cardiovascular, dermal, and thyroid disorders, in addition to cancers. Our findings demonstrate significantly elevated rates of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, consistent with long-term exposure to airborne pollutants from OB/OD activities. Importantly, we also highlight disparities within subpopulations when stratifying by race and sex, underscoring the necessity of context-specific public health interventions. This work provides a rare and timely evaluation of pollutant exposure and health outcomes in a rural, underserved community. Moreover, it emphasizes the urgent need for robust epidemiological methods tailored to small populations that often fall outside the scope of traditional environmental health surveillance.We believe our study offers critical insights into the environmental justice implications of hazardous waste disposal practices and the value of integrating community concerns into scientific investigation. Introduction Thermal treatment of explosives and other hazardous wastes by open burning and open detonation (OB/OD) results in incomplete combustion of the wastes and the dispersal of residual hazardous constituents into the air. Thus, people may be exposed to hazardous constituents by inhalation of contaminated air, ingestion of contaminated water and food, and/or dermal contact and absorption. While the residual constituents released depend on the compounds processed by the OB/OD facility, studies of military burn pits with explosive waste streams have identified emissions of respirable particulate matter (PM) along with associated environmentally persistent free radicals, which act as precursors to dioxins and furans, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and volatile organic compounds [ 1 6 7 10 Colfax is a rural town in the state of Louisiana and is the seat of Grant Parish (the state’s equivalent to counties). According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (2022), it has a population of about 1600 people and a higher percentage of Black residents (66%) than Grant Parish (15%) and Louisiana (32%). A larger percentage of the Colfax population lives below poverty level (38%) compared with Grant Parish (15%) and Louisiana (19%) [ 11 Table 1 TABLE 1 Comparison of American Community Survey 5-year estimates (2022) for Louisiana, Grant Parish, Colfax town, ZIP code 71417 (which includes Colfax and is defined as Colfax for this study), and other ZIP codes in Grant Parish.

A thermal treatment facility operated by Clean Harbors, LLC is located about five miles north of the Colfax town limits ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Table 2 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 FIGURE 1 Map from EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) showing the location of the thermal-treatment plant at Clean Harbors Colfax, LLC and two other TRI sites in Grant Parish, LA (shown in green).

As intercensal population estimates are unavailable at the ZCTA-level from USCB for the entire study period, the population for years 2001 through 2018 was extrapolated based on the average annual rate of change in the population for each geography between 2000 and 2010. These individual years of population estimates were then summed for the individual ZCTAs, Grant Parish and the state to create the cumulative population estimate for the 19-year study period. Inpatient discharge and mortality records Based on availability of data when the study was conceived, statewide hospital inpatient discharge and mortality data for the years 2000–2018 were obtained from LDH. Inpatient discharge reporting data often lags by a year; thus, data from 2019 onwards could not be included due to disruptions in the regular reporting system in 2020 due to COVID-19. The 19-year study period was selected to maximize the study size given the small population of Colfax ( Table 1 ® Supplementary Material S1 19 20 Crude rates of hospitalization and mortality with the diseases of interest were calculated by dividing the number of cases in each geography by the total population and multiplying by a factor of 10,000. These were then adjusted for age, sex assigned at birth (male/female) and race (Black/White) to the 2000 U.S. Standard Population. Age groups used for age-adjustment included 0–11 months, 1–17 years, 18–59 years, 60–74 years and 75 years and older [ 21 22 23 epitools Results Estimated prevalence of cardiovascular, respiratory and other diseases among hospitalized Residents of Colfax, LA The rate for presence of cardiovascular disease among hospitalized Colfax residents (2000–2018), adjusted for age, sex and race, was 1.30 times the state average (95% CI: 1.27–1.35; p < 0.0001) and 1.10 times that of Grant Parish excluding Colfax (95% CI: 1.06–1.13; p < 0.0001) ( Table 3 Figures 2A,B TABLE 3 Estimated prevalence of cardiovascular, respiratory, thyroid and inflammatory skin diseases among hospitalized residents of Colfax (ZIP code 71417), other ZIP codes in Grant Parish, and Louisiana, adjusted for age, sex and race (2000–2018). Age-adjusted rates also presented stratified by race and sex, except for diseases with <=20 cases in Colfax that yielded unstable estimates due to low number of cases.

The rates for the presence of respiratory disease among hospitalized Colfax residents (2000–2018) were similarly elevated compared to surrounding areas, after adjusting for age, sex and race ( Table 3 Figures 2C,D After adjusting for age, sex and race, rates for thyroid disorders among hospitalized residents of Colfax was slightly but not significantly higher than that of other residents of Grant Parish; however, it was significantly higher than the statewide average by 36% (P < 0.0001). No significant difference was noted regarding skin disorders between residents of Colfax and other areas of the parish or the state ( Table 3 Figures 2E,F Age-adjusted rates for all diseases were also stratified by race and sex to identify disparities among subgroups ( Table 3 Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S1 Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S1 FIGURE 3 Age-adjusted rates of hospitalizations with any cardiovascular (CVD) or respiratory (RESP) disease, stratified by race (A,B) (C,D) (A) (B) (C) (D) Bar graphs show age-adjusted mortality rates of cardiovascular (CVD) and respiratory (RESP) conditions per 10,000 population segmented by race and sex: Black (A), White (B), Female (C), Male (D).

Panels A and C show higher rates in Colfax for both disease categories. Panels B and D illustrate rate ratios, with significant differences marked by asterisks, indicating Colfax has notably higher rates compared to other regions for each disease type. Color codes differentiate the regions compared. The mortality rate in Colfax for all respiratory disease conditions was 2.36 times the state rate (95% CI: 2.08–2.68; p < 0.0001) ( Table 4 Figures 4C,D Age-adjusted mortality rates in Colfax were also examined stratified by race, and compared for people of the corresponding race residing in surrounding areas and the state. Among Black Colfax residents ( Table 4 Figures 5A,B Table 4 Figures 5C,D FIGURE 5 Age-adjusted mortality rate due to any cardiovascular (CVD) or respiratory (RESP) disease, stratified by race (A,B) (C,D) (A) (B) (C) (D) Bar graphs show age-adjusted mortality rates of cardiovascular (CVD) and respiratory (RESP) conditions per 10,000 population segmented by race and sex: Black (A), White (B), Female (C), Male (D).

Age-adjusted mortality rate, with respiratory disease as a cause of death, among Black Colfax residents was 2.63 times the state rate for Black individuals (95% CI: 2.15–3.21; p < 0.0001) and 1.41 times the rate for Grant Parish excluding Colfax (95% CI: 1.04–1.90; p = 0.0269) ( Table 4 Figures 5A,B Table 4 Supplementary Figure S2 Similar results were observed when stratified by sex as well. Among females, the age-adjusted mortality rate with cardiovascular disease was 2.56 times the statewide rate for females (95% CI: 2.28–2.87; p < 0.0001) and 1.20 times the rate for other Grant Parish ZIP codes (95% CI: 1.04–1.37; p = 0.0093) ( Table 4 Figures 5C,D Table 4 Figures 5C,D Supplementary Figure S2 Discussion In this study, we evaluated the association between residency near a hazardous waste OB/OD facility and hospitalization for cardiovascular, respiratory, thyroid, or skin disease along with mortality from cardiovascular or respiratory disease. This is the first study to examine the impact of living in the 71417 ZIP code (i.e., the community of Colfax, LA) on specific causes of morbidity and mortality. After adjusting for age, sex and race for the study period (2000–2018), our study found a significant increase in cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as a primary or secondary diagnosis at discharge among hospitalized patients in Colfax, LA compared to residents of other ZIP codes of Grant Parish. In addition, residents of Colfax experienced higher mortality with cardiovascular diseases, including ischemia and hypertension. Residents of Colfax were also more likely to have respiratory diseases, like lung cancer and respiratory tract infections, recorded as a diagnosis code, compared to residents of other ZIP codes of Grant Parish. Mortality rates due to respiratory diseases were higher in Colfax than the statewide rate but were similar across Grant Parish ( Figures 2 4 Since Colfax has a higher proportion of Black residents compared to surrounding areas in Grant Parish, and it is well known that Black Americans tend to face worse cardiovascular and respiratory health outcomes than White Americans [ 24 26 Figure 3 Figure 5 Supplementary Figures S1, S2 Study limitations are balanced by insights gained from our analyses. Hospitalization rates are presented adjusted for age, sex and race at the individual level in an attempt to isolate place-based differences in health outcomes. It is important to emphasize that children and older adults represent particularly vulnerable subpopulations in the context of environmental exposures. Due to their developing or aging physiological systems, these groups are more susceptible to the adverse health effects of airborne pollutants and contaminated water, such as those associated with open burning of hazardous wastes [ 27 28 29 High spatial resolution is essential in environmental health disparities studies to effectively identify correlations between pollution, health outcomes, and demographic characteristics. [ 30 2 31 Other study limitations involve the lack of available data surrounding genetic or lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking, exercise), most social determinants of health (e.g., poverty status, housing and food insecurity, and preventative healthcare access), indoor/outdoor environmental exposures arising from industrial or agricultural activities, and length of time lived in the specified area of residence at the time of hospitalization—all of which can affect hospitalization and mortality rates, especially in rural areas [ 32 33 18 34 Further, we emphasize the need to develop rigorous methods for analyzing the effects of localized pollution sources for similarly small and potentially at-risk locations like Colfax, LA. Future studies need to focus on geocoding street addresses to a particular point location, possibly combined with population survey and interview data (i.e., mixed methods approaches), to be able to conduct epidemiological studies at smaller scales in rural places, while protecting patient privacy. Use of newer technology may help to identify places that are comparable to Colfax in terms of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics but dissimilar in terms of its environmental characteristics, which could then help to isolate the attributable fraction of the environment on the observed disease burden. Additional resources should be devoted to designing and implementing prospective cohort studies in the area, in collaboration with the community members. By carefully documenting individual health metrics, exposures, potential confounding factors and tracking health outcomes longitudinally, it is more likely that causal inference can be drawn. In the meantime, greater efforts need to be made to ensure at-risk community members have the resources to manage their underlying health conditions. Finally, use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may help public health and research professionals test possible interventions as simulations conducted on synthetic populations that then help to identify specific interventions that can improve health outcomes in the area. Conclusion By calculating the estimated prevalence from the inpatient discharge database, we report a higher burden of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in the rural community of Colfax, Louisiana (2000–2018), after adjusting for age, sex and race. Mortality associated with these conditions was also significantly higher in Colfax compared to other areas of Grant Parish and Louisiana. These data demonstrate the need for more in-depth studies to understand the differences in rates of hospitalizations and mortality associated with living in the Colfax ZIP code (71417) and to determine if these health impacts are associated with air pollution emitted from the nearby open burning of hazardous wastes. This study also highlights the importance of developing novel methods to estimate disease prevalence in rural regions where low population density leads to data exclusion due to privacy concerns, low statistical power, and data instability, thereby hindering precise prevalence measurements. Further, the lack of infrastructure for consistent, long-term environment and health measurements pose additional challenges specific to addressing environmental health disparities in small, rural populations. Overcoming these challenges will require innovative statistical solutions that help to make “no community…invisible” [ 35 This was a collaborative effort between members of Louisiana State University Superfund Research Program.
