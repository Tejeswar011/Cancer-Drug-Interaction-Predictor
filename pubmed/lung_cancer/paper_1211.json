Free sulfonamides themselves display cytotoxic properties; however, coordination with metal ions often enhances both selectivity and potency, while also introducing new mechanisms of action. Although numerous studies have reported sulfonamide–metal complexes with anticancer activity, a systematic overview linking biological properties to the central metal atom has been lacking. This review summarizes current research on sulfonamide complexes with transition metals and selected main-group elements, focusing on their pharmacological potential as anticancer agents. The compounds discussed include complexes of titanium, chromium, manganese, rhenium, ruthenium, osmium, iridium, palladium, platinum, copper, silver, gold, iron, cobalt, nickel, uranium, calcium, magnesium and bismuth. For each group, representative structures are presented along with cytotoxicity data against cancer cell lines, comparisons with reference drugs such as for example cisplatin, and where relevant, studies on carbonic anhydrase inhibition. The survey of available data demonstrates that many sulfonamide–metal complexes show cytotoxic activity comparable to or greater than existing chemotherapeutic agents, while in some cases exhibiting reduced toxicity toward non-cancerous cells. These findings highlight the promise of sulfonamide–metal complexes as a fertile area for anticancer drug development and provide a framework for future design strategies. This review covers the research on anti-cancer activity of sulfonamide complexes during the years 2007–2025. sulfonamide complex with metals anticancer activity cell line Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education 19/20/B D.B.: Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education (No. 19/20/B). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Sulfonamides are part of a broader class of biologically active compounds. Their prominence emerged from their invaluable antibacterial properties, which, during the Second World War, played a crucial role in saving countless lives. The biological activity of sulfonamides is closely linked to their molecular structure, characterized by sulfonamide and amine substituents, as well as a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic frameworks. As of 24 August 2025, the DrugBank database lists 175 compounds classified as sulfonamides. Of these, 110 structures are either approved or in clinical trials, with 80 approved for therapeutic use. Sixty-nine structures remain under investigation, and 65 are in experimental stages. Among those approved as drugs, 16 have been withdrawn from medical practice due to health concerns. Silver salts are also present in this group as therapeutic agents; however, no records in DrugBank describe sulfonamide–metal complexes [ 1 Among sulfonamides with anticancer activity are sulfonamides containing various aromatic or heteroaromatic rings for example: quinazoline [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 In medicine, various organic compounds, acting in different ways, such as by intercalation, alkylation, etc., as well as some metal complexes, are used for widespread use in cancer treatment. The most popular anticancer drug currently used in medicine is cisplatin and its analogs: carboplatin, oxaliplatin, nedaplatin, lobaplatin and heptaplatin, shown in Figure 1 The oldest platinum drug is cisplatin, obtained in 1845 by the Italian chemist Michele Peyrone. After 120 years, the cytotoxic properties of this compound were accidentally discovered by American biophysicist Barnett Rosenberg. Currently, this compound is most often used in multi-drug therapy. Cisplatin is an alkylating cytotoxic agent, which binds to DNA by covalent binding. Cisplatin has many side effects, e.g., action only on certain types of cancer, non-selectivity of the drug, adverse effects on: kidneys, nervous system, hearing, vomiting and fatigue, natural or acquired drug resistance of certain types of cancer during therapy. To reduce these side effects, new platinum drugs have been obtained and are widely used in medicine: carboplatin, oxaliplatin, nedaplatin, lobaplatin and heptaplatin. All these platinum drugs meet the rule of the so-called classical platinum drugs: platinum is present in the II oxidation state, they contain two labile anionic and two inert neutral ligands with cis geometry and the entire complexes are inert. Over the years, many other platinum complexes deviating from these rules have been obtained and studied, e.g., complexes with trans geometry, platinum complexes on the IV oxidation state, platinum multicore complexes, encapsulation of platinum drugs in liposomal carriers and a number of complexes of other transition metals, e.g., titanium, ruthenium, osmium, gold, etc.—elements that differ in chemical properties related to their electron configuration. The most important features of the new compounds sought are cytotoxicity and selectivity. The chemical properties of the new complexes often determine different mechanisms of biological action than in the case of cisplatin and its derivatives. This could lead to a reduction in tumor resistance to the drug. The design of new complexes with anticancer activity uses multiple organic ligands, complexing most often via a nitrogen or oxygen atom. Examples of such organic ligands are sulfonamides—compounds containing the functional group -SO 2 2 17 There are various mechanisms of anticancer activity of the complexes discussed. The most common mechanism is the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase IX and XII. Other mechanisms include, for example, cell cycle arrest in the S phase or G1 phase, double DNA breaks, increased levels of reactive oxygen species, interaction with proteins responsible for tumor development and high mitochondrial membrane depolarization. The collected information on the latest sulfonamide complexes with anticancer activi-ty covers publications from the beginning of the 21st century to 2025. Databases such as Reaxys, SciFinder, and DrugBank were used for this purpose. 2. Sulfonamide Complexes with Metals 2.1. Titanium Complexes Sulfonamides form complexes with titanium as shown in Figure 2 1a d 18 The compounds 1a d Table 1 The highest antitumor activity against the HeLa S3 cell line is shown by compound 1c 1c Another example of anticancer sulfonamide titanium complexes are the six-coordinated complexes 2 3 Figure 1 19 Table 2 2 3 2.2. Chromium(II) Complex The sulfonamide-chromium complex with anti-cancer activity is complex 4 Figure 3 20 The anti-cancer activity of this complex was measured by cell viability after treatment, given as a percentage (%). For the MCF-7 cell line (breast cancer), it was 45.73%, and for the HCEC cell line (human corneal epithelial cells), it was 25.40%. For the free ligand, forming this complex—the viability of MCF-7 cells was 100%, and in the case of HCEC cells was 22.97%. 2.3. Manganese Complexes Manganese(II) sulfonamide complexes include complex 5, containing saccharin and 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazolyl)pyridine (bzimpy) as a ligands ( Figure 4 21 This complex was tested for cytotoxic activity against four cell lines: A459 (lung cancer), HT29 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast cancer) and MCF-10A (non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line). Antitumor activity was compared with that of the bzimpy ligand and cisplatin.

Rhenium Complexes Sulfonamide rhenium complexes that exhibit anticancer activity include carbonyl complexes ( Figure 5 6 9 22 These compounds were tested for human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) inhibition. Carbonic anhydrase is a target for both diagnosis and anticancer therapy.

Ruthenium Complexes Among the many metals under investigation, ruthenium complexes are among a group of compounds offering hope for potential use in chemotherapy. Ru(II) and Ru(III) ions have a strong affinity for nitrogen and sulfur [ 36 (a) chemical similarity to iron due to ruthenium’s location in the same group of the periodic table, e.g., oxidation degrees and a preferential coordination number = 6, (b) low redox potentials allowing for easy change of basic oxidation degrees under physiological conditions, (c) relatively slow ligand exchange (a rate comparable to the rate of cell division—mitosis), which means that if ruthenium binds to a selected cell component, it will remain so bound throughout the cell life cycle [ 37 Examples of sulfonamide complexes with ruthenium are shown in Figure 9 42 46 38 Table 16 42 44 Another group of sulfonamide anti-cancer ruthenium complexes are sulfamethoxypyridazine complexes ( 47 48 39 Table 17 48 47 2 2 2 2 Also of interest are organometallic compounds of ruthenium (II), the general formulas of which are shown in Figure 10 An example of such a sulfonamide ruthenium complex of the “piano stool” type is complex 49 p 40 49 50 50 Another example of sulfonamide ruthenium complexes of the “piano stool” type are compounds 50a h 41 50a h Table 18 In the case of the A2780 cell line, the greatest cytotoxic activity was exhibited by complex 50e 50g 50g 50h Piano stool-type ruthenium sulfonamide complexes also include organometallic, chloride complexes of acetazolamide with ruthenium 51a b Figure 10 42 Table 19 Both complexes 51a 51b 51b 51a 24 Another example of sulfonamide ruthenium complexes of the piano stool type are complexes 52a b 43 Table 20 Also known are ruthenium complexes with chiral sulfonamide (N-Tosyl) ligands 53 56 Table 21 55 56 44 Azo sulfonamides ( N N 57 61 45 Table 22 57g 2.7.

An example of such compounds are five-coordinated complexes of copper(II) with terpyridine ( 95a e 66 95a e Table 44 Table 44 Another group of sulfonamide complexes showing anti-cancer activity are five-coordinated copper complexes with 1,3,4-thiadiazole sulfonamides ( 96 97 67 Table 45 97 The copper atom can also take the coordination number 6 in many complexes with azaheteroaromatic ligands, for example with pyrimidine sulfonamides ( 98 100 68 98 100 Table 46 Complex 98 99 Schiff bases derived from N-tosylbenzene-1,2-diamine form four- and five-coordinate complexes with copper(II) ( 101 105 Figure 15 69 Table 47 101 105 101 102 Another sulfonamide copper complexes with potent anti-cancer properties are four-coordinated, tetrahedral biphosphine complexes of Cu(I) 106a b 70 106a Table 48 Sulfaclozine (SCZ) forms a complex 107 Table 49 30 An example of copper complexes with primary sulfonamides is complex 108 Table 50 71 Compound 109 34 109 Table 51 It is also known an analog of complex 4 Figure 3 20 Azo derivatives of sulfathiazole form complex 110 35 Table 52 Sulfonamide derivatives of 1,3-diaryltriazene form 111a e 72 Table 53 111b 2.12.

Conclusions Sulfonamides form many complexes with anti-cancer properties with metals: Ti, Mn, Re, Fe, Ru, Os, Ir, Pd, Pt, Cu, Ag, Au, Zn, Cd, Hg, U and Bi. The sulfonamide group can complex the metal atom via a nitrogen atom or an oxygen atom, or it may not participate in complexation (in this case, the metal atom is complexed by other structural elements of the molecule, containing donor atoms). The most popular type of sulfonamide complexes with metals such as rhenium, ruthenium, iridium, and osmium are “piano stool” complexes. The examples of these compounds presented here show that sulfonamide-metal complexes exhibit high anticancer activity, often greater than the reference compounds commonly used in medicine to treat cancer. Modification of the structure of sulfonamide ligands alters the cytotoxic activity of the complexes. One of the most popular sulfonamide ligands in anti-cancer complexes is saccharin. Some of the described complexes, such as for example 66c 82 122 124 15 16 17 18 64 65 83 84 40 41 110 142 40 4 4 53 54 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, P.R.; writing and review, P.R. and D.B.
