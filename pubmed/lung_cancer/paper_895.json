However, little is known about the full breadth, intensity, and approaches used to engage communities in RFE intervention work. Objective The purpose of this scoping review is to identify what CE research approaches have been applied by researchers in the RFE intervention literature and how they vary by type of retail settings, phase of intervention, year of intervention, and key domains of equity. Methods Following the JBI (formerly known as Joanna Briggs Institute) and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) extension for Scoping Review guidelines, any study published in academic journals and English that discussed activities or strategies for CE in RFEs, irrespective of the type of study, was included. PubMed, CINAHL, and ProQuest were searched for reports published from inception until August 2023. CE research strategies were extracted and classified following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continuum of community engagement framework, including outreach (lowest CE), consult/involve, collaboration, and shared leadership (highest CE). CE research strategies were then examined for their variation across RFE setting, intervention phase, intervention year, and key equity domains related to healthy food retail (eg, affordability). Results A total of 98 RFE interventions reported in 104 reports were included in this review, and most were implemented in either supermarkets (21%), corner stores (20%), or multiple RFE settings (21%). All interventions employed CE research strategies of outreach (n = 98), whereas approximately half employed strategies of shared leadership (n = 52). Exploring CE research strategies by RFE settings and intervention phase, this review found stronger forms of CE in less traditional RFE settings, including mobile markets, and among interventions that used CE research strategies across all phases of the intervention study. RFE interventions that implemented the highest forms of CE research strategies (ie, shared leadership) were also those that addressed all key equity domains. Conclusion The findings of this review reveal that the form of CE in RFE interventions varied widely, with more domains of equity addressed when higher forms of CE were used. Insights from this review suggest that future research should prioritize assessing the effectiveness of shared leadership CE strategies on achieving and sustaining nutrition-related health equity outcomes for communities.

A variety of different strategies have been implemented, such as introducing healthy foods at existing stores, introducing new food stores, raising nutrition knowledge of consumers or community residents via product labels, and leveraging the 4 Ps of marketing (ie, product, price, place, and promotion) to promote healthy food availability and purchasing. 9 12 9 11 9 12 13 13 Meaningful CE that centers diversity, equity, inclusion, and ownership 14 14 15 16 CBPR has been widely implemented in public health interventions, including those focusing on the RFE. 12 10 12 17 18 19 20 21 18 21 22 To fill these gaps, this scoping review aimed to identify what CE research approaches have been applied by researchers in RFE intervention literature. Specifically, this review examined the form and extent of CE in RFE interventions and how CE varied across RFE settings, intervention design phase (eg, planning, implementation), and intervention year. Furthermore, the review aimed to examine whether consideration of equity as defined by Kumanyika (2019) 23 24 METHODS This scoping review was performed using guidance from the JBI scoping review 25 26 https://osf.io/q6jtz Search Strategy The search strategy was created in collaboration with the University of Illinois College of Medicine Rockford’s research librarian, with test searches run in December 2022. The first database searches were executed on January 6, 2023, and they were rerun on August 18, 2023, to capture any new publication(s) since the first search. PubMed, CINAHL, as well as 5 databases in ProQuest (APA PsycInfo, PAIS Index, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, and Sociological Abstracts) were searched. The search included terms related to the concepts of “retail food environment (RFE)” and “community engagement (CE).” The search process was iterative, and additional terms were added as identified throughout the process to create the final search strategy ( Supplementary Figure 1 Eligibility Criteria Following the JBI recommendations, 25 context, concept population of interest context 27 28 concept population of interest Following the inclusion/exclusion criteria, reports written in English were considered. While ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I and ProQuest Dissertations databases were searched, our final inclusion/exclusion criteria required reports to be published in academic journals. Any reports that discussed the activities or strategies to engage customers or communities in RFE interventions, regardless of the type of manuscript (such as protocol, formative research, evaluation, or program implementation), were included. Some researchers published intervention protocol papers, and others discussed their activities in an evaluation or formative research paper. The purpose was not to focus on the type of report or manuscript but to understand the intervention discussed in the report. Reports in which an RFE intervention was not conducted were excluded. Reports targeting non-RFE settings, such as childcare facilities, schools, hospitals, and worksite cafeterias, were also excluded unless there was an explicit collaboration between these settings and retail food stores to implement intervention activities. Study Selection Covidence, a web-based platform, was used to manage the review. 29 Data Extraction A template was created, tested, and uploaded to Covidence 29 Activities to engage communities were extracted, and the CDC continuum of community engagement framework was followed to classify the level of CE in RFE interventions. 14 Figure 2 23 24 30 Data Synthesis Extracted data were synthesized in narrative and tabular form, guided by the research questions. To measure the extent of CE, each study was assessed for CE research activities that met the four CDC CE categories of outreach, consult/involve, collaborate, and shared ownership/decision making ( Fig 2 RESULTS The literature search resulted in 13 619 references. After removing 8980 duplicates, the title and abstract screening were conducted on 4639 records against the inclusion criteria. A total of 310 full-text reports were subsequently assessed for eligibility, and of these, 104 reports or articles were included in the review.

The findings revealed that CE research strategies of outreach were used across all RFE interventions, whereas enabling communities to participate in decision-making (ie, the highest level of CE) occurred in only half. In addition, the strength of CE varied across RFE settings, intervention phase, and domains of equity. Interventions conducted in diverse RFE settings, such as “mobile markets,” “multiple,” and “other,” and interventions involving communities throughout the intervention design (ie, from design through evaluation) had the highest level of CE (ie, shared decision-making) based on CE activities described. Similarly, interventions addressing all 4 domains of equity were also those that employed the highest forms of CE. Surprisingly, there was very little change in the strength of CE research strategies used in RFE interventions over time. The review also found that the phase and purpose of employing CE are critical regardless of the RFE setting. Any intervention (1) recognizing the importance of community ownership, (2) involving the community throughout the process from understanding their needs to program implementation, and (3) implementing comprehensive strategies rather than solely focusing on store promotion demonstrated the highest forms of CE. Such examples demonstrate that considering RFE as a part of a system (Policy, Systems, and Environmental [PSE] model-based interventions) rather than as a stand-alone determinant and ensuring community residents have the ability to influence decisions may be an important strategy for researchers to explore to develop more effective RFE interventions. These findings are consistent with the literature highlighting the importance of PSE change strategies to address complex health behaviors and to have a sustainable impact. 134 135 136 52 54 63 64 71 120 Evaluating equity considerations, it was found that nearly all RFE interventions (91%), regardless of the degree of CE employed, explicitly focused on historically and intentionally excluded communities. However, the extent to which the domains of equity (availability at existing site, availability at new site, accessibility, and affordability) were addressed did vary by CE, with only those interventions using the highest forms of CE able to address all 4 domains. This suggests that although CE can take additional time and effort, and inherently, some nontraditional retail settings may be better partners for this work than others, greater CE can result in more comprehensive and equitable solutions for addressing RFEs. Moreover, it aligns with the principles of the Strategies to Repair Equity and Transform Community Health Initiative (STRETCH) framework that centers on system change to achieve health equity and support power-sharing in community partnerships through community-led approaches. 137 Despite evidence that greater forms of CE are linked with greater attention to equity, this review also found that there has been little to no improvement in researchers implementing the highest levels of CE—shared decision-making and ownership—across RFE interventions over time. The importance of incorporating CE in interventions and working at more authentic levels that share power has gained increasing attention in public health after the launch of the first CBPR-focused research initiative at the National Institute of Health in 1995. 138 co-creation 139 140 140 141 143 Strengths and Limitations This review has several strengths and limitations. A key strength was using a broader definition of RFE that allowed authors to include less traditional retail settings, such as mobile markets, farmers markets, and vending machines, and compare the CE of these settings with traditional settings, such as supermarkets and grocery stores. In addition, this review performed an extensive database search led by a librarian and implemented the JBI 25 26 27 144 CONCLUSION Effective CE in RFE interventions is challenging but crucial. Documenting how and to what extent CE research strategies occurred is important to further understand what research gaps remain and explore the ways CE strategies could be leveraged for a more equitable intervention design. The findings of this review highlight that public health researchers who collaborated with communities throughout all phases of the project and aimed to address multiple domains of equity related to food retail were most likely to employ the highest levels of CE (ie, shared decision-making). As such, future RFE intervention research should assess whether shared leadership CE strategies—which strive to ensure community voice is incorporated in all decisions—are a more effective approach than other CE approaches in narrowing nutrition-related health equity outcomes for communities. Moreover, the limited information about CE research strategies described in some publications suggests that standardized dissemination procedures for intervention protocols could be beneficial to ensure a more complete and accurate understanding of the CE research activities employed.

RESEARCH SNAPSHOT Research Question: What are the community engagement (CE) research strategies used in retail food environment (RFE) interventions, and do they vary by type of retail settings, phase of intervention, year of intervention, and key domains of equity? Key Findings: Across the 98 included RFE interventions, all forms of CE research strategies, including outreach, consult/involve, collaboration, and shared leadership, were identified, with outreach used in all interventions and shared leadership in half. The form of CE research strategy varied across intervention characteristics (eg, intervention phase), and interventions using stronger CE forms also addressed more domains of equity. ",
