Early uses—such as teas, tinctures, and poultices—have evolved into sophisticated formulations with diverse applications. There is growing global interest in utilizing medicinal and aromatic plants as natural resources across the pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic industries. The bioactive compounds in these plants, recognized for their antioxidant, antibacterial, and anticancer properties, hold immense potential for applications in botanical medicines, dietary supplements, functional foods, and sustainable food packaging solutions 1 2 The genus Cistus Cistus 3 4 5 Cistus 6 7 2 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Recent studies have demonstrated that extracts from Cistus creticus 15 13 16 C. creticus 17 18 19 20 21 This study aims to investigate the seasonal variation in the phenolic and flavonoid profiles of C. creticus in silico C. creticus Materials and methods Plant material Freshly harvested leaves of Cistus creticus 1  Table 1 Seasonal environmental data for aflou, Algeria (2022).

This duration was chosen to allow adequate diffusion and solubilization of phenolic and flavonoid compounds while minimizing the risk of light or temperature-induced degradation. After soaking, we filtered the mixture and repeated this process twice. Once we finished filtering each solution, we used a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor IKA VB 10, Germany) to evaporate the mixture under reduced pressure at a temperature below 45 °C. This kept the plant compounds from being lost or damaged. Finally, we lyophilized the crude aqueous extract and stored it at −4 °C 22 Total phenolic content (TPC) The total phenolic content of the extracts was quantified using the Folin-Ciocalteu’s colorimetric method, following the protocol described by Boulanouar et al. (2013) 23 2 3 Total flavonoid content (TFC) Total flavonoid content was determined using the aluminium chloride colorimetric method described by Boulanouar et al.

Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) of the extracts is determined by the phosphomolybdenum method according to the procedure described by Rezzoug et al. (2019) 22 The antioxidant capacity was expressed as EC 50 Antiproliferative activity. The antiproliferative activities of the investigated extracts were assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay 24 4 HPLC-LC-MS/MS analysis The phytochemicals flavonoids and phenolic compounds analysis was performed using a SciEx UPLC (Exion-UPLC, USA) equipped with the LC-ESI-MS/MS-4500-QTRAP system (AB Sciex Instrument, Framingham, MA, USA). Moreover, data analysis used Analyst 1.7 software for data analysis 25 The samples were separated at a temperature of 50 ± 1 °C with an ODS column (100 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm). The initial mobile phase was made up of 80% water (with 1% formic acid, labeled as A) and 20% methanol (with 1% formic acid, labeled as B) (Table 2 25 26  Table 2 The elution system of the column.

We conducted MS/MS analyses using negative ion mode. Nitrogen gas, at a pressure of 60 psi, served as both the nebulizing and drying gas. The mass spectra were obtained over an m/z 2 C. creticus In silico Compounds and bioinformatics tools We investigated the phenolic compounds in C. creticus Protein preparation The receptors utilized in this study include the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase domain complexed with the 4-anilinoquinazoline inhibitor erlotinib (PDB ID: 1M17) 27 28 Virtual screening For high-speed virtual screening, we utilized iGEMDOCK (Generic Evolution Method for Docking) version 2.1 29 C. creticus Docking approach The anchoring protocol was employed for the co-crystallized reference ligand and water molecules from the crystal structure. We added polar hydrogen atoms during this process, maintaining the protein in a rigid state while allowing the ligand to remain flexible. The ligands (Salvianolic acid-A, Rutin, Quercetin, Hesperetin, Myricetin, Catechin, Rosmarinic acid, CAPE, Carnosic acid) that demonstrated the best virtual screening results with the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor were anchored using PDB code (ID: 1M17). Additionally, Luteolin 7- O 30 Biological activity prediction (PASS) We evaluated the ten most notable secondary metabolites identified in C. creticus https://www.way2drug.com/passonline/ 31 32 MD simulation Molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to assess the stability and dynamic behavior of the two most promising protein–ligand complexes. These are myricetin-EGFR and myricetin-NAD(P)H oxidase. They were found using molecular docking. Schrödinger LLC’s Desmond software 33 34 Statistical analysis We presented the calculations’ findings as the mean and standard deviation from three independent measurements. We conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post hoc test for mean comparison, using GraphPad Prism software version 8.4 (Software, San Diego, CA, USA). We deemed the differences significant statistically when the p-value was below 0.05. Results The effect of seasonal variation on the phenolic content and antioxidant activities This study investigated the seasonal variation in phenolic content, secondary metabolite production, and antioxidant activities of Algerian C. creticus 1 1 Figure 2 C. creticus 50 50 50 50 C. creticus 35 38 Our data suggests that the harvesting season significantly influences the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the extracts. The highest total phenolic and flavonoid content was observed in samples harvested in late winter (March), while the maximum antioxidant activity was found in samples collected in late summer and early fall (September). These findings are consistent with previous studies, which have also reported seasonal variations in the bioactive properties of plant extracts 39 40 Seasonal variations significantly influence the growth and metabolism of C. creticus 41 42 Antiproliferative activity The IC 50 3 50 50 50 50 50 Overall, the data suggest that seasonal variations significantly affect the anticancer properties of natural extracts. Extracts harvested in summer and spring exhibited higher potency, which may be attributed to more favorable growing conditions and higher concentrations of key bioactive compounds. These findings emphasize the importance of considering seasonal factors when assessing the therapeutic potential of natural extracts against cancer cells. Further research is needed to identify the specific compounds responsible for the observed seasonal variations in anticancer activity.

Molecular modelling Virtual screening The Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) is present in excess in multiple types of cancer. When a ligand binds to EGFR, it activates the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain. This activation starts a process that helps cells grow and survive cancer. TK inhibitors are used to block the activity of EGFR and other receptors as a treatment strategy for cancer. Over 40 TK inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for various types of cancer 48 C. creticus 49 C. creticus In this study, the compounds salvianolic acid-A, rutin, rosmarinic acid, quercetin, myricetin, hesperetin, catechin, CAPE, and carnosic acid were identified as active against the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase (PDB: 1M17). Additionally, CAPE, carnosic acid, catechin, hesperetin, myricetin, quercetin, rosmarinic acid, rutin, and luteolin 7- O 4 C. creticus  Table 4 High-throughput screening results between the two targets and the selected molecules of C. creticus Total energy (kcal/mol) PDB: 1M17 Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor tyrosine kinase domain Salvianolic acid- A -89.19 Rutin -77.64 Quercetin -85.3171 Hesperetin -85.4518 Myricetin -84.7225 Catechin -76.74 Rosmarinic acid -75.21 CAPE -72.0732 Carnosic acid -70.5667 PDB: 2CDU for the Crystal Structure of Nad (P)H Oxidase Luteolin 7- O -99.2067 Myricetin -97.2955 Hesperetin -92.0272 Catechin -91.3151 Quercetin -90.3901 Rutin -86.6341 Rosmarinic acid -79.17 CAPE -78.4288 Carnosic acid -73.8101 Molecular docking Molecular docking assays are commonly employed to illustrate how ligands bind to receptors. To validate the relevance of the molecular docking, the target ligand is docked to the active site, confirming its accuracy. Compounds for both targets were docked to the same active sites based on the best virtual screening scores. Drugs with screening scores ranging from − 70.5667 kcal/mol to -89.19 kcal/mol were identified as promising candidates for the tyrosine kinase domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, while compounds with scores between − 61.7025 kcal/mol and − 99.2067 kcal/mol were selected for NAD(P)H oxidase.
