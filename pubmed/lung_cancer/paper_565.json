Osimertinib is the standard treatment for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The addition of pemetrexed and carboplatin increases not only the efficacy but also the cardiotoxicity risk. We report a 59-year-old woman with NSCLC alongside brain, liver, and spleen metastases, who developed cardiovascular events following cancer therapy. With advanced imaging and multidisciplinary intervention, remarkable remission was achieved over two years. Reporting this case contributes to the understanding of its presentation and diagnostic challenges.

Introduction Lung cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer in the world [ 1 2 3 The standard treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, including exon 19 deletions, has become osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR inhibitor [ 4 5 Herein, we report a 59-year-old female with advanced NSCLC who developed significant cardiovascular complications after prolonged treatment with osimertinib, carboplatin, and pemetrexed. This case underlines the importance of close cardiovascular monitoring in patients receiving such a complex treatment regimen. 2. Case presentation A 59-year-old Saudi woman with a known history of asthma, hypertension, diabetes, and significant shisha (waterpipe) smoking presented to our hospital with a main complaint of coughing up yellowish thick sputum and unintentional weight loss of approximately 2 kg over the past three weeks. Her vitals were stable except for mild hypertension (131/73 mmHg). Physical examination revealed diminished left upper lung sounds without respiratory distress. Chest computed tomography (CT) ( Fig. 1 Fig. 2A After diagnosis, the patient underwent a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy targeting both the primary lung tumor and the metastases, as demonstrated in the chronological timeline ( Table 1 Fig. 2B One month later, she developed acute dyspnea secondary to pulmonary edema and was treated with IV diuretics elsewhere. In June 2024 (day 779), she presented to our hospital and was seen by cardiology specialists for further evaluation. Her blood tests were remarkable for elevated brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) at 44.7 pmol/L and N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) at 266.7 pmol/L, with normal troponin I levels. Based on all the previous findings, a cardiac PET/CT scan was performed and severe myocardial ischemia in the inferior and lateral walls was confirmed. Diagnostic catheterization was performed and showed a critical occlusion in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery with diagonal lesions ( Fig. 3A Fig. 3B She was discharged in stable condition. At the last follow-up, therapy adherence was suboptimal owing to renal concerns; pemetrexed dose was adjusted. PET/CT showed benign post-treatment inflammation (Hopkins score 3). Repeat imaging was scheduled after four months. 3. Discussion As a third-generation agent, osimertinib has become the cornerstone of treatment for patients with EGFR mutations who have advanced NSCLC. However, in cases where drug resistance is very high, physicians can combine osimertinib with other treatments, such as carboplatin and pemetrexed to increase its effectiveness. However, these combinations increase the risk of serious side effects [ 6 Our patient underwent extensive treatment that included osimertinib, pemetrexed, carboplatin, and WBRT. Despite the successful removal of her primary tumor and metastases, the treatment had certain disadvantages, such as severe LAD artery stenosis and acute pulmonary congestion. Some studies address the after-effects of osimertinib, which include non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and valvular heart disease; these complications while increasingly acknowledged, remain uncommon [ 7 8 9 7 Several case reports in the current literature reflect a few instances of patients who had developed cardiac events following treatment with osimertinib. For instance, a 70-year-old female developed cardiomyopathy and a prolonged QT interval after six months of osimertinib therapy, which was resolved by correcting the electrolyte imbalance [ 10 7 4. Conclusion In conclusion, this case demonstrates the importance of interdisciplinary cooperation in treating complicated medical conditions with special consideration for high-risk cases where close coordination between cardiology and oncology improves prognosis. Furthermore, advanced imaging modalities supported cancer therapy and significantly contributed to the assessment of cardiovascular risk. Finally, actionable changes in clinical practice, such as routine cardiac monitoring protocols for patients undergoing similar treatments, are recommended. Acknowledgements Not applicable.
