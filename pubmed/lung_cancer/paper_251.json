Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks expression of ER, PR, and HER2, accounts for approximately 15–20% of all breast cancers. TNBC is more common in younger women and certain ethnic groups, particularly those of African or Hispanic descent. This subtype is known for its aggressive clinical course, high rates of metastasis, and limited treatment options, as it does not respond to hormone therapies or HER2-targeted treatments. Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment, although research into targeted therapies is ongoing. Within TNBC, the basal-like subtype is particularly notable, characterized by the expression of basal cytokeratins (such as CK5/6 and CK14) and other markers like EGFR. Basal-like cancers often overlap with BRCA1-mutated breast cancers and are associated with a poor prognosis. Despite their initial sensitivity to chemotherapy, these tumors frequently recur, posing significant treatment challenges. Metabolic reprogramming is acknowledged as a fundamental hallmark of cancer 5 6 Central to this metabolic alteration is the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), which facilitates glucose transport into cancer cells, supporting their energy demands and biosynthetic processes. Crucially, GLUT-1 is implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, where its overexpression is associated with aggressive tumor behaviour and poor prognosis 7 Understanding the role of GLUT-1 in breast cancer is vital, as prior studies have linked its expression to high histologic grade, increased proliferative activity, negative ER and PR expression, and basal cytokeratin expression. These findings underscore GLUT-1’s potential as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in breast cancer management 8 Additionally, cancer cells modify their metabolism through various enzymes, including glutaminase. This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamate, supporting energy production, biomass synthesis, and redox balance, all of which are crucial for cancer cell survival and growth. Glutaminase has two main isoforms—kidney-type (GLS) and liver-type (GLS2)—each with distinct functions. GLS, or GLS1, facilitates glutaminolysis, fueling the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and providing substrates for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis, thereby supporting the rapid proliferation of breast cancer cells and their adaptation to hypoxic and nutrient-limited conditions 9 GLS-mediated glutaminolysis fuels the TCA cycle and provides essential substrates for nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis, thereby facilitating the rapid proliferation of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, this enzymatic process enables cancer cells to adapt to adverse microenvironmental conditions such as hypoxia and nutrient scarcity. Enhanced GLS1 activity promotes glutamine metabolism, fostering cancer cell survival, proliferation, and aggressiveness. Upregulation of GLS1 expression has been consistently associated with breast cancer progression, therapy resistance, and poor clinical outcomes 10 13 GLS2 is postulated to attenuate cell proliferation via the modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis within tissues, where oxidative stress-induced tissue damage is implicated in carcinogenesis 14 15 In TNBC, GLS2 exhibits a dual role: it can act as a tumor suppressor, inhibiting cancer cell proliferation and growth. However, despite the presence of elevated GLS levels, the concurrent expression of endogenous GLS2 suggests a compensatory mechanism. Notably, overexpression of GLS2 restores cell proliferation and metabolic function after GLS inhibition, indicating its involvement in metabolic adaptation and cell survival. Therefore, while GLS2 may suppress tumors, its expression paradoxically supports cell survival and growth in TN breast cancer 14 16 In conclusion, the intricate interplay between glutaminase isoforms and GLUT-1 underscores the diverse metabolic dynamics and adaptability of breast cancer cells, presenting promising avenues for targeted therapy to disrupt metabolic dependencies and enhance treatment efficacy 17 18 Materials and methods Specimen and data collection A comprehensive retrospective evaluation was carried out on a total of 306 cases with the diagnosis of invasive breast cancer and 52 cases of normal tissues. The data was collected from departmental archives and institutional databases at King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH) in Irbid, Jordan, spanning a period between January 2016 and November 2022, after obtaining the institutional review board (IRB) approval at Jordan University of Science and Technology/King Abdullah University Hospital (IRB # 26/2022). All procedures were performed in accordance with the relevant institutional and national guidelines and regulations, including the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. As this was a retrospective study involving anonymized archived tissue samples and associated clinical data, the requirement for obtaining individual informed consent was waived by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Jordan University of Science and Technology/King Abdullah University Hospital (IRB #26/2022). No identifying information, such as patient names or other personal identifiers, was included at any stage of the research, ensuring full compliance with ethical and confidentiality standards. The study included samples from patients who had undergone modified radical mastectomies, simple mastectomies, or wide local excisions, with or without axillary clearance. The study obtained data on tumor characteristics such as histologic type, grade, tumor size, lymph node status, and the respective status of ER, PR, and HER2, determined by immunohistochemistry, from the original histopathology reports. These parameters were previously assessed by certified pathologists using the College of American Pathologists (CAP) standardized data sets. Subject’s demographics and metastatic status were retrieved from clinical and initial radiological records. Tissue microarray production A fully automated tissue microarrayer (TMA Master II 3DHISTECH) was utilized to generate forty-four TMA cassettes. From each specimen, three 0.6-mm-diameter cores were taken. Thereafter, these three cores were inserted into a TMA paraffin cassette. This approach ensured that the samples were accurately represented by minimizing tissue loss and accommodating tumor heterogeneity. Immunohistochemistry staining protocol Four-micrometer-thick sections were produced using a Leica rotary microtome. These sections were then placed on slides that had been coated with a charged compound. Subsequently, the slides were heated for an hour at 62 degrees Celsius in an oven and then they were allowed to cool down at room temperature. The staining process was then carried out using the Ventana Bench Mark ULTRA IHC/ISH automated staining system, following the manufacturer’s standard protocol. In this study, primary antibodies for GLUT-1 (Abcam; ab115730; dilution 1:40), GLS (Abcam; ab260047; dilution 1:200), GLS2 (Abcam; ab113509; dilution 1:200), and Ki-67 (Abcam; ab16667; dilution 1:200) were utilized. Positive controls were included for GLUT-1, GLS, and GLS2 markers from placental tissue, renal tubules, and hepatic parenchyma, respectively. Benign mammary tissue was used as negative control. Immunohistochemistry interpretation and scoring The expression of GLUT-1 was designated as positive if any membranous and cytoplasmic staining was observed. Positivity for GLS and GLS2 was defined as any detectable cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. A modified histochemical score (H-score) system was employed to evaluate the expression of GLUT-1, GLS1, and GLS2 markers in tumor cells. The scoring system was based on two factors, the staining intensity and percentage. Using a four-tiered system (0 for negative, 1 for weak, 2 for moderate, and 3 for strong), the staining intensity was given (concurring to pre-agreed staining level intensity). The percentage of positively stained tumor cells for each intensity was subjectively estimated. The H-score was calculated by multiplying the percentage of positively stained cells (0–100) by the intensity (0–3), producing a total range of 0–300. The final score for each case was achieved by averaging the H-scores of the three cores within the specific case/specimen. High expression levels were assigned H-score ≥ median for each protein; GLS1 ≥ 75, GLS2 ≥ 150, and GLUT-1 ≥ 131. Ki67 proliferative index was determined by assessing the percentage of nuclei with positive staining in tumor cells among the total number of tumor cells. Proliferative index was considered high if the positive staining is > 15%. To ensure the utmost accuracy of the study, all cases were individually interpreted by three pathologists (SMA, SA, QS) using a light microscope (Olympus CX23 microscope). The three reviewers were blinded to clinical data, tumor characteristics, and the results of other markers. The overall concordance rate between the three reviewers was approximately 90.2%. In cases where there was a major discrepancy in interpretation, a consensus was achieved through a collaborative multiheaded microscopic review (using Olympus BX50 microscope). Statistical analysis Analyses were performed using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS©) Statistics for Windows, Version 22, (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA). The difference in expression between normal and cancer tissue or differences within different clinicopathologic characteristics were tested via Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal–Wallis H-test as appropriate. Pearson correlation test χ² and Fisher exact tests were used to test associations for categorical variables. Correlations between variables were evaluated by Spearman’s rank correlation test, where a value of 0.70 indicates a very strong relationship, 0.40–0.69 indicates a strong relationship, 0.30–0.39 indicates a moderate relationship, 0.20–0.29 indicates a weak relationship, and 0.01–0.19 indicates no or negligible relationship 19 Results Differential expression of GLUT-1, GLS1, and GLS2 in breast cancer Figure 1 2 2 P P  Fig. 1 Representative Immunohistochemical staining patterns of GLS1, GLS2, and GLUT-1 in normal and cancer tissues, (a-c) (d-f) (g-i) (j-l)  Fig. 2 Expression of GLS1 (a) (b) (c) Correlation of GLUT-1, GLS1, and GLS2 Expression with Breast Cancer Grade To explore the potential involvement of GLUT-1, GLS1, and GLS2 in the progression and severity of breast cancer, we examined their expression across different cancer grades (Fig. 3 3 The analysis of GLS1 expression revealed no statistically significant differences among the various grades of breast cancer ( p 3 In contrast, GLS2 and GLUT-1 showed statistically significant differences in expression across cancer grades, with p p 3 20  Fig. 3 Expression of GLS1, GLS2, and GLUT-1 among different clinicopathological grades.

While some studies have reported increased GLUT-1 expression in more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, others suggest that GLUT-1 can be overexpressed in a broad spectrum of tumor stages as an adaptation to the high energy demands of rapidly proliferating cells. Our findings suggest that while GLUT-1 overexpression is a feature of breast cancer, it may not vary significantly with stage, indicating that glucose metabolism is equally crucial across all stages of disease.

However, in contrast to several published studies that report an association between GLS1 expression and tumor aggressiveness, particularly in MYC-driven cancer 26 27 28 More directly related to glutamine metabolism, population-specific differences in metabolic profiles have been documented by Terunuma et al., who employed an unbiased metabolomics approach to compare metabolic profiles between African-American and European-American breast cancer patients 29 30 In contrast, GLS2 emerged as a critical isoform with specific relevance in breast cancer. High GLS2 expression was associated with HER2-negative and TNBCs, reflecting a greater dependency on glutamine metabolism in these subtypes 14 The significant correlations observed between GLS2, GLUT-1, and Ki-67 further underline their roles in tumor proliferation and aggressiveness. The strong association of GLS2 and GLUT-1 with Ki-67 in TNBC and basal-like subtypes suggests that these markers contribute to the high proliferative capacity of these tumors by meeting their metabolic demands. Additionally, the positive correlation between GLS2 and GLUT-1 in Luminal subtypes suggests a coordinated interaction between glutaminolysis and glycolysis, facilitating metabolic flexibility and tumor growth. These findings are supported by prior research indicating that enhanced metabolic activity through these pathways is a hallmark of aggressive breast cancers. In summary, this study highlights significant overexpression of GLUT-1, GLS1, and GLS2 in Jordanian breast cancer tissues, with subtype-specific associations observed for GLUT-1 and GLS2. The lack of prognostic correlation for GLS1 and the population-specific patterns seen in GLS2 expression suggest the presence of distinct metabolic phenotypes in this cohort. The clinical impact of this work lies in its support for metabolic profiling as a valuable adjunct to molecular classification, particularly in underrepresented populations. Future studies should incorporate integrated omics approaches and examine the therapeutic response to metabolic inhibitors across diverse populations. Such efforts will be critical for advancing precision oncology strategies tailored not only to tumor subtype but also to the unique metabolic landscapes shaped by population background.
