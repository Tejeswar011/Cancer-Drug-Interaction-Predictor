Although ABO blood groups have been linked to gastric cancer susceptibility, findings are inconsistent. Materials and methods We retrospectively compared 214 histologically confirmed gastric cancer cases with 214 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Presenting symptoms, physical findings (palpable mass, jaundice, ascites, hepatomegaly) and upper-gastrointestinal bleeding were recorded. Endoscopy documented tumour location (cardia, corpus, antrum, incisura angularis, whole stomach) and Borrmann type. Biopsies were classified as adenocarcinoma, signet-ring cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumour or lymphoma. ABO blood group was determined serologically, and tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) stage assigned by imaging. Results The cancer cohort comprised 149 men and 65 women and the control group 107 men and 107 women. ABO distributions were as follows: A, 50.5 %; B, 16.8 %; AB, 2.8% and O, 29.9 % in cases, versus 43.0%, 16.4%, 8.0% and 32.6% in controls, respectively. Blood group A showed a non-significant excess risk, whereas AB showed a non-significant deficit (p>0.05). Epigastric pain occurred significantly more often in AB and O groups than in A and B groups (p<0.05). No other clinical, endoscopic, histological or staging variables differed by blood group. Conclusions Our findings suggest a potential increase in gastric cancer risk associated with blood group A, and a possible protective effect of group AB, although statistical significance was not achieved. These observations underscore the need for larger, multicentre prospective studies incorporating genetic and environmental factors to clarify the mechanistic role of ABO antigens in gastric carcinogenesis and to improve risk stratification and early detection strategies. bloods groups cancer clinical correlations histopathological stomach pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Stomach cancer is a global health problem, ranking as the fifth most frequently diagnosed malignancy worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer-related death, following lung and colorectal cancers [ 1 2 3 4 The emergence and development of stomach cancer is due to the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Understanding these risk factors can provide better preventative measures for patients and the development of more rational treatment options [ 5 6 7 8 The role of ABO blood groups in stomach cancer was first suggested by Aird et al. in 1953, with the report that blood group A was determined more in stomach cancer patients than in control subjects [ 9 Materials and methods Patient and control group selection This retrospective study included 214 patients who were diagnosed with stomach cancer as a result of upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy performed in the Endoscopy Unit of the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Department of our hospital between October 2016 and March 2023. A healthy control group was formed of 214 subjects who presented at the Gastroenterology Polyclinic in the same time period and had no pathological findings. The patients included were those aged >18 years who provided written informed consent for participation in the study. Patients were excluded from the study if they were lost to follow-up, if their data were not available or were incomplete, or if they did not wish to participate despite meeting the study inclusion criteria. All the participants were evaluated by a gastroenterologist. After the anamnesis was taken, each patient underwent a physical examination. Routine laboratory investigations included fasting blood glucose, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transferase, (GGT), total bilirubin, albumin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, prothrombin time, hemogram, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), sedimentation rate, blood type, fecal occult blood, microscopic and parasite examinations and Helicobacter pylori For all the patients and control group subjects, the demographic and anthropometric characteristics (age, gender, body mass index (BMI)) were documented. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m²). Blood group analysis was performed in all the study subjects. Patients diagnosed with gastric cancer Patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of gastric cancer following upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were included. Clinical symptoms at presentation were recorded, including epigastric pain, chest pain, bloating, nausea and vomiting, dysphagia, feeling of obstruction, weight loss, and reflux symptoms was recorded. In the physical examination, the presence of a palpable mass, jaundice, ascites, and hepatomegaly was investigated and patients who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were also identified. In the upper GI endoscopy, detailed notes were taken of the tumour localisation (cardia, corpus, antrum, incisura angularis, whole stomach) and tumour type according to the Borrman classification (polypoid, ulcerated, ulceroinfiltrative, infiltrative). Pathologies taken from the stomach were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and evaluated by experienced pathologists. Biopsy samples were evaluated histopathologically and categorised as adenocarcinoma, signet ring cell, neuroendocrine, and lymphoma. The blood groups of the patients were examined. Abdominal and thorax computed tomography (CT) and positron emission computed tomography (PET-CT) scans were taken, and tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) grading was performed. Ethics statement Written informed consent for participation in the research was provided by all the study participants. The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee (approval number 60KAEK-2025-03-01) and conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Statistical analysis The data obtained in the study were analyzed statistically using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were presented as mean±standard deviation (SD) values, and categorical variables as frequency and percentage (n (%)). Data were tested for compliance with normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and histogram inspection. Parametric data of the groups were compared using the Student’s t-test and the one-sample chi-square or two-proportions Z test was used to test categorical data. In comparison with fewer than five observations, Fisher’s exact test was applied, and some data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) post hoc (least significant difference (LSD)) test. A value of p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 428 individuals were evaluated, comprising 214 patients (aged 25-84 years) diagnosed with gastric cancer and 214 healthy controls (aged 18-82 years). The gastric cancer group included 149 (69.6%) men and 65 (30.4%) women, whereas the control group included 107 (50.0%) men and 107 (50.0%) women. The gender distribution differed significantly between the groups (p<0.001). In the gastric cancer group, the mean height was 165.9±8.3 cm (range: 150-186 cm), mean weight was 71.7±12.5 kg (range: 42-98 kg), and mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.05±4.3 kg/m² (range: 16.4-37.7). In the control group, the mean height was 165.1±9.1 cm (range: 151-187 cm), mean weight was 75.6±15.2 kg (range: 49-125 kg), and mean BMI was 27.9±6.3 kg/m² (range: 23.1-41.1). There was no statistically significant difference in height between the groups (p>0.05), whereas both weight and BMI were significantly lower in the gastric cancer group (p=0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). In the gastric cancer group, blood group distribution was as follows: A in 108 patients (50.5%), B in 36 (16.8%), AB in six (2.8%), and O in 64 (29.9%). In the control group, the distribution was A in 92 individuals (43.0%), B in 35 (16.4%), AB in 17 (8.0%), and O in 70 (32.6%). Although blood group A appeared more prevalent and AB less prevalent among cancer patients, the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05) (Table 1 Table 1 Demographic, anthropometric and blood group characteristics in gastric cancer and control groups  Gastric cancer Control Test Statistic P value n=214 n=214 Age 62.5±13.1 47.6±14.9 t = 2.48 0.013 SD, min-max (25-84) (18-82) Gender   χ² = 15.63 <0.001 Female 65 (30.4%) 107 (50%) Male 149 (69.6%) 107 (50%) Size 165.9±8.3 165.1±9.1 t = 0.34 0.738 Min-max (150-186) (151-187) Weight 71.7±12.5 75.6±15.2 t = 3.29 0.001 Min-max (42-98) (49-125) BMI 26.05±4.3 27.9±6.3 t = 4.19 <0.001 Min-max (16.4-37.7) (23.1-41.1) Blood Group   χ² = 6.81 0.078 A 108 (50.5%) 92 (43.0%) B 36 (16.8%) 35 (16.4%) AB 6 (2.8%) 17 (8.0%) O 64 (29.9%) 70 (32.6%) SD: Standard deviation, Min: Minimum, Max: Maximum  The association between ABO blood group and various clinical, endoscopic and histopathological characteristics was further analyzed. Epigastric pain occurred significantly more frequently in patients with blood groups AB and O compared to those with groups A and B. Chest pain was more commonly reported in group AB, while bloating was more frequent in group O than in group A. No significant differences were noted among the blood groups in terms of palpable mass, weight loss, ascites, hepatomegaly, thrombosis, or nausea. Vomiting was significantly more common in groups O and B than in group A. Dysphagia and a sensation of obstruction were less frequent in group AB. Gastrointestinal bleeding and jaundice were more often reported in groups A and B, while reflux symptoms occurred more commonly in groups B and O (p<0.05) (Table 2 Table 2 The relationship between clinical and tumor characteristics and blood type in patients with gastric cancer  A (n=108) B (n=36) AB (n=6) 0 (n=64) Test Statistic (χ²) P value Clinical features       Epigastric Pain 61 (56.5%) 16 (44.4%) 6 (100%) 60 (93.8%) 16.21 <0.001 Chest Pain 43 (39.8%) 17 (47.2%) 6 (100%) 34 (53.1%) 9.87 0.019 Bloating 40 (37.0%) 19 (52.8%) 3 (50.0%) 40 (62.5%) 10.36 0.012 Palpable Mass 8 (7.4%) 2 (5.6%) 0 (0.0%) 4 (6.3%) 0.58 0.892 Nausea 66 (61.1%) 25 (69.4%) 3 (50.0%) 45 (70.3%) 2.40 0.491 Vomiting 34 (31.5%) 21 (58.3%) 3 (50.0%) 38 (59.4%) 13.34 0.001 Dysphagia 57 (52.8%) 22 (61.1%) 0 (0.0%) 27 (42.2%) 9.64 0.022 Stuck Feeling 61 (56.5%) 22 (61.1%) 0 (0.0%) 31 (48.4%) 8.79 0.032 GI bleeding 20 (18.5%) 7 (19.4%) 0 (0.0%) 4 (6.3%) 6,81 0.084 Weight Loss 98 (90.7%) 33 (91.7%) 6 (100%) 61 (95.3%) 1,72 0.628 Jaundice 12 (11.1%) 8 (22.2%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 11,42 0.002 Ascites 4.

Tumors localized in the antrum were more common in group B than in groups A and AB, whereas tumors in the incisura angularis were more frequent in groups AB and O than in A and B. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding involvement of the corpus or the whole stomach (Table 2 Regarding endoscopic findings, polypoid tumors were significantly more frequent in group B compared to groups A and O, and more frequent in group A than in group O. No significant differences were observed among the blood groups in the ulcerated, infiltrative, or ulceroinfiltrative tumor types (Table 2 Histopathological evaluation revealed that adenocarcinoma was significantly more common in blood groups B and AB, whereas signet-ring cell carcinoma was more prevalent in groups A and O. Neuroendocrine tumors were more frequently observed in group A, and lymphoma was more common in group O (p<0.05) (Table 2 2 Discussion The association between various cancer types and ABO blood groups has been explored extensively over the years [ 10 12 13 14 15 However, the literature remains inconsistent. In a large cohort study involving 4,932 gastric cancer patients, Mao et al. found an increased risk not only in individuals with blood group A, but also in those with blood group AB. These discrepancies may be attributable to geographic variations, differences in environmental exposures, or population-specific genetic backgrounds. While a consistent association has been observed between blood group A and gastric cancer across multiple studies, fewer have reported a significant relationship between blood group AB and cancer risk [ 16 Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the biological mechanisms linking ABO blood types and gastric cancer. These include roles in systemic inflammation, cell adhesion, and membrane signaling alterations. A potential link between ABO blood type and Helicobacter pylori 17 H. pylori 18 Regarding prognosis, the impact of ABO blood group remains controversial. Qiu et al. reported no prognostic relevance of blood type in a cohort of 474 gastric cancer patients [ 19 20 There is limited evidence on the association of ABO blood groups with demographic and tumor characteristics such as age, sex, tumor location, size, endoscopic appearance, T stage, and lymph node involvement. In this study, tumor localization was most frequently in the cardia (50.9%), followed by the incisura angularis (23.4%). Cardia involvement was more common in patients with blood groups A and B, whereas tumors in the incisura angularis were more frequently associated with blood groups AB and O. Histopathological evaluation revealed adenocarcinoma in 80.4% of patients, predominantly among those with blood groups B and AB. Although TNM staging did not show statistically significant differences among blood groups, N2 lymph node involvement appeared more frequent in patients with blood group B. In contrast, a study by Yu et al. involving 897 gastric cancer patients found no significant association between ABO blood groups and clinical parameters, including age, sex, tumor site, size, histological differentiation, T stage, or lymph node metastasis [ 21 This study has several limitations. Primarily, it was a single-center, retrospective study with a relatively modest sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The study also did not make statistical adjustments for known risk factors for stomach cancer, such as H. pylori Conclusions The results of this study revealed significant associations between ABO blood groups and various clinical and pathological features of gastric cancer, including disease risk, tumor localization, and histological subtype. Specifically, individuals with blood group A showed a higher prevalence of gastric cancer, while those with blood group AB had a lower frequency. Furthermore, blood group distribution appeared to correlate with certain symptoms at presentation, endoscopic tumor localization, and histopathological classifications, such as adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma. These findings suggest that blood group antigens may play a role not only in disease susceptibility but also in tumor behavior and biological diversity. Given the retrospective and single-center nature of this study, future large-scale, multicenter, and prospective studies are warranted to validate these associations and explore their potential impact on disease prognosis, treatment strategies, and personalized medicine approaches in gastric cancer management.
