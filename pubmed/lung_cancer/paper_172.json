Highlights • The link between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and multiple cardiovascular diseases has been reported, while the role of cumulative burden of MetS and its specific clusters in heart failure (HF) is lacking. • The increasing cumulative burden of MetS was significantly associated with a growing risk of HF. Although the clusters consisting of increased blood pressure were associated with a higher incidence of HF, this risk was attenuated by the component of increased triglycerides. • This study provided additional information to understand the role of MetS as a potential target for HF prevention. Aim: Previous studies have reported the link between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and multiple cardiovascular diseases. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the role of MetS in the risk of developing HF. Methods: This is a prospective cohort study based on UK Biobank. The components of MetS included increased blood pressure (P), central obesity (W), elevated blood glucose (G), reduced HDL cholesterol (H) and increased triglycerides (T); the cumulative burden of MetS components was defined as the sum of the presence of altered MetS components; and specific clusters of MetS components was defined as different combinations of the altered components. The outcome was incident heart failure. Cox proportional‐hazards models were used to generate the estimates. Results: Over a median follow-up for 13.2 years, 11,875 cases of incident HF occurred. As compared to individuals without altered component of MetS, the adjusted HRs gradually increased from 1.54, 1.64, 1.86, 2.18 to 2.62 across groups with 1–5 altered components, respectively. Increased blood pressure conferred a greater risk of HF than other components after adjustment, while increased triglycerides showed a protective effect, resulting in the highest risk observed in the clusters of PGHW (adjusted HR = 3.17, 95 % CI = 2.70–3.72), followed by PGHTW, PGW, PGH, and PGTW. These observed associations were almost stronger in younger adults than older participants, or in females than males. Conclusion: Cumulative burden of MetS was associated with higher incidence of HF, while which varied by different clusters.

Along with the increase in these cardiometabolic risk factors, the prevalence of MetS is steadily rising. MetS has been reported to be associated with an elevated risk of multiple cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in epidemiological studies, while the evidence of the influence on HF risk was limited [ 6 [7] [8] [9] This study aimed to clarify the association between the cumulative burden of MetS components and HF risk, as well as explored if specific clusters of MetS components had differential impact on the risk of HF. 2 Methods 2.1 Study population This is a population-based prospective cohort study from the UK Biobank (UKB), that was implemented among >0.5 million adults aged 40 to 69 years. 22 centers recruited participants between March 2006 and December 2010 from the United Kingdom [ 10 11 2.2 Assessment of exposure The MetS components were defined using the Harmonized Criteria as following [ 12 The exposures considered in our study included specific components of MetS, cumulative burden of MetS components, and specific clusters of MetS components. Specific component of MetS was defined as the presence of altered component of interest, regardless of the status of other components; cumulative burden of MetS components was defined as the sum of the presence of altered MetS components; specific clusters of MetS components was defined by different combinations of the individual components of MetS. 2.3 Assessment of outcome The outcome was incident HF during the follow-up period, which was identified by using the International Classification of Disease 10 of I50 from category of “First occurrence” (Category ID: 1712) with Field IDs of 131355. The “First occurrence” Category in UK Biobank was derived from self-reported medical conditions, primary health care, hospital admission data and death registry data. The followed up began at the date of baseline assessment until the date of HF occurrence, death, loss-to-follow, or the end of study (May 20, 2022), whichever came first. 2.4 Assessment of covariates Confounders that are known to be associated with MetS and HF were assessed in the study. Age at baseline (continuous) was calculated from the date of birth and the date of beginning in the assessment center. Sex was recorded as female or male. Race/ethnicity was categorized according to the UK Biobank definitions as White, Mixed, Asian or Asian British, Black or Black British, and Other ethnic group. Education was categorized as college/university degree or other professional qualification, second/final stage of secondary education, first stage of secondary education, work-related practical qualifications, or others were captured from the questionnaire. Socioeconomic status was measured by Townsend deprivation index (TDI), which was categorized into quartiles and unknown group. Smoking status was classified as never, former, current and unknown. Alcohol intake frequency was classified as daily, three or four times a week, once or twice a week, one to three times a month, special occasions only, never and unknown. Physical activity was evaluated via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire using summed metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week for all activity, and was categorized by quartile of total MET. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from measured weight in kilograms being divided and measured height in meters squared. C‑reactive protein (CRP) was measured at baseline as a biomarker of low‑grade inflammation and was analyzed both as a continuous variable and in categories (≤3 mg/L vs >3 mg/L) for stratified analyses. Common comorbidities associated with MetS and HF, including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke, were collected from self-reported at baseline, inpatient hospital records and primary care records. 2.5 Statistical analysis Baseline characteristics are shown as frequency and percentage for categorical variables and as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) or χ2 test was used for comparison between groups with different cumulative burden of MetS. For ANOVA analyses demonstrating significant between-group differences ( p Cox proportional hazards model was applied to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) of exposures with the incidence of HF, with individuals without altered component of MetS as the reference group. Stratified analyses were performed according to age (<45, 45–54, 55–65, >65 years old) and sex (male vs female), and CRP level (≤3 mg/L vs >3 mg/L). Interactions were tested by including a product term of the stratification factor and exposure in the model. To account for the impact of competing risk from death, Fine-gray sub-distribution hazard models of competing risk regression were performed to assess the association between exposures and risk of HF using mortality as a competing event. Both univariable and multivariable models were conducted for all analyses, and potential confounders with significant difference in distribution between groups were included in multivariable models. All data were analyzed with R version 4.1.0 and SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).

cases observed across groups with 0–5 altered component of MetS, leading to the incidence rate of 0.63, 1.68, 2.4, 3.44, 4.77 and 7.28 per 1000 person-years, respectively.

W, increased waist circumference; P, increased blood pressure; G, increased blood glucose; T, increased triglycerides; H, reduced HDL cholesterol. Fig 4 4 Discussion This prospective cohort study found that the increasing cumulative burden of MetS components was significantly associated with a growing risk of HF. Among these components, increased blood pressure played a predominant role in increasing HF risk, followed by increased blood glucose, increased waist circumference, and reduced HDL cholesterol. However, increased triglycerides were related to a reduced risk of HF. Thus, analyses regarding specific clusters of MetS components found higher HF risk in the clusters with higher cumulative burden in general, besides, the clusters consisting of the component of increased blood pressure were associated with a higher incidence of HF while the clusters including the component of increased triglycerides related to a reduced risk of HF, leading to the highest risk in the cluster of PGHW, followed by PGHTW, PGW, PGH, and PGTW. Stratified analyses suggested a stronger association of MetS with HF risk in younger adults or females. Furthermore, our CRP-stratified analysis indicated that the association between MetS and HF risk remained consistent across CRP levels, but appeared slightly stronger among participants with higher CRP levels, suggesting a potential additive effect of systemic inflammation. This observation is supported by previous evidence suggesting that inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of HF among individuals with MetS [ 13 A number of studies have demonstrated the adverse impact of MetS on CVDs, but most studies had relatively small sample size and fewer researches focused on HF [ [14] [15] [16] 13 17 18 19 20 Specific MetS components have been linked to an increased HF risk [ 8 [21] [22] [23] [24] 25 14 20 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 9 35 Our study revealed that MetS was related to an increase in the relative risk of HF in population of all ages, while the effect of MetS on HF differed by age groups. For incident HF, we found significant interaction between age and the cumulative burden of MetS (P for interaction <0.001). To further clarify this effect, we applied a more refined age stratification (<45, 45–54, 55–65, >65 years), and consistently observed that the association between MetS and HF was strongest in participants aged <45 years, with a gradual attenuation in older groups. Specifically, our findings indicated that the cumulative number of MetS components or its specific cluster components for HF carried a greater risk among young people than older people. With the risk of HF by the specific clusters of MetS components, the highest risk for future HF was for PGHT among younger participants. The metabolic risk factors have been linked to a greater increase of incident HF risk among young adults than older adults in two previous studies [ 36 37 38 39 [40] [41] [42] In this study, we also observed sex differences in the effect of MetS on the development of future HF with significant interaction between sex and the cumulative number of MetS components (P for interaction <0.001). And the role of specific MetS component clusters in HF risk also differed by sex, in which female with PGH had the highest risk of HF. A systematic review study has assessed the sex-specific association between MetS or its components and the development of CVD and showed a greater elevated risk for CVD in women than men linked to MetS and some of its components, including diabetes and hypertension [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 5 Strengths and limitations The strengths of this study are its prospective cohort design, large sample size, and long follow-up time, allowing us to explore the role of MetS components clusters in HF risk and age or sex specific associations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to comprehensively examine the association of the cumulative burden of MetS components, specific components and clusters with incident HF. However, we should be aware that there are some limitations in our study. First, the study mainly included middle-aged and white participants with higher socioeconomic status than the general population in the UK [ 49 6 Conclusion In summary, the risk of incident HF increased with growing cumulative burden of MetS, but varied by different clusters of MetS components. Although the component of increased blood pressure contributed most to an elevated HF incidence, its effect was attenuated by the component of increased triglycerides, leading to the highest risk in the cluster of PGHW. Besides, the adverse impact of MetS on HF was more pronounced in younger adults or females. This study provided additional information to understand the role of MetS as a potential target for HF prevention, calling for more studies to validate these findings. Central Illustration.
