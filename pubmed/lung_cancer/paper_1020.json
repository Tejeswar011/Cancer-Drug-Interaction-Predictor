This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/399077-marantic-endocarditis-in-malignancy-a-case-report-of-a-challenging-diagnosis Marantic endocarditis is a condition characterized by sterile vegetations in the heart valves, and is much rarer than infectious endocarditis. It’s typically associated with conditions such as cancer or autoimmune diseases. We report the case of a patient with stage four lung cancer, presenting with fever after chemotherapy, and diagnosed with marantic endocarditis, after extensive testing to exclude an infectious agent. The patient’s imaging techniques suggested infectious embolization to the liver and spleen, which supported the diagnostic hypothesis of infectious endocarditis, but the liver biopsy was positive for metastasis. Oncology was consulted for follow-up, and the patient was discharged on anticoagulation therapy, the standard treatment for marantic endocarditis. This case underscores the difficulty of diagnosing marantic endocarditis and the extensive testing required, considering its poor prognosis and the importance of treatment. hypercoagulability states infectious endocarditis lung cancer marantic endocarditis stage four lung cancer vegetations pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Marantic endocarditis (ME) is a rare condition characterized by sterile vegetations in the heart valves, and it is usually associated with hypercoagulability states, such as cancer or autoimmune diseases [ 1 2 3 4 Unlike infective endocarditis, where valve vegetations contain bacteria, ME forms sterile vegetations of fibrin and platelets. Clinically, ME often differs from infective endocarditis because patients may lack fever and other classic signs of infection. While ME is often associated with systemic embolic events, such as ischemic strokes, renal or splenic infarctions, cases without embolic manifestations are exceedingly rare. The absence of embolic events in ME presents a diagnostic challenge, as it can mimic other conditions, leading to delays in appropriate management. Neurological emboli, particularly ischemic strokes, are among the most common and devastating complications, frequently associated with high morbidity and mortality [ 5 Case presentation A 53-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) with fever (measured axillary temperatures above 38ºC) and aqueous nasal discharge. The patient had a history of recently diagnosed lung cancer, with a single cerebral metastasis that had been removed a month prior to admission. At the time of presentation, he was undergoing his first cycle of chemotherapy, having had an administration five days prior to admission. On initial examination in the ED, the patient was alert, oriented, and hemodynamically stable. On auscultation, breath sounds were clear and equal bilaterally, and no heart murmur was noted. Neurological examination revealed no deficit despite the recent brain surgery.

Figure 2 Abdominal ultrasound showing multiple splenic nodules suggestive of infeccious foci Abdominal ultrasound showing splenic nodules that were first thought to be infection but later found to be metastases, after biopsy of one of the hepatic lesions. Figure 3 Abdominal CT-scan showing multiple hepatic and splenic nodules suggestive of infeccious foci Abdominal ultrasound showing splenic nodules that were first thought to be infection but later found to be metastases, after biopsy of one of the hepatic lesions. As fever and leukocytosis prevailed, despite empiric antibiotics, and considering the possibility of infectious endocarditis given the multiple hepatic and splenic foci, a transthoracic echocardiogram was requested. It was inconclusive, but considering the high possibility of this diagnosis, the patient was initiated on empiric antibiotherapy with ampicillin, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin, and a transesophageal echocardiogram was then requested. This last exam revealed an 18 mm long echogenic mass adherent to the wall of the right ventricular chamber, highly suggestive of being an endocarditis vegetation despite the atypical location. Blood cultures were once again repeated, and further investigation of blood (Table 2 Coxiella burnetii Bartonella Mycoplasma pneumonia 2 2 Mycobacterium tuberculosis In the presence of five sequential negative blood cultures, and after consulting with Infectious Diseases, Cardiology, and Radiology, it was decided to get a biopsy of the liver abscesses done in order to try to identify the infectious agent. Contrary to expectations, given the different radiology reports suspecting abscesses, the biopsy was positive for a metastasis of pulmonary origin (with immunohistochemistry showing positivity for CK7, TTF-1, and Napsin A, and negativity for CK20), and the fragments sent for culture in the microbiology laboratory were negative. Once an infectious agent was excluded and the progression of the neoplastic disease documented, the diagnosis of ME was assumed [ 6 Discussion ME, or nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE), is a rare condition most commonly observed in patients with advanced malignancies or hypercoagulable states. While systemic embolic events, such as ischemic strokes, renal or splenic infarctions, are typical, our patient presented without any clinical evidence of embolization, making this case unusual. The patient’s presentation was atypical for ME, with fever and laboratory findings of neutrophilia and elevated CRP features more suggestive of infective endocarditis. This overlap underscores the diagnostic challenge of ME, a rare but potentially serious condition. As a diagnosis of exclusion, ME necessitates a comprehensive workup to rule out infective endocarditis and other etiologies. The ultrasound and CT findings suggesting liver and splenic infectious foci initially supported an infectious etiology, making the final diagnosis even more challenging. Autopsy and echocardiographic studies estimate the incidence of ME at 0.3-9.3% of all endocarditis cases, with higher prevalence in oncology patients, reaching up to 10-15% in some series. Echocardiography, particularly transesophageal echocardiography, remains the mainstay imaging modality for detecting valvular vegetations, and the diagnosis can be assumed once infective endocarditis is excluded in patients with predisposing risk factors such as malignancy [ 7 8 Management primarily involves systemic anticoagulation to reduce thromboembolic risk, with surgical intervention reserved for patients with significant valvular dysfunction or recurrent embolization despite adequate anticoagulation [ 9 7 Despite the absence of embolic events, anticoagulation was initiated. The identification of metastases marked disease progression, after which the patient experienced progressive weight loss and clinical decline. Nevertheless, he was able to spend a full month with his family before transitioning to hospice care. This case highlights the importance of considering ME even in the absence of embolic events and underscores the need for a thorough and systematic evaluation in cancer patients with unexplained valvular vegetations. Non-embolic cases, like ours, may avoid acute thromboembolic complications, but overall prognosis remains poor and is largely dictated by the underlying malignancy [ 10 Conclusions We presented the case of a patient with lung cancer, who was diagnosed with marantic endocarditis (ME) after an extensive workup, including blood cultures, serologies, and PCR for bacterial and fungal DNA, which excluded infective endocarditis. The absence of embolic events made the diagnosis particularly challenging, as the clinical picture was confounded by fever, neutrophilia, and elevated inflammatory markers more suggestive of infective endocarditis, and by radiologic findings that initially mimicked embolic foci but were ultimately metastatic lesions. The patient was treated accordingly with anticoagulation, and no embolic events were reported until his death, which occurred six weeks post diagnosis due to progression of the underlying malignancy. This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for ME even in the absence of embolic events, particularly in patients with advanced cancer and unexplained valvular vegetations. It also highlights the crucial role of echocardiography, thorough microbiological workup, and systematic exclusion of infective etiologies in reaching the correct diagnosis. This case adds to the growing body of literature demonstrating the heterogeneity of ME presentations and emphasizes that while anticoagulation remains the cornerstone of therapy, the overall prognosis is closely tied to the underlying malignancy rather than to ME itself.
