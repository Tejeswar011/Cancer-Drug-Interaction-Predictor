We conducted a cross-sectional study at five HIV clinics in Hong Kong SAR, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand from July 2019 to June 2020 to assess HIV-related stigma and associated factors. Perceived stigma was measured using the 40-item Berger’s HIV Stigma Scale. Depression, substance use, and disability were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test, and the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, respectively. Of 864 participants (88% male, median age 39 years), 97% were on ART, and 5.7% had HIV viral load >1000 copies/mL. Males reported significantly higher stigma score than females (mean 97.5 vs 90.7 ). In the multivariate analysis, higher stigma was associated with older age (difference = 5.3for age 40–50; 3.1 for >50 years vs ≤30 years), moderate to severe depression (+14.3), disability (+6.8), and HIV non-disclosure (+21.2), while being female was associated with lower stigma (−4.6). These findings underscore the high burden of stigma among PWH in the region and highlight the need for integrated stigma screening and interventions addressing mental health, disclosure, and disability in HIV care.

Consequently, the focus has now shifted from merely managing HIV to addressing it as a chronic condition and attempting comorbidities and other factors that affect health and quality of life among PWH ( Legarth et al., 2016 Stigma and mental health are deeply interwined. HIV-related stigma significantly impacts the emotional and psychological well-being of PWH and key populations. This stigma manifests as fear, negative attitudes, exclusion, discrimination and internalized shame. For instance, a study in India revealed that 27% of PWH experienced severe form of stigma, which were associated with a higher likelihood of depression. Furthermore, internalized stigma is found to be closely correlated with an increased risk of mental health disorders ( Charles et al., 2012 Williams et al., 2022 All forms of stigma are linked to depressive symptoms among PWH ( Steward et al., 2008 Aurpibul et al., 2021 Ross et al., 2022 Vance, 2006 Greeff et al., 2010 Holzemer et al., 2009 Ciesla & Roberts, 2001 Yi et al., 2015 HIV stigma not only adversely affects on health outcomes but also contributes to the HIV epidemic by impacting social determinants of health. It influences morbidity, mortality, and overall quality of life for PWH (QOL) ( Charles et al., 2012 Yigit et al., 2020 Zhu et al., 2020 Berger et al., 2001 Li et al., 2020 Meyer, 2003 Calabrese et al., 2016 Edelman et al., 2016 However, HIV stigma in the Asia-Pacific region and its effects on PWH is poorly understood. This study assessed HIV-related stigma, and identify risk factors associated with stigma among PWH in this region. Methods Study design and study population PWH attending routine HIV clinical appointments at five of our sites in Hong Kong SAR, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Thailand, between July 2019 and June 2020 were included in this cross-sectional study. All PWH aged 18 years and older who attended the participating clinics during the study period were approached for participation. Eligibility criteria included the ability to comply with the study procedure and schedule, as well as the provision of written consent. Data collection The 40-item Berger’s Perceived HIV Stigma Scale (HSS) was utilized to assess perceived stigma. The HSS has been validated across diverse populations, including Asian PWH ( Huang et al., 2021 Jimenez et al., 2010 Kamitani et al., 2018 Ruan et al., 2019 Yang et al., 2021 Personalized Stigma (18 items), which measures the consequences of others knowing about one’s HIV status, including rejection, loss of friends, and avoidance by others. Disclosure (10 items), which measures issues related to whether or not individuals tells about their diagnosis, including concerns about revealing one’s HIV status or sharing HIV status. Negative Self-Image or internal stigma (13 items), which measures feelings of inferiority or low self-esteem related to HIV status. Public Attitude (20 items), which assesses the general public’s perceptions of people with HIV. In addition, validated versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST v3.1), World Health Organization (WHO) Disability Assessment Schedule second version (WHODAS 2.0) ( World Health Organization, 2010 HSS, PHQ-9, ASSIST, WHODAS, and WHOQOL-BREF screenings were performed by trained staff or self-administered via tablets. Positive screenings for depression or substance use prompted clinical follow-ups as per local care standards. Participants with suicidal ideation were urgently referred to psychiatrists. A study-specific questionnaire was used to collect data on employment, household income, educational level, HIV disclosure status, recent traumatic events or stressors, and family mental health history. Demographic data (age, sex, ethnicity, and marital status), medical history (comorbid chronic conditions, and sexually transmitted diseases), body weight, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, laboratory data (hemoglobin, complete blood count, lipid profiles, liver function tests, glucose, creatinine, and hepatitis serology), and HIV clinical data (HIV exposure route, date of HIV diagnosis, history of CDC stage C illness, CD4 cell count, HIV viral load (VL), ART regimen and adherence) were extracted from medical records. Statistical analyses We assessed the following outcomes: (i) the mean HIV stigma scores, and (ii) factors associated with HIV-related stigma and its subscales. Sub-optimal adherence was defined as a self-reported outcome of <95% on a Visual Analogue Scale within 30 days. Moderate-to-severe depression was defined as a total PHQ-9 score of 10–27. Moderate-to-high-risk substance use was classified as an ASSIST score ≥11 for alcohol or ≥4 for other substances ( Humeniuk et al., 2010 Factors associated with HIV-related stigma and its subscales were analyzed using multivariable linear regression, adjusting for demographic data, HIV clinical characteristics, and socioeconomic variables such as education, employment, household income, and previous life stressors obtained from the study-specific questionnaires. Covariates with p p Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and STATA software version 16.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA). Ethical consideration Institutional review board approvals were obtained from all participating study sites, the study coordinating center, and the data management center. Study participants provided informed consent during routine clinical visits, using standard informed consent and study information documents. To ensure participant safety, the study included specific procedures for identifying and managing psychological distress. Study staff were trained to review the results of all screening and assessment tools with participants during the same visit, unless declined by the participant. If a participant screened positive for suicidal ideation on the PHQ-9 (score of 1, 2, or 3 on question 9), the site investigator and study principal investigator were immediately notified, and the participant was promptly referred to a site-linked psychiatrist or psychologist for further assessment and care, following local standards. Participants scoring 9 or above on the total PHQ-9 were also referred for mental health evaluation. Those disclosing problematic substance use or concerning sexual risk behaviors were referred to the appropriate site care providers for further support and management. These measures were implemented in accordance with ethical guidelines and aimed to protect participant well-being throughout the study. Results A total of 864 PWH participated in this study, with 88% male. The median age was 39 years (interquartile range (IQR), 31–47). Of these, 65% had a college education, while 32% had primary to high school education. Four hundred and ninety-nine (58%) were employed full-time and 60% had a household income >500 USD per month. 54.1% were men who have sex with men (MSM) and 19.2% had not disclosed their HIV status. The median ART duration was 6 years (IQR 2–11). Regarding mental health, 34 participants (4%) reported a family history of mental illness, 18.6% exhibited moderate to severe depression, and 50.8% were classified as moderate to high-risk substance users. Alcohol use was reported by 64.8%. Participant characteristics are presented in Table 1 Perceived stigma and subscale scores The overall (total) mean perceived stigma score was moderately high at 97.7 (SD ± 20.1). There were significant differences between males (97.5 ± 19.9) and females (90.7 ± 20.87). The mean subscale scores were as follow: Personalized Stigma (40.5 ± 11.0), Disclosure (27.9 ± 4.9), Negative Self-Image (29.9 ± 6), and Public Attitudes (48.9 ± 11.6). Males reported significantly higher scores on all stigma subscales compared to females ( Table 2 Factors associated with total HIV stigma scores In a multivariable model, there is a strong evidence suggesting that older participants experienced higher overall perceived stigma (an increase of 5.3 points, 95% CI 1.9, 8.7, p p p p p p p p Table 3 Among all participants, 58 (6.7%) reported sub-optimal adherence to ART.

Public attitude stigma: Higher scores in this category were associated with older age, moderate to severe depression, high disability score, and both non-disclosure and partial disclosure of their HIV status. Discussion Our cross-sectional study from five Asian countries found that the participants who were older and had moderate to severe depression, high level disability, and who have not disclosed their of HIV status were associated with higher level of perceived stigma. Notably, sex disparities were observed, with males experiencing higher stigma scores than females despite a significant proportion of male participants were MSM. The overall mean stigma score obtained using Berger’s perceived HIV stigma scale was moderately high at 97.7 (SD ± 20.1). This is consistent with previous studies from China ( Li et al., 2018 Zhang et al., 2015 Vlassoff et al., 2012 Li et al., 2016 Parcesepe et al., 2020 Additionally, we found that PWH older than 40 years had higher stigma levels compared to younger PWH, potentially due to age-related comorbidities, family stress and social isolation ( Brown & Adeagbo, 2021 Heckman et al., 2002 Wing, 2016 Brown & Adeagbo, 2021 Our study also identified associations between higher overall perceived stigma scores and moderate to severe depression, as well as HIV non-disclosure status. Individuals with partial or no disclosure of their HIV status experienced higher levels of stigma, including personalized stigma, disclosure-related stigma, and negative self-image. These findings suggest that full disclosure might help mitigate stigma by fostering greater social support and reducing internalized fear ( Takada et al., 2014 Ziersch et al., 2021 Despite the known impact of stigma on engagement with health care services and poor treatment outcomes, only 6.7% of our participants reported suboptimal adherence, and there is no significant association between stigma and HIV outcomes such as HIV viral load or CD4 cells count. These findings are consistent with previous studies ( Cardarelli et al., 2008 Colbert et al., 2013 Franke et al., 2011 Zhu et al., 2020 Similar to other studies from various regions, including China ( Su et al., 2013 Wang et al., 2012 2008 Charles et al., 2012 Li et al., 2009 Do et al., 2010 Nachega et al., 2012 Shamburger-Rousseau et al., 2016 Williams et al., 2022 Levi-Minzi & Surratt, 2014 The Global AIDS Strategy 2021–2026 advocates for integrating mental health services into routine HIV care to address stigma, depression and substance use. However, the mental health screening within HIV clinical settings in the region remains suboptimal ( Parcesepe et al., 2018 Ross et al., 2022 Implementation Guidelines, 2021 Our study has limitations worth noting. First, its cross-sectional design, which limits the ability to assess longitudinal stigma trends or causality. Second, cultural differences between regions may also influence participants’ responses. Third, the study’s methodology does not allow for causal relationships between stigma, depression, substance use, and HIV clinical and treatment outcomes. Last, it is possible that sampling bias may exist, as our participants were recruited from those routinely attending their healthcare facilities, and those with severe stigma, mental health problems or substance use might have dropped out of care. Despite these limitations, our study provides data on stigma levels and associations with depression and quality of life among adults living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region. Conclusions HIV related stigma significantly impacts the physical and mental health of PWH, even among those with regular access to care and had optimal HIV control. Our findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive interventions to address HIV related stigma, particularly for those experiencing multiple stigmas and discrimination. Efforts should focus on strengthening social support networks, training and empowering advocates, implementing public education campaigns, and encouraging open dialogue about stigmatization. Further research is needed to explore effective strategies for supporting mental health, managing HIV status disclosure, and reducing self-stigma among PWH.
