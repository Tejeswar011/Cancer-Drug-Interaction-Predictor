By 2035, resistance to last-resort antibiotics is projected to be 2.1 times higher than that in 2005. Currently, around 7.7 million people die each year from bacterial infections, of which antibiotic-resistant bacteria cause 4.95 million deaths ( Okeke et al., 2024 Gupta et al., 2019 Chu et al., 2024 Holvoet et al., 2013 Onalenna and Rahube, 2022 mcr tet Aminov, 2021 mcr Sun et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2020 Since the discovery of novel tet He et al., 2019 Sun et al., 2019 Zhang et al., 2020 tet Cui et al., 2020 2022 Fan et al., 2024 Fang et al., 2020 tet E. coli tet K. pneumoniae Liu X. et al., 2024 Yue et al., 2024 Zhang et al., 2024 tet Fang et al., 2020 Li et al., 2020 R. ornithinolytica Klebsiella Raoultella Drancourt et al., 2001 Hajjar et al., 2020 R. ornithinolytica R. ornithinolytica Hajjar et al., 2020 Jones et al., 2024 K. pneumoniae bla KPC–2 mcr Xedzro et al., 2023 tmexCD-toprJ Zhu et al., 2023 In this study, a tet R. ornithinolytica R. ornithinolytica K. pneumoniae Materials and methods Sample collection and identification of tet From June 2023 to December 2024, we collected a total of 140 non-repetitive sewage samples during the monitoring of sewage resistance in swine farms in Shandong Province. A total of 140 sewage samples were obtained from 15 different farms distributed across five cities, with each farm contributing between 7 and 14 samples. A total of 50 μl of sewage sample was transferred to 800 μl of LB broth and cultured overnight at 37 degrees with shaking. Then, overnight cultures were inoculated onto LB agar plates containing 2 mg/L tigecycline using an inoculation loop. Detection of common tigecycline resistance genes using PCR in resistant colonies. 16S DNA and Sanger sequencing were used for strain identification. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing Antimicrobial susceptibility of strains was determined by agar dilution method according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines ( Humphries et al., 2018 European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing [EUCAST], 2025 E. coli Conjugation experiments To verify the transferability of the pSD8-1-2 plasmid, filter mating experiment was performed using the E. coli K. pneumoniae E. coli K. pneumoniae Plasmid stability The stability of pSD8-1-2 was investigated by conventional plate count method. Briefly, a single colony of freshly cultured SD8-1 was inoculated into 4 ml of antibiotic-free LB broth and cultured at 37 °C with shaking. The culture was then subcultured in antibiotic-free LB broth at a ratio of 1:1000, subcultured every 12 h, twice a day, for 25 consecutive days. The culture was taken every day, serially diluted, and then inoculated onto antibiotic-free LB agar plates. Following overnight incubation, 50 colonies were randomly selected for PCR amplification of the tet tet Growth curve measurement and statistical analysis Single colonies of all strains to be tested were selected and inoculated into LB broth, and cultured overnight at 37 °C and 200 rpm with shaking. After adjusting the overnight culture to the 0.5 McFarland turbidity standard, it was diluted 1:100 in LB broth. The optical density was measured at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD 600 600 600 μ = ln ⁢ ( OD 2 ) - ln ⁢ ( OD 1 ) t 2 - t 1 The area under the curve (AUC) of the growth curve was calculated using the trapezoidal rule with the formula: AUC = ∑ i = 1 n - 1 ( OD i + OD i + 1 ) 2 ⋅ ( t i + 1 - t i ) All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation ( n t p Mouse bloodstream infection model To verify the pathogenicity of the SD8-1 strain and the effect of the pSD8-1-2 plasmid on tigecycline treatment, we constructed a bloodstream infection model in mice. All experiments were performed in accordance with the principles and procedures in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Wenzhou Medical University. Male BALB/c mice aged 7 weeks were housed and had free access to food and water. Neutropenia was induced in mice by intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide twice, the first dose was 150 mg/kg and the second dose was 100 mg/kg, injected 3 days and 1 day before infection, respectively. Each mouse was injected with 1 × 10 6 Whole-genome sequencing Genomic DNA from a tet R. ornithinolytica de novo 1 2 Liu et al., 2019 R. ornithinolytica Results Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of R. ornithinolytica From June 2023 to December 2024, 38 tet E. coli Enterobacter cloacae Myroides Proteus mirabilis R. ornithinolytica Supplementary Table 1 Genomic analysis of R. ornithinolytica Whole-genome sequencing of SD8-1 was performed using short- and long-read approaches. The genome comprises a 5,489,588 bp chromosome and four plasmids: 78,159, 75,774, 33,222, and 10,755 bp.

T4SS component, antimicrobial resistance, transposases, etc., are marked according to the colors in the legend to indicate their functions. This figure illustrates the syntenic comparison of tet(X)-harboring plasmids. It compares Klebsiella pneumoniae strains from various sources and years, including human, swine, and pork. Homology is shown by shaded regions, with arrows indicating the transcription direction of open reading frames (ORFs). The delta (Δ) symbol marks truncated genes. Functional regions such as T4SS components, antimicrobial resistance genes, and transposases are color-coded to highlight their distribution and conservation across different plasmids.
