Introduction Inflammatory conditions, both chronic and acute, represent a significant global health challenge due to their multifactorial nature and persistent immune dysregulation [ 1 2 3 1.1. Inflammatory Pathways The most critical pro-inflammatory pathways are those that integrate danger sensing with the transcription and release of inflammatory mediators. The NF-κB pathway (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) acts as a central regulator of immune and inflammatory responses [ 4 5 6 Among these components, the NLRP3 inflammasome (NOD-like receptor protein 3) is particularly important [ 7 8 9 In parallel, MAPK cascades (mitogen-activated protein kinases), including ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase), JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase), and p38, transmit stress and inflammatory signals to the nucleus, where they activate transcription factors such as AP-1 (activator protein 1) [ 10 11 Finally, ROS (reactive oxygen species), generated by enzymes like NADPH oxidases or during mitochondrial stress, serve a dual role—they cause oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids, as well as acting as secondary messengers that further activate NF-κB, MAPK, and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling [ 12 Together, these pathways, NF-κB, NLRP3 inflammasome, MAPK cascades, TLR signaling, and ROS production form an interconnected network. This network creates positive feedback loops that are highly effective in mounting acute inflammation [ 13 1.2. Anti-Inflammatory Treatments Despite growing insights into their pathogenesis, the therapeutic options for many inflammatory diseases remain largely palliative. Current clinical strategies typically involve immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, or biologics targeting specific cytokines or immune pathways [ 14 15 In this context, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained attention as a promising new anti-inflammatory treatment [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Due to their low immunogenicity, MSCs are suitable for both autologous and allogenic implants [ 25 26 27 28 29 Understanding these interactions is particularly critical for inflammatory diseases, where the precise modulation of immune activity and oxidative stress is essential for controlling pathology and promoting repair [ 30 To this end, we selected five representative compounds with known anti-inflammatory or redox-regulatory activity—ketorolac and diclofenac (NSAIDs that inhibit cyclooxygenase activity and prostaglandin synthesis) [ 31 32 33 + 34 34 The drugs under consideration in the present paper act on precise points of the above inflammatory pathways. On the one hand, ketorolac and diclofenac inhibit COX-1/COX-2, reducing prostaglandin synthesis and inflammation; this also downregulates the NF-κB and MAPK pathways, decreasing COX-2 expression and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and indirectly limits NLRP3 inflammasome activation [ 32 35 31 33 36 + 34 37 BDNF and VEGF are critical factors secreted by MSCs that play essential roles in modulating and resolving inflammation. BDNF suppresses the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; enhances anti-inflammatory signaling pathways; and mitigates secondary tissue damage [ 38 39 2. Materials and Methods To investigate whether the exposure of MSCs to commonly used anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs alters the composition and therapeutic function of the MSC-derived secretome, we applied the following experimental procedure ( Figure 1 2.1. MSC-Derived Secretome 2.1.1. Cell Cultures Adipose-derived human MSCs (StemPro ® 2 ® ® 2.1.2. MSC Secretome Production To assess whether different drugs influence the molecular content and the effectiveness of the MSC secretome, MSCs were exposed to the five commercially available anti-inflammatory compounds. The cells were divided into one control (MSC-C: control—MSCs without any drug) and five experimental groups. The experimental groups were as follows: MSC-K: MSCs with 100 µM ketorolac (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. K1136-1G, St. Louis, MO, USA); MSC-D: MSCs with 30.7 nM diclofenac (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. D6899-10G); MSC-L: MSCs with 100 µM alpha-lipoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. T5625-1G); MSC-A: MSCs with 100 µM acetylcysteine (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. A7250-5G); and MSC-N: MSCs with 20 M nicotinamide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. No. N0636). MSCs were treated with the corresponding drug for 24 h. Afterwards, 5 × 10 4 The concentrations employed in our study were selected based on evidence from previous reports in the literature. Several independent studies have demonstrated that these concentrations produce consistent and biologically relevant effects in the corresponding experimental models without causing cytotoxicity [ 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 2.1.3. MSC Secretome Evaluation To investigate whether the administration of different drugs influences BDNF and VEGF secretion by MSCs, two ELISA assays were performed (Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. 17164733 and Fisher Scientific, Cat. No. KHGO111). The protocols provided by the manufacturer were followed. Briefly, 50 µL of culture supernatant samples were introduced to wells that were pre-coated with the specific antibodies. Plates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. After that, four washes were performed and a biotin-conjugated secondary antibody was added. Following a 1 h incubation, another four washes were carried out. Streptavidin conjugated to an enzyme was then added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light. Finally, the enzyme substrate was added and absorbance was immediately measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (ELx800, BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). 2.2. Set-Up and Optimization of an In Vitro Cell Inflammation Model 2.2.1. Induction of Cell Inflammation by NaIO 3 To study the effect of the drugs on the secretome produced by the MSCs in the presence of anti-inflammatory drugs, we had to test the efficiency of such a secretome in regulating an inflammatory process, such as, for example, in age-related macular degeneration or in inflammatory bowel diseases. For this reason, we set up an in vitro model of retinal inflammatory conditions based on NaIO 3 50 3 3 4 3 51 52 53 2.2.2. Measuring NaIO 3 The Griess reagent was prepared as follows: a 1% ( w v v v N 3 2 2.2.3. Measuring Cell Metabolic Rate Following NaIO 3 ARPE-19 viability test after treatment with the different secretomes was performed by means of an XTT assay, measuring cellular metabolic activity through the enzymatic reduction of tetrazolium salts [ 54 To evaluate the impact of the different concentrations of NaIO 3 2 Optimal effects were obtained with 10 mM NaIO 3 Section 3.1 3 2.3. Effect of Anti-Inflammatory Drugs on the Efficacy of the MSC Secretome The drugs’ impact on the anti-inflammatory efficacy of the MSC secretome was evaluated by treating the 10 mM NaIO 3 3 2.4. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26). The normality of the data was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. For parametric data, i.e., datasets that followed a normal distribution ( p p p p n p 3. Results 3.1.

The Presence of Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Does Not Impair the Anti-Inflammatory Effect of the MSC Secretome To investigate whether the presence of anti-inflammatory drugs influences MSCs’ anti-inflammatory capacity, we evaluated the effect of their respective secretome on the in vitro NaIO 3 3 No statistically significant differences were observed in NO levels between ARPE-19 cells treated with secretomes produced by MSCs in the presence of drugs and by those treated with the control MSC secretome, in both healthy and inflamed ARPE-19 cells. In healthy cells, the M (IQR) of the NO levels was 12.59 (1.48) in the MSC-C group; 12.59 (0.37) in MSC-K-C; 11.48 (1.11) in MSC-D-C; 11.85 (1.48) in MSC-L-C; 12.22 (2.59) in MSC-A-C; and 14.07 (2.6) in MSC-N-C ( Figure 3 Figure 3 p 3.3. The Presence of Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Does Not Alter BDNF or VEGF Levels in the MSC Secretome To investigate whether the presence of anti-inflammatory drugs influences MSCs’ secretion of key regenerative molecules, the levels of BDNF and VEGF were quantified using specific ELISA assays. These two cytokines are well-recognized mediators of the therapeutic efficacy of the MSC secretome, playing essential roles in promoting cell survival, neuroprotection, angiogenesis, and tissue regeneration. No statistically significant differences were observed in secretome BDNF and VEGF concentrations between secretomes derived from MSCs in the presence of drugs and those from control MSCs in the presence of anti-inflammatory drugs. The M (IQR) of BDNF concentration (ng/mL) was 1.226 (0.102) in the MSC group; 1.200 (0.050) in MSC-K; 1.233 (0.038) in MSC-D; 1.078 (0.110) in MSC-L; 1.211 (0.147) in MSC-A; and 0.9655 (0.1411) in MSC-N ( Figure 4 Figure 4 p 3.4. The Presence of Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Does Not Impair the Pro-Metabolic Effect of the MSC Secretome To assess whether the presence of anti-inflammatory drugs influences MSCs’ secretome efficacy in promoting cell metabolic rate, we evaluated whether the presence of anti-inflammatory drugs induces changes in the MSC secretome’s capability to enhance the metabolic rate of the damaged cells. For this purpose, metabolic rate percentage was measured, after exposing 10 mM NaIO 3 No statistically significant differences were observed in cell metabolic rate between groups treated with secretome produced by MSCs in the presence of drugs and those treated with the control MSC secretome in healthy ARPE-19 cells. The M (IQR) values of cell metabolic rate (%) were 76.67 (38.89) in the MSC group; 65.56 (4.45) in MSC-K-C; 65.56 (16.67) in MSC-D-C; 63.33 (7.78) in MSC-L-C; 65.56 (7.78) in MSC-A-C; and 71.11 (5.55) in MSC-N-C ( Figure 5 Figure 5 p 4. Discussion MSC-based therapies are gaining increasing importance in the fields of regenerative medicine and immunotherapy, due to their potent anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-apoptotic, and pro-regenerative properties [ 25 55 56 57 58 This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the presence of clinically relevant anti-inflammatory drugs on the secretory profile of MSCs, as well as their functional therapeutic properties. In the present study, AD-MSCs were selected, as they represent the most widely used source in clinical applications and are considered broadly representative, given that, as discussed previously, MSCs from different tissue origins exhibit largely comparable functional and paracrine properties. The drugs employed are relevant and directly involved in the inflammatory pathways, as detailed in the Introduction. Although a single in vitro inflammatory model was utilized, it is a well-established and extensively used system, supporting the representativeness and translational relevance of the observed findings. Our results show that the functional efficacy of the MSC secretome was preserved, since its ability to exert an anti-inflammatory effect was not affected by the presence of any of the five anti-inflammatory drugs, supporting the possibility of delivering a drug–secretome combined treatment. These findings align with a growing body of literature examining the effects of the presence of anti-inflammatory drugs on MSCs [ 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 Most importantly, although significantly compromised in the presence of four of the five drugs tested in the study, the cell metabolic rate was maintained at over 65% values when treated with secretomes produced in the presence of anti-inflammatory drugs. Collectively, these findings support the robustness of MSCs as a therapeutic tool in inflammatory contexts and suggest that pre-exposure to selected drugs does not compromise their functional efficacy, secretory profile, or anti-inflammatory properties. This insight is critical for the potential clinical application of MSC-based therapies, particularly in settings where patients may be receiving concurrent drug treatments. Although only a single MSC type was employed, as discussed in previous responses, this does not constitute a major limitation, given that MSCs from different sources exhibit largely comparable properties. Regarding the inflammatory model, it is a well-established and widely used system in experimental studies and is therefore considered representative of inflammatory responses. Nevertheless, for clinical translation, it would be important to evaluate additional models to confirm whether the observed effects are consistent, as well as subsequently extending these findings to in vivo settings. 5. Conclusions The primary conclusion of this study is that the exposure of MSCs to the tested pharmacological agents does not significantly alter their BDNF or VEGF content, nor does it impact their anti-inflammatory or pro-metabolic activities within the employed inflammatory model. Exposure to specific pharmacological agents can be compatible with, or even beneficial for, maintaining and potentially augmenting the functional properties of MSCs without compromising their therapeutic efficacy [ 66 67 By clarifying the impact of clinically relevant anti-inflammatory drugs on MSC-derived secretomes, this work offers critical insight into the design of robust and compatible MSC-based therapies, particularly in the context of combinatory treatments for inflammatory diseases. While this work provides valuable findings, certain aspects could be further explored in future research. Expanding the panel of drugs may offer a broader understanding of the drug-induced modulation of the MSC secretome. The cell damage model employed could be applied to other cell lines; nevertheless, incorporating additional models, including primary human cells, would strengthen translational relevance. Finally, although two key secretome components (BDNF and VEGF) were analyzed, extending the molecular profiling could yield a more comprehensive view of the effects observed.
