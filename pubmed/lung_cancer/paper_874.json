Summary Recent advances in vaccine technology have positioned messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines as safe and reliable options for human use. Conventionally, mRNA vaccines were designed using linear or self-amplifying mRNA (SAM), the latter considered to be superior. Subsequent studies on Circular mRNA (Circ-RNA) vaccines proved their efficacy. Here, we compared the efficacy of SAM- and Circ-RNA vaccines using the SARS-CoV-2-RBD (receptor binding domain) antigen. Both SAM-RBD and Circ-RBD induced a comparable anti-RBD IgG titer and virus-neutralizing antibody titer. However, the latter induced a higher memory T cell response. The Circ-RBD vaccine is stable for 4 weeks at 4°C. A bivalent vaccine containing Circ-RBD of both delta and omicron SARS-CoV-2 variants potently neutralized these viruses. These findings demonstrate Circ-RNA-RBD as an excellent vaccine candidate against COVID-19 and also provide a platform for developing bivalent Circ-RNA vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses with rapidly emerging variants.

Comirnaty, the first FDA (United States food and drug administration)-approved COVID-19 vaccine (developed by Pfizer-BioNTech) and Spikevax (COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna), both mRNA vaccines, were pivotal in controlling the COVID-19. Since then, there is considerable momentum to develop mRNA vaccines against multiple pathogens, allergic diseases, and cancer. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 in vitro 7 1 , 2 , 8 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 Linear mRNA-encoding the vaccine antigen is generally small in size (compared to the SAM), contains a methyl-guanosine cap analog at the 5′’-end, poly A-tailed at the 3′’-end, and the antigen-encoding sequence is flanked by untranslated regions (UTR) at both sides. A major challenge of linear mRNA-based vaccines is the low stability of the input mRNA. The stability of the linear mRNAs is increased by incorporating pseudo-uridine or N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) into the sequence. 13 , 14 15 16 17 , 18 8 Circular RNAs (Circ-RNA) are covalently closed single-stranded RNAs without free 5′- and 3′- ends. It is produced naturally through back-splicing, which involves the connection of the 3′- end of an exon to the 5′- end of another exon, creating a close loop RNA. The circular structure provides resistance to most of the RNases except RNase A, RNase T1, and RNase T2, thus significantly increasing their half-life compared to linear mRNAs. Endogenous Circ-RNAs act as miRNA sponges to regulate various cellular processes by binding to nucleic acids and proteins, thereby modulating transcription and cellular signaling pathways. 19 20 , 21 9 , 22 9 , 12 H 9 SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the coronavirus-induced disease-19 (COVID-19), is responsible for the worst global pandemic of the 21 st https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19 23 , 24 25 , 26 , 27 15 , 28 , 29 Being the viral outer surface protein, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is the main target for vaccine development. The receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, which accounts for one-fifth of the total protein, produced over 90% of the neutralizing antibody in infected patients. 30 In the present study, we compared the immunogenicity and virus neutralization potential of the Circ-RNA and SAM-RNA vaccine candidates using the SARS-CoV-2-RBD as the vaccine antigen. Although both Circ-RBD (Circ-RNA backbone) and SAM-RBD (SAM-RNA backbone) elicited comparable humoral and neutralizing antibody responses, the former induced a significantly higher T H Del Omi Results Production and characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 SAM-RBD and Circ-RBD vaccine formulations The self-splicing property of the Anabaena intron (Group 1) was utilized to generate the Circ-RNA encoding the SARS-CoV-2-RBD (Wuhan isolate) fused to the CD5 signal sequence (SS) and the sequence encoding the trimerization motif of bacteriophage T4 fibritin (foldon) at the N- and C- terminus, respectively (Nucleotide sequences presented in Table S1 22 in-vitro 22 Figure 1 In-vitro Figure 1 Figure S1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figures 1 Figure S1 Figure S1 Figure S1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Production and characterization of the self-amplifying and circular RNA vaccine candidates (A) Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of in vitro (B) Agarose gel electrophoresis analysis of in vitro (C) Average particle size of SAM-RBD-RNA-LNP and Circ-RBD-RNA-LNP complex.

Given their ability to replicate inside the host, SAM-RNAs express the antigen for a longer duration with a lesser amount of the input RNA. Analogous to the SAM-RNA, Circ-RNAs also offer the advantage of expression of the antigen for a longer duration with a lesser amount of the input RNA, owing to their higher stability. On top of that, Circ-RNA vaccines do not produce any additional exogenous protein in the target cells, lack open 5′- and 3′-ends and do not produce double-strand RNA (dsRNA) in the target cell, all of which are potential unwanted features in the SAM vaccine. Therefore, Circ-RNA vaccines appear to be more promising than the linear mRNA and SAM vaccines. Comparison between linear mRNA and Circ-RNA vaccines have demonstrated the superiority of the later. 9 SAM-RNA was produced using the SFV replication machinery. SFV replicon was opted as there are very few reports of SFV infection in human, with very mild symptoms and no instances of mortality. SFV replicon has been used in earlier studies for heterologous protein expression and a recently it has been used to produce a vaccine candidate against the Ebola virus. 34 , 35 36 The Anabaena permuted intron-exon sequence was used to produce the Circ-RNA and CVB3 IRES-mediated translation was used to produce the secretory signal and foldon fused-RBD protein in the target cells. Circ-RNA vaccine production using the above vector has been reported and well characterized. 9 37 8 In order to compare the SAM-RBD vaccine with the Circ-RBD vaccine, it was important that both vaccine antigens were expressed at comparable levels and did not induce the host innate immune response. Western blot analysis using anti-RBD antibody and RT-qPCR analysis of the ISGs confirmed that both vaccine candidates expressed similar levels of the vaccine antigen initially and evaded the host innate immune pathway RNA sensors, respectively. However, there was a marked reduction in RBD RNA and protein levels at later time points (between 72 and 96 h) in SAM-RBD-LNP transfected cells, suggesting that SAM-RBD RNA was less stable than the Circ-RBD RNA. This might account for lesser efficacy of the SAM-RBD vaccine.

Circ-RBD immunization induced peak anti-RBD IgG titer at 4 weeks, which protected the mice from COVID-19 like disease pathology when SARS-CoV-2 infection was initiated in the lower respiratory tract (severe disease, often leading to lethality). Nine month follow up study of the anti-RBD IgG titer and the virus neutralization titer (NT 50 50 50 50 43 Finally, we evaluated the functional efficacy of a bivalent Circ-RBD vaccine. Failure of monovalent vaccines in preventing COVID-19 for a longer period is ascribed to emergence of newer variants of the SARS-CoV-2 containing escape mutations in the RBD region. Bivalent vaccines based on linear mRNA platform or nanoparticle platform expressing the spike protein or RBD region of the spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2-Delta and Omicron variants have shown cross-protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. 28 , 29 , 33 While designing a Circ-RBD based vaccine, it is important to note that numerous circular RNAs are endogenously produced in the host. In addition to encoding small peptides, they play important biological roles by regulating the host transcription, splicing, and acting as miRNA sponges. Endogenous Circ-RNAs contain N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) modification, which marks them as “self” molecules and enables them to evade the innate immune sensors. 44 45 In summary, the current study compared the immunogenicity and virus neutralization efficacy of the SAM and Circ-RNA vaccine candidates encoding the SARS-CoV-2-RBD antigen, which revealed similar humoral immune response and virus neutralization potential of both vaccines and a superior cell-mediated immune response induced by the later. Our data also showed better stability of the Circ-RNA vaccine at 4°C, high durability of the neutralizing antibody response induced by it, and high virus neutralization efficacy of the bivalent Circ-RNA vaccine, all of which support the use of Circ-RNA technology in vaccine development. An earlier study showed the superiority of the SARS-CoV-2 Circ-RNA vaccine over the corresponding linear mRNA vaccine. Data obtained from this study further support the use of the Circ-RNA technology for vaccine development. Limitations of the study Our study is limited to comparing the vaccine efficacy of SAM-RBD and Circ-RBD in mice. Experiments in non-human primates such as rhesus macaques offer better conditions, closer to the immune parameters in humans. Production of a homogenous population of SAM and circular RNAs needs to be further optimized. Although circular RNA is smaller in size compared to the SAM RNA, resulting in a higher yield of the former by in vitro transcription, complete circularization of the in vitro Resource availability Lead contact Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Milan Surjit ( milan@thsti.res.in Materials availability Materials generated in the study are available upon request.

African green monkey kidney epithelial cells (VeroE6; ATCC Cat#CRL-1586) were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) with 10% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. All cell cultures were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 Viral strains SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan isolate (NR-52281, SARS-related coronavirus-2 isolate ISA-WA1/2020) and Omicron Variants (B.1.1.529, NR56461, SARS-related coronavirus-2 isolate hCoV-19/USA/MD-HP20874/2021) were obtained from BEI Resources, amplified in Vero E6 cells in the BSL3 facility of THSTI, India, titrated and stored frozen in aliquots. SARS-CoV-2-Delta (SARS-CoV-2/human/IND/THSTI_287/2021) was isolated from clinical sample at THSTI and has been reported (GenBank: MZ356566.1 46 Mice Mice were housed in pathogen free condition in individually ventilated cages at the experimental animal facility of THSTI. For SARS-CoV-2 infection experiments, animals were housed in the animal biosafety level-3 (ABSL-3) laboratory of THSTI, following Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBSC) guidelines. Institutional animal ethics committee (approval no. IAEC/THSTI/228), IBSC (approval no. THS/459/2022) and RCGM (approval no. BT/IBKP/137/2020) approval was obtained for the experiments. The mice room was maintained at 19°C–26°C with humidity between 30 and 70% and a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle. 6–8 weeks old, male and female mice were randomly allocated to experimental groups, and the number of animals used in the experiments is specified in the figure. Method details Plasmids Plasmid encoding the noninfectious Semliki Forest virus replicon (pSFV3) was a gift from Henrik Garoff (Addgene plasmid # 92072; http://n2t.net/addgene:92072 34 Wuhan Del Omi Table S1 In vitro pSFV3-RBD, pUC57 cRNA-RBD Wuhan Del Omi in vitro in vitro 2 22 Purification of RNA by HPLC RNA was heated at 65°C for 3 min and subsequently cooled on ice for another 3 min. The RNA was then passed through a size-exclusion column of particle size of 5 μm and a pore size of 2000 Å (Sepax Technologies; 215980P-4630) by utilizing the e2695 Separations Module (Waters). The RNA was resolved in RNase-free TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH: 6) at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. RNA was detected by UV absorbance at 260 nm. The collected RNA fractions were purified and concentrated using the RNeasy kit. Preparation and characterization of the RNA-LNP vaccine formulation SM102, DSPC, Cholesterol and DMG-PEG 2000 were mixed at a molar ratio of 50:10:38.5:1.5 in absolute ethanol at 1/5 of the final LNP amount. An aqueous solution of RNeasy kit (silica-based spin column)-purified RNA was prepared by diluting it in 50 mM acetate buffer (1.2 mM sodium acetate, 4 mM acetic acid, pH 4.0) at 4/5 of the final LNP volume. Note that both HPLC column and silica spin column-purified RNA showed similar purity in agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry. Hence, silica spin column-purified RNA was used in all subsequent experiments due to ease of operation. The two solutions were mixed using a microfluidics system (ElveFlow Elvesys, France) at a flow rate ratio of 1:5. The resulting RNA-LNP complex was dialyzed with phosphate buffered saline (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na 2 4 2 4 2 Transfection HEK293T cells were seeded on 6 well plates (8 × 10 5 Western blot assay For western blot analysis under reducing condition, samples (cells or culture medium) were incubated at 95°C for 5 min in Laemlli buffer (2% SDS, 13% glycerol, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromophenol blue and 63 mM Tris HCl, pH 6.8). For non-reducing condition, β-merceptoethanol was omitted from the Laemlli buffer. Total protein in the samples was quantified by Bicinchoninic acid assay and equal amount of protein were resolved in SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skimmed milk, incubated with anti-Spike S1 or anti-GAPDH antibody at 1:5000 dilution. Anti-Rabbit secondary antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution. Protein bands were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent, using a commercially available kit (BioRad, USA) and visualized in a gel Documentation system (Chemidoc MP, Bio Rad, USA). RT-qPCR assay For RT-qPCR analysis of genes involved in the antiviral response pathway, total RNA of HEK293T cells transfected with SAM-RBD or Circ-RBD RNA or Poly I:C were isolated using the TRI-reagent (MRC, Massachusetts, USA), followed by reverse transcription (RT) using the Firescript cDNA synthesis kit (Solis Biodyne, Estonia). The relative transcript levels of different genes were determined by SYBR green based RT-qPCR, as described. 46 For RT-qPCR analysis in the mouse lung tissue, total RNA was isolated from 10 mg lung tissue using TRI reagent, following manufacturer’s instruction. cDNA synthesis and RT-qPCR was done as mentioned above. HPRT RNA level was quantified for normalization of data.

Mice immunization Male and Female Balb/c mice of 6–8 weeks old were intradermally injected on the back of the animal with 10 μg of SAM-RBD or Circ-RBD twice at two-weeks interval. In the case of intramuscular injection, mice were injected in the hind leg muscle. All injections were in 100 μL volume. Placebo animal received 100 μL PBS. Blood was collected at the indicated time points through retro-orbital sinus using a sterile hematocrit capillary tube. Wherever indicated, mice were euthanized by anesthetic overdose (Ketamine 300 mg/kg and xylazine 30 mg/kg) and blood, spleen and lungs were collected. Serum was isolated from the blood by centrifugation at 10,000 g SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice Replication deficient adenovirus expressing human ACE2 (Ad5CMV-hACE2, denoted as hACE2) was transduced through intranasal or intratracheal route. 31 , 32 8 32 31 8 5 ELISA The Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was performed as described, with below mentioned modifications. 48 Flow cytometry Splenocytes were isolated and live cells were counted using trypan blue. The cells were cultured in RPMI-10 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin antibiotic. After 3 h, the RBD peptide pool (2 μg/mL each peptide), along with PMA-Ionomycin controls and Golg-iStop (BD), were added to the culture medium for 6 h. Unstimulated cells were maintained in parallel. Cells were blocked with FC-block at room temperature for 15 min and stained with anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8 and anti-CD44. Following the surface staining, cells were fixed and permeabilised. Intracellular cytokine (IFNγ, TNFα and IL-4) staining was performed using respective antibodies. Cells were acquired using the BD FACS-aria (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using the FlowJo software (FlowJo LLC, Oregon, USA), as reported. 9 , 49 https://figshare.com/s/61b536f9f2e238756556 Quantification of viral load by plaque assay For quantification of SARS-CoV-2 level in the lungs, 5 mg of lung tissue was homogenised in 1 mL serum free DMEM and sterilized using 0.2 μm filter. The homogenate was serially diluted 10-fold and added to 2 × 10 5 2 Plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) 50% virus neutralization efficiency (NT 50 Wuhan Wuhan 50 5 2 50 Focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT) NT 50 4 2 Histopathology Histopathology analysis of the lung tissue samples were performed by the histology service of the experimental animal facility of THSTI, following established protocol. Briefly, lung tissues were kept in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution immediately after collection. After ensuring proper fixation, samples were subjected to processing and paraffin embedded blocks were prepared. 4 μm thick sections were cut using a semi-automatic microtome (Histocore Multicut- Leica Biosystem, Germany) and mounted on glass slides. The sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin, following standard operating procedures of the facility. Slides were analyzed by a qualified histopathologist, following blind evaluation method. Semi-quantitative scoring system was adopted to score the pathological conditions, 0 indicating absence of a pathological condition while 5 indicating its highest severity. Pathological conditions such as; bronchiolitis, vasculitis, interstitial pneumonia, alveolitis and haemorrhage were analyzed and scored. Images were visualized and captured using a Bright field upright microscope (CX43RF- Olympus Life science Solutions, Japan) equipped with a color camera (DP28- Olympus Life science Solutions, Japan) and imaging software (cellSens Entry- Olympus Life science Solutions, Japan) at 200X magnification.
