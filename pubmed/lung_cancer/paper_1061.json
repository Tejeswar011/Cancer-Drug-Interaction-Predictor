This study aims to determine the prognostic value of preoperative serum ALB plus CEA levels as a new biomarker in patients with resectable gastric cancer. This retrospective cohort study included 329 patients with gastric cancer. The optimal cutoff values of ALB and CEA were 4.77 ng/mL and 41.47 g/L, respectively. Patients were stratified into three groups based on these cutoff values: ALB–CEA = 0 (ALB > 41.47 g/L and CEA ≤ 4.77 ng/mL), ALB–CEA = 1 (ALB ≤ 41.47 g/L or CEA > 4.77 ng/mL), and ALB–CEA = 2 (ALB ≤ 41.47 g/L and CEA > 4.77 ng/mL). Kaplan–Meier curve and Cox proportional model were used to determine the predictive effect of the biomarker on the overall survival of patients in the training and validation sets. ALB–CEA had a larger area under the curve than ALB or CEA alone (0.703, 0.671, 0.635 in the validation set; 0.776, 0.694, 0.616 in the validation set respectively). The Kaplan–Meier curve revealed that higher ALB–CEA scores were indicative of lower survival rates ( p p Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-18102-x.

These biomarkers can predict, facilitating personalized treatment strategies for various gastric cancer subtypes post-surgery and enabling the development of effective postoperative treatment plans for more patients with cancer 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 The discovery of tumor markers constitutes a pivotal advancement in tumor diagnosis and treatment. Over recent years, these markers have not only provided valuable diagnostic insights but have also assumed a significant role in prognostic evaluation. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), among these markers, was discovered by Gold and Freedman 13 14 15 16 17 21 22 Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the predictive efficacy of CEA combined with albumin (ALB–CEA) as a new biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. Materials and methods This retrospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Dalian Medical University (Approval No. KY2024-045-01). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, Dalian Medical University Institutional Review Board waived the need of obtaining informed consent’ in the manuscript. This cohort study retrospectively evaluated 329 consecutive patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma who underwent radical gastrectomy at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University from January 2010 to February 2017, with temporal stratification into a training set (January 2010–December 2015, n = 164) and validation set (January 2016–February 2017, n = 165) to assess preoperative ALB–CEA levels (exposure) for postoperative survival outcomes (e.g., overall survival), thereby establishing exposure-outcome temporality. The inclusion criteria were: (1) radical gastrectomy for histologically confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma; (2) complete preoperative data (including sex, age, TNM stage, serum albumin, CEA levels, survival status, and other clinical variables); (3) no neoadjuvant therapy; (4) no distant metastasis (confirmed by preoperative imaging and intraoperative exploration). The exclusion criteria were: (1) residual/recurrent gastric cancer; (2) other malignancies; (3) distant metastasis (preoperatively or intraoperatively confirmed); (4) emergency/palliative surgery or major systemic comorbidities (e.g., decompensated cirrhosis, renal failure [eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 Statistical analysis The optimal cutoff values of ALB and CEA in the training set were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and ALB–CEA scores were subsequently derived based on these values (Table 1 1 p  Table 1 Prognostic scores of CEA, ALB and ALB–CEA.

Among these patients, 105 (64.0%) were aged 60 years or older, while 59 (36.0%) were younger than 60 years. For the validation set, 165 patients with gastric cancer were included, consisting of 113 males (68.5%) and 52 females (31.5%). Within this group, 108 patients (65.5%) were aged 60 years or older, while 57 patients (34.5%) were younger than 60 years. The similar proportions in sex (70.1% vs. 68.5% male) and age (64.0% vs. 65.5% ≥ 60 years) suggest balanced cohort characteristics. Supplementary Table S1 Relationship between preoperative ALB and CEA and clinicopathological features Preoperative ALB and CEA levels were correlated with postoperative survival and clinicopathological features in the two groups (Supplementary Table S1 Optimal cutoff values for ALB and CEA In the training set, the optimal cutoff values for CEA and ALB for predicting OS were 4.77 ng/mL and 41.47 g/L, respectively (Fig. 1 1 1  Fig. 1 Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis of ALB, CEA, and ALB–CEA for OS in patients with gastric cancer [(the training set ( A B Prognostic value of ALB and CEA levels The prognostic value of CEA and ALB levels was evaluated using Kaplan–Meier analysis, and the results revealed that the low CEA group exhibited significantly higher OS rates compared to the high CEA group. Similar findings were obtained for median OS time. Additionally, the high ALB group displayed elevated OS rates and longer median OS times compared to the low ALB group. These findings remained consistent across both the training and validation sets (Supplementary Fig. S1 Prognostic analysis based on ALB–CEA score The pathological and clinical characteristics of patients stratified by ALB–CEA score are presented in Supplementary Table S2 Univariate and multivariate survival analysis The univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that ALB–CEA was an influencing factor for OS among patients with gastric cancer post-surgery.

Predictive performance of ALB–CEA compared to CEA or ALB alone The scoring criteria developed were applied to the training set to facilitate a more intuitive comparison between ALB–CEA and CEA or ALB alone as predictors of the AUC, alongside testing the adaptability of the training set to the scoring criteria. The C-index, AUC, and AIC were used to evaluate the predictive performance of the ALB–CEA score versus ALB or CEA alone (Fig. 3 S3 3 S3 3 S3 4  Fig. 3 The ROC curves of CEA, ALB and ALB–CEA grade for predicting overall survival in the training set and validation set [(the training set ( A B  Fig. 4 DCA for OS of three assessment methods [(the training set ( A B Discussion Hematological biomarkers identified from peripheral blood samples, such as CEA and albumin, are easy to obtain and inexpensive and can predict the prognosis of patients with cancer. This study reaffirms the association between peripheral blood biomarkers in patients with resectable gastric cancer and their final clinical outcomes. Previous studies have established correlations between lower preoperative albumin levels, higher CEA levels, older age, lower degree of differentiation, later postoperative pathological stage, deeper depth of invasion, greater number of lymph node metastasis, presence of vascular tumor thrombus, nerve invasion, and poor prognosis. In the cohort of 329 patients studied, ALB–CEA scores were associated with prognosis, with higher scores indicating a higher likelihood of poor prognosis and tumor progression. Consequently, ALB–CEA emerges as a novel prognostic biomarker strongly indicative of the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer, owing to the association between patient-tumor characteristics and tumor progression. The optimal cutoff values for ALB (41.47 g/L) and CEA (4.77 ng/mL) were determined by maximizing the Youden index in ROC analysis. These thresholds were clinically justified: the ALB cutoff is consistent with mild hypoalbuminemia (< 40 g/L) associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer 23 24 25 26 27 26 27 Gastric cancer is a digestive tract tumor, characterized by a high risk of recurrence and metastasis. Its prognosis is worse compared to colon cancer. Previous studies have demonstrated that preoperative evaluation plays a pivotal role in the treatment of gastric cancer. Therefore, exploring an easy and accessible preoperative prognostic factor is beneficial to identify those patients who may have a poor prognosis and to provide them with an individualized treatment plan. Malnutrition is pervasive among tumor patients due to prolonged illness. Given the gastrointestinal tract’s crucial role in digestion and absorption, patients with gastrointestinal tumors are particularly prone to malnutrition. ALB level, commonly used to evaluate nutritional status in clinical practice, has recently been used to predict the prognosis of tumors. Studies have consistently associated hypoalbuminemia with poor prognosis in various malignancies, including lung, breast, gastric, and colon cancers 28 32 33 38 26 27 The ALB–CEA prediction model proposed in this study has demonstrated notable success in predicting the prognosis of gastric cancer patients, as evidenced by its performance in both the training set of 164 patients and the validation set of 165 patients. In both sets, the AUC for ALB–CEA surpassed that for CEA or ALB, indicating its effectiveness and superiority as a prognostic predictor for patients undergoing radical surgery for gastric cancer. Moreover, the performance of the ALB–CEA model compared favorably with other combined biomarkers proposed in recent years, further substantiating its novelty and efficacy. Various validation methods were employed to evaluate the accuracy and robustness of this novel biomarker. Undeniably, there are several limitations to this study. First, being a single-center, retrospective study, there exists a potential for selection bias, compounded by the relatively modest sample size. A larger sample size and inclusion of patients from different geographic regions could have reduced the potential bias in the retrospective study design, resulting in more accurate results. Second, differences in the type of surgery and postoperative chemotherapy regimen can also influence patients’ postoperative OS, potentially impacting the accuracy of the ALB–CEA scoring system. Third, the lack of disease-free survival data limits a comprehensive assessment of prognostic outcomes for patients with gastric cancer. Fourth, while we adjusted for key clinicopathological variables, unmeasured confounders including variations in adjuvant chemotherapy regimens (e.g., drug combinations, cycle numbers) and baseline comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes) may influence survival outcomes. Therefore, future research endeavors should focus on multi-center, prospective studies with larger sample sizes to confirm the predictive efficacy of ALB–CEA for the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. Conclusion In summary, our retrospective study highlights preoperative ALB–CEA as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer. We demonstrated that ALB–CEA outperforms ALB or CEA alone in evaluating prognosis and confirmed the robustness of this prediction model using various methods. This novel biomarker has the advantages of convenience, low cost, and high reproducibility. Future multi-center prospective studies should validate ALB–CEA’s prognostic utility across diverse populations while comparing its performance with established inflammatory markers (e.g., NLR, PLR) to optimize clinical decision-making.
