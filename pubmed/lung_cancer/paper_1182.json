Due to the vasodilatation caused by nitrogen monoxide, NO-donors have been shown to protect endothelial function, acting as vasodilators, promoting efficient oxygen supply to tissues, to lower blood pressure, and to inhibit platelet aggregation. Incorporation of a NO-liberating moiety in the structure of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs results in anti-inflammatory agents that are safer for the gastrointestinal system. In this research, ibuprofen and naproxen, two commonly applied non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), non-selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenases, were used to design novel anti-inflammatory agents able to release NO in the organism. Thus, the NSAIDs were amidated with beta-alanine and L-proline, which were able to incorporate the 2-nitro-oxyethyl moiety as the NO donor. The resulting compounds were anti-inflammatory agents, found to be more potent than the mother drugs, demonstrating remarkable inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1 and the ability to release NO in vitro. Furthermore, two of the most active anti-inflammatory compounds proved to be effective hypolipidemic agents, decreasing plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL-cholesterol in hyperlipidemic rats significantly. The most effective compound in all the above tests was the ibuprofen derivative 5, which inhibited COX-2 by 95%, decreased inflammation by 73%, and reduced all lipidemic indices by more than 50%. Furthermore, docking experiments of compound 5 on the active sites of COX-1 and COX-2 showed that it interacts intensely with the binding site of COX-2, and the binding energy is equivalent to that of the relevant to celecoxib selective COX-2 inhibitor 4-[5-(4-bromophenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl] benzenesulfonamide (SC-5580). In conclusion, the performed structural modifications resulted not only in the improvement of the anti-inflammatory activity, compared with the parent NSAID, but also acquired strong hypolipidemic activity. Thus, the combination of structural characteristics resulting in a decrease in lipidemia, with possible inhibition of atherosclerosis, due to their anti-inflammatory activity and vasodilatation ability, via the liberated NO, may constitute a useful rationale for new compounds. ibuprofen naproxen anti-inflammatory activity cyclooxygenase inhibition NO release hypolipidemic activity COX-2 binding This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Inflammation, a defensive mechanism of the organism, is a major factor for the progression of conditions such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer [ 1 2 Nitrogen monoxide (NO), an endogenous, highly diffusible, lipophilic, nitrogen-centered free radical, is a pleiotropic-signaling molecule that plays an important role in nervous, cardiovascular, and immune systems. In the gastrointestinal track, NO controls gastrointestinal blood flow as well as vascular and mucosal integrity [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 10 13 14 15 16 17 18 In this investigation, the synthesis of derivatives of two widely used nonspecific COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors, ibuprofen and naproxen, is presented. These acids are amidated with beta-alanine and L-proline. In previous investigations, we have found that amidation of NSAID with amino acids enhances the anti-inflammatory activity of the parent drugs [ 19 20 The final compounds were prepared by esterification of the amino acid carboxylic groups with 2-(nitrooxy)ethanol (compounds 5–8 Scheme 1 9 7 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Synthesis Beta-alanine methyl ester hydrochloride (methyl 3-aminopropanoate hydrochloride) and L S 19 The NSAIDs reacted with the amino acid methyl esters in the presence of N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and trimethylamine, to give the respective amides. Methyl esters were hydrolyzed by a NaOH solution in water/dioxane. Subsequent acidification led to the corresponding acids, with minor differences in the reaction time and yields (68–98%) [ 19 The final products were obtained from the esterification of the carboxylic group of the intermediate amides with 2-nitrooxyethanol or 1,2-dihydroxyethane, using DCC in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), with yields of 60–86% ( Scheme 2 1 13 2.2. In Vitro Studies 2.2.1. Inhibition of Cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and-2 Activity Cyclooxygenases-1 and-2 catalyze the production of prostanoids from arachidonic acid. The constitutively expressed COX-1 participates in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. In the gastrointestinal tract, it protects gastric mucosa through continuous production of cytoprotective prostaglandins, especially of PGE2 and PGI2 [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 The effect of the synthesized compounds, as well as that of ibuprofen and naproxen, used as reference compounds, (concentration 0.05 μM) on both COX isoforms, was examined. The concentration of the substrate, arachidonic acid, was 0.1 μM. Results are shown in Table 1 All nitric esters offered lower or similar inhibition of COX-1 activity, compared with the parent NSAID, with the exception of 8 5 7 7 9 7 5 2.2.2. Inhibition of Lipoxygenase (LOX) Activity Lipoxygenases (LOX) are cytosolic enzymes with a non-heme iron in their active site. They catalyze the insertion of two oxygen atoms into polyunsaturated fatty acids which contain the cis As COX inhibition may lead to upregulation of the lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway for the metabolism of arachidonic acid, parallel LOX inhibition may weaken the appearance of adverse effects [ 27 5-Lipoxygenase activity contributes to atherosclerosis via oxidation of low-density lipoprotein. Furthermore, studies using 5-lipoxygenase-deficient mice show that 5-lipoxygenase activity may contribute to stress and depression behavior. Soybean lipoxygenase-1 can use arachidonic acid as substrate, with about 15% of activity for linoleic acid. Arachidonic acid binding sites in plant lipoxygenases possess almost the same similarity as animal 5-lipoxygenase [ 28 29 The effect of the synthesized compounds and of the parent NSAIDs on lipoxygenase is presented in Table 2 50 30 We applied the same procedure but using a higher concentration of linoleic acid than the saturating substrate concentration (1 mM) and we observed no inhibition. These results indicate that the examined compounds may act as competitive inhibitors of lipoxygenase, since inhibition declines by increasing substrate concentration. Ibuprofen and naproxen demonstrated low inhibition of LOX ( Table 2 The effect of the most active compounds 5 7 Figure 1 2.2.3. General Remarks on Enzyme Inhibition Assays Concerning the effects of the compounds on the activities of both enzymes (COX and LOX) and the possible interference of the liberated NO in the assays, a possible involvement might be due to the antioxidant activity of NO, or to the interference of NO with the oxidation state of iron (heme for COX, or nonheme for LOX). Long (45 min) incubation of these compounds with Fe 2+ Section 2.2.5 As for the possible involvement of NO in the oxidation state of iron, a large difference is observed, particularly in COX-2 inhibition, by compounds 5 6 9 7 5 An analogous situation is observed with LOX inhibition, especially by compounds 5 6 7 8 Thus, without excluding a possible intervention of NO in the in vitro assays, it can be suggested that the observed results are largely due to the direct inhibitory activity of the compounds. 2.2.4. Nitrogen Monoxide Release Nitrogen monoxide (NO), a nitrogen-centered free radical, is produced in the organism from L-arginine, in a two-step reaction catalyzed by nitrogen oxide synthases (NOS). It acts as a vasodilator, promoting efficient oxygen supply to tissues, lowers blood pressure, and it inhibits platelet aggregation [ 31 All compounds could liberate NO, and a linear increase in the amount of released NO is observed with increasing compound concentration ( Table 3 Again, 5 6 7 8 2.2.5. Effect on Lipid Peroxidation Thermally inactivated microsomal fraction from the liver of untreated rats was used as a lipid source. The reaction of peroxidation was induced by ascorbic acid and ferrous sulfate, and the degree of peroxidation was estimated as 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive material photometrically [ 32 All compounds presented minor antioxidant effects. Nitric esters may liberate nitrogen monoxide in the organism, and NO is a scavenger of superoxide anion radical. However, it seems that under the conditions of this in vitro experiment, no such activity could be expressed; thus, no antioxidant effect could be observed. 2.3. In Vivo Studies 2.3.1. Effect on Acute Inflammation Produced by Carrageenan Administration The carrageenan-induced paw edema is a common, reproducible, nonimmune model of acute inflammation, with predictive value for detecting the anti-inflammatory activity of compounds. The development of carrageenan inflammation involves several inflammatory mediators acting in two phases. The first phase (during the first hour post-injection) involves histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and reactive oxygen species, while the second phase (2.5 to 6 h) implicates prostaglandins and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α) [ 33 Table 4 All nitric esters showed anti-inflammatory activity well above the parent NSAIDs, more than double that of ibuprofen and naproxen. The most active was 5 Table 1 6 The methyl esters 1 2 19 9 7 9 7 Table 1 2.3.2. Effect on Lipidemic Indices in Hyperlipidemic Rats Hyperlipidemia is a serious risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Other major factors are diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and smoking. It is known that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammation of the vasculature, triggered by the above risk factors [ 34 35 Cholesterol is oxidized in oxLDL, to products toxic to vascular endothelium, and thus, to NO production. High triglyceride levels can also impair NO production and can create a prooxidant environment. In addition, NO affects lipoprotein lipase, that catalyzes triglyceride hydrolysis to free fatty acids and monoacetylglycerol. Furthermore, inadequate NO deprives the vasculature of a vasodilating factor, which may worsen hypertension and thrombosis. Tyloxapol (Triton WR 1339) is a nonionic liquid polymeric surfactant. When tyloxapol is administered parenterally ( i.p. i.v. 36 The two most active anti-inflammatory NO donors, compounds 5 6, Table 5 An important decrease in all three lipidemic indices was observed after the administration of 5 6 37 2.4. In Silico Study Docking of Compound 5 In order to further investigate the outstanding activity of 5 5 Table 6 5 Docked compound 5 Figure 2 Figure 3 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. General All commercially available materials were obtained from Merck (Kenilworth, NJ, USA) or Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA) and used without further purification. The 1 13 δ κ-Carrageenan and lipoxygenase type I-B from soybean were supplied by Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). COX inhibition was estimated using the “COX Inhibitor Screening Assay” kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI, USA). For the determination of plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL-cholesterol concentrations, SPINREACT S.A. Cholesterol-LQ, Triglycerides-LQ, and LDL-Cholesterol D kits were used (Ctra. Santa Coloma, Spain). Adult Wistar male and female rats (160–220 g, 3–4 months old), for the in vivo experiments, were kept in the Centre of the School of Veterinary Medicine (EL54 BIO42), Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, which is registered by the official state veterinary authorities, and all procedures were performed in harmonization with the European Directive 2010/63/EEC. The experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Prefecture of Central Macedonia (no. 270073/2499 and 270079/2500). Rats were housed in controlled rooms, humidity 50–60%, temperature 23 °C, with a 12 h light/dark cycle, and free access to standard laboratory chow and tap water. 3.2. Synthesis 3.2.1.

Conclusions Nitrogen monoxide (NO) has long been used mainly as a vasodilator, e.g., in neonatal pulmonary hypertension [ 38 39 40 In this research, amino acid-conjugated derivatives of ibuprofen and naproxen possessing a nitric ester group were studied. A combination of in vitro, in vivo, and in silico relevant experiments was applied to examine their biological activities. It was found that they are able to reduce acute inflammation more effectively than the parent drugs. They could inhibit cyclooxygenases and act as hypolipidemic agents.
