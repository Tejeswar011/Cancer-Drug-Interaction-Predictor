We sought to describe the characteristics of ICI-vasculitis and ICI-PMR in individuals treated with ICIs through a systematic review and local case series. Methods We searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception to July 2023 for cases of ICI-vasculitis and ICI-PMR in ICI-treated individuals. Our series included cases obtained from clinicians at the Universities of Toronto, McMaster, and Western in Ontario, Canada. Results One hundred and forty-four patients were identified: 130 from the systematic review in 76 articles and 14 from our case series. This included 73 patients with ICI-vasculitis (14 large vessel, 7 ANCA-associated, 52 other) and 71 with ICI-PMR. Ninety-five per cent of patients were treated with glucocorticoids and 17% received disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Among 4 individuals with vasculitis who continued the ICI, two remitted. Of five who paused and restarted ICIs, one experienced a recurrence. Among four individuals with vasculitis who continued ICIs, two remitted. All 11 ICI-PMR cases that continued ICIs remitted; among 3 patients who paused and restarted two did not relapse and one had a relapse that improved with an increase in their dose of prednisone. Conclusion ICI-vasculitis and ICI-PMR are underrecognized complications of ICIs. Glucocorticoids are effective for ICI-vasculitis and ICI-PMR. It is unclear if ICIs can be safely continued or restarted after remission of ICI-vasculitis or ICI-PMR. Limited data suggests ICIs may be resumed in individuals with non-severe ICI-vasculitis or ICI-PMR.

This study will report a case series and perform a systematic review of the literature summarizing the characteristics of ICI-associated vasculitis and PMR-like cases. We will also assess for identifiable risk factors, any atypical features of ICI-associated vasculitis and PMR compared to idiopathic cases, and the management and prognosis of these cases. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature and collected a case series from three hospitals in Ontario, Canada with experience managing rheumatic irAEs in the context of cancer immunotherapy. Patients were included who had received ICIs and subsequently developed vasculitis and/or PMR without a known prior history of these diseases and were thought to have developed their autoimmune disease due to ICI exposure. The diagnosis of ICI- vasculitis or ICI-PMR was made at the discretion of the treating physician. Systematic review The systematic review was performed via the MEDLINE and Embase databases using the search terms “immune checkpoint inhibitor” AND “vasculitis” OR “arteritis” OR “large vessel vasculitis” OR “Takayasu arteritis” OR “aortitis” OR “giant cell arteritis” OR “temporal arteritis” OR “small vessel vasculitis” OR “AAV” OR “GPA” OR “MPA” OR “EGPA” OR “polymyalgia rheumatica” from inception to July 23, 2023. The systematic review, including all screening and data extraction, was conducted (AT and AG) independently. Titles and abstracts were reviewed for relevance, full texts of potentially relevant papers were screened, and data was extracted. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with individuals with expertise in irAEs (MJ and FK). Bibliographies of relevant review articles, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses found throughout the database search were scanned for any missed papers. Papers were excluded if they did not include sufficient data about the case(s), if it was unclear if the complication was considered attributable to ICI exposure, were inaccessible, or were not written in English. Data was collected using standardized data collection forms with individualized forms for large vessel vasculitis (LVV) and PMR, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), and non-LVV/non-AVV (non-LVV/AAV) cases respectively. For the LVV and PMR and AAV cases, the standardized data collection considered the components that are used in their classification criteria to ensure all relevant data was collected. For the cases other than LVV/PMR and AAV, data collection forms allowed long form narrative on all clinical information which ensured information would not be missed among many heterogeneous cases. Data was collected on age, sex, comorbidities, immune checkpoint inhibitor exposure, time to onset of symptoms after exposure, malignancy course, as well as clinical manifestations, physical exam findings, investigations, and management relevant to the irAE. The individualized forms were tailored to the disease manifestations seen in that subset of vasculitis. Diagnoses of vasculitis or PMR was made based on the judgement of the treating clinician. Local case series The University of Toronto, University of McMaster, and University of Western Ontario participated in collecting cases for the series. Research ethics board approval was obtained from each participating institution for the case series. Patients were included who had previously received ICIs and subsequently developed vasculitis and/or PMR without a known prior history of these diseases. Case series was completed by contacting oncologists and rheumatologists who care for individuals with irAEs at each institution. Data was collected using the same forms as the systematic review. The diagnosis of vasculitis or PMR was made based on the judgement of the treating clinician. Results Search results and case series data collection The systematic review yielded 465 potentially relevant papers, and, after screening, 76 studies were included (Fig. 1 1 1 5 1 1 5 Fig. 1 Flow diagram outlining searching and screening process Table 1 Baseline demographics and cancer features for each ICI-vasculitis and ICI-PMR group.

Eighteen (25%) patients received DMARDs during their disease course with 4 (5%) patients requiring multiple DMARDs. Eight (11%) required csDMARDs without advanced therapy and 10 (14%) required advanced therapy. Two of fourteen LVV (14%) patients, 4/7 (57%) AAV patients, and 12/52 (23%) non-LVV/AAV patients required DMARDs. One of seven (14%) AAV patients and 3/52 (6%) non-LVV/AAV patients required multiple DMARDs as outlined in Supplementary Table 2 3 ICI therapy was held at presentation in 92% (44/48) of ICI-vasculitis cases. Of the four that had the ICI continued, two achieved remission and two developed further complications related to vasculitis. One with GCA developed scalp necrosis and another with non-LVV/non-AAV died due to an occlusive thrombus in the right atrium causing cardiac arrest. The other two, one with retinal vasculitis and one with interstitial granulomatous dermatitis and granulomatous arteritis, were able to achieve remission without complications. In those that had the ICI held, 24% (6/25) restarted the ICI. Among those with follow up data available, 20% (1/5) had recurrence of their ICI-vasculitis, which occurred in a patient with GCA/PMR. ICI-PMR Across the 71 cases of ICI-PMR, the median age was 72 years (IQR 64–76), 48 (68%) were male (Table 1 ICI-PMR patients received glucocorticoids as initial therapy for management in 95% (57/60) of cases with a median initial dose of 20 mg (IQR 15–30) of prednisone equivalents per day. Seven (10%) patients also received DMARDs during their disease course. None required multiple DMARDs. Five (7%) required csDMARDs and 2 (3%) required advanced therapy with tocilizumab. Where reported, 64% (21/33) of cases had the ICI held at presentation. Of the 11 patients who had the ICI continued with a reported outcome, all achieved remission without significant adverse events. In the ICI-PMR patients that had the ICI held, 40% (4/10) subsequently restarted the ICI. Among those with follow up data available, 67% (2/3) did not have recurrence after restarting the ICI. One patient who did flare, described in the case series, temporarily had their prednisone increased and was able to continue their ICI for over 2 years while remaining on 5–6 mg of prednisone. Discussion Both ICI-vasculitis and ICI-PMR are complications of ICI treatments that respond well to initial glucocorticoid therapy and discontinuation of the ICI. As ICIs are deployed in an increasing diversity of malignancies, awareness of these complications and safety data is needed. With this systematic review and case series, we have pooled the results of 20 additional ICI-vasculitis and 22 additional ICI-PMR cases to the prior published data [ 1 2 The cases of AAV appeared to be similar to their primary autoimmune counterparts with 3 cases having biopsy data demonstrating classic features of AAV: 2 renal and 1 skin biopsy showing pauci-immune vasculitis [ 18 20 81 Among the PMR cases, the majority of patients for which the components of the 2012 EULAR/ACR provisional classification criteria for PMR were reported had those features with rates of 80–100% for each component. A prior case series and systematic review of ICI-PMR cases by Calabrese et al reported similar issues with insufficient data [ 1 1 4 5 A prior review had found risk factors for rheumatic irAEs included melanoma, GU cancers, and combination ICI therapy [ 82 83 82 It was reassuring that 95% of individuals responded to glucocorticoid monotherapy and 59% of ICI-vasculitis cases and 84% of ICI-PMR cases did not require DMARDs. When DMARD therapy was required, DMARDs used were similar to those used in primary autoimmune cases of vasculitis and PMR as outlined in Table 3 84 84 84 Table 3 irAE management, and outcomes for each ICI-vasculitis and ICI-PMR group.

Another who required amputation as a complication of LVV. ** Complication was GPA patient who developed CKD because of vasculitis and steroid induced diabetes. *** Complications were one patient testicular vasculitis requiring an orchiectomy and two patients with acral vasculitis requiring amputation of multiple distal digits. Data concerning the safety of resuming ICIs was limited but suggested that in ICI-vasculitis, continuing or restarting ICIs may present an ongoing risk of ICI-vasculitis. Data with ICI-PMR was also poorly reported, rendering certain conclusions difficult. Until more comprehensive data is available, clinicians should consider the severity of the initial clinical presentation and engage in shared decision making with patients when deciding on whether or not to continue the ICI. This study has multiple strengths and limitations. By combining a systematic review and case series with collaboration across three hospital sites, we present the largest known collection of ICI-vasculitis and ICI-PMR cases reported to date. These cases, however, may represent primary autoimmune diseases onset concurrent with treatment rather than irAE as older individuals are more likely to develop cancer and require ICI therapy as well as develop PMR and/or other forms of vasculitis. In seeking to describe the outcomes of rare diseases, reporting bias around case reports will often affect rates of outcomes and as such the data can only be used for hypothesis generation and to inform the structure of future research. Standardized prospective studies are required to have unbiased ascertainment of outcomes. While a case series was used to bolster these results, which cases were included was also subject to recall bias. Data interpretation was limited by the availability and heterogeneity of data reporting with cases in the literature, for example concerning the safety of restarting ICIs. As such, it as difficult to draw many conclusions from the data. Prospective follow up is needed to better characterize these diseases and their outcomes. Furthermore, diagnosis of vasculitis and PMR was left to the discretion of the treating clinician potentially leading to overdiagnosis or misclassification based on classification criteria; for example, differentiating PMR with normal inflammatory markers from other musculoskeletal complaints may be difficult. Our data suggests that ICI-vasculitis and ICI-PMR appear to present with similar features to their primary autoimmune counterparts, however, our knowledge of their presentation and epidemiology continues to be limited to date. Single organ vasculitis may also be a more frequent manifestation than previously considered. Both ICI-PMR and ICI-vasculitis respond well to initial glucocorticoid monotherapy and most do not require DMARD therapy. Data concerning continuing or restarting ICIs is sparse but suggest that, similar to other irAEs, it may be reasonable to continue or restart ICIs in cases of mild irAEs, while more caution is needed for severe irAEs. The decision to hold or continue ICIs should involve shared decision-making with both the patient and specialists experienced in managing these challenging cases. Further information from real world registries will help inform future clinical decision making. Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
