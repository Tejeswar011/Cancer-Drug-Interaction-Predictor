Despite therapeutic advances during the last two decades, patient prognosis remains very poor. The Hippo signaling pathway effectors YAP/TAZ‐TEADs play a crucial role in tumor progression and represent promising therapeutic targets in gliomas. In this study, we identified and investigated the clinical and biological significance of TEAD transcription factors. Through comprehensive analyses of TCGA glioma data and patient samples, we identified TEAD3‐4 transcription factors as robust prognostic markers of patient outcome. Using up to five different patient‐derived glioblastoma stem cell cultures, we confirmed the preferential expression and activation of TEAD3‐4 along with their transcriptional coactivators YAP/TAZ. Pharmacological inhibition of YAP/TAZ‐TEAD interaction by Verteporfin significantly decreased tumor cell growth, whereas specific inhibition of TEAD3 did not impact cell proliferation but affected sterol/cholesterol biosynthetic and metabolic processes. This study contributes to a better understanding of the role of Hippo effectors in glioblastoma pathophysiology. These transcription factors, particularly TEAD3, could potentially serve as therapeutic targets, especially considering recent data on cholesterol homeostasis in glioblastomas. The Hippo pathway transcription factor TEAD3 represents an independent prognostic biomarker of tumor recurrence and a potential therapeutic vulnerability through its regulation of cholesterol metabolism in glioma. glioblastomas gliomas hippo pathway sterol metabolism TEAD3 Ligue Contre le Cancer 10.13039/501100004099 Fonds Aliénor CHU Poitiers pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date November 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Masliantsev K Desette A Gonzalez A‐A Garrouche I Noblanc A Soulard M Hippo pathway effectors are associated with glioma patient survival, control cell proliferation and sterol metabolism through TEAD3 Brain Pathology 2025 35 6 e70021 10.1111/bpa.70021 PMC12488254 40457844 1 INTRODUCTION Gliomas are the most common and lethal primary brain tumors in adults and represent approximately 80% of primary malignant central nervous system (CNS) tumors [ 1 IDH1/2 2 3 The Hippo pathway, initially discovered in Drosophila, is a highly conserved evolutionary signaling pathway involved in tissue development and regeneration that controls organ size through the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis [ 4 5 6 AXL c‐MYC BIRC5 CYR61 CTGF 7 8 9 10 11 12 Given that practically all research has focused on YAP/TAZ, with limited knowledge regarding their associated transcription factors, we performed a comprehensive investigation into the prognostic value and biological significance of the TEAD family in gliomas. Using RNAseq transcriptomic data, clinical samples, and patient‐derived glioblastoma stem cell cultures, we identified TEAD transcription factors as interesting patient outcome biomarkers and highlighted their therapeutic potential. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Tissue microarray ( TMA TMAs were constructed using formalin‐fixed, paraffin‐embedded tissues from surgical resections or biopsies of gliomas. Patients enrolled in the study were operated on at the Poitiers University Hospital after written informed consent was obtained. The study was approved by the Poitiers University Hospital Ethics Committee (DHOS/OPRC/Fcnotif‐tumoro‐jun04: 04056). Mutations in IDH1/2 S1 2.2 Immunohistochemistry ( IHC IHC stainings were made on TMAs using the EnVision kit (Dako). The recipient block was sectioned at 3 μm thickness, and IHC was performed manually as follows: sections were deparaffinized and heated in pH = 6 sodium citrate solution for 40 min at 96°C for antigen retrieval. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C and exhibited using the horseradish peroxidase method with diaminobenzidine as a chromogen. The antibody list is presented in Table S2 2.3 Immunofluorescence ( IF IF on TMA was performed using Opal™ 4‐Color Manual IHC Kit (Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, MA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. IF on cell cultures was performed as follows: cells were seeded overnight on poly‐D‐lysine (50 μg/mL) and laminin (1 μg/mL)‐coated coverslips and fixed after 24 h with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 15 min. Non‐specific antigen blocking and cell permeabilization were performed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X‐100 and 5% donkey serum for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclear staining was performed using DAPI, and coverslips were mounted with Mowiol (Merck, Saint‐Quentin‐en‐Yvelines, France). Images were captured with an AxioImager microscope (Zeiss, Marly le Roi, France). The dilution for each antibody is presented in Table S2 2.4 Cell culture GSC cultures were derived from adult patients with IDH‐wildtype glioblastoma operated on at the University Hospital of Poitiers after informed consent was obtained. As previously described, GSC cultures were assessed for stemness, self‐renewal, and differentiation in vitro [ 13 2 S3 2.5 Cell viability assay The CellTiter 96® Aqueous Non‐Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Charbonnières‐les‐Bains, France) was used to estimate cell numbers and, thereby, cell viability. Cells were seeded in 96‐well plates at 5000 cells per well. After 24 h, the plates were treated with Verteporfin (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France) or TEAD3 siRNA. Quantification of viable cells after treatment was performed with a micro‐plate reader at 492 nm. 2.6 Western blotting Cells were lysed with cold RIPA buffer 24 h after treatment, and protein concentration was determined through colorimetric dosage using Bio‐Rad Protein Assay buffer solution (Bio‐Rad, Marnes‐la‐Coquette, France) by absorbance at 620 nm. Equal quantities of protein samples were separated by SDS‐PAGE and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio‐Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate‐buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma‐Aldrich, Saint‐Quentin Fallavier, France). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibodies, coupled with peroxidase in saturation solution, were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The dilution for each antibody is presented in Table S2 β 2.7 Reverse transcription‐quantitative PCR RT qPCR Total RNA was extracted 24 h after GSC treatment using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Les Ulis, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First‐strand cDNA synthesis was carried out on 1 μg samples of total RNA using a High‐Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with RNase Inhibitor (ThermoFisher Scientific) prior to qPCR using PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific) and a LightCycler® 480 Instrument II (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). mRNA levels were normalized to TBP and determined by the comparative Ct Ct S4 2.8  RNA The RNAs were extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol and qualified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer platform (Agilent Technologies). Qualified RNAs were sent to the MGX platform in Montpellier for RNA sequencing. Briefly, libraries were produced using a TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) and 150 nt paired‐end sequenced on NovaSeq sequencer (Illumina). The fastq files were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra gdac.broadinstitue.org cbioportal.org bioconductor.org 14 S1 15 p biit.cs.ut.ee 2.9 Statistical analyses Descriptive statistics of the results were calculated with GraphPad Prism 7 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) software was used for univariate and multivariate analyses. Statistical significance was evaluated by Kruskal–Wallis, Mantel–Cox log rank, Chi‐squared, and Mann–Whitney tests (* p p p 3 RESULTS 3.1 The Hippo pathway TF TEADs TCGA To identify new transcription factors and associated co‐factors that could be related to glioma aggressiveness, we performed a differential expression analysis by comparing glioma molecular subtypes using RNA sequencing data from the TCGA glioma cohort.

We found that TEAD3 and TEAD4 are significantly upregulated in IDHwt gliomas compared to IDHmut gliomas, and that TEAD3 is the most prognostically relevant of the TEAD family members. We also confirmed that TEAD4 represents an independent predictor in low‐grade gliomas with IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, which was previously shown to be involved in invasion and epithelial‐mesenchymal transition [ 16 17 SREBF1 These results are particularly relevant to the recent studies concerning the dysregulation of cholesterol homeostasis and the involvement of sterol response element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors.
