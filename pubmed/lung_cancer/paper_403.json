Background The abscopal effect suggests that the impact of radiotherapy extends beyond the direct tumor local regression, due to activation of the immune response. Its effectiveness may vary depending on whether high- or low-radiation doses are used. In FLASH therapy, the high-dose rate treatment induces systemic effects that may trigger an abscopal response. Methods We discuss a phenomenological, computational model, based on available in vivo Results The method enables a quantitative assessment of the interaction between FLASH radiotherapy and the activated immune response, based on observations of metastatic shrinkage due to the FLASH treatment of the primary tumor. mathematical modeling Gompertz law radiotherapy abscopal effect FLASH radio-therapy immunotherapy Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca 10.13039/501100003407 The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

In addition to directly inducing cell death, ionizing radiation is now recognized to play a complex modulatory role on the tumor microenvironment [for a recent comprehensive review, see ref ( 1 2 3 Experimental and clinical observations have reported abscopal responses under particular conditions, including high-dose irradiation schemes ( 4 14 15 19 Notably, preclinical studies on mice have documented a biphasic response following a single FLASH dose of 25 Gy to the primary tumor, characterized by an initial regression, a transient regrowth, and a delayed second phase of tumor reduction ( 20 21 Understanding the mechanisms underlying this temporal pattern is essential to elucidate the potential of FLASH therapy as a systemic treatment. However, direct modeling of the full complexity of the biological cascades involved—including immune cell trafficking, antigen presentation, and tumor–immune interactions—remains a formidable challenge due to the limited availability of detailed in vivo To address this, we adopt a phenomenological modeling strategy grounded in experimental observations. The present work introduces a computational framework that builds upon prior in vivo 22 Tumor growth is modeled using the Gompertz law ( 23 26 22 20 By comparing the predicted dynamics of tumor volumes at primary and metastatic sites, the model allows for a quantitative assessment of how FLASH-induced immune mechanisms may lead to the observed abscopal effects. Therefore, this study provides a theoretical framework to interpret experimental data and supports the hypothesis that FLASH therapy, under specific dosing conditions, can induce an effective systemic antitumor response. More precisely, the progression of the metastasis depends on two independent parameters, which describe respectively the local initial conditions (of the distant site) and the initial size of the metastasis at the onset of the systemic immune effect, induced by the FLASH therapy applied to the primary tumor. A possible correlation between them implies a metastasis size dependence of the immune response. Moreover, a time delay in immune response between the primary tumor and its metastasis suggests a dynamics not reducible to a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model. 2 Methods The proposed approach relies on two key components: 1) a previous analysis of in vivo 20 22 27 30 2.1 Computational method The untreated tumor growth is described by the Gompertz law (GL) ( 23 26  Supplementary Material (1) 1 N ( t ) d N ( t ) d t = a − k ln  N ( t ) N 0 = k ln  N ∞ N ( t ) where N a k N 0 N ∞ N ∞ N (0 a/k 24 in vivo in vitro 26 31 32 33 The radiotherapy effect can be incorporated directly into the previous equation by (2) 1 N p ( t ) d N p ( t ) d t = k p ln  N ∞ p N p ( t ) − F ( t ) where the index p F t In ref ( 22 F t 20 (3) F ( t ) = c 0 + c 1 e − c 2 t − c f t . The four parameters depend on dose, d 22 20 22 In particular, a key feature of the experimental data ( 20 c f 20 c 0 c 1 22 t t 1 t t 2  Figure 1 Figure 1 Qualitative behavior of the time evolution of the FLASH therapy effect for 25 Gy ( 22 t 1 t 2 Graph showing V(t)/V(0) versus time in days. The curve starts at positive one, dips below zero around eight days, steadily rises, peaks near day sixty-five at around 1.7, and then slightly declines.

The red line represents untreated primary tumors, increasing significantly. The black line indicates treated primary tumors, showing minimal growth. The y-axis is V(t)/V(t_1), and the x-axis is days.

The subsequent regrowth, starting at time t 1  Figure 2 Nonetheless, as previously discussed, the carrying capacity and the initial cell number of the primary tumor can differ substantially from those of the metastatic site. The quantitative difference can be better understood by comparing the GL for the primary volume V p Equations 1 3 t > t 1  Supplementary Material (5) V p ( t ) V p ( t 1 ) = e x p [ ( ln  V ∞ p V p ( t 1 ) − c 0 / k − c f / k 2 ) ( 1 − e − k ( t − t 1 ) ) − e − ( c 2 t 1 ) c 1 k − c 2 ( e − c 2 ( t − t 1 ) − e − k ( t − t 1 ) ) + ( t − t 1 e − k ( t − t 1 ) ) c f / k ] with the analogous GL for the metastasis (see Equation 4 (6) V M ( t ) V M ( t 1 ) = e x p [ ( ln  V ∞ M V M ( t 1 ) ( 1 − e − k ( t − t 1 ) ) − ∫ t 1 t d t ′ Y ( t ′ ) F ( t ′ ) e − k ( t − t ′ ) Indeed, one can write (7) ln  V ∞ M V M ( t 1 ) = ln  V ∞ p V p ( t 1 ) + ln  λ where the parameter (see Equations 5 8 (8) λ = V ∞ M V ∞ p V p ( t 1 ) V M ( t 1 ) , is related to the metastasis size and can be >1 or <1. However, since, from the previous equation, (9) λ ( V ∞ p V p ( t 1 ) ) = ( V ∞ M V M ( t 1 ) ) ,  λ < By previous definitions, Equation 7 (10) V M ( t ) / V M ( t 1 ) = e x p [ ( ln  V ∞ p V p ( t 1 ) + ln  λ ) ( 1 − e − k ( t − t 1 ) ) − ∫ t 1 t d t ′ Y ( t ′ ) F ( t ′ ) e − k ( t − t ′ ) .

Each curve demonstrates different growth patterns over time. The two parameters may be correlated. In fact, although y 0  V ∞ M / V M ( t 1 ) λ The correlation between the two parameters has significant and testable implications. Indeed, the abscopal effect appears to be dependent on tumor size ( 37 It is useful to illustrate them with an example. Let us suppose that, for the untreated tumor, the ratio  V ∞ p / V p ( t 1 ) k   V ∞ M  V M ( t 1 ) λ  V M ( t 1 )  Figure 5 λ λ t t 1 y 0 Figure 5 The abscopal effect for different metastatic volumes at t t 1 λ y 0 λ Line graph depicting V(t)/V(t-1) over 120 days from flash therapy, with different lambda values and delay times. Solid and dashed lines represent lambda equals 0.7 and 0.875 respectively, with variations for no delay, 1-day, 3-day, and 6-day delays. The vertical axis ranges from 0 to 2.5. This result is reversed (the abscopal effect is greater for smaller metastases) if the two parameters are correlated, as shown in  Figure 6 37 Figure 6 The abscopal effect for different metastatic volumes at the onset of induced immune response ( t > t 1 λ y 0 λ < V M t 1 Equation 9 A line graph compares four curves based on day from Flash-therapy versus V(t)/V(t_1).

The curves show an initial decrease, peaking around day 60, and then gradually declining.

Values decrease initially, then slightly increase and stabilize. 4 Discussion and conclusions This work aimed to propose a method to determine to what extent FLASH therapy induces a systemic immune response by monitoring the abscopal effect. The computational approach for quantitative analysis is based on the following steps, which are informed by experimental data and guided by specific assumptions: Determination of the primary tumor evolution without treatment [as in the experiment reported in ref ( 20 k  V ∞ p Estimation of the four parameters, c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c f 22 Assumption of a systemic immune effect ( 38 39 t > t 1 λ Assumption of a constant enhancement or suppression of the immune response ( Y t y 0 Inclusion of a time delay in the onset of the immune response between the primary tumor and the metastasis. Steps (1) and (2) rely on the availability of experimental data. Steps (3) through (5) are model assumptions. The quantitative analysis requires the determination of only two to three additional parameters, which can be easily extracted using standard software tools applied to the metastatic growth data. The correlation between λ y 0 The proposed computational method is based on the Gompertz growth law (point 1); however, any type of two-parameter sigmoidal curve can be used, such as the logistic curve. The Gompertz law provides a better fit to the available data [see ref ( 26  Supplementary Material S3 Regarding point 4, the immune response to distant metastases may vary over time rather than remaining constant. However, this possibility can be readily incorporated into the computational model if a single value of y 0 Y t Equation 6  Supplementary Material S2 The computational model relies on a set of parameters that must be specified for the given tumor phenotype in order to quantitatively assess the abscopal effect induced by radiotherapy. Therefore, the experimental procedure requires that the primary tumor is first inoculated in the test animals, followed by injection of the same tumor cells at a distant site to allow metastatic development. FLASH therapy is then applied to the primary tumor, and the evolution of both primary and metastatic tumor volumes is subsequently monitored. Initially, it is essential to fit the primary tumor growth data from two control groups—one untreated and one treated with FLASH therapy alone, without metastasis. This fitting procedure allows for the determination of the parameters k  V ∞ p c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c f λ, y 0 λ y 0 τ χ 2 4 The difference between tumor phenotypes is reflected in the specific values of the parameters in the function F t y 0 λ In conclusion, we have proposed a quantitative method to evaluate the abscopal effect associated with FLASH therapy. In our view, this type of treatment should trigger a systemic immune response. Otherwise, it would be difficult to explain why, following the initial sharp reduction in tumor cells, a regrowth phase occurs with a specific rate significantly lower than in the untreated case—and, more importantly, why a subsequent tumor regression takes place long after the treatment has been administered. The computational method, while open to improvement in several respects, offers a quantitative estimate of deciphering the activated immune response.
