Introduction Lung cancer ranks as the top cause of cancer-associated deaths globally [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Two major classes of ICIs that are widely used are programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4) inhibitors [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Blood routine is a routine test for lung cancer patients, which includes the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), hematocrit (HCT), white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 2. Results 2.1. The Clinical Features of the Patients The study details the clinical characteristics, irAES, and the best response observed in 920 individuals with lung cancer in Table 1 Table 2 2.2. The Association of ERIs with irAEs Patients with irAE or non-irAE have been divided into two groups. According to the irAE and ERIs of the 920 lung cancer patients, the ROC curve was used to determine the optimal cut-off value of ERIs. The cut-off values to define the high or low value of RBC, HCT and MCV were 4.555 × 10 9 p p p p Figure 1 p p p Figure 2 p p p Figure 3 Table 3 2.3. The Association of ERIs with Immunotherapy Efficacy We divided the best responses of the lung cancer patients into responders (CR: complete response, PR: partial response, SD: stable disease) and non-responders (PD: progressive disease). According to the best response and ERIs of the 920 lung cancer patients, we additionally employed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to identify the optimal threshold value for ERIs. The cut-off values to define the high or low value of the RBC, HCT and MCV were 4.105 × 109 L, 39.65% and 86.35 fl, respectively, the AUC values of the RBC, HCT and MCV were 0.588, 0.595 and 0.523, respectively, and the p p p p Figure 1 p p p Figure 2 p = p = p Figure 4 Table 4 2.4. The Association of ERIs with irAEs and Immunotherapy Efficacy in Student’s t-Test and Kruskal–Wallis Test Firstly, we ran a normality test on RBC, HCT and MCV; only the RBC value conforms to normal distribution. We used Student’s t p p p p Table 5 2.5. The Relationship Between ERIs and Survival Outcomes in Lung Cancer Patients Undergoing Treatment with ICIs In our investigation, RBC showed a statistically significant association with PFS ( p p 9 p 9 p Figure 5 3. Discussion There are various systemic treatments including immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgical resection, cellular therapy and targeted therapy in lung cancer treatment [ 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 In this study, we found that ERIs RBC, HCT and MCV play important roles in irAEs and immunotherapy efficacy. Overall, 43.15% of the patients in our study suffered from irAEs (397/920). HCT is significantly associated with the irAEs ( p p 43 44 45 Overall, 77.71% (715/920) of the patients in our study were classified as having one of the best responses (CR, PR and SD). The RBC and MCV were found to be significantly correlated with the best response analyzed by multivariate binary logistic regression ( p p p p 46 47 It has been reported by Ming Wu et al. that the red blood cell (RBC)-hitchhiking strategy can deliver the neoantigen DNA vaccine to targeted hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) immunotherapy, which can drive personalized antitumor immunity for HCC [ 48 49 50 51 It has been reported that when the body has an inflammatory response, the homeostasis process may be disrupted, which can lead to acute or chronic anemia and then subsequently have an effect on RBC/HCT/MCV [ 52 53 54 It seems paradoxical that elevated red blood cell parameters are correlated with a more favorable response to ICIs but at the same time with lower survival (OS and PFS). We should specify that the best response and survival have no necessary connection. The cut-off value with RBC and best response was 4.105 × 10 9 9 9 Our research has a number of limitations. Firstly, it adopted a retrospective observational design, and the follow-up of patients depends on the electronic medical record. Secondly, the sample was not large enough. As we performed the correction for multiple comparisons, which calculated the p p 4. Patients and Methods 4.1. Patient Collection All participants included in our research were chosen based on the following criteria: (1) individuals who received their initial diagnosis of lung cancer at either Xiangya Hospital of Central South University or Hunan Cancer Hospital (located in Changsha, Hunan Province, China) between April 2019 and May 2023; (2) patients who received PD-1 or PD-L1 immunotherapy; (3) all disease stages determined in accordance with the eighth version of the TNM staging system [ 55 56 57 4.2. Treatment and Data Collection The clinical features of the patients were gathered, including age, sex, smoking history, disease stage, histological type, type of anti–PD-(L)1 therapy, best response, and irAEs. We additionally examined the relationship between ERIs and the prognostic outcomes of lung cancer patients with the relevant findings compiled in Table 2 4.3. Statistical Analysis In the present research, measured data were presented in the form of individual cases, while variables belonging to categorical types were indicated by means of frequencies and the corresponding percentages within each group. To identify discrepancies, comparisons of data across different groups were conducted utilizing either Student’s t p p https://www.graphpad.com/ Figure S1 5. Conclusions To sum up, the findings of our research suggest that the ERIs including RBC, HCT, and MCV could serve as predictors for the onset of irAEs and the prognostic outcomes of lung cancer patients receiving ICI therapy.
