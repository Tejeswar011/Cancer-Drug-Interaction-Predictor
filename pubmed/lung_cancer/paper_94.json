This study investigates the effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) on the pharmacokinetics of morphine and its metabolite, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), and their influence on neuroinflammation and systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that disruptions in the blood–brain barrier (BBB) due to TBI would enhance M3G exposure to the brain, which could potentially trigger inflammatory responses. We implemented a rat model of controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury to assess systemic pharmacokinetics of morphine and M3G over 24 hours postintravenous bolus administration. To gain an understanding of relative levels in the brain, we measured the drug and metabolite concentrations in both brain tissue and plasma at the systemic maximum concentration, which occurred at 1 hour post-CCI. While this study was designed to conduct a thorough acute pharmacokinetic analysis, the design also afforded an early examination of potential pharmacodynamic effects. Markers of neuroinflammation and systemic inflammation were measured in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid at 24 hours post-CCI. Results showed a 2-fold increase in systemic M3G exposure and doubled concentrations of both morphine and M3G in the brain. Notably, only M3G demonstrated a significant increase in the brain/plasma ratio at 1 hour. Despite these pharmacokinetic changes following a single bolus, there were limited morphine-induced or M3G-induced increases in markers of neuroinflammation or systemic inflammation at 24 hour post-CCI. This study highlights that TBI significantly alters the pharmacokinetics of morphine and M3G, increasing their brain penetration without worsening acute inflammation. Future research will need to explore the implications of extended and repeated dosing on these pharmacokinetic and inflammatory outcomes after TBI. Significance Statement To our knowledge, this is the first pharmacokinetic analysis of morphine and its metabolite morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) following traumatic brain injury (TBI). This research provides the first evidence that morphine and M3G show increased systemic and brain concentrations following experimental TBI, with an acute rise in M3G’s brain/plasma ratio. Although no exacerbation of acute TBI-induced inflammation was observed with either morphine or M3G, the impact of longer, more frequent dosing needs evaluation because its longer administration could exacerbate TBI’s neuroinflammatory response.

While some clinical studies have investigated the influence of TBI pathophysiology on morphine clearance, 19 20 21 Understanding morphine disposition in the context of TBI requires knowledge of the key enzymes and transporters involved in its ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) processes. In rats, morphine is primarily metabolized by UGT2B1 to M3G, which accounts for 80%–90% of metabolism, while M6G formation is negligible (<1%). Roughly 20% of morphine is converted to normorphine via CYP3A. In humans, metabolism is primarily through UGT2B7, producing both M3G and M6G, with M6G contributing significantly to analgesia (∼10%–15%). Transport across the BBB involves P-glycoprotein (efflux), organic cation transporters and OATP2B1 (uptake), while MRP2/3 are responsible for exporting glucuronide metabolites. Renal elimination is the primary route of excretion for both morphine and its metabolites. These processes may be altered in the setting of TBI, potentially influencing central drug and metabolite exposure. Determining whether these changes exist is a necessary first step before investigating the mechanisms responsible for altered disposition. The primary objective of this study is to characterize the effect of TBI on systemic and central nervous system (CNS) exposure of M3G following morphine intravenous bolus administration using the well-characterized rodent controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. This model was chosen because it replicates key features of moderate-to-severe focal contusion injury seen in clinical TBI, including BBB disruption and neuroinflammation, allowing us to evaluate morphine and its metabolites under these conditions. The secondary objective is to determine whether markers of neuroinflammation and systemic inflammation are altered following morphine intravenous bolus administration in the setting of TBI. In addition, M3G was directly administered to determine the clearance of M3G and examine the effect of M3G alone. Results will elucidate pharmacokinetic changes in clearance and M3G exposure after TBI, highlighting how these could potentially worsen neuroinflammation acutely. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Animals Experiments used 8–10-week-old, 290–340-g, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Invigo). All experimental protocols were completed in compliance with ARRIVE guidelines and received approval from the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, in compliance with the guidelines outlined in the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animal housing facilities accommodated a maximum of 2 rats per cage, with lighting set on 12:12 light/dark photoperiod, and animals had continuous access to food and water. Veterinary technicians and laboratory staff conducted daily health assessments and husbandry. 2.2 Jugular catheter surgery Anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane and 2:1 N 2 2 2 2 μ 2.3 Experimental design Using the CCI injury protocol, 22 For pharmacodynamic analysis, samples obtained during the pharmacokinetic experiments were repurposed to establish correlations between drug area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC 0–last α 2.4 CCI injury Rats were randomized to receive either sham control or CCI surgery. A midline incision was performed, and a 7-mm craniotomy was created over the right parietal cortex between bregma and lambda centered 5-mm lateral from the sagittal suture and the dura mater was exposed. CCI was conducted using a specialized apparatus (Pittsburgh Precision Instruments), equipped with a small-bore (1.975 cm) double-acting pneumatically driven cylinder with a 5.0-cm stroke. An impactor tip, with a diameter of 6 mm was positioned to generate a tissue deformation of 2.5 mm at a velocity of 4 m/s, with a dwell time of 100 milliseconds. Sham control surgery animals underwent anesthesia and surgical procedures identical to those of the CCI group but were not subjected to injury. After either sham control surgery or CCI injury, the scalp incision was sutured, anesthesia was discontinued, and the righting time was recorded and monitored. Upon regaining ambulatory status, the animals were returned to their respective home cages. 2.5 Administration of morphine intravenous bolus and serial plasma collection A morphine intravenous bolus of 2.5 mg/kg was selected for administration. Previous studies revealed that larger doses of morphine administered to animals lead to extended periods of respiratory depression and, in certain instances, hindered functional recovery. 23 , 24 μ To investigate pharmacokinetics, the rats were categorized into 2 groups (sham control surgery vs CCI injury). All animals were randomized to receive either CCI injury or sham control surgery, and either a 2.5-mg/kg i.v. bolus of morphine or volume equivalent saline via jugular catheter ( n μ α 25 μ The blood samples were transferred to EDTA-coated tubes and centrifuged (12,000 g n 2.6 Administration of M3G intravenous bolus and serial plasma collection A 2.5-mg/kg dose was selected to achieve a similar AUC o–∞ 26 Supplemental Figure A μ n μ 2.7 Administration of morphine intravenous bolus for morphine and M3G measurement in brain 1 hour after CCI The experimental design for assessing morphine and M3G concentrations in the brain was duplicated from the previous design measuring plasma, with the sole alteration being the terminal time point, which was adjusted to 1 hour postinjury. Two groups, each comprising 6 rats ( n T max 2.8 Sample preparation for LC/MS-MS measurement 2.8.1 Plasma The sample preparation for plasma followed a validated protocol established in our laboratory. 27 μ g μ μ 2.8.2 Brain tissue homogenate Dissected ipsilateral (same side as injury or sham control surgery) cortical brain samples were weighed before homogenization in 1 mL of water. A 100- μ Supplemental Section C 2.9 LC-MS/MS instrumentation and analytical conditions The LC/MS-MS method described previously was used for this study. 27 μ μ μ For the detection and quantification of analytes, a TSQ Altis triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source was used. Analytes were detected in positive ionization mode with the following parameters: a spray voltage of 4000 V, a vaporization temperature of 275 °C, sheath gas pressure (in arbitrary unit [au]) set at 35, and auxiliary gas pressure (arbitrary units) at 7. Analytes were monitored using the selected reaction monitoring mode, with the following parameters configured: chromatographic peak width of 6 seconds, scan time of 0.05 seconds, and Q1 and Q3 (full width at half maximum) set at 0.70. This LC-MS assay was validated for measurement of morphine (0.5–125 ng/mL), M3G (1–500 ng/mL), and M6G (1–500 ng/mL) in plasma and brain. 2.10 Pharmacokinetic analysis A noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using Phoenix WinNonlin 8.4 (Certara) to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of morphine and its metabolite, M3G.

Therefore, a 24-hour time point was selected for analyzing neuroinflammatory and inflammatory markers, aligning with our secondary objective to complement the primary goal of determining pharmacokinetics. Twenty-four hours following the injury or sham surgery, animals were euthanized by an overdose of 100 mg/kg, sodium pentobarbital intraperitoneally (Fatal-plus; Vortech pharmaceuticals). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained via cisterna magna. Transcardial collection of blood samples were collected in EDTA-coated tubes, as previously detailed, and processed for plasma. Subsequently, animals underwent transcardial perfusion with saline, followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific). Brains were then postfixed for 24 hours in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated by immersion in a solution of 30% sucrose in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline for 48 hours at 4 °C and embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T compound (Sakura Finetek) for sectioning into 35- μ 2.12 Immunohistochemistry analysis of IgG, GFAP, and IBA1 For immunohistochemical staining, hippocampal tissue sections covering the region between −3.2 and −4.0 mm bregma, which encompassed the site of injury, were selected for analysis. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted on free-floating tissue sections. For each protein of interest, a single section per animal, was rinsed with a 0.1 M Tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer and blocked with a solution of 10% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M TBS for a duration of 1 hour. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibodies diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M TBS (rabbit anti-GFAP: 1:5000; Millipore; RRID: AB_2109645 AB_839504 AB_2336820 AB_2336821 AB_2336382 AB_2336823 29 2.13 Assessment of inflammatory markers Inflammatory markers (interferon gamma, IL-1 β α 2.14 Data analysis and statistical methods To ensure sufficient statistical power in our study, a priori group size of 6 rats was determined for each group to complete all analyses, including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analysis. The data analysis was carried out using GraphPad Prism 10 software.

(A) Schematic of study design to complete immunohistochemistry in brain and fluid tissues completed in animals from the pharmacokinetic analysis. (B) Representative immunohistochemical images of IgG in the ipsilateral hippocampus (side of injury or sham surgery). Scale bar of lower magnitude images equal to 1 mm while higher magnitude images are equal to 200 μ IgG extravasation was used as a marker for detecting BBB breakdown as an intact BBB restricts its movement into the parenchyma. We used pixel intensity measurements of IgG staining within the ipsilateral hippocampus to determine whether M3G-affected or morphine-affected BBB permeability jointly with the effects from injury. Two-way ANOVA results revealed a significant injury effect—saline vs morphine ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Subsequently, we examined GFAP, a well-established biomarker indicative of astrocytic reactivity. We measured pixel intensity of GFAP staining within the ipsilateral hippocampus ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Hippocampal GFAP immunoreactivity at 24 hours after CCI. (A) Representative immunohistochemical images of GFAP in the ipsilateral hippocampus (side of injury or sham surgery). Scale bar of lower magnitude images equal to 1 mm, while higher magnitude images are equal to 200 μ Consequently, our analysis progressed to the examination of IBA1, a marker for microglial activity. Pixel intensity measurements of IBA1 staining in the ipsilateral hippocampus were examined and quantified ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Hippocampal IBA1 immunoreactivity at 24 hours after CCI.

Scale bar of lower magnitude images equal to 1 mm, while higher magnitude images are equal to 200 μ 3.3.2 Neuroinflammation measurement in 24-hour CSF Next, we measured a panel of inflammatory markers in CSF to evaluate the effect of morphine and M3G on markers of neuroinflammation after CCI. Our exclusion criteria were applied, and only KC-GRO met the criteria to complete statistical analysis. However, results from all inflammatory markers in the panel are included in Supplemental Section D Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Plots of 2-way ANOVA comparison with (±SD) of saline vs 2.5-mg/kg morphine (A) and saline vs 2.5-mg/kg M3G (B) in measurement in of KC-GRO using a Mesoplex Rat Inflammatory Panel. 3.3.3 Inflammatory measurement in 24-hour plasma Gaining insight into the inflammatory response is crucial for elucidating its impact on neuroinflammation. Following the application of exclusion criteria, statistical analysis was exclusively feasible for IL-6 (only morphine vs saline) ( Fig. 7 Fig. 7 α Fig. 7 Supplemental Section D Fig. 7 Plots of 2-way ANOVA comparison with (±SD) of saline vs 2.5-mg/kg morphine (A–C) and saline vs 2.5-mg/kg M3G (D,E) in measurement of IL-6 (A), KC-GRO (B,D), TNF α 3.3.4 Correlation analysis between M3G AUC 0–24 The data from our GFAP analysis suggested a trend in the interaction with injury and morphine. To evaluate whether M3G exposure from morphine is related to this, further analysis was performed. We completed correlation plots to explore the within-subject relationship between GFAP as an indicator of astrocytic reactivity and M3G exposure from formation from morphine ( Fig. 8 0-last Fig. 8 Correlation plot of injured rats of M3G AUC 0–24 n 4 Discussion The primary objective of this study was to characterize the effect of TBI on systemic and CNS exposure of M3G following morphine intravenous bolus administration using the well-characterized rodent CCI model. Evaluating the PK of morphine and its metabolite M3G is important because understanding how TBI influences their systemic and CNS exposure could have significant implications for patient outcomes. Alterations in the pharmacokinetics of these compounds following TBI may impact their effectiveness and safety, influencing clinical decision-making and treatment strategies. This approach enables a clearer understanding of how TBI affects morphine and M3G pharmacokinetics, which is crucial for optimizing treatment in patients with TBI. Disruption of the BBB is a key secondary injury feature of CCI, 30 C max Studies characterizing the PK of morphine and M3G following intravenous bolus and intraperitoneal administration show similar parameter estimates, once dosing, bioavailability, and experimental variables are considered. 31 , 32 0–20 β The increase in the concentrations of M3G following CCI is unexpected because there is no significant change in morphine clearance. One possible explanation is altered shunting between metabolic pathways. In rats, approximately 80%–90% of morphine is converted to M3G via UGT2B1, while M6G formation is negligible (<1%), which aligns with our undetectable M6G levels. Additionally, normorphine accounts for ∼20% of morphine metabolism via CYP3A. We did not measure normorphine because our LC-MS assay was optimized for clinical use where normorphine comprises only ∼4% of metabolism. 31 , 33 34 It is noteworthy that kidney function has not been characterized temporally in TBI. Clinical studies have highlighted occurrences of concurrent hypotension and severe TBI. 35 36 36 Brain transporters may explain the observed 2-fold increase in morphine exposure within the brain. Previous studies have shown increased P-glycoprotein efflux activity after TBI or morphine administration. 37 , 38 39 , 40 41 To evaluate BBB permeability in our study, IgG extravasation was completed. The substantial injury effect observed in our study was consistent with findings in the literature, particularly at the 24-hour time point. 42 43 Given the previous associations of M3G with astrocyte signaling, 44 45 We also assessed IBA1 owing to the involvement of microglia in neuroinflammatory response, which have been shown to have an injury effect with increased activity at 24 hours. 46 47 To further explore neuroinflammation and systemic inflammation, we examined downstream markers linked to neuroinflammation namely, IL-1 β α 48 β 16 , 49 50 The results from our neuroinflammation panel indicated a significant injury effect, in the morphine administration study. The increased levels of this marker were consistent with previous literature, demonstrating increased KC-GRO at 24 hours post-CCI. 51 52 53 54 In our experiment, M3G formed from morphine was not correlated to GFAP immunoreactivity. Although previous proteomic studies in cultured human astrocytes exposed to M3G showed increased signaling, 44 K m 55 C max 5 Conclusion In conclusion, our study revealed differences in injury related to morphine and M3G exposure both systemically and in the brain after morphine administration. This study focused on administration of a single intravenous bolus dose and revealed that it did not result in exacerbated secondary responses after TBI. Considering previous work on neuroinflammatory responses by M3G, it is plausible that multiple intravenous bolus doses or infusion of morphine, which is clinically relevant, may lead to a heightened accumulation or response. These findings support the need for future research to explore the effects of multiple boluses and infusion dosing at later time points postinjury.
