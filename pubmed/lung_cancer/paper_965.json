In 2002, Daikin Industries’ Yodogawa Plant (DIYP) in Settsu City in Japan had contaminated drinking water in Hanshin area with (PFOA),\nleading to the complete cessation of PFOA production in 2012. In 2023, local residents conducted a voluntary Blood Monitoring Campaign with\n1,182 general residents. Blood monitoring was also conducted for former or current workers from DIYP and farming residents in Settsu City.\nSerum PFOA concentrations determined by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry [number: ng/ml: median (25th–75th percentile)] were as\nfollows: former and current workers [N=7: 192.6 (23.3–596.6)] >farming residents [N=5: 70.2 (50.4–98.8)] >general residents [N=1182:\n5.0 (3.3–7.0)] with significant differences (Kruskal–Wallis test, p Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) Interstitial lung disease Dust Inhalation Polymerization of tetrafluoroethylene pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction PFAS (s), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (s), are the class of synthetic chemicals that have been produced from 1940s 1 ) PFAS exposure has been shown to be associated with adverse health effects, including immunotoxicity, impairing lipid metabolism, fetal and\nchild growth inhibition and kidney cancer and other diseases 2 3 ) 4 ) In 2002, high levels of PFOA contamination were discovered in the Yodo River system in Osaka Prefecture in Japan 5 ) 6 ) Our group at Kyoto University has been monitoring drinking water, meals, atmosphere, and human blood, continuing to observe the decrease in\nKeihanshin area 7 8 9 ) 6 ) 10 ) 11 ) The C8 health project is well-known in research regarding the blood levels of PFAS in workers and residents 12 13 ) 13 ) 14 ) 15 ) There have been several reports regarding the exposure media and health effects for end-user workers using commercial products from\nfluorochemical maker industries 16 17 18 ) 16 17 18 ) 19 ) 18 ) The major aims of this study are twofold. For workers in DIYP, the exact exposure routes and kinetic aspects are elusive. Thus we first focus\non former and current DIYP workers and, by comparing them to residents, to chase serum concentrations of PFOA in former and current workers\nunder a condition without occupational exposures. Although several cases with pulmonary diseases have been reported in end-user workers 16 17 18 19 ) Subjects and Methods Study design and study population (Fig. 1) As mentioned in the introduction, the wells adjacent to the east of DIYP still showed high levels of PFOA concentration according to\nsurveys by Osaka prefecture in Japan 10 ) In 2023, a Blood Monitoring Campaign was launched voluntarily by residents in the northern Osaka region where DIYP is located, in\ncollaboration with Kyoto University and the Osaka Miniren, which is a social movement organization consisting of public interest\nincorporated associations and various medical, nursing, and caregiving establishments, including hospitals and 47 medical clinics, that\noperate in the Osaka Prefecture in Japan 20 ) At the time of blood sampling, 12 to18 ml of blood was collected from the cubital vein. Participants were asked to complete a\nself-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire collected information such as birth date, height, weight, residential history, medical\nhistory (including thyroid disease, lipid metabolism disorders, heart disease, liver disease, diabetes, hypertension, ulcerative colitis,\nallergies, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, pregnancy-related abnormalities), use of constipation medication, smoking history, alcohol\nconsumption, use of tap water, well water, water filters, consumption of home-grown produce, fish and seafood intake, use of AFFF,\noccupational exposure, and COVID-19 illness history. However, in the initial farming residents study, the medical history was open-ended.\nSince this study focuses on workers’ PFOA exposure, the analysis was limited to specific factors. For the former and current Daikin workers, detailed interviews were conducted about their work environments, and five participants with\nhigh PFOA exposure underwent medical examinations. Participants were assigned their ages when they participated in the Blood Monitoring Campaign. Those who did not participate in the Blood\nMonitoring Campaign were assigned the ages in which they had at the time of their first blood monitoring. Former and current workers\nrequested to conceal personal information to identify individuals. Thus ages were not shown on the individual basis. Assessment of PFOA exposure Serum was separated by centrifugation conventionally. Serum samples were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC)\nand mass spectrometer (MS) to determine PFAS concentrations. In GC analysis, to 0.10 ml of serum sample, 0.4 ml of acetonitrile and surrogate standard solution (EPA-533ES, Wellington Laboratories,\nCanada) were mixed, centrifuged to remove protein and the supernatant was allowed to dryness. Bis (4-tert-phenyl) iodonium\nhexafluorophosphate (tBPI, Tokyo Kasei Kogyo, Japan) was used as the reagent for in-port derivatization. Each sample extract was dissolved\nin a 1% (w/v) tBPI/Acetone solution and used for injection to GC-MS. PFAS was separated by Agilent 6890N GC inert using DB-5MS (30 m ×\n0.25 mm, 0.25 μm thickness) with splitless injection at an inlet temperature of 300°C. PFAS were measured by 5973N MSD under chemical\nionization (methane gas, negative ionization mode) 21 ) In LC analysis, automated pretreatment system was used for extraction of PFAS (Extrahera classic, Biotage AB, Uppsala, Sweden) based on a\nUS EPA 1633 method 22 ) 13 ® For serum analyses, standard reference material SRM 1957 of US National Institute of Standards and Technology was used for confirmation of\naccuracy and reproducibility. We determined serum concentrations by both GC-MS and LC-MS/MS and determined consistency between GC-MS and\nLC-MS/MS analysis ( Supplementary Table and Fig 2 p Hundred milliliter water sample was divided and mixed with a 13 Soil samples were extracted and analyzed using the following method.

All members of this group engaged in farming on land located within a 1 km radius of\nthe DIYP and had consumed the agricultural products grown there. The serum PFOA concentration in this group had an average (± standard\ndeviation) of 73.8 ± 28.3, with 25% at 50.4, a median of 70.2, and 75% at 98.8, indicating a more dispersed distribution. The former and current workers of DIYP with an average age of 64.3 yr, including three participants from the follow-up monitoring, totaled\nseven participants. Their average (± standard deviation) serum PFOA level was 282.4 ± 294.6, with 25% at 23.3, a median of 192.6, and 75% at\n596.6, showing a heterogeneous distribution in serum concentration. Serum PFOA levels among the three groups of residents were significantly different, with workers having the highest levels, farming\nresidents having intermediate levels, and the general population having the lowest levels (Nonparametric analysis, Kruskal–Wallis test, p Time trend of serum PFOA in farming residents after cessation of crop intakes After the survey in July 2020, it was found that a farming resident R1 had a high serum PFOA concentration ( Table 2 Table 2.

However, since it was unclear how much the constant consumption of these agricultural products affected serum concentrations, a follow-up\nintervention study was conducted after October 2021. Four individuals (R1–R4) refrained from consuming the agricultural products, while one\nparticipant (R5) continued consumption as usual. The results ( Table 2 p Fig. 2 Fig. 2.

He recognized the dustiness of the\nworkplace and wore the provided dust mask. However, when working in the office away from the production area, he sometimes removed the mask,\nand dust would frequently accumulate on his clothing. After leaving DIYP in the mid-2010s, he continued to undergo annual health checkups.\nIn 2021, chest X-rays revealed nodular and granular shadows in his lungs, along with pleural changes. In 2022, he was diagnosed with\nsuspected interstitial pneumonia, and further tests confirmed the diagnosis. He was diagnosed with COVID-19 in January 2023. His current\nsymptoms include frequent coughing, excessive sputum, hoarseness, and weight loss. He has a smoking history between the ages of 20–40 yr,\nbut he quit smoking. Computerize Tomography (CT) scans showed early signs of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis ( Fig. 3A Fig. 3. CT scan of the chest from W1–W5 cases. A: W1, B: W2, C: W4, D: W3, E: W5. An arrow indicates the early sign of interstitial lung disease (ILD). W2: A male worker who joined the company in the 1970s and worked for 5 yr in the fluoroelastomer process, followed by more than 40 yr in\nthe management of the fluoroelastomer process until his retirement in the mid-2010s. His office was next to W1’s work area, with poor air\nsealing, and the office space was shared with W1. Before leaving DIYP, during a general health checkup, lung abnormalities were detected,\nand he was later diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia. CT scans revealed lung fibrosis ( Fig. 3B W4: A male worker who worked in the same processes as W1 in the downstairs workshop from early 2000s to late 2010s until leaving DIYP. CT\nscans revealed no abnormality ( Fig. 3C W3: A female worker who, from early 2010s until early 2020s, was involved in cleaning containers that had been used for shipping “Fine\nPowder”. Daikin had stopped container recycling in 2022. Those containers often contained leftover “Fine Powder” that had been shipped\nbefore 2012. When emptying and cleaning these containers, W3 was exposed to “Fine Powder”. She is a former smoker. She was aware of the\ndustiness of the workplace but had no protective measures against dust exposure. CT scans showed no abnormality ( Fig. 3D W5: A male colleague of W3 who worked from late 2000s to early 2020s. Ordinarily, he did not take any protective measures against dust\nexposure but sometimes typically wore only a commercially available gauze/paper mask. However, during periods of severe dust exposure, he\nsometimes requested for a protective dust mask and wore it. CT scans revealed early changes (arrow) associated with interstitial lung\ndisease (ILD) ( Fig. 3E Lung Disease Findings We also conducted interviews with W6 and W7. W6, a current smoker, worked in the cafeteria at DIYP in the 1990s. He was diagnosed with\nulcerative colitis and with kidney cancer at mid-40s. W7, a former smoker, had been engaged in producing aqueous fluorine-based etching\nagents for semiconductor manufacturing for 18 yr until retirement. These agents contained PFOA as a surfactant. W7 had never handled “Fine\npowder”. Discussion In this study, a blood biomonitoring survey was conducted on local residents around DIYP 12 yr after the complete cessation of production in\n2012 6 ) 26 ) 7 8 9 ) 26 ) The results revealed that farming residents, as well as former or current workers who had been exposed to dust at DIYP, had extremely high\nserum concentrations. Among the farming residents, an intervention study avoiding agricultural products grown on contaminated soil with\ncontaminated groundwater demonstrated a rapid decrease in serum PFOA concentrations, clearly indicating the large burden of agricultural\nproducts. In contrast, follow-up investigations on former or current workers revealed that their concentrations deviated significantly from\nthe expected kinetics predicted by half-life, indicating that excretion from the body was extremely slow. Therefore, the high serum\nconcentrations in this group may be attributed to two possibilities: the high exposure levels at the workplace when they were active workers\nand/or the very slow excretion of PFOA from their bodies. The very slow excretion observed in former and current workers is likely associated with exposure to dust particulates specific to the\nworkers. Among the seven former and current workers, five had high serum concentrations, and all five were related to exposure to dust\ngenerated during the PTFE manufacturing process. The common exposure route among them strongly suggests the possibility of inhalation. Regarding the physicochemical properties of the dust, it cannot be verified through measurement as PFOA was no longer used as a surfactant in\nthis “Molding Powder” producing process. However, in the suspension polymerization process for PTFE production, Daikin was aware of the\ndust-producing work environment at that time, indicating that exposure to dust occurred for those former workers. It is possible that exposure\nto intermediate products generated in such processes occurred, and the PFOA added for emulsion formation was extremely high and may remain in\nthe intermediate products. A report from China indicates that the concentration of such intermediate products can reach 1.1 × 10 6 27 ) 25 ) Additionally, although there is insufficient information on particle size, reports suggest that “Fine Powder” particles are extremely small,\nranging from 0.05 to 0.5 micrometers 25 ) 28 29 30 ) There have been several reports on workers who developed pulmonary diseases by long-term PTFE dust exposure 16 17 18 19 ) Given long retention of PFOA containing dust in the lung, the prolonged PFOA retention in the body has significant implications for workers’\nhealth effects. In PTFE-related workers, two cases of interstitial pneumonia were observed, and early ILD lesions were found in another case\nvia CT, indicating that ILDs might be frequently found in workers exposed to PTFE-related dust. Given interstitial pneumonia in two\nindividuals, the minor ILD lesions in one case may likely represent the early stages of ILDs. We believe that individuals involved in\nPTFE-related processes should be followed up even after retirement to assess potential harmful health effects related to their work. Likewise,\npossible harm effects in general population should also be addressed since PTFE microplastics have been detected in the human lung 31 ) This study has several important limitations. First, there was limited participation from individuals associated with DIYP. Additionally, the\nnumber of farming residents involved in the study was small, so the evidence is limited. Furthermore, participation rate cannot be calculated\nfor the blood monitoring campaign. Second, regarding participants associated with Daikin, information on past work processes and work\nenvironment was constructed only from interviews and literatures, including patents, and was not based on systemic survey and monitoring in\noccupational settings. Third, concerning the PFOA accumulation in the body, although the diagnosis was confirmed by clinical investigation,\nthe presence of PFOA-containing particles was not proven in the lung, and the conclusion is based on speculation. Fourth, due to the\nself-administered nature of the questionnaire, there is a possibility of omissions or memory errors by respondents including past and current\nILDs. Furthermore, regarding PFOA measurements, branched isomer quantification was not included for total PFOA when it was below the\nquantification limit. Also, the LC-MS/MS method used only measured linear form of PFOA. However, it is worth noting that of the 1,190 tests\nconducted, branched isomers were detected in 467 participants, in which they accounted for only 5.8% of the total of PFOA. Thus the impact on\nserum concentration is not expected to be significant, if any. On the other hand, the strength of this study lies in the intervention study, which demonstrated that agricultural products grown in\ncontaminated soil and water can definitively contribute as a potential source of exposure. Additionally, this study clearly demonstrated that\nthe excretion of PFOA is very slow in individuals who were exposed to PFOA-containing dust. Most importantly we confirmed ILDs in former and\ncurrent workers with a very high incidence. In conclusion, for workers involved in PTFE production in the past, medical examinations confirmed cases of ILDs. The risk for workers may\nincrease over time even after retirement. Since pulmonary lesions are typically observed more than 20 yr after exposure, it is necessary to\nfollow up with both current and former workers who were involved in the PTFE process or who shared a work environment with exposed workers.\nConversely, if a case of ILDs is identified among current or former workers at DIYP, it is also recommended to review their dust exposure\nhistory related to the PTFE process. The potential for increased risk of ILDs has likely been overlooked, and it is urgent to conduct\nfollow-up studies on workers to understand the mechanisms and take appropriate preventive/medical actions. Finally, the relationship between\nPFOA exposure and the occurrence of ILD in this study is not necessarily clear, and evidence such as macrophage function and lung damage is\nneeded to strengthen the associations.
