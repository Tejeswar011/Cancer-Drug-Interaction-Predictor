Introduction Freshwater ecosystems such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands provide essential benefits for environmental sustainability, economic development, and human health [ 1 2 1 3 Lake sediments are highly complex and dynamic systems that act as both sinks and secondary sources for various pollutants, including persistent organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), potentially toxic elements (PTEs), and naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs) [ 4 5 6 7 7 8 9 6 Priority PTEs such as arsenic, cadmium, chromium, nickel, and lead receive special attention due to their persistence and bioaccumulating toxic effects [ 10 11 12 13 14 1 3 15 16 17 18 19 In recent decades, geochemical and radiological assessments have become essential for determining contaminant loads in freshwater lakes, particularly in regions experiencing rapid land-use changes and upstream industrial activity [ 20 21 22 23 24 Niu et al. [ 25 26 13 6 21 40 Nasser Lake is a large freshwater reservoir located in southern Egypt, connected to the Aswan High Dam. The lake plays an essential role in agricultural support, national water security, and biodiversity protection. However, its sediments are increasingly contaminated due to industrial activities, agricultural runoff, and natural erosion processes. Most previous studies on Nasser Lake have focused on sedimentation [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. The Study Area High Dam Lake is located between 20°27′–23°58′ N and 30°07′–33°15′ E, at an elevation of 182 m above mean sea level in the lower Nile River Basin, near the Egyptian border with Sudan. It stretches for 500 km in length, with 350 km along Egypt’s border (where it is called Nasser Lake) and 150 km along Sudan’s border (where it is known as Nubia Lake). The lake was formed in the late 1960s and early 1970s as a result of the construction of the Aswan High Dam, which was built approximately 5 km south of Aswan city, upstream of the old Aswan Dam [ 35 36 34 2 Figure 1 31 37 38 2.2. Sample Collection and Preparation Forty sediment samples were collected from the eastern and western banks of southern Nasser Lake, including khors and islands ( Figure 1 2.3. Samples Analyses 2.3.1. Sediment Granulometry The organic matter content (OM%) in the studied sediments was estimated using the loss-on-ignition method [ 39 40 2.3.2. Mineralogy Following the recommendations of Mange and Maurer [ 41 3 41 42 2.3.3. Geochemical Analysis The major and trace element analyses were conducted using an Axios Sequential Wavelength Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (WD-XRF) Spectrometer (PANalytical, 2021, Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK) following the ASTM E-1621 [ 43 2.3.4. Radiometric Analysis The lake sediment samples were dried, homogenized, placed into 100 mL standard plastic containers, and tightly sealed with Teflon tape around the screw necks and wide vinyl tape over the caps. They were stored for 30 days before the examination. The radiogenic gases 220 222 238 232 44 238 234 232 212 40 60 137 2.4. Environmental Assessment Indices 2.4.1. Metals Contamination Indices Single pollution indices, such as the Enrichment Factor (EF) [ 45 geo 46 47 n 48 49 50 49 Background values often serve as a baseline for accurately differentiating between elevated concentrations of chemical elements caused by anthropogenic activities and their natural concentrations. The sediments covering the study area were derived from the weathering of various rock types. Thus, the background values were based on the chemical composition of the Upper Continental Crust (UCC) [ 51 Table S1 (Supplementary Materials) 2.4.2. Radiation Hazard Indices Calculation To assess the external radiation hazards from the activity concentration of the measured radionuclides in the studied sediment of Nasser Lake, the following indices were calculated: the radium equivalent activity index (Ra eq 52 53 ex 53 54 53 53 55 56 57 Table S2 2.5. Data Treatment ArcGIS (version 10.8.1; 2020) with a raster interpolation technique (Spline-Tension) was used to display the measured PTEs’ locations and spatial distribution maps in Nasser Lake. OriginLab (version OriginPro 2021) was used to present descriptive statistics, box-plot figures, and multivariate statistical analyses. Microsoft Excel (version Microsoft Office 365 16.0.15028.20160) was used to calculate contamination levels and health risk assessments. The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF 5.0) model, provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), was employed to identify and quantify PTE sources. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Textural Characteristics The results of the grain size analysis and the identified grain size parameters for the studied sediment samples are provided in the Supplementary Materials (Tables S3 and S4) 58 59 59 Based on the cumulative curves ( Figure S1 I I Figure S2 27 The organic matter content (OM%) of these sediments ranges from 0.00 to 1.99%, averaging 0.85%. Sediment texture is considered the primary control on organic matter distribution in the lake [ 58 60 3.2. Mineralogy and Mineral Chemistry The majority of the light fraction of minerals in the study area consists of quartz and feldspar grains. The heavy mineral index percentages in the studied sediments range from 0.16% to 30.37%, with an average of 4.27% ( Table S5 Table S5 59 61 Figure 2 41 The ultrastable group includes zircon, rutile, and tourmaline ( Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 4 The metastable group includes monazite, garnet, epidote, staurolite, kyanite, sillimanite, and apatite ( Figure 2 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 The unstable group includes pyroxenes, amphiboles, sphene, biotite, and muscovite ( Figure 2 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 The ZTR index provides a quantitative measure of the mineralogical maturity of heavy mineral assemblages [ 42 Table S5 62 63 The heavy mineral assemblage and the presence of both prismatic and rounded forms of ultrastable heavy minerals (zircon, rutile, and tourmaline) in the studied sediments suggest that the study area has a distinct heavy mineral source. Kandil et al. [ 59 64 The majority of the investigated sediments contain considerable amounts of pyroxenes and amphiboles, indicating a contribution from the basement rocks of the Red Sea Hills to the distribution of these minerals. The presence of staurolite, kyanite, epidote, biotite, muscovite, and garnet suggests a metamorphic origin [ 65 23 66 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis of the mud-sized fraction revealed several minerals, including precious metals such as gold ( Figure S3a Figure S3c,e Figure S4a Figure S4c Figure S4e Figure S4g Figure S5a Figure S5c Figure S5e Figure S5g 3.3.

PTEs Distribution The elemental composition obtained by XRF analysis of the studied sediment samples ( Table S6 2 3 Table 1 Figure 6 Compared to the background values of the Upper Continental Crust (UCC) [ 51 Table 1 33 67 68 3.3.2. Metal Contamination and Ecological Risk The EF values were calculated to assess the impact of anthropogenic activities on the PTEs in the studied sediment samples, and the results are presented in Table 2 Figure 6 45 69 70 71 The calculated I geo Table 2 Figure 6 geo 47 geo geo geo geo The present results are generally consistent with earlier studies on Lake Nasser sediments [ 33 34 35 33 35 34 geo The EF and I geo 25 geo 26 geo 21 geo geo However, EF and I geo n 48 72 The calculated P n Table 3 Figure 6 n 48 Table 3 Figure 6 49 50 48 49 Table 3 Figure 6 Figure 7 n The contribution of each PTE to the PLI and PERI values in the study area is presented in Figure 8 3.3.3. PTEs Source Apportionment Correlation analysis is an efficient way to assess the intensity and linkage between the analyzed PTEs through Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC). PTEs with significant correlations may originate from the same source [ 73 74 Table 4 2 3 2 3 2 2 5 72 68 The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model was used to identify and quantify the contribution of each source to PTEs. The model identified four distinct sources contributing to the observed PTE concentrations in the sediments of Nasser Lake ( Figure 9 75 66 76 2 3 2 3 2 Factor 2 is characterized by high contributions from Cd (95.4%) and Pb (71.1%), all of which are indicative of industrial activities and fossil fuel combustion. Cd, in particular, exceeded the Upper Continental Crust (UCC) values in 75% of the samples and exhibited extremely high EF and Igeo indices, underscoring its dominance in this pollution group. Cd is commonly linked to industrial activities and phosphate fertilizers [ 77 78 79 geo Factor 3 shows high loadings of As (30.1%), Co (81.7%), Cr (20.8%), and Cu (19.3%). These elements are commonly linked to agrochemical inputs and urban effluents, including arsenic-containing pesticides, fertilizers, and domestic wastewater. A significant positive correlation was observed between As and Co (R = 0.75; Table 4 71 80 81 82 Factor 4 is uniquely dominated by Mo (95%), suggesting atmospheric input through the dry deposition of Mo-rich aerosols, likely from remote industrial activities [ 83 84 85 The PMF results corroborate the pollution assessment in Section 3.3.2 geo 86 87 88 89 Biological activity and biomineralization processes can also influence the redistribution of PTEs in lake sediments, affecting contaminant mobility and bioavailability. Microorganisms and benthic organisms may contribute to the transformation of PTEs through redox processes, biosorption, and the formation of biogenic minerals, consequently potentially decreasing or increasing pollution risk. However, the role of these biological processes in Nasser Lake’s sediments has not been thoroughly investigated. Future research should investigate the effects of biomineralization and microbial activity on PTE dynamics to gain a better understanding of their environmental fate and ecological implications. 3.4.

Radionuclide Behavior and Activity Ratios Sediments can be classified into three distinct categories based on their Th/U ratios [ 92 The data reveal that the eTh/eU ratios of the analyzed sediments fall within the third group, indicating limited weathering and swift deposition of rock detritus ( Table 5 Figure 11 6+ 4+ 93 6+ 4+ 2 2+ 94 95 Radium exists only in the divalent oxidation state in solution.

Conclusions The study provides a comprehensive assessment of the environmental status of Nasser Lake sediments. The sediment’s sandy texture with low organic content (0.85%) indicates deposition in a high-energy environment, while the heavy mineral assemblages (zircon, rutile, tourmaline) and the presence of radioactive and rare-earth-element-bearing minerals (monazite, thorite) in the fine fractions suggest complex sediment sources including Nile River inputs, aeolian deposits, and erosion of surrounding basement rocks.
