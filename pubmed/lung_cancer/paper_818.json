Methods The clinical data of 159 patients with BCOS admitted to Qilu Hospital of Shandong University Dezhou Hospital from January 2019 to November 2024 were collected and analyzed. All the patients had complete color Doppler echocardiography at this hospital and were separated into experimental group (106 cases, BCOS with PH) and control group (53 cases, BCOS not combined with PH group), according to whether they were complicated with pulmonary hypertension or not. And then the experimental group was divided into mild, moderate and severe subgroups. The correlation of NLR, RDW with pulmonary artery systolic blood pressure (PASP) in BCOS patients was analyzed. And whether there were differences or not between NLR and RDW among experimental group, control group as well as subgroups was compared. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the efficacy of NLR and RDW in distinguishing between “PH‐complicated” and “non‐PH‐complicated” statuses among BCOS patients at the cross‐sectional level. Results First, the level of NLR and RDW in experimental group was higher than those in control group, in addition the difference was statistically significant ( p p p p p p p p p r p 2 p Conclusions The level of NLR and RDW is related to the severity of pulmonary arterial pressure in patients with BCOS.

The etiology of this disease is multifactorial, encompassing infectious agents, immune system dysfunctions, and genetic predispositions. Repeated damage and/or obstruction of the small and medium bronchi leads to structural destruction of the bronchial walls, ultimately resulting in chronic bronchiectasis. Patients frequently experience chronic cough, excessive sputum production, and may develop intermittent hemoptysis; in severe cases, this can progress to respiratory failure. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous lung disorder characterized by abnormalities in the airways (such as bronchitis and bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (such as emphysema), often marked by persistent and progressive airflow limitation. It is previously believed that bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are distinct and independent conditions. However, recent studies have revealed a significant overlap between bronchiectasis and COPD, with the prevalence of bronchiectasis in COPD patients ranging from 26% to 69% [ 1 2 3 4 5  Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6 Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a condition characterized by alterations in pulmonary vascular structure and function, resulting from various etiologies. Without timely intervention, PH can progressively worsen, ultimately leading to chronic cor pulmonale, which manifests as right ventricular dysfunction. This condition often has a poor prognosis and is associated with significantly increased mortality. Studies have demonstrated that the incidence of pulmonary hypertension is high in patients with COPD [ 7 8 Currently, limited research has been conducted on BCOS combined with PH, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Patients with BCOS who are accompanied by pulmonary arterial hypertension usually have a poorer prognosis. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of BCOS combined with PH are crucial for improving patient outcomes. In light of this, this study investigates the correlation between peripheral serum neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and red cell distribution width (RDW) levels in patients with BCOS combined with PH. The findings offer valuable clinical insights for the early detection and assessment of PH in BCOS patients. 2 Methods 2.1 Subjects and Grouping Clinical data were collected and analyzed from 159 patients diagnosed with BCOS admitted to the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University Dezhou Hospital, between January 2019 and November 2024. All patients underwent color Doppler echocardiography in our hospital using a Philips EPIQ CVx color Doppler ultrasound system, performed by sonographers with at least 5 years of work experience. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) was measured via the tricuspid regurgitation velocity method, with the calculation formula: PASP = 4 × V 2 2.2 Rationale for Sample Size Determination Based on the HIS, a total of 205 patients with probable cases diagnosed with BCOS between January 2019 and November 2024 were found initially. Through stringent screening according to inclusion and exclusion criterions, 46 cases were excluded because of lack of baseline data, comorbid conditions with other underlying diseases that may lead to PH, and other reasons. In total, 159 eligible cases were eventually enrolled. Sample size statistical power was verified using post hoc analysis with G*Power 3.1 software. For the primary outcome indicator, that is, the correlation between NLR and the severity of pulmonary hypertension in BCOS patients, referring to the research results of Zuo et al. [ 9 f 10 f The sample size of this study (159 cases) was comparable to that of published retrospective studies in the same field (with sample sizes ranging from 78 to 213 cases) [ 9 10 2.3 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria: (1) All patients had complete inpatient medical records; (2) Patients met the diagnostic criteria for BCOS established by the BRONCH‐UK consortium, with independent diagnosis by two experienced clinicians. In cases of disagreement, consensus was reached through discussion. The diagnostic criteria are as follows: ① Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): presence of physiological features of irreversible airflow limitation, that is, forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV 1 1 2.4 Data Collection Clinical and laboratory parameters were collected for all patients at admission, including age, gender, BMI, smoking history, comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease), as well as blood routine parameters, absolute neutrophil count (NEUT), absolute lymphocyte count (LYMPH), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), D‐dimer, and partial pressure of oxygen (PO 2 2.5 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 27.0 software.

Specifically, RDW alone had better discriminatory power than NLR, and the AUC of combined detection was slightly higher than that of RDW alone, while it had better specificity compared with the two single indexes. These results indicate that combined detection has greater ability to detect PH in BCOS patients in a cross‐sectional manner.

FIGURE 1 Evaluation of the predictive value of NLR, RDW, and their combination for BCOS complicated with PH using ROC curve analysis. 4 Discussion The neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a recognized biomarker of systemic inflammation and stress response. As a comprehensive indicator, NLR provides a more accurate evaluation of the systemic inflammatory response and disease prognosis compared to white blood cell (WBC) count, lymphocyte count, and neutrophil count. Owing to its advantages of easy accessibility, non‐invasive procedures, and cost‐effectiveness, this method has been extensively utilized in clinical research. Previous studies have demonstrated the prognostic value of NLR in patients with various solid tumors [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 9 It has been reported that RDW is associated with inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) [ 21 22 23 24 10 25 26 This present study demonstrated that NLR and RDW were significantly higher in BCOS patients with PH, and both were positively correlated with the PASP. The levels of these markers were most elevated in the severe PH group, and the results of further multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the NLR and RDW were independent risk factors for the patients with PH complicated by BCOS. One of the essential reasons why this is possible is the “complicated pathological features” of BCOS: ① Cause of high NLR: The main inflammatory cells of bronchiectasis and COPD are neutrophils and T lymphocytes. Neutrophils release the proteases and cause bronchial structural destruction, and T lymphocytes promote the enlargement of peripheral bronchial lymph node and chronic bronchitis [ 6 27 28 29 In the current study, RDW values of the severe PH group were higher than those of the mild PH group, but there was no significant difference from the moderate PH group. The possible reason may be some degrees of erythropoiesis disorder in the moderate PH group or the relatively small number of the moderate group ( n The intermediate AUC obtained for NLR (AUC = 0.628), RDW (AUC = 0.751) and their combination (AUC = 0.756) in our study can be justified by the fact that both are non‐specific inflammatory/hypoxia markers and do not capture all pathophysiological aspects of BCOS‐PH (e.g., pulmonary vascular remodeling, endothelial dysfunction). We still note an AUC for RDW similar to that of biomarkers for COPD‐associated PH presented in other studies [ 10 7 8 1 In conclusion, NLR and RDW share partial correlations with complex BCOS complicated with PH. As routine indexes routinely tested in blood, NLR and RDW possess merits like simplicity and low cost and show superiority when combined as an effective test to screen for PH complicated with complex BCOS. In primary hospitals, their central significance should lie in providing primary help in early PH detection and stratification from routine blood tests—a role that leads to further echocardiography, or adjustments to interventions (e.g., optimizing anti‐inflammatory treatment, improving oxygenation), which can greatly contribute to further improvements in patients' prognosis and quality of life. The drawbacks of this study are: (1) The single‐center retrospective design makes it prone to selection bias. Additionally, the completeness and accuracy of data on clinical variables (including disease duration and frequency of acute exacerbations) are limited, and these variables were not included in the multi‐factor model for strict control, which may have indirectly affected the results; (2) In this study, the identification of pulmonary hypertension (PH) was based exclusively on echocardiographic estimation of pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), rather than the definitive diagnostic method of right heart catheterization (RHC). It is recognized that this approach has certain drawbacks. However, the independent correlations of NLR and RDW observed in the multi‐factor regression analysis, as well as the consistent trend between their levels and PH grades, indicate that the main findings of the present study are somewhat robust. Future research may further elucidate the temporal sequence between changes in their levels and the onset of PH through prospective cohort studies, confirm the results using right heart catheterization, and strictly control confounders such as disease duration and frequency of acute exacerbations to further enhance their clinical application value.
