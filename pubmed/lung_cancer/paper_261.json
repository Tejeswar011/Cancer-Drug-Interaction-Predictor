While a variety of volume imaging methods, including novel light microscopy tools, are now well established to probe the cellular complexity of organoids in 3D, the gold standard for obtaining a precise morphological picture is histology, a traditionally 2D imaging technique that relies on slicing the specimen and therefore has severe limitations in scalability and volumetric imaging. X-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) has emerged as an imaging modality capable of extending conventional histology into the third dimension. While it has been applied to various types of animal and human tissues, its applicability to organoid systems, however, is yet in its infancy. Here, we use XPCT for 3D histology of unstained and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human heart-forming organoids (HFOs) at multiple scales and with isotropic resolution. Derived from human pluripotent stem cells, HFOs are a complex and highly structured in vitro model of early heart, foregut and vasculature development, resembling the early human heart-forming region. Using highly coherent synchrotron radiation, we show that HFOs and their different tissue elements can be visualized in their full three-dimensionality and at subcellular scale. The intricate structure of human heart-forming organoids, including their various tissue components and vascularization, is studied in its three-dimensionality and at the subcellular level using multiscale X-ray phase-contrast tomography.

They reflect key spatial structure and organ functionality of their in vivo counterparts 1 2 3 5 Imaging is of central importance to probe the complex morphology of organoids. In particular, volume imaging methods are required to fully capture the micro-anatomy and cellular complexity of the 3D structure. The development of organoid systems over the past decade has greatly benefited from microscopic approaches such as confocal, multiphoton, and more recently light sheet fluorescence microscopy, to probe the 3D tissue structure together with detailed molecular information, i.e., by visualizing single-cell gene expression, as reviewed in refs. 6 8 The unique potential of X-ray phase-contrast tomography (XPCT) to extend histology into the third dimension has been demonstrated in recent years for tissues from various organs, such as cardiac tissue 9 10 11 12 13 15 16 18 δ r n r δ r i β r β r β 19 20 δ r In this work, we demonstrate a multiscale approach for 3D virtual histology of recently established human heart-forming organoids (HFOs) 21 22 1 NKX2.5 21 Fig. 1 The human heart-forming organoid. a b c b c 21 To study the complex 3D morphology of these highly structured multi-tissue organoids, we use two different X-ray optical configurations for synchrotron radiation, namely the parallel-beam (SR-PB) setup and the cone-beam (SR-CB) setup, both implemented at the Göttingen Instrument for Nano-Imaging with X-Rays (GINIX) endstation of the P10 beamline at the Deutsches Elektronensynchrotron (DESY, Hamburg, Germany), and in addition a commercial laboratory μ 2 2 Fig. 2 Sample preparation and X-ray tomography setups. a b d b μ c d In this manuscript, we first describe details of sample preparation, tomographic instrumentation, and data acquisition, post-processing of tomographic data, and image analysis in the Methods section. In the following Results section, we demonstrate that important structural features of interest including the different tissue layers of an HFO can be effectively visualized by both synchrotron XPCT - with scalable FOV and resolution in the sense of multiscale imaging - and by laboratory μ Results 3D virtual histology and correlation with conventional 2D histology Figure 3 3 Fig. 3 3D virtual histology of HFOs by parallel-beam synchrotron radiation and correlative imaging. a b c d e f g The results show comparable morphological information, importantly, the three different layers IC, ML, and OL can be well distinguished in the virtual section. In contrast to conventional histology, non-invasive XPCT provides the structure of the HFO in its full three-dimensionality, exemplified in Fig. 3 3 3 3 Together, Fig. 3 1 21 Laboratory-based μ- Next, we demonstrate the capability of a laboratory X-ray microscopy setup for 3D virtual histology of HFOs. Figure 4 μ 4 Fig. 4 3D virtual histology of HFOs based on laboratory μ a b 3 c 3 b A direct comparison of the image quality between the laboratory dataset and the dataset obtained from the SR-PB configuration at the synchrotron is shown in Fig. 4 4 4 3 5–7 μ 4 4 2 High-resolution XPCT with X-ray waveguide optics Figure 5 4 5 5 2 Fig. 5 High-resolution XPCT of an HFO. a b b c b c a a c The transition from the IC to the ML can be clearly identified, e.g., as indicated in Fig. 5 5 5 μ 5–7 23 Segmentation and visualization of features of interest The image quality of the high resolution tomographic reconstruction presented in Fig. 5 6 Fig. 6 Segmentation of the cardiomyocytes cell nuclei in the myocardial layer using the high-resolution tomographic dataset. a b c d The semi-automatic segmentation was performed by using the Blob Finder algorithm implemented in Arivis Vision4D (Zeiss AG, Germany), which is designed to find round, sphere-like objects, as e.g., recently applied to the segmentation of granule cell nuclei in the human cerebellum in an XPCT dataset 24 3 3 Next, Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Branching of vessel-like structures and segmentation. a b c a c While cross-sectional vessel-like structures can be clearly identified in 2D histological sections in Fig. 7 3 7 7 Discussion In summary, the present work demonstrates that propagation-based XPCT can be used for 3D tissue characterization of formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) human HFOs. The examples presented here show that the tissue architecture of the entire organoids as well as important structural features, i.e., of different types of tissue within the organoid, can be mapped in their full three dimensionality and at subcellular level. In contrast to conventional histology, XPCT provides digitized 3D volumes with isotropic resolution which can be virtually sliced in any arbitrary direction without physical sectioning. While first applications of XPCT as well as μ 25 28 29 The multiscale approach enables large FOV and high throughput scans of entire punch biopsies using a parallel beam configuration and high resolution zoom scans at regions of interest based on cone beam magnification. Importantly, HFOs - but many other organoid systems as well - can be produced in large quantities with a high reproducibility. For the present case, the mean success rate of about 88% 21 NKX2.5 4 2 Sub-regions can be scanned at higher resolution by using the cone-beam setup based on nano-focusing for holographic imaging. In this work, this has been demonstrated by scanning a region that includes parts of the IC and the ML, providing the highly resolved 3D structure of the cardiomyocytes network, vessel-like structures and endodermal cavities. The magnification can generally be adjusted by the distance between the sample and the waveguide. Note, that there is always a trade-off between FOV and effective pixel size, i.e., a larger magnification results in a smaller effective pixel size and at the same time in a smaller FOV. In terms of high resolution, XPCT has been demonstrated at effective pixel sizes of well below 100 nm 30 32 31 33 34 The image quality of the SR-CB data allows for the observation of fine structural details in 3D. The illustrative examples presented in this work showcase that quantitative information can be obtained through segmentation of structures of interest such as cell nuclei in the ML, which yields 3D shape and density information, as well as vessel-like structures. For the latter, segmented XPCT data enables to assess a detailed 3D analysis of the vascular network with the potential to elucidate early developmental stages of angio- and vasculogenesis, one of the earliest processes in embryonic organogenesis 35 36 37 38 Finally, we have shown that a laboratory μ 5–6 7 μ 39 40 μ Regarding tissue preparation, we note that XPCT is not limited to paraffin-embedded samples. While the strength of FFPE samples clearly lies in their compatibility with established histological methods and very good image quality measures in XPCT, shrinkage of tissues in general, but also specifically of HFOs, has been observed during invasive fixation/dehydration and paraffin embedding (note, however, that the shape and tissue structure, including cavities, are very well preserved in HFOs when compared with results from complementary methods such as whole-mount immunofluorescence and cryosection staining 21 41 42 12 All together, we have shown that both synchrotron-based XPCT and laboratory-based nano/ μ 43 Methods Formation and culture of HFOs Experiments using hESC lines are performed under allowance ‘108: Genehmigung nach dem Stammzellgesetz’ granted by the Robert Koch Institute (Berlin, Germany). The following cell lines were used: HES3 NKX2.5-eGFP 44 45 21 22 Sample preparation for X-ray tomographic recordings and histology Organoids were fixed with 4% PFA at 4 ∘ ∘ ∘ ∘ For X-ray tomographic recordings, HFOs were punched out by using a biopsy punch either with a diameter of one or three mm, resulting in a cylindrical shape of the specimen which is beneficial for the final image quality. The biopsy punches were then mounted on a brass pin, either free-standing in the case of 3 mm punches or placed into a polyimide (Kapton) tube for stabilization of 1 mm punches, see Fig. 2 Propagation-based X-ray phase-contrast tomography Tomographic datasets were acquired by means of propagation-based XPCT at the Göttingen Instrument for Nano-Imaging with X-Rays (GINIX) holo-tomography endstation of the P10 undulator beamline (Petra III, DESY, Hamburg, Germany) 46 2 47 47 X-ray tomographic recordings with relatively large field-of-views of approximately 1.5 × 1.5 mm 2 2 ∘ x 12 47 1 Table 1 Experimental parameters SR-PB setup SR-CB setup HFO Sample 1 HFO Sample 2 and Sample 3 HFO NKX2.5-KO HFO Sample 4 No. projections 3000 3000 3000 1500 FOV ( h v 2 1.6 × 1.4 1.6 × 1.4 1.6 × 1.4 0.32 × 0.27 x 01 88 88 88 0.1002 x 12 0.033 0.022 0.022 5.01 p x eff 650 650 650 127 Exposure time (s) 0.035 0.035 0.035 1 Total exposure time (s) 75 75 75 1500 Energy (keV) 8.08 11 13.8 13.8 Fresnel Number 0.0834 0.1622 0.2138 1.8 × 10 −3 δ β 65 65 65 65 α low−freq 0 0 0 0.005 α high−freq 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 Acquisition and reconstruction parameters for the SR-PB and SR-CB setups and for the different HFO samples. x 01 x 12 p x eff F h v δ β α low−freq α high−freq High-resolution X-ray tomographic scans were recorded based on geometric magnification by cone-beam illumination (SR-CB setup). After passing the upstream slit system, the X-ray beam was focused by the Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors to approximately 300 nm, and then coupled into an X-ray waveguide resulting in a further reduction of the beam size with a sub-50 nm spot size, high spatial coherence and a filtered wavefront. For the photon energy of 13.8 keV, a germanium waveguide was used with 200 mm optical depth and a channel diameter of 100 nm. For a single tomogram, 1500 projections were recorded with a fiber-coupled sCMOS camera (Zyla 5.5 HF, Andor) with 2560 × 2160 pixels of 6.5 μm pixel size.

To this end, four HFOs and one NKX2.5-knockout HFO were imaged, of which three HFOs were used for further H&E-histological analysis to enable correlative imaging. All HFOs displaying the typical NKX2.5-eGFP layered pattern were considered to be successfully formed. Only these successfully formed HFOs were used in this study (see ref. 21 Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary Supplementary information  Transparent Peer Review file Supplementary Information Description of Additional Supplementary Files Supplementary Data 1 Reporting Summary Publisher’s note Supplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s42003-025-08876-1.
