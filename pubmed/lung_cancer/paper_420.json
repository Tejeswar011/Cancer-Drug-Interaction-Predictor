Patient overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QOL) indicators have improved significantly with the availability of doublet combination therapies consisting of androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) [ 1 1 2 3 4 de novo 5 6 6 6 6 The efficacy of metastasis‐directed therapy (MDT) for PCa with multiple bone metastases (poly‐PCa) has not yet been clarified [ 3 7 8 8 2 Methods We are currently conducting a single‐arm prospective interventional study on the combination of enzalutamide, denosumab, LRT, and MDT to improve the oncological outcomes in patients with poly‐PCa. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gifu University (approval number 2021‐B041) and is registered with UMIN at the following link: https://center6.umin.ac.jp/cgi‐open‐bin/ctr/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000062255 https://center6.umin.ac.jp/ice/62255 1 9 10 3 Endpoints and Statistical Analysis The primary endpoint of this study was PFS. The secondary endpoints were OS, cancer‐specific survival, response rate, and adverse events. Progression was defined as PSA progression, the appearance of new lesions, or tumor regrowth on imaging studies (as assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) [ 11 p p 4 Results Enrollment in the study began in December 2021; 20 patients have been registered by May 2024, of whom 11 were followed up until May 2025 (Table 1 1 TABLE 1 Patient characteristics and early oncological outcomes.

FIGURE 1 The progression‐free survival (PFS) of the enrolled patients was evaluated using Kaplan–Meier method. The one‐year PFS rate and median PFS were 84.4% and 18 months, respectively. 5 Discussion To date, no prospective studies have reported the combination of ARSI, LRT, denosumab, and MDT for poly‐PCa. Therefore, the presentation of the interim results of this single‐arm prospective study is considered meaningful for establishing treatment strategies for poly‐PCa. ARSI has been reported to enhance the therapeutic effect of LRT due to its ability to cause DNA damage, as compared to conventional ADT [ 12 13 1 14 15 16 The present study is subject to several potential limitations. Regarding MDT, the number of patients who met the eligibility criteria for MDT in this study was limited, potentially causing an underestimation of its effectiveness. Moreover, given that this study uses a single‐arm design, it is not possible to compare the treatment outcomes of patients with PCa who received the current standard therapy with those who received our treatment regimen. Therefore, our study does not provide conclusive evidence regarding the efficacy of the treatment method used. Notably, this ongoing study is prospectively investigating a multimodal treatment strategy for poly‐PCa, including LRT. As a relatively large number of patients have already achieved sufficient reductions in PSA levels and there have been no cases of radiological progression, this treatment strategy is expected to improve the oncological outcomes of patients with poly‐PCa. Additionally, we are confident that reporting the interim results of this trial will contribute to the treatment of poly‐PCa. In the future, the number of registered cases will be increased, and the observation period will be extended until December 2027, with no additional extensions, and provide more comprehensive reports on this promising new treatment approach.
