Introduction Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious cardiovascular disease characterized by pulmonary artery (PA) remodeling. Referring to European data, PH was estimated at 5.8 cases per million adults annually, while its prevalence ranges from 47.6 to 54.7 cases per million adults [ 1 2 3 Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 4 5 6 7 In the lungs affected by PH, there is not only abnormal proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), but also an accumulation of immune cells such as macrophages, which have garnered attention, particularly those expressing glycoprotein non-metastatic B (GPNMB) [ 8 8 9 10 11 12 8 The lung–gut axis refers to the interactions and relationships that exist between the lungs and intestines [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Although the role of gut microbiota in PH has been explored, no studies to date have examined the effects of Probio-M9 on both gut microbiota composition and GPNMB/CD44 expression in PH. We hypothesized that Probio-M9 supplementation would remodel the gut microbiota and modulate immune responses in the lungs, thereby reducing vascular remodeling and improving outcomes in a monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PH rat model. In addition to analyzing gut bacteria, we also investigated the changes in the expression of GPNMB and CD44 in the lungs. Understanding the interactions between the lung and intestinal microbiota may provide valuable insights into novel therapeutic approaches for PH. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Monocrotaline (MCT)-Induced PH Model Rats All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the institutional and National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Rats were housed at 23–25 °C in a humidity-controlled colony room, maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle, and provided with a standard diet and water. Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats received a subcutaneous injection of monocrotaline (MCT, Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) (60 mg/kg) on day 1 ( Figure 1 9 n n 2.2. Echocardiography in Rats Anesthesia was induced in rats using 5% isoflurane and maintained using 2% isoflurane (Fujifilm-wako, Osaka, Japan). Echocardiography was performed randomly in a blinded manner using a LOGIQ ultrasound machine (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) and equipped with a 5–11.5 MHz multifrequency probe. The probe was gently applied to the left thorax and adjusted to obtain optimal images of the ventricle and PA. Right ventricular (RV) systolic and diastolic functions and ventricular wall thickness were evaluated. Once the procedure was completed, anesthesia was discontinued, and the rats were placed in a warm recovery cage and monitored until fully awake. The recovery status of the rats was monitored and documented to ensure their wellbeing. Subsequent procedures, including tissue sampling, were performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines for animal experiments. 2.3. Immunofluorescence Staining of the Lung Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were deparaffinized, and antigen retrieval was performed by incubating them in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95 °C for 20 min. After blocking with Blocking One Histo (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), the sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The antibodies used are listed in Table 1 Subsequently, the sections were incubated with fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies for 60 min at room temperature. Nuclear staining was performed using DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Fluorescence images were obtained using a confocal laser-scanning fluorescence microscope (LSM 700; Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). 2.4. Clinical Samples for Histological Evaluations Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue samples were used in this study. Lung tissues of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and those without PH or PA remodeling were obtained by biopsy and autopsy at Okayama University and Kagawa University ( Table 2 2.5. Extraction of Fecal DNA and Metagenomic Sequencing Fifteen fecal samples were collected from each group (CTR = 5, MCT = 5, and MCT-M9 = 5) after the intervention. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The extracted DNA’s quality, purity, and integrity were evaluated with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer, 1.0% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the Qubit ® ® ® 2.6. Quality Control of Metagenomic Data A total of 15 fecal samples underwent shotgun sequencing, yielding 104.51 Gb of high-quality paired-end reads, with an average of 6.97 ± 0.79 Gb per sample (ranging from 5.73 to 8.71 Gb). To filter out low-quality sequences and mouse-contaminating reads, KneadData ( http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/kneaddata 2.7. Metagenomic Assembly, Contig Binning, Genome Dereplication To derive species-level genome bins (SGBs) from the post-quality control metagenomic dataset, MEGAHIT (v1.2.9) was used to assemble the reads from each sample into contigs. Subsequently, MetaBAT2 (v2.15) was applied to the bin contigs longer than 200 bp, resulting in the generation of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Subsequently, reads were aligned back to the respective contigs using BWA-MEM2 (v2.2.1), with the read depth calculated using SAMtools (v1.18) and the jgi_summarize_bam_contig_ depth function in MetaBAT2. The completeness can be estimated by detecting the proportion of conserved single-copy genes in the MAG. The contamination is calculated by counting the frequency of the occurrence of multiple copies of the same marker gene. The completeness and contamination of the MAGs were evaluated using CheckM (v1.2.2), categorizing them as follows: high-quality (completeness ≥ 80%, contamination ≤ 5%), partial quality (completeness ≥ 50%, contamination ≤ 5%), and medium quality (completeness ≥ 70%, contamination ≤ 10%). Finally, dRep (v3.0.1) was used to cluster and extract SGBs from high-quality genomes, employing the parameter settings -pa 0.95 and -sa 0.95. We ultimately identified 89 SGBs. 2.8. Taxonomic Annotation, Abundance, Prediction of Gut Metabolic Modules of SGBs To obtain species annotations, SGBs were annotated using Kraken2 (v2.1.3) in conjunction with the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) non-redundant Nucleotide Sequence Database using the default settings. Putative genes were identified using the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB, release 2020.11) via the BLASTP function of DIAMOND (v2.1.7), with default parameters. Abundance for each SGB was calculated using CoverM ( https://github.com/wwood/CoverM 2.9. Statistical Analyses The n n p Statistical analyses of the metagenome analyses were conducted using R software (v. 4.2.1), with data expressed as mean ± SD. The Shannon–Wiener index and Chao 1 richness were calculated using R packages, including vegan, ggpubr, and dplyr, to assess changes in microbial diversity within the fecal samples. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on the Bray–Curtis distance was employed to evaluate the shifts in microbial structure among the fecal samples. Differences in species and metabolic modules between groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon test, with the significance threshold set at p 3. Results 3.1. Probio-M9 Prolonged Survival and Mitigated the Pathology in MCT Rats MCT model rats were used to examine the therapeutic effects of Probio-M9. Treatment with Probio-M9 (4 × 10 9 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 3.2. Probio-M9 Supplementation Significantly Modulated Gut Microbiota of MCT Model Rat The fecal microbiota of 15 rats was analyzed using metagenomic sequencing, and 89 SGBs were identified within the complete dataset. There were no significant intergroup differences in the diversity (Shannon–Wiener diversity index and Chao1 richness, Figure 2 Figure 2 p p p p Figure 3 p 3.3. Probio-M9 Supplementation Significantly Modulated the Metabolic Processes of Predicted Gut Bioactive Metabolites of MCT Model Rats We next assessed whether these compositional shifts were associated with functional metabolic changes. To identify the intervention-associated changes in gut metabolic modules, we established a genome-centric metabolic reconstruction that utilized a complete dataset of 89 SGBs, referencing the MetaCyc and KEGG databases. Twenty-four significantly differential metabolic modules were identified in 12 significantly different species among the intergroup comparisons, including glucose metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) metabolism, P-cresol synthesis, urea degradation, mucin degradation and 17-beta-Estradiol degradation. Notably, Monoglobus sp900542675 is involved in regulating nitric oxide degradation, Duncaniella muris Ruminococcaceae Bacteroides Alistipes Figure 4 3.4. Probio-M9 Downregulated Upregulated CD44 and GPNMB Expressing PA in MCT Rats Next, we focused on macrophage GPNMB expression in the lungs and the localization of CD44, the GPNMB receptor. We found that the number of CD44 positive cells (CTR 4 vs. MCT 12 vs. MCT + M9 7 in median value) and GPNMB-positive macrophages (CTR 7 vs. MCT 19 vs. MCT + M9 10.5 in median value) in the PA region was significantly increased in the MCT group compared to the CTR group, whereas Probio-M9 treatment significantly reduced it ( Figure 5 In the MCT rat lung, remodeling PAs were surrounded by numerous GPNMB+ or CD44+ cells. To evaluate the clinical evidence about these changes, we next analyzed the GPNMB+ or CD44+ cells localization and expression patterns clinical samples. We also examined GPNMB and CD44 expression in the lungs of patients with and without PH and found that the number of CD44 positive cells (nonPH 12 vs. PH 17 in median value) and GPNMB-positive macrophages (nonPH 5 vs. PH 15 in median value) in the PA region was significantly higher in the PH group than in the non-PH group ( Figure 6 Figure 6 4. Discussion This study is the first to investigate the effects of Probio-M9 on both gut microbiota composition and GPNMB/CD44 expression in PH. PH is a complex and fatal disease characterized by an abnormally elevated PA pressure, which may ultimately lead to right heart failure [ 23 24 25 Alistipes Intestinimonas Our results showed that no significant differences were found in the diversity of the gut microbiota of MCT rats compared to that of CTR rats. This result was consistent with the findings of Hong et al. [ 26 7 27 28 Furthermore, Probio-M9 supplementation significantly increased the relative abundance of Alistipes Alistipes Alistipes 29 30 9 12 31 32 33 34 35 In terms of metabolism, Probio-M9 supplementation significantly affected the metabolic processes of nitric oxide, p-cresol and butyric acid. The enrichment of microbial metabolic pathways related to SCFA synthesis and the regulation of P-cresol-producing bacteria in Probio-M9-treated rats may further explain the attenuated pulmonary GPNMB+ macrophages abnormal activation. Changes in the levels of nitric oxide, an important endogenous vasodilator, directly affect the PA pressure [ 36 Our results suggest that modulation of specific gut microbial taxa and their metabolites can attenuate vascular remodeling in PH through immunomodulation of lung macrophages. We observed a significant increase in the expression of GPNMB-expressing macrophages and CD44-positive cells in PH. Further studies are needed to identify the involvement of these cells in the pathogenesis of PH. Previous reports have suggested that CD44-positive cells express αSMA in PH model mice [ 8 As a clinical treatment for PH, the greatest advantage of lactic acid bacteria probiotics is that they are highly safe and have rarely potential for conflict with other treatments or side effects. The limitations of this study include the fact that (1) the single probiotic strain tested; (2) the pathology of PH in the rat MCT model differs from the clinical findings in patients; (3) the lack of longitudinal microbiome/metabolome monitoring; and that (4) the rats were kept in an Specific pathogen Free (SPF) environment, which is not optimal for analyzing the gut microbiome. Probio-M9 needs to be tested in other PH models and its potential clinical application, dosage, duration of treatment, and combination therapy should be investigated. 5. Conclusions These findings suggest a novel mechanism for the treatment of PH, in which the probiotic Probio-M9 regulates SCFA/NO/p-cresol metabolism in the gut microbiota and regulates GPNMB-positive macrophages and CD44-positive cells around the pulmonary arteries. Detailed studies of the mechanisms of gut-lung axis communication may provide a more comprehensive perspective for understanding the development and progression of PH. Probio-M9 may be investigated as a novel microbiome-targeted intervention for PH. Acknowledgments The authors thank Akira Nishiyama and Kento Kitada for providing the echocardiography equipment.
