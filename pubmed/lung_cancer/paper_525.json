Objective H101 (recombinant human adenovirus type 5) has favorable efficacy and safety in cancer patients with malignant ascites (MA) or pleural effusion (MPE). However, a comprehensive evaluation has not yet been conducted. This meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively investigate the efficacy and safety of H101 in these patients. Methods The meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD420251052407). A comprehensive study search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Wan Fang, CNKI, and SinoMed until October 2024. Studies reporting on the remission and safety results in cancer patients with MA/MPE treated with H101 were screened. The overall remission rates (ORRs) of ascites or pleural effusion and adverse reactions were analyzed. Results A total of 13 studies involving 993 patients were included. The pooled ORR was 69.9% (95%CI = 63.5%–76.4%). The pooled rates of fever, nausea or vomiting, and leukopenia were 22.5% (95%CI = 10.2%–34.9%), 14.0% (95%CI = 6.8%–21.2%), and 24.3% (95%CI = 9.6%–39.1%), respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that the ORR was higher in studies with a single cancer type than in those with multiple cancer types ( p Conclusion H101 is effective and safe for the treatment of MA/MPE in patients with cancer and may be a promising modality for their clinical management. malignant ascites or pleural effusion recombinant human adenovirus Type 5 efficacy safety meta-analysis The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Pharmacology of Anti-Cancer Drugs 1 Introduction Malignant ascites (MA) or pleural effusion (MPE) is a common complication of various advanced tumors, which is characterized by the pathological accumulation of malignant cells in ascitic or pleural fluid ( 1 3 4 6 7 8 Oncolytic viruses (OVs) are emerging antitumor agents that kill infected cells directly without destroying normal cells and have been gradually applied in the clinical management of multiple cancers ( 9 10 11 13 14 26 24 25 Therefore, this is the first meta-analysis aiming to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of H101 in cancer patients with MA/MPE. 2 Methods 2.1 Search strategy and selection criteria The study was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; approval no. CRD420251052407), which was accessed at https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD420251052407  Supplementary Figure S1 A thorough study search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Wan Fang, CNKI, and SinoMed until October 2024. The search used free text terms and keywords, including “cancer, carcinoma, neoplasms, malignant, ascites, pleural effusion, human type 5 recombinant adenovirus, oncolytic viruses, and H101.” The search strategy was adapted to the unique retrieval methods of the different databases. As an example, a full search strategy for PubMed is shown in  Appendix 1 The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) studies that reported on cancer patients with MA/MPE; 2) studies that reported on the remission and safety results of MA/MPE treated with H101; and 3) studies published in English or Chinese. The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) reviews or meta-analyses; 2) case reports; and 3) academic dissertations. In addition, gray literature or clinical trial registries were not taken into consideration as their results have not yet been reviewed by peer experts and their quality cannot be guaranteed. A total of 13 studies were included in this meta-analysis, and ethical approval status was reviewed for all studies. Four studies explicitly reported obtaining ethical approval ( 21 24 26 14 20 22 23 2.2 Data extraction and outcomes The following data were extracted: 1) publication details, including the first author’s name and year; 2) study design details, including the study type and sample size; 3) patient details, including age, male cases, disease type, and cancer type; and 4) treatment details, including therapy type and drugs. The outcomes included the ORR and adverse reactions. The ORR was defined as the complete remission (CR) rate plus the partial remission (PR) rate of ascites or pleural effusion. CR and PR were determined according to a previous study ( 27 27 2.3 Quality assessment The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used to assess non-randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which were assessed from three domains and scored for each domain. The total score was 9 points, and the higher the score, the better the quality ( 28 https://methods.cochrane.org/risk-bias-2 2.4 Data analysis R software version 4.3.3 was used for data analysis. Proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used for data synthesis. A random effects model was used when I 2 vs vs versus vs vs p 3 Results 3.1 Study screening process A total of 184 studies were identified through the database search, from which 60 duplicate studies were removed before screening. After screening the titles and abstracts, 107 studies were excluded. The remaining 17 studies were assessed for eligibility through reading the full text, with a further four ineligible studies removed. Ultimately, 13 studies were included in this meta-analysis ( 14 26  Figure 1 Figure 1 Study selection flowchart. Flowchart showing the identification process for studies via databases. Initially, 184 studies were identified: PubMed (64), Web of Science (85), Cochrane Library (2), Wan Fang (10), CNKI (13), SinoMed (10). After removing 60 duplicates, 124 studies were screened. 107 were excluded, leaving 17 for full-text eligibility. Four studies were further excluded: one case report, one without relevant results, and two academic dissertations. Thirteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. 3.2 Information on the included studies The 13 included studies involving 993 cases were published between 2009 and 2024. There were five observational studies and eight RCTs. In terms of cancer type, five studies included patients with multiple cancers, and eight studies included patients with a single cancer. In addition, seven studies included patients with monotherapy, four studies involved patients with combination therapy, and two studies included both.

The total score for these studies ranged from 7 to 9, suggesting that all of these studies were of high quality and that there was a low risk of bias (  Supplementary Table S3 The Cochrane ROB tool was used to assess the risk of bias for eight RCTs. The results showed that the risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions was unclear in the included studies. All of the studies were assessed as having “low risk” with regard to bias arising from the randomization process, bias due to missing outcome data and incomplete outcome data, and bias in the measurement of the outcome and the selection of the reported results (  Supplementary Table S4 A summary of the results of the risk of bias assessment is shown in  Supplementary Figure S3 4 Discussion MA or MPE is a common complication that occurs in various cancers, resulting in poor prognosis for patients with cancer ( 29 27 30 31 27 30 31 27 30 31 14 25 24 post-hoc n α This meta-analysis also assessed the safety of H101 in cancer patients with MA/MPE, and the results revealed that the rates of fever, nausea or vomiting, and leukopenia were 22.5%, 14.0%, and 24.3%, respectively. These adverse events were controllable, indicating a good safety profile of H101 in cancer patients with MA/MPE. Notably, a previous study also assessed the safety of H101 in patients with MA, which showed that H101 was well tolerated, reporting pyrexia, fatigue, nausea, and abdominal pain as the most frequent adverse events ( 32 32 The subgroup analysis revealed that the ORR and the rates of nausea or vomiting and leukopenia were higher in studies with a single cancer type than in those with multiple cancer types. This might be due to the fact that the weights used in the studies of Zhang ( 24 25 OVs have shown broad application prospects owing to their remarkable efficacy in the treatment of cancers ( 33 33 34 In this meta-analysis, there was no publication bias in the ORR, the rate of nausea or vomiting, or the rate of leukopenia, while there was publication bias in the rate of fever. This bias was eliminated using the trim-and-fill method. The quality assessment exhibited the high quality of the included studies, and the sensitivity analyses demonstrated the high robustness of the results. However, some limitations still exist: 1) The number of included studies in this meta-analysis is relatively small, and the sample size of each included study is limited. Although an estimated statistical power of 99.9% indicated that this meta-analysis might have sufficient power to detect the observed effect size, more available studies with large sample sizes are still required for further verification; 2) Due to the lack of patient-centered outcomes (such as quality of life, long-term survival, and functional status), this meta-analysis did not evaluate these outcomes in cancer patients with MA/MPE who received H101; 3) Some of the included studies are non-RCTs, which might cause potential bias in the results; 4) Most of the included studies are published in Chinese, and the narrow geographical focus of these included studies might affect the generalizability of the results; 5) The ORR was not standardized across the included studies, which might influence the credibility of our results to some extent; 6) Although this meta-analysis revealed the efficacy and safety of H101 in cancer patients with MA/MPE, further basic experiments or clinical studies are required to offer novel mechanistic insights or comparison with other therapies; 7) Future studies could consider comparing the cost-effectiveness of H101 against other therapies; and 8) In the quality assessment of the included RCTs, the risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions was unclear, which is due to these RCTs not reporting whether deviations from interventions existed between the experimental group and the control group. This might potentially affect the results of this meta-analysis; for instance, it might increase the uncertainty of the results. In conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that H101 may have good efficacy and favorable safety in the treatment of MA/MPE in patients with cancer, supporting its application in clinical management. However, most of the studies included in this meta-analysis are from China, and the generalizability of the results still requires further verification.
