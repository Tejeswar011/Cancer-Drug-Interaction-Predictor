Due to their close proximity to human cells, these microorganisms play a crucial role in maintaining the host’s health, influencing various metabolic processes, and providing protection against potentially harmful agents and pathogens. The disruption in this microbial ecosystem, known as dysbiosis, is associated with inflammatory and metabolic diseases, as well as certain types of cancer. Strategies to modulate the microbiota toward a state of homeostasis through the use of “biotics” (probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics) have increased. However, challenges such as low stability, loss of microbial viability, and difficulties in delivery to the intestine significantly decrease the progress of their clinical and nutritional applications. Microencapsulation and nanoencapsulation technologies offer potential solutions to enhance the stability, bioavailability, and controlled release of microorganisms and/or bioactive compounds within the gastrointestinal tract. Considering these aspects, this review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in nanoencapsulation techniques for biotics, highlighting their mechanisms of action, potential health benefits, and applications in functional foods and targeted therapies. Furthermore, it addresses existing limitations, evaluates feasibility, and discusses the future potential of these technologies in promoting gut health and disease prevention. Further research, especially through clinical studies, is mandatory to verify the safety and effectiveness of nanoencapsulated biotics and to obtain regulatory approval. gut microbiota probiotics prebiotics synbiotics postbiotics nanoencapsulation National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) #307842/2022-3 #151150/2023-0 São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) #2022/12270-1 #2024/22823-3 #2023/09620-3 #2013/07914-8 #2022/12834-2 #2023/01396-7 The authors acknowledge the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) for J.P.F.’s productivity scholarship (#307842/2022-3) and for T.K.O.R.’s scholarship (#151150/2023-0).

Introduction The human intestine harbors a complex ecosystem of microorganisms that colonize all its segments, and the connection between these microbes and human cells has profound effects on health [ 1 2 3 4 The primary definition of intestinal microbiota homeostasis is the absence of diagnosed gastrointestinal diseases or disorders, or the lack of digestive symptoms without specific diagnoses [ 5 6 7 8 9 Faecalibacterium Roseburia Lachnospiraceae Eubacterium 10 11 12 13 14 Correcting dysbiosis may help prevent or treat diseases and alleviate symptoms [ 2 15 16 Despite the broad therapeutic potential of biotics, their practical application faces significant challenges. In the case of probiotics, for instance, the viability of microorganisms can be severely compromised during processing, storage, and particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, due to exposure to the acidic pH of the stomach, digestive enzymes, bile salts, and oxygen [ 17 18 19 Encapsulation processes offer the potential to explore the biological use of new bioactives and active molecules for human benefit, since the technology provides physical protection, controlled release, and increased stability and bioavailability of the encapsulates. In the case of pro- and prebiotics, encapsulation methodologies typically rely on microparticles, as exemplified by the work of Yin et al. [ 20 Escherichia coli However, the imperfections on the microparticles, especially thick and uneven surfaces, can lead to changes in the sensorial quality of foods and supplements, resulting in low acceptability. Larger particles can also alter the release mechanisms in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to imprecise delivery [ 21 The primary aim of this article is to provide an understanding of the technologies associated with “biotics” delivery systems based on the physiological characteristics of the gastrointestinal tract. The discussion encompasses key advancements, as well as the feasibility, limitations, and prospects within this field, with a focus on promoting intestinal health and disease prevention. 2. Biotics: Main Characteristics and Bioactivity The adjective “biotic”, as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary, refers to something that is related to or resulting from living organisms. In the field of Biology, this term is used to describe a wide range of contexts involving living organisms, their interactions with other living beings, and with the environment. In the context of this text, “biotics” encompasses living and non-living microorganisms, substrates, and their combinations, which can interact with the microbial community of the gastrointestinal tract—particularly in its lower portion—thereby providing benefits to the host. Examples of such elements include probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics ( Figure 1 Each type of biotic has already had its definition reviewed by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP). Probiotics are defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. This definition emphasizes the importance of the viability of microorganisms and requires that, for microbial species to be recognized as probiotics, their health benefits must be properly demonstrated [ 22 23 Only a limited number of microorganisms can be classified as probiotics. Among these, the genera Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium 24 25 26 Roseburia intestinalis Eubacterium Akkermansia muciniphila Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Bacteroides 27 28 22 29 30 31 32 Postbiotics comprise a range of biologically active components, including short-chain fatty acids, exopolysaccharides, enzymes, peptides, teichoic acids, and cell wall fragments, which exhibit antimicrobial, anticancer, and immunomodulatory activities [ 33 23 Bifidobacterium longum 34 The definitions of probiotics and postbiotics do not mention the involvement of the microbiota as a mechanistic basis for their benefits [ 16 Prebiotics and synbiotics are fundamentally based on the mediation of their beneficial effects through the metabolism of microorganisms within the intestinal microbiota. The ISAPP defines prebiotics as a substrate that is selectively utilized by host microorganisms, conferring a health benefit [ 35 36 The definition of prebiotics proposed by ISAPP expands this classification beyond carbohydrates that cannot be digested and absorbed by the human body (fermentable dietary fibers and oligosaccharides), also including substances such as (poly)phenols [ 37 38 39 The gut microbiota degrades and metabolizes prebiotics, stimulating the growth and activity of specific bacterial communities producing diverse beneficial metabolites, potentially inducing positive host metabolic changes [ 40 35 41 42 43 The combination of live microorganisms and substrates utilized by the microbiota represents an approach to enhance the beneficial effects on the intestinal ecosystem. This is the concept of synbiotics. In addition to combining the individual impact of probiotics and prebiotics, their joint action may generate superior or distinct benefits, as prebiotics provide a favorable environment for the survival and activity of probiotic microorganisms [ 44 Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium 45 Pediococcus acidilactici 46 Oral consumption is the usual form of biotic intake. Nevertheless, this method also presents significant challenges, depending on the expected effects of the biotic. Microbial cells must survive through the gastrointestinal tract while maintaining their viability to exhibit their bioactive properties. The gastrointestinal environment presents various challenges, including the presence of lysozyme in the oral mucosa, the acidic environment of gastric juice, and the enzymatic complexes in the intestine. On the other hand, although oligosaccharides commonly exhibit significant resistance to human enzymes in the upper gastrointestinal tract and stability against pH changes, their fermentation occurs rather rapidly in the initial portions of the colon, which limits their activity in more distal regions of the colon [ 21 3. Nanoencapsulation The classical definition of nanomaterials is based on their dimensions, although the use is frequently context-dependent. Most regulations describe nanomaterials as objects with dimensions between 1 and 100 nm. This convention has broad acceptance in chemical sciences. However, due to the commonly polydisperse nature of nanomaterials, the European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials has considered nanomaterials in which at least 50% of the particles fall within the 1–100 nm range [ 47 48 Nanometric-scale dimensions impart physical and chemical properties that are significantly distinct from those observed in their micrometric or bulk counterparts. These differences are evident in characteristics such as color, strength, conductivity, and reactivity. The reduced size and unique structure of nanomaterials are indicated for specific applications where micromaterials are ineffective [ 49 50 Returning to the protection of sensitive compounds, nanoencapsulation establishes a physicochemical barrier between the core—viable cells and/or bioactive compounds—and the external milieu [ 48 51 52 53 Over the past decade, research on the benefits of orally delivered nanocapsules has become increasingly prevalent. Numerous encapsulation techniques and polymeric materials have already been explored, with a particular emphasis on protection against the adverse conditions of different sections of the gastrointestinal tract or on targeted release at specific sites [ 48 Nanoencapsulation systems can be fabricated using a range of technologies grounded in top–down or bottom–up strategies, including emulsification, polymeric coating, complex coacervation, nanoprecipitation, and complexation [ 54 55 56 To understand the main topics in research on the nanoencapsulation of biotics, a bibliometric study was conducted using bibliometric data obtained from the Science Citation Index Expanded—Web of Science (WoS) core collection by Clarivate Analytics. An advanced search was performed using keywords, targeting terms present only in the title (“TI”), abstract (“AB”), or author keywords (“AK”) of the documents. For terms related to nanoencapsulation, the following descriptors were used: “nanoencapsulat*”, “nano-encapsulat*”, “nanocarrier*”, “nanoparticle*”, “nanocapsule*”, and “nanostructur*”. The “biotics” categories were based on the definitions established by the International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics (ISAPP) to date (“probiotic*”, “prebiotic*”, “synbiotic*”, and “postbiotic*”). The asterisk (*) truncation character was applied to all terms to capture different spelling variants. The results were filtered by document type (“Article” and “Review”) and language (English). The search yielded a total of 841 articles, and the data were exported and analyzed using VOSviewer (version 1.6.20). Figure 2 Lactobacillus Lactobacillus acidophilus Lactobacillus rhamnosus 4. Nanoencapsulation of Biotics 4.1. Single-Cell Nanocoating of Probiotics Although the use of more resistant probiotic strains has become increasingly common in recent years, these microorganisms are still subjected to numerous unfavorable factors—such as variations in pH, heat, light, and adverse conditions in the gastrointestinal tract (temperature, pH, and oxygen concentration)—from formulation until delivery to the target site within the gastrointestinal tract. This exposure may consequently reduce their viability to levels below the optimal range (10 8 9 57 A key point of discussion in nanoencapsulation processes is the dimensions of the systems employed. Probiotic cells typically range in size from 1 to 10 µm, clearly exceeding the dimensions conventionally defined for nanostructured systems. Consequently, the most common encapsulation approaches for probiotics have primarily utilized microencapsulation techniques, in which microbial cells are embedded within a matrix, commonly through extrusion, emulsification, and spray-drying techniques [ 18 58 To address these challenges, novel encapsulation technologies are currently under development. For instance, the creation of an additional membrane surrounding probiotic cells through biomaterials, known as single-cell technology, exemplifies this advancement ( Figure 3 59 60 Lactobacillus acidophilus Enhancing the preservation of probiotic cells can be accomplished by augmenting the thickness of the surrounding matrix nanocoating. Hou et al. [ 61 Escherichia coli Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 62 Lactobacillus plantarum 63 L. plantarum Figure 3 Single-cell nanocoating technologies for protecting probiotic cells. ( a Lactobacillus acidophilus 60 b c Levilactobacillus brevis 3+ 64 d Escherichia coli p p 61 e Lactiplantibacillus plantarum e f p 63 f Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 62 g L. acidophilus 65 h Lactobacillus paracasei 66 Various challenges faced by probiotics in the gastrointestinal environment, including enzymatic attacks and antibiotic exposure, can be mitigated by the single-cell nanocoating technique. A protocol based on a biphasic water–oil system was used for the individual cell coating of Lactobacillus acidophilus 67 3+ 3+ 68 3+ Levilactobacillus brevis 64 The single-cell nanocoating technique can be used to functionalize probiotic cells for addressing more challenging problems. For example, spores of Bacillus coagulans 2 69 Lactobacillus Roseburia 69 Single-cell coating technology can be utilized for the concurrent delivery of probiotics alongside therapeutic drugs. For example, Peng et al. [ 70 Escherichia coli 2+ 70 Another strategy for nanocoating probiotic cells involves incorporating them into nanoscale fibers made through the electrospinning process. Electrospinning is a technique that utilizes a strong electric field generated by applying a high voltage between the collector and the electrospinning solution. This electric force surpasses surface tension, resulting in the formation of a polymer jet propelled toward the collector [ 71 Figure 3 72 Common synthetic polymers used as wall materials in electrospinning include polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene oxide (PEO), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). These materials often combine with other polymers, such as sodium alginate, corn starch, or biopolymers from waste materials like soluble dietary fiber from okara, to improve cell protection [ 65 Lactobacillus paracasei 66 6 9 65 Modifications to electrospinning protocols have been proposed to enhance both the efficiency of the encapsulation process and the stability of encapsulated probiotics. Techniques such as multilayer electrospinning and coaxial configurations have demonstrated promising outcomes. For example, a double-layered vehicle developed for Lactobacillus plantarum 73 Nanocoating techniques can enhance the effectiveness and survival of probiotics administered orally. The technologies referenced are capable of safeguarding probiotics against adverse conditions within the gastrointestinal tract, as well as during processing and storage. Nevertheless, substantial challenges persist, including scaling up for industrial application and addressing potential regulatory hurdles. Furthermore, it is essential to deepen the understanding of consumer perceptions of food and the interactions of encapsulated systems with various food types and materials; this requires further investigation. Consequently, future research should emphasize more rigorous methodologies, such as clinical trials, to substantiate the efficacy of these technologies. 4.2. Nanoencapsulation of Prebiotics The incorporation of prebiotics into the diet and oral supplementation has been proven to have beneficial effects on the intestine and a positive impact on human health [ 74 75 Prebiotics, nondigestible non-starch polysaccharides and oligosaccharides, such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS), Xylooligosaccharides (XOS), Chitooligosaccharides (COS), Pectic oligosaccharides (POS), lactulose, resistant starch, inulin, pectin, and others, are dietary components that stimulate the proliferation of beneficial intestinal bacteria [ 75 76 77 However, even with their potential effects, the effectiveness of prebiotics can be significantly influenced by environmental conditions during processing, storage, and movement through the gut. This can limit their benefits and therapeutic use [ 78 79 Figure 4 80 Nanostructured prebiotics, known as nano-prebiotics, can be protected during digestion, ensuring their safe release at the site of action, such as the most distal portions of the intestine, which stimulates bacterial diversity and the production of metabolites with potentially beneficial effects. The gut microbiota influences various health issues, including allergies, ulcerative colitis, and certain types of cancer. Modulating it by decreasing pathogens and increasing beneficial organisms is proven effective in treatment [ 76 57 Modulation of the gut microbiota has become a key therapeutic target for the intervention of colonic diseases. In this context, Ren et al. [ 81 81 57 57 Nano-prebiotics may offer a new, low-cost, accessible, and practical approach to confer health benefits to individuals, particularly as an adjunctive therapy to support patients in achieving better clinical outcomes. The controlled release and specific functional characteristics of nanomaterials are influenced by their physical, chemical, biological, and mechanical properties. Biomaterials that can be used include those of natural origin (e.g., starch, cellulose, pectin, chitosan, some proteins, and lipids) or synthetically prepared (e.g., metal-based polymers). However, nanomaterials must be biocompatible, biodegradable, and recognized as safe for use and incorporation into food [ 57 82 An effective nanoencapsulation-based prebiotic delivery system is an oral therapy with anticancer properties. For instance, the encapsulation of particular disaccharides may have an effective anticancer action. A study demonstrated a novel nanoencapsulation system based on the formation of nanocomplexes between pectin and lysozyme, developed as an oral vehicle for delivering β-lactose, a natural inhibitor of galectin-3, a protein associated with colorectal cancer [ 83 83 A recent study investigated the effect of incorporating four prebiotic saccharides: gum arabic (GA), fructooligosaccharide (FOS), konjac glucomannan (KGM), and inulin (INU) into urolithin A-loaded liposomes (UroA-LPs) [ 84 Bacteroidota Proteobacteria Actinobacteria Parabacteroides Monoglobus Phascolarctobacterium A study developed by Feng et al. [ 85 Ramulus mori A study investigated the production and potential application of nanoencapsulated chito-oligosaccharides in foods [ 86 Bacillus cereus On the other hand, in addition to the properties of inulin and pectin as prebiotics, it is essential to emphasize that their multifunctional and flexible structure provides stabilization for other bioactive compounds and targeted delivery capabilities, indicating the potential of these polysaccharides as vehicles for administration as well. The molecular structure can be easily modified to increase bioavailability, improve cellular uptake, and achieve targeted, sustained, and controlled release in the intestine [ 87 88 A wide variety of prebiotics remain unexplored regarding their behavior in nanostructured systems, as well as numerous possibilities for combinations with different biomaterials that can ensure safe, effective, and targeted delivery to the intestine. Also, it is necessary to conduct a study to scale up the production of nano-prebiotics, enabling their application in both the food and pharmaceutical industries [ 57 4.3. Nanoencapsulation of Synbiotics The application of nanoencapsulation in synbiotics—synergistic combinations of probiotics and prebiotics—primarily aims to maximize their functional efficacy and stability in relevant matrices, such as foods, supplements, or pharmaceuticals ( Figure 5 Single-cell nanocoating is a highly versatile approach for integrating probiotics and prebiotics into nanoencapsulation systems. Lim et al. [ 89 Lactobacillus plantarum The functionalization of probiotic cells through single-cell nanocoating is a promising approach for managing inflammatory bowel diseases. In the study by Hu et al. [ 90 Escherichia coli Akkermansia Lachnospiraceae Escherichia Shigella The incorporation of prebiotic oligosaccharides into nanoencapsulated synbiotic systems constitutes a promising strategy to promote the colonization and proliferation of probiotic microorganisms during their release along the gastrointestinal tract. An example of this approach is the inclusion of inulin in PLGA nanoparticles integrated with Bifidobacterium 91 92 Lactobacillus rhamnosus The antimicrobial properties of nanoencapsulated synbiotics demonstrate promising potential for application within the livestock production chain, particularly as an alternative to conventional antibiotics. This approach may help reduce the selective pressure exerted by the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials, thereby aiding in the mitigation of the emergence and spread of resistant bacterial strains. An example of this strategy was demonstrated by combining phytogenic compounds extracted from pomegranate peel with multi-species probiotics ( Lactococcus lactis Lactobacillus plantarum Lactobacillus paracasei, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2 93 Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus Pseudomonas aeruginosa Aspergillus niger Aspergillus flavus The use of such synbiotic nanoparticles may represent a promising approach for mitigating damage caused by food-borne toxins. Swetha Kumar and Sahabudeen Mohideen [ 94 Lactobacillus fermentum Drosophila melanogaster Recent advances in individual cell coatings and the strategic integration of prebiotic compounds have demonstrated not only improved survival of probiotic cells but also enhanced therapeutic benefits, such as effective modulation of the intestinal microbiota, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as protection against foodborne toxins and pathogens. Similarly to probiotics and prebiotics, there is still a lack of research regarding the scalability and optimization of processes to ensure the economic viability and commercial acceptance of nanoencapsulated synbiotics. 4.4. Nanoencapsulation of Postbiotics The nanoencapsulation of postbiotics enables enhanced stability, bioavailability, and efficacy of bioactive compounds derived from probiotic microorganisms. Unlike synbiotics or live probiotics, postbiotics—non-viable bioactive substances produced by microorganisms—offer several important advantages, including greater thermal stability, microbiological safety, and the absence of risks associated with bacterial translocation. The application of nanocarriers further potentiates these characteristics by protecting the compounds from degradation and promoting their targeted release and improved absorption ( Figure 6 95 Postbiotic-loaded nanoparticles tend to produce more reproducible effects, as they do not depend on the viability of probiotic cells. The beneficial effects observed combine mechanisms of microbial, antioxidant, and immunomodulatory activity [ 96 95 The use of nanocapsules allows for the protection of postbiotic bioactive compounds against adverse environmental conditions, including variations in pH, temperature, enzymatic activity, and chemical degradation. Such protection significantly enhances therapeutic potential by enabling controlled and site-specific release in target biological locations. The development of arginine-chitosan and fucoidan-based nanoparticles for encapsulating the postbiotic derived from Lacticaseibacillus paracasei 97 Stabilization of intestinal barrier integrity is a primary objective in the use of postbiotics. Yu et al. [ 98 The use of nanoencapsulation technology further enhances the versatility of postbiotic applications. For example, Gökçe and Aslan (2024) [ 99 Enterococcus Enterococcus faecalis 100 The biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using postbiotics is a promising approach for producing antimicrobial agents. Postbiotics are employed as reducing agents, and this method offers advantages over conventional techniques due to their environmentally friendly nature, biocompatibility, and stability. Films made from carboxymethyl chitosan were integrated with silver nanoparticles anchored on covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which provided adequate protection against microbial contamination ( Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli Bacillus cereus Cronobacter sakazakii Listeria monocytogenes 101 Ligilactobacillus salivarius Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa Streptococcus mutans 102 The application of nanocarrier systems enhances the properties of postbiotics by providing adequate protection against chemical and enzymatic degradation, as well as adverse gastrointestinal conditions, while also enabling controlled and site-specific release. Despite these advantages, substantial challenges still need to be addressed. Among these, the need for rigorous standardization of processes and long-term toxicological safety of postbiotics is highlighted. These factors are crucial for ensuring the regulatory and commercial approval of such products. 5. Conclusions and Outlook Nanoencapsulation strategies possess the potential to fundamentally transform the delivery and efficacy of biotics within the gastrointestinal tract. By facilitating the incorporation of novel ingredients and broadening the spectrum of possible applications, these methodologies are attracting attention from healthcare professionals, academic researchers, and the food and pharmaceutical industries. This growing interest is driven not only by the substantial health benefits associated with these systems but also by their innovative character. Advances in this domain thus delineate a promising frontier for the development of functional solutions that aim to enhance human health and nutrition. Nevertheless, several critical challenges persist, including the need for standardized manufacturing processes, addressing regulatory and industrial scalability issues, and ensuring the stability and safety of nanoencapsulated systems. Furthermore, production costs and the comprehensive assessment of long-term toxicological risks continue to hinder the widespread adoption of these technologies in practical applications. The scarcity of robust, well-designed, and standardized clinical trials further restricts the establishment of reliable and evidence-based recommendations for the clinical use of these emerging systems. Future research efforts should prioritize interpreting the complex interactions between nanostructured delivery systems and the host’s gut microbiota profile, as well as optimizing nanoencapsulation methodologies for enhanced efficiency and scalability. Additionally, investigating novel combinations of biotics and biomaterials and systematically evaluating their effects in diverse pathological contexts is an essential step toward consolidating the therapeutic and preventive potential of these technologies in maintaining intestinal, and consequently, overall health.

Figure 2 VOSviewer map from the search combination of the terms “Biotics” and “Nanoencapsulation”. Figure 4 Schematic representation of the benefits of prebiotic nanoencapsulation using polymeric nanoparticles and liposomes/emulsions, including targeted delivery in the gastrointestinal tract, modulation of the microbiota, anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects, as well as improved techno-functional properties such as antioxidant activity, emulsion stability, and freeze–thaw resistance. Figure 5 Schematic representation of synbiotic nanoencapsulation, highlighting the coating of probiotic cells with prebiotics (phenolic compounds and prebiotic carbohydrates). This approach promotes increased probiotic survival, synergistic modulation of microbiota, and enhanced antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Figure 6 Schematic representation of postbiotic components (inanimate microbial cells, fragments, or metabolites) and the benefits of nanoencapsulation, including increased cellular absorption, targeted colonic release, and expanded applications such as topical use and as a reducing agent in the fabrication of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles.
