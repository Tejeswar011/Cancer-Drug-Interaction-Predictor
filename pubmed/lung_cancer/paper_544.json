The drug-tolerant cells may originate from a small population of inherently resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) in primary tumors. In contrast, sufficient evidence suggests that drug tolerance can also be transiently acquired by nonstem cancer cells. Regardless of the route, key regulators of this plastic process are poorly understood. Here, we utilized multiomics, tumor microarrays, and epigenetic modulation to demonstrate that SOX9 is a key chemo-induced driver of chemoresistance in HGSOC. Epigenetic upregulation of SOX9 was sufficient to induce chemoresistance in multiple HGSOC lines. Moreover, this upregulation induced the formation of a stem-like subpopulation and significant chemoresistance in vivo. Mechanistically, SOX9 increased transcriptional divergence, reprogramming the transcriptional state of naive cells into a stem-like state. Supporting this, we identified a rare cluster of SOX9-expressing cells in primary tumors that were highly enriched for CSCs and chemoresistance-associated stress gene modules. Notably, single-cell analysis showed that chemo treatment results in rapid population-level induction of SOX9 that enriches for a stem-like transcriptional state. Altogether, these findings implicate SOX9 as a critical regulator of early steps of transcriptional reprogramming that lead to chemoresistance through a CSC-like state in HGSOC. The transcription factor SOX9 is sufficient to induce a stem-like transcriptional state and significant resistance to platinum treatment in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.

The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 20,890 women will receive an OC diagnosis, and 12,730 will succumb to the disease in 2025 ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Understanding the molecular steps utilized by OC cells in the early stages of chemoresistance might shed critical light on the process of its acquisition and maintenance. A well-established concept of chemoresistance is the cancer stem cell (CSC) model, which postulates that chemoresistance arises in a rare population of inherently resistant stem-like cancer cells ( 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 17 To study nongenetic drivers of chemoresistance, we identified super-enhancers and their target genes that are commissioned specifically in resistant cells ( 18 19 20 21 24 18 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 In this study, we provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that SOX9 drives chemoresistance in HGSOC by reprogramming the transcriptional program of naive OC cells into stem-like cancer cells. We performed bulk- and single-cell sequencing, immune staining of primary tissues, and epigenetic modulation of endogenous loci and show that SOX9 is not only necessary for chemoresistance in OC, but that its expression is sufficient for its acquisition. Mechanistically, our genetic and epigenetic perturbations and single-cell multiomic profiling of naive tumors show that SOX9 expression reprograms the global transcriptional program into a stem-like transcriptional state and cellular phenotype, indicating that SOX9 is a regulator of OC stem cells and is a driver of chemoresistance in HGSOC. Results SOX9 is amplified in OC, and its expression is further induced by platinum treatment. Recent histological staining and whole-exome sequencing data have highlighted the epithelium of the fallopian tube as the likely cell of origin for HGSOC ( 35 36 37 38 Figure 1A n n P Figure 1B 39 Figure 1, C and D SOX9 ablation leads to increased platinum sensitivity. To understand SOX9’s role in the HGSOC response to platinum therapy, we knocked out the gene using a SOX9-targeting sgRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 ( Figure 1E t P Figure 1, F and G Supplemental Figure 1 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI186467DS1 SOX9 expression is induced after chemotherapy in patient samples. We next studied whether the chemotherapy-induced SOX9 upregulation is recapitulated in primary tumor samples. To this end, we utilized a publicly available longitudinal single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) dataset of 11 patient HGSOC tumors that were profiled before and after 3 cycles of platinum/taxane neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) ( Figure 2A 40 Figure 2B 40 Figure 2, C and D Figure 2E Figure 2F P P SOX9 expression is associated with transcriptional divergence, an indicator of stemness and plasticity. A hallmark of chemoresistance, particularly nongenetic resistance, is transcriptional plasticity ( 41 43 44 44 44 P Figure 2G n Figure 2H Chemo-treated HGSOC tumors have higher nuclear SOX9 levels. We next aimed to verify the findings from the scRNA-Seq data at the protein level using a diverse panel of patient tumors. To this end, we utilized 2 HGSOC tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 348 paired HGSOC tissues from 42 patients before and after chemotherapy treatment ( Figure 3A 45 Figure 3B 46 Supplemental Figure 2 Figure 3, C and D Supplemental Figure 2C Multiomics analysis of an epithelial-enriched tumor enables the discovery of SOX9-enriched stem-like cells. Our IHC data showed the presence of high SOX9-expressing epithelial cells in untreated tumors. However, we could not determine if these cells also resemble stem-like cancer cells based on these data alone. We reasoned that if SOX9 is important for transcriptional plasticity maintenance/induction, it should be identifiable in the CSCs present in chemo-naive tumors. Therefore, we sought to characterize CSCs in a naive HGSOC tumor using multimodal scRNA-Seq and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-Seq). To this end, we performed 10X Genomics Multiome sequencing on a whole-tissue HGSOC tumor ( Figure 4, A–C Figure 4, A and B Supplemental Figure 3 SOX9 Figure 4, B and C 47 48 Figure 4D n SOX9 Figure 4, E–G Figure 4, B and C SOX9-expressing epithelial cells are enriched for CSC properties. We used multimodal scRNA- and scATAC-Seq to cluster the cells based on both modalities using WNN clustering ( Figure 4, A, B, D, and E 49 Figure 4, F, H, and I Supplemental Figure 3 SOX9 Figure 4F n Figure 2 40 Figure 4H Figure 4I 50 51 n Figure 4J 52 Figure 4K 53 Figure 4L 54 SOX9 expression is sufficient to drive chemoresistance in HGSOC cells. Our data so far support the hypothesis that SOX9 is associated with and potentially drives HGSOC chemoresistance. To experimentally test the sufficiency of SOX9 for chemoresistance, we transduced platinum-naive OVCAR4, Kuramochi, OVCAR3, and FT190 immortalized FTE cells with a doxycycline-inducible (DOX-inducible) SOX9 construct under the control of tetracycline-responsive elements ( 55 Figure 5, A and B Figure 5, C–E Supplemental Figure 4 Figure 5E Supplemental Figure 5 CRISPR-mediated epigenetic activation of endogenous SOX9 drives chemoresistance in HGSOC cells. Encouraged by the SOX9 induction results, we investigated whether physiological levels of SOX9 could also result in chemoresistance. We observed that chemoresistant OC cells have approximately 3-fold higher SOX9 protein levels compared with naive cells ( Figure 1C 56 57 SOX9 SOX9 Figure 5, F and G Figure 1, C and D Figure 5H Epigenetic activation of endogenous SOX9 results in stem-like cellular phenotypes and transcriptional states. To directly test the stem-inducing capability of SOX9, we utilized a hanging droplet spheroid formation assay as a proxy for stemness. In both the DOX-inducible and epigenetic-mediated SOX9 induction OVCAR4 cells, we found that the spheroids that formed were significantly larger in the SOX9-induced cells ( Figure 5, I and J 58 Figure 5, K and L Supplemental Figure 6 Supplemental Figure 7 To reveal transcriptional mechanisms by which SOX9 drives chemoresistance, we performed RNA-Seq on both OVCAR4 naive/platinum-resistant cell pairs and dCas9-VPR–expressing naive cells expressing control and SOX9 Figure 5M P SOX9 P Figure 5N 59 60 Acute cisplatin treatment uniformly induces SOX9 expression and stemness pathways at the single-cell level. The single-cell data from the longitudinal study and the immune staining in TMAs indicated that SOX9 expression is uniformly upregulated after chemotherapy. However, these experiments could not determine whether the post-NACT cells are originally derived from a rare population of SOX9-expressing cells. To better understand this and the early steps of chemoresistance, we performed scRNA-Seq on naive OVCAR4 cells that were control or cisplatin treated for 24 hours ( Figure 6, A–D Figure 6A SOX9 Figure 6, B and C Figure 6D Epigenetic upregulation of endogenous SOX9 induces platinum resistance in vivo. Based on these in vitro experimental results, we next tested whether the chemoresistance phenotype would be recapitulated in tumors in vivo. To this end, we subcutaneously (both flanks) injected OVCAR4-VPR cells expressing nontargeting (NT) sgRNA (right flank) or SOX9 promoter–targeting sgRNA (SOX9-sg1, left flank). After tumors were established for 3 weeks, the mice were treated weekly with either PBS (vehicle) or 10 mg/kg carboplatin ( Figure 6E Figures 6, E and F Supplemental Figures 8 and 9 Figure 6H Discussion The largest hurdle in the treatment of HGSOC is the high frequency of recurrence following the administration of neo-adjuvant platinum treatments. HGSOC cells develop chemoresistance through diverse molecular mechanisms that are driven by transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming ( 3 61 9 Through the analyses of large-scale TMAs and scRNA-Seq datasets in primary patient samples, we established that SOX9 expression and activity are significantly increased in most HGSOC tumors following NACT. The relative uniformity of SOX9’s expression in these cells supports the hypothesis that the majority of the cells in this tissue are potentially capable of reprogramming their transcriptional state to gain a stem-like phenotypic response to treatment. The analysis of a single-cell expression dataset of naive and 24-hour acute cisplatin-treated cells further supported this hypothesis. Importantly, OVCAR4 cells are estimated to double in around 43 hours ( 62 Supplemental Figure 5 Supplemental Figure 1 Notably, SOX9 was one of the top TFs significantly correlated with transcriptional divergence in primary HGSOC cells. Transcriptional divergence is a proxy for transcriptional malleability, a key hallmark of CSCs. Consistent with this, the only TF that ranked above SOX9 for this measurement, NR4A1, is involved with both chromatin structure and global transcriptional changes ( 63 Further support for this hypothesis came from the identification of a rare, small, stem-like cancer cell population in our multimodal single-cell dataset of chemo-naive tumors. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a rare population has been directly identified through single-cell profiling of primary HGSOC naive tumors. We found that SOX9 is a key marker of this rare cell population both at the expression level and from the motif analysis of differentially accessible chromatin sites (ATAC-Seq peaks) specific to this population. These findings indicated the presence of a rare cluster of cells in naive tumors that demonstrate a stem-like transcriptional state defined by high SOX9 expression and its motif accessibility. The necessity of SOX9 for transcriptional plasticity has previously been seen in breast ( 64 65 66 67 68 69 Most compellingly, we found that induction of SOX9 either exogenously or endogenously increases the capacity of OVCAR4 and OVCAR3 cells to form spheroids and induce the formation of a distinct ALDH + Figure 3C + Supplemental Figure 7 70 Overall, our findings indicate that SOX9 is not just a key marker of stemness and platinum resistance in HGSOC, but is also sufficient to induce these phenotypes. We found evidence that, upon acute exposure to platinum, nearly all cancer cells upregulate SOX9, thereby inducing overall stem state–relevant genes. This indicates that acute treatment increases overall transcriptional divergence and malleability at the population level. Through this increased malleability, these cells can then enhance stress-related pathways vital to chemoresistance, such as G1/S checkpoint, growth suppression, and unfolded protein response, while simultaneously inhibiting differentiation. Importantly, from a clinical standpoint, these findings suggest that targeting CSCs in treatment-naive tissues might not be sufficient to prevent recurrence in these cancers as the remaining cells could still have the capacity to reprogram their transcriptional state. Therefore, identifying and targeting key drivers of this reprogramming, such as SOX9, might be a more relevant therapeutic route for understanding and preventing chemoresistance. Methods Sex as a biological variable. Because this study was focused only on effects in OC, sex was not a variable in any of the experiments. As such, all cell lines and animals used were female. Cell culture. Human OC cell lines OVCAR4 and Kuramochi were cultured in complete medium consisting of RPMI 1640 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog 11875093), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Hyclone; catalog SH30071.02HI), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog 15070063). Human OC cell line COV362 was cultured in complete medium consisting of DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog 11965092), 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, and 1× Glutamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog 35050061). Human OC cell line OVCAR3 was cultured in complete medium consisting of RPMI 1640, 20% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, and 12.8 μg/mL human recombinant insulin (1.6 mL of 4 mg/mL stock; Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog 12585-014). Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T was cultured in complete medium consisting of DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1% Pen/Strep. The Kuramochi and COV362 cell lines were provided in-house, the OVCAR4 and OVCAR3 cell lines were obtained from Charles Landen (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia), and the HEK293T cell line was obtained from ATCC. The cells were grown in an incubator at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 Creating the platinum-resistant ovarian cell line. OVCAR4 platinum-resistant cells were created as previously described ( 18 Creating SOX9-overexpressing and SOX9-KO cell lines. Plasmids FUW-tetO-SOX9 (Addgene 41080), pUltra-puro-RTTA3 (Addgene 58750), lenti-EF1a-dCas9-VPR-Puro (Addgene 99373), CROP-seq-Guide-mCherry (modified from Addgene 86708 to have mCherry instead of PuroR), and lentiCRISPR v2 (modified from Addgene 52961 to have a BsmBI Goldengate Cloning sgRNA insertion site) were obtained from Addgene. To create lentivirus, HEK293T cells were seeded into a 10 cm 2 6 For infection, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 5 Colony formation assay. OVCAR4 cells with either a luciferase-targeting (NT) or SOX9-targeting (SOX9-KO) sgRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 were seeded into a 12-well plate at a density of 500 cells/well. The following day, half of the wells were treated with 20 μM carboplatin. After 24 hours, the carboplatin was removed and replaced with complete medium. One week later, the colonies were visualized using 0.5% crystal violet (Fisher Scientific; catalog C581-100) in 20% methanol. Briefly, the medium was carefully removed and replaced with 0.5 mL of crystal violet solution. The plate was wrapped in aluminum foil and allowed to incubate on a shaker at room temperature for 1 hour. Next, the dye was removed, and the plate was washed 3 times with PBS before being allowed to dry in the dark overnight. After scanning the plate wells, we used the ColonyArea ImageJ (NIH) plug-in to determine the percentage of colony coverage per well ( 71 Incucyte live-cell analysis and apoptosis assay. Cells were seeded in their respective medium into 96-well plates in triplicate at a density of 1,000 cells per well. The following day, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium or complete medium containing either 64–100 ng/mL DOX (Sigma-Aldrich; catalog D9891-1G; 64 ng/mL for OVCAR4 and 100 ng/mL for all other cell lines) or the same volume of DMSO (Fisher Scientific; catalog D128-1). After 24 hours, the medium was again removed and replaced with fresh medium with the same treatments along with 1:1,000 Incucyte caspase-3/7 dye (Sartorius; catalog 4440) and carboplatin (50 μM for OVCAR4, 10 μM for OVCAR3, 5 μM for Kuramochi, and 10 μM for FT190). The plate was then incubated in an Incucyte live-cell imager that was programmed to capture 4 images per well in phase and green every 2 hours for approximately 4 days. Green mean integrated intensity (green calibrated unit [GCU]/mm 2 MTT cell viability assay. Cells were seeded in their respective medium into a 96-well plate in triplicate at a density of 5,000 cells per well. The following day, the medium was replaced with complete medium containing a 1:1 serial dilution of cisplatin (from 100 to 0.39 μM) with the last wells receiving no treatment as negative control. The cells were incubated with the treatment for 24 hours, at which point the medium was removed and the cells were washed with 100 μL of PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific; catalog 14190094) before being replaced with complete medium. After 48 hours, the medium was removed and replaced with 90% fresh medium along with 10% of a stock solution of MTT (Invitrogen; catalog M6494) at 5 mg/mL in PBS. The cells were then returned to the incubator for an additional 4 hours before an equal volume of MTT solubilization buffer (10% SDS and 0.1% Tris HCl, pH 8) was added. The plate was allowed to incubate an additional 10 minutes, covered in foil and with rocking, before being read on a plate reader at 590 nm. Background absorbance was measured as the readings for control wells that contained no cells.

The fresh tissues were washed with cold PBS and mechanically disrupted to generate small pieces. Then, they were subjected to enzymatic digestion with a tissue dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec; catalog 130-095-929) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Enzymatic digestion was carried out for 2 hours at 37°C with shaking at 0.5 g For the tumor cell enrichment, we used a tumor cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec; catalog 130-108-339) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the samples were incubated with a cocktail that magnetically labeled non–tumor cells and passed through LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec; catalog 130-042-401) attached to a MACS multistand (Miltenyi Biotec; catalog 130-042-303). Tumor cells were eluted and collected, and the cell number and viability were analyzed. Enriched tumor cells or cells isolated from the tissues were then subjected to DNase treatment and nuclei isolation following the Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing protocol by 10X Genomics ( CG000365 The isolated nuclei were immediately used for transposition, followed by gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM) generation and barcoding, cleanup, and library preamplification PCR following the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression user guide (10X Genomics; rev.
