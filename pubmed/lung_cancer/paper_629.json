Methods The cells likely mediating N2 lymph node metastasis in T1 NSCLC were identified by single-cell sequencing. The expression and function of the main functional gene high fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) in this cell subgroup were analyzed by single-cell analysis. Transcriptome sequencing, metabolome sequencing, and mass spectrometry combined with in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted, and therapeutic validation was performed using shFGL1_AAV9 and shFGL1_AAV6. Results A novel cell subgroup characterized by FGL1 expression was identified (CCNE1(+) cells). FGL1 expression coincided with the appearance of this cell subgroup, suggesting that FGL1 + cells mediate T1 NSCLC N2 lymph node metastasis. Mass spectrometry combined with transcription sequencing and metabonomics revealed that FGL1 may affect glycolysis regulators and participate in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in NSCLC via the PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α pathway. Further analyses suggested that FGL1 promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and lymph tube formation, ultimately inducing lymph node metastasis. This was verified in vivo and in vitro. FGL1 knockdown inhibited these processes. Finally, shFGL1_AAV9 and shFGL1_AAV6 were verified as novel targeted therapies to knock down FGL1 in vivo, supporting the identification of new therapeutic targets to inhibit NSCLC metastasis. Conclusion We elucidated the role of FGL1 in NSCLC, proposing that FGL1 acts like a “shield machine cutter” in mediating T1 NSCLC N2 lymph node tube formation, creating metastasis channels. This provides the basis for novel FGL1-targeting treatment strategies.

Immune checkpoints contribute to the malignant progression of tumor by regulating tumor immune microenvironment and promote malignant behaviors such as tumor cell proliferation and metastasis [ 12 13 15 16 17 18 19 In this study, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyze T1N0M0 and T1N2M0 NSCLC tissue samples, as well as N2 lymph node metastasis samples, identifying a novel cell cluster known as CCNE1(+) cells. We found high fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) expression in CCNE1(+) cells and hypothesized that FGL1 might be involved in N2 lymph node metastasis in stage T1 NSCLC, acting like a “cutter head” of a shield machine. To verify this theory, we conducted a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments to prove that FGL1 facilitates glycolysis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) pathway, thereby enhancing tumor metastasis. We found that shFGL1_AAV6 and shFGL1_AAV9 targeted therapies showed promising therapeutic effects in inhibiting tumor proliferation and metastasis.

The migration promoting function of FGL1(+) cells in this group may mediate lymph node metastasis in stage T1 NSCLC, particularly N2 lymph node metastasis, and FGL1 expression coincides with the appearance of this cell group. Differential gene analysis indicated that FGL1 itself may promote metastasis in addition to its classical immune regulatory function as an immune checkpoint, suggesting that FGL1 may be closely related to lymph node metastasis in this cell group. Here, we proposed the “shield machine cutter” role of FGL1 in mediating N2 lymph node metastasis in T1 NSCLC, which, like opening up a subway channel, opens a lymph node metastasis channel. Furthermore, ETS1 was identified as the transcription factor responsible for high FGL1 FGL1 N2 lymph node metastasis in T1 NSCLC is high, although the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate among all Tumors, with NSCLC accounting for approximately 80% of all cases. Patients with stage T1 NSCLC, defined by a lung cancer tumor < 3 cm, are typically considered clinically as candidates for radical surgery and have a cure plan [ 28 3 29 FGL1 may be associated with immune cell suppression, although evidence of a direct correlation is limited. FGL1, a Ligand of lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3) [ 30 31 34 31 34 30 35 36 37 38 30 22 FGL1 may promote tumor growth, invasion, and migration; however, its role in lung cancer requires further investigation. FGL1 may be present as an oncogene in colon cancer, in FGL1-knockout mouse models implanted with MC38 colon cancer cells, the growth rate of colon cancer cells was significantly reduced compared to the control group, and the application of anti-FGL1 monoclonal antibodies showed favorable antitumor effects [ 30 FGL1 FGL1 39 FGL1 40 FGL1 FGL1 41 FGL1 FGL1 FGL1 21 We propose, for the first time, that FGL1 plays a role in glycolytic regulation. Some other immune checkpoints play a role in glycolytic regulation, such as PD-1/PD-L1, which is involved in immune regulation related to glucose metabolism. Previous studies have shown that when PD-1 binds to PD-L1, it transmits a signal via the T cell receptor (TCR). Src family kinases (such as lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (Lck) and Fyn) phosphorylate tyrosine at the immunoreceptor tyrosine inhibitory motif and immunoreceptor tyrosine switching motif sites on the PD-1 cytoplasmic tail, thereby recruiting phosphatase SHP-2. The downregulated Ras/AKT pathway is involved in TCRs and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway is involved in CD28 co-stimulatory receptors, which are key regulatory factors of T cell metabolism. Integration of TCR signals, CD28 co-stimulation, and cytokine receptors promotes glycolysis, and the upregulation of PD-1 counteracts these pathways, reducing T cell glycolysis, proliferation, and activation [ 42 44 45 46 + + + 47 + + 48 Currently, there are no clinical monoclonal antibodies that target FGL1, necessitating further foundational research. Various monoclonal drugs targeting LAG3, such as IMP321 and relatlimab, have been undergoing clinical trials [ 49 50 50 51 52 53 54 55 54 56 57 58 However, our study has some limitations. First, due to sampling and hardware constraints, we could not extract the CCNE1(+) Cells for research; second, in terms of immune escape from this population of cells, some other immune checkpoints showed higher expression in the CCNE1(+) Cells in lymph nodes, which may influence future tumor progression; additionally, marker genes with higher tumor intrinsic expression in CCNE1(+) Cells may also promote metastasis, necessitating further verification. Overall, our research focused on the role of FGL1 in NSCLC and the mechanisms of its involvement in lymph node metastasis in stage T1 NSCLC, with the aim of developing a feasible treatment strategy targeting FGL1, supported by preliminary preclinical verification to provide evidence for identifying new immunotherapy targets.
