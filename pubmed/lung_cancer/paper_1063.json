We investigated the genetic basis of HTLV-1C morbidity by constructing a chimeric HTLV-1A/C oI-L oI-L oI-L oI-L oI-L oI-L oI-L HTLV-1 type-C causes more severe disease than type-A, but the underlying reason is unclear. Here the authors show in a macaque model how type-C orf-I affects lung pathogenesis and the immune response to HTLV-1, providing a model to test viral targets for disease prevention.

Suspension cell lines: Jurkat T-lymphoblastic and monocytic THP-1 cell lines were cultured in a Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI 1640) medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells: PBMCs were separated from blood of healthy human donors, naïve rhesus macaques, or heparinized human neonatal umbilical cord blood by density gradient centrifugation by Ficoll Plaque (GE Healthcare). CD4 + CD4 + 6 + 6 Transfection HEK293T and HeLa cells were transfected using LipoD293 In vitro DNA transfection Reagent (cat. #SL100668, SignaGen Laboratories, Frederick, MD) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells were plated 18 h prior transfection, allowing the cells to reach a 70 to 80% confluency by the time of the transfection. The diluted LipoD293 (LipoD293 + media) was added to the diluted DNA (DNA + media) to a ratio LipoD293 (μl) – DNA (μg) of 3:1. The Mix was briefly vortexed and incubated at RT for 10–15 min. The mix was then added dropwise onto the media in each well, and the mixture was homogenized by gently swirling the plate. 12 h post-transfection, the LipoD293/DNA complex-containing media was replaced, and the transfection efficacy was checked 24–48 h post-transfection. Establishment of stable Jurkat (T-cell) and monocytic THP-1 cell lines expressing viral proteins Jurkat and THP-1 cell lines were transduced with GFP-expressing lentiviral empty vector control (pSDM) or pSDM expressing p12-HA, p16A-HA, or p16C-HA.

Briefly, 5 × 10 6 g oI-L Western blot Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (cat. #NP0321, NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris Protein Gels, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P PVDF, Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies to HTLV-1 p24 Gag (Mouse, Applied Biological Laboratories cat. #4310, 1:1000), HTLV-1 gp46 envelope (Mouse, Creative Biolabs, cat. #CBMAB-V208-1154-FY, 1:100), Tax (Tab172, 1:100 ref. 34 Source data Dual-Glo luciferase assay HEK293T cells were transfected with HTLV-1A-LTR-Luc, HTLV-1C-LTR-Luc, or NF-κB-Luc reporter plasmids and either HTLV-1A or HTLV-1A/C oI-L Renilla RNA extraction and reverse transcription PCR Total RNA was extracted from the stably infected cell lines, stably transduced Jurkat and THP-1 cell lines, as well as from macaque lung lobes using RNeasy plus mini kit (cat. #74034, Qiagen, Germantown, MD) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the cells were harvested and lysed in the RLT Plus buffer. The homogenized lysates are then transferred to a gDNA eliminator spin column and centrifuged for 30 s at 8500 × g g DNA extraction and viral DNA detection Genomic DNA from the PBMC, bone marrow, and biopsies from the Lymphnodes the BAL, and the lung lobes were isolated from all animals during the time course of the study except the lungs lobes collected at the time of the sacrifice, using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 100 ng of DNA were used as templates for the first round of PCR amplification. Three microliters of the PCR reaction were then used as a template for nested PCR. The PCR conditions used were 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 60 s, and a final extension at 68 °C for 7 min, and a hold at 4 °C. Platinum High Fidelity PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Correctly sized amplicons were identified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.

Each well of the ELISA plate was coated with HTLV-1 p24 core antigen (Prospec, cat. #hiv-108-c) at 500 ng per well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Wells were then emptied and blocked with Superblock Blocking Buffer in PBS (cat. #37515, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 1 h at room temperature. Serially diluted samples were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The plate was then washed with PBS Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the diluted goat anti-human IgG HRP (Kirkegaard & Perry Lab Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The plate was washed, and the 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA (cat. #34029, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding KPL HTLV serology Reactivity to specific HTLV-1 viral antigens in the plasma of the animals was detected with the use of a commercial HTLV-1 western immunoblot assay (GeneLabs Diagnostics, Redwood City, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, pre-hydrated strips are incubated for 1 h at RT on a rocking platform with 20 μL of animal sera in the presence of a blotting buffer. The strips are washed three times, then incubated for 1 h with the working conjugated solution. After the washes the Substrate solution is added to the strips and incubated at RT for 15 min. The strips are then washed and dried. Proximity extension assay (PEA) Plasma and BAL samples Protein quantification was executed employing the Olink® Target 48 Cytokine panel* (Olink Proteomics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols. This method leverages the Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) technology, as extensively detailed by Assarsson et al. 62 www.olink.com Output from the Olink software was further processed to extrapolate values for samples that were below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and above the upper limit of quantification (annotated as >ULOQ). The Olink software interpolates values below the LLOQ through fitting the 4-Pl model to a distinct minimum limit of detection for each plate of samples run, and values below this interpolation range are set to NaN. Since these values are below the limit of detection but not truly missing, for each assay, we determined a universal below detection value by taking the mode LLOQ across 22 plates, divided by 10,000 (which was below all interpolated values in this extensive historical dataset), and set all NaN to this assay-specific below detection value. Samples that were above the ULOQ were set to the ULOQ value for the indicated target assay from the plate on which the sample was run. Finally, true missing values annotated as No Data were converted to NA to be systematically treated as missing. THP-1 stably transduced cells THP-1 p12-HA-GFP or THP-1 p16C-HA-GFP stable cell lines were plated in 24-well plate at a density of 1 × 10 6 Flow cytometry analysis For the whole blood cell phenotyping, 100 μl of fresh EDTA whole blood was stained with Fluorochrome-conjugated mAbs. 1μl of the following antibodies were used: FITC anti-CD8 (clone DK25; cat. #FCMAB176F; EMB Millipore Corp.), BB700 anti-CD14 (clone M5E2; cat. #745790; BD Biosciences), PE-Cy5 anti-CD95 (clone DX2; cat. #305610; BioLegend), PE-Cy7 anti CD159 (NKG2a) (clone Z199; cat. # B10246 L23105 + − − + + + + − + + + − + + − − + + − + + + − + + + + + + − + + − + − + + − − − + + + − − − − − − − + + − + − − − 63 + − + + − + To measure neutrophils, monocytes, myeloid dendritic cells (mDC), and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and whole blood of the animals, 200 μL of whole EDTA blood and 1 × 10 6 L34962 + − − − − − − − + 64 + − − − − + low low 65 + − + + − + + − − − + − + − + − − − + − − + 66 + − − − − − − − − − + + − − − − − − + low low + − + + − + + − − − − − + − + − + − − − + − − + Efferocytosis assay The effect of the expression of p12 and p16C in apoptotic cells and how it affects the frequency of cells conducting efferocytosis was assessed by Efferocytosis Assay kit (cat. #601770, Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI) and CellTrace™ Far Red (cat. # C34564 + Effector cells CD14 + 6 + Monocytic THP-1 cells grown in R10 were counted and washed once with PBS.

Cells were fixed with freshly prepared 4.0% paraformaldehyde in PBS at RT for 5 min and rinsed thrice with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, rinsed thrice with PBS, and blocked with 4% BSA blocking buffer in PBS for 1 h at RT. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and incubated with an anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling) for 1 h at RT (dilution 1:100). Following rinsing with PBS, cells were washed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were then incubated for a further 1 h in the presence of secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), dilution 1:1000. Again, cells were rinsed once with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and washed three times with PBS. Cells were then incubated with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 30 min at RT. Cells were rinsed three times and kept at 4 °C in PBS until ready to image using the fluorescence microscope. Measurement of HA intensity in the peripheral region around the nucleus and the nuclei was used to calculate a ratio between the periphery/nucleus. Paired Student t-test was used for statistical evaluation. Histopathology Representative samples from each of the seven lung lobes were collected from each animal in accordance with the approved protocols by the NCI and/or NIAID Animal Care and Use Committees (ACUC; Protocol number: VB043) and preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 21 days. Subsequently, for all animals, one section of lung tissue from each of the seven lobes underwent processing using an automatic processor and was embedded into paraffin blocks. These blocks were then sectioned using a manual microtome and placed onto charged slides. Afterward, the slides were dried in an 80 °C oven for 1 h prior to Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining. The H&E staining process was carried out using the Sakura® Tissue-TekR Prisma™ automated Stainer, involving the application of commercial hematoxylin, clarifier, bluing reagent, and eosin-Y. A regressive staining method was employed, intentionally overstaining the tissues, and then utilizing a differentiation step (clarifier/bluing reagents) to remove excess stain. Finally, the slides were cover-slipped using the Sakura® Tissue-Tek™Glass® automatic cover slipper and allowed to dry before being evaluated in a blinded fashion for both control tissue and infected tissue. HTLV-1- Gag The presence of HTLV-1 virus was detected by staining 5 μm FFPE Rhesus macaque lung sections with the RNAScope® 2.5 LS probe V-HTLV-1-GAG (cat. #495058, ACD) with the RNAscope LS Multiplex Fluorescent Assay (cat. #322800, ACD) using the Bond RX auto-stainer (Leica Biosystems) with a tissue pretreatment 15 min at 95 °C with Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 (Leica Biosystems), 15 min of Protease III (ACD) at 40 °C, and 1:750 dilution of OPAL™ 570 reagent (AKOYA, Biosciences®). The RNAscope 2.5 LS Negative Control Probe (Bacillus subtilis dihydrodipicolinate reductase (dapB) gene, cat. #312038) was used as a negative control. The RNAscope® LS 2.5 Positive Control Probe Mmu-PPIB (peptidylprolyl isomerase B) (cat#457718) encoding cyclophilin B was used as a technical control to ensure the RNA quality of tissue sections was suitable for staining. Slides were digitally imaged using a PhenoImager® HT 2.0 (AKOYA, Biosciences®). It is important to note that RNAscope, immunohistochemistry, as well as histopathology assays were performed on consecutive slices from the same tissue fragment. Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry staining was performed on LeicaBiosystems BondRX autostainer with the following conditions: Epitope Retrieval 1 (Citrate 20′), CD3 (cat. #MCA1477 Bio-Rad, 1:100 60′) with secondary antibody Rabbit anti-Rat IgG (Vector Laboratories), CD20 (cat. #M0755, DAKO/Agilent, 1:200 30′), Microglia/Iba1 (cat. #CP290, Biocare, 1:500 30′), Smooth Muscle Actin (cat. #ab5694, Abcam, 1:500 30′), and the Bond Polymer Refine Detection Kit (cat. #DS9800, LeicaBiosystems). Isotype control reagents were used in place of primary antibodies for the negative controls. Slides were removed from the Bond autostainer, dehydrated through ethanols, cleared with xylenes, and cover-slipped.
