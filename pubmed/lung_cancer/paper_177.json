MAFLD is characterized by abnormal lipid accumulation in liver parenchymal cells and activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, the effect of Krüppel-like factor 16(KLF16) on glycolipid metabolism has been limited. We investigated whether KLF16 could alleviate MAFLD through endoplasmic reticulum stress. Methods HepG2 and mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with oleic acid (OA) to model MAFLD in vitro in vivo Results KLF16 expression was upregulated in MAFLD models. KLF16 downregulation aggravates lipid deposition in liver cells. The expression of ATF4 protein was downregulated in MAFLD models with KLF16 knockdown. KLF16 transcriptionally regulates ATF4 expression through two binding sites. ATF4 overexpression alleviates lipid deposition exacerbated by KLF16 knockdown in mice. Conclusion In the face of abnormal lipid deposition in MAFLD, liver cells can play a spontaneous protective role by upregulating KLF16, which can promote the expression of ATF4 at the transcriptional level, further affecting downstream lipid metabolism-related genes. KLF16 may serve as a promising target gene to improve the progression or prognosis of MAFLD.

The rise in the consumption of high-fat and high-sugar foods, combined with sedentary behaviors and inadequate physical activity, has contributed to the escalating prevalence of metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). MAFLD is characterized by abnormal lipid accumulation in liver parenchymal cells and poses a significant health burden [ 1 via 2 3 In China, the prevalence of chronic metabolic diseases has reached approximately 41.6%, among which more than 50% are suffering from MAFLD [ 4 5 6 Existing research has shown that hepatic steatosis is the most significant pathological feature of MAFLD in its initial stages. Physiologically, trace lipid droplets in hepatocytes can store energy and protect cells from lipid toxicity; however, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and oxidative stress have been found to be activated in hepatocytes with excess lipid deposition. Endoplasmic reticulum stress is a physiological pathway that regulates endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and plays a complex role in lipid accumulation in the liver [ 7 8 9 In the study of chronic metabolic diseases, the Krüppel-like factor (KLF) family of transcription factors has been reported to be involved in many glucose and lipid metabolism processes. For example, KLF2 and KLF3 can affect lipid synthesis by participating in adipocyte differentiation, and KLF7 can participate in diabetes by impairing insulin synthesis and secretion in islet beta cells [ 10 11 12 Materials and methods Animals A total of 24 male C57BL/6J mice, aged 5 weeks, were obtained from Gem Pharmatech Co., Ltd. All animals were maintained under uniform standard conditions: a 12-h light/dark cycle, temperature maintained at 20–22 °C, access to clean drinking water, and a sufficient normal diet. Following a 1-week acclimatization period, mice were randomly divided into four groups ( n Adeno-associated virus 8(AAV8) has strong tissue specificity to the liver. Once infected, it can stably exist for a long time. AAV8 does not integrate into the mouse genome, and has no association with any diseases that have been found. Therefore, we chose AAV8 as a vector and integrated the shRNA used for inhibiting KLF16 expression (AAV8-shRNA-KLF16) in mouse livers. Similarly, we constructed the corresponding AAV8 virus to overexpress the ATF4 gene in the livers of mice (AAV8-ATF4). Groups iii) and iv) underwent AAV8-shRNA-KLF16 administration via After an additional 4-week feeding period, all mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation after a 6-hour fasting period. The experimental procedure is illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 1. Mice experiment process plan diagram. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and oil red O staining For HE staining, the procedure began by allowing the frozen sections to acclimate to room temperature for 15 min. They were then fixed in a 95% ethanol solution for 1 min. Subsequently, the slides were immersed in a hematoxylin dye bath for 5 min. After hematoxylin staining, the excess dye was washed away under running water. The sections were briefly immersed (for 2 s) in a 1% hydrochloric acid-ethanol solution, followed by a water rinse. The slides were then placed in an eosin dye bath for 1-minute staining. After eosin staining, the excess dye was removed by washing the sections with water. The sections were dehydrated using a series of gradient alcohol concentrations and cleared using xylene. Finally, the slides were sealed with neutral gum to maintain the staining. Frozen slices were taken from a −80 °C refrigerator and left for 15 min at room temperature. The sections were then immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The sections were rinsed with distilled water before immersion in a 60% isopropyl alcohol solution for 3–5 min. The sections were then directly transferred into an Oil Red O working solution for staining, which lasted for 10 min. After staining, the sections were re-immersed in 60% isopropyl alcohol solution for 3-minute immersion, followed by washing with distilled water. Finally, the stained sections were sealed to maintain the staining results. Biochemical indicators analysis The levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), ALT, and AST in the mouse plasma were assessed using an Automatic Biochemical Analyzer (Chemray 800, Rayto Life and Analytical Sciences Co., Ltd.). The intrahepatic contents of TG and TC were quantified using kits supplied by the Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (A111-1-1, A110-1-1), with the procedures carried out in strict accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell line and primary hepatocytes culture Human HepG2 cell line (from American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) and mouse primary hepatocytes were used in this study. They have been used to model MAFLD in vitro 13 14 The first step in modeling MAFLD in vitro Human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells (from American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were used as cell vectors in the dual-lucifease reporter due to their high amplification efficiency and high transfection efficiency. They were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, C11875500BT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, 10270-106) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, 15140122) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The medium was changed every other day. Cell transfection The cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at an appropriate density. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with Opti-MEM to prepare cells for transfection. Subsequently, siRNA or plasmids were introduced into the target cells using the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection kit (Invitrogen, L3000-015). The transfection time was 8–12 h, and the transfected cells were then replaced with normal cell medium. RT-qPCR TRIzol RNA extraction reagent was used to isolate total RNA from liver tissue or liver cells. Following RNA extraction, a high-efficiency reverse transcription kit (TOYOBO, FSQ-301) was used to synthesize cDNA, which was essential for RT-qPCR analysis. The expression levels of specific genes across various samples were quantified using RT-qPCR, facilitated by the ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Q711-02) and multiple primers. Detailed information regarding the primer sequences is provided in Table S1(A–B) Western blot RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, P0013C) supplemented with 1% protease inhibitor PMSF (Beyotime Biotechnology, ST505) was used for the extraction of total proteins from liver tissue or liver cells. Protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA protein assay kit (KeyGEN Biotech, KGP903). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (Beyotime Biotechnology, P0012A) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Servicebio Technology, WGPVDF22). Ladders used in the western blot were from Epizyme Biotech (WJ102). The PVDF membrane was immersed in 5% skim milk powder solution at room temperature for 1 h for blocking. The membrane was then removed and rinsed with TBST solution three times for 5 min each. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific primary antibodies. After another series of washes, the membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. After washing, the membrane was developed using an Extremely Sensitive ECL Chemiluminescence Kit (NCM Biotech, P10060 Table S1C Dual-luciferase reporter The gene sequence of KLF16 was cloned and subsequently inserted into the pcDNA3.1. The eukaryotic vector expressing KLF16 was termed pcDNA3.1-KLF16. To examine the affinity of the transcription factor KLF16 for the ATF4 promoter sequences, recombinant plasmid PGL3, which contains the predicted binding sites or mutated ATF4 promoter sequences, was constructed and transfected into (HEK)-293T with pcDNA3.1-KLF16. The recombinant plasmid constructed was termed PGL3-ATF4, PGL3-MUT1, PGL3-MUT2, and PGL3-MUT1 + 2. The expression level of luciferase in cells increased with the growth of the affinity of the transcription factor KLF16 for the promoter sequences from different groups, ultimately affecting the relative fluorescence intensity of the cell homogenates of different groups. (HEK)-293T cells were cultured in a 6-well plate as a cell carrier. PcDNA3.1 and PGL-3 plasmids were co-transfected according to the guidelines provided by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay Kit (KeyGEN BioTECH, KGAF040). Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess data normality. Homogeneity of variance was evaluated using the Brown–Forsythe test. For comparisons between two groups, an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t p Results The expression of KLF16 is up-regulated in MAFLD models Following established protocols, we treated HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes with oleic acid (OA) and subjected C57/BL6J mice to a 12-week high-fat diet regimen. Oil Red O staining revealed a marked increase in lipid accumulation in OA-treated liver cells, with the quantity and variety of lipid droplets significantly surpassing those in the control group, as depicted in Figure 2 p Figure 2H,I Figure 2.

Consistent with the literature, upon MAFLD insult, the liver expression of ER stress-related proteins was altered, notably ATF4 and p-EIF2α, which surged in both cellular and mouse MAFLD models ( Figure 2J,K Figure 1A,B Knockdown of KLF16 induces increased hepatic lipid deposition To assess the impact of altered KLF16 expression on lipid metabolism homeostasis in the liver, siRNA targeting KLF16 was designed, with sequences for both mouse and human siRNA-KLF16, as detailed in Table 1 via Figure 3A–D Figure 3E Figure 3.

Upregulated Glycerol-3-Phosphate Acyltransferase (GPAT), a gene linked to TG synthesis, was correlated with the observed increase in hepatocyte TG levels ( Figure 3G Transcriptional factor KLF16 regulate expression of ATF4 In a cellular MAFLD model, increased lipid deposition in the cells was observed in association with low KLF16 expression. This was accompanied by altered expression patterns of ER stress-related proteins ( Figure 4A,B Figure S2A,B Figure 4C Figure 4. Transcriptional factor KLF16 regulate expression of ATF4 (A–B) Western blot is done to check proteins involved in ER stress in HepG2 and primary hepatocyte from OA or OA+siRNA-KLF16 induced subjects ( n n n t p p p p To confirm whether KLF16 is directly involved in transcriptional regulation of ATF4, we used the JASPAR ( https://jaspar.elixir.no/ Figure 4E However, through mutating the ATF4 promoter sequences (MUT1 and MUT2) to lose its affinity for KLF16, a marked reduction in luciferase activity was observed, indicating that both predicted sites could be recognized and bound by KLF16. When both sites were mutated, luciferase activity decreased further and aligned with the activity observed following transfection with the PGL3 plasmid alone. This demonstrates that these two binding sites are pivotal for KLF16’s transcriptional regulation of ATF4. Overexpression of ATF4 alleviates hepatic lipid deposition caused by down-regulation of KLF16 KLF16 expression levels were verified by western blotting (WB) and RT-qPCR. As shown in Figure 5A,B Figure 5C,D Figure 5.

Overexpression of ATF4 alleviates hepatic lipid deposition caused by down-regulation of KLF16 (A) serum ALT, AST, TC, TG, HDL, LDL in mice ( n n n t p p p p RT-qPCR analysis revealed that genes related to lipid synthesis, ATP Citrate Synthase (ACLY), Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase Alpha (ACC1), FASN, GPAT, and ELOVL6, were downregulated in the HFD + shKLF16 group, indicating suppressed liver lipid production. However, Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Synthetase (ACSL), a crucial enzyme involved in fatty acid metabolism, was also downregulated, suggesting impaired lipid metabolism pathways. In the HFD + shKLF16 + ATF4 group, upregulation of ACSL, CPT2, APOA, and APOB resulted in enhanced liver fatty acid β-oxidation and lipid transport compared with the HFD + shKLF16 group. The upregulation of ACSS2, ACLY, ACC1, FASN, GPAT, and ELOVL6 suggests an increase in de novo lipid synthesis in the liver. The collective effect in the HFD + shKLF16 + ATF4 group was a reduction in liver lipid deposition ( Figure 6(D,E) Discussion The rapidly increasing incidence and prevalence of MAFLD raise serious health concerns as it is intricately linked to various chronic metabolic diseases. Poorly managed MAFLD can even increase the potential risk of liver cancer [ 15 16 First, KLF16 was found to exhibit an upregulated expression trend in both in vitro in vivo 7 17 To further explore the role of KLF16 in MAFLD, we artificially knocked down KLF16 expression in HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes. It was found that after the same concentration of oleic acid induction for the same time, intracellular lipid deposition was more severe in the group with low KLF16 expression. In HepG2, KLF16 knockdown is accompanied by a decline of FABP1, showing a weakening of lipid intake. The down-regulation of CPT1, LCAD limits the β-oxidation process of fatty acids within cells. The upregulation of GPAT and SCD indicates the promotion of lipid synthesis processes. In HepG2 cells, the knockdown of KLF16 weakens the uptake and consumption of lipids by hepatocytes, promoting the synthesis of lipids instead. In mouse primary hepatocytes, genes related to lipid metabolism, including de novo lipid synthesis (ACSS2, ACC1, FASN, GPAT, ELOVL6), fatty acid β-oxidation (CPT2), lipid transport (apolipoprotein), and lipid uptake (FABP1, FATP5), all decreased along with the inhibition of KLF16 expression. This result suggests that the inhibition of KLF16 expression caused lipid metabolism in the in vitro There is no significant difference in TC content in lipid deposition, but TG content increased with the knockdown of KLF16. At the same time, along with the decreased expression of KLF16, ER stress-related proteins activated by lipid deposition in cells were also affected. In HepG2 cells, the expressions of PERK, ATF4, and IRE1-α were downregulated. In primary mouse hepatocytes, the expressions of IRE1-α, BIP, and ATF4 were downregulated. All indicate impaired activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress. Among them, IRE1-α is mainly responsible for degrading mRNA, thereby alleviating the protein load of the endoplasmic reticulum. IRE1-α downregulation weakened the self-regulatory ability of the endoplasmic reticulum, which may be one of the reasons for the intensification of intracellular lipid deposition. Combined with the above experimental results, ATF4 was found to have the same expression trend as KLF16. Previous studies have suggested that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress activation is a physiological response to abnormal lipid droplet deposition in liver cells [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 Further experiments revealed that KLF16 transcriptionally regulates the expression of ATF4. The results of the dual luciferase reporter assay showed that the transcription factor KLF16 promotes the expression of ATF4 mainly by binding the GTCACGCCCAT and TCCCCGCCCAC site sequences of the ATF4 gene promoter. The knockdown of KLF16 inhibits the expression of ATF4. As an important molecule in the unfolded protein reaction (UPR) process, ATF4 decline reduces the tolerance of hepatocytes to lipid stimulation, intensifies the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, and promotes cell death, thereby aggravating lipid deposition in the liver. In order to study how KLF16 regulates ATF4 and thereby affects the lipid metabolism within hepatocytes, in vivo 24 25–26 in vivo 27 28 In the physiological state, fatty acids in hepatic parenchymal cells combine to form triglycerides and cholesterol esters, which are stored in lipid droplets at physiological levels that are dynamically turned over within cells through continuous cycles of synthesis, growth, and degradation, thereby providing energy and serving as precursors for cellular components [ 29 30 Along with the overexpression of ATF4 in the HFD+shKLF16 + ATF4 group, it was found that lipid deposition in the liver improved significantly. Also, the expression of genes related to lipid transport (APOA, APOB), genes related to lipid synthesis (ACSS2, ACLY, ACC1, FASN, GPAT, ELOVL6), Genes related to lipid oxidation (ACSL, CPT2), were all upregulated. Based on the above results, it was hypothesized that KLF16 promotes the expression of ATF4 at the transcriptional level in MAFLD, thereby enhancing the tolerance of hepatic parenchymal cells to lipid deposition and improving lipid deposition in the liver through the dynamic balance of lipid circulation within hepatic parenchymal cells. Restoration of the regulatory ability of the endoplasmic reticulum transforms different fatty acids into neutral lipids with lower lipid toxicity for further processing. Lipid deposition induced by KLF16 knockdown might achieve lipid digestion through the upregulation of liver outward transport of lipid droplets or the promotion of mitochondrial β-oxidation after the overexpression of ATF4 [ 31 32 This study provides a new explanation for the emergence of MAFLD and provides a new entry point for effective treatment of the disease. For MAFLD patients in the early stage, patients can be divided into groups based on the liver KLF16 expression level to predict disease progression and prognosis. Through gene therapy for MAFLD, patients can increase the expression of KLF16 in the liver to improve liver tolerance to lipid deposition. By now, our research still has limitations. This study has not further explored the effect of KLF16 expression change on intracellular lipid composition and proportion in MAFLD hepatocytes. Further studies are needed to verify whether KLF16 has the same or opposite direct regulatory effects on other ER stress-related proteins. Phenotypic validation in human liver cells has not been performed in this study. In future studies, we will combine the lipid omics changes in the liver after KLF16 knockdown and the changes in lipid metabolism-related molecules for a combined analysis, hypothesis, and exploration. Conclusion In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that the upregulation of KLF16 may act as a spontaneous protective mechanism and be involved in regulating lipid metabolism in the liver in MAFLD. The upregulation of KLF16 promotes the expression of ATF4 at the transcriptional level, maintains the activation of the PERK-EIF2α-ATF4 pathway during endoplasmic reticulum stress, promotes the expression of downstream lipid transportation-related genes, fatty acid β-oxidization-related genes, and lipid synthesis-related genes, facilitates the entry of deposited lipids into the dynamic cyclic metabolic process, and improves lipid deposition lesions. This approach highlights the potential of KLF16 as a key factor in the complex regulatory network for alleviating lipid-induced liver stress, providing a promising approach for future therapeutic interventions in MAFLD.
