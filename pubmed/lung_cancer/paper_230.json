This study aimed to identify risk factors and develop prediction models for postoperative chronic opioid use (PCOU). Methods This retrospective cohort study used data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) between January 2008 and December 2018. Of 2 077 825 patients aged seven years or older who underwent surgery, survived at least one year, and had no additional surgeries, 1 108 119 were randomly selected. Logistic regression (LR) and machine learning models were developed to identify risk factors for PCOU. PCOU was defined as having filled 10 or more prescriptions or receiving more than 120 days’ supply between postoperative days 91 and 365. Age, sex, medical comorbidities (systemic diseases, psychological disorders, and substance use disorders), preoperative medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, opioids, and nonopioid analgesics), and type of surgery were assessed as potential risk factors. Results PCOU occurred in 9308 patients (0.84%). Older age, preoperative history of opioid use, and high in-hospital opioid doses were the three most important predictors. Among the 28 most commonly performed surgical procedures in Korea, lung surgery, general spinal surgery, and total knee arthroplasty were most strongly associated with chronic opioid use. Conclusions According to the best-performing gradient boosting model, older age, longer hospital stay, high in-hospital opioid consumption, and preoperative opioid use were the most important risk factors for PCOU.

Compared to traditional statistical approaches, ML methods are better equipped to detect nonlinear relationships and complex interactions among predictors [ 17 20 21 The primary objective of this study was to identify risk factors and develop a model for predicting postoperative chronic opioid use (PCOU) using the NHIS database. A secondary objective was to assess the current state of PCOU in Korea by examining existing patterns and prevalence. We hypothesized that ML-based analysis would effectively identify risk factors for PCOU and quantify their impact. Materials and Methods This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Hanyang University Medical Center (HYU-2020-07-019; approval date: July 21, 2020) and the National Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service (NHIS-2021-1-234; approval date: October 2020), and the requirement for written informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study design. Data sources From the Korean NHIS, we obtained medical services and pharmacy claims data, including patient information such as age, sex, diagnosis information (based on the International Classification of Diseases [ICD]) and specific information on procedures and prescriptions from all medical institutes in South Korea. Study cohorts The study population included patients aged seven years or older who underwent surgery between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2018 (n = 11 112 785). Procedural codes newly entered into the database during the first postoperative year were used to identify patients who underwent additional surgery. Of the 2 077 825 patients meeting these criteria, 1 108 119 were randomly selected by an NHIS big data system manager who did not participate in the analysis ( Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Outcome variables Our outcome of interest was PCOU, defined as having filled ≥ 10 prescriptions or > 120 days' supply between postoperative days (PODs) 91 and 365 [ 9 22 We used prescription data for opioids available in South Korea during the study period: morphine, fentanyl, alfentanil, sufentanil, remifentanil, oxycodone, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, meperidine, codeine, tramadol, butorphanol, buprenorphine, and nalbuphine. Covariates Based on previous literature, we assessed age, sex, medical comorbidities (systemic diseases, psychological disorders, and substance abuse), preoperative medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines [BZDs], opioids, and non-opioid analgesics), and surgery type as potential risk factors. Patients were considered to have comorbidities if they had relevant ICD-10 codes within one year before surgery, as listed in Table 1 Supplementary Table 1 Supplementary Table 2 The morphine milligram equivalent (MME) dose of each opioid was calculated by multiplying the absolute dose by a conversion factor based on published literature ( Supplementary Table 3 23 25 The website of the Korean Statistical Information Service ( http://kosis.kr Supplementary Table 4 Model development and validation A total of 28 variables were selected from the NHIS dataset. We developed the following ML models to predict PCOU: naïve Bayes, decision tree, random forest (RF), feed-forward neural network, and gradient boosting machine (GBM). For comparison, an LR model was also built using the same dataset. Details on selecting optimal hyperparameters for the RF and GBM models and descriptions of each ML model are provided in Supplementary Material 1 To evaluate model performance, we conducted 10-fold cross-validation. The performance of the five ML models and the LR model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). Sensitivity and specificity were determined at the point of highest Youden’s index. Pairwise comparisons of AUROCs were performed using the DeLong test. After identifying the best-performing ML model, we used Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) plots to visualize the influence of each variable on PCOU prediction. In the SHAP plot, the x-axis represents a log-scaled feature space, and each point corresponds to a test sample. Feature values are reflected as SHAP values, indicating the degree of contribution [ 26 Statistical analysis Quantitative variables are presented as the median (1st-to-3rd quartiles). Qualitative variables are presented as patients’ counts and percentages. For univariate analyses, the Mann–Whitney U Exploratory analysis To assess the impact of PCOU on patient survival while controlling for various factors, survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for the control and chronic groups were compared using a log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio between the two groups, adjusting for age, preoperative comorbidities, and preoperative medication use. The proportional hazards assumption was considered met if the log-minus-log survival curves of the two groups ran parallel without intersecting. A two-sided P value < 0.01 was considered statistically significant. Results Out of 1 108 119 patients, 9308 (0.84%) developed PCOU. Compared to the control group, the chronic group was older, included more male patients, used preoperative medications more frequently, consumed higher amounts of opioids perioperatively, had longer hospital stays, and experienced higher mortality and greater incidences of medical comorbidities ( Tables 1 2 Table 2 Supplementary Fig. 1 Supplementary Table 5 According to the LR model ( Table 3 Supplementary Table 6 The optimal hyperparameters determined from our experiments were 400 trees for the RF model and a maximum depth of 3 for the GBM model. Fig. 3 Supplementary Table 6 Supplementary Table 7 According to the GBM model, the three most important variables were age, number of hospital days, and opioid use during the hospital stay per prescribed day. Two plots were generated: one showing the top 15 variables ranked by SHAP values ( Fig. 4 Supplementary Fig. 2 Fig. 5 Discussion In this study, the incidence of PCOU was 0.84%. This finding is noteworthy because the incidence has not previously been studied in a single, large population. A recent study reported an incidence of 0.3% [ 9 15 9 15 We found that older age was the most important risk factor for PCOU followed by longer hospital stays, greater opioid use during hospitalization, and a history of preoperative opioid use, as indicated by SHAP analysis from the GBM model. Some studies have suggested that older patients are more likely to develop PCOU [ 9 27 29 30 31 30 8 32 33 34 The role of preoperative opioid use in prolonged opioid use has been well established in previous studies [ 15 30 35 9 15 35 35 Table 2 36 37 38 It is important to note that our analysis was adjusted for postoperative MME and hospital length of stay (LOS). This allowed us to estimate the direct effects of baseline characteristics (e.g., age, preoperative opioid use) on PCOU, independent of postoperative variables. Our goal was to identify individuals who may be inherently more at higher risk regardless of their postoperative course. Understanding these direct effects can help clinicians proactively identify and manage high-risk patients. However, this approach does not capture the total effect of baseline factors that could include both the direct and indirect pathways mediated through postoperative MME and hospital LOS. For example, older patients might be more likely to have longer hospital stays and require more opioids postoperatively, increasing their risk of PCOU. By adjusting for these mediators, we have effectively removed this indirect pathway from our analysis. Therefore, our findings reflect the direct effect of baseline factors, while the total effect may be larger and more complex. Future research could explore the total effect by using models that do not adjust for postoperative factors, allowing for a more comprehensive perspective of the factors contributing to PCOU. It is important to acknowledge that our study did not include direct measures of postoperative pain that can influence both perioperative opioid use and the development of PCOU. This introduces the possibility that unmeasured confounding by postoperative pain may have influenced our results. For instance, inadequate pain control due to restrictive opioid administration strategies could potentially lead some patients to develop PCOU. This limitation should be considered when interpreting our findings. Furthermore, postoperative pain may influence long-term survival. While we did not have data to assess this directly, it is plausible that poorly controlled postoperative pain could negatively impact patients’ quality of life, physical functioning, and overall health, potentially affecting survival outcomes. If postoperative pain is indeed associated with survival, our Cox regression model may not fully capture the complex relationship between PCOU and long-term outcomes. However, even with this limitation in mind, the observed association between perioperative opioid consumption and PCOU, supported by our findings and existing literature [ 39 41 In this study, the rates of preoperative BZD and opioid use were 30.4% and 62.0%, respectively. At first glance, these results may seem high; however, recent literature on surgical patients in South Korea highlights concerning trends in medication use. A study using the NHIS database found that 52.4% of patients aged 18 and older undergoing total joint arthroplasty had received opioid prescriptions for over 90 days preoperatively [ 42 43 44 45 The correlation between PCOU and the type of surgery is another critical point of this study, given the varying degrees of pain and recovery associated with different surgical procedures. In our study examining postoperative opioid use across 28 frequently performed surgical procedures in Korea, we identified lung surgery, general spine surgery, and TKA as the surgeries most strongly associated with PCOU. These three types of surgeries are known to induce significant postoperative pain and subsequent opioid requirements. Lung surgery, for instance, involves substantial postoperative pain due to the invasiveness of thoracic procedures [ 46 47 49 Our retrospective study design inherently presents limitations. First, some important information (postoperative pain, height, body weight, and laboratory and radiological findings) was unavailable in the NHIS database and thus was not included in this study. Second, because patients’ underlying diseases were investigated based on the claim codes registered in the NHIS database, some diseases that the patients actually had may be missing in our study. Third, specific surgeries that were not reimbursed by NHIS (e.g., cosmetic and robotic surgeries) were not included in this study. Fourth, we could not distinguish the effects of opioids used intraoperatively from those used perioperatively because the NHIS database shows only the doses of opioids used during the hospital stay, without specifically indicating those administered intraoperatively. Fifth, because our results depend only on prescription data, it is unclear whether patients adhered to or complied with the prescriptions. Finally, our retrospective design may introduce hidden confounding variables, limiting the ability to establish a definitive causal relationship between intraoperative opioid use and chronic postoperative use. Detailed data collection and advanced statistical adjustments, such as propensity score matching or inverse probability of treatment weighting are recommended to mitigate these confounders. Future prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings with greater rigor. We developed the ML model using 28 important variables that showed that older age, longer hospital stays, higher perioperative opioid consumption, and a history of preoperative opioid use markedly increase the likelihood of PCOU. Notably, patients undergoing lung surgery, general spine procedures, and TKA are at heightened risk. Our findings can guide personalized opioid prescribing practices, potentially reducing the risk of PCOU in high-risk patients by tailoring pain management strategies based on individual risk profiles and enhancing overall patient safety in postoperative care.
