Omics analysis is widely used in the screening of tumor markers. However, effective markers that can indicate tumor metastasis in tissues and organs have not been screened out. The present study aimed to use the existing commonly used clinical tumor marker detection indicators to simply indicate possible metastatic organs through abnormal changes in their content. For this, three types of lung cancer, namely, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), were selected for analysis. Patients of each type were grouped according to whether the tumor metastasized and whether it metastasized to a single tissue or organ, such as the lymph nodes, pleura, bones, liver and brain. The pre-treatment peripheral serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA)15-3, CA125, CA19-9, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen and cytokeratin 19 fragment antigen 21-1 (CYFRA21-1) levels were recorded. The tumor markers that differed from the non-metastasis group were preliminarily determined by one-way analysis of variance, and the ROC curve method was used to determine the marker's ability to evaluate metastasis to a certain organ. In LUAD, compared with levels in patients without metastasis, CA15-3 and CA19-9 levels were significantly increased in the group with lymph node metastasis, only the CA15-3 level was significantly increased in the group with pleural metastasis, CEA, CA15-3 and CA125 levels were significantly increased in the group with bone metastasis, only the CA125 level was significantly increased in the group with liver metastasis and only the CYFRA21-1 level was significantly increased in the group with brain metastasis. Compared with that in LUAD without metastasis, CEA and CA15-3 had a good diagnostic effect on bone metastasis screening, and CYFRA21-1 also had a good diagnostic effect on brain metastasis. There was no significant difference in the levels of tumor markers in the peripheral blood of LUSC patients with tissue and organ metastasis. In SCLC, compared with levels in the control group, CEA and CA125 levels were significantly increased in patients with bone metastasis, and CA125 and CA19-9 levels were significantly increased in patients with liver metastasis. In SCLC tumors, CEA and CA125 exhibited good diagnostic value for determining bone metastasis. CA125 and CA19-9 also exhibited some diagnostic value for liver metastasis. In conclusion, the levels of peripheral blood tumor markers CEA, CA15-3, CA125, CA19-9, SCC and CYFRA21-1 in patients lung cancer have clinical diagnostic value in specifically indicating the organs where lung cancer metastasizes. lung adenocarcinoma lung squamous cell carcinoma non-small cell lung carcinoma tumor markers tumor metastasis Public Hospital Research Joint Fund Science and Technology Project 2024GLIH0990 Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 2021MS08060 Inner Mongolia Medical University Joint Project YKD2022LH072 Chifeng Natural Science Foundation SZR2023086 This study was supported by the Public Hospital Research Joint Fund Science and Technology Project (grant no. 2024GLIH0990), the Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (grant no. 2021MS08060), the Inner Mongolia Medical University Joint Project (grant no.

In total, ~90% of patients with lung cancer die from metastasis, as the cancer quickly spreads to the lymph nodes, bones, brain and liver ( 5 6 8 Tumor markers are substances produced by the tumor or the body's microenvironment during tumor occurrence and development ( 9 10 11 et al 12 13 14 15 15 17 18 19 At present, traditional tumor-associated antigen (TAA) biomarkers, such as cytokeratin 19 fragment antigen 21-1 (CYFRA21-1), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen, and carbohydrate antigen (CA)125, CA15-3 and CA19-9, are widely used as reference diagnostics for lung cancer ( 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Materials and methods Patients The present study included 631 patients (mean age, 62.9±3.7; range, 39–81 years) who were hospitalized in Chifeng Municipal Hospital (Chifeng, Inner Mongolia, China) and diagnosed with lung cancer between January and June 2024, including 357 males and 274 females ( Table I Detection of tumor markers Fasting peripheral venous blood samples (4.0 ml) were collected from patients in non-anticoagulated tubes. All patients had samples collected once at the time of consultation and before treatment. Within 2 h of blood collection, the serum was separated by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 15 min at room temperature. The fully automatic luminescent immunoassay analyzer ARCHITECT ™ ROC curve analysis ROC curve refers to the line drawn from each point under specific stimulation conditions, with the false alarm probability P (y/N) obtained by the subject under different judgment criteria as the horizontal coordinate and the hit probability P (y/SN) as the vertical coordinate ( 27 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 21; IBM Corp.). Normally distributed data are presented as the mean ± SEM and the median (interquartile range). Tumor marker concentrations between metastatic (lymph nodes, pleura, bone, liver and brain) and non-metastatic groups were compared using Student's unpaired t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Multiple group comparisons were performed using ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test, with Tukey's post hoc test used in the event of significant results. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference, and markers with significant differences in both tests were considered to have potential diagnostic value. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the predictive probability of lung cancer metastasis by tumor markers. ROC curves were drawn using the predicted probability as a variable, and the AUC was calculated to assess the statistical significance of each marker. Results Patient characteristics When metastasis occurred, the lymph nodes and bones were the most common sites, with 181 and 120 patients, respectively, followed by 67 patients with brain metastasis. There were 286 patients with lung cancer (aged <60 years) and 345 patients with lung cancer (≥60 years), accounting for 45.3 and 54.7% of patients with lung cancer, respectively. The characteristics of the patients are shown in Table I Significance of single tumor marker in screening LUAD metastatic organs Data on the peripheral blood content of tumor markers in patients with LUAD and tissue and organ metastasis were collected. Compared with those in patients without metastasis, the levels of CA15-3 (P=0.0074) and CA19-9 (P=0.0348) significantly increased when lymph node metastasis occurred, the level of CA15-3 (P=0.0181) significantly increased when pleural metastasis occurred, the levels of CEA (P<0.001), CA15-3 (P=0.0084) and CA125 (P=0.0043) significantly increased when bone metastasis occurred, the level of CA125 (P=0.0345) significantly increased when liver metastasis occurred and the level of CYFRA21-1 (P=0.0140) significantly increased when brain metastasis occurred ( Table II Fig. 1 In order to present the data more intuitively, bar graphs were used and statistical analysis was performed using the data of the different groups. CEA in bone metastasis, CA19-9 in lymph node metastasis and CYFRA21-1 in brain metastasis showed strong organ specificity, while SCC content only showed a metastatic trend ( Fig. 1 Compared with levels in lung cancer without metastasis, CEA (AUC, 0.78) and CA15-3 (AUC, 0.71) showed good diagnostic effects on bone metastasis screening. CYFRA21-1 (AUC, 0.87) also revealed a good diagnostic effect on brain metastasis screening. Although the tissue specificity was not high, the AUC values of CA15-3 in lymph node and pleural metastasis screening were 0.77 and 0.79, respectively, which also indicated good diagnostic value ( Fig. 2 Significance of single tumor marker in screening LUSC metastatic organs LUSC and LUAD are both NSCLCs. Unlike in LUAD, in LUSC with tissue and organ metastasis, the peripheral blood levels of various tumor markers did not show significant differences, although CEA and CA15-3 levels showed a slight upward trend when liver metastasis occurred ( Table III Fig. S1 Table III Fig. S1 Significance of single tumor marker in screening SCLC metastatic organs SCLC is considered one of the most aggressive cancers. Compared with the levels in the control group, the levels of CEA (P=0.0090) and CA125 (P=0.0019) were significantly increased in patients with bone metastasis. The increase of CEA indicates the possibility of bone metastasis. CA125 (P=0.0002) and CA19-9 (P<0.001) levels were significantly increased in liver metastasis, and the increase in CA19-9 suggests the possibility of liver metastasis. No significant changes were found in the content of SCC when metastasis occurred in various tissues and organs ( Table IV Fig. 3 In SCLC tumors, CEA (AUC, 0.83) and CA125 (AUC, 0.87) exhibited promising diagnostic value for determining bone metastasis. CA125 (AUC, 0.63) and CA19-9 (AUC, 0.65) may have certain diagnostic value in liver metastasis ( Fig. 4 Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Discussion Lung cancer is the most common malignant tumor in the world, with the highest incidence and mortality rates among malignant tumors. Tumor metastasis is the main cause of tumor-associated death, and early detection of tumor metastasis sites is crucial for subsequent treatment. The selection of lung cancer tumor markers has remained stable for a long time, although there have been some minor changes. The 2011 guidelines recommended the use of CEA, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), CYFRA21-1 and SCC ( 28 29 30 et al 31 32 et al 31 32 33 34 et al 35 36 37 38 39 40 et al 41 et al 42 43 et al 44 45 et al 46 Brain metastasis is the most common form of central nervous system malignancy, with ~50% of cases originating from lung cancer ( 47 48 et al 49 et al 50 et al 51 et al 52 In complex multicellular organisms, different cells are specialized to perform different functions, often through differentiation ( 53 54 55 56 et al 57 et al 58 et al 59 et al 60 61 62 63 64 65 67 et al 68 The current study also has some limitations. It is a retrospective, single cohort study based on currently limited data. The results may not be applicable to patient groups in different regions and need to be further studied by expanding the sample size through multicenter studies. Only six tumor markers were observed, and the potential of other markers as tumor organ specific remains to be studied. In particular, the present study did not explore other biomarkers that may improve diagnostic accuracy. Some patient groups were missing tumor markers, and the diagnostic ability of the marker was slightly flawed, which requires further research. Multiple markers were not analyzed together to evaluate their ability to distinguish organ metastasis. Although the patients underwent adequate physical examinations upon admission, diseases that may affect changes in tumor markers, such as inflammation, cannot be ruled out. Smoking status and certain treatment methods may affect biomarker levels. In the early stages of lung cancer, most metastases occur in a single organ, so the present study did not involve multiple organs. Future studies should also consider multiple organ metastases that are common in clinical practice. In summary, in patients with LUAD metastasis, increased levels of peripheral blood CEA and CA15-3 can better predict the occurrence of bone metastasis, increased CYFRA21-1 is related to the occurrence of brain metastasis, and increased CA15-3 is related to lymph node and pleural metastasis. In patients with SCLC, increased levels of CEA and CA125 are associated with bone metastasis. No markers for predicting metastasis have been found in patients with LUSC. The levels of peripheral blood tumor markers CEA, CA15-3, CA125, CA19-9, SCC and CYFRA21-1 in patients with lung cancer have some clinical diagnostic value in specifically indicating the organs where lung cancer metastasizes.
