The half-maximal inhibitory\nconcentration (IC 50   Over the past decade, real-time, label-free detection methods have\nemerged as powerful tools for investigating dynamic cellular processes.\nTechniques such as electric cell–substrate impedance sensing, In our previous studies, we demonstrated the use\nof metal nanostructure-based\nSPR chips to investigate cellular activities under external stimuli,\nsuch as cytotoxic drugs   50 To overcome these\nlimitations, we employed injection molding technology\nto fabricate SPR chips with significantly improved uniformity compared\nwith those produced by hot-embossing methods. Additionally, we adopted\na simplified reflection-type SPR configuration, enabling the direct\nand stable detection of SPR dip signals. Within this framework, we\nintroduced a novel imaging contrast technique that captures spectral\nshifts at the SPR dip, allowing for a more robust and quantitative\nanalysis. To precisely evaluate the cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs,\nwe developed a self-referencing strategy based on time-resolved SPR\nimaging. This method involves capturing SPR images at three critical\nstages: (1) during initial cell seeding, (2) immediately after drug\nadministration, and (3) 24 h post-treatment. The resulting contrast\nimages are processed to extract spectral changes corresponding to\ncell adhesion strength. By tracking variations in cell attachment\nover time, we construct IC 50 Materials and Methods Fabrication\nof the 5 × 5 Gold-Coated Nanowire Array Sensors A 5\n× 5 array of 400 nm-period nanoridge structures, each\nwith an area of 5 mm × 5 mm, was fabricated on a Ni–Co\nmold using electron beam lithography followed by electroplating Figure Figure Figure S1a Figure Figure S1b Figure S1c Figure 1 Fabrication\nof the NAS biochip for the cell adhesion assay.

(d) Image of the 25-well NAS\nbiochip utilized for IC 50 Analysis of the Spectral Contrast Images When the sCMOS\ncamera captures RGB images of the NAS, each pixel is separated into\nthree distinct color channels: red (R), green (G), and blue (B). The\nnanostructure of the NAS is specifically designed such that its SPR\ndip resonance aligns with the boundary region between the R and G\nchannels, as illustrated in Figure  1 γ = ( ( IG + δ ) − ( IR + δ ) ) / ( IG + IR + 2 δ ) ∼ ( IG − IR ) / ( IG + IR ) 2 Cell\nadhesion assay utilizing the NAS chip.\n(a) Relevant spectra\nof the sCMOS camera and nanostructure sensor (black line) within the\nsystem.

Here, IR and IG represent\nthe intensity of the\nR channel and G\nchannel in the image, respectively, and δ is a noise factor.\nSince this noise term cancels out in the calculation, the resulting\nmeasurement exhibits a very low noise floorless than 10 –4 Figure Figure eq Figure Cell Adhesion Procedure Doxorubicin\n(DOX) and sorafenib\nwere purchased from Sigma-Merck (Germany). The human lung cancer cell\nline CL1-0 was obtained from Prof. Pan-Chyr Yang. 2 2 5 2 Cell Viability Assessment The cytotoxicity of the anticancer\ndrug was tested using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and dead/total cell\nstaining with PI/Hoechst fluorescent dyes. CCK-8 was purchased from\nDojindo, Japan. The cell staining analysis was performed by Core Facilities\nof Translational Medicine of BioTReC. The cytotoxicity of the anticancer\ndrug was plotted as cell viability versus drug concentration. IC 50 50 https://www.aatbio.com/tools/ic50-calculator Results Optic System\nand Analytical Methods When the SPR dip\nundergoes a red-shift due to an increased refractive index, the γ\nvalue rises. Conversely, a blue-shift of the SPR dip caused by a decreased\nrefractive index results in a lower γ value. To enhance detection\nsensitivity, it is essential to align the SPR dip within the boundary\nregion between the R and G channels of the camera’s quantum\nefficiency, ensuring that the γ value approaches zero. In Figure Figure Cell Adhesion and Refractive\nIndex Variation The kinetic\nchanges in the SPR imaging (SPRi) signal related to cell adhesion\nand detachment using the NAS biochip are shown in Figure S2a 0 a d eq Cell adhesion level ( % ) = ( ( γ d − γ a ) / ( γ a − γ 0 ) ) × 100 % 2 The dynamic changes\nin the NAS spectrum within the spectral contrast imaging system during\ncell adhesion evaluation are illustrated in Figure S2b Figure S2c Characterization\nof Cell Adhesion Assessment using NAS Biochip The effect\nof DOX on CL1-0 cells has been studied by using a real-time\nmonitoring assay, but quantitative analysis of cell adhesion levels\nat varying DOX concentrations remains unexamined. Figure S2d eq 0 a d eq Correlation of Cytotoxicity\nAssessment using CCK-8 and Cell\nAdhesion Assessment using NAS Biochip The NAS biochip effectively\nevaluates the impact of DOX on CL1-0 cell adhesion, although its ability\nto assess cell viability via adhesion levels remains unverified. NAS\nand CCK-8 were used to examine the effects of DOX on the adhesion\nand viability of CL1-0 cells. Four to five independent experiments\nwere conducted for both the CCK-8 assay and NAS test, with data on\ncell viability and adhesion percentages plotted against varying DOX\nconcentrations. Figure Figure 3 Effect of DOX on cell viability and adhesion tested by cell staining,\nCCK-8, and NAS in CL1-0 cells. (a) Results from CCK-8 and NAS were\nobtained in separate tests: cell viability was measured with CCK-8,\nand cell adhesion was quantified from eq Quantitative Analysis of Cytotoxic Effects\nof Anticancer Drugs\nusing CCK-8 and NAS Cytotoxicity was evaluated after 24 h\nof treating CL1-0 cells with DOX. Cell viability and adhesion levels\nin response to the indicated DOX concentrations were assessed. However,\ncomparing absolute cytotoxicity across methods was challenging due\nto the lack of numerical values. To address this, the IC 50 50 Figure 50 50 Figure Figure S3a and b 50 Figure S3c Figure S4 4 Effect of DOX on cell viability and adhesion converted\nby the IC50\ncalculator in CL1-0 cells. Cytotoxic effects of DOX on CL1-0 cells\nwere assessed using three assays: (a) CCK8, (b) cell staining for\ncell viability, and (c) NAS for cell adhesion. All plotted and fitted\ndata represent recalculated results obtained using the AAT Bioquest\nIC 50 50 The CCK-8 Assay Was Ineffective in Providing a Reliable Quantitative\nAnalysis of DOX Cytotoxicity in MCF-7 Cells In addition to\nlung and liver cancer cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells were also utilized\nto assess the cytotoxicity of DOX using three different methods: CCK-8,\nNAS, and cell staining assays. MCF-7 cells of similar density were\nseeded in 96-well plates for the CCK-8 assay and in 25-well biochips\nfor the NAS test. The regression curve derived from the cell adhesion\nanalysis closely matched the cell viability results obtained through\ncell staining ( Figure Figure 50 50 Figure 50 Figure Figure Figure 5 Effect\nof DOX on cell viability and adhesion in MCF-7 cells. The\ncytotoxic impact of DOX on MCF-7 cells was assessed using three assays:\n(a) NAS to evaluate cell adhesion, (b) cell staining, and (c) CCK-8\nassay to determine viability. Data from the NAS and cell staining\nassays were recalculated, plotted, and fitted to determine the IC 50 50 50 6 Effect\nof the cytotoxicity of DOX on MCF-7 cells. Cell\nmorphology\nimages of MCF-7 cells treated with DOX at indicated concentrations\ntested using (a) NAS and (b) CCK-8. In NAS and CCK-8 tests, at a concentration\nof 2.5 μM, significant changes in cell morphology occurred,\nand the intact cell monolayer was disrupted. In NAS assays, MCF-7\ncells exhibited noticeable morphological changessuch as cell\nrounding and loss of spreadingat DOX concentrations above\n2.5 μM, indicating pronounced cytotoxic effects. Similarly,\nin CCK-8 assays, reduced cell adhesion and spreading were observed\nat concentrations exceeding 2.5 μM, although the overall\ncytotoxicity appeared less severe compared to NAS results. The anticancer activity of DOX is well-established\nand attributed\nto its ability to intercalate into DNA, inhibit topoisomerase II,\ndisrupt mitochondrial function, and promote free radical generation\nand oxidative damage. 50 In the cell staining method, where MCF-7 cells were cultured\nin\n96-well plates like those used for the CCK-8 assay, IC 50 50 Conclusion This\nstudy validated the correlation between\ncell viability, as\nmeasured by CCK-8 and cell staining, and cell adhesion assessed using\nthe NAS biochip. The results demonstrated that cell adhesion measurements\nobtained with the NAS biochip are consistent with cell viability assays\nderived from conventional approaches, such as those utilizing CL1-0\ncells. This suggests that changes in cell morphology, like those observed\nin the NAS biochip assessments, can serve as unique indicators of\ncell viability. Similar to how cell membrane permeability is evaluated\nin cell staining and intracellular hydrogenase levels in CCK-8, cell\nadhesion provides another reliable parameter for viability testing. The effect of DOX on the adhesion of CL1-0 cells was quantified\nusing a NAS biochip, revealing its cytotoxicity through IC 50 50 The NAS biochip offers a straightforward\nand user-friendly procedure\nfor cell adhesion assessment. By capturing three sets of images, cell\nadhesion levels can be calculated using specialized software. Real-time\nmonitoring is also possible through continuous image capture. Additionally,\nsince reference images are used in calculations, there is no need\nfor a separate reference well, further simplifying the process. The\nlabel-free nature of the NAS biochip-based assessment also reduces\ncosts and saves time, enhancing its practicality. Table S1 The SPR imaging system utilized in this study introduces\nsignificant\nimprovements over traditional SPR systems by employing a fixed design\nthat eliminates the need for movable components, precise alignment,\nand complex mechanical structures. This allows the NAS biochip to\nbe used for discontinuous measurements at specific time points without\nsignificant errors. Measurements require the capture of cell images\nonly at three intervals, negating the need for additional reagents.\nThe biochip format is compatible with standard cell biology instruments\nand conventional well plates, ensuring easy integration into current\nworkflows. During drug cytotoxicity testing, the entire cell culture\nprocess is conducted in a conventional incubator, reducing artificial\nimpacts on the cells. Compared with transmissive SPRi platforms,\nthe reflective SPRi\nplatform used in this study minimizes the effect of sensor defects\non detection. Its reflective design allows light to penetrate the\ncell layer and nanogold layers before being reflected back to the\ncamera, ensuring reliable detection. Defects in nanogold layers constructed\nthrough plastic injection molding, which can reduce sensitivity in\ntransmissive systems, have less impact on the reflective platform.
