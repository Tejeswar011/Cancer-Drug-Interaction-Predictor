Due to the disruption of the blood brain barrier in neuro-oncological disease RGD-containing peptides are able to enter the brain at these local disruptions and bind to integrin receptors present in the neuro-oncological tissue. Theoretically this implies that imaging using RGD-containing peptides provide visualization of neuro-oncological lesions with very little background uptake and thus a high signal-to-background ratio (Yu et al. 2015 This review will focus on how the integration of findings from existing studies contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic performance of RGD-containing tracers, their specificity in binding to integrin receptors, the potential impact on delineating tumor boundaries and the evaluation of therapeutic response.

VEGFs are a family of mitogenic glycoproteins that promote angiogenesis by the activation of the VEGF receptor via a tyrosine kinase signaling pathway (Jubb and Harris 2010 64 p 64 89 2007 89 2011 89 2011 Possible impact in the clinical setting In the setting of discerning recurrence from treatment-related abnormalities in post-treatment glioblastoma patients, the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology working group has recommended the use of PET imaging (Albert et al. 2016 18 18 11 11 2020 2023 2009 2015 2015 3 Conclusion This review shows that RGD-targeted PET and SPECT imaging could be a promising tool for neuro-oncology as it provides new molecular information on the lesions. However, the specificity of RGD-tracers remains partially elusive and should therefore be studied further before RGD-targeted PET can be implemented in clinical practice. Radiopharmacodynamic, -kinetic and modelling studies in humans are much needed to bring this type of tracer further from bench to bedside in patients with neurooncological disorders.
