Because different factors drive health inequities and variables in measuring population science, relying on one metric for measuring progress may have limitations. Five principles (5Ps) are proposed for AIR globally that form the basis for a data-informed framework to measure and systematically define inclusive research to ensure rigor and benchmarking within organizations and across the broader sector. The first principle addresses biological, genetic, and population science considerations and their responsible use as data elements. The second principle pertains to using data to inform global region, country, and site placement, which includes geographical proportionality in trial enrollment, enabled access and commercialization strategies, and representative real-world demographic representation. The third principle is developing a data-informed and user-informed approach to end-to-end inclusive trial design. The fourth principle integrates patient-reported data collection standards and initiatives supporting complete and consistent clinical trial collection. The fifth principle enables trial access by demonstrating trustworthiness, improving patient navigation, and providing assistance programs. These 5Ps can be used as an end-to-end measurable framework using reference metrics, reproducible data, and methodologies for AIR in clinical development. Infographic available for this article.

However, this has been difficult to achieve and scale as advancing inclusive research requires metrics and systematized frameworks that have yet to be established. The 5 principles for advancing inclusive research framework standardizes processes by which inclusive research and clinical trials can be conducted in an organization. The 5 principles that form the basis for the framework are (1) population science (biological, genetic, demographic) considerations, (2) data-informed site placement for global and country-specific enrollment, (3) data-driven and user-informed inclusive trial design, (4) patient-reported data collection standards, and (5) enabling access to trials. Use of these 5 principles will allow for benchmarking, performance assessments, and integration of health equity and inclusive research at a population level.

Historically, this has not been accomplished for many reasons, including racial and gender biases, differential access to medical care, and varied enrollment in clinical trials across different populations, geographical regions, and countries [ 1 2 In clinical research, diversity, including representativeness, is prioritized through larger, additional studies on health disparities and government recommendations/legislation for inclusive research. However, standard metrics and systematized frameworks have yet to be established. These foundations are integral to ensure robust, transparent benchmarking and performance tracking over time. Practices were reviewed for how clinical study teams are currently embedding inclusive research concepts through their development program as well as qualitative feedback was received from US health systems, data warehouses, and advocacy groups that are engaged in clinical research to propose the 5 Principles (5Ps), a conceptualized framework designed to ensure a study is representative to the extent possible—based on data availability, operational constraints, and regulatory requirements—and adheres to biomedical ethical principles. This article is based on previously conducted studies and contains no new studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors. Principle 1: Population Science (Biological, Genetic, Demographic) Considerations The first principle anchors on the “ Who 1 The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) recommends the appropriate use of population descriptors in genetics and genomics research. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has updated guidelines to standardize race and ethnicity data collection in clinical studies [ 3 4 5 Disease burden should be measured by demographic-specific variables using standardized metrics, and by identifying demographic groups with granularity in geographical areas to enable precise benchmarking [ 6 9 1 2 3 10 11 Fig. 1 5P AIR framework for multiple myeloma.

AIR COPD eCRF HBV HCV HIV OMB SDOH SOGI Principle 2: Data-Informed Country and Site Placement Once the patient population (biology, genetics, demographics) with the disease is understood, Principle 2 anchors on “ Where 2 11 Global Trial Enrollment Not all countries have adequate infrastructure and expertise to conduct clinical trials. Therefore, established regional frameworks can be used to advance diverse trial enrollment globally. The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Guideline on General Principles for Planning and Design of Multi-Regional Clinical Trials (E17) provides a framework for multiregional clinical trials to support global development and regulatory approvals. It highlights that enrollment should be proportional to the geographical burden of disease, to maximize regional representativeness within operational constraints [ 12 Preferred sources, such as the US Cancer Statistics (USCS) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) Global Burden of Disease study, should be identified based on data quality, representativeness, and disease area coverage to provide epidemiology estimates at the indication or disease area level [ 6 8 9 13 To measure representativeness, Roche uses the participation-to-prevalence ratio by dividing the percentage of a particular population among the study participants (e.g., percentage of women among participants in a lung cancer trial) by the percentage of the particular population in the disease population (e.g., percentage of women in the USA with lung cancer). A range of 80–120% has been suggested as adequate representation, where each study should aim for zero error between these proportions [ 14 15 Country-Specific Enrollment Country-specific enrollment goals should adhere to standardized local requirements and frameworks. Diversity outside the USA cannot be captured or measured by US-specific demographic frameworks alone, such as the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB’s) standards on race and ethnicity [ 16 6 13 3 NCT05595642 Country-specific needs are also very different in LMICs versus high-income countries, and this framework may not be clearly defined. To have a global impact/implications, metrics need to be defined to assess gaps between epidemiological data and operational feasibility amongst countries. Building capability before clinical trials in partnership with local stakeholders (such as patient networks, non-governmental organizations, ministries of health, and community navigators) can help enable future clinical trial access and inclusive research, as was done with the Ghana Women’s Health Project [ 17 Site Selections Should Be Representative of the Real-World Population There are data-informed opportunities to ensure clinical trials are representative of real-world patient populations. Data sources such as the US Census, USCS, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, IHME, electronic health record-derived real-world data (e.g., TrinetX and Flatiron), and genomic databases are available for epidemiological estimates of US and global populations [ 18 22 23 Study site placements should also be based on operational capabilities, regulatory considerations, demographic data, and disease burden. Methods include using health systems, small area demographics, disease burden, and operational performance data to optimize representativeness and efficiency. Pre-site activation surveys can be coded with questions that assess the baseline state of sites’ advancing inclusive research (AIR) commitments and involvements and guide site selection decisions. This approach allows discrepancies in enrollment metrics to drive local insights and hypothesis generation. Following data-driven processes for site placement ensures that representative trials are not managed at the expense of efficiency and allows discrepancies in enrollment metrics to drive local insights and hypothesis generation. For instance, all else being equal in terms of population and disease burden data, a study site that enrolls slowly compared with a peer must have factors that may merit investigation, such as socioeconomic barriers that have yet to be identified, organizational limitations, or otherwise. If data suggest that a site takes more time to start up or is slow to enroll, one must uncover if it relates to site-based inefficiencies, such as less infrastructural support, or enrollment challenges with historically under-represented patients because of justified mistrust due to systemic racism or limited English proficiency. The former might be a site that would not be selected, the latter should be chosen and provided with appropriate resources, such as the Roche Site Academy, a sponsor program that offers core training to sites that are new to research and provides access to clinical trial equipment and inclusive research training for established sites [ 24 25 Even if not all countries have adequate infrastructure and expertise to conduct clinical trials, the aim is for enrollment to be proportional to the geographical burden of disease and to maximize regional representativeness within operational constraints. There is also the ethical obligation to only conduct clinical trials in countries with a path to regulatory approvals. To increase the operational capacity of LMIC countries to participate in clinical trials, and accounting for this later policy, Roche-Genentech developed a program called AIR Site Alliance in sub-Saharan Africa and India, intending to expand to other geographies. The AIR Site Alliance program enabled a significant increase in the number of clinical trials conducted in selected LMIC countries [ 26 Principle 3: End-to-End Inclusive Trial Design (Data-Driven and User-Informed) Principle 3 focuses on the “ What 1 3 27 28 Another critical aspect of AIR is to include input from providers, patient advocacy groups, and investigators, particularly those from diverse backgrounds, on the study design. When investigators, clinical research staff, and patients were asked for recommendations for future clinical study protocols, themes emerged that included: the use of lay terms in patient materials; allowing flexibility in protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria; incorporating flexibility for sites to enable the fastest decision(s) for patients; and show commitment to diversity in words and actions, such as including target enrollment goals and incorporating patient input on protocols [ 29 NCT05306340 2 1 3 Principle 4: Patient-Reported Data Collection Standards Principle 4 anchors on the “ Who individual patients Roche has developed a reconciliation of a standardized eCRF to FDA/OMB Race Categories (Supplemental Fig. 4 The collection of SDOH data is critical as this information can activate resources during the trial to address and resolve barriers to inclusive research and offer additional enrollment and trial support. The SDOH questionnaire was developed using a multistep collaborative approach that included a literature review, adaptation, feasibility assessment, and compliance checks as well as protocol and informed consent updates. The questionnaire captures patient- and area-level SDOH data, such as education, income, employment status, marital status, insurance status, and 5-digit zip code. Six Genentech-sponsored US clinical studies have the SDOH questionnaires in their protocols, including the evERA study (Supplemental Fig. 4 30 For SOGI data, despite recommendations by the National Institutes of Health, NASEM, and National Science and Technology Council, most clinical trials have not defined sex and gender, or there was inconsistent use of these terms [ 31 34 4 To ensure the appropriate terms are chosen and consistently collected across the clinical trial process, researchers should: (1) choose the most appropriate term for consistent use based on the objectives of the research, (2) ensure race, ethnicity, ancestry, sex, gender, and SDOH data are self-reported vs observer assigned, (3) obtain self-reported race, ethnicity, ancestry, sex, gender, and SDOH data at each assessment in prospective studies, (4) use self-reported ethnicity with genetic ancestry in genetic association studies, and (5) contextualize the clinical trial data in a manner that maximizes the benefit for all study participants, with careful considerations of any potential harms. A master informed consent form and data privacy agreements can be deployed that can be amended per local laws and government. There are country regulatory managers who review and amend language locally to meet local privacy laws and regulations. Similarly, for eCRF, there is a need to understand which countries will allow incorporation of patient data. Principle 5: Enabling Access to Trials Principle 5 anchors on the “ How 5 Enabling Access During Trials A critical component of AIR is demonstrating trustworthiness to participants, caregivers, and healthcare professionals so that they feel the motives of the clinical trial are beneficial and ethical for society. Participants also need to feel informed about the risks of the trial and participate voluntarily. Results from focus groups showed that willingness to participate in clinical research is in part due to how trustworthy a patient finds the researchers, the reputation of the institution and/or sponsor, and whether the researchers and institution or sponsor have previously conducted ethical and transparent research [ 35 36 The Clinical Trial Modernization Act has been proposed by the US Congress, with advocacy led by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, to address economic barriers that may prevent participation in clinical trials [ 37 38 1 2 3 39 40 2 Post-Trial Access and Patient Assistance Programs If patients have received treatment via participation in a clinical trial, they must still have access to it once the trial is completed, even while awaiting regulatory approval. These considerations are critical for patients who have life-threatening conditions that require continued administration of the treatment, and for patients who do not have appropriate treatment alternatives. The goal is to ensure that treatment is not interrupted between the completion of the clinical trial and drug commercialization. Each country participating in the clinical trial must also have the treatment available once approved. Post-trial patient assistance programs can help obtain medication, provide financial help with insurance premiums and co-pays, assist with diagnostic testing, provide travel assistance, provide caregiver respite, and provide disease education. These programs are available globally and are valuable in assisting those without health insurance and those who are underinsured to afford medications by either covering the full cost or providing a discount, per local regulations. Conclusions Inclusion and representation of all patient populations with disease globally are critical for responsible drug development, and meaningful improvement is predicated on the ability to measure progress. Precision medicine is fundamentally connected to inclusive research as it aims to target the right treatments to the right patients at the right time. Principle 1 starts with collecting a range of epidemiological, biological, genetic, and demographic data to understand a given disease’s prevalence, presentation, and potential outcomes in specific subpopulations. These data are accounted for in designing the protocols (Principle 3), to set the diversity enrollment goals (Principles 1 and 2), and to implement the studies in ways that will facilitate diverse patients’ participation (Principle 4), accounting for their different needs and preferences. At the end, the outcomes will be analyzed and reported for the different subpopulations defined in the diversity plan. While the sample size of a given study will often not be sufficient to answer all questions to target the right treatments to the right patients, the systematic framework provided by the 5Ps should contribute to precision medicine significantly by the totality of evidence it will bring to the development of new treatments. The framework, and specifically Principle 3, supports and enables innovative trial design. This principle is a two-dimensional approach. First, data-driven trial design is applied to expand eligibility criteria to enable more diverse patient recruitment: study designer tools using AI, leveraging a library of previous protocols, and applying dynamic eligibility criteria to impact real-world data sets are under development to become our new standard for designing protocols. The next aspect of the design is to challenge the type and schedule of assessments carefully and to use elements of pragmatic trials design to represent the diversity of clinical care better and facilitate patient enrollment and retention. Real-time monitoring of data on screening failures and real-time analysis of the demography of enrolled patients enable study teams to identify and correct study design limitations through additional support interventions (Principles 2, 3, and 5) or protocol amendments if needed. Second, user-informed trial design activates a process to ensure the needs of patients are met, such as collaboration with focus groups and patient councils to understand the patient voice during study design as well as during study conduct. The latter, with data monitoring, ensures the design is operational and efficient. The 5P AIR framework is intended to provide processes by which inclusive research can be conducted in an organization and adhere to regulatory requirements. Future frameworks may focus on real-world data principles for observational or interventional studies and to leverage real-world data as an engine for measuring impact and outcomes. The 5P framework advances the goal of ensuring life science research is inclusive, representative, and efficient. Establishing a framework for AIR requires demographic, biological, and access considerations, provider and patient advocacy feedback into protocol development, expanding race and ethnic subcategories, and SDOH data collection, all of which collectively can help achieve the best next steps in science to narrow health inequities and improve patient outcomes.
