A BSTRACT Background: The prevalence and healthcare burden of COPD are estimated to arise over the next years not only due to persistent tobacco consumption but also due to misdiagnosis of the disease. The present observational study among smokers and ex-smokers aims to assess the prevalence of COPD misdiagnosis (over and underdiagnosis) as well as the differences and similarities between patients with previous correct diagnosis of COPD and those with underdiagnosed disease. Materials and Methods: We performed an observational cross-sectional study in four rural counties and in one of the primary health centers of the metropolitan city of Thessaloniki, Greece aiming estimate the prevalence of COPD and evaluate the differences between patients with diagnosed and underdiagnosed disease. Results: Overall, 5,239 participants were enrolled in the study, of whom 565 subjects (10.8%) fulfilled the clinical and spirometric criteria for the diagnosis of COPD according to GOLD guidelines. Notably, 264 patients had a previous correct diagnosis of COPD (46.7%), 301 patients were underdiagnosed (new cases) while 461 subjects had a previous false diagnosis of COPD (overdiagnosis). Patients with underdiagnosed COPD were younger and more frequently current smokers. In addition, they presented less frequently with clinically important respiratory symptoms estimated by specific questionnaires but on the contrary the percentages of single symptoms such as cough, phlegm, dyspnea and wheezing were not significantly different compared with those with correct prior COPD diagnosis. They also reported fewer comorbidities and they mostly had early-stage disease based on spirometry or medical history. Conclusion: There is a noteworthy number of underdiagnosed and overdiagnosed cases of COPD among an unselected sample of the general population in northern Greece. Underdiagnosed patients with COPD are younger, usually current smokers but with early-stage disease compared with previously diagnosed subjects. National screening programs for high risk populations (current smokers with respiratory symptoms) in the primary care setting as well as GPs training on spirometry and COPD management should be planed as healthcare strategies in the near future.

Materials and Methods Study design We performed an observational cross-sectional study in four rural counties and in one of the primary health centers of the metropolitan city of Thessaloniki, Greece aiming to estimate the prevalence of COPD and evaluate the differences between patients with diagnosed and underdiagnosed disease. The study was conducted by pulmonologists from the Pulmonary Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and was supervised by the 3 rd rd All participants had a medical advice about the advantages of smoking cessation of 5-10 minutes and for those who were interested, an appointment in the smoking cessation clinic of G. Papanikolaou Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece was arranged. There was psychological and medical support for smoking cessation, free pass to public transportation to approach the hospital and a 24-hour support telephone line. Selection of study subjects – inclusion/exclusion criteria Eligible subjects were those aged 40 years or older, current or former smokers, with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years. Previous diagnosis of COPD, regular or occasional use of inhalers, or the persistence of respiratory symptoms were inclusion criteria. People who reported a history of other respiratory diseases such as bronchial asthma, bronchiectasis, lung cancer, tuberculosis, or interstitial lung disease, were excluded from the study. We excluded patients with asthma because in this case a clear indication for treatment with inhaled drugs may lead to normal spirometry, whereas the same scenario is compatible with COPD overdiagnosis. Data collection – measurements All participants of the study performed acceptable spirometry tests (according to the ERS/ATS official standards) before and 15–30 min after inhalation of 400 μg of salbutamol, under the supervision of a pulmonologist. Thereafter, pulmonary function test measurements were analyzed to determine whether the diagnosis of COPD could be established. In this case, each patient was further classified into GOLD A to E groups based on the mMRC dyspnea scale and CAT score, the number of exacerbations during the last year and their comorbidities. Variables and definitions Diagnosis of COPD was based on compatible symptoms plus post bronchodilation fixed cut-off ratio (FEV 1 1 1 1 Under-diagnosis was defined as the presence of clinical and spirometric criteria of COPD (present study) but no medical history of the disease. Conversely, over-diagnosis was defined as the presence of normal spirometry (pre and post FEV 1 1 We defined overtreatment as the prescription of any drug in participants without obstructive pattern and the prescription of an inappropriate combination of inhaled drugs in patients with COPD, according to the updated GOLD strategy document treatment guidelines. We used descriptive statistics to calculate COPD prevalence (previously correct and newly diagnosed cases) and the prevalence of false positive diagnosis. Parametric ( t Medical ethics All participants gave written informed consent and authorization to pulmonologists of the screening program to access the national electronic system and search for repeated prescribed inhaled drugs at least 12 consecutive months during the last 5 years. The study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Scientific and Medical Ethics Committee of “G. Papanikolaou” General Hospital in Thessaloniki. Results Overall, 5,239 participants were enrolled in the study, 3,206 (61.2%) were males. The median age of the participants was 57 years (IQR: 48-68), the median number of pack-years was 25 (IQR: 13-45) and the percentage of current smokers was 55.8%. A total of 565 subjects (10.8%) fulfilled the clinical and spirometric criteria for COPD according to the updated GOLD guidelines. Notably, 264 patients had a previous medical diagnosis of COPD (46.7% of COPD patients), 301 were underdiagnosed (new cases) while 461 subjects had a previous incorrect medical diagnosis of COPD (overdiagnosis).

Based on the severity of the disease, 196 (74.2%) of them should have been treated only with long-acting bronchodilators (GOLD A + B), whereas 187 patients (70.8%) were treated inadequately with short-acting bronchodilators or long-acting bronchodilators plus inhaled corticosteroids. On the contrary, 275/301 (91.4%) of underdiagnosed COPD patients had no regular prescription of inhaled drugs t and only 26 of them (8.6%) were treated occasionally by either short-acting inhaled bronchodilators or long-acting bronchodilators plus inhaled corticosteroids. Moreover, 458/461 (99.3%) of overdiagnosed COPD subjects had been prescribed inhaled medication, while the majority of them (319/461, 69.2%) used regularly long-acting bronchodilators plus inhaled corticosteroids. Individuals with overdiagnosis of COPD were urged to stop the inhaled treatment, while over or wrongly-treated patients with COPD switched to another drug. Comparison between patients with prior correct medical COPD diagnosis and those with an underdiagnosed disease was conducted to investigate the differences in COPD stages, respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function tests and the use of inhaled medication [ Table 2 Table 2 Comparison of clinical parameters and severity status between diagnosed and underdiagnosed COPD patients Parameters COPD prior correct diagnosis n COPD underdiagnosis n  P Age 72±10.48 62±10.89 P Gender (males) 226 (85,6%) 217 (72,1%) P BMI 28±4.99 27.75±5.07 P Current smokers 114 (43,2%) 204 (62,8%) P Pack-years 45±42.36 45±38.33 P>0.01 Pack-years (current) 45±34.23 51±35.93 P Pack-years (ex-smokers) 45.5±46.68 41±45.95 P Respiratory symptoms 1.

Almost half of them (301 participants, 53.3%) reported no prior medical diagnosis of COPD (under-diagnosed) while the majority of them (490 participants, 86.7%) were not treated as proposed by GOLD guidelines (either no treatment or false treatment). In addition, a significant number of subjects (461 individuals) reported a medical diagnosis of COPD without a compatible spirometric pattern and almost all of them (99.3%) had been prescribed inhalers either occasionally or on a daily basis (overtreatment). Patients with underdiagnosed COPD were younger, more frequently current smokers, with less severe disease and better preserved lung function. Strengths and limitations The strength of the present real-world study is the large number of participants and the alarming finding of underdiagnosed (untreated patients with clear indication to receive inhaled drugs) as well as overdiagnosed COPD (treated subjects with almost normal lung function). The main limitation of the study was the absence of randomization since more symptomatic subjects usually access this kind of screening programs. Underuse of spirometry in the primary care setting could explain the extremely high proportion of false positive COPD diagnosis (over-diagnosis), whereas all patients who had a previous correct COPD diagnosis had performed at least one spirometry test in the past. Interpretation of the study results in relation to existing literature According to the existing literature, proper diagnosis of COPD remains a challenge for physicians worldwide since a lot of individuals are still under or over-diagnosed.[ 12 13 14 15 16 Most studies refer to the underuse of spirometry as the main etiological factor of COPD underdiagnosis.[ 3 4 17 18 19 Accurate use and analysis of spirometry tests would also result in fewer cases of false diagnosis of COPD.[ 20 21 22 During the last two decades, several attempts have been made to assess the prevalence of COPD in the Greek population[ 10 23 24 24 25 26 Conclusion There is a noteworthy number of underdiagnosed and overdiagnosed cases of COPD among an unselected sample of the general population in northern Greece. Underdiagnosed patients with COPD are younger, usually current smokers but with early-stage disease compared with previously diagnosed subjects. GPs training, broad use of spirometry (screening programs for high risk populations) and web-based algorithms in everyday clinical practice, especially for current/ex-smokers with respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, phlegm, dyspnea, frequent use of antibiotics), would improve accuracy of diagnosis and lead to effective treatment strategies. The aim of national healthcare policies for COPD should be early and reliable diagnosis and management, smoking cessation and elimination of underdiagnosis, overdiagnosis and overtreatment.
