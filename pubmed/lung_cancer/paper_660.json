The emergence of non-cancer-related factors and time-dependent trends underscores the need for advanced analytical frameworks to unravel their complex interplay. Methods We analyzed the Pembro-real 5Y registry, a global real-world dataset of 1050 patients treated across 61 institutions in 14 countries with a long-term follow-up and a large panel of baseline variables. Two complementary approaches were employed: ridge regression, chosen for its ability to address multicollinearity while retaining interpretability, and not another imputation method (NAIM), a transformer-based artificial intelligence model designed to handle missing data without imputation. Endpoints included risk of death at 6, 12, 24, 60 months and 5-year survival. Results The ridge regression model achieved a c-statistic of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.72) for the risk of death and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.78) for 5-year survival, identifying Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS)≥2, increasing age, and metastatic burden as primary risk factors. However, wide CIs for some predictors highlighted statistical instability. NAIM demonstrated robust handling of missing data, with a c-index of 62.98±2.11 for risk of death and an AUC of 60.52±3.71 for 5-year survival. The comprehensive SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis revealed dynamic, time-dependent patterns, with early mortality dominated by acute factors (eg, ECOG-PS, steroids) and long-term outcomes increasingly influenced by systemic health markers (eg, absence of hypertension, increasing body mass index). Unexpected insights included the protective role of dyslipidemia (but not statins) and the nuanced impact of smoking status, reflecting evolving disease dynamics and host-tumor interplay. Conclusions Our integrative framework illuminates the complexity of long-term outcomes in patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab, uncovering dynamic, non-linear prognostication trends. This analysis provides insights into patient trajectories, emphasizing the need for holistic, long-term management strategies.

However, conventional models struggle to capture the long-term, time-dependent influence of host and non-cancer-related factors, and there is a need for innovative analytical frameworks that address data complexity and missingness in real-world settings. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS This study applies a novel integrative framework combining ridge regression and a transformer-based artificial intelligence (AI) model (not another imputation method) to analyze a large, global, real-world cohort of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with first-line pembrolizumab. It reveals that the prognostic relevance of clinical features evolves over time: while Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, steroid use, and metastatic burden dominate early mortality, long-term outcomes are more strongly influenced by systemic health indicators such as dyslipidemia, body mass index, and absence of cardiovascular disease. The AI model successfully handles missing data without imputation and uncovers dynamic, non-linear patterns not detected by traditional methods. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY This study supports a shift toward holistic, time-aware patient management strategies in immunotherapy-treated NSCLC. It emphasizes the need to integrate dynamic risk assessment tools into clinical practice and highlights the growing importance of systemic health and comorbidities in survivorship care. The findings also encourage future research to validate AI-based models and adopt explainable, real-world compatible methodologies in prognostication. Introduction The treatment landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has undergone a profound transformation with the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and targeted therapies. These advances have established unprecedented long-term survival outcomes, particularly in patients with oncogene-addicted tumors and those with high PD-L1 expression treated with ICIs. 1 2 3 5 6 7 This shift is leading the oncology community to a re-evaluation of traditional paradigms in the prognostication and management of patients with NSCLC. Historically, the expected survival of advanced-stage patients was limited to less than 1 year, 8 9 The interaction between host factors and tumor biology is particularly pronounced in the context of ICIs, which modulate the immune-tumor interplay. Factors linked to the metabolic status, 10 13 14 17 18 19 The Pembro-real 5Y is a comprehensive real-world, global, dataset derived from 61 institutions including patients with stage IV NSCLC with PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) of ≥50% treated with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy outside of clinical trials. 20 In this study, we propose an integrative approach to the Pembro 5Y dataset that combines conventional statistical models with advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-based methodologies. This dual framework aims to address the growing granularity of available clinical data by combining the traditional need for interpretable metrics with the modern imperative for dynamic risk stratification, leveraging conventional and AI-driven methodologies to uncover non-linear prognostic patterns that extend beyond traditional oncologic determinants. Methods Study design The objective of this study is to uncover novel insights into the risk of death and the determinants of 5-year survival in patients with advanced stage NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS ≥50% treated with first-line pembrolizumab, leveraging conventional and AI-driven methodologies. With this approach, we aim to delineate both expected and unexpected prognostic factors, offering a comprehensive understanding of patient trajectories and informing personalized strategies in this rapidly evolving field. The Pembro-real 5Y is a large real-world global dataset that includes 1050 patients with stage IV NSCLC and PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, treated with first-line pembrolizumab at 61 institutions across 14 countries and has already been reported in detail. 20 The 5-year survival rate, defined as the crude rate of patients alive at the 5-year mark from the treatment initiation date, and OS, defined as the time from treatment initiation to death or loss to follow-up, were selected as the clinical endpoints of interest. To address the complexity of the dataset, characterized by long-term follow-up, extensive baseline information with inherent collinearity, and significant missing data, we adopted a dual analytical approach: conventional statistical modeling using ridge regression and a transformer-based AI model. These methods were applied to the same panel of baseline variables (provided in the online supplemental methods 21 23 24 To further analyze the importance of the included variables in determining the risk of death over time, we used a graphical representation of the cumulative sum of the absolute contributions of the features across four pre-established time points: 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60 months. This approach aggregates the absolute SHAP values, allowing for the identification of feature importance independent of specific time points. Visualizing these cumulative sums allows us to assess which features consistently play a dominant role in influencing predictions throughout the observed period. This representation provides a comprehensive view of feature relevance, aiding in the interpretation of the model’s behavior and offering insights into the underlying clinical factors that drive survival outcomes. Statistical analysis We used descriptive statistics to report baseline clinicopathologic features of interest, assessing differential distribution through the χ 2 In the ridge regression analysis, given the substantial heterogeneity in missingness across the baseline variables (ranging from 1.4% to 89.6%), we opted for a pragmatic and reproducible strategy in the modeling phase. Specifically, categorical variables with residual missingness were retained with “unknown/not-tested” encoded as an explicit factor level. This allowed us to preserve the full analytic sample and avoid the introduction of uncertain or artificial imputations, particularly in variables where the proportion of missing data exceeded commonly accepted thresholds for reliable multiple imputation. This approach aligns with the real-world nature of the dataset, where data incompleteness may reflect systemic differences in clinical documentation, patient complexity, or diagnostic work-up and may carry independent prognostic information. Consequently, HRs reported for the “unknown/not-tested” levels in the regression models represent the impact of such data absence, rather than true biological strata. The extent of missingness for each baseline variable is detailed in table 1 Table 1 Patients’ characteristics of the overall cohort Overall study population Overall study population No 1050 (%) No 1050 (%) Age, (years) Baseline corticosteroids Median (range) 69 (31–92) None 845 (80.5) <10 mg pred 114 (10.8) ≥10 mg pred 91 (8.7) Sex Baseline proton pump inhibitors Female 422 (40.2) No 598 (57.0) Male 628 (59.8) Yes 400 (38.1)  Unknown 52 (5.0) Ethnicity Baseline antibiotics White 870 (82.9) No 943 (89.8) Black/African-American 31 (3.0) Yes 107 (10.2) Asian 29 (2.7)  Hispanic 9 (0.8)  Others 26 (2.5)  Unknown 85 (8.1)  WHO BMI category Baseline statins Obese 162 (15.4) No 681 (64.9) Overweight 286 (27.2) Yes 313 (29.8) Normal-weight 418 (39.8) Unknown 56 (5.3) Under-weight 41 (3.9)  Unknown 143 (13.7)  ECOG-PS Baseline metformin 0–1 859 (81.8) No 887 (84.5) ≥2 161 (15.3) Yes 124 (11.8) Unknown 30 (2.9) Unknown 39 (3.7) Histology Other glucose-lowering medications Squamous 238 (22.8) No 787 (75.0) Adenocarcinoma 768 (73.5) Yes 64 (6.1) Others/NOS 39 (3.7) Unknown 199 (19.0) Smoking status Hypertension Current smokers 280 (26.7) No 469 (44.7) Former smokers 660 (62.9) Yes 523 (49.8) Never smokers 95 (9.0) Unknown 58 (5.5) Unknown 15 (1.4)  PD-L1 TPS Myocardial infarction ≥90% 559 (53.2) No 858 (81.7) 50%–89% 281 (26.8) Yes 128 (12.2) Not specified 210 (20.0) Unknown 64 (6.1) CNS metastases Other cardiovascular conditions No 841 (80.1) No 715 (68.1) Yes 209 (19.9) Yes 271 (25.8)  Unknown 64 (6.1) Bone metastases Type 2 diabetes No 686 (65.3) No 809 (77.0) Yes 364 (34.7) Yes 177 (16.9)  Unknown 64 (6.1) Liver metastases Pulmonary disease No 885 (84.3) No 711 (67.7) Yes 165 (15.7) Yes 275 (26.2)  Unknown 64 (6.1) Lung metastases Dyslipidemia No 396 (37.7) No 666 (63.4) Yes 654 (62.3) Yes 314 (29.9)  Unknown 70 (6.7) Pleural metastases Autoimmune diseases No 787 (75.0) No 933 (88.9) Yes 263 (25.0) Yes 53 (5.0)  Unknown 64 (6.1) Adrenal glands metastases Other comorbidities No 839 (79.9) No 563 (53.6) Yes 211 (20.1) Yes 374 (35.6)  Unknown 113 (10.8) Other metastatic sites – – No 900 (85.7) – – Yes 150 (14.3) Number of metastatic sites – – ≤3 946 (90.1) – – >3 104 (9.9) EGFR mutation status – – No 890 (84.8) – – Yes 19 (1.8) Not-tested 141 (13.4) ALK translocation status – – No 883 (84.1) – – Yes 6 (0.6) Not-tested 161 (15.3) ROS-1 translocation status – – No 710 (67.6) – – Yes 9 (0.9) Not-tested 331 (31.5) KRAS mutation status – – No 367 (35.0) – – Yes 224 (21.3) Not-tested 459 (43.7) BRAF mutation status – – No 491 (46.8) – – Yes 26 (2.5) Not-tested 533 (50.7) Tumor mutational burden – – Non-high 92 (8.8) – – High 17 (1.6) Not-tested 941 (89.6) Missing values were reported as “unknown”, “not-specified” or “not-reported” as appropriate.

For the risk of death, a Cox proportional hazards model with ridge regularization was applied to manage multicollinearity and penalize large coefficients. Cross-validation was used to determine the optimal penalty parameter (λ), minimizing the partial likelihood deviance. Variables with non-zero coefficients were subsequently refitted into a standard Cox model to estimate HRs and 95% CIs. Model performance was evaluated using the concordance index (C-index). For the 5-year survival analysis, logistic ridge regression was employed on the same imputed datasets and covariates, with the binary outcome indicating survival at 5 years. Cross-validation identified the optimal λ, and selected variables were refitted into a logistic regression model to estimate ORs and 95% CIs. Model discrimination was assessed via the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and c-statistics. These analyses were performed using the R-studio software, R Core Team (2021). R: A language and environment for statistical computing implemented with the glmnet survival As previously described, the NAIM method is a transformer-based AI model that does not require imputation. Instead, it leverages a masked self-attention mechanism that allows the model to learn directly from partially observed data, using only the available features without artificially reconstructing missing values. Numerical features were normalized to (0,1), and categorical variables were encoded numerically. The first block of the model, called feature embedding, encoded these inputs as embeddings, which involves assigning trainable vectors to each possible clinical characteristic. At this stage, missing data were already addressed by assigning it a specific, non-trainable vector. Following this, the core of the model used masked self-attention to make predictions based exclusively on the available patient data. The analyses were performed using a fivefold cross-validation strategy, stratified on the target variable to maintain the same class proportions in the training and testing sets. The model, which is implemented in Python using the PyTorch library, was evaluated using various metrics, including AUC, accuracy, F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and G-mean, each of which captures a different aspect of predictive performance. Furthermore, in addition to the results obtained on the test samples, we report the training performance to assess the correlation between the target variable and the various features considered. SHAP values were then used to provide an interpretable measure of each variable’s contribution in defining clinical outcome and were visualized through summary plots. Features were ordered by their absolute contribution, with high values (red) and low values (blue) positioned to indicate their influence on outcomes. For instance, red dots on the right side of the plot imply a positive association with the outcome, while blue dots on the left suggest negative association. Missing values were represented as gray dots. Figure 1 Figure 1 Visual summary of the methodological pipeline used to analyze long-term outcomes of patients with advanced NSCLC (PD-L1 ≥50%) treated with first-line pembrolizumab in the Pembro-Real 5Y Registry. Two parallel approaches were adopted: Conventional modeling using penalized ridge regression for both 5-year survival (logistic) and overall survival (Cox), producing interpretable ORs and HRs with associated CIs, and model performance metrics (eg, C-statistic, AUC). NAIM (AI model) employing a transformer-based deep learning architecture to model time-dependent survival dynamics using SHAP values for feature interpretability and multiple performance metrics (AUC, F1-score, Matthews correlation coefficient [MCC], etc). Outputs were compared side-by-side. Shared predictors (eg, ECOG-PS, corticosteroid use) reinforced robustness, while NAIM identified additional time-sensitive or non-linear predictors (eg, BMI, dyslipidemia). This integrative approach supports both baseline prognostication and longitudinal survivorship strategies.

The NAIM model for risk of death, using all features, demonstrated a c-index of 62.98±2.11 on the training set and 61.24±2.15 on the all-feature evaluation set, indicating moderate predictive performance. While the training c-index suggests some degree of overfitting, the consistency between training and evaluation results reinforces the robustness of the model’s performance for this task.

Variables definition and categorization details are reported in online supplemental methods Discussion Our study is unique in its application of both conventional and advanced AI-based methodologies to a large, granular dataset with long-term follow-up, capable of capturing and describing unconventional and non-proportional baseline variable impacts over time. With one in three patients surviving beyond 5 years in the setting of NSCLC with PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, 5 7 Previous studies leveraging AI and machine learning in advanced NSCLC have predominantly focused on static baseline factors and short-term outcomes. 25 26 The AI-based NAIM model and ridge regression provide complementary approaches for analyzing clinical outcome; each method offers unique strengths and limitations, reflecting their distinct capabilities to address the complexity of real-world data: long-term follow-up, extensive baseline granularity, significant missing data, and variable collinearity. While ridge regression provides a static, interpretable estimate of the relative prognostic weight of each variable, the NAIM model allows for a dynamic view of how the relevance of individual features evolves over time. By combining these methods, we aimed to gain deeper insights into both static and dynamic predictors of patient outcomes, uncovering temporal trends and unexpected patterns that inform personalized management in the evolving oncology landscape. For instance, the prognostic relevance of ECOG-PS and corticosteroid use is well-established in the immunotherapy setting, the emergence of dyslipidemia and the absence of cardiovascular disease as features associated with long-term benefit is a novel observation. These findings may reflect underlying systemic resilience and deserve further validation across diverse therapeutic contexts. Ridge regression provides interpretable metrics essential for clinical translation. ECOG-PS≥2, increasing age, metastatic burden, exposure to steroids, and PPI were associated with the risk of death and inversely associated with the 5-year survival state. These findings align with the known impact of PS, age, and metastatic sites on prognosis. 9 27 28 The NAIM model provides insights into how prognostic factors influence outcomes not just at baseline, but at different time points during follow-up. This ability to capture temporal dynamics helps identify variables whose importance may increase, decrease, or shift over time, offering a more flexible and realistic understanding of patient trajectories under immunotherapy. The use of SHAP values offers a broader perspective by capturing the relative importance and directionality of variables across multiple predictions, unveiling non-proportional effects. However, the decreasing magnitude of SHAP values over time may indicate reduced model confidence or predictive ability at intermediate time points (12 and 24 months). This trend suggests that while the model effectively captures early predictors of mortality, its ability to sustain strong predictive insights diminishes as the follow-up period extends. NAIM confirmed several classical prognostic variables while revealing their time-dependent trends, such as ECOG-PS and steroid exposure. ECOG-PS≥2 emerged as the strongest determinant of mortality risk within the first 6 months but diminished over time. By contrast, patients with ECOG-PS 0–1 exhibited increased mortality at 12, 24, and 60 months, reflecting the early dominance of poor PS in acute settings. A similar trend was observed for steroids, strongly associated with early mortality but reversing direction over time. By 5 years, non-steroid exposure was associated with survival, suggesting a diminishing prognostic role as disease trajectories stabilize. Similarly, the presence of bone metastases was confirmed as one of the strongest determinants, following a time-dependent pattern as well. Initially strongly associated with early mortality, its relevance diminished over time, while the absence of bone metastases remained a significant determinant of the 5-year survival state. Interestingly, NAIM revealed that bone metastases were the most significant metastatic site influencing outcomes, while other sites such as liver or CNS metastases, or the overall burden of disease, played a less prominent role. NAIM also revealed unexpected patterns that differed from conventional expectations and underscored the unique capacity of the model to detect complex relationships. Before delving into technical details, it is worth noting that NAIM identified predictors whose prognostic importance evolved over time or emerged unexpectedly, such as cardiovascular health, metabolic factors, and smoking history. These findings suggest that some features gain relevance only at later stages of survivorship or through interactions not captured in traditional modeling frameworks. Unlike ridge regression, which retains increasing age as a significant prognostic factor, the NAIM analysis does not identify it as a relevant predictor over time. This discrepancy may stem from NAIM’s ability to account for collinearity, possibly allowing comorbidities to emerge as stronger determinants of long-term outcomes. Hypertension and the absence of other cardiovascular diseases gained disproportionate importance at 60 months, reflecting the cumulative impact of cardiovascular health on survivorship. Never-smokers and those without pulmonary disease were associated with increased mortality risk at 6 months, a finding linked to the historical association of smoking with good outcomes in immunotherapy due to inflammatory tumor microenvironments and higher TMB levels. 29 30 12 1531 32 Taken together, this integrative modeling approach enhances clinical interpretability by combining the transparency of traditional regression with the flexibility of deep learning, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of patient trajectories under immunotherapy. Concordant predictors across both models (eg, ECOG-PS, corticosteroid use, and tumor burden) can guide baseline risk stratification and treatment discussions, offering clinicians interpretable, stable markers for early decision-making. In parallel, time-varying signals captured only by NAIM (eg, BMI, dyslipidemia, or cardiovascular comorbidities) may inform longitudinal patient monitoring, survivorship planning, or tailored follow-up strategies as prognostic relevance shifts over time. Together, these complementary insights foster a layered interpretation of risk, supporting both immediate clinical action and long-term care strategies in a real-world setting. This study has several limitations. First, it is based on a retrospective, observational dataset, which may carry inherent confounding and selection biases. However, this design reflects the real-world clinical setting in which pembrolizumab is routinely administered to patients with advanced NSCLC and allowed the inclusion of a large, multinational population across 61 centers. To mitigate these biases, we employed rigorous statistical methods, including penalized regression, multivariable adjustment, and an AI-based framework designed to handle incomplete and non-linear data structures. Second, this study did not include a comparator arm treated with chemotherapy or targeted agents. This choice was deliberate: our aim was not to assess the relative efficacy of pembrolizumab but to characterize the time-varying impact of baseline clinical features within a homogeneous, real-world immunotherapy cohort. Including patients treated with alternative therapies would have introduced substantial clinical and molecular heterogeneity (eg, PD-L1-negative tumors, oncogene-addicted subtypes), thus reducing the internal validity of the predictive models. This rationale guided our cohort definition and is a key aspect of our study design. Missing data remain a pervasive challenge in real-world datasets, arising from various causes such as human error, non-response, or systematic loss. The NAIM model showed moderate predictive performance, with metrics such as c-index of 61.2, an AUC of 60.5–78.5 and low F1-score and MCC values, reflecting a degree of overfitting and limited generalizability. These findings underscore the need for further validation and potential refinement before clinical application. Future studies should validate these findings in external datasets with more complete and diverse representation. Despite the mentioned limitations, the nuanced, time-dependent insights revealed by the AI-based NAIM model complement the static interpretability of ridge regression, together providing a robust framework for understanding the interplay of oncologic, systemic, and temporal factors. Over the course of a 5-year follow-up, the risk of death in patients with NSCLC treated with immunotherapy evolves to increasingly include non-cancer-related factors. This shift underscores the growing importance of systemic health and holistic care in the survivorship phase. With nearly one-third of patients surviving beyond 5 years in this setting, modern oncology must adopt comprehensive management strategies that address comorbidities, support metabolic and nutritional health, and incorporate time-sensitive interventions.
