Although the vasculature has been recognized as a main player in this disease, the recently found capillary heterogeneity and cellular dynamics of endothelial subpopulations in BPD remain unclear. Here, we showed that Cap2 cells were damaged during neonatal hyperoxic injury, leading to their replacement by Cap1 cells, which, in turn, significantly declined. Single-cell RNA-Seq identified the activation of numerous p53 target genes in endothelial cells (ECs), including Cdkn1a p21 p53 p53 p53  Premature babies with bronchopulmonary dysplasia suffer from lung damage. Our study shows how vascular cells and genes play a role in repairing this damage, offering potential treatments.

To investigate how neonatal hyperoxia disrupts the lung vasculature, we exposed newborn mouse pups to either hyperoxia (80% O 2 2 Figure 1A 2 10 12 Supplemental Figure 1 https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.182880DS1 To better understand the timing of Cap1/Cap2-specific injury in this model, we conducted immunostaining at various time points, including 3, 7, and 14 days after hyperoxia ( Figure 1, A–D Figure 1, B and E Figure 1, C and E Figure 1, C and E Figure 1, D and E Figure 1, C and D Supplemental Figure 1C In patients with BPD, male newborns have shown worse outcomes compared with female newborns ( 13 3 13 14 Supplemental Figure 1D Cap2 cells are damaged upon hyperoxia and replaced by Cap1 cells, exacerbating Cap1 cell loss.

Notably, within the BPD+PH samples, ECs exhibit an aberrant capillary cell state (abCap) characterized by a loss of hallmark marker genes that define both Cap1 and Cap2 cells ( 54 Figure 8, A and B Figure 8C Figure 8, D and E Discussion In this study, we demonstrated that neonatal hyperoxia targets Cap2 cells, leading to their demise and subsequent replacement by Cap1 cells, resulting in Cap1 cell depletion and contributing to the vascular rarefaction seen in a mouse model of BPD. Our findings also highlight the pivotal role of the p53 pathway in orchestrating EC regeneration and Cap2 specification during hyperoxic injury-repair. Through global deletion of p53 p53 p53 p53 Our work contributes to the growing body of literature elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying BPD pathogenesis. By delineating the cellular dynamics of EC subpopulations and the p53 pathway in vascular injury and repair, we believe we provide novel insights that could inform the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for BPD. Although it has not been tested, it is possible that ablating the p53 pathway in the endothelium could promote vascular resiliency and recovery for both the vasculature and alveolar epithelium in cases of severe BPD. Moreover, the identification of the transitional EC state expands our understanding of the cellular heterogeneity within the pulmonary vasculature, drawing remarkable comparisons to lung epithelial regeneration and repair. Analogous to the lung epithelium, where damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs) have been characterized, our study highlights the functional significance of Cap1 cells as endothelial stem-like cells in injury contexts, akin to the role of AT2 cells in epithelial repair ( 26 28 26 28 p53 55 While our study provides compelling evidence for the involvement of the p53 pathway in the vascular phenotype of BPD, further studies are warranted to investigate the precise mechanisms by which p53 Additionally, further experiments are needed to better understand the injury mechanism of oxygen and activation of p53 p53 21 22 56 57 58 p53 p53 59 In conclusion, our findings underscore the importance of EC heterogeneity and p53 Methods Sex as a biological variable.

Prompts included requests to highlight suggested changes, evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the discussion, identify unclear concepts, and propose introduction and discussion outlines based on results. Additionally, ChatGPT was used to troubleshoot coding related to CellChat with Seurat 5, specifically to clarify library requirements and interpret a single error message. Statistics. For each quantification, the mean was calculated using at least 2, but typically 3–5, representative images from a single lung. A sample size of at least 3 lungs was obtained for each condition. The means were compared across conditions, and statistical testing was performed to determine significance.
