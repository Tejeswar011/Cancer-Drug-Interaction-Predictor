Understanding the comorbidities among psychiatric disorders, chronic low-back pain, and spinal degenerative disease using observational and genetically informed analyses 4 3 2025 2025.02.28.25323099 medRxiv PMC11908311 40093242 Background Psychiatric disorders and symptoms are associated with differences in pain perception and sensitivity. These differences can have important implications in treating spinal degenerative disease (SDD) and chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods Leveraging UK Biobank (UKB) ( n n Results When we compared individuals affected only by SDD, those affected only by CLBP, and those affected by both conditions with control participants, observational and genetically informed analyses highlighted that the strongest effects across the 3 case groups were observed for alcohol use disorder, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Additionally, schizophrenia and its polygenic risk score appeared to have an inverse relationship with CLBP, SDD, and their comorbidity. One-sample MR highlighted a potential direct effect of internalizing disorders on the outcomes investigated that was particularly strong on SDD. Our drug repurposing analyses identified histone deacetylase inhibitors as targeting molecular pathways shared by psychiatric disorders, SDD, and CLBP. Conclusions These findings support that the comorbidity among psychiatric disorders, SDD, and CLBP is due to the contribution of direct effects and shared biology linking these health outcomes. These pleiotropic mechanisms, together with sociocultural factors, play a key role in shaping the SDD-CLBP comorbidity patterns that have been observed across the psychopathology spectrum.

Understanding these dynamics has the potential to enable personalized and rational selection from among the myriad behavioral, pharmacological, integrative, and surgical treatment approaches to CLBP ( 2 Methods and Materials Study Design and Participants In this study, we explored the associations between psychiatric disorders, SDD, and CLBP using data from the UK Biobank (UKB) ( 20 21 Figure 1 Figure 1 Study overview. ADHD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; AUD, alcohol use disorder; BD, bipolar disorder; CLBP, chronic low back pain; CUD, cannabis use disorder; MR, Mendelian randomization; OUD, opioid use disorder; PRS, polygenic risk score; PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder; SCZ, schizophrenia; SDD, spinal degenerative disease. Phenotyping We investigated the following psychiatric disorders in this study: alcohol use disorder (AUD), anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder (BD), cannabis use disorder (CUD), depression, opioid use disorder (OUD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and schizophrenia (SCZ). In the UKB, psychiatric disorders were assessed using first occurrence data, which combined information from primary care records, hospital admission records, death register records, and self-reported surveys ( 20 21 22 Table S1 To define CLBP and SDD outcomes, we used UKB EHRs available from primary and secondary diagnoses, medication records, and procedure records. In the AoU cohort, CLBP and SDD were identified using EHR data standardized by the OMOP CDM. For CLBP, participants were identified based on ICD-10 codes M54.3 through M54.5, which pertain to dorsalgia. For SDD, identification was based on both diagnoses and operation records. Specifically, diagnoses included various ICD-10 codes such as spondylosis (M47), as well as ICD-9 codes including spinal stenosis (720), spondylosis and allied disorders (721), and several others related to disc disorders and spinal curvature. Operative procedures were coded according to the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of Interventions and Procedures, version 4 (OPCS4). Relevant procedures included primary microdiscectomy of the lumbar intervertebral disc (V33.7), primary posterior laminectomy decompression of the lumbar spine (V25.4), and various other specified and unspecified decompression and excision operations related to both the lumbar and cervical spines. Injection procedures, such as therapeutic lumbar epidural injections (A52.1) and radiofrequency-controlled thermal denervation of spinal facet joints (V48.5), were also included as part of the identification for SDD. To define CLBP and SDD, we excluded participants affected by medical conditions and treatments that could present similar symptoms due to different pathophysiological processes ( Table S1 The detailed definitions and specific codes used for CLBP and SDD phenotyping are provided in Table S1 Information regarding sex, age, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI) was also extracted from the UKB and AoU ( Table S1 2 9 Genetic Data Genome-wide data from previous large-scale studies were used to further investigate the genetic effects linking psychiatric disorders to CLBP and SDD. To avoid sample overlap bias in the polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses, we investigated genome-wide association studies (GWASs) that did not include the UKB cohort or the AoU cohort. Because of the limited sample size available for other ancestry groups, we used genome-wide data generated from individuals of European (EUR) descent. Specifically, genome-wide data related to SCZ ( 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 These genome-wide association statistics were integrated with individual-level genetic data from the UKB and AoU ( Figure S1 33 34 35 p −6 Statistical Analyses To investigate the associations between psychiatric disorders, CLBP, and SDD, we conducted multinomial logistic regression analysis on phenotypic data from the UKB and AoU. Specifically, we tested psychiatric disorders by comparing CLBP+SDD cases, CLBP-only cases, and SDD-only cases with controls. To maximize UKB and AoU sample size, we considered psychiatric disorders with at least 100 cases in each of the CLBP and SDD categories ( Table S2 2 p z As mentioned above, genetic analyses were performed only in individuals of EUR descent because of the lack of large-scale samples informative of other population groups. Leveraging large-scale GWASs of psychiatric disorders, PRSs were estimated using the PRS–continuous shrinkage (PRS-CS) method ( 36 37 36 The associations between psychiatric PRSs and the outcomes were assessed using multinomial logistic regression analysis, with the psychiatric PRS as the independent variable and CLBP and SDD as the outcomes. Initially, we tested the 9 psychiatric PRSs in the model separately. Subsequently, we conducted a multivariable analysis in which we entered the 9 psychiatric PRSs into the same regression model. In these analyses, we used age, sex, and the top 10 within-ancestry principal components (PCs) as covariates. We conducted additional analyses in which we added smoking status and BMI to the initial set of covariates. By comparing PRS results derived from the cross-disorder GWAS to those from the disorder-specific GWASs, we also assessed whether cross-disorder shared polygenic component showed a distinct association pattern with CLBP and SDD. To further investigate the associations among psychiatric disorders, CLBP, and SDD, we performed one-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) ( 38 39 p 38 To investigate the biological mechanisms that underlie the association of psychiatric PRSs with CLBP and SDD, PRSet enrichment analysis was performed testing 10,542 gene ontology (GO) terms available from the Molecular Signatures Database using PRSice-2 ( 40 41 r 2 p −6 Next, a drug repurposing analysis was performed using the Gene2drug approach ( 42 43 44 Results Observational Analyses A total of 402,072 UKB participants and 157,415 AoU participants were available for the observational analyses. Because of the large sample size available, we observed statistically significant differences in the characteristics of the participants enrolled in these cohorts ( Table 1 Table 1 Table S2 Table 1 Characteristics of Participants Available From the UKB and the AoU Characteristics UKB, n AoU, n p Sex Female 216,602 (54%) 96,480 (61%) <.001 Male 185,470 (46%) 60,935 (39%) Age, Years 56.4 ± 8.1 48.5 ± 16.0 .018 BMI 27.3 ± 4.7 29.6 ± 7.5 .007 Ever Smoked Yes 176,887 (44%) 50,671 (32%) <.001 No 225,185 (56%) 106,744 (68%) Ancestry Admixed American 884 (<1%) 28,064 (18%) <.001 African 6019 (2%) 36,478 (23%) Central/South Asian 7768 (2%) 2148 (1%) East Asian 2565 (<1%) 3581 (2%) European 383,414 (95%) 86,523 (55%) Middle Eastern 1422 (<1%) 621 (<1%) Psychiatric Disorders AUD 9950 (3%) 8415 (5%) <.001 Anxiety 33,673 (8%) 34,080 (22%) ADHD 60 (<1%) 4144 (3%) BD 1930 (<1%) 6984 (4%) CUD 284 (<1%) 3100 (2%) Depression 47,623 (12%) 26,417 (17%) OUD 290 (<1%) 3580 (2%) PTSD 7580 (2%) 5826 (4%) SCZ 7116 (2%) 2293 (2%) Outcomes CLBP+SDD 11,469 (3%) 13,451 (9%) <.001 CLBP only 15,496 (4%) 23,325 (15%) SDD only 37,745 (9%) 3477 (2%) Control 337,362 (84%) 117,162 (74%) Values are presented as n ADHD, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; AoU, All of Us Research Program; AUD, alcohol use disorder; BD, bipolar disorder; BMI, body mass index; CLBP, chronic low back pain; CUD, cannabis use disorder; OUD, opioid use disorder; PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder; SCZ, schizophrenia; SDD, spinal degenerative disease; UKB, UK Biobank. In the UKB, anxiety, AUD, depression, and PTSD were associated with increased CLBP+SDD, CLBP-only, and SDD-only case status after Bonferroni correction in both the age-sex model and the fully adjusted model ( p Figure 2 Table S3 p Table S4 Figure 2 Table S3 Table S4 Table S4 Figure 2 Table S4 p −4 p −24 p −25 p −18 Figure 2 Table S4 Figure 2 Association of psychiatric diagnoses with comorbidity combinations between CLBP and SDD in the UKB (left panel) and AoU (right panel).

Additionally, UKB-PTSD was associated with increased CLBP/SDD case definitions, while AoU-PTSD was inversely related to SDD-only ( Figure 2 Figure 2 We also conducted ancestry-stratified analysis in both the UKB and AoU samples. While most ancestry-specific associations were consistent with the ones observed in the cross-ancestry analyses ( Table S5 Table S6 p −4 To evaluate the robustness of our results with respect to the phenotyping approach used, we conducted 2 sensitivity analyses. When considering radicular versus nonradicular pain, no differences were observed in their association with psychiatric disorders, with the only exception being PTSD ( Table S3 Table S3 Polygenic Risk Scoring In the UKB (325,975 unrelated participants of EUR descent), AUD, anxiety, ADHD, CUD, depression, OUD, and PTSD PRSs showed Bonferroni-significant associations ( p Figure 3 Table S7 p Figure 3 Table S8 Table S9 Figure 3 Associations of psychiatric PRSs with comorbidity combinations between CLBP and SDD in the UKB (upper panel) and AoU (lower panel).

Bonferroni-significant associations ( p Tables S8 S9 Because of the limited sample size available in the AoU (48,994 unrelated AoU participants of EUR descent), we observed a reduced number of Bonferroni-significant PRS associations ( Table S7 p Table S7 Table S8 Compared with disorder-specific PRSs, the cross-disorder PRS showed an association with increased CLBP+SDD, CLBP-only, and SDD-only case status in the UKB ( Table S7 Table S7 One-Sample MR In the UKB, our one-sample MR analysis highlighted Bonferroni-significant causal effects ( p Figure 4 Table S10 Figure 4 One-sample Mendelian randomization linking psychiatric disorders to comorbidity patterns between CLBP and SDD in the UKB (left panel) and AoU (right panel).

Multiple studies highlighted the bidirectional relationship between mental illnesses and pain-related outcomes ( 9 10 45 46 47 45 48 49 Table 1 Among the mental illnesses we investigated, internalizing disorders (anxiety, depression, and PTSD) showed the strongest associations with CLBP and SDD in both the UKB and AoU cohorts. In the observational analyses in the UKB, anxiety and depression were more strongly associated with CLBP+SDD, while PTSD was more strongly associated with CLBP-only than CLBP+SDD. AoU observational analysis confirmed the stronger association of anxiety and depression with CLBP+SDD but highlighted a different pattern for PTSD. PTSD was associated with increased CLBP+SDD and decreased SDD-only, with the relationship with CLBP-only not surviving multiple testing correction. The PTSD difference between the UKB and AoU results may be due to how this disorder is differentially recorded in these health care systems. For example, previous UK survey statistics have highlighted potential barriers, with 1 in 8 of those who screened positive for PTSD having been diagnosed by a health professional ( 50 51 52 53 n 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 Comparing the effect sizes observed in observational, PRS, and one-sample MR analyses, it appears that direct effects of internalizing disorders and their genetic risk cannot fully explain their associations with CLBP/SDD case definitions. Our pathway-based analyses highlighted several biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components shared between psychiatric disorders and CLBP/SDD case definitions. For depression, we identified 5 GO terms that were significant after Bonferroni correction in both the UKB and AoU. Three of them (i.e., “positive regulation of immune system process,” “chemical homeostasis,” and “positive regulation of cell activation”) were related to immune systems and regulatory processes. These results are consistent with transcriptomic and observational evidence suggesting that modulation of immune responses influences the development of chronic back pain ( 61 62 63 64 65 19 66 67 68 The drug repurposing analysis identified compounds that target the shared pathways that link depression to CLBP and SDD. Among the ones replicated across the 2 cohorts investigated, fisetin (a naturally occurring flavonoid) has shown evidence of neuroprotective, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties ( 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 Beyond internalizing disorders, we also observed the effect of AUD and its genetic risk on increasing CLBP and SDD, with differences across the 3 case definitions being less evident than the ones described above. These findings are consistent with previous studies that reported on how alcohol misuse can increase back pain ( 46 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 In both the UKB and AoU, we also observed a SCZ-specific pattern of associations. Specifically, SCZ was inversely related to CLBP/SDD case definitions. In the observational analysis, this inverse relationship was nominally significant but reached multiple testing correction in some ancestry groups (i.e., Central/South Asian and Admixed Americans) ( Table S5 85 85 86 14 87 88 While our findings expand the understanding of the impact of mental health on CLBP and SDD, we must acknowledge several limitations. First, while bidirectional relationships of CLBP and SDD with psychiatric disorders have been reported previously ( 9 44 Conclusions The current study opens new directions in CLBP and SDD research, emphasizing the importance of investigating them in the context of mental health. Additionally, because of the direct effect and shared pathogenesis observed, our findings indicate that it may be clinically useful to screen psychiatric comorbidities to understand the dynamics that underlie CLBP/SDD comorbidity patterns. Importantly, we observed that minorities and sociocultural context may differentiate CLBP/SDD-related outcomes. Further studies are needed to follow up on this initial evidence. Similarly, our drug repurposing analyses highlighted potential molecular targets that may be useful to identify therapeutics that simultaneously target the biological systems that underlie the pathogenesis shared among psychiatric disorders, CLBP, and SDD.
