We investigated whether direct health care costs differ substantially between self-reported tobacco smokers and non-smokers. Methods This systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Medline PubMed, Embase, PubMed Central, and Scopus were searched to identify studies of direct health care costs between smokers and non-smokers for participants aged ≥18 years. All observational, prospective, retrospective, and non-randomized comparative studies were considered. Data extraction included mean annual health care costs (± SD) for both groups. Mean differences (MD) in annual health care costs between smokers and non-smokers, expressed in 2025 US dollars, were compared and adjusted for a 12-month period and inflated to 2025 using consumer price indices. Results Of 873 studies identified, 11 were included in quantitative synthesis, which compared 19,759,529 smokers with 206,913,108 non-smokers for direct health care costs. Mean age ranged from 34.5–60.6 years for smokers and 34.3–65.1 years for non-smokers. Mean annual health care costs ranged from $65,640–$1297.1 for smokers and $54,564–$724.4 for non-smokers. Annual incremental direct health care costs for smokers versus non-smokers ranged from –$458 (95% CI [confidence interval]: –2011.0 to 1,095.0) to $11,076 (95% CI: 10,211.9 to 11,940.1) in 2025 US dollars. Meta-analysis revealed smoking generally incurred greater health care costs than non-smoking, with a mean annual incremental cost of $1916.5 (95% CI: –439.9 to 4,272.9). The result was not statistically significant (MD = 1,916.5; p I 2 p I 2 Conclusion This meta-analysis supports the assertion that smoking substantially increases direct health care costs compared with non-smoking, particularly for the general population.

The included studies were conducted in the US, Finland, Germany, Japan, Canada, Jordan, Belgium, Iran, and Spain. Our review included eight retrospective studies and three prospective studies. Of the included studies, seven were population-based, and four were conducted in a hospital setting. A total of 19,759,529 participants in the smoker group and 206,913,108 in the non-smoker group were analyzed.

Of the 11 included studies, 9 were meta-analyzed, because 2 did not have report standard deviations of the mean annual costs. The meta-analysis indicated that, generally, smoking incurred greater health care costs compared with non-smokers. The mean annual incremental cost of smoking was $1916.50 (95% CI: –439.9 to 4272.9) in 2025 US dollars. However, a statistically non-significant difference was observed (MD = 1916.5; p 2 Fig. 2 Direct health care costs between smokers and non-smokers A substantial heterogeneity was observed ( I 2 14 15 19 p I 2 Risk of Bias Assessment Studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment tool.

Beyond its undeniable and well-established health consequences, smoking also places a significant economic burden on health care systems and economics [ 23 This review synthesized evidence from studies conducted during the past 25 years that examined direct 14 In contrast to the findings of Isaranuwatchai et al. [ 14 12 22 15 The synthesis of studies in this review revealed considerable study heterogeneity, which can be attributed to several key factors. First, the review encompassed studies from both non-diseased general populations and hospitalized patient groups, introducing variability in health care costs as a result of differences in the severity of health conditions. Second, the studies were conducted in different countries, each with distinct health care systems and varying degrees of health care expenditure, further contributing to the observed heterogeneity. While this diversity in study design and contextual factors may have complicated direct comparisons, the findings nonetheless carry important implications for tobacco control policy. They underscore the need to strengthen smoking cessation programs, highlighting the potential for significant reductions in both health care costs and broader economic burdens across different population groups. On the other hand, the considerable heterogeneity of studies, attributable to differences in study populations (non-diseased vs. hospitalized patients), country-specific health systems, and baseline degrees of health care expenditure, also strengthened the relevance of the findings across various contexts. Notably, a sensitivity analysis excluding studies focused on patients with chronic diseases yielded somewhat lower incremental costs, but still demonstrated a significant excess economic burden for smokers. This supports the generalizability of our conclusions beyond specialized clinical populations to broader community settings. While a few studies have reported greater health care costs for former smokers compared with both current smokers and non-smokers [ 20 22 In addition, a key limitation of this review was its exclusive focus on direct health care expenditures, without accounting for the indirect costs—such as lost productivity or reduced health-related quality of life. These are integral to the overall economic impact of smoking. This study deliberately concentrated on direct health care costs to maintain a clear scope aligned with payer interests. Expanding future studies to include these indirect costs would offer a more complete picture of the financial burden of smoking. Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis provides robust evidence that smokers incur significantly greater direct health care costs compared with non-smokers, with the economic burden further exacerbated for individuals with chronic diseases. Despite observed heterogeneity in the studies included, the findings consistently highlight the substantial health care expenditures associated with smoking and reinforce the need for comprehensive tobacco control policies. However, limitations such as the exclusion of former smokers and the focus solely on direct health care costs suggest that future research should expand to include a broader range of economic factors, including indirect costs and the health care expenditures of former smokers. Ultimately, strengthening smoking cessation programs and promoting policies that reduce smoking prevalence could lead to substantial long-term savings and improve public health outcomes.
