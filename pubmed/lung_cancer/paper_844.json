In the context of a clinical trial designed to deliver a standardized patient navigation protocol, a registry was needed to allow users from across multiple health systems to input patient data, track navigation outreach, and coordinate cancer care in real time. To design a registry to allow patient navigators (PNs) at 6 medical centers across 4 health systems to track breast cancer patients determined to be most at risk for delays in treatment. Materials and Methods A multi-disciplinary team chose REDCap to host the registry. The aim was to develop a platform that would (1) manage a caseload of patients who are most vulnerable for delays; (2) track patients through the continuum of cancer care in real time; (3) allow PNs to prioritize certain patients; (4) facilitate inter-system communication; and (5) allow the research team to monitor navigators’ activities (in context of a research study, for supervision and feedback). Results The registry was built through collaboration with clinical providers, PNs, informatics specialists, and expert developers from the REDCap team, using the software standard features and incorporating additional functionality using SAS programming. Conclusion REDCap provided an accessible and modifiable platform for hosting a registry to track patients in real time. However, it did not streamline PNs’ workflows or reduce data entry burdens as intended. A major barrier was the lack of interoperability with pre-existing systems navigators use, which led to redundancy and increased the burden of documentation. registry breast cancer disparities REDCap National Institutes of Health (NIH)/National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) U01 TR002070 UL1TR000170 UL1TR002544 UL1TR001453 UL1TR001430 NIH 10.13039/100000002 NCATS 10.13039/100006108 American Cancer Society 10.13039/100000048 # CRP-17-112-06-COUN NIH 10.13039/100000002 National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) 5K12AR084217 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Breast cancer disparities at a regional level have been well documented, including in Boston, MA. 1 1 , 2 3 , 4 5–7 “Translating Research into Practice” (TRIP NCATS 1 U01 TR002070) was a multi-site, hybrid implementation-effectiveness research study that aimed to reduce disparities and improve the delivery of timely, quality breast cancer care among patients at risk for delays in Boston through a coordinated care delivery model. 8 9 2 10 The Massachusetts Cancer Registry 11 8 12 , 13 Objective The goal of this article is to describe the build and use of a registry that would allow PNs at 5 medical centers across 4 health systems to track breast cancer patients who were determined to be most at risk for delays in treatment in real time and intervene to prevent delays. Four of the sites were tertiary, academic medical centers, while the fifth was a community hospital, all located in the greater Boston metro area. The registry was designed to (1) manage a caseload of patients who are most vulnerable for delays; (2) track patients through the continuum of cancer care in real time; (3) allow PNs to see which patients to prioritize; (4) facilitate inter-system communication for care teams; and (5) monitor navigators’ activities (in the context of a research study, for supervision and feedback). Methods After a review of existing platforms, software, and systems, the study team decided to build the registry using REDCap. REDCap 14 A TRIP navigation protocol was designed by the study team to reflect evidence-based best practices for breast cancer navigation. 2 required First, PNs were asked to enter patients potentially eligible for standardized navigation services. Potential patients were identified using different methods at each site (running reports in the EMR, coordinating with nurses after tumor board, etc) REDCap would then indicate to users whether or not the patient was TRIP eligible. If the patient was TRIP eligible, PNs were supposed to conduct an initial social needs screening within 30 days of the date of diagnosis. If social needs (lack of transportation, food insecurity) were identified, navigators were to document those needs and refer the patient to resources, either directly or through a social worker or patient resource specialist, depending on the site. PNs were then encouraged to screen patients every 90 days or when they transitioned treatment modalities (eg, radiation to chemotherapy). The study, including the development and implementation of the registry, was implemented as standard of care and, therefore, deemed exempt by the Boston Medical Center and Boston University Medical Campus Institutional Review Board (IRB). The relative success of each feature designed in the registry was assessed based on 2 criteria: (1) whether or not we were able to accomplish the goal in REDCap (“REDCap functionality”) and (2) how many sites used the feature: low (none or one), medium (more than one, less than all), high (all) (“Success of Implementation”). PNs provided feedback on the registry informally at their quarterly navigator network meetings and formally, through interviews with the research team. Details on the interviews have been published elsewhere. 15 Results The team was able to develop the necessary database functions required for the registry to align with the protocol with varying levels of success. The main challenges addressed by the registry are summarized in Table 1 Table 1. Problems and solutions in developing registry to track breast cancer patients across multiple healthcare systems in real time.

Manage a caseload of patients who are most vulnerable for delays Eligibility requirements were gathered from basic demographic information and entered into the registry by PNs and reviewed regularly by the research study team. The minimum required data elements were: patient name, date of birth, date of diagnosis, sex, medical record number, race, ethnicity, preferred language, zip code, and type of health insurance. Standard REDCap branching logic was used to automatically calculate and confirm TRIP eligibility (minimum required characteristics = female, ≥18 years old, resident of the greater Boston area, and one or more of the following: Black or Hispanic, primary language other than English, public insurance) as these fields were keyed into REDCap. 8 Prompt navigators for SDoH screening within 90 day time frame A key component of the TRIP protocol was conducting a standardized assessment for social determinants of health for all navigated patients within 90 days of their date of diagnosis. Social needs assessments (SNAs) were collected externally to REDCap, either electronically through an external vendor Aunt Bertha (a software for identifying social needs and providing referrals to local resources, which has since rebranded as FindHelp) or through THRIVE and occasionally on paper forms that were later entered into the electronic systems (see Figures 1 2 16 Figure 1. REDCap Registry—Social Needs Assessment. This screenshot of the Social Needs Assessment tracking form shows 2 things: (1) Patient information piped from other forms within TRIP Registry (blue box at the top) and (2) URL link to go directly to Aunt Bertha from this data entry form (blue box at the bottom). A digital form for “test patient,” with a screening for social needs. Includes fields for date, reasons, and referrals. Figure 2.

The interface is minimalistic, featuring the “Log In” text prominently. Visual tracking at-a-glance One of the common issues with pre-existing tracking methods at each site was the difficulty PNs had in organizing and tracking patients’ current treatment status and next steps in navigating them along the care continuum. We created customized dashboards and reports to display tracking information succinctly, clarifying which patients need action and when (see Figures 3 4 Figure 3. REDCap Registry—“To Do” report. A table displays patient appointment details, including registry ID, event name, task, due dates, status, and patient navigator contact information. Figure 4. REDCap Registry—Dashboard. Patient record homepage showing data collection instruments and repeating forms. Icons indicate status: incomplete, complete, or mixed. Lists include appointments, encounters, and contact info details with dates and names. This navigator tool produced reports that prioritize the PN's caseload based on pre-determined markers of timely care (eg, days since diagnosis) and directed them with an actionable list of patients with pending navigation needs. It was not clear to the research team how often PNs accessed these dashboards or reports. Allow for inter-site communication The Messenger function within REDCap provided a secure platform for PNs to communicate directly across sites, either through direct messages or group conversations. REDCap Messenger includes email alerts and visual flags for unread messages, so PNs seldom missed communications with each other. Users were also able to write notes about appointments and treatment received. Data entry forms were created specifically to provide more detail around transitions between PNs and between sites to track patients who were seeking a second opinion or transferring care. Streamline data entry for PNs The TRIP Registry developed and utilized several functionalities in REDCap to reduce the need for PNs to enter data in the Registry system to prevent redundancy in the EHR, including using dynamic SQL joins to pipe information across the Registry. Although it was not possible to directly integrate data from institutions’ EMR systems, these dynamic joins allowed automatic population of site-specific dropdown lists within REDCap, including navigator name and contact information, where updates could be made in a single location and the new information would automatically update in all forms and reports. Piping information meant information entered once, in a single data entry form, could then be displayed across multiple forms, dashboards, and reports without PNs needing to enter the data again (see Figure 5 Figure 5.

Discussion Previous research on the technological needs of PNs has found that most (60%) used ≥2 databases to collect and/or manage data, but for those that use EMRs, less than half of those systems have discrete, reportable fields for navigation data. 17 18 19 19 , 20 21 We were able to meet the first goal of identifying patients relatively easily using REDCap’s standard functionality. Tracking patients across the cancer care continuum and prompting PNs to prioritize certain patients for navigation activities was accomplished by creating time-based prompts required the study team to develop workarounds and additional functionality beyond the capability of REDCap at the time, using SAS to pull in data from multiple external sources, calculate additional variables outside of REDCap, and then import those updated fields into REDCap for use in real-time reports. Time based functionality was crucial because of the preponderance of evidence showing delays in treatment initiation are linked to higher morbidity and mortality. 10 , 13 , 22 In 2017 when TRIP began, the infrastructure for tracking patients prospectively through their cancer care with freely available software was lacking. On the onset of the study, the patient navigation programs at the 5 participating clinical sites each had their own methods of tracking patients, including varying combinations of each site’s EMR system, MS Excel spreadsheets, shared Outlook calendars, and even sticky notes. Systems for communicating across sites in real time and tracking patients’ needs prospectively did not exist. The existing tracking systems often resulted in duplicate data entries and redundancy in patient navigation; PNs spent a substantial amount of time entering data from their encounters in their systems. 10 23 While transferring care, patients can fall through the tracks and face delays in treatment. Before the TRIP Registry, communication between PNs at different sites commonly involved repeated phone calls and voicemail messages, and inter-site documentation was difficult because each site had their own EMR systems and notes. The TRIP Registry provided a way to facilitate patient transitions and communication between sites, including documentation available to PNs at both sites. Changes to the structure of healthcare in MA at the time restricted the options for patients on public insurance in terms of where they could receive care. 24 Streamlining data entry proved to be one of the biggest challenges and, ultimately, was often in conflict with the research team’s goal of monitoring patient navigation activities. Visual tracking at a glance—where PNs could log into a system, see an overview of their caseload, and prioritize which patients needed attention—was difficult to achieve using REDCap functionality at the time, particularly given the need to minimize PNs’ data entry. The system programmers did develop a comprehensive dashboard that included lagged data calculated and updated through SAS. PNs were trained to use this using existing REDCap search and sort functions, but it is unclear to what extent PNs incorporated these features into their workflows. Data user access of these features was not available from the system administrators. A major limitation of the registry for the research team was in being able to see what type of patient navigation activities each patient was receiving without direct access to the electronic medical records of each site. Also, because there was no interoperability with other platforms like Microsoft Outlook, which most PNs used to populate their work calendar, our tracking system increased demands on documentation rather than decrease them and, ultimately, we could not get PNs to give up their own spreadsheets. While the necessity of creating workarounds with external tools like SAS revealed the limitations of using REDCap as a real-time registry, it is worth noting that newer versions of REDCap have increased functionality. Despite our successes in creating solutions to our challenges within REDCap, the implementation of the registry was largely ineffective. We were unable to streamline PNs’ tasks for the purpose of real-time tracking across the cancer care continuum the patients we identified as most likely at risk for delays in treatment. We envisioned the project described in this report would address health disparities in a setting with multiple academic and community hospitals. Doing so would require a cooperative and collaborative approach to patient navigation and central to our success would be understanding and working within the bounds of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Although commonly described as the “Privacy Rule,” HIPAA also addresses another key facet of our project, interoperability. Privacy in the context of our program can be viewed from 2 perspectives. First, from the perspective of the patient, HIPAA and other state laws govern who may access their records and for what purpose. Generally the Privacy Rule of Title II permits a covered entity to disclose PHI to facilitate treatment, payment, or healthcare operations without express consent. 25 The need for an approach like the one undertaken in this project is largely a function of the unrealized value of interoperability. HIPAA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act) all have important components addressing interoperability. The reliance on standards brought about by HITECH did move the needle; however, practices related to information blocking by health IT vendors and health systems remained important barriers to effective exchange of electronic health information when this project was conceived. 26 27 28 29 30 Another essential component of such a complex and multidirectional communication system is that it be designed and developed using principles of user-centric design. Because such a system is focused on the needs of users and the workflow that they use to provide clinical care and coordination, a design and development challenge is to simultaneously standardize the data collection and communication systems while providing core functions as well as sufficient local customization to account for the local idiosyncrasies and data collection and patient tracking. This enables user (PN, social worker, clinician, etc) buy-in and eventually an embracing and ownership of the system. Ultimately, the critical success criterion is 3-fold, namely (1) the system is used universally and routinely; (2) the data are always available, accurate, and up-to-date; and (3) the system is universally accepted to be the absolute source of truth for any particular patient having their care coordinated and tracked by the program. The case study presented here offers insight into the challenges we faced in creating the registry. Conclusion This study presented a unique use case for REDCap, a HIPAA compliant data capture system freely available to all Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) hubs and their affiliates. We created a patient-registry to track patient navigation activities for women undergoing treatment for newly diagnosed breast cancer across the city of Boston. Regional-based registries may facilitate efforts to address health equity across multiple healthcare systems operating in one geographical area.
