Summary Subtle variations of micronutrients in the tumor microenvironment often coincide with tumor progression and immune disorders. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of how micronutrients, such as metal ions, influence tumor-intrinsic properties and tumor-immune crosstalk remain inadequately characterized. Here, our integrative analysis of multi-center single-cell, spatial transcriptome sequencing, and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) cohorts reveals that nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)-specific SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4) governs microenvironmental and cellular zinc metabolism through its downstream target, SLC39A14 (ZIP14), a membrane zinc uptake transporter. Mechanistically, NPC cells enhance zinc uptake and activate Wnt/β-catenin signaling to initiate tumor growth, creating a zinc-deficient niche hostile to T cells.

Scale bars: 100 μm, 20 μm. SOX4 confers malignant phenotypes of NPC cells To investigate the role of SOX4 in regulating the biological processes of NPC cells, we characterized a subset of 7,266 tumor cells and 93 normal nasopharyngeal epithelial cells from the integrated single-cell cohort mentioned previously. The tumor cells were then categorized into high- and low-SOX4 expression groups based on their median SOX4 expression levels ( Figure 2 Figures 2 S2 Figure 2 SOX4 regulates intrinsic phenotypes of NPC (A) A UMAP plot was generated for 7,359 cells, which included 7,266 tumor cells exhibiting high and low expression levels of SOX4 and 93 normal epithelial cells, extracted from patients with NPC and NLI, respectively.

Nevertheless, pharmaceutical agents have yet to be specifically developed to target SOX4 up to today. Thus, we planned to use AAV to specifically inhibit SOX4 expression in subcutaneous NPC PDXs in vivo 60 Figure 7 Figures 7 Figure 7 Estimation of SOX4-targeting therapeutic strategy in NPC treatment (A) Schematic representation of the subcutaneous patient-derived xenograft (PDX) inoculation and chemotherapy strategy employed in nude mice.

Given extensive research on immunotherapy for NPC in recent years 61 , 62 + Figures 7 + Figure 7 + Figure 7 + Discussion Recent studies have begun investigating the role of metabolic remodeling within the TME concerning tumor immunosuppression. Given the limited efficacy of current immunotherapeutic regimens for patients with NPC and the lack of understanding of the unique immune microenvironment associated with NPC, an in-depth exploration of the role of tumor cells in reshaping the metabolic landscape of the TME, along with their dynamic interactions with immune cells, is essential for enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Zinc, a vital trace mineral element, functions as a crucial second messenger involved in fundamental cellular metabolic processes and plays significant physiological roles. As a key factor in maintaining cellular homeostasis, zinc has attracted increasing interest in the context of disease progression. Dysregulation in zinc metabolism often leads to dysfunctions in immune cells, particularly by disrupting signaling within the TCR pathway. In our previous study, we established a multi-center cohort of patients with NPC that incorporated publicly available single-cell datasets. Through analyzing this cohort, we identified elevated expression of SOX4 in tumor cells as a master regulator of the cellular tumor phenotype. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that tumor cells can activate competitive zinc uptake via the SOX4-ZIP14 pathway, reducing zinc levels within the TME, which may adversely affect T cell function. Zinc is essential for T cell activation and functionality, and zinc deficiency can lead to impaired T cell responses. Zinc exerts pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects across various immune cell populations. Although our study primarily investigates the role of ZIP14 in T cells, we acknowledge that dysregulation of zinc may concurrently influence multiple immune lineages through both direct cellular mechanisms and alterations within the TME. This complexity underscores the need for future research to systematically assess both the cell-type-specific and overall immunological consequences of modulating zinc transporter activity. Notably, our results indicated that T cells are more vulnerable to zinc deficiency than tumor cells—which often gain a competitive advantage for zinc within the TME. By manipulating zinc metabolism, tumor cells hinder T cell activation and function, depriving CD8 + In conclusion, our study concluded that SOX4, a frequently up-regulated MTF in NPC cells, not only promoted and sustained tumor-intrinsic properties but also manipulated microenvironmental zinc metabolism to outcompete T cells for zinc through the downstream target ZIP14. This interaction led to aberrant T cell TCR signaling, thereby impairing their anti-tumor immunity. A therapeutic strategy targeting SOX4 could rectify the abnormal zinc metabolism within the NPC TME and restore the cytotoxic function of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + Limitations of the study This study provided evidence that SOX4 serves as a master regulator in the initiation, progression, and immune evasion of NPC by modulating zinc metabolism within the TME. However, the clinical application of targeting TFs remains challenging. We evaluated the efficacy of intratumoral delivery of AAV-SOX4-RNAi in a humanized mouse model, yet this approach is not widely implemented in clinical treatments. Furthermore, the absence of promising animal models for investigating the NPC immune microenvironment, particularly due to the lack of mouse-derived NPC cell lines and spontaneous mouse models, poses a significant challenge in studying NPC. Consequently, we were limited to utilizing PBMC-engrafted humanized models, which restricted our study window to approximately 6 weeks, to explore the NPC immune microenvironment.

All the research was under the guidance of associated ethical regulations. Clinical samples for sequencing, primary culture, immunostaining, and flow cytometry analysis were obtained from healthy blood donors and patients with NPC and lymphatic hyperplasia, who have signed informed consent. In vivo All animal procedures and work were performed in strict adherence to the Animals (Control of Experiments) Ordinance (Hong Kong) and the Institute’s guidelines from the Center for Comparative Medical Research (CCMR), Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong. For the tumorigenicity model, 1.5×10 6 6 2 6 Establishment of the PBMC humanized mouse model and xenotransplantation Freshly isolated PBMCs were stimulated with T cell TransAct, human (Miltenyi) for three days and expanded in TexMACS GMP medium (Miltenyi) with the addition of 10% Hi-FBS and 1% PS, 50 IU/mL IL-2 (Miltenyi) for another three days. 6-week-old female NSG mouse had received an intravenous injection of 1×10 7 6 For the xenotransplanted humanized mouse model, 4-week-old female NSG mice were maintained under anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (10mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (5mg/kg body weight) mixture. Xeno76 kept on nude mice was minced by a scalpel blade into tiny pieces with an identical volume (2 mm × 2 mm × 2 mm). Pieced PDX tissue was inoculated subcutaneously into the left dorsal flank of each mouse via a puncture needle. After 3 weeks when the PDX started to grow, 1 × 10 7 11 2 Cell lines and culture All cell lines in this study maintained at 37°C in humidified incubators containing 5% CO2. Human NPC cell lines C666-1 (EBV+), NPC43 (EBV+ and EBV−), and human NPE cell lines NP460, NP69 were provided by The NPC Tissue Bank, the University of Hong Kong. The HEK293FT cell line was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific and cultured according to recommendations. All NPC and NPE cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) and 1% PS (Gibco). The HEK293FT cell line was cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1% PS (Gibco), 1× MEM amino acids solution (Gibco) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco). Cell lines have been tested for authenticity by performing STR profiling and were free of mycoplasma before use. Method details Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors The peripheral blood from healthy donors was collected by Hong Kong Red Cross and approved for medical research. All donors gave formal consent for their blood to be used in this study. The collected citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD) anticoagulated peripheral blood was mixed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% EDTA at a 1:1 ratio. 10 mL Ficoll-Paque PLUS (Cytiva) transferred into 50 mL conical tube then gently covering 35 mL blood mixture. The blood mixture was centrifuged at 400×g with the lowest acceleration and deceleration speed for 25 mins at room temperature. The PBMCs at the second layer were collected into new 50 mL conical tubes and centrifuged at 300×g for 10 mins. The supernatant was discarded. PBMCs were washed with PBS containing 2% FBS (Gibco) and 0.5% EDTA once, centrifuged, and discarded supernatant. ACK Lysing Buffer (Gibco) was used for red blood cell lysing according to the manufacturer’s description. The fresh PBMCs were ready for T cell isolation and activation. For PBMCs frozen, 90% FBS supplemented by 10% DMSO (Sigma) was prepared as the freezing medium. PBMCs cryopreserved in Corning CoolCell LX at −80°C overnight then transferred into liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. PBMCs isolated for less than one month were used in this study. Anti-CD19 CAR lentivirus packaging and concentration HEK293FT cells were seeded at the confluency of 95% per well in a six-well plate using DMEM transfection medium. Cells were transfected with the packaging plasmids psPAX2 (Addgene) and pMD2.G (Addgene) together with the CAR overexpression plasmid (pLV[Exp]-EGFP-EF1A-CD19-CAR) in a 2:1:4 ratio, utilizing the Lipofectamine 3000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) by the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The lipid-DNA complex was incubated for 6 hours. Replaced medium completely with a fresh lentivirus packaging medium supplemented with 1× viral boost reagent (Alstem), following the instructions of the manufacturer. Lentivirus was collected at 24-, 48- and 72-h post-transfection. Cell medium containing the lentivirus was centrifuged at 1,000×g, 4°C for 15 min to remove the cell debris. We concentrated on the lentivirus particles by mixing them with Lenti-X Concentrator (TaKaRa), according to the manufacturer’s protocols. The mixture was incubated at 4°C for 30 min before being centrifuged at 1500×g for 45 min at 4°C. The lentivirus pellet was subsequently resuspended in cold PBS to create the 100× concentrated virus. Transduction of CD8 + Human CD8 + + 6 + Stable cell line construction The lentiviruses of overexpressing of SOX4 (LV-SOX4) and control (LV-CON) from Genechem Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Stable cell lines were generated by selecting transfected cells with Puromycin (3 μg/mL, Gibco, NY). For knockdown, plasmids expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting human SOX4 and ZIP14 were built by cloning shRNA sequences into the lentiviral vector pLKO.1 (Sigma, SHC001). ShNC is a negative control containing a sequence that does not target any known mammalian genes. These stable knockdown cell lines were selected by puromycin dihydrochloride (3 μg/mL, Gibco, NY). Cell viability and proliferation assays Lentiviral transduced cell lines were seeded into 96-well plates (Corning) with a density of 1 × 10 3 3 Cell migration and invasion assays Lentiviral transduced C666-1 (NC and SOX4 KD) and NP69 cells (Vector, SOX4 OE) were assayed for their abilities to spread and invade through wound-healing, Boyden chamber and invasion assays as described previously1. 2×10 5 5 2 Tumor sphere formation assay The culture medium constituted by DMEM/F12 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 2% B27 (Life Technologies), 4 μg/mL insulin (Invitrogen), 20 ng/mL human recombinant EGF (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 ng/mL basic FGF (Millipore) and 1% methylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich). The constructed cell lines were seeded at 1×10 4 4 Limiting dilution assay Lentiviral transduced NP69 cells (SOX4-OE and vector) underwent serial dilution to obtain suitable concentrations for subcutaneous injection into 4∼6-week-old female NOD SCID mice. The count of mice that developed tumors within two months post-transplantation was counted from each group, and images of tumors formed were taken. The frequency of estimated stem cells and the significance of the difference between treatment groups were evaluated using the Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA) software. CHIP-PCR SOX4-3×FLAG construct incorporated into the CV702 vector (purchased from Shanghai Genechem Co., Ltd.). EZ-ChIP kit (Merck) was used for this experiment. Briefly, C666-1 cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, followed by quenching with glycine. Chromatin was then sonicated to generate 200–500 bp fragments using Bioruptor Pico. Immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4°C with with Anti-FLAG M2 Antibody (CST, #2368) coupled to Protein A/G Magnetic Beads (Pierce). After stringent washing, DNA-protein complexes were eluted and reversed cross-linking. Purified DNA was analyzed by PCR with primers flanking the putative binding sites in the SOX4 promoter. Dual luciferase reporter assay HEK293FT cells were seeded at 80–90% confluency into 96-well plates and transfected using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer’s manuals. In brief, 100 ng of Renilla phRL-TK control plasmid along with 100 ng of each experimental plasmid (CV702-NC, CV702-SOX4) were transfected in the presence of GV238-SLC39A14-firefly_luciferase plasmid. The Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) was utilized to measure the Relative luciferase units (RLUs) 48 h after transfection. The RLUs from firefly luciferase signal were normalized by the Renilla signal. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay The LDH activity was evaluated employing the LDH-Glo Cytotoxicity Assay, in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Promega). In summary, following a 24-h co-culture, 2 μL of conditioned medium (CM) was extracted from each sample and diluted in 48 μL of LDH storage buffer. Subsequently, the prepared LDH detection reagent was added at a 1:1 ratio and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The fluorescence intensity was then measured using a CLARIOstar Plus microplate reader (BMG Labtech). Flow cytometry For surface marker analysis, the cells were collected, and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were then washed once with FACS buffer (1× PBS containing 0.5% EDTA and 2% FBS), followed by centrifugation at 300×g for 5 min at each step. The cells resuspended in FACS buffer and incubated with the appropriate surface marker antibodies for 20 min at 4°C. After incubation, the cells were washed with 2 mL of FACS buffer, centrifuged at 300×g for 5 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The cells were then resuspended in FACS buffer for further analysis. For intracellular marker analysis, the cells were fixed and permeabilized using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The stained cells were subsequently washed and resuspended in 1× Perm buffer for flow cytometry analysis. The intensity of the conjugated fluorochromes was detected using a NovoCyte Quanteon flow cytometer (Agilent), with analysis performed using NovoExpress software (v 1.5.6, Agilent). Gating strategies were presented in supplement Figure S6 Western blotting Cells were lysed in Pierce RIPA Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (MCE) and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (MCE). Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were extracted using the Cytoplasmic & Nuclear Protein Extraction Kit (Beyotime). Protein lysates were quantified via the Bradford protein assay, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to an activated PVDF membrane (Millipore). After blocking, the membrane was incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Each antibody incubation was followed by three washes with 1×TBST (100 rpm, 10 min, three times). Blots were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Bio-Rad) and X-ray film. Band intensities were normalized to β-Actin, vinculin, or GAPDH. Immunohistochemistry For immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, we collected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) NPC sections from the Department of Pathology at the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital. IHC was performed following standard protocols. Briefly, the tissue slides were placed in a 65°C oven for a minimum of 3 h and then sequentially immersed in xylene (three times), a 1:1 mixture of xylene and ethanol, 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, and 75% ethanol, with each step lasting 10 min. The slides were then rinsed with tap water to ensure complete dewaxing. Next, the slides were immersed in 1× antigen retrieval buffer (Dako) for 45 min at 95°C and allowed to cool naturally for at least 30 min. The slides were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 For immunofluorescence (IF) staining, the slides were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies, including anti-human SOX4 (Abcam) and anti-human SLC39A14 (Abclonal), at 4°C overnight. Following three washes with PBS, the slides were incubated with Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen) and Alexa 555 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After another set of three washes with PBS, the slides were treated with DAPI at a concentration of 1:1000 for 10 min at room temperature. The slides were then sealed with Diamond antifade mountant (Invitrogen), and images were captured using the LSM900 Microscope System. RNA extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Total RNA was extracted using the RNA Extraction Kit from Vazyme. Complementary DNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA utilizing the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit with the gDNA eraser from Takara. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted with TB Green Premix Ex Taq from TaKaRa and analyzed using the LightCycler 480 II Real-Time PCR Detector from Roche. The quality of the amplified fragments was evaluated through the melting curve method. Transcript levels were normalized to ACTB and the relative mRNA levels in experimental samples were compared to controls. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Cell culture medium from the co-culture system was collected after 24 h of incubation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to quantify the secretion of cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (Invitrogen), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) (Abcam). The concentrations of these cytokines in the cell culture supernatants from various experimental groups were measured at wavelengths of 450 nm and 620 nm, and the results were calculated using their respective standard curves. Zinc assay Intracellular and extracellular zinc quantification procedures were conducted following the manufacturer’s instructions. For the quantification of medium zinc (ab102507), a 7% TCA solution was added to the collected samples at a 1:1 ratio for deproteinization. The mixture was then centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 min. Subsequently, 50 μL of each sample was transferred to a 96-well plate, and 200 μL of the prepared zinc reaction reagent was added to each sample. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and measured at OD560nm using a CLARIOstar Plus microplate reader (BMG Labtech). For intracellular zinc (ab241014) measurements, cells were harvested and washed twice with 1 mL of chilled 1X assay buffer. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of 1X Assay Buffer, and 2 μL of Zinc Probe (500X) was added to the 1 mL cell suspension. The cells were then incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 Quantification and statistical analysis The results were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD), as described in the figure legends. Plots were created using GraphPad Prism 10 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22. Violin plots were shown as kernel density estimations (KDE) with median values ± IQR. p p References 1 Bossi P. Chan A.T.
