Summary Heart disease and cancer share common risk factors, genetic predispositions, and metabolic and inflammatory components. Metabolic reprogramming can drive disease progression in both, with cardiometabolic syndrome—marked by obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension—contributing to cancer development. Studies link around 20% of cancer cases to obesity, while elevated glucose and triglyceride levels increase the risk of liver, thyroid, and respiratory cancers. Beyond treatment-related cardiotoxicity, cancer patients often have pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) at diagnosis, highlighting their bidirectional relationship. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a powerful platform to study these links at a personalized level. iPSC models help explore shared molecular mechanisms, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and cardiotoxicity. This review examines emerging themes in cardio-oncology and cardio-metabolism, emphasizing how iPSC-based approaches can reveal disease connections and inform new therapies. Graphical abstract Kojic et al. explore the intersection of cardio-oncology and cardiometabolic disease. Using iPSC-based models, they highlight shared mechanisms such as metabolic reprogramming and inflammation, offering insights into cancer therapy-induced cardiotoxicity and pre-existing CVD. This review underscores the need for integrative strategies targeting both cancer and cardiovascular health. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Although heart disease and cancer are two distinct diseases, they share significant similarities, from epidemiologic risk factors to shared biologic pathways. As a result, understanding the fundamental mechanisms central to the relationship between cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has garnered growing interest in recent years, resulting in a rapidly evolving body of research and recognition that metabolic reprogramming in both conditions offers common clues into their disease development and progression. Abdominal obesity, insulin-resistant glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and increased blood pressure—conditions clustered under the cardiometabolic syndrome—have been recognized as contributors to the development and progression of specific cancer types. 1 2 3 In addition to the well-documented increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors due to cardiotoxic cancer therapies, there is evidence that patients with cancer also have higher prevalence of heart disease at the time of diagnosis, even before treatment. 4 5 6 , 7 8 These findings highlight the intricate interplay between CVD and cancer, underscoring the need for further research to elucidate their shared mechanisms. Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a promising platform for studying these complex interactions and uncovering novel insights. In this review, we will highlight emerging themes in the fields of cardio-oncology and cardio-metabolism and their interplay, with a specific focus on how patient-specific iPSCs can offer unique insights into common themes spanning both disciplines. We begin by outlining the shared cardiometabolic mechanisms that contribute to the co-occurrence of cancer and CVD, before examining how cancer therapies further exacerbate this vulnerability through cardiotoxic effects. Shared mechanisms in cardiometabolic disease and cancer Cardiometabolic disease is a broad term that encompasses conditions arising from the interplay between metabolic dysfunction and cardiovascular risk. These diseases are often rooted in cardiometabolic syndrome, which is characterized by factors such as insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Together, these interconnected conditions significantly contribute to the global burden of CVD morbidity and mortality. 9 Cardiometabolic syndrome affects a significant proportion of the global population, with prevalence estimates ranging from 20% to 40% in adults, depending on the region and criteria used for diagnosis. 10 11 The pathogenesis of cardiometabolic syndrome is multifactorial and involves a complex interplay among genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors. Central to its development is insulin resistance, which disrupts glucose metabolism and promotes compensatory hyperinsulinemia. 10 12 13 14 , 15 Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress further amplify metabolic and cardiovascular abnormalities through impaired energy metabolism and lipid accumulation, creating a feedback loop that amplifies disease progression. 15 PPARG FTO APOE PCSK9 16 , 17 , 18 ACE AGT IRS1 19 Shared risk factors for CVD and cancer CVD and cancer are often found in the same patients and can complicate each condition’s pathology. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain their comorbidity, including shared environmental risks (e.g., obesity, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle), inflammation, and shared genetic variants ( Figure 1 20 , 21 Figure 1 CVD and cancer share numerous risk factors, with cardiometabolic syndrome and metabolic dysregulation emerging as central drivers of both Targeting these shared pathways could enable the development of interventions that simultaneously mitigate cancer progression and prevent adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and metabolism; created in BioRender: https://BioRender.com/t97s698 Complex interactions between immune cells, inflammatory cytokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROSs) in the tumor microenvironment activate a range of inflammatory pathways. 22 23 , 24 25 , 26 27 28 26 27 Genetic variants in genes encoding proteins involved in the WNT signaling pathway, dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase (DYRK) protein kinase family, JAK2, TTN, and TET2, among others, are linked to the development of both cancer and CVD. The WNT/β-catenin pathway regulates DNA repair, cell proliferation, and survival, playing crucial roles in both cancer and CVD. 29 30 31 The DYRK family, a subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases, has two isoforms: DYRK1A and DYRK1B. 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 , 39 Identifying shared molecular targets could pave the way for a one-hit therapeutic that would reduce both cancer progression and detrimental cardiac consequences. Furthermore, informed genetic testing could enable tailored targeted treatment for cancer patients, thus allowing early prevention of cardiotoxicities and CVDs through patient-specific treatment strategies ( Figure 1 Metabolism in cardiac and cancer cells CMs and cancer cells share the capacity to maintain crucial cellular functions during extended periods of stress, including high demands of ATP and macromolecule synthesis (e.g., of proteins, lipids, and nucleotides). 40 41 , 42 43 44 45 , 46 47 48 In the heart, metabolic changes are directly linked to organ dysfunction or preservation, whereas metabolic remodeling in tumors serves the acquisition and maintenance of malignancy. 49 50 , 51 , 52 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 57 58 , 59 44 Cancer metabolism and cardiac dysfunction: Systemic crosstalk The metabolic dysregulation of cancer cells can extend beyond the tumor environment to cause systemic or localized consequences, including cardiac dysfunction. 60 , 61 62 , 63 64 , 65 66 , 67 68 69 70 Loss-of-function mutations in VHL (von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor suppressor gene) are further examples of how metabolic reprogramming can facilitate the development of both cancer and cardiac disfunction. VHL encodes an E3-ubiquitin ligase that targets hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2α) for degradation. VHL mutations lead to a loss of function of the VHL E3-ubiquitin ligase, stabilizing HIF1α and HIF2α, driving the expression of genes required for hypoxia response. These genes include angiogenic growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and metabolism-related proteins (glucose transporter 1), thus changing the metabolic phenotype of the tumor. 71 72 73 74 , 75 76 77 78 , 79 80 Succinate accumulation as a result of impaired succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) function in a variety of cancers has been linked with severe myopathies and dilated cardiomyopathies in several case reports, but this has yet to be replicated in larger studies. 81 82 , 83 , 84 , 85 , 86 87 88 89 90 Cardiometabolic syndrome and cancer Patients affected by both diabetes and obesity have increased blood glucose levels, altered abundance and composition of plasma lipids, disrupted insulin regulation, and upregulated inflammatory cytokines levels, all of which are risk factors for cancer development and progression. 91 Recent studies have examined the association between metabolic syndrome as a whole and the risk of cancer development. 92 3 93 , 94 91 High levels of insulin and insulin resistance, negative consequences of high glucose blood levels, and β cell compensatory mechanisms are critical to the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. Increased insulin synthesis leads to accumulation of C-peptide, which is cleaved from immature proinsulin form to create insulin, as well as hepatic growth hormone-mediated synthesis of insulin growth factor (IGF)-1. High levels of insulin, C-peptide, and IGF-1 are associated with the development and progression of breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancers. 95 , 96 in vitro 97 , 98 , 99 Proliferative tumor cells are known to prefer glucose as their energy source, and many overexpress glucose transporters, GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4. 100 101 102 103 , 104 Changes in lipid levels, specifically low HDL cholesterol, high LDL cholesterol, and increased triglycerides, are hallmarks off the metabolic syndrome and are associated with a number of tumors. Specifically, cholesterol has a central role in androgen- and estrogen-driven tumors. 105 de novo 106 107 Obesity can be understood as a state of chronic inflammation in which adipocytes increase in size and are surrounded by elevated numbers of macrophages. The infiltrated adipose tissue macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-α. 108 109 110 111 , 112 These observations underscore the complex interplay between metabolic dysfunction and tumor biology, where shared molecular mechanisms such as inflammation, insulin resistance, and lipid dysregulation drive both cardiometabolic syndrome and cancer progression, providing new insights into their intertwined pathophysiology. Cardio-oncology: Mechanism of cardiotoxicity in cancer therapy Recent advances in cancer therapies have markedly improved patient prognosis and survival, but they have also revealed a spectrum of cardiovascular and metabolic toxicities. The emergence of cardio-oncology reflects a growing need to understand and manage these therapy-induced effects. This field combines cardiology, oncology, and molecular medicine to investigate how anticancer treatments disrupt cardiovascular function, through both direct toxicity and indirect systemic effects, and to develop monitoring and intervention strategies. These efforts integrate imaging, biomarker screening (e.g., troponin and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide [NT-proBNP]), and longitudinal follow-up with mechanistic studies that identify vulnerable pathways such as HER2 signaling, mitochondrial metabolism, and DNA damage repair. 113 Many anticancer therapies converge on a few critical injury pathways despite targeting diverse molecular processes in tumors. Mitochondrial dysfunction is one such common thread. Anthracyclines, including doxorubicin and daunorubicin, were among the first agents recognized for their cardiotoxicity, traditionally linked to ROS production. More recent data, however, implicate topoisomerase IIβ-mediated DNA damage, disruption of mitochondrial integrity, and suppression of CM proliferation ( Figure 2 114 115 Figure 2 Timeline depicting the introduction of cancer therapies and the subsequent identification of their associated cardiotoxicities A schematic representation highlights the molecular mechanisms and downstream consequences (e.g., inflammation, mitochondria disfunction, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, ROS production, cell signaling alterations, autophagy and apoptosis dysregulation, DNA damage, gene expression changes, and contraction defects) through which these drugs exert cardiotoxic effects; created in BioRender: https://BioRender.com/a69m797 Similar injury patterns emerge with proteasome inhibitors and kinase inhibitors. Bortezomib, a first-generation proteasome inhibitor used in hematologic malignancies, has been associated with mitochondrial damage, oxidative stress, and impaired cardiac energetics ( Figure 2 116 , 117 Figure 2 118 , 119 , 120 121 , 122 , 123 , 124 , 125 Immunotherapies have introduced a distinct spectrum of cardiotoxic effects, often driven by immune-mediated inflammation ( Figure 2 126 , 127 128 , 129 , 130 , 131 132 , 133 , 134 135 , 136 137 , 138 , 139 Even molecularly targeted therapies designed for high precision can affect cardiac tissue. Trastuzumab, a HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody, disrupts signaling pathways critical for CM survival and homeostasis. Although trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity is often reversible, it requires close surveillance, particularly in patients receiving concurrent anthracyclines. 140 141 , 142 As these examples illustrate, the mechanisms of therapy-induced cardiotoxicity span DNA damage, oxidative stress, mitochondrial injury, inflammatory responses, endothelial dysfunction, and off-target kinase inhibition. Despite progress in understanding these pathways, considerable variability remains in patient responses. Some individuals develop severe cardiotoxicity while others tolerate treatment with minimal complications. This disparity highlights the importance of patient-specific factors—including genetic predisposition, comorbidities like diabetes or hypertension, and differential drug metabolism—in shaping individual risk profiles. A growing body of evidence also suggests that many anticancer therapies perturb systemic metabolic homeostasis, beyond their direct cardiac effects. This is particularly significant in patients with pre-existing cardiometabolic disease, who may be more susceptible to therapy-induced stress. As cardio-oncology continues to evolve, a key priority is to integrate these overlapping layers of toxicity—cardiac, vascular, and metabolic—into a cohesive model that informs prevention, monitoring, and therapeutic adaptation. Metabolic effect of anticancer therapies A variety of anticancer therapies has been shown to lead to the development of CVDs through different mechanisms, including direct cardiotoxicity, effects on vasculature, and immune system and metabolic perturbations. 143 , 144 145 146 147 148 , 149 , 150 151 , 152 141 131 , 132 135 , 138 , 139 , 153 The role of iPSC models in cardio-oncology and cardiometabolic research Cardiometabolic disease and their complications are a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. As of 2022, over 10% of the global population is affected by diabetes. 91 , 154 155 iPSC technology stands as an innovative approach at the intersection of these two fields, providing a powerful tool to study the mechanisms of disease development and progression, mechanism of toxicity, cell interaction within a disease context, risk factor assessment, and personalized care to create a versatile platform for patient-specific drug discovery and validation. iPSCs are derived from an individual’s (patient or healthy) somatic cells (e.g., fibroblasts [FBs] from skin biopsies, peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs] , etc.) through the introduction of Yamanaka pluripotency factors 156 157 Figure 3 Figure 3 iPSCs derived from patients and healthy individuals can be differentiated into a variety of cell types and further assembled into 3D iPSC-based models These systems can be used to model disease and drug exposure by monitoring cell functionality, phenotypical changes, and gene expression alterations.

Because iPSCs are genetically identical to the patient from whom they are derived, the risk of tissue rejection and detrimental immune response to foreign cells can be minimized. In the context of cardiometabolic diseases, one of the most promising applications of iPSCs is the production of pancreatic β cells. For individuals with diabetes caused by insulin deficiency, the introduction of healthy, functional β cells capable of producing insulin represents a groundbreaking therapeutic approach. 168 169 It is important to note that currently available iPSC-CMs exhibit phenotypic plasticity during their in vitro 170 171 , 172 Tissue engineering approaches for cardio-oncology and cardiometabolic diseases Building on advancements in iPSC-based disease modeling, tissue engineering approaches offer complementary and physiologically relevant tools for studying cardio-oncology and cardiometabolic diseases. By combining iPSCs with biomaterials, 3D scaffolds, and bioprinting technologies, tissue engineering can be used to recreate tissue-like heart and vascular microenvironments. 173 171 , 174 3D self-assembling cell masses known as organoids were first developed in 2011 by embedding mouse embryonic stem cells into hydrogel and guiding them through differentiation into polarized cortical brain tissue. Since then, organoids resembling brain, liver, gut, kidney, and heart, among others, have been developed and explored. By assembling iPSCs into 3D structures and initiating differentiation, the cells tend to differentiate through developmental trajectories resembling those in vivo in vivo 175 176 174 , 177 178 While the use of organoids is already established for modeling organ-specific disease, their expansion in multiorgan and metabolic disease has garnered growing interest in recent years. iPSC-derived pancreatic-like organoids are being developed for diabetes modeling, drug testing, and transplantation therapy. Efforts are devoted toward developing islet-like organoids that do not produce any non-pancreatic-islet cell types but secrete the full spectrum of hormones to improve their accuracy and utility. 175 179 180 174 173 EHTs consist of hydrogels and cardiac cells (CMs, ECs, and FBs in defined ratios) that are cast into molds with elastomeric pillars. Years of improvement and protocol development led to the formation of iPSC-derived EHTs that have mature cell properties, including dense cellular networks, organized ultrastructure including M-bands and connexins, improved calcium handing, and increased electrophysiological activity following electrical stimulation. 181 182 183 170 , 172 Taken together, iPSCs and their advanced 3D models have already demonstrated their utility in modeling complex diseases, metabolic dysregulation, and drug toxicity. By providing a human-based research and testing platform, they generate promising therapeutic avenues as a direct source for regenerative treatments, drug discovery, and personalized medicine ( Figure 3 Clinical implications and future directions As cancer therapies continue to extend survival, patients are increasingly facing long-term cardiovascular consequences—not only from the treatments themselves but also from cancer-related inflammation and metabolic disruption. This is especially true for individuals with underlying cardiometabolic disease, who may experience synergistic effects on cardiac function. In this context, cardio-oncology must evolve beyond reactive management toward a proactive, integrative approach. Preventative strategies targeting metabolic risk factors (e.g., statins, glycemic control, etc.) hold promise for improving both cancer and cardiovascular outcomes. These considerations set the stage for translational efforts, including dietary interventions and patient-specific iPSC-based strategies, to optimize therapy and minimize harm. Several lines of evidence support the central role of metabolism in the development of both CVD and cancer. Targeting specific metabolic signatures—whether through direct enzyme inhibition or dietary modulation—can influence tumor growth, improve therapy tolerance, and reduce cancer-associated cardiovascular risk. These efforts are exemplified by the clinical use of IDH1/2 inhibitors. Additionally, preclinical studies have shown that intermittent fasting can delay tumorigenesis and reduce growth factor signaling, offering another potential avenue for systemic metabolic intervention. Furthermore, the investigation into how risk factors for both cancer and CVD such as obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia might provide new avenues for systemic solutions to both diseases through dietary interventions. Fasting has been shown to have positive effects on cancer prevention and treatment in mice. Just 1 day of fasting per week delays tumorigenesis in p53-deficient mice, with other effects including decreased plasma levels of glucose, insulin, and insulin-like growth factor 1. Periods of fasting are also followed by high cellular proliferation, characterized by cellular repair pathway activation and driven by the replenishment of growth factors during refeeding that can reverse atrophic cellular remodeling. iPSC technologies offer a versatile and powerful platform for accurately modeling CVDs, metabolic disorders, cancer, and their complex interactions. By providing an essentially unlimited supply of targeted cell types derived from either healthy controls or patients, these models enable the recapitulation of disease-specific phenotypes influenced by genetic and environmental factors. As an accessible, precise, and highly adaptable system, iPSCs can enable groundbreaking discoveries in disease mechanisms and toxicity progression while also facilitating the development of effective therapeutic strategies. iPSCs’ ability to reflect the unique genetic background of the individual from which they are derived positions them as a cornerstone for advancing personalized precision medicine. In cardio-oncology, iPSCs provide a robust platform to assess individual responses to anticancer therapies, enabling the identification of treatment combinations that maximize tumor suppression while minimizing detrimental side effects. This approach holds immense promise for tailoring treatments to the unique needs of each patient with transformative implications for improving outcomes in cancer survivors, who face heightened risks of developing CVD. To fully realize the potential of these technologies, cross-disciplinary research integrating cardio-oncology, oncology, and cardio-metabolism is essential. Such collaboration can bridge the critical gap between molecular studies and clinical applications, leveraging patient-derived samples for mechanistic insights and risk stratification, and promote the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Ultimately, this integrated approach promises the advent of a new paradigm to transform patient care, by effectively treating both cancer progression and its cardiovascular consequences.
