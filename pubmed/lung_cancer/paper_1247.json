The accumulation of MetS components increases the risk of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases, as well as cognitive impairment and polypharmacy in aging populations. A narrative review was conducted focusing on the management of MetS in adults aged 65 and older. Sources were identified through targeted searches of PubMed and relevant guidelines, with an emphasis on literature discussing geriatric-specific considerations. The review was structured using the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s (IHI) 4Ms Framework: What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility. Findings highlight that current MetS guidelines are often extrapolated from younger populations and insufficiently account for geriatric-specific factors such as altered pharmacokinetics, multimorbidity, and social determinants of health. The 4Ms Framework provides a comprehensive lens to adapt these guidelines, supporting individualized treatment plans that consider patient goals, cognitive status, and functional capacity. Incorporating social services and aligning interventions with socioeconomic realities can further bridge disparities in care. The 4Ms framework can help healthcare providers communicate effectively with patients, ensuring treatment plans align with evidence-based practices and the patient’s individual priorities. Treatment of MetS must be tailored to individual patient needs based on presented risk factors, severity of risks, and social determinants of health. Adjusting treatment plans in accordance with the socioeconomic status (SES) of patients will allow for systematic improvement of outcomes. metabolic syndrome social determinants geriatrics 4M framework This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Metabolic syndrome (MetS), also known as Syndrome X, is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities characterized by insulin resistance, central obesity, and dyslipidemia accompanied with chronic low-grade inflammatory state; these factors increase the risk for the development of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) [ 1 2 3 4 5 The prevalence of adult MetS continues to rise globally, and the aging population is not exempt from this. Data from the United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011–2018 demonstrated a significant increase in MetS prevalence among participants, from 37.6% in 2011–2012 rising to 41.8% in 2017–2018 [ 1 6 7 8 Given the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and the unique challenges associated with aging, there is a pressing need for management strategies tailored to the geriatric population. This review aims to present a comprehensive approach to managing MetS in older adults by integrating the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s (IHI) 4Ms Framework with consideration of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH). We explore current diagnostic criteria, underlying pathophysiology, key comorbid conditions, and practical applications of the 4Ms in clinical care. Our ultimate goal is to support healthcare providers in promoting early diagnosis, implementing patient-centered strategies, and improving health outcomes for this highly vulnerable population. 2. Methodology 2.1. Research Model This paper follows a narrative review model aimed at synthesizing existing literature on metabolic syndrome (MetS) in older adults, with a focus on the application of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement’s (IHI) 4Ms Framework and consideration of the Social Determinants of Health (SDoH). The objective was to integrate evidence from diverse study designs to provide a comprehensive, clinically relevant overview rather than conduct a meta-analysis. 2.2. Data Collection and Search Strategy A comprehensive search of the PubMed database was performed from the inception to February 2025 to identify relevant articles. Various medical subject headings (MeSH) terms, including “geriatric”, “aging”, “4Ms”, “metabolic syndrome”, and “social determinants of health”, were used to generate the search strategy. 2.3. Inclusion Criteria Studies were eligible in this review if they met the criteria: Conducted in older adult populations. Focused on Metabolic Syndrome. Discussed social determinants of health. Included treatments/outcomes. Published in the English language. 2.4. Exclusion Criteria Studies were excluded if: They were not conducted on human subjects. They were not published in the English language. 3. Data Extraction and Analysis Two independent reviewers assessed the titles and abstracts of all identified studies to determine eligibility. The full-text articles of potentially eligible studies were then obtained and reviewed in detail by the same reviewers. Any discrepancies between the 2 reviewers were resolved through discussion and consensus. The data was summarized qualitatively due to the heterogeneity of the included studies. 4. Risk Factors and Related Disorders MetS is associated with multiple risk factors, including various chronic diseases such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperglycemia, central obesity, and non-modifiable risks. Dyslipidemia, defined as abnormal lipid levels in the bloodstream, increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and can cause inflammation and oxidative stress [ 9 1 10 1 1 11 12 1 3 13 14 15 5. Diagnostic Criteria With the different definitions and diagnostic criteria suggested for MetS, difficulties have arisen in the comparison of data from studies, given the use of different criteria. Two major diagnostic criteria are used to define metabolic syndrome. Table 1 Table 2 5 16 6. Pathogenesis of Metabolic Syndrome Several mechanisms have been proposed for the development of MetS in the general population. These include insulin resistance, a chronic low-grade proinflammatory state, and neurohormonal changes [ 4 17 18 With insulin resistance, there is impaired lipolysis in adipocytes, leading to an increase in free fatty acids (FFAs). The accumulation of FFAs drives a paradoxical compensatory hyperinsulinemia in order to maintain euglycemia. Eventually, exhaustion of this mechanism occurs, which in turn leads to a decrease in insulin levels, further exacerbating the lipotoxic effects of FFAs [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 There are different opinions on the causation of the disease, as different risk factors are interrelated and complex [ 2 26 17 Individuals of older age have increasing rates of MetS when compared to younger individuals, and MetS itself is also involved in higher rates of aging. Aging is considered a biological process with progressive deterioration of physiological functioning. In MetS, there is a significant excess of reactive oxygen species, which in turn then to contributes to the aging process [ 27 28 29 30 7. Metabolic Syndrome in Older Adults Managing the risk factors of MetS is key in avoiding the manifestation of related diseases, primarily cardiovascular disease, and mitigating the onset of disability, poor quality of life (QOL), institutionalization, and premature death in older adults. Treatments that place emphasis on lifestyle changes (e.g., exercise and diet changes) and optimizing other social determinants of health (e.g., education, income, housing, access to quality food, and neighborhood walkability) are especially critical in managing MetS in the geriatric population. This is due to the large impact of suboptimal Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) on functional recovery and access, quality, and outcomes of care in this population [ 31 17 32 32 8. Adapting IHI 4Ms to Optimize Care of Geriatric Patients with Metabolic Syndrome In an effort to address the needs of the growing population of adults aged 65 and older, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) created a set of four elements considered critical to high-quality and age-friendly eldercare, termed the “4Ms.” It is defined as What Matters, Medication, Mentation, and Mobility [ 2 29 33 34 34 35 35 35 35 Figure 1 8.1. What Matters As MetS presents as a combination of risk factors for other serious conditions, the management of symptoms is vital for the health of the patient, via a care plan that aligns with the patient’s healthcare priorities and preferences. The treatment of older patients with MetS involves a holistic approach combining lifestyle changes such as activity level, controlling dietary intake, and, if necessary, pharmacotherapy. It is essential for providers to engage patients and their families in a shared decision-making framework, ensuring that therapeutic interventions align with the patient’s abilities, preferences, and willingness to participate. Treatment choices should be driven by conversations about what matters most to the patient and their families. Taking into consideration gender/sex, race, education level, geographic location, and occupation type, among other SdoH factors, will substantially influence patient adherence to treatment plans. Implementing and maintaining a diet for patients of lower socioeconomic status might present challenges, as well as medication and increased activity level adherence. The involvement of social workers is crucial for optimal management, as community-based and government-supported social services may be necessary to address economic barriers and other social determinants of health. These include food insecurity, lack of transportation, and financial assistance for medications. Combining what is important to patients with the effective use of standard treatment options and available community-based resources is key in managing MetS components and their associated multimorbidity and mitigating the onset of disability, frailty, and nursing home placement. 8.2. Medication The management of risk factors of MetS is primarily addressed by increasing exercise levels, adjusting dietary intake, and other positive lifestyle changes. However, medications are often needed for the optimal management of MetS risk factors and associated comorbidities. Pharmacological management to lower LDL Cholesterol, blood glucose, and/or blood pressure must be tailored to avoid compromising the patient’s mobility and mentation, while minimizing polypharmacy and the use of potentially inappropriate medications [ 17 36 37 Table 3 The specific treatment thresholds for the components of metabolic syndrome are as follows: Controlled dyslipidemia with triglycerides of less than 150 mg/dL and HDL cholesterol greater than 40 mg/dL in men or greater than 50 mg/dL in women [ 1 38 39 1 40 1 41 Patients at especially high risk may benefit from current weight loss drugs or bariatric surgery if it aligns with the care plan approved by both the provider and patient [ 17 42 43 44 Medications can also have a deleterious effect in the treatment of MetS and could potentially contribute to the worsened risk factors [ 45 46 47 48 45 49 50 There are several barriers to medication accessibility among elderly patients, including medication-related, patient-related, or healthcare-related. In some cases, older adults often misunderstand medication instructions due to polypharmacy, poor literacy, poorer vision, and memory issues [ 51 52 53 54 It Is recommended that dietary adjustments be made to the patient’s personal preference and energy needs while ensuring long-term sustainability [ 55 55 13 17 17 17 8.3. Mentation The prevention, identification, and treatment of cognitive issues are necessary in the aging population, especially in the context of MetS [ 34 56 57 Addressing the cognitive needs of patients requires regular assessments and evaluations to improve overall health outcomes. One medication often used when treating MetS is glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs). GLP1RA, developed to treat T2DM, has been found to possess some anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, part of the pathogenesis of various diseases [ 58 43 44 59 Beyond cognitive decline, there is a strong association between psychiatric disorders and MetS [ 56 60 61 60 62 60 8.4. Mobility Increasing mobility in older patients is vital in improving health outcomes in general. With patients with MetS, it is important to increase physical activity to promote weight reduction and palliate metabolic risk factors [ 13 17 63 17 64 65 64 32 34 9. Conclusions The multiple cardiometabolic factors comprising metabolic syndrome (MetS) are highly prevalent among older adults and represent significant, yet potentially modifiable, contributors to adverse health outcomes. These factors—such as central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance—often coexist and interact, amplifying the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and functional decline. This review underscores the importance of approaching treatment recommendations holistically, integrating not only medical management but also the patient’s social, economic, and environmental determinants of health. Effective management requires more than prescribing medications; it demands consistent engagement in lifestyle modifications that are tailored to each individual’s physical capabilities, preferences, and overall health care goals. By aligning interventions with the patient’s priorities and circumstances, clinicians can improve adherence, optimize long-term outcomes, and support healthy aging. The are several strengths to this review article. First, it uniquely applies the 4Ms framework and offers a geriatric-specific perspective. Second, it effectively highlights barriers that may influence medical management in older adults. Third, it draws on a wide range of recent literature and guidelines. Despite these strengths, it is important to acknowledge some limitations. First, this is a narrative review rather than a systematic review, which may introduce selection bias. Second, much of the evidence for MetS management is derived from studies in younger or mixed-aged populations. Third, disparities exist in the application of the 4Ms framework among clinicians. 10. Clinical Implications For optimal MetS management, we advocate that the care team addresses the multiple medical, functional, and social needs of the older patients through the lens of the IHI 4Ms Framework. The 4Ms Framework can best be operationalized during annual wellness visits to address patient and family concerns on general health, and also during chronic care management visits. This framework has been shown to lead to improvement in the process, quality, and outcome of eldercare. Collaboration with the patients is important in order to address individualized goals, optimize medication use, improve cognitive health, and promote mobility.
