Methods We performed an epigenome-wide analysis to identify the association of DNAm-derived LCRs with all-cause mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and lung-cancer-specific mortality in a large prospective cohort study with 17 years follow-up. Results Strong associations of multiple LCRs are seen for all mortality outcomes. The neutrophil-to-B-cell ratio was strongly associated with all-cause mortality (HR per SD increase, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10–1.31), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with cancer-specific mortality (HR, 1.28; 1.11–1.49), and the lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio with lung-cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.53; 0.38–0.75). The consistency of HR estimations across 11-year, 14-year, and 17-year follow-ups reinforces these findings. Several LCRs show stronger associations in females and younger participants. Conclusions Our study identifies DNAm-derived LCRs as particularly useful measures for quantifying cancer mortality risk over long-term follow-ups exceeding a decade. Plain Language Summary This study looked at how certain blood cell patterns estimated from DNA analysis, called leukocyte composition ratios (LCRs), relate to the risk of death from any cause, cancer, and lung cancer. We used data from a long-term study in Germany that followed people aged 50 to 75 for 17 years. LCRs were measured using a new method in blood samples. The results showed that some LCRs are strongly linked to higher or lower risk of death, especially from cancer and lung cancer. These findings suggest that assessment of LCRs could help identify people at higher risk of cancer death. Understanding these blood markers may improve health monitoring and disease prevention efforts in the future. Fan et al. analyze DNAm-derived leukocyte composition ratios (LCRs) in a large cohort with 17 years follow-up, assessing their associations with all-cause, cancer-specific, and lung-cancer-specific mortality. Several LCRs show strong, consistent associations, highlighting their value in long-term cancer mortality risk assessment exceeding a decade.

Additionally, we investigate how the length of follow-up affects the prognostic value of these DNAm-derived LCRs by analyzing the data over different follow-up periods. Methods Study design and population Our analysis is based on data from the ongoing ESTHER study (Epidemiologische Studie zu Chancen der Verhütung, Früherkennung und optimierten Therapie chronischer Erkrankungen in der älteren Bevölkerung, DRKS00014028), a population-based cohort study with baseline and long-term follow-up data collected in Saarland, Germany. Comprehensive details of this cohort, including study design and participants demographics, have been previously reported 17 19 DNA methylation analyses by epigenome-wide methylation arrays were performed in baseline blood samples of a total of 4195 participants in four batches in the context of preliminary projects between Oct 2012 and July 2019 17 20 22 Subset I Subset II Subset III Subset IV DNA methylation assessment The DNAm profiles for subsets I and II were analyzed using the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip kit (EPIC, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), while those for subsets III and IV were assessed with the Infinium Human Methylation450K BeadChip Assay (450 K, Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Both assays were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions and underwent preprocessing (Fig. S1 23 5 p Leukocyte composition estimation We estimated leukocyte composition using three algorithms: Houseman’s algorithm (HOU) with the minfi 9 ewastools 10 11 -10 Calculation of DNAm-derived LCRs We used DNAm-derived leukocyte composition data to calculate four inflammation-related biomarkers exclusively involving leukocytes (LCRs): neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte/monocyte ratio (LMR), (sum of neutrophils and monocytes)/lymphocytes ratio (sNMLR), and (product of neutrophils and monocytes)/lymphocytes ratio (pNMLR) 24 25 Statistical analysis We used descriptive statistics to summarize the baseline characteristics of the participants. Categorical covariates were described as absolute and relative frequencies, and continuous variables were described using medians and IQRs. In subsets I and IV, multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations between LCRs and 17-year follow-up mortalities, including all-cause mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and lung-cancer-specific mortality. Mortality from other specific cancers was not individually assessed due to case number limitations. For subsets II and III, which employed a case-cohort design, weighted Cox regression models were used, accounting for the sampling design with inverse probability weights 26 27 2 Given the variations in DNAm profiles assessment, owing to different time periods and DNAm chips used across the four subsets, results were presented separately and combined through random-effects meta-analysis. The meta-analysis for the SAL algorithm, which derives LCRs exclusively from EPIC DNAm data, was limited to subsets I and II. Sensitivity analyses were performed restricting the follow-up periods to 11- and 14-years, respectively. Additional models for lung cancer controlled for smoking pack-years instead of smoking status. We conduct additional sensitivity analyses by further adjusting—separately—for renal failure, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), rheumatoid arthritis, neurodermatitis, and NSAID use in the multivariable Cox regression models examining associations between DNAm-derived LCRs and 17-year all-cause, cancer-specific, and lung cancer–specific mortality (see Supplementary Data 1 3 Subgroup analyses were conducted to evaluate the association of DNAm-derived LCRs with mortality by sex and age groups (younger, 50–64 years old; older, 65–75 years old). We also tested for interactions of DNAm-derived LCRs with sex and age groups. All statistical analyses were executed using the R programming language (version 4.1.2) and R Studio (version 1.4.1717; Boston, USA).

Specifically, higher DNAm-derived NLR, sNMLR, pNMLR and lower LMR, as well as LCRs constructed with lymphocyte subtypes, were associated with poor prognoses. In general, these associations were more pronounced with lung-cancer-specific mortality than with all-cause mortality and all-cancer mortality. The consistency of HR estimations across 11-year, 14-year and 17-year follow-up periods further reinforces the robustness of these findings. Additionally, two DNAm-derived LCRs specifically predictive of lung-cancer-specific mortality showed stronger associations in females than in males. Twenty DNAm-derived LCRs associated with different mortality outcomes demonstrated stronger associations in younger participants compared to older ones. Particularly strong associations were seen for four LCRs (pNMBR, NCD4TR, sNMCD4TR, and pNMCD4TR) estimated by Salas’ algorithm with lung cancer mortality among younger participants. Cytological NLR has been shown to be significantly associated with all-cause mortality in general populations in the Netherlands 7 8 31 35 4 5 36 38 Our findings are consistent with previous results showing associations between LCRs and all-cause mortality. However, our results also show significant associations of DNAm-derived LCRs with cancer-specific mortality, particularly lung-cancer-specific mortality, which contrasts with the typically weak associations observed with cytological LCRs. DNAm-derived LCRs appear to offer advantages in evaluating long-term cancer-specific mortality due to their relations to both cancer incidence and methylation profile changes related to cancer mortality. Several studies examining both cytological LCRs in general populations 39 40 17 22 41 42 43 44 46 DNAm-derived LCRs offer a distinct advantage by enabling the analysis of LCRs involving specific lymphocyte subtypes, a capability not present in cytological LCR analyses. Recent research has shown a marked association of CD4T and B cells, as determined by the SAL algorithm, with both all-cause mortality and CRC-specific mortality among CRC patients 47 Cytological NLR is positively correlated with aging, and typically, females exhibit lower NLR values than males, suggesting reduced inflammation levels in younger individuals and females 3 The major strengths of this study include its population-based cohort study design, long-term mortality follow-up, comprehensive collection of health data, meta-analyzing data according to methylation measurement batch. Nonetheless, our study has several limitations. Firstly, the most crucial DNAm-derived LCRs are estimated using Salas’ algorithms, which were only applicable to subsets I and II that utilized the DNAm EPIC array. This limitation might reduce the statistical power and generalizability of our results due to a smaller sample size. Secondly, the absence of cytologic LCR measurements prevents direct comparison between cytologic and DNAm-derived LCRs in mortality outcome evaluation. Moreover, DNAm microarrays are a costlier method of measuring LCR compared to direct measurement from absolute blood counts, though these costs could potentially decrease with the advancement and application of targeted DNAm marker technologies. Thirdly, the limited number of specific cancer death events other than lung cancer hindered analyses of DNAm-derived LCR’s associations with other cancer mortality outcomes. Lastly, our study’s reliance on a single DNAm assessment point means that repeated measurements over time in future could provide more comprehensive insights. In conclusion, our study identified various DNAm-derived LCRs which are strongly associated with mortality outcomes. The DNAm-derived LCRs could be particularly useful measures to quantify all-cancer- and lung-cancer-specific mortality. Future research should focus on evaluating the utility of DNAm-derived LCRs in longitudinal aging studies that include younger participants and repeat DNAm measurements, as well as in clinical practice, in order to further explore prognostic value and potential clinical application in diverse settings. For example, the very strong associations of some of the LCRs with lung cancer mortality, especially at ages 50–64, which were observed even after adjustment for smoking in our study, may suggest their potential use for selecting high-risk people for lung cancer screening which should be explored in further research.
