See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ BACKGROUND Pancreatic cancer (PC), ranking among the most aggressive solid malignancies, currently lacks validated prognostic biomarkers to guide survival stratification. With a 5-year survival rate under 10%, this malignancy urgently requires precision tools for outcome prediction to optimize therapeutic decision-making. AIM To analyze whether the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) is a prognostic indicator for PC. METHODS Patients who were diagnosed with PC and underwent radical resection were included from January 2007 to January 2023 in a clinical center from National Cancer Center of China. The patients were divided into low and high ALI groups according to an ALI cut-off of 34.0 calculated with software X-tile. Overall survival (OS) and surgical outcomes were calculated between the two groups. Follow-up was conducted through telephone interview. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to estimate OS, while the log-rank test was utilized to compare OS among different tumor stages. Cox regression was used to identify independent risk factors for OS. RESULTS This study included 611 patients who underwent radical PC surgery. Using an ALI cutoff of 34.0, the patients were categorized into a high ALI group ( n n P P P P CONCLUSION Lower ALI is associated with worse OS for PC patients who underwent radical surgery. Patients demonstrating low ALI preoperatively require special attention from surgeons.

PC continues to portend grave prognosis, with population-based studies demonstrating 5-year survival rates hovering around 10%, which plummets to a dismal 3% in metastatic disease. Early detection remains elusive, as only 15%-20% of incident cases present with anatomically resectable tumors at initial diagnosis[ 1 3 4 6 7 8 10 Inflammation is closely linked to the progression and prognosis of cancer[ 11 13 14 15 16 20 However, research about ALI in PC is still limited. Only one study reported the effect of ALI on cancer-specific survival (CSS) in PC, and the number of included patients was 429[ 21 MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients Patients who were diagnosed with PC and underwent radical resection ( n n n n n 1 Figure 1 Study population enrollment flowchart with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data collection The collected baseline characteristics included age, sex, BMI, smoking and drinking status, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Alb, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, and ALI, as well as tumor location, stage, and size. Outcomes assessed were operation time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, and OS. Data were obtained from electronic medical records, outpatient visits, and telephone interviews. Definitions The definition of PC in this study followed the diagnostic criteria outlined in clinical guidelines. OS was defined as the period from surgery to death or loss to follow-up. ALI was calculated using the following formula: ALI = BMI × Alb/NLR, where BMI = weight (kg)/height² (m²), Alb = serum Alb (g/dL), and NLR = absolute neutrophil count/absolute lymphocyte count. The optimal cutoff values for the ALI were identified using X-tile software, based on the maximization of log-rank statistics for survival differences. This algorithm performs a systematic evaluation of all potential ALI thresholds via Treatment and follow-up All patients underwent radical surgery following standard principles, with R0 resection confirmed pathologically. Follow-ups were conducted regularly thereafter. Follow-up protocols documented OS, disease recurrence, and vital status through telephone interviews, with data censoring occurring at 5-year postoperative milestone or mortality event, whichever came first. Statistical analysis Continuous variables, presented as the mean ± SD, were compared using an independent-sample t χ via P RESULTS Patients A total of 611 patients who underwent radical PC surgery were included based on the eligibility criteria. The average age was 60.7 ± 9.3 years, with 344 males (56.3%) and 267 females (43.7%).

DISCUSSION A total of 611 patients who underwent radical PC surgery were included in this study. The low ALI group had significantly lower BMI, serum Alb, lymphocyte count, and ALI, but higher neutrophil count, a higher proportion of head and neck PC, and longer operation time. Although there was difference in baseline information, Cox analysis was conducted. As for prognosis, the low ALI group had worse OS in stage I patients, and ALI was identified as an independent risk factor for OS. ALI has demonstrated predictive value in various diseases in previous studies and has shown strong prognostic significance in tumors[ 22 25 21 The relationship between ALI and prognosis might be mediated through several biological mechanisms. In cancer patients, a prolonged systemic inflammatory response could impair the normal function of the immune system and disrupt tumor immune surveillance[ 26 27 28 29 30 32 via This study provided new evidence supporting the use of ALI as a prognostic tool for PC. Given its easy accessibility and low cost, ALI could serve as a simple and practical indicator to assist clinicians in predicting patient survival and the risk of disease progression, particularly in the treatment decision-making process. For patients with a low ALI, enhanced preoperative evaluation and postoperative follow-up should be implemented to enable timely interventions and adjustments in treatment strategies, ultimately improving the quality of life and prognosis. However, the clinical application of ALI still faces several challenges, and while ALI demonstrated strong prognostic value in this study, its applicability across different PC stages and treatment modalities remains uncertain. Future large-scale, multicenter prospective studies are necessary to validate our findings. Additionally, combining ALI with other biomarkers could further enhance the accuracy of prognostic predictions. Overall, this study is the first to investigate the impact of ALI on OS in PC, with a relatively large number of patients. ALI is clinically significant as a comprehensive marker that effectively assesses both immune and nutritional status in patients. Our findings would provide more precise guidance for individualized treatment in PC. ALI might be an important supplementary indicator for other prognostic factors, and more comparisons are needed to verify whether ALI can replace other prognostic indicators. However, there are some limitations to this study. First, the current study was conducted with a retrospective design at a single center, which may limit the broader applicability of the findings. Future multicenter, large-sample, prospective studies are necessary to validate the value of ALI in PC. Additionally, this study focused on the relationship between ALI and OS, and future research could explore the association between ALI and other clinical outcomes ( e.g. CONCLUSION For PC patients undergoing radical surgery, lower ALI levels independently predict worse OS, underscoring the imperative for surgical teams to closely monitor such cases preoperatively.
