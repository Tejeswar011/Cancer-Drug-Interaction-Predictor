Here, we investigate the impact of RAD21L deletion, a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, on the 3D genome architecture and gene expression in the male germ line. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we demonstrate that RAD21L deficiency impairs meiotic chromatin organization and inter/intrachromosomal interactions. This conspicuous 3D genome reorganization also disrupts bouquet formation, resulting in increased telomeric interactions between heterologous chromosomes in primary spermatocytes. Genome reorganization was accompanied by detectable transcriptional dysregulation in spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, mainly affecting sex chromosomes. Collectively, our findings establish the cohesin RAD21L as a germline-specific critical regulator of genome-wide 3D genome reorganization during spermatogenesis and a modulator of the male germline transcriptional landscape. Deletion of the meiotic subunit RAD21L alters 3D chromatin structure and transcription in the mammalian male germ line. http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030 Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca 2021SGR00122 http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003030 Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca 2021SGR01127 http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329 Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad CGL2014-54317-P http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329 Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad CGL2017-83802-P http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329 Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad BES-2015-072924 http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837 Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación PID2020-112557GB-I00 http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837 Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación AEI/10.13039/501100011033 http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837 Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación PRE-2018-083257 http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837 Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación PID2023-152857NB-I00 Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies Ministerio de Educación FPU18/03867 http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014180 Junta de Castilla y León CSI148P20 http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014180 Junta de Castilla y León CSI017P23 http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837 Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación PID2020-115696RB-I00, PID2023-151484NB-I00 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes INTRODUCTION The hierarchical organization of the genome undergoes dramatic changes during gametogenesis ( 1 4 5 7 Meiosis entry is accompanied by fundamental changes in chromosome nuclear distribution, DNA methylation, histone modifications, and transcription ( 1 8 9 1 4 1 10 Meiotic cohesin subunits (i.e., REC8, RAD21L, STAG3, or SMC1β) play a critical role in chromosome architecture during prophase I ( 11 13 13 15 16 17 11 18 19 Meiotic cohesins are loaded at active promoters in both primary spermatocytes and round spermatids ( 1 11 1 20 21 22 Here, we investigate the impact of RAD21L deletion on three-dimensional (3D) genome architecture and transcription in the mouse male germ line by integrating fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), genome-wide high-throughput chromosome conformation capture analysis (Hi-C), and single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We demonstrate that loss of RAD21L disrupts proper chromatin condensation during meiosis, leading to altered genome compartmentalization and changes in the balance of inter- and intrachromosomal interactions in both premeiotic (spermatogonia) and meiotic (primary spermatocytes) cells. In addition, we observe defects in bouquet formation, characterized by increased telomeric interactions between heterologous chromosomes in primary spermatocytes. Moreover, this genome reorganization is accompanied by transcriptional dysregulation, detectable from the spermatogonia stage onward. Our findings establish a dual role for RAD21L in gene regulation and chromatin reorganization during early meiosis, providing direct evidence of its function in transcriptional control in both spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes. RESULTS Deletion of RAD21L-containing cohesin complexes reshapes chromatin reorganization in premeiotic and meiotic cells We analyzed the effects of cohesin deletion in chromatin architecture during mammalian spermatogenesis using mice deficient in one of the meiosis-specific kleisins, RAD21L [hereafter RAD21L knockout (KO)] ( 11 12 Fig. 1A Fig. 1B 11 1 3 4 10 23 Fig. 1. Higher-order chromatin structure. ( A B C D Rad21l +/+ Rad21l −/− E P s F P s As expected for a meiotic-specific cohesin subunit, RAD21L deficiency did not affect higher-order chromatin features in somatic cells, as exemplified in the genome-wide interaction maps, distance-dependent interaction frequency, and inter/intrachromosomal interaction ratio plots in fibroblasts ( Fig. 1, B to E Fig. 1, C and D Specifically, spermatogonia from KO mice showed increased mean levels of inter/intrachromosomal interaction ratios (0.80 ± 0.10) when compared to WT spermatogonia (0.33 ± 0.05), resembling the somatic-like pattern observed in fibroblasts (0.78 ± 0.09) ( Fig. 1C Fig. 1D Fig. 1, E and F 1 24 27 As meiosis progressed, further architectural differences became apparent in early primary spermatocytes (L/Z). In KO mice, there was an increase in interchromosomal interactions when compared to WT mice, which was translated into higher mean rates of inter/intrachromosomal interaction ratios (0.56 ± 0.05) when compared to WT (0.23 ± 0.01) ( Fig. 1, C and D Fig. 1E P s 28 Fig. 1F Together, these observations indicate that RAD21L deletion induces notable structural reorganization of the genome in both spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, resulting in dynamic alterations in chromosome occupancy and folding. RAD21L counteracts nuclear compartmentalization in prophase I Compartmentalization was also affected by RAD21L deletion ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2, A and B 1 3 4 10 23 Fig. 2, A and B r 2 Fig. 2B 11 Fig. 2. Changes in chromosomal compartmentalization and heterologous interactions. ( A B r 2 C D E P F P G H I J K Rad21l Given prior cytological evidence of abnormal telomere attachment to the nuclear envelope in RAD21L-deficient spermatocytes ( 11 12 29 30 1 3 4 Fig. 2C Fig. 2C P Fig. 2, C to G Fig. 2F P Fig. 2E Telomere clustering into the bouquet facilitates homolog alignment and pairing via cytoplasmic microtubule movements ( 29 31 Fig. 2H Fig. 2, I and K P Fig. 2, J and K Rad21l To further investigate higher-order chromatin dynamics at the submegabase scale, we identified TADs and examined boundary robustness using TADbit ( 32 Fig. 3A 33 Fig. 3B Fig. 3. Variation at the fine scale. ( A B TADs were well defined in fibroblasts and spermatogonia with differences between genotypes depending on the cell type. As expected, we did not detect major changes in fibroblasts, where TADs were detected with similar insulation scores between WT and KO fibroblasts (Mann-Whitney test, P Fig. 3, A and B Fig. 3A P Fig. 3B In primary spermatocytes, TAD boundary strength was reduced in both WT and KO mice compared to earlier stages (i.e., spermatogonia) ( Fig. 3B Fig. 3A 1 3 4 23 P Fig. 3B To explore the molecular basis of these changes, we performed a multiassociation analysis comparing conserved and altered TAD boundaries in WT and KO primary spermatocytes with RAD21L-binding sites (see Materials and Methods). We found a positive association between altered TAD boundaries and the presence of RAD21L, whereas conserved boundaries did not show this enrichment (fig. S3I). These findings suggest that RAD21L contributes to the dynamic regulation of TAD architecture during the transition from premeiotic to meiotic stages, potentially by mediating cohesin replacement at specific genomic loci. RAD21L deficiency alters transcriptional landscapes of key meiotic genes To assess the impact of RAD21L deletion on gene expression at single-cell resolution, we performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis using the 10x Genomics platform on whole testes from WT and KO mice at postnatal day 55 (see Materials and Methods). After quality filtering, we retained a total of 5250 WT and 6248 KO single cells for downstream analyses. Annotation of cell types was performed as previously described ( 34 Fig. 4 Fig. 4A 11 12 Fig. 4, B and C Fig. 4. Single-cell transcriptome analysis. ( A B C D 34 E F 2 n n G 2 n n H To further resolve the heterogeneity of early germ cell populations, we performed iterative clustering and annotation, identifying three spermatogonial subtypes: undifferentiated (e.g., Sox4 Tubb5 Stra8 Uchl1 Ccnd1 Esx1 Prdm9 Smc1b Sycp3 Sycp1 Hormad1 Piwil2 Spata16 Spink2 Fig. 4D 34 In KO mice, transcriptional profiles were predominantly restricted to spermatogonial subtypes (undifferentiated spermatogonia, differentiated spermatogonia 1, and differentiated spermatogonia 2) and early primary spermatocytes (L/Z stages). Notably, markers of late prophase I and postmeiotic stages were undetectable ( Fig. 4E To assess the functional consequences of RAD21L deletion, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in spermatogonia and L/Z primary spermatocytes between WT and KO mice. We detected a mild effect on gene transcription, with a total of 377 DEGs (189 up-regulated and 188 down-regulated) in spermatogonia and 606 DEGs (288 up-regulated and 318 down-regulated) in L/Z primary spermatocytes ( Fig. 4, F and G Rplp1 35 Rpl10 36 Rps4x 36 Adcy10 37 Ybx3 38 Ddx4 39 Tdrd1 40 Morc2b 41 Mael 42 Kdm3a 43 Smarca4 44 Tuba3b 45 Cfap43 46 Spag6l 47 Fig. 4H Given that the transcriptional profile of spermatogonia was already altered in Rad21l Mesp1 Nfat5 Hspa8 Prpf38B Rpl5 Rpl10 Bag6 Npm1 Stra8 Ybx3 Nipbl Stk33 This widespread transcriptional misregulation was accompanied by global alterations in chromatin architecture. We observed distinct transcriptional and structural differences between RAD21L-binding genes (9646) and RAD21L-free genes (22,549) (see Materials and Methods and fig. S7). Although overall expression differences between WT and KO primary spermatocytes were modest, RAD21L-binding genes were slightly but significantly up-regulated in KO cells (Mann-Whitney test, P P Fig. 5, A and B Fig. 5. Multicomparison genomic analysis. ( A B 2 C Fig. 3A D 2 E Consistent with our characterization of LRIs, DEGs were positively associated with KO-specific LRIs and negatively associated with both WT-specific and stable LRIs—the latter defined as long-range interactions present in both WT and KO spermatocytes. Notably, KO-specific LRIs were significantly enriched at merged TAD regions, referred to adjacent TADs that appear fused in KO ( Fig. 3A Fig. 5, C to E Together, our findings indicate that genome reorganization resulting from RAD21L deletion strongly correlates with transcriptional changes. Dysregulated genes in KO mice were predominantly located within accessible chromatin regions (A compartments enriched in H3K4me3), where the formation of long DNA loops appears to promote novel heterologous long-range interactions, potentially disrupting gene transcription ( Fig. 5E Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation is impaired in RAD21L-deficient mice A defining feature of sex chromosomes is their transcriptional silencing during prophase I, a phenomenon known as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) ( 48 1 10 Fig. 6 Fig. 6, A to C r 2 Fig. 6C 1 Fig. 6B Fig. 6. Transcriptome misregulation of sex chromosomes. ( A B 2 C D E P F This aberrant higher-order chromatin restructuring was accompanied by up-regulation of genes located on the X and Y chromosomes ( Fig. 6D Fig. 6D Zfy2 49 Taf7l 50 Fmr1 51 Fig. 6E Fig. 6F DISCUSSION The formation of mammalian germ cells involves extensive chromatin remodeling, orchestrated by regulatory pathways that remain poorly understood. Using an integrative approach combining FACS, Hi-C, and single-cell RNA-seq, we define how RAD21L deficiency disrupts 3D genome architecture and transcriptional regulation in the male germ line. Our results revealed that RAD21L plays multifaceted roles during meiosis, influencing several hierarchical levels of chromatin organization: (i) nuclear compartmentalization, (ii) inter- and intrachromosomal interactions, (iii) long-range interactions, (iv) DNA loop formation, (v) bouquet formation, and (vi) transcriptional regulation of key meiotic genes ( Figs. 5E 7 Fig. 7. Structural and transcriptomic changes in RAD21L-deficient germ cells. ( A B RAD21L is a meiosis-specific kleisin subunit of the cohesin complex with all known functions executed as part of this complex rather than independently. It forms a distinct cohesin assembly by associating with SMC3, STAG3, and either SMC1α or SMC1β, consistent with the established structural paradigm for kleisin-containing cohesins. In this study, we demonstrate that RAD21L is a critical determinant of chromatin structure during early spermatogenesis at multiple levels, not only involved in the formation of TADs and DNA loops but also at the level of A/B compartments, inter/intrachromosomal interactions, and nuclear chromosome occupancy ( Fig. 7A Rad21l 25 27 As Rad21l 28 52 Meiotic cohesins provide a structural foundation for chromosome axis formation ( 13 53 54 11 54 Fig. 7A 1 3 10 23 55 56 57 58 2 11 59 28 Furthermore, cohesin deletion also resulted in the impairment of the formation of two other major structural features specific to meiosis: (i) bouquet formation and (ii) MSCI. The formation of the bouquet structure in early prophase I stages is essential for successful synapsis between homologs and proper resolution of recombination events ( 19 60 61 Rad21l 11 53 Likewise, we observed impaired γH2AX accumulation on sex chromosomes in RAD21L-deficient mice, accompanied by misregulation of XY-linked genes during early prophase I. It is well established that X chromosome silencing during prophase I is accompanied with distinct higher-order chromatin reorganization, including increased intrachromosomal over interchromosomal interactions, attenuation of compartmentalization, and a reduction in both the number of TADs and associated signal intensity at the onset of prophase I ( 1 4 62 63 64 65 Rad21l Fig. 7B Our findings also highlight a critical role for cohesin in transcriptional regulation within the germ line. While recent studies have demonstrated cohesin’s involvement in transcriptional control in somatic cells ( 66 21 58 67 69 Rad21l Fig. 7B 70 58 66 69 71 72 1 1 Summarizing, we demonstrate that RAD21L deficiency induces transcriptional alterations beginning in premeiotic STRA8-positive cells (i.e., differentiating spermatogonia 1), consistent with the early expression of Rad21l 24 27 Sycp3 Ybx3 Zfy2 Zfy2 73 74 Zfy2 Rad21l All in all, our study reveals the dual structural and regulatory roles of meiotic cohesins in orchestrating the extensive chromatin reorganization that occurs during the formation and differentiation of the mammalian male germline. We uncover a previously unidentified mechanistic dimension of RAD21L-containing cohesins, suggesting roles that extend beyond their canonical functions in meiosis. Specifically, RAD21L appears to contribute to germ cell development through regulatory mechanisms distinct from its classical role in assembling the cohesin axis, which supports axial element formation and facilitates synaptonemal complex assembly during chromosome synapsis. While our model does not yet capture the full complexity of protein-protein interactions and additional factors influencing chromatin architecture, our data show that RAD21L deletion alters the behavior of specific genomic regions in a transcription-dependent manner. Further investigations into the mechanisms underlying these changes will provide new insights into how cohesins-mediated 3D genome organization governs gene expression during germ cell formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and cell lines We processed Rad21l −/− Rad21l 11 A primary fibroblast cell line was established from a Rad21l −/− 2 g Spermatocyte spreads and immunofluorescence To obtain spermatocyte spreads, testicular biopsies were obtained immediately after dissection and processed, as previously described ( 75 Immunostaining of spermatocytes was performed as previously described ( 75 FACS of mouse male germ cells Testicular disaggregation from RAD21L-deficient mice was conducted as previously described ( 1 g g Germ cells were sorted using a BD Influx (BD Biosciences) coupled with an ultraviolet laser (355 mm). Because meiosis arrests at a zygotene-like stage in RAD21L-deficient mice ( 11 54 g The enrichment of each flow-sorted population was evaluated by the immunodetection of specific meiotic proteins. Spermatogonia were assessed with an anti-CD90.2 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec, #130-102-452; 1:10 dilution) and DAPI morphology, whereas L/Z population was distinguished using a mouse antibody against SYCP3 (Abcam, #97672; 1:200 dilution) and a rabbit antibody against γH2AX (Sigma-Aldrich, #H5912; 1:400 dilution) (fig. S1). Briefly, an aliquot of cells was fixed on slides with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and further processed for immunofluorescence. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C, and secondary antibodies (all from Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:200 dilution) were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. DNA was counterstained with antifade solution (VECTASHIELD) containing DAPI (8 μg/ml). Slides were analyzed using an epifluorescence microscope (AxioPhot, Zeiss) coupled with a ProgRes CS10plus (Jenoptik camera), and images were captured using ACO XY program (A. Coloma, Open Microscopy). Between 80 and 100 cells from each population were analyzed, and only populations with a cell enrichment above 80% were used in subsequent experiments. In nuclei Hi-C Hi-C libraries were generated following standard procedures ( 1 g g After digestion, cells were centrifuged at 2000 g g g For library preparation, samples were first sonicated for 30-s on, 90-s off, 4 cycles, and low mode (three times). Subsequently, biotinylated fragments were pulled down using Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 beads. Briefly, beads were washed with 2× binding buffer [10 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, and 2 M NaCl] and 0.05% Tween 20 in 1× binding buffer. Beads were then resuspended with 1× binding buffer, mixed with the sonicated samples and incubated for 30 min at RT under rotation. After two washes with 1× binding buffer, samples were resuspended with the end repair mix (1× NEB T4 DNA ligase buffer with 10 mM ATP, 0.5 mM dNTP mix, 50 U of NEB T4 PNK, 12 U of T4 DNA polymerase I, and 5 U of Klenow) and incubated for 30 min at RT to repair ends and remove biotin from unligated ends. Beads were then washed twice with 1× binding buffer, resuspended with the dATP attachment mix (1× NEBuffer 2, 0.5 mM dATP, and 2.5 U of NEB Klenow exo minus), and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Subsequently, beads were washed twice with 1× binding buffer, resuspended in 1× NEB Quick ligation reaction buffer together with the NEBNext adapter and Illumina adapters, and incubated 15 min at RT to ligate adapters to chromatin ends. Following, beads were washed twice with 1× binding buffer, resuspended with tris buffer, and mixed with 1 μM primer P5, 1 μM primer P7, and cocktail master mix (NEB). A final amplification was performed following the PCR program: 98°C for 30 s; 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s × 8 cycles; and 72°C for 5 min. The beads were then captured on a magnet, and the supernatants with the amplification products were transferred to a tube. A 1:1 amount of Ampure Beads was added to the samples and incubated for 10 min at RT. The beads were then washed twice with 70% ethanol, eluded with tris buffer, and incubated for 5 min at RT. Ampure Beads were lastly separated on a magnet, and the solution was transferred to a tube. The quality and concentration of the libraries were checked by Qubit and the Agilent Bioanalyzer System. Libraries were submitted for Illumina sequencing (paired-end 150 bp each side on NovaSeq 6000). Hi-C data processing, binning, and normalization BBDuk (version 09/2019) ( 76 77 32 Binning and data normalization were conducted using an in-house script that imports the “HiC_data” module of TADbit to bin the reads that passed the filtering step into a square matrix of 50 kbp. Then, 500 kbp matrices were created and subsequently processed with HiCExplorer (version 3.7) ( 78 2 2 Averaged contact probability P s Contact probability P s 6 28 Inter- and intrachromosomal interaction analysis Normalized 500-kbp matrices were transformed into GInteraction tables using HiCExplorer, which includes interaction values between all genomic bins genome-wide. Mean pairwise interchromosomal interactions for each chromosome were plotted as a heatmap where yellow and green colors represent higher interaction levels, whereas dark blue tones represent lower interactions. Mean interactions of interchromosomal and intrachromosomal interactions for each chromosome were also used to calculate inter/intrachromosomal interaction ratios using RStudio. Interchromosomal interactions by pairwise chromosomes were also plotted along chromosome length. Intercentromeric and intertelomeric interaction quantification The GInteraction tables were also used to quantify interchromosomal interactions between centromeres and telomeres. Centromeric regions were defined as the first 3.5 Mb of each chromosome, whereas telomeric regions were defined as the last 3.5 Mb of each chromosome, regardless of chromosomal size. Only interactions between centromeric or telomeric regions of different chromosomes were considered for the quantification of intercentromeric and intertelomeric interactions. Long-range interchromosomal interactions LRIs were defined as previously described ( 10 z 79 80 A/B compartmentalization A/B compartments were defined from the first eigenvector values, which were calculated from normalized 500-kbp matrices using the package FAN-C (version 0.9.14) ( 33 A/B compartmentalization was then pairwise compared between genotypes and cell types using 500-kbp bin resolution. Bins were divided into four categories: AA (bins that were A compartments in both genotypes), BB (bins that were B compartments in both genotypes), AB (bins that were A compartments in WT cells but B compartments in KO cells), and BA (bins that were B compartments in WT cells but A compartments in KO cells). TAD calling and insulator score TADs were called from 500-kbp resolution matrices using the function find_tads from TADbit with default parameters. TADs were compared between genotypes and classified as stable (when overlapping between TADs was higher than 75%), merged, split, or rearranged. Insulator score was calculated using the package FAN-C (version 0.9.14) ( 33 Single-cell RNA-seq, data processing, filtering, and normalization Testicular disaggregation from Rad21l +/+ Rad21l −/− 1 Cell Ranger (version 6.1.2) was used to map the single-cell RNA-seq reads against the mouse annotation (version GRCm39) using default settings. Mapped data were subsequently analyzed with the Seurat package (version 4.3) ( 81 Raw counts were then normalized using the sctransform package implemented in Seurat, which calculates Pearson residuals from regularized negative binomial regression. Sctransform omits the need of pseudocount addition or log transformation and improves downstream analysis ( 82 Dimensionality reduction, cell type assignation, and data integration For visualization of single-cell RNA-seq data, dimension reduction was performed on normalized datasets following Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP). For this, the principal components analysis (PCA) was first calculated using the first 50 PCs, and then the UMAP was computed with specific parameters (dims = 1:50, n.neighbors = 100, and min.dist = 0.5). Cells were labeled using the R package SingleR (version 2.2) ( 83 34 34 Normalized WT and KO datasets were integrated as previously described ( 84 Differential gene expression analysis Differential gene expression analysis was performed in spermatogonia and L/Z cells comparing WT and KO mice. For the analysis of spermatogonia, cells that were labeled as “undifferentiated spermatogonia,” “differentiating spermatogonia 1,” or “differentiating spermatogonia 2” using the emptyDrops approach ( 34 34 To detect DEGs between WT and KO cells, the function FindMarkers from Seurat was used, specifying the sctransform normalization method. Only genes with an absolute log 2 P DEGs were visualized in MA plots representing the log 2 Classification of RAD21L-binding genes and RAD21L-free genes Available chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data for RAD21L ( 1 5 85 Gene ontology enrichment analysis GOEA was performed using DAVID ( 86 87 P Multiassociation analysis Statistical association between different genomic features was performed as previously described ( 5 88 z z P Z P 8 8 8 1 1 1 5 Statistics and reproducibility In determining sample sizes, we made all possible efforts to minimize animal suffering. To isolate spermatogonia and spermatocytes for Hi-C experiments, the number of mice was determined based on the number of germ cells required for Hi-C ( 1 Statistical analysis and P P U P Acknowledgments Funding: 10.13039/501100011033 Author contributions: Competing interests: Data and materials availability: GSE297600 GSE297601 GSE132054 GSE49624 Supplementary Materials This PDF file includes: Figs.
