The sample size was calculated using data from a previous similar study. With a significance level of 0.05, 80% power, and an effect size of 0.5 for the primary outcome of postoperative pain score reduction, 90 patients (30 per group) were required. 4 additional patients were enrolled to account for potential dropouts, thus the final sample size for this study was determined as 94 patients. The study is a prospective randomized controlled trial. The patients were divided into the Control group ( n n n P the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual 15 1  Table 1 Baseline characteristics of 3 groups Control ( n TPVB ( n Combine ( n F/χ 2  P Gender 1.233 0.540 Male 16 (48.48) 15 (50.00) 19 (61.29) Female 17 (51.52) 15 (50.00) 12 (39.71) Age (yrs) 66.33 ± 5.28 66.10 ± 7.03 65.93 ± 7.22 0.030 0.970 BMI (kg/m 2 24.58 ± 3.56 24.43 ± 2.97 24.83 ± 6.46 0.059 0.942 TNM stage 2.700 0.845 I 1 (3.03) 2 (6.67) 3 (9.68) II 21 (63.64) 18 (60.00) 15 (48.39) III 10 (30.30) 8 (26.67) 11(35.48) IV 1 (3.03) 2 (6.67) 2 (6.45) Tumor type 0.167 0.920 Colon cancer 19 (57.58) 18 (60.00) 17 (54.84) Rectal cancer 14 (42.42) 12 (40.00) 14 (45.16) Methods Upon entering the operating theatre, all three groups of patients were subjected to vital signs monitoring by pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, and invasive arterial blood pressure. Afterward, anesthesia was induced in all 3 groups: intravenous sufentanil 0.3–0.4 µg/kg, propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg, and rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg. After induction, a single-lumen tracheal tube was inserted orally, and connecting to a ventilator to control breathing in VCV mode. Mechanical ventilation parameters: VT 6-8 ml/kg for two-lung ventilation, VT 5-6 ml/kg for one-lung ventilation, RR 12–14 times/min, and maintenance of PET CO 2 Before the induction of anesthesia, patients in the TPVB group and the control group were treated with TPVB. patients were placed in the lateral position, and an ultrasound high-frequency probe was placed parallel to the long axis of the spine in the midline of the bilateral levels of the thoracic paraspinal vertebrae T11-12 of the patients, and then the probe was slowly moved outward until the adjacent transverse processes and the corresponding paraspinal interspaces were visible. An in-plane puncture method was used to guide a 20G nerve block needle into the Bilateral lumbar paravertebral spaces at a depth of about 3–4 cm, and 0.25% ropivacaine was injected at 1.5-2 mg/kg after withdrawal of no blood or cerebrospinal fluid, reduced for the elderly and infirm patients. The block plane was tested with a cotton swab after the completion of the block for 10 min, and if there was no sensory reduction in any spinal innervated area, it was regarded as a failure of the nerve block, and this case was rejected. The Control group did not have the TPVB. Postoperatively, all patients were treated with intravenous analgesia, which was prepared as follows: nalbuphine 40 mg, diluted to 100 ml in saline, with a background dose of 1.5 ml/h, an additional dose of 2 ml, and a locking time of 15 min. To ensure patient privacy, all patient information will be de-identified prior to analysis.

This outcome can be attributed to the anti-oxidative stress properties of ropivacaine used in TPVB, which can effectively inhibit the expression levels of ACTH, COR and other stress factors, and effectively block the pain signaling induced by them [ 23 24 25 26 Compared with the Control group, the recovery of hemodynamic indexes in the TPVB and Combine groups after the intervention was more significantly restored. TPVB blocks nerve conduction in the corresponding region, reducing stimulus transmission, while general anesthesia regulates the circulatory and respiratory systems, promoting vasodilation and maintaining stable blood pressure [ 27 11 28 29 30 31 32 This study also found that the improvement of MMSE scores in the Combine group was more obvious compared to the TPVB group. The reason for this was that the perioperative hemodynamic stabilization by s-ketamine effectively increased the cerebral blood flow of the patients, which was helpful for the recovery of cognitive function. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between ropivacaine in TPVB and general anesthetics in S-ketamine reduced the required doses of propofol and remifentanil, minimizing the risk of brain remodeling and neuronal apoptosis [ 33 34 35 In conclusion, TPVB combined with S-ketamine is effective in eliminating patients’ pain and stress while stabilising their haemodynamics during anaesthesia and facilitating the rapid recovery of cognitive function and daily living ability after surgery, especially for patients requiring multimodal analgesia to achieve rapid recovery and improved quality of life. However, this study has several limitations. First, the sample size was small, which may affect the generalizability of the results. Larger multicenter studies are needed to validate our findings. Second, the patients were from a single institution, potentially causing selection bias. Third, the NRS relied on for pain assessment may introduce subjective variability in reporting. Future research should address these issues to confirm the combined intervention’s efficacy and safety in broader clinical settings.
