Although symptoms improve after treatment, objective functional recovery has not previously been reported. We present a 52‐year‐old male heavy smoker with right upper lobe adenocarcinoma and hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy causing profound grip strength impairment (5/2 right/left kilogram‐force (kgf)). Genetic testing identified the KRAS KRAS Complete resection of KRAS‐positive lung adenocarcinoma with hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy resulted in immediate symptom relief and progressive grip strength recovery from 5/2 kgf preoperatively to 40.9/32.9 kgf at 3 months, providing first objective documentation of functional recovery in HPO. clubbed finger hand strength KRAS protein lung neoplasms osteoarthropathy pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:02.10.2025  T.

He had painful joint edema in both upper and lower extremities. He could not put on his shoes due to arthritis and pain in his feet and could not perform adequate grasping movements due to pain in both hands. He had no medical or family history and was taking non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for joint pain. He had smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for 30 years and worked in the construction industry with dust exposure. General physical examination revealed clubbed fingers and toes and painful edema of both lower extremities and knees (Figure 1 2 3 3 FIGURE 1 Physical examination findings. (A, B) Preoperative clubbed fingers with painful edema. (C, D) Images 7 days post‐surgery showing persistent clubbing but decreased edema with increased finger creases. FIGURE 2 Hand x‐rays showing periosteal proliferation before surgery (A) and 1 week after surgery (B), with resolution at 1 year (C). Periosteal proliferation was detected before and 1 week after surgery, but had disappeared by 1 year after surgery. FIGURE 3 Computed tomography (CT) images showing a large tumor in the right upper lobe of the lung and enlarged hilar lymph nodes. Positron emission tomography‐CT findings showed intense accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose in the pulmonary mass, and mild accumulation in the hilar lymph nodes and bilateral ankles and toes. The patient underwent right upper lobectomy (operative time 259 min, blood loss 200 mL) and histopathological examination showed acinar‐predominant adenocarcinoma (pT3N0M0 Stage IIB). Multiplex and compact panel genetic testing detected KRAS 1 2 4 2 FIGURE 4 Changes in grip strength before and after surgery. The patient's grip strength had returned to a functional level by the third postoperative day and to a normal adult level by 3 months. The dotted line indicates the 28 kgf grip strength threshold, one of the diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia in men. 3 Discussion This case demonstrates rapid symptomatic relief and progressive functional recovery following lung cancer resection in a patient with HPO. Although joint symptom improvement is well‐established [ 3 4 1 5 6 In patients with HPO syndrome, bone scintigraphy typically shows bilateral, symmetrical peripheral uptake in the long bones [ 5 7 8 9 10  KRAS 11 12 12 13 EGFR ALK ROS1 KRAS 14 15 16 17 18 KRAS 18 This case provides the first objective demonstration of functional recovery of HPO and offers insights into the disease pathophysiology.
