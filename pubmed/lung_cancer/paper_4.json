Introduction Quinazolinone and its derivatives are important heterocyclic compounds commonly found in various bioactive molecules ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Chemical scaffold of quinazolinone compounds Heterocyclic compounds represent an important class of organic chemicals. These compounds contain one or more heteroatoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur, along with carbon atoms, forming a ring structure. Their properties are largely influenced by the number and type of heteroatoms within the ring ( 13 The term 'cyclic' refers to the presence of at least one ring, whereas 'hetero' indicates that non-carbon atoms, or heteroatoms, are part of that ring ( 14 15 16 17 The basic structure of quinazolinone consists of a quinazoline ring and a ketone group. This bicyclic compound contains a pyrimidine ring fused with a benzene ring at the 4 and 8 positions ( 18 19 Fig. 1 20 21 Adhatoda vasica 22 23 24 25 in vitro 26 Acanthaceae 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 Quinazolinones can be classified by structural features into six main groups: Those substituted at the 2- and/or 3-positions, simple 2-substituted quinazolin-4-ones and quinazolinones fused with pyrrole, pyrroloquinoline, piperidine or piperazine ring systems ( 36 37 38 The pharmacological properties of quinazolinone-based compounds can be optimized by modifying their central structure with various functional groups. For instance, introducing alkyl ( 39 40 41 Biological activities of quinazolinone compounds In synthetic and medicinal chemistry, the quinazoline scaffold has attracted considerable interest due to its simple synthesis, versatile reactivity and broad pharmacological potential ( 42 43 44 Natural quinazolinone compounds, derived from plants, animals and microorganisms and widely used in traditional medicine, often have complex structures that have been refined through natural selection and evolutionary processes to produce unique biological activities ( 45 46 47 43 48 By contrast, the structural design of chemically synthesized quinazolinone-based drugs often involves modifications to the natural structure, with researchers selectively altering specific molecular sites (such as positions 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8) through chemical functionalization ( 49 50 52 Although quinazolinones display a wide range of biological activities, this review focuses specifically on their anti-tumor properties, particularly the mechanisms through which they induce tumor cell death. It summarizes key quinazolinone derivatives known to induce cell death and aims to provide insights for designing structures that help elucidate the mechanisms involved in tumor cell death. 2. Quinazolinone and its derivatives in inducing cell death Apoptosis Apoptosis is a gene-regulated, self-controlled and orderly form of cell death that maintains internal homeostasis ( 53 54 55 The intrinsic pathway is mainly triggered by internal signals such as cellular stress, DNA damage or oxidative stress. It involves the release of pro-apoptotic factors, including cytochrome c, from mitochondria, which activate caspases that execute cell death. Proteins of the Bcl-2 family are central regulators of this pathway, controlling mitochondrial membrane permeability ( 56 57 Over the past decade, most quinazolinone derivatives have been shown to induce apoptosis through intrinsic pathways, including mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways ( Table I Fig. 2 et al 58 et al 59 Wani et al 60 60 et al 61 et al 62 et al 63 et al 64 A smaller group of quinazolinone derivatives induce apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway. HMJ-38 [2-(3'-methoxy phenyl)-6-pyrrolidinyl-4-quinazolinone], a quinazolinone derivative, inhibits tubulin polymerization. Hour et al 65 et al 66 67 Ferroptosis Ferroptosis is a regulated form of cell death first identified in cancer cells with oncogenic Ras mutations. It is characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation ( 68 69 70 71 − 72 73 Table II Fig. 3 Erastin, a piperazinyl-quinazolinone compound, is a well-known ferroptosis inducer ( 74 − 75 76 77 78 et al 79 80 81 82 Organelle-targeted photosensitizers (PSs) are promising in enhancing photodynamic therapy, as they generate ROS under light exposure in the presence of oxygen. Zhao et al 83 83 84 3-(2,4-Dichloro-5-methoxyphenyl)-2,3-dihydro-2-thioxo-4(1H)-quinazolinone (Mdivi-1) is a quinazolinone derivative and a selective inhibitor of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). In cold stress-induced liver injury, Mdivi-1 reduces malondialdehyde levels, increases GSH and GPX4 levels, inhibits mitochondrial fission and effectively mitigates ferroptosis ( 85 86 Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), in conjunction with mitochondrial-derived ubiquinone, exogenous vitamin K and NAD(P)H/H + 87 in vivo 88 In the search for new therapies for uveal melanoma, coumarin-quinazolinone-phenylboronic acid has been developed as a prodrug to induce ferroptosis by targeting elevated ROS and tyrosinase levels in melanoma cells ( 89 90 Autophagy Autophagy is a conserved cellular process that plays an essential role in maintaining homeostasis by degrading damaged or unnecessary organelles and proteins ( 91 92 93 94 95 Table III Fig. 4 Kumar et al 96 96 97 Dichroa febrifuga 98 Certain quinazolinone derivatives can also inhibit autophagy. For instance, MJ-33 initiates autophagy at the vesicle nucleation stage by activating ATG proteins but decreases the LC3/LC3-II ratio and increases p62 levels, suggesting suppression of autophagic flux. In HT-29/5FUR cells, this suppression enhances MJ-33-induced apoptosis ( 99 et al 100 Senescence Cellular senescence is generally an irreversible arrest of cell proliferation in damaged normal cells that have exited the cell cycle. It is associated with widespread macromolecular alterations and a secretory phenotype linked to chronic inflammation ( 101 102 103 Table IV Fig. 4 104 105 Kamal et al 106 107 Necrosis and pyroptosis Necrosis is an abnormal form of cell or tissue death caused by external factors such as trauma, hypoxia, infection or injury. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 has been identified as a key regulator of necroptosis, a programmed form of necrosis activated by stimuli such as TNF, TNF superfamily member 10 (also known as TRAIL), lipopolysaccharide, oxidative stress or DNA damage ( 108 109 Pyroptosis is a regulated form of cell death mediated by gasdermins and characterized by continuous cell swelling, plasma membrane rupture and the release of intracellular contents that trigger inflammatory and immune responses ( 110 111 Table IV Fig. 4 In BALB/c mice, administration of two new quinazolinone compounds, 4(3H)-quinazolinone-2-propyl-2-phenylethyl and 4(3H)-quinazolinone-2-ethyl-2-phenylethyl, caused abnormal kidney function. Quinazolinones can affect sulfhydryl groups, disrupt protein structures, generate reactive metabolites and free radicals, and damage organelles such as tubular membranes, mitochondria and peroxisomes, ultimately leading to cell necrosis ( 112 Mdivi-1, a quinazolinone-derived compound, has been shown to reduce necroptosis- and pyroptosis-related protein expression, including NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) and gasdermin D N-terminus (GSDMD-NT), in cardiomyocytes of rats with myocardial infarction, thereby improving cardiac function in post-MI rats ( 113 et al 114 in vitro 115 116 3. Application of quinazolinone derivatives in cancer therapy Quinazolinone and its derivatives have attracted considerable attention in recent years for their ability to induce cell death in various cancer types, representing a promising therapeutic approach. As single agents, these compounds act through multiple mechanisms, including apoptosis, autophagy and ferroptosis. To enhance therapeutic efficacy and address challenges such as drug resistance and toxicity, increasing efforts have focused on combining quinazolinone derivatives with other pharmacological agents. This strategy not only amplifies their anti-tumor effects but also enables more targeted interventions, potentially reducing adverse effects. The following section discusses the clinical prospectssss of quinazolinone and its derivatives in combination therapy, emphasizing their synergistic effects when used with conventional chemotherapeutic agents and molecular targeted therapies. Combination with platinum-based drugs Studies have shown that co-treatment with cisplatin and Mdivi-1 synergistically enhances apoptotic cell death in both intrinsically and acquired cisplatin-resistant tumor cells, including MDA-MB-231 breast cancer, H1299 non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma, cholangiocarcinoma and A2780cis cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells ( 117 118 117 et al 118 119 Combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) MJ-33, a quinazolinone derivative, exhibits anti-tumor activity by reducing the viability of 5-FU-resistant HT-29 colon cancer cells. It induces apoptosis and autophagy through the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, offering potential therapeutic value in 5-FU-resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) ( 76 Lai et al 120 Combination with gemcitabine HMJ-38 promotes both autophagy and apoptosis in MIA-RG100 pancreatic cancer cells and demonstrates cytotoxic effects against gemcitabine-resistant cells. The mechanism involves activation of the EGFR-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, which induces autophagy, and the mitochondrial pathway, which facilitates apoptosis ( 65 121 Combination with temozolomide Targeting the catalytic domain of PARP-1, a series of quinazolin-2,4(1H,3H)-dione derivatives have been synthesized as PARP-1 inhibitors. Zhou et al 122 123 124 Combination with paclitaxel Ucleotide binding oligomerization domain containing 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 receptors, which contain nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains, are emerging as potential immune checkpoints. In a study by Ma et al 125 125 4. Quinazolinone derivatives approved by the FDA or under clinical investigation Idelalisib Idelalisib (Zydelig™; CAL-101; Gilead Sciences), with the chemical name 5-fluoro-3-phenyl-2-((1S)-1-(9H-purin-6-yl-amino)propyl)quinazolin-4(3H)-one, has the molecular formula C 22 18 7 126 127 128 Idelalisib has shown clinical efficacy in indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and was approved by the FDA in 2014 for monotherapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma. It is also approved in combination with rituximab for the treatment of CLL ( 129 130 131 132 133 Despite its clinical benefits, idelalisib carries a black box warning from the FDA due to the risk of severe or fatal adverse events, including hepatotoxicity, diarrhea, colitis, pneumonia and intestinal perforation ( 134 135 136 137 138 139 Ispinesib Ispinesib, a quinazolinone-derived compound, is a selective inhibitor of kinesin spindle protein (KSP) and functions as an allosteric modulator of KSP motor ATPase activity. By inhibiting KSP, ispinesib disrupts mitotic spindle formation, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ( 140 20 141 142 142 143 In clinical studies of breast cancer, Ispinesib has shown some antitumor activity, with an ORR of 9% ( 144 145 146 147 In glioblastoma, resistance to ispinesib is closely associated with the activation of STAT3. STAT3 mediates anti-apoptotic and metabolic effects through dual phosphorylation by Src and EGFR, thereby promoting drug resistance that can be reversed by simultaneously inhibiting Src and EGFR ( 148 149 150 Nolatrexed Nolatrexed [2-amino-6-methyl-5-(4-pyridylthio)-4(3H)-quinazolinone] is a thymidylate synthase inhibitor primarily developed for the treatment of HCC. In patients with unresectable HCC, nolatrexed achieved a median overall survival of 22.3 weeks, with an ORR of 1.4% and a median PFS of 12 weeks ( 151 152 153 Nolatrexed, a 4(3H)-quinazolinone derivative, has shown promising efficacy in clinical trials, exhibiting typical antimetabolite-related side effects such as short duration of action and low toxicity, along with mucositis, vomiting, diarrhea and thrombocytopenia ( 151 154 155 20 Halofuginone Halofuginone is a synthetic derivative of a quinazolinone alkaloid with the chemical name 7-bromo-6-chloro-3-(3-(3-hydroxy-2-piperidinyl)-2-oxopropyl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone ( 156 20 157 158 159 20 Up to date, clinical investigations of halofuginone have primarily focused on exploring its safety and tolerability rather than establishing overall therapeutic efficacy, and no specific data on ORR, PFS or DOR have yet been reported. Nonetheless, its antitumor potential has been demonstrated in several experimental models. For instance, in anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), halofuginone significantly suppresses ATC cell proliferation and tumor growth by inhibiting the enzyme-prolyl-tRNA synthetase-activating transcription factor 4-collagen type I signaling axis ( 160 161 162 163 164 in vitro 165 Febrifugine Febrifugine is the active antimalarial compound isolated from the traditional Chinese herb Chang Shan, which has been used for centuries to treat malaria-induced fevers ( 166 167 169 170 50 μ 168 in vivo 171 172 173 Table V 5. SAR of anticancer quinazolinone compounds SAR studies of quinazolinone derivatives reveal a close association between molecular structure and biological activity. Structural optimization and the introduction of various substituents can effectively modulate anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetic stability and targeting specificity. The substitution sites of quinazolinone are shown in Fig. 1 The 2- and 3-positions are key sites for SAR studies, as they directly influence selectivity, potency and cellular activity. In anticancer compounds, substituents at positions 2 and 3 are predominantly sulfur ethers and aryl ketones, as seen in the investigational drug ispinesib. Electron-withdrawing groups at the meta position, such as halogens and trifluoromethyl, generally enhance inhibitory activity against EGFR, as exemplified by the quinazoline-based drugs gefitinib and erlotinib, which contain −Cl and −CF 3 174 Substituents at the 6- and 7-positions typically target the solvent-exposed regions or entry channels of the ATP-binding pocket ( 175 176 50 174 et al 177 in vivo Substitution at the 5-position is relatively uncommon, as introducing substituents at this site may increase steric hindrance. However, it shows specificity for cytotoxic agents, such as the protein kinase inhibitor idelalisib and the dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor nolatrexed ( 20 et al 178 178 Table VI Fig. 5 6. Discussion This review examined the structure, applications and mechanisms of cell death induced by quinazolinone and its derivatives. Quinazolinone is a multifunctional heterocyclic compound that has attracted considerable attention for its promising biological activity ( 179 180 181 182 Although quinazolinone and its derivatives show considerable potential in cancer therapy, several challenges and unresolved issues remain. First, the chemical synthesis of quinazolinones still relies heavily on high temperatures and harsh reaction conditions, and generates numerous by-products ( 183 184 185 4 186 in vivo 187 188 189 Quinazolinone molecules can interact with fluorescent dyes through covalent coupling, electrostatic adsorption, or coordination bonding. These interactions allow real-time tracking of drug delivery in vivo 190 Acknowledgements Not applicable. Availability of data and materials Not applicable.

The numbering in panel B indicates the substitution sites of quinazolinone. Figure 2 Mechanism of quazolinone compounds inducing cell death through apoptosis. i) In the extrinsic pathway, the death ligand-receptor interaction triggers apoptotic signaling and forms the DISC complex, activating the Caspase-8/-3 cascade, leading to cell apoptosis (HMJ-38 induces apoptosis through the Fas/Death receptor-Caspase-8 pathway and is regulated by p53/ATM signaling). ii) In the intrinsic pathway, quinazolinones downregulate Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and upregulate Bax/Bad, thereby promoting cytochrome c release, Apaf-1 apoptosome formation and Caspase-9/Caspase-3 cascade activation (QC suppresses Bcl-2, promotes the translocation of Bax into the mitochondria, releases Cyt C and activates Caspase-9. MITC-12 upregulates the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and increases Caspase-3 expression. The analogs synthesized by Madbouly et al 61 Figure 3 Mechanism of quazolinone compounds inducing cell death through ferroptosis. i) System Xc − 3+ 2+ − Figure 4 Mechanism of action of Quinazolinone compounds in pyroptosis, autophagy and cellular senescence pathways. i) In the senescence pathway, telomere shortening and limited telomerase function activate the p53/p21/p16 pathway, causing G1 phase arrest and cellular senescence 3-(2-(hydroxymethyl) phenyl)-2-methylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones upregulate the expression of TRF1, POT1 and p53/p21/p16, and inhibit telomerase, inducing cells to enter a senescence phenotype]. ii) In the pyroptosis pathway, NLRP3 assembles with ASC and procaspase-1 to form the inflammasome, activating caspase-1, which mediates the maturation of IL-1β and IL-18, and induces pyroptosis through GSDMD, forming membrane pores. Quinazolinone derivatives can inhibit this process by blocking NLRP3 inflammasome activation and the release of inflammatory factors (Mdivi-1 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation, reduces the activation of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and the level of GSDMD-NT, and decreases the release of IL-1β and IL-18). iii) In the autophagy pathway, ATG family proteins mediate phagophore nucleation and extension. LC3 is modified by ATG4 and ATG7, transforming into LC3-II, which promotes autophagosome formation and fusion with lysosomes for substrate degradation (DQQ and HF promote LC3-II generation, enhance ATG5-ATG12 complex formation and promote autophagy. MJ-33 initiates autophagy by activating ATG proteins during vesicle nucleation but reduces the LC3/LC3-II ratio and increases p62 levels, inhibiting autophagy).
