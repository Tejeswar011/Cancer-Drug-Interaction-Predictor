This phenomenon has been widely studied in neuroendocrine, thyroid, and prostate cancers but remains unexplored for melanin-targeting radiopharmaceuticals in metastatic melanoma. [ 131 Results We conducted an ex vivo biodistribution study using syngeneic murine melanoma models (B16-F10, B16-OVA, B16BL6) and correlated tumor volume with radiopharmaceutical uptake. In models, γ-counting revealed significant tumor uptake (18.8 ± 4.5 IA%/g at 24 h after injection of [ 131 Conclusion These findings suggest that tumor burden impacts [ 131 Graphical abstract  Keywords Tumor sink effect Murine melanoma models Targeted radionuclide therapy [ 131 In vivo pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction The ‘tumor sink effect’, introduced by Beauregard et al., describes the sequestration of a radioligand by a tumor, leading to a reduction of its bioavailability in healthy tissues and, consequently, a reduction in the radiation dose absorbed by critical organs [ 1 2 5 The tumor sink effect has been extensively studied in clinical trials of TRT-PSMA [ 6 8 68 68 9 3 10 [ 131 11 16 131 17 NCT03784625 In addition to the melanin found in pigmented melanoma cells, [ 131 18 The ocular toxicity data described in a previous preclinical study [ 14 131 Methods Study design and murine models B16-F10 and B16-OVA (MO4) murine melanoma cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, USA) and Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany), respectively. The B16BL6 cell line was kindly provided by Dr. I.J. Fidler (Texas, USA). B16-OVA cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Dutscher, Bernolsheim, France), non-essential amino acids (1X), 10 mM HEPES (1 M), 54 µM β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mg/mL geneticin (50 mg/mL). B16-F10 and B16BL6 cells were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 4 µg/mL gentamicin (50 mg/mL,). Except for FBS, all culture reagents were purchased from Gibco® (ThermoFisher Scientific, Strasbourg, France). Cells were maintained in culture at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere composed of 20% O 2 2 Mice experiments were approved by local Ethic committee of Clermont-Ferrand and French Ministry of Education and Research (Approval N° 37,046). Female C57BL/6 J mice, 5 weeks old, were obtained from Charles River (L’Arbresle, France). In order to better reflect the heterogeneity observed in patients with metastatic pigmented melanoma, we have selected three murine melanoma cell lines with different pigmentation profiles and at different stages of tumor development [ 19 5 5 131 131 Radio-synthesis of [ 131 [ 131 20 21 131 −1 2 2 5 −1 131 131 Analytical high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements were performed on a system consisting of a Shimadzu HPLC combined with an UV detector and a gamma detector (Lablogic, software LAURA).

Briefly, organs (liver, lungs, eyes, kidneys and tumor) were collected, fixed and embedded in paraffin. Five μm-thick sections were cut and adhered to poly-L-Lysine-coated glass microscope slides. After deparaffinization and rehydration, slides were incubated in ammoniacal silver solution and dyed in the dark at 56 °C for 30–60 min. After washing with distilled water, the samples were treated with 0.2% gold chloride solution for 30 s and in 5% sodium thiosulfate solution for 2 min. The samples were mounted and histological images were acquired with the Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner and the ZEISS Colibri 7 camera. Brown or black particles in the tissue indicate the presence of melanin. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses and graphical representation were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 10.3.1, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Continuous variables were presented as mean ± 95% confidence interval (CI).

However, the study in mouse models is subject to several limitations. One of the limitations relies on the effect of the tumor burden as a function of the weight of the animal and the transposition of pre-clinical data into clinical data. Sakata et al. evaluated the whole-body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of five 11 18 23 Another limitation of our approach is the assessment of biodistribution by organ sampling. It would be relevant to compare these data with a SPECT/CT imaging method in therapeutic studies by analyzing the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at different times after injection on an individual basis. However, given the characteristics of iodine-131 (gamma radiation: 364 ​keV, 81.5%), it is imperative that rigorous calibration and optimization of the camera are performed to ensure robust quantification of the images, particularly for the evaluation of small organs such as the eye [ 24 25 131 131 In the development of [ 131 177 26 Finally, it is essential to assess the sink effect in relation to the evolution of the disease during the treatment cycles and therefore the available targets (new metastatic lesions or reduction of targets, necrotic zones, release of targets into the vasculature following apoptosis of tumor cells). Conclusions This first preclinical study evidenced a tumor sink effect in melanin-targeting radiopharmaceutical therapy.
