Objective To evaluate associations between Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and systemic comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and dietary patterns, aiming to identify modifiable risk factors and inform therapeutic strategies. Design Case-control study integrating a cross-sectional survey with a retrospective chart review conducted at a tertiary referral center. Subjects The cohort included 100 individuals from the Cornea Service at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary: 50 patients with FECD and 50 age- and sex-matched controls within a 10-year range. Four controls were excluded due to protocol adherence. Methods Data collection involved chart reviews and a validated 152-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. Smoking and exercise behaviors were assessed through structured questionnaires. Nutrient intake was adjusted for energy using the residual method. Thus, the energy-adjusted intake estimate is the residual from a regression model in which total energy intake is the independent variable and absolute nutrient intake is the dependent variable. Statistical comparisons included Wilcoxon rank-sum and Fisher exact tests ( P Main Outcome Measures Prevalence and statistical significance of systemic comorbidities, lifestyle behaviors, and dietary intake associated with FECD. Results Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy was associated with hyperlipidemia (74% vs. 50%, P P P P P P P P P P Conclusions Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy exhibits significant associations with cardiovascular comorbidities, cumulative tobacco exposure, and specific nutritional factors. The identified associations suggest possible directions for future intervention studies as on cardiovascular management, smoking cessation, and dietary modification.

XOPS-D-25-00205. Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a degenerative corneal disease characterized by endothelial dysfunction, marked by a decreased endothelial cell density, the presence of guttae, and the loss of endothelial barrier and pump function. 1 1 1 Although the phenotype of FECD is defined based on ophthalmic clinical findings, it is increasingly recognized that systemic health factors may influence its pathophysiology. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 5 4 , 6 4 , 7 Additionally, FECD is more prevalent in women, with estrogen-dependent oxidative stress pathways proposed as a contributing factor. 8 , 9 The current study aims to address these gaps by examining associations between FECD and systemic comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and dietary intake. By integrating data from nutritional and lifestyle surveys with medical chart reviews, this study seeks to identify actionable risk factors and provides a foundation for future research into the systemic context of FECD. Methods Study Design and Recruitment This case-control study combined a cross-sectional survey alongside a retrospective chart review. Patients with FECD were recruited from the Cornea Service and control patients from the Comprehensive and Cataracts Eye Service at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary during routine new or follow-up visits to the clinic. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The inclusion criteria for the group with FECD were clinical diagnosis of FECD. The control group comprised individuals without FECD and no guttae on slit lamp examination, matched to participants with FECD by age (within 10 years) and sex. A total of 104 patients were included, and 4 patients (2 cases and 2 controls) were excluded because the questionnaire was not returned. A total of 100 patients were analyzed (50 case and 50 control); 4 control patients were excluded due to the case-control matching protocol. Paper-based questionnaires were completed in person by participants. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary and it adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Chart Review Medical chart review collected data on demographics (age, race, sex, height, and weight), medical history, and FECD stage using a modified Krachmer scale. 10 , 11 11 Body mass index in kg/m 2 Nutritional and Lifestyle Questionnaires Nutritional intake was assessed using a validated 152-food-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (SFFQ) ( Supplemental Appendix 1 www.ophthalmologyscience.org 12 12 Survey responses were processed by the Nutrition Questionnaire Service Center at the Harvard School of Public Health where daily intake of individual nutritional factors was computed by assigning a daily frequency weight using an internal database. For nutrition analysis, an energy-adjustment of nutrition factors was performed using the residual method. 13 14 15 There exist disease-risk models, and formulations of these models are available to account for energy intake in epidemiologic analyses, including adjustment of nutrient intakes for total energy intake by regression analysis (residual model) and addition of total energy to a model with the nutrient density (nutrient density model: nutrient divided by energy). The nutrient-residual (energy-adjusted) model, however, offers the advantage that it can be used as an alternative to using the nutrient densities model to control for confounding by total energy intake and to remove extraneous variation due to energy intake. The residual model uses regression analyses to compute residuals of nutrient intake by removing the variation caused by total energy intake. 15 Exercise and smoking behavior were assessed by a lifestyle questionnaire ( Appendix 2 www.ophthalmologyscience.org Statistical Methods Statistical analysis was performed using Stata standard edition version 17.0 (StataCorp LLC). Descriptive statistics, including mean and standard deviation, were calculated for continuous variables. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparisons of continuous variables, and Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables between FECD and control groups. Statistical significance was set as P Results Demographics The mean age was 67.7 ± 9.6 in the FECD group and 68.3 ± 9.2 years in the control group ( P P 2 2 P Table 1 Table 1 Demographic Characteristics, FECD Stage, and Comorbidity FECD Cases Control Cases P Patients (n) 50 50 Age, mean ± SD (range), yr 67.7 ± 9.6 (49–90) 68.3 ± 9.2 (47–82) 1.000 Female sex, n (%) 32 (64%) 32 (64.0%) 1.000 Race White, n (%) 50 (100%) 48 (96%) 0.495 Black, n (%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Indian, n (%) 0 (0%) 1 (2%) Asian, n (%) 0 (0%) 1 (2%) FECD-modified Krachmer stage, mean ± SD (range) 2.7 ± 1.2 (1–4) n/a Stage 1, n (%) 9 (18%) n/a Stage 2, n (%) 17 (34%) n/a Stage 3, n (%) 19 (38%) n/a Stage 4, n (%) 5 (10%) n/a Comorbidity Hypertension 34 (68%) 25 (50%) 0.103 Hyperlipidemia 37 (74%) 25 (50%) 0.023 Coronary artery disease 10 (20%) 4 (8%) 0.148 Congestive heart failure 6 (12%) 1 (2%) 0.112 Atrial fibrillation 13 (26%) 4 (8%) 0.031 Peripheral vascular disease 3 (6%) 0 (0%) 0.242 Aortic stenosis 5 (10%) 1 (2%) 0.204 Carotid disease 1 (2%) 1 (2%) 1.000 Diabetes mellitus, type 2 5 (10%) 5 (10%) 1.000 History of stroke 5 (10%) 1 (2%) 0.204 BMI, kg/m2, mean ± SD 26.5 ± 5.5 ∗ 26.2 ± 4.9 ∗ 0.879 Dietary supplement use (yes), n (%) 33 (66%) 21 (42%) 0.027 BMI = body mass index; FECD = Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy; n/a = not applicable; SD = standard deviation.

Additionally, this study pioneers the investigation of nutritional factors in FECD, addressing a critical gap in existing research. These findings underscore the interconnected nature of systemic health and FECD pathophysiology, highlighting the potential for targeted interventions such as cardiovascular risk management, dietary modifications, and smoking cessation to slow disease progression. Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for future studies to explore the mechanistic pathways linking systemic health, nutrition, and FECD, with the goal of advancing both preventive and therapeutic strategies. In this study, the FECD group exhibited significantly higher rates of cardiovascular diseases, with statistically significant differences observed in hyperlipidemia and atrial fibrillation, as well as trends toward significance in congestive heart failure, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. These findings align with a prior small case-control study, 5 16 17 Additional studies incorporating physiologic sodium measurements are needed to validate and strengthen this observation. Interestingly, the study finds a higher caloric intake in patients with FECD, yet lower total fat (g) and monounsaturated fat (g) amount in the FECD group. Contrastingly, the FECD group does not show a consecutively higher carbohydrate or protein intake compared with the control group. Oleic acid, tea oil, almond oil, and nut oil are commonly used as monounsaturated fatty acids in the daily life of human beings. 18 19 20 21 The results of our study reinforce the need for further research to explore the interplay between cardiovascular health, diet, and FECD, with potential implications for patient counseling and risk factor management. Regarding diabetes, there was no increased occurrence of the condition in patients with FECD in this study; however, a trend toward significance was noted in the daily intake of insulinogenic load of carbohydrates. Diabetes mellitus has been previously linked to morphological, ultrastructural, and functional abnormalities in the endothelium as well as reduced endothelial cell density. 22 , 23 4 6 It is crucial to recognize that the associations observed between FECD and diagnostic comorbidities are influenced by several limitations. Indeed, diagnoses were obtained from the electronic medical record review, and both accuracy or availability of these data may vary. Furthermore, there is potential for selection bias to confound case-control association studies—patients in the case (FECD) and control group may be more likely to have acquired additional nonocular diagnoses by virtue of the participation in both ocular and nonocular health care. In this comprehensive study, we compared multiple variables between the 2 groups without adjusting for multiple comparisons; therefore, the reported associations should be considered exploratory. The SFFQ used in this study is validated and has been used in prior studies to associate nutritional parameters in various studies as, for example, in linoleic acid and gluten intake with diabetes disease 24 , 25 26 Moreover, the use of minerals and vitamin supplement produces additional complexity, as the nutrients from supplements are typically not correlated with energy intake. 14 Patients in the FECD case group reported significantly higher supplement use compared with controls, which may reflect counseling during clinical visits encouraging a healthier lifestyle, including vitamin intake. To provide a comprehensive view of nutritional intake, dietary data excluding supplements are also reported ( Appendix 3 This study strengthens the previously established link between smoking and ocular diseases including FECD pathophysiology. 3 , 27 28 29 30 31 1 4 7 , 32 , 33 34 4 7 35 , 36 The role of nutrition in FECD pathophysiology has been theorized based on parallels to age-related macular degeneration, 1 , 37 37 38 39 40 , 41 This study lends additional data to emerging understanding of systemic health factors that may be associated with FECD. Based on observations in this study, it may be advisable to counsel patients with FECD on screening for concomitant cardiovascular disease, moderating salt intake to manage cardiovascular risk, and smoking cessation. Further investigations using larger datasets will be essential in refining these recommendations for patient care. References 1 Ong Tone S. Kocaba V. Böhm M.
