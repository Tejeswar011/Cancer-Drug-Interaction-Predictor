Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have significantly improved survival outcomes and quality of life in patients with various malignancies. Nevertheless, their associated toxicities must not be overlooked. Although not the most common immune-related adverse event (irAE), CIP is recognized as one of the most serious. In particular, grade 3–4 CIP that is not promptly treated may compromise subsequent immunotherapy and can result in respiratory failure or even death. Legionnaires Legionella pneumophila Legionella pneumonia Legionella Case summary We report the case of a patient with squamous cell lung cancer who developed severe pneumonia following combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy. The initial working diagnosis was immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonia (ICI-P) complicated by bacterial infection. However, sputum-targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) subsequently identified Legionella pneumophila Legionella pneumophila Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) Herpesvirus-1 (HSV-1). Legionella pneumophila EBV HSV-1 Conclusions In the era of chemoimmunotherapy, the presence of pulmonary ground-glass interstitial lesions should prompt consideration not only of immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonia (ICI-P) but also of infections caused by uncommon pathogens such as Legionella Legionella pneumonia metagenomic next-generation sequencing (tNGS) co-infection quinolones immune checkpoint inhibitors Medical and Health Science and Technology Development Project of Shandong Province 10.13039/501100019446 202403020298 The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Numerous clinical studies conducted both domestically and internationally have demonstrated that ICIs can improve the prognosis of patients with various malignancies, offering new hope in oncology. However, immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) has emerged as one of the most common and potentially serious immune-related adverse events. Among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the overall incidence and severity of CIP are notably higher compared to those with other tumor types. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonia (CIP) has been reported in 2.6% to 33% of patients ( 1 5 The clinical diagnosis of CIP remains challenging due to the absence of definitive mechanisms or molecular diagnostic criteria. Typically, patients without evidence of infection present with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging, accompanied by dyspnea and/or other respiratory symptoms ( 6 7  Legionella pneumophila 8 Legionnaires 9 L. pneumophila 10 Legionella pneumonia 11 Legionella pneumonia 12 13 Here, we report a case of a patient with locally advanced lung cancer who developed Legionella pneumonia Case presentation A 70-year-old male farmer with a one-month history of biopsy-confirmed lung cancer was admitted to our department on February 4, 2025, due to a three-day history of fever. His past medical history included cerebral infarction (7 years ago, without significant sequelae), chronic hepatitis B (diagnosed 5 years ago and managed with oral tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 25 mg once daily), type 2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 5 years ago, controlled with glimepiride), and recently diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for about one month. The patient reported a 50-year smoking history (approximately 20 cigarettes/day) and occasional alcohol consumption over the past 40 years. He had received one cycle of combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy (paclitaxel, cisplatin, and tislelizumab) on January 24, 2025. Physical examination on admission: The patient’s body temperature was 37.8 °C, pulse 88 beats/min, respiratory rate 19 breaths/min, and blood pressure 122/74 mmHg. Auscultation of both lungs revealed coarse breath sounds with audible wet rales, while dry rales were absent. Three days prior to admission, he developed a fever (maximum temperature 38.5 °C) accompanied by chills, a cough with scant white sputum, and mild exertional dyspnea. There were no reports of hemoptysis, night sweats, or fatigue. Initial laboratory investigations at a local hospital on February 4 revealed leukopenia (WBC 1.85×10 9 9 + 9 Methylprednisolone was escalated to 80 mg twice daily. Antimicrobial therapy was broadened to include meropenem (1 g every 8 hours), oral voriconazole (200 mg every 12 hours), and intravenous immunoglobulin. Despite high-flow oxygen therapy, hypoxemia persisted (PaO2 57.3 mmHg, SpO2 88.3%). Given the patient’s immunocompromised status and the possibility of concomitant bacterial infection, vancomycin (500 mg every 8 hours) was added to the treatment regimen, and non-invasive ventilation was initiated. Due to progressive respiratory failure and the development of urinary incontinence, the patient was transferred to the Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU). Despite the use of high-dose corticosteroids and broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, and fungi (including piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, voriconazole, and vancomycin),the patient showed no significant clinical improvement. The broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy and glucocorticoid anti-inflammatory treatment demonstrated poor efficacy. At this stage, there was increasing concern that the condition was not merely immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonia (ICI-P) combined with a common bacterial infection. The antibiotics and treatment regimen in use did not appear to adequately cover the causative pathogen. On February 13, sputum-targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS, Shilu Medical) identified Legionella pneumophila Enterococcus faecalis Epstein–Barr virus Human herpesvirus 1  Table 1 Legionella pneumophila Legionella pneumophila Legionella Legionella pneumophila EBV HSV-1 Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) HSV-1 EBV HSV- Enterococcus faecium E. faecium E. faecium Table 1 tNGS result (sputum).

Methylprednisolone was gradually tapered. The patient showed marked clinical improvement, with resolution of hypoxemia (oxygen saturation improved to 96% on 60% high-flow oxygen) (  Figure 1  Figures 2  4  Figure 5  Figure 6 Legionella Figure 1 Major changes in the condition and adjustments to the treatment plan. Timeline of medical treatment from February 4 to April 12, 2025. It begins with hospital admission for fever on February 4. Initial treatment includes Piperacillin-tazobactam and Methylprednisolone. Adjustments are made based on disease progression and symptoms like dyspnea and urinary incontinence, with treatments including Vancomycin, Meropenem, Moxifloxacin, and others. Transfer to RICU follows, with detection of Legionella and EBV on February 13. Chest CT shows improvement on February 24, leading to discharge on February 26. Post-discharge involves chemotherapy suspension and resumption, and oral Moxifloxacin. April 12 marks chemotherapy resumption, with prior CT showing lesion absorption.

Discussion Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have markedly improved the prognosis of patients with various malignancies; however, immune-related adverse events (irAEs) remain a major clinical challenge. Among them, immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonia (CIP) is one of the most severe complications, often necessitating treatment discontinuation and even carrying a risk of mortality. In the present case, a 70-year-old patient with lung cancer developed severe pneumonia following chemoimmunotherapy, which was initially suspected to be CIP. However, further diagnostic evaluation confirmed Legionella pneumophila  Legionella 14 15 Legionella pneumonia Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 16 17 9 Legionella pneumonia ( 18 20 Legionella Despite its environmental ubiquity, clinical infection remains uncommon. Known risk factors include age >50 years, male sex, smoking, alcohol abuse, immunosuppression, and pre-existing cardiopulmonary diseases ( 21 23 24 Legionella 5 21 23 25 26 Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (CIP) is a relatively common and potentially life-threatening immune-related adverse event (irAE) in lung cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy. The incidence of CIP in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is estimated at 3. 1%, significantly higher than in other malignancies such as melanoma or urothelial carcinoma (2.0%) ( 24 24 25 5 26 27 In this case, an elderly male with squamous cell lung carcinoma developed fever and interstitial lung changes after receiving chemoimmunotherapy (paclitaxel, cisplatin, and tislelizumab). He had a substantial smoking history and comorbid COPD. Initial imaging revealed diffuse interstitial infiltrates without focal consolidation. Given his recent exposure to tislelizumab, concurrent bone marrow suppression, and elevated inflammatory markers, immune-related pneumonitis with possible bacterial co-infection was initially suspected. Accordingly, empirical therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam and methylprednisolone was initiated. However, the patient ‘s condition worsened, with persistent fever, rising inflammatory markers, and progression to respiratory failure, necessitating reconsideration of the initial diagnosis. Considering the patient ‘ s immunocompromised state and poor response to empirical therapy, atypical pathogens were suspected. Bronchoalveolar lavage was deemed unsafe due to the patient’s critical condition. Therefore, sputum targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) was performed. The results revealed high relative abundance of L.pneumophila Legionella pneumonia. EBV HSV-1 Legionella pneumophila Legionella pneumophila  Legionella pneumonia EBV Traditional diagnostic methods for Legionella Legionella pneumonia 28 29 In this case, tNGS enabled rapid identification of Legionella pneumophila Legionella pneumophila Legionella In this case, tNGS revealed not only Legionella pneumophila but also Enterococcus faecium Epstein–Barr virus EBV HSV-1 L. pneumophila EBV HSV-1 E. faecium 30 31 L. pneumophila Legionella Enterococcus faecalis Epstein-Barr virus This case illustrates the diagnostic challenges in distinguishing CIP from atypical infections and underscores the clinical utility of tNGS in critically ill, immunocompromised patients. Early identification and tailored antimicrobial therapy were crucial in achieving a favorable outcome. Conclusions This case highlights that in patients receiving chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy, the development of diffuse ground-glass opacities and respiratory failure warrants a high level of vigilance in differentiating immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonia from rare infections caused by atypical pathogens. For patients who do not respond to glucocorticoids or conventional antimicrobial therapy, advanced molecular diagnostic techniques such as targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) should be promptly considered to establish an etiological diagnosis and guide individualized treatment. In this case, the application of tNGS enabled the rapid identification of Legionella pneumophil Data availability statement The raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.
