However, middle-aged and older adults with chronic pain and coexisting depression or anxiety have not been adequately represented in digital mental health studies. Objective The goal of this study is to refine an existing mobile, digital mental health intervention (Wysa for Chronic Pain) that addresses symptoms of depression, anxiety, and coexisting chronic pain for the unique challenges and technology use patterns of middle-aged and older adults. Methods Using a mixed methods, human-centered design approach and a series of randomized trials, we will test and iteratively refine just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that are designed to increase engagement with a digital mental health intervention. Participants will be aged 45 years or older, endorse at least moderately severe depression or anxiety symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score ≥10), and have coexisting chronic pain (ie, pain on most days or every day in the past 3 months), and live in the United States. In this open, web-based trial, participants will all receive Wysa for Chronic Pain (by Wysa), which uses a behavioral activation framework and encourages users to work toward pain acceptance. The fully automated intervention also includes cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, and sleep tools, among others. In each trial, participants will be randomized during a maximum 12-week study period to receive versus not receive novel JITAIs that are intended to reduce navigation burden and improve usability (and subsequent engagement and clinical effectiveness). The JITAIs are being designed with iterative user feedback, guided by the Discover, Design/Build, and Test framework and the Behavioral Intervention Technology model. The proximal outcome for each JITAI is related to engagement with Wysa for Chronic Pain after JITAI delivery (compared to when no JITAI is delivered). The primary distal clinical outcome is the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale. Based on statistical analysis that is triangulated with qualitative feedback from a subsample of trial participants, the JITAIs will be iteratively refined and retested in subsequent microrandomized trials until retesting of refined adaptations no longer yields meaningful improvement in immediate engagement or a maximum of 5 total trials have been completed. Results Institutional review board approval was obtained on April 11, 2025. The first participant was enrolled on June 2, 2025, and recruitment is expected to conclude in 2026. Conclusions Completion of this project will result in iteratively refined JITAIs that are designed to improve usability and engagement with a digital mental health intervention by middle-aged and older adults with depression or anxiety and coexisting chronic pain.

In a series of traditional and microrandomized trials (MRTs) that are interspersed with qualitative feedback from a subgroup of trial participants, the goal of this study is to test and optimize the effectiveness of the novel JITAIs to increase engagement among middle-aged and older adults with Wysa for Chronic Pain. The central hypothesis is that incorporating these JITAIs will increase engagement with Wysa for Chronic Pain by improving usability and, subsequently, will improve depression and anxiety symptoms in this population. After completion of this phase, the third project phase will be a pragmatic, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial during which the final JITAIs will be fully integrated into the Wysa for Chronic Pain user experience. Methods Study Design and Setting In this remote, single-site, mixed methods study, we will conduct a series of randomized trials interspersed with semistructured interviews ( Figure 1 46 46 Figure 1 Study design. JITAI: just-in-time adaptive intervention; MRT: microrandomized trial; RCT: randomized controlled trial. We anticipate performing 2-4 MRTs as part of this study, depending on opportunities that we identify for continued JITAI refinement based on our quantitative and qualitative findings after each trial, within the limitations of time and budget constraints. Each MRT will include 2 arms ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Participant flowchart for each microrandomized trial (MRT). JITAI: just-in-time adaptive intervention. Participants Eligibility Criteria Eligibility criteria were selected to be pragmatic and reflect the broad target population for Wysa for Chronic Pain while also being mindful of which variables can reliably be collected in an entirely remote study ( Textbox 1 Eligibility criteria.  Inclusion criteria Aged 45 years or older At least moderately severe depression or anxiety symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 or Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 score ≥10) [ 47 48 Chronic pain (ie, pain on most days or every day in the past 3 months) [ 2  Exclusion criteria Frequent active suicidal ideation [ 49 No access to a mobile device Not living in the United States Sample Size Sample size calculations were performed at a 5% significance level to detect an effect in the primary study outcome between the 2 study arms. Because the primary outcome for each JITAI is related to engagement (which is automatically captured by the Wysa platform and does not require participant report), we assumed a 10% attrition rate (conservatively assessed as occurring at baseline but after downloading Wysa for Chronic Pain). In the initial 4-week pilot trial, we will enroll 29 participants into each of the 2 arms (58 participants total). This will provide 80% power to detect a large effect size (Cohen d Sample size determinations for the subsequent 12-week MRTs will be dependent on analysis after each preceding trial, but it is anticipated that control groups for analysis will be pooled by including the control groups from previous trials. For the first MRT, we preliminarily anticipate enrolling 75 participants into the “Wysa for Chronic Pain with JITAIs” intervention arm and 46 participants into the “Wysa for Chronic Pain without JITAIs” control arm (121 total participants recruited). In the intervention arm, clipped Thompson sampling will be used to make intervention assignments with the clipping rate set at 10%. This would provide 80% power to detect a moderate to large effect size (Cohen d d Randomization Allocation to Interventions For the initial 4-week pilot trial, a computer-generated random sequence will be used to randomize participants to 1 of the 2 study arms. Stratification (eg, by age, sex, or symptom severity) or block randomization may be considered for the subsequent MRTs based on analysis from the preceding trials. A study statistician will generate the allocation sequences, and participants will be assigned to study arms automatically after they pass the web-based eligibility screen, review the study procedures, and complete the baseline study questionnaires; no direct involvement by study team members is required for study arm assignment. Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions are described in Multimedia Appendix 1 Blinding Study team members involved in outcome assessment and data analysis will not be blinded to participants’ intervention assignment because (1) the primary proximal outcomes related to immediate app engagement will be collected automatically and in real time throughout each trial and (2) the study outcomes will not be analyzed until a given trial is complete. Trial participants cannot definitively be blinded to their intervention assignment because the notification experience within Wysa for Chronic Pain will differ between the 2 intervention arms. Nevertheless, all participants will receive the same Wysa for Chronic Pain therapeutic content, participants will not explicitly be notified which study arm they are assigned to, and participants in the intervention arm with JITAIs will not necessarily be aware when a notification (or lack thereof) from Wysa for Chronic Pain is related to a JITAI under investigation. Interventions Wysa for Chronic Pain The overarching digital intervention is Wysa for Chronic Pain, developed by Wysa for mobile devices ( Multimedia Appendix 1 29 30 Figure 3 50 53 Figure 3 Screenshots of Wysa for Chronic Pain. JITAIs Descriptions Multiple JITAIs will be tested in the trials. Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 Description of initial just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) to be tested in the microrandomized trials. JITAI name Purpose Decision rule: tailoring variables and cut points Decision rule: intervention a Onboarding Increase onboarding completion rates If the user downloaded the app but did not complete onboarding within 24 hours of download Then, send a notification that encourages the user to finish onboarding. The notification directs the user back to the onboarding screen. When possible, the notification is personalized based on information the user shared thus far during onboarding. Short disengaged Motivate a user to engage using messages or content that resonates with the user If no app engagement for 24 hours Then, send a personalized notification regarding a challenge the user endorsed at onboarding or during a previous conversation. The notification directly opens to a relevant tool. Long disengaged Respect that users’ preferred or needed frequency of engagement may fluctuate based on symptom severity and life events If no app engagement for 7 days Then, send an “FYI b c AM check-ins only Personalize push timing to users’ demonstrated preferences If no engagement with PM check-ins but ≥1 engagement with AM check-ins within the last 7 days Then, send an “FYI or opt back in” notification, stop daily “PM check-in” notifications, and move the “activity tracking and mood reflection” task to the AM check-ins. PM check-ins only Personalize push timing to users’ demonstrated preferences If no engagement with AM check-ins but ≥1 engagement with PM check-ins within the last 7 days Then, send an “FYI or opt back in” notification, stop daily “AM check-in” notifications, and move the “activity scheduling and planning” task to the PM check-ins. Sporadic engagement only Personalize push timing and content to users’ demonstrated preferences (eg, engagement only during pain or mood symptom flares) If no engagement with AM or PM check-ins, but ≥1 user-led engagement within the last 7 days Then, send an “FYI or opt back in” notification, and stop daily “AM check-in” and “PM check-in” notifications. Instead, each day, send a single personalized notification that directs the user to a tool that was previously helpful or that has not been used yet but should be relevant based on challenges the user reported at onboarding. Mental health flare d Offer increased support when most needed If PHQ-4 e Then, send an “FYI or opt out” notification, and increase notification frequency back to twice daily (ie, AM and PM check-ins). a b c d e 54 55 Among participants in the “Wysa for Chronic Pain with JITAIs” intervention arm for each trial, each time they meet prespecified criteria per the JITAIs’ decision rules, they may receive the JITAI. In the initial 4-week pilot trial, they will receive the respective JITAIs described in Table 1 Concomitant Care Participants will not be restricted from engaging in any concomitant care during the trial, including mental health or chronic pain treatments. Participants will be asked to self-report whether (and what types of) medication they take for their mental health or pain at baseline, and they will be asked whether and how their medication regimens have changed at each follow-up time point. They will also be asked to report whether they had any pain procedures or psychiatry, counseling, or physical therapy visits during each follow-up period. Outcomes The purpose of each JITAI is to increase engagement with Wysa for Chronic Pain by improving usability. Therefore, the outcomes of greatest importance in these randomized trials are the proximal outcomes related to engagement ( Table 2 Table 2 Proximal outcomes for each of the initial just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) to be tested in the microrandomized trials.

Measure Baseline Week 4 Week 8 Week 12 a Participant characteristics ✓    Clinical mediators ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓  Outcomes  Engagement (proximal)  ✓ ✓ ✓  Clinical (distal) ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ a Data Collection and Management Qualitative Interviews Qualitative feedback will be obtained from a subgroup of approximately 5-10 trial participants through semistructured interviews after each trial. Participants will be asked to share perceptions of the strengths, limitations, and suggestions for improvement related to the JITAIs. Participants will be purposively sampled to represent a range of sociodemographic characteristics and engagement patterns. The interviews will occur through secure audio and video recording hosted by a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)–compliant Zoom (Zoom Communications, Inc) platform. Recording files will be stored on the study institution’s encrypted cloud server, Box (Box, Inc). Retention Strategies To improve retention, participants will be asked to complete the baseline study questionnaires immediately after the recruitment and enrollment process [ 64 Statistical Methods Primary Outcome The main purpose of the initial 4-week pilot trial is to determine the initial randomization probability for each JITAI in the first MRT for the “Wysa for Chronic Pain with JITAIs” intervention arm (ie, to construct a robust informative prior, also called a warm start, for each JITAI). We will also perform between-group comparisons of the primary proximal outcome for each JITAI between the intervention versus control arm (ie, comparison of the primary engagement outcome during the target engagement time interval between participants in the intervention arm when they met prespecified criteria and received JITAIs vs participants in the control arm when they met the same prespecified criteria but did not receive JITAIs). In the subsequent MRTs, analysis of the primary proximal outcome for each JITAI will account for both between-group and within-participant comparisons because participants in the “Wysa for Chronic Pain with JITAIs” arm may have met the prespecified criteria for any given JITAI multiple times during the study period. A secondary analysis of each MRT will also be performed to again construct a prior (warm start) for the subsequent MRT, for instance, centered at the estimated optimal JITAI strategy. Interim Analyses Interim analyses will be performed to ensure the specified randomization probabilities are producing a sufficient frequency of JITAI delivery to facilitate analysis of the primary outcomes, and randomization probabilities may be updated as needed throughout the trials. No interim analyses of the study outcomes will be performed. Given the relatively short duration and low risk of each trial, early stopping of a trial will only be considered if the data safety monitoring board (DSMB) determines that the intervention is contributing to one or more serious adverse events (SAEs), and the risks of continuation of the study outweigh the potential benefits to the enrolled participants. This is because the risk of harm from the intervention is low, and all participants will be receiving the same established therapeutic content. Sustained engagement and treatment effects are important secondary analyses, and early cessation of trials would jeopardize these analyses. Additional Analyses In a secondary analysis, we will evaluate whether the JITAIs’ effects on engagement vary with time based on the week of the study. The distal clinical outcomes in Table 3 6 We will also estimate optimal JITAIs for the distal clinical outcomes using methods from reinforcement learning [ 65 66 Other secondary analyses will include development of models that predict the likelihood that a user will disengage with Wysa for Chronic Pain; descriptive analyses of the estimated optimal JITAI (eg, if, when, and for whom a JITAI should be recommended); and testing for heterogeneity across patients (ie, comparing the performance of a JITAI rule developed from data pooled across all participants to the performance of a rule learned from each participant’s individual trajectory of data). Our experimental therapeutics model will be assessed by evaluating for associations between engagement with tools related to each therapeutic target (ie, behavioral activation, pain acceptance, and sleep quality), patient-reported improvement in the corresponding target (ie, clinical mediators), and subsequent improvement in distal clinical outcomes. We will also investigate whether and how these associations vary across patient characteristics, such as age, depression or anxiety severity, pain interference severity, and self-reported digital savviness. Missing Data Once randomized participants download the Wysa for Chronic Pain app and initiate onboarding, proximal engagement outcomes will be automatically collected by the Wysa platform, regardless of how much or even whether a participant engages with Wysa for Chronic Pain during the rest of the study period, so these data points are not expected to be missing. For participant-reported questionnaire data, all questions will be designed as “required,” but participants will have the option to select “prefer not to answer” for sensitive descriptive variables. In these situations, “prefer not to answer” will be treated as a distinct covariate category in the analyses (rather than as missing data) since it will not necessarily be selected at random and may represent a distinct subgroup of participants. Multiple imputation for sequential randomized trials will be used to address missing data, for instance, if a participant does not complete questionnaires at a follow-up time point or withdraws from the study [ 67 Qualitative Analysis Recordings of participants’ interviews will be professionally transcribed. A hybrid inductive-deductive coding approach will be used, with the BIT model as a framework. At least 2 team members will be involved in thematic analysis. The primary goal of the qualitative analysis is to identify opportunities for refinement of the JITAIs (eg, decision rules, intervention options, intervention language, etc) to improve their usability and effectiveness. Data Sharing Plans Deidentified participant-level data will be shared through the NIMH Data Archive. Access to the dataset will be managed by the NIMH Data Archive. Oversight and Monitoring Trial Steering Committee Collectively, the trial steering committee includes expertise in geriatric mental health, chronic pain, qualitative and implementation research, and biostatistics, with particular expertise in JITAIs and MRTs. One or more members of the committee will meet with Wysa’s project leads at least biweekly on average. Data Safety Monitoring Board The DSMB consists of 3 members, collectively with expertise in mental health, chronic pain, behavioral interventions, biostatistics, and clinical trials. Led by a chairperson, the DSMB’s role is to review safety data and provide recommendations about starting, continuing, modifying, or stopping the study, taking into account the following considerations: participant safety, achievement of recruitment targets, research team adherence to applicable protocol requirements, and the completeness, quality, and analysis of safety assessments. The DSMB members are independent from the study funder, trial steering committee, and research team, and they are free from conflicts of interest related to the study intervention. The DSMB met before enrollment of the first participant in the first trial and will meet before launching each subsequent trial, or more frequently if new information raises questions regarding safety. Adverse Event Reporting Study participants will be encouraged to report any real or perceived adverse events to the research coordinator through telephone or email. These instructions will be included on the study information sheet, in addition to other electronic study materials provided to participants. The coordinator will record all reported events in an adverse event log (including the participant’s name, date, and event description), which will be hosted in the study’s secure Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database [ 68 69 Any serious event that is deemed by the study investigators to be attributable or possibly attributable to the study intervention will be reported to the institutional review board (IRB) within 24 business hours and to the DSMB within 5 business days of the knowledge of occurrence. In accordance with NIMH policy, any deaths or SAEs that are deemed related to study participation will also be reported to the NIMH within 5 and 10 business days, respectively. These actions and the dates of implementation will be recorded in the adverse event log. If an SAE that is attributable to the study occurs, immediate changes to the study consent form and protocol will be made if indicated. Otherwise, each quarter, the study investigators will classify any reported events as “serious” or “nonserious” and as “attributable,” “possibly attributable,” or “nonattributable” to the study intervention. Protocol Modifications Any proposed major protocol modifications will be approved by the DSMB and IRB and then communicated to relevant parties through updates to the ClinicalTrials.gov registration or direct communication with participants, as relevant. Dissemination Plans Study results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals and for presentation at academic conferences, as appropriate. Aggregate study results will also be shared through ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, study results will inform the development of a final refined Wysa for Chronic Pain intervention, which will ultimately be available for widespread public use. Ethical Considerations Participants will be recruited from the general direct-to-consumer Wysa platform, potentially as well as from other sources, such as free and publicly available online support groups and research registries ( Multimedia Appendix 1 68 69 Multimedia Appendix 2 Results This study was funded on March 4, 2024, by the NIMH as part of grant R01MH131989. IRB approval was obtained on April 11, 2025 (protocol version 1: March 26, 2025). The first participant was enrolled on June 2, 2025, and recruitment is expected to conclude in 2026. Discussion Significance and Directions for Future Research This study is an intermediate step in the adaptation and dissemination of a digital mental health intervention that is iteratively co-designed with user input, rigorously tested, and then rapidly made available to the target population. After completion of this study, we will conduct a pragmatic, hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study as the final refined version of Wysa for Chronic Pain is launched for widespread use. This process will facilitate real-world assessment of the effectiveness and reach of the intervention, and it will enable rapid, global availability of the intervention for people in need. We anticipate that the process and results of this study will also lead to more generalizable insights. For instance, our process can serve as a reproducible, precision medicine approach to tailor digital mental health interventions for people with other medical comorbidities that frequently coexist with mental illness (eg, cancer, diabetes, stroke, heart disease, and lung disease) [ 70 71 Limitations A limitation inherent in most trials involving a digital health intervention is that findings from this study will be most generalizable among people who have a base level of comfort and interest in using technology for health-related purposes. Nevertheless, especially as technology use continues to rapidly increase in this large and growing population [ 20 Conclusions Completion of this mixed method series of randomized trials and semistructured interviews will result in iteratively refined JITAIs that are designed to improve usability and engagement with a digital mental health intervention by middle-aged and older adults with depression or anxiety and coexisting chronic pain. The methodological approach and the usability-related insights that are identified from this study can also be used for the development and refinement of other digital behavioral interventions for similar populations. This study is funded by the National Institute of Mental Health (grant R01MH131989; principal investigator ALC).
