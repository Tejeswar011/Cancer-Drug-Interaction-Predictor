One putative advantage of these diets is reduced intestinal phosphate absorption. This effect has been ascribed to phytic acid (myoinositol hexaphosphoric acid) and its anion, phytate, that are present in many plant foods, particularly in the seeds, nuts, grains, and fruits of plants. This article reviews the structure and many actions of phytate with particular reference to its potential effects on people with CKD. Phytate binds avidly to and can reduce gastrointestinal absorption of the phosphate anion and many macrominerals and trace elements including iron, zinc, calcium, and magnesium. This has led some opinion leaders to label phytate as an anti-nutrient. The human intestine lacks phytase; hence, phytate is essentially not degraded in the small intestine. A small amount of phytate is absorbed from the small intestine, although phytate bound to phosphate is poorly absorbed. Clinical trials in maintenance hemodialysis patients indicate that intravenously administered phytate may decrease hydroxyapatite formation, vascular calcification, and calciphylaxis.
