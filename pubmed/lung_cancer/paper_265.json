Methods We retrospectively evaluated 140 patients newly diagnosed with OESCC who received RCIT or CIT as first-line treatment between June 2018 and December 2021. Among them, 76 patients were in the RCIT cohort and 64 patients in the CIT cohort. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to simulate random allocation. Results After 1:1 PSM, 61 well-paired patients were selected. The median follow-up duration was 34.7 months (95%CI: 30.6–38.8 months). After PSM, the median PFS for the RCIT and CIT groups was 10.9 (95%CI: 9.4–12.4) months and 7.3 (95%CI: 6.0–8.7) months, respectively ( P = P P P P Conclusion RCIT as first-line treatment for OESCC was safe and efficacious. RCIT improved PFS/OS compared to CIT without increasing the overall high grade toxicity rate. However, the increased incidence of pneumonitis due to RT implementation cannot be disregarded.

The former typically has a better prognosis and requires more aggressive treatment modalities [ 7 8 11 12 13 14 The specific aims of this study were to compare the safety and efficacy of radiotherapy combined with chemoimmunotherapy (RCIT) versus CIT alone as the first-line treatment for OESCC at initial diagnosis. Materials and methods Study design and patients We conducted a retrospective review of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic ESCC who received RCIT or CIT at our institution between June 2018 and December 2021. The study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of The Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University (Ethics review number: 2023KS028; Date of approved by ethic committee: July 11, 2023). The requirement for informed consent of patients was waived by the board due to the retrospective nature of the study. Inclusion criteria for this study were: histologically or cytologically confirmed ESCC; clinically confirmed extra-regional lymph node metastasis or distant organ metastasis; up to five measurable metastatic lesions involving no more than three organs [ 15 Radiotherapy In the RCIT group, all patients received intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for their primary tumors. The median prescribed planning target volume (PTV) dose was 60 Gy (range, 50.4–66 Gy). The median per dose was 2 Gy (range, 1.8–2.2 Gy), and the median number of fractions was 30 (range, 28–33). For metastatic lesions, 52 patients received IMRT (50 for extra-regional lymph node metastases, 1 for distant organ metastases and 1 for both) and 5 patients received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) (5 for distant organ metastases). The median BED 10 Before PSM, 29 patients received RT for partial lesions (19 patients received RT only for their primary tumors, 10 patients received RT for primary tumors and partial metastatic lesions), 47 patients received RT for all lesions. After PSM, 27 patients received RT for partial lesions (17 for primary tumors, 10 for primary tumors and partial metastatic lesions), 34 patients received RT for all lesions. Immunotherapy All patients received anti-PD‑1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as systemic treatment, including pembrolizumab, camrelizumab, toripalimab, sintilimab, and tislelizumab. The median number of anti-PD‑1 mAb cycles in the RCIT and CIT groups was 4 (range, 1–22; interquartile range (IQR), 2–5) and 4 (range, 1–20; IQR, 2–7), respectively. In the RCIT group, 52 patients were treated with camrelizumab, 12 patients with sintilimab, 6 patients with pembrolizumab, and 6 patients with tislelizumab. In the CIT group, 48 patients were treated with camrelizumab, 4 patients with pembrolizumab, 5 patients with sintilimab, 5 patients with toripalimab, and 2 patients with tislelizumab. Chemotherapy All patients received two- or three-drug cisplatin-based chemotherapy at 3‑week intervals. The median number of CT cycles for the entire group, RCIT group, and CIT group was 4 (range, 1–8), 3 (range, 1–6), and 5 (range, 1–8), respectively. In the RCIT group, definitive-dose radiotherapy for the primary tumor was administered concurrently with 2 or 3 cycles of chemotherapy. PD-L1 expression Before PSM, in the RCIT group, 27 patients (35.5%) had available PD-L1 expression, of which 3 were negative expression of PD-L1 (combined positive score (CPS) < 1) and 24 were positive (CPS ≥ 1). In the CIT group, 23 patients (35.9%) had available PD-L1 expression, of which 2 were negative expression of PD-L1 and 21 were positive. After PSM, in the RCIT group, 24 patients (39.3%) had available PD-L1 expression, including 3 with negative expression of PD-L1 and 21 with positive. In the CIT group, 22 patients (36.1%) had available PD-L1 expression, including 2 with negative expression of PD-L1 and 20 with positive. Follow-Up and statistical analysis 14 (18.4%) patients in the RCIT group and 13 (20.3%) patients in the CIT group underwent PET–CT scans for baseline staging. The remaining patients received at least chest and abdominal CT, superficial lymph node ultrasound, and head CT/MRI as baseline staging examinations. Patients were reevaluated 1 month after treatment and every 3 months thereafter, including chest and abdominal CT, barium esophagography, head MRI, and other imaging and hematological tests. When patients experienced symptoms related to disease progression, corresponding chest and abdominal CT, brain CT or MRI, bone scans, etc., were performed. The primary endpoints of this study were PFS and OS. PFS was defined as the time from the date of initial therapy to the first instance of disease progression or death from any cause. OS was defined as the time from initial therapy to censoring or death. The secondary endpoint was the safety of both treatment approaches. Locoregional failure was defined as failure to control or recurrence of the primary esophageal tumor, or/and recurrence/metastasis in regional lymph nodes. Distant failure was defined as recurrence/metastasis to distant organs or extra-regional lymph nodes. Infield failure was defined as uncontrolled, recurrent, or metastatic lesions within the RT target volume. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) in medical records were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 5.0 (CTCAE V5.0). According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC 8th ed., 2017) TNM staging system, the supraclavicular lymph nodes are defined as non-regional lymph nodes, with the upper boundary being the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage, the lower boundary being the clavicle, and the inner boundary being the inner edge of the carotid sheath. Non-regional lymph node metastases were counted by station. To reduce the influence of potential confounders, selection bias and heterogeneous populations, this study used propensity score matching (PSM). We used a 1:1 ratio within a caliper width of 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score to simulate random allocation. The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was employed to analyze differences in categorical variables, and the Mann-Whitney U test for differences in continuous variables. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS and PFS. Between-group differences in OS and PFS were evaluated using the stratified log-rank test. HRs for prognostic factors and 2‑sided 95% CIs were assessed using stratified Cox proportional-hazards models. All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism V.9.3.0 or SPSS 23.0. P Results Patient characteristics In total, 140 patients who met the inclusion criteria were included in this study. Among them, 76 patients were in the RCIT cohort and 64 patients in the CIT cohort. Before PSM, the proportion of patients with ≥ 65 years old, cervical and upper tumor, only non-regional lymph node metastasis, and only single metastatic organ in RCIT group was higher than that in CIT group. After PSM, 61 well-paired patients were selected in the oligometastasis cohort. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between two groups after PSM (Table 1 2 Table 1 Baseline clinical characteristics of oligometastatic patients before and after PSM Characteristics Before PSM After PSM RCIT ( n CIT ( n P RCIT ( n CIT ( n P Gender Male 55 54 0.088 46 51 0.262 Female 21 10 15 10 Age years < 65 26 34 0.024 24 31 0.203 ≥ 65 50 30 37 30 ECOG 0–1 70 59 0.996 59 56 0.272 2 6 5 2 5 BMI < 18.5 8 6 0.821 5 6 0.752 ≥ 18.5 68 58 56 55 Tumor location Cervical 3 0 0.005 0 0 0.319 Upper 14 5 7 5 Middle 39 29 35 29 Down 20 30 19 27 Clinical T stage 2–3 60 51 0.914 49 48 0.823 4 16 13 12 13 Clinical N stage 1 32 22 0.638 25 21 0.748 2 30 28 24 26 3 14 14 12 14 Site of metastases Non-regional lymph nodes only 57 34 0.007 43 34 0.091 Distant organs involved 19 30 18 27 No. of metastatic lesions 1–2 43 32 0.437 32 31 0.856 3–5 33 32 29 30 No. of metastatic organs 1 69 48 0.012 54 46 0.060 2–3 7 16 7 15 Chemotherapy cycle < 4 34 21 0.150 24 20 0.451 ≥ 4 42 43 37 41 Immunotherapy cycle < 4 37 28 0.560 27 26 0.855 ≥ 4 39 36 34 35 ECOG Table 2 The status of distant metastasis Before PSM After PSM RCIT CIT RCIT CIT ( n ( n ( n ( n No. of organs involved 1 69 48 54 46 (90.8) (75.0) (88.5) (75.4) 2 6 14 6 14 (7.9) (21.9) (9.8) (23.0) 3 1 2 1 1 (1.3) (3.1) (1.6) (1.6) No. of metastatic lesions 1 25 13 18 12 (32.9) (20.3) (29.5) (19.7) 2 18 19 14 19 (23.7) (29.7) (23.0) (31.1) 3 14 8 11 7 (18.4) (12.5) (18.0) (11.5) 4 9 7 9 7 (11.8) (10.9) (14.8) (11.5) 5 10 17 9 16 (13.2) (26.6) (14.8) (26.2) Metastatic modality Extra-regional lymph nodes 64 47 50 46 (84.2) (73.4) (82.0) (75.4) Distant organ 19 30 18 27 (25.0) (46.9) (29.5) (44.3) Both 7 13 7 12 (9.2) (20.3) (11.5) (19.7) Distant organ Lung 6 15 6 14 (7.9) (23.4) (9.8) (23.0) Liver 5 10 5 7 (6.6) (15.6) (8.2) (11.5) Bone 4 6 4 6 (5.3) (9.4) (6.6) (9.8) Brain 2 1 2 1 (2.6) (1.6) (3.3) (1.6) Kidney 2 0 2 0 (2.6) (0.0) (3.3) (0.0) Subcutaneous metastasis 1 0 1 0 (1.3) (0.0) (1.6) (0.0) Adrenal gland 0 1 0 1 (0.0) (1.6) (0.0) (1.6) Pancreas 0 1 0 1 (0.0) (1.6) (0.0) (1.6) Thyroid 1 0 0 0 (1.3) (0.0) (0.0) (0.0) Extra-regional lymph nodes Supraclavicular lymph node 47 37 37 34 (61.8) (57.8) (60.7) (55.7) Cervical lymph node 8 8 5 8 (10.5) (12.5) (8.2) (13.1) Retroperitoneal lymph nodes 8 9 5 8 (10.5) (14.1) (8.2) (13.1) Axillary lymph node 4 1 4 1 (5.3) (1.6) (6.6) (1.6) Hilar lymph node 4 2 3 2 (5.3) (3.1) (4.9) (3.3) Pancreatic lymph node 1 1 1 1 (1.3) (1.6) (1.6) (1.6) Overall survival and progression-Free survival As of the last follow-up on July 15, 2023, the median follow-up time was 34.7 months (95%CI: 30.6–38.8 months). Ninety-nine (70.7%) patients had died at the point of data cutoff. Before PSM, PFS and OS were superior in the RCIT group compared to the CIT group.

This study is a tentative exploration of triple therapy and also serves to support RCIT as a new standard option for OESCC, although further corroboration is required. We have observed novel findings that have not been previously reported: it seems that patients with OESCC who have earlier clinical stages, limited metastatic status (1–2 metastatic lesions, one metastatic organ, or only extra-regional lymph node metastases) are more likely to benefit from the combination of RT and CIT. We also found that the prognosis of patients who received RT for all lesions tended to be better than that of patients who received RT for partial lesions, while the prognosis of patients who received RT for partial lesions was not significantly different from that of those who did not receive RT. It suggests to some extent that RT for primary tumor and all oligometastatic lesions may improve survival under the premise of technical feasibility and clinical safety, especially for patients with only extra-regional lymph node metastasis. However, due to the inherent defects and confounding factors of retrospective studies, this result still needs to be further verified by prospective studies. In the Japanese staging of esophageal cancer (JES 12th ed., 2022), supraclavicular lymph node metastasis and other well-dissected extra-regional lymph node metastases are defined as M1a, which is different from other distant metastases. The IKF-575 phase III trial investigates the role of surgical intervention in limited-metastatic (retroperitoneal lymph node (RPLN) metastases only or/and a maximum of 1 organ involved) gastric/esophagogastric junction cancer after chemotherapy/targeted induction therapy [ 24 Several retrospective studies have shown that patients with oligometastatic esophageal cancer with less metastatic lesion [ 10 11 25 11 16 Although this study indicated that adding RT did not increase the occurrence of G3+ overall toxicity rate, the risk of pneumonitis remains a concern for us. The safety profile observed in this study was consistent with previously published retrospective studies on RT combined with ICI [ 17 22 23 26 27 29 There are several limitations to this investigation. First, this was a retrospective study which might have distorted the results because of unmeasured confounders, selection bias, and heterogeneous populations. Although we performed PSM to minimize the baseline imbalance between the two groups, potential treatment selection bias may still affect outcomes. As mentioned above, caution is still needed in determining whether outcomes were improved as a direct consequence of adding RT, or because of potential bias, or both. Due to the positive results of this study in prolonging survival, we recommend to conduct a prospective randomized clinical study to confirm this finding. This analysis included single-institution patients, and further stratification was impeded by the relatively finite sample size. Second, due to the lack of detection of PD-L1 expression in a portion of patients, we did not include PD-L1 expression as a factor in PSM and further analyze its effect on survival, although it is known that response rates to ICIs increase based on the PD-L1 TPS [ 30 In summary, this study demonstrated that RCIT as first-line treatment for OESCC at initial diagnosis is efficacious, especially for patients with earlier clinical stages or limited metastatic status. RCIT improves PFS/OS over CIT without increasing G3+ overall toxicities, but the risk of pneumonitis cannot be ignored.
