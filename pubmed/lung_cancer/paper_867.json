In Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic, environmental exposure plays a central role in transmission. 19 20 1 21 22 Notably, melioidosis is a rare and often unfamiliar to both healthcare professionals and the general public in non-endemic areas like Saudi Arabia. A case report revealed that a case involving a 59-year-old Bangladeshi man with type 2 diabetes, who presented with pneumonia after returning from Bangladesh. He had experienced a three-week history of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Initially, he was misdiagnosed and treated for pulmonary tuberculosis at another hospital. This case highlights the challenges in diagnosing melioidosis, especially in regions where awareness is low and the clinical presentation mimics other common conditions. Early recognition, particularly in patients with relevant travel history and risk factors like diabetes, is essential. Long-term antibiotic therapy and close outpatient monitoring are critical to prevent relapse. 23 B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei 24 Mode of Transmission B. pseudomallei 1 25 26 27 10 28 29 B. pseudomallei 30 B. pseudomallei 31 Virulence Factors of Burkholderia Pseudomallei Several key virulence factors contribute to B. pseudomallei 32 1 25 33 1 7 34 Pathogenesis of Burkholderia Pseudomallei B. pseudomallei 25 B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei 35–38 B. pseudomallei 39 40 B. pseudomallei 41 B. pseudomallei 42–44 45 The bacterium exploits host actin filaments via the BimA protein, thereby enabling actin-based motility. This allows it to propel itself into neighboring cells, thus avoiding extracellular immune surveillance. 46 47 B. pseudomallei 48 49 50 51 Clinical Manifestations of Melioidosis Melioidosis presents with a wide range of symptoms that vary according to the route of infection and disease severity. The primary clinical forms include acute myeloidosis (the most common presentation), such as pulmonary infection with fever, cough, chest pain, pneumonia, and lung abscesses. 52 53 54 21 55 56 Diagnosis The incubation period for acute melioidosis averages 9 days but can range from 1 d to 3 weeks, with more severe cases occurring after inhalation or aspiration of contaminated water. Disease severity and outcomes depend on risk factors, infection route, bacterial load, strain type, and specific B. pseudomallei 1 57 1 58 B.pseudomallei Pseudomonas 59 60 61 B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei 54 B. pseudomallei 62 63 1 Treatment and Antibiotic Resistance Early diagnosis and prompt B. pseudomallei 64 B. pseudomallei 65–67 B. pseudomallei 68 69 10 28 70 Following the initial intensive phase of treatment, a prolonged course of oral antibiotics is essential to eliminate residual bacteria and prevent disease recurrence or relapse. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole is considered the first-line choice for eradication therapy, whereas alternatives such as co-amoxiclav or doxycycline may be used when necessary. 1 7 Extending the duration of the initial intensive therapy in patients with severe melioidosis has played a key role in reducing mortality rates in areas with advanced healthcare facilities. 1 71 72 Notably, B. pseudomallei 73 18 74 75 Prevention and Control Measures Awareness of melioidosis among the general population in developing tropical regions remains low, and preventive measures are often overlooked or not consistently practiced. 76 1 77 B. pseudomallei 78 A recent modelling study suggests that melioidosis causes approximately 2,800 deaths annually in Thailand, with the highest burden concentrated in the northeastern region. Despite being endemic across the country, the disease remains under-recognized, partly due to limited awareness among rural populations and frequent misidentification of B. pseudomallei 79–81 B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei Pseudomonas 82 83 Although India is recognized as an endemic region—particularly in its southern and eastern coastal areas—recent years have seen an emergence of sporadic cases in North Indian states such as Rajasthan and Gujarat. These reports underscore the presence of multiple risk factors in regions not previously considered endemic, including a high burden of diabetes, widespread alcohol use, and large rural populations involved in paddy farming. Additionally, the impact of climate change—particularly frequent flooding and waterlogging in urban areas—has increased human exposure to contaminated soil, potentially facilitating the spread of the bacterium. Given that melioidosis was historically unrecognized in northern India, it is critical to raise awareness among clinicians and microbiologists to improve early detection, appropriate testing, and timely treatment. 84 Of note, the epidemiology of melioidosis is influenced by climate change, which alters patterns of human exposure to B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei 26 B. pseudomallei 85 Notably, it has been evaluated oral antibiotic prophylaxis against aerosolized Burkholderia pseudomallei 86 87 In many low- and middle-income countries where melioidosis is endemic, prevention efforts must go beyond clinical interventions to consider the broader socioeconomic context. The high cost of prolonged antibiotic therapy often places a significant financial burden on patients, leading to treatment discontinuation and poorer health outcomes. These economic challenges underscore the importance of integrating affordability and universal health coverage into national infection control strategies. Strengthening public health systems, ensuring access to cost-effective antibiotics, and expanding community-level education are all essential components in preventing disease recurrence and improving adherence to treatment. A comprehensive approach that includes financial risk protection and health system support is vital to ensure equitable access to both existing therapies and any future treatment innovations. Additionally, Prevention efforts in low-resource settings should prioritize raising awareness, improving access to diagnostics and treatment, and addressing environmental exposure risks. Official recognition and targeted support could significantly reduce the impact of melioidosis in these vulnerable communities. 82 88–90 Effective prevention of melioidosis requires a comprehensive approach involving both community engagement and government support. Such strategies are currently being evaluated in ongoing studies in northeast Thailand. 1 B. pseudomallei 91 Future Direction B. pseudomallei Combination Therapy Recently, the efficacy of finafloxacin against B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei 92 B. pseudomallei 93 94 95 96 96 A study reveals that the folate biosynthesis enzyme FolE2 is nonessential under normal conditions but is critical in the presence of subinhibitory trimethoprim. Screening identified ten FolE2 inhibitors, including DHL, which formed a lethal combination with trimethoprim. X-ray crystallography confirmed DHL’s mechanism-based inhibition of DHL. This combination outperforms Bactrim against B. pseudomallei 97 Notably, one study evaluated combinations of antibiotics and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) combinations against B. mallei, B.pseudomallei, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis Bacillus anthracis 98 B. pseudomallei 99 B. pseudomallei 100 B. pseudomallei 101 B. pseudomallei 102 Vaccine Notably, one study explored a gold nanoparticle (AuNP)-based subunit vaccine to elicit both humoral and cell-mediated immunities. Immunization with AuNP-conjugated antigens, including OpcP and OpcP1 with LPS, provided significant protection, whereas a combined nanovaccine (AuNP-Combo2-LPS) provided complete protection. The vaccine induced a strong TH1-skewed immune response, promoting macrophage uptake and antigen-specific TH1-TH17 cytokine profiles. This approach offers a promising vaccine strategy against B. pseudomallei 103 B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei 104 Phage Therapy One study investigated phage therapy using phage C34, which was isolated from seawater and categorized as a Myoviridae virus. Phage C34 lysed 39.5% of B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei 105 B. pseudomallei 106 B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei 107 B. pseudomallei B. pseudomallei 108 Table 1 Table 1 Comprehensive Summary of the Different Strategies Explored for Combating B. Pseudomallei Approach Key Findings Reference Combination Therapy Finafloxacin combined with doxycycline showed better bacterial control and survival outcomes in murine models. [ 68 Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) enhanced antibiotic efficacy, especially with gentamicin. [ 93 Ceftazidime + TMP-SMX had the lowest mortality rates for severe melioidosis therapy. [ 96 Nivolumab adjunct therapy improved refractory melioidosis cases. [ 97 FolE2 inhibitors (eg, DHL) enhanced trimethoprim efficacy. [ 98 Antibiotic + antimicrobial peptide (AMP) combinations improved susceptibility in B. pseudomallei [ 99 Screening 400 compounds identified potential repurposed drugs, including auranofin and rifampicin. DNase I improved antibiotic efficacy against B. pseudomallei [ 101 LPC-233, targeting LpxC, outperformed ceftazidime in murine models but required prolonged therapy. [ 102 Vaccine A gold nanoparticle-based subunit vaccine (AuNP-Combo2-LPS) provided complete protection and induced a strong immune response. [ 103 A subunit vaccine using CPS-CRM197 and Hcp1 achieved 100% survival and bacterial clearance in murine models. [ 104 Phage Therapy Phage C34 lysed 39.5% of B. pseudomallei [ 105 Phage vB_BpP_HN01 [ 106 Screening 145 phages led to the isolation of ΦPK23V1, which infected 83.3% of B. pseudomallei [ 107 Phage ΦBp-AMP1 infected all 11 tested B. pseudomallei [ 108 In addition to antimicrobial and vaccine-based strategies, exploring host-targeted therapies offers a promising complementary approach to managing melioidosis. By modulating the host immune response, such therapies can potentially enhance pathogen clearance and improve outcomes in severe or refractory cases. 109 110 112 Conclusion Addressing the global burden of melioidosis requires a multifaceted approach that includes enhanced diagnostic capabilities, effective antimicrobial therapies, and targeted preventive strategies. This review underscores the confounding clinical presentation of melioidosis, which often mimics other diseases, leading to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment—particularly in resource-limited settings. Significant research gaps remain, including the need for affordable, rapid diagnostics, understanding zoonotic transmission pathways, and the development of context-specific treatment protocols. Additionally, high treatment costs and limited access to prolonged antibiotic therapy pose challenges in endemic regions. Reinforcing these gaps and prioritizing the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines are crucial to improving patient outcomes and mitigating the global impact of this neglected tropical disease.
