Animals and Methods Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups (n=8): Control group (A), AgNPs exposure group (B), Se treated group (C), and Se+ AgNPs treated group (D). Rats in groups B and D received one dose of intratracheal instillation of AgNPs, while groups A and C received the same volume of 0.9% NaCl intratracheally. Rats in groups C and D were also intraperitoneally injected with sodium selenite for 7 days immediately after the AgNPs exposure. Morphological changes of the aorta were assessed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and electron microscopy. Masson’s Trichrome Staining assayed collagen deposition in the aorta. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, caspase-3 activity, and mitochondrial fission markers were analyzed. Results Exposure to AgNPs increased collagen deposition and caused ultrastructural damage to endothelial cells in the aorta, including reduction of cytosolic contents, dissolution of mitochondrial cristae, and swollen mitochondria. Levels of ROS and cleaved caspase-3 increased moderately in AgNPs group (p<0.05 vs Control). Mitochondrial fission markers Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Fis1) in the aortic tissue homogenate of the AgNPs group nearly doubled the values of those in Control group (p<0.05 vs Control). Se alleviated AgNPs-induced ultrastructure changes and this effect was associated with suppressed ROS accumulation, inhibited caspase-3 activation, and attenuated mitochondrial fission. Conclusion This study demonstrates that AgNPs induced oxidative stress, caspase 3 activation, and mitochondrial fission are linked to the morphological alterations of the aortic endothelial cells; and these adverse effects resulted from AgNPs can be alleviated by sodium selenite, suggesting that selenite could be used as a protective agent against AgNPs toxicity.

This process is termed “mitochondrial dynamics”. 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 It has been reported that AgNPs cause mitochondrial dynamic imbalance in rat liver through increasing permeability of the mitochondrial membrane, and inhibit the electron transport chain, which in turn leads to ROS generation and oxidative stress. 17 18 19 Selenium is an essential micronutrient for human health, providing anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and immune system enhancement properties. 20 21 22 23 18 19 Materials and Methods Nanoparticle Preparation and Characterization Silver nanoparticles (specific type, US Research Nanomaterials, USA) were dissolved in ddH2O containing 1 mg/mL of AgNPs and 1% DMSO). The nanoparticles were kept in a dark and iced-water bath and sonicated for at least 30 minutes prior to being used for animal to ensure uniform dispersion. The size and physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles were characterized in our previous publication and in the current study. Animals and Treatment Thirty-two Male Sprague Dawley rats, aged 6–8 weeks, with an average weight of 200±20g were selected. The rats were fed standard laboratory rat chow for an acclimatization period of 7 days in a temperature-controlled room (24°C±4°C) with a 12-hour light/dark cycle and 50%±20% humidity. All animal surgical procedures were conducted in strict accordance with the Guidelines for Laboratory Animal Care and Use issued by Chinese National Guidelines (GB/T 35892‐20,181) 2018 and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University (approval numbers 2016–089). The animal groups and treatment information is given in Figure 1 18 19 Figure 1 The design of animal experiments and treatment. Rats were randomly allocated into four groups (n=8/group): ( A B C D Abbreviations Histopathological Examinations For histological examination, the collected aortic segment was fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 48 hours, dehydrated in ascending concentrations of ethanol, cleared with xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Five-micrometer-thick sections were cut from the paraffin blocks and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The extent of collagen fibrosis was detected using Masson’s Trichrome Stain Kit from Solarbio (G1340) following the manufacturer’s protocol. A histopathologist (S.A)., who was blinded to the grouping information, assessed the stained sections under a light microscope (OLYMPUS BX43, Tokyo, Japan). The Image J analysis software was used to determine the areas of blue-stained collagen and aortic media in each section, and the ratio of collagen area to aortic media area was used to represent collagen content. Transmission Electron Microscopy Study The aortic tissues were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 2 hours at 4°C, then washed three times with 0.1M dimethyl sodium arsenate at 2-hour intervals, followed by post-fixation in 4% osmic acid for 2 hours and two washes in 0.1M dimethyl sodium arsenate. The tissues were then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in epoxy resin. The resin was polymerized for 48 hours at 60°C. Ultrathin sections were cut from the blocks and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were mounted on copper grids, and observations were carried out and images were captured using a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi H-7650, Tokyo, Japan). ROS Detection The concentration of ROS was measured using the fluorescent probe BBoxi O13 follow the instructions of the ROS frozen section test kit. Briefly, cleaning solution (50 µL) was added to the tissue sections for 5 minutes. Then, a fluorescence probe working solution (50μL) was added on each section (the ratio of BBoxiProbeO13 active oxygen fluorescence probe to pure water was 1:150), and incubated in a wet box in a 37°C incubator. After 20 min of incubation, the sections were rinsed 3 times with PBS. The fluorescence intensity, which detects the ROS signal, was measured at an excitation wavelength of 340–380 nm and the signal intensity was analyzed using program in a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX43). Immunofluorescence Immunofluorescence detection of cleaved-Caspase 3 was performed with 4-μm paraffin cross-sections from the aorta of rat. Paraffin sections were dewaxed routinely and placed in a 0.01M citrate buffer solution (pH = 6.0) for 5 minutes in a hot water bath to unmask the antigens. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the slides in methanol/water (1:1) containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide. To block nonspecific binding sites, 30% goat serum was applied at room temperature for 30 minutes. The slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with Cleaved-Caspase 3 primary antibody (1:500, ab49822, Abcam) and subsequently washed to remove excess primary antibody. Next day, the slides were incubated with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody for one hour, followed by washing to remove excess secondary antibody. The nuclei were stained with DAPI, and the slides were immediately observed under a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX43) and images were captured. The fluorescence intensity in the images was quantified using Image Pro Plus software. Western Blot The aortic artery tissues were homogenized using the total protein extraction kit from KeyGEN BioTECH (KGP2100) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000×g for 10 minutes to separate the supernatant from the pellet. The supernatant containing the whole protein was collected, and lysed in an ice-water bath. The protein concentrations were measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (KeyGEN BioTECH). Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel for electrophoresis. The proteins on the gel were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) and blocked with 10% skim milk for 1 hour to reduce nonspecific protein binding. The blots were then incubated with primary antibodies against Drp1 (1:1000, ab184247, Abcam), Fis1 (1:1000, GTX111010, Gene Tex), and GAPDH (1:1000, sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) overnight at 4°C. The membranes were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (specify type) at room temperature for 1 hour. The protein bands were visualized using the Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate. The bands of the control protein GAPDH were used to normalize the expression levels of the targeted proteins, then the ratios of the targeted protein bands and loading control were calculated. Statistical Analysis We used SPSS version 22.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) for statistical analysis. Each experiment was repeated three times, and data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (x ± s). We used the One-Way ANOVA test and post hoc comparisons between groups (exact binomial 95% confidence intervals [CIs]). P values < 0.05 is considered as statistically significant.

As showed in Figure 7 Figure 7 AgNPs induces mitochondrial dynamic imbalance towards fission. ( A B–C Notes Abbreviations Discussion The present study has demonstrated that AgNPs increased collagen deposition and caused ultrastructural damage to the endothelial cells of the aorta. In addition, AgNPs led to mitochondrial swelling, ROS production, caspase-3 activation, along with elevated levels of mitochondrial fission markers, Drp1 and Fis1. Treatment with sodium selenite alleviated AgNPs-induced ultrastructural alterations, oxidative stress, caspase-3 activation, and mitochondrial fission. The major routes of AgNPs exposure include inhalation, ingestion, dermal contact, and direct entry into systemic circulation via intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intravenous (i.v.) injection, with inhalation being one of the primary methods of exposure. The common methods for animal inhalation modeling include whole-body exposure inhalation, nebulized inhalation, nasal drip, or intratracheal instillation. Since the first two methods require special exposure chambers and are more expensive, intratracheal instillation was chosen. Epidemiological evidence has shown that exposure to metal nanoparticles is strongly linked to cardiovascular damage and, consequently, increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. 24 25 26 27 Figure 2 Figure 4 Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown that oxidative stress is one of the vital mechanisms associated with the cytotoxicity of the AgNPs. 28–30 9 31 32 9 31–33 30 31 34 Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles undergoing continuous events of fission and fusion, which play an indispensable role in many cellular processes. 10 35–37 Conclusion Our data demonstrate that exposure to AgNPs increases collagen deposition, nuclear abnormalities, mitochondrial swelling, and the dissolution of mitochondrial cristae. Further, AgNPs enhanced ROS production, caspase-3 activation, and mitochondrial fission markers. Treatment with sodium selenite may alleviate the morphological alterations associated with inhibiting ROS formation, caspase-3 activation, and mitochondrial fission.
