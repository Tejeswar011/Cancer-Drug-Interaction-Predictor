However, distinguishing normal postoperative changes from complications on chest radiographs and CT scans presents a significant diagnostic challenge, necessitating precise radiologic interpretation. Postoperative complications manifest across a broad spectrum of timing and severity. Early complications include persistent air leak, pneumonia, and bronchopleural fistula, while late complications include bronchial anastomotic stricture, lung herniation, and unilateral pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis. In addition, rare but clinically significant complications, such as lobar torsion, acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia, and pulmonary vein stump thrombosis, warrant careful consideration due to their potential for severe morbidity. Accurate identification of expected postoperative imaging findings and complications is essential to ensuring timely diagnosis and preventing unnecessary interventions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on surgical procedures, expected postoperative imaging findings, and key complications to refine radiologists’ diagnostic acumen and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Recognizing uncommon complications is essential, as their imaging manifestations can be clinically significant. By improving recognition of these patterns, radiologists can enhance diagnostic accuracy, facilitate timely intervention, and reduce unnecessary procedures. Types of lung cancer surgery Standard surgical techniques for lung cancer (Table 1 Table 1 Surgical procedures for lung cancer Procedure Description Pneumonectomy Reserved for cases where cancer involves proximal bronchi or vascular structures. Due to its association with high perioperative mortality and long-term postoperative complications, it is performed only when necessary Lobectomy Involves the resection of a single lobe along with its regional lymph nodes. It is widely considered the standard surgical approach for resectable lung cancer Segmentectomy A lung-preserving procedure guided by the segmental bronchi and vessels. In selected cases, sub-segmentectomy may be performed to further preserve pulmonary function Wedge resection A non-anatomic sub-lobar procedure that removes a small, peripheral portion of the lung parenchyma without regard to segmental boundaries Surgical resection remains the definitive treatment for stages I, II, and selected IIIA NSCLC, often complemented by adjuvant systemic therapy offered in appropriate cases [ 3 4 5 Sleeve lobectomy is indicated when malignancy extends to or near the bronchial bifurcation, most frequently involving the right upper lobe. Although pneumonectomy is generally avoided due to its elevated perioperative mortality (6–8%) and risk of long-term postoperative complications, it remains necessary for tumors invading proximal bronchi or vascular structures [ 6 Minimally invasive techniques, including video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (RATS), have gained prominence in recent years. [ 7 7 7 Expected postoperative imaging findings Imaging modalities for postoperative assessment For routine early postoperative surveillance, CXR is generally sufficient owing to its accessibility, low radiation exposure, and cost-effectiveness. However, chest CT is warranted when complications are suspected, such as unexplained opacities or vascular complications [ 6 Normal postoperative changes by surgical procedure Pneumonectomy CXRs typically demonstrate an air- and fluid-filled postpneumonectomy space, with the trachea maintaining a midline position. Over time, a progressive mediastinal shift toward the resection site occurs due to air resorption within the pleural cavity [ 8 Lobectomy Following lobectomy, residual air in the pleural space resolves rapidly while pleural effusion gradually decreases. In some cases, a small, encapsulated effusion may persist long-term. Right middle lobectomy often results in minimal or absent volume loss due to the lung’s natural expansion dynamics [ 9 6 1 10 Fig. 1 Normal postoperative changes on CXR following lobectomy. After right upper lobectomy, CXR demonstrates elevation of the right pulmonary hilum (arrow) and the presence of a juxtaphrenic peak sign (arrowhead). Recognizing these findings is essential, as they may mimic atelectasis Segmentectomy CT imaging reveals resection of the segmental bronchus, while the main lobar bronchus remains patent [ 9 Wedge resection On postoperative imaging, wedge resection is characterized by linear areas of increased density corresponding to the surgical staple line, with or without adjacent soft-tissue thickening [ 6 Foreign body and post-surgical materials Surgical materials and fat pad (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Surgical materials and fat pad. a, b After left S3 segmentectomy, CXR (a) and CT (b) reveal a linear high-attenuation structure corresponding to the staple line (arrow), indicative of suture materials. c, d, e Following right lower lobectomy, the Teflon pledget appears as a polygonal nodule with high attenuation on CT lung window settings (c), positioned in contact with the pleura and interlobar pleura. FDG-PET imaging demonstrates associated radiotracer accumulation (d). A photograph of the Teflon pledget is also provided (e). After right lower lobectomy, the bronchial stump is covered by free pericardial fat tissue (f). The sagittal CT image reveals a soft-tissue mass with fat attenuation (arrow) at the distal end of the bronchial stump (arrowhead) Surgical materials are commonly used in lung resection to reinforce bronchial stumps and prevent postoperative complications. These include: Surgical staples, commonly used in segmentectomy, wedge resection, and lobectomy, appear as high-attenuation linear structures on imaging (Fig. 2 Teflon pledgets are polygonal in shape and positioned adjacent to the pleura or bronchial stump to mitigate the risk of lobar torsion or bronchopleural fistula [ 11 12 13 2 Muscle flaps and pericardial fat pads, which are frequently employed to reinforce bronchial stumps, reduce the risk of postoperative airway leaks. On CT, pericardial fat appears as a soft-tissue mass, particularly after lobectomy or pneumonectomy (Fig. 2 Recognizing the postoperative imaging appearance of surgical materials, such as Teflon pledgets, muscle flaps, and pericardial fat pads, is essential to avoid misinterpretation as tumor recurrence or other complications. This recognition can help prevent unnecessary diagnostic procedures and interventions. Postoperative complications: imaging and clinical correlation Early postoperative complications (< 30 days post-surgery) Complications following thoracic surgery can be broadly classified based on their timing: early complications, which manifest within the first 30 days postoperatively (e.g., persistent air leak, atelectasis, and pneumonia); late complications, which develop beyond this period (e.g., bronchial anastomotic stricture, lung herniation); and complications that may arise at any stage, such as bronchopleural fistula and empyema [ 14 2 Table 2 Postoperative complications after lung cancer surgery Early complications Late complications Complications occurring at any stage Persistent air leak Bronchial anastomotic stricture Bronchopleural fistula Atelectasis Lung herniation Empyema Pneumonia Chronic expanding hematoma Chylothorax Hemothorax Local tumor recurrence Thrombosis in the pulmonary vein stump Lung torsion Unilateral pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis Acute respiratory distress syndrome Acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia Acute mediastinitis, deep sternal wound infection Persistent air leak Persistent air leak occurs when air continues to escape from the lung parenchyma into the thoracic cavity beyond the expected timeframe for resolution. While some degree of air leakage is common following lobectomy, it typically resolves within 24–48 h as the remaining lung expands to occupy the pleural cavity. Air leaks persisting beyond 5–7 days are classified as persistent and may be associated with increased morbidity and prolonged hospitalization [ 8 14 CXRs and CT scans often reveal residual pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema [ 14 15 3 Fig. 3 Persistent air leak following left lower lobectomy. CXR taken 1 week postoperatively appears unremarkable ( a b Atelectasis Atelectasis is the most frequently encountered complication after thoracic surgery, typically arising during the early postoperative period [ 9 9 16 8 4 16 Fig. 4 Atelectasis following right upper lobectomy. CXR reveals atelectasis of the right middle lobe, manifesting as opacification along the mediastinal aspect of the right upper lung field Pneumonia Postoperative pneumonia is frequently associated with aspiration, mechanical ventilation, and inadequate pain control, all of which contribute to impaired pulmonary clearance and infection risk. On CXRs, pneumonia typically presents as patchy areas of consolidation, while CT provides better characterization, particularly in cases of aspiration pneumonia [ 9 5 Fig. 5 Pneumonia following left lower lobe wedge resection. The patient developed oxygen desaturation on postoperative day 1. Initial CXR was suggestive of pneumonia, and same-day CT imaging confirmed the diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia. CT revealed bilateral consolidation and ground-glass opacities predominantly in the lower lobes, consistent with aspiration pneumonia Hemothorax Postoperative hemothorax arises from residual bleeding within the thoracic cavity, often due to persistent leakage from systemic thoracic vessels (e.g., bronchial and intercostal arteries), suture dehiscence of a pulmonary artery, or venous injuries. Hemorrhage from systemic arterial sources is the most frequent cause. Radiographic findings on CXR include rapid opacification of the postoperative cavity. On non-contrast CT, hemothorax typically appears as a high-attenuation pleural effusion (~ 50 HU), often heterogeneous or with a fluid–fluid level [ 6 6 Fig. 6 Hemothorax after right lower lobectomy. The patient developed hemorrhagic shock following the removal of the drainage tube. CXR after tube removal demonstrated a sudden decrease in tight-sided translucency ( a b c In cases where active bleeding is suspected, contrast-enhanced CT angiography can identify the source, and transcatheter embolization may be considered a therapeutic option. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Postoperative ARDS is most commonly observed following pneumonectomy and has historically been associated with poor prognosis [ 8 14 Imaging findings include rapidly progressive bilateral opacities on CXR, while CT imaging reveals dorsal-predominant consolidation and ground-glass opacities (GGOs). These imaging features correspond to diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), the histopathologic hallmark of ARDS. During the organizing phases, traction bronchiectasis may also be present [ 8 17 18 18 7 8 17 Fig. 7 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Twenty-two days following right middle and lower lobe resection, follow-up CXR reveals diffuse ground-glass opacities in the left lung ( a b c Postoperative acute exacerbation (AE) of interstitial lung disease (ILD) ILD, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is frequently associated with lung cancer. In patients with pre-existing ILD, surgical resection is often selected with curative intent and to reduce complication risk despite available alternatives such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, postoperative acute exacerbation (AE) of ILD is a well-documented complication. With an incidence of 9.3% and a mortality rate of 43.9%, AE of ILD represents the leading cause of lung cancer surgery-related mortality [ 19 19 20 Imaging predictors for AE, such as preoperative CT findings of GGOs, consolidation, and pulmonary trunk enlargement, have been associated with an increased risk of AE [ 20 19 21 8 22 Fig. 8 Postoperative acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Preoperative CT showed interstitial lung disease with the usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, including honeycombing ( a b Late postoperative complications (> 30 days post-surgery) Bronchial anastomotic stricture Bronchial anastomotic stricture is a late complication and the most frequently encountered complication following sleeve lobectomy, with an incidence of 18% [ 23 Thin-section CT and multi-planar reconstructions are the most effective imaging modalities for evaluating airway narrowing and luminal obstruction [ 8 9 Fig. 9 Bronchial anastomotic stricture. Four months after a right upper sleeve lobectomy for lung cancer, CT in the lung window demonstrates marked narrowing at the bronchial anastomotic site Lung herniation Postoperative pulmonary hernia is a rare late complication in which the lung protrudes through a weakened region of the chest wall. While often asymptomatic, some patients present with a palpable or visible chest wall mass, which may become more prominent during coughing [ 24 10 Fig. 10 Postoperative lung hernia. Two years after left upper partial lobectomy, CT demonstrates lung parenchyma protruding through a chest wall defect at the left lung apex Chronic expanding hematoma Chronic expanding hematomas are uncommon but clinically significant late postoperative complications. They may present as slowly enlarging, space-occupying lesions that persist over months to years and can mimic malignancy on imaging. These lesions are frequently associated with a history of thoracic surgery for conditions such as tuberculosis, pneumothorax, trauma, or tuberculous pleurisy [ 25 CT typically reveals a well-defined, encapsulated mass with peripheral calcification. Contrast-enhanced CT may demonstrate scattered small nodular enhancement at the lesion margins. On T2-weighted MRI, the “mosaic sign” has been reported as a characteristic feature, reflecting heterogeneous signal intensities due to the presence of both acute and chronic hemorrhagic components [ 26 11 Fig. 11 Chronic expanding hematoma. Five years following left lower lobectomy, non-contrast CT ( a b c Local tumor recurrence Postoperative local recurrence may involve bronchial stump recurrence, staple line recurrence within the lung parenchyma, mediastinal lymph node metastasis, pleural dissemination, and seeding along the surgical tract. These recurrences are most frequently observed within 2 years postoperatively [ 6 On CT, parenchymal recurrence near the resection margin is more frequently encountered after limited resection, such as segmentectomy or wedge resection, compared to lobectomy. Soft tissue growth on follow-up CT suggests recurrence at the bronchial stump, while staple line recurrence appears as focal soft-tissue enlargement along the resection margin. FDG-PET remains a valuable tool for detecting recurrent disease, with a reported accuracy of 94% (Fig. 12 27 Fig. 12 Local tumor recurrence. Bronchial stump recurrence after right upper and middle lobectomy ( a d a b c d e g e f g However, postoperative inflammatory changes may also exhibit FDG uptake, complicating differentiation from malignancy. While inflammatory uptake typically subsides within 3 months and is rarely seen beyond 6 months, prolonged or worsening FDG accumulation has been documented, making definitive diagnosis challenging [ 28 30 13 Fig. 13 Staple line granuloma. FDG-PET/CT performed 3 years postoperatively shows increased FDG uptake at the bronchial stump ( a b Unilateral pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) Unilateral PPFE is an infrequent but emerging and clinically relevant late complication following lung cancer surgery [ 31 32 33 33 Postoperative pleural effusion at 6 months has been recognized as a key early finding, often preceding the development of fibrotic changes [ 33 33 On CT, PPFE manifests as pleural thickening with adjacent sub-pleural fibrosis, predominantly affecting the operated upper lung field. As the disease advances, progressive volume loss, cystic changes, and thoracic deformity may develop, further compromising lung function (Fig. 14 33 Fig. 14 Unilateral pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis. Seven years after right upper lobectomy, coronal CT images at postoperative year 1 ( a b c Complications occurring at any stage Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) A BPF represents an abnormal communication between the bronchial tree and pleural space, occurring in early and late postoperative periods. BPFs are more frequently encountered following right pneumonectomy than left pneumonectomy, likely due to anatomical features of the right main bronchus—specifically, its shorter length, larger diameter, and reduced mediastinal coverage [ 6 14 CXR findings on imaging include decreased pleural fluid, persistent pneumothorax, or subcutaneous emphysema. CT is particularly valuable in identifying air-fluid levels within the pleural cavity, and in approximately 50% of cases, direct visualization of communication between the bronchus and pleural space can be identified [ 6 15 Fig. 15 Bronchopleural fistula (BPF). Following right lower lobectomy ( a b a b When empyema develops secondary to BPF, prompt management is critical. Initial treatment typically involves chest tube drainage and antimicrobial therapy to control infection and prevent contralateral contamination. In persistent or complex cases, advanced interventions such as open-window thoracostomy (Fig. 15 34 Empyema Postpneumonectomy empyema is a severe complication and is associated with high mortality, with BPF as its primary etiology [ 15 9 14 Radiologic findings include rapid pleural fluid accumulation, sometimes accompanied by a mediastinal shift. Fluid collections may exhibit convex protrusions with septations (Fig. 16 8 9 Fig. 16 Empyema following left upper and lower segmentectomy to bronchopleural fistula. CT reveals fluid accumulation in the left pleural cavity, accompanied by adhesions and intrapleural air, resulting in a convex pleural contour In patients with aspiration pneumonia, centrilobular opacities in the residual lung fields can serve as a diagnostic clue, further increasing the likelihood of empyema secondary to BPF (Fig. 15 Chylothorax Chylothorax results from thoracic duct injury, leading to the accumulation of lymphatic fluid enriched with chylomicrons and lipids within the pleural space. The thoracic duct originates at the cisterna chyli, traverses the right aortic hiatus, and crosses leftward near the fifth thoracic vertebra before ascending into the mediastinum. Given this anatomical course, right-sided chylothorax is more commonly observed [ 14 CXR findings are often non-specific, demonstrating a progressively and rapidly enlarging pleural effusion (Fig. 17 Fig. 17 Chylothorax following left upper and lower lobe segmentectomy. CXR performed 2 weeks postoperatively demonstrates a large left pleural effusion. Thoracentesis confirmed chylothorax However, CT alone often fails to differentiate chylous effusion from other causes of pleural effusion [ 8 Management strategies range from conservative approaches (drainage) to interventional procedures (pleurodesis, surgical repair). Lymphangiography with embolization is a technique that allows both the identification of the leakage site and targeted treatment [ 8 14 15 Rare but critical complications Lung torsion Lung torsion is an extremely rare but life-threatening postoperative complication, occurring in less than 0.4% of cases. It is most commonly observed following right upper lobectomy (affecting the middle lobe) and upper division segmentectomy (affecting the lingula), occurring as an early complication postoperatively. Torsion results in airway obstruction, disruption of the pulmonary arterial supply, and impaired venous drainage, which may lead to hemorrhagic infarction or parenchymal necrosis [ 8 35 Regarding imaging, CXR should raise suspicion when atelectasis or consolidation appears in an abnormal location. CT demonstrates a twisted lobe with consolidation, GGO, and interlobular/intralobular septal thickening (Fig. 18 8 35 36 Fig. 18 Lung torsion following right upper lobectomy. CT performed 2 days postoperatively shows consolidation in the twisted middle lobe (arrow) Recognizing this life-threatening condition is critical, as it requires emergency surgery to release the torsion or resect the affected lobe. Thrombosis in the pulmonary vein (PV) stump Thrombosis within the pulmonary vein (PV) stump is a significant concern due to its potential for systemic embolization, including cerebral infarction. This complication may arise at any stage, from days to months postoperatively. A known risk factor is left upper lobectomy, as the left superior PV stump is anatomically longer than the remaining three pulmonary veins, predisposing it to thrombus formation [ 37 39 40 19 Fig. 19 Thrombosis in the pulmonary vein stump. Eight months after left upper lobectomy, contrast-enhanced coronal CT shows a relatively elongated left superior pulmonary vein stump with a filling defect, consistent with thrombus formation (arrow) Conclusion This review has outlined the expected postoperative imaging findings and the spectrum of complications that may arise following lung cancer surgery. Postoperative complications vary widely in presentation and severity, ranging from benign self-limiting changes to life-threatening conditions requiring urgent intervention. Accurate radiologic interpretation is crucial for distinguishing between expected postoperative changes and true pathologic findings. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the radiologic features of normal postoperative changes and complications is essential for avoiding unnecessary diagnostic workups, ensuring early detection, and optimizing patient management.
