Introduction Robotic assistance has revolutionized abdominal surgery by addressing the limitations of conventional laparoscopic techniques. Key advantages include enhanced visualization, superior dexterity, and improved precision, which contribute to its growing adoption in urological procedures [ 1 1 2 3 4 5 There are several nephrometry scoring systems (NSS) that are used to assess renal tumours prior to surgery. Among the NSS are the Preoperative Aspects and Dimensions Used for Anatomical (PADUA) classification; the Radius, Exophytic/Endophytic, Nearness, Anterior/Posterior, Location (RENAL) nephrometry score, centrality index (C-index), diameter-axial-polar (DAP) Nephrometry, and the Arterial-Based Complexity (ABC) scoring systems have been developed to classify renal tumours according to anatomical distributions [ 6 7 Radical nephrectomy has been the standard treatment of localized renal tumours; however, utilization of nephron-sparing surgery or partial nephrectomy was recommended in smaller tumours due to equivalent oncological outcomes with reduced incidence of adverse events in terms of loss of renal function and cardiovascular risk [ 8 9 5 10 11 12 13 14 15 Globally, RAPN has been established as a safe and effective approach even for highly complex renal tumours, with Western series reporting perioperative and oncological outcomes comparable to those in less complex cases [ 9 16 17 18 This retrospective study evaluates the outcomes of RAPN in managing complex renal tumours (RENAL nephrometry score ≥ 9) at a single tertiary care centre in Malaysia. Warm ischemic time perioperative blood loss, postoperative changes in renal function, length of hospital stay, and surgical margins are the key metrics analyzed to establish the efficacy and safety of this method. The findings aim to contribute valuable insights into the feasibility and effectiveness of RAPN in managing complex renal tumours within this unique regional context. With growing experience in RAPN, its role in managing complex renal tumours should be further explored to justify its potential benefits. More robust data are needed to confirm the feasibility of RAPN as a first-line management option for complex renal tumours, potentially replacing radical nephrectomy. 2. Materials and Methods This study involves a retrospective review of a database that has been prospectively maintained, assessing the results of RAPN conducted by a single surgeon at our institution from January 2023 to June 2024. All patients who underwent RAPN during this period were included, utilizing both transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches. 2.1. Data Collection Data collected included patient demographics, tumour characteristics (such as location, size, and complexity), perioperative parameters (including warm ischemia time and blood loss volume), and renal function metrics (both pre- and post-operative serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]). The difference between the post- and pre-operative values was used for the change in eGFR. Meanwhile, the RENAL nephrometry scoring system was used to assess the tumour complexity, with scores ≥ 9 categorized as highly complex renal tumours. The evaluation of histopathological examination and surgical margin status were also carried out. 2.2. Surgical Techniques All surgeries were performed by a single urologist with extensive experience in minimally invasive and robotic urologic procedures. This consistency helped standardize surgical technique and decision-making across all cases. For this study, both the transperitoneal and retroperitoneal approaches were used for RAPN, depending on the tumour location. The docking of the robotic system and surgical steps were standardized for all cases. Transperitoneal Approach Figure 1 Retroperitoneal Approach Figure 2 19 Both approaches aim to minimize warm ischemia time (maintained under 30 min wherever possible), ensure complete tumour excision, and achieve secure haemostasis. 2.3. Statistical Analysis SPSS version 26.0 for Windows was used to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics were utilized, with parametric data shown as the mean ± standard deviation and non-parametric data displayed as the median with interquartile range. Normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. For normally distributed continuous variables, Pearson’s correlation was used to assess linear relationships between tumour complexity and operative metrics (e.g., warm ischemia time, blood loss). Independent-samples t p 2.4. Ethics Statement This study was carried out adhering to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (revised 2013). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Research Ethics Committee of The National University of Malaysia (IRB no. JEP-2024-804). Written informed consent for surgery was obtained from all patients prior to the procedure. The necessity to obtain additional consent for data publication was waived by the Institutional Review Board of the National University of Malaysia due to the retrospective study design. 2.5. Outcomes The primary outcome of the study was achieving the ‘trifecta’, defined as negative surgical margins, absence of severe perioperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ II), and preservation of renal function or a warm ischaemia time of less than 25 min. Secondary outcomes included operative time, warm ischemia time, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, and changes in renal function. 3. Results A total of 35 patients, comprising 21 males and 14 females with a mean age of 53.37 ± 15.52 years, underwent RAPN during the study period ( Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 Figure 3 3.1. Correlation Analysis Higher RENAL nephrometry scores were moderately associated with longer warm ischemia times (correlation coefficient: 0.35) and greater intraoperative blood loss (correlation coefficient: 0.47). A weak positive correlation was observed with length of hospital stay (correlation coefficient: 0.27), while changes in postoperative creatinine levels showed a negligible correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.07). These findings indicate that increased tumour complexity is associated with greater surgical challenges and marginally prolonged recovery times. Creatinine levels remain stable when warm ischemia time (WIT) is less than 20 min, and minimal normal parenchymal tissue is excised, as observed in most of our cases. 3.2. Comparative Analysis of Surgical Approaches An independent-samples t p p p p 3.3. Warm Ischemia Time and Renal Function The correlation between warm ischaemia time (WIT), and the percentage change in serum creatinine was negligible and negative (r = −0.04, p 2 p 3.4. Operative Console Time and Tumour Complexity The correlation between the RENAL nephrometry score and operative console time was weakly positive (r = 0.22), suggesting a slight increase in operative console time with higher tumour complexity; however, this relationship was not statistically significant ( p p 3.5. “Trifecta” Achievement and Complications The “trifecta” outcome, absence of severe perioperative complications, negative surgical margins, and preservation of renal function, was achieved in 31 patients (88.6%). There were four cases (11.4%) of Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥ 2 complications ( Table 5 3.6. Histopathological Findings The histopathological findings reveal a diverse range of tumour types among the patients who underwent robot-assisted partial nephrectomy. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma was the most common, identified in twenty-two patients, followed by angiomyolipoma in seven patients. Additionally, two patients exhibited papillary RCC, and another two had multiloculated cystic RCC. Notably, a rare case of Ewing sarcoma of the kidney was also observed. Importantly, none of the cases showed a positive surgical margin, and no local recurrence or port-site metastases were detected in RCC patients during the mean follow-up period of 11.31 ± 5.78 months. 4. Discussion This study demonstrates that RAPN is a safe and effective surgical option for managing complex renal tumours, defined by a RENAL nephrometry score of ≥9. The favourable perioperative and postoperative outcomes align with findings reported in the literature, emphasizing the role of RAPN in handling high-complexity renal tumours [ 13 14 20 The correlation analysis revealed that higher RENAL nephrometry scores were moderately associated with longer warm ischemia times and greater intraoperative blood loss. This finding aligns with the established challenges of managing complex renal tumours, which often require meticulous dissection and reconstruction. Longer ischemic durations are sometimes necessary to balance tumour resection and parenchymal preservation [ 13 14 20 21 Our strategic approach of tailoring the surgical technique to tumour location likely contributed to the favourable outcomes observed. Generally, the retroperitoneal approach was preferred for upper pole, midline, and posteriorly located tumours, while the transperitoneal approach was favoured for lower-pole and anteriorly located tumours. This selection allowed for direct access to the tumour, facilitating optimum excision and suturing. The retroperitoneal approach provides better access to the renal hilum and reduces blood loss compared to the transperitoneal approach. This finding aligns with studies that report reduced bleeding due to optimized visualization in retroperitoneal surgeries [ 12 14 The mean WIT of 15.03 ± 5.84 min in this study is consistent with reported averages for RAPN, typically ranging from 15 to 18 min [ 19 22 13 14 23 The complete negative surgical margin rate and the absence of local recurrences or port-site metastases during a mean follow-up of 11.31 ± 5.78 months underscore the oncological safety of RAPN for managing complex renal tumours. These findings are consistent with the existing literature, which reports excellent long-term cancer control with RAPN [ 14 24 25 26 The high rate of ‘trifecta’ achievement (88.6%), defined as the absence of severe perioperative complications, negative surgical margins, and preservation of renal function, underscores the efficacy and safety of RAPN in managing complex kidney tumours. The low rate of significant complications further supports its utility, with only 11.4% of patients experiencing Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥ 2 events. These outcomes emphasize the reliability of RAPN for treating complex renal tumours [ 27 28 28 Evidence on RAPN for highly complex renal tumours is limited in Asia. Sharma et al. [ 16 6 17 18 Our study directly addresses this gap by being the first to report RAPN outcomes for complex renal tumours in Malaysia, thereby contributing valuable data to the Southeast Asian literature. While studies from broader Asian regions, such as China and South Korea, have demonstrated RAPN’s safety and efficacy for complex tumours, comparable regional data have been lacking [ 20 28 29 30 31 17 The scarcity of region-specific studies underscores the need for more research on RAPN outcomes in Southeast Asia. Factors such as genetic diversity, healthcare infrastructure, and surgical expertise may influence outcomes, making it essential to contextualize findings within the region. According to a study, experienced surgeons for RAPN were linked to lower operative time, WIT, and major postoperative complications [ 4 This study has a number of limitations. Its retrospective nature and small sample size reduce statistical power and limit the generalizability of the findings. Although the outcomes align with the existing global literature, these results should be interpreted with caution. Another limitation is the relatively short follow-up duration (mean 11.3 months), which does not allow for the assessment of long-term oncologic outcomes such as recurrence or metastatic progression. Future larger, multi-centre studies with extended follow-up are required to confirm the robustness and durability of these findings and to provide stronger evidence for clinical practice. Comparative studies between RAPN and alternative surgical approaches could also further delineate its advantages for complex renal tumours. 5. Conclusions This study demonstrates that RAPN is a safe and effective surgical approach for managing complex renal tumours (RENAL nephrometry score ≥ 9), achieving high rates of ‘trifecta’ outcomes. The procedure resulted in positive perioperative and oncological outcomes, such as reduced blood loss, maintained renal function, and lack of positive surgical margins, even in highly complex cases. The choice of approach, whether transperitoneal or retroperitoneal, should be tailored to the characteristics of the tumour to optimize surgical outcomes. This study represents a significant contribution to the limited data on RAPN outcomes in Southeast Asia, specifically in Malaysia, and aligns with global findings that highlight RAPN as a reliable option for nephron-sparing surgery. Despite being a single-centre study with a modest sample size, this is the first Malaysian study evaluating RAPN for complex renal tumours, and offers important preliminary data. Future larger-scale, multi-centre studies are warranted to validate and expand upon these findings.
