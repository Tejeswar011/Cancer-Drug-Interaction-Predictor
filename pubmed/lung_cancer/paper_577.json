This review explores the evolving landscape of precision medicine in COPD management, with particular emphasis on optimizing patient care through the integration of phenotypes, endotypes, biomarkers, and treatable traits. Phenotypic classification based on observable clinical and radiographic features has facilitated the identification of distinct subgroups such as “emphysema-dominant” or “frequent-exacerbator” subtypes. Emerging research, however, increasingly emphasizes endotypes—disease subcategories defined by unique biological mechanisms including neutrophilic inflammation, eosinophilic airway involvement, or α 1 Keywords Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Precision medicine Phenotype Endotype Biomarker Treatable traits Targeted therapies the Special Funding of the Department of Xinjiang Human Resources and Social Security for “Outstanding Postdoctoral Researchers” and “Tianchi Scholar - Young Doctor Program” Shenzhen Municipal Government’s “Three Famous Health Project” National Natural Science Foundation of China 82474264 Dong Jingcheng pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) stands as one of the globe’s predominant respiratory health challenges, characterized by significant disability and mortality rates [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 The recent paradigm shift toward precision medicine has catalyzed efforts to tailor interventions according to individual disease characteristics, transitioning from symptom-based classification to a more detailed, mechanism-oriented framework. Key concepts for achieving this goal include phenotypes (observable clinical manifestations), endotypes (molecular or pathophysiological subtypes), and treatable traits (detectable and targetable disease features within individuals) [ 7 8 The heterogeneity of COPD COPD is a highly heterogeneous respiratory disorder with pathological features varying in multiple aspects, including the degree of airway remodeling, inflammatory response, airflow distribution, and the extent of alveolar emphysema, etc [ 3 9 1 10 11 12 13 14 15 15 16 17 The 2023 GOLD report acknowledges the etiologic heterogeneity of COPD and introduces a novel classification methodology termed “ etiotypes 8 17 8 18 19 19 20 Besides causal factors, COPD heterogeneity is evident in its pathophysiology and clinical course. Some patients experience frequent acute exacerbations while others remain stable; [ 21 22 23 24 Clinical phenotypes of COPD Moving from causes to consequences, COPD heterogeneity becomes apparent in diverse clinical phenotypes, which are further subdivided by observable clinical features and prognostic differences. The clinical phenotypes of COPD refer to one or several disease characteristics that can reflect the differences among COPD patients, and are associated with clinical outcomes (e.g., symptoms, exacerbations, treatment responses, disease progression rates, or mortality) [ 25 13 17 17 1  Fig. 1 Multi-scale heterogeneity in COPD. COPD arises through dynamic interactions across genetic, cellular, and systemic levels, driven by individual variations in host-environment responses that shape distinct clinical phenotypes and endotypes. ASM It is important to clarify the conceptual distinction between phenotypes and endotypes to avoid confusion. A phenotype refers to a collection of observable clinical characteristics such as symptoms, exacerbation frequency, lung function trajectories, or imaging patterns that can be readily identified in clinical practice. In contrast, an endotype represents the underlying biological or molecular mechanisms that give rise to these observable traits. Notably, a single phenotype may correspond to multiple distinct endotypes. For example, the frequent exacerbator phenotype may result from an eosinophilic inflammation driven endotype or from an infection dominant endotype, each with distinct therapeutic implications. This layered framework highlights why phenotypic classification is clinically valuable but ultimately requires integration with mechanistic endotypes for precision management. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema phenotypes of COPD The first edition of the GOLD guidelines, published in 2001, did not differentiate between emphysema and chronic bronchitis [ 13 17 2 2 2 2 26 27 28 P 29 30 31 COPD with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) refer to incidental findings of pulmonary interstitial anomalies in patients without known interstitial lung diseases (ILD) [ 32 33 CO 34 35 Non-smoking COPD Non-smoking-related COPD accounts for 20–50% of cases across both developed and developing countries [ 5 36 4 37 38 39 40 1 19 Acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) AECOPD is defined as a critical clinical phase in COPD patients characterized by worsening of dyspnea, cough, and sputum production within 14 days, potentially accompanied by tachypnea and tachycardia. These episodes are typically triggered by enhanced local and systemic inflammatory responses associated with respiratory infections, air pollution, or other factors causing airway damage [ 17 41 42 43 44 45 45 46 Haemophilus Moraxella 47 47 Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) ACO also constitutes a clinically significant phenotype, characterized by patients exhibiting features of COPD alongside a history of asthma or evidence of allergy, positive bronchodilator response, or eosinophilic inflammation [ 48 49 7 Early disease States of COPD The lung function trajectories of COPD patients exhibit significant heterogeneity [ 10 50 51 51 51 52 Pre-COPD is considered a potential precursor stage of the disease, defined as having abnormal spirometric measurements or significant emphysema shown on chest CT scans without airflow obstruction. A population-based study employing CT or microCT quantification found that compared to controls, individuals with pre-COPD and those across all GOLD grades had a significant reduction in the number of transitional bronchioles (TrB)/ml and terminal bronchioles (TB)/ml. 53 53 53 54 1 z 54 54 Early-onset COPD in young adults is defined as occurring in individuals aged 20–50 years who never achieved normal peak lung function in early adulthood or experienced an accelerated decline in lung function. The future development and progression of COPD in this group have attracted attention. Investigations have operationalized COPD-susceptible states as chronic bronchitis, PRISm, or early airflow limitation (FEV 1 55 CI CI CI CI 55 The concept of PRISm has garnered significant attention since its introduction, recognized as a transitional state toward COPD and a high-risk subtype prone to COPD development or acute exacerbations [ 56 1 56 57 58 1 58 59 Prognostically, PRISm is clinically important because approximately one-third of patients progress to overt COPD, while others remain stable or even revert to normal spirometry. In addition to pulmonary outcomes, PRISm is strongly associated with increased cardiometabolic comorbidities and higher all-cause mortality. Imaging adds prognostic granularity: parametric response mapping (PRM) can help distinguish airway-dominant versus emphysema-dominant trajectories, providing early risk stratification. Notably, PRISm demonstrates higher prevalence among males and active smokers—groups already identified as high-risk populations for COPD [ 60 61 1 56 60 62 63 In summary, the aforementioned phenotypes illustrate the diverse manifestations of COPD across individuals. Importantly, these phenotypes are not mutually exclusive. For instance, an individual may present as an emphysema-dominant frequent exacerbator with concurrent ACO features. Nevertheless, phenotypic classification holds significant clinical implications, enabling clinicians to tailor therapeutic strategies accordingly. For example, patients with eosinophilic ACO phenotypes may respond favorably to inhaled corticosteroid therapy, whereas those with pure emphysema lacking eosinophilic inflammation may not [ 64 7 65 66 64 Molecular endotypes of COPD An endotype is defined as a subtype of a disease condition characterized by a specific pathobiological mechanism or molecular profile, which may or may not correspond directly to a visible clinical phenotype [ 8 Neutrophil-predominant (“type 2-low”) endotype This endotype is defined by dominant airway neutrophilic inflammation mediated through interleukin (IL)−1, IL-8, and Th17 (type 17 T helper cell)/IL-17 pathways, distinct from type 2 cytokine-driven mechanisms. It aligns with the classical smoking-associated chronic bronchitis phenotype, clinically characterized by chronic cough, sputum hypersecretion, bacterial colonization, and inflammation resistant to corticosteroid therapy. Biologically, these patients demonstrate elevated IL-17 levels and neutrophil-specific chemotactic factors, underpinned by a well-defined molecular cascade (Fig. 2 67 67 68 68 68 69 68 69  Fig. 2 Dichotomous cytokine profiles in COPD endotypes: neutrophil-centric inflammasome pathway (“T2-low” COPD) versus eosinophil-dependent type 2 immunity (“T2-high” COPD), depicting mechanism-specific responses to environmental stimuli. DC MMP PGD TSLP Clinically, this endotype correlates with accelerated lung function decline and recurrent infectious exacerbations. Given the limited efficacy of ICS—and potential pneumonia risk—alternative therapies targeting neutrophilic pathways are under investigation. Anti-IL-17 biologics (e.g., secukinumab) show preliminary potential in attenuating airway remodeling in neutrophilic-dominant patients, though clinical validation remains pending [ 70 71 An infectious sub-endotype, marked by acute/chronic airway infections, may exist within this spectrum. Impaired barrier function predisposes to microbial dysbiosis and colonization, with pollutants driving ILC2-to-ILC1 polarization, amplifying type 1 inflammatory cascades [ 72 Haemophilus influenzae Pseudomonas 73 76 H. influenzae 77 78 Eosinophil-predominant (“type 2-high”) endotype Initially, COPD-related inflammation was considered to be solely driven by type 1 immune responses, involving CD4 + + 69 79 79 CI 44 80 81 82 83 The type 2 inflammatory milieu in COPD involves multiple cellular players, including Th2 cells, ILC2s, B cells, eosinophils, basophils, mast cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and M2 macrophages [ 84 86 84 85 2 87 87 87 90 91 86 92 93 87 94 95 94 Pathologically, IL-4– and IL-13–mediated processes align with hallmark COPD features such as airway barrier disruption, mucus plug formation, fibrotic remodeling, and emphysema. These changes culminate in airflow limitation, persistent dyspnea, chronic cough, progressive lung function decline, and acute exacerbations. Therapeutically, precision approaches targeting type-2/eosinophilic inflammation have matured. Anti-IL-5 therapy with mepolizumab reduced annualized moderate–severe exacerbations when added to triple therapy in eosinophil-high COPD (MATINEE phase 3), providing confirmatory evidence for IL-5 pathway inhibition in appropriately enriched populations [ 96 97 98 99 Rare genetic endotypes Certain rare genetic mutations cause COPD via specific molecular mechanisms. The best-known example is Alpha-1 Antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 100 101 102 103 Persistent inflammation/autoimmune endotype A subset of COPD patients exhibit evidence of systemic autoimmune features or persistent inflammation unlinked to smoking exposure alone [ 104 106 107 108 109 19 Pulmonary vascular endotype A minority of COPD patients develop disproportionate pulmonary hypertension relative to their airway obstruction. These patients exhibit a pulmonary vascular phenotype marked by severe dyspnea and very low diffusing capacity out of proportion to spirometric impairment, due to extensive vascular remodeling in the lungs [ 110 When this equilibrium is disturbed, divergent pathological trajectories emerge. Sustained HIF-2α activation (e.g., due to chronic hypoxia or PHD2 [prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2] loss) stabilizes endothelial HIF-2α, which (i) induces endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) via SNAI1/2 [ 111 112 113 Conversely, loss of endothelial HIF-2α disrupts the alveolar–capillary niche and precipitates emphysema: endothelial Hif-2α deletion or VEGF-pathway blockade in mice causes airspace enlargement, whereas restoring VEGF preserves alveolarization [ 114 110 Although pulmonary vasodilator therapies are not standard for COPD-PH outside trials, preclinical HIF-2α inhibition (e.g., PT2385, PT2567; genetic reversal of HIF-2–driven remodeling) can attenuate established pulmonary hypertension and reverse vascular changes while identifying the HIF-2α axis as a tractable target in patients with a vascular endotype, awaiting biomarker-guided enrichment and clinical validation [ 115 The increasingly sophisticated omics technologies are unveiling COPD endotypes that cannot be identified through clinical observation alone. Through integrated analyses of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, researchers have revealed distinct molecular signatures in COPD patients. For instance, a recent multi-layered network analysis of lung tissue integrating mRNA, microRNA, and DNA methylation data revealed five molecular patient clusters with divergent underlying biological characteristics [ 116 116 COPD endotypes are not isolated compartments – they interact and often coexist. For example, chronic colonization with bacteria (“infection endotype”) will drive neutrophilic inflammation; conversely, long-term ICS treatment for eosinophilic COPD can increase pneumonia risk and potentially shift microbiome balance [ 117 118 117 96 99 117 Candidate biomarkers of COPD Identifying phenotypes and endotypes in practice relies on biomarkers—measurable indicators of specific disease processes. In COPD, biomarkers span a spectrum ranging from clinical surrogates (e.g., chronic sputum production as a marker of mucus hypersecretion) to sophisticated molecular assays. An ideal biomarker in COPD may function in one or more of the following capacities: predicting prognosis (e.g., risk of exacerbations or mortality), predicting or monitoring therapeutic responses (i.e., theragnostic biomarkers), or elucidating underlying endotypes to enable targeted therapies (endotype classifiers). Below, we examine key established and emerging biomarkers in COPD, emphasizing their roles in prognostication, treatment personalization, and mechanistic characterization of disease heterogeneity. Circulating biomarkers The peripheral eosinophil count has emerged as one of the most useful biomarkers in COPD [ 119 120 94 118 118 80 121 118 122 118 117 In addition to eosinophils, various blood proteins offer a minimally invasive strategy for investigating systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and molecular signatures associated with COPD pathogenesis [ 123 124 Elevated plasma fibrinogen and soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) levels in numerous COPD patients with systemic inflammation correlate with reduced pulmonary function, COPD symptoms, and exacerbation frequency, enabling risk stratification of high-risk populations prone to frequent exacerbations [ 125 127 128 IL-6 and IL-8 profiles exhibit distinct clinical implications: elevated IL-6 correlates with mortality and muscle wasting, while IL-8 reflects neutrophilic inflammation [ 129 130 131 132 Circulating biomarkers indicative of extracellular matrix remodeling (e.g., MMPs, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases [TIMPs]) and endothelial dysfunction (e.g., endothelin-1, von Willebrand factor) may offer prognostic insights into disease progression and cardiovascular complications in COPD patients [ 133 Sputum biomarkers Analysis of induced sputum provides a window into airway inflammation [ 134 135 135 Lung tissue-based biomarkers Lung tissue-derived biomarkers have attracted considerable attention due to their unique capacity to directly reflect pathological characteristics at disease sites [ 136 + Lung tissue samples obtained from former smokers undergoing clinically indicated thoracic surgeries have been instrumental in multi-omics investigations of COPD pathogenesis. In one analytical framework, researchers identified 4,997 genes associated with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) below genome-wide significance thresholds, subsequently constructing gene regulatory networks. The top-ranked gene, MAPT 137 138 139 140 Biomarkers based on type 2/non-type 2 inflammatory microenvironments Early observations indicated the involvement of neutrophils, CD8 + + 69 141 142 143 144 145 146 1 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 Imaging biomarkers The imaging biomarkers of COPD are primarily manifested as structural alterations in the pulmonary parenchyma, airways, and vascular system [ 159 160 Mucus plugging on chest CT is common in COPD (≈ 25–67%), often persists over time, and is associated with lower FEV 1 161 162 163 Vascular abnormalities manifest as peripheral vascular pruning and pulmonary hypertension-associated main pulmonary artery dilation. Air trapping on expiratory CT appears as mosaic attenuation, indicating small airway dysfunction. New imaging tools like PRM enhance diagnostic granularity by integrating inspiratory and expiratory CT data to spatially differentiate emphysematous tissue (PRM emph fSAD 159 164 Functional imaging modalities complement these structural evaluations: hyperpolarized gas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) maps regional ventilation patterns with sensitivity to detect small-airway abnormalities prior to observable CT changes, while positron emission tomography (PET)-MRI fusion imaging offers insights into localized inflammation and perfusion defects that could guide targeted anti-inflammatory therapies. The clinical translation of these biomarkers is reshaping therapeutic decision-making. CT-defined emphysema distribution patterns directly inform eligibility for lung volume reduction surgery, particularly in upper-lobe predominant disease. Similarly, detecting covert bronchiectasis via CT in chronic bronchitis patients necessitates adjunct therapies like airway clearance maneuvers and prophylactic antibiotics. PRM-based endotyping holds promise for personalized interventions, as patients with high PRM emph Emerging technologies like radiomics and AI-driven image analysis revolutionize COPD subtyping through automated extraction of imperceptible features—textural heterogeneity and vascular morphometry [ 165 166 Treatable traits approach While phenotypes and endotypes classify COPD at a population level, the treatable traits strategy operationalizes precision medicine at the individual patient level [ 167 168 169 The treatable traits paradigm was first extensively applied in severe asthma and is now being adapted for COPD [ 170 171 Pulmonary traits encompass specific lung-related pathological features. Airway eosinophilia may be managed with ICS or anti-IL5 biologics, while chronic bronchitis with mucus hypersecretion often requires mucolytics combined with airway clearance techniques. Patients experiencing frequent exacerbations benefit from prophylactic therapies, and those with fixed airflow obstruction accompanied by hyperinflation typically require a combination of bronchodilators, pulmonary rehabilitation, and potentially lung volume reduction procedures. Comorbid conditions like bronchiectasis warrant antibiotic therapy and physiotherapy, whereas ACO should follow asthma management protocols. Notably, upper airway pathologies such as chronic rhinosinusitis represent treatable traits whose management can positively influence lower airway symptoms. Extrapulmonary traits address systemic manifestations and comorbidities. Nutritional interventions and exercise programs form the cornerstone for managing sarcopenia or cachexia, sometimes supplemented with anabolic agents. Cardiovascular risk reduction involves aggressive risk factor modification and judicious use of β-blockers. Osteoporosis management includes calcium/vitamin D supplementation and bisphosphonates, while psychological comorbidities like anxiety/depression require integrated approaches combining behavioral therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation. Persistent systemic inflammation, though lacking direct therapeutic targets, serves as a biomarker for heightened monitoring and potential eligibility for anti-inflammatory clinical trials. Behavioral/risk factor traits focus on modifiable health behaviors and environmental exposures. Smoking cessation support remains paramount, complemented by strategies to improve inhaler technique and medication adherence through patient education and regimen simplification. Physical inactivity requires structured pulmonary rehabilitation programs, while environmental exposures demand protective measures against pollutants and occupational hazards. Socioeconomic factors including health literacy deficits and social isolation necessitate tailored interventions through support networks and educational initiatives. Addressing these traits not only slows disease progression but also potentiates the effectiveness of other targeted therapies. The GOLD guidelines recognize dyspnea and the occurrence of exacerbations as two pivotal identifiable and treatable traits in COPD [ 18 172 173 Emerging evidence highlights chronic bronchial bacterial colonization as another critical treatable trait requiring targeted intervention [ 174 175 176 176 177 The treatable traits approach, fundamentally aligned with precision medicine paradigms, acknowledges the multidimensional nature of individual patients as composite entities comprising multiple characteristics that exist along dynamic spectrums of expression [ 178 179 Increasing amounts of empirical evidence substantiates the clinical validity of this model. Implementation of multidimensional trait-based assessments and management in COPD populations has demonstrated superior improvements in health status compared to conventional care [ 168 168 180 181 Major clinical guidelines increasingly endorse this paradigm, with both GOLD and The Lancet Commission advocating enhanced phenotypic and biological characterization to inform personalized COPD management [ 3 7 168 168 182 182 Ultimately, the treatable traits paradigm transcends the traditional one-size-fits-all approach through personalized therapeutic targeting strategies, enabling the implementation of precision medicine for COPD. Conceptually distinct from phenotypic and endotypic systems that provide population-based research frameworks, it nevertheless draws upon both when identifying specific characteristics in individual patients. Proven clinical advantages and increasing incorporation into guidelines signal an impending paradigm shift towards personalized respiratory care; however, systematic adaptation remains essential to fully realize its potential across diverse healthcare settings [ 168 Conclusions and future directions COPD has entered the era of precision medicine, driven by evolving insights into its heterogeneous phenotypes, distinct endotypes, and treatable traits. Contemporary understanding recognizes COPD not as a singular entity but as a convergence of interrelated biological pathways manifesting as airflow limitation [ 183 184 185 186 The coming years will likely see combinatorial biomarker algorithms that integrate readily available clinical metrics (e.g., blood eosinophils), cytokine profiles, and quantitative imaging parameters (e.g., PRM-defined fSAD/emphysema) to guide therapeutic allocation and clinical-trial enrichment. Machine-learning applications to multidimensional datasets are enabling data-driven subgroups with potential therapeutic implications, but translation will require harmonized pipelines and transparent model reporting [ 44 187 On the therapeutic front, while no single “magic bullet” has emerged, the pipeline is rich. Biologics targeting upstream alarmins (e.g., IL-33/TSLP) and downstream cytokines (e.g., IL-1β, IL-6) aim to disrupt inflammatory redundancy; cell-based and regenerative approaches represent long-term precision strategies for emphysema. Precision principles are also permeating rehabilitation, identifying non-responders who may benefit from adjunct anabolic strategies or tailored exercise regimens, and pharmacogenomic signals continue to be explored for bronchodilator response. Implementation, however, must balance individualization with public-health fundamentals: smoking cessation and equitable access to guideline-based care remain central. Economic considerations are non-trivial, with cost-effectiveness often driven by baseline exacerbation risk and mortality effects, and varying across patient subgroups, which highlights the importance of responder enrichment in both trials and practice [ 188 96 189 This evolving paradigm is akin to oncology’s mutation-driven treatment models, positioning COPD management at the threshold of personalized care. Through comprehensive characterization of individual phenotypic signatures, inflammatory endotypes, and treatable traits, clinicians can implement multidimensional management strategies. Priorities now include standardized, externally validated multi-omic pipelines; longitudinal, outcome-anchored endotyping to capture dynamic biology; pragmatic trial designs that test biomarker-guided strategies; and robust health-economic evaluations of treatable-trait programs across diverse health systems. If achieved, these steps should translate into fewer exacerbations, better quality of life, slower disease progression, and a shift from terminal trajectories to chronic, controllable care tailored to the individual. As evidence accumulates, precision medicine approaches may fulfill their potential to rewrite the therapeutic narrative of this complex respiratory syndrome.
