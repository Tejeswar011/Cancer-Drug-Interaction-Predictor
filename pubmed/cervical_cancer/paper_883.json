The transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channels have been implicated in modulating the polarization of aquaporin‐4 (AQP4), a key protein involved in GS function. This study investigates the potential of targeting TRPV4 to alleviate GS dysfunction and reduce cerebral edema following ischemic stroke. TRPV4 inhibitor HC067047 or a vehicle was administered via lateral ventricle cannulation in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R). The function of the GS was assessed through tracer injection experiments, including in vivo transcranial imaging, ex vivo brain tissue and section analysis, and fluorescence retention in deep cervical lymph nodes (dCLNs). Cerebral edema was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging. AQP4 polarization and β‐dystroglycan (β‐DG) expression were evaluated by immunofluorescence. Western blotting was employed to measure protein levels of β‐DG, matrix metalloproteinase‐9 (MMP9), and Ras homolog family member A (RhoA). Long‐term neurological outcomes were assessed via behavioral testing. MCAO/R mice exhibited significant GS dysfunction, cerebral edema, and disrupted AQP4 polarization. Additionally, β‐DG expression was markedly reduced, while TRPV4 expression was elevated in the ischemic penumbra. Western blotting revealed increased expression of MMP9 and RhoA. The inhibition of TRPV4 by HC067047 significantly improved GS function, reduced cerebral edema, and enhanced neurological recovery. Mechanistically, HC067047 partially restored AQP4 polarization, upregulated β‐DG expression, and suppressed the expression of MMP9 and RhoA. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of TRPV4 inhibition in ischemic stroke by restoring GS function, mitigating cerebral edema, and promoting neurological recovery, thereby positioning TRPV4 as a promising target for future interventions. After ischemic stroke, TRPV4 activation induces cerebral edema through the TRPV4‐RhoA‐MMP9 axis: RhoA upregulates MMP9, which cleaves β‐DG to impair membrane anchoring. Subsequent β‐DG loss triggers AQP4 depolarization, disrupting GS‐mediated water homeostasis. This cascade establishes β‐DG/AQP4 dysregulation as the core pathogenic mechanism of edema. aquaporin‐4 cerebral edema glymphatic system ischemic stroke transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 the President Foundation of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University 2023A005 Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province 10.13039/501100021171 2023A1515110506 Health China BuChang ZhiYuan Public welfare projects for Heart and brain health HIGHER2023032 National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/501100001809 82171345 the Postdoctoral Fellowship Program of CPSF GZC20231066 the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation 2024M751319 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date November 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Li Y Zhou H Xie J Yu M Ye G Zhang Y Targeting TRPV4 Brain Pathology 2025 35 6 e70022 10.1111/bpa.70022 PMC12488257 40481713 Yongchuan Li, Haiping Zhou, Jiaxin Xie, Mingjia Yu contributed equally. 1 INTRODUCTION Stroke is the second leading cause of mortality globally and the primary contributor to long‐term disability [ 1 2 3 4 5 The glymphatic system (GS) is a recently identified system for waste removal in the brain [ 6 6 7 6 8 9 10 AQP4 is a tetrameric transmembrane channel protein that facilitates rapid transport of water and solutes. Under normal physiological conditions, AQP4 is primarily localized to the endfeet of perivascular astrocytes, a process referred to as AQP4 polarization, which is closely associated with the proper functioning of the GS [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a cation channel located in cell membranes, which exhibits selective permeability to Ca 2+ 20 21 22 23 22 24 25 Ras homolog family member A (RhoA), a small GTPase, has been demonstrated to structurally associate with TRPV4 via cryo‐electron microscopy [ 26 27 28 29 30 18 19 2 METHODS 2.1 Animals All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University (IACUC‐LAC‐20230920‐002) and complied with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Male C57BL/6J mice (8–10 weeks old, 22–25 g body weight) were purchased from Risemice Biotechnology (Zhaoqing, China). Animals were housed in a specific pathogen‐free facility under a 12‐hour light/dark cycle at a controlled temperature of 23 ± 2°C, with ad libitum access to food and water. Efforts were made to minimize both animal suffering and the number of animals used. Unless otherwise indicated, all molecular and imaging analyses were performed at the 24‐h post‐reperfusion endpoint. 2.2 Establishment of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion ( MCAO As previously described [ 9 31 S1 2.3 Drug treatment MMP9‐specific inhibitor SB‐3CT (Cat # HY‐12354) was purchased from MedChem Express and intraperitoneally injected to MCAO/R mice with the dose of 25 mg/kg at the onset of reperfusion and 24 h post‐reperfusion. The TRPV4‐specific inhibitor HC067047 (Cat # HY‐100208) was purchased from MedChem Express, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a 10 mM stock solution, and stored at −80°C. Prior to experiments, the stock was diluted with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) to a working concentration of 10 μM. Vehicle control solutions contained equivalent volumes of DMSO diluted in aCSF, with final DMSO concentrations <1% (v/v). 24 h prior to MCAO/R modeling, mice underwent lateral ventricular cannulation under isoflurane anesthesia. Mice were fixed in a stereotaxic apparatus, and a stainless steel guide cannula (30‐gauge) was implanted into the left lateral ventricle (coordinates: 0.34 mm posterior, 1.0 mm lateral, and 2.5 mm ventral to bregma) and secured with dental cement (Figure S2 25 2.4 In vivo imaging of GS Once the mice were anesthetized and positioned on a mouse adapter as previously described [ 9 32 2.5 Ex vivo imaging of GS To assess GS influx function, ex vivo fluorescence imaging was performed as previously described. [ 33 2.6 Ex vivo imaging of ISF To evaluate interstitial solute clearance from the brain to dCLNs post‐MCAO/R, a modified protocol was employed. Briefly, 2 μL of Alexa Fluor 555–ovalbumin (OVA‐555; 0.5 mg/mL in aCSF; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # O34782 2.7 Immunofluorescence staining Mice were euthanized by cardiac perfusion with ice‐cold PBS, followed by brain fixation in PFA. Brains were fixed in PFA for 24 h, rinsed with PBS, and then cryoprotected using 30% sucrose in PBS. Coronal brain sections (50 μm thick) were obtained using a cryostat microtome (CM3050, Leica). Sections were transferred to 24‐well plates containing 1 mL PBS and washed thrice with PBS. Non‐specific binding was blocked with a solution of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% Triton X‐100. Subsequently, the sections were incubated at 4°C with primary antibodies (1:1000, anti‐AQP4 antibody, Proteintech, Cat # 16473‐1‐AP; 1:50, Rat anti‐CD31, BD Bioscience, Cat # 550274; 1:1000, anti‐β‐DG, Proteintech, Cat # 11017‐1‐AP; 1:50, anti‐TRPV4, Beyotime, Cat # AF8253;1:1000, anti‐GFAP, Oasis Biofarm, Cat # OB‐PRT001‐02) overnight. After removal of the primary antibody, sections were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:200, goat anti‐rabbit IgG H&L [Alexa Fluor 488], Proteintech, Cat # SA00013‐1; goat anti‐rat IgG H&L [Alexa Fluor 594], Proteintech, Cat # SA00007‐7). AQP4 expression and polarization were assessed according to previously described methods [ 9 19 2.8 Western blotting Brain tissues were homogenized in RIPA lysis buffer (Cat # WB3100, NCM Biotech, Soochow, China) containing 1% protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. Protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA assay (Beyotime, Cat # P0010) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, proteins (30 μg per lane) were separated via sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, United States). After blocking with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% BSA in Tris‐buffered saline (TBS), the membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with specific primary antibodies. The primary antibodies included rabbit anti‐AQP4 (1:3000, Proteintech, Cat # 16473‐1‐AP), rabbit anti‐β‐DG (1:2000, Proteintech, Cat # 11017‐1‐AP), rabbit anti‐MMP9 (1:3000, Proteintech, Cat # 10375‐2‐AP), and anti‐RhoA (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Cat # 2117 T). After incubating the membrane with anti‐rabbit horseradish peroxidase‐conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10000, Immunoway, Cat # RS0002) for 1 hour at room temperature, the NcmECL SuperUltra Enhanced Chemiluminescent Kit (Cat # P10060 2.9 Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI Brain MRI was conducted according to previously described methods [ 9 2.10 Neurological function and motor function assessment Neurological deficits were assessed using the Longa score by the researchers blinded to group allocation at 24 h after MCAO/R. To evaluate motor function, open field, string suspension grip test, and rotarod tests were conducted on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 following MCAO/R. The string suspension grip test involved elevating a 50 cm string 40 cm above a flat surface between 2 vertical supports. Each mouse was positioned in the middle of the string and scored on a scale of 0–5 (0 = falls off; 1 = hangs on the string with one or both front paws; 2 = attempts to climb onto the string; 3 = hangs on by one or both front and hind paws; 4 = holds on with fore and hind paws plus tail wrapped around the string; 5 = escapes to the supports). The rotarod test was used to assess balance and motor coordination. Before MCAO/R modeling, mice were trained for 1 week. Mice were placed on a rotarod apparatus with a 3 cm diameter rotating rod and a non‐slip surface. The rod measured 30 cm in length and was positioned 20 cm above the ground. Each mouse was tested, beginning at a speed of 4 rotations per minute (rpm), gradually increasing to 40 rpm over 300 s. Time spent on the rod was automatically recorded. Behavioral activity was assessed using the open field test, which allowed uninhibited movement of the mice. The apparatus was a square chamber (50 × 50 × 40 cm) made from white plastic panels and placed in a quiet, well‐lit environment. Mice were placed in the center of the field and allowed to move freely for 10 min. Total distance traveled and number of crossings were recorded as indicators of locomotor and exploratory abilities. Mice underwent pre‐experimental training and were then tested once. After each test, the box was cleaned with 75% ethanol to remove feces and odor. 2.11 Statistical analysis All quantitative results in the manuscript have been expressed as the mean ± SEM (standard error of the mean), and p t 3 RESULTS 3.1  AQP4 GS To evaluate the clearance of macromolecular metabolic waste products, we stereotactically injected the fluorescent tracer OVA‐555 into the brain parenchyma. This revealed a significant accumulation of fluorescence in brain slices 1 day after ischemic stroke (Figure 1A,B 1C,D 1E,F FIGURE 1 Impairment of the GS and AQP4 depolarization following MCAO/R.

On day 1 following ischemic stroke, the expression level of AQP4 protein did not significantly decrease, but its polarization state underwent a marked alteration. The subcellular localization of AQP4 is functionally dependent on the DAPC, with β‐DG constituting a core structural component of this complex.

This study represents the first exploration of pharmacological TRPV4 blockade in modulating GS functionality following cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury. HC was administered via a 30‐gauge syringe pre‐inserted into the lateral ventricle, with treatment starting immediately after MCAO/R and continued at 4‐h intervals thereafter (Figure 3A FIGURE 3 Inhibition of TRPV4 restores GS function.

Quantitative analysis of OVA‐555 fluorescence intensity and residual area across the three groups ( n n n n p Initially, we assessed glymphatic outflow, which aligns more closely with our hypothesis of “enhance water outflow.” 1 day after MCAO/R, we injected OVA‐555 into the brain parenchyma to evaluate glymphatic outflow. Compared with vehicle controls, pharmacological inhibition of TRPV4 significantly reduced residual fluorescence retention in brain parenchyma (Figure 3B 3C To evaluate the impact of TRPV4 inhibition on glymphatic influx, we performed transcranial fluorescence imaging to dynamically track tracer distribution in superficial cortical regions of live mice (Figure 3D,E 3F As transcranial imaging only captures surface fluorescence, we further euthanized the mice and dissected their brains to assess deeper inflow by observing fluorescence signals from the bottom and lateral aspects, as well as from tissue sections (Figure 3G 3H 3.4 Inhibiting TRPV4 AQP4 DG The proper GS function depends on the polarized distribution of AQP4. As we observed that astrocytic AQP4 depolarization following MCAO/R coincided with upregulation of TRPV4 expression in endfeet and this channel has been demonstrated to mediate the regulation of AQP4 redistribution [ 22 4A,B S3 FIGURE 4 Inhibiting TRPV4 alleviates AQP4 depolarization and β‐DG downregulation.

(E) Analysis of infarct volume across the sham, MCAO/R Veh, and MCAO/R HC groups ( n n n n p To objectively quantify the severity of cerebral edema, we employed several additional methods. Midline shift and the volume ratio of the lateral ventricles were assessed to reflect brain tissue swelling on the affected side. 1 day after MCAO/R, the midline shift was notably pronounced, and the lateral ventricle on the affected side was severely compressed, to the point of being undetectable (Figure 5G,H 3.6  TRPV4 MCAO Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality, with malignant brain edema being a major contributor to these outcomes. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce the incidence of motor dysfunction and improve survival rates associated with cerebral edema. Given that TRPV4 inhibition has been shown to restore GS function and alleviate cerebral edema, we sought to investigate whether these improvements also support amelioration in survival and recovery of motor function. To minimize potential subjective biases, we conducted a series of behavioral experiments to test this hypothesis, including the Longa score, open field test, rotarod test, pole test, string suspension test, and forelimb grip strength measurement. Mice were trained for 1 week prior to tests to adapt to the experimental conditions, and baseline values showed no statistically significant differences between groups (Figure S7 After MCAO/R, we evaluated the survival rate of mice for 7 days. Compared to the vehicle control group, the TRPV4‐inhibited mice showed a significant increase in survival rate (Figure 6A 6B 6C 6D 6E 6F 6G S8 FIGURE 6 Improved neurological prognosis following TRPV4 inhibition.

This study demonstrates that following ischemic stroke, activation of TRPV4 channels enhances the expression and activity of MMP9 by regulating downstream RhoA. The MMP9‐involved signal cascade subsequently results in the degradation of the membrane‐anchored protein β‐DG, ultimately causing AQP4 depolarization. Consequently, AQP4 depolarization impairs GS function and exacerbates cerebral edema (Figure 7 FIGURE 7 Potential mechanism by which TRPV4 activation disrupts GS function after ischemic stroke. Following ischemic stroke, TRPV4 activation initiates a pathological cascade: (A) RhoA activation triggers MMP9 upregulation; (B) MMP9‐mediated proteolytic cleavage of β‐DG disrupts its membrane anchoring function; (C) β‐DG loss induces AQP4 depolarization, ultimately impairing GS‐mediated water homeostasis. These findings establish the TRPV4‐RhoA‐MMP9 axis as a key pathogenic driver of cerebral edema via β‐DG/AQP4 axis dysregulation. The physiological function of the GS largely depends on the polarized distribution of AQP4 within astrocytic endfeet [ 32 38 39 38 40 Notably, the polarized distribution of AQP4 is inseparable from the subcellular structure of astrocytic endfeet, which also express TRPV4 channels [ 21 41 42 2+ 43 2+ 22 The polarized distribution of AQP4 relies partly on an intact DAPC, which includes Dp71, α‐syntrophin, α‐dystrobrevin, α‐ and β‐DG [ 16 44 35 45 18 19 28 36 46 29 We also note that Wu et al. [ 47 Despite these encouraging findings, our study has limitations. The TRPV4 channel opening levels post‐stroke deserve further investigation through patch‐clamp techniques and may become important targets for treating cerebral edema. Furthermore, gene‐level knockdown of TRPV4 could validate its key role in edema progression. The interaction between the GS and the blood–brain barrier also requires further exploration, especially regarding barrier permeability in cerebral edema. In this study, we propose shifting the focus from “reducing water influx” to “increasing water efflux” to decrease cerebral edema while leveraging the GS to clear toxic substances from the injury site. However, our study did not include direct observation of the blood–brain barrier, limiting our ability to fully exclude its potential confounding effects throughout the experimental process. Furthermore, our administration approach may limit the clinical translatability of the experimental findings. It should be noted that this study did not investigate the pharmacokinetics of HC‐067047 or measure its effective intracerebral drug concentration. Future studies should prioritize developing TRPV4 inhibitors with enhanced blood–brain barrier permeability and target specificity. In conclusion, this study elucidates a key pathway in which TRPV4 activation after ischemic stroke leads to AQP4 depolarization, thereby disrupting GS function and exacerbating cerebral edema. Targeting TRPV4 to restore AQP4 polarization could be a promising strategy to enhance GS function and mitigate the adverse effects of cerebral edema. These findings warrant further investigation in both experimental and clinical settings.
