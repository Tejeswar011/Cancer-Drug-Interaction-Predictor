By analyzing data from 128 patients treated between 2003 and 2022 at a single institution, researchers found that the presence of cancer in the para-aortic lymph nodes was strongly linked to a higher risk of cancer recurrence and lower survival rates (5-year survival was only 60% as compared to 89% in women without spread). Additionally, obesity (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m 2 Abstract Background: Concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment for patients with locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC), including those with parametrial or lymphatic metastasis. However, therapeutic outcomes vary, and prognostic factors remain inadequately defined. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study involving 128 patients with cervical cancer who received definitive CCRT between 2003 and 2022 at Seoul National University Bundang Hospital. We evaluated clinicopathological variables, including age, height, body weight, histologic type, tumor size, human papillomavirus (HPV) type, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) antigen levels, and involvement of the parametrium, lower vagina, and lymph nodes. Survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Stage IIIC1r, according to the 2018 FIGO staging system, was the most common disease stage among the study population. Para-aortic lymph node metastasis was significantly associated with increased recurrence risk (odds ratio [OR] = 5.892; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.030–17.097; p p p p 2 p p cervical cancer concurrent chemoradiation prognostic factor BMI para-aortic node This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Globally, cervical cancer ranks fourth in terms of female incidence and mortality (7.7% of all cancer-related deaths in women), with ~660,000 new cases reported in 2022 [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9 10 Approximately one-third of patients treated with CCRT experience relapse or disease progression during follow-up and show poor overall prognosis [ 11 12 13 14 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Case Selection We retrospectively reviewed the data for 141 consecutive patients with cervical cancer who underwent definitive CCRT without any primary surgery between 2003 and 2022 at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (Seongnam, Republic of Korea). The updated 2018 FIGO staging system was implemented for cervical cancer staging, the patients before 2018 were also restaged as per the newer classification for the purpose of this study. We included patients (1) with invasive cervical cancer diagnosed by histopathology of punch biopsy specimens, (2) who received definitive CCRT and completed the treatment, and (3) with no previous surgery or any adjuvant treatment for cervical cancer. Of the 141 patients, 13 were not eligible and were excluded from the study. Therefore, 128 patients with stage IB2–IVA diseases were included in the statistical analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (IRB No: B-2406-909-102). Informed consent was not required, given the retrospective nature of the study. 2.2. Clinicopathological Data Collection We collected data on age, height, weight, BMI, histological type, maximal tumor diameter, human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, serum squamous cell carcinoma (SCC Ag) antigen levels, parametrium and lower vagina involvement, and lymph node (LN) metastasis (based on imaging analysis) from the hospital database. Pathological parameters were collected from data after surgery, all other factors have been collected from pre-operative data. LN metastasis was confirmed by a short-axis diameter ≥ 15 mm in T2w magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, or increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in positron emission tomography scans. Recurrence and survival data were also obtained. 2.3. Definitive Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy Procedure The institutional standard for concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) involved external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) delivered concomitantly with weekly cisplatin chemotherapy, followed by definitive brachytherapy. EBRT was administered to the planning target volume (PTV) at a total dose of 45–50.4 Gy in 25–28 fractions (1.8–2.0 Gy per fraction, five fractions per week). In cases with radiological or histopathological suspicion of para-aortic lymph node involvement, extended-field EBRT (EF-EBRT) was employed to encompass the para-aortic nodal regions. Concurrent chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin at a dose of 40 mg/m 2 Brachytherapy was initiated either during the final weeks of EBRT or immediately thereafter, utilizing either a conventional two-dimensional Point A–based technique or a three-dimensional image-guided approach based on CT or MRI. High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy was delivered in 4–5 fractions of 6–7 Gy each, with the goal of achieving a total equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) of 80–90 Gy to the high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV). Additional radiation boosts to involved lymph nodes or parametrial disease, as well as modifications to the chemotherapy or radiotherapy protocol, were made at the discretion of the treating oncologist and in accordance with recommendations from a multidisciplinary tumor board. 2.4. Follow-Up The post-CCRT follow-up data of all patients, including clinical findings, serum tumor markers, and imaging results, were retrospectively reviewed until their last hospital visit/death, up to December 2023. Standard follow-up protocol of the institute included tumor marker testing every 3 months and CT scan every 5–6 months for the first 2 years and then double the interval for the next 3 years, annually thereafter. Individualization for follow-up protocol was performed for patients if needed, as per consultant’s decision. Response to treatment was classified as complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), stationary disease, or progressive disease (PD) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 [ 15 2.5. Statistical Analysis Clinicopathological variables were categorized into binomial groups, and basic statistical tests were used to describe tumor characteristics. Continuous data are described as median values and ranges whereas categorical data are presented as numbers and percentages. Logistic regression analyses (univariate and multivariate) were used to determine the association between independent variables and recurrence, along with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–Meier method, plots were generated including 95% CI shading and number-at-risk tables. The primary endpoints of the analyses were PFS, OS, and TFI. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the influence of independent factors on survival, along with hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. Proportional hazards assumptions were verified using Schoenfeld residuals; minor violations observed for age were addressed by stratification for PFS and TFI in the final Cox regression models. Body mass index (BMI), tumor size and SCC antigen levels were analyzed both as categorical and continuous variables to minimize information loss. As part of sensitivity analyses, an exploratory subgroup comparison was performed for underweight patients versus those with normal BMI. Forest plots were generated to visualize HRs from the multivariate Cox models. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 25.0 (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA) and R version 4.3.0 for advanced survival graphics. Statistical significance was set at p 3. Results A total of 128 patients were enrolled in the study. Clinicopathological characteristics are described in Table 1 2 2 16 Table S1 Table S1 n n n Table S1 Disease recurrence occurred in 35 (27.3%) patients, which was further classified as local, regional, or distant, depending on the site of recurrence [ 17 Table 2 The univariate logistic regression analysis showed that BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 p p Table 3 p p p Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate factors independently associated with higher recurrence rates ( Table 3 p p The PALN metastasis remained the strongest adverse factor across endpoints, with multivariable, age-stratified Cox models showing PALN positivity associated with markedly worse PFS (HR 3.59, 95% CI 1.63–7.93, p p 2 p 2 p p 2 p p Table 4 Figure 1 Figure 2 Table S1 4. Discussion Predictive models of cancer outcomes have gained widespread interest in recent years for their predictive power of patient responses to certain treatments [ 18 12 13 14 Most patients in the current study presented with stage IIIC1r disease (46.9%), followed by stage IIB (25.8%). Of the 128 patients, 122 (95.3%) had parametrial invasion, whereas only two (1.56%) had lower vaginal involvement and none presented with stage IIIA disease. FIGO 2018 has better survival discriminatory capacity than FIGO 2009, and stage III is more commonly encountered at disease presentation [ 14 19 19 9 14 Para-aortic lymph node metastasis was consistently associated with inferior survival outcomes, with significantly worse PFS (HR 3.60, 95% CI 1.62–8.01, p p p Table 4 20 21 22 23 24 25 23 NCT05421650 26 27 28 A recent study on the effects of sarcopenic obesity on cervical cancer indicated a strong association between BMI, PFS, and OS, with normal-weight patients showing the highest survival rates [ 18 29 30 2 p p p p n p p Table S2 18 18 29 31 We also studied the associations between age, tumor size, or SCC antigen levels and recurrence or survival outcomes, but found no independent predictors in our cohort. However, there has been much controversy regarding these correlations [ 12 13 32 p 12 p 33 2 9 34 14 13 p p Table S2 We acknowledge the limitations of this study, including its single-center retrospective design, convenience sampling, and relatively small sample size. Another limitation is the lack of information on host immune status, such as baseline lymphocyte count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, or other immune-related markers, which are increasingly recognized as important prognostic factors in cervical cancer. Future prospective studies should integrate immune-related parameters alongside clinical and body composition variables to provide a more comprehensive assessment of outcomes following CCRT. In addition, further evidence is required to establish the most effective therapeutic strategies for patients with bulky lymph nodes in LACC. 5. Conclusions Our study represents a valuable contribution to ongoing efforts aimed at understanding the treatment outcomes and prognostic factors in patients with cervical cancer treated with CCRT. This information can inform the development of personalized CCRT-based treatments for selected patients with poor prognostic factors to improve OS outcomes. Our findings highlight an important research question: Should patients with higher BMI and radiologically enlarged PALNs receive adjunctive treatment in addition to CCRT? Further prospective research is needed to validate these prognostic factors, develop effective therapeutic strategies, and adaptively adjust treatment protocols in patients with LACC.
