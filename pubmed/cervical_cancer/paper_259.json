SUMMARY The aim of the study was to determine the effects of smoking on cervical mucus in women with primary idiopathic sterility. A prospective, case-control, observational, quantitative, and analytical study was carried out over a five-year period through ambulatory care. The first part of the study involved 140 healthy women (85 smokers and 55 non-smokers). The second part included 90 women (58 healthy, 32 suffering from sterility), grouped according to their smoking status. Concentrations of total proteins in cervical mucus solutions and homogenates of cervical surface cells and their mitochondria, thiocyanate and ascorbic acid, rhodanese activity, concentrations of cytochrome P-450 (mitochondria), lipid peroxidation and the total antioxidant capacity in homogenates of cervical surface cells, concentrations of superoxide O2, reduced gluthatione (GSH), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) were measured. The measurements showed higher concentrations of thiocyanate, cytochrome P-450 and lipid peroxidation values, and lower concentrations of ascorbic acid, cytochrome P-450 activity and FRAP in smokers. Higher concentrations of superoxide O2, GSH, AOPP, and lower FRAP were found among smokers and women suffering from sterility. In conclusion, changes in oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity caused by smoking indicate that the quality of cervical mucus among patients suffering from sterility is lower compared to healthy women.

Smoking also decreases the level of antioxidants in the body ( 3 1 2 Reduced L-gluthatione (GSH) is the primary cellular and tissue antioxidant, directly involved in neutralizing free radicals and maintaining external antioxidants in their reduced (active) form. Its prime role is the protection of cellular components from damage caused by hydroxy peroxides during normal metabolism ( 4 Ascorbic acid is a potent natural antioxidant, which rapidly decomposes free radicals from cigarette tobacco smoke ( 5 6 The mainstream smoke from one packet of cigarettes contains approximately 4.2 g of cyanide (CN-). However, this cyanide poses no threat to smoker’s life because the enzyme rhodanese rapidly converts it into the less harmful compound thiocyanate (SCN) through sulfuration ( 7 Thiocyanate (also known as rhodanide) is the product of the enzyme rhodanese, which also has antioxidant properties. It is the preferred substrate for lactoperoxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of hydrogen peroxide and hypothiocyanite ( 8 Tobacco smoke decreases the activity of the cellular cytochrome P-450, consequently slowing down cellular detoxification processes ( 9 10 The ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay measures the reductive capacity of antioxidant substances through a colorimetric reaction. Results strongly depend on the type of radicals used ( 11 Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) are indicators of oxidative stress. Their levels increase in the presence of a large number of free radicals. They behave as real mediators of inflammation and have the capacity to synthesize inflammatory cytokines in neutrophils and monocytes ( 12 The aim of this study was to determine the concentrations of smoking-specific markers in cervical mucus and to compare the findings between participants with and those without primary idiopathic sterility. Participants and methods Participants This was a prospective, case-control, applicative, observational, quantitative, and analytical study that was conducted at University Hospital “Merkur”, Zagreb, Croatia, from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2018. The study was divided into two parts. The first part involved 140 women (85 smokers and 55 non-smokers) who presented for a routine gynecological examination, had normal gynecological findings, no chronic diseases, were not on medication and did not suffer from sterility (at least one pregnancy). A cervical mucus sample was taken from all consecutive participants visiting the outpatient clinic and meeting the inclusion criteria. Smokers were divided into two subgroups: participants who consumed <10 cigarettes per day (n=45) and those who consumed ≥10 cigarettes per day (n=40). The first part of the study involved determining total proteins in the cervical mucus solution, the homogenate of cervical surface cells and their mitochondria. In the cervical mucus, the concentrations of thiocyanate and ascorbic acid were measured, while rhodanese activity, cytochrome P-450 concentration (also in mitochondria), lipid peroxidation value, and total antioxidant capacity were measured in the homogenate of cervical surface cells. In the second part of the study, which included comparisons in relation to sterility and involved 90 participants, of whom 58 had normal fertility (at least one pregnancy) and 32 had primary idiopathic sterility, the concentrations of superoxide O 2 After obtaining ethical approval (UH “Merkur” Ethics Committee) all participants signed informed consent. Methods All biochemical tests were performed at the Institute of Biology, School of Medicine, University of Zagreb. Cervical smear samples were taken with a spatula from all participants and placed in corresponding plastic test tubes. This procedure was performed only in women who, upon vaginal examination, were found to be in the pre-ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, which is the most favorable time for collecting biological material ( 13 The samples, obtained from all parts of the cervical canal of participants, were dissolved in a 0.1 M phosphate buffer with a pH of 7.5 and prepared according to the method proposed by Sasson et al ( 13 14 Biochemical tests were performed on the supernatant of cervical mucus and, in part, on the cellular organelles obtained from cervical smear samples. All tests on frozen samples were carried out within one month of sample collection. The concentration of proteins was determined ( 15 16 17 18 7 9 19 20 21 11 22 23 14 Statistical analysis The number of participants needed was calculated based on the results of the first 17 participants (power of 80%, α=0.05; β=0.20). Categorical data are presented as absolute and relative frequencies, numerical data as mean values with standard deviations in case of normal distribution, and as median and interquartile range in other cases; normality of distribution was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Differences in normally distributed numerical variables between two independent groups were tested using Student’s t-test (alternatively, the Mann-Whitney U test) and among more than two independent groups using analysis of variance (alternatively, Kruskal-Wallis test). Differences in categorical variables were tested using chi-squared (χ 2 This study is presented in accordance with guidelines for observational studies (STROBE) ( 24 Results Of 140 women included in the first part of the study, aged between 19 and 46 (median, 30), 85 were smokers (45 women smoked <10 cigarettes per day and 40 women smoked ≥10 cigarettes per day) and 55 non-smokers, with no age difference among them (Z=1.011; P=0.314). Total proteins in the cervical mucus solution, the homogenate of cervical surface cells, and their mitochondria showed minor differences that were not statistically significant ( Table 1 Table 1 Total proteins in the cervical mucus solution, the homogenate of cervical surface cells, and their mitochondria  Cervical mucus (mg/mL)  Homogenate (mg/mL)  Mitochondria (mg/mL) Non-smokers (n=55) 6.94±1.59 5.43±1.05 3.62±0.87 Smokers <10 cig/day (n=45) 7.16±1.68 5.64±1.01 3.77±0.84 ≥10 cig/day (n=40) 7.28±1.82 5.59±1.17 3.49±0.86 ANOVA.

The level of thiocyanate in participants who smoked ≥10 cigarettes per day was as much as 17.3 times higher than that in non-smokers and 7.5 times higher than that in participants who smoked <10 cigarettes per day ( Table 2 Table 2 Values of thiocyanate, ascorbic acid, rhodanese, cytochrome P-450, lipid peroxidation, and total antioxidant capacity of the cervical mucus of fertile participants in relation to smoking  Non-smokers  Smokers  Statistics <10 cig/day ≥10 cig/day ANOVA post hoc Thiocyanate (nm/mL) 1 7.26±1.36 16.87±3.25 25.70±2.33 F=34.905; P<0.001 P<0.001 for all Ascorbic acid (µ/mL) 1 42.08±3.81 16.73±2.28 10.16±1.22 F=27.421; P<0.001 P<0.001 for all Rhodanese (µM/min/mg of protein) 1 11.63±2.23 12.21±2.56 12.04±3.43 F=0.673; P=0.513 Cytochrome P-450 (nm/mg of protein) 1 0.09±0.04 0.24±0.12 1.04±0.22 F=21.123; P<0.001 P<0.001 for all Cytochrome P-450 activity (nm/mg of protein) 2 14.34±4.45 1.37±6.97 0.14±0.07 F=20.150; P<0.001 P<0.001 for all Lipid peroxidation (nm of malondialdehyde/mg of protein) 1 1.12±0.01 1.26±0.03 1.15±0.03 F=2.398; P=0.109 Lipid peroxidation (nm of malondialdehyde/mg of protein) 3 36.23±1.48 42.56±1.62 55.82±2.21 F=29.547; P<0.001 P<0.001 for all Total antioxidant capacity (FRAP) (µM/L) 3 7,080±532 5,997±628 4,761±491 F=29.547; P<0.001 P<0.001 for all 1 2 3 Cytochrome showed a significantly lower activity in participants who smoked. The cytochrome results differed by approximately hundredfold between participants who did not smoke and those who smoked ≥10 cigarettes per day. The activity of cytochrome oxidase in the mitochondria of the samples taken from participants who smoked <10 cigarettes per day was by 29% lower compared to that of non-smokers. There were no significant differences in lipid peroxidation among the observed groups, while all samples were mutually different at the level of 10%. Assuming that all lipid peroxide diffused into cervical mucus from the bloodstream or from decomposed epithelial cells of the cervical surface, we measured lipid peroxidation in the homogenate of cervical surface cells. Significant differences were observed, and the highest value was measured in participants who smoked ≥10 cigarettes per day. The highest FRAP value was found in the cervical mucus of participants who did not smoke, while the lowest value was recorded in participants who smoked ≥10 cigarettes per day ( Table 2 A positive correlation was found between thiocyanate and cytochrome P-450 (r s s s The second part of the study involved 90 participants whose median age was 29 years (range from 18 to 35). Of these 90 participants, 58 had normal gynecological findings and 32 had primary idiopathic sterility. Twenty-nine participants were smokers, with 19 of them smoking <10 cigarettes per day and 10 smoking ≥10 cigarettes per day. Among 32 participants with diagnosed sterility, 13 were smokers, while among those without sterility there were 16 smokers, which did not represent a statistically significant difference (χ 2 2 2 For all tested variables (superoxide O 2 Table 3 2 Table 4 2 2 Table 3 Concentrations of superoxide O 2  Sterility  Smoking  Superoxide O 2  GSH (µM/mL)  AOPP (µM/L)  FRAP (µMFESO 4 No No 2.44 (1.85-4.22) 14.21 (13.02-15.85) 3.57 (1.98-4.08) 396.05 (389.00-416.80) <10 cig/day 6.48 (5.68-7.75) 26.35 (24.38-28.64) 9.20 (8.50-11.20) 284.20 (274.60-294.10) ≥10 cig/day 8.08 (7.39-8.72) 33.38 (31.98-35.90) 11.88 (10.01-13.08) 247.60 (235.40-264.10) Yes No 4.26 (3.98-5.47) 24.85 (22.38-30.12) 18.00 (15.20-22.30) 282.10 (265.80-295.90) <10 cig/day 10.12 (9.43-11.25) 54.41 (44.00-57.44) 29.53 (22.94-35.14) 200.50 (177.80-212.00) ≥10 cig/day 13.22 (12.57-14.21) 82.73 (77.12-86.92) 37.75 (34.60-38.72) 162.40 (127.30-176.90) Statistical values 1 χ 2 χ 2 χ 2 χ 2 1 post hoc Table 4 Coefficients of correlation between the concentrations of superoxide O 2  Sterility  Smoking  Difference Z P Superoxide O 2 r s 0.465 0.693 -2.309 0.021 P <0.001 <0.001 N 90 90 GSH (µM/mL) r s 0.651 0.679 -0.331 0.741 P <0.001 <0.001 N 90 90 AOPP (µM/L) r s -0.815 -0.521 3.720 <0.001 P <0.001 <0.001 N 90 90 FRAP (µMFESO 4 r s -0.739 -0.498 2.649 0.008 P <0.001 <0.001 N 90 90 r s For sterility, ROC analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic potential of variable concentrations ( Table 5 Table 6 Table 5 Results of the ROC-analysis of the concentrations of superoxide O 2 AUC Sensitivity Specificity +LR -LR Z P Superoxide O2 (µM/min/mL) >3.41 0.780 93.75% 55.17% 2.09 0.11 5.805 <0.001 GSH (µM/mL) >17.25 0.893 100% 72.41% 3.62 0.00 12.315 <0.001 AOPP (µM/L) <13.41 0.991 93.75% 100% 0.063 65.583 <0.001 FRAP 0.946 93.75% 89.66% 9.06 0.07 18.926 <0.001 Classification variable ‒ sterility; AUC ‒ area under the curve; +LR ‒ positive predictive value; -LR ‒ negative predictive value; Z ‒ test value; P ‒ statistical probability.

Discussion Our results demonstrate that cigarette smoking does not significantly alter the synthesis of total proteins in the body, but there are no similar data published to make the comparison. However, this does not mean that the activity of enzymes did not change. By acting at the level of genes, free radicals accelerate the process of transformation of normal cells into cancerous ones ( 25 26 27 5 Westley ( 28 29 30 Participants who smoked >10 cigarettes per day had as much as a 12 times higher level of thiocyanate in the secretion of cervical cells compared to non-smokers. Participants who smoked <10 cigarettes per day also showed a higher concentration, which correlates with previously published results by other researchers ( 16 29 30 Some of the thiocyanate measured in cervical cell secretion may have been produced elsewhere in the body and transported to the cervical area via the bloodstream. As the activity of rhodanese was measured in the cells of various human organs ( 31 28 10 28 29 Cyanide inhibits the activity of cytochrome oxidase ( 32 To our knowledge, this is the first study that determined cytochrome oxidase activity in the mitochondrial fraction of cervical cells, indirectly confirming the assertion that ATP synthesis is decreased in smokers’ cells ( 33 The cellular homogenate of both groups of smokers contained a greater amount lipid peroxidation products than the homogenate of cervical cells of non-smokers, which confirms that cigarette smoking increases the degree of lipid peroxidation ( 5 10 34 Decreased antioxidant capacity of plasma and increased lipid peroxidation are the most certain indicators of oxidative stress ( 23 25 Our results showed that smoking decreases the level of vitamin C in the cervical smears of smokers. These results correlate with Murata’s observations ( 35 Similar relationship exist between vitamin C and cytochrome P-450. These parameters are inversely proportional, but the decrease in the concentration of vitamin C in smokers was greater than the increase in the concentration of cytochrome P-450 in the same participants. We tried to meaningfully explain the results and conclude about their significance through comparisons with other research concerning pathophysiological processes related to smoking. An advantage of our study was the simplicity of sample collection to determine cervical mucus quality and clarify the role of smoking as a risk factor for primary idiopathic sterility. The shortcoming was the fact that patients classified as non-smokers could have been, and probably had been, passively exposed to tobacco smoke. The only certain way to determine the smoking status of participants is to measure the concentrations of cotinine and nicotine in urine and plasma, which was not performed in the our study. One potential limitation is the smoking status of the women, as smokers often tend to underreport the number of cigarettes they smoke. Conclusion The incidence of primary idiopathic sterility was associated with the concentrations of substances that indicate the level of oxidative stress. Also, the body’s capacities to fight oxidative stress were lower. Additional clinical studies on larger samples are needed to shed further light on the association between nicotine and the level of nicotine-induced oxidative stress in patients’ cervical mucus and the consequent sterility.
