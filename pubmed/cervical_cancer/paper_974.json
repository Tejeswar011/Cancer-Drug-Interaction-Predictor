This study aims to detail the prevalence and characteristics of HPV infections both before and after surgical treatment in patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical cancer. Methods We recruited 370 patients diagnosed with CIN or cervical cancer. The study first assessed the overall prevalence of preoperative HPV infections, analyzing variations across different age groups and histological diagnoses. We then investigated the relationships between postoperative HPV positivity rates and various factors including age, histological diagnoses, HPV genotypes, and the presence of multiple HPV infections. A comparative analysis was also conducted to observe the dynamics of HPV infections before and after cervical operations. Results An overall HPV positivity rate of 97.0% was observed in patients diagnosed with CIN or cervical cancer, with HPV16, HPV52, HPV58, HPV33, HPV51, and HPV18 being the most prevalent genotypes. The distribution of HPV infection varied significantly by age and histological diagnosis. Notably, the prevalence of HPV16 showed significant differences across age and histological diagnoses groups. Among the 282 patients who underwent surgical treatment, 40.1% remained HPV positive postoperatively, with those aged ≥ 60 years and those with multiple HPV infections showing higher rates of postoperative HPV positivity. Conclusions The findings confirm the strong association between high-risk HPV infection and the development of CIN and cervical cancer. They also highlight the need for tailored approaches in the postoperative management of HPV to prevent recurrence, offering new insights for improving screening and treatment strategies.

It has been estimated that more than 80% of women and men will acquire HPV by the age of 45. Specifically, the lifetime risk of HPV infection ranges from 53.6 to 95.0% for women and from 69.5 to 97.7% for men, depending on the number of opposite-sex partners [ 1 2 3 Persistent infection with high-risk HPV is the primary risk factor for high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and is a major determinant in the progression to cervical cancer [ 4 6 7 8 9 6 HPV16 and HPV18 are reported to be responsible for 70% of cervical cancer [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 A proportion of CIN patients remain HPV positive for a subsequent period after treatment. Rositch et al. reported that the incidence of HPV after treatment ranged from 0 to 47% over up to 3 years of follow-up after treatment [ 16 17 18 In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of HPV infection in patients with CIN and cervical cancer, comparing HPV infection across different age groups and histological diagnoses. Additionally, we explored postoperative HPV infection dynamics in patients treated for CIN lesions and assessed changes in HPV infection before and after treatment. This research aims to enhance HPV screening, clinical management, and postoperative care. Materials and methods Study participants For this cross-sectional and retrospective study, a total of 370 patients diagnosed with CIN or cervical cancer were enrolled from the affiliated Changzhou Second People’s Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between January 2022 and August 2023. The age of the patients ranged from 18-73years, with an average age of 45.1 ± 12.0 years. All patients underwent HPV testing with extended HPV genotyping, followed by colposcopy and biopsy. Additionally, most patients underwent the Thinprep Cytologic Test and received their cytology results. Among the 370 patients, 282 underwent cold knife conization or loop electrical excision procedure, while the remaining 88 did not receive surgical treatment due to medical orders or personal wishes. Among the patients included in this study, no other genital/anal lesions were found in any of them. None of the patients have a history of smoking. HPV genotyping The cervical exfoliated cells collected by the cervical swabs are used as the specimens for HPV genotyping. Human Papillomavirus Genotyping Kit for 23 Types (PCR-Reverse Dot Blot) from YANENG Bioscience was used for HPV genotyping. The instrument Automatic Hybridization System YN-HR9600 was provided by YANENG Bioscience (Shenzhen, China). This method can detect 23 HPV genotypes, including 17 high-risk types: HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 82 and 6 low-risk types: HPV6, 11, 42, 43, 81, 83. HPV DNA extraction, PCR amplification, hybridization and interpretation of the results were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The patients underwent HPV testing in the same laboratory before and after the surgery. If the HPV genotyping results differed, the HPV genotypes that consistently tested positive were considered as the preoperative or postoperative genotypes. All patients underwent postoperative HPV testing within 24 months, but the time varied according to medical orders. Histological diagnoses All patients underwent colposcopy, during which gynecologists obtained cervical tissue for biopsy. The histology results were graded by two professional pathologists according to the histological diagnostic criteria established by WHO, including cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3) and cervical cancer. P16 immunohistochemistry was used on some samples to aid in diagnosing high-grade CIN. Statistical analysis All statistical analysis were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 23.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Counting data were expressed as number of cases and/or percentage (%). Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test were employed to evaluate the significance of the difference in composition ratio among different groups. A logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the effects of multiple factors including age, histological diagnoses, HPV16/18/33/51/52/58 and HPV infection types on the postoperative HPV positivity. For all comparisons, P Results The overall prevalence of HPV infection in patients with CIN and cervical cancer Among the cohort of 370 patients, 359 cases tested positive for HPV, yielding a positive rate of 97.0%. All 23 HPV genotypes were identified, with 237 cases (66.0%) exhibiting single HPV infection and 122 cases (34.0%) showing multiple HPV infections. A total of 356 cases (99.2%) were found to be infected with high-risk HPV, including both high-risk HPV infection alone and mixed high-risk and low-risk HPV infection, while only 3 cases (0.8%) were infected with low-risk HPV alone. In terms of the distribution of HPV genotypes, the prevalence of high-risk HPV16 among HPV-positive patients was 44.3%, significantly surpassing other genotypes. The subsequent five most prevalent genotypes were high-risk HPV52 (20.9%), high-risk HPV58 (13.7%), high-risk HPV33 (10.9%), high-risk HPV51 (8.1%), and high-risk HPV18 (7.2%). The prevalence of each specific HPV genotype are presented in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Prevalence of HPV genotypes in patients with CIN and cervical cancer HPV infection in patients of different age groups The distribution of patients across five age groups—under 30 years, 30 to 40 years, 40 to 50 years, 50 to 60 years, and 60 years or older—was analyzed. The patients were predominantly concentrated within the age groups of 30–40, 40–50, and 50–60 years old, with a lower number of patients in the < 30 years old and ≥ 60 years old categories. We then analyzed the distribution of patients with various histological diagnoses across age groups. As shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 2 The age-specific distribution of various cervical lesions Subsequently, we conducted an analysis on the distribution of the six most prevalent high-risk HPV genotypes in the three age groups of < 40 years old, 40–50 years old, and ≥ 50 years old (Table 1 P P P 1  Table 1 Distribution of 6 predominant HPV genotypes and multiple HPV infections in patients of different age groups Age(years) Cases HPV16 HPV18 HPV33 HPV51 HPV52 HPV58 Multiple HPV < 40 143 75 (52.4%) 12 (8.4%) 13 (9.1%) 9 (6.3%) 28 (19.6%) 22 (15.4%) 46 (32.2%) 40–50 103 40 (38.8%) 8 (7.8%) 9 (8.7%) 12 (11.7%) 20 (19.4%) 11 (10.7%) 35 (34.0%) ≥ 50 124 44 (35.5%) 6 (4.8%) 17 (13.7%) 8 (6.5%) 27 (21.8%) 16 (12.9%) 41 (33.1%)  P 0.012 0.496 0.369 0.238 0.877 0.556 0.956 HPV infection in patients with different histological diagnoses There were 84 patients diagnosed with CIN 1, 103 with CIN 2, 136 with CIN 3, and 36 with cervical cancer.

All 282 patients were confirmed to be HPV positive prior to the operation. In comparison to their preoperative HPV infection status, 169 (59.9%) were found to be HPV negative during postoperative follow-up. A total of 113 patients continued to test positive for HPV during the postoperative follow-up, resulting in a positivity rate of 40.1%. And the postoperative positive rate for the 14 high-risk HPV genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) recommended for follow-up was found to be 31.6%. Among the 113 postoperative positive patients, 45 cases (39.8%) exhibited a decrease in HPV genotypes postoperatively, while 35 cases (31.0%) showed no change in their genotype status. Furthermore, new HPV genotypes emerged in 50 cases (44.2%). Patients of varying ages, histological diagnoses, preoperative HPV genotypes, and infection types exhibited differing rates of postoperative HPV positivity (Table 3 P P  Table 3 The impact of various factors on postoperative HPV positivity assessed through logistic regression analysis Factors Cases Positive cases Positive rate  P Age (years) < 30 23 10 43.5% 0.007 30–40 84 24 28.6% 40–50 87 34 39.1% 50–60 64 29 45.3% ≥ 60 24 16 66.7% Histological diagnoses CIN 1 50 26 52.0% 0.456 CIN 2 101 45 44.6% CIN 3 131 42 32.1% Preoperative HPV genotypes HPV16 121 42 34.7% 0.174 HPV18 14 7 50.0% 0.659 HPV33 33 13 39.4% 0.380 HPV51 24 17 70.8% 0.387 HPV52 69 32 46.4% 0.798 HPV58 42 19 45.2% 0.644 Infection types Multiple HPV infections 104 64 61.5% < 0.001 Single HPV infection 178 49 27.5% The differences in HPV infection before and after cervical operation were compared among 113 patients who tested positive for HPV following the procedure (Table 4 P P  Table 4 Distribution of 6 predominant HPV genotypes and multiple HPV infections in preoperative and postoperative patients Operation status Cases HPV16 HPV18 HPV33 HPV51 HPV52 HPV58 Multiple HPV infections Preoperation 113 42 (37.2%) 7 (6.2%) 13 (11.5%) 17 (15.0%) 32 (28.3%) 19 (16.8%) 64 (56.6%) Postoperation 113 20 (17.7%) 4 (3.5%) 6 (5.3%) 17 (15.0%) 20 (17.7%) 10 (8.9%) 36 (31.9%)  P 0.002 0.539 0.149 > 0.999 0.082 0.110 < 0.001 Discussion The most prevalent genotypes observed among patients with CIN and cervical cancer in this study were HPV16, 52, 58, 33, 51 and 18. Furthermore, a higher prevalence of HPV16 and HPV33 was observed in high-grade CIN (CIN 2–3) patients compared to those with CIN 1. In addition, cervical cancer patients exhibited a higher prevalence of HPV16 and HPV18 but a lower prevalence of HPV33, 51, 52, and 58 compared to CIN patients. Previous studies by Luo et al. identified HPV16, 52, 58, and 33 as the most common genotypes in high-grade CIN [ 19 20 21 22 Multiple HPV infections are commonly believed to prolong the duration of HPV infection and increase the risk of cervical cancer, as supported by several studies [ 13 23 24 25 26 Previously, Yang et al. reported age-specific numbers and rates of incident cases of cervical cancer, noting that the incidence rate increases with advancing age until the ages of 55–59 years, after which it stabilizes [ 27 28 29 Significant disparities were observed in the prevalence of HPV16 across different age cohorts, while no variations were noted for other HPV genotypes. These findings may reflect differences in susceptibility to HPV16 among various age groups. Previous studies have shown that multiple HPV infections exhibit a U-shaped distribution with respect to age [ 19 Excisional treatment has been recommended by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP) to eradicate high-grade CIN and associated HPV infection in women [ 30 31 32 34 32 35 36 HPV infection following cervical surgery, particularly persistent infection, is an independent risk factor for assessing residual lesions or recurrence [ 37 38 39 40 In this study, we found that both age and the infection types significantly influence postoperative HPV positivity. Notably, patients ≥ 60 years, as well as those with multiple HPV infections, demonstrated a higher rate of postoperative HPV positivity. This observation may be attributed to the fact that individuals ≥ 60 years often experience a decline in local immunity, while those with multiple HPV infections encounter greater challenges in completely eradicating the viruses. However, previous studies have indicated that persistent high-risk HPV infection following cervical surgery is not associated with age or the presence of multiple HPV infections [ 32 33 This study is a single-center investigation, which may face challenges such as a homogeneous population and geographical limitations. The relatively small sample size could also affect the statistical power of the findings. This research evaluated 23 HPV genotypes in postoperative patients to assess their infection status after cervical surgery. However, this approach is not currently recommended, as it may lead to an inflated positive rate that does not correlate with clinically significant persistent or recurrent diseases. In future studies, we will enhance the research design by conducting multi-center investigations and including a larger sample size. Additionally, we will select a more appropriate panel of HPV genotypes for postoperative follow-up of CIN patients. Conclusion This retrospective study has documented the prevalence characteristics of HPV in patients with CIN and cervical cancer, reinforcing the association between high-risk HPV infection and the development of CIN and cervical cancer. Additionally, our findings show that although treatments such as cold-knife conization or loop electrical excision procedures can effectively address CIN lesions and clear HPV infection, some patients remain HPV-positive post-operation. The postoperative HPV positivity rate varies based on factors such as age and type of infection. These insights provide a foundation for enhancing the prevention and management of HPV infection after treatment.
