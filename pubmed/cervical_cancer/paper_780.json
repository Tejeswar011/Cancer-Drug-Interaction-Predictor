Refugees face numerous post-migration challenges such as problems of adaptation to their new country, language barriers, acculturation stress, and ethnicity concerns. These issues, along with other challenges, make it difficult for refugees to build social connections in their new host country. Social connectedness and social cognition among refugees are areas that have not been thoroughly studied. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate social cognition and social connectedness in adult refugees who had to migrate due to the civil war that started in Syria in 2011 and settle in Türkiye. Method A total of 499 individuals, including 249 Syrian refugees and 250 Turks as the control group, were included in the study. Participants completed a variety of assessments, including a sociodemographic data form, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Social Connectedness Scale (SCS), and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Results The comparison analyses revealed that Turkish participants had higher scores in both social cognition and social connectedness compared with Syrian refugees. The refugees had statistically significantly higher alexithymia and childhood trauma scores than Turkish participants. The MANCOVA analysis indicated that childhood trauma was significantly associated with both social cognition and social connectedness. In addition, depression and alexithymia were significantly associated with social connectedness. The interaction effect of factors on social cognition such as exposure to war, receiving financial support from the state, and financial loss was found to be significant. Other dyadic and triadic interactions had no significant effects on social connectedness. Conclusion Refugees' social cognition performance and social connectedness levels were found to be lower than in Turkish participants. Refugees' poor social cognition and connectedness may be related to childhood traumas. It may not be a consequence of being a refugee. In this period when refugees face significant challenges, our study offers promising findings that could enhance their integration.

Social cognition is defined as the capacity to perceive, interpret, and respond to the intentions and behaviors of other people [ 16 17 9 Social connectedness is defined as the subjective awareness of being closely related to the social world and is typically considered as the experience of belonging to other people and society [ 18 18 19 20 It is argued that individuals with high levels of social connectedness are more likely to enter social environments, do not feel threatened when interacting with their social environment, and tend to evaluate their environment more positively [ 18 21 22 23 Theory of mind (ToM) is a crucial concept that complements our understanding of social cognition and connectedness. ToM is the ability to make correct inferences from one's own and others' mental states such as thoughts, desires, and intentions [ 24 25 26 27 In the case of Syrian refugees in Türkiye, there are several factors that influence social cognition and connectivity, including the challenges of migration and the impact of trauma. In this case, trauma refers to severe or intensely upsetting events that exceed the individual's ability to cope and lead to long-lasting negative effects [ 28 29 30 The focus of this paper revolves around two critical themes: social cognition and social connectedness. These aspects are profoundly affected by trauma, which is an integral part of the refugee experience, and the challenges of migration. Accordingly, the primary aim of this study is to investigate the social cognition and social connectedness levels of adult refugees who were exposed to the civil war in Syria and had to migrate and compare them with Turkish participants. The secondary aim was to examine the relationship between social cognition and social connectedness with trauma, depression, and alexithymia. We hypothesized that refugees who had experienced trauma due to war and migrated might have poorer social cognition performance and engagement compared with individuals without these experiences. Our goal was to create comprehensive support systems that could more effectively address the needs of Syrian refugees, ultimately aiding in their social integration and enhancing their quality of life. Method Participants The sample of the study consisted of Syrian and Turkish adults, aged 18–45 years. The Syrian participants were chosen from among individuals who had been living in Türkiye for at least 10 years and who did not Live in refugee camps. The boundaries of the group were determined for the reasons we will discuss below. With the enactment of the Law on Foreigners and International Protection in 2014, which was modelled after the European Union Asylum System, Türkiye introduced legal regulations concerning the integration of foreigners into the country for the first time. In accordance with this law, local integration is supported and considered as a permanent solution for foreigners to adapt to the country [ 31 The required minimum sample size was calculated using the G*Power program [ 32 2 n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n 1 Table 1 Demographic characteristics of the sample ( N Variable Turks n Percentage Syrians n Percentage Total n Percentage Gender Female 198 79.2 172 69.1 370 74.1 Male 52 20.8 77 30.9 129 25.9 Age 18–25 147 58.8 131 52.6 278 55.7 25–32 46 18.4 53 21.3 99 19.8 32–40 31 12.4 39 15.7 70 14.0 40 and above 26 10.4 26 10.4 52 10.4 Marital Status Single 175 70.0 126 50.6 301 60.3 Married 70 28.0 112 45.0 182 36.5 Divorced 5 2.0 10 4.0 15 3.0 Widowed - - 1 0.4 1 0.2 Education Primary 7 2.8 14 5.6 21 4.2 High school 28 11.2 59 23.7 87 17.4 Undegraduate 172 68.8 149 59.8 321 64.3 Graduate 43 17.2 27 10.8 70 14.0 Financial support a No 250 100.0 208 83.5 458 91.8 Yes - - 40 16.1 40 8.0 Exposure to War No 250 100.0 92 36.9 342 68.5 Yes - - 157 63.1 157 31.5 Loss of a Close One in War No 250 100.0 123 45.8 373 74.7 Yes - - 126 50.6 126 25.3 Financial Loss No 250 250 18 6.8 268 53.7 Yes - - 231 92.8 231 46.3 Loss of Limb Due to War No 250 100.0 213 85.9 473 94.8 Yes - - 26 10.4 26 5.2 Mental Illness Due to War No 250 100.0 161 65.1 421 84.4 Yes - - 78 31.3 78 15.6 Psychological/Psychiatric Treatment After War No 250 100.0 221 83.5 471 94.4 Yes - - 28 11.2 28 5.6 a Procedures The data of this cross-sectional study conducted with adult Syrian refugees and Turkish participants Living in Istanbul were collected between September 2023 and June 2024. The study was obtained through chain referral, where data were collected from a non-random, easy-to-contact or easy-to-reach group. This is a recommended method for sampling hard-to-reach populations. The initial participants were Syrian university students with refugee status, enrolled in the institutions where the study's authors were employed. This network was expanded by inviting other Syrian individuals known to the first participants (dormitory, school, family) to the study. Two Syrian assistants, who were psychology students and fluent in Turkish and Arabic, accompanied the data collection process from the Syrian participants. The assistants also visited schools and dormitories to reach more participants. Before completing the forms, participants received training on the study's purpose, the characteristics of the tests and scales, how to complete them, and the ethical considerations involved. The inclusion criteria were being aged between 18 and 45 years, having at least primary school education, and consenting to participate in the study. For participants from Syria, additional requirements included being able to read Turkish, having come to Türkiye due to the war, and holding refugee status. The exclusion criteria were illiteracy, not having a war-related channel of arrival to Türkiye, being diagnosed as having any psychiatric and/or neurologic disease or taking psychiatric medication. Informative consent forms were presented to the participants and signed before starting the application. These forms included information about the study, the confidentiality of the study data, voluntariness for participation, and a statement saying that they could leave the study at any time without giving any reason. The tests and scales took approximately 40 min to complete. The participants completed a sociodemographic data form, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Social Connectedness Scale (SCS), and Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Approval for the research was granted by the Scientific Research Ethics Committee of the University of Health Science (reference number 536/2023). Assessments tools Sociodemographic data form The form was created by the researchers, considering the literature on refugee studies. It included questions about the participants' age, sex, education level, cohabitants, whether they received regular help, history of psychiatric and medical illness, medication use. and potential traumatic events. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) The BDI was developed by Aaron T. Beck in 1961 to determine the presence and severity of depressive symptoms in adults [ 33 34 Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) The TAS-20, which is widely used in the assessment of alexithymia, was developed by Bagby et al. in 1994 [ 35 36 Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) Developed by Bernstein et al. in 1998 [ 37 38 Social Connectedness Scale (SCS) The SCS was developed to measure the individual's sense of social connectedness during and after adolescence [ 39 40 Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) The RMET was developed by Baron-Cohen et al. to assess the emotion recognition, mental state analysis, and ToM skills of children with ASD [ 41 42 Statistical analysis To determine whether the variables were suitable for parametric tests, kurtosis and skewness values were analyzed and both values were expected to be within ± 2. The analyses revealed that the kurtosis and skewness values for the total score and sub-dimension scores of the Childhood Trauma Scale fell outside the ± 2 range. The inverse distribution function (IDF) method was used to transform the variables. After IDF transformation, the total score and sub-dimension scores of childhood traumas were found to be within acceptable limits and the values obtained after IDF transformation were used in all subsequent analyses. Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient method was used to determine the correlation between variables. The independent samples t-test was used to compare the mean scores of the Turkish and Syrian participants. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was performed to determine the factors affecting social cognition and social connectedness. In the analysis, alexithymia, depression, and childhood trauma were included in the model as covariates, and exposure to war, loss of a relative in war, financial loss, and financial support from the state were included as factors. The analyses were conducted using the SPSS version 25.0 software package.

In this model, social cognition and social connectedness served as dependent variables, and alexithymia, depression, and childhood trauma were included as covariates. The analysis also incorporated the following categorical variables as potential factors: “exposure to war”, “loss of a close one”, “financial loss”, and “receiving financial support from the state”, to assess their relationships with the dependent variables.

There are a limited number of studies in the literature evaluating social cognition and social connectedness in refugees. Therefore, this study seeks to broaden the scope of existing research by using a comparative study design with a large sample group. The main finding of the current study is that the Syrian refugees had lower levels of social cognition and social connectedness than the Turkish participants. In keeping with terminology commonly used in the literature, as in previous sections of the study, we will refer to Syrians in Turkey as refugees rather than individuals under temporary protection. Additionally, Türkiye does not officially recognize Syrians in the country as refugees. The definition of \"refugee\" in Türkiye is based on Article 61 of Law No. 6458 on Foreigners and International Protection, based on the Geneva Convention, and applies only to those arriving from Europe. Therefore, Syrians are not officially granted refugee status. Instead, they are considered under \"temporary protection.\" However, the fact that Syrians came to Türkiye as a mass migration, their arrival was based on political grounds such as opposition to the regime, their temporary protection status was granted at the initiative of the government, they have no current plans or intentions to return, and they are currently stateless, justifies defining them as refugees. Therefore, the choice of the term \"refugee\" in this study is consistent with both the general usage in the literature and the actual situation of the Syrians. Before moving on to the discussion of social cognition and social connectedness in the study, we would like to address the trauma findings of the refugee group. Childhood trauma scores (physical abuse, and emotional and physical neglect) of refugees were statistically significantly higher than among Turkish participants. In relation to this finding, 63.1% of the refugees reported that they were exposed to war, 50.6% lost a relative due to war, and 92.8% experienced financial loss. Previous studies showed that many Syrian refugees had been exposed to traumatic life experiences during the civil war, such as bombing, imprisonment, torture, witnessing the killing of family and/or friends, separation from family, destruction of homes, and the banning of funerals [ 12 43 44 14 15 10 Refugees may face various psychosocial problems after migration and this may negatively affect their mental health. Legal problems related to migration procedures in refugee-hosting countries, inappropriate housing conditions, unemployment, social isolation, discrimination, fear of refoulement, and limited access to psychiatric/psychological treatments are among the main difficulties experienced. In the present study, 31.3% of Syrian refugees stated that they had mental problems due to the war, and 83.5% stated that they did not receive psychological/psychiatric treatment after the war. A study conducted with Syrian refugees residing in Türkiye investigated the effects of pre- and post-migration traumatic experiences and life difficulties on the development of PTSD [ 15 44 45 10 46 8 15 45 47 In the present study, Syrian refugees performed statistically worse than Turkish participants in the RMET, which assesses ToM, and emotion recognition abilities. When depression and alexithymia variables were fixed, the difference between the groups remained significant. However, when the childhood trauma variable was fixed, the significant difference between the two groups disappeared. This pattern suggests that childhood trauma may be a key variable associated with Syrian refugees’ lower performance on the RMET, and may partially account for the observed differences between the two groups in ToM and emotion recognition. Based on these findings, we suggest that refugees exposed to war trauma may have difficulties recognizing social signals as effectively as non-refugees, potentially leading to less appropriate responses to these signals. The correlation analysis suggests a negative correlation between Syrian refugees’ RMET performance, CTQ-emotional neglect, and physical neglect. A recent study evaluating social cognition skills in children aged 6–18 years among Syrian refugees residing in Türkiye demonstarted that mothers' high levels of posttraumatic stress negatively affected children's emotional processing abilities [ 43 48 49 50 51 Our further analyses investigating interaction effects on ToM revealed that the interaction effect of being exposed to war, receiving financial support from the state, and financial loss was significant. These results show that, even when covariates are held constant, the interaction between the main variables continues to be significantly related to social cognition, suggesting a meaningful pattern of association. Among refugees, it is observed that social cognition tends to decrease in individuals who have been exposed to war, lost a relative, experienced financial loss, and those who receive financial support from the state due to these losses (Figs. 3 4 52 55 56 57 Difficulties in social cognition observed among refugees may be related to adverse childhood experiences rather than solely to their refugee status. Our study did not involve a clinical sample, but the refugee participants had been compelled to migrate due to harm or persecution. Many had encountered environments where making eye contact could present risks. At the same time, they may have made less eye contact because they considered themselves as foreigners in the country they settled in. Traumatised individuals often perceive direct eye contact as a threat [ 58 When analyzing social connectedness values between groups, it was found that the SCS scores for the Syrian refugees were statistically significantly lower than those of the Turkish participants. In the correlation analysis, low social connectedness was strongly associated with high depression, alexithymia, and childhood trauma scores. However, when alexithymia, depression, and childhood trauma scores were fixed, the significant difference between the groups disappeared. A low score on this scale means having a low sense of belonging and social connectedness. The results of our analyses suggest that refugees' lower levels of social connectedness are largely associated with the covariates controlled for in the model. There are few studies examining social connectedness in refugees. In one of these studies, in parallel with the findings of our study, low social connectedness was found to be associated with higher levels of depression in refugees [ 59 60 3 4 23 Studies with non-refugee but potentially vulnerable samples, such as war victims, homeless people, and those adjusting to a new environment or country show that social connectedness is low in these populations. In a study conducted by Schwart and Shrira in 2019 with the older people who were exposed to war, it was found that older people with high levels of social connectedness experienced fewer mental and physical health problems related to exposure to war [ 61 62 63 64 Connecting with others has been linked to physical and psychological well-being [ 65 66 67 59 68 69 Accordingly, we consider social cognition and social connectedness to be crucial themes for a successful post-migration integration. At the same time, these two concepts are variables that affect each other at many points. Individuals with strong social connectedness have better cognitive health, and social relationships slow cognitive decline [ 65 70 72 73 72 73 50 74 75 Childhood traumas seem to be a very important factor that negatively affects both social cognition skills and social connectedness levels of Syrian refugees. Furthermore, childhood traumas are known to have a negative impact on mental health in adulthood [ 76 77 79 80 82 83 50 Limitations and future research directions The findings of our study should be interpreted with consideration of various limitations. The most important limitation is that the tests and scales used were not written in Arabic and their validity and reliability for the Syrian dialect was not performed. However, the Cronbach's Alpha values of all scales used in our study correspond very well to the normative values reported in Turkish society, which supports the validity of our results. In addition, our refugee participants had been living in Türkiye for over 10 years. They received their secondary, high school, and university education in Türkiye and were educated in Turkish. Practices were perfomed one-to-one, and when needed, Syrian psychology students who were fluent in Turkish and Arabic received language support from the study assistants. Before the interview, we assessed whether the language used in the scale and test questions was comprehensible to Syrians. In addition, participants who did not have basic Turkish proficiency were not included in the study. As a second limitation is that the data were collected in Istanbul and taken from refugees not staying in camps. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to all Syrian refugees. At the same time, despite the assurance of anonymity in the responses during the data collection process, the participants may have answered the questions unrealistically with the concern of acceptability. Another limitation of the study is the uncertainty regarding whether refugees who have been integrated into Türkiye for a long time and live outside of official camps exhibit different levels of social cognitive processes, and social connectedness compared to other groups, such as migrants. Lastly, the cross-sectional design of this study constitutes an important methodologic limitation. Causal inferences cannot be made because data were collected at a single point in time. Accordingly, all reported relationships should be interpreted as associations rather than causal effects. Despite the existing limitations, the sample size is creditable because it is challenging to reach and include refugees in research studies. The present findings highlight several important directions for future research. First, future studies may further clarify the link between trauma and social cognition and social connectedness using a structured clinical interview that can diagnose PTSD. Moreover, other components of social cognition such as emotion recognition and social perception should be examined in refugees. Second, longitudinal studies are needed to trace how social cognition and social connectedness evolve over time among refugees. Longitudinal studies comparing refugee groups with different levels of integration or studies examining the impact of intervention programs on social cognition and cohesion would broaden the scope of the research regarding refugees in Türkiye and other countries. Such research designs would help scholars and those who are interested in refugee studies better understand whether damage linked to trauma continues, lessens, or changes with prolonged residence in the host country. These studies would also allow them to recognise protective factors such as social connectedness and support, education, language proficiency, and employment, which may impact the post-traumatic lives and emotions. Third, to understand and clarify the underlying mechanisms, future work should employ qualitative approaches such as structured or semi-structured clinical interviews and then support or validate the results using neurobiologic or neuroimaging methods. These mixed methodologies will allow researchers to identify both the clinical and neural findings that link trauma to difficulties in emotion recognition and theory of mind. Fourth, to evaluate the effectiveness of resilience-building group programs, culturally adapted psychotherapy techniques, and community-level activities that foster social engagement, it would be beneficial to systematically assess their impact on improving social cognition and connectivity among refugees. Finally, through examining diverse refugee groups, host nation contexts, and living conditions (such as temporary protection and permanent residency), researchers can comprehend and explain the structural and cultural elements that impact refugee adaptation. Conclusion Our results demonstrate that Syrian refugees living in Turkish society performed statistically worse in social cognition compared to Turkish participants. Childhood trauma was found to be associated with lower levels of social cognition among refugees. In terms of social cognition, the most vulnerable group includes those who have been exposed to war, lost a relative, suffered financial loss, and receive financial support from the state as a result. Our findings show that refugees also have a low sense of social connectedness. Lower levels of social connectedness were found to coincide with higher levels of alexithymia, depression, and childhood trauma. State support was related to higher levels of social cohesion in vulnerable groups such as those exposed to war, those who had lost a relative, and those who had experienced financial loss. It is important to note, however, that due to the cross-sectional nature of the study, these associations should not be interpreted as causal. We believe that during this challenging period for refugees, our study offers promising findings that could significantly aid in their integration. Refugees face many post-migration challenges such as racism, negative political discourse and stigmatisation. In light of this, it is of utmost importance to take into account the post-migration challenges faced by this vulnerable population, who have already endured severe traumatic experiences prior to migration. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is necessary to develop economic, health and social policies that facilitate the integration of refugees. Providing opportunities for social interaction and connection may be beneficial in alleviating acculturation stress among refugees. Individuals who reported multiple traumatic experiences appeared to be particularly vulnerable and might require special attention in the development of support policies. These findings underscore the importance of psychotherapeutic interventions for Syrian refugees, particularly in light of their challenges in accessing psychosocial support systems.
