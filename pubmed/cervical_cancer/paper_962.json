GPR120, one of the main receptors for LCFAs, 32 47 , 48 In particular, IFN-λ regulates mucosal responses to viral infection, 49 , 50 51 As oral CBM 588 administration increases Bifidobacterium 43 , 52 Bifidobacterium Bifidobacterium IRFs play an important role in IFN-λ production in the airway epithelium. 53 54 , 55 , 56 24 46 57 Notably, in this study, the co-administration of 10-ODA and B. longum 24 B. longum Limitations of the study Our study revealed important mechanistic insights into how CBM 588 modulates epithelial protective effects against influenza viral pneumonia. Nevertheless, this study has some limitations. First, the murine and human lung microbiomes are not identical. 58 B. longum Bifidobacterium Bifidobacterium 43 , 52 In conclusion, we revealed that the importance of the lung microbiota in early immune defense against influenza virus infection, and a particular lung microbiome, is important for butyrate-producing CBM 588-induced anti-influenza viral effects. CBM 588 altered the lung microbiome, and these alterations affected GPR120 expression levels through the Bifidobacterium Moreover, we revealed the mechanism of orally administered CBM 588-induced anti-influenza virus effects and provided insights into targets for respiratory viral infection treatment and prophylaxis. We are currently investigating the antiviral effects against other respiratory viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Additionally, this study suggests the potential for non-invasive and inexpensive methods to protect against other respiratory virus infections, in addition to influenza viruses.

The pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP (PX458) vector was gifted by Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 48138). A single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence was selected using E-CRISP ( http://www.e-crisp.org/E-CRISP/index.html FFAR4 GPR120 GPR120 GPR120 GPR120 6 GPR120 Western blot analysis Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (0.5% NP-40, 1% TritonX-100, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) and a PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). After incubating for 10 min on ice, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000× g Quantification and statistical analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA), as described in our previous study. 3 t References 1 Cia C.-T.
