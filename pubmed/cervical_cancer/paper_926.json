Cough and urinary difficulties were also noted. On her first visit, blood tests and computed tomography (CT) were performed ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Figure 1 Blood test results, computed tomography (CT) image, clinical photographs, and histological photomicrographs. (A) Blood test results upon emergence department (ED) admission. Abbreviations: CREA, Creatinine. (B) Axial and coronal view CT image obtained upon admission to the ED revealed a solid mass lesion centered in the subcutaneous tissue of the right cheek. (C) Moderate redness, swelling, and telangiectasias of the right cheek. (D) Repeated CT image 10 days after the initial scan. (E) Specimens were subjected to histopathologic examination. H&E stain revealed scattered lymphocytic infiltrates ( × 400). (F) Cytokeratin 20 staining showed a perinuclear dot-like pattern (× 400). (G) Insulinoma-associated protein 1 highlighted strong nuclear staining in tumor cells, consistent with neuroendocrine carcinoma such as Merkel cell carcinoma (× 200). Figure 1 Malignant tumors, which can cause local redness and pain, are rarely seen in emergency care. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the most common malignancy in the oral and maxillofacial region, typically involves the mucosa. 3 4 5 Declaration of competing interest The authors have no conflicts of interest relevant to this article.
