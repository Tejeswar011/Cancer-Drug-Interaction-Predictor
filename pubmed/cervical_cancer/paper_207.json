However, the precise interplay between microbial communities and tumor metabolism in PC remains poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the impact of the intratumoral microbiome, the metabolic landscape, and their interactions on PC development. Methods 16S rDNA sequencing and Untargeted metabolomic profiling were performed on 47 paired pancreatic cancer and adjacent normal tissues to analyze their intratumoral microbiome and metabolic landscapes. Bioinformatics tools were used to conduct differential microbiome abundance analysis and pathway enrichment. A correlation analysis was performed to identify key microbiota-metabolite interactions. Results 16S rDNA sequencing revealed significant differences in the abundance and diversity (α-diversity and β-diversity) of the intratumoral microbiome in PC. The predominant species in pancreatic cancer were Pseudomonas P r r P Conclusion This study suggests a relationship between the microbiome and metabolism in pancreatic cancer. We observed that Pseudomonas contributes to altered amino acid metabolism, but whether this interaction is causal and the mechanisms underlying it remain unclear. Further experimental validation is required before considering microbiome-targeted metabolic interventions as viable therapeutic strategies.

Early symptoms of pancreatic cancer are often subtle, and the majority of patients are diagnosed at a locally advanced or metastatic stage. Surgical resection is the sole effective method for achieving cure and long-term survival in pancreatic cancer patients; however, less than 20% of patients have the opportunity for curative surgical resection [ 3 4 5 4 6 A defining feature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in pancreatic cancer is the intricate interplay between the internal and external mechanisms of cancer cells, which gives rise to a TME characterized by a dense extracellular matrix, metabolic reprogramming, and pronounced immunosuppression [ 7 8 9 9 10 There is a close link between the intratumoral microbiota and host metabolic state, and this interplay may influence tumor metabolic reprogramming. The intratumoral microbiome exerts tumor-promoting or tumor-suppressive effects by engaging in metabolic reactions within the body, regulating cancer-related signaling pathways, and impacting both host cell function and immune system [ 11 12 Accumulating evidence suggests that microbiota (specifically specific well-studied oral, gastrointestinal, and intrapancreatic microbes, as well as certain hepatotropic viruses and bactibilia) and their metabolites may have potential etiological roles in altering the microenvironment of pancreatic tumors, impacting the functionality of the immune system, and regulating the biological behavior of pancreatic cancer cells, those actions can promote or inhibit the progression of pancreatic tumors [ 13 14 14 15 15 Metabolomics reveals the metabolic characteristics of PC. Despite existing in a relatively hypoxic and nutrient-poor environment, PC achieves its metabolic advantage through three mechanisms: (i) reprogramming intracellular energy metabolism, (ii) enhancing nutrient acquisition via scavenging and recycling (autophagy), and (iii) facilitating metabolic interactions with other components in its microenvironment [ 16 17 18 19 Investigating the role of the intratumoral microbiome in the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer using 16S sequencing has emerged as an active area of research. The tumor microbiome composition correlates with distinct metabolic pathways in PC patients with short-term survival (STS) versus long-term survival (LTS) [ 20 21 22 As seen from the above discussion, current research predominantly focuses on the association of individual microbiota or metabolites with PC; however, the causal mechanisms governing their dynamic interplay (e.g., how specific microbial communities mediate oncogenic metabolite synthesis) remain systematically underexplored. Traditional single-omics approaches fail to capture complex interactions within multifaceted biomolecular networks, resulting in fragmented insights into host-microbiota metabolic crosstalk. Therefore, systematically mapping the interactions between intratumoral microbiota and metabolism in PC is critical for advancing early diagnosis and targeted therapy of the disease. Microbiome-induced alterations in human metabolism may contribute to diverse metabolic diseases and cancers [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 13 13 29 30 The integration of multi-omics approaches—leveraging data-level cross-validation and interaction model construction—can elucidate key regulatory hubs in tumor progression and holds promise for advancing precision oncology [ 31 32 Akkermansia muciniphila 33 Streptococcus anginosus 27 Fusobacterium nucleatum 34 35 35 Therefore, we proposed the scientific hypothesis of this project: specific intratumoral microbiota within pancreatic cancer tissues are involved in pancreatic cancer progression by regulating metabolism-related products (e.g., amino acids). The aim of this article is to combine 16S sequencing (microbiome) and untargeted metabolomics data to systematically reveal the microbial-metabolite interaction network in pancreatic cancer tissues and to elucidate its role in tumor progression. Methods Pancreatic samples sources All human samples (including 47 cases of pancreatic cancer and adjacent tissues), as well as the clinical data, were obtained from our hospital. This study was conducted in accordance with the regulations of the tissue biobank and approval by the Ethics Committee of our hospital. All patients provided written informed consent. Experimental techniques and procedures Untargeted metabolomic analysis(LC–MS/MS) PC samples were thawed slowly at 4℃ and metabolites were extracted according to the experimental procedure. LC–MS/MS analysis was performed using an UHPLC (1290 Infinity LC, Agilent Technologies) coupled to a quadrupole time-of-flight (AB Sciex TripleTOF 6600), in both positive and negative ion modes. The raw MS data were converted to MzXML files using ProteoWizard MSConvert before importing into freely available XCMS software. After sum-normalization, the processed data were analyzed by R package (ropls). Data analysis includes univariate statistical analysis, multidimensional statistical analysis, differential metabolite screening, differential metabolite metabolic pathway enrichment, and other bioinformatics analyses. Differential analysis between two sample groups often utilizes univariate statistical methods, including Fold Change Analysis (FC Analysis) and non-parametric tests (e.g., t-test). Based on the results of univariate analysis, differential analysis is performed on all detected metabolites, including those that are unidentified. Metabolites were classified as differential if they meet the criteria of FC > 1.5 or FC < 0.67 and have a P . P Microbiome analysis (16S rDNA sequencing) DNA extraction, detection, PCR amplification, purification of amplification products, fluorescence quantification, library preparation, and V3-V4 variable region amplification and sequencing were performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing platform. Raw data obtained from sequencing were processed using the default parameters of QIIME2 for quality control analysis to obtain Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) for ASV/Operational Taxonomic Units (OUT) clustering and annotation. Subsequently, the data analysis was carried out, including community structure analysis, alpha (α) diversity analysis, beta (β) diversity analysis, species difference analysis and function prediction. Specifically, α and β diversity indices were calculated using QIIME2 software (with default parameters). α diversity (including Chao 1, Shannon and Simpson indices) was used to analyze the diversity of microbial communities within the sample. β Diversity compared the microbial community composition of different samples. Anosim analysis was used to examines whether the differences between groups were significantly greater than the differences within groups. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine whether differences in species diversity between groups were statistically significant ( P Multi-omics correlation analysis Microbiota with significant differences identified in the 16S microbiome were integrated with the metabolites that showed significant differences in the metabolome. Spearman correlation analysis was used to identify associations between significantly different flora (LEfSe LDA > 2 and P P Correlation Analysis of Clinical Data ①Correlation analysis of clinical staging: The correlation analysis between alpha diversity indices (ACE, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices) and clinical staging was conducted. Additionally, the relative abundance of Pseudomonas was analyzed in relation to clinical staging.

Pathway analysis identified several amino acid metabolic pathways (such as those involving glycine, serine, and aspartic acid) as being prominently altered in pancreatic cancer, with a particular emphasis on glutamate metabolism, which is involved in glutamine metabolism pathway. Metabolic reprogramming in pancreatic cancer cells, which enables adaptation to increased energy demands, includes enhanced glucose metabolism, glutamine metabolism, and fatty acid oxidation. These changes have been extensively documented [ 44 45 19 Microbiomic and metabolomic association analyses revealed significant correlations between Pseudomonas Pseudomonas 46 44 19 44 47 48 19 49 50 19 Pseudomonas Pseudomonas aeruginosa 51 52 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 53 54 55 56 Pseudomonas Pseudomonas From a clinical perspective, the results of our study offer several potential applications for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer: (i) Discovery of potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets: The abundance of Pseudomonas Pseudomonas 15 57 Pseudomonas Pseudomonas Pseudomona 19 58 59 Pseudomonas Pseudomonas Pseudomonas 21 Gammaproteobacteria 40 60 15 61 Pseudomonas 19 44 Pseudomonas Pseudomonas Pseudomonas, Pseudomonas Limitations of this study and strategies to address are as follow: (i) Sample size: The sample size in this study is relatively small, especially the reduction of samples for 16S sequencing, which may limit the ability to fully capture the diversity and heterogeneity of the microbiome and metabolome in pancreatic cancer patients. The implications of this reduction on the generalizability of results: ①Insufficient Representativeness: Given the substantial inter-individual variability in microbiomes, analyzing only 16 samples may not adequately reflect the microbiome characteristics of the entire study population. This reduction in sample size may lead to biased research outcomes, failing to accurately capture the comprehensive relationship between the microbiome and the study variables. ②Reduced Statistical Power: A smaller sample size may in result insufficient statistical power, thereby increasing the risk of Type I errors (false positives) and Type II errors (false negatives). This can make it difficult to detect biologically significant differences. Consequently, some potential microbiome features or biomarkers may be overlooked, thereby affecting the reliability of the study conclusions. ③Limited Extrapolation Capability: Conclusions drawn from a smaller sample may be restricted when extrapolated to or larger more complex populations. The composition and function of the microbiome are influenced by a variety of factors, such as diet, environment, and genetic background. For instance, the alpha diversity and abundance of Pseudomonas 62 38 20 21 63 65 66 67 69 69 Pseudomonas Pseudomonas Pseudomonas Pseudomonas Pseudomonas . Pseudomonas n , 70 The following directions deserve further exploration to deepen the understanding of the pancreatic cancer microenvironment and to facilitate the advancement of basic research to clinical translation: (i) Validation of the causal relationship between Pseudomonas Pseudomonas Pseudomonas Pseudomonas Pseudomonas . Pseudomonas . Conclusions Collectively, this study provides preliminary evidence of an interaction between Pseudomonas and amino acids in the pancreatic cancer microenvironment, suggesting a potential association with its regulation. It proposes a novel theoretical framework for the \"microbe-metabolism-cancer\" mechanism, which could enhance our understanding of pancreatic cancer pathogenesis. However, the causal relationship and underlying mechanisms remain unexplored experimentally and require further validation. These findings highlight future research possibilities for exploring diagnostic and therapeutic implications in pancreatic cancer, but they do not establish direct applications for early diagnosis, personalized treatment, or prognosis improvement.
