This study aims to analyse the efficacy of botulinum toxin type A (BT-A) in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Methods This systematic literature review, guided by PRISMA, applied the PICO strategy with the following criteria: (P = patients with neuropathic pain, I = botulinum toxin, C = placebo or active drug, and O = pain relief). Results Fourteen articles, all randomised controlled trials with a placebo control, were included in the review. A total of 645 patients were randomised, with 353 patients receiving treatment with botulinum toxin type A in doses ranging from 25U to 400U. The evaluated studies addressed trigeminal neuralgia, diabetic polyneuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, spinal cord injury, phantom limb pain, and peripheral neuropathic pain after trauma or surgery. Conclusion BT-A has emerged as a promising treatment for various origins of neuropathic pain. Therefore, future studies should adopt stricter criteria regarding dosage and routes of administration to ensure effective and consistent BT-A application.
