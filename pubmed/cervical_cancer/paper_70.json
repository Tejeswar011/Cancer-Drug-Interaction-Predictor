Cuproptosis, a recently discovered form of regulated cell death involving copper ion metabolism, has emerged as a promising approach for tumor therapy. This pathway not only directly eliminates tumor cells but also promotes immunogenic cell death (ICD), reshaping the tumor microenvironment (TME) and initiating robust anti-tumor immune responses. However, translating cuproptosis-based therapies into clinical applications is hindered by challenges, including complex metabolic regulation, TME heterogeneity, and the precision required for effective drug delivery. To address these limitations, nanoparticles offer transformative solutions by providing precise delivery of cuproptosis-inducing agents, controlled drug release, and enhanced therapeutic efficacy through simultaneous modulation of metabolic pathways and immune responses. This review systematically discusses recent advancements in nanoparticle-based cuproptosis delivery systems, highlighting nanoparticle design principles and their synergistic effects when integrated with other therapeutic modalities such as ICB, PTT, and CDT. Furthermore, we explore the potential of cuproptosis-based nanomedicine for personalized cancer treatment by emphasizing strategies for TME stratification and therapeutic optimization tailored to patient profiles. By integrating current insights from metabolic reprogramming, tumor immunotherapy, and nanotechnology, this review aims to facilitate the clinical translation of cuproptosis nanomedicine and significantly contribute to the advancement of precision oncology.

Unlike traditional forms of cell death modalities, cuproptosis disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis through intracellular copper accumulation, triggering oxidative stress and leading to proteotoxicity 1 2 Tumor cells frequently exhibit metabolic reprogramming to adapt to the harsh microenvironment, enabling rapid proliferation and immune evasion 3 1 4 5 Nanocarriers, with their unique physicochemical properties, offer promising solutions to address these therapeutic challenges 6 7 8 9 10 11 , 12 Fig. 1 Figure 1 Term co-occurrence network analysis of cuproptosis-related research using VOSviewer.

The distinct mechanisms of cuproptosis, including its capacity to induce oxidative stress and modulate the tumor immune microenvironment, offer potential to strengthen anti-tumor immunity. However, gaining a deeper understanding of these mechanisms-and designing drugs that precisely trigger cuproptosis while circumventing metabolic barriers-remains a major challenge. 2.1 Molecular mechanisms of cuproptosis and their immunological implications Cuproptosis is a unique form of regulated cell death characterized primarily by mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by excessive copper accumulation. This accumulation impairs mitochondria respiration, reducing ATP synthesis, increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and promoting oxidative stress 18 19 20 Beyond directly influencing tumor cell viability, cuproptosis holds significant implications for tumor immunology, notably through the induction of ICD. ICD results from the oxidative stress and extensive ROS production associated with cuproptosis 21 2 22 23 + 16 24 Fig. 2 Figure 2 Biological mechanisms of cuproptosis and its effects on immune activation and ICD in tumor cells. Copper ion transport and accumulation result in cuproptosis, generating ROS, and activating the cGAS–STING and AMPK pathways. Subsequent proteotoxic stress drives immune activation by promoting DC maturation, which then augments the immune response and boosts anti-tumor efficacy. Red arrows signify cuproptosis mechanisms, green arrows depict metabolic process, and blue arrows represent immune pathways. Figure 2 Interestingly, copper-induced oxidative stress can intersect with other cellular processes, especially ferroptosis. Copper and iron both contribute to ROS accumulation via 25 26 via 27 28 29 2.2 Progress in the development of drugs related to cuproptosis The development of therapeutic agents targeting copper metabolism for cancer treatment includes strategies designed either to reduce copper bioavailability or enhance copper accumulation within tumor cells, thus triggering cuproptosis. Copper chelators, such as d α 30 , 31 32 33 Cuproptosis-related drugs are generally classified into two main groups: copper-containing compounds and copper ion carriers, both capable of inducing cuproptosis by modulating copper metabolism within tumor cells ( Table 1 21 , 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 ) 58 2 59 2 in vivo 60 Table 1 Overview of drugs inducing cuproptosis: types, mechanisms, immunological effects, and clinical Applications.

ES targets mitochondria and facilitates cuproptosis through the formation of ES–Cu complexes 55 61 2.3 Challenges of cuproptosis in tumor metabolism and immune regulation Tumor cells exhibit remarkable metabolic plasticity, allowing them to survive and proliferate despite harsh microenvironmental stresses, including those triggered by cuproptosis. This adaptive capacity involves enhancing antioxidant defenses 62 63 64 65 Although cuproptosis has the potential to activate anti-tumor immune responses, its effectiveness is significantly limited by immunosuppressive components within the TME. Cells such as Tregs and MDSCs suppress immune activation 66 β 67 68 In addition to biological challenges, the clinical translation of cuproptosis-inducing agents faces substantial hurdles related to drug delivery. Conventional cuproptosis inducers often undergo rapid metabolism and clearance in vivo 69 3 Nanopreparations for cuproptosis: mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming and immune activation Nanopreparations serve as powerful carrier systems that precisely regulate the onset of cuproptosis and modulate the tumor immune microenvironment through metabolic reprogramming. These nanoparticles can be engineered to target specific metabolic pathways in tumor cells, such as mitochondrial stress, glycolysis, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. By fine-tuning these processes, nanocarriers enhance copper accumulation, induce oxidative stress, and promote ICD, which collectively improve the anti-tumor immune response ( Fig. 3 Figure 3 Metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells and immune microenvironment modulation via Figure 3 3.1 Metabolic distinctions between cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and apoptosis The core metabolic mechanism of cuproptosis lies in the fact that intracellular copper ion overload leads to abnormal aggregation of lipoylated proteins of DLAT, a key enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which triggers a toxic gain of function 1 Table 2 1 , 70 71 72 73 , 74 75 , 76 Table 2 Comparison of cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and apoptosis in metabolic pathways and therapeutic implications.

Copper ion carriers synergistically target copper ions specifically to tumor cells, whereas normal cells can be less toxic due to the protective effect of the copper homeostasis regulatory proteins ATP7A/B 77 78 , 79 80 , 81 70 82 3.2 Mitochondrial stress and immune activation Mitochondria are key sites for the initiation of cuproptosis. Copper accumulation leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, reducing ATP synthesis and increasing ROS production, which activates immune cells through PRRs 83 via 22 , 84 , 85 Nanopreparations can enhance mitochondrial stress by targeting mitochondria specifically. Mitochondria-targeted nanoparticles, such as those functionalized with triphenylphosphine (TPP), exploit the high lipophilicity and negative potential of the mitochondrial membrane, facilitating copper ion accumulation and boosting ROS generation 86 87 88 89 90 This mitochondrial stress enhances immune responses by promoting the infiltration of effector T cells and suppressing MDSCs 91 e.g e.g 92 , 93 e.g. 94 3.3 Glucose metabolism and immune effects The core mechanism of cuproptosis lies in the binding of copper ions to lipoylated proteins in the mitochondrial TCA cycle, which inhibits their activity and triggers metabolic disorders 1 95 FRMD4A 96 1 Abnormal glucose metabolism in tumor cells contributes not only to rapid tumor growth but also to the establishment of an immunosuppressive TME 97 + 98 , 99 α 100 , 101 Nanopreparations can target and modulate glucose metabolism in tumor cells, overcoming these metabolic barriers and enhancing immune response 102 , 103 87 41 104 105 Surface modifications of nanocarriers can also enhance tumor-targeting specificity 106 e.g 107 , 108 3.4 The role of lipid metabolism in immune regulation Lipid metabolism in tumor cells play a pivotal role in regulating immune responses and the TME. High cholesterol levels in the TME can induce CD8 + + 109 γ 110 , 111 During cuproptosis, lipid peroxidation and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) are promoted, generating large amounts of ROS 112 113 , 114 α 115 , 116 Nanoparticles such as copper metal–organic frameworks (Cu-MOFs), loaded with mitofloxacin and axitinib, can synergistically drive cuproptosis versus ferroptosis via 117 3.5 Amino acid metabolism and regulation of the immune microenvironment Tumor cells regulate amino acid metabolism to support their growth and suppress immune responses, particularly through glutamine metabolism and tryptophan metabolism. Glutamine is converted to glutamate via 118 119 + + 120 Nanopreparations can target and modulate glutamine metabolism, enhancing immune responses in the TME. Copper-doped polypyrrole nanoparticles modified with PM-coated BPTES (a GLS inhibitor) have been shown to inhibit glutamine metabolism, increasing ROS production and enhancing ICD 121 122 Tryptophan metabolism has a potent immunosuppressive function, and its main metabolic pathway is the kynurenine (KYN) pathway 123 124 125 126 127 128 In addition, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) are converted to α 129 + 130 , 131 + 132 3.6 The role of autophagy in immune regulation Autophagy plays a dual role in immune regulation by both suppressing and enhancing immune responses. In the TME, autophagy promotes tumor cell survival by activating AMPK under hypoxic conditions, and tumor cells can evade immune surveillance by degrading MHC class I molecules 133 , 134 135 via + 136 Nanopreparations can modulate autophagy to enhance immunogenic cell death. By targeting autophagy pathways, nanocarriers can trigger ROS-induced autophagy, enhancing the release of DAMPs such as HMGB1 and ATP, which increase DC maturation and immune cell activation 137 via 138 3.7 Summary of the differential impact of cuproptosis on tumor metabolism and immune activation We explored the pivotal role of nanopreparations in mediating cuproptosis-induced metabolic reprogramming and immune activation. Nanocarriers target mitochondrial stress, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and autophagy to regulate the tumor microenvironment and promote immune responses.

Cuproptosis affects TAM metabolic reprogramming and polarization through mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. M2-type TAM is dependent on OXPHOS and FAO 151 23 , 152 101 153 The strategic combination of cuproptosis inducers with metabolic modulators and immune checkpoint inhibitors further strengthens immune responses, overcoming immune escape mechanisms. In a BC model, cuproptosis significantly increases CD8 + 154 4 Design of cuproptosis-based nanoparticles Nanotechnology-based immunomodulatory nanopreparations for cuproptosis offer a promising strategy to enhance cuproptosis induction and immune responses in cancer therapy. These advanced delivery systems not only allow precise control over drug release but also enable the targeted delivery of cuproptosis inducers to the tumor site, increasing their efficacy while minimizing off-target effects. The ability of nanoparticles to modulate the TME and induce ICD presents a significant opportunity for improving tumor immunotherapy ( Fig. 4 Figure 4 Cuproptosis nanoplatforms for TME modulation to enhance antitumor therapy. Cuproptosis nanoplatforms are carefully engineered to induce cuproptosis and reshape the immune microenvironment through multiple strategies, including targeted copper ion delivery, TME modulation, metabolic interference, and immune adjuvant integration. Figure 4 4.1 Organic nanoparticles Organic nanomaterials are particularly well-suited for promoting cuproptosis and enhancing immune responses due to their excellent biocompatibility, modifiable surface properties, and controlled drug release capabilities 155 4.1.1 Polymer nanoparticles Polymeric materials commonly used as nanoparticle coatings, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified polymers and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), provide nanoparticles with ‘stealth’ characteristics. These stealth properties prevent rapid clearance by the immune system, thereby extending circulation times and enhancing drug bioavailability 156 2000 2 21 Moreover, polymeric nanoparticles can be designed to respond specifically to the oxidative stress generated during cuproptosis, primarily through Fenton-like reactions and associated ROS production. ROS-responsive polymers release additional copper ions under oxidative stress, enhancing copper accumulation in tumor cells and intensifying the cytotoxic effects associated with cuproptosis 24 157 Fig. 5 158 Figure 5 Schematic illustration of the mechanism by which Cu-Pic/HA nanoparticles enhance pyroptosis and cuproptosis via 158 Figure 5 Certain polymers also actively modulate immune response. For instance, polylactic acid-hydroxyacetic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles are efficiently internalized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to accumulation in peripheral immune organs such as lymph nodes. This accumulation facilitates the activation and differentiation of T cells 159 160 161 162 + + 163 + 164 4.1.2 Liposomes Liposomes are versatile, lipid bilayer-enclosed vesicles composed of amphiphilic lipids or phospholipids, enabling them to encapsulate bot hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents 165 166 167 168 Additionally, liposomes can be functionally modified to achieve targeted release of cuproptosis inducers. This can be accomplished through the B-cell/antibody recognition pathway or by leveraging cancer-specific peptides presented on MHC-I molecules for T cell targeting 169 , 170 4.1.3 Polyelectrolyte complexes Polyelectrolyte complexes are used to encapsulate copper ions, facilitating their prolonged circulation and enhancing their ability to trigger cuproptosis in tumor cells. The positively charged regions of these nanoparticles interact with the negatively charged cell membrane, promoting the uptake of the encapsulated drugs and enhancing copper ion delivery directly to the mitochondria of tumor cells. In addition to their role in cuproptosis induction, polyelectrolyte complexes can be engineered for gene therapy. For example, delivery of STING agonists through these complexes activates dendritic cells and T cells, enhancing tumor immunogenicity while simultaneously promoting cuproptosis 171 p53 172 173 174 4.2 Inorganic nanoparticles Inorganic nanoparticles are particularly advantageous in cuproptosis-based therapy due to their high structural stability, optical and thermal properties, and catalytic activity. These properties make them ideal for both drug delivery and immune activation, especially in combination with photothermal and photodynamic therapies. The ability of metal nanoparticles to catalyze the Fenton reaction effectively promotes ICD, enhancing the anti-tumor immune response. Moreover, the integration of organic and inorganic materials through hybridization allows for multifunctional capabilities that improve drug efficacy and therapeutic outcomes. 4.2.1 Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) MOFs are a promising class of inorganic nanomaterials that can be engineered to load copper ions, cuproptosis inducers, and immunomodulatory agents, making them an effective platform for both drug delivery and immune system activation. MOFs can be synthesized using impregnation-phosphorylation, solvothermal, and electrochemical methods 175 176 177 + 178 MOFs can be modified to optimize immune activation. Spike-like Cu-MOFs, for instance, can physically interact with the tumor cell membrane, triggering mechanical stimulation-sensitive cellular responses, including DNA damage and activation of the cGAS–STING pathway, which enhances immune system activation 179 180 In addition, OPDEA coating can be performed outside the Cu-MOFs to increase the cell membrane affinity of the nanoparticles through surface modification and promote effective uptake by tumor cells 87 181 Fig. 6 182 Figure 6 CS/MTO-Cu@AMI nano-adjuvant reverses chemoresistance and activates anti-tumor immunity through cuproptosis-induced mitochondrial damage, inhibition of megaloblast action and exosome release.

The positively charged lamellar structure of Cu-LDHs facilitates interactions with negatively charged cell membranes, promoting effective cellular uptake. After internalization, it is suitable for causing copper ion release in the extremely acidic environment of lysosomes, triggering mitochondrial damage and enhancing the cuproptosis effect. Intratumoral administration can continuously acidify the tumor microenvironment, impede the lysosome-dependent autophagy process in tumor cells, and increase the number of anti-tumor TAMs and T cells, effectively inhibiting BC proliferation in vivo 187 .

These nanoparticles take advantage of the unique properties of cells from various origins, allowing for targeted delivery and immune system evasion. By utilizing cell membranes or their components, these nanoparticles can evade immune clearance, prolong circulation time, and enhance the efficacy of cuproptosis while simultaneously promoting immune activation. 4.3.1 Platelet membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles Platelets naturally express surface proteins such as CD47, CD55, and CD59, which allow them to evade immune recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages 195 , 196 2 197 4.3.2 Tumor cell membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles Membranes derived from tumor cells offer superior protection against immune surveillance compared to platelet membranes, allowing for more efficient targeting of solid tumors.

Overall, incorporating these nanoparticles into cuproptosis-based treatment strategies offers a promising solution for overcoming tumor therapy challenges and enhancing clinical outcomes. 5 Synergistic application of cuproptosis nanopreparations with immunotherapy Cuproptosis presents a promising avenue for tumor immunotherapy by triggering immune responses and enhancing the efficacy of traditional therapies. When combined with other therapeutic modalities, such as ICB, PTT, and sonodynamic therapy (SDT), cuproptosis has demonstrated synergistic effects, providing a more effective and personalized treatment strategy ( Fig. 9 Figure 9 Synergistic mechanisms between cuproptosis and combined therapeutic modalities in enhancing anti-Tumor immunity. Multiple therapeutic strategies synergize with cuproptosis by elevating ROS levels, inducing oxidative stress, and disrupting organelle homeostasis (including mitochondria, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and lysosomes). These effects collectively enhance tumor immunogenicity and relieve immunosuppression, thereby potentiating anti-tumor immune responses.

Nano-heterostructures consisting of heterogeneous carbon nitride nanosheets (HCN) and copper-loaded 1T-MoS 2 232 MOF-derived materials, such as copper-loaded mesoporous structures, improve the efficiency of PDT by maximizing photosensitizer loading and enhancing ROS generation. Dispersion of single-atom nanoenzymes (SAzymes) in MOF maximizes catalytic activity and induces cuproptosis and ferroptosis, thereby reversing the TME 181 5.5 Combination with sonodynamic therapy (SDT) SDT uses ultrasound (US) to activate acoustic sensitisers, which generate ROS and trigger a cavitation effect, thereby promoting tumor cell death. Although it has a similar mechanism of ROS generation as in PDT and the antitumor immune effects are also limited by the hypoxic conditions of TME, SDT has greater tissue permeability and catalytic properties 233 Fig. 9 45 , 231 MOF-derived materials with high surface area and porous structure enhance the ultrasound cavitation effect, facilitating ROS generation under US irradiation. Cu 2 2 via 45 LDH due to its unique layered structure permits optimization of its acoustic-dynamic therapeutic properties through chemical composition and structural modulation. Copper-substituted ZnAl ternary LDH nanosheets (ZCA NS) exhibit a strong Jahn-Teller effect that provides additional active sites to promote ROS generation. ZCA NS exhibits excellent ICD properties under ultrasound irradiation and enhances immune effects by increasing cuproptosis and SDT sensitivity through GSH depletion ( Fig. 10 211 Figure 10 Schematic representation of the underlying mechanism of SDT/Cuproptosis tumor immunotherapy synergistic therapy mediated by ZCA NSs.

Notably, most preclinical efforts favor combination therapies over monotherapies, leveraging synergistic mechanisms to enhance the efficacy of cuproptosis ( Table 5 21 , 42 , 87 , 94 , 164 , 167 , 185 , 188 , 194 , 235 , 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 Table 5 Comparison of cuproptosis combination therapies with immunotherapy.

However, variable copper metabolism among tumor cells creates challenges, affecting patient responses to cuproptosis-based therapies. Precise patient screening and tailored treatment regimens based on individual metabolic profiles are essential for maximizing the effectiveness of cuproptosis-mediated immunotherapy. 6.1 Metabolomics-guided precision therapy for cuproptosis and clinical translation Metabolomics, as central tool in precision medicine, systematically analyzes dynamic metabolite changes in tissues and biofluids, capturing genome, environmental, and microbiome influences 253 , 254 255 256 Cuproptosis disrupts the TCA cycle, induces lipid peroxidation, and collapses energy metabolism, producing unique metabolic fingerprints characterized by impaired TCA enzyme function, glutathione depletion, oxidative stress, and disrupted ATP synthesis 1 257 via 258 259 Humanized models are also essential for preclinical validation of cuproptosis nanoformulations, accurately replicating human immune environments and metabolic profiles 260 + 261 262 6.2 Patient screening based on tumor copper metabolic profile Copper metabolism biomarkers, including cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs, e.g 1 e.g 263 264 Table 6 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 265 267 275 276 Table 6 Clinical implications of cuproptosis-related biomarkers across different cancer types.

PET/CT integrates functional and anatomical data to monitor tumor metabolism in real time 284 64 285 286 6.3 Hierarchical modulation of the immune microenvironment and therapeutic optimization TME is a critical determinant of tumor immunotherapy efficacy. The TME's heterogeneity can markedly influence tumor responses, underscoring the need for precise environmental modulation in individualized therapy. In highly aggressive tumors ( e.g β 287 , 288 Cuproptosis helps counter these challenges by inducing oxidative stress in the TME, driving the of M2-to M1-macrophage polarization and bolstering anti-tumor immune responses 24 21 289 , 290 via e.g 174 , 179 Additionally, tumors frequently experience hypoxia, which activates angiogenic factors ( e.g α 291 , 292 293 e.g 117 6.4 AI-driven design of cuproptosis nanopreparations Artificial intelligence (AI) can synergize data-driven predictions with domain-specific knowledge to play a key role in the design of cuproptosis nano-formulations. Inspired by advanced platforms such as FormulationDT, researchers can use machine learning to analyze structural correlations between drug molecules and their formulation properties to optimize copper-based nanocarriers 294 294 These platforms are typically based on large amounts of drug formulation data for training and learning. The FormulationAI platform, for example, covers exhaustive data on six major drug formulation systems and can accurately predict a wide range of key properties of formulations 295 296 , 297 Artificial intelligence can also predict cell abundance within a wide range of tumors, using deep neural network (DNN) models to predict cell proportions by analyzing the gene expression profiles of tumor cells, thus providing a basis for targeted tumor therapy 298 299 300 , 301 6.5 Cuproptosis and liquid biopsy: real-time monitoring and efficacy prediction Incorporating copper metabolic profiles with liquid biopsy offers a powerful approach to monitor the process of cuproptosis and evaluate its therapeutic efficacy in real time. By tracking copper ion levels in the bloodstream, liquid biopsies not only reflect the initiation of cuproptosis but also provide insight into changes in copper metabolism within tumor cells, especially in the context of sugar and lipid metabolism 302 , 303 Liquid biopsies can detect changes in DAMPs such as HMGB1 and ATP, which signal immune activation triggered by cuproptosis. Liquid biopsy also offers valuable information about immune responses by assessing the expression of immune cells like T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, as well as immune factors such as IFN- γ α 304 305 Moreover, multidrug resistance (MDR), a common challenge in cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, can be effectively addressed by liquid biopsy 306 307 308 309 310 In conclusion, cuproptosis-induced tumor immunotherapy holds great promise, particularly with the advancement of precision medicine. Nanopreparations play a key role in modulating copper metabolism and tumor immunity, offering targeted therapeutic benefits. These treatments can improve tumor immune responses by inducing ICD and reprogramming tumor metabolism, which enhances the effectiveness of immune therapies. Personalized treatment approaches, informed by individual tumor characteristics and copper metabolic profiles, are crucial for optimizing cuproptosis therapies. Technologies like liquid biopsies and AI-driven design can further refine these treatments. The advantages and limitations of nanopreparations in regulating cuproptosis and immune activation, underscore the need for tailored strategies to maximize treatment efficacy and improve clinical outcomes ( Fig. 11 Figure 11 Advantages and disadvantages of nanopreparations in regulating cuproptosis-induced tumor metabolism and immunity at cellular, tissue, and clinical levels. Figure 11 7 Summary and outlook The discovery of cuproptosis as a novel mode of cell death, first identified by Tsvetkov and colleagues 1 ex vivo in vivo To realize the full potential of cuproptosis-based nanomedicine strategies, future research must address critical scientific questions and technical bottlenecks on multiple fronts. First, the mechanistic relationship between cuproptosis and immune regulation needs comprehensive and systematic analysis. Specifically, studies should clarify whether the metabolic signaling pathways directly influence immune cell phenotype remodeling or if their effects on the TME occur indirectly through mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress responses. Employing integrated multi-omics approaches will be essential for resolving these complexities. If non-metabolic regulatory pathways are involved this could affect the targeting strategies employed by nanomedicine formulations, necessitating reassessment of their therapeutic suitability. Second, translating cuproptosis-induced immune activation into effective anti-tumor responses remains challenging due to the involvement of complex molecular networks and signaling pathways. Thus, strategies to optimize cuproptosis-mediated immunomodulation through rational combination with other therapeutic modalities are essential for enhancing overall therapeutic efficacy. Finally, clinical validation of cuproptosis-related therapies is still in its infancy, and transitioning from fundamental research to large-scale clinical trials remains a significant hurdle. Consequently, future studies should prioritize mechanism elucidation, nanoformulation optimization, and rational combination therapies to expedite clinical translation. In conclusion, cuproptosis presents an exciting and innovative strategy for advancing cancer immunotherapy. With ongoing technological improvements and deeper mechanistic insights, cuproptosis-mediated immunotherapies have substantial potential to evolve into more effective and personalized cancer treatments, ultimately benefiting patients through improved clinical outcomes.
