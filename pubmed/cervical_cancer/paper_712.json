The aesthetic appearance of chicken carcasses has become increasingly important in the context of poultry ice-fresh sales, in conjunction with the comprehensive implementation of China’s policies for poultry. Feather follicle development is a significant factor in determining the aesthetic appearance of the carcass. Recent studies have focused on the molecular mechanisms associated with feather follicle development. The WNT, EGF, FGF, SHH, and BMP signalling pathways have been identified as the regulatory mechanisms involved in the development of feather follicles in various segments of poultry skin. However, the BMP signalling pathway, acting as an inhibitor, has been demonstrated to impede the regulatory processes governing feather follicle development via these signalling pathways. This review summarises the structure and overview of feathers and feather follicles, the research progress of signalling pathways that affect the development of poultry feather follicles, the research progress of poultry follicle traits, and the research progress of feather follicle development biotechnology. The present review focuses on summarising the molecular mechanisms that affect feather follicle development, and on providing a summary of the application of biotechnology in this field. It also offers ideas and theoretical references for the molecular mechanism of poultry feather follicle development. feather follicle development poultry molecular mechanism Scientific Research Program of Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences NKYRCZX2025020 Sichuan Province Basic Scientifc Research Projec SASA202512 Original Innovation Project of Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences YSCX2035-004 National Modern Agricultural Industrial Technology System Construction Project CARS-41 Sichuan Science and Technology Program 2021YFYZ0031 Special Project for Financial Operation SASA2024CZYX002 Sichuan Province Innovation Team Project SCCXTD-2025-24 SCCXTD-2025-25 ‘5+1’ Agricultural Frontier Technology Research Project of Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences 5+1QYGG005 Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Yibin City 2024NYHZ014 This research was funded by Scientific Research Program of Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NKYRCZX2025020), Sichuan Province Basic Scientifc Research Projec (SASA202512), Original Innovation Project of Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences (YSCX2035-004), National Modern Agricultural Industrial Technology System Construction Project (Grant No. CARS-41), Sichuan Science and Technology Program (2021YFYZ0031), Special Project for Financial Operation (SASA2024CZYX002), Sichuan Province Innovation Team Project (SCCXTD-2025-24, SCCXTD-2025-25), ‘5+1’ Agricultural Frontier Technology Research Project of Sichuan Academy of Agricultural Sciences (5+1QYGG005), Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Project of Yibin City (2024NYHZ014). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction: The Structure and Overview of Feather and Feather Follicles 1.1. The Structure and Overview of Feather The first documented appearance of feathers on dinosaurs was during the Jurassic period, approximately 150–160 million years ago. A type of theropod dinosaur that possessed feathers survived the mass extinction and became the ancestor of birds [ 1 2 3 4 1.1.1. The Structure and Classification of Feathers Feathers are the keratinized products of epidermal cell proliferation in birds. The feathers of domestic poultry exhibit a wide range of branching structures [ 5 6 Figure 1 7 8 7 9 10 1.1.2. The Development of Feathers The development of feathers is a complex biological process that involves various types of feathers and multiple developmental stages [ 11 12 13 Feathers are primarily constituted of the soft keratinous layer material that is formed by the α and β keratin gene family [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 1.2. The Structure and Overview of Feather Follicles The growth and development of feathers is subject to the regulation of feather follicles. Follicle size not only determines feather growth-rate by mass, but also directly the structural design (shape, number of barbs, etc.) of a feather [ 22 13 23 12 24 The formation of feather follicles is a unique occurrence in the life of a poultry, taking place exclusively during the embryonic stage [ 25 8 On day 10 of the embryo stage, the rapid proliferation of mesenchymal cells commences, thereby forming the dermis layer within the developing feather follicle wall. This process is typically concluded by days 11 to 12 of the embryo stage. As the columnar cells on the dermal surface accumulate, the feather papilla is formed, thereby providing nutrients for feather growth. During the embryo stage of goose development, spanning the 13 to 14 days, the feather papilla undergoes thickening, leading to the formation of the feather primordium and the epithelial layer. The epidermis undergoes further expansion to form the feather bud, which then undergoes further invagination to form the primary feather follicle. The formation of secondary feather follicles occurs on the 18th day of the embryo stage of the goose [ 26 27 During days 7 to 9 of embryonic stage, the chicken embryo develops an epidermal basal plate above the dermal condensation of the skin. The skin becomes elevated, and the feather primordia commence differentiation on day 9 of the embryonic stage. Feather buds begin to emerge from days 10 to 11 of the embryonic stage, the anterior and posterior extremities of the feather buds undergo asymmetric elongation, the formation of the feather follicle wall or primary feather follicle is initiated by the invagination of the epidermis, a process that is facilitated by the feather primordia. From days 13 to 14 of the embryonic stage, the formation of the feather follicle cavity occurs. Mesenchymal cells undergo a process of differentiation, ultimately forming the feather papilla. From days 15 to 16 of the embryonic stage, the formation of feather buds, otherwise known as secondary feather follicles, occurs. The growth and development of the primary feather follicle and the secondary feather follicle are not mutually exclusive [ 24 28 It has been proven in ducks that cell proliferation occurs in the epithelium on day 11 of the embryonic stage, resulting in the formation of feather buds. On day 15 of the embryonic stage, the primary feather follicles form, and the newly formed feather follicles are filled with the feather sheaths. On day 20 of the embryonic stage, the feather follicles and the feather sheaths are closely connected, forming a single layer, and the feathers completely cover the entire body [ 29 30 Table 1 2. Research Progress on the Effects of the Feather Follicle Signalling Pathway The development of feather follicles is initiated by the interaction between epidermal and dermal fibroblasts during the embryonic stage. This process can be categorised into three phases: the growth phase, the degeneration phase, and the quiescent phase [ 31 32 Table 2 33 34 2.1. Wnt Signalling Pathway The Wnt family has been identified as comprising over 19 family members. Depending on the ligands and downstream factors, the Wnt signalling pathway can be broadly classified into the canonical and noncanonical pathways ( Figure 2 56 4 35 36 37 WNT7A WNT9B 38 FOXO3 39 40 41 57 58 59 MLPH 60 MLPH MLPH 61 2.2. SHH Signalling Pathway The Shh signalling pathway is one of the complex signal transduction mechanisms that control the developmental processes of multicellular organisms [ 62 42 43 2+ 44 45 2.3. BMP Signalling Pathway The BMP family has been identified as comprising more than 20 members, and it is subdivided into seven subgroups based on sequence homology and biological functions. The BMP then interacts with its receptors to form a complex, which in turn regulates the expression of downstream genes through the canonical Smad and noncanonical Smad signalling pathways [ 63 64 46 MSX1 MSX2 FGFR2 47 BMP4 48 BMP2 BMP7 49 47 48 49 50 2.4. EGF Signalling Pathway The epidermal growth factor (EGF) family consists of up to 13 members. The principal members implicated in the process of repairing corneal epithelial injury are epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) [ 65 66 51 TSC-22 TSC-22 TSC-22 TSC-22 52 2.5. FGF Signalling Pathway The FGF family comprises 18 secreted proteins and four tyrosine kinase receptors. These are divided into seven subfamilies based on sequence homology and biochemical properties. FGF signalling has been demonstrated to be associated with development, metabolism, and disease [ 67 68 53 23 FGF-7 54 FGF20 55 3. Research Progress on the Characteristics of Poultry Feather Follicles The primary feather follicle traits of poultry include number, density and diameter. The development of the feather follicles is completed during the embryonic stage, after which the number is fixed and will not change [ 25 69 70 FOXM1 GTSE1 MELK CDK1 ECT2 NEK2 71 Wnt6 72 73 4. Research Progress in the Biotechnology of Poultry Feather Follicle Transcriptomics research into the development of poultry feather follicles focuses primarily on changes in gene expression within feather follicle cells and their effect on the formation, development and periodic growth of feather follicles [ 74 75 76 77 GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Study) research into the development of poultry feather follicles focuses primarily on identifying genetic markers that influence feather follicle traits. The aim is to provide a scientific basis for poultry breeding. GWAS is a method used to identify associations between complex traits and genetic variations. Adetula et al. conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genes associated with feather colouration. They found that the RAI14 78 MITF EDNRB2 79 80 81 82 83 Genetics is the science that studies genes, mainly focusing on the direct alterations of DNA sequences and their effects on gene activity or function. These alterations include point mutations, deletions, insertions, and translocations. In contrast, epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene activity or function, but these changes do not involve any alterations to the DNA sequence itself [ 84 85 86 87 5. Conclusions The development of feather follicles in poultry occurs during the embryonic stage, and the number of feather follicles is determined at this point. The morphological development of feather follicles in poultry is subject to regulation by the Wnt, SHH, EGF, FGF and BMP signalling pathways. These signalling pathways have been demonstrated to be involved in the developmental process of feather follicles at different stages of feather follicle development. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that the BMP signalling pathway exerts a regulatory effect on other signalling pathways, thereby exerting a partial inhibitory effect on feather follicle development. Feather follicle development is a complex process that affects the characteristics of feather follicles and the appearance of the carcass. In order to provide a theoretical basis for new interventions to improve the appearance of poultry carcasses and to promote their commercial marketing, it is necessary to further investigate the molecular regulatory mechanisms of feather follicle characteristics by combining transcriptomics, genomics and epigenomics.
