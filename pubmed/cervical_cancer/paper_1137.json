Objectives To evaluate the prevalence of previous and actual HPV infection and the clinical manifestations in unselected males. Materials and methods A total of 718 males participating to a surveillance program were asked to complete a study visit at our unit, including semen collection, balanopreputial sulcus swab, and blood collection for total anti‐HPV immunoglobulin G (IgG). When HPV‐DNA was detected, we performed HPV fluorescence in situ hybridization, oral and anal swab, and penoscopy. Because previous studies demonstrated a very high risk for HPV infection in subjects with history of HPV‐induced lesions, with a partner with diagnosed HPV infection or reporting couple infertility or sexual promiscuity and an increase of the risk in males having sex with males, in subjects with unprotected sexual intercourses or in heavy smokers, patients were therefore stratified according to the presence of these known risk factors (RFs). Results Actual HPV infection was detected in 401/718 subjects (55.85%). Oral HPV‐DNA was reported in 80 subjects and anal HPV infection in 52 subjects. Anti‐HPV IgG antibodies have been detected in 288 subjects. The overall prevalence of HPV exposition, considering actual and/or previous infection was 77.99%. Among infected men, high‐risk HPV genotypes were detected in 66.08%. A total of 514 subjects were considered as the RF population, while 150 were classified in the non‐RF population. There was a significantly higher prevalence of condylomatosis (odds ratio [OR] 4.07) and of seminal infection (OR 6.22) in the RF group. Discussion and conclusion These data represent an alert for the healthcare system to perform informative and screening campaigns for HPV infection in males and to promote HPV vaccination both in young people and for adult males with RF for HPV infections.

There are an estimated 6.2 million new instances of HPV infection each year, making it the most common sexual transmitted infections (STI) globally.  1  2  3 HPV can be classified into two types based on their carcinogenic potential: low‐risk (LR‐HPV) and high‐risk (HR‐HPV). Plantar, flat, or cutaneous warts are thought to be caused by LR‐HPV subtypes.  4  5  6  7 HR‐HPV subtypes include 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82.  8  9 In addition, types 26, 53, 66, and 69 have been reported by Muñoz et al.  8  10 The IARC has stated that there is compelling evidence that HPV is a factor in the development of cancers in the cervix uteri, penis, vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx.  11  12 Although previously, research on HPV‐related illnesses has primarily focused on females, there has been a recent surge in interest in HPV infection in males.  13  14  15  13  16  17  13  17 Moreover, it has now been conclusively shown that HPV virions can also be found inside the male reproductive tract, in addition to the well‐known exterior genital sites. Semen has been found to contain HPV‐DNA in both exfoliated cells and spermatozoa.  18  19  18  20  21  22  23  24 Starting from these premises, preventative HPV vaccinations are a vital weapon in the fight against infections, warts, and cancers brought on by the most common varieties of these viruses. Adolescent girls between the ages of 9 and 14 should have an HPV vaccination, according to vaccination programs implemented in several countries. In certain cases, boys should also receive this vaccination. Adult immunization is also taken into consideration by the programs, especially for those with various immunodeficiencies. Since 2015, HPV vaccination is proposed for free in Italy for young males and females at the age of 11 years. HPV vaccination has been moreover proposed as an adjuvant treatment in infertile patients with HPV infection, because it enhances HPV healing in semen cells and increases rate of natural pregnancies and live births.  25 The current study's aim was to evaluate the prevalence of previous and actual HPV infection and the related clinical manifestations in a population of unselected males and their relations with risk factors (RFs) for HPV. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Participants From January 1, 2022 until June 30, 2023, we conducted an andrological surveillance program in young and adult males, to inform, assess and reduce andrological RFs for each specific range of age, including HPV infection. The campaigned achieved sampling 1600 males. We proposed to the participants to be enrolled in a screening protocol about HPV infection and 718 males, aged 16–45‐year old, agreed to be enrolled for this study, including 70 young subjects aged 16–20 years and 648 adult subjects aged 21–45 years. Having a malignancy was the only exclusion criterion. Eleven subjects had completed HPV vaccination. Participants were asked to complete a study visit at our Unit, including semen collection, balanopreputial sulcus swab, and blood collection to measure serum total anti‐HPV immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and determine titers. All participants filled a questionnaire about demographic characteristics, medical history, lifestyle, and sexual habits, evaluating in details previous history of penile lesions, history of infection in the partner, history of infertility, smoking, sexual activity with men, casual sexual activity without use of condom, and history of sexual promiscuity (more than three sexual partners in the last month). Balanopreputial sulcus swab and semen collection by masturbation were analyzed for HPV detection and genotyping. A peripheral blood sample for anti‐HPV antibodies assay was collected in all subjects. When HPV‐DNA was detected in semen or balanopreputial sulcus swab, we performed HPV fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for HPV, oral and anal swab, and penoscopy. Written informed permission was acquired by each subject. The Institutional Review Board gave their approval to the study protocol. 2.2 HPV detection and genotyping HPV‐DNA detection and genotyping were performed on balanopreputial sulcus swab (Copan Italia S.p.A.) and in semen samples by INNO‐LiPA Genotyping Extra assay, permitting the identification of the HPV types: 6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 69, 71, 70, 73, 74, and 82. HPV subtypes 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68, 73, and 82 have been considered as HR‐HPV. HPV genotypes 26, 53, 66, and 69 have been considered as at intermediate risk. The remaining genotypes have been considered as LR‐HPV. 2.3 Anti‐HPV antibodies Using a commercial kit provided by DRG Diagnostic GmbH, the detection and titer of serum total anti‐HPV IgG were evaluated on serum samples from peripheral blood taken from all patients, as previously described.  24 2.4 HPV fluorescence in situ hybridization Percoll gradient centrifugation was used to separate the sperm cells from the native semen samples, and sterile phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) was used for the three rounds of washing. FISH for HPV in spermatozoa was carried out as previously mentioned.  20 2.5 Penoscopy After applying 3% acetic acid to the selected group of patients, a skilled research physician used a colposcope (magnification factor: ×0.6–1.6; Zeiss) to perform a penoscopy. Digital photos were used to document penile lesions, which were classed as flat penile lesions or condylomatosis acuminata. 2.6 Stratification for the presence of risk factors Previous studies demonstrated a very high risk for HPV infection in subjects with history of HPV‐induced lesions (odds ratio [OR] 17.9),  18  18  18  26  27  26  28 According to these previous data, we aimed to verify how the presence of previously reported RFs in the history of patients may modify the risk of HPV infections and the prevalence of the clinical manifestations. We therefore divided the study group based on the presence of known RFs for HPV infection, as reported in Table 1 TABLE 1 Classification for risk factors according to previous evidences.  Group A History of genital warts Partner with HPV infection Infertility Sexual promiscuity  Group B MSM population Unprotected intercourses Heavy smoking Abbreviations: HPV, human papillomavirus; MSM, males having sex with males. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 2.7 Statistical analysis Patients were stratified in groups according to the age (<20 years vs. ≥20 years) and the presence of known RFs for HPV infection. Chi‐square test was used to compare the prevalence of HPV infection or exposition among the studied groups. Statistical significance was assumed if p 3 RESULTS Mean ± SD age of the studied population was 34.28 ± 9.69 years. HPV has been detected in semen in 400/718 (55.71%) subjects and in balanopreputial sulcus in 401 subjects (55.85%). In particular, the concordance between semen and balanopreputial sulcus swab was >99%, as concordance was missing only in 1/401 patients (positivity at balanopreputial sulcus and negativity in the semen). Oral HPV‐DNA was reported in 80/401 (20%) subjects and anal HPV infection in 52/401 (13%) subjects with HPV infection in semen and balanopreputial sulcus swab. Anti‐HPV IgG antibodies have been detected in 288 subjects (40.1%), including 129 subjects with HPV‐DNA detection (129/401, 32.2%) and 159 subjects without current infection (159/317, 50.2%). Penile lesions at penoscopy were observed in 14.5% (104/718) of the total population. In all patients with penile lesions HPV‐DNA was detected in semen and/or balanopreputial sulcus swab; in 17 patients with penile lesions we reported the presence of anti‐HPV antibodies. The overall prevalence of HPV infection, considering actual (HPV‐DNA and/or penile lesions) and/or previous (presence of anti‐HPV IgG antibodies) infection, was therefore 77.99% (560/718), as reported in Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) current or previous infection in the studied population. Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Relative prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV)‐DNA, anti‐HPV antibodies (Ab) and penile lesions in the studied populations. Among infected men, HR‐HPV genotypes were detected in 265/401 subjects (66.08%). Forty‐four subjects (10.97%) had genotypes associated with intermediate risk, while 22.94% had LR HPV.

Among subjects with current infection (RF n n p p p We finally divided the study population according to the age. In details, we analyzed data from 70 young males, 32 in the FR group and 38 in the non‐FR group. Only 11 subjects had completed HPV vaccination (15.7%): seven subjects in the FR group (21.8%) and four in the non‐FR group. All vaccinated subjects developed anti‐HPV antibodies and HPV‐DNA was not identified in any of these subjects. When considering unvaccinated subjects, as reported in Figure 3 FIGURE 3 Prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the cohort of young males (16–20‐year old) and in the group of adult males (20–45‐year old) with and without risk factors (RFs) for HPV infection. 4 DISCUSSION Many viruses can infect the male reproductive tract, with potential adverse consequences to male reproductive health, including infertility and cancer.  29  30 Epidemiologic information on genital HPV infection, especially in the male population, is sparse because most infections are subclinical. Previous epidemiologic studies performed in US in women demonstrated that 1% of women have genital warts. In another study about 33% of women had HPV infection detectable by PAP smears,  31  32  33 Few studies have been performed to evaluate the overall prevalence of HPV infection and exposition in male. There is a wide range of reported prevalence of genital HPV‐DNA in men (≥20% in most studies), ranging from 1.3% to 72.9%. The most likely causes of these differences include variations in the populations examined, in the sampling sites, in the detection strategies employed, and in the sampling methodologies. The estimate of HPV prevalence has increased recently due to the use of more sensitive sampling methods and to sample collection from a larger number of anatomic locations. More than 60% of men tested positive for at least one HPV genotype, according to an international survey.  34  35 We confirmed the alarming data about the high prevalence of actual HPV infection in 55.85%, of the male population, when HPV‐DNA is searched in semen and on balanopreputial sulcus swab. It means that one out two healthy men in the general population has an active HPV infection. The prevalence of penile lesions has been reported in about 15% of the population, using penoscopy. It is a widely used diagnostic procedure in clinical practice for screening HPV lesions. It is relevant, but not conclusive diagnostic tool.  36  36  37 After considering the seroprevalence for HPV, we can affirm that 78% of an unselected male population had entered in contact with HPV. HR‐HPV genotypes have been reported in about 66% of the patients with active infection, underlining that these subjects (and their partners) are at risk of carcinogenesis. Important oncogenes for HPV carcinogenesis, HPV E6 and E7 are in fact frequently found in conjunction with HR‐HPV types.  38  39  40 Within the basal epithelium, HPV begins the cellular sabotage phase by reprogramming the host cell machinery to continue replication; the next step is characterized by the release of HPV from terminally differentiated cells that detach from the epithelial surface.  41  42 Starting from these physiopathological premises about the role of HR‐HPV genotypes in carcinogenesis and considering the high prevalence of HR‐HPV infection reported by these data, the urgency of creating and executing a comprehensive, coordinated, and gender‐neutral international strategy to eradicate HPV‐related diseases in Europe through widespread vaccination and youth education campaigns is thus called into question. Furthermore, when stratifying patients according to their belonging to the group with RFs for HPV infection, the prevalence of HPV infection arises to 63%. Patients with RFs have more frequently condylomatosis and particularly seminal infection, which has been previously demonstrated to be associated with infertility and frequent miscarriages. Finally, the high prevalence of HPV infection is observed from a young age (16–20‐year old) and no differences in the prevalence of HPV actual or previous infection has been observed in the group of young people when compared with adults, with or without RFs, thus confirming the importance of early vaccination of young people for HPV infection. 5 CONCLUSIONS Despite the limits of the study, performed on unselected male subjects involved in an andrological surveillance program based on a voluntary basis, thus characterized by the absence of specific information, such as data about foreskin status, seminal status, and follow‐up at penile lesion biopsy, all these data, taken together, represent an alert for the healthcare system to perform screening campaigns for HPV infection in males, to promote informative campaigns about HPV‐associated diseases, HPV‐associated RFs, and correct lifestyles, to promote HPV vaccination in young people, and to internationally extend HPV vaccination including adult males with RF for HPV infections.
