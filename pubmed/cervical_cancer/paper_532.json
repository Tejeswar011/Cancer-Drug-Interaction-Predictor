In light of a surge of research conducted in Black diasporic communities since the 2020 killing of George Floyd, the symposium sought to enhance the quality and impact of research involving Black Canadians. We contend that by broadening the interpretation and application of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice, researchers will conduct impactful and transformative research projects that foster health equity. We emphasize the importance of not limiting the core principle of respect for persons to individual participants but to extend it to communities throughout the research process. Furthermore, we suggest that researchers can deepen their commitment to the core principle of beneficence or concern for welfare and design relevant and empowering research projects through meaningful community involvement. We highlight that to further the implementation of the core principle of justice, scholars should adopt a human development approach and mobilize innovative outreach recruitment strategies to ensure that Black communities have the opportunity to participate in biomedical and public health research while also benefiting from the knowledge produced. anti‐Black racism Black communities community‐based research health equity institutional review board (IRB) biomedical research public health research research ethics Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection 10.13039/100021638 Robarts Centre for Canadian Studies York University LA&PS Research Events Funds pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September–October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.09.2025  Jean‐Pierre J. T. Collins K. Agnant A. Boatswain‐Kyte C. Herman T. Mathews B. Salami C. E. James Broadening Core Research Ethics Principles: Insights from Research Conducted with Black Communities Ethics & Human Research 47 5 2025 2 12 10.1002/eahr.60011 41014545 There are three core principles that inform research ethics committees when they review research protocols. These principles are respect for persons, concern for welfare or beneficence, and justice. In Canada, these principles are enshrined in the Canadian Tri‐Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research with Humans —  1  2  3 We observed a surge in research endeavors concerning race and Black communities following the deaths during police intervention of Black Canadians D'Andre Campbell in April of 2020 and Regis Korchinski‐Paquet in May of 2020, which occurred in temporal proximity to the death of George Floyd in May of 2020 in the United States. This symposium aimed to consolidate and expand the state of knowledge on conducting ethical research with Black populations. The panel discussed in this article convened health experts working with Black communities across various regions of Canada, employing diverse methodological approaches to offer insights and guidance on conducting health research that promotes equity and community development. This discussion featured contributions from panelists and coauthors of this article, Cameron Herman, Bukola Salami, Alicia Boatswain‐Kyte, and Tanya Matthews, whose research interests span food insecurity, nursing and public health, clinical social work and health disparities, and speech pathology studies, respectively. The panelists’ contributions constitute the foundation of this article as they expand our understandings of core research ethics principles through concrete examples derived from their own prior and ongoing research projects. The panel proceedings provide an occasion to interpret and apply core research ethics principles in ways that promote equitable practices during the design, conduct, and dissemination of health research conducted across various Black communities. While the examples discussed are context‐specific, the expanded interpretation of core research ethics principles that we propose can be adapted across various national and regional contexts. Prior to delving into their insights as they relate to the core principles of ethical research, we provide a brief overview of the historical harms inflicted on historically marginalized communities and emphasize the need for heightened attention and ongoing reflection on ethical research practices. HISTORICAL LEGACY OF UNETHICAL RESEARCH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CORE RESEARCH ETHICS PRINCIPLES All human beings belong to one human race, however, race, as a social construct, emerged through historical and political processes. As such, racism must be critically examined in research due to its profound material and symbolic consequences, particularly as a social determinant of health that disproportionately harms marginalized and racially minoritized groups such as Black communities.  4  Health scholars are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the history of the Black communities studied, to develop relationships with these communities, and adapt their interpretation of core research ethics principles by taking into account their national and regional contexts. The historical legacy of harmful research contributed to the development of the core principles of research ethics as we know them today. Unfortunately, racism has influenced the course of biomedical research and led to human rights violations. During World War II, physicians and scientists working for the Nazi regime injured and murdered concentration camp prisoners, notably Jewish prisoners and children while conducting unethical medical experiments.  5  6  7 Before World War II, in 1932, the Tuskegee experiment was initiated in Tuskegee, Alabama, with 600 African‐American men, 399 of which had syphilis.  8  9 The Belmont Report The Belmont Report  10 It is important to note that other less known historical events influence the relationship of Black people with biomedical and public health research.  11  12  13  14  15  16  17 In addition to the history of unethical health research, contemporary health disparities and experiences of racial discrimination in health care services fuel the distrust and apprehension of many Black people toward health research and systems in Canada, the U.S., and globally.  18  19  20 RESPECT FOR PERSONS AND COMMUNITIES The first core ethics principle involves obtaining an individual's free, informed, and ongoing consent prior to the use of their data or biological material or prior to their direct participation in a research project. This principle upholds accountability and transparency about the research process while respecting the individual's autonomy and judgment.  21  22 During the symposium, several panelists suggested that respect for communities include an examination of the theoretical concepts used to investigate health in Black populations. Theory influences the research project because it informs the research questions asked, the research design selected, the process of data collection, data analysis, and dissemination. We recognize that reframing theoretical frameworks can be a challenge, especially when funding agencies often launch grant competitions about topics that center individual behaviors rather than structural and social determinants of health.  23  24  25  26 As it is essential to examine the structural inequities in health systems that contribute to gaps between policies and practices,  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39 CONCERN FOR WELFARE AND BENEFICENCE THROUGH COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT Concern for welfare, also known as beneficence, refers to the obligation of researchers to uphold the welfare of participants, to minimize participants’ exposure to potential risks and harm throughout the research process, and to inform participants about the potential risks and benefits of their involvement.  40 To uphold the principle of concern for welfare, it is wise to involve the community in the early stages of a research project to minimize risks and optimize the benefits of the research project. Panelists highlighted that before engaging community members, it is important to build relationships to establish trust. This observation coincides with conclusions made by numerous scholars who have conducted research with Black populations who highlight the necessity of taking time to build relationships and trust throughout the research process.  41  42  43  44 Matthews emphasized the importance of teaching cultural humility to future health practitioners and researchers that involves a focus on developing openness and humility in the face of constantly changing cultures while avoiding the essentialization of groups’ cultural practices. As Lekas and colleagues point out, “Cultural humility refers to an orientation towards caring  45  46  47 Health researchers can also teach their students how they can incorporate community involvement while fostering cultural humility when they conduct research to produce benefits for participants’ communities during the research process. For instance, asking one or several community groups to provide input regarding the direction of a research project increases the likelihood that the process and the outputs of an inquiry will be beneficial for the communities concerned, and instrumental for health equity. Students learning to engage with communities in this manner can develop essential skills in communication, empathy, and reciprocity. They gain firsthand experience in conducting research that is not only scientifically rigorous but socially and ethically responsible, while strengthening fair and meaningful distribution of research benefits. This collaborative approach not only enhances the relevance and applicability of the research but also promotes mutual respect and trust between researchers and community members.  48 Another way to uphold beneficence mentioned by the members of the panel was the importance of building capacity among Black postsecondary students and community members to conduct research throughout the different phases of an inquiry. For instance, during a participatory‐action research project, Salami trained Black youth to partake in the different phases of the research project and to broaden their knowledge about mental health.  49  50 JUSTICE THROUGH INNOVATIVE OUTREACH TO PROMOTE PARTICIPATION The principle of justice refers to the obligation to give a chance to all to partake in research while treating each individual fairly and equitably without overburdening a group with harm or denying a group the benefit of the knowledge generated from inquiries.  51  52  53  54 During the panel discussion, it became apparent that when we recruit participants in Black diasporas, intersectionality is important to gather different sense‐making processes, cultural repertoires and lived experiences across linguistic lines. For instance, in an officially bilingual country such as Canada, to ensure that everyone has the possibility of engaging in health research, it is important to strive to recruit participants from both linguistic groups. For instance, during a research project in Quebec, outreach efforts were made to bring across linguistic lines English‐speaking and French‐speaking partners and participants to reflect the needs and expectations of Black communities.  55  56  57  58 Scholars may resort to creative and relational ways of connecting with prospective participants to ensure that Black communities are not overlooked and benefit from the knowledge produced in health research. To this point, Matthews discussed how Black children and youth are underrepresented or absent in speech pathology studies. As a result, some Black children and youth can be misdiagnosed with some assessment instruments. To address this gap in the Canadian context, Matthews organized workshops in Montreal where she presented information about her area of research while serving free culturally relevant food and providing free childcare services to young Black mothers and their children. During the workshop, Matthews introduced herself, her expertise, and the relevance of her research for the well‐being of Black children. At the end of the workshop, she was able to recruit prospective participants for her study about speech development in Black families. At that point, the attendees had grasped the relevance and the benefits of her research project and expressed interest in participating. This example shows how initiatives that allow prospective participants to better know the researchers and the pertinence of the research project are crucial to give a chance to all to participate. Justice with a human development approach is attainable when relevant research projects inform governmental and other stakeholders’ policy decision‐making but also advance the goals and practices of community groups and organizations that work closely with Black populations and other minoritized groups. Boatswain‐Kyte discussed how as part of a research team conducting community participatory‐action research, she witnessed that several participants expressed a desire to have access to the data collected to achieve their own goals.  59  60 CONCLUSION The insights from Black scholars during a symposium panel provided the opportunity to grow our understanding of how health research can contribute to Black communities thriving, flourishing, and rejoicing, and not simply surviving. The guidance provided by these researchers points to the significance of respecting individuals and communities, of fulfilling beneficence by tapping into community involvement, and of embracing justice with a human development approach by engaging in innovative outreach to benefit Black diasporic populations in a meaningful way. By doing so, this article proposes to expand the interpretation of the core principles of research ethics when health researchers work with Black people and other historically minoritized communities. Health scholars are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the history of the Black communities studied, to develop relationships with these communities, and adapt their interpretation of core research ethics principles by taking into account their national and regional contexts. Nevertheless, these principles are not static; they require continuous reflection and adaptation to ensure that research practices remain relevant and just. By tending to this reflection, acknowledging and addressing structural inequities, and fostering meaningful community involvement, health researchers can contribute to the safety, healing, and empowerment of disenfranchised communities, creating favorable conditions for equitable health research. As behavioral, biomedical, and public health research with a focus on racialization and Black populations continues to grow,  61 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This article draws on a symposium entitled “Designing a Flourishing Future and Researching with Black Communities in Canada” held on November 20, 2023, at York University, and was supported by a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Connection grant, a Robarts Centre for Canadian Studies grant, and a York University LA&PS Research Events Funds grant.
