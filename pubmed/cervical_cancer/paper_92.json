SUMMARY Tumor invasion of carotid arteries (CA) is found in 2%-7% of patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). There are no standardized criteria to evaluate the invasion. Tumor invasion of CA is assessed by using computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging. Ultrasound was also used but the method has not become daily routine. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of tumor invasion on CA dynamics and to evaluate the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of invasion. The study was conducted on two groups of 22 patients each. The first group consisted of patients with confirmed HNC and CA infiltration, while the second group consisted of patients without any data of HNC. Motion of the CA wall was assessed using ultrasound from which a CA was segmented and then the amount of motion was assessed by optical flow calculation. All patients with a CT-verified CA infiltration had an altered CA motion. The research showed that tumor-infiltrated CA had an altered dynamic when viewed on ultrasound.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of HNCs. We hypothesized that weakened movement or lack of CA movement could suggest its invasion. Because no standardized and validated criteria exist, assessment of CA invasion is still challenging and not reliable enough. Material and Methods Study design We performed a case-control study that included 44 patients who were treated at the Osijek University Hospital Center from July 2020 to May 2022. The patients were divided into 2 groups. The first group consisted of 22 patients with confirmed malignant disease of the head and neck. The second group was a control group with 22 patients without clinically and diagnostically evident malignant head and neck disease. All patients were informed about the research and signed informed consent forms. Patient data were deidentified before analysis. The research was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Osijek University Hospital Center and Faculty of Medicine, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek. The inclusion criteria for patients in the first group were as follows: primary, nonrecurrent HNC without previous radiation therapy or chemotherapy; metastases in cervical lymph nodes confirmed by fine needle aspiration; and preoperative non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT of the neck where an HNC, metastatically altered lymph node of the neck, and CA infiltration was described. The inclusion criteria for patients in the second group required they had no clinically and diagnostically obvious malignant tumor of the head and neck; and referral to neck CT scan for any reason other than HNC. Measurements were performed by two independent investigators. Baseline demographic data Basic demographic data such as age and gender, as well as medical history and radiologic and cytologic findings, were collected. All patients underwent an ultrasound examination of the neck, focusing on their carotid arteries and metastatic lymph nodes. Ultrasound protocol A linear probe with a frequency of 9 MHz (a Logiq E9 device) was used for ultrasound imaging of the CA and metastatic lymph node with a short video recording. Patients were in supine position during the examination, with their neck extended and head laterally rotated opposite to the side of the neck being examined. Axial slices in B mode were made. Both sides of the neck were examined to identify malignantly altered lymph nodes that had been defined based on predictive ultrasonic criteria, as follows: a round shape, irregular edges, hypoechoic or heterogeneous interior, absence of the central hilus, and peripheral nodal vascularity26-31. Then, the CA wall motion next to the metastatic lymph node was monitored, and a video recording was made. Whether the motion of the CA wall had altered (i.e., reduced or absent wall movement) was assessed. In the case of altered wall movement, the percentage of the wall with reduced or absent motion was estimated. Image analysis Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine data obtained with an ultrasound procedure must first be preprocessed. Each video has a defined size of 250 images. The data preprocess includes trimming the input data. The input images obtained by ultrasound devices often contain other information embedded in images (e.g., date, device information, and image scale) that must be removed because it might skew the optical flow calculation. Following this step, manual segmentation was done using the open-source 3D Slicer (version 4.11) segmentation software. The segmentation was done manually by a radiologist, segmenting the regions of interest, in this case, the CA. A blurring step was performed on the given input image series because they contained high-frequency noise that negatively affects the optical flow calculation. Blurring was also performed on the segmentations to provide smoother transitions between individual frames and to remove the outliers in the data because the segmentations are done manually. The input image series was blurred using a gaussian filter, with the kernel size being 2% of the input image diagonal, whereas the segmentations were blurred using a median filter with the same size. Image stabilization was done in such a way that the area around the vessel segmentation remained mostly static as the movement of the vessel area through the surrounding tissue was observed. Image stabilization was performed by extracting the features in 2 consecutive frames ( 32 The motion was estimated by tracking the extracted features using the Lucas-Kanade optical flow ( 33 From the vessel segmentation, we extracted the region of interest using dilation and erosion filters with the size corresponding to 1% of the image diagonal. Therefore, this region of interest corresponded to the area around the outline of the vessel, spanning both inwards and outwards. Another reference mask was computed from the segmentation by dilating it for 10% of the image diagonal. The metric used to determine whether a pixel was under the influence of tumor infiltration was the length of the optical flow vector for each pixel in the image series. The optical flow vectors were computed per 34 In addition, the regions of the artery wall that were or were not infiltrated were graphically indicated within the data. The analysis was done via 35 36 Statistical analysis Categorical data were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies. Difference in category variables was tested by the Fisher exact test. The normality of numerical variable distribution was tested with the Shapiro-Wilk test, and due to non-normal distribution, data were described by median and interquartile range. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to test differences in continuous variables between the control group and the malignant head and neck tumor group (Hodges-Lehman difference of the median, with a 95% confidence interval (CI)). The Wilcoxon test (Hodges-Lehman difference between medians, with a 95% CI) was used to test differences in continuous variables according to groups (ultrasound combined with optical flow vs Results The research was conducted on 44 patients, of which 22 (50%) were in the control group. Of the 44 patients, 35 (79%) were male and 9 (21%) were female, with no significant difference between the groups. All 22 patients with HNC had an infiltrated CA on CT ( Fig. 1 vs Table 1 Fig. 2 Table 2 Fig. 1 Contrast enhanced computed tomography scans of neck cancers showing extensive lymphadenopathy and carotid artery invasion: (a) axial view; (b) coronal view; (c) sagittal view.

Information about the existence of tumor invasion of CA in HNC patients is very important for deciding on the choice of treatment and prognosis. Studies have examined morphological characteristics of the CA wall and the relationship between the CA wall and the surrounding structures ( 22 27 24 28 31 24 29 et al 36 37 All CAs described as infiltrated on CT were also marked as dynamically altered on ultrasound. Some arteries moved less than the non-infiltrated arteries. Our study showed that reduced or absent movement of a CA wall next to the metastatically altered lymph node detected by ultrasound indicated tumor invasion. Our study showed that ultrasound could be useful for assessing CA wall invasion in HNC patients. Considering the subjectivity of ultrasound examination, additional quantification was made. No significant differences were observed even when, for quantification purposes, an optical flow calculation was made on ultrasonic images. The amount of CA movement, assessed by optical flow, also indicated that a segment described as infiltrated on CT and ultrasound images had less movement than the non-infiltrated segment. No significant difference was seen between the assessment of the percentage of infiltrated CA wall by optical flow calculation and the radiologist’s assessment. Considering our results, ultrasound can be considered a reliable method for the assessment of CA invasion, complementary to CT. A positive correlation exists between 3 or more image criteria for artery wall infiltration on a CT and an ultrasonically detected weakened or absent wall movement when assessing CA tumor invasion. The radiologist described appropriate movement of the CA on ultrasound in all control group patients. There were no segments with altered dynamics. Assessment of the amount of movement by calculating optical flow on ultrasound images showed a reduced amount of CA movement in 17 of 22 patients. The percentage of reduced movement was 1%-9%. The reason could be that most of the control group patients were referred to the ultrasound imaging because of arteriosclerotic alterations of CA that contributed to an increased wall rigidity (i.e., contributed to a reduced movement of the CA wall) ( 38 This study had several limitations. It was a retrospective study conducted at a single center. All HNC patients underwent postoperative histopathologic tumor analysis but CA in terms of tumor invasion had not been analyzed. Therefore, we used the most available reference method of visualization, i.e., CT. The next limitation was the small number of patients because of a relatively low incidence of CA infiltration from a metastatic lymph node. The possibility of bias existed, considering there is no standardized criterium for evaluating CA infiltration. We used optical flow on ultrasound images to overcome the subjectivity of ultrasound. Conclusion Improving radiological methods in assessing a disease enables better choice of therapy and better prognosis for the patient. Our study provides new insights into the CA dynamics and the possibility of ultrasound application in the assessment of CA wall tumor invasion. The research showed the tumor-infiltrated CAs to have an altered dynamics. The movement of CA wall was either weakened or absent. Ultrasound is a method by which we can analyze the dynamics of arteries in real time and reach an accurate diagnosis in a faster and simpler way. Considering the rarity of this disease, a multicenter study on a larger sample is needed to verify ultrasound as a complementary method for assessing CA invasion.
