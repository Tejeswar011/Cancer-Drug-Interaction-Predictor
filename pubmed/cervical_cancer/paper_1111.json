Rarely, it can co‐exist with acute abdominal conditions, which can further complicate the diagnosis and management. Delay in diagnosis and the presence of comorbidities may result in unfavorable outcomes. We present a case of a 55‐year‐old male diagnosed with a spinal epidural abscess presenting as low back pain, fever, and paraparesis. This case report aims to investigate the clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, and treatment approaches for spinal epidural abscesses in low and middle‐income countries. case report epidural space intestinal obstruction Pott's spine spinal epidural abscess pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:28.09.2025  S.

There was no associated limb numbness, weakness, or sphincter dysfunction. The patient was admitted locally and treated with analgesics and bed rest. However, he started to develop a fever with chills. He was noted to have a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 50 mm/h (0–15 mm/h) and C‐reactive protein (CRP) of 310 mg/L (< 30 mg/L) on initial lab tests. His total leucocyte count level was revealed to be 16,300 cells/mm 3 3 1 FIGURE 1 Magnetic resonance imaging T2 weighted sagittal (A) and coronal (B) sections of dorsolumbar spine showing T2 hyperintense lesion of L1 vertebra. No intracanalicular lesion was identified. 3 Differential Diagnosis, Investigations and Treatment The patient's geographical location, clinical presentation (chronic low back pain with systemic features, including fever with chills), markedly elevated inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP), and leukocytosis were noted. Additionally, a classical imaging pattern was suggestive of spinal tuberculosis; hence, a provisional diagnosis of Pott's spine was made, and empiric anti‐tubercular therapy (ATT) was initiated while awaiting further diagnostic confirmation. On the 12th day of admission, the patient developed paraparesis and decreased sensation associated with progressive constipation and multiple episodes of vomiting. The patient was then referred to our center for further management. On an abdominal examination at our center, he had abdominal distention with absent bowel sounds. Neurological examination revealed a power of 0/5 on Medical Research Council grading with decreased sensation to touch and pain below the D10 spinal level. An X‐ray of the abdomen was done, which showed distended bowel loops (Figure 2 FIGURE 2 X‐ray abdomen anteroposterior view (A) and lateral view (B) showing distended bowel loops. The patient improved his bowel symptoms from conservative treatment over the next 24 h. As the previous MRI failed to explain the current neurological deficit, a new MRI of the dorsolumbar spine was obtained. The scans showed a T1 low and T2/STIR high signal characteristics lesion in the D8 and D9 vertebrae and L1 vertebra, along with an elongated area of peripherally enhancing altered signal intensity lesion in the anterior epidural space extending from C7 to L1 vertebral level, with a similar lesion in the posterior epidural space from D4 to D6 and D12 to L1 levels. The spinal cord was extremely thinned out from D7 to D9 level. A diagnosis of an epidural abscess was made (Figure 3 FIGURE 3 An MRI of the dorsolumbar spine showed an elongated area of peripherally enhancing altered signal intensity lesion in epidural space extending from D9 to L2 levels. 4 Conclusion and Results The patient tolerated the surgery well and was eventually transferred to the neurosurgical ward on the 7th postoperative day.

Patients with SEA often present with non‐specific symptoms that include back pain, fever, motor weakness, sensory abnormalities, and bowel/bladder dysfunction [ 1 2 3 1 2 3 7 8 9 10 11 2 3 12 13 5 2 12 13 14 TABLE 1 Stages of SEA according to the clinical symptoms' progression (adapted from Heusner et al. [ 7 8 Stages Symptoms Stage 1 Aching pain at affected level of spine, fever, localized tenderness over spine Stage 2 Nerve root pain, headache, neck stiffness, depressed deep tendon reflexes (DTRs) if lesion overlies cauda equina or heightening of DTRs if it is over spinal cord Stage 3 Motor weakness, bowel and bladder dysfunction, sensory abnormalities such as ascending numbness Stage 4 Complete paralysis This case is unique as the patient presented with two acute conditions: long‐segment spinal epidural abscess and acute intestinal obstruction. An extensive search of the literature yielded several cases to date where spinal epidural abscess mimicked an abdominal pathology. Bremer et al. reported a case of spinal epidural abscess who initially presented with symptoms suggesting an intra‐abdominal pathology [ 9 9 13 14 15 2 TABLE 2 Cases where spinal epidural abscess presented as an intra‐abdominal pathology.

[ 17 13‐year‐old/female None reported Acute abdomen suspected complicated appendicitis The SEA can present with abdominal symptoms such as bowel obstruction due to the complex interplay of neurological and inflammatory processes. The mechanism linking SEA to abdominal symptoms involves several factors: radicular pain and referred symptoms [ 13 18 13 18 19 Most of the patients with SEA tend to have multiple predisposing factors [ 3 1 10 11 12 20  S. aureus 1 2 3 4 5 10 12 20  S. aureus 20 Gadolinium‐enhanced MRI remains the imaging method of choice [ 2 3 14 16 3 1 20 12 11 SEA is an uncommon and potentially life‐threatening condition requiring early diagnosis and prompt treatment. Coexistence with acute intestinal obstruction is extremely rare. Delays in diagnosis and the presence of comorbidities can result in unfavorable outcomes, such as in our case.
