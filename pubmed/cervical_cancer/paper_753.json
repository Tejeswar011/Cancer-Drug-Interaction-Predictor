Among the various factors involved, oxidative stress resulting from the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a key driver of stem cell senescence. In an oxidative environment, cells continuously generate ROS, which accelerates cellular senescence and leads to functional deterioration. To intervene in the cellular senescence process of stem cells under such conditions, we selected bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) as the model system and developed ROS-responsive selenium (Se)-containing nano-micelles capable of efficiently scavenging intracellular ROS. The optimal formulation was determined by modulating the selenium content. Analysis of cellular senescence markers and regenerative capacity reveals that nano-micelles containing 8% Se (Wt %), at a concentration of 15 μg/mL, can significantly modulate ROS levels in BMSCs under oxidative stress, thereby effectively delaying cellular senescence and preserving the osteogenic differentiation potential of BMSCs. These findings offer a promising strategy for mitigating stem cell senescence. selenium-containing nano-micelles reactive oxygen species bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells cellular senescence Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader 22XD1433900 National Natural Science Foundation of China 32271401 National Key Research and Development Program of China 2022YFC2405702 Basic Science Center Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China T2288102 This research was funded by Program of Shanghai Academic/Technology Research Leader, grant number 22XD1433900; National Natural Science Foundation of China grant number No.32271401); National Key Research and Development Program of China, grant number 2022YFC2405702; the Basic Science Center Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number T2288102. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report in 2022, the proportion of the global population aged 60 and over is projected to reach 22% by 2050. Age-related impairments in tissue regeneration have emerged as a significant medical challenge, posing serious threats to the health and quality of life of elderly individuals [ 1 2 3 4 5 Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the senescent microenvironment is a key driver of stem cells senescence [ 6 7 3 8 8 9 10 11 12 Existing studies have demonstrated that modulating ROS levels and enhancing antioxidant capacity can effectively maintain physiological homeostasis. Currently, major research efforts in antioxidant-based therapeutic strategies focus on small molecule drugs, nano-enzymes that mimic the activity of natural antioxidant enzymes, and functional materials containing ROS-responsive moieties. Specifically, commonly investigated small molecule drugs include N-acetylcysteine (NAC), NAD + 13 14 15 16 17 18 2 3 2 x 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 In this study, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) exposed to an oxidative environment were employed as the experimental model. Based on selenium (Se), an essential trace element in the human body, an amphiphilic selenium-containing polymer was synthesized [ 27 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Synthesis of mPEG-b-P(TMC-co-MSeSe) Polymer The polymerization was conducted under an argon atmosphere using a schlenk line. A diethylene disselenate carbonate dimer (MSeSe) was synthesized according to previous work [ 28 5000 b co Table 1 2.2.

Cell Culture in an Oxidative Microenvironment All experimental animal operating procedures and animal care protocols have been approved by the East China University of Science and Technology (No.: ECUST-2024-048). One-month-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were euthanized via cervical dislocation and subsequently immersed in alcohol for disinfection over a 15 min period. BMSCs were then isolated from the femurs of the rats. The primary BMSCs were cultured and expanded to the third passage in complete medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Subsequently, the cells were induced with aMEM containing 50 μM H 2 2 2 2 2.4. Detection of Cell Proliferation After BMSCs were co-cultured with the nano-micelles, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer to ensure complete removal of residual culture medium. Subsequently, Alamar Blue working solution was added, and the samples were incubated in the dark for 2 h. Following incubation, the working solution was collected from each well and transferred to a black plate. Fluorescence intensity was then measured at Ex = 520 nm and Em = 590 nm. 2.5.

Detection of ALP Activity in BMSCs Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was detected after BMSCs were co-cultured with osteogenic induction medium and micelles for 14 days. The co-culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed 2–3 times with PBS buffer to ensure complete removal of residual liquid after each wash. Subsequently, 100 μL of NP-40 cell lysis buffer was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to achieve complete cell lysis. The ALP detection working solution was prepared in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (China, Beyotime, P0321), ensuring full dissolution and thorough mixing, and was kept on ice prior to use. Then, 50 μL of each sample was transferred into a 96-well plate, followed by the addition of 50 μL of ALP working solution. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, 100 μL of reaction termination solution was added to each well, and the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 405 nm. 2.10.

Conclusions The excessive accumulation of ROS and the subsequent oxidative stress response are key factors leading to stem cell senescence and the impairment of regenerative capacity in aged tissues. This study aims to precisely and comprehensively regulate the ROS levels within BMSCs under oxidative conditions. Here, ROS-sensitive selenium-containing polymers were designed, which can self-assemble into nano-micelles, enter cells, and effectively scavenge intracellular ROS. This study further explored the effects of nano-micelles with different Se contents on delaying the oxidative senescence of BMSCs and maintaining their regenerative capacity. Among them, nano-micelles containing 8% selenium (Wt %) can significantly regulate the intracellular ROS levels in BMSCs under oxidative conditions, bringing them close to those observed in the control group. In an oxidative microenvironment, NMSe-8 nano-micelles markedly reduced the expression of senescence-related markers in BMSCs, such as p16 p53 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, Y.Y., C.L. and Y.Z.; methodology, Z.H. and C.S.; software, Z.H.; validation, Z.H. and F.X.; formal analysis, X.W.; investigation, Z.H.; resources, Y.Y.; data curation, Z.H. and F.X.; writing—original draft preparation, Z.H. and F.Z.; writing—review and editing, Y.Y., C.L. and Y.Z.; visualization, Z.H.; supervision, Y.Y.; project administration, Y.Y.; funding acquisition, Y.Y. and C.L.
