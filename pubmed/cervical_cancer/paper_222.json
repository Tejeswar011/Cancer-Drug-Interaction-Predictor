Abstract Late-stage cancer incidence has been proposed as a surrogate outcome for cancer-specific mortality in future screening trials. Two previous meta-analyses with 33 and 39 trials assessed trial-level surrogacy but provided inconsistent conclusions about the suitability of late-stage cancer endpoints replacing mortality. Our systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO ID, CRD42023369320) investigated the association between the effect of cancer screening on the incidence of late-stage cancer and cancer-specific mortality. From 57 trials with 61 trial arm comparisons, correlation between late-stage incidence and mortality outcomes was 0.69 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47–0.84] for all cancers combined. Specifically, correlations were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.27–0.93) for bowel ( N N N pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Guideline development methodology prioritizes randomized controlled trial (“trial”) evidence on reduced cancer-specific mortality before recommending adoption of a new cancer screening program ( 1 2 3 4 The relationship between a reduction in late-stage diagnoses and mortality in cancer screening is complex and can differ across the spectrum of cancer locations and subtypes ( 5 7 8 11 12 15 16 Previous studies on this topic include meta-analytic evaluations of early indicators of a mortality reduction in breast screening, which found high trial-level correlations between the screening effect on late-stage breast cancer and breast cancer mortality in mammography trials ( 17 18 19 20 In this article, we report a systematic literature review of cancer screening trials that reported both cancer-specific late-stage diagnoses and mortality outcomes and included any testing technology, cancer type, or trial size, following the inclusion criteria and other decisions made available in a pre-published protocol [PROSPERO ID: CRD42023369320; Supplementary Methods (Protocol)]. Many different criteria for surrogate endpoints have been developed. Here, we evaluate surrogacy by following the definition used to support the development of extensions to the CONSORT and SPIRIT checklists for studies reporting surrogate endpoints, that is, “An outcome that is used in clinical trials as a substitute for a direct measure of how a patient feels; functions; or survives. A surrogate outcome does not measure the clinical benefit of primary interest in and of itself; but rather is expected to predict that clinical benefit or harm based on epidemiologic; therapeutic; pathophysiologic; or other scientific evidence.” ( 21 Materials and Methods Literature search The systematic search of the literature was undertaken in two stages. Both stages are explained in detail in Supplementary Methods and Tables, Section 2, Supplementary Tables S3–S11. Briefly, the aim of the first stage (“Search 1”) was to identify trials of primary screening for any human cancer, using any screening test, that reported the mortality outcomes, without size, time, or other restrictions except English language. These searches were undertaken in the MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases and included publications registered therein by the 21st of September 2022. The second stage (“Search 2”) was undertaken in the MEDLINE and Embase databases for publications registered until the period spanning from the 11th of January 2023 to the 28th of April 2023 (the exact date depended on the trial) and aimed to identify, for each trial, all relevant publications reporting outcomes that might be considered as surrogates for mortality (see below for the definitions) or any additional mortality outcomes not identified by “Search 1”. If additional trials were identified at this stage, they were included in the review. “Search 1” was supplemented by contacting cancer screening experts, checking the lists of trials included in the most recent cancer screening reviews by independent bodies such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and by publications identified via “Search 2”. To supplement “Search 2,” we checked the introduction and discussion sections of articles included in the mapping and data extraction phases for any previously unidentified references. Because of funder deadlines, no additional data were requested from the trialists. Study selection Titles and abstracts of the publications found by the searches were screened independently by the same two reviewers in both stages (J. Geppert and M. Rebolj), consulting all full-text publications considered potentially relevant by either reviewer. Full-text publications were assessed against the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Supplementary Methods and Tables, Section 2, Supplementary Tables S3 and S6) independently by five reviewers (J. Geppert, M. Rebolj, K. Freeman, N. Kouppa, and C. Stinton), with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer (A.R. Brentnall, M. Rebolj, and S. Taylor-Phillips). In “Search 1,” individual or cluster randomized controlled trials were eligible for inclusion if they reported cancer-specific or all-cause mortality outcomes for all arms. In “Search 2,” publications were eligible if they reported outcomes that might be considered as surrogates (see below for definitions) or further mortality outcomes for trials identified in “Search 1.” In both stages, we excluded non-randomized studies; nonhuman studies, letters, reviews, editorials, and communications with insufficient information on methods and/or no numerical outcomes data; gray literature and conference abstracts; and articles not available in the English language. Reasons for exclusions at the full-text level are reported in Supplementary Methods and Tables, Section 2, Supplementary Tables S5 (“Search 1”) and S9 (“Search 2”). For each trial, all identified publications were mapped by the reported outcomes and timepoints, and publications that did not provide additional data were excluded from the data extraction. Figure 1 Table 1 Figure 1. PRISMA flowchart for the systematic search of the literature. The figure describes the process of identifying, screening, and selecting the studies for the systematic review. * As half of the original MEDLINE search results (prior deduplication) were inadvertently overwritten, the original number retrieved is not available for “Search 2”. Records: titles with abstracts. Reports: full-text articles. List of reasons for exclusion with explanation. Duplicate: the same abstract was included twice for full-text assessment i.e., it was identified from different databases and not picked up as a duplicate at the de-duplication stage. Intervention: the intervention was not invitation or no invitation to screening with a well-defined test, but study group subjects were urged to have annual multiphasic health checkups, with screening tests not being defined. Outcomes: Search 1: no relevant mortality outcomes reported for all arms (all cause or cancer specific). Search 2: no relevant comparative surrogate outcomes specified in our protocol were reported. Publication type: included letters, reviews, editorials, and communications with insufficient information on methods and/or no numerical outcomes data; gray literature and conference abstracts. Study design: not a randomized controlled trial. Language: the report was not published in English. After discussion: these are full texts for which the two reviewers (MR/JG) initially disagreed on the inclusion but agreed on the exclusion after a discussion. Conference abstract: only an abstract was reported. Letter/review without additional data: these are letters or reviews that reported sufficient information on methods but did not report any additional outcomes data that we have not already identified from other reports. No relevant trial: this report was not on a trial that could be included in the study. Screen-detected outcomes only: these reports only included outcomes from the intervention arm e.g., proportion of screen-detected cancers. IN “Search 1”: reports identified in “Search 2” that were already included after “Search 1”. Already “IN”: reports that were already identified and included via “Search 1” or “Search 2” database searches. Review without additional data: previous reviews that reported sufficient information on methods but did not report any additional outcome data that we have not identified already from other reports.

The whole trial included three towns in Zhongshan City and 13 towns in Sihui City, recruiting people from 2008 to 2015. c Different target cancers screened for in each trial. High-risk population was defined as patients with a recent diagnosis of venous thrombosis ± pulmonary embolism. Data extraction The relevant data were extracted into a piloted electronic data collection form by one researcher and checked by a second (J. Geppert, M. Rebolj, N. Kouppa, C. Stinton, M.J. Randell, K. Freeman, and B. Shinkins). For consistency, the data for most trials were extracted by the same researcher (J. Geppert); for the remaining trials, J. Geppert performed the checks. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer (A.R. Brentnall, M. Rebolj, and S. Taylor-Phillips). The extracted information included general information on the trial design and methods such as the eligibility criteria, study flow, population, intervention, and comparator and publication-specific statistical methods and results on the reported mortality and surrogate outcomes. Outcomes Our protocol included an extraction of the following outcomes: (i) cancer-specific mortality, (ii) the incidence of late-stage cancer, and (iii) the proportion of cancers diagnosed at a late stage. Numerators of (ii) and (iii) included the cumulative numbers of late-stage target cancer diagnoses since randomization, by arm, up to the timepoint of the reporting by trialists. For the incidence of late-stage cancer, the denominator included person-years of follow-up in randomized individuals, by arm, up to the time of the reporting; if this was not available, we substituted it with the number of randomized individuals by arm. For the proportion of cancers diagnosed at a late stage, the denominator included the cumulative number of target cancers diagnosed at any stage, including cancers with unknown stage, up to the same timepoint since randomization. For (i) and (ii), the endpoints extracted were the unadjusted rate ratio, relative risk (RR), or hazard ratio estimates comparing the intervention versus the control arm and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) as reported in trial publications if available; otherwise, we used the extracted aggregated data and calculated rate ratios where person-years were available, or risk ratios if only numbers randomized were available, with Wald-type 95% CI. For (iii), we used the extracted aggregate data to estimate the relative proportions. Definition of late-stage cancer There is no standardized definition of late-stage cancer across cancer types or across the periods of time in which screening trials have been run. Therefore, we defined it using a variety of nomenclatures. The definition chosen for each trial was based on what was reported and (subjective) judgment on the most appropriate definition based on the difference in expected prognosis and frequency between early and late stages. Late-stage definitions of cancer included (i) stage II+, stage IIB+, stage III+, or stage IV using a variety of staging systems; (ii) T4 (tumor invades adjacent structures) and/or N ≥ 1 (describing the number of nodes that contain cancer) and/or M1 (cancer has spread to other parts of the body) in the tumor–node–metastasis classification of malignant tumors; (iii) cancer-specific alternatives such as Dukes stage C or D for bowel cancer; or (iv) close cancer-specific approximations such as node positivity for breast cancer or commonly used alternative prognostic factors such as Gleason score 8+ for prostate cancer. Where the trialists did not categorize cancers into late and early stages, we attempted to follow a consistent definition across trials and cancer types, but this was not always possible. In particular, for one bowel and one cervical screening trial, data on cancer diagnoses were not provided by stage or another prognostic factor. However, screening tests in both trials targeted (early) preinvasive lesions with the aim of preventing invasive cancer. Therefore, we defined late-stage cancer as any invasive (bowel or cervical, respectively) cancer as screening with these tests is expected to reduce the cancer-specific incidence. The final definitions of late-stage cancer by trial, as used in our primary analyses, are given in Table 2 Table 2.

Trial-specific timepoints for late-stage outcomes The number of relevant publications varied substantially by trial, ranging from a single report on the mortality and a late-stage cancer outcome to multiple reports with assessments at various timepoints since randomization. Where late-stage cancer outcomes were reported at several timepoints, we defined the “primary” available late-stage outcome as (i) one that was measured the closest to the midway point between the end of the intervention period and the “main” mortality timepoint (defined below). This is because late-stage outcomes measured after the conclusion of the intervention in a trial and before the “main” mortality outcome could be informative for early decision-making about a population-based rollout. If no such report was identified, then an estimate reported (ii) at the same time as the “main” mortality outcome was considered as the “primary” available late-stage outcome or else (iii) at the latest timepoint when the screening intervention was still ongoing or soon thereafter. Thus, the defined “primary” late-stage outcomes for each trial are reported in Table 2 Trial-specific “main” timepoints for cancer-specific mortality outcomes Where cancer-specific mortality was reported at more than one timepoint, we defined the “main” mortality timepoint as one at which primary results were to be calculated by trialists in the original publications, in the trial protocol, or in the statistical analysis plan and the power calculations or if necessary, the only or the latest available timepoint. The “main” mortality endpoints are reported by trial in Table 2 Statistical analysis We evaluated the association between the screening effect on late-stage incidence and proportion cancer outcomes and cancer-specific mortality using a fixed-effects linear model of log RR estimates weighted by the inverse variance of the screening effect on mortality [rather than late-stage incidence, because we felt that precision on cancer-specific mortality better standardizes information at a trial level across different cancers than either surrogate examined, which are also affected by differing late-/early-stage incidence (in control) across cancer types]. We made no assumption on the position of the intercept in this regression model; a value close to the origin, however, would be indicative of no screening effect on mortality when there is no screening effect on the late-stage outcome. We calculated a weighted Pearson correlation coefficient and associated coefficient of determination ( R 2 We evaluated heterogeneity in multiple ways. We explored the relationship between late-stage cancer and cancer-specific mortality by the type of screening test for cancers for which sufficient data were available. To study the impact of the timing of the reporting on these associations, we plotted estimates of the relative incidence of late-stage cancer against the “main” relative mortality estimate when the former were reported for at least two timepoints from the same trial (Supplementary Methods and Tables, Section 4, Supplementary Table S16). Subgroup analyses focused on trials in which the late-stage outcomes were measured before the “main” mortality endpoint but after the screening period had ended. Sensitivity analysis used stage III+ across all cancers. Sensitivity of correlation coefficients to individual trial (as a unit of observation) was assessed by leave-one-out validation, in which each trial was left out once and the weighted correlation was performed on the other trials. Exploratory analysis included the use of a single combined outcome for each combination of cancer type and class of screening test.

Only 14 of 57 trials reported 15 trial arm comparisons with late-stage incidence at an earlier timepoint than mortality but after the screening intervention had ended. Across the 57 trials, correlation between the relative incidence of late-stage cancer and relative mortality between trial arms was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.47–0.84; R 2 Fig. 2 R 2 N R 2 N R 2 N Fig. 3A–C Fig. 3 Figure 2.

Each trial is then represented by two or up to three points connected by a straight line drawn at the main estimate of the screening effect on cancer-specific mortality; this line shows how the estimates of the screening effect on the late-stage incidence within a specific trial changed over time.

Trial-level surrogacy meta-analysis: relative proportion of cancers diagnosed at late stage Data for the relative proportion of cancers diagnosed at late stage were available from 55 trials. As expected, correlation between this late-stage outcome and the “main” relative mortality outcome was weaker than for the relative incidence of late-stage diagnoses. The estimate of the correlation coefficient for all cancers combined was 0.30 (95% CI, 0.00–0.54; R 2 Fig. 2B N R 2 N R 2 N R 2 Fig. 3D–F Meta-analysis: sensitivity and subgroup analyses Data were available for fewer trials for pre-planned sensitivity and subgroup analyses.

For comparison, there was a mean 13% reduction (95% CI, 11%–16%) in the late-stage cancer incidence (57 trials) and a mean 21% (95% CI, 19%–24%) reduction in the proportion of cancers diagnosed at late stage (55 trials).

Exploratory evaluation of the utility of the 95% CI RR for late-stage incidence as a “forecast” of the final trial result for cancer-specific mortality. A, B, A Discussion Principal findings Data from 57 randomized controlled trials in cancer screening showed a clear trial-level association between the screening effects on the incidence of late-stage cancer and the effects on cancer-specific mortality. Despite substantial differences between the trials in their designs and contexts in which they were undertaken, this overall association was observed across cancer types, particularly for cancer types for which most trials have been run (lung, breast, and bowel). Exploratory analysis suggested that for the majority of trials, the RR associated with cancer mortality was within the 95% CI of the RR for late-stage incidence. There was also consistency in evaluation of the utility of screening tests based on the surrogate or mortality in a screening test meta-analysis context. However, most trials did not report the incidence of late-stage cancer in advance of mortality. Furthermore, liver cancer trials were an outlier in which the incidence of late-stage cancer was a poor surrogate for mortality because (in these trials) there was not enough difference in survival by stage at detection and even stage I cancers had abysmal survival. We did not find evidence to support the use of the relative proportion of cancers diagnosed at a late stage as a surrogate for cancer mortality. This may be partly due to susceptibility to cancers detected early which may progress very slowly; a high number of such cancers in the denominator would reduce the proportion of cancers that are late stage even though their treatment would not improve cancer-specific mortality within a typical observation period. Furthermore, the relative proportion of cancers diagnosed at a late stage does not respect randomization since the denominator is a post-randomization event. We and others ( 16 Strengths and weaknesses of the study A key strength of our study is that we worked according to a pre-published protocol and a prespecified statistical analysis plan, and our study is the most comprehensive systematic review in this area (Supplementary Methods and Tables, Section 1). However, our analysis shares several limitations with all previous meta-analyses ( 17 20 6 Comparison with the literature and policy implications Two previous meta-analyses by Feng and colleagues ( 19 20 27 Fig. 2 Fig. 4 R 2 One of the most visible differences between the available meta-analyses is the definition of cancer-specific late-stage outcomes. Feng and colleagues ( 19 17 18 20 11 20 28 post hoc 29 These examples all reflect the lack of an established framework for the evaluation of outcome surrogacy in cancer screening and show that a concerted effort to further develop and optimize methodologic designs and validate a framework to appraise the risk of bias in the studies contributing the evidence would be beneficial ( 16 30 34 The topic of mortality outcome surrogacy in cancer screening has received renewed attention because of the emergence of new multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests. In particular, a randomized controlled clinical trial of 140,000 participants is currently ongoing in England (NHS-Galleri trial, NCT05611632 35 Figs. 2 3 5 36 37 38 Lastly, the Chinese Qidong liver screening trial was an outlier with important implications for evidence on the surrogacy of late-stage cancer incidence for cancers with abysmal prognosis across all stages. It highlights that the relative incidence of late-stage cancer might not be a good surrogate for long-term mortality benefits for cancers in which there is little difference in survival between early and late stages. On this note, the trialists in the Qidong study also considered a Poisson regression model using their individual-level data, not available to us. They estimated that the rate ratio for death in the screening group was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.68–1.03) relative to the control group. These results are consistent with a small benefit on mortality that ultimately was not sustained because of the very poor prognosis across all stage groups in the trial population. One may also note that in this trial, 2-year survival was under 10% (in both arms), so the gain of using advanced stage, even if it worked, would be small. At the time that one could have used advanced stage as an outcome, there would already have been many deaths from individuals diagnosed with early-stage cancers. In general, this example shows that there might be some types of cancers detected by an MCED test for which the stage shift gained through screening is inconsequential for an improved outcome. Such cases should not deter researchers from investigating, for example, a refined surrogate that could be a useful early endpoint for a reduction in the incidence of advanced disease for most cancer types detectable by an MCED test. Conclusion A reduction in the incidence of late-stage cancer diagnoses was correlated with a reduction in cancer-specific mortality across the majority of previous randomized controlled trials of cancer screening. In other words, a trial-level relationship between late-stage cancer incidence and mortality was evident. However, the evidence was based on a correlation of a limited range of cancer types and screening tests and limited data on late-stage incidence effects at an earlier timepoint than mortality results (but after the screening period had ended). Therefore, although the evidence supports further investigations into utilizing tumor characteristics as surrogates in future evaluations of new cancer screening tests, and acting now to develop methodologic guidance for including surrogates into future study designs, the interpretation of these data do not allow us to conclude that the incidence of late-stage disease can reliably replace disease-specific mortality for all cancers. Given the slow pace of starting and completing cancer screening trials, it would be prudent for trialists to act now to collect relevant stage and other prognostic tumor features so that these investigations can advance and the potential would exist to act on these findings if they were sufficiently persuasive.

Figure S3 Figure S3 shows he association between the screening effect on the proportion of late-stage cancers (among all cancers diagnosed up to the time of the reporting) and the screening effect on mortality (trial-level surrogacy), by cancer type where at least three trials were available for analysis. Figure S4 Figure S4 shows the Evaluation of the utility of regarding the 95% CI RR for late-stage incidence as a “forecast” of the final trial result for cancer-specific mortality, only including 15 trial arm comparisons with the late-stage outcome RR reported prior to the primary analysis for mortality but after the screening period had ended.
