Therefore, the general clinical characteristics and pre- and post-treatment MRI characteristics of patients were collected to analyze the factors affecting the prognosis of LACC. In this study, we investigated a variety of clinical and imaging parameters to determine which factors affect the prognosis of LACC following CCRT. These findings may provide some guidance for subsequent treatment after initial chemoradiotherapy to improve the prognosis. Materials and methods Patients This study initially screened 443 patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the cervix (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] stage T2b-T3b) between May 2018 and December 2020. Patients with tumors were confined to the pelvic cavity without any evidence of distant metastases (including para-aortic lymph node metastases), those who underwent DWI-MRI before and 1 month after treatment, and those who received no prior treatment were included in this study. Meanwhile, patients who received no chemotherapy during radiotherapy, underwent modulated radiotherapy other than EBRT were excluded. Patients who did not complete radiotherapy were also excluded. In total, 189 patients had complete clinical records, including variables such as age, tumor stage, serum hemoglobin level, SCC antigen level, radiotherapy duration, pretreatment tumor size, RD, pelvic lymph node (PLN) status, pretreatment ADC mean mean mean. 1 Fig. 1 The flowchart of our studying patiens Treatments All patients received CCRT with a combination of EBRT and platinum-based chemotherapy at least one course, administered by every one or three weeks. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy and high-dose-rate image-guided brachytherapy (HDR-BT) were administered. EBRT was delivered at a dose of 45 to 50.8 Gy in 25 or 28 fractions, with a daily fraction size of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy. The maximum and minimum values within the target range did not exceed ± 10% of the prescribed dose, and the dosage of the enlarged lymph nodes reached 50–66 Gy, with the parametrial dose reaching 50–54 Gy. Simultaneously, HDR-BT was performed with a source of 192 Ir. The minimum dose covering 90% of the high-risk clinical tumor volume (D90 HR-CTV) reached 22 to 33 Gy in 4 to 6 fractions. Patients with positive common iliac lymph nodes (short axis diameter ≥ 15 mm) were treated with expanded-field radiotherapy, covering the area adjacent to the aorta and inferior vena cava, with a lower border of the aortic bifurcation,and the upper boundary of the extended field was usually at T12 or the renal vessel. Imaging protocol and predictive parameter calculation MRI was performed using a 1.5 T instrument. Pelvic MRI was performed before (within 4 weeks of treatment initiation) and 1 month (within 6 weeks after the final BT) after treatment. DWI–MRI was first performed at our in 2018. The protocol included enhanced DWI, T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI). T2WI revealed that the cervical tumor presented significantly higher signal intensity than the surrounding tissue. Tumor size was defined as the maximum diameter of the tumor dimension measured on T2WI–MRI (in cm). Positive PLNs were defined as those with short diameters ≥ 1.5 cm. Enhanced DWI was used, and the ADC map was automatically generated. ADC maps were generated using all three B values. The ADC mean Follow-up One month after chemoradiation, clinical and radiological examinations were performed and repeated every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and once yearly thereafter. Statistical analysis The study endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). PFS was calculated from the date of treatment initiation to the date of disease progression or last follow-up, whereas OS was calculated from the date of treatment initiation to the date of death or last follow-up. Data analysis was conducted via the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Statistics software (version 26.0) and R Studio (version 4.2.2). For univariate and multivariate analyses, the Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate the effect of significant factors on the survival endpoints.

SCC mean AJCC HR CI Survival The median follow-up period was 58 (range: 11–71) months. A total of 123 (65.0%) patients showed no residual tumor 1 month following CCRT. Approximately 80% of patients had no RD in the cervix 6 months after treatment, which was confirmed by MRI. Furthermore,fifty-six (29.6%) patients demonstrated disease progression at the latest follow-up time, including central recurrence (n = 21, 37.5%), local regional recurrence (n = 20, 35.7%), local regional recurrence with distant metastasis (n = 12, 21.4%), and distant metastasis only (n = 3, 5.4%). Overall, 23 patients died of their disease, whereas 33 remained alive. The 5-year PFS and OS rates were 73.8% and 85.5%, respectively. The 5-year PFS and OS rates in patients with AJCC stages T2b and T3a-3b were 87.1% and 53.7%, respectively.

The optimal cutoff values for the SCC antigen levels for PFS and OS were different. Survival curves drawn for patient grouped according to the two different cutoff values are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4a, 4b. However, when the median value was used as the cutoff, patients with a median SCC antigen level > 4.4 ng/mL demonstrated both worse PFS ( P 2 P 2 P 3 P 3 P 4 P 4 Fig. 2 Kaplan–Meier analyses of progression-free survival ( a b Fig. 3 Kaplan–Meier analyses of progression-free survival ( a b Fig. 4 Kaplan–Meier analyses of progression-free survival ( a b Discussion Our research revealed that the SCC antigen level, pretreatment tumor size, positive PLN, tumor stage, ACT, RD and post-treatment ADC mean mean 19 Tumor stage was shown to be a major predictor of survival in patients with LACC after CCRT. Other variables, such as histological subtype, SCC antigen level, HGB level, ADC mean 10 12 10 20 10 20 21 22 DWI–MRI has the ability to differentiate normal tissue from cervical carcinoma, and its results are quantified in terms of the ADC. The decreased ADC of malignant tumors indicates the limited mobility of water molecules at these sites. Multiple studies have demonstrated that pretreatment ADC, post-treatment ADC, changes in ADC and the 90th percentile ADC value over the course of chemoradiotherapy for cervical cancer are predictors of survival time, recurrence risk, and treatment efficiency [ 12 17 mean 23 mean The presence of RD has been reported as an important prognostic factor for survival. RD is detected via MRI in clinical practice. MRI is considered a crucial tool for evaluating treatment response, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is often employed [ 24 25 26 28 27 29 26 P 30 Although RD is an important factor affecting the survival of LACC patients after radiotherapy, the importance of the methods applied to identify RD and the postradiation treatment interventions is unclear. Salvage surgery improved the outcome in individuals with central pelvic RD who do not have metastatic disease following CCRT [ 31 32 Furthermore, ACT has been frequently often used as an additional therapy to improve survival in patients with LACC following CCRT. Two retrospective studies from Turkey [ 33 34 35 36 37 ACT is predominantly employed in clinical practice at our center to treat patients with advanced stage disease or RD after chemoradiotherapy. Our study revealed that ACT was a predictor of OS in the univariate analysis but was not a significant indicator in the multivariate analysis. The reason may be that there are no uniform criteria for identifying patients who accept ACT after CCRT. The OUTBACK trial also did not randomize patients after the completion of standard chemoradiation. Patients who underwent salvage surgery were not included in our analysis, however, individuals with RD size ≥ 1.1 cm were given the option to be considered for salvage surgery. Therefore, our center is currently conducting prospective clinical trials (NCT: 04409860 and NCT: 05749887) to evaluate the effectiveness of ACT and salvage surgery for patients with RD after CCRT for cervical cancer. The two related trials aim to investigate suitable treatment options for high-risk patients with LACC following CCRT and to further explore the prognostic factors. Compared with other studies, our study only assessed the histological subtype of SCC, thus avoiding the prognostic impact of the pathological type. Moreover, this study included many varieties of imaging and clinical features for prognostic analysis. Additionally, we found that adjuvant therapy may be necessary for patients with advanced stage disease and RD size ≥ 1.1 cm following CCRT. Notably, our study has some limitations. Neither pathological evidence nor PET/CT was used to help detect RD in the cervix. Pathology confirmation of locoregional RD prior to adjuvant treatment is necessary in the future. Furthermore, the tumor volume, tumor size reduction rate, and percentage ADC reported in other studies that may affect prognosis were ignored in this study. More imaging parameters should be considered in future investigations. Additionally, this was a retrospective study with a limited sample size. The results may be unreliable and have not been validated in an independent dataset, which may limit the generalizability of our results beyond the study population. Multicenter prospective studies with larger sample sizes should be conducted. Conclusion This study revealed that the SCC antigen level, tumor stage, and RD were independent variables associated with OS and PFS in patients with AJCC stage T2b-T3b squamous cell cervical cancer receiving CCRT.
