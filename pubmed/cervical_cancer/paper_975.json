APC/C functions with the assistance of the adapter protein Cdc20 and the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UbcH10 for orderly progression of mitosis. Reportedly, deregulated expression of either CDC20 UBCH10 UBCH10 Methods Quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed to assess CDC20 UBCH10 CDC20 UBCH10 CDC20-UBCH10 Results The initial results revealed correlated overexpression of both genes in a significant number of primary HNSC samples from the prospective cohort. Concordantly, gene expression data from the TCGA-HNSC cohort revealed a similar correlation. In addition, HNSC-affected individuals with this correlated overexpression showed an increased level of cellular aneuploidy. More importantly, Kaplan‒Meier analyses revealed that patients harboring this correlated expression signature had the poorest survival outcome.

Among the wide array of cancers, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), the sixth most common global malignancy, is a type of diverse neoplastic disorder that includes a heterogeneous group of tumors. It develops from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx [ 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 9 TP53 RB 10 As a major hallmark of cancer, aneuploidy is one of the predominant features of chromosomal instability (CIN), which reportedly triggers tumorigenesis [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 19 20 22 23 24 cis 25 As reported, defects in the functional activity of SAC lead to chromosomal mis-segregation, resulting in aneuploidy and the promotion of cancer [ 26 32 33 35 26 31 36 42 37 39 43 48 Cdc20 Cdc20 UBCH10 39 49 39 Interestingly, aberrant expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins is commonly associated with the tumorigenesis of HNSC [ 1 3 31 50 Materials and methods Patients and tissue samples Surgically dissected primary malignant and adjacent normal tissue samples were collected from individuals diagnosed with oral cancer at the Saroj Gupta Cancer Centre & Research Institute (SGCC&RI), as part of Eastern-Indian study cohort. A total of 32 patients (24 men and 8 women) were recruited. Informed written consent was obtained from patients before collection of tissue specimens. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee under the regulation of the Govt. of India (Registration No. ECR/250/Inst/WB/2013/RR-20). The clinicopathological features was obtained from the patient record database. TNM stage was determined according to the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual. The overall survival period of patients was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or the last follow-up until the end of 2023. Quantitative real-time (q-RT) PCR Total RNA was extracted from the tissue specimens via TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. A total of 1 µg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR™ Green master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) in a PCR instrument (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with a set of primers encompassing the coding regions of CDC20 UBCH10 18S rRNA 18S rRNA T T T T T T T 2 Name Forward Primer (5'−3') Reverse Primer (5'−3') CDC20 CGCCAACCGATCCCACAG CAGGTTCAAAGCCCAGGC UBCH10 TGGTCTGCCCTGTATGATGT AAAAGCTGTGGGGTTTTTCC 18S rRNA TGACTCTAGATAACCTCG GACTCATTCCAATTACAG Immunohistochemistry analysis and scoring Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens were cut into 5 μM sections. The sections were then subjected to baking at 65 °C for 30 min, followed by deparaffinization involving two subsequent changes in xylene and rehydration in ethanol at decreasing concentrations. Heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate, 0.5% Tween 20, pH 6.0) at 121 °C in an autoclave for 3 min. After endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) Slides, with tissue section, were heated at 56 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, the slides were deparaffinized in three changes of xylene, followed by dehydration in ethanol. The slides were pre-treated with warm pre-treatment solution (2xSSC, 0.5%NP-40, pH 7) for 60 min at 85 °C, air dried, and then covered with Protease I solution. The slides were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then dehydrated with increasing grades of ethanol and air dried properly. FISH probes were prepared with hybridization solution (50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 0.1% SDS, and 300 ng/mL salmon sperm DNA in 2 × SSC). The slides were subsequently incubated in a pre-warmed chamber with denatured probes against chromosome 1 (XCE 1 orange, Metasystems) overnight at 42 °C. Post hybridization, the slides were proceeded for wash with wash solution (0.5xSSC, 0.1%NP-40). In case of cell line, cells were harvested preceding trypsinisation in 1X PBS and treated with a 1:1 mixture of 0.4% KCl and 0.8% sodium citrate for 20 min at 37 °C. Following this, the cells were fixed using 0.1 mL freshly made fixative (3:1 mixture of methanol and acetic acid) and incubated on ice for 20 min. The fixed cells were then overlaid on charged slides, allowed to air dry, and baked at 56 °C overnight. The centromeric enumeration probe was added to the slides, denatured at 75 °C, and hybridized in a humidified chamber at 37 °C overnight. The slides were washed in 2X SSC buffer (Sigma-S6639) for 30 s at room temperature. The nuclei were counterstained using DAPI, and stored in the dark for 10 min prior to signal enumeration. The fluorescent signals were visualised at 40X magnification under fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axio Scope.A1). All experiments were performed in triplicate. The aneuploidy percentage was calculated using the following formula:  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\frac{\\mathrm{Numbered}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{aneuploid}\\;\\mathrm{cells}\\;}{\\mathrm{Total}\\;\\mathrm{number}\\;\\mathrm{of}\\;\\mathrm{cells}}\\times100$$\\end{document} Comprehensive public database analyses The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA): Gene expression data of CDC20 UBCH10 https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/ 51 Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC): Protein expression data of Cdc20 and UbcH10 of the CPTAC-HNSC cohort were retrieved from UALCAN database ( https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/ Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC): The breast cancer patient dataset (METABRIC, Nature 2012 & Nat Commun 2016) was retrieved from cBioPortal database ( https://www.cbioportal.org/ 52 N p Cancer Cell Line Encyclopaedia (CCLE): The gene expression data of CDC20 UBCH10 https://depmap.org/portal/ 53 CDC20 UBCH10 https://xenabrowser.net/ 54 CDC20 UBCH10 http://kmplot.com/analysis/ 55 CDC20-UBCH10 CDC20 UBCH10 CDC20 UBCH10 CDC20-UBCH10 Cell culture, transfection, and lentiviral transduction The HNSC cell line UPCI:SCC084 was obtained from the CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, India. The cells were grown and maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin‒streptomycin antibiotics (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., MA, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 39 CDC20 CDC20 CDC20 Western blotting (WB) Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with NP-40 lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The protein concentration was determined via the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). Equal amounts of protein samples were separated using SDS-PAGE (8–12%), transferred to activated PVDF membranes (Amersham, GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies specific for Cdc20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), UbcH10 (ABclonal Science, Inc.), and beta-actin (Abcam) at 4 °C Colony formation assay Cells were seeded at 2 × 10 3 Wound healing assay Cells were grown at 60% confluency for 12-18 h before transfection. Afterwards, cells were transfected with either control and/or pCDNA5-FLAG-Cdc20 plasmid in 35 mm dishes for 24 h. Upon achieving 95% confluency, a scratch was created with a sterile 10 μl pipette tip for both the experimental sets, as uniformly as possible. The cell debri were removed with 1X PBS wash and the wells were replenished with fresh DMEM media. Each set of scratch wounds was photographed at 0, 12, and 24 h using an inverted microscope. The percentage of wound healing was quantified with the help of ImageJ software and calculated using the following formula: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathrm{Wound}\\;\\mathrm{Closure}\\;\\%\\;=\\left[{\\mathrm{Area}}_{\\mathrm t=0\\;\\mathrm{hr}}-\\;{\\mathrm{Area}}_{\\mathrm t=\\left(12,\\;24\\right)\\;\\mathrm{hr}}\\right]/\\;\\left[{\\mathrm{Area}}_{\\mathrm t=0\\;\\mathrm{hr}}\\right]\\times100$$\\end{document} The experiment was conducted in three independent series, each in triplicates.
