Control of the intervals between proliferation and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells is coordinated by developmental regulators, comprised of both microRNAs (miRNAs) and proteins, termed heterochronic genes.

For generation of neurospheres, cells were plated at a density of 10,000–100,000 cell/well in Costar® 6-well Clear Flat Bottom Ultra-Low Attachment Multiple Well plate (Corning, 3471). All cells were re-suspended in DMEM/F-12: Neurobasal™ Medium (5:3 mix; Gibco, 21103049), bFGF (20 ng/ml; R&D systems, 3139-FB), N-2 Supplement (1 %; Gibco, 17502048), B-27 Supplement (2 %; Gibco, 17504044), β-Mercaptoethanol (Gibco, 21985023), 50 μM final. Self-renewal media (same as initiation) with addition of: EGF 20 ng/ml (R&D systems, 2028-EG), chicken egg extract 10 %.

Neurospheres grown for 2–3 days in differentiation media were then dissociated and additionally grown in BDNF 50–100 ng/ml for 3–5 days. Lin28a/b were knocked out post-neurosphere formation via adenoviral infection with Ad-Cre-GFP adenovirus (Vector Biolabs, 1700) or Ad-GFP adenovirus (Vector Biolabs, 1060). 4.6 Sequence alignment and QGRS mapper RNA Sequence alignments and analysis of guanine (G)-rich (G-rich) regions predicted to be LIN28-mRNA/miRNA binding sites was performed using the FASTA/NCBI of human mRNA sequences below: NC_000009.12 NM_002701.6 NM_024865.4 NM_003106.4 NM_003483.6 NM_021784.5 NM_001904.4 Z46629.1 NM_003107.3 NM_003108.4 https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/msa/clustalo http://bioinformatics.ramapo.edu/QGRS/ 4.7 Tissue preparation, immunostaining, and antibodies Embryos were removed from timed pregnant mice that were anesthetized via the open-drop method of isoflurane exposure followed by cervical dislocation and/or ketamine/xylazine. Lungs were dissected and fixed in 10 % formalin overnight. For sectioned immunohistochemical staining, fixed lungs were moved to 70 % ethanol.
