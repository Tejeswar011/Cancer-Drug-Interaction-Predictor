Summary Despite the clinical use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibodies (AVAs) in cancer therapy, resistance frequently develops, leading to disease progression. To address this, we identify a previously unknown role for breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1)-associated RING domain 1 (BARD1) in modulating AVA sensitivity. Epigenetic modulation—via global and targeted DNA methylation—reveals BARD1 as a key regulator of angiogenesis. Sequential treatment with azacytidine overcomes AVA resistance in vivo Graphical abstract Highlights • Targeted demethylation of BARD1 restores sensitivity to anti-VEGF (AVA) therapy • Liposomal dCas9-TET1 enables precise epigenetic editing in vivo • BARD1 regulates angiogenesis independently of its canonical BRCA1 function • Hypoxia-induced DNMT3A represses BARD1 expression and promotes AVA resistance Bayraktar et al. reveal an unexpected role for BARD1 in regulating tumor angiogenesis. By employing targeted epigenetic reactivation strategies, they restore BARD1 expression and overcome resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in ovarian cancer, demonstrating a gene-specific approach to enhance treatment response.

Statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed Student’s t test (A, B, D, F, G, and H). To understand the effect of BARD1 silencing on tumor angiogenesis pathways, we performed RNA sequencing of BARD1-silenced SKOV3ip1 cells. Results showed that 952 genes were differentially expressed: 268 were downregulated and 684 were upregulated (DESeq2 p FN1 ESM1 CXCL8 ETS1 PTX3 CCL2 Table S1 Figure 3 Figure 3 To further validate the role of BARD1 in tumor growth, we collected CM after BARD1 knockdown in SKOV3ip1 cells for an in vivo Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure S4 Figure 3 Figures S4 Figure 3 Next, we ectopically increased BARD1 expression in OVCAR8ip1 cells and then subjected them to RNA sequencing. Compared to BARD1-silenced cells, which showed upregulation of several pro-angiogenic genes, BARD1-expressing cells exhibited a reduction in the expression of several pro-angiogenic genes ( Figures S4 Table S1 Figure 3 in vivo Figure S4 Figure 3 Figure S4 Figure 3 p Figure S4 Figure 3 p Figure S4 Figure 3 To determine whether BARD1 silencing affects tumor growth and progression, we developed a TetOn system for the SKOV3ip1 model.

We first checked BARD1 mRNA and protein expression levels in SKOV3ip1 cells under hypoxic conditions (1% O 2 Figures 4 2 2 Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 4 Figure 4 BARD1 is epigenetically regulated under hypoxic conditions (A and B) Relative mRNA expression of HIF1α and BARD1 in SKOV3ip1 cells grown under normoxic (UT) and hypoxic conditions (1% O 2 n (C) Protein expression levels of HIF1α in normoxic (N) and hypoxic (H) conditions.

To determine whether HIF1α blockade would abrogate the effects of hypoxia on BARD1 expression, we silenced HIF1α using siRNA in SKOV3ip1 cells under hypoxic conditions (1% O 2 Figures 4 S6 Figure 4 2 Figure 4 2 Figure 4 Figure S6 Figure 4 29 in silico 30 Figure 4 To investigate whether hypoxic conditions affect BARD1 expression, we exposed SKOV3ip1 cells to hypoxia (1% O 2 2 Figure 4 Figure S6 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure S6 Figure 4 Figure S6 Figure 4 Liposomal dCas9-CRISPR system demethylates BARD1 We identified several CpG island sites in the BARD1 Table S2 Figure 4 in vitro Figure S6 Figure 4 in vivo 31 To determine whether BARD1 expression is regulated by DNA demethylation, bisulfite sequencing was performed in both in vitro in vivo In vitro Figure S6 in vitro in vivo Figure S6 Figure 4 in vivo Figure S6 Figure 4 To determine whether targeted demethylation of BARD1 would have antitumor effects in vivo Figure 4 Figure S7 Figure 4 BARD1 Figure 4 We next examined whether BARD1 demethylation would combine well with AVA therapy in the SKOV3ip1 model. Combination treatment of sgBARD1-3 and bevacizumab significantly reduced tumor burden compared to either sgControl or bevacizumab monotherapy groups ( Figures 4 Figure S7 Figure 4 Figure S7 in vivo Figure 4 Figure S7 Figure 4 Finally, we validated the antitumor effects of sgBARD1-3 in an independent orthotopic OC model using the HGSC cell line OVCAR5. Tumor-bearing mice ( n p Figures S7 Figure 4 Discussion Here, we identify epigenetic modulation as a fundamental mechanism of adaptive resistance to AVA. Specifically, we demonstrate that BARD1 silencing promotes the upregulation of alternative pro-angiogenic pathways ( Figure 5 in vivo Figure 5 Proposed mechanism of BARD1 epigenetic regulation in response to AVA therapy Prolonged AVA treatment induces adaptive resistance characterized by increased tumor hypoxia. Hypoxia stabilizes HIF1α, which enhances DNMT3A expression. DNMT3 then methylates the BARD1 promoter, repressing its transcription. Reduced BARD1 expression in cancer cells is associated with upregulation of proangiogenic factors, promoting tumor angiogenesis and progression. Targeted demethylation of BARD1 restores its expression and suppresses angiogenesis (created in BioRender). We prioritized BARD1 due to its distinct and compelling role in adaptive AVA resistance. While CHMP4A and CRIP1 also exhibited altered methylation and expression patterns in resistant tumors—characterized by hypomethylation and increased expression—BARD1 stood out for several reasons. Notably, BARD1 expression increased significantly following Aza treatment in adaptive AVA-resistant tumors, a pattern not mirrored by CHMP4A or CRIP1. Moreover, BARD1’s established roles in DNA repair and tumor suppression provide a mechanistic link between its epigenetic silencing and resistance development. In contrast, CHMP4A, a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport III, is involved in membrane remodeling and extracellular vesicle formation 32 , 33 34 , 35 Anti-VEGF therapies are approved for multiple cancer types, 36 37 , 38 37 , 39 37 , 40 , 41 , 42 43 44 45 The dosing regimen of Aza plays an important role in its epigenetic modulation and therapeutic efficacy. In this study, we used a specific dosing regimen optimized for our experimental models, but different dosing schedules could influence the clinical relevance of Aza in combination with AVA therapy. Extended dosing schedules, such as 14 or 21 days of oral Aza (CC-486) at 300 mg daily, have demonstrated improved methylation reversal and sustained DNA hypomethylation compared to shorter regimens. 46 46 Our findings indicate that alterations in DNA methylation patterns contribute to the development of AVA resistance. While Aza offers therapeutic promise, its global hypomethylation effects can produce undesirable toxicities, including hematologic complications, gastrointestinal side effects, and secondary malignancies. 19 , 47 , 48 , 49 50 in vivo 51 Our data also reveal a BRCA1-independent role for BARD1 in regulating angiogenesis. We observed that BARD1 may regulate pro-angiogenic genes through interactions with downstream targets such as ESM1 and FN1. ESM1 enhances endothelial cell proliferation and vascular permeability, 52 53 Given the increasing use of bevacizumab in clinical settings, developing strategies to overcome adaptive resistance is a critical challenge. While preclinical and limited clinical studies suggest that the upregulation of alternative pro-angiogenic growth factors (e.g., bFGF, IL-6, IL-8) contributes to resistance, therapeutic targeting of these pathways has yielded limited clinical benefit. 54 , 55 , 56 57 In conclusion, we demonstrate that targeted demethylation of BARD1 using a liposomal CRISPR-dCas9-TET1 system effectively reverses AVA resistance in OC models. This strategy restores BARD1 expression and enhances therapeutic response, offering a highly specific and translationally relevant epigenetic therapy. Our findings establish a foundation for gene-specific demethylation as a viable strategy to overcome drug resistance, with high translational potential to improve outcomes of patients with cancer. Limitations of the study One limitation of this study is the absence of patient-derived samples, clinical specimens, or clinical trial data to validate the findings. Additionally, the specific molecular mechanisms by which BARD1 regulates alternative pro-angiogenic pathways remain incompletely defined. While preliminary data suggest the involvement of ESM1 and FN1, further investigation is needed to clarify the downstream targets and their roles in resistance mechanisms. Moreover, the study focuses exclusively on OC models, and it remains unclear whether these findings are applicable to other tumor types that develop resistance to AVA. Although this work underscores the potential of targeting BARD1 to overcome AVA resistance, the broader clinical relevance remains unclear, given the modest overall benefits of anti-VEGF therapies and the influence of alternative vascularization mechanisms such as vessel co-option. Future research should incorporate a wider range of cancer models and include clinical validation to enhance the translational impact of this therapeutic strategy.

OVCAR5, COV362ip1 and MDA-OVCA-1 (PDX from chemotherapy-resistant patient tumor) cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM). Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.1% gentamicin sulfate (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA). Human fibrosarcoma cells, HT1080, were cultured in Eagle minimum essential medium with 5% FBS and 0.1% gentamicin sulfate. Human immortalized umbilical vein endothelial cells (RF24) were maintained in MEM supplemented with nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, MEM vitamins, and glutamine (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). Cell culture was performed at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 mycoplasma in vitro in vivo In vivo All mouse studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at MD Anderson. All animal experiments were performed with 4- to 6-week-old female athymic nude (NCr-nude) and NOD/SCID mice obtained from Taconic Biosciences (Rensselaer, NY). Five mice per cage were housed under pathogen-free conditions at a constant temperature and humidity. All mice were fed a regular diet (unless otherwise specified) and water ad libitum 6 36 To analyze the effect of knockdown of BARD1 in an in vivo 6 Tumor growth was monitored, and mice were euthanized 5–10 weeks after inoculation. Samples were processed and stored for histopathologic analyses. Once mice in any group became moribund, all mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Individuals who performed the necropsies were blinded to the treatment group assignments. Tumor weights, nodule numbers, and the presence of ascites were recorded at the time of gross necropsy. All tumor tissues were dissected. Samples were snap-frozen for later DNA, RNA, or protein analyses, fixed in formalin for paraffin embedding, or snap-frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (Miles, Inc, Elkhart, IN), for frozen slide preparation. Bevacizumab (Avastin) was obtained from MD Anderson Cancer Center pharmacy. The AVA B20 (Genentech) is a cross-species reactive, function-blocking monoclonal antibody targeting both human and murine VEGF-A. Azacytidine (Vidaza) was obtained from MD Anderson Cancer Center pharmacy. Bevacizumab, B20 (5 mg/kg, twice per week), and Aza were administered intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg, three times per week). Toxicity assessment of azacytidine and B20 combination therapy in mice Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were treated with either vehicle control or a combination of azacytidine and B20 (AVA) at a dose of 5 mg/kg over a two-week period. Azacytidine was administered three times per week, and B20 was administered twice per week. At the end of the treatment period, blood was collected for complete blood counts (CBC), including white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, eosinophils, and monocytes. In addition, serum biochemical analyses were performed to assess liver and tissue toxicity, including measurements of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Method details Protein extraction and western blot analysis Total protein lysates were prepared using ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (25 mM Tris⋅HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Protein was quantified using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A total of 30 μg of protein was used for Western blot analysis using 4–20% and 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separation gel. The membranes were then blocked and incubated in primary antibody diluted in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween-20 overnight at 4°C. Membranes were probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody depending on their primary antibodies and developed with ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantification of band intensity was done using ImageJ software version 1.54p. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and real-time PCR Tumor tissues or cells of different types/conditions were harvested in Trizol (Life Technologies). Total RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 1 μg of RNA was used for preparing cDNA with random hexamer oligonucleotide primers using a Verso cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the supplier’s recommended protocol. Gene-specific primers were used for real-time PCR in a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied BioSystems, Carlsbad, CA) using 2× SYBR green master mix (Applied BioSystems; Table S3 −ΔΔCT 63 Gene silencing by siRNA SiRNA targeted to BARD1, BRCA1, and HIF1α were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Woodlands, TX).

Lentivirus particles containing BARD1 open reading frames were produced using the Lenti-Pac HIV Expression Packaging Kit protocol (HPK-LvTR-20; GeneCopoeia) and transduced into OVCAR8ip1 cells (1 × 10 6 2 2 + DNA methylation arrays Genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples and was hybridized to the Illumina Infinium 450K Human DNA Methylation Beadchip array to obtain DNA methylation profiles according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Microarray analysis We extracted total RNA from tumor samples of control IgG, Aza, B20, and combination groups using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). A NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used for the assessment of both RNA quality and RNA quantity. Total RNA (700 ng) was labeled and hybridized to Bead Chips according to the manufacturer’s protocols (Illumina, San Diego, CA). We scanned Bead Chips with an Illumina BeadArray Reader, and all array normalization, filtering, and statistical analysis were performed using BRB-ArrayTools (National Cancer Institute). RNA sequencing Total RNA was extracted using Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus kit (ZYMO Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality was determined by RNA integrity number using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and the samples were shipped to Novogene (Sacramento, CA, USA) for RNA-Seq analysis on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Gene expression level was calculated using the number of mapped reads. Fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per millions of base pairs sequenced (FPKM) was used to estimate gene expression levels; this method takes into consideration the effects of both sequencing depth and gene length on counting of fragments. 65 p Promoter analysis and ChIP assay ChIP assays were performed at the MD Anderson Cancer Center Epigenomics Profiling Core. SKOV3ip1-luc cells were cultured in hypoxic (1% oxygen) and normoxic (20% oxygen) conditions for 16 h. Next, the cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min followed by quenching with glycine. Chromatin lysate from these cells was subjected to ChIP with antibodies specific to HIF1α, DNMT3A, AML-1, DNMT1A or normal IgG as control. ChIP assays were performed as described previously with modifications. 66 , 67 30 66 , 67 Table S3 Figure 2 Proteome profiler human angiogenesis array Supernatants from cells were collected and applied to the array membranes following the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Systems, MN, USA). The measurement of the signal was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer and the pixel density of each array spot was analyzed using ImageJ software version 1.54p. (National Institutes of Health). Hypoxia induction Hypoxia was induced using two complementary approaches: 1% O 2 2 2 2 2 2 Bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing for DNA methylation analysis Genomic DNA (1 μg) was subjected to sodium bisulfite conversion using the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Converted DNA was eluted in 40 μL of M-Elution Buffer, and 2 μL of this was used per PCR reaction. All bisulfite treatment and subsequent pyrosequencing were performed by the DNA Methylation Analysis Core Facility at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. PCR primers for pyrosequencing-based methylation analysis of BARD1 were designed using PyroMark Assay Design Software 2.0 (Qiagen, Germany). Briefly, a sequencing primer was selected within 1–5 base pairs of the targeted CpG sites, with an optimal annealing temperature of 40 ± 5°C. Forward and reverse primers were subsequently positioned upstream and downstream of the sequencing primer, respectively. All primer sequences and targeted regions are listed in Table S3 68 Plasmid design and construction of CRISPR/dCas9-based epigenetic editing system The CRISPR/dCas9-based epigenetic editing system was constructed using the Fuw-dCas9-Tet1CD plasmid (Addgene plasmid #84475), which encodes a catalytically inactive Cas9 fused to the catalytic domain of Tet1, as previously described. 69 http://www.addgene.org/ Table S3 Targeted demethylation liposomal delivery system DOPC and dCas9-TET1-sgRNA-BARD1 were mixed in the presence of excess tertiary butanol at a ratio of 1:10 (w/w) DNA/DOPC. Tween 20 was added to the mixture in a ratio of 1:19 Tween 20:DNA/DOPC. The mixture was vortexed, frozen in an acetone/dry ice bath, and lyophilized.
