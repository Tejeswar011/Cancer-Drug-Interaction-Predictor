Hepatic ketogenesis regulates lipid homeostasis via ACSL1-mediated fatty acid partitioning 18 7 2023 rs.3.rs-3147009 Research Square PMC10371136 37503004 Background & Aims Liver-derived ketone bodies play an essential role in energy homeostasis during fasting by supplying fuel to the brain and peripheral tissues. Ketogenesis also helps to remove excess acetyl-CoA generated from fatty acid oxidation, thereby protecting against diet-induced hepatic steatosis. Despite this, the role of ketogenesis in fasting-associated hepatocellular lipid metabolism has not been thoroughly investigated. Methods We used mice with liver-specific knockout of HMGCS2 mice to determine how ACSL1-mediated esterification contributes to fasting-induced steatosis and performed biochemical assays, gene expression profiling, Western blotting, and histologic analyses. We further investigated the association between HMGCS2 expression, lipid re-esterification, and steatosis using human primary hepatocytes and liver samples from patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. Results We show that ketogenic insufficiency, achieved through disrupting hepatic HMGCS2, worsens liver steatosis in both fasted chow-fed and high-fat-fed mice. Our findings indicate that hepatic steatosis arises from increased fatty acid partitioning to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) for re-esterification, a process mediated by acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1). Mechanistically, the accumulation of acetyl-CoA because of impaired hepatic ketogenesis drives the elevated translocation of ACSL1 to the ER. Furthermore, our study reveals heightened ER-localized ACSL1 and lipid re-esterification in human metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis cases exhibiting impaired hepatic ketogenesis. We also demonstrate that L-carnitine, which buffers excess acetyl-CoA, reduces ER-associated ACSL1 and alleviates hepatic steatosis. Conclusions Hepatic ketogenesis plays a crucial role in maintaining intracellular acetyl-CoA balance, regulating lipid partitioning, and preventing the development of fasting-induced hepatic steatosis.

Hepatic steatosis hinges on the balance between free fatty acid uptake, de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and very-low-density lipoprotein secretion. 1 , 2 3 3 3 , 4 5 6 7 8 Fasting serves as an apt model to dissect lipid partitioning mechanisms, because most fatty acids are partitioned to FAO via a controlled manner. 9 , 10 11 12 , 13 14 , 15 13 , 15 , 16 17 17 Our study uses conditional liver-specific HMGCS2 knockout mice to demonstrate that impairment in ketogenesis exacerbates fasting-induced hepatic steatosis in chow-fed and high-fat-fed mice. Notably, impairment in ketogenesis did not affect fatty acid uptake or de novo lipogenesis but FAO. Because elevation in free fatty acids from impaired FAO is toxic to cells, the enzyme acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1 (ACSL1) esterifies the fatty acids into a nontoxic acyl-CoAs. 18 , 19 20 Results Hepatic Ketogenesis Protects Against Fasting-induced Hepatic Steatosis Genetic studies dissecting the role of ketone bodies were performed in mice with constitutive knockout of hepatic HMGCS2, which are prone to severe hepatic steatosis and mitochondrial dysfunction at the neonatal age. 14 Hmgcs2 ΔLiv Hmgcs2 Hmgcs2 F/F Figure 1 A Figure 1 B C 12 Hmgcs2 F/F 12 Hmgcs2 F/F Hmgcs2 ΔLiv Figure 1 D E Hmgcs2 F/F Figure 1 F G Hmgcs2 ΔLiv Figure 1 G 21 Figure 1 Hepatic ketogenic insufficiency does not affect glucose levels.

A B C D E F G H I P t Discussion Perturbations in hepatic fatty acid metabolism emerge as a key risk factor driving various metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, and MASLD. An intricate interplay of increased free fatty acid influx, augmented lipogenesis, and impaired lipid disposal in the liver results in triglyceride accumulation, triggering hepatic steatosis. 46 , 62 , 63 64 In this study, we present evidence that mice with temporal disruption of hepatic ketogenesis exhibit severe steatosis on fasting. Ketogenesis is identified as a regulator of fatty acid partitioning via ER-associated ACSL1. We demonstrate that insufficient ketogenesis induces the accumulation of acetyl-CoA, leading to the ER translocation of ACSL1 and subsequent fatty acid esterification. Consequently, incoming fatty acids are misdirected for storage rather than undergoing FAO, because elevated acetyl-CoA levels from ketogenic insufficiency are misinterpreted as excessive FAO. Furthermore, LC supplementation in ketogenic-insufficient mice counteracts acetyl-CoA-mediated increase in ER-associated ACSL1 and triglyceride esterification ( Figure 12 I Previous studies have demonstrated the causal role of ketogenesis in fatty liver pathogenesis, particularly in neonates and adult mice with ketogenic insufficiency (via disruption of hepatic HMGCS2). 14 , 15 15 63 16 , 65 Fasting-mediated adipose tissue lipolysis and a drop in insulin levels coordinate to induce hepatic ketogenesis. Inhibition of adipose tissue ATGL is shown to decrease circulating ketone levels. 29 35 Fatty acids entering hepatocytes are immediately esterified into acyl-CoA by ACSL1. Although mitochondrial ACSL1 directs acyl-CoA for β-oxidation, 19 , 20 62 66 67 68 , 69 66 70 71 Mitochondrial membranes being impermeable to fatty acyl-CoA, acyl-CoA is esterified with LC to form acyl-carnitine. No export mechanism exists to excrete cellular acetyl-CoA and LC buffers acetyl-CoA forming acetyl-carnitine, which is excreted in the urine. 72 , 73 74 , 75 76 77 78 79 , 80 81 , 82 Conclusions Hepatic ketogenesis traditionally serves a selfless function in providing nutrients to other organs. 12 24 19 , 20 , 83 24 18 , 20 84 85 , 86 87 Study Limitations Although our study shows that ACSL1 exacerbates hepatic steatosis in ketogenic haploinsufficient mice, the mechanistic underpinnings of ACSL1 association with ER remains unclear. ACSL1 activity has been reported to be regulated by PTM, including phosphorylation and acetylation. 52 54 88 Materials and Methods Human MASH Subjects and Characteristics A total of 20 human subjects (10 MASH and 10 non-MASH) scheduled for liver biopsies to diagnose MASH were recruited by participating physicians at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (Pittsburgh, PA). All patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, such as no positive for viral hepatitis, Wilson disease, or any other causes of liver dysfunction. The patients were excluded if the alcohol consumption exceeded 20 g/week. The body mass index ranged from 19.15 to 38.41 and age from 33 to 68 years. All the patients were fasted at the time of biopsy. The patients with cirrhosis and MASH as the etiology were compared with the groups with no MASH diagnosis. MASH was diagnosed by pathologists based on steatosis [0 (<5%) – 3 (>66)], lobular inflammation [0 (none) - 3 (>4 foci/200x], hepatocyte ballooning [0 (none) - 2 (many/prominent ballooning)], and fibrosis [0 (none)- 4 (cirrhosis)]. Detailed characteristics of the patients with MASH and other diseases are outlined in Supplementary Table 1 Animal Studies We generated a Hmgcs2 F/F Hmgcs2 ΔLiv Hmgcs2 F/F pm am Hmgcs2 ΔLiv Acsl1 12 Human Primary Hepatocyte Isolation Primary hepatocytes were isolated from explanted human liver segments from patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation for decompensated liver cirrhosis caused by MASH. Specimens were obtained by the Human Synthetic Liver Biology Core at the Pittsburgh Liver Research Center under the protocol approved by the Human Research Review Committee and the Institutional Review Board (IRB STUDY20090069) at the University of Pittsburgh. Liver specimens were protected from ischemic injury by flushing with ice-cold University of Wisconsin solution immediately after resection, keeping them on ice, and transporting them immediately to the laboratory. Hepatocytes were isolated by a modified 3-step perfusion technique. Briefly, livers were flushed under a sterile biosafety hood through the hepatic vessels (recirculation technique) with prewarmed calcium-free Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (Sigma-Aldrich, H6648-1L) supplemented with 0.5 mM EGTA (Thermo Fisher, 50-255-956) and then with collagenase/protease solution (VitaCyte, 007-1010) until fully digested. The digestion time was 45–60 minutes. The digested liver was removed and immediately cooled with ice-cold Leibovitz's L-15 Medium (Invitrogen, 11415114) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, F4135). The cell suspension was centrifuged twice at 65 x g o Mouse Primary Hepatocyte Isolation Mouse primary hepatocytes were isolated from 6- to 8-week-old Hmgcs2 ΔLiv 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ g g g 6 De Novo Lipogenesis De novo lipogenesis was assessed as described in previous studies. 89 6 14 2 4 Fatty Acid Oxidation Assay FAO assay was performed as described in previous studies. 90 6 14 o 14 2 Hepatic Glycogen Assay Hepatic glycogen levels were measured using a glycogen assay kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc, San Diego, CA) as per the kit instructions.

Serum β-hydroxybutyrate levels were measured using a calorimetry kit following manufacturers' instructions (Cayman Chemical). Serum triglycerides and cholesterol levels were measured using colorimetric Infinity Triglyceride and Cholesterol kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Middletown, VA). Serum nonesterified fatty acid was quantified using a colorimetric assay (Fujifilm Wako Diagnostics, Lexington, MA). Serum L-lactate and glucagon levels were measured using L-lactate assay kit (Eton Bio, San Diego, CA) and Mouse glucagon enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Crystal Chem, Elk Grove Village, IL), respectively. Liver Triglyceride Assay Hepatic triglyceride levels were measured as described previously. 91 2 4 Thin Layer Chromatography TLC was performed as described in previous studies. 20 91 Liver Histology Liver tissue was excised and immediately fixed in 10% PBS-buffered formalin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). H&E staining was performed in 6-μm paraffin-embedded sections and the images were captured using an EVOS microscope. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described in previous studies. Briefly, paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and the antigen was retrieved using 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, 0.05% Tween20, pH 6.0. After cooling, the slides were permeabilized with TBST and treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 5 minutes. After several washings, the slides were blocked with 5% goat serum containing 1% BSA for 30 minutes. The slides were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies against F4/80 (1:250, Cell Signaling) and CD45 (1:250, Cell Signaling). After several washings, the slides were incubated with Dky Rabbit IgG Biotin secondary antibody (1:500, EMD Millipore) and developed using DAB peroxidase substrate kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The color development time was optimized by monitoring the signal under the microscope. The nuclei were stained with hematoxylin and the slides were mounted using Permount mounting medium (Fischer scientific) and the images were captured using a Nikon microscope. RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis, and qPCR Analysis Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using Mu-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). mRNA levels were analyzed using SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (ApexBio, Houston, TX) with QuantStudio 3 Station qPCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
