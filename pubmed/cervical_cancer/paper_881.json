The intestinal tract is particularly vulnerable to MPs exposure and accumulation. Radiotherapy often causes side effects such as radiation-induced intestinal injury (RIII). Although previous studies have shown that MPs exacerbate RIII by altering gut microbiota, their effect on the small intestine’s intrinsic sensitivity to radiation remains unclear. In this study, C57BL/6 mice were preexposed to MPs for a short period and then irradiated with 4 or 10 Gy to evaluate intestinal injury. Proteomic analysis of small intestine was performed to identify changes in protein expression. Short-term MPs exposure alone caused minimal intestinal damage. While 4 Gy irradiation did not cause significant intestinal injury, 10 Gy irradiation induced pronounced inflammation, increased epithelial apoptosis, and disrupted villus and lamina propria architecture. Importantly, the mice preexposed to MPs exhibited significantly increased sensitivity to RIII. Furthermore, prior MPs exposure significantly exacerbated RIII at 4 Gy but had no obvious influence on RIII at 10 Gy in C57BL/6 mice. The reason might be that the severe radiation-induced injury caused by 10 Gy could obscure the additional effects of prior MPs exposure. Proteomic analysis implicated the ‘PI3K-Akt signaling’ pathway as a key mediator of this effect. Indeed, treatment with a PI3K inhibitor could attenuate the MPs-driven susceptibility of small intestine to radiation. These findings underscore the need to minimize MPs exposure in patients undergoing radiotherapy. microplastics irradiation intestinal injury intestinal proteomics pi3k signaling pathway Research Project of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University 2023JKZDZ05 National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/501100001809 32371290 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes INTRODUCTION Microplastics (MPs) pollution refers to plastic particles less than 5 mm in size, originating from the degradation of larger plastic debris, abrasion of plastic products, industrial activities, and the release of synthetic fibers during laundering [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The gut, as the primary interface for digestion and absorption, is particularly vulnerable to microplastic exposure [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 Radiation, particularly ionizing radiation, is well known for its ability to cause damage to rapidly dividing cells, such as those in the intestinal epithelium [ 17 18 19 The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of MPs exposure on RIII in C57BL/6 mice. It is hypothesized that MPs exposure may increase the vulnerability of intestinal tissues to radiation-induced damage in these mice. To explore this interaction, proteomic analysis of the small intestine was conducted to elucidate the complex effects of MPs exposure on RIII, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. The findings from this study enhance the understanding of MPs toxicity and highlight the critical importance of environmental conservation efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and chemicals Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. Upon arrival, they were acclimated in the Zhejiang Chinese Medical University animal facility for 1 week, then randomly assigned to experimental groups. Mice were maintained under a 12-h light/dark cycle at 25 ± 1°C, and 50 ± 5% humidity, with ad libitum access to food and water. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University (Approval No. 20230918-22). Fluorescent, single-molecule polystyrene microplastics (CAS: 55136 microplastics) with a 5 μm particle size were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. The 5 μm size was selected to facilitate handling and to exclude nanoscale effects. Prior to use, MPs were sonicated and suspended in distilled water at the desired concentration.

During irradiation, lead shields protected the cervical, thoracic, and lower limb regions, leaving only the abdominal area exposed. A 6 MV X-ray beam was delivered with a source-to-surface distance of 100 cm, and a coincident light field was used to verify accurate positioning. The field uniformity was calibrated prior to each session, and mice were placed at a consistent distance from the radiation source. Five days after irradiation, animals were euthanized and small intestinal tissues were collected for subsequent analyses. MPs exposure MPs were administered by oral gavage at 1.0 mg/kg body weight per day for five consecutive days. This dose was chosen to approximate human ingestion rates, estimated at 40.1 μg/kg/day for adults and 87.8 μg/kg/day for children [ 20 2 2 Experimental design Experiment I As illustrated in Fig. 1b n n Experiment II As shown in Fig. 8a n Fig. 8 Effects of a PI3K inhibitor on MPs-sensitized radiation injury in the small intestine.

Tissues were weighed and homogenized at 0.05 g per ml of lysis buffer using a high-speed homogenizer. Homogenates were centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatants were collected. IL-6 and IL-17 levels were quantified with Multisciences enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Hangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total protein in each supernatant was measured by the micro-Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method, and cytokine concentrations were expressed as pg cytokine per mg total protein. Pathological histology Small intestines were harvested at designated time points postirradiation, flushed with ice-cold PBS, and a segment fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed tissues were dehydrated through an ethanol series, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 3 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and examined by light microscopy. Small intestinal injury was scored on a 0–5 scale adapted from Chang et al. 21 Ki67 immunohistochemistry Paraffin-embedded small intestine sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series to distilled water. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating sections in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min. Antigen retrieval was carried out by pressure-cooking sections in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 3 min, then allowing them to cool to room temperature. Non-specific binding was blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-Ki67 primary antibody (Servicebio, CAS: GB111141 TUNEL immunofluorescence Apoptotic cells in the small intestine tissues were detected using a TUNEL Staining Kit (Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Briefly, paraffin-embedded sections were first permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min, then incubated at 37°C for 1 h with a labeling mixture of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP), and reaction buffer in a volume ratio of 2:5:50. Following incubation, slides were counterstained with DAPI and examined under a Leica fluorescence microscope. TUNEL-positive (green-fluorescent) cells were quantified in at least 30 well-oriented crypts per mouse. 4D-DIA quantitative proteomic analysis and data processing Frozen small intestine tissue samples were retrieved and placed on ice. The study employed 4D-DIA quantitative proteomics to analyze protein profiles in these samples, following the protocol outlined in the previous work [ 7 Equal amounts of peptides were dried, resolubilized with 0.1% TFA, and analyzed using an EASY-nLC system coupled to a timsTOF Pro2 mass spectrometer (Bruker) at Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). DIA data were acquired in DIA-PASEF mode with specific gradient and flow rate settings. Spectronaut (Version 14) was used to process DIA-PASEF data, correcting retention times using iRT standards. Quantification was based on six peptides per protein and three ions per peptide. The analysis parameters included: Protein FDR ≤0.01, Peptide FDR ≤0.01, Peptide Confidence ≥99%, and XIC width ≤75 ppm. Only proteins with unique peptides were considered for identification. Bioinformatic analysis was conducted using the Majorbio Cloud platform ( https://cloud.majorbio.com P t http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ P Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Comparisons between the blank and MPs groups, as well as between the MPs + 4 Gy and MPs + 4 Gy + PI3K-IN-30 groups, were conducted using two-tailed independent samples t-tests. Additionally, quantitative analyses comparing the blank, 4 Gy, and 10 Gy groups and the MPs, MPs + 4 Gy, and MPs + 10 Gy groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was defined as P RESULTS Effects of MPs on the small intestine and its proteomics As depicted in Fig. 1c Figure 1d e Fig. 1f–i Fig. 1f j Proteomic analysis of small intestinal tissue identified 187 DEPs between blank and MP-exposed mice, with 78 upregulated and 109 downregulated in the MPs group ( Fig. 2a P < Fig. 2b Fig. 2c d Fig. 2c Fig. 2 Effects of MPs on small intestine proteomics.

(a) Volcano plot displaying P P Effects of irradiation on the small intestine of C57BL/6 mice preexposed to MPs To assess how prior MPs exposure alters radiation response, C57BL/6 mice were first given MPs and then irradiated with 4 Gy or 10 Gy. Both doses produced significantly greater intestinal injury in MPs-exposed mice, as shown by upregulated IL-6 and IL-17 in small intestinal tissue ( Fig. 5a b Fig. 5c–e Fig. 5c–f Fig. 5c g Fig. 5 Effects of irradiation on the small intestine of C57BL/6 mice preexposed to MPs.

Comparison of the MPs and MPs + 4 Gy groups identified 243 DEPs, with 115 upregulated and 128 downregulated in the irradiated group ( Fig. 6a Fig. 6b Supplementary Fig. S1 Fig. 6 Effects of irradiation on the small intestine proteomics in C57BL/6 mice preexposed to MPs. (a) Volcano plot displaying P P In MPs preexposed mice, 10 Gy irradiation significantly altered the small intestinal proteome, yielding 357 DEPs (108 upregulated and 249 downregulated, Fig. 6c Fig. 6d Supplementary Fig. S2 Overall, whereas 4 Gy alone failed to enrich any pathways in normal mice, the same dose in MPs preexposed mice triggered significant enrichment of three key pathways. In MPs-exposed mice, 10 Gy irradiation not only recapitulated the immunodeficiency signature observed at 4 Gy but also uniquely implicated exocrine pancreatic pathways. This highlights an exacerbated vulnerability in both immune and digestive functions within the irradiated, MPs-sensitized intestine. Effects of preexposure to MPs on RIII in C57BL/6 mice To further investigate the impact of prior MPs exposure on RIII, we compared the effects of radiation alone with those of combined radiation and MPs exposure. At a 4 Gy radiation dose, prior MPs exposure significantly exacerbated RIII in C57BL/6 mice, as evidenced by increased intestinal IL-6 and IL-17 levels, elevated pathological scores, increased TUNEL + + Fig. 7 + Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Effects of pre-MPs exposure on RIII in C57BL/6 mice.

At a 4 Gy radiation dose, prior MPs exposure significantly profoundly upregulated 217 proteins and downregulated 113 proteins ( Supplementary Fig. S3a Supplementary Fig. S3b Supplementary Fig. S3c Effects of a PI3K inhibitor on 4 Gy irradiation-induced small intestinal injury in C57BL/6 mice preexposed to MPs To clarify how MPs exposure amplified small intestinal sensitivity to radiation, we treated MPs preexposed C57BL/6 mice with the selective PI3K inhibitor PI3K-IN-30 before administering 4 Gy irradiation. PI3K-IN-30 markedly attenuated the MP-exacerbated damage, as shown by decreased IL-6 and IL-17 levels, lower histopathological scores, reduced apoptosis, and restored villus height, Ki67-positive epithelial proliferation, and surviving crypts per circumference ( Fig. 8 DISCUSSION Both irradiation exposure and MPs contamination pose significant environmental and health risks. Although prior investigations have largely examined radiation and MP exposure separately [ 22 23 A recent study by Chen et al. 24 et al. Brief MP exposure alone caused minimal small intestinal injury, likely due to the short duration. However, proteomic analysis revealed altered protein expression, with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway the only significantly enriched pathway. Given its pivotal role in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and survival [ 25 26 27 28 29 29 30 31 32 33 26 34 35 36 In our radiation experiments, 4 Gy caused minimal intestinal damage, whereas 10 Gy induced pronounced injury. Proteomic analysis revealed that only 10 Gy—in contrast to 4 Gy—significantly enriched the ‘primary immunodeficiency’ and ‘neuroactive ligand–receptor interaction’ pathways. The ‘primary immunodeficiency’ pathway was essential for maintaining immune homeostasis [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 We next examined how prior MPs exposure influences RIII. Similar to Chen et al. 24 44 45 46 Nonetheless, this study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the exclusive use of male mice may constrain the generalizability of the findings to female populations. Second, the investigation was confined to 5 μm polystyrene microplastics and did not assess other particle sizes or polymer types. Third, while PI3K inhibitors were examined specifically for their role in MPs-aggravated RIII, their independent effects on RIII were not evaluated. Finally, as pentobarbital provided no analgesia or muscle relaxation, its use as a sole anesthetic might lead to unmitigated pain during TAI process. CONCLUSION In conclusion, this study demonstrated that prior MPs exposure markedly increases the mouse intestine’s susceptibility to radiation-induced injury via dysregulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway. While these findings deepen our mechanistic insight, three crucial next steps are needed: (i) confirm these effects in human cohorts or organoid models; (ii) Systematically assess interactions between MPs and other radiation types (e.g. neutrons, UV-C); (iii) Define the specific intestinal protein targets and metabolic circuits through which PI3K-Akt signaling mediates MPs-sensitized injury. Taken together, our results underscore the importance of minimizing MPs exposure in cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy and more broadly illustrate how MPs can synergize with other environmental hazards to amplify tissue damage.
