Our study looked at rare occurrence of the Mh Study design. In total, 4 confirmed infected ( Mh Table 1 Mh Mh Blood collection and deidentification. Consented donors were deidentified at the clinic. Approximately 10 mL of venous blood was drawn into sodium-heparin tube (green top) and rapidly inverted 7 or 8 times to mix, at the time of donor recruitment. The blood was brought to research lab with 2 hours of withdrawal, for downstream processing. Downstream processing was started immediately. Bacterial culture and heat inactivation. Mh Mab Mab 6 Ex-situ whole blood stimulation assay. Whole blood (450 mL) from HC as well as Mh Mh Mab Cytokine analysis. Cytokine/chemokine secreted in human plasma post invitro assay was analyzed via MILLIPLEX Multiplex Assay kit (MilliporeSigma) as per the manufacturer’s protocol and the assay plate was read using Bio-plex Luminex (Bio-Rad). Whole blood DNA isolation. DNA was prepared immediately upon arrival of whole blood from HCs and infected donors, and subjected to the DNA isolation according to manufacturer protocol (Qiagen DNA isolation kit; Cat # 69504), quantitated using Nanodrop microvolume spectrophotometer (ND-100, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and submitted for whole exome sequencing (WES) at the genomics core of the McDonnell Genome Institute, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, USA. Exome sequencing and data processing. Germline samples from 4 Mh 110 RNA-Seq of ex situ stimulated donors blood cells. Cells from whole blood stimulation assay were cryopreserved which were thawed and subjected to RNA preparation and bulk sequencing. RNA-Seq processing and analysis. RNA was prepared and the sequenced Fastq files were processed as previously described ( 111 112 Supplemental Methods Supplemental Table 1 111 113 P In vitro GATA2 knockdown. PBMCs from independent healthy donors were left untreated, treated with Scrambled (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # 4390843) or human GATA2 siRNA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat # 4392420). The PBMCs (n =4) were transfected using the HiPerFect transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Cat # 301704). The duration of treatment and the concentration of siRNA were titrated to attain at least 50% knockdown of the GATA2 protein which was confirmed by Flow-cytometry staining of GATA2. The cells treated with optimized concentration of 200 nM of the siRNA for 24 hours; then, the reaction was stopped by adding complete media (10% human AB serum) and cells allowed to recover overnight. The next day cells were stimulated with HK Mh n n Statistics. The appropriate statistical analysis is explained in the sections as they appear for Exome sequencing and RNA-Seq. There was no blinding needed for the analysis. For analysis of the cytokine data, 1-way ANOVA was applied to compare among the groups for with Tukey’s test for multiple testing correction.
