However, the 90% minimum effective volume (MEV 90 90 90 90 Methods Patients with indications for an SGB were recruited, without restrictions on sex or disease type. In this two-part study, we first determined the MEV 90 90 90 90 Results In total, 110 patients were enrolled (58 and 52 patients in the MEV 90 90 90 99 90 Conclusions For ultrasound-guided SGB in adults, we have determined the MEV 90 90 Anesthetics, local Dose-response relationship, drug Lidocaine Nerve block Stellate ganglion Ultrasonography pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction The stellate ganglion is a part of the cervical sympathetic nervous system. It's formed by the merging of the inferior cervical ganglion and the T1 ganglion, and it sits between the C6 and C7 vertebrae. It contains sympathetic preganglionic fibers that innervate the head and neck, and sympathetic postganglionic fibers that innervate the upper limbs and heart [ 1 2 Stellate ganglion blocks (SGBs) are widely used in clinical practice to treat a wide range of painful and non-painful conditions, such as pain in the head, face, ear, nose, throat, mouth, neck, shoulder, and upper limbs, as well as refractory angina pectoris, arrhythmia, and depression [ 3 6 7 8 9 While the use of ultrasonography has helped clinicians to ensure the safety of nerve blocks, gaps remain regarding the optimal doses (volume and concentration) of local anesthetic to use in nerve blocks. Determining the lowest effective dose of a local anesthetic for ultrasound-guided SGB, i.e., the dose that could minimize the adverse effects caused by a local anesthetic overdose while ensuring a good blocking effect, forms the basis for the clinically rational use of this drug treatment. Nevertheless, the minimum effective volume and concentration of local anesthetic to use for ultrasound-guided SGB have not yet been reported. The biased-coin design (BCD), up-and-down sequential allocation method (UDM) allows determination of the optimal drug dose by minimizing the number of trials required as well as the resource consumption, and is the preferred study-design method for higher-percentile dose-effect estimation [ 10 11 12 90 90 Materials and Methods This study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (No. UHCT230596) and adhered to the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration 2013. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The trial was registered prior to patient enrollment at https://www.chictr.org.cn Study population Patients who underwent ultrasound-guided SGBs at the Department of Pain in Union Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, due to head, face, or upper-limb pain, insomnia, or facial paralysis, who were aged 18–80 years, had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class Ⅰ–Ⅲ, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.0–27.9 kg/m 2 Ultrasound-guided SGB After entering the treatment room, intravenous access was routinely established; oxygen was administered by nasal cannula at 2 L/min; and electrocardiography, and noninvasive blood pressure and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 A high-frequency linear array probe (Labat PG, Shenzhen Wisonic Medical Technology Co., Ltd.) was placed at approximately the level of the cricoid cartilage. This allowed localization of key anatomical landmarks for the SGB, including the common carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, the cervical transverse process and its protruding anterior and posterior nodules, as well as the long neck muscle covered by the prevertebral fascia that is located on the superficial surface of the transverse process. The ultrasound probe was then moved caudally until the anterior nodule of the C6 transverse process disappeared, the puncture path was not obstructed by bony structures, and no important neurovascular structures were present in the puncture path. After determining the skin-puncture point, applying local disinfection, and laying a sterile dressing, the operator proceeded with in-plane insertion of a 20-gauge short-beveled puncture needle. Under ultrasound guidance, the puncture needle was passed through the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the anterior scalene muscle, to the lower part of the common carotid artery, the surface of the longus colli, and the deep surface of the prevertebral fascia. The operator then injected lidocaine slowly after checking that no blood or gas was withdrawn [ 13 14 The MEV 90 The expert consensus for SGB therapy in China (2022) recommends using a lidocaine concentration of 0.5%–1.0% for ultrasound-guided SGBs [ 13 90 Sequential allocation in the BCD-UDM was performed using a computer-generated list of random numbers prepared in Excel (Microsoft Corp.) by a statistician. Investigator accessed the list and prepared the corresponding syringes for lidocaine in the drug-preparation room, and then transported the syringes to a treatment room. In this way, the patient, physician, and caregiver were blinded to the volume allocation. The sign of a successful SGB was defined as the presence of Horner's syndrome on the blocked side, or a temperature increase of ≥ 1°C in the head, face, or upper limbs on the blocked side, as indicated by infrared thermography [ 15 16 Finally, using R statistical software ( https://www.r-project.org/ 90 99 The MEC 90 Based on the results obtained with 1% lidocaine SGBs in the first part of the study, we extrapolated the MEV 99 The same statistical method was used to calculate the MEC 90 99 The detailed flow of this study is depicted in Fig. 1 Data collection and outcome assessment General patient information, including age, sex, BMI, ASA class, and underlying diseases, were recorded. A separate investigator (a physician who did not perform the nerve block) recorded the occurrence of Horner's syndrome in patients within 10 min after SGB. Infrared thermography was used to capture the changes in skin temperature of the head, face, and upper limb on the blocked side before and 5 and 10 min after block administration, for comprehensive assessment of whether the SGB block was successful. The occurrence of adverse reactions, including hoarseness, dysphagia, upper-limb weakness on the block side, local hematoma, pneumothorax, and local anesthetic poisoning, after the block was recorded. The heart rate, SpO 2 Statistical analysis A two-stage BCD-UDM design was used in this study. Statistically, at least 45 patients with successful blockade were require to calculate the MEV 90 90 17 18 https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=isotone 18 18 https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cir Results Overall, 110 patients were included in this study; 58 participated in the first part of the study (minimum effective volume) and 52 participated in the second part of the study (minimum effective concentration). The BCD sequences for lidocaine volume and concentration are shown in Fig. 2 Effective volume of lidocaine In the study on the effective volume of lidocaine, the mean age of the 58 patients was 52.3 years, and 67.2% of this group were female. SGBs were successful in 45 of the patients and failed in 13 patients. No significant differences were found between the successful and failed SGB groups in terms of age, sex, BMI, or ASA class. The general information of this study group is shown in Table 1 Effective concentration of lidocaine In the second part of the study, investigating the effective concentration of lidocaine for SGB, the results of the volumetric study were used. Fifty-two patients were included in this part of the study; in 45 of these, the SGB was successful, while it failed in seven. The mean age of the group was 46.5 years, while 67.3% were female. The descriptive statistics of the group are presented in Table 2 The MEV 90 99 90 99 The MEV 90 90 99 99 Overall incidence of side effects after ultrasound-guided SGBs In the 1% lidocaine ultrasound-guided SGB MEV 90 90 Infrared Thermography Findings Infrared thermography demonstrated progressive temperature increases on the blocked side in successful SGB cases, as shown in Fig. 3A 90 Figs. 3B D 90 Figs. 3E G Discussion SGBs are widely used in clinical practice and has therapeutic value in many diseases, such as postherpetic neuralgia, insomnia, tinnitus, and facial paralysis. However, the dose of local anesthetics currently used in ultrasound-guided SGBs in clinical practice remains empirical. In the present study, the MEV 90 90 90 90 Fig. 2 An SGB involves the injection of local anesthetics into the tissues around the stellate ganglion and its vicinity, including the cervical sympathetic trunk, cervical sympathetic ganglion, preganglionic and postganglionic nerves, and their innervation areas [ 19 1 2 13 13 19 20 90 90 In pharmacology, the smallest dose of a drug that can cause pharmacological effects is called the lowest effective dose (minimum effective volume or concentration). The experimental designs commonly used to determine this dose include the fixed-dose grouping method, the up-and-down sequential method (UDM), and the BCD-UDM, among which using the UDM for MEV 50 50 21 22 90 90 99 99 50 50 90 90 23 24 90 90 10 10 10 21 23 Although the BCD-UDM design can reduce the required sample size in drug studies, a minimum of 45 successful responses (a value greater than 40 and a multiple of 9) are necessary to estimate the 90% effective dose (ED 90 25 26 95 99 50 90 99 Lidocaine is a commonly used amide-type, intermediate-acting local anesthetic, with the characteristics of having a rapid onset of action, strong penetration, and wide dispersion, without causing obvious vasodilatation. Lidocaine is widely used in surface, local infiltration, epidural, and peripheral nerve block anesthesia, and is also one of the most commonly used local anesthetics in SGBs [ 27 28 90 90 Several previous studies have explored the optimal dose of local anesthetics for SGB; however, the vast majority were randomized controlled studies using fixed gradients. Lee et al. [ 29 30 31 On the other hand, few studies have investigated the concentration of local anesthetics used for SGB, Hardy [ 32 99 90 The appearance of Horner syndrome on the blocked side indicates successful SGB. This manifests as pupil narrowing, eyelid ptosis, sunken eyes, little or no sweating on the ipsilateral side, conjunctival congestion, facial flushing, nasal congestion, and elevated skin temperature [ 33 13 34 35 36 37 38 39 Fig. 3 Our study had some limitations. First, the MEV 90 90 40 2 In conclusion, lidocaine can be safely used for ultrasound-guided SGB.
