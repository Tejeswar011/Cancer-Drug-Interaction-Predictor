HIGHLIGHTS • Registries are valuable tools supporting clinical cancer screening services. • The study identified factors affecting maintenance of the cancer screening registry. • The screening/surveillance needs of 5% of patients/year changed and needed updating. • Program staff read endoscopy and pathology text reports to update the registry. • There were discontinuities in care due to ingress and egress from the clinic. Introduction This study was aimed to describe the epidemiology of colon cancer screening in an underserved population. This is a cohort study, conducted in a primary care clinic in a safety-net public hospital. Methods Patients aged 49–78 years were categorized by initial screening status and followed over 28 months. Status was categorized into the following 3 groups with 8 subgroups: screening eligible (up to date or not up to date), non-screening eligible (Personal history of colon cancer, surveillance for colon cancer, work-up in progress, poor health status, and indeterminate), and refusal. Patient egress was defined as no primary care visit for 12 months or <2 primary care visits separated by 60 days over 24 months. Results Of 1,074 patients reviewed, 856 (80%) were screening eligible, 177 (16%) were non-screening eligible, and 41 (4%) refused screening. Over 28 months, most patients retained in the practice did not change category ( n n Conclusions Maintaining a colon cancer registry was complex owing to the dynamic nature of screening status and unstable primary care attendance. Regional integration of electronic health records could substantially reduce manual effort.

Although provider communication increases screening, 11 12 13 14 15 16 , 17 18 Each approach relies on registries to track a patient’s status, including lost to follow-up. 19 20 19 , 21 22 23 18 , 24 Beginning in 2010, the authors initiated a colon cancer screening program, applying the Chronic Care Model 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 In addition, the authors used the registry for case management of patients due for diagnostic colonoscopies. EHR prompts were not used because the registry was a stand-alone project database, and integration of the detailed colon cancer screening status and logic into the EHR was not considered feasible. In 2014, the authors undertook a retrospective assessment of the registry looking at 2 time points spanning 28 months—January 1, 2012, and April 30, 2014—to observe how often categorization of the screening eligibility of patients changed between these 2 time points. The authors describe their findings and the implications for development of a registry to support colon cancer screening. METHODS Population In 2012, the authors enrolled patients aged ≥18 years empaneled in the GMC, a primary care internal medicine clinic of Cook County Health, the safety-net provider for Cook County. To monitor the screening-eligible population, a web-based registry was built that interfaced with a research data warehouse that comprehensively captured clinical data from the EHR. 33 After chart review and manual registry updates, the screening status of each patient was categorized ( Table 1 Table 1 Colon Cancer Screening Categories Table 1 Category Description Screening eligible Screen eligible, Up- todate Individuals aged 50–75 years, with average risk for colon cancer, and up to date with chosen screening method Screening eligible and Not up-to-date Individuals aged 50–75 years, with average risk for colon cancer, and never screened for colon cancer or were not up to date with chosen screening method Non-screening eligible Surveillance Individuals with high risk for colon cancer as follows: (1) history of high-risk colonic polyps, (2) inflammatory bowel disease, (3) high-risk family history, (4) any condition requiring regular diagnostic colonoscopy Work-up in progress Individuals having symptom/sign-driven colonoscopy evaluation (e.g., bleeding, weight loss, anemia) Poor health status Interruption of screening due to prognosis of less than 5–7 years or too sick to undergo routine preventive services, including colon cancer screening Indeterminate Unable to accurately categorize (e.g., reported assessment outside CCH and record retrieval needed to appropriately categorize screening status) Personal history of colon cancer Previous or present diagnosis of colon cancer Refused Refused Individuals refusing colon cancer screening assessment, status unknown CCH, Cook County Health. The registry was populated on January 1, 2012, with the addition of patients who newly met the criteria of active patients (Ingress). The authors removed patients who no longer met the clinic visit criteria for active patients, who no longer met the age criteria for screening, or who had died (egress patients). The authors could not capture the specific reasons for egress owing to resource constraints. The authors studied the active patient population (those enrolled on project and initiation and those who entered the cohort [ingress]) for a 28-month period from January 1, 2012, to April 30, 2014; all patients in the sampled population were present at the time of project termination. Measures The authors adapted 2008 USPSTF recommendations to determine the up-to-date status of the screening population in their clinic. 34 The medicine clinic population was categorized into screening eligible, nonscreening eligible, and refused, following the recommendations of 2008 USPSTF guidelines 26 35 Table 1 Statistical Analysis To validate registry data and reliably capture screening status as reflected in the registry at 2 points (T0 and T28) in time, the authors selected a 10% simple random sample from the registry population. The authors grouped the random sample of active patients into screening categories at the time that they became an active patient (T0) and, again, at the time of the 28-month follow-up period (T28). Screening status in the registry was reviewed and validated independently by 6 staff members: 2 physicians, 2 research assistants, 1 nurse clinician, and 1 data analyst. The authors performed descriptive analyses to evaluate how often patients’ colon cancer screening status changed over time. They categorized patients into the mutually exclusive colon cancer screening categories mentioned earlier at times T0 and T28. For people who moved between categories over the 28-month interval, the authors describe the relative frequency of these transitions and graphically display the changes among categories over time. Data were imported into IBM SPSS (Version 25.0) for all analyses. The statistical analysis was started in February 2016. The data were analyzed, results were obtained, and analysis was completed in November 2017. Generation of the Sankey diagram demonstrating the flow between initial and final screening status categorizations was performed in Jupyter Notebooks using the plotly.graphobjects and pandas libraries in Python (Version 3.9.13). RESULTS In 2012, there were approximately 15,000 unique screening-aged GMC patients, of whom 13,361 were in the registry. At the beginning of the study—January 1, 2012—3,544 patients who met the definition of active GMC patients were added to the registry (ingress). The authors removed 6,259 patients from the registry because they had lost their status as active GMC patients (egress). After accounting for egress and ingress, the registry had 10,646 patients, from whom the authors sampled ∼10% (1,074 patients) for chart review ( Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 1 The dynamic nature of the colon cancer screening population.

Figure 2 *A total of 125 of 1,074 (12%) patients followed from January 2012 to April 2014 changed categories. Other changes between the major categories for colon cancer screening status were less common ( Figure 2 Among the 363 patients who were screening eligible and up to date at T0, after 28 months, a total of 549 screenings had been performed, as follows: colonoscopy ( n n n n DISCUSSION The technology implemented in this study enabled systematic approach to colon cancer screening and facilitated the management of colon cancer screening program in primary care clinics. The authors defined a screening-eligible population and used the registry as a platform for case management and monitoring of the population's screening status. They developed a categorization scheme for colon cancer screening, which was clinically meaningful and comprehensive. To improve the rate of colon cancer screening, initially, the authors focused on screen-eligible patients; they offered individualized brief colon cancer education and options for screening modalities at intervals recommended by USPTF. The authors used this registry to case manage patients due for diagnostic evaluations on the basis of screening results and to resolve the indeterminate category. The authors did not use the registry to case manage those in the surveillance category; however, it would be important to also intervene on these patients to ensure timely follow-up evaluations. Prior to the authors’ initiative, colon cancer screening was provider driven, highly variable, and less reliable. Patient navigation and education play a very important role in screening uptake. 29 , 36 , 37 38 , 39 Applying the definition for active GMC patients, the authors identified substantial ingress and egress to the registry over the 24-month evaluation period. Some ingress and egress into a colon cancer screening registry are expected as patients age in, age out, have lapses in primary care, transfer care to another healthcare facility, or die. Because most persons age into Medicare during the time period for colon cancer screening, changes in insurance status often leads to changes in access and site of care. In addition, high rates of patient migration between medical sites are common throughout the U.S. owing to insurance and job changes, geographic relocation, or dissatisfaction in care. As an urban public hospital, the authors provide care for a unique population who may not be representative of other care settings. The substantial ingress and egress reported in this study may have been in part due to the launch of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010; some newly insured patients had more options to choose their site of medical care. There exists a complex relationship between work and health insurance that along with how healthcare policy such as ACA can alter patient–provider relationships. 40 15 Although it is not common for older patients to change their primary care physicians, changes in the healthcare system might force them to change their primary care physicians. 41 29 42 , 43 42 43 44 One potential solution is to have a regional data warehouse specific for endoscopies and associated pathologic findings to aggregate and share cancer screening data. Although the number of successful implementations is limited owing to obstacles faced with interoperability among major EMR vendors, advanced health information exchanges are valuable and could provide a centralized data repository for patients eligible for colon cancer screening. 45 46 47 48 49 50 , 51 As part of development of a colon cancer screening electronic registry, having a clinically meaningful and comprehensive categorization scheme is necessary. The authors developed such a scheme ( Table 1 Healthy people 2030 7 When the authors established the registry, most age-appropriate patients were eligible for screening. After 28 months, eligibility decreased primarily owing to performance of screening colonoscopy, but some patients left the screen-eligible category owing to refusal to continue screening or being deemed in poor health. Overall, approximately 1 of 8 patients changed screening categories. Most commonly, screen-eligible patients moved into the surveillance or work-up-in-progress (awaiting a diagnostic colonoscopy) categories. Not surprisingly, graduation from poor health status to screening eligible was rare. Some patients moved from initial refusal to participation in the active screening population, supporting encouraging those who initially refuse to reconsider screening while also respecting their decisions. Although 100% of surveillance patients remained in this category, none were diagnosed with cancer; it was beyond the scope of the study to capture whether these patients received timely follow-up. Had the authors more actively case managed the surveillance category, it is possible that additional patients would have changed their screening category. Without case management or medical record innovations, the accuracy of a colon cancer screening registry will rapidly degrade. Although an EHR can facilitate automated identification of patients eligible for colon cancer screening and engage patients electronically through a patient portal, 52 Tracking the changes in categorization within the registry is essential but challenging. Within the random sample, the authors documented a 12% change in category over 28 months, an ∼5% change per year. This substantial recategorization reflects a rapid decay in the designation obtained during initial registry enrollment. Using the current EHR system, registry maintenance required investments in personnel to manually review charts and reports. Bias in estimating screening colonoscopies exists; there can be underestimation due to lack of capturing colonoscopy or pathology reports from outside institutions or overestimation through erroneous self-reporting of colonoscopy completion. 53 Limitations Limitations are that this study was completed in a single safety-net institution and may not generalize. For example, the authors had relatively limited access to colonoscopy for screening. Therefore, the findings may have less relevance to institutions in which colonoscopy plays a larger role in colorectal cancer screening. Another limitation is that the project was completed in 2014. Despite the program being implemented 10 years prior to manuscript submission, the types of screening options offered have not changed significantly; the authors have not eliminated any general screening modalities (biochemical and/or procedural). Most importantly, the categories that the authors defined for colon cancer screening status remains unchanged and are broadly applicable to screening programs for other cancers. The authors believe that the dynamic nature of cancer screening status will be similar to what the authors developed. It is critical that quality-improvement programs recognize the challenges of establishing an accurate denominator in the context of highly dynamic categorizations. Another limitation is that the authors did not collect data on the reasons for patient egress and ingress into the registry. This study was conducted during the time frame of roll out of ACA, which likely affected the proportion who ingress and egress patients. Finally, the registry did not capture potentially important covariates (e.g., education level, income, and insurance status) that could have affected the acceptance of colon cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS The authors raise 2 major concerns that impacted the building and maintenance of a colon cancer screening registry. One was the movement of patients into and out of the health system and the resulting concern that information about their screening status is lost in transfer of care. To address this, the authors recommend a health information exchange that shares screening records, including colonoscopy findings and pathology reports, across institutions. The second concern is that the screening categorization changed over time, mostly owing to colonoscopy findings and secondarily owing to changes in patients’ health status or their preference to not participate in colon cancer screening. To promote patient-level case management and population-level metrics, the authors recommend adoption of structured colonoscopy reports to allow registries to capture procedure dates and findings critical for determining screening status. By improving data capture, the registry will need less manual maintenance and can be more readily harnessed to guide improvement in screening, case management, and surveillance.
