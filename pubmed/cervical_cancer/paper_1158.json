The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is an intracellular signal transduction mechanism that is activated by ER stress and upregulates many proteins, including angiogenesis factors like VEGF and HIF-1α. This suggests that UPR genes and pathways may drive retinal angiogenesis. Here, we tested the role of the UPR regulator Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) in pathological and developmental retinal angiogenesis.

Initially, the developing eye is nourished by the hyaloid vasculature, a transient network of vitreous vessels that regresses as the retinal vasculature forms. Retinal blood vessels first sprout from the optic nerve head and grow radially toward the periphery, guided by hypoxia-triggered angiogenic signals from avascular areas 1 7 8 10 11 13 5 14 A growing body of evidence implicates Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) signaling as a molecular mechanism driving neovascularization 15 19 20 28 29 30 16 31 32 23 29 33 23 34 Atf6 −/− Atf6 −/− 35 36 37 Atf6 −/− 36 38 Atf6 −/− Atf6 −/− 39 40 41 42 43 In this study, we investigate ATF6’s role specifically in retinal blood vessel development in a pathological retinal neovascularization OIR model and during normal developmental physiological intraocular hypoxia.

Next, we examined the morphology and architecture of the developing blood vessels in more detail at P7 when we found reduced angiogenesis. We quantified vascular branch density in both the superficial and deep retinal layers. Branch density was measured in retinal areas of 250 μm x 250 μm located 250 μm (central), 750 μm (mid-peripheral), and 1250 μm (peripheral) from the optic disc (Fig. 5 5 Atf6 −/− Atf6 +/+ p two-way ANOVA 5 Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− 5 63 66 Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− 5 Atf6 −/− Atf6 +/+ p Student’s t-test 5 Atf6 −/− Discussion In this study, we explored the role of ATF6 in retinal neovascularization using the OIR model, hypothesizing that ATF6 drives pathological angiogenesis. Hypoxia, a known trigger for neovascularization, activates UPR pathways like IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, which in turn elevate factors like VEGF to promote angiogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that Atf6-deficient mice exhibit reduced blood vessel formation and significantly improved visual function post-hypoxia. Our RNA-Seq analysis showed significant downregulation of angiogenesis-related gene sets in Atf6 −/− UPR signaling, such as through ATF6, induces angiogenesis regulators like VEGF, linking ER stress to neovascularization 18 29 30 67 Atf6 −/− Atf6 −/− 23 29 41 Our findings identify a role for ATF6 in early retinal vascular development, as evidenced by delayed angiogenesis and reduced pruning in Atf6 −/− 6 Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− 63 66 Atf6 −/− 33 36 68 69 15 23 70 71 Xbp-1s −/− Ire1 α −/− 72 73 Perk −/− 74 75 Atf6 −/− 38 To assess changes in photoreceptor function in Atf6 −/− 76 78 79 80 Atf6 −/− Atf6 +/+ 81 Atf6 −/− Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− 81 82 80 83 85 Atf6 −/− Atf6 −/− Atf6 −/− Our findings support that UPR inhibition, demonstrated with Atf6 −/− Atf6 −/− Atf6 +/+ 16 https://clinicaltrials.gov NCT03950570 NCT04834778 86 87 Our study shows that genetic ATF6 inhibition preserves visual function and reduces neovascularization, but further research is needed to evaluate its therapeutic potential. Key steps include evaluating the ocular safety and potency of compounds that inhibit ATF6 or UPR and optimizing their delivery to the retina. If ATF6-targeting approaches prove effective in preserving vision and reducing neovascularization, they could lead to novel treatments for blinding retinal diseases. Materials and methods Animals Atf6 Atf6 −/− 35 36 38 Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− Oxygen-induced retinopathy The oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) protocol was induced in Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− 14 44 5 14 44 Administration of Ceapin-A7 (Atf6 inhibitor) Intravitreal injections in mice were conducted under anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80–90 mg/kg; KETASET, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and xylazine (5–10 mg/kg; X-Ject SA, Butler, Dublin, OH, USA). Ceapin-A7 was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, United States) and prepared at a concentration of 10 µM dissolved in sterile-filtered saline containing 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). A volume of 1 µL of Ceapin-A7 was administered via intravitreal injection using a Hamilton syringe with a 33-gauge needle (Sigma-Aldrich Corp.). For the Ceapin-A7-treated group, both eyes of each animal were intravitreally injected with Ceapin-A7 at P30. In the control group, both eyes of each animal were intravitreally injected with 1 µL of saline containing 0.05% DMSO at P30. After injection, veterinary ophthalmic antibacterial ointment was administered to prevent infection and corneal drying. Retinas were collected 24 h post-injection for RNA-Seq analysis. Retina tissue preparation Mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80–90 mg/kg; KETASET, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and xylazine (5–10 mg/kg; X-Ject SA, Butler, Dublin, OH, USA). Retinal tissue was collected from the enucleated eyes at postnatal days P3, P7, P10, P12, P14, P17, P20, and P30. Following enucleation, the animals were euthanized by administering an overdose of Euthasol (200 mg/kg, Virbac Corporation, Fort Worth, TX, USA), with cervical dislocation performed as a secondary method. The cornea and lens were removed, and eyecups were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) for 60 min at 4°C. Post-fixation, the eyecups were transferred to 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the eyecups were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) medium (Tissue-Tek, Elkhart, IN, USA), frozen using liquid nitrogen, and sectioned along the vertical meridian using a Leica cryostat (Leica Biosystems Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) to a thickness of 15 μm. The 15-µm-thick retinal sections were collected and mounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific). For wholemount retinal preparation, retinas were carefully dissected from fixed eyecups. The ciliary body was retained during dissection to ensure the entire peripheral retina was preserved for complete area analysis. Retinas were then flattened for staining. Immunohistochemistry For immunohistochemistry, 15-µm-thick cryostat sections were incubated in normal donkey serum (NDS) (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Following this, the sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies: Alexa Fluor™ 568 conjugate Isolectin GS-IB4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, #121412, dilution 1:1000), Alexa Fluor™ 594 conjugate Isolectin GS-IB4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, #121413, dilution 1:1000), rabbit polyclonal antibody against ERG (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab92513, dilution 1:200), and Alexa Fluor™ 488 conjugate Ki-67 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, #53-5698-82, dilution 1:1000). After primary antibody incubation, sections were either washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) (for those with conjugated antibodies) or incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, dilution 1:500). For triple-label studies, sections were incubated overnight with a mixture of primary antibodies followed by a 2-hour incubation with the secondary antibody. The sections were then washed for 30 min with 0.1 M PB, cover-slipped with VECTASHIELD HardSet™ Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Newark, CA, #H-1000-10), and analyzed using a Nikon A1R confocal microscope (Nikon, NY, USA). Immunofluorescence images were processed using Nikon NIS Elements and ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, imagej.net). The brightness and contrast of the images were adjusted using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Wholemount immunostaining was conducted in the same manner except that the incubation times with the primary antibodies were extended to 2 nights. RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was carried out as described in previous studies 55 88 Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− http://biosys.bgi.com 89 Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− 90 Functional enrichment analysis Functional enrichment analysis was performed using g:Profiler ( https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/ Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− 2 ≤ https://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/ Electroretinogram Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) analyses were conducted using an Espion system (Diagnosys, Lowell, MA, USA). Following a minimum of 12 h of dark adaptation, the animals were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80–90 mg/kg; KETASET, Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and xylazine (5–10 mg/kg; X-Ject SA, Butler, Dublin, OH, USA). Under dim red light, Proparacaine HCL Ophthalmic Solution (0.5%; Bausch and Lomb, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) was applied as a local anesthetic to the pupils. Subsequently, Tropicamide Ophthalmic (1%; Bausch and Lomb, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) and Phenylephrine HCL Ophthalmic Solution (10%; AKORN, Lake Forest, IL, USA) were administered as a cycloplegic agent and a dilator, respectively. For scotopic response assessment, the dark-adapted, dilated eyes were exposed to a stimulus intensity of 40 (S) cd.s/m². To evaluate the photopic response, the animals were light-adapted for 7 min before a strobe flash with an intensity of 10 (S) cd.s/m² was presented to the dilated eyes. Fifteen repeated flashes were averaged to obtain the final waveform, with the photopic b-wave amplitude measured from the a-wave trough to the b-wave peak. Quantification of retinal vasculature in OIR Vaso-obliteration was assessed by outlining the central avascular area and total retinal area using the Polygonal Lasso tool in Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA) and expressed as the central avascular area in relation to the total retinal area (% avascular area) at P12, P17, and P20. For neovascularization, individual neovascular tufts and clusters were outlined with a white dotted line using the same software at P17 and P20, and the total neovascular area was expressed in relation to the total retinal area (% neovascular area). Wholemount images were imported into NIH’s ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; available at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html 5 14 To quantify proliferating endothelial cells in the Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− 91 92 93 Quantification of retinal vasculature in early development The retinal areas of wholemount retinas from Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− High-resolution images of retinal wholemounts stained with IB4 were used to analyze the number of vascular branches. Three fields of 175 μm × 175 μm were sampled from the central (250 μm away from the optic disc), mid-peripheral (750 μm away from the optic disc), and peripheral (1.25 mm away from the optic disc) areas in the superior region of wholemount retinas. Using ImageJ, images of these areas were thresholded to create a binarized image in which the vascular area is positive and the background is negative. Binarized images were then processed into skeletons using the Skeletonize plugin, and branch numbers were quantified using the AnalyzeSkeleton plugin 94 63 Measurement of outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness The thickness of the ONL was measured at 100 μm intervals, beginning 500 μm away from the optic disc. For each retinal section, five measurements of ONL thickness were taken, spaced approximately 100 μm apart, and averaged. Layer thickness measurements were collected from three retinas each from Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− Statistical analysis All data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant and annotated as follows: * p p p p Atf6 +/+ Atf6 −/− 2 Statistical power and sample size estimation Post hoc power analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10 to evaluate whether the sample sizes used in the experiments provided sufficient statistical power. For each comparison, group means, 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and standardized effect sizes (Cohen’s d) were calculated. Sample size estimates required to achieve 80% power were based on unpaired t-tests (two-tailed, α = 0.05). Analyses were conducted for neovascularization and vaso-obliteration. Detailed results of these analyses are reported in the Results section. Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
