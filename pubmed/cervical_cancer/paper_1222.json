Introduction Colon cancer remains one of the leading and deadliest cancers worldwide [ 1 2 3 At present, the standard treatment for early-stage colon cancer is surgical resection. However, as the disease is often diagnosed at more advanced stages, chemotherapy remains the primary treatment option for most patients. Common chemotherapy drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, are frequently used in combination. Despite their therapeutic benefits, these agents have limited efficacy due to their toxicity to normal cells and the development of resistance in cancer cells [ 4 Natural products, particularly those derived from plants, have long been valued for their accessibility, low toxicity, and therapeutic potential in treating a variety of diseases. Among these, flavonoids have garnered considerable attention due to their wide array of biological activities, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties [ 5 6 7 Pueraria lobata 8 9 10 The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is a critical regulator of cancer progression, influencing key processes such as cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and apoptosis resistance [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 2. Results 2.1. Effects of Puerarin on the Viability and Proliferation of Colon Cancer Caco-2 Cells Puerarin ( Figure 1 21 20 9 Pueraria lobata Figure 1 50 Figure 1 Figure 1 2.2. Effects of Puerarin on Migration, Invasion, and Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in Caco-2 Cells To assess the impact of puerarin on Caco-2 cell migration and invasion, wound healing and Transwell assays were performed ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 2.3. Effects of Puerarin on Apoptosis in Caco-2 Cells Cell morphology was evaluated using DAPI and PI staining ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 2.4. Network Pharmacology Investigation of the Anticancer Mechanism of Puerarin in Colon Cancer To elucidate the underlying anticancer mechanisms of puerarin, a comprehensive network pharmacology analysis was performed, encompassing target prediction, protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and functional enrichment analysis. A Venn diagram ( Figure 4 Figure 4 AKT1 IL6 HSP90AA1 Figure 4 2.5. Identification of Colon Cancer Targets The acquisition of colon cancer targets was conducted through transcriptomic analysis of the TCGA-COAD (Colon Adenocarcinoma) dataset. RNA-seq data from 41 normal and 483 tumor samples were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database ( https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga Figure 5 To determine the potential target genes of puerarin, a Venn diagram was generated using the ggvenn (version 0.1.10) package, showing 28 intersecting target genes ( Figure 5 NR3C2 ANPEP FCGRT PIK3R1 MME SCD SERPINE1 Figure 5 PIK3R1 AKT1 PIK3R1 AKT1 Figure 5 PIK3R1 PI3K PIK3R1 AKT 18 PIK3R1 2.6. Effects of Puerarin on the PI3K/AKT Signaling Pathway in Caco-2 Cells To evaluate the impact of puerarin on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in Caco-2 cells, Western blotting was performed to measure PI3K and AKT phosphorylation after treatment with puerarin at concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 µM. Puerarin treatment significantly decreased PI3K and AKT phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 6 19 Figure 6 2.7. Effects of Puerarin on 740 Y-P-Induced Migration, Invasion, and EMT in Caco-2 Cells To examine how puerarin affects 740 Y-P-induced migration, invasion, and EMT in Caco-2 cells, scratch wound healing and Transwell invasion assays were utilized ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 2.8. Effects of Puerarin on 740 Y-P-Induced Apoptosis in Caco-2 Cells Cell morphology was evaluated using DAPI and PI staining ( Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 3. Discussion In recent times, increasing research evidence has emphasized the substantial potential of natural bioactive compounds in cancer prevention and treatment [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 50 50 Tumor metastasis is a multifaceted process involving primary tumor detachment, extracellular matrix invasion, penetration into lymphatic and vascular systems, and formation of metastatic lesions in distant organs [ 26 27 28 29 30 30 31 These results are consistent with prior studies, demonstrating that puerarin alleviates cisplatin-induced apoptosis in hair cells through the mitochondrial pathway and reduces neurological damage in mice via the Bax/Bcl-2, Caspase-3, and Sirt3/SOD2 pathways [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 AKT1 IL6 HSP90AA1 PIK3R1 PIK3R1 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Reagents and Chemicals Puerarin (CAS #3681-99-0) was obtained from Chengdu Dester Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China).

Cell Culture and Proliferation Assay Caco-2 colon cancer cells were obtained from Shanghai SIBG Biotechnology (Shanghai, China) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA, #C11875500BT) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Wisent, Saint-Jean-Baptiste, QC, Canada, #086-150), 100 U/mL penicillin (Wisent, #450-201-EL), and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Wisent, #450-201-EL). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO 2 3 4.3. Invasion and Wound Healing Assays Invasion assays were conducted using Matrigel-coated Transwell chambers (8 μm pores, 24-well format). Caco-2 cells were seeded in the upper chamber with serum-free medium, while the lower chamber contained medium with 10% FBS. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 4.4. Western Blot Analysis Western blot analysis was conducted as follows: Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China, #P0013B) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China, #DI101-02). Protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay kit (Beyotime, #P0010). Equal amounts of protein (20–30 μg) were separated by 10–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA, #IPVH00010). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.

Images were acquired on a Leica DMI1 microscope and quantified with ImageJ (v1.8.0). For apoptosis analysis, cells were stained with the Annexin V-EGFP/PI apoptosis detection kit (Abbkine, #KTA005) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, incubated for 15 min at 4 °C, and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine apoptotic percentages. 4.6 Puerarin Target Prediction and Colon Cancer-Related Targets. The SMILES structure of puerarin was obtained from PubChem and analyzed using the Swiss Target Prediction (version 2019), SEA (version 2020), and Super-pred (version 2.0) databases to predict target genes. Colon cancer-related targets were identified through GeneCards (version 5.15), OMIM (version 2023), and DisGeNET (version 7.0) databases, validated using UniProt (version 2023_05), and intersected with puerarin targets using a Venn diagram generated in R (v4.3.1) with the ggvenn package (v0.1.10). 4.6. Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Network Analysis Intersection targets were imported into the STRING database (version 12.0; https://en.string-db.org/ https://cytoscape.org/ 4.7. GO Enrichment and KEGG Pathway Analysis The “Drug-Disease” intersection targets were uploaded to the DAVID database https://davidbioinformatics.nih.gov/ 4.8. Statistical Analysis The results are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) derived from at least three independent experiments. Statistical differences between two groups were analyzed using a two-tailed Student’s t p p p 5. Conclusions This study comprehensively examined the anticancer effects of puerarin on Caco-2 cells and uncovered its underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that puerarin significantly inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while effectively inducing apoptosis to suppress tumor growth. The anticancer mechanisms of puerarin are primarily associated with the modulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, where puerarin treatment significantly reduces PI3K and AKT phosphorylation, inhibits EMT, and promotes apoptosis. Additionally, puerarin plays a pivotal role in regulating the Bax/Bcl-2 balance, thereby enhancing apoptosis. In conclusion, puerarin, as a natural bioactive compound, exhibits substantial therapeutic potential in colon cancer treatment, targeting tumor growth and metastasis through multiple molecular pathways. Future research should emphasize evaluating the clinical applicability of puerarin and exploring its synergistic effects when combined with other anticancer therapies.
