Introduction Chronic low back pain (CLBP) represents a significant public health challenge due to its high prevalence and substantial impact on patient quality of life and functional capacity [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Lumbar medial branch radiofrequency ablation (LRFA), first introduced by Dr. Nikolai Bogduk in 1980, remains a widely used interventional treatment for facet-mediated CLBP [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 5 16 Understanding the clinical implications of multifidus denervation is critical as these muscles are essential stabilizers of the lumbar spine, responding dynamically to movement and postural adjustments [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 Given this backdrop, the objectives of this narrative review are to synthesize existing evidence on multifidus atrophy and dysfunction following LRFA, discuss the clinical relevance of these findings, and identify possible areas requiring further research and treatment gaps on the sequelae of LRFA. 2. Materials and Methods This narrative review was conducted in accordance with established best practices for narrative synthesis, emphasizing transparency, methodological rigor, and interpretive depth as outlined by Sukhera et al. [ 23 Table 1 Figure 1 Data from eligible studies were extracted using a standardized template that included study design, sample characteristics, methods of assessing multifidus structure or function, key outcomes, and author interpretations. In line with narrative review methodology, data synthesis employed both descriptive (e.g., frequency of study designs and reported outcomes) and interpretive (e.g., thematic and clinical implications) approaches. Thematic patterns were identified and reported in the Results and Discussion Sections. Throughout the review process, the authors engaged in reflexive deliberation, acknowledging how their clinical and academic perspectives shaped study selection, interpretation, and framing. This review adheres to the SANRA (Scale for the Assessment of Narrative Review Articles) criteria, which assess the methodological quality of narrative reviews across six domains: topic significance, clarity of aims, adequacy of the literature search, referencing quality, strength of scientific reasoning, and appropriateness of data presentation [ 25 3. Results A total of six studies evaluating structural or functional changes in the multifidus muscle following LRFA were identified, including five cohort studies and one case series. Study designs varied in methodology, with sample sizes ranging from 1 to 46 patients. Among the cohort studies, most utilized T2-weighted MRI of the lumbar spine to assess outcomes, while others employed advanced imaging techniques such as fat-subtracted imaging, shear-wave elastography, and electromyography ( Table 2 4. Discussion 4.1. Multifidus Atrophy Following LRFA While LRFA is generally regarded as a safe procedure, the potential issue of post-LRFA multifidus denervation remains controversial [ 32 16 16 Given the fragmented nature of existing studies and the lack of high-quality evidence, a comprehensive synthesis of available data is essential to better understand the potential sequelae of LRFA on the multifidus. This review builds upon prior systematic analyses by integrating newly published studies, critically examining individual study findings and their clinical implications, and highlighting persistent knowledge gaps that warrant further research and the development of novel therapeutic strategies within the broader management algorithm of CLBP and post-LRFA multifidus atrophy. The results of Dreyfuss et al. and Böning et al. should be interpreted with caution because of severe limitations in the study designs. Dreyfuss’ study was one of the first published on LRFA and multifidus atrophy. Dreyfuss et al. concluded that LRFA does not cause segmental atrophy of the multifidus at long-term follow-up [ 31 The primary objective of Böning et al. was to assess the feasibility of performing LRFA under open MRI guidance rather than using conventional C-arm fluoroscopy [ 28 Sadeghi et al. used ultrasound shear-wave elastography to evaluate the shear modulus of the multifidus after LRFA, with a higher shear modulus reflecting greater tissue stiffness [ 29 33 31 34 Three of the six studies utilized MRI to investigate multifidus atrophy. Smuck et al., Oswald et al., and Guven et al. utilized pre- and post-LRFA MRI imaging to assess changes in multifidus morphology [ 26 27 30 30 27 Furthermore, each study differed in how many repeat LRFAs their patients received; variations in the procedure being performed bilaterally or unilaterally; and the number of levels treated. Guven included patients who received only 1 unilateral LRFA, whereas Smuck included patients who received 1–3 repeated LRFAs. Oswald included both unilateral and bilateral LRFAs but they were only performed one time. This raises the question of whether multifidus atrophy is more of a risk that may occur upon receiving repeat LRFAs. Notably, all three studies were limited by small sample sizes (Oswald: n n n 35 36 Given the relatively high methodological quality of the studies by Smuck et al. and Oswald et al., as previously assessed by Tieppo Francio et al. using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale, their conclusions may be regarded with greater confidence [ 16 Three additional studies contribute useful observations to this review. While their contributions are limited by the absence of generalizability and lack of controlled methodology, they collectively suggest a possible association between LRFA and multifidus changes. For example, Vas et al. report a case involving a 65-year-old woman who exhibited worsened bilateral multifidus atrophy on T2-weighted MRI following bilateral LRFA [ 37 Bajaj et al. reported a case of dropped head syndrome in a 77-year-old patient following staged bilateral cervical RFA of the C3–C5 medial branches [ 38 39 4.2. Clinical Implications The lumbar multifidus muscle plays a pivotal role in maintaining dynamic stability of the spine, contributing to approximately two-thirds of the lumbar spine’s stiffness in a neutral position [ 40 19 41 Abdelaty et al. demonstrated that patients with chronic non-specific LBP exhibited impaired voluntary activation of the multifidus muscle compared to healthy controls [ 42 42 19 Emerging evidence has further elucidated the multifidus muscle’s involvement in broader spinal pathologies. For instance, multifidus atrophy has been associated with lumbar facet joint osteoarthritis and isthmic spondylolisthesis, with the degree of vertebral slippage positively correlating with the extent of muscular degeneration [ 43 44 45 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 5. Limitations This review is subject to several important limitations. First, there is considerable heterogeneity across the included studies in terms of patient selection criteria, sample sizes, and outcome measures, which complicates efforts to draw consistent conclusions or generalize findings to broader clinical populations. Second, many of the existing studies are limited by relatively short follow-up durations, making it difficult to assess the long-term structural and functional consequences of multifidus denervation following LRFA. Finally, there remains a critical need for prospective, high-quality trials that incorporate standardized imaging protocols alongside objective functional testing to more precisely characterize the temporal evolution of multifidus changes post-LRFA and clarify their relationship to clinical outcomes. 6. Conclusions Emerging evidence suggests that LRFA may cause multifidus denervation, with functional changes demonstrated in two studies and structural atrophy reported in two others; however, the overall evidence remains limited as most available studies are of poor-to-fair quality and provide low-certainty findings, limiting their generalizability. Once considered a theoretical concern, multifidus atrophy and dysfunction are now increasingly recognized as clinically meaningful contributors to chronic low back pain. In parallel, novel therapeutic strategies aimed at reactivating the multifidus through restorative neurostimulation have shown promising long-term improvements in pain, function, and quality of life. These findings highlight the importance of balancing the potential benefits of LRFA with its possible long-term effects on muscle function. Larger, high-quality, prospective studies using standardized imaging and functional assessments are needed.
