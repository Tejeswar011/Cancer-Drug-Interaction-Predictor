Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2 (ILF2), a nuclear protein involved in gene regulation, has been found to be aberrantly expressed in various cancers; however, its pan-cancer roles remain unclear. Methods This study presents an extensive pan-cancer analysis We systematically evaluated the expression patterns, prognostic and diagnostic significance, genetic alterations, alternative splicing events, functional pathways, immune infiltration characteristics, and therapeutic responses of ILF2 across diverse cancer types. Results ILF2 was broadly upregulated across multiple cancers and correlated with poor prognosis, genomic alterations, and proliferation-related pathways. Its expression was also associated with immune infiltration and immune subtypes. In hepatocellular carcinoma, ILF2 mainly expresses in malignant hepatocytes at the single-cell RNA-seq level, and high ILF2 predicted therapeutic resistance and worse survival outcomes. Conclusion ILF2 may serve as a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic targeting. In particular, it holds promise as a novel therapeutic target in hepatocellular carcinoma.

We further evaluate its clinical relevance in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, and assess its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target. The findings from this study may offer new insights into tumor biology and contribute to the development of more effective strategies for cancer management. Materials and methods Pan-cancer expression analysis We investigated the mRNA and protein expression levels of ILF2 across normal human tissues and organs using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database. Transcriptomic and proteomic data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases [ 19 20 http://xena.ucsc.edu/ https://www.xiantaozi.com/ 1  Fig. 1 Study flowchart Prognostic and diagnostic value of ILF2 across cancers The association between ILF2 expression and overall survival (OS) across various cancer types was evaluated using univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Prognostic risk was assessed by hazard ratios (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-values, with statistical significance defined as p Genomic alteration analysis Pan-cancer analyses of ILF2 genomic alterations, including mutation frequency, amplification, and deep deletion across various cancer types, were conducted using the Summary module in the cBioPortal database [ 21 22 23 Molecular alteration and splicing analysis Genomic data related to ILF2, including somatic mutations and DNA methylation, were retrieved, analyzed, and visualized using the cBioPortal platform ( http://www.cbioportal.org 24 25 Functional enrichment analysis GSEA was carried out with the “clusterProfiler” R package, utilizing the Hallmark gene set collection [ 26 26 Immune infiltration analysis We systematically analyzed the relationship between ILF2 expression and 19 immune cell populations, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), progenitors of lymphoid and myeloid lineages, granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, B lymphocytes, neutrophils, CD4⁺ T cells, endothelial cells, eosinophils, regulatory T cells (Tregs), follicular helper T cells (TFH), natural killer T (NKT) cells, γδ T cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, CD8⁺ T cells, mast cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.The analysis was performed using seven established immune deconvolution algorithms—CIBERSORT, CIBERSORT-ABS, QUANTISEQ, TIMER, EPIC, MCPcounter, and xCELL—and visualized using the “ggplot2” R package. Results were presented as heatmaps based on Spearman correlation coefficients [ 27 26 28 External cohort and single-cell data analysis This study integrated and analyzed gene expression and clinical data from multiple public datasets, including E_TABM_36, GSE144269 GSE14520 GSE109211 29 31 The single-cell transcriptomic dataset GSE149614 32 Finally, patients were stratified into high- and low-ILF2 expression groups according to the optimal cut-off values using the surv_cutpoint function in the R package “survminer”, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed in the GSE14520 GSE54236 Results Tissue distribution and cancer-type expression profile of ILF2 Analysis of the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database (Fig. 2 2 2 2 2 2  Fig. 2 Tissue distribution and cancer-type specific expression profile of ILF2. A B C D E F Prognostic and diagnostic evaluation of ILF2 in pan-cancer We investigated the relationship between ILF2 expression and various survival metrics, including overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), progression-free interval (PFI), and disease-free interval (DFI), across multiple cancer types (Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Prognostic significance of ILF2 expression in pan-cancer. Forest plots illustrating the associations between ILF2 expression and ( A B C D Given that gene expression is subject to epigenetic regulation, we analyzed the mutation status and DNA methylation levels of ILF2 across multiple cancer types. We found that ILF2 harbors mutations in 26 distinct cancer types, with the highest mutation frequency observed in cholangiocarcinoma (Fig. 4 4 4 4 4 4  Fig. 4 Genomic alterations of ILF2 in pan-cancer. A B C D E F Mutation analysis of ILF2 We found that the mutation sites of ILF2 were predominantly missense mutations, with the L245I variant being the most prominent. These mutations were mainly clustered within the DZF domain (Fig. 5 5 5  Fig. 5 ILF2 mutations and methylation landscape in pan-cancer. A B C D Functional analysis of ILF2 To elucidate the functional role of ILF2 in tumor cells, we performed pathway enrichment analyses. Hallmark gene sets were curated and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The results revealed that ILF2 expression was positively associated with multiple proliferation-related biological processes, including MYC targets and E2F targets. In contrast, it was negatively correlated with classical tumor-suppressive pathways such as the Apical Junction, as well as immune-related processes including the interferon-alpha response and translational elongation (Fig. 6 6  Fig. 6 Association between ILF2 expression and cancer-related pathways and immune activity. A B C Subsequently, we analyzed genome-wide CRISPR screening data from pan-cancer cell lines to assess ILF2 dependency. The majority of cell lines exhibited negative CRISPR scores for ILF2, indicating a strong cellular dependence on ILF2 and suggesting that its knockout impairs cell proliferation or induces cell death (Fig. 6 Pan-cancer immunogenomic profiling of ILF2 To investigate the immunological role of ILF2, we employed seven deconvolution algorithms (CIBERSORT, CIBERSORT-ABS, QUANTISEQ, TIMER, EPIC, MCPCOUNTER, and xCELL) to assess the relationship between ILF2 expression and immune cell infiltration across cancer types (Fig. 7 We further explored the relationship between ILF2 expression and tumor antigenicity, including various mutation features, tumor neoantigens (NEO), cancer/testis antigens (CTA), and TCR/BCR diversity metrics [ 33 7 Building on the classification of immune subtypes into six distinct categories—wound healing (C1), IFN-γ dominant (C2), inflammatory (C3), lymphocyte-depleted (C4), immunologically quiet (C5), and TGF-β dominant (C6) [ 33 7 An immune gene heatmap further illustrated the expression patterns of five major immune gene categories—chemokines, chemokine receptors, immunoinhibitors, immunostimulators, and MHC molecules—across various tumor types. Notably, chemokine-related genes were predominantly expressed in BRCA, whereas MHC-associated genes were highly expressed in THCA ( 7 )  Fig. 7 Correlation of ILF2 expression with immune infiltration and immune-related gene expression in pan-cancer. A B C D ILF2 expression landscape and clinical implications in hepatocellular carcinoma We observed significantly elevated ILF2 expression in tumor tissues across multiple datasets, including E_TABM_36, GSE144269 GSE14520 8 GSE109211 8 8 8 GSE149614 8 Subsequently, patients were stratified into high and low ILF2 expression groups based on median expression levels. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis demonstrated that high ILF2 expression was significantly associated with reduced OS in both GSE14520 GSE54236 GSE14520 GSE76427 8 8  Fig. 8 ILF2 expression and its clinical relevance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A B C D E F GSE149614 G H I GO enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ILF2 high and low expression groups in TCGA-LIHC indicated that genes in the high ILF2 group were enriched in cellular component pathways, such as intracellular anatomical structure and organelle lumen. In contrast, DEGs in the low ILF2 group were enriched in molecular function terms, including deubiquitinase activity and thiol-dependent deubiquitinase activity (Fig. 9 9  Fig. 9 Functional enrichment analyses of ILF2 high- and low-expression groups. A B Discussion ILF2, formerly known as nuclear factor 45, is ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues. It typically forms a heterodimer with ILF3 and regulates gene expression through various mechanisms, participating in multiple DNA and RNA metabolic pathways [ 34 14 35 16 To further elucidate the role of ILF2 in cancer, we conducted a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis focusing on its expression profile, genetic and epigenetic alterations, biological functions, and clinical relevance. Our findings revealed that ILF2 is highly expressed across multiple cancer types and is significantly associated with patient prognosis, suggesting its potential involvement in tumor initiation and progression. Notably, in hepatocellular carcinoma, high ILF2 expression was associated with poor clinical outcomes and resistance to both sorafenib and TACE, indicating that ILF2 overexpression may contribute to treatment resistance and adverse prognosis. In terms of molecular mechanisms, ILF2 overexpression was frequently accompanied by increased TP53 mutation rates, amplification of 1q21.3, and deletion of the 4q region, indicating a possible link with genomic instability. Moreover, ILF2 expression showed cancer-type–specific correlations with DNA methylation levels and was negatively correlated with promoter methylation in certain tumors, suggesting that hypomethylation may be involved in its aberrant activation. Functional and immunological analyses further revealed that ILF2 overexpression was strongly associated with pathways related to cell cycle regulation, cellular proliferation, and stress response. Importantly, ILF2 expression was significantly correlated with tumor-infiltrating immune cell populations, and showed close associations with T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity, tumor immunogenicity, and immune subtypes, implying a potential role for ILF2 in modulating the tumor immune microenvironment and facilitating immune evasion. Similar to newly identified forms of programmed cell death such as disulfidptosis [ 36 However, our study has several limitations. Our pan-cancer conclusions are primarily based on integrated analyses of publicly available datasets. The heterogeneity among different platforms, cancer types, and patient cohorts may also introduce confounding factors that could not be fully addressed. In addition, some clinical variables, such as treatment history and detailed molecular subtyping, were not uniformly available, which may limit the depth of our analysis. Although we applied multiple normalization methods and cross-validation strategies to reduce systematic bias, further experimental validation is warranted. Moreover, advances in exosome-based stratification systems, such as TDERS in ccRCC [ 37 Conclusion In summary, ILF2 is intimately associated with cancer development, progression, immune regulation, and clinical prognosis. In particular, ILF2 holds promise as a potential biomarker for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response prediction in hepatocellular carcinoma, and may represent a novel target for precision oncology.
