CA also inhibits cell proliferation by inducing cell-cycle arrest and cell death. However, the mechanism of regulation of centrosome number in cancer cells and its effect on CIN and cell proliferation remains elusive. Here, we report that tuftelin (TUFT1) is a novel centrosomal protein that localizes to the proximal ends of parent centrioles. TUFT1 prevents CA and mitotic spindle multipolarity by suppressing premature polo-like kinase 1 activation. In addition, TUFT1 is phosphorylated by NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2), and the phosphorylation status of TUFT1 is essential for coordinating centrosome number and cell proliferation in cervical and breast cancers. Data from clinical breast cancer samples indicate that the combined detection of TUFT1 and NEK2 expression reflects tumor malignancy and patient survival with higher precision. Overall, these results reveal a crucial role of TUFT1 in the regulation of tumor progression through centrosome number control. Thus, TUFT1 represents a promising target for diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for cancers.

TUFT1 prevents CA and mitotic spindle multipolarity by suppressing premature PLK1 activation. In addition, TUFT1 is phosphorylated by NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2), and the phosphorylation status of TUFT1 is essential for coordinating centrosome number and cell proliferation in cervical and breast cancers. Hyperphosphorylation of TUFT1 favors the occurrence of CA and inhibits cell proliferation, whereas hypophosphorylation of TUFT1 has the opposite effect. Upregulation of the NEK2/TUFT1 axis in breast cancer is associated with poor outcomes, implying that for the cancer cell population the disadvantage conferred by TUFT1 hyperphosphorylation on cell proliferation may be overcome by its advantage of increasing CA and CIN. Results TUFT1 is recruited to the proximal ends of parent centrioles by C-Nap1 Previous studies have characterized TUFT1 as a cytoplasmic and secretory protein in normal and cancerous soft tissues [ 30 31 S1A 1A 1A Fig. 1 TUFT1 is recruited to the proximal ends of parent centrioles by C-Nap1. A B C B n D E F G H G n P C t H Furthermore, we observed centrosomal localization of TUFT1 throughout the cell cycle. The signal intensity of TUFT1 on the centrosome remained constant during interphase but decreased significantly upon entry into mitosis (Fig. 1 S1B Given that TUFT1 co-localized with C-Nap1 at the proximal ends of parent centrioles, we investigated the recruitment relationship between the two proteins. We first confirmed the biochemical association between TUFT1 and C-Nap1 using exogenous and endogenous co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 1 1F–H S1B S1C TUFT1 suppresses CA and mitotic spindle multipolarity To investigate the function of TUFT1 on the centrosome, we depleted endogenous TUFT1 in HeLa cells using short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Fig. 2A 2 2 S1D S1E S1D S1E 2A–D 1 1E Fig. 2 Loss of TUFT1 induces centrosome amplification and mitotic spindle multipolarity. A B C B n D B n E F G F n H F n I J I C D G H J P To further confirm the effect of TUFT1 on centrosome number and mitotic spindle morphology, we generated TUFT1-knockout HeLa cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 approach and validated the knockout efficiency by sequencing, immunostaining, and immunoblotting (Figs. 2E 2 2C 2F–H 2 2E 2 S2F S2G TUFT1 interacts with PLK1 Having confirmed the role of TUFT1 in the regulation of centrosome number, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays to investigate potential associations between TUFT1 and several key centrosome duplication regulators (Cep152, Cep192, PLK1, PLK4, SAS-6, and STIL). The results showed that exogenous TUFT1 was selectively co-immunoprecipitated with PLK1 but not the other proteins (Fig. 3A 15 17 3B 3C Fig. 3 TUFT1 interacts with PLK1. A B C D E F G Next, we mapped the regions of TUFT1 and PLK1 that are involved in their interaction. TUFT1 interacted with PLK1 through its C-terminus (151–390 aa) (Fig. 3 3 S1B 3 S2H S2K 42 S2H S2K TUFT1 suppresses premature activation of PLK1 Given the observed interaction between TUFT1 and PLK1, we investigated whether TUFT1 affects centrosome number by regulating PLK1 activity. We found that phosphorylation of PLK1 at threonine residue 210 (T210) was upregulated following TUFT1 knockout or knockdown (Figs. 4A, B 3 3B 15 4C, D 3 3D 4E–H Fig. 4 TUFT1 suppresses premature activation of PLK1. A B A C D C n E F E G H G n I J I n K L K n B D F H J L P B D J L t F H It was reported that constitutive activation of PLK1 resulted in premature accumulation of distal and subdistal appendages to parent centrioles in cycling HeLa cells [ 21 4I, J 3 3F Next, we investigated whether the inhibition of PLK1 rescues CA induced by TUFT1 depletion. The proportion of TUFT1-knockout cells with excess centrioles was reversed by treatment with the PLK1 inhibitor volasertib (from ~18% to 11%) (Fig. 4 S3G S3H S3I S3K TUFT1 is phosphorylated by NEK2 Analysis of TUFT1 protein level in different cell-cycle phases revealed an up-shifted band in mitotic cells (Fig. 5A 5B 5C Fig. 5 NEK2-mediated phosphorylation promotes the removal of TUFT1 from the centrosome. A B C D E F E G H I J I n F J P F t J We compared the amino acid sequences of TUFT1 from different species for the NEK2 consensus phosphorylation motif [ 43 S4A S4B 5D As the centrosomal localization of TUFT1 was found to decrease upon entry into mitosis (Fig. 1 5 5G 5H–J S4C Phosphorylation status of TUFT1 coordinates centrosome number and cell proliferation in cervical and breast cancers We further investigated whether NEK2-mediated phosphorylation affects the biological functions of TUFT1. We mainly focused on cervical and breast cancers for subsequent investigations because both NEK2 and TUFT1 have been reported to promote the progression and chemoresistance of these two cancers [ 38 40 44 48 First, we depleted endogenous TUFT1 in MDA-MB-231 cells using siRNAs and found that the proportion of mitotic cells with multipolar spindles and interphase cells with amplified centrioles significantly increased following TUFT1 knockdown (Fig. S5A S5F S5A S5F S6A S6D S6C S6E S6I We further generated TUFT1-knockout HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cell lines stably expressing exogenous TUFT1 (WT, 2A, or 2D) (Fig. 6A 6B–F 6G–J Fig. 6 Phosphorylation status of TUFT1 coordinates centrosome number and cell proliferation in cervical and breast cancers. A B C D B n E F B n G H I J H C F G I J P To test the effects of TUFT1 phosphorylation on in vivo tumor growth, we injected all the MDA-MB-231 cell lines mentioned above into the mammary fat pads of female nude mice, and monitored tumor growth. Consistent with the results from the cultured cells, the volume and weight of tumors originating from TUFT1-2D cells were markedly lower than those originating from TUFT1-WT and TUFT1-2A cells (Fig. 7A–C S7A S7C Fig. 7 Upregulation of the NEK2/TUFT1 axis is associated with poor outcome in breast cancer. A n B A C A D E D F B C P B C E F Upregulation of the NEK2/TUFT1 axis is associated with poor outcome in breast cancer Next, we sought to investigate the effects of TUFT1 phosphorylation on clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissue microarrays and assessed the correlation between NEK2/TUFT1 expression and patient outcome. Each sample was scored on a scale of 0–3 based on the percentage of immunoreactive cells and the staining intensity, and the samples were classified as low (0–1) and high (2–3) expression groups (Fig. 7D 7E S1 7F 7F S7D S7E S7F S7G Discussion Recent studies have shown that TUFT1 is an oncoprotein that promotes proliferation, metastasis, and drug resistance in breast cancer cells and is associated with worse clinical status and poor prognosis [ 38 40 8 38 39 40 Fig. 8 Schematic model. TUFT1 localizes to the centrosome and prevents CA by blocking PLK1 activity. At the onset of mitosis, NEK2-mediated phosphorylation promotes the removal of TUFT1 from the centrosome. The loss of TUFT1 induces premature activation of PLK1, triggering CA and mitotic abnormalities, thereby suppressing cell proliferation and increasing CIN. It is well-established that CA has contradictory effects on cancer cell survival. CA-mediated mitotic spindle abnormalities are considered as a primary source of CIN via increased frequency of chromosome mis-segregation and DNA breaks [ 49 50 6 7 7 51 PLK1 is activated in late G2 phase and mitosis, whereas premature activation of PLK1 in early phases has been shown to induce premature centriole disengagement and centriole reduplication [ 15 18 21 4A–J 3 3F 52 53 54 55 20 56 57 Materials and methods Plasmid construction TUFT1 ( NM_020127.3 NM_007186.5 NM_005030.6 NM_002497.3 Antibodies The following primary antibodies were used in this study: rabbit anti-TUFT1 (23385-1-AP, Proteintech, Wuhan, China), mouse anti-Centrin-3 (SC-100933, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, TX, USA), mouse anti-SAS-6 (SC-81431, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-C-Nap1 (AG4725, Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China), mouse anti-FLAG (F1804, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-GFP (66002-1-Ig, Proteintech), mouse anti-α-tubulin (T6199, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-γ-tubulin (T6557, Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-Cep97 (22050-1-AP, Proteintech), rabbit anti-PLK4 (28750-1-AP, Proteintech), mouse anti-GAPDH (60004-1-Ig, Proteintech), rabbit anti-FLAG (20543-1-AP, Proteintech), rabbit anti-γ-tubulin (T3559, Sigma-Aldrich), mouse anti-PLK1 (ab17056, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), rabbit anti-PLK1 (4513, Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA), rabbit anti-PLK1 (phospho T210) (ab155095, Abcam), mouse anti-STIL (66876-1-Ig, Proteintech), rabbit anti-Cep152 (21815-1-AP, Proteintech), rabbit anti-Cep192 (18832-1-AP, Proteintech), rabbit anti-Cep164 (22227-1-AP, Proteintech), rabbit anti-Odf2 (12058-1-AP, Proteintech), rabbit anti-Cyclin B1 (12231, Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse anti-NEK2 (610593, BD Biosciences, NJ, USA).

The siRNA-targeted regions of TUFT1 were mutated to 5′-CGCGAAGACATTAGCAGTAAACTA-3′. Cell culture, transfection, and chemical treatment HEK293T, HeLa, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were purchased from Pricella Biotechnology (Wuhan, China) and were cultured in DMEM (BasalMedia, Shanghai, China) containing 10% FBS (Sbjbio, Nanjing, China) in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 ® For G1-, S-, G2- and M-phase synchronization, HeLa cells were treated with 0.4 mM mimosine (HY-N0928, MedChemExpress, NJ, USA), 2.5 mM thymidine (HY-N1150, MedChemExpress), 15 μM RO-3306 (HY-12529, MedChemExpress), or 100 ng/mL nocodazole (HY-13520, MedChemExpress) for 16 h, respectively, and then released. For inhibition of PLK1, HeLa cells were treated with 10 nM volasertib (S2235, Selleck, TX, USA) for 48 h. Generation of TUFT1-knockout cell lines TUFT1-knockout HeLa and MDA-MB-231 cell lines were generated as previously described [ 51 Immunofluorescence microscopy Cells were fixed and permeabilized in methanol for 10 min at –20 °C, incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (RT). DNA was stained with 1 μg/mL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). For confocal microscopy, samples were observed at RT using a TCS SP8 microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a 63×/1.40 NA objective lens (Leica), and images were captured using LAS X software (Leica). For 3D-SIM, samples were observed at RT using an Elyra 7 system (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a 63×/1.40 NA objective lens (Zeiss). In the Lattice SIM mode, we captured a 3 μm Z-stack at 0.125 μm interval for all channels using the ZEN Black software (Zeiss). Raw images were processed using the 3D-SIM² method with ‘Standard–Fixed’ settings. The images were further subjected to maximum intensity projection to convert the stacked images into a single image. Immunoblotting Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to PVDF membranes (Merck Millipore, MA, USA). Membranes were blocked with 4% non-fat milk for 1 h at RT and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. All membranes were analyzed using an automated chemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer (Tanon, Shanghai, China). The original Western blots can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

The culture supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm filter, and the packaged lentivirus was concentrated using 10% PEG 8000. TUFT1-knockout cells were infected with the lentivirus in the presence of 8 μg/mL polybrene (E1299, Selleck), and puromycin-resistant cells were selected and cultured. Cell proliferation assays For CCK-8 assays, cells (3 × 10 3 Animal experiments All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Central Hospital Affiliated to Shandong First Medical University (#JNCHIACUC2024-46). BALB/c nude mice (female, 5–6 weeks old) were randomly divided into 10 groups ( n 6 ® 6 2 Immunohistochemical staining Immunohistochemical staining was performed as described previously [ 58 Overall survival analysis The Kaplan–Meier Plotter ( https://www.kmplot.com/analysis/ 59 Measurements and statistical analyses The intensity of the immunoblot bands and fluorescent signals were measured using ImageJ software (NIH). Images were imported into ImageJ as grayscale TIFF files. Regions of interest (ROIs) corresponding to immunoblot bands or centrosome areas were defined manually. Background signal intensity was quantified from at least three band- or cell-free regions per image, and the mean background intensity was subtracted from all ROI measurements. The immunoblot band or fluorescent signal within each ROI was quantified using ImageJ’s measurement function, reporting integrated density. Data were normalized to relevant control groups. GraphPad Prism 8 software (San Diego, CA, USA) was used for statistical analyses. Each experiment was independently repeated three times to ensure reliability.
