The impact of S100A6 on the drug resistance of cancer cell lines is still uncovered. PC9 cells with EGFR 19 exon mutation is commonly used in lung cancer cell experiments. Methods In this work, PC9 cells over-expressing S100A6 (PC9/S100A6) was successfully constructed, and the PC9 cells were set as control group simultaneously. MTT assay was used to detect and compare the growth rates of the cells in two groups at different concentrations and time points of gefitinib, cisplatin, pemetrexed, bevacizumab. Results Data showed that the inhibitory rates of gefitinib (0.01µmol/L, 0.1µmol/L, 1µmol/L) on PC9/S100A6 cells significantly decreased at 24h, 48h, 72h (P<0.05). Additionally, the inhibitory effects on PC9/S100A6 cells were significantly lower for 10 µmol/L gefitinib (at 48h and 72h), 100 µmol/L gefitinib (at 72h), 2.5 µg/mL cisplatin (at 48h and 72h), and 10 µg/mL cisplatin (at 72h). However, there is no obvious difference in the inhibitory rate of cisplatin (2.5µg/mL 24h; 10µg/mL 24h, 48h; 5µg/mL, 20µg/mL, 40µg/mL 24h, 48h, and 72h), pemetrexed, bevacizumab on two groups. Conclusion Our results demonstrated that S100A6 can apparently promote the resistance to gefitinib of LADC PC9 cell lines with EGFR 19 exon mutations.

The cells were preserved under 5% CO 2 RNA Extraction and qPCR Trizol reagent (Ambion, 15596–026) was used to lyse the cells, then the mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant were collected. Before purity detection and RNA concentration using Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), RNA separation was completed by chloroform, 2-propanol, and 75% ethanol. Next, reverse transcription was conducted by Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), all steps were applied according to the kit instruction. The primers’ information in PCR assay was as follows: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) forward primer (5’-TCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAGCAGG-3’), GAPDH reverse primer (5’- TCAAAGGTGGAGGAGTGGGT −3’), S100A6 forward primer (5’-GACAAGCACACCCTGAGCAA-3’), S100A6 reverse primer (5’- TTCCGGTCCAAGTCTTCCAT −3’). Western Blotting S100A6 protein levels in PC9 and BEAS-2B cell lines were detected by Western blotting assay. Firstly, cells were collected and dissolved by Total Protein Extraction Kit. The cell lysate was then centrifugated at 14,000 rpm for 10 min, added loading sample buffer, followed by heating at 95°C for 5 min, separating with 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and finally transferring to nitrocellulose membrane. We then blocked the nitrocellulose filters using 5% non-fat milk and incubated them with primary antibody (ab181975; Abcam, Shanghai, China; 1:10000 dilution) at 4°C overnight. Simultaneously, the mouse GAPDH antibody was set as an endogenous control using. The secondary antibody against S100A6 (ab150077; Abcam, Shanghai, China; 1:600 dilution) were next added with horse radish peroxidase-labelled polymer. The membrane was re-rinsed and images were collected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Cell Transfection The above mentioned qPCR and Western blot assay confirmed PC9 cells have lower S100A6 expression compared BEAS-2B cells. Thus, we generated S100A6 over-expression lentivirus vector plasmid by connecting target gene with vector plasmid, and the information on origin of S100A6 human gene origin was referred to the website: “ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/6277 PC9 cells at logarithmic phase were collected and trypsinised to a density of 3×10 5 MTT Assay We applied MTT colorimetric assay to evaluate the effect of drugs on the cell proliferation rate. PC9 cells and PC9 cells with over-expressing S100A6 (PC9/S100A6) in logarithmic growth phase were inoculated into a 96 well plate at a density\\3 of 5×10 3 2 Statistical Analysis We applied Microsoft Excel 2019, SPSS 22.0 and GraphPad Prism 7.0 to collect, analyze data, make chart and calculate half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). T Results Inhibition Rate of Cisplatin on PC9 and PC9/S100A6 Cells In the drug inhibition test, among the four drugs, cisplatin showed the best inhibitory effect on both PC9 cells and PC9/S100A6 cells. Both low (2.5µg/mL) and high (40µg/mL) concentrations of cisplatin showed high inhibition rates on both groups in the early (24 hours) and late (72 hours) stages. At 24h, 48h, 72h, the IC50 of cisplatin was 9.135µg/mL (PC9), 9.293µg/mL (PC9/S100A6), 3.488µg/mL (PC9), 4.397µg/mL (PC9/S100A6), 1.903µg/mL (PC9), 2.719µg/mL (PC9/S100A6) respectively, as showed in

Data showed that S100A6 promotes resistance of PC9 cells with EGFR 19 exon mutation to first-generation EGFR-TKI gefitinib (most concentrations/time points) and cisplatin (individual concentrations/time points), while it has no significant impact on the effects of other medicines. To the best of our knowledge, our study firstly explored the function of S100A6 in resistance analysis on lung adenocarcinoma to vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, chemotherapeutics, and EGFR-TKI. Alterations to the kinase domain of EGFR caused by somatic activating mutations commonly occur in NSCLC. 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 15 The S100 protein family comprises a total of 25 human members and has a close association with carcinogenesis of many malignant tumors due to the rearrangement proneness of the chromosomal location. 23 9 23 10 24 25 26 27 The limitations of our overexpression model should be considered when interpreting these results. While overexpression studies are valuable for identifying potential roles of specific proteins, they do not necessarily reflect the endogenous regulation and interactions of these proteins in a physiological context. Further studies using additional models, such as gene knockdown or knockout approaches, would be necessary to confirm the causative role of S100A6 in gefitinib resistance. Additionally, mechanistic validation through studies that directly demonstrate how S100A6 modulates the EGFR signaling pathway or other cellular response pathways would provide stronger evidence for a causative relationship. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a significant correlation between S100A6 overexpression and reduced sensitivity to gefitinib in lung adenocarcinoma PC9 cell lines with EGFR 19 exon mutations. While the data strongly suggest that S100A6 may contribute to gefitinib resistance, further mechanistic studies are required to establish a direct causative relationship. Future research should focus on elucidating the specific molecular mechanisms by which S100A6 modulates the cellular response to gefitinib, including its potential interactions with the EGFR signaling pathway and other resistance mechanisms.
