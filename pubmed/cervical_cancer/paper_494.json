Background: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most catastrophic primary central nervous system malignancy. Extraneural metastases are rare in clinical practice and are seldom reported in the literature. Case Description: A 29-year-old Javanese male was diagnosed with GBM. Following gross total tumor resection, he underwent a full course of adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The posttreatment period was initially uneventful, with no apparent adverse effects. However, 4 months after completion of therapy, the patient experienced a sudden onset of progressive quadriparesis, accompanied by urinary and bowel dysfunction. Contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no evidence of tumor recurrence. Subsequently, a contrast-enhanced spinal MRI demonstrated extensive intradural extramedullary metastases spanning from the cervical to the lumbar spinal segments. Histopathological analysis of a biopsy specimen confirmed the spinal lesions as metastatic GBM. Given the extent of disease and associated risks, the patient and his family declined invasive therapeutic interventions. Supportive and palliative measures were provided, and the patient ultimately succumbed to respiratory failure shortly thereafter. Conclusion: Metastasis of GBM is an uncommon clinical occurrence. Given the increased likelihood of drop metastasis following surgical intervention, it is essential for neurosurgeons and neurologists to closely monitor patients pre and postoperatively. Early detection of spinal involvement can guide timely decision-making and improve supportive care strategies.

GBM is unlike many other aggressive tumors; extracranial metastasis of GBM is rarely reported although recurrence is unavoidable. Strong et al 18 et al 18 4 Since GBM metastasis is poorly recorded due to its rarity, the initial signs and symptoms are not well characterized. Yet, most case reports imply that the signs and symptoms mostly depend on the location of metastasis, as commonly reported in other metastatic cancers. In 1955, Weiss[ 23 4 The rarity of GBM metastasis cases emphasizes the necessity of case reporting for further treatment and research. In this study, we presented a 29-year-old Javanese man with a spinal metastasis of GBM 1 year after the initial diagnosis and treatment. CASE PRESENTATION A 29-year-old Javanese man presented to the Mochtar Riady Comprehensive Cancer Center, Siloam Hospital Semanggi Jakarta, neurosurgery clinic with progressive weakness affecting all four limbs. Thirteen months earlier, he had been diagnosed with a right temporal lobe tumor following a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. Subsequently, a right temporal craniotomy and gross total resection were performed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of GBM, WHO Grade IV. Postoperatively, the patient underwent concomitant chemoradiotherapy, including external beam radiotherapy with a total dose of 60 Gray (Gy) delivered in 30 fractions over 6 weeks, alongside oral temozolomide at 75 mg/m 2 2 On examination at the clinic, the patient was mobilizing with crutches. Neurological examination revealed Medical Research Council (MRC) grade 3/5 paraparesis, increased muscle tone, and hyperreflexia in both lower extremities, without clonus or Babinski sign. There was no motor or sensory deficit in the upper extremities. Sensory examination showed a sensory level at T10 bilaterally. Cognitive examination was within normal limits. Differential diagnosis included spinal cord pathology due to primary or metastatic disease. Considering the history of GBM, recurrent or metastatic disease was suspected. A repeat contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain was requested. MRI of the brain showed no evidence of local recurrence or progression. Postoperative gliotic changes and cerebromalacia communicating with the right lateral ventricle were identified [ Figure 1 Figure 1: Serial had magnetic resonance imaging with contrast (a) before chemotherapy and (b) after the sixth session of chemotherapy. Three months later, the patient returned in a wheelchair, with worsening symptoms including progressive quadriparesis over 3 weeks and urinary retention onset the night prior. Neurological examination revealed MRC grade 2/5 weakness in all extremities, sensory loss with a sensory level at T6, and suprapubic tenderness. Deep tendon reflexes were brisk in all limbs, and there was absent voluntary anal contraction on rectal examination. Vital signs were stable with blood pressure 138/80 mmHg and heart rate 80 bpm. Due to clinical deterioration, the patient was admitted for further investigation and supportive care. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the entire spine revealed a homogeneous, contrast-enhancing intradural extramedullary mass extending continuously from the cervical to the lumbosacral spine, with associated spinal cord compression [ Figure 2 Figure 2: (a) Spinal MRI with contrast shown contrast enhancing homogeneous mass in the vertebral canal from the cervical to the lumbosacral level leads to consequential spinal cord compression. With laminectomy, (b) the tumor was exposed and (c) dissected. Given the patient’s clinical status, radiologic findings, and previous GBM diagnosis, spinal metastasis of GBM was suspected. Treatment options, including decompressive laminectomy and tumor debulking, were discussed. However, the patient and family declined extensive surgical intervention due to the associated risks. They consented instead to a limited laminectomy with biopsy for diagnostic purposes. The procedure was performed 2 days after admission. Postoperatively, the patient was monitored in the intensive care unit for 3 days and transferred to the general ward for 2 additional days before discharge. Two weeks later, the histopathological examination revealed an GBM tissue characteristics [ Figure 3 Figure 3: The patology anatomy result of spinal biopsy shown a typical Glioblastoma Multiforme histology appearance. (a) Tumor cells have pleomorphic nuclei, hyperchromatic, prominent nucleoli, mitoses are found (arrow). HE, 400X. (b) Areas of microvascular proliferation (arrow head). HE, 200X.HE: Hematoxylin and eosin Neurologically, there was no improvement in motor function and the patient remained with MRC grade 2/5 quadriparesis and persistent sensory level at T6. Given the irreversible neurological deficit, the absence of viable therapeutic endpoints, and patient preference, palliative management was initiated. A multidisciplinary supportive care plan was proposed, including psychological counseling, home care services, and symptom management, but these were also declined. The patient died of respiratory failure approximately 3 months after the last admission. DISCUSSION Metastasis of GBM to the extracranial organ is a rare finding in daily practice. Anatomically, the brain itself is isolated from the other organs, including the artery and vein, by the presence of blood–brain barrier.[ 13 1 4 7 8 10 14 16 18 The first reported case of GBM metastasis was described by Davis[ 6 1 7 9 14 16 23 24 3 11 11 The diagnosis of GBM is based on histopathological features, including hypercellularity, nuclear atypia, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis.[ 5 15 17 In the present case, histopathological evaluation of the spinal lesion revealed classic GBM features, fulfilling 3 out of 4 Weiss criteria for metastasis: (1) histologically identical tumor at both sites, (2) clinical course consistent with metastasis, and (3) anatomic continuity through CSF pathways.[ 23 In this patient, progressive motor deficit and sensory changes developed over a period of approximately 4 months, with an initial diagnosis of GBM made 13 months prior. Clinical findings, including MRC grade 2/5 quadriparesis and a sensory level at T6, along with spinal MRI findings and biopsy confirmation, were consistent with diffuse spinal metastasis. Furthermore, cases of metastasis in GBM worsen the chances of survival, as shown by the analyses of Pietschmann et al 4 17 CONCLUSION Extracranial metastasis of GBM is an uncommon finding in daily practice. The detailed mechanism of GBM metastasis remains unclear despite the consideration of CSF spreading, which is also known as drop metastasis. As the likelihood of drop metastasis is increased after the surgery, the neurosurgeon and neurologist should monitor the patient’s condition rigorously and consider metastasis if the patient develops a new neurological deficit that was not observed before or after the surgery.
