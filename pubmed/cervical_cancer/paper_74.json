Autophagy and pyroptosis are key cellular processes involved in MAFLD progression, with autophagy acting as a protective mechanism by inhibiting inflammasome activation. At the same time, excessive pyroptosis contributes to inflammation and tissue damage. Gasdermin D (GSDMD), a key executor of pyroptosis, plays a central role in this process by mediating inflammatory cell death and has emerged as a potential marker of liver injury severity. This study evaluates curcumin’s effects on liver fat accumulation, inflammatory cytokine levels, oxidative stress, and its potential to regulate autophagy and pyroptosis. Rats were allocated to three groups. Group I established a normal diet for twelve weeks. Group II was given a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFFD) for twelve weeks. Group III received the HFFD diet for twelve weeks with curcumin supplementation from the 6th to the 12th week. Rats in Group III showed significant improvements in adiposity, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers. Histopathological analysis confirmed the beneficial effects of curcumin, with notable improvements in liver structure and reduced Lipid-associated liver dysfunction severity. Furthermore, curcumin’s dual effects on autophagy through modulation of P62 protein and BECN1 gene and on pyroptosis through inhibition of GSDMD activation, were evident, supporting its protective role in preventing MAFLD progression to fibrosis and liver cancer.

This lipid-associated liver dysfunction is characterized by the excessive accumulation of triglycerides (TG) within hepatocytes in the absence of alcohol consumption. The disease spectrum ranges from simple steatosis and steatohepatitis to cirrhosis and, in severe cases, hepatocellular carcinoma 1 The “multiple hit” hypothesis describes metabolic fatty liver disease pathogenesis. The initial “hit” involves disrupted lipid metabolism and insulin resistance (IR), resulting in excessive fat deposition within hepatocytes (steatosis). Subsequent “hits” include imbalances in adipokines and cytokines, exposure to intestinal bacterial toxins, and increased oxidative stress. These factors collectively excite the activation of HSC (hepatic stellate cells) and Kupffer cells, ultimately contributing to liver damage 2 . Although the exact mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of such metabolic fatty liver disease are not clear, recent advances have improved understanding of the progression from steatosis to severe liver inflammation and fibrosis. Hepatic steatosis is strongly linked to chronic hepatic inflammation involving the NF-κB signaling pathway 3 . 4 Furthermore, inflammasomes, including the NLRP3 ((NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-comprising protein 3), have been concerned in liver diseases, where activation of this complex triggers’ caspase-1 activation, promoting pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokines release such as IL-1β and IL-18, further exacerbating liver damage 5 6 A central effector of pyroptosis is Gasdermin D (GSDMD). This pore-forming protein is cleaved by activated caspase-1, leading to cell swelling, membrane rupture, and the release of pro-inflammatory contents. Elevated GSDMD expression has been associated with the progression of liver inflammation and fibrosis in metabolic liver diseases. Thus, GSDMD serves as a crucial marker for pyroptotic activity and a potential therapeutic target for mitigating inflammation-driven hepatocellular damage in MAFLD 7 Autophagy plays an essential role in mitigating these pathological processes by removing damaged organelles, including lipid droplets, and suppressing inflammasome activation. The activation of autophagy has been demonstrated to reduce oxidative stress, inhibit pyroptosis, and alleviate liver fibrosis, thereby decelerating the progression of MAFLD 8 9 10 11 Curcumin (Cur), the primary active compound in turmeric, has been demonstrated to modulate oxidative stress, inflammation 12 13 13 14 Despite the extensive studies supporting curcumin’s benefits in MAFLD, its precise mechanisms of action remain insufficiently discovered. Therefore, this study aims to explore curcumin’s role in modulating autophagy, pyroptosis, and inflammasome activity and try to understand the underlying mechanisms involved, focusing on its therapeutic potential in halting MAFLD progression. Material and methods Animals of the experiments Eighteen male albino Sprague Dawley rats, around 180- and 200-g body weight were used for the research experimentations. They were provided by the animal facility at the Faculty of Pharmacy at the Delta University for Science and Technology (FPDUST) in Gamasa, Egypt. The rats were kept in plastic cages, (four animals/cage), in controlled environmental conditions: humidity ranging from 40 to 70%, a 12-h light/dark cycle, and temperature maintained at 20–22°C. The animals had unrestricted access to standard food and water throughout the study. The experimental protocol and procedures for animal handling were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Faculty of Pharmacy, Delta University for Science and Technology, Gamasa, Egypt (Approval Number: FPDU12/2023), which tracks the ARRIVE guidelines and the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, 2011). Also, all methods were performed following these relevant guidelines and regulations. Following a one-week acclimation period, the rats were randomly allocated into three groups, each containing six animals.

Intervention from the 6th to 12th week allows assessment of curcumin’s therapeutic rather than preventive effects 15 17 At the end of the study, rats were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and blood samples were collected from the heart via cardiac puncture. Blood samples were left to clot before centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min, and the resulting serum was stored at -20°C for later biochemical analyses. Liver tissues were harvested, weighed, and divided into two portions. The liver wet weight was recorded to estimate the liver index employing the formula: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{Liverindex}}\\, = \\,{\\text{wet weight of liver}}/{\\text{body weight}}\\, \\times \\,{1}00\\%$$\\end{document} One portion of the liver was homogenized for the quantification of oxidative stress markers (reduced glutathione [GSH] and malondialdehyde [MDA]). The other portion was preserved in RNA later (Qiagen, Germany) at 4°C overnight and then stored at − 80°C for subsequent molecular analysis. Formalin-fixed liver samples were prepared for histological and immunohistochemical examination. Body weight monitoring and weight gain The body weight of each animal was documented at the beginning and terminal of the study. Weight gain was calculated using the formula: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\mathbf{Weight}} \\, {\\mathbf{gain}}\\, = \\,{\\mathbf{final}} \\, {\\mathbf{weight}} \\, \\left( {{\\mathbf{gm}}} \\right){-\\!\\!-}{\\mathbf{starting}} \\, {\\mathbf{weight}} \\, \\left( {{\\mathbf{gm}}} \\right)$$\\end{document} Biochemical analysis Fasting blood glucose and insulin: Fasting blood glucose levels were recorded using an ACCU-CHEK glucometer.

Liver function tests Serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) levels were measured using clinical test kits from Elitech (UK) and analyzed spectrophotometrically. Oxidative stress markers in liver tissue Liver levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured using specialized kits (Biodiagnostic, Giza, Egypt). Inflammatory markers (TNF-α and IL-1β) ELISA kits (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) were used to assess Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) concentrations in liver homogenates according to the constructer’s instructions. The hepatic concentration of Gasdermin D (GSDMD) was determined using a rat-specific ELISA kit (Cat # SEE529Ra, Cloud-Clone Corp., USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Liver samples were homogenized and centrifuged to obtain clear supernatants. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader, and GSDMD concentrations were calculated from the standard curve and expressed as ng/mg protein. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time pcr (qrt-pcr) for becn1 gene expression For the analysis of BECN1 gene expression, RNA was obtained using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep Plus kit (Cat# R2072, ZYMO RESEARCH CORP., USA), and RNA purity and concentration were evaluated with a Beckman dual spectrophotometer (USA). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using, the Takara SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) on an Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany (ABI 7300 instrument). In the case of BECN1, reverse transcription and PCR were conducted in a single step utilizing the SuperScript IV RT-PCR kit (Cat# 12,594,100, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on a StepOne real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). Sangon Biotech Co. (Shanghai, China) created specific primers for BECN1 and housekeeping genes (detailed in Table 1 Table 1 Sequence of BECN1 and housekeeping primers: Forward sequence Reverse sequence Reference BECN1 AGCACGCCATGTATAGCAAAGA GGAAGAGGGAAAGGACAGCAT NM_001197217.1 GAPDH GCATCCTGCACCACCAACTG GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTT XM_063279674.1 Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2^ − ΔΔCt method. For BECN1, the cycle threshold (Ct) standardised to the housekeeping gene GAPDH, and relative quantification (RQ) quantified by the same method. Western blot analysis for P62 Total protein was extracted using a Bio-Rad protein extraction kit (Catalog #163–2086). Protein levels were determined by a Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Bio Basic Inc., Canada). Polyacrylamide gels were prepared using the TGX Stain-Free™ FastCast™ Acrylamide Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Catalog #161–0181). The membranes were blocked with tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) and 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies against P62 (Proteintech, Catalog #18,420–1-AP) were incubated overnight, followed by Goat anti-rabbit IgG incubation, Novus Biologicals. Chemiluminescent signals were detected using a CCD camera-based imager, and band intensities were analyzed using ChemiDoc MP image software. Beta-actin was used as a loading control. The contrast in the displayed blot was not digitally manipulated beyond standard adjustments for clarity. No high-contrast modifications were applied that could alter the interpretation of the results. Full-length, unprocessed blots are provided in the Supplementary Information for transparency Supplementary figure S2 Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis for NLRP3, IL-1β, TNF-α and caspase-1 Liver samples were preserved in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 µm thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for routine histological evaluation, while Masson’s trichrome staining was used to detect collagen fibers. For immunohistochemical staining, sections were treated with primary antibodies against NLRP3 (Invitrogen, Catalog No. PA5-115,661, 1:100 dilution), IL-1β, TNF-α and caspase-1 (Servicebio, Wuhan, China; dilutions of 1:800 and 1:600, respectively). Secondary antibodies were applied, and the stained slices were examined under a microscope. All photos were reserved with ICC50E Camera Module (Leica Microsystems AG) by LEICA DM 750 Microscope at the Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Ibn Sina University for Medical Sciences, Amman, Jordan. Morphometric analysis The percentage area of collagen in Masson’s trichrome-stained slices (400 × magnification) and the immunopositive areas for NLRP3, IL-1β, TNF-α, and caspase-1 (400 × magnification) were computed through ImageJ software (version 1.52a). Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism version 10.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) was used for creating bar graphs and visualizing group comparisons. . One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey’s test was employed to assess differences among the groups, while an independent t-test was used to compare two groups. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Results Impact of curcumin on body weight, weight gain, liver weight, and liver index The findings revealed no notable differences in the initial body weights across the experimental groups at baseline. Nevertheless, Group II experienced a marked elevation in body weight, weight gain, liver weight, and liver index compared to the control group (P < 0.001). Conversely, Group III demonstrated significantly (P < 0.001) reduced values for these parameters compared to Group II. The final measurements remained significantly (P < 0.01) higher in Group III relative to Group I, as presented in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Impact of curcumin on body weight, weight gain, liver weight, and liver index in experimental groups. Group II exhibited significant increases in all parameters, while curcumin (Group III) significantly mitigated these changes. Data are presented as mean ± SD. (n = 6 in each group). Impact of curcumin on serum biochemical measures Group II (HFFD) exhibited significantly (P ≤ 0.001) elevated levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum insulin, and HOMA-IR compared to Group I (control). The introduction of curcumin in Group III (HFFD + Curcumin) led to a significant (P ≤ 0.001) reduction in these parameters relative to Group II. Despite these reductions, FBG and HOMA-IR levels in Group III remained significantly higher than in Group I, however, serum insulin differences between Groups I and III were not statistically significant (P = 0.23). Regarding lipid profiles, Group II showed significant increases in triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and LDL-C (P ≤ 0.001), alongside a non-significant decrease in HDL-C (P = 0.86) compared to Group I. Curcumin supplementation in Group III significantly improved lipid parameters in comparison to Group II (P ≤ 0.001), with non-significant differences observed between Groups I and III (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Impact of curcumin on fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and lipid profile. Data are stated as mean ± SD, with P ≤ 0.05 statistical significance. Abbreviations: FBG = fasting blood glucose, HOMA-IR = homeostasis model assessment, TC = total cholesterol, TG = triglycerides, LDL = low-density lipoprotein, HDL = high-density lipoprotein. (n = 6 for each group). Group II induced metabolic dysfunction, whereas curcumin (Group III) improved glycemic and lipid parameters. Impact of curcumin on liver function, oxidative stress, and inflammatory markers Significant elevations (P < 0.001) in both serum ALT and AST levels were observed in Group II compared to Group I. In contrast, Group III exhibited notable reductions in both enzymes relative to Group II. No significant change was found between Groups I and III, indicating that curcumin effectively normalized enzyme levels, as shown in Fig. 3 3 3 3 Fig. 3 ( A B C D Impact of curcumin on BECN1 Gene and P62 protein expression qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated a significant downregulation of BECN1 gene expression in Groups II and III in comparison to Group I (P ≤ 0.001). However, curcumin supplementation in Group III significantly upregulated BECN1 expression compared to Group II (P ≤ 0.001), although levels remained lower than in Group I, indicating partial recovery (Fig. 4 4 S2 Fig. 4 ( A B S2 Histopathological analysis of liver tissues Liver sections from Group I demonstrated normal hepatic structure, characterized by hepatocytes organized in cords radiating from the central vein and separated by distinct blood sinusoids. The hepatocytes appeared polyhedral with granular, acidophilic cytoplasm and large, rounded nuclei, some of which were binucleated (Fig. 5 5 Fig. 5 Histological assessment of liver tissue structure and fibrosis. Figure 5 (1): Microscopic images of H&E-staining sections from Group I. ( A B A B C D A B In contrast, liver tissues from Group II showed marked structural abnormalities, including dilated central veins, disrupted sinusoidal endothelial lining, and vacuolated hepatocytes. Several hepatocytes appeared shrunken with pyknotic nuclei, accompanied by dense mononuclear cell infiltration around the central veins and within portal areas (Fig. 5 5 Liver sections from Group III displayed an architecture nearly comparable to the control group, with only slight dilation of the central vein and sinusoids in certain areas (Fig. 5 Masson’s trichrome staining revealed minimal collagen deposition around the central veins and portal tracts in Group I (Fig. 6 6 6 Fig. 6 Masson’s trichrome staining for collagen deposition in liver tissues. Masson’s trichrome-stained liver sections showing collagen deposition. Group I [Figure A, B] displayed minimal perivascular collagen (arrows). Group II [Figure C, D] exhibited extensive fibrosis (arrows), while Group III [Figure E, F] showed markedly reduced collagen accumulation (arrows) indicating curcumin’s anti-fibrotic effect. (Magnification: X400). Immunohistochemical Examination Immunohistochemical analysis was carried out to evaluate the expression of NLRP3, IL-1β, TNF-α, and caspase-1 across all experimental groups of liver tissue. In Group I, liver sections exhibited a faint positive cytoplasmic immunoreaction for all markers, indicating low basal expression levels (Fig. 7 7 7 Fig. 7 Immunohistochemical staining for pyroptotic and inflammatory markers. Figure 7 (1). Immunohistochemical analysis of NLRP3 and IL-1β expression in liver tissues. HFFD-induced inflammation in Group II ( B C D A E F G A F Morphometric and Statistical Findings Morphometric analysis was used to quantify the area percentage of positive staining for NLRP3, IL-1β, TNF-α, and caspase-1, as well as collagen deposition in liver tissue. The area percentage of NLRP3 and IL-1β was significantly elevated in Group II comparable to Group I. Curcumin treatment in Group III significantly reduced the expression of these markers compared to Group II (P ≤ 0.001). However, the expression of NLRP3 and IL-1β in Group III remained slightly higher than in Group I, though the difference was not significant, suggesting partial recovery (Fig. 7 The morphometric data for TNF-α and caspase-1 showed a similar trend. A significant (P ≤ 0.001) rise in the positive staining area percentage was detected in Group II in comparison to Group I. Curcumin treatment in Group III directed a significance decline in the expression of these markers compared to Group II (P ≤ 0.001), with a non-significant difference between Group III and Group I, indicating curcumin effectively normalized the levels of TNF-α and caspase-1 (Fig. 7 (2 M). Furthermore, Masson’s trichrome evaluates the collagen deposition. In control group, liver sections displayed thin collagen fibers around the portal tracts and central veins (8.464 ± 0.583). In contrast, liver sections from Group II showed extensive collagen accumulation around the portal tracts and central veins, reflecting significant fibrosis (15.68 ± 1.07, P ≤ 0.001). Curcumin treatment in Group III markedly reduced collagen deposition compared to Group II, with a non-significant difference from the control group, indicating that curcumin prevented fibrosis progression and helped restore normal liver architecture. Discussion The growing prevalence of MAFLD and complications, as hepatocellular carcinoma, contributed to global disease burden 19 20 21 Liver disease progression is linked to inflammasome activation, despite mechanisms and effective treatments remain unclear 22 A 12-week HFFD resulted in significant weight gain, a rise in both liver weight and liver index. These observations are consistent with Mustika et al. (2023) 23 24 25 The present study observed that HFFD led to hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance, aligning with findings from Cho . 26 . 25 27 28 In the present study, the HFFD elevated TG, TC, and LDL-C, while HDL-C levels decreased. Curcumin improved the lipid profile, , consistent with Al-Saud 27 Ding . (2016) 29 Curcumin exhibited hepatoprotective properties by normalizing antioxidant enzyme activity (GSH) and decreasing MDA levels, consistent with prior study 30 31 The NLRP3 inflammasome is pivotal in intensifying liver inflammation, and pyroptosis 32 33 22 5 5 34 Furthermore, Wang et al. (2021) demonstrated that inhibiting NLRP3 reduces steatosis and cytokine expression 35 . 6 36 In this study also, curcumin significantly reduced hepatic GSDMD levels, indicating suppression of pyroptotic activity. These findings provide molecular evidence for curcumin’s anti-pyroptotic effect, supporting recent findings 37 38 39 9 40 Curcumin restored autophagy in HFFD-fed rats by increasing BECN1 and reducing p62. BECN1 promotes autophagosome formation, and reduced p62 reflects restored autophagic flux. These effects may be mediated through AMPK/mTOR and PI3KC3 signaling 41 Curcumin supports antifibrotic effects via autophagy promotion. BECN1 knockdown reduces this effect. It also lowers ROS by activating PPAR-α and AMPK/mTOR 42 43 44 45 46 47 49 Although TNF-α is not pyroptosis-specific, its elevated expression and histological evidence indicate pyroptosis in MAFLD. For clearer confirmation, GSDMD strengthens the mechanistic link between pyroptosis and hepatic injury. 50 Curcumin’s clinical use is limited by poor bioavailability due to rapid metabolism and low solubility. Strategies like piperine co-administration, nanoparticles, or analogs may improve its absorption and therapeutic efficacy 48 P62 and BECN1 levels were used to assess autophagy, but they also function in other pathways. Lack of LC3-II/I ratio analysis limits assessment depth. Future studies should include dynamic autophagy flux assays and LC3-based analysis 51 52 53 54 Conclusion Our research indicates that curcumin is an effective natural therapeutic agent for MAFLD. It improves metabolic disturbances linked to HFFD consumption, enhances autophagy, and inhibits inflammasome activity, reducing liver inflammation and fibrosis. These findings further support curcumin’s therapeutic potential from a functional food perspective, emphasizing its dual regulatory role in pyroptosis and autophagy.
