It is a key molecule in regulating immune response by interacting with its receptor, CD40, which is found on various immune cells 4 7 6 5 4 5 5 6 Recently, CD40LG has garnered significant attention within the oncology realm owing to its implication in shaping the tumor microenvironment. CD40LG has been detected in a variety of tumors and has the capability to influence the immune response by enhancing the activation and infiltration of immune cells like T cells, macrophages, and B cells 4 7 4 4 8 8 Additionally, CD40LG has been associated with controlling cell proliferation and oncogenic conversion, suggesting its promise as a therapeutic target 9 10 11 In this investigation, we evaluated the expression of CD40LG in 94 samples of LUAD tissue alongside their respective adjacent non-cancerous tissues utilizing immunohistochemical staining techniques. Furthermore, the relationship between the infiltration of multiple immune cell populations and CD40LG expression was investigated, with a particular focus on elucidating the potential immunomodulatory function of CD40LG in LUAD. This was achieved through the performance of multiple immunofluorescence staining (mIF) on tissue microarrays. The objective of this research is to elucidate the significant role of CD40LG in NSCLC and to uncover the mechanisms through which CD40LG may influence tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Methods Data sources The unified pan-cancer dataset was constructed by merging RNA-seq data from the unified pan-cancer dataset was constructed by merging RNA-seq data from TCGA and TARGET databases. Batch effects were minimized using ComBat algorithm and gene expression values were normalized to transcripts per million (TPM). Differential expression and clinical feature analyses were conducted using R software. We collected data from the Kaplan-Meier Plotter. This dataset encompasses prognostic information for patients undergoing immunotherapy across various cancer types 12 GSE118370 GSE43458 GSE30219 GSE31210 GSE72094 Prognostic analysis A thorough prognostic dataset sourced from a study based on TCGA was acquired 13 Immune cell infiltration and immune score analysis This investigation employed six different techniques to analyze tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs), utilizing algorithms available in the R package IOBR software package 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Lung adenocarcinoma tissue microchip and Immunohistochemistry We acquired tissue microchips consisting of 94 pairs of LUAD tissues and Paracancerous tissues from Saville Biotech (Wuhan, China). Inclusion criteria included (1) no preoperative chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy; (2) radical lung cancer surgery (including lobectomy, composite lobectomy, sleeve resection, and total pneumo-nectomy) + systematic lymph node dissection; (3) confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the lung; and (4) complete medical history. Each specimen was evaluated using a semi-quantitative scoring system (0-12) by multiplying the staining intensity score (0: negative; 1: weak; 2: moderate; 3: strong) by the percentage of positive cells (1: 1-25%; 2: 26-50%; 3: 51-75%; 4: 76-100%). Two blinded pathologists independently assessed all slides, with discordant cases (score difference >3) resolved through consensus review. Table 1 Multiplex immunofluorescence Yucebio Technology in Shenzhen, China, conducted multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) staining and initial assessment. They processed 5 μm thick paraffin embedded tissue sections, dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated, and fixed. The slides were then stained with various markers and imaged using Vectra Polaris (Akoya Biosciences). Imaging was performed at 20× resolution (0.5 μm/pixel) using Vectra Polaris with spectral unmatching error <5%. Cell transfection The cell lines, A549, H1975, PC9, H1299, and H1650, were acquired from the ATCC. For transfection experiments, Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) was utilized to deliver either CD40LG-specific siRNA or a scrambled control siRNA (Ribobio). A549 cells were transfected with either pCDNA3.1-CD40LG (Biomed Gene, China) or pCDNA3.1 containing a non-targeting sequence using Lipofectamine 2000. Western blot We commenced by extracting, quantifying, and subsequently separating protein samples on 10% agarose gels. Employing a semidry transfer system, we transferred these samples onto PVDF membranes. To mitigate nonspecific binding, the membranes underwent blocking with 5% milk at 25°C for 2h. Subsequently, they were incubated with the primary antibody against GAPDH (1:1,000, 60004-1-lg, Proteintech) and CD40LG (1:1,000, 16668-1-AP, Proteintech) at 4°C overnight. Then, membranes were probed with secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, diluted at 1:5,000) at 25°C for 1h. Visualization of protein bands were using Pierce ECL substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transwell assay In migration experiment, A549 and H1975 were introduced on the upper chamber in a serum-free medium, while the lower chamber was supplied with 10% serum medium. A549 and H1975 that traversed to the lower chamber were immobilized in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet after a 24-hour incubation period. Transwell chambers were precoated with Matrigel firstly in invasion assays. Scratch wound-healing assay The experiment commenced with the inoculation of cells into 6-well plates, where they were nurtured until reaching confluency. Subsequently, a controlled wound was induced utilizing a pipette tip, followed by a thorough cleansing of the cellular milieu with PBS. Then, the cells were subjected to an environment devoid of serum, and the progression of wound closure was meticulously observed at distinct intervals employing microscope. Statistical analysis The Wilcoxon Tests were utilized for unpaired data. The Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized for multiple groups data. Pearson's correlation coefficient was employed to ascertain correlations, and survival analysis was conducted employing the Log-rank test. A P Results Down-Regulation of CD40LG in Multiple Cancer Types and Its Prognostic Value In 14 out of 34 cancer types analyzed, CD40LG exhibited significant down-regulation in tumor specimens, including KICH, ACC, UCEC, SKCM, LUAD, READ, BLCA, LUSC, WT, THCA, READ, UCS, ALL, and HNSC (Figure 1 1 1 1 1 Supplementary Figure 1 Decreased expression of CD40LG also indicated higher TNM stage in LUAD and KIRP ( Supplementary Figure 2 Supplementary Figure 2 Supplementary Figure 2 Supplementary Figure 2 Supplementary Figure 2 Exploring the Relationship Between CD40LG Expression and Immunotherapeutic Response Across Diverse Cancer Types We obtained prognostic data for patients undergoing immunotherapy from the Kaplan-Meier plotter database. The subjects were categorized according to varying levels of CD40LG expression. The findings consistently demonstrate that individuals exhibiting elevated CD40LG expression within tumor tissues exhibited significantly improved prognoses in terms of both OS (HR=0.57, P <0.0001, Figure 2 2 2 2 The important role of CD40LG expression in lung adenocarcinoma Drawing from the findings delineated above, it is discernible that the manifestation of CD40LG in LUAD evinces significant associations with patient prognosis and clinical staging. Moreover, its presence bears relevance to patient prognostication subsequent to immunotherapeutic interventions. Therefore, we will focus on the role of CD40LG expression in LUAD. In our analysis of several public databases, including TCGA (Figure 3 GSE118370 3 GSE43458 3 GSE30219 3 GSE31210 3 GSE72094 3 3 3 3 CD40LG expression correlates with LUAD immune microenvironment In the TCGA database for LUAD, we calculated the Immunophenoscore (IPS) for patients. The immune priming system (IPS) is comprised of four essential elements: MHC molecules, which are represented antigen presentation; suppressor cells (SC), which regulate immune reactions; effector cells (EC), which execute immune responses; and immune checkpoints (CP), which modulate immune activity. The IPS-Score serves as an indicator of tumor immunogenicity. Our study shows a positive correlation between IPS score and CD40LG expression (Figure 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 IHC verification of CD40LG expression in lung adenocarcinoma tissues For additional validation, we procured tissue microarrays comprising 94 pairs of LUAD tissues alongside their corresponding paracancerous tissues. Comprehensive clinical baseline information is detailed in Table 1 5 2 5 5 5 CD40LG expression was correlated with LUAD immune cell infiltration To investigate the associtation between immune cell infiltration and CD40LG expression in greater detail, we employed multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) technique to identify the presence of specific immune cells in tissue microarrays. Table 3 6 4 Furthermore, using panCK staining, we divided the tissues into total, tumor, and stromal regions, and conducted a correlation analysis between the percentage of immune cells and CD40LG_IHC_Score in each region. A positive correlation was observed between the CD40LG IHC score and the proportion of CD8+T cells in the total region, cancer region, and stromal region. All p values are less than 0.0001, and the correlation coefficients are greater than 0.4 (Figure 6 6 6 6 CD40LG expression is linked to the proliferation and migration of LUAD cells To further analyze the impact of CD40LG on LUAD cells, we examined CD40LG protein expression level in five LUAD cell lines, including A549, H1975, PC-9, H1299, and H1650, using Western blot analysis. Our analysis revealed that H1975 cells exhibited the highest CD40LG expression, while A549 cells showed the lowest levels (Figure 7 7 Through the EDU assay, we discovered that knocking down CD40LG in H1975 cells significantly enhanced their proliferative capacity, whereas overexpressing CD40LG in A549 cells significantly reduced their proliferative capacity (Figure 7 7 7 Discussion In our investigation, our study revealed that higher CD40LG expression inversely correlated with higher TNM stages and T stages in LUAD. This observation suggests that decreased CD40LG levels may contribute to tumor progression, aligning with previous reports that link lower CD40LG expression to more advanced cancer stages and poor prognoses 11 Our research also highlights the association of high CD40LG expression with improved responses to immunotherapy, outperforming traditional biomarkers in predictive efficacy. This finding is particularly noteworthy given the current emphasis on immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Previous research has suggested that CD40LG has the potential to augment the effectiveness of immunotherapy by altering the immune microenvironment in a manner conducive to eliciting anti-tumor reactions 4 7 Furthermore, our findings indicated that CD40LG protein level was closely associated with multiple immune cell infiltration, including macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells. Notably, CD8+ T cells infiltration exhibited the strongest correlation with CD40LG expression, with the highest correlation coefficient observed in this regard. These findings align with prior studies indicating that CD40LG is crucial in modulating the immune response within the tumor microenvironment. For example, prior studies have elucidated the capacity of CD40LG to augment immune response through its promotion of immune cell infiltration and activation, as well as its stimulation of cytokine synthesis. These mechanisms collectively support the elicitation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) reactions 4 8 4 7 In vitro In summary, our investigation delineates the intricate functions of CD40LG within the context of LUAD, highlighting its importance in both immune modulation and direct tumor cell behavior. Compared to PD-L1 IHC (current gold standard), CD40LG quantification showed comparable inter-observer concordance. However, the cost-effectiveness of multiplex CD40LG assessment needs evaluation against existing biomarker panels. While our study leveraged bulk RNA-seq data and advanced deconvolution algorithms to characterize immune infiltration, these approaches cannot capture the spatial organization of immune cells within tumor microenvironment. Emerging spatial transcriptomics technologies may provide complementary insights into CD40LG's role in orchestrating immune cell localization. Future research should focus on further elucidating the mechanistic pathways through which CD40LG exerts its effects and exploring its potential in clinical applications for LUAD treatment.
