Its functional role was subsequently validated through a series of in vitro Material and methods Obtaining of tissue samples from OSCC patients OSCC patients who underwent surgeries in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Hainan Provincial People’s Hospital from November 2023 to April 2024 were collected. Three pairs of OSCC and adjacent normal tissues were acquired. After the surgically excised tissue specimens are removed from the body, they are washed with normal saline and then placed in a −80 °C refrigerator within half an hour. Inclusion criteria included patients without chemotherapy or radiotherapy before surgery, and tissue specimens that were pathologically confirmed as oral squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with cancer in other parts of the body were excluded. The medical ethics committee of Hainan General Hospital approved the current study (ethic approval no. [2024] 240). Written informed consent was acquired from the patients before the operation. RNA extraction Following the specifications, total RNA was collected with the use of Trizol reagent (15596018CN, Thermofisher, Waltham, MA). Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (5067-1511, Agilent, CA, USA) was used to measure the quantity and purity of RNA, with RIN number > 7.0. About five µg of RNA was utilized to deplete ribosomal RNA through the Ribo-Zero Gold rRNA Removal Kit (MRZG12324, Illumina, San Diego, USA). Afterwards, employing divalent cations, the remanent RNAs were split into short fragments at a high temperature. Thereafter, reverse transcription of the RNA fragments into cDNA was achieved with the use of SuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase (1896649, Invitrogen, USA). Next, the U-labeled second-stranded DNAs was synthesized by E. coli DNA polymerase I (m0209, NEB, USA), RNase H (NEB, cat.m0297, USA) and dUTP Solution (R0133, Thermo Fisher, USA). A-base was added to the blunt ends of each strand to ligate to the indexed adapters that contained a T-base overhang. The fragments were then ligated with either single- or dual-index adapters, followed by size selection (300–600 bp) using the AMPureXP beads. The ligated products were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after the U-labeled second-stranded DNAs were treated with the heat-labile UDG enzyme (m0280, NEB, USA). Specifically, the following conditions were set to carry out PCR amplification: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min; 8 cycles at 98 °C for 15 s, at 60 °C for 15 s, at 72 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 5 min. The cDNA library had an average insert size of 300 ± 50 bp. The final libraries were subjected to paired-end 150 bp sequencing (2 × 150 bp, PE150) on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (LC-Bio Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China). The sequencing depth per sample exceeded 20 million reads. Quality control of raw reads was performed using FastQC (v0.11.9), and reads with Phred quality score >30 for more than 85% of bases were retained for downstream analysis. The overall Q30 percentage and GC content were reported to ensure high-quality sequencing data. CircRNA identification of self-measured datasets Circular RNAs were de novo Quantification of circRNA abundance To quantitatively compare back splicing from different RNA-seq, the back-spliced reads (support for circRNA) were normalized through read length and number of mapped reads (spliced reads per billion mapping, SRPBM). The number of reads mapped to the reference genome in the samples was quantified, followed by normalizing the number of reads spanning the back-spliced junction to the total number of mapped reads (units in billion) and read length. The Perl script was utilized to calculate the SRPBM value for circRNA in each sample, which served as the abundance of expression. SRPBM = number of circular reads/number of mapped reads (units in billion)/read length. Data sources The dataset used in this study includes public datasets and self-measured datasets obtained according to the previous methods. The public dataset was the GSE131182 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131182 Differential analysis Employing the limma package ( Ritchie et al., 2015 GSE131182 2 FoldChange p p Enrichment analysis Parental genes for circRNAs up-regulated in OSCC were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis in three categories (biological process, cellular component, and molecular function) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis using the “clusterProfiler” R package ( Wang et al., 2025 Identification of key circRNAs The circRNAs with top50 associated with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) were identified using CircNet2.0 ( https://awi.cuhk.edu.cn/ CircNet/php/index.php Construction of competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network The target miRNAs of key circRNAs were obtained by taking intersections through CircNet2.0 website and miRDB ( https://mirdb.org/ Shannon et al., 2003 https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1 Cell culture Human OSCC WSU-HN30 (IM-H729) and HSC-3 (IM-H705) were obtained from Immocell ( http://www.immocell.com/ 2 Cell transfection and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) The WSU-HN30 and HSC-3 cells were transfected with the hsa_circ_0000831 interference plasmid employing the Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Kit (11668027, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The plasmids (sh-hsa_circ_0000831 and sh-NC) were synthesized and constructed by GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and sequence verification was performed prior to transfection. The targeting sequence was 5′-GCTGTTTCTACACTTGCTAGG-3′, and negative control was set up. And sh-NC represents the negative control, while sh-hsa_circ_0000831 represents the WSU-HN30 or HSC-3 cells transfected with hsa_circ_0000831. After transfection, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. After extracting RNA following a similar procedure as described previously, direct reverse transcription was performed. After generating cDNA, quantitative reverse transcription (qRT-PCR) was applied to test the transfection efficiency. The primer pairs were as follows: hsa_circ_0000831-F 5′-CGAGGTATAGCAGAAGAATCA-3′, hsa_circ_0000831-R 5′-CTTGGTTCAGCATCACTCT-3′; GAPDH GAPDH −ΔΔCT Zhang & Li, 2021 GAPDH Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay Cell proliferation was examined using the Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, C0037, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Transfected WSU-HN30 and HSC-3 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 5 ×10 3 2 Ma et al., 2023 Wound healing assay The transfected WSU-HN30 and HSC-3 cells were planted into 6-well plates respectively. After reaching full confluence, a sterile pipette tip was employed to make a straight scratch on the monolayer cells for creating an artificial wound. Next, after removing the used medium, Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) (C0221A, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was used for washing the cells twice to discard cell debris. Then, the culture dishes were returned to the incubator after the addition of fresh serum-free medium under the original culture conditions for further incubation. The culture dishes were taken out at 0 h and 48 h respectively, and the scratched areas were photographed using a microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). The wound width changes were analyzed by ImageJ software, and the migration capability of WSU-HN30 and HSC-3 cells was reflected by wound closure rated at each time point measured. Transwell assay The polycarbonate membrane (pore size: eight µm, 3422, Corning, Inc, Corning, NY, USA) of a 24-well plate was pre-coated with Matrigel (C0372, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). The upper transwell chamber had 200 µL of serum-free medium, whereas the lower transwell chamber contained 700 µL of medium and 10% FBS. After 48 h, 4% paraformaldehyde (P0099, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was employed to fix the cells invading into the lower chamber, and 0.1% crystal violet (C0121, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was used for dyeing the cells for 30 min. The cells were observed and quantified from three random fields of the inverted optical microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) to evaluate the invasive ability of WSU-HN30 and HSC-3 cells. Flow cytometry After digesting the transfected WSU-HN30 and HSC-3 cells with 0.25% trypsin and cell washing with PBS (C0221A, Beyotime, China), Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (C1062S, Beyotime) was employed to dye the cells, followed by using a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) for the detection of apoptosis. Statistical analysis All the data were analyzed by R 4.2.0 software and GraphPad Prism 8. For two variables, the Unpaired t test was used for statistical test. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Sidak’s multiple comparisons test were employed for three or more variables. Mean ± standard deviation (SD) was used to express the data. Differences in expression between OSCC and control samples were compared using the wilcoxon rank-sum test.

In this study, we took the top 5 miRNAs predicted to match hsa_circ_0000831 through CircNet 2.0 website, which were hsa-miR-136-5p, hsa-miR-100-3p, hsa-miR-144-5p, hsa-miR-149-5p and hsa-miR-214-5p, and the corresponding target genes were obtained by taking the intersection of CircNet and miRDB ( Fig. 6A Fig. 6B 10.7717/peerj.20082/fig-6 Figure 6 The ceRNA network prediction and enrichment analysis.

Discussion OSCC is a common malignant HNSC, which is mostly found in an advanced-stage and exhibits a terrible prognosis ( Ge et al., 2015 Chen et al., 2023b Patop & Kadener, 2018 In this study, a circRNA, hsa_circ_0000831, derived from the CEP192 Chen et al., 2022 in vitro CEP192 Cai, Song & Yu, 2020 Liu et al. (2022) CEP192 Luo et al., 2022 CEP192 Sakshi et al., 2021 Saikishore et al., 2020 Qi et al., 2015 Wei et al., 2022 Chee et al., 2025 Liu et al., 2021 Zhan et al., 2021 Shi et al., 2020 Ma et al., 2022 Functional enrichment analysis of hsa_circ_0000831 downstream target genes suggested that it was primarily enriched in several related pathways. Among them, the enrichment of cancer pathways further implied that hsa_circ_0000831 affects the occurrence of OSCC through circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction ( Li et al., 2021 Burassakarn et al., 2021 Yu et al., 2024 The present study contained several limitations to be pointed out. First, the sample size used in this study was small, which may have led to individual differences or biases, limiting the generalizability of the results. Future studies will expand the clinical sample size and introduce OSCC tissue samples from multiple centers and regions for validation to improve the statistical power and representativeness of the study. In addition, the ceRNA network construction is mainly based on bioinformatics predictions and has not yet been verified by molecular biology experiments. In the future, the direct binding relationship between hsa_circ_0000831 and predicted miRNAs can be verified by methods such as dual luciferase reporter assays and RNA pull-down, and the regulatory role of downstream target genes can be further confirmed. Finally, the current functional experiments have only been conducted in the OSCC cell line, and its role in animal models or clinical tissues has not yet been evaluated. Therefore, in subsequent studies, we will construct an OSCC mouse xenograft model to validate the role of hsa_circ_0000831 in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and treatment response in vivo Conclusion In this study, hsa_circ_0000831 was successfully identified based on clinical sample data and public databases.
