However, during the last years, several reports have demonstrated the existence of non-canonical RGD-containing integrin ligands that are cell surface transmembrane proteins. At variance with the canonical extracellular matrix integrin ligands, the RGD-containing cell surface integrin ligands are involved in cell–cell adhesion processes and function as “integrin counter-receptors”. We propose in this review grouping these transmembrane proteins, which include endoglin, cadherin-5, cadherin-6, cadherin-17, ADAM15, and L1CAM, under the newly coined acronym RGD-ICRs (RGD-containing Integrin Counter-Receptors). We present and discuss the structure of RGD-ICRs, their RGD-based interactions with integrins, the specific signaling pathways triggered in different cell types, as well as their pathophysiological involvement. It can be postulated that RGD-ICRs constitute an emerging group of non-canonical RGD-based integrin counter-receptors. In spite of being encoded by different and independent genes and involved in different pathophysiological processes, all of them appear to have undergone a strong evolutionary convergence in order to acquire the same functional capacity to bind integrins via the RGD motif. Importantly, these RGD-ICRs are also emerging as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets, with promising clinical potential in a wide array of pathologies.

Despite their strong involvement in cell adhesion processes, integrins should not be regarded merely as adhesion receptors, because they also work as important cell signaling receptors. In this regard, integrins transmit signals in a bidirectional manner that involves inside-out as well as outside-in signal transduction mechanisms (reviewed in [ 1 5 Structurally, integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins formed by the noncovalent association of an α and a β polypeptide subunit. The pairing of 14 different α subunits with 8 different β subunits gives rise in vertebrates to 24 distinct integrins. In several cases, one particular α subunit is found only in one integrin heterodimer, as it is the case for αL, αM, αX and αD subunits, that can only associate with the β2 subunit to form integrins αLβ2, αMβ2, αXβ2 and αDβ2, respectively. In other cases, however, one α subunit can associate with different β subunits, as in the case of αV, which is found in integrins αVβ1, αVβ3, αVβ5, αVβ6 and αVβ8. Likewise, several β subunits can only associate with a particular α subunit (for instance, the subunit β4 is only found in integrin α6β4), while other β subunits can associate with up to 12 different α subunits, as in the case of the β1 subunit (which can be found in integrins α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α4β1, α5β1, α6β1, α7β1, α8β1, α9β1, α10β1, α11β1, and αVβ1). Therefore, there exists a high degree of promiscuity in the associations between α and β integrin subunits. Integrins have been categorized into different subgroups on the basis of their subunit composition as well as on other criteria, such as their ligand-binding specificity or their restricted expression in selected cell types. When the first integrins were discovered in the 1980 s, they were initially classified into three subfamilies (termed β1-, β2-, and β3-integrins), according to the three β subunits identified at that time, which were shared by different α subunits [ 6 6 8 9 11 12 13 1 Fig. 1 Classification of the integrin receptor family into four large groups according to their ligand specificity, recognition motifs, and restricted expression on leukocytes. All integrin heterodimers are formed by the noncovalent association of distinct α and β subunits. Historically, the integrins were initially grouped into different subfamilies according to their β-chains (β1-, β2-, β3-subfamilies), but now, these categorizations are less in use. RGD, Arg–Gly–Asp; LVD, Leu–Asp–Val Integrin binding typically occurs through the recognition of specific short peptide sequences (motifs) on their ligands. Interestingly, these integrin-recognized motifs within ligands almost invariably contain an oxygenated acidic residue (E or D) [ 14 15 2 14 18 2+ 2 14 15 2+ 2 14 15 An in-depth coverage of the multiple ligands, expression and functional activation of integrins is out of the scope of this review, but readers are referred to excellent reviews covering these different aspects of integrin biology [ 2 14 15 19 22 The two best characterized specific sequences recognized by numerous integrins on their ligands are the motifs Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD) (recognized by integrins α2β1, α5β1, α8β1, αIIbβ3, αVβ3, αVβ5, αVβ6 and αVβ8) and Leu–Asp–Val (LDV) (recognized by integrins α4β1, α4β7, α9β1, αEβ7, αLβ2, αMβ2 and αXβ2) [ 13 14 19 23 27 Many canonical RGD-containing integrin ligands are extracellular proteins, such as fibronectin, vitronectin, and fibrinogen, which typically mediate crucial cell–ECM adhesion phenomena. However, several noncanonical RGD-containing integrin ligands are cell surface transmembrane proteins (also termed “integrin counter-receptors”) that are rather involved in cell–cell adhesion processes. Therefore, upon integrin recognition and binding of these RGD-containing counter-receptors, specific signaling pathways can be triggered in cells from both integrin and ligand counterparts, leading to important phenotypic and functional changes in the interacting cells. In this review, we will present and discuss the RGD-based interactions of integrins with a selection of transmembrane counter-receptors, including endoglin, cadherin-5, −6, and −17, ADAM15, and L1CAM, which are of utmost relevance in different physiological and pathological settings. We further propose grouping together these transmembrane proteins under the newly coined acronym RGD-containing integrin counter-receptors (RGD-ICRs). Endoglin (CD105) Protein structure Human endoglin is a type I integral membrane protein characterized by a large extracellular domain comprising 561 amino acids, a single hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and a short cytoplasmic tail [ 28 . 28 31 2 N 2 O 28 32 33 33 35 36 37 2 38 39 3 37 39 Homo sapiens Pongo abelii Macaca mulatta Gorilla gorilla Mus musculus Sus scrofa 32 40 Fig. 2 Structural representation of endoglin and betaglycan domains. Endoglin and betaglycan are type I membrane proteins characterized by a large extracellular domain, which includes a juxtamembrane zona pellucida (ZP) domain and an N-terminal orphan region (OR). Endoglin is a disulfide-linked dimer, while betaglycan is a monomer. Representative ligands (TGF-βs, BMPs and integrins) that bind to specific domains, the cytoplasmic (CYT) and transmembrane (TM) regions, and cysteines involved in endoglin disulfide bonds (C516 and C582) are indicated. Bottom: the cytoplasmic amino acid sequences shared by L-endoglin and S-endoglin isoforms are underlined. The scheme is not to scale. Part of this figure was created with BioRender.com Fig. 3 Schematic representation of endoglin structure. The orphan regions (OR1 and OR2), the zona pellucida domains (ZP-N and ZP-C), and the cysteines involved in disulfide bonds (C516 and C582), are indicated. The three-dimensional (3D) structure model on the right represents a fragment of the ZP-N subdomain encompassing the RGD motif. Part of this figure was created with BioRender.com The transmembrane domain of endoglin contains a characteristic stretch of ~25 uncharged, mainly hydrophobic amino acids connecting the large extracellular region with the short cytoplasmic domain. Moreover, endoglin’s cytoplasmic domain undergoes constitutive phosphorylation at serines and threonines [ 41 42 43 30 44 45 47 . Tissue distribution and functional activities Endoglin is well conserved among vertebrates and has been described in human, mouse, rat, chicken, and zebrafish species, among others [ 32 48 49 . 37 50 44 51 53 54 55 52 56 61 51 53 While most endoglin studies so far have focused on endothelial cells, there is an emerging interest for investigating the endoglin function in additional cell types such as keratinocytes, mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, hepatic stellate cells, macrophages, and cells from the hair follicle [ 50 62 66 Role in RGD-dependent integrin-mediated cell adhesion Multiple experimental findings indicate that endoglin plays a role in integrin function. Thus, the capacity of endothelial endoglin to act as a counter-receptor for integrins present in circulatory cells has been demonstrated during the last decade. The upregulated endoglin expression at inflammatory sites and areas of leukocyte infiltration has prompted studies exploring endoglin’s involvement in leukocyte trafficking. Following in vivo treatment with the inflammatory agents lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or carrageenan, leukocyte transendothelial migration to the peritoneum or lungs was significantly reduced in endoglin heterozygous ( Eng + /– ) Eng + / 40 40 Interactions between human endothelial endoglin and platelet integrins have also been reported [ 67 68 Eng +/− 37 hsEng⁺ 3 hsEng⁺ 36 40 67 36 67 The active role of endoglin regulating mural cell adhesion in the circulatory system has also been analyzed [ 36 Eng +/− 36 Aside from the contribution of endoglin to integrin-mediated cell adhesion, described above, endoglin has also been reported to participate in an integrin-mediated crosstalk with the TGF-β/BMP signaling cascade [ 69 69 70 71 The interplay between endoglin and integrins has also been postulated to be involved in bacterial infections, more specifically in the shedding of infected epithelial cells, also called exfoliation, which acts as a natural defense to inhibit bacterial colonization [ 72 73 73 72 Pathophysiological involvement and implications Since the early 1990 s, accumulated information supports the involvement of both membrane-bound endoglin and soluble endoglin in a wide spectrum of pathophysiological processes, including angiogenesis, endothelial dysfunction, fibrosis, inflammation, vascular pathology, hemostasis, hypertension, and cancer. In addition, the impact of endoglin on the diagnostics, etiology, or prognosis in various diseases such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, preeclampsia, cancer, hyperglycemia, atherosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, kidney and liver fibrosis, septic syndrome, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and systemic sclerosis has been reported [ 37 38 62 74 78 Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia Endoglin is implicated in several angiogenesis-related conditions, including the rare vascular disease hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a heterogeneous autosomal dominant disorder with prevalence estimated at 1 in 5000. Loss-of-function mutations in the endoglin gene ( ENG ACVRL1/ALK1 79 81 SMAD4 GDF2 ENG ACVRL1 SMAD4 GDF2 37 80 82 36 37 40 67 36 36 40 67 Eng +/- 67 83 37 84 64 85 Preeclampsia Soluble endoglin (sEng) can be shed from the cell surface transmembrane endoglin form upon the proteolytic activity of thrombin, MMP14 or MMP12 [ 45 47 86 87 88 88 36 89 90 90 88 90 91 91 92 36 Cancer Endoglin is expressed not only by certain tumor cells but also by various cell types within the tumor microenvironment, including endothelial cells of the tumor vasculature, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and tumor-associated lymphocytes (TALs). This tumor-associated expression pattern has prompted a wide range of investigative efforts to study endoglin as a prognostic, imaging, and potential therapeutic target in cancer [ 38 50 78 93 94 38 66 95 96 75 94 97 98 50 Cadherin-5, −6, and −17 Protein structure The cadherin family in humans comprises 29 members, all sharing multiple extracellular cadherin (EC) domains. These domains facilitate homotypic adhesion in a calcium ion-dependent manner, pivotal for cell–cell adhesion during vertebrate embryo morphogenesis and development [ 99 100 101 4 Fig. 4 Structure and function of RGD cadherins. A B C Consequently, the RGD-surrounding sequences differ, except for the closely related CDH6 and CDH20. However, the sequences preceding the RGD motif of CDH17 and both RGD motifs of CDH5 are characterized by a polar residue (Ser or Gln) at positions −2 or −3 and Leu at position −1, whereas CDH6 and CDH20 exhibit the sequences DQD and DMD, respectively, at such positions. Despite these differences, peptides harboring the RGD motif and flanking amino acid regions from these cadherins are recognized by integrins, except for the RGD motif of CDH16, which possesses a distinct preceding sequence (RAI) with a positively charged amino acid. The evolutionary origins of these motifs also vary [ 102 102 103 Tissue distribution and functional activities CDH5, also referred to as vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) and CD144, predominantly resides within the adherens junctions of endothelial cells found in blood and lymphatic vessels. As a vital constituent of cell–cell connections, CDH5 assumes a pivotal role in maintaining endothelial cohesion and permeability regulation [ 104 105 106 CDH6, also termed kidney cadherin (K-cadherin), primarily appears in the fetal kidney, orchestrating the epithelial differentiation within this organ [ 107 108 The expression pattern of CDH17, also termed liver intestine cadherin (LI-cadherin) or human intestinal peptide-associated transporter (HPT-1), is predominantly confined to colorectal enterocytes, Paneth cells, and goblet cells (see [ 26 109 110 111 112 113 Role in RGD-dependent cell adhesion The RGD motifs within CDH5 and CDH17 share similar specificity, likely due to the similitude in their flanking sequences. Despite αV integrin being considered the primary RGD receptor in many cells, cadherin RGD motifs do not act as ligands for this integrin. Instead, cadherin RGD motifs bind to α2β1 integrin, typically identified as a collagen receptor but not recognized as an RGD receptor [ 24 114 115 116 1 117 26 24 114 25 114 108 118 118 118 119 102 Pathophysiological involvement and implications The majority of investigations on cadherin RGD motifs have been conducted in cancer cell lines. Hence, we initially delineate the RGD activities of cadherins in pathological contexts. CDH17 is highly expressed in a significant proportion of colorectal tumors and other gastrointestinal malignancies, including gastric [ 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 136 114 118 24 118 114 The expression of CDH17 typically diminishes in the initial stages of colorectal cancer compared with normal mucosa and increases in advanced cancer stages, particularly in liver metastasis [ 137 118 114 118 24 103 3 103 138 As mentioned before, the potential physiological roles of RGD motifs in cadherins have been scarcely studied, except for the interaction of αIIbβ3 integrin with the CDH6 RGD motif in platelets. Activation of platelets provokes the exposition of CDH6 on the cell membrane to enable the interaction with αIIbβ3 integrin, thus contributing to platelet aggregation, a key event against bleeding from blood vessel injuries. This biological process may explain the ancient evolutionary origin of the RGD motif in CDH6. In addition, the CDH6/αIIbβ3 integrin association can also contribute to thrombus formation in several pathologies [ 108 Overall, RGD cadherins are expressed in tissues with high regeneration rates and subjected to abrasion or pressure, as CDH17 in colon, CDH5 in endothelium, or CDH6 in the proximal tubules of kidneys. In these tissues, RGD cadherins can promote stronger adhesion to basal membrane and increased proliferation/survival through the activation of integrins. Thus, CDH5 promotes endothelial cell survival, proliferation, and migration and, in coordination with integrins, participates in vascular network construction during angiogenesis [ 139 140 ADAM15 Protein structure ADAMs constitute a family of type-I transmembrane proteins with a multidomain modular structure that typically comprises a large extracellular region encompassing (from N- to C-terminus) the prodomain and catalytic- (also termed metalloproteinase domain), disintegrin-, cysteine-rich- and EGF-like-repeats domains, followed by single transmembrane and intracytoplasmic domains (Fig. 5 141 145 141 144 145 Fig. 5 General structure of a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAMs) (central), snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) (left) and a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motif (ADAMTSs) (right). Pro, prodomain; MP, metalloprotease/catalytic domain; D, disintegrin (-like) domain; C, cysteine-rich domain; TM, transmembrane domain. Created with BioRender.com The human genome contains 22 different ADAMs, of which only 12 possess the highly conserved catalytic Zn-binding motif ( H H H 141 146 ADAMs are synthesized as inactive proproteins (zymogens) that contain the prodomain, then translocate to the endoplasmic reticulum and further mature in the Golgi compartment. The prodomain plays important functions during the maturation of ADAMs in the late Golgi. By functioning as an intramolecular chaperone, the prodomain assists in proper protein folding and disulphide bonding formation, while also maintaining ADAMs in an inactive state during maturation through a “cysteine-switch” mechanism that inhibits its catalytic activity [ 142 147 149 142 147 150 151 The disintegrin domains present in ADAMs are structurally related to the snake venom disintegrins (SVDs), a family of small proteins that competitively inhibit integrin-mediated adhesion of platelets to their ligand fibrinogen, thus causing hemorrhagic effects. Integrin inhibition by SVDs is due to the presence of an RGD (or the related KGD) sequence at the end of a characteristic extended loop in these small proteins, termed the disintegrin loop. However, the analogous disintegrin domains in ADAMs (and also in ADAMTSs and SVMPs) should more correctly be called “disintegrin like” because, with the only exception of human ADAM15, they lack the defining RGD (or KGD) sequence in their disintegrin loops [ 141 152 154 155 XCD 141 153 154 145 156 158 141 145 159 161 156 6 Fig. 6 Schematic representation of ADAM15 structure. The different domains of ADAM15 are indicated: prodomain (Pro), metalloprotease (MP), disintegrin (D), cysteine-rich (C), EGF-like repeats, transmembrane (TM), and cytoplasmic tail. The model on the right shows the 3D structure of the disintegrin domain and the location of the RGD motif. Created with BioRender.com Tissue distribution and functional activities In contrast to many ADAMs (including ADAM-2, −7, −18, −20, −21, −29, and −30) that are expressed primarily in the testis, where they play different roles in spermatogenesis and sperm function (reviewed in [ 141 162 164 165 167 153 168 169 170 The human ADAM15 gene spans 11,367-bp and contains 23 exons and 22 introns. The exons 19–21 are used alternatively in different human tissues [ 153 171 153 168 172 175 164 168 176 177 178 178 Role in RGD-dependent cell adhesion As mentioned above, human ADAM15 is the only member of the ADAMs family that possesses an RGD integrin-binding sequence in its disintegrin-like loop, and, for this reason, ADAM15 is also named metargidin (metalloprotease-RGD-disintegrin protein) [ 153 179 180 181 182 183 Pathophysiological involvement and implications ADAM15 is abundantly expressed in vascular cells, including endothelial and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and is implicated in vascular pathologies, including atherosclerosis and pathological angiogenesis [ 162 164 184 185 162 166 166 Platelets are involved in different stages of atherosclerosis by contributing to the early recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes, acting as a bridge between endothelial cells and leukocytes and, at a later stage, by provoking thrombosis following the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques [ 186 187 188 166 The involvement of ADAM15 in physiological and pathological angiogenesis has been investigated by Horiuchi et al. in mice with targeted deletion of ADAM15 ( Adam15 −/− 164 Adam15 −/− Adam15 −/− Adam15 −/− In addition to the roles played by ADAM15 in atherosclerosis and pathological angiogenesis, accumulating evidence indicates that ADAM15 might be involved in other inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (reviewed in [ 166 172 189 190 191 166 167 As indicated above, ADAM15 expression is frequently dysregulated in many types of cancer in comparison with the respective normal tissues [ 168 143 169 170 Maretzky et al. reported that a splice variant of ADAM15 (named ADAM15B) that contains an inserted cytoplasmic Src-binding site is associated with unfavorable outcomes in breast cancer [ 192 Src −/− The group of Mark L. Day found that ADAM15 transcript and protein levels were significantly increased in breast and prostate cancer tissue specimens and that expression of this molecule correlated with disease progression and metastasis according to clinical parameters of predictive outcome for both prostate and breast cancers, evidenced by Gleason sum and angioinvasion, respectively [ 168 169 Lorenzatti Hiles et al. found that ADAM15 expression is increased in invasive and metastatic bladder tumors, while low grade and noninvasive bladder cancer showed negative or low expression of ADAM15 [ 193 Toquet et al. analyzed the expression of ADAM15 as well as promoter methylation and microsatellite instability status in samples of 94 colorectal carcinomas, categorized according to the World Health Organization classification. These authors found a reduced expression of ADAM15 (both at protein and mRNA levels) without promoter methylation in 36% of colorectal carcinomas, which was associated with histologically poorly differentiated carcinomas [ 170 L1CAM Protein structure L1CAM (CD171) is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily (Ig-SF) with a molecular wight of 200–220 kDa. L1CAM encompasses six Ig-like domains and five fibronectin type III repeats, followed by a single transmembrane region and a highly conserved intracytoplasmic tail (Fig. 7 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 Fig. 7 Schematic representation of the L1CAM protein, embedded in the cell membrane ( A B C In the sixth Ig-domain, there are RGD-sites (Fig. 7 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 207 210 212 210 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 Tissue distribution and functional activities L1CAM is predominantly expressed in neural tissue, but low levels of expression are present in certain epithelial and endothelial cells as well as in leukocytes [ 220 221 222 Different mutations in the L1CAM gene leading to malfunction of the protein have been observed in certain human neurodevelopmental disorders such as X-linked hydrocephalus, spastic paraplegia, and mental retardation [ 222 223 L1CAM is also highly relevant in tumor progression. This molecule is highly expressed in a variety of human cancers, including colorectal, pancreatic, endometrial, and ovarian carcinomas, as well as neuroblastomas and melanomas [ 224 226 224 225 227 Role in RGD-dependent cell adhesion When immobilized as a substrate, L1CAM supports cell adhesion and migration similar to ECM components, and this process can be blocked in the presence of antibodies to integrins [ 207 228 228 207 229 230 231 211 230 Pathophysiological involvement and implications The knockdown of L1CAM in mice recapitulated its importance for neuronal development, as the brain defects of these mice were similar to humans with mutations in the L1CAM gene [ 232 233 233 234 234 235 General discussion and concluding remarks Integrin binding typically occurs through recognition of specific short peptide motifs containing an acidic residue (D or E) in the ligands. The two best characterized sequences recognized by numerous integrins on their ligands are the motifs RGD and LDV. However, many other motifs (including KGD, RTD, KQAGDV, DGEA, YGYYGDALR, FYFDLR, and GFOGER) have been identified in diverse integrin ligands as responsible for specific integrin recognition and binding [ 14 19 27 22 According to the UniProt protein database, there are 2352 human proteins that contain at least one RGD motif (7.22% of all human proteins), of which 367 are membrane proteins. We have selected six transmembrane RGD-containing proteins (endoglin, cadherin-5, −6, and −17, ADAM15, and L1CAM) out of those 367, because they are expressed on the cell surface membrane and are well-established counter-receptors for at least one member of the RGD-receptor group of integrins (Fig. 1 RGD-containing ECM proteins like fibronectin are widely regarded as the canonical ligands of the subset of RGD integrin receptors, which mediate cell–ECM interactions. Conversely, the RGD-ICRs act as cell surface counter-receptors of RGD integrins mediating cell–cell interactions, thus further enriching the complex key role of the integrin family in cell adhesion (Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Cell adhesion mediated by RGD integrin receptors. Left, integrins interact with canonical RGD-containing proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to regulate cell adhesion to ECM. Representative components of ECM (fibronectin, fibrinogen, collagen, laminin, proteoglycan, and elastin) are indicated. Right, integrins interact with the noncanonical RGD-containing integrin counter-receptors (RGD-ICRs) to regulate cell–cell adhesion.

A B http://smart.servier.com/ https://www.biorender.com Despite the observed structural differences among the RGD-containing domains, several specific integrins seem to be engaged by different counter-receptors. This is the case of integrin αIIbβ3, whose activation has important implications in platelet function, impinging in crucial physiological and pathological processes. αIIbβ3 is a crucial platelet receptor that is normally in a resting/inactive state in unstimulated platelets. However, signal transduction in platelets (which can be triggered through a number of different platelet surface receptors) induces rapid conformational changes and the activation of integrin αIIbβ3 through the “inside-out” activation mechanism [ 236 236 237 36 83 37 108 238 118 239 37 188 166 201 103 118 Another interesting feature shared by several members of the selected transmembrane RGD-containing proteins (endoglin, CDH17, CDH6, ADAM15, and L1CAM) is their involvement in different aspects of cancer, including tumor growth, tumor malignancy, tumor vascularization, metastasis, and cancer progression and prognosis. This finding adds novel therapeutic opportunities to the field of RGD motif in the targeting of cancer and other conditions [ 240 241 241 240 102 103 114 242 243 ® 93 97 Interestingly, the extracellular portion (ectodomain) of the majority of the RGD-counter-receptors discussed in this review can be released from the cell surface by the action of specific proteases, a process known as ectodomain shedding. The shedding of endoglin, CDH5, CDH17, and L1CAM has been reported in literature, and the proteases responsible include thrombin, MMP14, and MMP12 for the shedding of endoglin; ADAM10 for the shedding of CDH5; and ADAM10 and ADAM17 for the shedding of L1CAM. A similar shedding has been also observed for CDH17, although in this case, the proteases involved have not been characterized yet. Therefore, these RGD-containing integrin counter-receptors can be detected at least in two forms: a cell-surface transmembrane form and a circulating soluble form. Through either additional integrin activation or competition with the cell-associated transmembrane forms, the soluble forms of these molecules can potentially add an additional layer of regulation to crucial functions mediated by integrin receptors and their RGD-containing counter-receptors, such as cell–cell and cell–ECM adhesion phenomena, migration, invasion, and proliferation. Biochemically, the protease-mediated shedding of the RGD-containing counter-receptors endoglin, CDH5, CDH17, and L1CAM and their release in soluble forms is an irreversible process and indicates that the balance between their respective transmembrane and soluble forms may play crucial roles related to their specific involvement in certain physiological and pathological conditions. Accordingly, their proteolytic processing must be subjected to exquisitely regulated mechanisms. Importantly, a correlation has been found between the soluble levels of some of these molecules and certain pathological conditions. For instance, soluble endoglin has been found to contribute to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia [ 88 89 244 245 247 248 249 38 93 97 In summary, RGD-containing counter-receptors have emerged as a new family of promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets, with clinical potential in a wide array of different pathologies. Cross-investigations between these molecules should definitively be carried out for further clarification. Supplementary Information  Additional file 1.
