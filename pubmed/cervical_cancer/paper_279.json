The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is essential for maintaining physiological homeostasis. Autonomic nervous system imbalance, characterised by sympathetic hyperactivation and low parasympathetic tone, can occur during the perioperative period. These changes drive systemic stress responses, cardiovascular instability, impaired tissue repair, and immunosuppression, which in turn increase infection risk, neurocognitive decline, and multiorgan dysfunction. Surgical trauma, anaesthesia, pain, hypothermia, and psychological stressors all contribute to this dysregulation, and consequently low parasympathetic tone results in the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway being less effective. High sympathetic nervous system activity promotes catecholamine surges and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. Pharmacological interventions, including dexmedetomidine and β-blockers, together with nonpharmacological strategies, such as electroacupuncture and temperature management, are measures that have potential to restore ANS balance. This systematic review covers ANS-mediated organ regulation, pathophysiological consequences of perioperative dysautonomia, and evidence-based therapeutic strategies. By integrating findings from multiple basic and clinical studies, the pivotal roles of ANS modulation in mitigating postoperative complications, including neurocognitive disorders, immunosuppression, and cancer recurrence, are discussed. Maintaining balance of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems is an important prospect in perioperative medicine that could benefit surgical patients’ short- or long-term recovery.

Optimising personalised interventions to treat ANS imbalance could enhance surgical outcomes and warrants further study. The autonomic nervous system (ANS), with the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PSNS) nervous systems, orchestrates cardiorespiratory stability, immune response, and metabolic processes via complex neuroanatomical and neurochemical interactions. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 A characteristic feature of perioperative ANS dysfunction is a significant reduction of parasympathetic tone, which disturbs homeostasis and triggers a cascade of adverse outcomes. This imbalance exacerbates systemic stress responses and impairs tissue repair, thereby increasing susceptibility to postoperative neurocognitive disorders (PND), infection, cancer reoccurrence, or even multiorgan dysfunction. 9 10 11 We conducted a literature search strategy in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (Supplementary material and Supplementary Fig. 1 Autonomic nervous system and homeostasis The ANS is the primary neural basis for maintaining the physiological balance of organ systems, dynamically balancing SNS and PSNS output to adapt to internal and external stressors. This dual innervation is achieved through precise neuroanatomical circuits, neurotransmitters, cellular signals, and receptors, ensuring the coordination and stability of cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, and respiratory functions ( Fig. 1 Fig 1 Autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates specific molecules, pathways, and effects produced in various organs. BAT, brown adipose tissue; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; JAK, Janus kinase; PSNS, parasympathetic nervous system; PVN, paraventricular nucleus; SNS, sympathetic nervous system; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription. Created with elements from https://BioRender.com Fig 1 Cardiovascular system The ANS achieves precise cardiovascular regulation through antagonism between the SNS and the PSNS. Functionally, SNS activation enhances cardiac function through β1-mediated increases of heart rate (chronotropy), contractility (inotropy), and atrioventricular conduction velocity (dromotropy) while shortening ventricular action potential duration. 12 13 Energy metabolism system Energy balance, or energy homeostasis, involves the CNS receiving and integrating peripheral energy signals. The ANS governs energy homeostasis through bidirectional communication between hypothalamic nuclei and peripheral metabolic organs, including the pancreas, adipose tissue, and liver. Pancreatic secretion The ANS regulates islet cells through neurotransmitters and hormones, which respond to changes in blood glucose to maintain its concentration within the normal range. 14 15 Fat storage and thermogenesis The ANS can affect energy balance and thermogenesis by regulating adipose tissue metabolism. Postganglionic sympathetic fibres release norepinephrine to bind β3-adrenergic receptors on brown adipose tissue adipocytes, initiating a cAMP-PKA signalling cascade that activates uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) to generate heat. 16 17 Hepatic glucose utilisation and glycogen synthesis The ANS can control liver metabolism through neural pathways and promote overall energy balance. A previous study reported that the glucose-lowering effects induced by insulin administration to the brain via the carotid artery persisted even after removal of the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract, suggesting the existence of a separate ‘brain–liver’ neural axis. 18 19 Immune system The SNS modulates immune responses via norepinephrine release, which binds β2-adrenergic receptors on macrophages and glial cells to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], interleukin-6 [IL-6]) by inhibiting nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling 20 21 22 , 23 24 25 26 , 27 Respiratory system The regulation of the respiratory system by the ANS is achieved through the integration of sensory input and motor output within the brainstem. Hypoxia and hypercapnia trigger SNS responses that increase respiratory rate and depth, optimising gas exchange. 28 29 30 31 Perioperative pathophysiology and risk factors for autonomic nervous system imbalance The ANS balance can be disrupted through multifactorial mechanisms including surgical trauma, haemodynamic instability, nociceptive signalling, thermoregulatory challenges, and psychological stress acting as the key drivers of sympathetic hyperactivation and parasympathetic suppression during the perioperative period. These perturbations create a maladaptive neuroendocrine milieu that exacerbates systemic inflammation, compromises organ perfusion, and increases susceptibility to postoperative complication occurrence. Surgery, surgical trauma, and stress Surgical trauma initiates a dual-axis neuroendocrine stress response through activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal and sympathetic–adrenal–medullary axes. 2 32 33 34 3 , 35 Low blood volume Low blood volume owing to haemorrhage can trigger a significant sympathetic response to maintain perfusion pressure, leading to tachycardia and vasoconstriction. Excessive fluid administration can lead to parasympathetic activation to counteract volume overload, causing bradycardia and hypotension. 36 6 Pain Pain leads to SNS overactivation while suppressing PSNS activity, causing dysregulation of the ANS. The ongoing dysfunction of the ANS results in chronic pain syndromes. 37 8 Intraoperative hypothermia Intraoperative hypothermia, defined as a core temperature below 36°C, is common and can impact the ANS, leading to various physiological disturbances. 5 38 39 Fear, depression, and anxiety Preoperative fear, depression, and anxiety are common psychological states in the perioperative period, and these emotional factors may lead to ANS dysfunction. 40 7 41 Perioperative autonomic nervous system function assessment There is no ‘gold standard’ to monitor ANS function, but several complementary indictors can be detected simultaneously in clinical settings. These include HRV, pupillometry, blood biomarkers, skin conductance level, and other indicators ( Fig. 2 Fig 2 Perioperative assessment methods, indicators, and clinical significance of autonomic nerves system (ANS) activity. These indicators respond and ANS function to varying degrees. ACh, acetylcholine; AChE, acetylcholinesterase; BChE, butyrylcholinesterase; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CRP, C-reactive protein; EDA, electrodermal activity; GSR, galvanic skin response; HF, high-frequency spectrums; LF, low frequency; NPY, neuropeptide Y; pNN50, the percentage of successive normal sinus RR intervals >50 ms; PPG, photoplethysmography; PSNS, parasympathetic nervous system; RMSSD, the root mean square of the successive normal sinus RR interval difference; SDANN, the standard deviation of the averaged normal sinus RR intervals for all 5-min segments; SDNN, the standard deviation of all normal sinus RR intervals during 24 h; SNS, sympathetic nervous system; SP, skin potential; SS, skin susceptance; TP, total power; ULF, ultra-low frequency; VLF, very low frequency. Created with elements from https://BioRender.com Fig 2 Heart rate variability Real-time fluctuations in heartbeat intervals are reflected by HRV and are regulated by the ANS through its influence on the sinoatrial node. 42 43 44 Fig. 2 45 46 47 Pupillometry Pupillary response can reflect the neurophysiological state of the patient and is a vital tool for assessing the balance of the ANS activity. Based on the pupil light response, delayed pupil constriction in light suggests PSNS dysfunction, whereas delayed pupil dilation in dark indicates SNS dysfunction. 48 49 Biomarkers of parasympathetic function Acetylcholine As a primary neurotransmitter of the PSNS, ACh modulates cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive functions. 50 51 52 Cholinesterase activity The activity of cholinesterase, including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), is another critical indicator of vagal function. Perioperative decreases in cholinesterase activity have been linked to prolonged neuromuscular block and increased susceptibility to infections as a result of impaired immune function. 53 54 Biomarkers of sympathetic function Norepinephrine and epinephrine Elevated concentrations of these catecholamines are associated with increased perioperative morbidity, including hypertension, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischaemia. 55 in vivo 56 Cortisol Perioperative cortisol concentrations increase as part of the stress response, with elevated concentrations correlating with increased surgical stress and postoperative complications such as impaired wound healing and infections. 57 52 , 58 Neuropeptide Y Elevated perioperative concentrations of neuropeptide Y (NPY), a co-transmitter released with norepinephrine from sympathetic neurones that modulates vasoconstriction and stress responses, reflect heightened sympathetic activity and are associated with adverse cardiovascular events. 59 52 Other biomarkers Inflammatory cytokines Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α are critical mediators of the inflammatory response. Elevated concentrations of these cytokines perioperatively indicate a heightened sympathetic response and are predictive of complications such as sepsis and prolonged hospital stays. 60 52 C-reactive protein As a well-established biomarker of systemic inflammation and autonomic dysregulation, C-reactive protein (CRP) exhibits perioperative clinical significance through its association with surgical stress and postoperative complications such as infections and cardiovascular events. 61 52 Brain-derived neurotrophic factor As a neurotrophic factor that is critical for neuronal growth and plasticity, BDNF has its secretion controlled by the ANS. 62 63 Other alternative measurement Electrodermal activity The main components of electrodermal activity (EDA) include galvanic skin response, skin potential, and skin susceptance, and their values are primarily determined by the activity of eccrine sweat glands, which are regulated by the SNS. 64 65 66 Photoplethysmography By detecting changes in skin blood flow, photoplethysmography (PPG) serves as a noninvasive technique for assessing cardiovascular activity and ANS function, which enables real-time monitoring of heart rate, oxygen saturation, and pulse wave transit time to assist in anaesthesia dose adjustment and haemodynamic management during surgery. 67 Harmful postoperative autonomic nervous system activity imbalance Perioperative ANS dysfunction can lead to neurocognitive disorders and immunosuppression, increase infection risk, promote cancer recurrence and metastasis, and can even develop into multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The mechanism involves uncontrolled inflammation, immunosuppression, tumour microenvironment remodelling, and organ blood flow/metabolic disorders, further highlighting the key effect of perioperative ANS regulation on patient prognosis ( Fig. 3 Fig 3 An imbalance in autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity after surgery can hinder recovery and increase the risk of neurocognitive disorders, infections, and other complications. AKI, acute kidney injury; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; PSNS, parasympathetic nervous system; SIRS, systemic inflammatory response syndrome; SNS, sympathetic nervous system. Created with elements from https://BioRender.com Fig 3 Postoperative neurocognitive disorders Epidemiological studies showed that PND occur in up to 65% of older surgical patients, and the incidence is higher in the older patients after major surgery. 68 11 9 The inflammatory response after surgery is a well-established factor contributing to PND. 69 70 71 72 73 Immunosuppression and susceptibility to infection Surgical trauma is a significant stressor that activates a complex immune response. This immune response can lead to perioperative immunosuppression or an increased risk of postoperative infection, affecting up to 30% of older surgical patients. 74 The SNS plays a crucial role in coping with traumatic events such as surgery. The continuous activation of SNS may also weaken the autoimmune response, thereby reducing the body's defence ability against infection. For example, an experimental study demonstrated that the stimulation of SNS in animals can suppress the phagocytic function of immune cells, such as macrophages. 75 76 77 Cancer recurrence Surgery is a frontline treatment for a variety of cancers and can lead to an imbalance in the ANS function, increasing the risk of cancer recurrence and metastasis. 10 78 , 79 79 80 81 , 82 Previous studies showed that the use of β-blockers can prolong progression-free survival in patients with different types of cancer, 83 84 85 Perioperative organ dysfunction Perioperative imbalance of ANS activity may be one of the objective causes of perioperative multiple organ failure, which may have adverse effects on the function of essential organs such as the heart, lung, immune system, and digestive system and eventually lead to the occurrence of MODS. Cardiovascular dysfunction Surgery and anaesthesia can trigger a sympathetic surge, leading to increased catecholamine release, which may result in hypertension, tachycardia, and increased myocardial oxygen demand causing myocardial ischaemia, particularly in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease, leading to perioperative myocardial infarction. 86 87 Respiratory dysfunction A reduction in parasympathetic tone, often seen with the use of anaesthetics such as propofol and neuromuscular blockers, can lead to bronchoconstriction and impaired gas exchange, further increasing the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. 88 89 Renal and liver dysfunction Kidneys are highly sensitive to changes in blood flow and oxygenation, both of which are influenced by the ANS. Perioperative sympathetic overactivity can lead to renal vasoconstriction, reduced renal blood flow, and decreased glomerular filtration rate, all of which contribute to the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). 90 91 Gut injury The gastrointestinal tract is highly sensitive to changes in autonomic tone, particularly sympathetic overactivity, which can lead to splanchnic vasoconstriction and reduced mesenteric blood flow. This can cause intestinal ischaemia and reperfusion injury, compromising the integrity of the gut barrier and increasing the risk of bacterial translocation and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. 92 93 Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome Uncontrolled sympathetic activity during the perioperative period may drive cytokine release through multiple mechanisms, leading to MODS. 94 95 Perioperative autonomic nervous system rebalance Restoring balance of the ANS activity is imperative to enhance postoperative recovery and mitigate complications. Pharmacological interventions, including dexmedetomidine and β-blockers, alongside physical modalities such as electroacupuncture and temperature management, have been shown to effectively regulate the activity of both SNS and PSNS. These interventions attenuate the stress response, diminish the likelihood of cardiovascular complications, improve postoperative cognitive function, and enhance immune response ( Fig. 4 Fig 4 Treatment measures and related mechanisms of perioperative autonomic nervous system (ANS) tone rebalance. PND, postoperative neurocognitive disorders; PSNS, parasympathetic nervous system; SNS, sympathetic nervous system. Created with elements from https://BioRender.com Fig 4 Drug intervention Dexmedetomidine It is a selective α2-adrenergic receptor agonist with unique properties, providing sedation, analgesia, anxiolysis, anti-inflammatory effects, and cardiovascular stabilisation. 96 Excessive sympathetic activity during surgery can lead to tachycardia, hypertension, and myocardial ischaemia, particularly in high-risk cardiovascular patients. In cardiac surgery, dexmedetomidine stabilises haemodynamic and lowers myocardial injury markers, improving cardiac function and reducing postoperative complications such as atrial fibrillation. 97 , 98 Dexmedetomidine can reduce inflammatory response, reduce pulmonary microvascular hyperpermeability, improve pulmonary function, and prevent complications by activating α2-adrenergic receptors. 99 100 101 Dexmedetomidine protects the liver by attenuating ischaemia–reperfusion injury during hepatectomy, reducing inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress to preserve liver function and promoting better postoperative outcomes. 102 , 103 104 In terms of renal protection, dexmedetomidine reduces postoperative AKI by activating α 2 105 2 106 107 Dexmedetomidine significantly reduces postoperative delirium and neurocognitive dysfunction. 108 109 108 , 110 , 111 112 113 The clinical translation of the organ-protective effects of dexmedetomidine remains controversial. The DECADE trial, the largest RCT to date, paradoxically showed increased delirium risk. 114 115 β-blockers β-blockers (β-adrenergic antagonists) are pivotal in perioperative cardiovascular management, reducing catecholamine-induced stress and stabilising haemodynamic, and improved surgical outcome, particularly in high-risk patients. 116 117 Perioperative β-blockers use lowered the incidence of myocardial infarction, particularly in high-risk patients undergoing noncardiac surgeries. 118 119 120 121 122 Although β-blockers reduce catecholamine-induced stress and stabilise haemodynamic through ANS modulation, their net clinical benefits require careful risk stratification. Perioperative β-blockers use demonstrates a dual effect profile. The landmark is that patients undergoing noncardiac surgery (POISE) trial revealed a concerning trade-off: although myocardial infarction was reduced with β-blockers, both overall mortality and stroke risk were increased. 123 de novo 124 Nonpharmacological interventions Electroacupuncture Perioperative electroacupuncture may rebalance ANS activity, improving patient outcomes by modulating pain perception through CNS and PSNS, promoting endogenous opioid and neuropeptide release. 125 126 127 128 Temperature management Hypothermia, which is common during surgery, can severely impact the ANS by increasing sympathetic outflow and reducing parasympathetic activity, leading to increased blood loss, increased wound infection, and other poor prognosis. 129 130 Exercise Preoperative aerobic exercise enhances parasympathetic resilience, as measured by increased HRV and baroreflex sensitivity, thereby reducing postoperative atrial fibrillation and improving recovery outcomes. Previous studies demonstrated that tailored exercise programmes benefit patients with heart failure, 131 132 Conclusions This review uniquely synthesises multidisciplinary evidence from anaesthesia, neuroscience, and immunology to mechanistically link surgical stressors and ANS-mediated pathophysiology. By integrating advanced assessment tools, we provide actionable insights for real-time monitoring of ANS dynamics, surpassing prior reviews focused on isolated biomarkers. Additionally, we dissect the effects of pharmacological interventions and nonpharmacological strategies, emphasising their potential to restore ANS equilibrium while addressing gaps in clinical translation. Therefore, targeted rebalancing of ANS tone is not merely a theoretical concept but a pragmatic pathway to preserve organ function and enhance patient recovery.
