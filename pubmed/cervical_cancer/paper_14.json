Summary Background It is challenging to secure the tertiary structure of virus-like particles (VLPs) during manufacturing process development. In this study, we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of PV-001, a 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine candidate manufactured in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Methods The 9-valent vaccine formulation contained L1 VLPs for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. A double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted in which participants were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the investigation vaccine or a placebo consisting solely of aluminum phosphate (AP) gel, used as an adjuvant. A total of 41 healthy women aged 19–45 years were enrolled in South Korea and administered the assigned intervention via intramuscular injection at 0, 2, and 6 months. Safety assessments included immediate adverse events (AEs), solicited local and systemic AEs, and unsolicited AEs. Immunogenicity was evaluated by measuring serum anti-HPV L1 VLP IgG and neutralizing antibody titers pre- and post-vaccination (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT07081334 Findings No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported following administration of PV-001, and the overall safety profile was consistent with expected findings, supporting the favorable clinical safety of PV-001. Robust increases in both anti-HPV L1 VLP IgG and neutralizing antibody titers were observed for all nine HPV types following the second and third vaccine doses, relative to baseline. Interpretation PV-001 was well tolerated and elicited strong immunogenic responses, supporting its potential for further clinical development and the evaluation of broader target populations and age groups.

The search terms were set as “human papillomavirus” or ‘HPV’ and “vaccine.” We focused our search on data regarding the safety and immunogenicity of newly approved HPV vaccine candidates. Additionally, we considered and explored issues in the manufacturing process of existing virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines and directions for improvement. Currently, 2-valent, 4-valent, and 9-valent HPV vaccines are available worldwide, with the 9-valent HPV vaccine offering significantly broader protective immunity compared to the existing 2-valent and 4-valent vaccines. However, the supply price of the 9-valent HPV vaccine is much higher than that of the 2-valent and 4-valent vaccines. This pricing policy is a major factor limiting supply to low middle income countries (LMICs). Strategies to improve the production efficiency of the 9-valent HPV vaccine and reduce its price are important considerations for its universal use. Added value of this study We devised a method to further improve the accuracy of VLP assembly by applying a heating-cooling method, and this new method can also improve the production efficiency of HPV VLP antigens. Ultimately, HPV VLP-based vaccines produced using this method can contribute to lowering the supply price of 9-valent HPV vaccines and to the supply of highly immunogenic vaccines. In addition, these technical improvements in HPV vaccines will contribute to the widespread use of high-quality HPV vaccines. Ultimately, the new method is expected to have a derivative effect on reducing cancer incidence rates through increased availability of 9-valent HPV vaccines. Implications of all the available evidence The WHO is pursuing the expansion of HPV vaccination worldwide as one of its key strategies for the elimination of cervical cancer. Expanding the use of 9-valent HPV vaccines will have the greatest impact on the elimination of cervical cancer. However, the current types of 9-valent HPV vaccines available are very limited, and these limitations hinder the global uptake of 9-valent HPV vaccines. The 9-valent HPV vaccines produced using the new method we propose will ultimately contribute to the diversification and increased availability of 9-valent HPV vaccines. Introduction Human papillomavirus (HPV) is implicated in nearly all cases of cervical cancer and is also a major etiological agent in penile, vulvar, vaginal, and head and neck cancers. 1 , 2 3 3 2 4 Currently, Gardasil 9 is the only commercially available 9-valent HPV vaccine that incorporates these nine antigens. Long-term follow-up data from a cohort of males and females aged 9–15 years, who received a three-dose series, demonstrated sustained efficacy over a 10-year period. 5 Currently available HPV vaccines include 2-valent, 4-valent, and 9-valent formulations, all of which employ virus-like particles (VLPs) as antigenic components. 6 7 8 8 8 9 ClinicalTrials.gov NCT07081334 Methods Preparation of 9-valent HPV vaccine or placebo Nine HPV L1 antigens were individually expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae S. cerevisiae 9 Study design This Phase 1 clinical trial was conducted between August 2022 and April 2024 at a single center (Gangnam Severance Hospital in Seoul, South Korea) as a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study involving healthy Korean women aged 19–45 years. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gangnam Severance Hospital (IRB approval number: 3-2022-0194). All trial procedures, including conduct, data collection, documentation, and regulatory submissions, were performed in accordance with Korean Good Clinical Practice (KGCP) guidelines and the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E6 (R2) Good Clinical Practice standards. The study was also conducted in full compliance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki, with particular emphasis on the safety and welfare of participants. The primary endpoint of this trial was to assess the safety of the PV-001 vaccine, while the secondary endpoint involved an exploratory evaluation of its immunogenicity. Participants This clinical trial enrolled individuals without evidence of HPV infection. Eligible participants were women who could undergo cervical cell sampling and testing and who had been using contraception for at least 48 h prior to screening and agreed to maintain effective contraception throughout the study period. All participants were provided with comprehensive information about the trial and gave written informed consent prior to enrollment. Key exclusion criteria included: abnormal findings on prior Pap smears or colposcopic examinations; a history of HPV infection; positive results for any of the nine HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, or 58) in cervical cytology; and prior HPV vaccination. Additional exclusions were applied to individuals with acute febrile illness within 24 h before the first vaccine dose; those testing positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or with suspected infection; individuals with known immunodeficiency; and those with a history of neurological disorders, including encephalomyelitis or Guillain-Barré syndrome. The Safety Set included all participants who were randomized and received at least one dose of the investigational product. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of participants who received at least one dose of the investigational product, had baseline immunogenicity data, and had at least one post-vaccination immunogenicity assessment. The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) was a subset of the FAS comprising participants who completed the trial without any major protocol deviations ( Fig. 1 Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 Fig. 1 Trial profile of the Phase 1 clinical study. Participants were categorized into the Safety Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), and Per-Protocol Set (PPS). The number of enrolled and excluded subjects for each analysis set is indicated. Safety assessments were conducted using the Safety Set, and immunogenicity analyses were based on the PPS. Randomisation and masking Women aged 19–26 and women aged 27–45 were used as stratification factors, and a block random assignment method was applied. To maintain the integrity of the double-blind study design, the investigational product and placebo were formulated to be visually indistinguishable. Randomization codes corresponding to each treatment group were generated and securely maintained by the principal investigator in sealed form and were not disclosed until the completion of the trial and final data analysis. Group assignments remained blinded to both participants and investigators throughout the study period. Code disclosure was strictly prohibited until database lock and unblinding procedures were completed, thereby ensuring allocation concealment and preventing bias in treatment administration and outcome assessment.

Contraceptive compliance and education were reinforced throughout the study period to ensure adherence to eligibility criteria. Immunogenicity assessments Serum samples were collected at three time points to evaluate immunogenicity: prior to the first vaccination (baseline), four months after the second dose, and 28 days following the third dose. Immunogenicity was assessed using two complementary assays: (1) measurement of anti-HPV L1 VLP IgG titers via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and (2) quantification of neutralizing antibody titers using a pseudovirus (PsV)-based assay. ELISA was performed in accordance with previously published protocols, 10 , 11 12 For ELISA, 96-well microplates were coated with L1 VLPs corresponding to HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, and subsequently blocked with 5% skim milk. Serial dilutions of serum samples were added, and unbound antibodies were removed through washing. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG. Antibody titers were defined as the highest serum dilution yielding an absorbance equal to or greater than the mean absorbance of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control wells. For PsV-based neutralization assays, serum samples were serially diluted and incubated with PsVs corresponding to the nine HPV types listed above. The serum–PsV mixtures were then added to 96-well plates seeded with monolayers of 293 TT cells and incubated for 72 h. Neutralizing activity was quantified by measuring the expression of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), which reflects PsV entry into cells. Neutralizing antibody titers were defined as the highest serum dilution capable of inhibiting ≥50% of the SEAP signal relative to control wells containing PsV only. Outcomes The primary outcome measures included the assessment of safety through: 1) immediate AEs occurring within 30 min post-vaccination 2) solicited local and systemic AEs observed within 7 days of each dose 3) unsolicited AEs reported within 28 days following each vaccination 4) unsolicited AEs occurring from the first dose through 180 days after the third dose: clinical laboratory tests (hematological/serum biochemistry tests, urinalysis), vital signs, and physical examinations were performed. 5) SAEs monitored up to 180 days following the final dose. The secondary outcome measures were exploratory assessments of immunogenicity. These included quantification of antibody responses to HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, as determined by: 1) anti-HPV L1 VLP IgG titers measured using an ELISA-based assay 2) neutralizing antibody titers measured using a pseudovirus (PsV)-based assay. Both assays were conducted at predefined time points before and after vaccination to evaluate the magnitude and kinetics of the immune response. Statistical analysis The objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the PV-001 9-valent HPV vaccine in healthy adult women aged 19–45 years. Safety analyses were performed on the Safety Set, which included all randomized participants who received at least one dose of the investigational product ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 The FAS included participants who received at least one dose of the investigational product, had pre-vaccination immunogenicity data, and had post-vaccination data available for at least one immunogenicity endpoint. The PPS comprised FAS participants who completed the study without any major protocol deviations, in accordance with the trial protocol. The statistical significance in this clinical trial was tested at a significance level of 5% using a two-sided test. For continuous data, descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum values) are presented, and for categorical data, frequencies and percentages are presented, and when necessary, 95% two-sided confidence intervals are presented. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for adverse event (AE) outcomes was calculated using the Clopper–Pearson method, whereas the 95% CI for immunogenicity analysis was estimated using the t-distribution. All statistical values are presented to two decimal places. P-values are presented to four decimal places (values <0.0001 are denoted as <0.0001), and the frequency is presented as an integer. When missing values occurred in safety and exploratory immunogenicity data, the raw data were analyzed as is without imputation. Immunogenicity outcomes were summarized as geometric mean titers (GMTs) and geometric mean ratios (GMRs) for both ELISA-derived anti-HPV L1 VLP IgG titers and PsV-based neutralizing antibody titers. GMTs were calculated at baseline, after the second dose, and after the third dose. GMRs were derived as the fold increase in antibody titers post-dose 2 and post-dose 3 relative to baseline titers. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. Role of the funding source This clinical trial was funded by the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI). The funding agency had no involvement in the study design, protocol development, data collection, analysis, or interpretation; in the writing of the manuscript; or in the decision to submit the article for publication. Results Characteristics of study participants This single-center, double-blind clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and exploratory immunogenicity of the PV-001 9-valent HPV vaccine in healthy adult women aged 19–45 years. Participant data were categorized into the Safety Set, FAS and PPS. Demographic characteristics and safety analyses were conducted using the Safety Set, while the primary immunogenicity analysis was performed using the PPS, with additional analyses using the FAS. The classification process for each analysis set is illustrated in Fig. 1 The minimum sample size for the clinical trial was set at 32, accounting for an anticipated dropout rate of 20%, and was determined with reference to a previously published clinical trial ( NCT03813940 Fig. 1 Table 1 Supplementary Table S2 Safety and tolerability For safety evaluation, clinical laboratory tests were conducted four times: once each at the screening visit, before the second dose, before the third dose, and at the final visit. Clinical laboratory tests included hematological parameters, serum biochemistry parameters, and urine test parameters. No significant changes in these parameters were observed following administration of the investigational product compared to baseline. Safety and tolerability analyses were conducted on all participants who received at least one dose of the investigational product ( Fig. 1 Table 2 Solicited local AEs within 7 days of vaccination were reported in 85.71% of PV-001 recipients and 85.00% of placebo recipients ( Table 2 Table 2 Table 3 Table 2 Fig. 2 Table 3 Solicited local and systemic adverse events reported within 7 days (Day 0–6) following administration of the investigational drug.

Details are presented in Table 5 Fig. 4 Geometric mean titers (GMTs) of HPV neutralizing antibodies as measured by pseudovirus (PsV)-based assay. Details are presented in Table 6 Fig. 3 Overall, the rise in neutralizing antibody titers was substantially greater than that observed in ELISA-derived IgG titers, indicating a robust functional immune response induced by the PV-001 vaccine. Discussion This Phase 1 clinical study aimed to evaluate the safety and exploratory immunogenicity of PV-001, a 9-valent HPV vaccine composed of L1 antigens for nine HPV types, expressed in S. cerevisiae 13 14 15 To enhance antigen purity, we implemented a novel approach involving heating and chilling steps in the presence of reducing agents such as β-mercaptoethanol. This strategy effectively facilitated the removal of host-derived proteins from S. cerevisiae 9 HPV L1 proteins naturally form VLPs through disulfide bond-mediated assembly. 16 11 17 In contrast, our approach employed disassembly of L1 using reducing agents immediately after cell lysis, followed by a heating–chilling purification method. 9 As global demand for HPV vaccines continues to rise, reliance on a single product—MSD's 9-valent vaccine—has led to challenges such as supply instability and limited accessibility due to high costs. These issues are particularly pronounced in low-income countries, where vaccine procurement is complex and immunization programs are often delayed. In this context, the development of alternative 9-valent vaccines based on novel manufacturing technologies holds significant value for diversifying supply and improving public health outcomes. PV-001, developed in this study, addresses the limitations of yeast-based production through an improved purification process that ensures high antigen purity and consistent quality. The favorable safety and immunogenicity results demonstrated in this Phase 1 trial support its potential as a promising alternative to the existing MSD vaccine. The PV-001 vaccine manufactured using this method demonstrated favorable tolerability and strong immunogenicity in this Phase 1 trial. Notably, the increase in neutralizing antibody titers post-vaccination exceeded the rise in anti-HPV L1 IgG titers measured by ELISA ( Tables 5 6 18 19 , 20 In this exploratory analysis, we also examined the correlation between ELISA-derived IgG titers and PsV-based neutralizing antibody titers. A strong positive correlation was observed ( Supplementary Material 21 , 22 In this study, the end-point titration method was applied in ELISA to measure anti-HPV L1 IgG titers. End-point titration is a traditional measurement method that allows the titer of antibodies to be measured in the absence of standard antibodies or standard anti-serum. Currently, standard sera provided by NIBSC for nine types of HPV are available. In future studies, it is expected that anti-HPV L1 IgG measurements using the NIBSC standard sera will enable the calculation of international units. The international unit is expected to be a good indicator for comparing anti-HPV L1 IgG levels between subsequent clinical trials. In this clinical trial, the vaccine was administered to participants who were HPV DNA-negative. However, the selection of HPV DNA-negative participants does not guarantee the absence of anti-HPV antibodies. Therefore, it is a consideration that antibody-positive individuals may form higher titers than antibody-negative individuals when vaccinated. We believe that distinguishing between HPV antibody-positive and antibody-negative individuals prior to vaccination is necessary in future clinical trials to evaluate immunogenicity. Future clinical trials will include head-to-head immunogenicity comparisons with existing vaccines and the calculation of antibody seroconversion rates taking into account baseline antibody levels. The limitations of this study include the small sample size and the evaluation of safety and immunogenicity in a limited population. Sample size calculation was not based on statistical power analysis. However, considering a possible dropout rate of 20%, the minimum number of subjects was set at 32, and 41 subjects were finally recruited to meet this requirement ( Fig. 1 The incidence of solicited AEs in PV-001 tended to be higher than that reported for conventional 9-valent HPV vaccines. These differences in the solicited AEs frequency can be attributed to differences in monitoring methods. Meanwhile, the frequency of solicited AEs for PV-001 and PEV-001 was similar ( Table 2 23 , 24 In conclusion, PV-001, a 9-valent HPV vaccine developed using a novel heating–chilling purification method in S. cerevisiae Contributors JH K performed the overall management and supervision of the clinical trial.
