MG primarily reacts with the amino groups of proteins (especially at arginine residues), leading to the formation of a major advanced glycation end product known as MG-derived hydroimidazolone 1 (MG-H1). We previously demonstrated in PC3 human prostate cancer (PCa) cells that the PTEN/PKM2/ERα axis promotes their aggressive phenotype by regulating the Glo1/MG-H1 pathway. In this study, after confirming our earlier findings, we investigated the downstream mechanisms of the PTEN/PKM2/ERα/Glo1/MG-H1 axis in controlling PC3 cell growth, focusing on the role of RAGE, a high-affinity receptor for MG-H1; hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 2 2 PTEN glyoxalase 1 MG-H1 RAGE H 2 2 KRIT1 PC3 prostate cancer University of Perugia—University Research Fund, 2023 This research and the APC were funded by the University of Perugia—University Research Fund, 2023 (“University Research Project”: ISPIRARE) granted to C.A. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) is the main enzyme responsible for detoxifying methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive by-product of glycolysis [ 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 2 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 2 11 12 14 15 16 17 18 19 In men from Western countries, prostate cancer (PCa) represents a frequently diagnosed tumor. Surgical and radiotherapeutic interventions achieve favorable outcomes for many patients, yet a considerable fraction ultimately develop recurrent or disseminated disease with lethal consequences. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a more profound comprehension of the molecular mechanisms that enable localized/locally advanced PCas to become invasive and disseminated [ 20 21 22 The role of Glo1 in PCa has long been known. In fact, Glo1 has been identified as an important contributing factor to the progression of this neoplasia [ 2 11 19 23 11 Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a key tumor suppressor involved in controlling cellular proliferation and survival, mainly by modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [ 24 25 26 24 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 In our previous work we demonstrated that the PTEN/PKM2/ERα signaling axis contributes to the aggressive phenotype of PC3 human PCa cells by modulating the Glo1/MG-H1 pathway. In this study, after confirming these prior observations, we explored the downstream mechanisms by which the PTEN/PKM2/ERα/Glo1/MG-H1 axis regulates PC3 cell proliferation, with particular emphasis on the involvement of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 37 38 39 We found that the PTEN/PKM2/ERα/Glo1 axis promotes PC3 cell proliferation and etoposide-induced apoptosis resistance (survival) through MG-H1/RAGE pathway desensitization leading to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 These results reinforce and broaden the understanding of PTEN signaling in PCa progression, while uncovering previously unrecognized mechanistic pathways mediated by MG-induced glycative stress and involving KRIT1, in the context of this currently incurable stage of the disease. The findings presented herein lay the groundwork for future preclinical in vivo studies aimed at evaluating the observed pathway as a potential therapeutic target to selectively slow or prevent PCa progression. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials The cell culture medium, fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, Laemmli buffer, LY294002 (LY) (50 µM in DMSO, 72 h), MK2206 (MK) (10 µM in DMSO, 48 h), and rapamycin (Rapam) (100 nM in DMSO, 48 h) were obtained from ThermoFisher Scientific (Milan, Italy); Roti-Block was obtained from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany); ICI 182,780 (50 nM in DMSO, 5 h), and etoposide (20 µM in DMSO, 48 h), staurosporine (1 µM in DMSO, 48 h), MG (25 µM, 24 h), and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, 10 mM, 0.5 h) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Milan, Italy). FPS-ZM1 (100 nM, 10 h) was purchased from Merck Spa (Milan, Italy). For reagents dissolved in DMSO, the final concentration of DMSO in the incubation assays was 0.01%. Control samples received an equivalent volume of the DMSO vehicle. 2.2. IHC of Prostate Tissues We used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate adenocarcinoma tissue samples ( n 40 2.3. Cell Cultures Human prostate cancer cell lines DU145 (derived from brain metastasis) and PC3 (derived from bone metastasis) were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and maintained, following the supplier’s instructions, at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 2.4. Cell Lysates Total cellular proteins were extracted by lysing cells in RIPA buffer [ 19 2.5. Western Blot SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were conducted following established protocols [ 19 2.6. Glo1, PTEN, p-AKT, and p-mTOR Evaluation The human Glyoxalase I ELISA Kit (cod. ELH-GLYOX1-1) was used to detect Glo1 protein expression. PTEN, p-AKT, and p-mTOR protein expression was evaluated by both specific ELISA kits and Western blotting. In particular, four independent experiments were performed: three were used for ELISA analyses and the remaining one for Western blotting detection. The ELISA kits were the human PTEN ELISA Kit (cod. ab206979), the human AKT3(pS473) ELISA Kit (cod. ab270887), and the human phospho-mTOR (S2448) ELISA Kit (cod. ab279868), all from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). 2.7. Glo1 Enzymatic Activity Assay Cells were collected and resuspended at 10 7 g 19 2.8. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and qRT-PCR RNA extraction, complementary DNA synthesis, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses were carried out as previously reported [ 11 19 41 2.9. Measurement of H 2 2 Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 42 ® 2.10. siRNA Transfection PCa cells were transiently subjected to transfection using a mixture of ONTARGET plus SMARTpool small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Glo1 or PTEN and ONTARGET plus siCONTROL (siCtr) non-targeting pool as a negative control. These siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon RNA Technologies (Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy), and the transfection process was carried out using DharmaFECT 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon RNA Technologies), in accordance with standard protocols. 2.11. MG-H1 Detection MG-H1 levels were determined using the OxiSelect™ Methylglyoxal Competitive ELISA Kit (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA, USA). 2.12. Ectopic Expression of Glo1 and PTEN Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding Glo1 (pCMV-Glo1) or PTEN (pCMV-PTEN), as well as a control plasmid (pCMV-GFP), using transfection-ready vectors according to the manufacturer’s instructions (OriGene, Tema Ricerca, Bologna, Italy). 2.13. Cell Proliferation Cell proliferation and viability were assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8, Sigma-Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.14. Colony Formation Colony formation was assessed as described by Ge et al. [ 43 2.15. Apoptosis Detection Apoptotic activity was assessed by measuring caspase-3 activation using a human active Caspase-3 ELISA Kit (Invitrogen, Milan, Italy) [ 12 2.16. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 10.4.2 software. Comparisons between the two groups were performed with Student’s t p 3. Results 3.1. Glo1 Is Overexpressed in Aggressive PCa Tissues and Cell Lines Glo1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded sections from 60 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy for either localized (T2) or locally advanced (T3) prostate cancer (PCa). Based on the Gleason score (GS), which reflects tumor aggressiveness, the patients were stratified into low-grade (LG) ( n n n n p n n Figure 1 Figure 1 p p Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 More importantly, intracellular MG-H1 levels ( Figure 2 Figure S1 Figure S2 Figure 2 3.2. Glo 1 Upregulation Is Driven by the PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway PTEN functions as a tumor suppressor by modulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, ultimately influencing different biological responses, including cell growth [ 44 27 28 44 45 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 As expected, the ectopic expression of PTEN in PC3 cells led to a substantial desensitization of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 3.3. Pyruvate Kinase (PK)M2 and Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα) Are Involved in PI3/AKT/mTOR Pathway-Triggered Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1) Upregulation The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway serves as a key positive regulator of the Warburg effect. In this context, the rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (PK) functions as a principal effector of mTOR-mediated signaling [ 46 47 46 46 48 35 49 50 50 51 51 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 3.4. Expression of the Receptor for AGEs (RAGE), Levels of Hydrogen Peroxide (H 2 2 It is known that RAGE is a high-affinity receptor for MG-H1, binding it with nanomolar affinity through its V domain [ 52 2 2 42 39 53 37 38 39 2 2 Figure 6 Figure 1 Figure 1 3.5. The Desensitization of the MG-H1/RAGE/H 2 2 Given the aforementioned results, we hypothesized that in aggressive PC3 cells, desensitization of MG-H1/RAGE signaling could attenuate H 2 2 Figure S3 Figure 7 Figure 7 2 2 Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 Notably, upon MG treatment, inhibition of RAGE with the high-affinity RAGE-specific antagonist FPS-ZM1 [ 11 54 55 2 2 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Finally, upon RAGE blockade, pre-treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a known antioxidant that increases cellular GSH levels [ 56 Figure 9 Figure 9 4. Discussion PCa continues to be the most frequently diagnosed cancer in men and ranks second in cancer-related deaths, with mortality largely driven by metastatic disease. Mortality in this context is predominantly attributed to metastatic progression, emphasizing the pressing need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that drive disease advancement [ 57 In this study, after confirming the role of the Glo1/MG-H1 axis driven by the PTEN/PKM2/ERα pathway in promoting the aggressive phenotype of human PCa cells, we unrevealed a downstream mechanism involving RAGE, H 2 2 2 2 Figure 10 PCa cells are known to rely on multiple compensatory signaling cascades to sustain proliferation and survival. Among these, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR cascade is a key driver of PCa aggressiveness and is tightly regulated by the tumor suppressor PTEN. PTEN is among the most commonly inactivated or mutated tumor suppressor genes in human cancers [ 58 59 46 47 60 46 61 62 49 50 63 64 65 65 66 67 68 We previously demonstrated that ERα positively regulates the expression of glyoxalase 1 (Glo1). In this study, we confirmed that the upregulation of Glo1 is mediated by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade through the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p-PKM2(Y105)/ERα axis. This pathway likely contributes to cancer cell survival during the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p-PKM2(Y105)-driven Warburg effect by promoting a sustained glycolytic rate that supports rapid cell proliferation. Recognizing that PI3K pathway dysregulation is a common feature of aggressive prostate cancer and diverse human cancers—including brain, breast, renal, lymphoid, cervical, and lung cancers [ 69 Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) derived from MG, including the predominant MG-H1, primarily exert their effects through the activation of RAGE, a cell surface receptor that triggers multiple intracellular signaling cascades, thereby creating a pro-oxidant environment via elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 70 42 71 2 2 2 2 Moreover, the novel involvement of KRIT1 adds an additional layer of complexity to this redox-regulated network in PCa. KRIT1 has not previously been implicated in the MG-H1/RAGE/ROS axis, and its identification in this context reveals a previously unrecognized connection between glycation-driven oxidative signaling and a pathway known primarily for its roles in endothelial homeostasis, cell junction integrity, and redox balance. Our findings suggest that KRIT1 may function as a redox-sensitive signaling hub, modulating cellular responses to changes in ROS levels downstream of RAGE activation. The reduction in H 2 2 KRIT1 functions a scaffold protein involved in multiple signaling cascades and has a protective function against oxidative stress and inflammation. Growing evidence indicates that KRIT1 is critically involved in key redox-regulated processes, such as transcriptional signaling and autophagy, which are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and protection against oxidative damage. This suggests that loss of KRIT1 may exert diverse effects across various redox-sensitive pathways [ 72 Interestingly, our data indicate for the first time that KRIT1 can be subjected to redox regulation, in addition to its role in controlling redox balance—an aspect that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously described. Therefore, our findings also add further complexity to the role of KRIT1 in redox biology. As a key regulator of endothelial cell functions, KRIT1 is critically involved in cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM), a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by leaky, dilated vascular clusters, which can lead to seizures, neurological impairments, and intracerebral hemorrhage [ 39 39 37 38 37 38 Additionally, investigating the role of KRIT1 in other cancer types and its interaction with oxidative stress pathways could provide further insights into its broader significance in tumor biology. Future research should focus on validating this mechanism in vivo and exploring potential inhibitors of the Glo1/MG-H1 axis or RAGE signaling as potential therapeutic strategies. A limitation of this study is that, although we have demonstrated KRIT1 downregulation downstream of the PTEN/PKM2/ERα/Glo1/MG-H1 pathway and shown that exogenous MG treatment strongly supports the proposed KRIT1-associated axis, we were unable to perform KRIT1 overexpression experiments. Such experiments could have provided additional insight into the potential role of KRIT1 in regulating cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Future studies will aim to investigate the functional consequences of KRIT1 restoration on cell growth and apoptotic resistance once the technical challenges of achieving sufficient overexpression are overcome. Furthermore, a deeper investigation into KRIT1 functions and its interplay with RAGE and H 2 2 Finally, some indirect evidence suggests that KRIT1 expression in human prostate tissues may be low or absent. For instance, one study reported a negative correlation between miR-21-5p expression and KRIT1 levels in vessels adjacent to the tumor, suggesting a possible downregulation of KRIT1 within the tumor microenvironment [ 73 www.proteinatlas.org 5. Conclusions In summary, our study identified a previously unrecognized regulatory axis involving PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p-PKM2(Y105)/ERα-driven upregulation of Glo1, which leads to MG-H1 depletion and consequent desensitization of the MG-H1/RAGE signaling cascade. This alteration reduces intracellular H 2 2 2 2 Acknowledgments We thank Roberta Frosini and Ivana Ferri for their excellent technical assistance.
