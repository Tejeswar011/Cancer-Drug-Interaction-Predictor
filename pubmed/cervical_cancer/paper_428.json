HIGHLIGHTS • A multicomponent fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) intervention offers a practical and scalable strategy to increase colorectal cancer screening uptake among African Americans. • On-site FIT kit distribution demonstrated greater cost-effectiveness than mailing upon request. • On-site FIT distribution is financially feasible for sustained adoption by community organizations or local health departments. Introduction To improve colorectal cancer screening uptake among African Americans, the authors collaborated with a public service agency (i.e., Douglas County Treasurers’ Office) and other community and healthcare partners to implement a multicomponent fecal immunochemical test intervention. The objectives of this study are to (1) determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of the community-based fecal immunochemical test intervention between the 2 different types of provision strategies: on-site distribution of fecal immunochemical test versus mailing of fecal immunochemical test upon request; and (2) estimate the budgetary impact if this program is sustained by community organizations or the local health department. Methods Using data from a community colorectal cancer screening outreach trial collected between January 3, 2022, and April 4, 2022, the authors conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis and a budget impact analysis of a multicomponent colorectal cancer screening program. Cost-effectiveness analysis was evaluated using 2 measures: an average implementation cost-effectiveness ratio using the effect and cost data of the overall colorectal cancer screening program and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio when comparing the on-site distribution with mailing of fecal immunochemical test upon request. For the budget impact analysis, the authors used the process map developed for the outreach program workflow to guide the budget impact estimate of the on-site distribution. The authors further conducted a sensitivity analysis to estimate 1-year replication costs of the on-site distribution strategy. Results The overall community outreach program for colorectal cancer screening totaled $14,541, with labor costs of $12,757 and nonlabor costs of $1,784 for the 3-month period. Individually, total costs for on-site distribution ( n n Conclusions The on-site fecal immunochemical testing kit distribution is an effective, practical, relatively low-cost community outreach strategy to improve colorectal cancer screening rates among African American communities. Future studies should explore resources for sustainability and uptake in different settings.

These are prioritized in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Colorectal Cancer Control Program initiatives 8 9 9 10 11 12 13 14 Studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening outreach programs using FITs. For example, using a decision-analytic tree approach with a 1-year time horizon, Wheeler et al. 15 16 17 18 Although community-based CRC screening outreach programs have proven effective in increasing screening rates, there are limited data on the cost and cost-effectiveness of these programs to inform decisions about their adoption, implementation, and sustainability across diverse community contexts. One notable study was conducted by Lairson and colleagues, 19 20 21 , 22 17 To address this gap, the objectives of this study were to (1) determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of on-site FIT distribution strategy versus a mailing of FIT upon request strategy in increasing CRC screening uptake among AAs and (2) estimate the budgetary impact of adopting or sustaining the CRC screening outreach program within community organizations or local health departments. METHODS Study Population With the observational study design, the authors estimated the total cost of implementing a community outreach program for CRC screening. The authors further conducted (1) a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) alongside the community outreach program following the recommendation of Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards 23 The experimental study design, protocol, and preliminary outcomes of the community outreach trial have been described in detail elsewhere. 14 n n n n Owing to the subtle costs of education materials and nonsignificant effects on return rates within on-site distribution and mailing of FIT upon request strategies, in this study, the authors simplified the economic evaluation by focusing the on-site distribution ( n n Measures The authors assessed the cost analysis and CEA of the community outreach program from the organizational (i.e., local health department/community nonprofit organization) perspective. The community nonprofit organization may be interested in sustaining the current program or replicating it into other CTOs. The authors conducted the analyses over a 3-month time horizon for CEA and 1-year time horizon for BIA without exercising discounting. The authors separated the cost associated with implementing the community outreach program for CRC screening into labor costs and nonlabor costs. Applying the activity-based costing approach, 24 25 26 27 28 Figure 1 Figure 1 Process map depicting the workflow of the community CRC screening outreach program.

Figure 1 The authors multiplied the time (in hours) spent on each activity with the hourly wage of the personnel involved in the outreach activities. The authors applied the 2022 national average hourly rate 29 30 The primary outcome of the community CRC screening outreach trial was FIT kit return rates 6 months after randomization, defined as the corresponding number of returned FIT kits divided by the number of individuals assigned to the on-site distribution or the mailing of FIT upon request group. The secondary outcomes included FIT-positive rates in both groups, determined by the corresponding number of positive cases divided by the number of individuals assigned to the on-site distribution or mailing of FIT upon request groups. Details on the effectiveness of the CRC screening outreach trial have been published elsewhere. 14 31 Statistical Analysis The authors used the descriptive analysis to summarize the total number of labor hours and total labor and nonlabor costs associated with outreach activities by intervention arms (on-site distribution versus mailing of FIT upon request). The cost-effectiveness of the community outreach program was evaluated using 2 measures. An average implementation cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) 32 24 The authors conducted a BIA to estimate the potential costs of sustaining the on-site distribution strategy in the current setting or expanding its deployment to other contexts. This strategy demonstrated a higher return rate and reduced barriersࣧsuch as eliminating the need to request screening kits or providing a reliable mailing addressࣧthan the mailing of FIT upon request approach. The authors used the process map ( Figure 1 After identifying the relevant activities and cost items for implementation or maintenance through research team consensus, the authors estimated the costs associated with the on-site distribution strategy needed for program replication or sustainability over an organization’s budget cycle, which typically spans over 1 year. The authors conducted 1-way sensitivity analysis of the initial cost to estimate the replication or sustainability costs of the on-site distribution strategy if the program is adopted in other community settings or maintained in the current context and further assessed the variations as a result of individual activity or cost category. The authors varied each cost category identified for the sustainment and adoption of the on-site distribution by ±50% 33 RESULTS Table 1 n n Table 1 Intervention Cost Components, by Study Arms Table 1 Items Personnel involved Quantity Total costs On-site distribution n Mailing FIT upon request n Labor costs Developing educational material content PI and project staff 40 hours per person $2,381 $1,253 $1,128 Developing introductory letter Community leader, PI, and project staff 1 hour per person $89 $47 $42 Assembling packets Project staff 10 hours $298 $157 $141 Travel time to the location Transportation times a PI and project staff 13 hours + 12 hours $735 $387 $348 Transportation a PI and project staff 388 + 353 miles $485 $255 $230 Information booth (distribution of FIT kit/information sheets) a PI and project staff 107 + 97 hours $6,071 $3,195 $2,876 Obtaining information and preparing and mailing out the kits Project staff 4 hours $112 $112 Reminder call to return testing kits Project staff 4.3 hours + 4.2 hours $253 $128 $125 Sending results to participants GP task force staff 3.4 hours + 1.4 hours $146 $104 $42 Following up with participants who tested positive PI and project staff 64 hours $1,905 $1,651 $254 Assisting participants for colonoscopy and financial service Community navigator 7.5 hours + 2.5 hours $283 $208 $74 Subtotal $12,757 $7,385 $5,372 Nonlabor costs (unit cost) FIT kit ($3.75) 155 $581 $413 $169 Educational material printing ($0.39) 209 $42 $23 $19 Introduction letter ($0.20) 209 $41 $22 $19 Envelope/packet ($0.26) 209 $54 $29 $26 FIT laboratory processing ($18.05) 59 $1,065 $758 $307 Subtotal $1,784 $1,244 $540 Total costs $14,541 $8,629 $5,912 Cost per person enrolled 209 $70 $78 $60 Cost per person returned FIT kits/screened (ACER) 59 $246 $205 $348 Cost per person tested positive 15 $969 $664 $2,956 Cost of the number needed to return (FIT kits) to prevent 1 case 5 $1,232 — — a Distributed between on-site distribution and mailing FIT upon request groups was based on the numbers of participants assigned to each group.

In terms of budget impact, the total replication cost of the on-site distribution strategy was estimated at $7,329 annually after excluding activities of developing education material content and introductory letter. Figure 2 Figure 2 One-way sensitivity testing for the total replication costs of adopting the on-site distribution strategy. Note: Figure 2 DISCUSSION This study evaluated the cost and cost-effectiveness of a CRC screening outreach program conducted in AA communities. Study results showed that while the on-site distribution strategy was cost-effective compared with the mailing of FIT upon request strategy, the latter had a lower cost for per person enrolled ($60 vs $78). However, the on-site distribution strategy had a lower cost per person screened ($205 vs $348). These findings underscore the importance of reducing logistical barriers by directly providing CRC screening tests, either through on-site distribution or mailing them to individuals’ homes without additional steps (e.g., requesting FIT kits, as examined in this study). This on-site distribution strategy has strong potential to effectively reach target populations, particularly AAs, by utilizing easily accessible community locations, such as local government offices (e.g., CTOs in this case). It also offers a valuable opportunity for face-to-face engagement through personalized navigation services provided by the trained CHWs. These services can include individualized support to address perceived benefits, barriers, and susceptibility related to CRC screening. The direct navigation process may involve explaining the importance of CRC screening (as done in this study), arranging transportation to screening centers, ordering FITs to be delivered to individuals’ homes, and answering questions about FIT usage and CRC screening procedures—activities supported by findings from other studies. 18 , 20 , 34 35 The CEA results, showing a cost of $109 per additional person screened, are comparable with findings from other studies on CRC screening outreach programs. For instance, Wheeler et al. 15 19 34 To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the few studies evaluating the implementation cost, cost-effectiveness, and organizational budgetary impact of a community-based CRC screening outreach programs using FIT. Most previous studies have been conducted in healthcare settings 16 , 17 , 35 15 , 36 37 , 38 39 Limitations Several limitations should be acknowledged. First, in the CEA, the authors did not estimate costs related to cancer treatment, downstream health care, or informal caregiving (e.g., opportunity costs). This decision was made because the primary focus of the community outreach trial was to increase the reach and adoption of CRC screening, prioritizing the identification and evaluation of strategies that enhance access and uptake rather than delving into the broader healthcare cost implications associated with downstream outcomes. The primary objective of this study was to assess implementation costs to inform multisectoral community partnership decisions regarding program sustainability and future adoption. To facilitate cross-study comparisons, the authors used straightforward metrics such as the cost per person enrolled, screened, and testing positive for program evaluation. Second, the cost data were collected retrospectively, relying on the review of study documents and records by project staff and the principal investigator, which may introduce recall bias. Finally, the CEA results should be interpreted with caution because the community outreach trial was conducted using a 2-by-2 study design (with or without educational materials and on-site distribution versus mailing of FIT upon request). Owing to nonsignificant results and small sample sizes, the authors collapsed the strategies with and without education materials within both the on-site distribution and mailing of FIT upon request groups. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the authors calculated detailed program costs and estimated the replication costs for the multicomponent community-based CRC screening outreach program. The on-site FIT kit distribution is an effective, practical, relatively low-cost outreach strategy to improve CRC screening rates among AA communities. Future studies should explore resources for sustainability and uptake in different community settings, associated cost components and effectiveness of interest, and their cost-effectiveness.
