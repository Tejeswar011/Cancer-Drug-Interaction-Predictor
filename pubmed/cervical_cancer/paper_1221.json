Introduction DNA and RNA biomacromolecules are involved in critical processes in living cells, including DNA replication, transcription, and processes of protein synthesis [ 1 2 3 4 Numerous biologically active small molecules owe their activity to binding to polynucleotides (namely, intercalation between base pairs, minor or major groove binding, and/or external electrostatic binding [ 5 6 7 8 Dynamic structural transitions between common B-DNA and non-canonical forms influence and regulate gene expression. Thus, stabilisation of non-canonical structures generated in the parent DNA or RNA by an NCS-selective ligand can enhance or inhibit specific biological activities. As a result, NCS ligands have anticancer and antiviral therapeutic potential [ 5 9 10 11 G-quadruplex ( G4 12 G4 13 14 G4 15 16 17 18 Among the numerous polynucleotide binders that possess biological activity are guanidine-containing compounds. The guanidine functionality is found in important biological molecules: arginine (amino acid), agmatine (neurotransmitter), creatine (muscular energy intermediate) and guanine (purine bases of DNA and RNA) [ 19 The protonation of the basic guanidine group leads to the formation of a very stable guanidinium cation, whereby the delocalisation of the guanidinium cation’s positive charge through six π-electrons in the bonding orbitals forms a Y-delocalisation system [ 20 21 22 Previously, we synthesised and studied a series of guanidino-aryl compounds in which the guanidino group is directly attached to the aryl moiety. Variation in the size of the aryl-moiety (in ascending order: naphthalene, acridine, pyrene and porphyrin) showed weak DNA binding for naphthalene–guanidine with a small condensed aromatic surface, but also no notable difference in DNA affinity for various aromatic surfaces (acridine, pyrene and phenanthridine). Steric caused by the direct attachment of guanidine to the aromatic moiety resulted in binding of the ligands in the minor groove instead of the expected intercalation [ 23 Continuing our previous work, we have prepared a new series of guanidino-aryl molecules, in which the guanidino group is directly bound to an aromatic moiety. For comparison with derivatives with a larger aromatic surface area, a naphthalene derivative was prepared in which the guanidino group is positioned differently from the previously published analogue [ 23 Scheme 1 GA PoGU 2.

Interactions of GA1 GA4 The affinity of GA GA ct 2 28 29 30 31 30 Supplementary Materials (Table S2) Disclosing the binding mode of small molecules to DNA is crucial for comprehending the underlying physical–chemical processes and their prospective biological applications. For example, alkaloid palmatine, a DNA binder and candidate for photodynamic therapy, contains a tetracyclic ring system and a positive charge, and has the capacity for both intercalation and groove binding. Long-range molecular dynamics simulations identified that intercalation is the dominant binding mode of palmatine with DNA [ 32 23 2.3.1. Thermal Melting Studies Small-molecule binding to double-stranded DNA/RNA generally influences double-helix stability. The stabilisation or destabilisation of a polynucleotide was indicated by a change in its melting temperature, at which the double helix dissociates into two single-stranded chains ( Tm 33 GA1 GA4 Table 1 Supplementary Materials, Figure S2 GA1 GA4 ct GA1 The lack of double-helix stabilisation for GA2 GA3 34 35 36 37 38 39 38 GA1 GA4 2.3.2.

Circular Dichroism Experiments Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy was used to detect conformational changes in polynucleotide secondary structure caused by small-molecule binding. The characteristic circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of DNA B-form has a positive band at 275 nm attributed to base stacking and a negative band at 245 nm caused by helicity. While groove binding and electrostatic interactions of small molecules do not change significantly base stacking and helicity bands, intercalation has a larger impact on the intensities of both bands [ 35 42 43 44 45 46 In most circular dichroism (CD) titrations of polynucleotides with GA GA1 GA4 47 No significant changes in the CD spectra were observed during the titration of poly rA-poly rU with GA1 GA4 Supplementary Materials, Figures S25–S30 GA1 Supplementary Materials, Figure S25 GA1 GA2 GA4 A minor groove of poly dGdC-poly dGdC is not suitable for groove binding because of the hinderance of protruding NH 2 30 GA2 GA4 GA1 GA3 Figure 3 2.3.4. Discussion of the Spectroscopic Results Our objective was to investigate the impact of various aryl groups attached to positively charged guanidine on its binding affinity to DNA/RNA. The guanidino group directly linked to the aryl prevents the complete intercalation of planar aryl groups between base pairs [ 23 Guanidino cations contain 6π electrons in the bonding orbitals, and their delocalisation is called “Y aromaticity” [ 21 22 Among GA GA1 GA1 34 35 GA4 GA1 GA4 It is reported that the possibility of intercalation of fluorene is dependent upon regiochemical factors [ 38 48 39 GA2 GA3 Although CD titration spectroscopy is generally beneficial, it cannot be used to determine the binding mode for GA GA 2.4. Interactions of GA1 GA4 PoGU G-quadruplex ( G4 12 G4 49 G4 G4 Telomeric DNA in vertebrates has a repeated sequence d(TTAGGG); therefore, oligonucleotide Tel22 (5′-AGGG(TTAGGG)3–3′) is commonly used as a model of the G-quadruplex structure.

Biological Activity of GA1 GA4 PoGU The guanidine group occurs in a variety of biologically important compounds, making guanidine compounds important in medicinal chemistry. Guanidine-containing derivatives have a broad spectrum of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitory, NO synthase inhibitory, antithrombotic, antidiabetic, antiviral, antiparasitic, and chemotherapeutic properties [ 22 59 19 59 22 GA1 GA4 PoGU GA1 GA3 PoGU 23 GA1 GA4 PoGU Supplementary Materials, Figures S34 and S35 IC 50 60 Besides DNA binding as the most important mechanism, there are also other various cytotoxicity mechanisms described, such as interference with cell membranes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis, Rac1-mediated inhibition of the MAPK/ERK signalling pathway, and induction of cellular apoptosis [ 19 22 61 The DNA-binding affinity of guanidine-containing compounds is usually positively correlated with their antiproliferative activity [ 19 22 GA3 GA1 GA3 3.

General Procedures for the Study of DNA/RNA Interactions UV–Vis absorption spectra of compounds were measured on a Varian Cary 100 Bio spectrometer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Thermal melting experiments were measured on a JASCO V-730 UV–Vis spectrometer (ABL&E Handels GmbH, Wien, Austria). Fluorescence spectra and fluorimetric titrations were measured on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorimeter (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). CD spectra were measured on a JASCO J815 spectrophotometer (ABL&E Handels GmbH, Wien, Austria). UV–Vis, fluorescence and CD spectra were recorded in the suitable 1 cm path quartz cuvettes.

Conclusions Novel guanidino-aryl compounds ( GA GA1 GA4 The phenanthrene-based compound GA1 CD titrations predominantly demonstrated small or negligible alterations of polynucleotide spectra and an absence of ICD spectra, while the absorption spectra of polynucleotides and GA ligands overlapped, so the CD titration outcomes were insufficient for distinctly elucidating the particular binding mechanisms of ligands to polynucleotides. We examined the new guanidino-aryl compounds ( GA PoGU GA1 GA4 PoGU PoGU Guanidino-aryl compounds GA1 GA4 PoGU GA3 These results showed a strong impact of aromatic structure to the binding properties of aryl-guanidino compounds, which is relevant to the rational design of novel guanidino derivatives targeting nucleic acid structures for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.
