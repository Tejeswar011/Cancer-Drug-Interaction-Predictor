However, its clinical application is limited due to dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Currently, few effective strategies exist to mitigate or eliminate DOX-induced cardiomyopathy (DIC). Although ferroptosis is implicated in DIC and its inhibition partially alleviates the condition, the direct targets of DOX in the progression of cardiotoxicity remain unclear. This study aimed to discover the direct targets of DOX in ferroptosis-mediated DIC. Methods: A DOX pulldown assay was performed to identify proteins specifically binding to DOX in murine hearts, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify candidate proteins. A cardiac injury mouse model was established by DOX treatment. Based on this, multiple ferroptosis biomarkers were detected by flow cytometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunochemistry, etc. Besides, specific activator and inhibitor of signaling pathways were applied to illuminate molecular mechanisms. Results: Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) was identified as a DOX target. GSTP1 activity was inhibited in DOX-treated cardiomyocytes, while its overexpression significantly alleviated DIC. Moreover, GSTP1 overexpression inhibited acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4)-dependent ferroptosis. Mechanistically, GSTP1 overexpression suppressed c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation, thereby reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inhibiting ferroptosis in DIC. Conclusions: This study identifies the DOX/GSTP1/JNK axis as a critical pathway mediating ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis in DIC. GSTP1 is highlighted as a potential key mediator of ferroptosis and a promising therapeutic target for DIC.

[ 1 [ 2 3 4 5 6 [ 1 7 Recent advances in understanding DIC pathogenesis have highlighted the pivotal role of ROS production and iron dysregulation, particularly in the novel cell death pathway termed ferroptosis.

[ 29 30 31 [ 32 33 34 [ 31 35 36 37 [ 38 39 40 Methods Animals Male C57BL/6 mice aged 6–8 weeks were used in this study (Huafukang Co., Beijing, China) and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility at Chengdu Medical College in accordance with animal care and ethical regulations (No. 20220225138). The DIC model was induced 3 weeks later through a single intraperitoneal injection of DOX (No. S1208, Selleck Chemicals, Houston, Texas, USA) at a dose of 20 mg/kg. To achieve cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of GSTP1 in vivo GSTP1 GSTP1 Biacore A Biacore T200 surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor (GE HealthCare, Chicago, USA) was used to measure the binding constant between DOX and GSTP1, following a previously reported method. [ 41 Cell culture and treatment H9c2 and HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, HyClone, Utah, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 Cell viability analysis Cell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (No. B34304 Lentivirus infection Lentiviral vectors encoding GSTP1 in vitro Small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection The siRNA sequences for silencing GSTP1 ACSL4 http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 For transfection, Lipo293 reagent (No. C0521, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was used following the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes at an appropriate density, incubated overnight, and transfected with siRNAs mixed with Opti-MEM (No. 31985070, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,USA) for 48 h before analysis. Echocardiography assessment Transthoracic echocardiography was performed 14 days after left anterior descending artery (LAD) surgery using the Vevo 3100 ultrasound system (Fujifilm VisualSonics, Ontario, Canada). Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, maintaining a heart rate of approximately 400 beats per minute (bpm). B-mode cardiac imaging was obtained from parasternal long- and short-axis views, with papillary muscles serving as landmarks for short-axis imaging. M-mode recordings of the left ventricle (LV) were acquired, and data were analyzed using VevoLAB software (Version 5.6.1, Fujifilm VisualSonics, Ontario, Canada) following standardized guidelines. Histological analysis Heart tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 4 μm slices. Additional slices were subjected to immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining based on established protocols. [ 42 43 Sirius Red and Masson staining Heart tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 4 μm slices. Selected slices were stained using Masson staining kit (No. G1340, Solarbio, Beijing, China) and Sirius Red staining kit (No.G1472, Solarbio, Beijing, China) respectively, according to the instructions. Images were captured using an Olympus microscope. RNA extraction and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was isolated from all samples using TRIzol TM TM Gapdh http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 −ΔΔCt Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Western blotting For Co-IP, cell or tissue lysates prepared with IP lysis buffer were incubated with specific primary antibodies or immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a negative control. Protein A/G beads were added to the mixture, which was incubated overnight at 4°C. The beads were subsequently washed and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Western blotting, as described previously. [ 42 43 Biochemical detection Following euthanasia via cervical dislocation, serum was collected through eyeball blood sampling. The levels of creatine kinase isoenzymes (CK-MB; No. CSB-E14404m, CUSABIO), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; No. CSB-E11723m, CUSABIO), lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde [MDA], No. BC0025, Solarbio), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; No. CSB-E12649m, CUSABIO) were quantified using the respective kits, according to the manufacturers’ protocols and previous studies. [ 28 44 Iron assay Intracellular ferrous iron (Fe 2+ [ 45 46 2 DOX pulldown DOX was conjugated with epoxy-activated μSphere resin (No. P057A, Sinopae, Wuxi, China) via incubation in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer for 12 h at 4°C. The resin-DOX complex was washed three times and subsequently incubated with heart tissue lysates prepared from 7-day-old C57BL/6 mice. The lysates were centrifuged at 4°C (12,000 r/min, r = 10 cm, 10 min), and the supernatant was incubated with resin-DOX at 4°C for 12 h. Differential proteins were identified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis. Measurement of GSTP1 activity The enzymatic activity of GSTP1 was determined using GST activity assay kits (No. ab65325, Abcam, Cambridge, England), following the manufacturer’s guidelines and previous reports. [ 47 48 Molecular docking Molecular docking studies were conducted using the 3D structure of GSTP1 (PDB code: 14GS) and DOX, employing the CB-Dock2 platform for cavity detection-based blind docking (a cavity detection-guided protein–ligand blind docking web server, https://cadd.labshare.cn/cb-dock2/php/blinddock.php#job_list_load [ 49 50 Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay Apoptosis levels in cardiomyocytes and heart tissues were evaluated using a TUNEL assay kit (No. T2130, Solarbio), following the manufacturer’s instructions and prior studies. [ 51 Measurement of ROS level ROS levels were measured using diacetyldichlorofluorescein (DCFH-DA; No. S0033M, Beyotime) staining in cells and DHE (No. ID3560, Solarbio) staining in heart tissues. For DCFH-DA staining, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with DCFH-DA for 30 minutes at 37°C in the dark. After incubation, the cells were washed three times with PBS, and ROS levels were analyzed via flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, East Rutherford, USA). For DHE staining, tissue sections were stained with DHE for 20 minutes at 37°C in the dark, followed by two PBS washes. Fluorescence images were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus). Lipid ROS assay Lipid ROS levels were assessed by collecting treated cells, washing them with PBS, and incubating them with BODIPY581/591-C11 (No. D3816, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) for 20 minutes at 37°C in the dark. The cells were subsequently washed with PBS, resuspended, and analyzed using flow cytometry (BD Biosciences). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) Tissues and cells were immediately immersed in aldehyde fixing solution after treatment. Samples were dehydrated and embedded at room temperature and sectioned into ultrathin slices. These sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Imaging was performed using a transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10.0 (GraphPad Software, California, USA). Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). A Student’s t P Results DOX targets GSTP1 and inhibits its activity To investigate the potential targets of DOX in the pathogenesis of DIC, DOX pulldown assays were performed to identify proteins specifically binding to DOX in murine hearts. GSTP1 was selected for further study owing to its close association with myocardial damage and the established relationship between ROS imbalance and DIC.

No significant changes in GSTP1 levels were observed following DOX treatment in vivo 1 1 Subsequent analyses showed that DOX significantly inhibited GSTP1 activity in H9c2 cells [Figure 1 in vitro 1 http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 [ 50 54 1 Overall, these findings reveal that DOX specifically targets GSTP1, disrupts its interaction with GSH, and inhibits its enzymatic activity. GSTP1 protects against DIC Since GSTP1 inhibition (via TLK199 treatment) exacerbates cardiomyocyte damage, GSTP1 was hypothesized to play a critical role in mitigating DIC. To elucidate the role of GSTP1 in vivo 2 Figure 2 GSTP1 protects against DIC. (A) Western blotting analysis of relative expression levels of GSTP1 in different groups of mice.

These detrimental changes were attenuated by cardiac-specific GSTP1 overexpression [Figure 2 2 2 Using a previously established model, [ 55 2 In vitro http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 In summary, these results indicate that GSTP1 overexpression enhances its activity, mitigating DIC-associated cytotoxicity and cardiac damage. GSTP1 ameliorates DOX-induced ferroptosis in vitro Previous studies have indicated that ferroptosis plays a significant role in DIC, and selective inhibitors of ferroptosis markedly improve outcomes following DOX treatment. [ 8 56 Initial findings from cell viability assays demonstrated that GSTP1 overexpression alleviated DOX-induced cytotoxicity [Figure 3 3 3 2+ 3 Figure 3 GSTP1 ameliorates DOX-induced ferroptosis in H9c2 cells.

Silencing GSTP1 exacerbated DOX-induced cytotoxicity and ferroptosis [Supplementary Figure 3, http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 These findings collectively indicate that GSTP1 is a critical mediator of ferroptosis, attenuating DOX-induced cardiomyocyte injury. GSTP1 relieved RSL3-induced ferroptosis and is a potential mediator of ferroptosis To further investigate whether GSTP1 regulates ferroptosis, various parameters of ferroptosis were evaluated in H9c2 cells. Treatment with RSL3, a ferroptosis activator, resulted in a marked reduction in cell survival. Interestingly, GSTP1 overexpression mitigated this reduction, while GSTP1 silencing exacerbated it, suggesting GSTP1’s involvement in ferroptosis [Figure 4 Figure 4 Overexpression of GSTP1 inhibits RSL3-induced ferroptosis in H9c2 cells.

Results consistent with those in H9c2 cells confirmed GSTP1’s role in ferroptosis regulation [Supplementary Figure 5, http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 Overall, GSTP1 overexpression alleviated RSL3-induced ferroptosis, highlighting its potential role as a key mediator of ferroptosis. Overexpression of GSTPP1 and Fer-1 administration improved DIC To determine whether GSTP1-mediated protection against DIC is ferroptosis-dependent, Fer-1 was administered prior to DOX treatment in vivo 5 5 http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 Figure 5 Overexpression of GSTP1 and Fer-1 administration improved DIC in vivo n n Ptgs2 n n * P † P Increased ROS levels, aberrant 4-HNE expression, mitochondrial damage (murine hearts), reduced Ptgs2 5 Collectively, these findings demonstrate that GSTP1 overexpression and Fer-1 administration confer significant protective effects against DIC, underscoring the essential role of GSTP1 in ferroptosis-mediated cardio-protection. DOX inhibits GSTP1-JNK binding and further induces ferroptosis It has been reported that GSTP1 interacts with JNK to suppress its phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway. Under oxidative stress, the GSTP1-JNK complex dissociates, leading to downstream activation and induction of apoptosis. [ 56 57 58 59 [ 60 Results confirmed that GSTP1 binds specifically to JNK irrespective of DOX treatment, although DOX treatment led to the downregulation of JNK expression [Figure 6 6 6 Figure 6 DOX inhibits GSTP1–JNK binding and further induces ferroptosis. (A) Co-IP and Western blotting analysis of GSTP1 binding with JNK in H9c2 cells treated with DOX or not. (B) Expression levels of JNK, p-JNK, and GAPDH were determined by western blotting in H9c2 cells. (C) IHC staining of JNK and p-JNK in heart tissues after DOX treatment (scale bar, 50 μm, n 2+ * P Subsequent experiments evaluated whether the GSTP1/JNK signaling pathway mediates ferroptosis in DIC. The JNK inhibitor alleviated DOX-induced ferroptosis, as evidenced by cell viability assays showing that anisomycin (a JNK agonist) induced cytotoxicity comparable to DOX, whereas JNK inhibition and GSTP1 overexpression restored cell viability [Figure 6 6 Additional ferroptosis markers, including mitochondrial damage and Fe 2+ 2+ 6 To explore the mechanism further, DOX-treated cells were exposed to anisomycin and SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor). As anticipated, anisomycin enhanced JNK phosphorylation, whereas SP600125 inhibited it, even in the presence of DOX pretreatment [Figure 6 http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 These results collectively indicate that DOX targets GSTP1, activating the JNK signaling pathway to promote ferroptosis in DIC. However, these effects can be reversed by GSTP1 overexpression. DOX activates ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis by GSTP1/JNK axis Given the potential regulatory role of GSTP1 in ferroptosis, the specific involvement of GSTP1 in DOX-induced ferroptosis was further investigated. ACSL4, a lipid metabolism enzyme essential for lipid peroxidation, [ 61 [ 28 7 7 Figure 7 DOX binds to GSTP1 to activate JNK, and induces ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis in H9c2 cells. (A) Western blotting analysis of ACSL4. (B) Western blotting analysis of ACSL4 with 3 different siRNAs. (C–K) based on the silence of ACSL4, a series of markers of ferroptosis were detected including cell viability (C), ROS (D), Lipid-ROS (E), MDA level (F), JC-1 staining (G), Lipofluo (H), MitoTracker (I), FerroOrange (J), and GSH/GSSG ratio (K). (L) Western blotting analysis of ACSL4, JNK, and p-JNK. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM, * P † P To further elucidate this mechanism, H9c2 cells overexpressing ACSL4 were generated on a GSTP1-overexpression background [Supplementary Figure 9A, http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 http://links.lww.com/CM9/C564 The role of the JNK signaling pathway in regulating ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis was also examined using a JNK activator and inhibitor. Activation of the JNK signaling pathway was associated with increased ACSL4 expression following DOX treatment. Conversely, GSTP1 overexpression inhibited both the JNK signaling pathway and ACSL4 expression [Figure 7 In summary, these results demonstrate that DOX disrupts GSTP1 binding, thereby activating JNK and promoting ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis. Discussion In this study, we identified a novel role of GSTP1 in ferroptosis-mediated DIC. DOX specifically targets GSTP1, significantly inhibiting its activity both extracellularly and intracellularly, without altering its expression levels. Cardiac overexpression of GSTP1 alleviated DIC by regulating ferroptosis, whereas GSTP1 silencing exacerbated DIC. Furthermore, a selective ferroptosis inhibitor enhanced the protective effect of GSTP1 against DIC. Mechanistically, DOX inhibits GSTP1 activity, reducing its interaction with JNK. This reduction leads to increased phosphorylation of JNK, ultimately activating ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis. These findings underscore the critical role of the DOX/GSTP1/JNK axis in ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis during DIC. DOX, a widely used antitumor drug, exhibits dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, often resulting in severe cardiac dysfunction. The most widely accepted mechanism of DIC involves DOX accumulation in mitochondria, leading to ROS production and subsequent cell death. [ 44 62 Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of GSTP1 in redox regulation, [ 63 64 65 [ 66 Given the observation that DOX targets GSTP1 in DIC, and ferroptosis has been implicated in the development of DIC, [ 8 [ 15 2+ To further elucidate the role of GSTP1 in ferroptosis, we examined the interaction between GSTP1 and JNK. Previous studies have reported a direct interaction between GSTP1 and JNK in the regulation of kinase pathways. [ 57 67 [ 68 Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, although AAV9-mediated GSTP1 overexpression demonstrated a protective effect against DIC in a murine DIC model, GSTP1-knockout mice were not used to confirm whether GSTP1 deficiency exacerbates DIC. Nevertheless, cellular experiments indicated that GSTP1 silencing increased DOX-induced myocardial toxicity in H9c2 cells. Second, this study focused exclusively on ferroptosis-mediated DIC, without an in-depth investigation of other forms of programmed cell death. Third, while a ferroptosis inhibitor (Fer-1) was used to alleviate DIC, other inhibitors were not evaluated to determine their potential therapeutic effects on DIC. These limitations warrant further investigation in future studies. In conclusion, this study uncovered a novel role of the DOX/GSTP1/JNK axis in the regulation of ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis in DIC. Specifically, GSTP1 mitigates ACSL4-dependent ferroptosis through inhibition of the JNK pathway, thereby alleviating DIC. These findings advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying DOX-induced ferroptosis and suggest GSTP1 as a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for the clinical management of DIC.
