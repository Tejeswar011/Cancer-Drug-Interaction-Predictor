See http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ Abstract Background Ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7) is a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes ubiquitin from specific protein substrates to modify their degradation rates thereby regulating crucial cellular processes integral to cancer. Conspicuously, overexpression of USP7 is strongly associated with the progression and poor prognosis in various cancers. Therefore, the design of potent and selective USP7 inhibitors poses an attractive therapeutic approach. The mechanism of action of USP7 inhibitors in cancer cells relies on MDM2 depletion and the restoration of p53. Methods In this study, we present OAT-4828, a novel and highly potent USP7-selective lead compound with a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for an oral administration. In in vivo models of melanoma and colon cancers, we determine the antitumor activity of OAT-4828, revealing its significant influence on various immune cell populations by flow cytometry. Results We provide evidence that OAT-4828 alters the tumor microenvironment, affecting immune cells including T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. As a result, OAT-4828 enhances antitumor functions, specifically improves T-cell activity, manifested by increased cytotoxicity, which is crucial for the effectiveness of OAT-4828 in vivo. Moreover, OAT-4828 changes the phenotype of macrophages and dendritic cells by decreasing the level of immunosuppressive proteins, such as programmed death-ligand 1. Translational results from the human co-culture system revealed the unexpected anti-angiogenic effect of the USP7 inhibitor, which was not observed when compared with an MDM2 inhibitor. Conclusions Overall, OAT-4828 demonstrates significant anticancer efficacy in melanoma and colon cancer models by activating the immune system, suggesting that USP7 may function as a checkpoint contributing to immunosuppression in cancer.

Most relevant to the cancer field are two targets of USP7 namely downregulation of MDM2 resulting in the stabilization of p53. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS We present a novel, selective orally available lead compound that inhibits USP7 in nanomolar concentrations. Historically, the role of USP7 in immunoregulation has been documented but not extensively studied compared with its direct effect on cancer cells. We demonstrate that USP7 inhibition leads to activation of antitumor immune response. Notably, the efficacy of USP7 inhibitor greatly depends on T cells activation, which seems to be the main executors of tumor growth inhibition. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY This study offers new insights into the role of USP7 in the tumor microenvironment and suggests that targeting USP7 provides a novel approach for cancer immunotherapy that can overcome the low immunogenicity of tumors. Background In order to ensure healthy cell functions, protein synthesis and degradation must be precisely regulated. Hence, unwanted or damaged proteins are consistently polyubiquitinated to become recognized and degraded by the proteasome complex. Ubiquitylation is carried out by ubiquitin-activating (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating (E2), and ubiquitin-ligase (E3) enzymes and can be reversed by deubiquitinases (DUBs), which remove ubiquitin leading to protein stabilization. 1 2 Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7) belongs to the DUBs family and was found to be overexpressed in a variety of cancer types, including melanoma, 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 13 14 15 16 17 In this study, we examine the antitumor effects exerted by OAT-4828—a new, potent, and selective USP7 inhibitor. In addition to the well-established cytotoxic effects mediated through modulation of the MDM2/p53 pathway, our results reveal that the mechanism of action of OAT-4828 involves the activation of the antitumor immune response. We have demonstrated a direct activation of murine and human T cells by OAT-4828, which highlights an immunomodulatory role for USP7. Importantly, incubation with OAT-4828 leads to efficient MDM2 degradation in both T cells and myeloid cells, thereby influencing immune cell function and modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME). Subsequent functional in vitro assay demonstrated enhanced cytotoxic capacity resulting in improved killing of cancer cells by immune cells isolated from OAT-4828 treated mice. These findings open new avenues for combinatorial cancer therapies. Methods Cell culture The B16F10 cells (ATCC) and SW480 cells (Merck) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 250 ng/mL amphotericin B (15240062; Thermo Fisher). The CT-26 cells (ATCC) and Jurkat cells (ATCC), and NFAT Luciferase-eGFP reporter cell line Jurkat-NFAT (BPS Bioscience; #78662) cells were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 medium (RPMI), supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and 250 ng/mL amphotericin B (15240062; Thermo Fisher) for CT-26 and Jurkat cell lines or with addition of 0.5 µg/mL of puromycin (Gibco; A11138-03) in case of Jurkat-NFAT reporters. The cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO 2 Mycoplasma Molecular binding assays For both assays, OAT-4828 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxideto (DMSO) a 30 mM stock concentration and prepared as a 10-point serial dilution, including a pre-dilution step in DMSO. The USP7 Ub-rhodamine 110 assay was conducted in half-area black 96-well plates (Greiner, Cat# 675076) using an assay buffer containing 50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethane-sulfonic acid (HEPES) pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 1% DMSO, with a final reaction volume of 45 µL. The assay included: USP7 enzyme (0.4 nM final concentration, R&D Systems, Cat# E-519), OATD-4828 compound (from serial dilution), and Ub-Rho110Gly substrate (500 nM final concentration, UbiQ Bio, Cat# UbiQ-002). Controls included enzyme-only (positive), buffer-only (negative), and reference compound wells. Plates were spun at 250 rpm for 2 min, incubated at 25°C in the dark for 30 min, and fluorescence was measured at excitation 485 nm and emission 535 nm using a (SPARK 10M) plate reader (TECAN). In the Ub-CHOP2 assay (Life Sensors), USP7 removes ubiquitin from the enzyme, activating it to catalyze its substrate. This catalytic activity is directly proportional to USP7 activity and is monitored, making it a reporter assay. The assay was conducted in black 96-well plates (Greiner, Cat# 675076) using an assay buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8, 2 mM CaCl₂, 0.05% Tween, 2 mM DTT, and 1% DMSO, with a final reaction volume of 50 µL. The assay included: USP7 enzyme (0.75 nM final concentration), OATD-4828 compound (from serial dilution), and substrates (100 nM Ub-CHOP2-Reporter and 100 nM CHOP2-Substrate final concentrations, LifeSensors, Cat# PR1101). Controls included enzyme-only (positive) and buffer-only (negative) wells. Plates were spun at 250 rpm for 2 min, incubated at 25°C in the dark for 60 min, and fluorescence was measured at excitation 485 nm and emission 531 nm using a SpectraMax i3x plate reader (Molecular Devices). Animal studies The studies were conducted on 7–9 weeks old BALB/c or C57BL/6 female mice, purchased from Charles River Laboratories, under ethical approval number 1396/2022 and 139/2020 issued by the Local Ethics Committee for Animal Experiments in Warsaw, Poland. The experimental models included pharmacokinetic analysis, CT26 (CRC) and B16F10 (melanoma) cell lines. All procedures adhered to the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Guidelines for the Welfare and Use of Animals in Cancer Research. Analgesia and anesthesia were employed to minimize discomfort, and humane endpoints were rigorously applied to ensure ethical treatment of the animals. Tumor treatment and monitoring Cancer cells (CT26 and B16F10) were harvested during the exponential growth phase, with viability exceeding 90% as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. For subcutaneous inoculation, cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and injected in the right flank at 4×10⁵ (B16F10) or 5×10⁵ (CT26) cells in a total volume of 50 µL, and then randomized into experimental groups. Groups included vehicle controls, which received only the vehicle, and OAT-4828 treatment groups. In the B16F10 model, OAT-4828 was administered at 100 mg/kg two times a day starting on day 5 post-inoculation. In the CT26 model, OAT-4828 was administered at 25 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg two times a day, with treatment starting on either day 2 or day 5 post-inoculation, depending on the experimental set-up. The order of treatment of animal groups was randomized to minimize potential confounding factors, and experimental groups were not blinded. Body weight of the animals was measured at least two times a week. Terminal blood sampling was performed following euthanasia of the mice using an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine and xylazine. A blood count was carried out by VetLab laboratory (Warsaw, Poland) using an automated hematology analyzer. OAT-4828 was dissolved in sterile water, with concentrations prepared to achieve the target doses. In combination therapy studies, anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibodies (InVivoPlus anti-mouse PD-1 antibody, clone RMP1-14, Bio X Cell, #BE0146) were administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg on days 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. For CD8+T cell depletion studies, anti-CD8α antibodies (InVivoPlus, clone YTS 169.4, Bio X Cell, #BP0117) were used at 100 µg per dose, administered intraperitoneally once a week starting from day 2. CD8 depletion confirmation was done by blood collected from tails of mice 24 hours after the antibodies administration. Whole blood was stained using the: CD8-APC (1:400), CD3e-PE (1:100). The whole blood was incubated on ice, in the dark for 30 min. Then the red blood cells were lysed using ACK lysis buffer (Gibco, A1049201). The samples were washed with PBS and resuspended in flow cytometry buffer and analyzed via flow cytometry. Control groups in these studies received isotype control antibodies (InVivoPlus rat IgG2b isotype control, clone LTF-2, Bio X Cell, #BP0090). Group sizes varied depending on the study design, with each group comprising 6–12 animals. The group sizes were determined based on a retrospective analysis of optimization experiments to ensure a statistical power of at least 80% with an alpha level of 0.05. Tumor volumes were determined at least three times a week using caliper measurements and calculated using the formula: width×length×depth×π/6, assuming an ellipsoidal shape. Humane endpoints included a body weight loss exceeding 20%, tumor volumes exceeding 2,000 mm³ or persistent signs of pain or distress. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism V.10.1.1 (GraphPad Software, Boston, Massachusetts, USA) unless otherwise specified. Preliminary data processing, including organization and basic calculations, was conducted in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, USA) before statistical analysis. Data were analyzed for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test before applying parametric or non-parametric tests. For comparisons between two groups, either a Student’s t-test (for normally distributed data) or a Mann-Whitney U test (for non-normally distributed data) was used. For comparisons among multiple groups, one-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was applied when the data met the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances. Otherwise, a Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc test was used. For survival analyses, Kaplan-Meier curves were generated, and statistical significance was determined using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. The survival endpoint was defined as the time required for tumors to reach a volume of 2,000 mm³, in accordance with humane endpoint criteria. For flow cytometry data, statistical significance was determined by comparing median fluorescence intensity (MFI) or percentage of positive cells using the tests described above, depending on data distribution. For in vitro cytotoxicity assays and NFAT activation assays, dose-response curves were fitted using a four-parameter non-linear regression model, and IC₅₀ (the concentration that reduces enzyme activity by 50 percent)/EC₅₀ (half maximal effective concentration) values were determined accordingly. For all statistical comparisons, p values≤0.05 were considered significant, with the following notation used in figures: *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001. Results OAT-4828 activates antitumor immune response in a mouse melanoma model The development of OAT-4828, the USP7 inhibitor used in the current study, aimed to ensure allosteric binding of this compound to the USP7 pocket and optimal drug-like properties for oral use in in vivo models. The biochemical characterization revealed that OAT-4828 is a potent and selective USP7 inhibitor ( figure 1A online supplemental figure S1 figure 1B and C figure 1D figure 1E Figure 1 Characteristics of a novel and potent ubiquitin-specific protease 7 inhibitor. ( A B C D E F To determine the dosing for the in vivo experiments, a pharmacokinetic study was performed. The free (unbound) compound concentrations at 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg exceeded IC50 and IC90 (the concentration that reduces enzyme activity by 90 percent), respectively ( figure 1F figure 2A figure 2B online supplemental figure S3A figure 2C online supplemental figure S2A and B figure 2D figure 2E and F Figure 2 OAT-4828 prolongs survival of B16F10-bearing mice and boosts T-cell antitumor activity. ( A B C D E, F Treatment with OAT-4828 reshapes the tumor microenvironment and promotes the antitumor function of myeloid cell subpopulations Next, we analyzed the effects of OAT-4828 on the phenotype of myeloid cells, CD11c+ and CD11b+ subpopulations in B16F10-bearing mice ( figure 3A online supplemental figure S2C figure 3B and C 18 19 figure 3D online supplemental materials figure 3E and F ARG1 VEGFA PDL1 CHIL3 figure 3G Figure 3 Treatment with OAT-4828 favors antitumor response in the tumor microenvironment. ( A B C D E F G T cells are the main executors of the antitumor activity of OAT-4828 The antitumor potential of OAT-4828 was then evaluated in a CT-26 CRC model, demonstrating its effectiveness independently of a tumor type ( figure 4A and B online supplemental figure S3B figure 4C online supplemental figure S4 16 Figure 4 T Cells are crucial for OAT-4828 antitumor activity, which can be further improved by anti-PD-1 treatment. ( A B C D E F G H Having established that OAT-4828 modulates the phenotype of immune cells within TME, we decided to test the compound in a combination therapy approach. Notably, increased T-cell activity and IFN-γ secretion, observed in effective immunotherapies, are often associated with the elevated expression of PD-1/PD-L1. 20 figure 4D–F online supplemental figure S3C figure 4G and H online supplemental figure S3D Treatment with OAT-4828 boosts human T cells functions through the downregulation of MDM2 and increased NFATC2 activation Since the results from the mouse in vivo studies strongly suggested the role of T cells in the antitumor mechanism of action of OAT-4828, we decided to investigate the direct effects of this compound on human T cells. Noteworthy, MDM2 is a target for USP7, the inhibition of which results in MDM2 downregulation that may lead to an increase of NFAT expression. 21 23 24 figure 5A figure 5B and C figure 5D and E figure 5F Figure 5 OAT-4828 activates human T cells by increasing NFATC2 activity and MDM2 downregulation. ( A B C D E F OAT-4828 and MDM2 inhibitor exert distinct effects in an in vitro model of the human colorectal cancer microenvironment In order to mimic the complex interactions of human tumor-host microenvironment and to better predict clinical effects of OAT-4828, the compound was tested in four different concentrations (ranging from 0.3 to 8.1 µM) and compared with 10 µM nutlin-3 in the co-culture system (BioMAP Oncology system of CRC) ( figure 6 21 25 26 figure 6A and B Figure 6 Human co-culture experiments confirm OAT-4828 anticancer immunomodulatory potential, which is different from a control MDM2 inhibitor. ( A B C D In another type of co-cultures, which reflected the vascular component of TME (mimicked by human umbilical vein endothelial cells) of CRC, statistically significant differences were observed for CCL2/MCP-1, CD69, sgranzyme B, sIFN-γ and sIL-6. While both inhibitors, OAT-4828 and nutlin-3, reduced the level of CCL2 and increased the one of IFN-γ, the OAT-4828 appeared to be significantly more efficient inducer of granzyme B presence ( figure 6C and D Both OAT-4828 and nutlin-3 can affect immune cell function, yet the biological effect of the USP7 inhibitor in a modeled tumor-mediated immune suppression seems to be broader and indicates an additional anti-angiogenic effect. In conclusion, these findings align with prior experiments conducted on T cells and macrophages, underscoring an enhanced antitumor capability of immune cells following USP7 inhibition. Discussion Enhancing antitumor capabilities of the human immune system against cancer is one of the mainstays of current biomedical research in experimental and clinical oncology. Here, we demonstrate the significant anticancer efficacy of a novel compound, OAT-4828, in melanoma and colon cancer models. Observed activation of the immune system suggests that USP7 may function as an intracellular checkpoint contributing to immunosuppression. Most mechanistic experiments focused on the potential of a pharmacological USP7 inhibition to enhance T cell-mediated antitumor functions. Indeed, OAT-4828 augmented the T-cell activation by increasing the percentage of effector, CD69-positive cells. While in both CD4 and CD8 subpopulations, a substantial increase in IFN-γ production and a change in phenotype has been observed, the balance of T cells shifted, with CD8 cells becoming the dominant population. A similar increase in the percentage of CD8 T cells has been described previously highlighting the inhibitory effect of USP7 on T regulatory cell functions, 27 19 The list of substrates for USP7 is extensive and continues to expand. 28 29 30 15 16 31 32 33 34 The changes in phenotypes of both T and myeloid cells, caused by OAT-4828, are accompanied by MDM2 downregulation and p53 stabilization. While the role of the USP7-MDM2-p53 axis in tumor cells has been well established, 15 35 36 Previous studies have demonstrated that E3 ubiquitin ligases including the Cbl family, Cullin-Elongin BC-SOCS/VHL (CBC) proteins, and GRAIL play an important role in regulating both the activation and suppression of T cells. 37 31 23 38 24 39 40 41 42 43 45 Inhibitors targeting USP7 have shown promising results in preclinical studies, but up to date none of them has been approved for the clinical indication. 46 47 48 MDM2 inhibitors paved the way in the context of direct cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, while USP7 data builds on it by further exploring the mechanism of immune system activation in the context of cancer. Due to the substantial potential of USP7 inhibitors to synergize with immunotherapies and overcome resistance even in less immunogenic tumors, this combination treatment may provide a beneficial outcome for patients with cancer beyond those previously identified for MDM2 inhibitors. USP7 is involved in various cellular processes, and alongside the ongoing development of inhibitors, new substrates of this protein are continually being discovered, further confirming its role in tumor progression. 49 Supplementary material 10.1136/jitc-2025-012287 online supplemental file 1 Acknowledgements We would like to thank Zuzanna Sipak-Bujanowicz and Yevgeny Nikolaev for their involvement and support in in vivo efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies.
