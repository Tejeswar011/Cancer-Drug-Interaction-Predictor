Abstract Identifying the presence of tumors at a very early stage or deciphering the processes underlying their development can enable the interception of promalignant mechanisms underpinning cancer emergence, facilitating more effective prevention. Advances in molecular profiling allow the detection of genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microenvironmental alterations associated with cancer risk. Liquid biopsy permits noninvasive analysis of circulating tumor cells, nucleic acids, immune cells, extracellular vesicles, proteins, cytokines, and metabolites, whereas metagenome analysis facilitates gut microbiota profiling. Multicancer early detection assays broaden this approach, capturing signals from multiple malignancies using a single blood sample. These technologies go beyond genomics, addressing immune dysregulation and metabolic shifts, and may help identify gut microbiota imbalances. Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential is gaining increasing recognition as a biomarker. Cardiovascular risk scores based on multiple parameters are an inspiring example. The analysis of a combination of cancer drivers and enablers should provide a more sensitive and personalized measure of cancer prodromic profiles. Artificial intelligence will further support this transition by integrating molecular, immune, and metabolic data to develop individualized risk profiles. This shift from single-cancer detection to integrated, mechanism-based screening fosters a more proactive prevention model. This combination of early detection empowers cancer interception by using strategies, including lifestyle modification, nutritional optimization, drug repurposing, pharmacologic interventions, and targeted chemoprevention. Moving beyond single parameters analysis and organ-specific screening, this multidimensional approach advances early detection and interception as practical clinical goals, facilitating the fundamental aim of positioning prevention at the forefront of oncology. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Strategies to reduce cancer incidence and mortality include early detection paired with timely access to high-value preventive or interceptive treatments. Traditionally, early detection has focused on identifying (pre)cancerous lesions or early-stage cancers arising from defined organs, framed within population-based or individual risk–informed screening interventions ( 1 2 3 4 5 Cancer interception is an emerging approach aiming to prevent malignancy by identifying and targeting genetic, epigenetic, immune, and microenvironmental mechanisms that drive cancer initiation and progression in asymptomatic populations through lifestyle, pharmacologic, and biologic interventions ( 2 6 10 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 11 20 19 21 Figure 1. Pathways for cancer prevention, which include the interception of cancer drivers, allowing for the stopping of cancer development and supporting early diagnosis and early treatment. Identifying and Tackling the Mechanisms of Cancer through Early Detection and Interception The notion of cancer interception is based on the identification of carcinogenesis drivers and enablers, which form the basis of the pathologic mechanisms underlying cancer development ( 22 per se BRCA1 2 TP53 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 2 31 32 33 34 35 37 CHIP as a marker and driver of cancer An emerging marker and driver in cancer is CHIP. Hematologic malignancies are a key area of interest for early cancer interception, as they border an expanding list of “premalignant” conditions, such as (i) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, potentially evolving into multiple myeloma; (ii) monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis of undetermined significance, possibly evolving into chronic lymphocytic leukemia; and (iii) the newly defined entities of CHIP and CHIP-related clonal cytopenia of undetermined significance (CCUS). CHIP, in particular, is a condition characterized by the presence of somatic mutations in genes associated with myeloid hematologic malignancies at a variant allele fraction of at least 0.02 in the absence of other diagnostic criteria for hematologic malignancy or unexplained cytopenia ( 38 DNMT3A TET2 ASXL1 PPM1D TP53 SF3B1 SRSF2 39 41 40 44 44 45 Inflammatory cytokines as cancer enablers Inflammation plays a critical role in tumorigenesis, as observed by Virchow’s discovery of inflammatory cells within tumors ( 46 48 49 51 52 53 54 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 Immune cell imbalance and polarization Key components of immunity, such as NK cells, neutrophils, macrophages, B cells, and T cells, undergo functional changes within the tumor microenvironment, influencing tumor growth, immune evasion, and metastatic spread ( 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 58 85 86 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 Gut microbiome imbalance Recent research has highlighted the role of microbiota in inflammation, immune function, and cancer risk, emphasizing microbiota-based immune regulation as a potential avenue for cancer prevention ( 97 99 100 101 + 101 101 102 103 104 105 106 108 Lactobacillus fermentum Streptococcus anginosus Bacteroides stercoris 109 Bifidobacterium Firmicutes Saccharomyces 110 Akkermansia muciniphila 35 Table 1 Table 1.

Disruptions in the vaginal microbiota reduce hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid levels while increasing proinflammatory cytokines, raising the risk of persistent HPV infection and cervical cancer ( 111 Expanding the Horizons of Liquid Biopsy in Cancer toward Interception and Screening The most promising and advanced technique in the context of interception and screening is liquid biopsy, which tests bodily fluid, especially blood, to detect the presence of cancer cells. Liquid biopsy is minimally or noninvasive and is used to detect and monitor cancer-related products that are released into the bloodstream ( 112 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 114 124 Overall, liquid biopsy holds significant promise and is widely implemented although it still faces some technical challenges. Blood is the preferred medium for biomarker analysis due to its richness in ctDNA, CTCs, and miRNAs though it often carries a high background of nontumor DNA. Recovery rates vary and can be improved with techniques such as centrifugation and magnetic separation ( 125 126 127 21 Although the most common sample used in clinical practice is blood, other fluids may serve to uncover cancers. Urine sampling is used to detect urological cancer biomarkers. It offers the advantage of being minimally invasive; however, biomarker dilution and enzymatic degradation necessitate concentration and preservation techniques for accurate analysis ( 128 129 130 131 Multimomic integrated approaches Combining the analysis of several parameters could be a powerful strategy to increase the predictive value of tests by addressing key hallmarks of cancer ( 114 132 133 134 135 Liquid biopsy, using blood or saliva samples, is also used to detect CHIP, and recently, technologies are being developed to discriminate CHIP from other germinal or somatic tumor molecular signatures in circulating DNA using NGS ( 40 44 136 137 138 139 140 141 140 141 Although we may be used to perceiving liquid biopsy as informing on cancer biology alone, it is noteworthy that such a methodology can retrieve more data on the broader cancer milieu ( 142 per se 143 Liquid biopsy–based detection of inflammation and immune activation hallmarks to enable early cancer detection and interception Beyond its traditional role in identifying ctDNA, CTCs, and EVs, liquid biopsy is increasingly recognized for its potential to detect inflammatory cytokines and immune cells, which play a critical role in tumor initiation and progression ( 144 Although highly advanced tests for detecting early alterations in DNA and RNA are already available or under development to improve risk assessment and early cancer detection, the evaluation of inflammatory mediators in “healthy” individuals or at-risk populations, such as those with metabolic syndrome or obesity, has not been established as a standard approach for cancer prediction. The establishment of a reliable panel of cytokines for ELISA or other antibody-based assays correlated to risk conditions could be of invaluable help. On the path to combination early detection, in this study, we delve into reviewing some cytokines that have been associated with tumors and tumor progression and that might be useful in cancer early detection, screening, interception, and treatment ( Table 2 59 67 69 145 147 Table 2. Cytokines involved in cancer development and progression, which are of potential utility in cancer early detection, screening, interception, and treatment. Cytokine Function Role in cancer TNF-α Regulates cell death and proliferation and activates immune responses via MAPK, Akt, and NF-κB pathways Plays a dual role: promotes tumor survival and induces apoptosis ( 59 IL-31 Induces inflammation  Plays a dual role: contributing to either the promotion or suppression of cancer ( 61 Induces pruritus associated with cancer ( 61 Elevated levels of endometrial carcinoma ( 62 IL-1β Acts as a key mediator of inflammation and immune responses Induces inflammation-related carcinogenesis, particularly in lung cancer ( 145 IL-6 Contributes to host immune defense and acute stress response  Elevated in patients with cancer ( 65 Supports the malignant phenotype ( 66 IL-8 (chemokine) Involves in neutrophil recruitment Elevated levels linked to lung cancer risk and tumor progression ( 146 IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) Modulates immune homeostasis Contributes to immune suppression in tumors ( 69 TGF-β Regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses Promotes tumor progression by inducing extracellular matrix remodeling and metastasis ( 60 IL-17 Induces inflammation Associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer ( 63 IL-23 Induces inflammation Elevated in colorectal cancer, influences Treg-mediated immune suppression ( 67 IL-15 Stimulates T-cell and NK cell proliferation Contributes to cancer immunity benefits ( 64 MCP-1 Recruits monocytes and macrophages Promotes tumor-associated inflammation and immune suppression ( 147 Proinflammatory cytokines have been implicated as promoters of carcinogenesis in individuals exposed to environmental particulate matter measuring ≤2.5 μm, which promotes lung cancer by acting on cells that harbor preexisting oncogenic mutations in healthy lung tissue. Notably, IL-1β has been identified as a key mediator of lung inflammation induced by particulate matter measuring ≤2.5 μm, promoting a progenitor-like cell state in EGFR 145 148 146 149 147 150 151 Cancer per se 152 96 + + + 153 + 154 155 156 + 67 Immune senescence Capturing the immune status may inform the individual risk of cancer, whereas developing cancer immune profiles under certain risk factor conditions may help dissect the individual risk of cancer and orient risk-reducing strategies. Aging contributes to changes in the phenotype and activity of macrophages in the continuum of immune dysfunction, age, and cancer risk. Senescent macrophages, as well as senescent fibroblasts, interact with other cells in the tumor microenvironment and secrete senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors. These molecules may promote tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis or, conversely, exert antitumor effects ( 157 158 159 160 161 + 162 163 164 + 164 Hence, in the future, integrating the analysis of inflammatory cytokines, immune cells, and other tumor markers into liquid biopsy–based screening and prevention strategies holds great potential for advancing precision oncology by enabling interception or earlier, more accurate cancer detection and personalized risk stratification. Furthermore, real-time monitoring of these markers may support treatment response assessment and disease progression tracking. Cancer Interception Strategies: From Vaccination to Microbiome Modulation Cancer interception encompasses proactive strategies aimed at halting tumorigenesis at its earliest stages. Vaccination against oncogenic viruses and tumor-specific antigens has demonstrated the feasibility of priming durable immune responses before malignant progression. Complementing this, immune modulation through anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin and NSAIDs and immune checkpoint inhibitors targets key tumor-promoting pathways. Also, interventions aimed at restoring microbial balance and reducing cancer risk seem promising. Together, these approaches offer a multifaceted framework for intercepting cancer before clinical onset. Cancer interception via vaccination aims to halt tumorigenesis at premalignant or early stages by priming the immune system against tumor-associated or mutation-derived antigens. Approved vaccines for oncogenic viruses, such as HPV and hepatitis B virus, demonstrate the power of immunoprevention. Vaccines targeting antigens, such as MUC1 KRAS BRCA 165 166 Cancer immune interception is an emerging strategy that aims to prevent invasive cancers by targeting premalignant lesions before immune evasion fully develops. This approach makes use of immune-based interventions, such as prophylactic vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and immunomodulators, to eliminate early neoplastic changes. It is particularly effective in high-risk individuals such as those with hereditary syndromes or identifiable premalignancies. By acting during the window when antitumor immunity remains functional, immune interception offers a proactive approach to reducing cancer burden through early immune engagement and durable immune memory ( 165 Emerging evidence highlights the role of gut microbiota in colorectal cancer interception, beyond early detection. Microbiome profiling has demonstrated potential in identifying precancerous lesions and improving noninvasive diagnostic tools, complementing traditional methods such as fecal occult blood testing ( 163 Fusobacterium nucleatum 167 168 168 169 170 171 With a refined understanding of the role of microbes in tumorigenesis, cancer interception strategies will increasingly focus on effective diagnostic and therapeutic options, mirroring past successes, such as those targeting HPV-related cervical cancer with a preventive vaccine. Moreover, the combination of microbiome modulation and immune-based interventions would offer additional opportunities to halt or even reverse premalignant changes. Building an Oncological Risk Score: Translating Combination Detection from Cardiology Cardiovascular diseases, together with cancer, remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines encourage the use of risk prediction models to enhance the effective management of cardiovascular risk factors and the promotion of healthy behaviors. The European Society of Cardiology has developed and regularly updates the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation risk estimation system. In addition to conventional risk factors, emerging ones should be considered and incorporated into a tailored approach to risk stratification ( 4 5 Fig. 2 Figure 2. Host-related factors and environmental exposures that may contribute to cancer risk and progression. (Created with BioRender.com https://app.biorender.com/illustrations/684a69369ed7ecf3d531cde2 Interception activities can be incremental with risk, based initially on lifestyle changes: smoking cessation; healthy eating habits; dietary interventions; implementation of physical activity; repurposed drugs, such as aspirin, metformin, and antidiabetic drugs; and therapeutic prophylaxis, as shown in Table 3 Table 3. Potential prevention and interception strategies. Prevention Interception Do not smoke Quit smoking Avoid alcohol consumption Quit alcohol consumption Avoid carcinogens Improve environment, decrease exposure Have a healthy diet Change dietary habits Keep a healthy microbiome ( 167 171 Get probiotics ( 167 Exert physical activity Increase physical activity Do regular screening Repeat prescribed exams Carcinogenesis enablers detection for risk assessment  Dietary supplements Aspirin and anti-inflammatory, metformin and antidiabetics ( 165 Chemoprevention with natural, synthetic, or biological agents ( 165 170 Advances in Multicancer Detection Tests: Integrating Molecular Hallmarks for Early, Noninvasive Cancer Screening Many of the limitations of the current approaches to screening and many of the liquid biopsy–based assays in development are that they are intended to detect a single cancer type. Multicancer detection tests (MCDT) are now being developed to identify, through a single assay, the presence of a cancer signal that may originate from one of several possible cancer types ( 172 173 174 175 176 The complementary use of MCDTs in screening programs could facilitate the simultaneous evaluation of the very initial phases of many different cancers and potentially enable earlier detection of clinically significant tumors in individuals without known risk factors or overt symptoms ( 112 177 174 178 181 182 187 112 Table 4 188 190 191 188 192 193 194 Table 4.

This may compromise its value as a screening tool aimed at early detection, in which curative interventions are most effective. Also, despite its high specificity and low reported false-positive rate (0.5%), the low positive predictive value (PPV) and downstream consequences of false positives, such as costly and potentially harmful diagnostic investigations, pose a significant burden on the healthcare system. The absence of robust longitudinal data and reliance on surrogate endpoints such as stage shift rather than mortality reduction in the evaluation of the test also represents a concern, as this approach diverges from the established UK National Screening Committee framework for adopting screening programs. These issues, combined with political and commercial influences and the lack of clear evidence for cancer-specific mortality benefits, likely contributed to the suspension of widespread rollout ( 195 Based on the DETECT-A study, CancerSEEK, a blood-based MCED test, demonstrated the ability to identify early-stage cancers, including types lacking standard-of-care screening options. Of the 26 participants with cancers first detected by CancerSEEK, 50% were alive and cancer-free at a median follow-up of 4.4 years. All patients with stage I or II cancers who received treatment remained cancer-free, highlighting the potential clinical benefit of early detection. Notably, seven of the cancer-free survivors had malignancies for which no screening programs currently exist. These results suggest that CancerSEEK may support curative interventions through earlier diagnosis although larger randomized trials are required to confirm its population-level impact and long-term benefits ( 196 Adela by Adela Bio detects cfDNA and screens for lung, colorectal, breast, pancreas, bladder, and kidney cancers, as well as certain types of leukemia. Tr(ACE) by Biological Dynamics targets exosome proteins, exploiting AI, and screens for pancreas, ovarian, and bladder cancers. The VPAC receptor TP4303 by Thomas Jefferson University/Intermountain Health employs near-IR optical microscopy and screens for lung, breast, prostate, head and neck, and uterine cancers. ARTEMIS is a genome-wide approach for analyzing repeat landscapes. Delphi (Delphi Diagnostics) utilizes a learning machine algorithm to target cfDNA. Changes in repeat landscapes are detected to monitor cancer development and identify the tissue of origin of tumors. Individual repeat landscapes can also be used in machine learning to generate a disease-predicting and characterizing score ( Table 4 197 198 199 PanSeer is a noninvasive blood test that detects cancer based on ctDNA methylation. The Taizhou Longitudinal Study identified cancer in 95% of asymptomatic individuals who were later diagnosed within 4 years and in 88% of postdiagnosis patients, with a specificity of 96%. These results suggest that PanSeer can detect stomach, esophageal, colorectal, lung, and liver cancers up to 4 years before standard diagnosis, highlighting its potential for early cancer screening. However, further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm its clinical utility ( 200 The utility of MCDTs in clinical practice is supported by modeling studies ( 201 201 202 194 203 205 206 207 202 208 AI and Computational Advances in Cancer Detection AI plays a crucial role in cancer risk prediction, early detection, and diagnostic accuracy by integrating routinely collected and analyzed patient clinical, multiomics, and imaging data ( 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 AI is set to transform cancer risk prediction, early detection, and diagnostics by integrating key driver and enablers, including multiomics and imaging data, thereby enhancing biomarker discovery, screening and personalized care. Tools such as Lung-CLiP and natural language processing improve ctDNA analysis and electronic health record data mining though challenges such as bias, overdiagnosis, and model standardization remain, requiring AI to complement, not replace, clinical expertise. Refining AI models to balance sensitivity and specificity is essential for meaningful cancer screening while minimizing unnecessary interventions. Future research should explore AI’s potential in integrating multiomics, proteomics, inflammation, and microbiome data; making our suggestion of combination early detection more feasible; refining early cancer interception strategies; and optimizing risk assessment algorithms to improve patient outcomes. Cancer-Associated Polygenic Risk Scores Several novel strategies are currently being implemented to identify asymptomatic, apparently healthy people at risk who are more likely to benefit from MCED tools. A modeling analysis recently investigated the utility of current, future, and optimized polygenic risk scores (PRS), which are based on the evaluation of thousands of SNPs in UK cancer screening programs ( 219 The next step will involve leveraging these signatures, AI, and machine learning to identify changes associated with the escape of nascent cancer cells from the immune system’s coordination in high-risk, healthy individuals. Conclusions Assessing the complexity of genetic and nongenetic factors in cancer development can be effectively done through blood-based methodologies, particularly liquid biopsy, and through metagenome analysis to determine microbiota imbalances. Monitoring these factors may help develop advanced risk assessment algorithms and treatment targets. Each impaired mechanism could serve as both a diagnostic tool and a target for specific interventions. Cancer can no longer be viewed as an inevitable event but as a preventable consequence of identifiable and interceptable biological processes. Liquid biopsy provides a noninvasive means to detect not only CTCs and tumor-derived nucleic acids but also circulating immune cells, EVs, proteins, and metabolites. Beyond genomic and proteomic alterations, evidence suggests the advantage of evaluating systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. Gut microbiota imbalances are increasingly considered to be implicated in cancer progression and treatment resistance. Advances in liquid biopsy, multiomics, and combined detection of drivers and enablers, with the help of AI-driven analytics, offer unprecedented opportunities to detect transformative signals early, stratify risk, and intervene before malignancy emerges. Multicancer detection assays expand this approach beyond the one-site/one-modality paradigm, identifying cancer-related signals from a broader spectrum of malignancies from a single sample of blood. The future of oncology lies not only in early diagnosis but also in prediagnostic interception, transforming population screening from tumor detection to risk prediction ( 220 221 188 190 Data availability Data sharing is not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analyzed during the current study.
