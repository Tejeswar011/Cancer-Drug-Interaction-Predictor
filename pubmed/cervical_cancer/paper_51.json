The distal third of the esophagus and the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) are mostly involved sites. The diagnosis and therapeutic management of early, locally advanced, and metastatic disease continue to present uncertainties, as existing guidelines may not fully address all clinical questions in these areas. Methods A group of Italian Experts produced recommendations for early, locally advanced, and metastatic disease management using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Statements were generated by a systematic revision of the literature and voted on twice by a panel of 29 expert physicians; the second vote took place during a meeting of the panelists. Results Several topics covered diagnosis, staging, treatment, and early, localized, and metastatic disease management. Recommendations were stated. Conclusions Interventions considered appropriate to improve compliance and outcomes of esophageal/GEJ cancer patients were identified.

Introduction Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common cancer, with more than 0.6 million new cases and 0.54 million deaths worldwide in 2020 [ 1 2 2 The high mortality rate of a relatively rare cancer, such as esophageal cancer, makes it necessary to increase efforts for primary prevention, regarding the main risk factors as smoking, alcohol, obesity, and gastroesophageal reflux [ 2–4 5 Multidisciplinary evaluation consisting of dedicated personnel (esophageal oncology surgeon, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, endoscopist, anatomic pathologist, nutritionist) is necessary to offer a common diagnostic and therapeutic approach aiming to improve the quality of cure [ 6 Accurate staging with digestive endoscopy and multiple biopsy sockets, ultrasonography of supra-lateral cervical lymph node stations, Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) of the upper digestive tract, total-body CT scan, PET/CT (FDG), and possible bronchoscopy in specific cases is suggested [ 7–11 12 13 The treatment of esophageal cancer was diversified in the two main histotypes for several years, both in the early stages and, especially, in locally advanced and metastatic stages. Endoscopic en-bloc resection, using either endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection, is the treatment of choice for lesions with intra-epithelial high-grade dysplasia and most T1 tumors [ 14 15 16 For locally advanced resectable disease (cT2-T4 or cN1–3 M0) surgery is still the backbone with curative intent for both histologies. However, definitive chemoradiation (CRT) followed by surveillance and salvage esophagectomy is also an option, even in upfront resectable cases of esophageal SCC [ 17–24 20 25 26 22 27 For advanced disease, first-line chemotherapy with platinum derivatives and fluoropyrimidine is the standard of choice [ 28 29 30 In the second and subsequent lines of treatment for advanced esophageal SCC, nivolumab demonstrated a benefit for esophageal SCC after platinum and fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy, whereas pembrolizumab may be an option for patients who have not received first-line treatment with ICIs and have PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10 [ 31 32 33–35 Due to the lack of definitive evidence from clinical trials, many areas of uncertainty are raised, particularly for populations with borderline clinical cases not discussed within the national and international guidelines. For this purpose, this article was conceived to suggest diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for these complex clinical scenarios. A group of Italian experts (oncologist, radiologist, radiotherapist, surgeons, pathologist, nutritionist) met in Milan in October 2023 and proposed recommendations with a multidisciplinary approach about the appropriateness of interventions in early, locally advanced, and metastatic esophageal/GEJ tumor patients based on the scientifically validated RAND Corporation/UCLA Method [ 36 This project was supported by the professionals at the Federation of Italian Cooperative Oncology Groups (FICOG). 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Consensus method The RAND/UCLA Method [ 36 Specifically, the RAND/UCLA method was thought to be used to define the appropriateness of pharmacological interventions in early, locally advanced, and metastatic esophageal and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) tumors. The Scientific Committee, based on the available Literature, defined the factors that needed to be taken into account to assess whether or not a certain procedure was appropriate and created several “clinical scenarios” that needed discussion. These scenarios were submitted to the expert panel, which interactively evaluated their risk-benefit ratio in two separate rounds. For this purpose, a scale of values from 1 to 9 divided into 3 ranges was used for the voting; 1–3 values corresponded to “inappropriate,” 4–6 to “uncertain,” and 7–9 to “appropriate,” respectively. No funder was involved in the study concept/design, participation in the steering committee, or conducting the consensus process. 2.2. Clinical scenarios Sixty-seven scenarios most frequently encountered in clinical practice were identified and organized into five groups [ 1 2 3 4 5 2.3. Scientific committee Experts from different disciplines were involved: four oncologists, one anatomic pathologist, one surgeon, one nutritionist, and one radiation oncologist promoted the entire initiative and proposed scenarios, as well as participated in the Expert Opinion Meeting in the role of chairperson. The Committee was assisted and supported by the coauthor, AD, designated by the Scientific Committee itself, to draft this manuscript. 2.4. Expert opinion meeting A total of 21 medical specialists (2 anatomic pathologists, 1 surgeon, 1 nutritionist, 13 oncologists, and 4 radiation oncologists) with expertise in the management of esophageal/GEJ cancer patients, as well as the Scientific Committee, were involved in the Expert Opinion Meeting to evaluate the appropriateness of the scenarios. 2.5. First-round ratings From July to September 2023, the Scientific Committee and Expert Opinion Panel, without discussion with each other, individually evaluated the appropriateness of each scenario, within a first round of online valuation by a dedicated web platform. 2.6. Second-round ratings The second round of voting was conducted through an in-person Expert Opinion meeting on 30 October 2023, involving the Scientific Committee and the Expert Opinion Panel. According to a precise agenda, different topics were discussed: three on the diagnosis and staging, treatment part 1, and treatment part 2, consisting of a general introduction of the available data literature. Later, a discussion and voting session took place to gather opinions on the appropriateness of each scenario through an anonymous system by all present using a computerized workstation. 2.7. Analysis An overall evaluation of the results obtained in the Expert Opinion meeting was carried out on 18 December 2023. The proposed interventions for each scenario were judged as appropriate for median ratings 7–9 (no disagreement), not appropriate for median ratings 1–3 (no disagreement), and uncertain for median ratings 4–6 or when panel members disagreed. Agreement was considered to have been reached when >2/3 of the ratings were in the range containing the median; whereas the rating was considered to have been expressed with disagreement when ≥1/3 of the ratings were not in the same range. Dedicated proprietary software developed by the organizational partner was specifically designed for conducting RAND projects, used for collecting and processing individual votes in both the first online round and the subsequent in-person second round. The software is named: online platform RAND-1™ and the interactive suite RTR! – real-time RAND suite™. The online platform RAND-1™ is a comprehensive tool that enables the administration of RAND questionnaires and automatically generates results for the proposed scenarios. It was used during the first (individual) round of the project. The interactive suite RTR! – real-time RAND suite™ was used during the in-person meeting and integrates a complete system for administering the questionnaire via smart devices and a projection system, voting via smart devices, and real-time generation of results. Both software tools output the following variables: Mean, Median, Deviation, Dispersion, and Results. 2.8. Selected literature The coauthor, AD, searched MEDLINE PubMed and Trip Database for English-language articles published evaluating any stages (I-IV) esophageal/GEJ cancer regardless of histology. Each participant of the Scientific Committee received a systematic review of available literature that carefully described the current management of esophageal/GEJ cancers. Subsequently, the participants consulted and formulated the questions for the survey. The selection included: a) randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials; b) systematic and editorial reviews; c) guidelines from scientific societies; and d) available data on drugs tested in phase III trials. 2.9. Introductory survey The Scientific Committee promoted a prodromal survey for the two rounds to understand the “state of the art” in Italian cancer centers engaged in the treatment of esophageal/GEJ cancer; the survey consisted of 16 questions. Any piloting of the study materials and/or survey instruments was performed. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Recommendations for the diagnosis and staging of esophageal/GEJ tumors Seventeen clinical scenarios concerning the following diagnosis and staging of esophageal/GEJ cancer patients were submitted for the expert’s judgment. Consensus on appropriateness was reached for 11 scenarios. In the remaining 6 scenarios, uncertainty was prevalent in 4, and in 2, inappropriateness was reported ( Table 1 Table 1.

Is it appropriate to start active oncological treatment without a nutritional program? 3,62 3 2,28 11 Uncertain Clinical staging of esophageal cancer should be carried out with higher accuracy to make therapeutic decisions. Staging should include clinical examination and instrumental assessment (e.g., endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) scan); in some cases, a positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) could be performed [ 7–10 For proper staging of tumor (T) and lymph nodes (N), the endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is worth, especially for determining, i) T4b status with invasion toward the airways, pericardium, or aorta, and (ii) detection and biopsy of suspected positive lymph node outside the radiation field or beyond the planned resection boundaries. In T1 tumors, the resection offers more accurate staging and therapeutic benefits. The assessment of tumor growth toward central airways should include bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasonography [ 11 Both esophageal and gastric cancer spread to the peritoneum, and accurate preoperative staging is pivotal to avoid the considerable morbidity and mortality associated with unnecessary attempts at curative resection. Given that peritoneal carcinomatosis can be undetectable on preoperative cross-sectional imaging in up to 40% of cases, staging laparoscopy has become conventional in the preoperative staging pathway for these tumors [ 37 Diagnosis should be based on endoscopic biopsies, with the histological tumor type classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria [ 7 28 38 As per national and international guidelines, molecular pathology is crucial. The biomarkers essential for treatment selection are programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemical (IHC) staining expression and microsatellite instability [ 39–41 30 42 32 29 Further investigation into mechanisms that manage the immune landscape of esophageal SCC/GEJ tumors could provide valuable insights. Furthermore, exploring biomarkers beyond PD-L1 and MSI-H/dMMR, such as tumor mutational burden or other immune-related markers, may also support the selection of patients for ICIs. Instead, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/deficient mismatch repair (MMR) is strongly predictive of immunotherapy benefits, in both locally advanced and metastatic stages, regardless of the line of therapy. The incidence of MSI-H/dMMR differs by histology. It is detected in up to 8% of patients with metastatic gastric cancer but is rarely seen in esophageal SCC [ 41 An additional topic of discussion was the use of the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approach [ 43 In most patients (>50%) candidates for esophagectomy, a decrease in weight of more than 5% is described and associated with an increased operative risk, impairs the patient’s quality of life (QoL), and poor survival in advanced disease. At diagnosis, malnutrition status is linked to a poorer response to systemic chemotherapy, which impacts the likelihood of patients undergoing resection with curative intent [ 44 45 46 47 12 48 To summarize, the Italian Expert’s recommendations for the diagnosis and staging of esophageal/GEJ tumor patients are as follows: CT scan and FDG-PET imaging are necessary in all patients with esophageal/gastroesophageal junction cancer. Echo endoscopy should be performed in all patients with clinically negative lymph nodes (cN0) disease and selected clinically lymph node-positive (cN+) cases. Laparoscopy should be done in selected cases to exclude peritoneal carcinomatosis. PD-L1 and microsatellite status should be assessed in all patients before choosing a treatment strategy, while NGS testing is not indicated. Esophageal stent for dysphagia should be placed only after discussing the case with a multidisciplinary team. 3.2. Recommendations for treatment in esophageal/GEJ tumors Five clinical scenarios concerning the treatment of esophageal/GEJ cancer patients were submitted for expert judgment. Consensus on appropriateness was not reached for any scenarios; instead, in four scenarios, inappropriateness and in the last one, uncertainty was voted ( Table 2 Table 2. Clinical scenarios of treatment in esophageal/GEJ tumors management.  Mean Median Deviation Dispersion Results 1. Is it appropriate to start active oncology treatment in early GE cancer patients (cT1a/b N0) without evaluation by the multidisciplinary team? 1,83 1 0,83 3 Inappropriate 2. Is it appropriate to start active oncology treatment in advanced/metastatic GE cancer patients (each T, each N, M1) without evaluation by the multidisciplinary team? 2,97 2 1,93 9 Inappropriate 3. Is it appropriate to start active cancer treatment at any stage of the disease beyond 30 days after histological diagnosis? 2,07 1 1,07 4 Inappropriate 4. Is it appropriate to the start oncological/surgical/radiotherapeutic treatment without establishing a nutritional program? 2 1 1 3 Inappropriate 5. Is it appropriate to the start oncological/surgical/radiotherapeutic treatment without a psycho-oncological assessment? 5 5 1,66 15 Uncertain Most scenarios were formulated to focus on the multidisciplinary management of early, locally advanced, or metastatic patients. All experts agreed to discuss with a multidisciplinary team each case before proposing upfront strategies to provide more treatment options for these patients. The multidisciplinary team meets the standards of efficiency if at least key figures such as a surgeon, oncologist, radiologist, endoscopist, radiation oncologist, and anatomopathologist must be present. Considering the recent national and international guidelines, it is also suitable to have a nutritionist, psycho-oncologist, case manager, and research nurse to manage the patient’s journey from diagnosis to treatment. Although these figures are not widely distributed in the cancer center, so unlikely to find them at each multidisciplinary meeting, it is strongly recommended to include them. As previously mentioned, evaluating a nutritional program, intended as an assessment, and taking charge by the nutritionist is essential before systemic therapy, radiation therapy, or surgery [ 12 49 Despite recognizing the value of psycho-oncological support before, during, and after the treatment in these patients, regardless of the setting, the experts did not reach a consensus due to the lack of resources and often the patient’s acceptance of this care. However, we should raise awareness and improve these professional figures in our hospitals. To summarize, the Italian Expert’s recommendations for the treatment of esophageal/GEJ tumor patients are as follows: A multidisciplinary team composed of different professional figures (oncologist, radiologist, radiation oncologist, surgeons, gastroenterologist, pathologist, etc.) is necessary, and each patient with early, locally advanced, and metastatic disease should be discussed. The nutritionist’s engagement and assessment should occur before starting, during, and after any treatment (systemic therapy, radiation, or surgery) administered. Advisable psycho-oncology evaluation given the impact on the quality of life of the patient, especially in those who have psycho-social frailties, might be considered. 3.3. Recommendations for management in early esophageal/GEJ tumors Six clinical scenarios concerning the management of early esophageal/GEJ tumors were submitted for expert judgment. A consensus on appropriateness was reached in two scenarios. In the remaining four scenarios, a condition of inappropriateness was prevalent in 3, and one scenario was uncertain ( Table 3 Table 3. Clinical scenarios of early esophageal/GEJ tumors management.  Mean Median Deviation Dispersion Results 1. Is it appropriate to refer T1a/T1b stage patients to high-volume endoscopic centers? 8,34 9 0,66 2 Appropriate 2. Is it appropriate for the histologic report of an endoscopic specimen not to include among the parameters: lateral and deep margins, depth of infiltration grade, grading, and vascular infiltration? 1,21 1 0,21 0 Inappropriate 3. Is it appropriate to request a second pathological opinion at high-volume centers, in the absence or incomplete of the parameters previously considered? 7,28 8 1,62 7 Appropriate 4. Is it appropriate “piecemeal approach” excision of early-stage lesions? 2,90 2 1,79 8 Inappropriate 5. Is it appropriate only endoscopic follow-up of early-stage lesions after exclusive local treatment appropriate? 4,83 5 2,17 21 Uncertain 6. Is it appropriate laser treatment of early-stage lesions? 2,07 1 1,07 5 Inappropriate Early clinical tumors (cT1N0M0) include those limited to mucosa (T1a) and those extending beyond the muscularis mucosa and into the submucosa (T1b) without deeper invasion into the muscularis propria. Curative surgical management of esophageal tumors aims to achieve an R0 resection. Specifically, endoscopic resection is reserved for T1a cancer patients without any high-risk features (poorly differentiated histology, lymph vascular invasion (LVI), and/or positive deep margin after resection). Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) are used for intraepithelial high-grade dysplasia and most T1 tumors [ 14 15 50 Considering the complexity of such interventions, the diagnostic part is of paramount importance before performing these endoscopic approaches. Therefore, experts are assertive in referring these cases to high-volume endoscopic centers with high experience and good diagnostic and endoscopy facilities. A crucial point for staging is the accurate specimen assessment, which needs to take into account different features. T1b tumors can result in up to 45% of positive lymph nodes, although the strongest risk factors for N-positive are histology (mostly in SCC), depth of invasion (i.e., deep intramucosal T1a tumors), LVI, lower differentiation grade, ulceration, and tumor size larger than 2 cm. These cases should be suggested to prompt multidisciplinary discussion to evaluate further surgical resection with esophagectomy and appropriate lymphadenectomy [ 51 51 52 Given that there is uncertainty about performing endoscopic follow-up alone in early disease, it is important to consider that the early disease, including both T1a and T1b, does not have the same prognosis and therapeutic advances. According to experts, T1b should receive a major surgical approach and not only an endoscopic follow-up. In addition, as mentioned above, histology also affects the different approaches since SCCs that have a greater tendency for lymphatic spread should require different actions and subsequent follow-up. Given the extreme importance of an optimal endoscopic and/or surgical approach in this setting, experts discussed the need to refer these patients to high-volume centers. Noteworthy endoscopic expertise is needed. To better define which centers are high-volume, we suggest referring to the gastroenterology/endoscopy guidelines. In this regard, experts almost unanimously voted for the appropriateness of sending patients to high-volume centers to impact their prognosis. In this setting, it is noteworthy that the histologic reporting of an endoscopic resection cannot miss including some parameters such as lateral and deep margins, infiltration grade depth, grading, and vascular infiltration. Following the panel discussion, it is inappropriate for these parameters not to be reported after a resection. If the report is incomplete or absent of the above-mentioned features, a second anatomopathological opinion should be done as suggested by panelists. To summarize, the Italian Expert’s recommendations for the management of early disease are as follows: Early disease management should be entrusted to High-Volume Centers with great experience according to the criteria of endoscopic/gastroenterological guidelines. To perform a good endoscopic resection, it is necessary to have a high-performing endoscopy. Pathological reporting after endoscopic resection should include well-defined parameters; in the absence of these, a second opinion should be sought in High-Volume Centers. In early disease, “piecemeal” and laser approaches should not be considered. Endoscopic follow-up alone can be done only in early T1a disease. 3.4. Recommendations for management in locally advanced esophageal/GEJ tumors Twenty-six clinical scenarios concerning the management of locally advanced esophageal/GEJ cancer patients were submitted for expert judgment. A consensus on appropriateness was reached in most cases (19 scenarios). In five scenarios, a condition of uncertainty was recorded, while in two cases, the inappropriateness was documented ( Table 4 Table 4.

Is it appropriate to start domiciliary enteral nutritional support after placement of jejunostomy in the patient with recognized nutritional risk? 8,41 9 0,59 2 Appropriate In locally advanced resectable esophageal cancer (cT2-T4a or cN1–3), regardless of the histology, the surgery remains the backbone of curative-intent treatment. A definitive chemoradiation with surveillance and subsequent salvage esophagectomy is also an option in SCC esophageal cancers. As suggested in the ESMO guidelines [ 28 25 26 53–59 Upfront surgery alone in selected cases (by grading and extent) of cT2 N0 AC tumors could be done after discussion in the multidisciplinary team and well-defined T2 staging. On this topic, experts have defined the appropriateness of the intervention. In contrast, in cT3 lymph nodes, positive tumors upfront surgery is inappropriate. Pre- and perioperative treatment using chemotherapy or chemoradiation (CRT) has been shown to increase resection with no tumor at the margin (R0) and survival rates in esophageal cancer. Based on these results, CRT followed by surgery in esophageal cancer is a standard of care for SCC of the esophagus [ 16–19 23 25–27 60–62 62 The caveat to this recommendation is for cT2 N0 tumors, for which there is controversy regarding preoperative treatment. Each case should be discussed by the multidisciplinary team with careful consideration of the potential risks and benefits. In this context, upfront CRT followed by surveillance in frailty patients with complete clinical response cT2 N0 SCC was discussed. The experts argued for appropriateness in favor of CRT by carefully considering which patients to exclude from surgery and choosing the cancer center with experience managing even frail patients through prompt simultaneous care and with great expertise in radiotherapy management. As emerged in clinical studies, 40–50 Gy is the standard dose of radiation considered with neoadjuvant intent, avoiding dose escalation outside of controlled clinical trials [ 63 64 65 66 One of the most debated topics was the choice of therapeutic strategies after CRT treatment, depending on the disease response. Several scenarios were considered: Surgery after an incomplete disease response resulting from CRT. Regarding this issue, the panel thought it was appropriate to propose surgery. The watch-and-wait approach in SCC with clinical complete response (cCR) after CRT. In this case, there was uncertainty in indicating appropriateness because the literature data are not solid. However, even in the ESMO guidelines, this possibility is at the judgment of the clinician. Performing a proper assessment of the cCR is crucial, and, in 30–35% of cCR cases on the surgical sample, residual tumor cells can be found. Although watch-and-wait remains a possibility for these patients, the panel recommends that this approach should be carefully evaluated for individual cases only in a center with expertise, along with a good clinical-instrumental follow and careful staging of the disease. The watch-and-wait approach in AC tumor patients with cCR response after CRT treatment. Compared to SCC for AC tumors, experts agreed that the intervention is inappropriate because there are no clinical studies to support, and even the ESMO guidelines do not recommend it. Adjuvant treatment in clinical lymph node-positive patients with complete pathological response (pCR) after neoadjuvant CRT. This is a greater gray area of uncertainty because to date, there are no clinical trials that provide answers, and it is carried out based on the center’s preferred practice. However, this is rarely performed in Italian centers. Adjuvant treatment in clinical lymph node-positive (cN+) patients with incomplete pathological response after neoadjuvant CRT. For this scenario, experts agreed on the appropriateness of the intervention. This approach is supported by the Checkmate 577 study, the first trial that showed a benefit in terms of disease-free survival of adjuvant anti-PD1 antibody, nivolumab, compared to placebo (22.4 vs 11 months) in patients with localized esophageal or GEJ cancer. Adjuvant treatment in the pathological lymph node-positive (pN+) patients who have not undergone CRT. Although experts voted as appropriate for such intervention, there was much discussion about it for several reasons: i) suitable neoadjuvant treatment was possibly not discussed in the multidisciplinary team; ii) there was inappropriate presurgical staging; iii) in 30% of cases, tumors with cT2N0 are undergoing upfront surgery. In all these cases, if the lymph nodes are positive, we consider adjuvant systemic treatment. For non-radical surgery (R1), we can consider radiotherapy as an adjuvant strategy. To evaluate re-irradiation in local recurrence disease after CRT and complete disease response, in selected cases (e.g., patient not suitable for surgery or refused it). A key point is to assess the time to recurrence since the first radiation treatment. If the time exceeds 12 months, this approach is viable with acceptable toxicities. Usually, standard fractionation is done, but studies of hyper-fractionation/stereotaxis as it creates less toxicity without having to reduce doses. It is considered, not ruled out a priori, but the radiotherapist must be experienced. Surgery in the patient with local recurrence after CRT and complete disease response. There is no doubt about this scenario; it is an appropriate option to propose. Lastly, the five scenarios discussed by the experts found high agreement on the appropriateness of the intervention as follows: quarterly instrumental clinical follow-up in the first 18 months in patients with a complete response; 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy with neoadjuvant intent as a definitive CRT strategy; pre-operative immune-nutrition program and a post-operative nutrition counseling program; after placement of a jejunostomy introduces enteral nutritional support at home in the patient with recognized nutritional risk. To summarize, the Italian Expert’s recommendations for the management of locally advanced diseases are as follows: A multidisciplinary assessment to plan any treatment strategy is mandatory. Well-staged cT2 N0 tumors can be proposed for surgery. Lymphadenectomy must be part of the surgical criteria. For thoracic esophageal tumors with clinical stage cT2 N0, upfront radiotherapy is used. Salvage surgery after an incomplete disease response is an option. Standard radiotherapy treatment should include a dose of 40–50 Gy. Dose escalation of radiation should only be considered within clinical trials. The watch-and-wait approach in AC patients after a complete clinical response is inappropriate. The watch-and-wait approach in SCC patients after a complete clinical response could be proposed if adequate clinical-instrumental follow-up is guaranteed. In patients with cCR after CRT, adjuvant treatment should not be proposed due to poor evidence. Indeed, in lymph nodes positive with the incomplete pathological response after neoadjuvant CRT, adjuvant therapy could be offered, such as immunotherapy treatment. In selected cases of patients with local recurrence of disease after CRT, surgery or re-irradiation could be two viable options. Quarterly instrumental clinical follow-up in the first 18 months in patients with a complete clinical response must be done. 5-Fluorouracil-based chemotherapy is an option as neoadjuvant treatment. Pre-operative immune nutrition programs and post-operative nutrition counseling programs should be proposed to patients. In the patient with recognized nutritional risk, domiciliary enteral nutritional support must be enabled. 3.5. Recommendations for management in metastatic esophageal/GEJ tumors Thirteen clinical scenarios concerning the following management of metastatic esophageal/GEJ cancer patients were submitted for expert judgment. A consensus on appropriateness was reached in most of the cases (seven scenarios). In three scenarios, a condition of uncertainty, and three cases of inappropriateness were recorded ( Table 5 Table 5. Clinical scenarios of metastatic esophageal/GEJ tumors.

Is it appropriate to introduce locoregional, radiation, or surgical treatments after prolonged disease control with systemic therapy in patients with oligometastatic adenocarcinoma? 7,79 8 0,90 3 Appropriate To date, PD-L1 remains an essential predictive biomarker for treatment choice with immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced settings [ 67 68–70 HER-2 overexpression is detected in about 20% of esophagogastric cancers, especially in GEJ and proximal gastric cancers, as well as high chromosomal instability tumors, in which it occurs in 30% of cases. The phase III Toga trial established trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy as the standard of first-line treatment by demonstrating a survival advantage exceeding 13 months [ 71 72 For HER2-negative patients, platinum/fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors is the standard therapy in the first-line setting. Currently, for patients with PD-L1 TPS < 1% and CPS < 10, platinum drugs and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy remain the standard of care. Recent data from the phase III SPOTLIGHT trial, zolbetuximab plus FOLFOX treatment showed a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with placebo in GEJ adenocarcinoma patients [ 73 Regarding the PD-L1 positive population, the KEYNOTE-590 trial [ 30 42 73 As further-line treatment options, chemotherapy with taxanes or irinotecan monotherapies is an option. Moreover, the Asian ATTRACTION-3 study showed that nivolumab was associated with improved OS compared with taxane-based chemotherapy (HR 0.77, P = 29 74 Experts suggested that before starting a first-line treatment, it should be considered appropriate to offer participation in a clinical trial, where available. As therapeutic options for further-line therapies are rare, molecular profiling should be considered early on. Pembrolizumab provides a feasible option for MSI-H and Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) – High tumors independent of localization and histology, yet those markers are scarce in esophageal SCC [ 75 As well as for locally advanced disease, it was debated whether it is appropriate to discuss all metastatic cases by a multidisciplinary team. Although the voting was heterogeneous, appropriateness was finally reached because there was a need to activate early simultaneous care and identify oligometastatic patients. Some clinical trials show that metastatic patients have a better prognosis if they are discussed in a multidisciplinary team. For this reason, it is inappropriate to discuss only oligometastatic patients. Another topic of discussion was which patients may benefit from systemic first-line treatment, especially those with poor performance status (ECOG PS ≥ 2). In this regard, the panel expressed uncertainty justified by all clinical trials, including both chemotherapy and immunotherapy, have always evaluated patients in good general clinical condition (ECOG PS 0–1), so the results do not apply to the entire population. However, if the patient recovers performance status after simultaneous care activation, such systemic treatment may be appropriate to suggest. Regarding the systemic second-line treatment, if a patient has a PFS of less than 3 months after the first line of therapy, the choice becomes tricky. Understanding the unfavorable survival outcome of these patients, there has been uncertainty among experts about the appropriateness of the strategy. However, further treatments should be an option after the standard first-line with chemo and immunotherapy in hyper-selected cases with good performance status, sharing the expected results with the patient. As reported in ESMO guidelines [ 28 A critical debate was raised on stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) treatment in oligometastatic tumors. Recently, the results of a Japanese nationwide survey on SBRT for pulmonary oligometastases have been published, showing a significantly poor overall survival [ 76 Additionally, it is appropriate to propose further locoregional, radiation, or surgical treatments after prolonged disease control with systemic therapy in patients with both oligometastatic SCC and AC, to improve survival outcomes. As mentioned above, additional systemic treatments beyond the first line could be offered to patients with metastatic tumors. However, the question was raised whether offering it to a patient with a PFS-free interval below 3 months was appropriate. We are aware that this group of patients has an unfavorable outcome, and uncertainty among the panel has been raised. To date, having changed the first-line strategy offering chemotherapy with immunotherapy, concerning patients who relapse very quickly, further treatment options may not be worth it. However, considering the patient’s condition, expectations, and wishes, such as in cases of young patients with good ECOG PS 0, perhaps we could propose further treatment (if there are no clinical trials available), or these cases should be discussed at the regional Molecular Tumor Board (MTB). To summarize, the Italian Expert’s recommendations for the management of metastatic diseases are as follows: A multidisciplinary team is needed to discuss all cases of metastatic patients, especially oligometastatic cases, to enable them to receive further treatment chances, along with activation of prompt simultaneous care. Characterize the patient’s ECOG performance status (whether related to the oncological disease or preexisting comorbidities) to decide whether it is eligible for treatments that can improve survival outcomes. Offer nutritional counseling to the patient before starting a specific treatment. Immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy has become a new standard of care. Consider selected groups of patients to propose radiotherapy or surgery as locoregional therapies. In patients with a PFS of less than 3 months after first-line treatment, carefully consider whether to propose further lines of treatment or candidates in hyper-selected cases for MTB discussion. 4. Conclusions The Expert Opinions discussed within this article represent an Italian consensus derived from clinical practices and the scientific literature data available on the diagnosis, staging, and treatment strategy of esophageal and GEJ cancers. Although the Italian and European Guidelines are useful to guide clinical decisions, there remain areas for which it is essential to evaluate the appropriateness of clinical practice based on the available evidence. Innovation, both in diagnosis and treatment, is leading to an improvement in clinical outcomes for patients with esophageal and GEJ cancers. Finally, the identification of referral centers and multidisciplinary teams will further add “value” and improve the appropriateness of clinical behaviors. Acknowledgments The following oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists, surgeons, gastroenterologists, and pathologists took part in the Italian Multidisciplinary Panel on diagnostic and therapeutic appropriateness in different stages of esophageal/GEJ cancers: Valeria Barresi (Verona, Italy), Ilaria Casaretti (Naples, Italy), Francesco Cellini (Rome, Italy), Elena Fea (Cuneo, Italy), Carlo Garufi (Rome, Italy), Francesco Iachetta (Reggio Emilia, Italy), Daniele Lavacchi (Florence, Italy), Marco Lupattelli (Perugia, Italy), Elena Mazza (Milan, Italy), Sabrina Murgioni (Padua, Italy), Mariateresa Nardi (Padua, Italy), Anna Pagani (Pavia, Italy), Elena Parlagreco (Cuneo, Italy), Stefano Realdon (Aviano, Italy), Luca Reggiani Bonetti (Modena, Italy), Massimiliano Salati (Modena, Italy), Maria Antonietta Satolli (Turin, Italy), Daniele Spada (Cremona, Italy), Monica Valente (Siena, Italy), Giulia Volpi (Verona, Italy). Article highlights  Despite the recent approval of novel treatment options generating expectations, the prognosis of esophageal and GEJ cancer remains unfavorable. Many areas of uncertainty about the most suitable strategies and patient management across the different stages of the disease (early, locally advanced, and metastatic) are raised, deriving from the absence of definitive evidence from clinical trials and guidelines. This article provides an extensive evaluation of the diagnostic and therapeutic approach for complex clinical scenarios proposed by a group of Italian experts (oncologist, radiologist, radiotherapist, surgeons, pathologist, nutritionist) with a multidisciplinary approach, managed beyond the guidelines. The scientifically validated method RAND/UCLA was used to define the appropriateness of interventions in early, locally advanced, and metastatic esophageal and GEJ tumors. The importance and uniqueness of this manuscript is to seek to support clinicians within all the gray areas not addressed in the international and national guidelines in every setting of this disease, which remains sorely lacking in new therapeutic approaches.
