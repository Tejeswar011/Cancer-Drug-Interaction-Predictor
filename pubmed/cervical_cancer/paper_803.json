Introduction Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a group of very aggressive hematological malignancies, with dismal long-term survival rates and little therapeutic recourse presently. The transmembrane ligand B7-H3 is a known therapeutic target, biomarker of response and correlated with an unfavorable prognosis in several malignancies, including AML, due to acquired resistance to immune checkpoint-targeting therapies. Therefore, developing therapeutic strategies with improved efficacy to overcome this obstacle constitutes an unmet need. Our study entails the design, production and in vitro Methods We expressed the conjugate in Escherichia coli 50 Results Overall, the results show that our cytotoxic anti-B7-H3 affibody possesses strong antiproliferative and cell death-inducing activity that is highly specific to B7-H3-expressing AML cells (IC 50 Conclusion In conclusion, we designed, produced and evaluated a novel anti-B7-H3 cytotoxic affibody-drug conjugate (AfDC) that, from these preliminary in vitro in vivo AML affibody B7-H3 cytotoxin magainin-2 leukemia therapy Inselspital, Universitätsspital Bern 10.13039/100018234 The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

AML frequently displays a short-lived response to intensive standard-of-care chemotherapy and results in a very short overall survival rate due to disease persistence or recurrence ( Fan et al., 2023 Wittwer et al., 2017 B7-H3 (CD276) is a transmembrane immune checkpoint ligand protein that belongs to the B7 family and plays a key role in immune regulation. B7-H3, frequently absent or expressed at low levels in physiological conditions, is overexpressed in a wide range of solid tumors (cervical-, colorectal-, and prostate cancer) and some hematologic malignancies, including AML, Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS) and others. This rare expression pattern makes B7-H3 an optimal prognostic biomarker for cancer diagnosis and therapy and a predictive biomarker, given that its persisting expression is often associated with poor prognosis ( Fan et al., 2023 He et al., 2025 Tolmac et al., 2025 reg Guo et al., 2025 Tan and Zhao, 2024 In cancer, high B7-H3 expression acts as a protective mechanism, because it inhibits immune system effectors and increases proliferation, growth and survival of tumor cells through its downstream signaling pathways ( Guo et al., 2025 Affibodies are highly effective targeting proteins, with a simple three alpha-helical structure and high affinity for their epitopes. These are highly soluble, resistant to thermal changes and protease activity and can be rapidly distributed into the bloodstream thanks to their very small size of ∼6–7 kDa. Their size also affords them rapid clearance from the organism, an essential aspect for therapy ( Hö gbom et al., 2003 Oroujeni et al., 2023 in vitro in vivo K  D1 K  D2 Oroujeni et al., 2023 Tolmac et al., 2025 On the search for natural peptides with anticancer properties, recent studies showed that the Magainin class of natural peptides isolated from the skin of the frog Xenopus laevis Zasloff, 1987 Baker et al., 1993 in vitro Cruciani et al. (1991) Ohsaki et al. (1992) Lehmann et al., 2006 We hypothesized that coupling the high-affinity anti-B7-H3 affibody with the membrane-disruptive peptide MAG2 would synergistically enhance the antileukemic effect by selectively targeting AML cells. Affibody-mediated binding would position MAG2 close to the cell membrane, promoting its insertion and progressively destabilizing the lipid bilayer. Upon reaching a critical threshold of MAG2 accumulation, membrane integrity would collapse, leading to rapid and irreversible cell death. In this study, we present a novel, targeted cytotoxic protein construct, Aff-MAG2, which combines the most advanced anti-B7-H3 affibody available, SYNT-179, with the potent membrane-lytic peptide MAG2. This recombinant fusion protein is designed to selectively and synergistically target the promising AML biomarker B7-H3, aiming to induce cancer cell death with minimal off-target toxicity. We describe the design and production of Aff-MAG2, involving genetic fusion of the matured anti-B7-H3 affibody with the cytolytic peptide MAG2, followed by expression of the recombinant construct in Escherichia coli To our knowledge, this is the first report of a B7-H3-specific affibody-drug conjugate incorporating MAG2 for targeted membrane disruption and selective anti-leukemic activity, warranting further preclinical and translational studies. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Expression plasmid We ordered the pET-19b expression plasmid vector from GenScript with the DNA sequence of the 6xHis-SUMO-Aff-MAG2 construct inserted between the unique restriction sites NcoI at 5′ and XhoI at 3’. The plasmid was provided in lyophilized form and it was resuspended upon arrival in TE Buffer ( Supplementary Table S2 2.2 Cell lines The cell lines utilized were THP-1 (Acute monocytic leukemia monocytes), as a representative cell line for AML, from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, TIB-202) and RAJI (Burkitt lymphoma B-lymphocytes, ATCC, CCL-86) ( ATCC, 2025 2 ATCC, 2025 5 5 2.3 Expression and purification of 6xhis-SUMO-Aff-MAG2 For the expression of the recombinant fusion protein, we utilized the BL21 (DE3) E. coli 600 600 600 600 For bacterial lysis, we resuspended the pellet in 10 mL Bacterial Lysis Buffer ( Supplementary Table S2 per per per 600 Glazyrina et al., 2010 For purification of 6xHis-SUMO-Aff-MAG2 from the bacterial lysate, we utilized an ÄKTAprime plus FPLC (G&E Healthcare) and a HisTrap HP 5 mL Ni-Sepharose affinity chromatography column (Cytiva, lot no. 10330203) to bind the 6xHis tag of the recombinant protein. All purification operations were performed in a 4 °C environment. All purification buffers were initially filtered as described before and then degassed. The purification method was the following: 10 column volumes (CV) MilliQ water, followed by column equilibration with 10 CV Binding Buffer ( Supplementary Table S2 Supplementary Table S2 Supplementary Table S2 We performed cleavage of all recombinant construct tags in the protein’s buffer (Dialysis Buffer), using a 6xHis-SUMO protease (Ulp1 protease from S. cerevisiae Schneider et al., 2012 2.4 NanoLC-MS/MS analysis of the purified Aff-MAG2 construct and evaluation of the hypothetical cleavage site We used the purified protein sample in Dialysis Buffer ( Supplementary Table S2 Munteanu et al., 2021 For nanoLC-MS/MS analysis, an Easy-nLC 1200 coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap™ Velos Pro (Thermo Fisher Scientific) mass spectrometer was used. The sample was reconstituted in solvent A (0.06% formic acid - FA and 2% acetonitrile - ACN) and the peptides were separated on an RP C18 Acclaim™ PepMap™ 100 (0.075 um x 150 mm) analytical column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 2%–30% solvent B (0.06% FA and 80% ACN) for ∼90 min. The data acquisition involved a data-dependent procedure under which the top five most abundant ions from the survey scan acquired in the orbital trap were selected for fragmentation using either CID or HCD, alternatively, in different runs, as previously described ( Chirițoiu et al., 2021 E. coli 2.5 MTS assay Cells were plated in 96-well plates, with both THP-1 and RAJI cells necessary for all experimental conditions, incubated for 12 h before treatment. For every experimental condition, we performed a technical triplicate. Both cell lines were treated with the following concentrations of Aff-MAG2: 1.56 µM, 3.12 µM, 6.25 µM, 12.5 µM, 25 μM, 50 μM and 100 µM.

After treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and pelleted at 350 xg, for 5 min at RT and then frozen at −80 °C. They were then lysed by rapid thawing, resuspension in Eukaryote Lysis Buffer ( Supplementary Table S2 ™ ® ® ™ ™ 2.8 Data analysis and statistics We performed all experiments independently three times and we employed at least two biological replicates.

Molecular weight markers are labeled in kilodaltons on each panel. 3.3 Amino acid sequence confirmation of the purified Aff-MAG2 by nanoLC-MS/MS analysis By using a bottom-up approach employing in-solution trypsinization, we validated the amino acid sequence of Aff-MAG2 by mass spectrometry analysis. Semi-tryptic analysis of the LC-MS/MS data revealed the identification of 66 peptides yielding a total sequence coverage of 88.17% ( Figure 3 FIGURE 3 Validation of the purified Aff-MAG2 amino acid sequence.

The amino acids are labeled in blocks according to their position on the bar. 3.4 Aff-MAG2 demonstrates an inhibitory effect on acute myeloid leukemia cells After purifying and validating our recombinant cytotoxic compound, we aimed to test its potential for inhibiting the viability of AML cells in a specific, targeted way, given its affibody part with high affinity for B7-H3. As a classical model for AML, we chose the THP-1 cell line, known to express B7-H3. To compare the on-target activity of the construct, in parallel, we tested the lymphoblastic RAJI cells, known to lack B7-H3 expression. To this end, we treated both THP-1 and RAJI cells with a serial dilution of Aff-MAG2, at the final concentration range: 0 μM, 1.56 µM, 3.12 µM, 6.25 µM, 12.5 µM, 25 μM, 50 μM and 100 µM. All treatments were performed for 6 h, in technical triplicate, followed by MTS assay. As mentioned above, RAJI cells represented the negative control for specificity of the cytotoxic product. The technical negative controls for the assay comprised of cells from both lines incubated with only the complete growth medium, without added antibiotics (untreated cells). As the hypothesized mechanism of action of the tested compound is the permeabilization of the cell membrane, even leading to pore formation, the technical positive control we utilized for the assay was a 15-min treatment with Triton X-100 0.02%.

Statistical significance denoted by asterisks: ns (not significant), two asterisks (p<0.01), and three asterisks (p<0.001). 3.5 Aff-MAG2 induces necrotic and apoptotic cell death in AML cells Given the encouraging viability reduction observed in the MTS assay, we sought to further characterize the functional impact of the cytotoxic construct on cellular fate using flow cytometry. THP-1 and RAJI cells were treated with 30 µM of the construct for 6 h. RAJI cells served as a negative control for B7-H3 expression and target specificity, while untreated cells from both lines constituted technical negative controls. Technical positive controls included 0.02% Triton X-100 (15 min) for necrosis induction and 30 µM Cisplatin (18 h) for apoptosis.

THP-1 and RAJI cells were treated with 15 µM of the compound for 6 h, followed by Western blot analysis. As before, untreated cells served as technical negative controls and RAJI cells served as the experimental negative control due to their previously described lack of B7-H3 expression. As shown in Figure 6 Bading et al., 1989 Nicholson et al., 1995 FIGURE 6 Proliferation inhibition and apoptosis increase in AML cells treated with Aff-MAG2, in Western blot. All samples were total cell lysates, loaded in equal amounts. Aff-MAG2, treatment with 15 µM cytotoxic compound for 6 h, - untreated cells, + treated cells. The numbers on the left side of the image represent the approximate mass in kDa at which the corresponding bands migrated. Lanes 2 and 6, empty; lane 4 - molecular weight marker. Probably because of extensive plasma membrane damage and loss of cytosolic content in the cell medium, the loading control α-Tubulin could not be detected in the treated THP-1 cells (lane 3). Ki-67, recognized marker for cell proliferation; Cleaved Caspase 3, recognized marker for all apoptosis pathways. Results from a representative experiment out of three performed ( n Western blot analysis showing protein expression in THP-1 and RAJI cells with and without Aff-MAG2 treatment. Labeled bands are Ki-67, Cleaved Caspase 3, B7-H3, and α-Tubulin, with molecular weights indicated. Each lane represents a specific condition, with lanes numbered 1 to 7. We additionally validated B7-H3 expression by Western blot, observing clear bands for B7-H3 in both treated and untreated THP-1 cells (lanes 1 and 3), while RAJI cells remained negative (lanes 5 and 7). Although α-Tubulin was used as the loading control and all samples were loaded in equal amounts, the loading control could not be detected in treated THP-1 cells (lane 3), most likely due to proteolytic membrane damage and loss of the cytosolic content. This loss of soluble cytoplasmic proteins was confirmed by the absence of other loading controls such as GAPDH (data not shown). Importantly, the presence of B7-H3 (a membrane-associated protein) and Cleaved Caspase 3 confirms that equivalent total protein was loaded across samples, despite partial loss of soluble components. Taken together, these data support the conclusion that Aff-MAG2 selectively reduces proliferation and increases apoptosis of B7-H3-positive THP-1 cells, with minimal to no effect on non-target RAJI cells. These data complement the MTS and flow cytometry findings and reinforce the cytotoxic specificity and efficacy of this novel, targeted protein construct. 4 Discussion Through this study, we endeavored to design, develop and evaluate in vitro Oroujeni et al., 2023 Lehmann et al., 2006 E. coli Lehmann et al., 2006 Guo et al., 2025 After purifying the recombinant protein, we observed some degradation, evident in Figure 2C Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Figure S4 + in vivo Although there have been over 37 years since magainins were first discovered and isolated from Xenopus laevis Zasloff, 1987 Baker et al., 1993 Cruciani et al., 1991 Ohsaki et al., 1992 Lehmann et al., 2006 Icriverzi et al., 2024 in cellulo Baker et al., 1993 Supplementary Figure S5 The IC 50 Lehmann et al., 2006 Cruciani et al., 1991 50 Ohsaki et al., 1992 50 50 + It is known that in normal conditions, the high positive charge of Magainin-2 and other similar toxic peptides creates an attraction to plasma membranes, as they are negatively charged on the exterior. Even more so, it has been shown that the natural affinity of these peptides is even higher for tumor cell membranes, most likely because tumor cells expose more negatively charged residues on their surface, like phosphatidylserine ( Luan et al., 2020 Gasteiger et al., 2005 This potential interaction was also suggested by the AlphaFold 3 modeling of Aff-MAG2 ( Figure 1B The high affinity of this affibody towards B7-H3 is most likely stronger than its interaction with MAG2 and thus “frees” the toxin to attach to the cell membrane and eventually create pores in it, specifically killing only cells that highly express B7-H3. If this holds true, the construct we designed could present great potential for in vivo In future studies, we plan to stabilize Aff-MAG2 to avoid degradation, characterize its pharmacokinetic properties and its mechanism of action further through other biochemical and in cellulo in vivo With the emergence of promising clinical trials targeting B7-H3-positive malignancies, such as the use of the radiolabeled monoclonal antibody (mAb) 131 Kramer et al., 2022 In parallel, B7-H3-directed CAR-T cells incorporating single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) against B7-H3 have shown superior efficacy over monoclonal antibodies in both solid and hematologic tumors ( Guo et al., 2025 We warmly thank Adrian Bogdan Țigu from the Research Centre for Advanced Medicine–MEDFUTURE at Iuliu Hațieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, for kindly providing the RAJI cells.
