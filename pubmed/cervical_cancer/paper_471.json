We present our institutional experience in this clinical scenario, and a meta-analysis. Methods The baseline data, procedural data, clinical and radiological outcomes of MT were analyzed and compared among three groups of stroke patients: controls, patients with active malignancy (AM), and patients with history of malignancy (HOM). A meta-analysis of 12 studies was conducted to address the differences between controls and AM patients regarding selected outcomes. Results The 3 groups (controls, AM, HOM) showed significant differences regarding previous history of stroke or TIA (7.8% vs 10.5% vs 38.5%, p p p p p p p In the meta-analysis, the AM arm showed significantly higher mortality during hospitalization (n = 6, OR 95% CI = 3.03 [1.62, 5.64]), and at 3 months (n = 10, OR 95% CI = 4.33 [2.80, 6.68]), and significantly lower rates of 3 months functional independence (mRS = 0-2) (n = 10, OR 95% CI = 0.47 [0.32, 0.70]). No significant difference was found in sICH rates (n = 6, pooled OR 95% CI = 2.03 [0.83, 4.95]). Discussion Endovascular MT is technically successful and reasonably safe in treating AIS from LVO in active malignancy patients. However, the causes and implications of sICH require further investigation. Despite technical success, these patients experience poor clinical outcomes, and the long-term benefits of MT remain uncertain. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
