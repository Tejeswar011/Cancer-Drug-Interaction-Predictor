We investigated the impact of COVID‐19 on BC diagnoses in the US. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the 2024 release of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER: 2000–2021) for invasive BC incidences per 100,000 in adult women. Using the SEER Joinpoint software, we modeled BC incidence trends through 2019 and extrapolated expected incidences in 2020–2021. We compared expected and observed incidences and calculated percent differences (PD) and the national deficit in diagnoses. Results Observed BC incidence in 2020 was 122.03, while expected incidence was 132.14, yielding a PD of −7.6% [−8.9%, −6.4%]. In 2021, observed BC incidence exceeded projections (3.5% [2.1%, 4.8%]). These translated to a cumulative deficit of 7190 cases [−11,886, −2494] during 2020–2021. Localized and regional BC detection decreased in 2020 and was within (1.4% [−0.9%, 3.7%]) or exceeded (4.1% [4.2%, 4.4%]) projections, respectively, in 2021. Distant disease detection was within projections in 2020 and exceeded projections in 2021 (3.9% [0.6%, 7.2%]). Across most demographic subgroups, detection was low in 2020. In 2021, cases exceeded projections in White women and metropolitan and high education/income counties, were within projections in racial/ethnic minorities and rural and low education/income counties, and were below projections in 85+ year olds and 10%–19.99% foreign‐born counties. Conclusions BC detection recovered in 2021 compared to the start of the pandemic, but notable disparities persisted. Careful surveillance and study are needed to prevent further gaps in BC detection years after the pandemic. breast cancer COVID‐19 incidence pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  S.

In 2021, observed BC incidence exceeded projections, with a statistically significant positive PD of 3.5% [2.1%, 4.8%] (Table 1 S1 TABLE 1 Disruption and recovery of breast cancer detection during Years 1 and 2 of the pandemic.

By cancer stage (Table 1 Among receptor subtypes, hormone receptor positive (HR+) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2‐) BC detection decreased the most in 2020 (−10.4% [−13.8%, −7.0%]) but was within expected projections in 2021 (0.5%, [−3.3%, 4.2]). HR+/HER2+ and HR‐/HER2‐ BC detection decreased in 2020 (−4.1% [−6.3%, −1.8%] and −4.1% [−6.5%, −1.7%], respectively) and exceeded projections in 2021 (5.8% [3.2%, 8.3%] and 6.6% [4.0%, 9.2%], respectively). Most demographic subgroups recovered by 2021. BC incidence in non‐Hispanic White women (2.8% [1.2%, 4.5%]), large metropolitan areas (2.6% [1.2%, 3.9%]), 20%+ foreign‐born counties (2.9% [1.1%, 4.7%]), low poverty counties (3.8% [2.2%, 5.4%]), and high‐education counties (2.1% [0.3%, 3.8%]) exceeded projections in 2021. In contrast, BC detection in women of racial minorities in 2021 recovered but did not exceed projections: Hispanic: 1.7% [−2.8%, 6.1%], American Indian/Alaska Native: 1.9% [−11.5%, 15.3%], Asian and Pacific Islander: 5.3% [−0.4%, 10.9%], and non‐Hispanic Black women: −0.3% [−3.1%, 2.4%]. This was also true for women residing in counties of low income (−1.6% [−4.7%, 1.5%]), rural communities (−4.0% [−8.2%, 0.2%]), and counties of low education (−2.1% [−5.4%, 1.1%]) in 2021. Persistent deficits into 2021 were observed in women aged 85+ (−8.5% [−14.9%, −2.2%]) and women in 10%–19.99% foreign‐born counties (−3.7% [−6.5%, −1.0%]). Subgroup analysis of TNBC (Table S1 4 Discussion BC detection did not reach prepandemic levels in 2020, as confirmed by decreased BC screening [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 16 21 9 22 23 24 24 Regional and distant BC detection increased by 4.3% and 3.9%, respectively, in 2021. In contrast, a SEER study reported increased distant disease detection in 2021 [ 9 25 26 27 28 29 30 28 31 Disparities in recovery were evident. In 2020, all demographic subgroups experienced decreased BC detection. In 2021, White women experienced a rebound in detection with a positive PD of 2.8%. Studies have shown greater return to mammographic screening in 2021 in suburban hospitals, which served predominantly White patients [ 23 32 20 33 32 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 Women aged 85+ and those in counties with 10%–19.99% foreign‐born populations experienced persistent detection deficits in 2021. BC detection in 2021 for women aged 85+ decreased by −8.5%. The wide confidence interval (−14.9% to −2.2%) is likely due to the smaller population of this age group, resulting in greater uncertainty in true population parameters. Nevertheless, elderly women likely faced challenges for BC diagnosis due to increased COVID‐19 morbidity [ 41 42 43 44 45 46 A major limitation of this study is that SEER does not cover 100% of the population. Additionally, this study did not assess specific barriers to BC detection in 2021, limiting our ability to determine why certain communities experienced slower recoveries postpandemic. Nevertheless, our findings highlight critical gaps in BC detection during the postpandemic period and serve as a basis for generating hypotheses. Further efforts by hospitals and local healthcare systems are essential to address barriers exacerbated by the pandemic. Barriers that hindered breast cancer screening and diagnosis during the pandemic—and continue to persist—must be identified and mitigated. 5 Conclusion BC detection efforts resumed in 2021, but recovery was uneven, with certain groups recovering to a lesser degree or not recovering altogether. This was seen in vulnerable populations, including the elderly, rural residents, immigrants, and racial minorities, as well as low socioeconomic groups. To mitigate disparities in BC detection and outcomes in the postpandemic period, healthcare systems must address barriers to screening. Barriers to posttreatment surveillance for women who may have presented with more advanced‐stage disease in 2021 due to pandemic‐related delays must be addressed as well. Maintaining robust epidemiological surveillance is essential to understanding and addressing these inequities in the years ahead. Author Contributions  Susan J.
