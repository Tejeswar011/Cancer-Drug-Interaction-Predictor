Traditional reconstructive surgery often requires transplantation of healthy tissues, which can lead to additional injury at the donor site. In contrast, regenerative medicine offers a promising alternative, enabling the reconstruction of damaged tissues using a combination of cells, signaling molecules, and biomaterials to minimize harm to healthy tissues [ 1 Successful stem-or stromal cell-based regenerative treatments include the regeneration of bone defects following cancer excision [ 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 Classical biomaterials comprise purified components resulting in a well-defined composition, such as Integra®DRT, constructed from porcine collagen I cross-linked with chondroitin-6-sulfate using glutaraldehyde [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 The influence of tissue-specific extracellular matrix components on stem cell fate has been previously reported. For example, Hung et al. [ 18 19 20 As the major components of the extracellular matrices of various tissues are well understood, the specific combination of structural and non-structural molecules (e.g. collagens IV, VI, fibrillin, tenascin-C, elastin, perlecan and nidogen for adipose tissue) of the ECM creates a characteristic tissue microenvironment [ 21 24 This study aimed to evaluate the contextual ECM components existing in decellularized tissue on scaffold integration with the host tissue. In this study, we characterized the biochemical composition, sterility, and cytotoxicity of adipose-derived ECM ( adipo adipo ® Materials and methods Decellularization of adipose tissue Lipoaspirates harvested as medical waste from three healthy donors were processed independently using the rapid decellularization protocol described in (Table 1 adipo Table 1 Rapid decellularization protocol No. Operation Time Temp.

Blood was analyzed using a veterinary hematology analyzer ABC Vet (HORIBA®, UK) with the following parameters: white blood cells (WBC), red blood cells (RBC), platelets (PLT), granulocytes (GRA), lymphocytes (LYM), monocytes (MON), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular volume (MCH), hemoglobin concentration (HGB), and red cell distribution width (RDW). Analysis of biochemical parameters The serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase (ALT), alanine transaminase (GPT), creatinine (Cre), total protein (T-Pro), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were analyzed. Biochemistry analyses were conducted using a Spotchem EZ Chemistry Analyzer (Arkray) and multiparameter strips (Spotchem Panel V) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cytokine concentration analysis Cytokine concentrations in mouse serum were analyzed using the LEGENDplex Mouse Inflammation Panel 13-plex kit (Biolegend, UK), the BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, U.S.A.), and LEGENDplex software (Biolegend). The following cytokines were analyzed: IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-17A, IL-23, IL-27, MCP-1, IFN-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and GM-CSF. Histology Fresh frozen sectioning (30 um in a thickness) was performed at − 30 °C followed by fixation in cold acetone. Oil Red O staining with hematoxylin (Abcam, UK) was conducted to visualize the lipids according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Trichrome staining (Bio-Optica Milano, Italy) was used to evaluate collagen structure and cellular distribution. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples were cut to a thickness of 5 µm and prepared for immunofluorescence analysis. The slides were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse CD31 IgG antibodies (1:100 dilution, Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h at 4 °C °C to detect endothelial cells in the biomaterial samples. Then, a secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 594 anti-rabbit IgG) was applied for 1 h, and the slides were cover-slipped in Fluoroshield TM Statistics The data were processed and visualized using OriginPro 2019b (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). To assess statistical significance, Student’s t-tests were performed using GraphPad Prism for Windows (GraphPad Software, Boston, USA).

The presence of blood vessels indicates full integration of adipo Discussion We have demonstrated the distinct performance of adipo Biomaterials have mainly been tested in the microenvironment of tissue injury, where the proximity to granulation tissue forming a wound bed supports vascularization and the integration of biomaterials. Here, for the first time, we compared rapidly decellularized adipose tissue with connective tissue substitutes in an injury-unrelated setting. We have shown the superiority of adipo adipo Integra®DRT was designed for dermis reconstruction and is typically laid on granulation tissue [ 28 adipo 29 30 31 32 33 33 Comparing decellularization protocols of adipose tissue processing, the time and harnessing of reagents strongly influences the quality and bioactivity of biomaterials [ 20 34 34 19 35 14 33 36 38 The advantages of decellularized materials may stem from the combination of structural and soluble factors. Interestingly, the biomechanical properties of decellularized tissues correspond to those of native tissues; therefore, the host cells are exposed to attractive mechanical forces [ 38 39 adipo 40 11 41 42 43 Currently, cell-based technologies are extremely expensive and beyond widespread availability, making decellularized biomaterials commercially viable substitutes. At the same time, further technological progress may dampen the costs of the aforementioned cellular materials, which can be easily attained, making decellularized biomaterials obsolete. Although rapidly decellularized adipose tissue is a very compelling concept for widespread use, it is vital to the notion that acellularized autologous adipose tissue has been used during reconstructive surgeries for years [ 44 45 3 46 48 44 Several conditions facilitate the potential widespread utility of adipo 49 adipo adipo Conclusion We have demonstrated here that rapid decellularization of adipose tissue is sufficient to meet acceptance criteria for decellularized tissue and preserves ECM-associated compounds. We have also shown the superiority of decellularized adipose tissue over collagen-based synthetic biomaterial in integration with host tissue, as evidenced by extensive vascularization and host cell tissue infiltration. Bioactivity of decellularized adipose tissue improves integration with the host tissue with no cell transplantation or other active cues.
