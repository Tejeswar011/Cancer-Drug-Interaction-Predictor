Introduction The rapid proliferation of microbial infections in recent decades has become a pressing issue in the realm of global public health [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 The synthesis of hybrid molecules—structures that integrate multiple pharmacophores—has emerged as a powerful strategy in drug design. These hybrid compounds often exhibit superior bioactivity compared to existing drugs [ 12 1 7 The main goal of the syntheses presented in this review was the synthesis of norlabdane-heterocyclic molecular hybrids from (−)-sclareol 1 13 14 15 16 17 2 1 18 19 3 6 Figure 1 In other cases, the syntheses of penta- and tetranorlabdane-heterocyclic hybrids started from carboxylic acids 7 8 10 13 9 14 15 1 2 Figure 2 Figure 3 Some series of penta- and tetranorlabdane-heterocyclic hybrids were obtained through heterocyclization reactions via hydrazides 16 19 1 2 Figure 3 Figure 3 Penta- and tetranorlabdane intermediates and hydrazides 13 19 1 It should be noted that the methods for obtaining the norlabdanic intermediates depicted in Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 1 2 For convenience, the syntheses of norlabdane: diazine, 1,2,4-triazole and carbazole, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole, 1,3-thiazole, 1,3-benzothiazole, and 1,3-benzimidazole hybrids are organized into separate Section 2.1 Section 2.2 Section 2.3 Section 2.4 Section 2.5 Section 2.6 Section 2.7 2. Results 2.1. Synthesis of Norlabdane–Diazine Hybrids Many drugs have been designed based on diazine compounds. Diazines have proven highly valuable in medicine, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics due to their broad spectrum of biological activities, including antimicrobial, antifungal, antitubercular, antiviral, anti-HIV, and anticancer properties [ 20 The synthesis of the mentioned hybrids was carried out based on (+)-sclareolide 2 8,13 7 11 13 20 21 22 23a c 21 As a result, from bicyclohomofarnesenoyl chloride 20 24a c 25 Scheme 1 21 22 23b 23c 24b 24c 23a 24a bis 25 The molecular structure of hybrid 25 bis The coupling reactions of 13,14,15,16-tetranorlabd-6,8(9)-dien-12-oyl chloride 21 23a c 23b 23c 26b 26c Scheme 1 23a 26a bis 27 23 All N 8,13 7 11 20 21 24a 26a bis bis 25 27 This selectivity is likely attributable to the delocalization of the nonbonding electrons of nitrogen into the adjacent carbonyl group (amide bond resonance), which decreases the overall nucleophilicity of the amide nitrogen and thereby reduces its reactivity toward further acylation. Moreover, in the case of amides 24a c 26a c bis Drimenoic acid 13 2 24 Further synthetic efforts were directed toward the preparation of amides of drimenoic acid 13 28a 28b 22 23c 29 30 24 It should be noted that during the reaction of drimenoic acid 13 7,8 8,9 22 23a 23b 23c 28a 28b 29 30 The in vitro antimicrobial activities of the synthesized homodrimane sesquiterpenoids, both with and without a diazine skeleton, were systematically evaluated. The tested compounds exhibit excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains of S. aureus B. cereus 23a 23b bis 24a c 25 22 As a continuation of previous research on the synthesis of new compounds incorporating both terpene and 1,2-diazine fragments, a series of norlabdane derivatives containing a pyridazinone structural unit were synthesized [ 25 26 For the preparation of these norlabdane-based compounds, the methyl ester of 7-oxo-13,14,15,16-tetranorlabd-8-en-12-oic acid 9 2 The ketoester 9 N 31 Scheme 2 Subsequently, ketobromide 31 p H 36 2 3 N,N 37 36 N Scheme 2 25 Next, through a series of transformations starting from the methyl ester of 7-oxo-13,14,15,16-tetranorlabd-8-en-12-oic acid 9 N 32 33 34 35 Scheme 2 The brominated compounds 32 35 p H 36 N,N 32 33 p H 36 p 38 p 39 38 39 34 35 36 p 40 p 41 The structures of the newly synthesized compounds were confirmed using spectroscopic methods, including 1 13 41 26 pharmaceuticals-18-01411-sch002_Scheme 2 Scheme 2 Synthesis of tetra- and pentanorlabdane- p 25 26 27 All synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro against five fungal strains and two bacterial species.

Synthesis of Norlabdane-1,3,4-oxadiazole Hybrids 1,3,4-Oxadiazole is a versatile heterocyclic ring, frequently used in pharmaceutical chemistry for the development of novel therapeutic agents [ 35 36 37 38 39 40 Next, the synthesis and biological properties of new molecular norlabdane-1,3,4-oxadiazole hybrids will be described [ 41 22 26 32 The synthesis of the reported compounds was carried out based on 8 α 16 2 41 Treatment of hydrazide 16 50a c Scheme 5 34 Being treated with N N 2 42 50a c 53a c Next, hydrazide 16 43 54 The reaction of hydrazide 16 α H 55 Scheme 5 43 A study was conducted on the reaction between hydrazide 16 44 The use of 1 equivalent of TMTD under the mentioned conditions proved to be quite efficient and led to 2-thio-5-(11-homodrim-8 α 57 Section 2.4 41 Next, 1,3,4-oxadiazoles 55 57 3 N α 56 N α 58 Scheme 5 45 For the preparation of tetranorlabdane-1,3,4-oxadiazole hybrids, hydrazide 18 8 9 2 46 Scheme 6 The reaction of hydrazide 18 59a 59b N N 60a 60b Scheme 6 Following the interaction of hydrazide 18 8,9 61 The 2-thio-5-(Δ 8,9 62 18 The reaction of hydrazide 18 8,9 H 63 Scheme 6 To make a comparative study of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) with tetranorlandane molecular hybrids, we synthesized a series of pentanorlabdane 1,3,4-oxadiazoles, starting from the hydrazide of drimenoic acid 18 13 2 4 2 Scheme 7 Subsequently, starting from hydrazide 19 65a 65b 66 67 68 Scheme 7 Spectral analyses ( 1 13 67 The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the synthesized tetranorlandane 53 58 59 63 64 68 According to these, 1,3,4-oxadiazoles 56 57 63 56 Thus, for the first time, based on (+)-sclareolide 2 2.4. Synthesis of Norlabdane-1,3,4-thiadiazole Hybrids 1,3,4-Thiadiazole, as well as its derivatives, contains a universal heterocyclic nucleus that has attracted increased attention in medicinal chemistry in the search for new therapeutic agents. This five-membered heterocyclic compound is widely used as a structural element in various biologically active molecules, including drugs [ 47 48 As a starting material for the synthesis of the reported norlabdane 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, 8α-hydroxy-homodrim-11-hydrazide 16 Scheme 8 41 As mentioned in Section 2.3 α 16 α 57 α 69 Scheme 5 Scheme 8 57 69 41 When 0.5 mol of TMTD is used in the reaction with 1 mol of hydrazide 16 57 16 57 69 57 16 69 69 69 Next, thiadiazole 69 3 S 70 Scheme 8 Following the strategy for synthesizing norlabdane 1,3,4-thiadiazole hybrids, another synthetic method was employed, involving the interaction of hydrazide 16 3 71a c Scheme 8 41 The antibacterial and antifungal activity of the synthesized norlabdane 1,3,4-thiadiazole hybrids 69 70 71a c 69 41 69 71a 71a Prolonged reflux of hydrazides 18 19 3 72a 72b 73a 73b 41 Scheme 8 For the synthesis of novel tetranorlabdane derivatives bearing thiosemicarbazone fragments or 1,3,4-thiadiazole rings, 13,14,15,16-tetranorlabd-6(7),8(9)-dien-12-oic acid 11 49 11 74a c Scheme 8 In continuation, the heterocyclization reaction of thiosemicarbazones 74a c 3 2 75 76a b Scheme 8 The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the synthesized tetranorlabdane hybrids with thiosemicarbazone or 1,3,4-thiadiazole moieties were tested in vitro on pure cultures of bacteria and fungi [ 50 Thus, for the first time, based on (+)-sclareolide 2 69 75 69 75 51 52 2.5. Synthesis of Norlabdane-1,3-thiazole Hybrids The 1,3-thiazole moiety represents a key structural element in drug design due to its wide-ranging biological activities. Several thiazole derivatives are known to exhibit anticonvulsant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and other pharmacologically relevant effects [ 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 In continuation, the data regarding the synthesis of tetra- and pentanorlabdane compounds with thiosemicarbazone moieties and 1,3-thiazole units in outside chain or cycle B synthesized by our group will be described [ 63 Natural diol (−)-sclareol 1 3 Scheme 9 64 The reaction of ketone 3 77 78 77 78 79 80 For the synthesis of trinorlabdane-1,3-thiazole hybrids, commercially available (+)-sclareolide 2 3 α 4 64 4 3 3 5 6 Scheme 9 65 pharmaceuticals-18-01411-sch009_Scheme 9 Scheme 9 Synthesis of di- and trinorlabdane-1,3-thiazole hybrids.

Synthesis of Norlabdane-1,3-benzothiazole Hybrids The chemistry of 1,3-benzothiazole and its 2-substituted derivatives has developed into a distinct field of research, driven by their high structural diversity [ 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 Little data is known from the specialized literature about natural and biologically active compounds that include a 1,3-benzothiazole moiety, and even less about terpene compounds [ 80 81 82 Currently, researchers’ attention is focused on developing methods for the synthesis of substituted 1,3-benzothiazoles and their derivatives, using different types of catalysts to improve selectivity, purity, and product yield. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies particularly reveal that the structure of the substituent at the C 2 ortho 74 83 Thioamides can be obtained by the conversion of amides using Lawesson’s reagent, and the course of the reaction and the yield depend on the structures of the substrates used [ 84 As part of modern research focused on the development of new biologically active terpeno-heterocyclic compounds and as a logical complement to the research described in the previous subsections, our team has set a new goal: the synthesis of tetranorlabdane 1,3-benzothiazole hybrids. The data obtained will be presented below [ 85 As a starting material for the synthesis of the mentioned compounds, (+)-sclareolide 2 10 8 11 2 The one-pot decarboxylative cyclization reactions of acids 8 10 11 86 105 108 Scheme 11 It should be noted that, in the case of carboxylic acid 8 107 108 108 1 8 pharmaceuticals-18-01411-sch011_Scheme 11 Scheme 11 Synthesis of norlabdane-1,3-benzothiazole hybrids.

Synthesis of Norlabdane-1,3-benzimidazole Hybrids 1,3-Benzimidazole is a valuable structural element in the design of new drugs, due to its diverse biological activity, chemical stability, and ability to interact with a variety of biological targets, which makes it highly relevant to the pharmaceutical industry [ 87 Synthetically, benzimidazoles are obtained through the condensation reaction of 1,2-phenylenediamine with aldehydes and carboxylic acids. Their derivatives exhibit low toxicity and high activity against many pathogenic strains, with minimal chances of resistance [ 88 There are few studies describing the synthesis and biological evaluation of new hybrid heterocyclic structures. In one of them, molecular hybrids formed by 1,2,3-triazole and benzimidazole units are presented, which reveal significant antibacterial, antifungal, and cytotoxic activities [ 89 90 The aim of this research was to develop original methods for the synthesis of new terpeno–heterocyclic derivatives based on the readily available natural diterpenoid (−)-sclareol 1, and to design chiral natural molecules of potential interest to the pharmaceutical industry. In this context, we present the results of the synthesis of novel tetranorlabdanes bearing either 2-substituted 1,3-benzimidazole or N 91 The title N 8 10 11 12 113 114 115 116 22 Scheme 12 NMR spectral analysis confirmed the presence of both heterocyclic and terpene moieties within the hybrid structures, while their molecular formulas were validated by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS).

Conclusions The escalating prevalence of fungal and bacterial infections, compounded by the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, underscores the critical need for the development of novel molecular entities with enhanced antimicrobial efficacy. Natural products, and terpenoids in particular, have emerged as a prolific source of bioactive compounds due to their inherent biocompatibility, selective biological activity, and low toxicity profiles. The summary of our publications from 2013 to the present shows that norlabdane hybrids bearing diazine, 1,2,4-triazole, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole, 1,3-thiazole, 1,3-benzothiazole and 1,3-benzimidazole moieties represent valuable bioactive molecules for the design of new drugs. The mentioned norlabdane-heterocyclic hybrids were synthesized from commercially available (+)-sclareolide 2 Salvia sclarea In the first case, coupling reactions of various terpene derivatives, such as carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides, or bromides, with selected azaheterocyclic compounds were preferred to form new C–N or C–C bonds and thus the desired hybrid molecules. When heterocyclization reactions were applied, involving the cyclocondensation of key intermediates such as hydrazides, hydrazinecarbothioamides, or thiosemicarbazones, they led to the formation of heterocyclic rings integrated into the side chains or the B-ring of the terpene components. The in vitro biological evaluation of these compounds against selected fungal strains and bacterial species revealed notable antimicrobial activity, ranging from moderate to pronounced and high, thereby validating their therapeutic potential. This promising biological activity exhibited by the synthesized hybrids highlights their potential as lead candidates for the development of new antimicrobial agents, thus contributing to both the advancement of medicinal chemistry and the sustainable utilization of renewable natural resources. We believe that this progress in the field of molecular hybrids, especially terpeno-heterocyclic hybrids, will encourage their synthesis and more active exploration of their biological properties.
