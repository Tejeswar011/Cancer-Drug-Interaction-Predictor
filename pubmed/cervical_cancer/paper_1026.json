Background Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with non-regional cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) poses significant therapeutic challenges due to lack of consensus in guidelines and poor outcomes associated with conventional treatment modalities. Recent studies have demonstrated promising efficacy of combined immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery in ESCC; however, the role of this multimodal approach in managing non-regional CLNM—historically considered inoperable—remains unclear. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 15 patients with thoracic ESCC and non-regional CLNM who underwent neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (nCIT), followed by McKeown esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy between 2020 and 2024. CLNM was confirmed via ultrasound-guided biopsy. Data on pathological response, safety, and survival outcomes were collected and analyzed. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results A pathological complete response (pCR) in CLNM was achieved in 93.3% of patients, while the Total pCR (ypT0N0M0) rate (clearance of both primary tumor and metastatic lymph node) was 33.3%. At a median follow-up of 18.0 months, the 1-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 91.7%. One patient died during the follow-up period. Postoperative complications occurred in 73.3% of patients, predominantly respiratory events such as atelectasis and pneumonia; only one patient experienced a grade 4 event. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were mild, with no grade ≥3 TRAEs observed; anemia was the most common TRAEs, occurring in 46.7% of patients. Conclusion nCIT induces a high cervical nodal response in ESCC with non-regional CLNM and may redefine surgical eligibility for patients with non-regional metastases. The observed 1-year DFS of 91.7% is promising, though long-term outcomes require further validation through prospective studies. esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cervical lymph node metastasis neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy surgical resection survival outcomes The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Cancer Immunity and Immunotherapy Introduction Esophageal cancer remains a major global health concern due to its aggressive biological behavior and poor prognosis ( 1 2 3 4 5 The therapeutic approach to ESCC with CLNM remains a subject of ongoing debate. While major international staging systems—namely, the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control (AJCC/UICC) TNM classification ( 6 7 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend systemic therapy as the primary treatment modality for this subgroup ( 8 9 10 Until recent years, our center had still been treating most ESCC patients with non-regional CLNM with definitive chemoradiotherapy that demonstrated limited efficacy in the management of non-regional CLNM. A cohort analyses report a dismal 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of only 12.6% in patients with supraclavicular CLNM treated with chemoradiotherapy alone ( 11 12 In patients with thoracic ESCC and supraclavicular CLNM, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has achieved a median progression-free survival (PFS) of up to 24 months ( 13 14 15 The advent of programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors has transformed the treatment landscape for both advanced and locally advanced ESCC. As to advanced stage ESCC, the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to extend survival ( 16 17 18 In summary, current guidelines recommend systemic therapy as the standard of care for ESCC with non-regional CLNM; however, this approach is often associated with high recurrence rate. Retrospective studies suggested that combining neoadjuvant therapy with surgical resection may confer survival benefits by reducing recurrence in select patients. Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of surgery in conjunction with modern immunochemotherapy for non-regional CLNM remain insufficiently studied. To address these gaps, this study retrospectively analyzes data from a single-center cohort of ESCC patients with non-regional CLNM who received nCIT, followed by surgery. The objective is to evaluate the impact of this multimodal strategy on survival outcomes, recurrence patterns, and treatment safety, thereby informing the optimization of therapeutic protocols for this high-risk population. Materials and methods Study population and ethical approval This retrospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Inclusion criteria consisted of histologically confirmed ESCC with CLNM (non-regional CLNM confirmed by fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy), completion of nCIT, and subsequent McKeown esophagectomy with standardized three-field lymphadenectomy encompassing cervical, mediastinal, and abdominal lymph nodes dissection. The included neoadjuvant regimen must consist of two chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms and one PD-1 inhibitor for 2–4 cycles. Exclusion criteria included: (1) presence of synchronous or metachronous malignancies; (2) distant metastases beyond cervical lymph nodes; (3) surgical approaches other than McKeown esophagectomy; (4) non-squamous histology subtypes (e.g., adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma); and (5) absence of histopathological confirmation of CLNM prior to treatment. Pretreatment evaluation All patients underwent comprehensive cervical ultrasonography to evaluate CLNM. Lymph nodes suspicious for malignancy—defined by a short-axis diameter ≥10 mm, round morphology, or loss of fatty hilum—were subjected to ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsy. Histopathological confirmation was performed subsequently. Surgical protocol All McKeown esophagectomies were performed by board-certified thoracic surgeons with a minimum annual volume of 50 esophagectomies. Key cervical lymphadenectomy included at least en bloc resection of bilateral cervical levels VI and IV. Depending on preoperative imaging and intraoperative findings, the extent of lymphadenectomy was expanded as clinically indicated. Pathological assessment Resected specimens were evaluated in modified Mandard criteria. Complete response (CR) was defined as absence of viable tumor cells, major pathological response (MPR) was defined as ≤& 10% residual viable tumor and partial response as 10–50%; no significant response as > 50%. Adverse event monitoring Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were retrospectively reviewed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v5.0) based on clinical records, blood tests and examinations majorly including CT scans and electrocardiograms Postoperative complications were classified according to the Clavien-Dindo system. Data collection and follow-up Clinicopathological variables were obtained from prospectively maintained institutional databases, including tumor location, clinical TNM stage (UICC/AJCC 8th edition), number of treatment cycles, pathological response, receipt of adjuvant therapy, OS, and disease-free survival (DFS). Classification of treatment related adverse events followed Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 ( 19 20 Statistical analysis Collected data were summarized using frequencies and percentages for categorical variables and mean values with ranges or standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables, as appropriate. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-parametric comparisons of continuous variables. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan Meier method based on follow-up records. All statistical analyses were conducted using R software(4.4.2). Results Baseline characteristics A total of 15 ESCC patients with CLNM underwent McKeown minimally invasive thoracoscopic esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy between January 2020 and November 2024 (  Table 1 Table 1 Characteristic of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for patients with non-regional CLNM.

The pathological TNM staging was classified as pTNM according to the 8th edition of the TNM classification for esophageal cancer. Pathological assessment revealed a substantial treatment response in both the primary tumor and CLNM. Among the 15 patients, 93.3% (14/15) achieved complete eradication of metastatic disease in all dissected cervical lymph nodes. A pCR (ypT0) in the primary tumor was observed in 33.3% (5/15) of patients, all of whom also achieved ypN0M0 status. Additionally, 53.3% (8/15) demonstrated an MPR.

As an exploratory sensitivity analysis, we divided these patients into two groups: one receiving the most frequently administered 3 cycles of camrelizumab, nab-paclitaxel and S-1 and the other receiving the remaining therapies, for comparison to test the robustness of the results. One-year DFS remained consistent (83.8% vs. 100%, p = 0.23) (  Figure 3 Figure 3 Kaplan-Meier survival curve: sensitivity analysis of 3 cycles regimen of camrelizumab, nab-paclitaxel and S-1.

Below is a heatmap displaying various clinical data points such as pathological response, clinical staging, and baseline statuses, with a color-coded legend illustrating different conditions and statuses. However, heterogeneity in lymph node response was observed. Among the 14 patients who achieved cervical lymph node clearance, four were pathologically staged as ypN+ due to residual disease in thoracic or abdomen regional lymph nodes. These patients did not experience recurrence during the follow-up period. Furthermore, the number of neoadjuvant therapy cycles (2–3 vs. 4 cycles) showed no statistically significant association with cervical lymph node pCR (p>0.999) or primary tumor pCR (p=0.600).

Discussion Our investigation demonstrates that nCIT induces substantial pathological responses in thoracic ESCC with non-regional CLNM, achieving a pCR rate of 93.3% in CLNM, a pCR of 33.3% in primary tumor (ypT0). The cohort exhibited exceptional 1-year DFS rates of 91.7%, a finding that challenges conventional survival expectations for this advanced-stage population. These results align with recent evidence suggesting that nCIT may enhance survival outcomes in esophageal malignancies. The observed therapeutic benefit likely arises from the dual action of nCIT, which not only facilitates tumor debulking but also modulates the immune microenvironment. The remarkable cervical nodal response rate observed in this pilot study of nCIT for ESCC with CLNM provides compelling insights into the potential synergy between chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in modulating the tumor microenvironment within metastatic lymph nodes. This response may be partly attributable to the heightened immunogenicity of lymph nodes relative to primary tumors, as reported by Xu et al. ( 21 21 22 23 In our analysis, four of 14 patients who achieved pCR in CLNM were found to have residual tumor in other regional lymph nodes. This differential nodal response to neoadjuvant therapy may reflect underlying tumor heterogeneity and microenvironmental influences. As demonstrated by Glaeser et al. ( 24 25 From a clinical standpoint, the observed nodal response rate challenges traditional paradigms in ESCC management. Current guidelines frequently regard non-regional CLNM—particularly supraclavicular metastases—as indicative of advanced disease, often limiting patients to non-surgical systemic therapy. However, our findings suggest that nCIT may effectively ‘downstage’ these cases, potentially redefining the boundary between locally advanced and metastatic ESCC. This raises the compelling possibility of curative-intent surgery in patients previously considered inoperable, although extended follow-up is necessary to determine whether nodal response confers long-term survival benefits. Importantly, the observed discrepancy between complete response in primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes underscores the need to further investigate organ-specific microenvironmental factors that may influence treatment efficacy. Regarding survival outcomes, only one death was recorded during the follow-up period and the patients had no disease recurrence The 1-year DFS rate of 91.7% observed in our cohort of patients with non-regional CLNM represents a favorable outcome, challenging established prognostic expectations for this advanced-stage population. In comparison, previous studies reported a 1-year and 5-year OS of 56.1% and 12.6%, respectively, for patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy in the setting of supraclavicular CLNM ( 11 13 Regarding recurrence patterns, although systemic therapy remains the predominant treatment paradigm, retrospective studies have reported high local recurrence rate of up to 61.5% following such regimens ( 12 26 27 Furthermore, the safety profile of nCIT in ESCC with non-regional CLNM represents a critical advancement in balancing therapeutic efficacy with tolerability. Our study demonstrates that the integration of PD-1 inhibitors with chemotherapy yields a manageable toxicity spectrum. All TRAEs were classified as grade 1–2 per CTCAE v5.0 criteria, with no grade ≥3 events or treatment discontinuations observed. The most common toxicities—anemia (46.7%) and arrhythmia (13.3%)—were primarily attributable to chemotherapy agents rather than immunotherapy. Postoperative complications occurred in 73.3% of patients, aligning with expectations for esophagectomy. The most common events included atelectasis, pulmonary dysfunction, and pneumonia. Importantly, only one Clavien-Dindo grade 4 complication (Pulmonary disfunction) was documented, and it was not associated with immunotherapy. Anastomotic leakage was observed in three patients (20.0%), and no chyle leaks were reported. Postoperative complications seemed frequent in the cohort, and this might be attributable to regimen of neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, which can alter tissue planes and increase operative difficulty, followed by a radical esophagectomy. Additionally, the procedure included a three-field lymphadenectomy, which is intrinsically associated with higher risks of pulmonary complications and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury due to the extensive dissection in the neck and superior mediastinum. However, every complication, including the most severe (Grade 4 pulmonary dysfunction), was promptly identified and managed through standardized protocols and the Grade 3 complications were resolved effectively, causing nil postoperative death. No postoperative death occurred. These findings underscore the necessity for enhanced perioperative support, such as prehabilitation programs targeting respiratory function. While derived from a single-center experience, the consistent safety signal across heterogeneous nCIT regimens suggests class-wide tolerability. Collectively, these results support the feasibility of delivering aggressive multimodal therapy without compromising patient safety. To further optimize patient selection and therapeutic outcomes in ESCC treated with nCIT, robust biomarker development is imperative. Although PD-L1 expression and TMB have demonstrated predictive value in advanced ESCC, their utility in the neoadjuvant setting remains limited ( 28 29 30 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first retrospective study to specifically evaluate the efficacy of nCIT in patients with ESCC and non-regional CLNM. Previous neoadjuvant studies have typically excluded this subgroup or classified them alongside patients with distant metastases. Our findings suggest that CLNM may represent an intermediate disease state—biologically distinct from distant metastases and potentially amenable to curative-intent strategies. The observed 1-year DFS rate of 91.7% supports this hypothesis and indicates substantial responsiveness of CLNM to immune-based therapies. Importantly, our study’s stringent inclusion criteria—requiring histopathological confirmation of CLNM prior to treatment—addresses a key limitation of previous investigations that relied solely on radiographic assessment. By replacing imaging-based assumptions with cytological and histological validation, our data contribute a higher level of evidentiary rigor to the evolving landscape of esophageal oncology. This approach highlights a potential therapeutic frontier in managing ESCC with nodal metastases. Despite these encouraging findings, several limitations constrain the immediate clinical applicability of this study. The small sample size (n=15) might lead to potential Type II errors and limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding the superiority of nCIT over existing standard-of-care regimens. The lack of long-term survival data also precludes assessment of sustained efficacy and potential late recurrences. Moreover, the study cohort may not adequately represent the broader ESCC population, as factors such as co-morbidity profiles, ethnic diversity, and sociodemographic variation were not comprehensively captured. These limitations underscore the need for larger, multicenter prospective trials to validate our findings. In conclusion, this retrospective pilot study highlights the transformative potential of nCIT in redefining treatment strategies for thoracic ESCC with non-regional CLNM. The remarkable nodal response rates observed challenges long-standing prognostic paradigms and provide a novel clinical framework for exploring immune-chemotherapy synergy in lymphatic metastases. Furthermore, the high 1-year DFS rate supports reclassifying such cases as potentially curable, advocating for the integration of multimodal nCIT-based approaches. The promising efficacy observed here supports the design of prospective, randomized phase II/III trials to validate these results and control for confounders. We also advocate for biomarker-integrated studies to identify patients most likely to benefit from nCIT.
