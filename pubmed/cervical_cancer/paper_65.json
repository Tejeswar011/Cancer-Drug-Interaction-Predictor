This review summarizes existing knowledge on implementation and outcomes of cancer screening for justice-involved individuals to identify opportunities for reducing cancer disparities. This scoping review identified 16 studies published between January 1990 and June 2021 that reported cancer screening rates and outcomes in U.S. jails or prisons or for individuals under community supervision. Most studies evaluated cervical cancer screening, while fewer studies evaluated screening for breast, colon, prostate, lung, and hepatocellular cancers. Although incarcerated women are often up to date with cervical cancer screening, only about half had recent mammograms and only 20% of male patients were up to date with colorectal cancer screening. Justice-involved patients are at high risk of cancer, yet few studies have evaluated cancer screening for these populations and screening rates for many cancers appear low. The findings suggest that intensification of cancer screening for justice-involved populations may address cancer disparities. cancer screening health care disparities incarceration jail prison criminal justice justice-involved scoping review pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
