Materials and methods Tumour regions were segmented using 3D-Slicer, and radiomic features were extracted via Python. LASSO regression selected prognostic features for model integration. Clinicopathological data include tumour length, lymph node positivity, differentiation grade, and neurovascular infiltration. Ultimately, a machine learning model was established by combining the screened imaging feature data and clinicopathological data and validating model performance. A nomogram was constructed for survival prediction, and risk stratification was carried out through the prediction results of the machine learning model and the nomogram. Survival analysis was performed for stage-based patient subgroups across risk stratifications to identify adjuvant therapy-benefiting cohorts. Results Patients were randomly divided into a 7:3 ratio of 368 patients in the training cohorts and 158 patients in the validation cohorts. The LASSO regression screens out 6 recurrence prediction and 9 recurrence pattern prediction features, respectively. Among 526 patients (mean age 63; 427 males), the model achieved high accuracy in predicting recurrence (training cohort AUC: 0.826 [logistic regression]/0.820 [SVM]; validation cohort: 0.830/0.825) and recurrence patterns (training:0.801/0.799; validation:0.806/0.798). Risk stratification based on a machine learning model and nomogram predictions revealed that adjuvant therapy significantly improved disease-free survival in stages II–III patients with predicted recurrence and low survival (HR 0.372, 95% CI: 0.206–0.669; p Conclusion Machine learning models exhibit excellent performance in predicting recurrence after surgery for squamous oesophageal cancer. Critical relevance statement Radiomic features of contrast-enhanced CT imaging can predict the prognosis of patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, which in turn can help clinicians stratify risk and screen out patient populations that could benefit from adjuvant therapy, thereby aiding medical decision-making. Key Points  There is a lack of prognostic models for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma in current research. The prognostic prediction model that we have developed has high accuracy by combining radiomics features and clinicopathologic data. This model aids in risk stratification of patients and aids clinical decision-making through predictive outcomes.

AUROC, area under the receiver operating characteristic; Rad-score, radiomics score Clinical outcome Recurrence in patients was assessed using postoperative CT, cervical lymph node ultrasound, PET-CT, and puncture biopsy. Recurrence patterns are categorised into two types: (1) local regional recurrence, including anastomotic recurrence and regional lymph nodes recurrence. Regional lymph nodes mainly include cervical lymph nodes, mediastinal lymph nodes and 6 groups of lymph nodes in the abdominal cavity (15 groups of diaphragmatic lymph nodes, 16 groups of para-cardiac lymph nodes, 17 groups of left gastric artery lymph nodes, 18 groups of common hepatic artery lymph nodes, 19 groups of splenic artery lymph nodes, 20 groups of coeliac dry lymph nodes); and (2) distant metastatic recurrence, refers to the reappearance of cancer in organs or tissues far from the original tumour site after initial treatment. Disease-free survival is defined as the period from surgery to either tumour recurrence, death, or the last known instance of being free from recurrence. Overall survival is defined as the time from surgery to death from any cause. In this study, the primary endpoint was the time to tumour recurrence, while the secondary endpoint was overall survival. Development of machine learning models The region of interest (ROI) for the tumour site in each patient’s CT image was mapped using 3D-Slice, generating a mask file co-imported with the original CT into Python (Fig. 2 t S2 39 S1 S2 Fig. 2 Appropriate CT images Evaluating model performance and the construction of a nomogram Maximise sensitivity and specificity by selecting the optimal threshold based on the Youden Index within the training cohort. Assess metrics including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. Additionally, a nomogram was constructed for individual survival assessment, which was used to stratify patients and identify those who would benefit from adjuvant therapy. Image features were obtained using the same screening method as described previously. Nine features crucial for individualised survival assessment were identified (Fig. S2 S2 Clinical application of the models After constructing the machine learning model and nomogram, we used the prediction results of these two models to stratify patients. Within each group, PSM was performed based on whether they received adjuvant therapy, and then screened out the patient population that could benefit from adjuvant therapy. Statistical analysis of data Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 25.0), employing the χ² test and Fisher’s exact test for qualitative data, and the independent samples t Result Patient cohort and baseline characteristics This retrospective study included 526 patients (average age, 63 years; 427 men). Among the patients, there were 427 males with an average age of 62.08. Within 3 years, 104 males relapsed, and 47 received neoadjuvant therapy before surgery. There were 99 females with an average age of 65; 21 females had recurrence within 3 years, and 7 had preoperative neoadjuvant treatment.

Predictive model performance Patients were randomly divided into a 7:3 ratio of 368 patients in the training cohorts and 158 patients in the validation cohorts. The logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM) models achieved robust discrimination in both training (AUC 0.826 and 0.820) and validation cohorts (AUC 0.830 and 0.825) (Fig. 3A 2 p 3B S3 Fig. 3 Model accuracy for predicting recurrence in the training and validation cohorts.

Specificity (ability to correctly exclude non-recurrence) improved in validation cohorts (logistic regression: 80.8%; SVM: 77.6%). Positive predictive values (PPV; probability of true recurrence) remained modest (46.2–50.0%), likely due to class imbalance. This performance supports their utility for prioritising low-risk patients in postoperative surveillance Survival analysis and prediction of recurrence patterns Kaplan–Meier analysis confirmed that patients predicted as non-recurrent by the model had significantly longer disease-free and overall survival (Fig. 4A, B 4C S4 S6 Fig. 4 Survival analysis of predicted outcomes and accuracy in predicting recurrence patterns.

This model has demonstrated advantages over radiomics models, producing consistent results across various clinical subgroups, highlighting its robustness. Clinically, this integration enables actionable risk stratification: high NPV (> 91%) permits reduced surveillance intensity for low-risk patients (e.g. fewer PET-CT scans), while recurrence pattern prediction (AUC 0.80–0.81) guides targeted imaging (e.g. prioritising endoscopic ultrasound for local-regional recurrence or PET-CT for distant metastases). Given that patients with similar clinical features can experience different outcomes, accurate prediction of recurrence is crucial for guiding decisions regarding postoperative adjuvant therapy. At the same time, we further used the prediction results of the model, combined with the prediction results of the constructed nomogram model, to stratify the risk of patients and screen the patient groups who benefited from postoperative adjuvant therapy. This facilitates the establishment of an individualised treatment plan. It is important to note that all patients underwent preoperative cervical lymph node ultrasound to exclude cervical lymph node metastasis, and no clearly enlarged cervical lymph nodes were observed on enhanced CT scans. In contrast, immediate surgical intervention in patients with preoperative cervical lymph node metastasis may not be optimal; such cases should instead be managed with neoadjuvant therapy to evaluate the efficacy of subsequent surgery. Most of our neoadjuvant patients receive chemoimmunotherapy for two cycles. Numerous studies have demonstrated that preoperative chemoimmunotherapy is associated with high pathological complete response (PCR) and R0 resection rates, as well as a favourable safety profile in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ 40 43 44 45 Predicting the recurrence of oesophageal cancer after surgery is a challenging task. Rahman et al used easy-to-collect clinical data to build a machine learning model to predict the recurrence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma within 1 year (AUC 0.805) [ 46 19 18 When constructing the machine learning model, we addressed the imbalance between recurrence and non-recurrence datasets by applying SMOTE to generate synthetic samples and balance the class distribution. This approach enhances the model’s ability to identify relapsed patients and mitigates overfitting. However, it also increases computational complexity. Postoperative adjuvant therapy is a standard treatment for locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma following surgery. However, the selection of suitable patients is largely based on clinicians’ empirical judgement, and there are no established criteria. In this study, patients were risk-stratified by integrating recurrence data with survival scores to identify those who might benefit from adjuvant therapy. The survival analysis found that patients with stages II and III in Class 1 did benefit from postoperative adjuvant therapy. This study has several limitations. First, it is a single-centre clinical trial with a relatively homogeneous patient population primarily from East Asia; patients from other regions may exhibit different clinical characteristics and pathological subtypes. Second, despite including a substantial number of patients, the study’s retrospective nature introduces fixation bias and confounding factors. Third, while the developed model performs adequately in predicting recurrence in patients with medium-stage tumours, its performance may decline in identifying recurrences in early-stage tumours (T1–2N0) as the number of such patients increases. Finally, when screening patients who benefited from chemotherapy, no significant difference in survival was observed between the two groups of patients (with or without postoperative adjuvant therapy) in Class 2, Class 3, and Class 4. This lack of difference may be attributed to the small sample size within each stage group after PSM. Future work should prioritise multi-centre clinical modelling and assess the generalizability of the model across diverse patient populations. Emphasis should be placed on enhancing recurrence risk identification in early-stage patients. Regarding the model, we did not refine the prediction of recurrence sites (e.g. subdividing local regional recurrence into anastomotic recurrence and regional lymph node recurrence) because the model consistently underperformed due to insufficient recurrence cases. In the future, we plan to enhance the model’s capability in this area. In conclusion, we have developed a stable and accurate machine learning model using preoperative CT images and clinicopathological data to predict recurrence and recurrence patterns in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma up to 3 years post-surgery. By outperforming radiomics-only models and enabling recurrence subtype prediction, our framework addresses a critical gap in ESCC management. These results can be utilised in prospective studies to evaluate their clinical utility and guide personalised medicine.
