Background Pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma (PHE) is a rare tumor that can involve multiple tissues, including the heart. Its diagnosis is often elusive due to its rarity and atypical presentations, such as exertional chest pain in otherwise healthy individuals. Case Summary A 40-year-old male athlete with no known comorbidities presented with chest pain during strenuous activities over 6 months. Exercise electrocardiogram demonstrated ischemic signs suggestive of left main coronary artery occlusion. Coronary computed tomography angiography revealed a heterogeneous mass partially occluding the circumflex artery and its branches. Additional radiological studies identified bilateral lung nodules, lytic bone lesions, and a muscle mass. A biopsy of the femur lesion confirmed the diagnosis of PHE. The patient experienced sudden death 3 months after diagnosis. Discussion This case highlights the diagnostic complexity of cardiac PHE, characterized by its rarity and atypical exertional chest pain, making it a notable contribution to the literature. Take-Home Messages Consider rare cardiac masses like PHE in young patients with exertional chest pain mimicking coronary artery disease, as these can be aggressive and require timely detection. Utilize advanced imaging and immunohistochemistry for prompt diagnosis of infiltrative cardiac masses, enabling early intervention despite management challenges.

He described symptoms of a burning discomfort restricted to the retrosternal region elicited only during moderate-intensity exercise. The pain lasted for 20 minutes, resolving after rest. He denied other symptoms, such as fatigue, faintness, or nausea. The patient remained asymptomatic in activities of daily living, with good functionality, also denying weight loss, fever, symptoms of anemia, and chest or bone pain. Physical examination showed no abnormalities. The resting electrocardiogram was normal, yet the exercise electrocardiogram demonstrated ischemic signs highly suggestive of left main coronary artery disease ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Exercise Electrocardiogram (A) Resting: Sinus rhythm, 87 beats/min. (B) Exercise: Sinus rhythm, 148 beats/min, 6 mm ST segment depression in D2, D3, aVF, V 3 4 5 6 Past Medical History There was no history of dyslipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use. He denied recent trauma and a family history of cardiovascular disease. His father had colon cancer at the age of 70. Differential Diagnosis The primary differential diagnoses of cardiac ischemic signs are atherosclerotic disease, vasospasm, coronary aneurysm, myocardial bridge, congenital anomalies, myopericarditis, coronary intramural hematoma, and extrinsic compression of coronary arteries. Investigations A transthoracic echocardiogram showed an echo-dense mass (3.0 × 2.0 cm) in the left atrial appendage. Coronary computed tomography angiography demonstrated a 3.3-cm heterogeneous solid mass with irregular contours in the left atrial appendage occluding the proximal segment of the circumflex artery ( Figures 2 3 4 Figure 2 3-Dimensional Volume Rendering of a Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography Expansive heterogeneous mass, with irregular contours and poorly defined limits, measuring approximately 33 × 29 × 32 mm, in the topography of the left atrial appendage, causing its obliteration, with apparent adjacent myocardial invasion. This mass involves the proximal segment of the circumflex artery (arrows) and the origin of the first and second marginal branches.

Figure 4 Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography Single-vessel coronary rendering of the circumflex artery highlighting the close relationship between the mass (red arrows) and the coronary obstruction (yellow arrows). Blood tests for tumor markers and protein electrophoresis with immunofixation were within normal limits. Staging was performed using computed tomography (CT) and positron emission–CT (PET/CT), which revealed a cardiac mass with a high maximum standardized uptake value ( Figure 5 Figures 6A to 6C Figure 6D Figure 5 Cardiac Positron Emission–Computed Tomography Positron emission–computed tomography fusion imaging reveals focal areas of expansive formation in the left atrium and left atrial appendage, with a maximum standardized uptake value of 8.52. Figure 6 Bone and Muscle Metastasis (A) Right femur radiograph: Posterior cortical lytic lesion on the femoral shaft of the right femur, measuring approximately 5.6 cm. (B) Left femur radiograph: Cortical lytic lesion on the femoral shaft of the left femur, measuring approximately 4.8 cm. (C) Femoral region positron emission–computed tomography: Axial, lytic lesions on the right femur shaft (maximum standardized uptake value of 16.31) and on the left femur shaft (maximum standardized uptake value of 15.19) showing high glycolytic metabolism. (D) Positron emission–computed tomography: Axial, nodular hypodense formation on the right gluteus minimus (maximum standardized uptake value of 5.76) and lytic lesion on the left ilium (maximum standardized uptake value of 7.10). Biopsies of the left lung nodule and right femur yielded spindle cells of uncertain nature. Immunohistochemistry was negative for sarcoma, melanoma, and dendritic cell tumors. The sample was sent to the Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, for further evaluation. The specimen showed a cellular neoplasm composed of sheets of plump spindle cells with palely eosinophilic cytoplasm ( Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 7 Histopathology of the Tumor Specimen from femur biopsy showing cellular neoplasm composed of sheets of plump spindle cells with palely eosinophilic cytoplasm.

(D) Diffuse positivity for AE1/AE3. Management Outcome and Follow-Up The patient was discharged for outpatient follow-up with internal medicine and oncology. He was also evaluated by neurosurgery, who prescribed a cervical collar due to cervical instability. In subsequent appointments, the patient remained asymptomatic, with no complaints of pain, weight loss, or fractures. He had a good performance status (Karnofsky Performance Status 90%). However, physical activity was interrupted due to cardiovascular and pathological fracture risk. The prescription of palliative chemotherapy was discussed. However, the patient passed away suddenly at rest 9 months after the onset of symptoms. Discussion PHE is a rarely metastasizing endothelial neoplasm that predominantly affects young adult males. 1 PHE is often asymptomatic, with approximately 50% of patients experiencing localized pain. 2 3 Cardiac masses encompass a spectrum of benign and malignant etiologies, with over 90% of primary cardiac tumors being benign, such as myxomas (45%) and lipomas (20%). 4 5 6 1 , 7 Cardiac imaging is pivotal for characterizing cardiac masses. Echocardiography is often the initial modality, but coronary computed tomography angiography and cardiac MRI provide detailed insights. In this case, MRI revealed low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, consistent with PHE and other secondary cardiac tumors. Suspicious findings such as rapid growth, local invasion, or pericardial effusion should raise concern for malignancy. Identifying a potential primary site using modalities like PET scans is essential for secondary tumors. Surgical resection is the main treatment for localized PHE, 8 9 , 10 This case is remarkable for some reasons. First, the patient's presentation with exertional chest pain as the sole symptom is unprecedented in the literature. Second, the aggressive behavior observed, including rapid progression, contrasts with the typically indolent course of PHE, which rarely metastasizes. These findings highlight the importance of considering rare entities in the differential diagnosis of cardiac masses, particularly in young patients with atypical symptoms. Conclusions PHE is a rare soft-tissue tumor that predominantly affects young male adults. Its rarity and histological overlap with other tumor types, such as epithelioid sarcoma, make diagnosis challenging, mainly when presenting as a cardiac mass. This case report describes a unique presentation of PHE with exertional chest pain and an aggressive clinical course, emphasizing the need for awareness of this entity in the differential diagnosis of cardiac masses. Prompt diagnosis, leveraging histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and advanced imaging, is essential for guiding treatment and improving patient outcomes.
