Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted including 137 HPV-positive postmenopausal women who underwent colposcopy, ECC, and subsequent LEEP. Variables analyzed included age group, HPV genotype (16/18 vs. non-16/18), transformation zone type, cytology results, and ECC findings. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of CIN2 + confirmed by LEEP histology. Results CIN2 + prevalence was 27.7% (38/137); ≥CIN3 occurred in 26/137 (19.0%). In multivariable analysis, high-grade cytology (adjusted OR [aOR] 4.65; 95% CI 1.92–11.30; p p p p Conclusion In postmenopausal women with persistent hrHPV, high-grade cytology and TZ3 are the main drivers of CIN2+ risk. ECC is most useful as a rule-out test (high NPV), whereas expedited diagnostic-therapeutic LEEP may be considered when ASC-H/HSIL coexists with TZ3 in women without fertility desire. The association between non-16/18 genotypes and CIN2+ observed here warrants confirmation in larger multicentre cohorts.

According to the most recent estimates (GLOBOCAN 2022), approximately 660,000 new cases and 350,000 deaths attributable to this disease were recorded in 2022 [ 1 2 3 4 The persistent infection from human papillomavirus (HPV) high -risk oncogenic constitutes a necessary, but not sufficient factor, for the progression towards high -grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (CIN2+) and, in a minority of cases, towards invasive carcinoma [ 5 6 7 8 9 In countries with organized screening programs, the incidence of cervical cancer tends to decrease after a peak observed between 35 and 39 years old [ 10 11 12 13 In postmenopausal women who have not regularly participated in screening, the risk of invasive cancer can be increased (50–64 years, with rates respectively equal to 16.5 and 14.8 cases per 100,000 women) [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 21 The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ECC in detecting CIN2 + lesions in HPV- positive postmenopausal women using LEEP histology as the reference standard. Additionally, it examines the association between high-risk HPV infection and the presence of. CIN2 + lesions, with the goal of identifying subgroups of patients who may benefit most from the. routine use of ECC. Methods Anonymized data from a dedicated database were analyzed for 196 postmenopausal patients referred for colposcopy due to persistent HPV infection at the secondary care center of the University Hospital of Catania and the Humanitas Center in Catania between 2019 and 2022. A retrospective observational study was conducted. All patients were postmenopausal and a type 3 transformation zone (TZ3). To be enrolled, patients had to meet the following inclusion criteria: age ≥ 45 years, positive and persistent HPV test for high oncogenic risk genotypes, colposcopy with identification of the transformation zone evaluated according to international colposcopic criteria, performance of endocervical curettage (ECC), performance of excisional treatment (LEEP) with histological confirmation. Exclusion criteria were: previous history of cervical conization, pregnant women, incomplete clinical or histological data. Persistent infection was defined as the detection of the same HPV genotype at ≥ 2 consecutive visits spaced ≥ 6 or ≥ 12 months apart. Incidental or transient HPV infection was defined as the detection of a new HPV genotype. Cervical cytology was interpreted according to the Bethesda System, while histological diagnoses of excised specimens were made using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Both included centers used the same technique for cervical canal study and the same molecular technique for HPV DNA detection and genotyping. The identified genotypes were divided into HPV 16/18 and non-16/18 HPV genotypes (HPV 31, 33, 35, 45, 39, 51, 52, 58, 59, 66 and 68). A positive ECC was defined as a CIN2 + finding (CIN2, CIN3, or carcinoma in situ). Findings ≤ CIN1 were classified as negative ECC. Only 137 patients met the inclusion criteria and their clinical data were collected: age, HPV genotype, Transformation Zone Type, ECC and histological examination of the cone. The data were analyzed anonymously. This study conforms to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2013. The research was conducted through a retrospective review of medical records. In accordance with current legislation on observational studies (March 20, 2008), the study protocol was submitted to the Catania 1 Ethics Committee of the Catania University Hospital. The committee did not request any modifications to the protocol and deemed informed consent unnecessary, as the study involved only retrospective analysis of anonymized clinical data. Endocervical curettage (ECC) For ECC, a sharp Kevorkian curette without a basket was inserted into the endocervical canal. Gentle pressure was applied to the tip, and the curette was moved back and forth along the length of the endocervix while being simultaneously rotated in a circular motion to sample the entire circumference of the canal. Sampling of lesions extending beyond the external cervical orifice was deliberately avoided to minimize contamination with ectocervical tissue. A rapid rotational movement was applied while withdrawing the curette from the canal, ensuring that all tissue and cellular material were captured within the curette chamber. ECC: excluded from the model to avoid incorporation bias; its diagnostic performance is calculated separately using sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV. Cytological evaluation Using the Bethesda System, cytological assessment yielded the following classifications: NILM (Negative for Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy, indicating a normal result), ASC-US (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance), ASC-H (Atypical Squamous Cells—cannot exclude High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion), LSIL (Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion), HSIL (High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion), AGC (Atypical Glandular Cells), and others. Cytological findings were categorized as normal, inadequate sampling, or abnormal. NILM cases and those indicating infection were classified within the normal range. For analysis, cytology recoded as: low grade = ASC-US + LSIL; high grade = ASC-H + HSIL. HPV DNA testing and genotyping Exocervical cytology samples were collected and placed into ThinPrep solution. The samples were sent to the laboratory for DNA extraction and viral DNA genotyping, performed via genetic amplification followed by hybridization with genotype-specific probes capable of identifying most genital-region HPV genotypes. These included high-risk HPV genotypes (16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, and 82), low-risk genotypes (6, 11, 40, 43, 44, 54, and 70), and genotypes of undetermined risk (69, 71, and 74). The commercial assay used was the MAG NucliSENS easyMAG system (bioMérieux SA, Marcy-l’Étoile, France). HPV genotypes were further categorized into HPV 16/18 and non-16/18 high-risk HPV (hrHPV). For complete genotyping, the Inno-LiPA HPV genotyping kit was used, capable of identifying 32 genotypes, clinically validated for primary screening according to the Meijer criteria [ 22 Colposcopy Colposcopy was performed using a Zeiss OPM1F colposcope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) with the application of acetic acid and Lugol’s iodine solution. Any colposcopic abnormalities were classified according to the terminology proposed by the International Federation for Cervical Pathology and. Colposcopy (IFCPC), which grades findings by severity into three levels: abnormal transformation zone (ATZ) grade 1 (ATZ1), grade 2 (ATZ2), or invasive cancer. The visibility of the squamocolumnar junction and the transformation zone was also assessed. The transformation zone was classified as type 1, 2, or 3: type 1 when the squamocolumnar junction was fully visible; type 2 when fully visible but extending into the endocervical canal; and type 3 when not visible and located deep within the canal, making it impossible to determine its endpoint. This classification is relevant for determining the type of excision required. LEEP Procedure LEEP was performed under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting by experienced personnel under colposcopic guidance. For type 3 transformation zones, a Fisher loop was used, with the loop size adjusted to the volume of the cervix. A single cone was excised, measuring between 15 and 20 mm in length, to ensure complete removal of the transformation zone. Histological examination of the cervical cone was performed, and margin status was evaluated. Cone margins were considered positive if the distance between CIN2 + lesions and the resection surface was less than 1 mm. Oriented specimens, formalin-fixed, 2–3 mm serial sections, EE staining and p16 immunohistochemistry according to local standards. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the characteristics of the study population. Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation or as median and interquartile range, as appropriate. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages. To verify any differences between women with a CIN2 + outcome on LEEP and those with a ≤ CIN1 outcome, Pearson’s χ² test was used, or, when the expected number in at least one cell was < 5, Fisher’s exact test. Comparisons were made for: age (≥ 51 vs. 45–50 years), cytology (low grade = ASC-US/LSIL; high grade = ASC-H/HSIL), viral genotype (HPV 16/18 vs. other-HPVs non-16/18), and transformation zone type (TZ3 vs. TZ1-2). The association between clinical covariates and the endpoint (CIN2 + on LEEP) was explored with univariate logistic regression. Odds ratios (ORs), their 95% confidence intervals, and p-values (Wald test) were calculated. To avoid incorporation bias, the variable “positive ECC” (defined as a finding ≥ CIN2 on ECC) was not included in the primary model, as it shares the same histological criterion as the outcome. For ECC, with a diagnostic cutoff of CIN2+, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and overall accuracy were calculated, with 95% CIs obtained using the Wald approximation. Variables with a p-value < 0.10 in the univariate analysis were included in a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent predictors of CIN2+. Statistical significance was set at p Results Of the 196 patients enrolled, 38 were excluded due to non-diagnostic ECC samples caused by insufficient material. An additional 11 cases were excluded due to uncertain interpretation of the LEEP cone histology and 10 cases due to inconclusive ECC histology. Thus, the final study cohort consisted of 137 patients, aged between 45 and 72 years. The characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 The overall prevalence of CIN2 + at baseline histology (LEEP) was 27.7% (38/137). Within these, lesions ≥ CIN3 were 26/137 (19.0%).

After multivariate adjustment, hr-HPV genotypes other than 16/18 showed an almost three-fold increased probability of CIN2 + compared to 16/18 (OR = 2.98; 95% CI 1.31–6.78). It is important to note that the odds ratio does not coincide with the risk ratio: the observed risk of CIN2 + increased from 16.4–36.8%, corresponding to an increase of approximately 2.2-fold and an absolute increase of 20% RR Table 4 Table 4 Distribution of genotypes in CIN3 + cases Histologies after LEEP HPV 16/18 HPV non-16/18 CIN3 ( n 5 16 AIS ( n 1 0 IA1 ( n 1 0 IA2 ( n 0 1 Invasive Ca ( n 0 2 Total ( n 7 19 Transformation zone type had an independent impact: transformation zone type 3 (TZ3) was associated with an increased risk of CIN2+ (univariate OR 3.58; 95% CI 1.28–10.0; p p p p Diagnostic performance of ECC (defining CIN2 + positive on curettage) was: sensitivity 73.7% (28/38), specificity 77.8% (77/99), PPV 56.0% (28/50), and NPV 88.5% (77/87), with overall accuracy 76.6%. These values indicate that a negative ECC substantially reduces the probability of significant lesion (particularly useful as a “rule-out” test in low-moderate risk settings), whereas a positive ECC has only moderate confirmatory value (Table 5  Table 5 Diagnostic performance of ECC (cut-off = CIN2+) Index Value CI 95% Sensitivity 73,7% 59,7–87,6% Specificity 77,8% 69,6–86,0% PPV 56,0% 42,3–69,7% NPV 88,5% 81,8–95,2% Accuracy 76,6% — These numbers show that ECC, with a negative predictive value close to 90%, is particularly useful for excluding CIN2 + in patients with TZ3, while the more modest PPV reflects the presence of focal lesions not always sampled by the endocervical smear. In the clinical multivariate model (without ECC to avoid incorporation bias), the covariates that remained independently associated with CIN2 + were: high-grade cytology (aOR ≈ 4.65), TZ3 (aOR ≈ 3.05), and non-16/18 genotypes (aOR ≈ 2.52; 95% CI 1.08–5.90; p 6  Table 6 Multivariate logistic regression (clinical model; outcome = CIN2 + on LEEP) Independent Variable aOR CI 95%  p Age ≥ 51 vs. 45–50 1,28 0,57–2,85 0,55 High-grade cytology vs. low-grade 4,65 1,92–11,30 < 0,001 Genotype hr-HPV non-16/18 vs. 16/18 2,52 1,08–5,90 0,032 Transformation Zone TZ3 vs. TZ1–2 3,05 1,05–8,85 0,040 Discussion The overall detection rate of CIN2 + in our cohort was 27.7%, a result comparable to previous studies examining postmenopausal women with persistent HPV infection. Some authors have reported a prevalence of CIN2 + of 19% among women with persistent HPV infection, negative cytology and TZ3 [ 23 24 25 Other cohorts have shown rates ranging from 20 to 40% depending on HPV genotyping and cytological status [ 26 Our data clearly confirm the prognostic advantage of high-grade cytology in postmenopausal women with persistent HPV infection. In the presence of an ASC-H/HSIL finding, the risk of a CIN2 or higher lesion at conization is fivefold higher compared to low-grade abnormalities, even after adjusting for age, viral genotype, and transformation zone type. The magnitude of the association is very close to that described by Hammer et al. in the Kaiser Permanente cohort study, where an HSIL pattern conferred a hazard ratio of around 4 for CIN3 + in HPV-based primary screening [ 13 Transformation zone type 3 (TZ3) emerged as the second independent determinant (aOR ≈ 3.0). The mere presence of a type 3 transformation zone tripled the odds of identifying CIN2 + on LEEP, consistent with the experience of Chu et al., who emphasized that the depth of the squamocolumnar junction makes complementary procedures such as ECC or randomized biopsies indispensable [ 19 More unexpected is the effect of viral genotypes: infections with hr-HPVs other than 16/18 showed double the odds for CIN2 + compared to genotypes 16/18 and showed a similar trend for ≥ CIN3. The literature attributes the highest oncogenicity for invasive cervical neoplasms to HPV16/18 genotypes [ 27 29 30 35 36 37 12 29 38 From an operational standpoint, we evaluated ECC as a diagnostic test (cut-off = CIN2+) but excluded it from the predictive model to avoid incorporation bias (predictor and outcome would share the same histological endpoint), which is why we evaluated its performance separately. ECC confirmed its usefulness as a rule-out test: with a sensitivity of 74% and a negative predictive value close to 90%, a negative curettage makes the presence of occult CIN2 + unlikely, in line with the meta-analysis by Hu et al. [ 20 39 Finally, chronological age was not found to be an independent predictor once other factors were controlled, confirming the observations of Kjær et al. that age-related risk disappears when viral persistence and screening history are considered [ 7 Clinical implications The results reinforce the idea that, in postmenopausal women with persistent hr-HPV, high-grade cytology (ASC-H/HSIL) associated with a type 3 transformation zone constitutes a risk profile that justifies an immediate excisional approach, without intermediate diagnostic steps. This is consistent with the “Risk-Based Management” risk thresholds introduced by the 2019 ASCCP guidelines and the most recent Canadian recommendations proposing direct LEEP in the presence of HSIL and TZ3 in menopausal patients [ 40 Strengths and limitations A substantial strength is the use of a unified histological gold standard (LEEP) for all participants, which reduces the risk of endpoint misclassification. Reclassification of cytology into two levels (low vs. high grade) follows current clinical practice and improved the statistical power of the model. The main limitations include the retrospective design and the moderate number of patients ( n Future directions Prospective, multicenter studies enrolling a larger number of postmenopausal patients will be useful, allowing for: a fine stratification of single hr-HPV genotypes to verify whether the signal observed in “minor” types is confirmed; validation of a simplified decision-making algorithm (“HSIL/ASC-H + TZ3 → Immediate LEEP”) with long-term clinical endpoints, including reduced diagnostic time and impact on quality of life; the integration of viral or host biomarkers (e.g., E6/E7 mRNA, gene methylation) that could refine risk stratification beyond traditional morphological and virological parameters.
