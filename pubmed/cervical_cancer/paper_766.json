While the current literature focuses on expressly hesitant parents, few studies have examined parents with “high intent”, or those indicating they definitely will vaccinate and have had the opportunity but not yet vaccinated their adolescents. Our objective was to differentiate characteristics of mothers with high intent from those who already vaccinated their adolescents using various socioeconomic, previous vaccine decision-making, and healthcare provider relationship-related variables. English-speaking mothers or female guardians of adolescents ages 11-14 years living in low HPV vaccine uptake states within the U.S. in September 2018 were recruited from a national survey panel as part of a larger study. We assessed HPV vaccine status of their adolescents and categorized respondents into two categories: Already Vaccinated and High Intent. We assessed differences using a multivariable logistic regression model. Among 2,406 mothers, 18% reported high intent vs. 82% already having vaccinated. Mothers with high intent were more likely to identify as non-Hispanic White ( p=0.01 p<0.001 p<0.001 p<0.001 human papillomavirus HPV HPV vaccine adolescent vaccines parental hesitancy vaccine delay pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
