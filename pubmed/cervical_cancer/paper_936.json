We found lipoxygenases-5 (ALOX5) was upregulated in renal tubular cells in IRI-induced AKI; however, its underlying mechanism is not clear. In this study, we explore the function of ALOX in IRI-induced AKI using human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) and C57BL/6 mice. Alox5  ALOX5 contributes to the tubular injury in IRI-induced AKI through enhancing ferroptosis in the renal tubular cells and might be a novel target for the prevention and treatment of IRI-induced AKI.

We explored the role and underlying mechanisms of ALOX5 in this setting and found that benzbromarone (BBR), which is commonly used to lower serum uric acid, could target ALOX5 and protect renal tubular cells from IRI-induced injury by inhibiting ferroptosis. Our findings contribute to understanding the role of ALOX5 in AKI and demonstrate that BBR might be a novel strategy to treat AKI. Results ALOX5 increased in the renal tubular cells in IRI-induced AKI and was associated with ferroptosis To explore potential DEGs in IRI-induced AKI, we first performed bioinformatics analysis and verified the results in mice model (Fig. 1A GSE192532 1 ALOX5 1B 1C Fig. 1 Alox5 was closely associated with renal tubular injury in IRI-induced AKI in a mouse model. A B GSE192532 C D E F To verify the increased expression of ALOX and the potential involvement of ferroptosis from bioinformatic analysis, we then examined the kidney tissue of the IRI-induced AKI mice model. Renal tubular injury evidenced by enlarged renal tubule lumen, missing brush border, and disorderly arranged nuclei was observed in H&E and PAS staining sections (Fig. 1D 1E 2 1F Pathological examination and transmission electron microscopy of renal tissue from the ATN patients showed the increased expression of ALOX5 in renal tubular cells and morphological characteristics of mitochondria relevant to ferroptosis (Fig. 2 3 2 3 Fig. 2 ALOX5 was increased in renal tubular cells in a patient with acute tubular necrosis.

A B C n D E F H n p p BBR improved ferroptosis by reducing lipid peroxide accumulation mediated by ALOX5 To further explore the underlying mechanism of the protective effect of BBR, we examined the downstream effect of the interaction between BBR and ALOX5 in HK-2 cells (Fig. 7A 50 8 7B 7C 7D 7E 7F, G 7H–K Fig. 7 Benzbromarone reduced lipid peroxide accumulation induced by hypoxia/re-oxygenation treatment in HK2 cells via inhibiting ALOX5. A B n C n D E F G n H K n p p Discussion In this study, we found that in IRI-induced AKI, ALOX5 was up-regulated in the renal tubular epithelial cells and exacerbated the accumulation of lipid peroxides, which in turn enhanced ferroptosis in the renal tubular cells and finally contributed to the cell injury. BBR was able to interact with ALOX5 and reduced the accumulation of lipid peroxide, thus alleviating the cell damage caused by IRI via inhibiting ferroptosis and improving the renal function of experimental mice. The mammalian lipoxygenase family consists of six isoforms (ALOXE3, ALOX5, ALOX12, ALOX12B, ALOX15, and ALOX15B) with different substrate specificities. ALOX5 is an immunoreactive metabolic enzyme that is widely expressed in neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Lipoxygenase oxidizes PUFAs and is involved in a variety of biological reactions, including inflammation and lipid peroxidation 23 24 Lipid substances are both metabolites of the ferroptosis pathways and toxic molecules that promote ferroptosis 25 26 27 29 29 30 32 BBR is a widely used pharmacological agent for reducing serum uric acid levels. It functions by inhibiting the expression of urate transporter 1 in the renal proximal tubule, thereby decreasing the reabsorption of uric acid by the kidneys, enhancing uric acid excretion, and consequently lowering blood uric acid levels 33 34 35 In addition to its ability to lower serum uric acid levels, BBR demonstrates therapeutic efficacy through a variety of mechanisms 33 36 37 There are several limitations to be mentioned. First, we did not perform conditional gene knockout in animal experiments. The development of renal tubular epithelial cell-specific ALOX5 conditional knockout mice can more accurately illustrate the role of ALOX5 in the renal tubular injury in IRI-induced AKI. Second, at this stage, the target binding sites between ALOX5 and BBR were derived through molecular simulation and have not been validated by bench experiments, for example, site-specific knockout methods. Further clarification of the speculative interaction between ALOX5 and BBR might help to develop safer and more specific molecules, and will be our next step of work. Third, this study exclusively examined the IRI-induced AKI model, as the initial bioinformatics analysis indicating ALOX5 upregulation was derived from proteomic analysis of IRI-induced AKI. Therefore, we utilized this model to investigate the role and mechanism of ALOX5 in tubular injury in AKI. It would be advantageous to validate whether ALOX5 exhibits similar effects in other AKI models, as this would contribute to a comprehensive profiling of ALOX5 in AKI and represents a future direction. Fourth, this study serves as an initial exploration into the role of ALOX5 in renal IRI; however, it lacks comprehensive validation from a clinical standpoint. Therefore, it is premature to conclusively identify ALOX5 as a therapeutic target for AKI. Our subsequent objective is to establish a clinical cohort to investigate the potential of ALOX5 as a specific target for ameliorating renal tubular injury in AKI. Fifth, known side effects of BBR, including liver toxicity and coumarin interactions, were not investigated; however, these were not within the scope of this work. Materials and methods Bioinformatics analysis We searched for keywords ‘AKI’ or ‘IR-AKI’ in the GEO database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GSE192532 GSM5750692 GSM5750693 GSM5750694 GSM5750695 GSM5750696 GSM5750697 n 38 p http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb/current/ 39 https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn 40 http://swisstargetprediction.ch https://ctdbase.org Reagents Benzbromarone powder (#S4221), Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, #S7243), and RSL3 (#S8155) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals (USA). The ALOX5 antibody (#ab169755), GPX4 antibody (#ab125066), and xCT antibody (#ab175186) were obtained from Abcam (USA). ALOX5 recombinant protein (H00000240-P01) was purchased from Abnova (USA). Cell culture and treatment Human Kidney-2 (HK-2) cells were purchased from the cell bank of the Typical Culture Preservation Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and were cell lines rather than primary cells. The purchased HK-2 cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Hyclone, USA) in a cell incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 41 42 2 2 2 Cell viability Cell viability was evaluated with CCK8 assay. 10 μl of CCK8 solution (DOJINDO, Japan) was added to each well of a 96-well plate with cells ready for test and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Transfection The HK-2 cells were transiently transfected with ALOX5siRNA (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China) using the transfection kit (RiboBio, Guangzhou, China) or an overexpression plasmid target ALOX5 (Yunzhou Biosciences, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufactures’ instructions. Cells were harvested at 48 h after transfection. Lipid peroxidation assay HK2 cells were evenly distributed on 24-well slide plates. After appropriate treatment, lipid peroxidation was detected using liperfluo reagent (DOJINDO, L248, Japan) at a concentration of 2 μM according to the instructions. The nuclei were stained with DAPI. Fluorescence imaging was performed under a confocal microscope (Zeiss L900). Human subjects Kidney biopsy tissue samples were obtained from three patients diagnosed with acute tubular necrosis (ATN). The inclusion and exclusion criteria are presented in Supplementary Table 1 Animals and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) modeling Wild-type male C57BL/6 mice (weighing 20–25 g, aged 8–10 weeks) were purchased from Chengdu DOSSY Experimental Animal Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China). Male Alox5 full knockout (Alox5 - / - n 43 Animal BBR treatment BBR powder (Selleck, S4221, USA) was dissolved in a mixture of 95% corn oil and 5% DMSO (v/v) (10 mg/ml) and diluted into the needed concentrations. The DMSO concentration in the final solutions administered to mice was 0.1% DMSO (v/v). For the BBR treatment, the mice were injected intraperitoneally with BBR at a fixed time once daily for two consecutive days (25 or 50 mg/kg/d), and the surgery was performed after the second drug injection 44 43 45 46 Renal function testing The collected blood samples were centrifuged to obtain serum. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (CREA) were measured with the corresponding reagent kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Company, China). Pathological examinations Pathological examinations include light microscopy and TEM examinations. All pathological outcomes were assessed blindly by two senior renal pathologists (co-authors: C.S.P. and Y.Q.), and the discrepancies were resolved via discussion. H&E, PAS, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescent staining The kidney specimens were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned at a thickness of 2 μm for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-schiff (PAS) staining. For immunohistochemistry (IHC), sections of kidney tissue were incubated with antibodies against ALOX5 (A2877, 1:200) at 4 °C overnight, then incubated with isotype-matched rabbit IgG (PV-9001) at 37 °C for 1 h, and incubated with 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogenic liquid (Zsbio, China). The nuclei were re-stained with hematoxylin (Solarbio, China). Semiquantitative assessments of the immunohistochemical staining intensities were conducted using the ImageJ software as reported before 47 Oxidized fatty acid metabolite analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and mass spectrometry (MS) Fresh mouse kidney samples were harvested and frozen immediately in a −80 °C refrigerator. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry was performed to detect oxylipins in the kidney tissues. Raw data were processed using MassHunter workstation software (version B.08.00, Agilent). The details of UHPLC-MS analysis are provided in the Supplementary Materials and Methods. Western blot analysis Kidney tissues and cells were lysed with a mixture of RIPA and PSMF (RIPA:PMSF = 100:1). Subsequently, 5× protein loading buffer (Soleibao, Chengdu, China) was added to the lysed liquid and boiled at 100 °C for 5 minutes. After electrophoresis and transfer onto PVDF membranes, the prepared samples were blocked with 5% milk for 2 h. The membranes then incubated with primary antibodies to ALOX5 (1:1000, Abcam, AB169755 AB175186 AB125066 Molecular interactions We used the Octet RED96e system (ForteBio, USA) to identify small molecules that interact with ALOX5 in commercial compound libraries (Selleck L3300 Compound Libraries) by compound screening. ALOX5 recombinant protein (Abnova, Catalog # H00000240-P01) was labeled with biotin using the Biotinylation kit (Genemore, Prod#G-MM-IGT) and immobilized on the SSA sensor (Cat# 18-5057). Then we used a mixture of PBS, 0.02% Tween 20, and 1% DMSO to dissolve small molecules in the drug library to 100 μM and preliminarily screened the interactions between small molecules and the ALOX5 protein. Drugs showing interactions with ALOX5 evidenced by Kd values less than 10 −5 Molecular docking The molecular docking was used to predict the potential binding of BBR and ALOX5. Briefly, we loaded the sdf structure of BBR from the PubChem database as a ligand. The receptor protein ALOX5 (UniProt ID: P09917 https://www.rcsb.org/ 48 49 Statistics and reproducibility Statistical analysis was performed using Graphpad Prism (version 9.3.1). Descriptive data were expressed by mean ± standard deviation (SD). Differences were compared using an unpaired Student’s t p In conclusion, this study reported that ALOX5 is upregulated in the renal tubular cells and exacerbates the accumulation of lipid peroxides, which in turn enhances ferroptosis in the renal tubular cells and finally contributes to the tubular injury in IRI-induced AKI. BBR is able to specifically interact with ALOX5 and reduces the accumulation of lipid peroxide, thus alleviating the cell damage caused by IRI via inhibiting ferroptosis and improving renal function. Our findings indicate that ALOX5 might be a novel target for the prevention and treatment of IRI-induced AKI.
