Methylglyoxal (MG), which is a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound, has been increasingly recognized due to its role in the pathogenesis of kidney injury, particularly in diseases such as diabetic nephropathy and hypertensive nephropathy. MG promotes advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation and directly impairs cell function. MG levels are significantly increased in various renal diseases. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between MG and ferroptosis, which is a form of cell death involving iron-dependent lipid peroxidation (LPO), during kidney injury. Animal and cellular experiments were conducted to verify that ferroptosis occurred after MG treatment, and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to analyse changes in gene expression profiles after MG exposure. A mouse model that mimicked human kidney injury was established by administering folic acid, and the MG and D-lactate levels in serum and tissues were measured.

AKI, which is characterized by a sudden decrease in renal function, is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates, and it is increasingly being recognized as a risk factor for the development of CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) ( Bucaloiu et al., 2012 Coca et al., 2012 Hoste et al., 2018 Chawla et al., 2014 Venkatachalam et al., 2015 Guzzi et al., 2019 Gao et al., 2020 See et al., 2019 Kurzhagen et al., 2020 Methylglyoxal (MG) is a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound that is primarily produced as a byproduct of glycolysis, and its levels increase under conditions of high blood glucose, such as in diabetes ( Nigro et al., 2017 Phillips and Thornalley, 1993 Christopher et al., 1995 Thornalley, 1990 Lin et al., 2011 Huang et al., 2013 Yu et al., 2016 Lin et al., 2021 Shaheen et al., 2014 Giacco et al., 2014 Brouwers et al., 2011 Thornalley et al., 2003 Rabbani and Thornalley, 2015 Kong et al., 2024 Rabbani and Thornalley, 2018 Brouwers et al., 2014 Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AKI and CKD ( Friedmann Angeli et al., 2014 Linkermann et al., 2014a Stockwell et al., 2017 Dixon et al., 2012 Rabbani and Thornalley, 2018 Linkermann et al., 2014b Stockwell et al., 2017 Linkermann et al., 2014b This study aimed to investigate the relationship between MG-induced kidney injury and ferroptosis by conducting animal experiments and cell experiments to verify that ferroptosis occurs after MG treatment. Additionally, RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to analyse changes in gene expression profiles after MG exposure to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in MG-induced ferroptosis. These findings may provide new insights into the mechanism underlying kidney injury while also identifying potential molecular targets for the development of strategies to treat this condition.

The protein concentration in each group was determined and adjusted using the BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific, USA). Next, denatured protein samples (15 μg per lane, diluted in 5× loading buffer and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA) using a Pyxis Gel Processor (China). The PVDF membranes were incubated with 5% skim milk (Solarbio Life Science, China) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Blocked PVDF membranes were then incubated with the following primary antibodies in the primary antibody dilution buffer (Beyotime, China): anti-GPX4 rabbit IgG (1:2000 dilutions, cat. no.67763-1-lg, proteintech, China), anti-SLC7A11 rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilutions, cat. no.A13685, ABclonal, China), anti-GLO1 rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilutions, cat. no.15140-1-AP, proteintech, China), anti-SEPHS2 rabbit IgG (1:1000 dilutions, cat. no.14109-1-AP, Abclonal, China) and anti-β-actin mouse IgG (1:20000, cat. no.66009-1-lg, Proteintech, China). β-actin was used as an internal reference to determine the loading weights of the proteins. After incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, the membranes were sufficiently washed with TBST and incubated with goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:5000 dilutions, cat. no. SA00001-2 Proteintech, China) secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (1:5000 dilutions, cat. no.SA00001-1 Proteintech, China) for 1 h. Sufficiently washed membranes were imaged with a freshly prepared ECL hypersensitive chemiluminescence solution on the ChemiDoc XRS+ gel imaging system (Bio-Rad, USA). Flow cytometry HK-2 cells were treated with 600 μM MG for 24 h in 12-well plates (Nest, China), cellular LPO was observed. Cells that were treated with 100 μM cumene hydroperoxide (CH) for 2 h served as the positive control group. The cells were subsequently treated with trypsin and subjected to centrifugation at 450 × g for 5 min to collect the cells against the inner wall of the tube. The, the treated cells were washed twice with warm PBS and stained with C11-BODIPY for 30 min at 37 °C, following the manufacturer’s instructions. The labelled cells were subsequently washed again with warm PBS. The emission peaks of the oxidized and reduced forms of C11-BODIPY were then detected by flow cytometry (AttuneTM NxT, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at 488 nm and 561 nm. HK-2 cells were treated with 600 μM MG for 24 h in 12-well plates (Nest, China), and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were observed. Cells that were treated with 200 μM hydroperoxide for 2 h served as the positive control group. The cells were subsequently treated with trypsin and subjected to centrifugation at 450 × g for 5 min to collect the cells against the inner wall of the tube. The treated cells were then washed twice with warm PBS and stained with 10 μM DCFH-DA for 30 min at 37 °C, following the manufacturer’s instructions. The labelled cells were subsequently washed again with warm PBS. The emission peaks of the oxidized and reduced forms of DCFH-DA were then detected by flow cytometry (AttuneTM NxT, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at 488 nm. HK-2 cells were seeded in 12-well plates (Nest, China), and viability was assessed after a 24-hour treatment with 600 μM MG, preceded by pretreatment with Ferrostatin-1(Fer-1), Z-VAD-FMK(Z-VAD), or 3-Methyladenine (3-MA). Cells that were treated with absolute ethanol served as the positive control group. The cells were subsequently treated with trypsin and subjected to centrifugation at 450 × g for 5 min to collect the cells against the inner wall of the tube. The treated cells were washed twice with hot PBS and stained with 5 μM propidium iodide (MCE, China) for 30 min on ice, following the manufacturer’s instructions. The emission peaks of the oxidized and reduced forms of propidium iodide were then detected by flow cytometry (AttuneTM NxT, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at 545 nm. All flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (v10.8.1; FlowJo LLC, OR, USA). Histological and cellular imaging To systematically evaluate the pathological role of methylglyoxal (MG) in kidney injury, we employed a combined histopathological and cellular imaging strategy. Kidney tissues from mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned at 4 μm thickness. Sections underwent deparaffinization in xylene, rehydration through graded ethanol series, and heat-induced antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (pH 6.0, 95 °C, 10 min), followed by blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. For immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against 4-HNE (1:50, cat. no. MA5-27570, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) or MG-H1 (1:50, cat. no.STA-011, Cell Biolabs, USA), followed by application of biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:200, cat. no.GB23303, Servicebio, China) and streptavidin-HRP complexes. Diaminobenzidine (DAB, Servicebio, China) was used for chromogenic development with hematoxylin counterstaining, and slides were digitally scanned using an Olympus VS200 whole-slide scanner (×20 objective). For immunofluorescence (IF) analysis under identical primary antibody conditions, Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, cat. no.111-585-003, Jackson, USA) were applied for 1 h at room temperature, with nuclear counterstaining achieved using DAPI-containing mounting medium (Servicebio, China), and images captured via Olympus BX53 fluorescence microscope (40× oil immersion lens). Parallel cellular-level investigations utilized HK-2 cells plated in glass-bottom dishes (2 × 10 5 2+ MG measurement Kidney tissues were homogenized in PBS to prepare 10% kidney homogenates. The MG levels of the kidney homogenates were determined according to the instructions provided with the reagent kits. The values were standardized to the total weights of the kidney tissues. To visualize cellular MG, HK-2 cells were plated in 6-well plates (Nest, China) at a density of 5 × 10 5 2 2 RNA-seq RNA integrity was assessed using the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Library preparation for transcriptome sequencing included the preparation of both non-strand-specific and strand-specific libraries. Messenger RNA was purified from total RNA using poly-T oligo-bound magnetic beads. After fragmentation, first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers, and second-strand cDNA synthesis was subsequently performed. For strand-specific libraries, dUTP was used instead of dTTP. Libraries were prepared after end repair, A-tailing, adapter ligation, size selection, amplification, and purification. These libraries were quantified with a Qubit instrument and real-time PCR, and their size distributions were assessed with a bioanalyzer. HK-2 cells were treated with 600 μM MG for 24 h, with three replicates per treatment group. Moreover, a control (Ctrl) group, including three replicates of HK-2 cells without MG treatment, was also included. This setup allowed the assessment of MG-induced effects on gene expression. Clustering and sequencing were conducted on the Illumina platform, employing the “Sequencing by Synthesis” method. Fluorescently labelled dNTPs, DNA polymerase, and adapter primers were added to the sequencing flow cell for amplification. As each sequencing cluster extended its complementary strand, the addition of each fluorescently labelled dNTP released a corresponding fluorescence signal. The sequencer captured these signals and converted them into sequencing peaks through computer software; thus, the sequence information of the target fragment was obtained. Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The significance between two groups was evaluated using Student’s t-test. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed for comparisons among multiple groups. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Following ANOVA significance (p < 0.05), Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc Results The MG concentration is elevated during renal injury First, we induced a mouse kidney injury model by intraperitoneal injection of folic acid (250 mg/kg in 0.3% sodium bicarbonate solution).

Discussion MG, which is a highly reactive dicarbonyl compound, may be recognized as an important contributor to the development of kidney injury. In addition, previous studies have shown that MG and D-lactic acid levels are significantly increased in aristolochic acid-induced and STZ-injected mouse models of kidney injury ( Lin et al., 2011 Lin et al., 2021 in vivo Luengo et al., 2019 Kong et al., 2024 Bataille et al., 2018 Lakhia et al., 2018 Guder and Ross, 1994 Lee et al., 2015 Daenen et al., 2018 Flemming et al., 2018 Legouis et al., 2022 Legouis et al., 2022 13 Our investigation of the mechanisms by which MG affects renal TECs revealed significant cytotoxic effects associated with MG exposure. In HK-2 cells that were treated with different concentrations of MG, a cell viability assay revealed that MG reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that MG exerts a direct cytotoxic effect on these cells. Although the concentration in the human body may not reach the concentration used for exogenous MG treatment, some studies have shown its toxic effect on cells ( Sena et al., 2012 Shopit et al., 2020 A significant decrease in the reduced GSH content was observed in the renal tissues of mice with renal injury, indicating a reduction in antioxidant capacity. This finding is further supported by decreased expression of glutathione peroxidase and cystine/glutamate antiporter, as well as increased levels of MDA, suggesting the occurrence of LPO in injured kidney tissues. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence techniques confirmed the upregulation of 4HNE, which is a specific end product of ferroptosis, further confirming its involvement in kidney injury, as previously demonstrated ( Ide et al., 2021 Wang et al., 2021 In vitro 2 2 2 2 The direct promotion of ferroptosis in renal TECs by MG was investigated to evaluate its role in this form of cell death. Our findings revealed a significant increase in intracellular LPO after MG treatment, as confirmed by flow cytometry analysis and live-cell imaging. This increased LPO, which is a hallmark of ferroptosis, suggests a direct association between MG exposure and the induction of this specific type of cell death. This study elucidates the pivotal role of MG in bridging oxidative stress and ferroptosis during kidney injury. As demonstrated in Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 in vitro in vivo In terms of the inhibitory effect of MG on selenoproteins and its impact on GSH metabolism, our study demonstrated that MG not only forms a complex with GSH but also significantly hinders the biosynthesis of selenoproteins, which serve as crucial components of antioxidant defence mechanisms and play active roles in the glutathione peroxidase GPX4. RNA-Seq analysis of renal TECs that were treated with exogenous MG revealed a decrease in the expression of genes that are involved in selenoprotein synthesis. This observation was further supported by a noticeable decrease in the expression level of selenophosphate synthetase, thus indicating a clear inhibitory effect of MG on selenoprotein production. Selenium compounds play pivotal roles in the synthesis of key antioxidants, such as glutathione peroxidase. Our findings suggest that the MG-mediated inhibition of selenoprotein production may contribute to the observed oxidative stress and ferroptosis in renal injury. Additionally, we observed decreased expression levels of genes involved in GSH synthesis, including the reduced activity of glutathione synthetase (GSS), Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase Catalytic (GCLC), and glutathione S-transferase (GSTS), after MG treatment. This suggests that the effects of MG extend beyond binding to GSH and involve the inhibition of GSH resynthesis and enzymes that play key roles in its synthesis, thereby promoting ferroptosis. Conclusion Taken together, our findings establish the key role of MG in the pathogenesis of kidney injury, highlighting how kidney injury leads to increased MG levels, which in turn promote ferroptosis and exacerbate kidney injury ( Figure 6 in vitro in vivo FIGURE 6 Schematic overview of MG-induced ferroptosis during kidney injury. The Figure depicts the mechanistic link between methylglyoxal accumulation and ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells during kidney injury. MG, a byproduct of heightened glycolysis, promotes oxidative stress and impairs selenoprotein synthesis, which is crucial for antioxidant defence. This leads to glutathione depletion, lipid peroxidation, and ultimately ferroptosis, thus exacerbating kidney injury. This figure was designed by the authors. Diagram illustrating the biochemical pathway related to kidney injury stress. It shows glycolysis leading to glucose metabolism, selenoprotein synthesis, and the role of glutamate and cystine in ferroptosis. Key elements include lipid ROS, GSH, and GPX4.
