Based on accumulating experimental evidence in recent years, beginning with metabolic reprogramming driven by carcinogenic signals, the accumulation of key metabolites, represented by lactate, continuously affects cellular plasticity and alters the epigenetic landscape. As a new post-translational modification of histone, histone lactylation not only changes the nucleosome structure, but also regulates chromatin dynamics and gene expression, which is closely related to the poor prognosis of tumors, contributing to immune escape, immune monitoring and angiogenic events in tumor progression. Before the discovery of histone lactylation in 2019, there was a lack of systematic understanding of the lactate regulation of tumor metabolism, immune effects and microenvironmental homeostasis. From metabolic changes to stable gene expression, histone lactylation has become an important entry point in tumor research, connecting the relationship network of metabolic reprogramming, Tumor microenvironment (TME) and epigenetic modification. It represents an important conceptual link between metabolism and epigenetics, and emerging evidence suggests it may be a promising area for understanding tumor progression and developing targeted therapies. In this review, we focus on how tumor cell metabolic reprogramming reshapes the epigenetic landscape into histone lactylation. Besides, we discussed the plasticity of tumor metabolism regulated by histone lactylation in reverse, involving TME biological processes such as immunity and metabolism. Finally, we reviewed the new molecular targets and targeted therapeutic strategies of histone lactylation for cancer treatment. Elucidating these problems will provide theoretical basis for further research and clinical application in this field in the future. metabolic reprogramming epigenetic modification histone lactylation tumor targeted therapy The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

As an important oxidizing substrate in the aerobic energy supply system involved in energy metabolism ( 1 2 3 4 5 The epigenome refers to the dynamic heritable chemical changes in the genome that occur independently of the DNA sequence, and these modifications can affect gene expression. Protein posttranslational modifications (PTM) are modifications that add or remove specific chemical groups to one or more amino acid residues on the translated protein. This covalent modification can regulate protein activity, localization, folding state, and interaction with other biological macromolecules ( 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic changes have been widely observed in cancer and are seen as important factors contributing to cancer progression. Changes in the ways and processes of metabolism of primary fuels such as sugars, amino acids and fats in tumor cells are usually caused by epigenetic changes. As a measure of lactate level, histone lactylation is closely related to cell metabolism. At the same time, it drives the association network between metabolic reprogramming and tumor, regulating the metabolic plasticity of tumor cells ( 13 14 15 16 In this study, we focused on how tumor cell metabolic reprogramming reshapes the epigenetic landscape into generate histone lactylation, comprehensively reviewing and summarizing the available evidence on tumor lactate metabolism and histone lactylation driving metabolic reprogramming in reverse. We summarized in detail that lactate regulates tumor metabolism and microenvironment, and histone lactylation promotes tumor progression. At the same time, focusing on the new perspective of histone lactylation, we review new options for tumor targeted therapy and summarize the recognized challenges and future prospects of this promising area of research. Based on this systematic and comprehensive framework, we expect to reconstruct the overall landscape of the impact of histone lactylation on tumor progression from multiple perspectives, providing a basis for further research and clinical application of histone lactylation. 2 Warburg effect and tumor lactate metabolism 2.1 Impaired glucose intake and the Warburg effect The energy supply of the organism is indispensable to the life activities of the organism, and glucose is the main energy source of cell proliferation, of which the metabolic process is the main way for cells to produce energy and biosynthetic materials. In normal life, Cellular glucose uptake is regulated by a variety of signals, which often from the epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and insulin stimulation ( 17 18 19 At the beginning of the 20th century, German physiologist Warburg observed that tumor cells do not use oxidation as the main energy supply mode even when oxygen supply is sufficient, but cooperate with glucose consumption to produce lactate with low efficiency GP to complete energy supply, which is called Warburg effect ( 20 21 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2.2 Formation, transport and consumption of lactate in tumor cells 2.2.1 Lactate formation Lactate is an important substrate for histone lactylation and an inevitable product of GP. In fact, lactate is mainly formed through two modes of GP and glutamine metabolism. GP is a series of enzymatic processes involved. Firstly, glucose transporter transports glucose to cells, and hexokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of sugars to form glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which activates glucose, facilitating its further participation in synthesis and catabolism. Subsequently, phosphofructokinase 1 catalyzes irreversible phosphorylation of various sugars to form fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Finally, the pyruvate kinase converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate ( 9 30 31  Figure 1 Figure 1 The formation, transport and consumption processes of lactate. Glucose produces lactate through the glycolytic pathway, which is transported extracellular by monocarboxylate transporter and consumed in mitochondria by pyruvate dehydrogenase. +P, phosphorylation; HK, hexokinase; F6P, D-Fructose 6-phosphate; PK, pyruvate kinase. Diagram illustrating glucose metabolism. Glucose is phosphorylated to G6P and converted through F6P, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvic acid to lactate by enzymes HK and PK. Lactate is transported by MCT into the mitochondria, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA, enters the TCA cycle, and produces ATP via the electron transport chain. 2.2.2 Lactate transport With the further study of lactate metabolism, we have a more comprehensive understanding of the process of lactate transport. lactate can be produced by most tissues of the body, the concentration of lactate in human serum is 1–3 mM at rest, 15mM at intense exercise, and the level of lactate in tumors can be as high as 40 mM ( 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 2.2.3 Lactate consumption Excessive lactate accumulation is dangerous and can lead to a condition called lactate acidosis. Therefore, the body has evolved a set of rapid metabolic mechanisms of lactate clearance and consumption to maintain lactate homeostasis. In TME, hypoxic cell populations produce large amounts of lactate through the Warburg effect. Lactate is transported to adjacent normal oxygen-supplying cells through MCT, and oxidative phosphorylation occurs, consuming lactate to produce energy. Lactate is irreversibility consumed by Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), entered the tricarboxylic acid cycle by using acetyl-Coenzyme A as raw material and metabolized by kidney and liver. The horizontal relationship between PDH and GP flux is a potential influence on lactate consumption. As a component of the catalytically active complex, PDH is inhibited by E1α subunit and reduced coenzyme I to regulate the increase of circulating lactate level ( 39 40 41 2.3 Lactate regulates tumor metabolism and microenvironment With the deepening of lactate research in recent years, researchers have increasingly found that lactate plays an important role in the progression of tumor diseases, rather than just the role of metabolic waste as previously thought ( 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 TME is an acidic, inflammatory and hypoxic cellular environment composed of tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating immune cells, tumor-associated fibroblasts, glial cells, endothelial cells, immune factors and cytokines ( 51 52 53 Lactate also significantly affects the expression of PD-1 and effector T cells, leading to immune escape and increasing the difficulty of chemotherapy treatment ( 54 + 55 + + + 56 57 3 Histone lactylation drives metabolic reprogramming and cancer association networks 3.1 Discovery and advanced understanding of histone lactylation Epigenetic modification includes histone modification and DNA modification, which can regulate a series of downstream effects by activating or silencing genes. Therefore, in recent years, epigenetic modification has been regarded as an important entry point for the treatment of diseases, especially in the study of tumors ( 58 59 8 60 62  Figure 2 Figure 2 The process of histone lactylation and the mechanism of its action on tumor. In the process of histone lactation, “Writers” refer to proteins responsible for adding lactating modification groups to histones, “Readers” refer to proteins capable of recognizing and binding specific lactating modification groups, and “Erasers” refer to proteins responsible for removing lactating modification groups from histones. PCSK9 can affect the level of histone lactation modification by regulating cellular lactate metabolism and the activity of histone lactation modification enzymes. KCNK1 can promote histone lactation by facilitating cellular glycolysis and lactic acid production. A variety of proteins affect tumor progression through active or passive participation in histone lactylation. Diagram illustrating the role of lactate in tumor metabolism and immune regulation in the tumor microenvironment. The left side shows lactate production from glucose, involving “writers,” “readers,” and “erasers” like PCSK9, KCNK1, and YTHDF2. The right side lists different cancers, such as ocular melanoma, glioblastoma, and colorectal cancer, indicating relevant genes. There is growing evidence that lactate interferes with tumor progression in a variety of ways. It not only comes from direct metabolic pathways, but also plays a key role in tumor progression through complex mechanism networks through epigenetic modification. In fact, a number of findings in recent years seem to tell us that histone lactylation has important research significance for the research of inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, nervous system diseases and other diseases, rather than just confined to the tumor research level ( 63 9 64 65 66 3.2 Comparison of histone lactylation with other modifications Histones can undergo a wide range of PTM, and the epigenome refers to heritable, dynamic chemical changes in the genome that occur independent of DNA sequences. Histone modification refers to A series of modifications on the amino acid residues of histones, which can include a variety of types, such as lactate is responsible for the lactation of histones, metabolism-related enzymes participate in the regulation of histone phosphorylation, and acetyl-CoA affects the acetylation of histones ( 67 68 69 70 71 72 11 14 3.3 Histone lactylation regulates the plasticity of tumor metabolism The occurrence of tumor diseases is related to the disruption of the balance of gene transcription by the modification of histone lactylation. A study conducted by Li et al. ( 73 60 74 Compared to previous studies, with the help of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, Song et al. ( 75 76 77 3.4 Histone lactylation regulates immune cell function in TME Immune cells play an important role in TME, participating in anti-tumor immune response, immune surveillance, immune regulation and immune escape. Combined with the existing research evidence, istone lactylation can regulate the metabolic process of immune cells in TME, inhibiting the proliferation of natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and CD8+ T cells, and mediating immune escape events ( 78 79 80 81 82 83  Table 1 Table 1 The mechanism of histone lactylation involved in the regulation of tumor.

The PFKP lactication in SW480 cells and colon cancer tissue directly attenuates the activity of the enzyme. The distuned lactic acid/la-PFKP negative feedback ring plays an important role in the progression of colon cancer.

( 90 4 histone lactylation provides a new direction for tumor targeting therapy The discovery of histone lactylation has become hot point in the field of cancer research. Lactation not only enriches the understanding of tumor pathogenesis and progression, but also has a wide range of clinical application prospects. In particular, with the discovery of new tumor therapeutic targets for histone lactylation-specific genes such as NR6A 1, OSBP 2 and UNC 119B, new drug development has a broader idea ( 91 43  Table 2 Table 2 Research on drugs targeting histone lactylation.

( 96 4.1 Target lactate breakdown or synthesis to reduce histone lactylation As the direct driving factor of histone lactylation, reducing lactate formation and accelerating lactate decomposition are undoubtedly the first choice for new treatment. Demethylzeylasteral and royal jelly acid have both been shown to reduce intracellular lactate levels in a dose-dependent manner, interfering with the metabolic stress-related histone H3 histone lactylation to inhibit the progression of associated tumors ( 92 93 97 98 99 101 95 LDHA is highly expressed and activated in many tumors, which is related to the malignant progression of tumors ( 102 90 103 104 96 105 4.2 Inhibit the function of lactate transporter and reduce histone lactylation Inhibitors that block the function of lactate transporters have shown some potential in tumor therapy. This is because tumor cells typically have a high rate of glycolysis, even when oxygen is plentiful. To maintain intracellular pH balance and eliminate lactate, tumor cells rely on lactate transporters to move lactate out of the cell ( 106 107 108 109 110 111 5 Conclusion and prospect There’s been a lot of progress in the epigenetics of tumors over the last long time. More and more powerful computational tools and experimental studies have contributed to the explosive development of this field, providing us with a new research idea for a more comprehensive view and analysis of tumors ( 112 113 Histone lactylation regulates a series of dangerous events such as tumor angiogenesis, metabolic reprogramming and immune escape, contributing to the occurrence and progression of tumors. Targeted studies based on histone lactylation will provide more options for the treatment of tumors in the future. In fact, as a new field of hot research, the basic and clinical research of targeted histone lactylation still has a long way to go. There are still many questions to be answered: (a) Can therapies targeting histone lactylation work synergically with other epigenetic modification phenomena to produce a greater effect than one plus one? (b) Can we find more therapeutic sites for histone lactylation, thereby increasing the specificity of therapeutic drug selection? (c) Can we find more natural products that act on histone lactylation? In the future, considerable effort will be required to answer these questions individually. Therefore, considering the crucial role of histone lactylation in the development process of diseases and the construction of corresponding treatment strategies, it has become a potential target with great application prospects in the field of disease treatment. However, it should be clearly stated that the research currently conducted around the core direction of “achieving disease treatment by regulating the level of histone lactylation” is still generally in the exploratory initial stage and has not yet formed a mature theoretical system and technical path. In particular, we need to pay particular attention to the important role that lactate plays in this process. Not only has it become an important hub to intricately link various factors that affect the initiation and development of tumors, but also the research on lactate can directly benefit clinical research, which will provide unlimited ideas and possibilities for the precision treatment of tumors.
