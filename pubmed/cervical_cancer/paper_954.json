The measurements indicate that the diffusion spread around the Alpha‐DaRT source is radon‐dominated. With the estimated values of DL model parameters extracted from these studies, a feasible treatment plan can be established that provides therapeutic dose coverage across the hexagonal Alpha‐DaRT source lattice. While subcutaneous mouse models potentially differ from human tumors in terms of vascularity and the TME, the range of the measured parameter values for leakage and diffusion lengths can be implemented as a starting point for 3D dose calculations around implanted Alpha‐DaRT sources based on post‐implantation CT images for various tumor histologies. Such plans should consider the effect of tumor‐specific parameters and the required biological effective dose when setting source spacing and activities. The presented data are a valuable guide for initial planning in Alpha‐DaRT clinical protocols, with an increasingly growing number of studies being planned for the near future.

IL‐78‐12‐2018(E) and IL‐44‐08‐2021 (E)]. BALB/c mice (6–12 weeks old) were obtained from Envigo (Jerusalem, Israel). NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice (6–12 weeks old) were obtained from the breeding colony of Ben‐Gurion University, Beer‐Sheva, Israel. C57BL/6 mice were bred “in‐house” at the animal facility of Ben‐Gurion University. Mice were inoculated subcutaneously with cells in 100–200 μ L A1 FIGURE A1 Experimental sequence: (i) tumor inoculation—cells were injected subcutaneously in 0.1–0.2 mL PBS; after a period of 8–50 days of tumor development (depending on the cell line growth kinetics), (ii) the tumors were treated with a single Alpha‐DaRT source insertion into the middle of the tumor while mice were anesthetized. Four to 5 days later, (iii) the tumors were removed and cut in the middle, and the source was extracted and placed in 1.5 mL tube full of water. The tumors were weighed, placed in 20‐mL scintillation bottles on dry ice and taken to the Hidex gamma counter for activity measurement (iv). Following source removal, both halves of the tumor were subjected to histological frozen‐sectioning by LEICA CM 1520 cryostat (v). The 10 μ m μ m Alpha‐DaRT source insertion Alpha‐DaRT sources made out of 316LVM stainless steel loaded with 3 μ Ci A1(ii) Frozen section preparation Four to 5 days post Alpha‐DaRT treatment, the tumors were excised (as a whole). Each tumor was cut in two halves, at the estimated location of the source center, perpendicular to the source's insertion axis, as shown in Figure A1(iii) − 80 ∘ C A1(iv) Following the activity measurement, both halves of the tumor were subjected to histological frozen sectioning by a LEICA CM 1520 cryostat (Buffalo Grove, IL, USA), Figure A1(v) μ m μ m A1(vi) A.2 Phosphor imaging calibration The conversion from gray‐level (GL) to photo‐stimulated luminescence (PSL) level is given by the image reader and is of the form I PSL = exp ( a I GL + b ) a , b I < A2 To account for possible machine‐dependent differences in image production, raw PSL images recorded by the phosphor‐imaging system were cross‐calibrated with the iQID camera  40 XY lensdistort()  46  A3 FIGURE A2 Phosphor imager PSL‐to‐activity calibration curve.
