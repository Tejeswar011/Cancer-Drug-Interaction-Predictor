Introduction Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally [ 1 2 3 4 5 Lactobacillus plantarum Muribaculaceae 6 Limosilactobacillus reuteri Enterococcus faecium Bifidobacterium animalis 7 8 Bile salt hydrolase (BSH, EC 3.5.1.24) is prevalent in the mammalian gut microbiota, including Lactobacillus Clostridium Bacteroides Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Escherichia coli Lactobacillus salivarius 19 Bacteroides Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that when the BSH recombinant strain YB81 was administered to PGF mice with antibiotic-depleted gut microbiota, this strain did not exhibit cholesterol-lowering effects. However, in SPF mouse models with normal gut microbiota, the same strain demonstrated significant cholesterol-lowering effects. These results indicate that the gut microbiota directly contributes to the cholesterol-lowering effects of certain BSH from Lactobacilli [ 20 Building on these findings, this study aims to elucidate the cholesterol-lowering mechanisms of the recombinant strain YB334 by analyzing BSH enzyme alterations in the structure and function of the gut microbiota. We seek to uncover novel mechanisms of cholesterol regulation by lactic acid bacterial BSH from the perspective of host-microbe interactions, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for developing probiotic therapies against hypercholesterolemia. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Strain and Culture All strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus Limosilactobacillus Bifidobacterium 21 r 2.2. Animal Experimentation All mice were obtained from Gempharmatech Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China). The animal study protocol was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Nanjing Normal University (Approval Number: SYXK 2020-0047; Approval Date: 15 February 2024), and all experiments were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (specific pathogen-free, SPF grade) were used in this study. They were housed in SPF conditions at the Experimental Animal Centre of Nanjing Normal University under a 12 h light/dark cycle with temperature maintained at 23 ± 2 °C and relative humidity at 55 ± 5%. The normal diet (ND) and high-cholesterol diet (HCD; containing 15% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate) were purchased from Jiangsu Synergy Pharmaceutical Bioengineering Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China). Following one week of adaptive feeding, the mice were divided into two groups: the control group received an ND, while the experimental group was fed an HCD to induce hypercholesterolaemia. Six mice were allocated to each group. Thereafter, the experimental group received a daily oral gavage of 200 μL of a bacterial suspension (1 × 10 9 Preparation of bacterial suspensions: Recombinant lactic acid bacteria (NB5462 and YB334): Single colonies were inoculated into liquid medium and cultured overnight for 12 h. The cultures were then diluted in fresh MRS medium to an OD 600 nm 600 nm 600 nm Bifidobacterium pseudolongum v v The experimental period lasted for six to seven weeks, during which mouse body weight was monitored weekly. Upon completion of the gavage period, mice were fasted for 12 h (ad libitum access to water was maintained) and subsequently anesthetized with diethyl ether. Blood samples were collected via retro-orbital bleeding. Thereafter, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Immediately following euthanasia, the liver, ileum, ileal contents, and duodenum were aseptically collected, placed in sterile, nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes, and snap-frozen at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. 2.3. Serum Biochemical Parameter Analysis Whole blood was collected from mice via retro-orbital bleeding. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the samples were centrifuged at 1500× g 2.4. Liver Histological Analysis Liver tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and imaged using an upright optical microscope (Nikon Eclipse E100, Tokyo, Japan). All histological procedures were performed by Wuhan Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China). 2.5. Metagenomics Analysis Metagenomic DNA was extracted from mouse feces using the E.Z.N.A. ® https://cloud.majorbio.com To identify microbial taxa with significant abundance differences between groups, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was employed, with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) score threshold of >2. A custom reference database of bile salt hydrolase (BSH) genes was compiled by querying the UniProt protein database. Beta-diversity between experimental groups was assessed via principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on Bray–Curtis distances. Statistical significance of inter-group differences was determined using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with p 2.6. Isolation and Identification of B. pseudolongum in Mouse Feces Fecal samples were obtained from mice in the HCD + YB334 cohort and suspended in PBS. The samples were then serially diluted and plated onto modified MRS agar supplemented with mupirocin lithium salt and cysteine hydrochloride. Following incubation, bacterial colonies were isolated. Genomic DNA was extracted, and the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using the universal bacterial primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R (5′-TACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were purified and sent to Sangon Biotech for Sanger sequencing. The resulting sequences were analyzed using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) to identify homologous bacterial sequences ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST 2.7. BSH Activity Assays The strain’s bile salt-degrading activity was assessed using the indophenol method [ 22 600 nm For the analysis of bile acids in murine fecal samples, Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed using an ExionLC AD liquid chromatography system coupled to a QTRAP ® 2.8. Effect of Addition of Crude Extract of YB334-BSH Enzyme on the Growth of Different Strains of Bacteria Strain preparation was conducted as previously outlined for animal experiments, with an uninduced control group established and cultivated for 20 h. The bacterial culture was centrifuged at 8000× g v v g Various test strains (BPL-1, BPL-2, BPL-4, BA-6, BL-4, BL-7, J5, J16, and L2) were initiated and cultured in their appropriate media until the logarithmic phase was reached. A 1% ( v v 2.9. TCA/CA Bile Salt Tolerance Two distinct bile salts, taurocholate acid sodium salt (TCA) and cholic acid (CA), were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich to evaluate the bile salt tolerance of the test strains [ 23 v v g 2.10. RNA Isolation and RT-qPCR Total RNA was isolated from mouse ileum and liver tissues using the RNAiso Plus Kit (Takara Biomedical Technology, Beijing, China). Following extraction, cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript™ RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara Biomedical Technology, Beijing, China). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was then performed on a LightCycler System using TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Takara Biomedical Technology, Beijing, China), with cDNA as the template. The amplification protocol followed the manufacturer’s instructions for the TB Green ® −ΔΔCT Table 2 2.11. Statistical Analysis All experimental data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (M ± SD). Graphical representation and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 9.5). Comparisons among multiple groups were conducted by one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for assessing significant differences between individual groups.

Effect of Crude Extract of Recombinant Bacterium YB334-BSH on the Growth of Different Strains BPL-1, BPL-2, BPL-4, BA-6, BL-4, BL-7, J5, J16, and L2 were introduced into MRS + TCA medium supplemented with either inducible (+) or non-inducible (−BSH crude extracts derived from YB334 recombinant bacterial cultures and subsequently incubated for 5 h. MRS + TCA medium was used as a control. The experimental findings revealed three distinct scenarios: Figure 3 B. pseudolongum 6 7 PX061997 Figure 3 B. pseudolongum AS shown in Figure 3 B. adolescentis B. longum As shown in Figure 3 L. johnsonii L. reuteri 7 6 The results revealed that the culture medium containing the induced YB334 crude extract demonstrated selective enhancement of growth across various bacterial strains, with the most pronounced effect observed in BPL strains. 3.5. Effect of Different Strains on Tolerance to TCA/CA Bile Salts Upon simultaneous addition of TCA and CA to the culture medium at equal concentrations, all nine strains showed growth reductions compared to that in PBS ( Figure 4 Figure 4 B. pseudolongum 9 4 9 7 As shown in Figure 4 B. adolescentis 10 1 10 7 B. longum 10 1 10 8 Figure 4 L. johnsonii L. reuteri 8 7 8 7 10 9 8 6 8 6 10 9 These data demonstrated that the BSH enzyme influences bile tolerance in a strain-dependent manner. Consequently, we hypothesized that such variations may result from the catalytic characteristics of the BSH enzyme, which catalyzes TCA substrate to CA, and that various strains may exhibit differing tolerances to TCA and CA. 3.6.

Discussion The global rise in living standards has popularized diets high in fat and calories, contributing to a growing incidence of dyslipidemia. This condition is a well-established risk factor for a spectrum of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and coronary heart disease. Statins remain the first-line pharmaceutical therapy for hypercholesterolemia due to their efficacy. However, their associated side effects raise concerns regarding long-term use. Therefore, developing effective, safe, and well-tolerated alternative strategies for cholesterol management remains a major focus of biomedical research.
