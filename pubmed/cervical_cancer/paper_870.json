They face substantial barriers in accessing healthcare that are exaggerated by bias/discrimination from healthcare professionals and systems, and socio-economic marginalisation. This review explores the current landscape of cancer risk, screening and management in transgender individuals from a Spanish perspective. Nationwide data are lacking, but estimates from Madrid suggest that 22 per 100,000 individuals are transgender. The needs of the transgender individual for gender-affirming surgeries and gender-affirming hormone therapy may alter the individual’s oncological risk profile and likelihood of receiving appropriate screening, and when diagnosed with cancer may have to be balanced against treatment requirements (e.g., endocrine therapy for breast cancer). There remain unmet needs in the oncological care of the transgender patient. Concerted effort is required to address clinical research gaps, and reform healthcare education and policy, in order to develop inclusive clinical practices that enhance patient care and outcomes.

Transgender individuals face substantial barriers in accessing healthcare, which are compounded by biases of healthcare professionals (HCPs) and a general lack of knowledge about best practices in transgender health [ 2 3 4 5 This review aims to explore the current landscape of cancer risk, screening and management in transgender populations, with a particular focus on the gaps in knowledge and healthcare provision in Spain. It seeks to delineate the specific oncological needs of transgender patients and to highlight the necessary shifts in clinical practice and research to accommodate these needs effectively. As such, the authors of this review represent both the specialities of oncology and endocrinology. Methods A systematic search of the PubMed, Google Scholar and Medline databases was conducted in April and in June 2024, using the following search terms (and synonyms of them): “transgender”, “cancer”, “gender”, “gender identity”, “assigned male at birth”, “assigned female at birth”, “gender-affirming hormone therapy”, “gender-affirming surgery”, “gender-inclusive”, “gender identity”, “gender-sensitive”, “risk factors”, “genetic variants”, “gene mutation”, “vaginoplasty”, “hysterectomy”, “neovagina”, “oophorectomy”, “orchiectomy”, “vaccinations”, “breast cancer’, “ovarian cancer”, “cervical cancer”, “endometrial cancer”, “prostate cancer”, “testicular cancer”, “anal cancer”, “rectal cancer”, “screening”, “guidelines”, “early detection”, “disparity”, “barriers”, “oncological challenges”, “access”, “outcomes”, “cancer care”, “experiences” and “Spain”. Articles identified from this search were evaluated for relevance and inclusion in this review. Additional articles were identified from the bibliographies of included articles, and from additional PubMed searches that aimed to answer specific research questions. All types of articles published in English, predominantly in the previous 10 years were considered in this review. The following guidelines were used: NCCN, American College of Radiology (ACR), World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Society of Andrology, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (ACOG), European Society for Pediatric Endocrinology, European Society of Endocrinology, Pediatric Endocrine Society and Veterans Health Administration, Canadian Breast Screening Guidelines and Guidelines and Protocols for Comprehensive Primary Care for Trans Clients [ 5 15 Definitions Understanding the terminology related to transgender identities is crucial for HCPs to provide respectful and effective care (Table 1 16 17 18 19 Table 1 Definitions of key terms relating to transgender individuals Term Definition Gender Gender is a social, cultural and psychological construct. It refers to the social roles, attributes and opportunities associated with being born with one set of genitalia or another. These attributes are learned in society and clearly vary according to geography, culture and religion, and are modifiable with time and social progress. Gender determines what is expected, valued, allowed and admitted in a woman or a man at any given moment. From an academic point of view, we can identify three components of gender: gender identity, gender expression and biological sex Gender identity This conveys the personal sense of belonging to a gender. It divides people into men, women and non-binary people. It refers to the internal and individual experience of gender. The experience of gender is intimate and diverse. It answers the question, “Who am I?” Gender identity is self-determined and is not diagnosed by others Gender expression External or social manifestation of gender identity. It refers to the social labels attached to being male or female. Gender expression can be masculine, feminine, androgynous or variable. It can be represented by clothing, accessories, hairstyles, make-up and body language, etc. It is learned in society during upbringing. Gender identity and gender expression do not always coincide in a normative way Biological sex The set of biological characteristics that define all human beings as male and female and give rise to a phenotype with a male or female appearance. Intersex variants exist in very low proportions. Biological sex is determined by chromosomes, hormones and internal and external sexual organs Sexuality The way in which people experience and express themselves as sexed beings. It is the result of the interaction of biological, psychological, socio-economic, cultural, ethical, religious or spiritual factors Sexual orientation The sexual preference or inclination that characterises the object of a person’s amorous or erotic desires Transgender A person whose gender identity differs from that assigned at birth, based on the appearance of their external genitalia and on their educated gender Cisgender A person whose gender identity matches that assigned at birth Trans An umbrella term or expression that reflects the different sexogenic realities or sexogenic diversities, and aims to cover heterogeneity in the conception of each person’s body, identity and experiences, which go beyond learned social norms and stereotypes. It is intended to be an inclusive term and is increasingly being used in the literature. It includes people both with and without gender-affirming medical treatment Transsexuality A former ICD- 10 term indicating a mismatch between the biological sex defined by the genitalia assigned at birth and the person’s gender identity. It is no longer in use Transsexual This term was used to denote a person who feels that they were born with a physical sex not in accordance with their gender identity. It was also used to define a person who presents physical changes due to hormonal or surgical treatment or who is about to start them. It is no longer in use because it focuses on anatomical aspects Gender identity disorder A pathologising term that should not be used. It should not be used because it stigmatises the individual, and has been removed from all guidelines and catalogues Gender Dysphoria Clinically significant distress or “discomfort” caused by a mismatch between sex assigned at birth and gender felt. Gender dysphoria is recognised as a pathology in the American Psychiatric Association’s DSM- 5, although not every transgender person has dysphoria. In the current literature, the term gender dysphoria refers to a spectrum of symptoms (if present) and is not a diagnostic term Trans woman Female in identity. Refers to the “male to female” of Anglo-Saxon literature Trans man Male in identity. Refers to the “female to male” of Anglo-Saxon literature Non-binary genders These are different ways of feeling, living and expressing identities that go beyond stereotypes and labels. They seek to go beyond the male–female binomial AMAB Non-binary person assigned male at birth AFAB Non-binary person assigned female at birth Transition Process of adapting physical and/or social and/or administrative characteristics to those of their gender identity. It can also be the moment when a transgender person presents him/herself in society according to his/her gender identity. There are different transitions, different speeds of transition and different ways of experiencing it. It is a personal choice for each person to choose the type of transition Cispassing The desire of a transgender individual to acquire all the external somatic social characteristics of the persons with whose identity they identify, resorting to all necessary medical/surgical procedures AFAB AMAB DSM- 5 ICD “Gender dysphoria” can influence a person’s decision to seek gender-affirming treatments [ 20 21 The terms “assigned male at birth” (AMAB) and “assigned female at birth” (AFAB) describe the sex assignment given at birth (typically based on external anatomy), and are increasingly used in medical contexts to avoid conflating biological and gender identity [ 9 Epidemiology of the transgender population Transgender individuals, though a relatively small proportion of the global population, represent a significant and expanding demographic with distinct healthcare needs. In the USA, recent estimates indicate that the transgender population includes approximately 1.6 million individuals [ 2 4 4 Nationwide population estimates for transgender people in Spain are not available at present. However, two Spanish studies investigated demand for transgender-specific healthcare at the gender identity unit of public hospitals [ 16 22 16 16 These trends reflect a significant shift in the socio-demographic profile of individuals seeking gender-affirming care in Spain, indicating not only a rise in demand but also a diversification of the transgender population engaging with healthcare services. GAC and cancer risk GAC encompasses a range of medical interventions aimed at aligning an individual’s physical appearance with their gender identity. It includes gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) and gender-affirming surgery (GAS). It is essential for patients to engage in thorough consultations with HCPs to fully understand the implications of these treatments, particularly regarding long-term health impacts such as fertility and cancer risk. GAHT plays a pivotal role in the physical transformation process and requires a comprehensive physical, psychological and sociological assessment prior to initiation. Feminising hormone therapy typically includes oestradiol and androgen blockers, while masculinising therapy relies on testosterone (Table 2 Table 2 Most commonly used gender-affirming hormone therapy drugs in Spain [ 71 Type of agent Mechanism of action/active principle Active drug Antiandrogens GnRH analogues Triptorelin Progestogens Cyproterone acetate Dienogest Drospirenone Nomegestrol acetate Testosterone receptor antagonists Spironolactone 5α-reductase inhibitors Finasteride Dutasteride Feminising preparations Oestrogens Micronised oestradiol Oestradiol valerate Oestradiol hemihydrate a Progesterone Micronised progesterone Masculinising preparations Testosterone Testosterone cypionate Testosterone undecanoate Testosterone b Preparations to stop menstruation c Progestogens Norethisterone Medroxyprogesterone acetate Micronised progesterone Etonogestrel Levonorgestrel Adapted with permission from Pérez López [ 71 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.endien.2022.11.007 a b c GAHT GnRH Because GAHTs are used off-label, it is crucial to inform the patient about their adverse effects, most notably their possible effects on fertility. An important aspect of patient care (frequently overlooked, particularly among transitioning adolescents) when considering GAHT is to discuss the possibility of fertility preservation prior to initiating therapy [ 23 GAS encompasses a variety of procedures tailored to the needs of transgender individuals. Feminising surgeries can include facial feminisation, voice and thyroid cartilage modification, mammoplasty, vaginoplasty or coloplasty and orchiectomy. Masculinising surgeries may involve thoracic masculinisation, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, metoidioplasty and phalloplasty. It is important to take into account the change in oncological risk due to the different surgeries a patient may have undergone [ 24 Since GAC results in significant changes, patients may require extensive consultations with treating physicians. However, research suggests that only a small fraction of transgender patients with cancer adequately discuss treatment plans with their physicians, such as the impact of radiotherapy on the results of previous gender-affirming breast augmentations or decisions around prophylactic mastectomies during oncological surgeries [ 1 Cancer risk in transgender people Transgender individuals frequently encounter barriers to cancer prevention and screening (see ‘Screening and Diagnostic Challenges’ below) and face significant challenges in accessing and receiving timely, quality cancer care [ 20 Lifestyle and environmental cancer risk factors Transgender individuals have traditionally faced unique lifestyle risk factors that can significantly influence their overall cancer risk [ 4 24 25 26 P 26 1 The surgical construction of a neovagina, particularly by using heterotopic penile skin in transgender women, presents specific risks for HPV exposure and subsequent cancer development [ 27 28 24 The prevalence of HIV among the transgender population is disproportionately high, reflecting the significant health disparities this community faces. A systematic review of 88 studies conducted in the USA found that the laboratory-confirmed HIV infection rates among transgender individuals were 9.2%, while self-reported rates were significantly higher at 16.1% [ 29 Substance abuse represents a significant health challenge within the transgender community, characterised by higher prevalence rates and associated risks, including cancer risk, compared with the general population. Research indicates that the prevalence of tobacco use, alcohol consumption and illicit drug use among transgender people is higher than in the general population [ 30 31 31 30 21 Screening and diagnostic challenges Transgender people often face significant barriers when accessing cancer screening programs (such as those for cervical and BC), resulting in lower adherence to these essential programs, and consequently, diagnosis at later stages and poorer prognoses [ 5 20 45 11 47 48 49 45 45 50 50 45 Differences in screening rates may be explained, at least in part, by the processes used in screening programs. In Italy, for instance, population-based screening invitations are often sent on the basis of biological sex at birth, leading to exclusion of transgender individuals after legal gender reassignment [ 20 51 53 52 54 Due to limited data on the health status and outcomes of transgender people with cancer, there are no standardised global guidelines on cancer screening in this patient group. Recommendations on cancer screening are available from expert opinion and reviews of the available scientific literature [ 10 55 57 6 58 21 Breast cancer BC screening recommendations are generally based on the sex assigned at birth, risk factors (e.g., family history, pathogenic genetic variants) and GAHT [ 6 21 57 58 WPATH recommend that transgender men who have not had gender-affirming chest surgery should participate in BC screening programs developed for cisgender women [ 21 58 8 BRCA 21 57 WPATH recommends that transgender women who have received oestrogen GAHT should be screened as per guidelines for cisgender women, taking dosage, treatment duration and age, into account [ 21 58 58 In transgender individuals carrying pathogenic genetic variants predisposing to familial cancer, decisions on screening should follow clinical practice guidelines that provide specific guidance on the particular variant(s) carried (e.g., the NCCN Guidelines) [ 6 1 Fig. 1 Different surgery recommendations for individuals undergoing gender-affirming surgery according to the presence of different mutations that confer cancer risk [ 38 PMS2 MSH6 ATM BRCA BRIP1 CHEK2 PALB2 RAD51D Cervical cancer The 8 th 21 52 59 60 61 61 If the cervix has been removed and there is no history of cervical cancer in transgender males, cervical cancer screening is unnecessary. It is recommended that transmasculine patients > 21 years undergo an annual pap smear if the cervix is present and transgender women with a neovagina do not require cervical cancer screening [ 10 Prostate cancer It cannot be assumed that the risk of PC is entirely eliminated by anti-androgen treatment in transgender women [ 40 62 63 WPATH do not currently include specific recommendations regarding PC screening in transgender women [ 21 10 64 10 10 64 Recommendations for improving oncological care for transgender patients HCPs must develop a deeper understanding of the unique needs and barriers faced by this population, and act to address these needs and assist in reducing these barriers. Inequities exist not only in healthcare delivery but also in clinical research [ 4 65 3 Table 3 Summary of key recommendations for improving cancer care in transgender individuals [ 20 21 65 Cancer research and data Increase the participation of transgender individuals in cancer clinical trials Include gender identity measures in population-based studies Include the routine collection of gender identity data by HCPs Research should focus on the holistic care of patients, including their psychosocial needs Healthcare processes, systems and institutions Policies should promote inclusive cancer care, from terminology used in clinical care encounters and medical records, to the labelling and use of clinics and rooms Screening guidelines should acknowledge and address the specific needs and risks of transgender individuals HCPs and personnel should receive cultural awareness training in relation to transgender individuals Cancer healthcare clinicians should receive education and training about transgender health issues Clinical practice Use an individual’s preferred names/pronouns/adjectives in clinical encounters and record keeping, in a consistent manner Primary care practitioners should maintain up-to-date medical records relating to organs present, gonadal surgical history and hormone use Offer procedures that avoid retraumatising individuals, where possible Individualise treatment approaches, particularly when cancer treatment needs to be considered in the context of the needs of the patient relating to GAHT Provide support for the individual’s psychological needs GAHT HCPs Transgender individuals and other gender minorities are deeply under-represented in pivotal BC treatment trials [ 66 20 67 20 The Assisi recommendations by the Italian Association of Medical Oncology highlight the urgent need for comprehensive policies that integrate a gender-sensitive approach into oncological care [ 20 20 65 4 4 Current cancer screening guidelines are largely based on data derived from the cisgender population, which may not be entirely applicable to transgender individuals [ 20 20 20 Significant gaps remain in the existing literature, particularly concerning the psychosocial aspects of cancer care for transgender patients [ 68 Finally, in transgender patients diagnosed with cancer (particularly BC), the coordination of GAC and cancer treatment must be considered carefully. Endocrine-based treatment of hormone-receptor positive BC in transgender patients may interfere with GAHT; however, there is a lack of clear evidence about this issue [ 69 69 69 70 69 Conclusions This review highlights the significant oncological challenges and disparities faced by transgender individuals, underscoring the urgent need for tailored healthcare protocols that address their unique needs. An integrated approach to care, encompassing both GAC and vigilant cancer management, is essential. To bridge the current gaps in knowledge and practice, concerted efforts in research, education and policy reform are necessary to ensure that transgender individuals receive equitable and effective cancer care. Future directions should focus on expanding accessible, transgender-specific health data, improving HCP education on transgender health issues and developing inclusive clinical practices that enhance patient care and outcomes.
