Patients were assigned to either the PI or the toothbrushing groups. Subglottic secretions were collected immediately before oral care (baseline) and at 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours after the intervention. Viable bacterial counts were quantified using delayed real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for statistical comparison.\nResults: The PI group showed significant reductions in bacterial counts at 2, 3, and 6 hours after care (p=0.023, 0.002, and <0.001, respectively), whereas the toothbrushing group did not show significant changes.\nConclusion: PI oral care effectively reduces viable bacterial load in the lower respiratory tract and may serve as a safe and cost-effective alternative to chlorhexidine for ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention in Japan. intubation pneumonia povidone-iodine toothbrushing ventilator pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a serious and common complication encountered in intensive care units (ICUs), posing a significant threat to the health of patients undergoing endotracheal intubation [ 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 11 Endotracheal intubation impairs swallowing function and disrupts the self-cleaning mechanisms of the oral cavity, leading to a more than 100-fold increase in oral bacterial load [ 12 13 14 15 15 17 18 In Japan, mouthwashes containing more than 0.05% CHX are not approved, and products with a concentration of 0.12% cannot be used [ 19 20 21 22 In Japan, public health insurance began covering \"perioperative oral care (POC)\" in 2012, initially to prevent complications in patients undergoing cancer treatment. Since then, the scope of POC has expanded to include patients with stroke, joint replacement surgery, palliative care, and those undergoing surgery under general anesthesia. In 2024, coverage was further extended to include patients undergoing endotracheal intubation in ICUs. However, as mentioned above, 0.12% CHX cannot be used in Japan, and as a result, oral care using toothbrushes is commonly practiced in many facilities. A survey conducted by the Japanese Society of Oral Care across 302 hospitals with ICUs revealed that 92.4% of institutions performed oral care for intubated patients using toothbrushes in combination with sponge brushes and suction devices. However, numerous studies have shown that toothbrushing has no preventive effect on VAP [ 23 25 26 Povidone-iodine (PI) exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and has long been used in Japan for various oral disinfection purposes, such as wound cleaning and gargling. Additionally, it is inexpensive due to its coverage under the national health insurance system and could potentially serve as an alternative to 0.12% CHX for preventing VAP [ 27 28 This preliminary study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PI in oral care for intubated patients by conducting a randomized comparison with the currently common practice of toothbrushing. The primary endpoint was the total bacterial count reaching the lower respiratory tract. Materials and methods Study design An open-label randomized controlled trial was conducted. Participants Inclusion Criteria The study included patients who underwent endotracheal intubation management at Kansai Medical University Medical Center between November 2023 and October 2024, who were provided with an explanation of the study, and who gave their consent to participate. A total of 20 patients were targeted based on feasibility considerations. As this sample size was a preliminary study, no statistical sample size calculation was performed. Exclusion Criteria Patients with an allergy to iodine, edentulous patients, and those with minimal aspiration into the lower airway from whom subglottic secretions could not be collected were excluded. Allocation and intervention Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio using computer software to either the Br group or the PI group. In the Br group, toothbrushing using a standard soft-bristle toothbrush without toothpaste was performed for approximately two minutes while simultaneously using suction and wiping with a sponge brush. All Br procedures were performed by licensed dental hygienists who had been trained in the study protocol. In the PI group, the oral mucosa, including the tongue and buccal mucosa, was wiped using a sponge brush soaked in about 5 mL of 1.0% PI. While a 0.1% concentration of PI has been shown to be effective [ 29 Sample collection and measurement of bacteria Subglottic secretions were aspirated and collected from the side port above the endotracheal tube cuff before oral care and at 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours after oral care. Samples were collected from subglottic secretions above the endotracheal tube cuff. This approach was chosen because direct sampling from the lower respiratory tract (e.g., bronchoalveolar lavage) would impose additional risks and burdens on critically ill, intubated patients, whereas subglottic aspiration can be performed safely through the endotracheal tube side port without additional invasiveness. The subglottic space also represents a clinically relevant reservoir where oral secretions accumulate before passing into the lungs, serving as a surrogate for assessing bacterial entry into the lower respiratory tract. This sample contained bacteria killed by PI. Therefore, we used the delayed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method [ 30 The principle of this method is that a sample containing a mixture of viable and dead bacteria is first incubated in brain heart infusion (BHI) liquid medium for 4 hours to allow only viable bacteria to grow. Subsequently, a mixed samples of viable and dead bacteria (10:0, 5:5, 1:9, and 0:10 viable bacteria:dead bacteria) were prepared. The samples were first incubated in BHI liquid medium for 4 hours to allow only viable bacteria to grow, and then real-time PCR was performed. In real-time PCR, universal primers targeting 16 ribosomal RNA (forward: 5'-TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT-3', reverse: 5'-GGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTT-3') were used, as reported previously [ 31 Statistical analyses The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (IBM Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The difference in the number of bacteria before and after oral care was analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U test. A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Ethics and registration This study conformed to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Kansai Medical University Medical Center (2023041). Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study was registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR) (UMIN000057899). Results Patient characteristics The flow of patient enrollment, randomization, allocation, follow-up, and analysis is shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 Consort flowchart diagram This study included 15 male and 5 female patients, with a mean age of 68.9 years. The most common primary diagnosis leading to ICU admission was cerebral hemorrhage (eight patients), followed by cervical vertebra fracture (three patients), pneumonia (two patients), and malignant tumor (two patients). Myocardial infarction, post-resuscitation encephalopathy, neurological disease, severe infectious disease, and acute leukemia accounted for one patient each. Blood test results are shown in Table 1 Table 1 Patient characteristics SD: Standard deviation Variable Category Number of patients/mean ± SD Sex Man 15 Woman 5 Age 68.9±19.5 Primary disease Cerebral hemorrhage 8 Cervical vertebra fracture 3 Pneumonia 2 Malignant tumor 2 Others 5 Hemoglobin g/dL 10.0±1.75 Leukocytes ×10³/μL 9195±3346 Lymphocytes ×10³/μL 1521±793 Albumin g/dL 2.49±0.504 Creatinine mg/dL 1.15±1.59 Total number of patients 20 Change in bacterial count in supra-cuff secretions in the Br group When the bacterial count before oral care was set as 100% (log-transformed), the median bacterial counts at 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours after oral care were 119%, 93%, 97%, and 140%, respectively. None of these showed a statistically significant difference compared to the pre-oral care values (Figure 2 Figure 2 Bacteria count in supra-cuff secretions in the brushing (Br) group In the Br group, no significant change in bacterial counts was observed before and after oral care. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Change in bacterial count in supra-cuff secretions in the PI group When the bacterial count on the subglottic secretions after PI application was expressed as a percentage of the pre-application level (set at 100%, log-transformed), the median bacterial counts decreased to 50%, 33%, 30%, and 14% at 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours, respectively. Although the decrease at 1 hour was not statistically significant (p=0.143), significant reductions were observed at 2 hours (p=0.023), 3 hours (p=0.002), and 6 hours (p<0.001) (Figure 3 Figure 3 Bacteria count in supra-cuff secretions in the povidone-iodine (PI) group In the PI group, bacterial counts decreased after oral care, showing a significant reduction compared to pre-care levels at 2, 3, and 6 hours. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Discussion This study revealed that oral care using PI significantly reduces the number of bacteria in secretions accumulating on the tracheal cannula of intubated patients, whereas Br alone does not have this effect. In other countries, the application of CHX to the oral cavity has been reported to be effective in preventing VAP [ 16 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 32 Iodine-based disinfectants, such as PI, are safe and effective for skin and mucosal disinfection and therefore represent a promising candidate for broader application in oral care. Supporting this, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend intraoperative wound irrigation with iodophor solutions [ 33 34 35 In a meta-analysis by Labeau et al. [ 28 36 The summaries of the two studies suggesting the efficacy of PI are as follows. Chua et al. [ 37 38 28 37 39 40 In addition, in the Br group, although the differences were not statistically significant, bacterial counts tended to increase at 1 and 6 hours after oral care. This trend may reflect the possibility that toothbrushing disperses plaque-derived bacteria throughout the oral cavity, resulting in a temporary elevation of bacterial load in secretions above the endotracheal cuff. Such a phenomenon has also been suggested in previous reports [ 20 In contrast, in Japanese clinical settings, concerns have been raised that PI mouthwashes may cause irritation or adverse effects on the oral mucosa or lead to oral dryness due to the presence of alcohol. However, such reports are largely based on expert opinion and anecdotal experience. The CDC guidelines [ 32 41 This study had several limitations. First, although it was conducted as a randomized controlled trial, it was a preliminary study with a small number of participants, and it remains unclear whether the findings can be generalized. In addition, the study was not blinded, and the staff performing the interventions and collecting the samples were aware of the treatment group. Although significant reductions in bacterial counts were observed in the PI group, these findings should be interpreted with caution because the small sample size likely resulted in wide confidence intervals, indicating substantial uncertainty. Larger-scale studies will be necessary to provide more precise estimates of the effect size. This could introduce subconscious bias in how procedures were carried out or in sample handling. Second, the endpoint was not the incidence of VAP but rather the bacterial count above the endotracheal tube cuff. It is not yet known whether an increase in supra-cuff bacterial load directly leads to the development of VAP. However, since the incidence of VAP is relatively low and studying it as a primary endpoint would require a large sample size, we chose to use the bacterial count flowing into the lower respiratory tract as the endpoint for this preliminary study. This study was a preliminary investigation conducted with careful attention to patient safety, and no adverse events related to the interventions were observed. Based on our findings, we plan to conduct a larger-scale investigation to determine whether oral care using PI can reduce the incidence of VAP and improve patient outcomes. Conclusions Before evaluating the effectiveness of oral care using PI for the prevention of VAP, we conducted a preliminary study with a small number of cases to examine the impact of PI application and toothbrushing on the bacterial count in secretions accumulating above the endotracheal tube cuff. The results showed that PI significantly reduced bacterial counts in supra-cuff secretions compared to toothbrushing in this preliminary study, and no adverse events were observed, indicating that the intervention was performed safely. These findings provide a basis for future larger-scale studies to evaluate the potential role of PI in oral care for intubated patients. In countries outside Japan, oral care with 0.12% CHX is widely used for intubated patients. Since the local oral administration of CHX is banned in Japan, our findings suggest that PI may serve as a useful alternative for oral care, as it has been shown to reduce bacterial load in supra-cuff secretions. However, this study was preliminary in nature and did not evaluate VAP incidence. Therefore, further large-scale studies are required to determine whether PI can contribute to the prevention of VAP.
