Additionally, it interacts with other post‐translational modifications, which are closely linked to tumorigenesis, tumor progression, the tumor microenvironment, and the response to therapeutic interventions. Recent advancements in understanding the ubiquitination mechanisms have led to significant breakthroughs, offering novel perspectives and strategies for diagnosing and treating tumors. Here, we provided an overview of how ubiquitination influences tumor biology, focusing on its roles in immune regulation, metabolism, and its interactions with other modifications. We also summarized the clinical potential of targeting E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases as therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.

INTRODUCTION Tumor initiation and progression are intricate biological processes that involve the regulation of numerous intracellular and extracellular signaling pathways [ 1 2 3 4 1.1 Discovery and early characterization of ubiquitin Ubiquitin is a highly conserved 76‐amino acid protein found in all eukaryotes. Goldstein and Sumner first identified it in 1975 and named it for its ubiquitous presence (Figure 1 5 FIGURE 1  Timeline of ubiquitination studies In 1978, scientists Avram Hershko and Aaron Ciechanover discovered that the activity of a component involved in ATP‐dependent protein degradation originated from a heat‐stable small peptide. They named this peptide the “active principle in fraction 1” (APF‐1), which was later identified as ubiquitin [ 6 7 8 9 1.2 Identification of core enzymes and establishment of the ubiquitination cascade Between 1981 and 1983, researchers identified three key enzymes involved in the ubiquitination process: E1 (ubiquitin‐activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin‐conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase) [ 10 11 12 10 11 12 12 13 14 In 1984, Alexander Varshavsky and Daniel Finley further demonstrated the widespread presence of the ubiquitin‐mediated degradation pathway, establishing the UPS as a central mechanism in cellular protein metabolism [ 15 16 17 18 19 By approximately 2000, the tertiary structures of ubiquitination enzymes, including E1, E2, and E3, were gradually parsed, providing crucial structural insights into the mechanisms underlying ubiquitination [ 20 21 22 23 1.3 Expanding roles of ubiquitination in tumor biology and therapeutic innovation In 2011, studies confirmed that linear ubiquitination interferes with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‐induced cell death, thereby preventing inflammation. This finding highlighted its crucial role in regulating immune signaling and preventing inflammation in vivo [ 24 25 26 In recent years, proteolysis‐targeting chimeras (PROTAC) technology has harnessed the ubiquitination system for targeted protein degradation, offering a promising approach for cancer research by selectively eliminating oncogenic proteins and disrupting key signaling pathways involved in tumor progression [ 27 28 29 30 2 OVERVIEW OF UBIQUITINATION 2.1 The ubiquitination process Ubiquitination controls protein degradation, function, localization, and protein‐protein interactions by attaching ubiquitin to target proteins [ 31 2A 32 33 34 35 FIGURE 2  A cascade of ubiquitin enzymes in the UPS and classification of E3 ligases and DUBs 2.2 Types of ubiquitin linkages Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues (K48, K63, K6, K11, K27, K29, and K33), all of which can serve as acceptor sites for polyubiquitin chain extension. Additionally, its N‐terminal methionine (M1) can also be utilized for linear ubiquitin chain formation (Figure 2B 33 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 2.3 Structural domains of E3 ubiquitin ligases E3 ubiquitin ligases are critical regulators of the ubiquitination process, with more than 600 different types identified in mammals. These ligases are classified into three main categories: really interesting new gene (RING)‐E3s, HECT‐E3s, and RING‐in‐between‐RING (RBR)‐E3s (Figure 2C 54 RING‐E3s mediate ubiquitin transfer by bringing the E2‐ubiquitin conjugate and substrate into proximity, enabling direct ubiquitin attachment to the substrate without forming a covalent intermediate with the E3 itself [ 55 56 57 58 59 60 56 2.3.1 RING‐domain E3 ligases: RNF family and tumor biology Within RING‐domain E3 ligases, RING finger proteins (RNFs) have been widely studied due to their crucial role in tumor biology, including cell cycle regulation, metastasis, immune evasion, and drug resistance [ 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 2.3.2 Cullin‐RING ligases (CRLs): scaffold‐based E3s in cancer Another major subclass of RING‐domain E3 ligase is the cullin‐RING ligase (CRL) complex. These multi‐subunit ligases feature cullin (CUL) proteins as scaffolds that link substrate recognition units with E2 conjugating enzymes [ 71 72 73 74 GPX4 75 76 77 78 79 80 2.4 Structural domains of DUBs DUBs are classified into seven families based on their structure and catalytic mechanisms: ubiquitin‐specific proteases (USPs), ovarian tumor proteases (OTUs), JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzymes (JAMMs), ubiquitin C‐terminal hydrolases (UCHs), motifs interacting with the Ub‐containing novel DUB family members (MINDYs), Machado‐Joseph disease proteases (MJDs), and zinc finger with UFM1‐specific peptidase domain protein (ZUFSP) (Figure 2D 29 DUBs play crucial roles in regulating key biological processes by removing ubiquitin modifications, thus influencing protein stability, localization, and function. In the context of cancer, DUBs are involved in both tumor suppression and oncogenesis. For example, the ubiquitination of tumor suppressor proteins such as p53 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) can lead to their degradation and functional loss, promoting tumorigenesis [ 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 2.5 Ubiquitin‐like modifications Ubiquitin and UBLs are small post‐translational modifiers that regulate diverse cellular processes through covalent attachment to target proteins [ 88 89 1 90 TABLE 1 The protein structure and activating/conjugating enzymes of UBL modifications.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. In 1996, Mahajan et al. first reported SUMOylation, identifying a protein named small ubiquitin‐like modifier 1 (SUMO1) and documenting its ability to covalently bind to target proteins, similar to ubiquitin [ 97 98 99 100 101 80 102 103 104 30 Fan and his colleagues first reported FAT10ylation in 1996. They discovered HLA‐F adjacent transcript 10 (FAT10), a UBL modifier, and reported its ability to covalently attach to target proteins through a process resembling ubiquitination [ 105 106 In 1997, Kamitani et al. first reported NEDDylation, identifying neural precursor cell‐expressed developmentally downregulated protein 8 (NEDD8), a protein with 60% sequence identity to ubiquitin. They showed that NEDD8 can covalently attach to target proteins through a mechanism similar to ubiquitination [ 107 In 2003, Malakhov et al. first reported ISGylation by discovering that USP18 specifically removes interferon‐stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from conjugated proteins [ 108 109 110 URMylation was first reported in 2003 by Goehring and colleagues, who reported that the protein ubiquitin‐related modifier 1 (URM1) works in conjunction with the protein UBA4, and can covalently attach to other proteins through a ubiquitin‐like mechanism [ 111 112 In 2004, Takahashi et al. first reported UFMylation, identifying a novel small protein, ubiquitin‐fold modifier 1 (UFM1). They showed that UFM1 covalently attaches to target proteins through a mechanism similar to ubiquitination. UFMylation is mediated by a cascade of enzymatic reactions involving ubiquitin‐like modifier activating enzyme 5 for activation, ubiquitin‐fold modifier conjugating enzyme 1 for conjugation, and UFM1‐specific ligase 1 for substrate‐specific ligation of UFM1 [ 113 114 In summary, UBL modifications, including SUMOylation, FAT10ylation, NEDDylation, ISGylation, URMylation, and UFMylation, are closely related to the ubiquitination process. They can influence the ubiquitination pathway and its outcomes by competing for target protein sites, regulating the activity of ubiquitinating enzymes, stabilizing proteins, or preventing their degradation. 3 CROSSTALK BETWEEN UBIQUITINATION AND OTHER PTMs The dynamic interplay between ubiquitination and other PTMs, such as phosphorylation, O‐linked‐N‐acetylglucosaminylation (O‐GlcNAcylation), acetylation, palmitoylation, and lactylation, is crucial in regulating the behavior of cancer cells. These modifications work in concert to fine‐tune cellular processes, including protein stability, subcellular localization, gene expression, and signal transduction pathways [ 115 116 117 118 3.1 Phosphorylation Crosstalk between phosphorylation and ubiquitination plays a crucial role in tumor progression, as phosphorylation can modulate the activity of ubiquitin ligases or their interactions with substrates, thereby regulating the ubiquitination process (Figure 3A FIGURE 3  Examples of the crosstalk between ubiquitination and other PTMs For instance, the serine/threonine kinase with no lysine 4 (WNK4) has been associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer (GC) [ 119 120 Branched‐chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDK) phosphorylates branched‐chain amino acid transaminase 1 (BCAT1) at the Ser5, Ser19, and Thr312 sites, enhancing its activity and stability. Similarly, BCKDK phosphorylates STIP1 homology and U‐box‐containing protein 1 (STUB1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting BCAT1, at Ser19, which disrupts its interaction with BCAT1 and inhibits BCAT1 degradation, thereby enhancing BCAT1 stability [ 121 Moreover, Huang et al. demonstrated that AKT‐mediated phosphorylation of RNF12, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a critical role in TNBC metastasis. Specifically, AKT phosphorylates RNF12 at Ser215 and Ser347, promoting its nuclear localization and stability, which enhances RNF12‐mediated ubiquitination and degradation of sma‐ and mad‐related protein family member 7 (SMAD7). This process accelerates transforming growth factor‐beta (TGF‐β)‐driven TNBC metastasis; however, pharmacological inhibition of AKT using the kinase inhibitor MK2206 mitigates this effect [ 122 Furthermore, a study indicated that under replicative stress, ataxia telangiectasia and rad3‐related (ATR) kinase phosphorylates E3 ubiquitin‐protein ligase RAD18 (RAD18) at Ser403, thereby restricting RAD18‐mediated monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). This phosphorylation prevents excessive accumulation of the tumor suppressor SLX4 structure‐specific endonuclease subunit (SLX4) at stalled replication forks, contributing to the maintenance of replication fork and telomere stability, particularly in cells utilizing the alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism [ 123 Together, these findings illustrate that phosphorylation and ubiquitination frequently intersect, either by ubiquitinating kinases or by phosphorylating ubiquitin ligases, thereby modulating downstream protein activity, stability, and intracellular signaling. Moreover, understanding this crosstalk has uncovered potential therapeutic targets, such as the interaction between HECT and RLD domain‐containing E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 5 (HERC5) and ISG15, offering new avenues for cancer treatment strategies [ 124 3.2 Acetylation Acetylation involves the covalent attachment of an acetyl group to lysine residues of proteins, forming an amide bond and neutralizing the positive charge of the ε‐amino group under physiological conditions. This modification is crucial for chromatin binding and alters protein structure, activity, stability, and interactions with other molecules, thereby regulating various cellular processes, including gene expression, metabolism, and signal transduction [ 125 126 127 3B 128 For instance, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), cyclic‐AMP response binding protein (CREB)‐binding protein (CBP) acts as an acetyltransferase to catalyze the acetylation of BCAT2 at Lys44, which promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby suppressing branched‐chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism and tumor cell proliferation. Conversely, the deacetylase sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) antagonizes this process by removing acetyl groups from BCAT2 to stabilize the protein [ 129 Furthermore, Yu et al. reported that tripartite motif containing 24 (TRIM24) increases the ubiquitination of CBP, promoting its interaction with signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) and leading to subsequent acetylation of STAT6 at Lys383. In the absence of TRIM24, reduced CBP ubiquitination leads to decreased STAT6 acetylation, which enhances STAT6's DNA‐binding and transcriptional activity. This process drives M2 macrophage polarization, contributing to the formation of an immunosuppressive TME [ 130 Moreover, histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) mediates the deacetylation of SCM‐like with four MBT domains 2 (SFMBT2), reducing its stability and increasing its susceptibility to recognition and ubiquitination by Siah E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (SIAH1), ultimately leading to proteasomal degradation. Notably, a mutation at Lys687 significantly decreases both SFMBT2 acetylation and ubiquitination, highlighting the importance of this residue for both SIAH1‐mediated ubiquitination and HDAC3‐induced deacetylation. This balance between acetylation and ubiquitination at the Lys687 site is crucial for the stability and function of SFMBT2, thereby influencing the growth and metastasis of clear cell renal carcinoma [ 131 132 In summary, the intricate crosstalk between acetylation and ubiquitination plays a critical role in cancer biology, influencing various aspects of tumor onset, progression, metastasis, and TME. A more thorough understanding of these interactions may offer new insights for developing targeted cancer therapies. 3.3 Palmitoylation Palmitoylation covalently attaches palmitic acid (a 16‐carbon saturated fatty acid) to cysteine residues of proteins through thioester or amide bonds [ 133 134 3C Recent studies have identified the specific functions of different ZDHHC members in this regulatory network. Yao et al. demonstrated that ZDHHC3‐mediated palmitoylation at Cys272 stabilizes PD‐L1 by blocking its ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation. Targeting palmitoylation with 2‐bromopalmitate (2‐BP) or cell‐penetrating peptide S1 (CPP‐S1) promotes PD‐L1 degradation and enhances tumor‐specific T‐cell cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo [ 135 136 137 138 139 Collectively, these findings highlight the critical crosstalk between palmitoylation and ubiquitination in regulating protein activity, localization, and stability, ultimately influencing tumorigenesis and progression. 3.4 O‐GlcNAcylation O‐GlcNAcylation, the addition of a single O‐linked β‐N‐acetylglucosamine (O‐GlcNAc) molecule to serine or threonine residues, is crucial for regulating protein stability, enzymatic activity, subcellular localization, and interplay with other PTMs, including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and ADP‐ribosylation (Figure 3D 140 141 Tang et al. demonstrated that USP8 regulates glutathione (GSH) metabolism and ferroptosis by stabilizing O‐GlcNAc transferase (OGT) through inhibition of its K48‐linked polyubiquitination at Lys117. This stabilization is phosphorylation‐dependent, as USP8 phosphorylation at Ser716 facilitates its interaction with OGT. Pharmacological inhibition of USP8 using DUB‐IN‐3 leads to OGT degradation, resulting in decreased O‐GlcNAcylation of SLC7A11 at Ser26, thereby inducing ferroptosis and suppressing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression [ 142 143 O‐GlcNAcylation modulates the activity and stability of multiple E3 ligases implicated in HCC. For instance, speckled POZ protein (SPOP) is extensively O‐GlcNAcylated at Ser96 by OGT, which increases its nuclear localization and stabilizes reticulon 4B by inhibiting its ubiquitination, thereby promoting HCC progression [ 144 145 146 147 Moreover, Li et al. demonstrated that O‐GlcNAcylation of poly (ADP‐ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) at Ser26 promotes its nuclear localization and chromatin binding. This enhances poly‐ADP‐ribosylation of DNA damage‐binding protein 1 (DDB1), which is stabilized due to reduced ubiquitination, facilitating degradation of the downstream target c‐MYC [ 148 149 O‐GlcNAcylation also influences therapy resistance. Melanophilin (MLPH) is O‐GlcNAcylated at Ser510, reducing its interaction with TRIM21 and enhancing its stability, subsequently increasing radiation resistance in GBM [ 150 151 In summary, these findings illustrate that O‐GlcNAcylation regulates ubiquitination machinery at multiple levels—including DUBs, E3 ligases, and substrate proteins—thereby influencing tumor growth, metastasis, metabolism, and therapeutic sensitivity. 3.5 Lactylation Lactylation refers to the modification of proteins through the acylation of lactate, which binds to amino acid residues, thereby affecting their functions and stability [ 152 153 3E For instance, Huang and colleagues discovered that lactylation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) at the Lys91 site prevents its interaction with WWP2. This impairs TFEB ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby enhancing TFEB activity and promoting autophagy flux [ 154 155 156 Currently, research on the interaction between lactylation and ubiquitination is still in its early stages. With the continuous deepening of protein modification research, more interactions between these two modifications may be discovered in the future. 4 UBIQUITINATION IN TUMOR METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING The metabolic plasticity exhibited by tumor cells represents one of the essential pathophysiological features driving oncogenesis and disease progression [ 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 2 TABLE 2 E3 ligases or DUBs involved in metabolic reprogramming in cancers Type Regulator(s) Substrates Function Cancer type Refs.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 4.1 Aerobic glycolysis 4.1.1 Ubiquitin‐mediated regulation of c‐MYC in aerobic glycolysis Aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect, is a hallmark of metabolic reprogramming that supports rapid tumor cell proliferation and survival [ 186 187 188 189 190 191 181 172 173 178 166 184 USP44 185 168 167 4.1.2 Ubiquitination‐dependent regulation of HIF‐1α in tumor glycolysis In addition to c‐MYC, hypoxia‐inducible factor‐1 alpha (HIF‐1α) is another key transcription factor that orchestrates tumor glycolysis under hypoxic conditions [ 192 193 180 179 182 183 175 In summary, ubiquitination dynamically regulates key transcription factors involved in glycolysis, such as c‐MYC and HIF‐1α, by modulating their stability and activity, thereby contributing to cancer metabolic reprogramming and offering promising therapeutic targets. 4.2 Amino acid metabolism Enhanced amino acid metabolism is essential for cancer progression, supporting proliferation, metastasis, and survival [ 194 195 196 4.2.1 Ubiquitination‐mediated regulation of BCATs BCATs catalyze branched‐chain amino acids (BCAAs) catabolism, generating glutamate, which contributes to tumor growth via glutamine synthesis [ 197 198 165 121 129 4.2.2 Ubiquitin‐dependent modulation of mTORC1 signaling The rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway integrates amino acid availability to regulate cellular growth and metabolism. Ubiquitination plays a crucial role in fine‐tuning this signaling [ 199 200 196 201 171 Overall, ubiquitination enables cancer cells to adapt amino acid metabolism in response to nutrient availability by modulating enzyme stability and key signaling pathways. Understanding these regulatory networks may inform future therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic vulnerabilities in tumors. 4.3 Lipid metabolism 4.3.1 Ubiquitination regulates lipid synthesis enzymes Recent studies highlight the importance of ubiquitination in regulating lipid metabolism in tumors. The UPS regulates lipid metabolism by controlling the stability of critical enzymes and transcription factors [ 202 203 176 169 176 177 204 205 174 170 4.3.2 Transcriptional regulation of lipid metabolism via ubiquitination Ubiquitination also governs transcription factors involved in lipid metabolic regulation [ 206 207 208 174 209 210 211 4.3.3 Lipid droplets (LDs) and ubiquitination LDs serve as storage hubs for neutral lipids and are dynamically regulated in cancer [ 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 In summary, these findings highlight the multifaceted role of ubiquitination in regulating lipid metabolism in cancer, including enzyme activity, transcriptional control, and lipid droplet formation. A better understanding of these mechanisms may inform the development of metabolic interventions targeting the ubiquitin system in oncology. 5 UBIQUITINATION IN THE TME The TME consists of various immune cells, cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and tissue‐resident cells. These host cells are involved in tumor immune escape, promoting or inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis, as well as drug resistance mechanisms under the domination of tumor cells and their microenvironment [ 219 5.1 CD8 + CD8 + 1 + 4A + 220 221 FIGURE 4 Mechanisms of ubiquitination and deubiquitination in the TME. (A) Ubiquitination regulates TCR signaling and PD‐1 stability in CD8⁺ T cells. NRDP1 (①) mediates K33‐linked polyubiquitination of ZAP70, leading to the suppression of TCR signaling and CD8⁺ T cell activation. BAP1 enhances the expression of TCR complex components. FBXO38 (②) and KLHL22 (③) mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of PD‐1, whereas TRIP12 (④) mediates the ubiquitination and degradation of NFATc1, thereby reducing CD8 + The immune checkpoint protein PD‐1 is subject to ubiquitination and degradation by various E3 ligases, which directly impact T‐cell exhaustion and function [ 222 223 224 225 226 + 227 KLHL22 228 Furthermore, metabolic cues in the TME also influence T cell exhaustion. Lactic acid promotes the expression of the adaptor protein C‐X9‐C motif containing 1 (CMC1) via USP7‐mediated deubiquitination and stabilization, dampening antitumor immunity. Upregulated CMC1 accelerates CD8 + 229 Collectively, these findings underscore the central roles of ubiquitination in orchestrating CD8 + 5.2 CAFs CAFs are the primary cell type in the tumor matrix. By remodeling the extracellular matrix and forming a dense physical barrier, they hinder the effective delivery of drugs and immune cells into tumor tissue, thereby limiting drug penetration, suppressing immune cell infiltration, and ultimately reducing treatment efficacy [ 230 231 232 4B 233 234 + 235 236 5.3 Dendritic cell (DC) DCs play a crucial role in antigen presentation and immune regulation within the TME [ 237 4C 238 239 240 241 242 5.4 Immunosuppressive cells The development of an immunosuppressive microenvironment is a key mechanism of tumor immune evasion. Immunosuppressive cells, including tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs), myeloid‐derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), play crucial roles in immune resistance, driving tumor progression and facilitating immune escape in cancer [ 243 5.4.1 TAMs TAMs, which are significant tumor‐infiltrating immune cells, affect tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immune escape [ 244 245 4D 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 5.4.2 Tregs Tregs are a major barrier to effective antitumor immunity [ 253 254 255 256 4E 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 c‐MYC 267 5.4.3 MDSCs MDSCs are a population of immature myeloid cells that help establish an immunosuppressive microenvironment and facilitate tumor progression [ 268 4F 269 270 271 In addition to directly regulating immune‐suppressive function, ubiquitination also contributes to MDSC differentiation. Taurocholic acid promotes glycolysis of MDSCs through H3K4 monomethylation and impairs CHIP‐mediated PD‐L1 ubiquitination. This results in PD‐L1 accumulation and expansion of MDSCs, promoting CRC lung metastasis [ 272 273 In summary, ubiquitination plays a multifaceted role in shaping both the development and suppressive activity of MDSCs. Targeting these pathways offers promising avenues to remodel the immunosuppressive microenvironment and enhance the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. 6 POTENTIAL CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF UBIQUITINATION The multifaceted role of ubiquitination in cancer development and therapy underscores its prominence in current oncological research. Drug development targeting the ubiquitination pathway has emerged as a promising area in cancer therapy. This chapter highlighted tumor‐associated ubiquitination biomarkers and discussed the potential of E3 ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases as both biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Additionally, we explored their possible synergistic effects with ICIs, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, providing insights into novel treatment strategies. 6.1 Ubiquitination‐related biomarkers Ubiquitinase and deubiquitinase, such as E3 ligases and DUBs, are often dysregulated in various tumors and have been identified as potential biomarkers for tumor diagnosis, prognosis, and personalized treatment (Table 3 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 TABLE 3 List of E3 ligases or DUBs identified as biomarkers in cancer Type Ubiquitin‐modifying enzymes Type of cancer Features of biomarker Biomarker type Inhibitor Refs.

PROTACs represent a novel strategy to degrade pathogenic proteins via the UPS. These molecules link a ligand for the target protein to another that recruits an E3 ligase [ 314 315 305 306 316 317 318 319 6.3 Inhibitors of deubiquitinase DUBs reverse ubiquitination by cleaving ubiquitin from substrate proteins, critically regulating cellular processes, including protein homeostasis, cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and tumorigenesis [ 304 320 4 321 322 + 308 309 142 310 323 311 312 313 7 CONCLUSIONS Ubiquitination is a key regulator in tumor initiation and progression, influencing diverse processes such as cell survival, immune modulation, and metabolism. This review emphasized the dynamic crosstalk between ubiquitination and other PTMs, which together fine‐tune protein functions and tumor behavior. In the tumor microenvironment, ubiquitination modulates immune checkpoint molecules like PD‐1 and shapes the functions of immunosuppressive cells such as Tregs and TAMs, thereby impacting antitumor immunity. Additionally, ubiquitination orchestrates metabolic reprogramming by regulating key enzymes and transcription factors to support tumor growth. Targeting components of the ubiquitin system, including E3 ligases and deubiquitinases, holds promising therapeutic potential. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may pave the way for novel diagnostic strategies and more effective cancer treatments.
