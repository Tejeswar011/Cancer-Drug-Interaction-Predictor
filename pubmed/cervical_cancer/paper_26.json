While common PTMs are well-studied, lactylation—a novel PTM linking metabolism to epigenetics—has emerged as a critical regulator in BC pathogenesis. The high concentration of lactate caused by the Warburg effect makes lactylation in tumor tissue possible. Machine learning enhances the discovery and analysis of lactylation sites by processing large datasets, revealing patterns that influence tumor behavior and patient outcomes. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of the role of lactylation in breast cancer development and progression. It focuses on the impact on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of breast cancer cells and their association with chemotherapeutic resistance. This review provides valuable insights for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies that may enhance early diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic evaluation of breast cancer. The findings presented here open new avenues for future research and clinical practice.

Unlike normal cells, which primarily utilize oxidative phosphorylation for energy, tumor cells predominantly rely on glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen, a metabolic shift termed the Warburg effect. This adaptation allows for faster, albeit less efficient, ATP production to meet heightened metabolic needs [ 2 3 4 Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and glycosylation, play crucial roles in epigenetic regulation by controlling protein activity, localization, folding, and interactions [ 5 6 Machine learning and large models have significantly advanced lactylation research, providing valuable insights into the identification of lactylation sites and the prediction of patterns. This advancement has, in turn, bolstered our capacity to delve into the functional implications of this modification [ 7 Lactic acid metabolism In normal cells, glucose undergoes glycolysis to generate pyruvate under aerobic conditions. Pyruvate is then transported into the mitochondria, converted to acetyl-CoA, and enters the citric acid cycle to produce NADH and FADH₂. These high-energy carriers are utilized in the electron transport chain to facilitate efficient ATP synthesis. Under hypoxic conditions, cells switch to anaerobic glycolysis, converting pyruvate to lactate catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), an LDH isoform that preferentially catalyzes pyruvate-to-lactate conversion [ 8 Compared with normal cells, malignant tumor cells exhibit the Warburg effect, a metabolic reprogramming phenomenon in which glucose is utilized for glycolysis to generate energy and produce lactic acid, even under aerobic conditions. In addition to glucose, glutamine serves as a substrate for lactate production in tumor cells. The resulting lactate is imported via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT-1) and exported via MCT-4, helping to maintain intracellular pH homeostasis [ 9 Glutamine-derived lactate production occurs via two major mitochondrial-cytosolic pathways. In the GLS-GDH-ME axis, glutaminase (GLS) converts glutamine to glutamate, which is then deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) to produce α-ketoglutarate (αKG). After undergoing TCA cycle metabolism to malate, mitochondrial malate is exported to the cytosol, where malic enzyme (ME) converts it to pyruvate [ 10 11 1  Fig. 1 Metabolism of lactic acid in normal and cancer cells Mechanism of lactylation modification Since its proposal in 2019 as a novel post-translational modification, protein lactylation has emerged as a pivotal regulatory mechanism in epigenetics, immunometabolism and cancer biology. This modification, characterized by the covalent attachment of lactate to lysine residues, occurs via two distinct mechanisms: enzymatic and non-enzymatic. A comprehensive overview of lactylation modification pathways is shown in Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Mechanism of lactylation modification Enzymatic lactylation: key components and mechanisms The enzymatic lactylation process relies on transferase enzymes that catalyze lactyl group transfer. Due to structural similarity between lactate and acetyl groups, the histone acetyltransferases EP300 (E1A-binding protein p300) and CREB-binding protein (CBP)—originally identified for acetylation—also function as primary lactyltransferases [ 6 12 13 14 15 16 19 20 In addition to classical writers/erasers, novel lactylation regulators have been identified. Elevated lysine lactylation correlates with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer. Lysine acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8), the first identified global lactyltransferase, promotes tumor progression by lactylating eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) at K408, thereby enhancing protein translation efficiency [ 21 22 23 24 26 Escherichia coli 27 Non-enzymatic lactylation: MGO-GLO1 axis Chemical lactylation occurs independently of enzyme activity. Methylglyoxal (MGO), a reactive glycolysis byproduct, reacts with glutathione to form lactoyl glutathione (LGSH) via glyoxalase 1 (GLO1). LGSH non-enzymatically transfers lactyl groups to lysine residues under pathological conditions such as hyperglycemia [ 28 1 2  Table 1 Lactylation transferase Lactylation transferase Location Substrate References EP300 Nucleus L-lactyl coenzyme A [ 6 KAT7 Nucleus L-lactyl coenzyme A [ 23 KAT8 Nucleus L-lactyl coenzyme A [ 21 22 AARS1 Cytoplasm Lactate-AMP [ 24 26 AARS2 Mitochondrial matrix Lactate-AMP [ 26 99 YiaC Prokaryotic cell Lactate-AMP [ 27  Table 2 Delactylases Delactylases Location References HDAC1 Nucleus [ 13 HDAC2 Nucleus and cytoplasm [ 61 100 HDAC3 Nucleus and cytoplasm [ 101 HDAC6 Nucleus and cytoplasm [ 14 HDAC8 Nucleus and cytoplasm [ 15 SIRT1 Nucleus and cytoplasm [ 16 SIRT2 Nucleus and cytoplasm [ 19 SIRT3 Mitochondrion matrix [ 17 18 CobB Prokaryotic cell [ 27 Machine learning based on lactylation-related gene in cancer prognostics Leveraging the sophisticated analytical prowess of machine learning, extensive datasets can be dissected to uncover complex lactylation patterns that may modulate tumor behavior and predict patient outcomes. Considering that recent foundational studies have identified numerous lactylation modification sites and enzymes involved in the reaction, the utilization of machine learning has significantly enhanced our ability to discover and exploit these sites. Moreover, with the progress of machine learning applications in cancer, researchers can more effectively understand and predict the progression and treatment of cancer. The sophisticated analytical capabilities of machine learning tools allow the analysis of large datasets to reveal complex patterns of lactylation that may influence tumor behavior and patient prognosis. The applications of lactylation are summarized in Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Machine learning applications in lactylation-related gene prediction Biomarker identification The identification of novel biomarkers related to lactylation through machine learning holds great promise for uncovering potential mechanisms and drug targets in cancer. By analyzing large-scale multi-omics datasets encompassing gene expression, protein modification patterns, and clinical features, researchers can develop sophisticated models capable of pinpointing specific lactylation sites that are critical for tumor progression. These identified sites subsequently serve as promising targets for new drug development, potentially revolutionizing the therapeutic approaches. Recent advances in proteomics have identified many lactylation modification sites across various cancer types. For example, in gastric cancer AGS cells, LC-MS/MS combined with machine learning found 2375 Kla sites in 1014 proteins, with KEGG and GO analyses indicating enrichment in spliceosome-related functions [ 29 30 31 32 33 34 In TNBC, 58 lactylation sites across 48 proteins were identified, delineating a distinct lactylation signature. Remarkably, H4K12lac has emerged as a potential biomarker in TNBC, providing critical insights into its lactylation profiles and highlighting the clinical significance of histone modifications [ 35 36 Traditional experimental approaches for identifying Kla sites, while somewhat successful, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and resource-demanding processes. These limitations have driven the development of computational methods for predicting Kla sites, which offer greater efficiency and convenience than experimental methods. However, existing computational methods have limitations, such as prediction accuracy being influenced by specific conditions and the challenge of fully replicating complex experimental settings. To address these challenges, researchers have developed various computational tools for the prediction of Kla sites. FSL-Kla, based on a Kla benchmark dataset and few-shot deep learning models, analyzes and assesses 11 types of feature encoding schemes [ 37 38 39 40 41 Current Kla site prediction models trained on non-breast cancer datasets face limitations due to cross-species and cellular context differences. While tools like FSL-Kla, DeepKla, and Auto-Kla have shown effectiveness in their respective domains, they may not fully capture breast cancer’s unique features. Thus, the development of breast-specific Kla site prediction models is crucial. These models would better account for the genetic and molecular characteristics of breast cancer, enhancing prediction accuracy and providing more reliable support for research and clinical practice. Predictive models and personalized medicine Researchers have developed machine learning prognostic models based on known lactylation modifications, enabling personalized medicine by predicting tumor behavior using lactylation features. These models assist clinicians in making informed decisions by estimating patient prognosis and selecting appropriate treatments. Numerous prognostic models based on lactylation modification target genes have been developed for various cancers, including lymphomas, hepatocellular carcinoma, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, glioma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, and breast cancer (Table 3  Table 3 Models based on lactylation Cancer Model genes Functions References Lymphomas Seven model genes Patient stratification and treatment selection [ 42 Hepatocellular carcinoma Eight-gene mode Risk stratification and therapeutic guidance [ 43 Clear cell renal cell carcinoma Sixteen gens ccRCC prognosis and tailored therapeutic approaches [ 102 Multiple myeloma Nine model genes Identification of high-risk patients and prediction of prognosis [ 103 Osteosarcoma Eight model genes Prognosis [ 104 Pancreatic adenocarcinoma Five core genes Prognostic evaluation [ 105 Glioma Twenty genes Immune microenvironment characterization and outcome prediction [ 106 Prostate cancer Five-gene model Disease-free survival and treatment responsiveness [ 107 Colorectal cancer Twenty-three gene model Survival outcomes and personalized treatment strategies [ 108 Gastric cancer Six-gene model Prediction of prognosis, clinical features, tumor behavior, and treatment strategies [ 109 Breast cancer Eight lncRNA model Prognosis and therapeutic drug sensitivity [ 44 Twenty-two gene model Prognosis prediction and potential drug targets [ 45 In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, lactylation influences prognosis, tumor immune function, and drug resistance. A lactylation-based risk score model helps predict prognosis and guides treatment choices. High-risk patients are more sensitive to Cisplatin and Etoposide, and thus may benefit more from the ESHAP (Etoposide + Methylprednisolone + High-dose Cytarabine + Cisplatin) protocol [ 42 43 In breast cancer research, machine learning has been used to predict prognosis and treatment responsiveness. One study developed a prognostic model using KLA-related lncRNAs via Cox regression and XGBoost. Patients were stratified by median risk score, revealing differences in survival, clinical characteristics, immune infiltration, treatment response, and drug sensitivity [ 44 45 These models demonstrate the potential of lactylation-based methods for personalized cancer treatment. However, the current studies have some limitations. Most studies used TCGA and GEO data for validation. To enhance reliability, additional datasets from different sources are needed for external validation, broadening the applicability of the predicted signature. Moreover, it is vital to thoroughly verify and clarify the complex mechanisms of KLA-related lncRNAs and mRNAs in various cancers through further well-designed and rigorously controlled experiments [ 46 Lactylation modification in tumor microenvironment The role of lactylation in the tumor microenvironment is an intricate and multifaceted area of oncological biology. This dynamic and heterogeneous ecosystem, composed of cancer, stromal, and immune cells and the extracellular matrix, significantly impacts cancer growth and treatment response. Lactylation plays a key role in regulating the interactions and functions of various cells within this environment, offering promising prospects for targeted cancer therapy. Direct effects on tumor cells Tumor cells, central to the tumor microenvironment (TME), are both the source of elevated lactylation and the beneficiaries of the Warburg effect. Most studies have shown that increased lactylation in these cells is closely linked to enhanced malignant traits. Lactylation modifications in tumor cells reflect the complexity of cellular signaling. They are diverse and are crucial for cellular communication.

YTHDF2 recognizes and degrades m6A-modified PER1 and TP53 mRNAs, accelerating tumorigenesis [ 48 49 Glioblastoma: H3K9 lactylation enriches the LUC7L2 promoter, activating its transcription. Histone lactylation also drives NF-κB-related LINC01127 expression, promoting glioblastoma stem cell self-renewal via the MAP4K4/JNK/NF-κB axis [ 50 51 Lung cancer: H3K18 lactylation increases POM121 expression, enhancing MYC activity and PD-L1 expression, and causing immunosuppression in non-small cell lung cancer [ 52 53 Colorectal cancer: Histone lactylation downregulates macrophage RARγ expression, promoting tumorigenesis via TRAF6-IL-6-STAT3 signaling [ 54 55 56 Liver cancer: PYCR1 promotes liver cancer cell growth and metastasis via regulating IRS1 expression through lactylation modification [ 57 58 59 Esophageal cancer: Hypoxia induces H3K9 lactylation, enhancing LAMC2 transcription and promoting esophageal cancer invasion and migration [ 60 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC): Lactate-induced H3K18la drives PDAC tumorigenesis and progression, correlating with adverse clinical outcomes [ 61 Gastric cancer (GC): H3K18 lactylation upregulates VCAM1 transcription, activating AKT-mTOR signaling and promoting tumor cell proliferation, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis. VCAM1 also increases CXCL1 expression via AKT-mTOR, recruiting hGC-MSCs and M2 macrophages [ 62 Bladder cancer: CircXRN2 activates the Hippo pathway by stabilizing LATS1, suppressing H3K18 lactylation-driven tumor progression [ 63 64 Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC): Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) inactivation triggers histone lactylation, creating a positive feedback loop with PDGFRβ signaling and driving ccRCC pathogenesis [ 65 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC): Lactate-induced H3K9la enrichment in the IL11 gene.

This leads to H4K12La-driven gene transcription and cell cycle deregulation, boosting anaplastic thyroid carcinoma proliferation [ 67 Non-histone lactylation Numerous non-histone proteins undergo lactylation, a key post-translational modification (PTM) that plays crucial roles in cellular activities and is strongly associated with essential physiological and pathological processes. Many researchers are investigating non-histone protein lactylation sites to uncover their biological functions and potential applications (Table 5 Lung cancer: Lactate-induced IGF1R protein lactylation drives lung cancer cell proliferation and metabolic reprogramming [ 68 69 Colorectal cancer: Intra-tumoral bacteria boost lactate production, prompting M2 macrophage polarization. This occurs because RIG-I lactylation inhibits NF-κB signaling, reducing Nlrp3 transcription by blocking NF-κB recruitment to the Nlrp3 promoter in macrophages. The subsequent Nlrp3 reduction impacts Tregs’ immunosuppressive activities and CD8 + T cells’ antitumor functions, contributing to colorectal cancer liver metastasis [ 70 21 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC): CCNE2 lactylation promotes HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion [ 17 71 72 Esophageal cancer: Hypoxia-induced Axin1 protein lactylation at K147 promotes its ubiquitination, enhancing glycolysis and cell stemness in TE1 and EC109 cells [ 73 74 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: RHOF acts as an oncogene in PC, upregulating c-Myc to boost PKM2 transcription.

To date, studies have primarily focused on histone lactylation, especially at the critical sites H3K18 and H4K12. Histone lactylation, driven by the elevated glycolytic rate in breast cancer cells, influences key oncogenes such as c-Myc, promoting tumor progression. C-Myc, crucial for cell proliferation and survival, is upregulated by lactylation and further activates SRSF10. This splicing factor modulates genes such as MDM4 and Bcl-x, linking metabolic changes to gene expression alterations and driving breast cancer development [ 81 82 83 84 Implications on immune cells In the tumor microenvironment, elevated lactate concentrations exert a pronounced influence on immune cells by driving rapid phenotypic and functional alterations, thus identifying potential targets for immunotherapeutic intervention. We will focus on the effects of lactylation on immune cells, such as macrophages, T-reg cells, T cells, natural killer cells (NK), and Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) [ 85 Lactylation modifications in tumor-associated cells can drive immune cells toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Macrophages, which are key players in the immune response, primarily exist in the M1 or M2 phenotypes. M1 macrophages are involved in acute immune reactions, whereas M2 macrophages are associated with parasitic diseases and exhibit an immunosuppressive phenotype within the TME. Previous research has shown that lactate can polarize the M2 immunosuppressive phenotype by stabilizing HIF-1α and inducing M2 genes such as Arg-1, Fizz-1, Mgl-1, VEGF, and PPAR-γ, thereby promoting tumor growth, metastasis, and invasion [ 86 54 87 88 89 6  Table 6 Lactylation modification in M2 Cancer types Lactylation site Signaling pathway References Colorectal cancer H3K18 Lactate-H3K18 lactylation-RARγ -IL-6-STAT3 [ 54 Cervical cancer H3K18 Lactate-H3K18 lactylation-GDP2-M2 polarization [ 87 Glioma H3K18 Lactate-H3K18 lactylation-TNFSF9-M2 polarization [ 88 Pancreatic cancer IGF2BP2 CTFT-IGF2BP2 lactylation-CSF1-M2 polarization [ 89 Regulatory T (Treg) cells are crucial for maintaining immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. High lactate concentrations affect Treg cell differentiation, stability, and function, inhibiting anti-tumor immunity and accelerating tumor progression [ 90 88 91 Comprehending these mechanisms is critical for developing strategies to overcome immunosuppression and augment immunotherapy effectiveness. By targeting lactylation-associated pathways, it may be possible to adjust the tumor immune microenvironment, reverse immunosuppressive phenotypes, and enhance patients’ responsiveness to immunotherapeutic treatments. Treatment based on lactylation modification The previous discussion identified numerous abnormal histone modification sites and alterations in the activity of histone-modifying enzymes in cancer. These aberrant modifications and changes in the expression of modifying enzymes can serve as valuable biomarkers for accurate screening, detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of tumors. Given that different enzymes catalyze modifications at specific histone sites, targeting these histone-modifying enzymes with oncogenic potential represents a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Targeted therapies based on lactylation modification are summarized in Fig. 5  Fig. 5 Treatment based on lactylation modification Targeted lactylation modification enzymes Post-translational modifications, such as lactylation, can be adjusted by targeting the responsible enzymes. Intracellular lactylation levels are regulated by targeting writers, such as p300, and erasers, such as HDACs and SIRT enzymes. C646, an inhibitor of the lactylation writer enzyme p300, inhibits breast cancer growth by promoting cellular apoptosis through reducing H3K27 lactylation [ 92 17 Targeting metabolic pathways related to lactylation modification The metabolic changes in cancer cells, particularly increased glycolysis and lactate production, represent a unique vulnerability that can be exploited for therapeutic benefits. Targeting lactate production by inhibiting glycolytic enzymes and lactate transporters offers a multifaceted approach to combat cancer, underscoring the importance of metabolic research in developing novel cancer therapies. The primary ingredients extracted from traditional Chinese medicine, such as Royal jelly acid and Evodiamine, are used to regulate glycolytic lactylation modification to inhibit the growth, migration, and proliferation of tumor cells. Royal jelly acid inhibited HCC development through interfering with lactate production and inhibiting H3 histone lactylation at H3K9la and H3K14la sites [ 93 94 Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting lactylation modifications Emerging antitumor strategies target lactylation modifications beyond traditional metabolic pathway inhibitors. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play diverse roles in diseases [ 95 63 96 97 98 The roles of circular RNA and eccDNAs in cancer lactylation modification are complex and not fully explored. Further research is necessary because of their significant potential for anti-tumor effects. Understanding their specific functions in cells and their effects on tumor development could reveal new treatment strategies, improve the survival and quality of life of cancer patients, and provide insights into the treatment of other diseases. Discussion Lactate, a pivotal byproduct of tumor glycolysis, and its derived lactylation modifications, are essential for numerous biological processes, including gene expression regulation, cell signaling transduction, and inflammatory response coordination, and significantly influence disease occurrence and development. Specifically, lactylation modifications can regulate the tumor microenvironment and reshape tumor metabolism. They can also lead to the lactylation of both histone and non-histone proteins under the influence of specific enzymes. These modifications play a significant role in tumor growth, proliferation, migration, drug resistance, and immune evasion, making them potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Current research is concentrated on several key areas, and details are provided in Fig. 6  Clarifying the mechanisms of lactylation modifications within tumor cells.

Developing novel drugs based on the identified targets.  Fig. 6 Current research hotspots in the field of lactylation modification Despite considerable progress, researchers still encounter emerging research directions and challenges in this field. In breast cancer, lactylation modifications constitute a nascent research frontier that offers novel insights. This review delineates the mechanisms of lactylation modifications in various cancers, including breast cancer, their influence on the tumor microenvironment, the application of machine learning, and progress in drug research. However, the clinical application of lactylation modifications requires further investigation to ensure their efficacy and safety. The key considerations are as follows:  Normal cell toxicity: Research should focus on understanding the potential toxicity of lactylation modifications in normal cells to ensure that therapeutic strategies do not harm healthy tissues. Physiological impacts: Evaluate the effects of lactylation modifications on key physiological processes, such as growth metabolism and embryonic development, to ensure the safety of lactylation-targeted therapies. Mechanisms and networks in breast cancer: Explore the mechanisms and epigenetic regulatory networks of lactylation modifications in breast cancer, including their regulation of tumor metabolic pathways and their influence on the tumor microenvironment. Subtype-specific networks and sites: Identify specific regulatory networks and lactylation sites within different breast cancer subtypes to develop more precise therapeutic approaches. Immunotherapy applications: Investigate the application of lactylation modifications in immunotherapy, given their role in tumor immune suppression, to develop novel combination therapies that enhance anti-tumor immune responses. Clinical challenges: Address potential challenges in clinical practice, such as adverse drug reactions, resistance, side effects, and safety concerns, to ensure the effective and safe translation of lactylation-based therapies into clinical settings. Gaining deeper insights into lactylation modifications within the tumor microenvironment will enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. This knowledge will pave the way for identifying new therapeutic targets and improving the outcomes of patients with cancer. Lactylation modifications are crucial for tumor metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion. As we expand our understanding of their roles in the tumor microenvironment, we will better understand the processes driving cancer development. This lays the foundation for developing novel therapies and enhancing the prognosis of cancer patients.
