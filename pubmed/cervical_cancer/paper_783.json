Objectives This study aims to present the diagnostic process, surgical management, and postoperative chemotherapy options in a patient initially diagnosed with vaginal neuroendocrine carcinoma, later confirmed to have PVM. Additionally, we provide a systematic review to enhance awareness of PVM, reduce misdiagnosis, and improve early detection. Methods A systematic review of the literature was conducted, and a case report was analyzed. Results A total of 89 publications were reviewed, summarizing the various treatment strategies and survival outcomes for PVM. In the reported case, postoperative pathology confirmed the diagnosis of PVM, differentiating it from primary vaginal neuroendocrine carcinoma. The treatment involved partial vaginal excision and removal of lesions from the posterior vaginal wall, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide and cisplatin. Conclusion PVM is highly malignant with a poor prognosis, and surgical resection remains the primary treatment modality; however, its efficacy is limited. While chemotherapy may benefit some patients, the five-year survival rate ranging from 5 to 25%. Therefore, the development of novel therapeutic strategies is crucial. Recent advancements in immunotherapy and targeted therapies targeting BRAF/KIT mutations show promise, but standardized diagnostic and treatment protocols are still lacking. Future multicenter, long-term studies are needed to develop individualized treatment plans based on molecular profiling, providing an evidence-based approach to optimize diagnostic strategies and improve survival rates.

Its etiology remains unclear, with an average onset age of 57 years [ 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 Case report General information A 72-year-old woman presented with “vaginal discharge for over 4 months” and was referred to our hospital in April 2024 after a local hospital colposcopy suggested suspected cancer. She had menopause at age 48, with 5 pregnancies and 4 deliveries, and no significant medical history. Physical examination by gynecologist showed normal female distribution of pubic hair, no redness or swelling of labia majora and minora; cauliflower-shaped anterior wall of the vagina was visible in the lower third of the anterior wall of the vagina, with a diameter of 5 cm, still movable, and blood stained on palpation (+); cervix of the uterus was smooth and atrophic; uterus was anteriorly positioned, with rhombic contraction; parietal uterus was soft, and uterosacral ligament had no abnormality palpated; no abnormality was palpated in the adnexal areas of the two adnexa; rectum was smooth on palpation of the anus and the rectum, and blood stained on retraction of the finger ligament. Examination Biopsy of vaginal wall In April 2024, a biopsy of the vaginal wall was performed in our hospital, which reported “cancer of the anterior wall of the vagina”, tending to be low-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and the immunohistochemistry supplemented with a pathology report suggesting “malignant tumor of the anterior wall of the vagina”, which combined with the HE and immunohistochemistry results tended to be neuroendocrine carcinoma, and was limited by the biopsy and the immunohistochemistry expression. Due to biopsy limitations, immunohistochemical staining was suboptimal, necessitating further histological typing postoperatively. Immunohistochemical results showed: Syn (-), CgA (-), CD56(+), PAX8(-), P16(-), Ki-67 (about 70%+), ER (-), P63(-), P40(-), CK5/6(-), and CK7(-) (see Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Preoperative pathology biopsies. a b c d TCT examination TCT was performed in April 2024, which revealed atypical squamous epithelial cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US) detected by cervical liquid-based cell slides. Imaging examination The patient was admitted to the hospital to improve CT examination, suggesting an irregular soft tissue mass in the vagina, measuring about 4.1 × 2.8 cm, with uneven enhancement after enhancement and poor demarcation from the urethra. Pelvic MR was further improved, suggesting an irregular vaginal mass of about 3.2 cm×2.3 cm×2.6 cm (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Pelvic MRI findings. a b Diagnosis and differential diagnosis Based on the results from preoperative vaginal wall biopsy, TCT, CT, MRI, and other auxiliary examinations, vaginal neuroendocrine carcinoma was considered as a possible diagnosis. Surgical treatment Following the completion of necessary preoperative examinations and preparations, the patient underwent partial vaginal resection, anterior vaginal wall repair, and urethral repair under anesthesia in May 2024. During the procedure, a cauliflower-shaped mass was identified on the anterior vaginal wall, located in the middle to lower third of the vagina. The mass was movable, and at its upper pole, the base was closely adhered to the urethra, with no discernible gap between the two. The mass was excised through careful separation from the vaginal base, and the procedure was completed without complications. Postoperative pathology Gross Examination: The mass was identified to be in connection with the peritoneum, measuring 4.5 × 3.5 × 1.8 cm. On sectioning, the surface appeared gray to gray-yellow, with a solid, medium texture. Pathological Findings: The pathology report suggests a malignant tumor of the anterior vaginal wall, classified as Clark level V. The pathological stage is pT4bN0M0, indicating stage IIC. Breslow thickness was approximately 15.0 mm. The tumor showed a mitotic figures with a density of about 45 cells/mm², and demonstrated both tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and neural invasion. Immunohistochemistry Results (Fig. 3 )  Fig. 3 Routine pathology examination of vaginal mass. a b c d e f g h i Postoperative chemotherapy Postoperative chemotherapy was initiated in June 2024 to improve survival and prognosis. Given tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, nerve invasion, and no contraindications, the patient received one cycle of temozolomide (250 mg/day on Days 1–5) and cisplatin (50 mg on Day 1, 40 mg on Day 2). During the chemotherapy course, supportive treatments including antiemetics, gastric protection, and hydration were provided. The patient was discharged from the hospital one week following surgery. Treatment results, follow-up, and regression One month after the operation, a CT scan revealed partial absence of the vagina, with unclear demarcation between the local tissue and the urethral wall, consistent with postoperative changes. The remaining structures were unremarkable compared to previous scans, showing no significant abnormalities. A follow-up CT scan performed three months postoperatively showed no definitive abnormalities. Four months after surgery, in September 2024, a reoperation was conducted due to the recurrence of a mass on the posterior vaginal wall. The mass, located in the middle and lower third of the vagina, measured approximately 2 cm, had a wide base, and was movable. Postoperative pathology confirmed the mass was located on the posterior vaginal wall and surrounding tissues, with no notable abnormalities. A subsequent CT scan three months after the second operation showed no significant changes. Systematic review Materials and methods Search strategy Conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 (Priority Reporting Items for Systematic Evaluation and Meta-Analysis) guidelines, the research questions were presented according to the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study Design (PICOS) criteria (Tables 1 2  Table 1 The PICOS criteria used in this study The PICOS criteria for the treatment modalities and prognosis of primary vaginal malignant melanoma Patients Those diagnosed with primary vaginal melanoma through histopathology Interventions Comprising surgical treatment, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy Comparisons Other treatment modalities or no treatment Outcomes The overall survival rate, recurrence-free survival rate, and follow-up results Study designs Any type of study design  Table 2 Search strategies and results Databases Expression for retrieval Criteria for screening Number of results Date of last search PubMed Skin Neoplasms[Mesh] AND vagi* AND prima* The publication time was limited to January 2015 to January 2025 67 January 20, 2025 Melanoma[Mesh]) AND Mucous Membrane[Mesh] AND vagi* AND prima* 5 Primary vaginal melanoma OR Primary vaginal melanomas OR vaginal melanoma OR (Primary malignant melanoma OR Primary malignant melanomas) AND vagi* 242 prima* AND Melanoma[Mesh]) AND Vaginal Neoplasms[Mesh] 35 Cochrane library (MeSH descriptor: [Vaginal Diseases] explode all trees) AND (MeSH descriptor: [Melanoma] explode all trees) 1 (“primary” AND (“vagina” OR “vaginal”) AND (“melanoma” OR “malignant melanoma” OR “vaginal melanoma” OR “melanocytic tumor” OR “genital melanoma” OR “vaginal neoplasm”)) 9 Embase ‘vagina disease’/exp AND ‘melanoma’/exp AND primary AND [2015–2025]/py 245 Web of Science ((TI=(Primary vaginal melanoma)) OR TS=(Primary vaginal melanoma)) OR TS=(vaginal melanoma OR primary vaginal melanocytic tumor OR primary vaginal malignant melanoma OR primary vaginal melanotic tumor OR primary vaginal pigmented melanoma) 1120 ((((TS=(melan*)) OR TS=(skin cancer)) OR TS=(skin carcinoma)) AND TS=(vagi*)) AND TS=(prima*) 1359 ((TS=(vaginal)) AND TS=(melanoma)) AND TS=(primary) 568 The keywords: melanoma, skin cancer, mucosal cancer, vagina, primary, were searched through PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane and other databases, and the Boolean operators “AND” and “OR” were used to combine the search terms. The Boolean operators “AND” and“OR” were used to combine the search terms, and the search results were as follows: Citations were managed using EndNote 21 to eliminate duplicates. We conducted a comprehensive search for references to systematic evaluations on similar topics, relevant studies not identified in our initial search, and studies that were not registered in publicly accessible databases. The search was performed from January 20, 2025, through PubMed and Web of Science. The initial search retrieved 3,650 results, and no relevant articles were found in the Cochrane Database. After removing 1,759 duplicates using EndNote 21, a total of 1,891 articles were selected for title and abstract screening. Of these, 1,789 articles were excluded, and 102 articles underwent full-text screening. Thirteen reports were excluded because they did not meet the PICOS criteria for systematic evaluations. No studies were identified during the full-text analysis that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Ultimately, 89 reports were included, comprising 50 case reports, 39 case series, and cohort studies (Fig. 4 ) Inclusion and exclusion criteria The inclusion criteria were as follows:  patient age > 18 years. histopathologic diagnosis of primary vaginal melanoma. corresponding treatment modalities and survival were reported. Exclusion criteria were as follows:  the results of the study were non-full-text article types, such as conference abstracts, posters, abstracts only, or no full text available. the disease reported in the study was not primary vaginal melanoma or there were no survival outcomes. Articles not reported in English. The selection process included reading the title and abstract, reading the full text, and extracting data by two independent reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements.  Fig. 4 PRISMA flow chart of the literature search and article selection Results Design, characteristics, interventions, and treatment outcomes of cohort studies, case series, and other studies (Supplementary Material 1: Table 3 [ 9 46 Thirty-eight studies (2015–2025) were included, comprising 16 case series, 1 prospective cohort, 20 retrospective cohorts, and 1 systematic review. Median ages ranged from 48 to 77 years, with most vaginal melanoma patients aged 60–70 years. Surgery was the initial treatment in 28 studies, with approaches including wide local excision and extended procedures (e.g., vaginectomy, hysterectomy, bilateral tubo-ovariectomy with/without pelvic contouring), often combined with adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy. Patients, interventions, and treatment outcomes in case reports (Supplementary Material 1: Table 4 [ 1 5 8 24 47 85 The case reports were published from 2015 to 2024, with a wide age range of patients, ranging from 40 to 89 years. There were 16 cases in the age group of 40–59 years, 18 cases in the age group of 60–79 years, and 6 cases in the age group of 80 years and above. The distribution of patients in different age groups suggests that the disease occurs in all age groups, but is relatively concentrated in the 60–79 age group. The depth of tumor infiltration was not explicitly mentioned in most of the case reports, and the depth of infiltration ranged from 0.2 mm to 23 mm in cases with explicit data. The depth of tumor infiltration varied widely, reflecting the diversity of the disease. The majority of patients were treated with surgery as initial therapy in 25 cases, 10 underwent total vaginal resection and or hysterectomy with or without abdominal contouring, and 10 patients underwent limited surgery (including wide localized resection) alone or in combination with other modalities, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as initial therapy in 6 cases. Immunotherapy was used as initial treatment in 6 cases. Immunotherapeutic agents included ibritumomab/navumumab, etc. Seven patients underwent pelvic radiotherapy in postoperative adjuvant therapy, five patients received immunotherapy, and one patient was treated with multiple immunotherapeutic agents (navumumumab, pembrolizumab, and ibritumumomab) after radical surgical resection. Three patients received chemotherapy. one patient was treated with (albumin-bound paclitaxel/carboplatin/bevacizumab) followed by continuation of the same regimen as adjuvant therapy; one patient was treated with paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy after extensive hysterectomy, pelvic lymph node dissection, and total vaginectomy; and another patient was treated with adjuvant cisplatin/adriamycin + hypofractionated radiotherapy in the absence of definitive initial therapy. Recurrence was explicitly reported in 5 cases. Among them, 1 case showed recurrence but the time was not specified; 2 cases recurred 4 months after surgery; 1 case recurred 7 months after treatment, and 1 patient recurred, which was treated with brachytherapy and its condition was unknown after 2-month follow-up MRI. Three patients died. A total of 14 patients with clear survival information had no recurrence and survived during the corresponding follow-up time. A total of 5 patients were lost to follow-up. Only 3 patients reported OS, 1 patient with an OS of 22.2 months; another patient died at 22 months; and 1 patient died 7 months after treatment, but it was not clearly expressed whether it was OS or not. Bias and quality assessment A summary of the bias and quality assessment is provided in Supplementary Material 1: Tables 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, which is available in the Supplementary Material. In terms of quality assessment, the included cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The results indicated that most studies were of moderate or higher quality regarding study design, between-group comparability, and the completeness of outcome metrics. However, some studies exhibited deficiencies in controlling for confounders and ensuring the completeness of data during long-term follow-up. Case reports and case series were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. Most of these studies showed a high risk of selection bias and lacked appropriate controls, requiring careful interpretation, particularly concerning the consistency of diagnostic criteria and completeness of follow-up. Single-arm trials were evaluated based on the modified Cowley criteria. The findings revealed some methodological limitations in key areas such as randomization and blinding implementation. Despite these limitations, these studies still provided a reasonable level of clinical evidence. The independent two-person review process and third-party arbitration mechanism effectively minimized subjective judgment discrepancies, thereby ensuring the reliability of the quality assessment results. This approach provided a robust foundation for evidence grading in the subsequent systematic review. Discussion Primary vaginal malignant melanoma (PVM) is an extremely rare neoplasm of the female genital tract, accounting for approximately 3% of all melanomas in this region. It is associated with a poor prognosis, with a five-year survival rate ranging from 5–25% [ 4 72 This study not only highlights the complexity of primary vaginal malignant melanoma (PVM) in clinical diagnosis and treatment but also offers new insights through case reports combined with a systematic evaluation. Compared to previous studies, this research is innovative in two key aspects: First, it is the first to report the differential diagnostic process between PVM and vaginal neuroendocrine carcinoma, clarifying diagnostic points through dynamic analysis of immunohistochemical markers, such as the progressive coloration of SOX10, HMB45, and other indices. These findings provide novel diagnostic clues for distinguishing between these two highly similar tumor types. Second, the systematic evaluation incorporated 89 publications from the decade spanning 2015–2025, expanding the time frame compared to prior studies and offering a more comprehensive view of the evolving treatment patterns. Among the 89 reviewed publications, the patient characteristics of primary vaginal malignant melanoma (PVM) revealed that the age range of patients spanned from 40 to 89 years, with 65% of patients falling within the 60–79 age range. This is consistent with findings from other studies suggesting that middle-aged and elderly women are a high-risk group for PVM [ 4 Of the studies included, 28 selected surgery as the initial treatment modality, which encompassed wide local excision, vaginectomy, and hysterectomy. In some cases, patients also received a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgery is widely regarded as the primary treatment for primary vaginal malignant melanoma (PVM) due to its efficacy in tumor resection and symptom relief. Several studies have demonstrated that patient survival following surgery is closely linked to the chosen surgical approach. In cases with small or localized tumors, wide excision has been shown to effectively control the lesion and reduce the risk of recurrence. For instance, a study by Todo et al. (2016) found that patients who underwent wide local excision exhibited a 5-year survival rate ranging from 19 to 41%, depending on tumor stage, with a significantly lower recurrence rate compared to more conservative surgical approaches [ 19 37 2 22 Several studies have highlighted the effectiveness of chemotherapy and immunotherapy (e.g., nivolumab and ibritumomab) as postoperative adjuvant therapies, particularly for patients at high risk of recurrence. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have notably advanced the treatment of various tumors, such as melanoma, especially in patients with advanced or metastatic disease. The combination of nivolumab and ibritumomab has demonstrated enhanced efficacy and improved survival outcomes [ 86 12 87 72 20 13 ( 88 The limitations of this study are threefold. First, the sample size constraints inherent in case reports result in insufficient statistical power, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Second, the substantial heterogeneity among the original studies included in the systematic review (e.g., variability in surgical modalities, ranging from local excision to pelvic contouring) hampers the ability to perform meaningful subgroup analyses. Lastly, the absence of long-term follow-up data—only 35% of the studies reported a 5-year survival rate—prevents an accurate assessment of long-term efficacy. Furthermore, there is a lack of standardized criteria guiding current treatment decisions. In summary, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of PVM diagnosis and treatment through a multidimensional analysis, emphasizing the need for refined pathological diagnoses and the individualization of treatment strategies. Despite the limitations imposed by the study design, the systematic review highlights key therapeutic trends and emerging treatment approaches that can inform future research. Future prospective clinical trials should prioritize three critical areas: establishing a stratified treatment system based on molecular profiling, determining the optimal timing for surgery in combination with immunotherapy, and developing novel localized therapeutic devices tailored to the anatomical features of the vagina. These initiatives are expected to overcome the current therapeutic limitations and improve survival outcomes for PVM patients. Conclusion This study examines the challenges and advances in the management of primary vaginal malignant melanoma (PVM) through a case report and a systematic review of cases over the past decade. The lessons learned from this case, initially misdiagnosed as neuroendocrine carcinoma, underscore the importance of heightened “melanoma vigilance” in the diagnosis of vaginal malignancies. Moreover, the use of deep multisite biopsies, such as the SOX10/HMB45/Melan-A combination test, is crucial for preventing misdiagnosis. Key findings regarding the surgical treatment outcomes of this patient after recurrence are as follows: the patient presented with an isolated recurrent lesion (approximately 2 cm in size) on the posterior vaginal wall 4 months after the initial surgery. The lesion was excised, and no abnormalities were observed during the 3-month follow-up. This suggests that surgical excision may still provide effective short-term disease control and progression-free survival for patients with locally confined recurrent lesions. Despite the successful control of localized lesions through secondary surgery, it is important to remain vigilant due to the high metastatic potential of PVM. Systematic evaluations indicate that current treatment modalities include surgical resection, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. However, the absence of standardized treatment protocols has led to significant variability in clinical practice. Surgery remains the cornerstone for localized lesions, but its efficacy is limited when used alone. Recent advancements in immunotherapy have substantially improved survival rates for patients with advanced disease, particularly those with BRAF/KIT/NRAS mutations. Future research should prioritize standardized treatment guidelines through molecular profiling-based individualized protocols and multicenter trials to validate survival benefits. This aligns with recent consensus recommendations emphasizing the need for structured management of vaginal neoplasms [ 89 Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1: Tables 3-11.
