UBC originates from the urothelial cells that line the bladder 1 2 3 2 4 2 5 6 4 1 Interrelated biochemical pathways, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis, may play a significant role in the development of UBC. Moreover, both inflammation and oxidative stress may lead to the activation of angiogenesis and tumor progression in UBC patients 7 8 7 9 10 Genetic factors can also influence UBC´s risk, susceptibility, and prognosis, and changes in oxidative stress-related genes are primarily reported in this context. Glutaredoxin 2 (GRX2) is a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase encoded by the GLRX2 11 S 12 13 1 In GRX2-deficient mice, it was demonstrated that this protein intermediates O 2 ·− 2 2 14 15 16 17 GLRX2 Despite its underexplored role in cancer susceptibility and prognosis, in colon adenocarcinoma patients, higher immunohistochemical expression of GRX2 correlates with higher tumor histological grade, more depth of invasion, regional lymph node involvement, angioinvasion, and disease staging. Additionally, 93% of patients with grade 3 tumors have low GRX2 expression 11 The rs912071 in the GLRX2 18 19 ERCC5 ERCC5 ERCC5  Fig. 1 ( a b Therefore, the present study focused on investigating whether the polymorphism rs912071 (C > T) in the GLRX2 GLRX2 Materials and methods Design of the study This project has been approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Londrina (CAAE:47092521.2.0000.5231). Following the Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments, written informed consent was obtained from all study participants. This study included 341 patients diagnosed with UBC of both sexes, consecutively recruited from the Hospital do Câncer de Londrina (HCL), Londrina, Paraná, South Brazil. Patients were diagnosed through transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and tissue biopsy between 2020 and 2022. None of the participants had other oncologic diseases. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained using a standard questionnaire at the individual’s admission 20 21 None of the patients had received chemotherapy or radiotherapy before sample collection. Biopsy examination of the transurethral resection or cystectomy included histology, tumor grade, and disease stage. Pathologists staged tumors according to the 2017 Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system guidelines and graded them according to the 2004 WHO/ISUP (World Health Organization/International Society of Urological Pathology) classification. Blood samples were collected from study participants in EDTA-containing vacutainer tubes using a standard peripheral venipuncture method. The blood was centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min, and the leukocyte-rich interphase and plasma samples were separated and divided into aliquots, then stored at − 80 °C until use. Medical information was collected from the patient’s records. It included tumor details such as grade, histology, invasiveness of the muscle layer (MIBC and NMIBC), and clinical data regarding UBC recurrences within specific time frames: (i) up to 6 months, (ii) up to 1 year, and (iii) up to 2 years. The control group consisted of men and women, matched by sex, age, and smoking habits with the patients. Individuals undergoing routine examinations at the Hospital de Clínicas da UEL or participating in recreational activities at the Senior Citizens Community Center in Londrina, Paraná, were sampled as controls. They had not been previously diagnosed with any cancer. Assessment of systemic levels of oxidative stress in plasma The lipoperoxidation profile and nitric oxide metabolite (NOx) levels were evaluated as oxidative stress parameters in plasma samples from patients ( N N N 22 24 22 Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping DNA extraction was performed using a commercial kit (PureLink™ Genomic DNA Mini Kit, CAT: K182002), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA was resuspended in nuclease-free water and stored at or below − 40 °C pending analysis. Sample quantification was performed using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop™ 2000/2000 Spectrophotometers - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). After quantification, the samples were diluted to a concentration of 1.1ng/uL for genotyping. The PCR reactions for the allele discrimination analysis of the GLRX2 25 GLRX2 Total RNA was extracted from frozen normal and tumor bladder tissue ( N ® The cDNA synthesis was performed using total RNA and a High-Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.

Fisher’s exact test was employed to examine the association between genotypes and prognostic parameters. The one-sample t-test compared the mean ages of this study with the global mean 30 Data distribution was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test in the oxidative stress parameters. The Student’s t-test, ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U test were used according to the sample distribution characteristics. Data are described as mean ± standard deviation.

In the overdominant model, hypertensive patients carrying the heterozygous CT genotype were protected from one-year recurrence (OR = 0.191/CI = 0.037–0.977). When evaluating tumor characteristics, hypertensive patients with the heterozygous genotype showed protection against the development of high-grade tumors (OR = 0.188/CI = 0.069–0.514) (Table 4  Table 4 Statistical analysis of the rs912071 polymorphism in the GLRX2 Prognosis/Variable Model Genotype ( N OR (IC95%) p value One-year recurrence/- No Recessive CT + CC (144) Reference Yes TT (153) 2.475 (1.174–5.218) 0.017* One-year recurrence/- No Overdominant CC + TT (171) Reference Yes CT (126) 0.460 (0.214–0.989) 0.047* One-year recurrence/hypertension No/No Overdominant CC + TT (105) Reference Yes/Yes CT (72) 0.191 (0.037–0.977) 0.047* Tumor grade/hypertension Low/No Overdominant CC + TT (111) Reference High/Yes CT (73) 0.188 (0.069–0.514) 0.001* GLRX2 OR CI * p Oxidative stress markers and interaction with patients’ characteristics, GLRX2 Lipid peroxidation and NOx levels were evaluated as markers of oxidative stress in patients and controls.

In comparison, heterozygosity (CT) was shown to be a protective factor, and hypertensive patients with this genotype also had protection against high-grade tumors. UBC patients have more lipid peroxidation and nitric oxide metabolites than control individuals. When the redox state parameters were evaluated according to genotype, TT individuals exhibited higher lipid peroxidation and NOx levels. Data from TCGA showed that, in general, all tumor tissues have higher expression of GLRX2 GLRX2 Although GLRX2 11 31 32 34 35 in silico GLRX2 Increased NOx levels and lipid peroxidation in patients compared to controls suggest the diagnostic potential of these markers of oxidative stress. Reactive nitrogen species, including nitric oxide and peroxynitrite, are known to mediate cellular damage and influence cancer-related signaling. Prior studies have similarly reported elevated oxidative stress markers in UBC patients, such as increased NOx 36 37 38 We further explored the occurrence of relapses in relation to genotypes, and the heterozygote (CT) genotype is a protective factor against relapses, even in individuals with hypertension. These results suggest that patients with the CT genotype may have optimal concentrations of GRX2. In a study conducted with germline GRX2 knock-out mice, Mailloux et al. 39 GLRX2 40 GLRX2 NOx concentrations were even higher in hypertensive patients than in non-hypertensive patients, which could be related to antihypertensive drug intake. Ghasemi et al. 41 42 43 The heterozygous genotype (CT) of the polymorphism rs912071 was associated with a decreased risk of high-grade tumors in hypertensive UBC patients. Hypertension alone has been described as a protective factor for the development of UBC 44 11 GLRX2 GLRX2 42 45 46 TCGA data reveal elevated GLRX2 47 48 GLRX2 GLRX2 Elevated GRX expression in tumors may reflect a mechanism by which cancer cells evade oxidative stress-induced apoptosis through enhanced antioxidant defenses 49 50 51 GLRX2 It is essential to acknowledge some limitations of the study: (i) some data still presents wide confidence intervals due to the small number of individuals in the one-year recurrence group; (ii) the low number of normal samples, which made it impossible to evaluate gene expression according to genotypes; (iii) analysis of protein expression could help prove the hypothesis that rs912071 polymorphism appear to be associated with low protein expression.
