Background HPV infection is a common sexually transmitted infection that can cause cervical cancer if left untreated. According to the World Health Organisation, in 2022, cervical cancer, resulting from HPV infection, ranked as the fourth most common cause of death for women globally. There were approximately 660,000 new cases and approximately 350,000 deaths attributed to this disease. Globally, HPV is responsible for approximately 90% of cervical cancers diagnosed in women, which is a leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality. In addition to cervical cancer, HPV is also linked to a significant proportion of other anogenital cancers (such as vaginal, vulvar, anal cancers) and some oropharyngeal cancers. However, HPV is not associated with breast cancer, which is another common cancer among women. This study aimed to determine the awareness of HPV infection screening and vaccination among nurses in Vhembe district of Limpopo province, South Africa. Methods This study utilised a quantitative approach and a cross-sectional descriptive design.115 registered nurses from 15 randomly selected clinics in the Vhembe district. Data collection was carried out through self-administered questionnaires, and analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the collected data, with outcomes presented through frequency charts and tables. Results Of the 115 respondents, 78.3% of the respondents reported that they had never received any formal training on HPV infection screening procedures, such as how to perform the screening or sample collection for HPV infection testing. The study results also revealed that the majority, 60% of the respondents, were unaware that HPV infection does not always manifest its signs and symptoms. Of 115 respondents, the majority, 79.1%, were unaware that HPV infections do not always require treatment. The majority of the 86.1% of respondents believed that HPV infection does not cause cervical cancer. On the contrary, 13.9% of the respondents believed that HPV infection can indeed cause cancer of the cervix. Conclusion The study concluded that nurses have a low level of awareness of HPV infection. Furthermore, it is recommended that HPV infection screening short training programmes are designed for newly qualified nurses and experienced nurses to improve their knowledge. Limited understanding of HPV infection among nurses may contribute to patients receiving insufficient information about HPV infection. human papillomavirus human papillomavirus screening and vaccination HPV awareness HPV vaccination awareness HPV screening awareness University of South Africa 10.13039/501100008227 The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

HPV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact, making it the most common sexually transmitted infection globally. While other non-sexual transmission routes have been suggested in literature, including vertical transmission and contact with contaminated surfaces, sexual activity remains the predominant route of transmission for HPV ( 1 2 3 4 42 4 5 6 7 3 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 14 10 In South Africa, provincial data revealed that Limpopo province is one of the provinces with the highest HPV infection prevalence rate at 59% following Gauteng with 64% and Eastern cape with 63% ( 15 16 17 18 19 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study design This study utilised a quantitative research method, involving the counting, measuring, and statistical analysis of data. Employing a cross-sectional descriptive survey design allowed the collection of extensive data from a single location simultaneously ( 20 2.2 Study setting This study was conducted specifically within Thulamela Municipality, one of the four local municipalities in the Vhembe District of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Thulamela covers a largely rural area, with a population of approximately 618,462 people living in over 140,000 households ( 21 2.3 Sampling and sampling procedure The study population was relatively small; therefore, a census approach was employed whereby all available respondents were included. Specifically, RNs, RANs, and RENs within the selected clinics were targeted. For the sampling of clinics, probability sampling was utilised to ensure that each clinic within the Thulamela municipality had an equal chance of inclusion. A simple random sampling technique was implemented to select 15 clinics from a total of 49. Each clinic was assigned a unique identifier, and the identifiers were mixed thoroughly. The researcher then manually selected 15 identifiers at random to form the sample. This process ensured that every clinic had an equal chance of being included. 2.4 Data collection instrument The researcher used a questionnaire as the tool to collect data. All questions were closed-ended and formulated in English. The questionnaire was developed from another study that assessed knowledge, attitude, and awareness of HPV and modified to accommodate all the objectives of this study ( 6 43 2.5 Validity and reliability Validity ensures the research’s integrity, ensuring that a reliable tool gauges what it is intended to assess and accurately assesses genuine distinctions among variables, excluding any consistent errors ( 22 22 22 2.6 Data collection procedure The researcher collected data with the research assistant, who visited the selected clinics in the Vhembe district of Thulamela municipality after receiving ethical clearance. The respondents received details of the study, that is, how the study would be conducted, any risks and advantages of the research to the respondents, which were clarified with the respondents before beginning with data collection. Respondents, who expressed their willingness to participate in the study, received a consent form. By signing the form, they agreed to participate in the research. Data collection was done at the selected clinics in the Vhembe District under Thulamela municipality. The nurses who were to participate in the study received questionnaires to complete during lunch time or during their free time, which took 25 to 30 min to complete. The researcher distributed and collected the questionnaires on the same day to minimise non-responses and to prevent respondents from not returning questionnaires. 2.7 Data analysis Data analysis is defined as exploring and organising the collected data to have meaningful results ( 23 2.8 Ethical considerations Ethical clearance was obtained from the University of South Africa (reference number: 63279401-CREC-CHS-201), and further permission to conduct the study in selected Thulamela clinics was granted by the Limpopo Department of Health (reference number: LP-202201-021) and the Vhembe District office (reference number: S5/4/2/3). Respondents were provided with an information letter outlining the study’s purpose, aims, potential benefits, and risks. The researcher verbally explained this information, and informed consent was obtained in writing from those who agreed to participate. Furthermore, in this study, the respondents who participated were 18 years and older, and therefore could give their consent on their own, as stated in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. Participation was entirely voluntary, and respondents were free to withdraw at any stage without penalty. Confidentiality and anonymity were ensured by using unique respondent codes, e.g., 001, instead of personal identifiers. All data were securely stored under lock and key to prevent unauthorised access. The study design and questionnaire were carefully developed to avoid causing any emotional, physical, or social harm to the respondents. 3 Results The data were collected from 115 respondents. Descriptive analysis was conducted to acquire the percentages and frequency distribution of socio-demographic data, involving aspects such as occupation, age, gender, HPV infection screening, and HPV infection workshop/training. As well as inferential statistics analyses. In this study, the researcher returned to the selected clinics and gave the questionnaire back to the respondents on two different occasions to determine whether the results would be the same. In this research study, Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was 0.638, which was deemed acceptable as the correlation coefficient approached 1 (one). A summary of this socio-demographic data was compiled and presented in Table 1 Supplementary Table S1 Table 2 Supplementary Table S2 Table 3 Table 1 Socio-demographic data of respondents ( n Demographic characteristics Frequency Percentage Gender Females 106 92.2% Males 9 7.8% Age 20–24 years 3 2.6% 25–35 years 17 14.8% 36–45 years 29 25.2% 46–55 years 53 46.1% 56–66 years 12 10.4% 67–75 years 1 0.9% Type of record RN 76 66.1% REN 19 16.5% RAN 20 17.4% Table 2 HPV infection general awareness examination ( n HPV infection general awareness examination Percentage Frequency HPV is associated with the development of cervical cancer True 99 86.1% False 16 13.9% Engaging in multiple sexual relationships increases the likelihood of contracting HPV infection True 102 88.7% False 13 11.3% HPV infection can be transmitted through sexual intercourse True 76 66.1% False 39 33.9% An individual might have HPV infection for an extended period without being aware of it True 101 87.8% False 14 12.2% HPV infection does not always manifest obvious signs or symptoms True 46 40.0% False 69 60.0% HPV infections are not very common True 59 51.3% False 56 48.7% There are many types of HPV True 86 74.8% False 29 25.2% Men cannot get HPV infection True 48 41.7% False 67 58.3% Consistent condom use can reduce the risk of contracting HPV infection True 75 65.2% False 40 34.8% HPV infection can spread from one individual to another through direct skin-to-skin contact in the genital area True 64 55.7% False 51 44.3% HPV is responsible for the development of genital warts True 79 68.7% False 36 31.3% Antibiotics can be used to treat HPV True 60 47.8% False 55 52.2% HIV/AIDS is caused by HPV True 41 35.7% False 74 64.3% Most people who are sexually active will likely encounter HPV infection at some stage in their lifetime.

On the contrary, only 12.2% of the respondents showed a lack of understanding of this characteristic of HPV. Respondents with a lack of knowledge on HPV infection also lack awareness of the information regarding HPV. The study outcomes revealed that 60.0% of respondents were unaware that HPV infection may not always present with visible symptoms. In contrast, 40.0% correctly identified that HPV infection may remain asymptomatic, indicating a moderate level of awareness regarding the virus’s manifestation. A supplementary analysis excluding male respondents was conducted to explore gender-specific awareness patterns. For example, in response to the statement “HPV infection does not always manifest obvious signs or symptoms,” the number of false responses was higher when all participants were included. However, when only female data were considered, the true responses increased, indicating greater awareness among respondents. Further details are provided in Supplementary Table S2 A statistically significant correlation was found between gender and knowledge of HPV infection symptom presentation, with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of −0.225 and a p p The outcomes of this research indicated that the majority of 52.2% of the respondents believed that antibiotics can be used to treat some of the symptoms caused by HPV infection, while 47.8% respondents were aware that HPV infection symptoms cannot be treated by antibiotics. The collected data indicated that 35.7% of nurses show a lack of awareness that HPV infection is not responsible for causing Human Immunodeficiency Syndrome/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS). In addition, 64.3% of the nurses show a high level of awareness that HPV infection is not responsible for HIV/AIDS. In this research study, 68.7% of nurses showed a high level of awareness that sexually active people are at high risk of contracting HPV infection in their lives, and this virus can be contracted through only one episode of unprotected sexual intercourse. Furthermore, 31.3% of nurses showed a low level of awareness that sexually active people have a high probability of contracting HPV infection in their lives. The study findings revealed that a significant majority of 85.2% of nurses were conscious that engaging in sexual intercourse at a young age increases the likelihood of acquiring HPV infection. Moreover, the exposure to HPV infection may happen after a single sexual experience, while a small proportion of only 14.8% were unaware of this connection. A significant negative relationship was observed between age and knowledge about the risk of engaging in sexual intercourse at a younger age, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of −0.218 and a p Table 3 4 Discussion According to the results of this study, nurses showed a low level of awareness and understanding regarding the human papillomavirus. Limited HPV infection awareness among nurses can impact patients/women negatively. The more nurses know about HPV infections, the more patients/women are also aware of HPV infections and able to take preventive measures against HPV infections. The findings revealed that the respondents in the study were predominantly females, with males’ representation being minimal. The high level of female nurses may be due to the belief and attitude of male nurses that they will be called ‘sisters’ as their female counterparts are called in the profession. However, they can be referred to as ‘professional nurse Mushasha” instead of “sister Mushasha.” In a study conducted in urban India, it was found that of 318 respondents, 71 were men and 247 were women ( 24 25 26 A greater proportion of RNs participated in the study compared to RENs and RANs, suggesting that the perspectives captured are more representative of the RN category. The results of this study are in line with the findings of the study carried out at the Nelson Mandela Bay Clinic in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The study results revealed that among the 110 nurses who participated in the study, 79 were RNs. However, the RENs numbered more than the RANs ( 25 26 27 The findings revealed a widespread misconception among respondents, with most not recognising the link between HPV and cervical cancer. This highlights a critical gap in knowledge that may hinder effective prevention and early detection efforts. In this study, the results contradicted the outcomes of the study carried out in Western China, which reported that 53.4% of the 1,109 respondents were aware that HPV could cause cancer of the cervix, and 46.6% were unaware of which diseases were caused by HPV ( 28 29 The study showed that while the majority of respondents understood that HPV infection is transmitted through sexual contact, including anal, oral, and vaginal sex, a notable proportion remained unaware of these transmission routes. This highlights ongoing gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed through targeted education, unlike a previous study in Limpopo Province, where most people, 85.1%, did not know how HPV infection spreads. In that study, some mistakenly thought that kissing, 3.2% or unprotected sex, 2.1%, could transmit HPV infection. Furthermore, 9.60% of the respondents stated that sexual intercourse is the main mode of HPV infection transmission ( 30 31 p 32 p 33 The study found that most respondents were aware of the existence of multiple HPV types. Notably, awareness was higher among nurses with over 5 years of experience and those who had received HPV infection screening training, suggesting that both experience and targeted education play a crucial role in improving HPV-related knowledge. The conclusions of this research contrast with those of the earlier study on Moroccan women’s knowledge, perception, and willingness to receive the HPV vaccine. The study found that few women were aware of HPV and its different types. 131 respondents had better awareness, while 759 respondents had no awareness about HPV and its types ( 34 p There was a lack of knowledge about HPV infections related to the awareness of HPV, its infections, and prevention. Seyfettinoglu & Hark ( 35 36 The findings also revealed that while just over half of the respondents were aware that HPV infection can be transmitted through direct skin-to-skin contact in the genital area, a substantial proportion lacked this knowledge. This gap highlights the need for clearer communication about the modes of HPV infection transmission in healthcare training. Women’s beliefs and attitudes also play a role in how they look at certain diseases and how they can affect them. The results of this study concurred with those of a study conducted by Tian et al. ( 37 36 The findings revealed mixed understanding among respondents regarding the treatment of HPV-related infections. While some believed that antibiotics could be used, nearly half lacked awareness or held misconceptions about appropriate treatment approaches. This highlights the need for clearer education on the management of viral infections caused by HPV. A woman who is aware of HPV and its infection, or has a history of having HPV infection, or has a family member who suffers from HPV infection, may identify these as cues to action, which can lead to understanding that antibiotics cannot be used to treat HPV infection. Sypie & Zielonka ( 38 6 39 The findings demonstrated that most nurses were aware of the link between early sexual activity and an increased risk of acquiring HPV infection. However, a small proportion remained unaware, suggesting the need to reinforce this aspect in sexual health education. Women’s belief that there is no possibility of being infected with HPV may lead them to engage in early sexual intercourse. A significant negative relationship was observed between age and knowledge about the risk of engaging in sexual intercourse at a younger age, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of −0.218 and a p 40 41 5 Conclusion The study findings underscore a concerning lack of awareness among registered nurses about HPV screening and vaccination. This knowledge gap highlights a potential shortfall in healthcare provision, as nurses play a crucial role in patient education and preventive care. Consequently, it is imperative to implement HPV infection training programmes aimed at newly qualified nurses and experienced physicians to enhance their understanding and proficiency in managing HPV-related issues. By improving nurses’ knowledge through targeted education initiatives, healthcare facilities can ensure that patients receive complete and accurate information on HPV, its risks, and preventive measures. Failure to address this limited understanding of HPV infections among nurses may not only compromises patient care but also perpetuates inadequate awareness and understanding of HPV infections within the broader community. Thus, investing in ongoing education and training for nurses is essential to improve public health outcomes and combat the spread of HPV infections. We express our gratitude to all nurses who participated in this study.
