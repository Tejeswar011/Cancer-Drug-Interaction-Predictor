Despite recent studies emphasizing the role of specific bacterium-derived metabolites in immune cell development and differentiation, the mechanisms linking microbiota absence to systemic immune deficits remain incompletely defined. Here, droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing of bone marrow and peripheral blood from both germ-free and specific pathogen-free mice was performed, identifying 25 transcriptionally distinct cell types.

Experiments were conducted under rigorously controlled conditions to ensure microbial sterility in GF mice. Over 35 000 high-quality single cell transcriptomes were analyzed to compare immune cell composition and gene expression between GF and SPF mice, with the aim of delineating microbiota-dependent immune regulation. Findings were validated using multiple complementary approaches. Mice Male Kunming (KM) mice (10 weeks), both GF and SPF, were provided by the Huazhong Agricultural University Experimental Animal Center (China). The GF mice displayed the classical features of microbial absence, including an enlarged cecum and a profoundly underdeveloped immune system. The KM mouse strain, originally derived from Swiss albino mice, is widely used in biomedical research in China due to its high disease resistance, large litters, and rapid growth ( Li et al., 2020 Yu et al., 2014 Yu et al., 2017 Li et al., 2020 GF mice were maintained in sterile isolators with strict exclusion of microbial exposure. SPF mice were housed in a dedicated pathogen-free isolator in a specific pathogen-free environment to prevent cross-contamination. All mice were kept on a 12 h light:dark cycle under controlled conditions (temperature: 25±2°C, humidity: 45%–60%) with ad libitum Sample preparation and cell isolation for scRNA-seq Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and blood was collected via retroorbital puncture. Following disinfection with 75% alcohol, an incision was made through the skin and muscle between the hip joints using sterile ophthalmic scissors. Lower limbs were detached at the hip, and surrounding muscle tissues were carefully removed with scissors and cleaned with gauze. Femurs and tibias were excised by cutting at the ankle and approximately 1 cm distal to the tibiofibular junction to expose the marrow cavity. Cartilage at both ends was trimmed to expose the red marrow, which was flushed from the bone cavity using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Fresh blood and bone marrow aspirates were transported and stored at 4°C for 24 h. For cell isolation, samples were filtered through 40-μm sterile strainers and centrifuged at 300 × g g g Library preparation ScRNA-seq was performed using the 10x Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kit v.3.1, followed by library construction. Approximately 16 000 cells were loaded per sample for gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM) generation and barcoding. Final libraries, ranging from 200 to 9 000 bp, were size-selected. The average fragment size, used as the insert size for library quantification, was determined by analyzing 1 μL of a 1:10 diluted sample using an Agilent Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity chip (Agilent Technologies, USA). Libraries were sequenced using the MGISEQ-2000 system (BGI, China) with paired-end reads. Statistical analysis All P t Non-targeted metabolomics Non-targeted metabolomic profiling was conducted on cecal content, feces, and serum collected from GF ( n n Wen et al., 2017 t Preprocessing of scRNA-seq data Single-cell RNA sequencing reads were aligned to the mm10 mouse reference genome using Cell Ranger v.6.0.2 (10x Genomics, USA). Unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based gene expression profiles were generated for each cell that passed quality control thresholds. Only confidently mapped, non-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) duplicates with valid barcodes and UMIs were retained for further analysis. From PB, 10 504 cells were derived from GF mice and 11 323 cells were obtained from SPF mice. From BM, 10 693 cells were derived from GF mice and 9 247 cells were obtained from SPF mice. Cells with UMI/gene numbers beyond three standard deviations from the mean, or with mitochondrial gene expression exceeding 10%, were filtered out to remove low-quality, likely multiplet, or dying captures. After filtering, 18 344 high-quality PB cells (median: 1 426 genes per cell) and 16 537 high-quality BM cells (median: 1 391 genes per cell) were retained for downstream analyses. UMI counts were normalized using the NormalizeData function in the Seurat (v.4.0.3) package, applying a natural logarithmic transformation (base e) Data integration and dimensionality reduction To integrate datasets across conditions, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was applied using the FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions in Seurat (v.4.0.3) ( Butler et al., 2018 Zhang et al., 2019 Quantification of differences between major clusters To quantify differences in cell-type distributions between GF and SPF mice, Bhattacharyya distances were calculated for each cell identity. Analysis was restricted to clusters containing more than 400 cells in both groups ( Cillo et al., 2020 t Differential expression analysis Cluster-specific marker genes were identified using the FindAllMarkers function in Seurat, applying the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. For direct comparisons between GF and SPF mice, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the MAST (v.1.18.0) method via the FindMarkers function. DEGs with |log fold change|>0.26 and P Gene functional annotation Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed using the clusterProfiler package (v.4.0.5) ( Yu et al., 2012 P Pseudotime inference To infer cellular differentiation trajectories, Monocle3 (v.1.3.1) ( Cao et al., 2019 Cell-cell interaction analysis Cell-cell communication was assessed using CellChat (v.1.1.3) ( Jin et al., 2021 RESULTS Underdeveloped immune system confirmed by routine blood tests in GF mice PB was collected from GF ( n n Table 1 Figure 1A 9 9 P P P P Kovtonyuk et al., 2022 Table 1 P Table 1 Routine blood tests in germ-free (GF) and specific pathogen-free (SPF) Kunming mice Test (unit) GF ( n SPF ( n P- WBC, white blood cell count; LYM, lymphocyte count; MON, monocyte count; NEU, neutrophil count; EOS, eosinophil count; BAS, basophil count; LYM%, lymphocyte ratio; MON%, monocyte ratio; NEU%, neutrophil ratio; EOS%, eosinophil ratio; BAS%, basophil ratio; RBC, red blood cell count; HGB, hemoglobin; HCT, hematocrit; MCV, mean cell volume; MCH, mean cell hemoglobin; MCHC, mean cell hemoglobin concentration; RDWc, red cell distribution width (CV); RDWs, red cell distribution width (SD); PLT, platelet count; MPV, mean platelet volume; PCT, plateletcrit; PDWc, platelet distribution width (CV); PDWs, platelet distribution width (SD); N/A, not applicable.

DEGs were first identified for each immune cell identity, and their distribution was visualized using UMAP ( Figure 1E Cillo et al., 2020 + Figure 1F Together, these data define key transcriptional and compositional differences between GF and SPF mice, with pronounced alterations in neutrophils and monocytes ( Figure 1E HCAR2 activation as a potential mechanism regulating neutrophil abundance Bone marrow continuously generates neutrophils through cytokine signaling (such as G-CSF), with subsequent release into blood circulation ( Furze & Rankin, 2008 Kramer et al., 2014 Manz & Boettcher, 2014 Figure 2A Grieshaber-Bouyer et al., 2021 Figure 2 HCAR2 signaling as a potential regulator of neutrophil abundance in GF mice A: UMAP plot showing partitioning of neutrophils into four developmental periods (P1–P4).

As a result, excess NA is redirected toward alternative metabolic products, including trigonelline, NAM, and nicotinuric acid (NUA). The accumulation of NA and its derivatives may contribute to the up-regulation of Hcar2 Enhanced bacterial recognition and impaired antiviral responses in GF mouse monocytes Monocytes and macrophages are critical mediators of immune regulation, contributing to immunosuppression, tissue repair, resolution of inflammation, bacterial clearance, atherosclerosis, and fibrosis.

B: Heatmap showing differential interaction counts and strengths between immune cell types. Top and right plots represent the sums of the columns and rows (incoming and outgoing signals), respectively. Red (blue) represents increased (decreased) signaling in GF mice compared with SPF mice. C: Bar plot showing differences in information flow for each signaling pathway between GF and SPF mice. Information flow is defined as the sum of communication probabilities among all pairs of cell groups in the inferred network (i.e., total weight in the network). Significant signaling pathways were ranked based on differences in overall information flow within the inferred networks between GF and SPF mice. Top signaling pathways in red are enriched in SPF mice, and in blue are enriched in GF mice. D: Chord plots showing detailed BST2 pathway interactions. Edge colors are consistent with sources as senders, and edge weights are proportional to interaction strength. Thicker edge lines indicate stronger signals.

E: Violin plots illustrating Bst2 Pira2 To further quantify differences in intercellular communication, CellChat was used to calculate pathway-level signaling distance among the 24 cell groups in the GF and SPF datasets ( Figure 4C Bst2 Ishikawa et al., 1995 Pira2 Bst2 Figure 4D Urata et al., 2018 Bst2 Despite widespread Bst2 Bst2 Figure 4E Bst2 El-Sherbiny et al., 2020 Le Tortorec et al., 2011 Pira2 Cao et al., 2009 DISCUSSION Although GF rodent colonies have been in use for nearly eight decades, providing considerable understanding of microbial function ( Kennedy et al., 2018 Among myeloid cells, neutrophils and monocytes were especially depleted in GF mice, consistent with previous reports from antibiotic-treated models ( Khosravi et al., 2014 Macallan et al., 1998 Kobayashi et al., 2017 Hcar2 Taggart et al., 2005 In antibiotic-treated mice, monocytes exhibit reduced migratory capacity and decreased abundance in peripheral tissues ( Emal et al., 2017 Zhang et al., 2015 Josefsdottir et al., 2017 Zhang et al., 2015 Figure 1G Vcan Analysis of intercellular signaling further implicated impaired antiviral immunity in GF mice. CellChat-based inference revealed broad reductions in signaling activity across multiple immune cell populations, with marked suppression of BST2-mediated communication. Bst2 Cao et al., 2009 Ishikawa et al., 1995 Bst2 Bst2 Dolowy & Muldoon, 1964 Mirand & Grace, 1963 Schaffer et al., 1963 How microbiota-derived metabolites affect the development of immune cells such as neutrophils through systemic circulation was also explored. While fecal and cecal samples from GF mice displayed pronounced alterations in metabolic composition, serum metabolite differences were modest. This discrepancy likely reflects dilution of localized metabolic changes in whole-body serum pools, suggesting that microbiota–host interactions may exert regionally restricted effects—particularly within the gastrointestinal tract or liver—that are not readily detected in systemic circulation. In summary, GF mice exhibit broad immunodeficiency across multiple immune lineages. This study provides a foundational framework for understanding immune underdevelopment in the absence of microbiota. The resulting reference dataset serves as a valuable resource for studying microbiota-host immune system crosstalk and provides a reference for future efforts to design interventions targeting immune dysfunction driven by microbial dysbiosis. LIMITATIONS This study has several limitations to mention. First, the sample size was relatively small, with only GF and one SPF mouse used in both the discovery and validation stages. However, both PB and BM samples were collected from the same individuals in the discovery cohort, ensuring that there was no sample bias between tissue types. Second, the scRNA-seq data generated using the droplet-based 10× Genomics Chromium platform exhibited incomplete coverage, especially with respect to neutrophils in the PB subset. This limitation is inherent to the platform, which often underrepresents mature neutrophils and other granulocytes due to their low RNA content, high RNAase activity, and other inhibitory compounds, leading to the detection of fewer transcripts and sequencing reads. CONCLUSIONS This study provides preliminary insights into the potential mechanisms underlying immune system underdevelopment in GF mice based on integrated scRNA-seq and non-targeted metabolomic analyses, warranting further investigation with larger sample sizes. Results showed a marked decline in immune cell abundance, particularly neutrophils and monocytes, in GF mice. Analyses suggested that the reduction in neutrophils may be associated with changes in niacin metabolism, potentially related to the absence of microbial niacin dehydrogenase.
