PGMs have been used notably in industrial, electronic, and medical applications. For example, Ir-192 is often utilized in industry to detect structural defects in metal and assess pipeline integrity. Pd-104 is irradiated to produce Pd-103 seeds, used for prostate cancer treatment. Other isotopes of elements in this group can be sourced to facilitate critical applications, discussed in this review. Due to their unique chemical and nuclear properties, these metals may be promising candidates for various nuclear medicine applications, including diagnostic imaging via Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT). This review will explore PGMs in nuclear medicine, focusing on their production routes, nuclear characteristics, and suitability for past and future development of radiopharmaceuticals. We will highlight methods for radiochemical separation and purification of each radionuclide, discussing potential challenges and emphasizing the need for further research to ensure sustainability. As the demand for advanced nuclear medicine techniques continues to grow, PGMs may play a significant role in addressing current challenges in the field. We will discuss several radionuclides of interest to nuclear medicine including 191 193m 195m 103 109 103m 105 191 192 97 103 platinum group metals platinum palladium rhodium osmium iridium ruthenium nuclear medicine Department of Nuclear Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Platinum was first discovered in the sixteenth century in Colombia's Choco district, where four additional PGMs—palladium, rhodium, osmium, and iridium—were classified three centuries later by William H. Wollaston and Smithson Tenant ( 5 5 5 6 Platinum-based compounds, especially in the oxidation states of 2+ and 4+, have been widely, and successfully, utilized for the treatment of many types of cancers ( 2 7 2 3 8 7 9 11 11 4 5 12 13 14 15 4 16 17 18 16 2 7 In addition to PGM compounds being utilized in traditional medicine, PGMs also contribute towards nuclear medicine due to useful nuclear decay properties essential for imaging or radionuclide therapy. In this review, a detailed evaluation of select PGM radionuclides, tracing their past developments and current successes or challenges towards advancement in nuclear medicine. Their nuclear properties will also be discussed, along with reviewing production routes and radiochemical separation methods that enable high purity radionuclide preparation. Moreover, key results from either pre-clinical or clinical studies, are reported, along with a discussion on how PGMs may be added as novel tools to the toolkit of modern nuclear medicine. Through this review, we aim to illustrate whether PGMs are a luxurious dream or a key to the future of molecular imaging and radionuclide therapy. 2 Platinum and platinum-based radionuclides Naturally occurring platinum isotopes include: 190 192 194 195 196 198 19 191 193m 195m 188 189 197 2.1 Platinum-191, 191 Due to its nuclear decay properties, 191 γ I γ I γ 20 2.1.1 Production and radiochemical separation of 191 Multiple production routes for 191 Table 1 21 191 22 23 6 2 20 191 nat 193 20 24 in situ Table 1 Production pathways for platinum-based radionuclides.

Over the past decade, there have been notable progressions with differing radionuclides, whether through demonstration of optimal production routes and conditions, innovative separation techniques, or implementation of novel compounds for in vivo in vitro 192 To expand upon 191 193m in vivo 193m 72 195m 103 103 109 in vivo 109 103m 103 103m 103 103m in vivo 105 192 191 191m 192 97 103 in vivo In conclusion, we provide a comprehensive review of platinum group metals that have been explored upon over the years, or those that are beginning to make their mark in nuclear medicine applications. These radionuclides offer essential nuclear characteristics that can elevate current areas of necessities, complimenting traditional radionuclides that are utilized in clinical practice. For patients, this could mean more precise imaging options, more effective treatments with fewer side effects, and personalized radiotherapy; therefore, extending the lifespan for someone. As we look ahead, the potential for PGM implementation continues to be promising. With continued efforts from across the world, what was once considered a luxurious dream in nuclear medicine may well become a future breakthrough for diagnostic imaging and cancer therapy with PGMs leading the way.
