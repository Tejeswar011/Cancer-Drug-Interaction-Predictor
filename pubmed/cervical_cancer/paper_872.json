Therefore, we study retrospectively analyzed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to explore the risk factors and construct a novel DM prediction nomogram for DM in patients with PTMC (PTMC-DM). Data of patients with PTMC, covering 2004 to 2015, were gathered from the SEER database. Cox proportional hazards regression, Kaplan Meier methods and log-rank tests were conducted to identify the independent prognostic factors for predicting DM. These significant prognostic factors were used for the development of an DM prediction nomogram. Totally 27,933 PTMC samples gathered from the SEER database, 72 patients (0.26%) had PTMC-DM at the time of diagnosis and 107 (0.38%) died from thyroid disease, were divided into training cohort and validation cohort (score construction and internal validation) at random. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that T stage, N stage, gender, and age were independent risk factors for DM in PTMC patients. The prognostic nomogram we constructed was also for DM. Additionally, calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) curves revealed that the nomogram has excellent clinical utility. The prognostic characteristics of PTMC-DM were systematically reviewed. Our constructed nomogram predicts survival to assist clinicians in making individualized treatment decisions.

Advances in early screening and diagnostics have increased PTC incidence, yet mortality rates remain stable [ 3 5 2 6 9 PTMC is typically indolent with low mortality, leading to recommendations for less aggressive treatments like AS or ablation for low-risk cases. However, debates persist due to varying definitions of low-risk PTMC and differing global research perspectives. Studies indicate that over 15% of PTMC patients under AS require surgery due to tumor growth, lymph node involvement, or psychological distress. U.S. data from 2000 to 2018 show a rising PTC mortality rate, from 0.42 to 0.50 per 100,000, with adverse outcomes linked to PTMC-DM and larger tumors [ 10 14 15 16 7 17 18 Materials and methods Patients and data collection The data used in this research comes from the SEER database, which was accessed through the SEER*Stat software (version 8.4.2). The latest update to the database was in December 2022, with the newest information dating back to 2020. Patients eligible for the research were those diagnosed with PTMC from 2004 to 2015, as defined by ICD code 9.1.3. All included patients underwent surgical treatment. Data on patients used for analysis consisted of factors like year of diagnosis, sex, age at diagnosis, race (classified as white, black, or other), marital status at diagnosis, tumor site, type of pathology, TNM stage, tumor size, presence of lymph node metastasis, monitoring of regional lymph node surgery, invasion of distant organs by the tumor, length of survival, reason for death, and current survival status. Patients were excluded from the study if they were not aware of a primary malignant tumor, had a survival time of less than 1 month, did not have lymph node detection, or had incomplete basic clinical information. Ultimately, data from 27,933 patients were collected based on both inclusion and exclusion criteria. In this research, the diagnosis was determined using the TNM staging system, specifically referencing the AJCC sixth Edition. Tumors in situ are categorized as T1, T2, T3, and T4, while regional lymph nodes are classified as N0, N1a, and N1b. DM is categorized as M0 or M1. Statistical analysis Analysis of the data was performed with R software 4.3.2. Continuous variables were summarized as either median ± standard deviation or median with quartile interval representation. Categorical variables were presented as numerical values and percentages, and analyzed using either a Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. Univariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify potential risk factors for DM. Independent risk factors were determined by analyzing odds ratios (ORs) of age categories using univariate and multivariate logistic regression, with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated and documented. Nomogram models were created using these risk factors to predict the probability of DM. The Nomogram prediction model was evaluated using the calibration curve, area under the ROC curve, and individual ROC curves for each risk factor. Internal validation was performed using the Bootstrap method, and the clinical utility of the model was assessed with DCA decision curve analysis.

Examination of demographic traits showed a notably larger percentage of women in comparison to men in both the training group (80.77%) and validation group (81.59%). Furthermore, there was a greater proportion of patients living in urban regions (90.09% in the training group and 89. 90% in the validation group) compared to those in rural areas. The most common tumor differentiation grade seen was grade I-II, with rates of 89.53% in the training group and 99.70% in the validation group. The most common T and N categories were T1 (93.46% in the training group, 93.51% in the validation group) and N0 (87.90% in the training group, 88.23% in the validation group). Furthermore, All variables had P-values greater than 0.05, indicating that there was no significant difference in the distribution of these categorical variables between the training and validation groups. Therefore, the Chi-square test demonstrated that the bias was completely randomized (see Table 1 Incidence cases and survival analysis of CSS of PTMC Figure 1 1 1 1 1 1 p 1  Fig. 1 Cancer-specific survival analysis of PTMC patients.

Analysis using a single variable was performed on 9 possible factors, revealing that 7 factors—age, gender, ethnicity, residence type, tumor stage, lymph node stage, and tumor size—were strongly linked to DM. In addition, an analysis using multivariate logistic regression showed that individuals under 18 years old or over 65 years old, along with those with elevated T and N stages, were identified as independent risk factors for DM in patients with PTMC (Table 2 Creation and verification of the Nomogram and Decision curve analysis to assess clinical usefulness in predicting DM A predictive tool, known as a nomogram, was created to estimate the likelihood of developing DM in individuals with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) based on four separate factors (Fig. 2 2 2 2 3  Fig. 2 Construction and validation of a diagnostic nomogram. A B C D E F G  Fig. 3 Comparison of area under the receiver operating characteristic curves between nomogram and all independent factors, including T stage, N stage, Age and Gender in the training set ( A B Discussion Research indicates a rising incidence of PTMC cases over time, yet a corresponding increase in mortality rates has not been observed. Specifically, among 78,770 PTMC patients, 336 (0.43%) succumbed to the disease [ 1 19 A comprehensive analysis of 65,146 cases of papillary thyroid cancer from the SEER database (2004–2015) revealed 27,933 PTMC patients, of whom only 72 (0.26%) developed distant metastases and 102 (0.37%) had disease-specific death, suggesting that PTMC-DM is very rare. Clinical studies indicate an 8. 8% incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury following thyroid surgery, often leading to persistent complications such as voice alteration and swallowing dysfunction, which may significantly impact patients’ long-term quality of life [ 20 13 15 14 Through an examination of the fundamental clinical attributes of 27,933 patients, it was observed that the majority of individuals were middle-aged and young females presenting with a clinical stage of T1N0M0 (Table 1 p 1 2 This model quantifies the data of patients’ basic clinical pathological characteristics, which can improve the readability of the data for clinicians. It will be helpful for clinicians to stratify the risk of PTMC in patients and formulate an individualized treatment plan to avoid overtreatment or delayed treatment. This study adopts the sixth edition of AJCC thyroid cancer guidelines, contrasting with the clinically prevalent eighth edition. While both editions align in defining PTMC distant metastasis, discrepancies emerge in age stratification, T-stage, and N-stage criteria. Notably, the age threshold ascends from 45 in the sixth edition to 55 in the eighth, potentially reflecting increased life expectancy. T-stage variations remain inconsequential for our cohort of PTC patients with tumors ≤ 1 cm. However, the eighth edition’s refinement of N-stage, distinguishing N1a from N1b, enhances our analytical precision, prompting the adoption of N0, N1a, and N1b classifications in data analysis to bolster model accuracy. The sample size utilized in this study consisted of 27,933 cases, yet the limited number of positive cases, specifically 72, may introduce bias into the prediction model. Consequently, the model’s utility in informing patient treatment plans is restricted to a supplementary role, necessitating close integration with clinical practice. During data processing, we excluded questionable and incomplete data to enhance accuracy. Future studies will expand the sample size to further validate and improve the model’s practicality. This model is established based on retrospective analysis of a public database, which imposes certain limitations. Future research will integrate artificial intelligence algorithms to enhance its predictive accuracy and applicability. Ultimately, the Nomogram is expected to be a useful instrument in forecasting the probability of distant metastases in individuals with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), aiding in the development of tailored and accurate treatment plans to avoid premature initiation of transition therapy.
