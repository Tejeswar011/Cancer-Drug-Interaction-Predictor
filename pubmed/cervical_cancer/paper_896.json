Utilizing data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, the study included 6046 women with primary vaginal cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2020. The propensity score matching (PSM) method was employed to balance comparison groups and account for confounding factors. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS), with Cox proportional-hazards regression models used for statistical analysis.

Most suspected vaginal malignancies correspond to metastatic lesions from cervical or vulvar cancer, or metastases to the vagina from other sites (e.g. breast, endometrium, trophoblast, ovarian, lymphoma). Although vaginal cancer is more common in postmenopausal women, there has been an increase in the diagnosis of primary vaginal cancer among young women in countries with a high incidence of HIV, which is associated with the persistence of high-risk HPV infection ( Adams et al Miyamoto and Viswanathan, 2013 Kesic et al Feng et al Krajc et al Hong et al The SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database, recognized for its comprehensive and population-based cancer surveillance in the USA ( Lee et al Sasaki et al Previous studies have shown that marital status, as one of the important psychosocial factors, would influence patients survival in non-small cell lung cancer ( Chen et al Chen et al., 2024a Zhou et al Jatoi et al Mao et al This study aims to harness the PSM approach to investigate the impact of marital status on the survival outcomes of women with primary vaginal cancer, utilizing data extracted from the SEER database. By employing precise matching techniques, we aim to mitigate the influence of potential confounders, thereby yielding more robust and reliable conclusions. Materials and methods Ethics approval and consent to participate The SEER database provides publicly available data for this study, which means that obtaining informed consent from participants or ethical approval from an institutional review board is not necessary. We obtained access to the 2000–2020 SEER Research Data File by signing a Data-Use Agreement that outlines the terms and conditions for access. Data source and patient selection The study utilized data from the April 2023 release of the SEER database, encompassing 17 registries with data from November 2020. The SEER*Stat software (version 8.4.3; National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) facilitated the extraction of data, and the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition (ICD-O-3), was employed to identify patients with primary vaginal cancer, specifically focusing on those diagnosed between 2000 and 2020. This process yielded 6999 cases of primary vaginal carcinoma (primary site C529). Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) absence of data on race and marital status; (2) unknown primary site surgery; (3) incomplete or unclear follow-up time or cause of death records. The detailed study process is depicted in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Flowchart describing the inclusion and exclusion of patients. Variable classification Demographic data collected from the SEER database included age (categorized as <50 years, 50–59 years, 60–69 years, 70–79 years, ≥80 years), race (white, black, and other), and marital status (married, single, separated/divorced, widowed), with the latter three categories combined into the unmarried group. Tumor characteristics encompassed the year of diagnosis (grouped as 2000–2005, 2006–2010, 2011–2015, and 2016–2020), pathological type (classified as squamous cell carcinoma: 8050–8089, adenocarcinoma: 8140–8389, melanoma: 8720–8799, epithelial cell carcinoma: 8010–8049, and other types), and whether it was first primary malignancy. All primary tumor sites were located in the vagina (site label 529). Treatment-related variables included the administration of surgery or radiotherapy at the primary site. Outcome measurement The primary outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). OS was defined as the time from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or the last follow-up, including patients who were still alive at the end of the study period, which encompasses all causes of mortality, focusing solely on whether the individual has died, regardless of the underlying reason. CSS was calculated as the time from diagnosis to death specifically attributed to primary vaginal cancer, while deaths due to other causes were excluded from the outcome measurement. Survival times were recorded on a monthly basis, starting from the date of diagnosis and ending upon occurrence of death, loss to follow-up, or the end of the follow-up period. Statistical analysis Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies and percentages, and differences between married and unmarried groups were assessed using the chi-square test. To identify potential prognostic factors and estimate hazard ratios, both univariate and multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models were utilized. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed to estimate relative mortality risks. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. To accurately assess the importance of marital status on the prognosis of patients with vaginal cancer, a 1-to-1 PSM was conducted using the nearest-neighbor method with a caliper of 0.03, as implemented in the R package ‘MatchIt’. The basic principle of PSM involves using a propensity score to encapsulate the influence of multiple confounding variables. Each participant’s propensity score is calculated and sorted in ascending order. For every participant in the exposed group, one or more participants from the nonexposed group are randomly selected as matched counterparts, based on the proximity of their propensity scores. PSM can simulate the random allocation used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and minimize potential confounding factors between married and unmarried group. All statistical analyses were conducted using R (version 4.3.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). A two-sided P Results Baseline characteristics of vaginal cancer patients We extracted data on 6999 patients diagnosed with vaginal cancer between 2000 and 2020 from the SEER database.

Propensity score matching for married and unmarried groups To minimize potential confounding variables between the married and unmarried groups, including factors such as age, year of diagnosis, race, histology, first primary malignancy, radiotherapy, and surgery, we implemented a 1 : 1 PSM approach.

Discussion In this study, we aimed to elucidate the impact of marital status on the survival outcomes of women with primary vaginal cancer. Our analyses revealed that marital status indeed emerged as an independent prognostic indicator for both OS and CSS after conducting univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Subgroup analyses stratified by age and race indicated a positive effect of marriage on survival, particularly among patients aged 50–69 and those white people. Nevertheless, baseline comparisons between married and unmarried cohorts highlighted disparities in age, race, year of diagnosis, pathology type, radiotherapy, and surgery, underscoring the need for careful confounder control ( Rudolph and Stuart, 2018 The findings of this research are expected to enhance our comprehension of the prognostic determinants of primary vaginal cancer and to inform the development of more tailored care and support strategies for patients across varying marital statuses in clinical settings ( Yao et al Previous studies have shown that beyond the biological determinants, psychosocial factors, including marital status, significantly influence patients’ coping strategies and prognoses. Marital status, a key psychosocial element, can enhance emotional resilience, financial stability, and informed medical decision-making, thereby affecting treatment efficacy and survival ( Liu et al Sklar and Anisman, 1979 Moreno-Smith et al Goldzweig et al 2010 Surman and Janik, 2017 Reyes Ortiz et al Sephton et al McEwen, 2007 Antoni et al Sood et al Garssen and Goodkin, 1999 Reiche et al Aizer et al Wu et al Currently, many scholars have utilized the SEER database in conjunction with PSM methods to investigate the impact of marital status on survival among gynecologic cancer patients. Previous studies on the beneficial effects of marital status on survival among patients with breast cancer ( Liu et al Wang et al Chen et al., 2024b van Scheppingen and Leopold, 2020 Kapelle, 2022 Taha et al Howard et al Chen et al., 2024a Beyond marital status, several other factors, including age, year of diagnosis, histology, primary malignancy status, radiotherapy, and surgery, have been identified as independent prognostic determinants in vaginal cancer patients. Younger patients, with better physiological reserves, may exhibit improved treatment responses and outcomes. In contrast, older individuals may contend with comorbidities and reduced general health, translating to poorer prognoses ( Wei et al Pan et al Zheng et al Lian et al Despite these insights, our study has several limitations. Due to the limitations of the SEER database, variables related to psychosocial factors were limited, preventing a more detailed assessment of the quality of patients’ marriages, socioeconomic status, and health insurance, all of which may influence patient survival. Additionally, the SEER database only records the patient’s marital status at the time of diagnosis, not dynamic, so changes in marital status as the tumor progresses may affect the impact of different marital status on survival outcomes ( Qing et al Liu et al Conclusion In conclusion, our study reveals a positive association between married status and survival outcomes in patients with primary vaginal cancer, which suggest that unmarried people need more individualized care strategies. Future studies should delve into the psychosocial mechanisms by which marital status affects cancer survival as well as the impact of other psychosocial factors on cancer survival, and consider prospective study designs to overcome the limitations inherent in the current study.
