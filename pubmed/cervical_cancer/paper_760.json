Introduction Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a destructive and progressive interstitial lung disease that ultimately leads to respiratory failure [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved intracellular degradation process whereby impaired organelles or proteins are removed, maintaining cellular homeostasis [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 In the pathogenesis of IPF, external injury causes damaged and activated cells to release damage-associated molecular patterns that are recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLRs), a group of highly conserved pattern recognition receptors [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Autophagy can be regulated by multiple signaling pathways and effectors [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 Recently, we synthesized the MyD88 inhibitor, TJ-M2010-5 (abbreviated as TJ-5), an aminothiazole derivative, and inhibited MyD88 homodimerization. This result was shown in Figure 1 35 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Reagents TJ-5, known as 3-(4-(4-benzylpiperazin-1-yl)-N-(4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)) propanamide, a targeted inhibitor of MyD88 dimerization, was synthesized at the Academy of Pharmacy, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China (WIPO Patent Application Number: PCT/CN2012/070811). It was dissolved in distilled deionized water (ddH 2 Figure 1 35 2.2. Animals and Animal Treatment Wild-type C57BL/6J mice (male, 8–10 weeks old) were purchased from Weitonglihua Company (Beijing, China). Mice were raised under standard controlled conditions (21 ± 2 °C, 55 ± 10% humidity, and 12 h light/dark cycle) and in a specific pathogen-free environment. Mice were allowed free access to food and water. They were acclimatized to the environment for at least 7 days before the experiments were performed. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Tongji Hospital (ethical approval number: TJH-201901008). For the BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis model, mice were randomly assigned to three groups: the normal saline (NS) group, the BLM group, and the BLM + TJ-5 group. A total of 54 mice were used, with 6 mice in each group. After 8 h of overnight fasting, mice were anesthetized briefly using intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital, and pulmonary fibrosis was induced with a single dose of BLM (2 mg/kg, dissolving in sterile saline) via intratracheal instillation on day 0. The mice in the NS group received equal volumes of sterile saline. Mice in the TJ-5 group were subjected to intraperitoneal injections of TJ-5 (30 mg/kg) once daily, while mice in the NS group and BLM group were injected with an equal volume of ddH 2 35 For the BLM-induced acute lung injury model, the groupings of mice and modeling methods were the same as those used for the BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis model, with 5 mice in each group. Samples were harvested after 3 days and 7 days of treatment with TJ-5. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia at the end of the experiment. 2.3. Histology and Immunohistochemistry The left lobe of the mouse lung was fixed with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h and embedded in paraffin. Then, 4 μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome. The histologic sections were examined and photographed using light microscopy. Lung injury scores were evaluated using a previously described method [ 36 37 38 2.4. Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid Collection and the Number of Leukocytes in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid The mice were anesthetized on days 3 and 7 after BLM stimulation, and a 22-gauge catheter was inserted into the trachea. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected using 1 mL sterile saline through catheter washing three times. Approximately 1.8 mL of BALF was recovered from each mouse and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was prepared for cell counting, and the supernatant was prepared to measure the protein concentration. Cells were resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum, and the total number of cells was counted using a hemocytometer. Then, differential leukocytes were counted on cytospin slides stained with Diff-Quick. 2.5. Measurements of Contents of Hydroxyproline and Activity of Superoxide Dismutase in Lung Tissues At 21 days after BLM treatment, lung tissues were removed. Hydroxyproline (HYP) contents and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in the lung tissue homogenate were measured using HYP kits (BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA) and MPO kits (Jiancheng Biotech, Nanjing, China) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturers. 2.6. ELISA Assay The concentrations of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and TGF-β1 in BALF and lung homogenate were measured using a corresponding ELISA kit (Dakewe, Shenzhen, China) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. 2.7. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and reverse-transcribed to cDNA with an RNA simple Total RNA Kit (Takara). A real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed using Hieff TM ® Supplementary Table S1 2.8. Cell Culture and Drug Interventions Human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells were purchased from the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China) and used, ranging from passage 27 to 37. Cells were cultured in Eagle’s minimal essential medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% non-essential amino acids (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% Gluta-max (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1% sodium pyruvate (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were kept at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 2.9. Cell Immunofluorescence MRC-5 cells were cultured on 12-well chamber slides and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde after the intervention. Then, they were stained with anti-LC3B (A19665; ABclonal) monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the slides were incubated with goat anti-rabbit FITC-conjugated antibody in the dark for 1 h at 37 °C and counterstained with DAPI for 10 min at 20 °C. Then, the slides were visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). 2.10. Proliferation, Apoptosis, and Cytotoxicity Assays Cell proliferation was measured using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Kannaimachi, Japan). MRC-5 cells were seeded at 1 × 10 4 2.11. Western Blotting The total protein was extracted from lung tissues and cultured cells (MRC-5 cells), respectively, according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Beyotime Biotechnology). The same batch of protein samples was electrophoresed on different SDS-PAGE gels at the same time, respectively. After separation on SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred onto the PVDF membrane, and the PVDF membrane was cut according to the molecular weight of the target protein. Immediately after, the proteins were blocked with 5% nonfat milk for 2 h at 20 °C. Then, proteins were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were washed with 1×TBST four times and incubated with HRP-Goat anti-rabbit/mouse secondary antibodies (ABclonal) for 2 h at 20 °C. Thereafter, the membranes were washed four times and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Beyotime Biotechnology). The primary antibodies used included: α-SMA (#19245, CST), FN (sc-8422, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), COL1A1 (#84336, CST), MyD88 (#4283, CST), TLR2 (#13744, CST), TLR4 (ab13867, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), TLR9 (A14642, ABclonal), TGF-β1 (21898-1-AP, Proteintech, Wuhan, China), p-Smad2/3 (#8828, CST), Smad2/3 (#8685, CST), p-p38 (#4511, CST), p38 (#8690, CST), p-ERK (#4376, CST), ERK (#4695, CST), p-JNK (#4668, CST), JNK (#9252, CST), LC3B (A19665, ABclonal), SQSTM1/p62 (A19700, ABclonal), Beclin-1 (A7353, ABclonal), p-mTOR (AP0115, ABclonal), mTOR (A2445, ABclonal), p-PI3K (ab182651, Abcam), PI3K (#4292, CST), p-AKT (#4060, CST), AKT (#9272, CST), and GAPDH (ab37168, Abcam). 2.12. Transmission Electron Microscopy Lung tissues were collected on day 21 after BLM stimulation, immediately fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C, and post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide for 1.5 h at 20 °C. Then, transmission electron microscopy samples were embedded in 1 × 1 × 1 mm lung tissue blocks, and ultra-thin sections (80–100 nm) were cut from the lung tissue. The ultra-thin sections were observed by transmission electron microscopy at 80 kV after staining with uranyl acetate/lead citrate. 2.13. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 6.02) software. All data are presented as means ± SEM from at least three independent experiments. Paired comparisons were assessed using Student’s t p 3. Results 3.1. MyD88 Expression Was Markedly Upregulated in Fibrotic Lungs of BLM-Induced Mice and TGF-β1-Stimulated Fibroblasts Lung tissues were obtained at 3, 7, and 21 days after the BLM challenge. The MyD88 mRNA level was dramatically increased after the BLM injection ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 3.2. TJ-5 Ameliorated BLM-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis and Reduced the Expression of Fibrosis Markers Mice were euthanized 21 days after BLM injection, and the effects of TJ-5 were examined in lung tissues. As indicated in Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 ECM proteins, like α-SMA, FN, and COL1A1, are important fibrotic markers during the fibrotic progression of pulmonary fibrosis [ 39 Figure 2 Figure 2 Additionally, the TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling pathway is also a major profibrotic factor. As shown in Figure 2 Figure 2 These data suggested that TJ-5 could effectively inhibit ECM protein expression and activate TGF-β1/Smad2/3 signaling. 3.3. TJ-5 Attenuated BLM-Induced Pulmonary Inflammation BLM exposure used to induce IPF in mice could increase tissue-infiltrating proinflammatory cells, cytokines, and chemokines, leading to fibrosis [ 40 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 3.4. TJ-5 Suppressed TGF-β1-Induced ECM Deposition in Lung Fibroblasts and Inhibited Their Proliferation Activated fibroblasts producing ECM proteins and the aggregation of fibroblasts represent key steps in pulmonary fibrosis [ 41 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure S2 3.5. TJ-5 Induced Autophagy in Fibrotic Lungs of BLM-Stimulated Mice and TGF-β1-Induced Fibroblasts Autophagy can degrade aberrant proteins and is vital in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis [ 42 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 3.6. Inhibition of Autophagy Reversed the Protective Effects of TJ-5 To further verify that TJ-5 could reduce fibrosis by inducing autophagy, mice were treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. As shown in Figure 6 Figure 6 Moreover, 3-MA was applied to MRC-5 cells in vitro. We found that 3-MA effectively reversed the inhibitory effect of TJ-5 on proliferation in TGF-β1-stimulated MRC-5 cells ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 3.7. Therapeutic Intervention with TJ-5 Ameliorated BLM-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis and Inhibited Lung Fibroblast Activation In addition to prophylactic intervention, we tried to start dosing from D7 and tested key indicators. As indicated in Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 As shown in Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 3.8. TJ-5 Triggered Autophagy Possibly by Suppressing PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/mTOR Pathways mTOR is a major negative regulator of autophagy [ 43 Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 Recent studies have shown that the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways can regulate autophagy by affecting mTOR activity [ 30 44 Figure 9 Figure 9 4. Discussion Our results demonstrated for the first time that TJ-5 displayed a strong protective role toward BLM-stimulated pulmonary fibrosis in mice and activation of lung fibroblasts. Moreover, inhibition of MyD88 with TJ-5 induced autophagy, and inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA reversed the anti-fibrotic effect of TJ-5. Furthermore, we identified that TJ-5 may induce autophagy through suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/mTOR pathways. Collectively, our research suggests that pharmacologic targeting of MyD88 may provide a novel anti-fibrosis method, and TJ-5 may be a promising candidate for clinical treatment of IPF. The importance of autophagy in pulmonary fibrosis was recently recognized. Several studies in IPF patients and BLM-challenged mice suggested that autophagy impairment contributes to the fibrosis response [ 45 46 47 48 26 49 50 Moreover, our results indicated that TJ-5 could induce apoptosis only at high concentrations (30 μmol/L). It was indeed reported that aberrant AKT activation promotes apoptosis resistance in senescent fibroblasts in IPF, and inhibition of AKT phosphorylation can induce apoptosis [ 51 Figure 4 Figure 5 Studies have confirmed that TLR4/MyD88 can affect autophagy activity by regulating mTOR in intestinal inflammation [ 23 30 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 It is worth noting that humans lacking functional MyD88 proteins are susceptible to a narrow range of pathogens, and only in infancy and early childhood. MyD88-dependent signaling appears to be dispensable for survival after adolescence [ 59 60 61 62 Furthermore, our previous studies have found that TJ-5 ameliorated renal interstitial fibrosis induced by ischemia–reperfusion injury by suppressing TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition [ 63 64 2 Figure S1A Figure S1B 65 Of course, this study has limitations. Toxicity assessment was limited to short-term studies of major organs, whereas comprehensive chronic toxicity studies are needed for a potential drug, including effects on the gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, and hematopoiesis. The limitation of the BLM-induced mouse model is that it does not copy the characteristics of slow progress and irreversibility of human IPF. Although it can simulate the pathological characteristics of human IPF to a certain extent, it does not fully recapitulate the pathology of IPF in humans due to the differences among species [ 66 5. Conclusions In summary, the results of studies indicate that TJ-5 exerts a powerful protective effect on BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. This protection appears to be associated with the activation of autophagy induced by MyD88 inhibition. Further study reveals that TJ-5 may trigger autophagy by suppressing PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK/mTOR signaling pathways. These findings provide a strong basis for the future clinical applications of TJ-5 for IPF.
