Objective: This study examines the association between Human Papillomavirus (HPV) awareness and internet use, social media use, and trust in health information from religious leaders. Methods: We analyzed national data, collected March–November 2022 in the U.S. The final sample included 3444 adults ages 18–65 years. The outcome was HPV awareness (being aware of both HPV and the HPV vaccine). Weighted chi square and multivariable logistics regression were used to assess the outcome and each predictor, including internet and social media use, trust in health information from religious leaders, and demographic factors. Results: Among respondents, 62.3 % were aware of HPV. Those who used the internet had higher odds of HPV awareness (aOR = 2.31, 95 %CI = 1.58,3.39), whereas those reporting perceived online health information from social media as accurate had lower odds of HPV awareness (aOR = 0.40, 95 %CI = 0.16,0.98). Social media use and trust in health information from religious leaders were not significantly associated with HPV awareness. Conclusion: Internet use, but not social media use or trust in health information from religious leaders, may improve HPV awareness. This highlights the need for interventions to guide individuals find reliable sources online and for future research to assess accuracy of online HPV information to facilitate vaccination decisions. Highlights • About 62.3 % were aware of human papillomavirus. • Internet users had higher odds of human papillomavirus awareness. • Social media use was not associated with human papillomavirus awareness. • Trust in religious leaders was not associated with human papillomavirus awareness.

In today's digital age, online media is a major source of health information ( Wang and Cohen, 2022 Powell et al., 2011 Viskupič et al., 2025 2 Methods 2.1 Procedures and participants This secondary data analysis study used the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a national survey conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the dataset was publicly available ( National Cancer Institute, 2023 National Cancer Institute, 2023 A total of 6252 responses were collected in the final dataset for HINTS 6, with an overall response rate of 28.1 %. For our study, only participants ages 18–65 years old were included. Ineligible participants due to age ( n n 2.2 Variables and measures We created the awareness variable based on two questions assessing awareness of HPV “ Have you ever heard of HPV? HPV stands for Human Papillomavirus. It is not HIV, HSV, or herpes A vaccine to prevent HPV infection is available and is called the HPV shot, cervical cancer vaccine, or GARDASIL®. Before today, have you ever heard of the cervical cancer vaccine or HPV shot? Yes No aware Yes unaware Our main predictor variables were internet use, social media use, and trust in health information from religious leaders. Other covariates included age, race/ethnicity, sex assigned at birth, marital status, education level, household income, rurality, and perceived inaccuracy of social media health information . Do you ever go on-line to access the Internet or World Wide Web, or to send and receive e-mail? Yes No. In the last 12 months, how often did you visit a social media site? Almost every day,” “At least once a week,” “A few times a month,” “Less than once a month, Never. In general, how much would you trust information about cancer from religious organizations and leaders? A lot”, “Some”, “A little”, “Not at all” Yes No not at all Age was categorized into three groups, 18–26, 27–45, and 46–65 years old. The age range of up to 26 years aligns with the catch-up HPV vaccination period for adults ( Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023 U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2020 National Cancer Institute. Cervical Cancer Screening, 2025. How much of the health information that you see on social media do you think is false or misleading?” “A lot”, “Some”, “A little”, “None”, and “I do not use social media”. 2.3 Data analysis To account for sampling variability in population estimates, replicate weights were applied using the jackknife replication method. We performed chi-square tests to summarize the sample characteristics based on total sample and HPV awareness groups (aware/unaware) by reporting the weighted percentage in each sub-category and its corresponding p p 3 Results The total sample included 3444 adults. In the weighted sample, the majority (44.1 %) were between 46 and 65 years old, 62.3 % were aware of HPV, while 37.7 % were not. Most participants were non-Hispanic White (58.5 %), assigned male at birth (50.5 %), and married (55.4 %). The majority also reported using the internet (91.6 %), using social media almost daily (67.3 %), and trusting cancer information delivered by religious leaders (58.0 %). In bivariate analyses, almost all the variables were significantly associated with HPV awareness, with the exception of rurality ( p p Table 1 Table 1 Descriptive Statistics based on Human Papillomavirus Awareness of 18–65 Years Old Respondents from The Health Information National Trends Survey 6 data, collected March–November 2022 in the United States.

We found that individuals who used the internet had significantly higher odds of HPV awareness. We also observed that social media use and trust in cancer information from religious leaders were not significantly associated with HPV awareness in the adjusted model. HPV awareness is critical, as parental awareness is closely linked to HPV vaccine uptake among adolescents ( Aragaw et al., 2023 US Preventive Services Task Force et al., 2018 One notable finding of our study is the significant association between internet use and higher HPV awareness. In our sample, approximately 91.6 % of participants reported using the internet. With internet widespread usage, seeking health information online has become increasingly common. Prior research reported that electronic sources, including information accessed through the internet, have become the most common sources of HPV knowledge in some communities rather than information provided by physicians ( Adjei Boakye et al., 2017 British Medical Journal, 2000 Battineni et al., 2020 Lapidus and Dryankova-Bond, 2014 Tan and Goonawardene, 2017 Our results indicated that people who used social media were more aware of HPV, but this association was no longer significant in the multivariable regression model while controlling for other covariates. This shift in significance suggests that other variables included in the regression model altered this association, which is consistent with other research. Previous literature found that women (compared to men), urban (compared to rural) residents, and Non-Hispanic White participants were more likely to use online media as source of health-related and medical information ( Wang and Cohen, 2022 Chen et al., 2019 Hou and Shim, 2010 We explored the role of perceived inaccuracy of health information on social media and HPV awareness. Our findings suggested that those who perceived social media health information as accurate tended to have lower HPV awareness. When individuals rely on social media as their primary source for health information, the brief nature and potential for information that is not fact-checked can lead to erroneous beliefs ( Keim-Malpass et al., 2017 Llavona-Ortiz et al., 2022 Trust in cancer information from religious leaders was not associated with HPV awareness in either bivariate or multivariable regression analyses. This was contrary to what has been found in other research examining religious leaders as trusted messengers for health information. However, the recent studies have mostly examined vaccines in general or the COVID-19 vaccine ( Viskupič et al., 2025 Meyer et al., 2022 Despite these important insights, our study has several limitations. First, the use of secondary data means that we did not develop the specific questions we used about HPV awareness or the trust in health information delivered by religious leaders, limiting the clarity of association we were examining. Relatedly, given the small numbers of people in some of our analytic groups (e.g. those who did not use the internet, those who perceive social media information as accurate, etc.) it is possible these factors might be explained by unmeasured confounding factors and results should be interpreted with caution. The online/social media use may not always correspond to online exposure to HPV-related content, constraining the context of the observed associations. The HINTS 6 survey did not provide a variable measuring HPV vaccine uptake, preventing us from analyzing this health outcome which may have provided a clearer picture of the associations of interest. Furthermore, because HINTS data is observational and not an experiment, we cannot draw causal conclusions from the associations observed. Additionally, due to the self-reported nature of the study, participant responses are subject to recall and social desirability biases, and they may not have accurately reported their HPV awareness. Furthermore, this voluntary survey may have been subject to selection bias as certain groups, such as those from minority religious affiliations, might be underrepresented. However, the weighting procedures and statistical analyses were intended to limit the effect of this bias. Finally, part of our sample falls outside the recommended age for HPV vaccination, which may limit direct implications for increasing vaccine uptake. Despite these limitations, this study contributed to body of research work to understand association between HPV awareness and online media use and trust in heath information from religious leaders. 5 Conclusion This study provides valuable insights into the potential factors associated with HPV awareness, particularly the role of internet and social media use, as well as information trust from religious leaders. Our findings indicated that internet users tend to have higher HPV awareness, while social media use and trust in health information from religious leaders were not significantly associated with HPV awareness. Based on these results, public health interventions could focus on guiding individuals to find trusted sources of health information online. Given that trust in health information from religious leaders was not found to be significant, it may be more effective to situate these interventions outside of religious settings. There are needs for future studies with a primary data collection to assess predictor variables of HPV awareness to ensure accuracy and reliability of the responses. Furthermore, additional variables to examine accuracy of HPV awareness should also be assessed to better understand the complex relationships between HPV awareness and internet use, social media, and trust in health information from religious leaders.
