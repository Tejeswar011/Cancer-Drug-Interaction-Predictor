Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), which occurs because the vaginal and urethral epithelial layers contain a high density of estrogen receptors, is one of the most common clinical manifestations. These problems can be chronic and progressive, consequently affecting menopausal women’s sexual and quality of life. Therefore, innovation in novel therapeutic modalities or improvements to current therapies is necessary. Aim: This study aimed to provide a comprehensive and precise protocol guide for ovariectomy and vaginectomy to establish a suitable animal model for GSM cases. Method: Forty Wistar Rattus norvegicus Results: The study recommends the double dorsolateral incision technique as the most effective method for ovariectomy. Vaginectomy is essential for the objective evaluation of the vaginal and urethral epithelium in GSM and for the histological assessment of therapeutic response. Conclusion: The therapeutic modalities that result from a suitable animal model protocol are expected to guarantee safety and efficacy.

Female rat urogenital system anatomy ( Suckow et al Rabbits, rats, mice, guinea pigs, dogs, fish, and non-human primates are all acceptable for use in preclinical studies. Nevertheless, rats ( Rattus norvegicus Mus musculus Nascimento-Gonçalves et al Wistar Medina-Contreras et al Yousefzadeh et al Furthermore, vaginal and urethral tissue samples must be objectively analyzed for the histopathological alterations and therapeutic response in rats with GSM ( Ho et al Materials and Methods This study used 40 female Wistar R. norvegicus, Soewondo et al Ethical approval The research protocol was approved by the research ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Sebelas Maret University, under the number 207/UN27.06.11/KEP/EC/2024. Results Urogenital system anatomy in female rats In female rats, the ovaries are located within the adipose tissue at the posterolateral pole of the kidneys and connected by the mesovarium to the abdominal cavity’s posterior wall. In mature ovaries, they form as a mass of follicles. The open end of the oviduct attaches to the ovary, while the distal end connects to the uterus. Despite the visible fusion of the uterine horns at the distal end, two different uterine ossa exist that lead into the vagina. Each uterus has an internum and an eksternum ostium and a cervical canal. The bladder empties into the urethra, which opens into the perineum at the base of the clitoris through the urethral orifice. The vaginal orifice is on the dorsal aspect of the urethra ( Suckow et al Herrera-Pérez et al Ovariectomy techniques There are three ovariectomies techniques ( Rejeki et al Yousefzadeh et al Herrera-Pérez et al Double dorsolateral incision ovariectomy Single midline dorsal incision ovariectomy Ventral or transverse incision ovariectomy A. Pre-operative Stage  The rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine-xylazine at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight. The rat’s fur is shaved with a razor, specifically in the dorsum area’s midline, the dorsolateral areas on both sides, or the ventral abdomen. Disinfection was performed with 70% alcohol followed by povidone iodine. B. Double dorsolateral incision ovariectomy  An incision was made along the midline, approximately 1.5 cm from the right dorsolateral aspect, to access the dorsal muscle and peritoneal cavity. The skin and muscle were carefully separated using a cotton bud and blunt surgical instruments. The ovaries can be identified by examining the fat pad underneath the pelvic muscle of the rat. A small incision of approximately 0.5 cm is made on the fat pad. The fat pad was clamped with forceps, then removed and placed on a saline-soaked wet gauze. The ovary and fat pad on the uterine horn are carefully separated using two fine forceps, and any bleeding is then checked. The end of the oviduct and the fat pad are ligated, approximately 3 mm from the ovary. The ovary is cut and appears granular, similar to grapes. The ovarian horn was returned into the abdominal cavity using sterile gauze. A local anesthetic is administered into the muscle at the incision site, then both ends of the muscle are clamped with two forceps, and a knot is made to close it using absorbable sutures. A single drop of topical anesthetic is applied to the incised skin before suturing with non-absorbable sutures. The suture area is disinfected with iodine-containing povidone. The procedure can be repeated on the left ovary. Fig. 2.

C. Single midline dorsal incision ovariectomy  An incision is made along the midline, approximately 1 cm in the mid-dorsal region and at the base of the tail. The skin and muscle were carefully separated using a cotton bud and blunt surgical instruments. The ovaries can be identified by examining the fat pad underneath the pelvic muscle of the rat. Blood vessels must be ligated first to prevent bleeding. A small incision of approximately 0.5 cm is made on the fat pad. The ovary and fat pad on the uterine horn are carefully separated using two fine forceps, and any bleeding is then checked. The end of the oviduct and fat pad are ligated, approximately 3 mm from the ovary. The ovary is cut and appears granular, similar to grapes. The ovarian horn was returned into the abdominal cavity using sterile gauze. The procedure is repeated on the other ovary without creating additional incisions. A local anesthetic is administered into the muscle at the incision site, then both ends of the muscle are clamped with two forceps, and a knot is made to close it using absorbable sutures. A single drop of topical anesthetic is applied to the incised skin before suturing with non-absorbable sutures. The suture area is disinfected with iodine-containing povidone. Fig. 4. Single midline dorsal incision ovariectomy (A) incision along the midline in the mid-dorsum area; (B) visualizing and removing the fat pad and ovaries using the previous method without creating additional incisions. D. Ventral or transverse incision ovariectomy  A transverse incision is made in the center of the abdomen, slightly to the right, about 0.4–0.6 cm. Dissect the muscle until the peritoneal cavity and the fat pad wrapping the ovary are exposed. The fat pad and ovaries were carefully removed from the incision site. Ligation is performed using absorbable sutures at the distal end of the uterine horn, then the ovary is cut, and bleeding is controlled. The procedure is repeated on the other ovary without creating additional incisions. A local anesthetic is administered into the muscle at the incision site, then both ends of the muscle are clamped with two forceps, and a knot is made to close it using absorbable sutures. A single drop of topical anesthetic is applied to the incised skin before suturing with non-absorbable sutures. The suture area is disinfected with iodine-containing povidone. Fig. 5. Transverse incision slightly to the right in the central abdomen, followed by alternating ovaries removal using the same incision site as before. Fig. 6. Rat’s ovary. E. Post-operative Stage  After surgery, the rats were placed in individual boxes to prevent contamination and exposed stitches. Two drops of antibiotics and topical anesthetics were applied to the suturing area for 3 days. The rats were provided with adequate food and water according to the standards, along with room temperature regulation and alternating dark-light lighting every 12 hour. Technique for collecting vaginal and urethral tissue ( Ho et al Koebele et al Soewondo et al At the conclusion of the study, the rats were euthanized using ketamine-xylazine at five times the anesthetic dose. The surgical field was sterilized, and the rat was incised along the midline ventral abdomen through skin and muscle. The remaining genitourinary tissues, including the oviduct, uterus, vagina, bladder, and urethra, were isolated and removed from the abdominal fat. A transverse incision of approximately 2–3 mm is made in the vagina and urethra, with the vaginal orifice (dorsal aspect) identified using a cotton bud to differentiate it from the urethral orifice. The tissue was preserved in formalin solution, labeled, and delivered to the anatomical pathology laboratory for histological evaluation. Discussion During menopause, estrogen hormone synthesis decreases, leading to various physiological changes that might affect a woman’s quality of life. GSM is one of the most common clinical manifestations. The vaginal and urethral epithelial layers contain numerous estrogen receptors; therefore, a decrease in estrogen hormones results in a variety of symptoms of the genitourinary system. These problems may be chronic and progressive, consequently affecting menopausal women’s sexual and quality of life ( Sarmento et al Vodegel et al Fig. 7. Post-operative stage. Fig. 8. Vaginectomy in rats (A) rat after anesthesia and disinfection; (B) incision on the midline of the ventral abdomen; (C) separation of the genitourinary tissue from the abdomen. Natural menopause (estropause), ovariectomy, and ovotoxins, which can accelerate ovarian failure, are all approaches for inducing menopause in rats. Estropause in rats shares similarities to human menopause, despite only 25% of estrouse rats demonstrating the same hormonal profile, and this procedure takes a long time to apply. Rats induced into menopause with the ovotoxin 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) to accelerate ovarian failure have ovarian and hormonal profiles similar to most menopausal women. However, this method has limitations because VCD is toxic at high doses and requires 15 intraperitoneal injections, increasing concerns about stress on the animals. Consequently, ovariectomy is frequently considered the gold standard procedure due to its numerous advantages over the other two approaches ( Medina-Contreras et al Ovariectomy has numerous advantages, including ease of application, reduced cost, and a quick onset of hypoestrogenism. Furthermore, ovariectomy-induced menopause shows comparable main characteristics to human menopause, including a similar hormonal profile, HPG axis dysregulation, and cognitive and cardiometabolic alterations identical to those observed in menopausal women. Three ovariectomy techniques in rats include the double dorsolateral incision, single midline dorsal incision, and ventral or transverse incision. In our study, ventral incision ovariectomy had a shorter surgical time (<10 minutes), but wound healing took longer (10–15 days), due to the rat’s anatomical position, which causes the incision wound on the abdomen to be pressed and constantly in contact with the bedding, making it more vulnerable to breaking and infection ( Rejeki et al Yousefzadeh et al Herrera-Pérez et al Khajuria et al Yousefzadeh et al Herrera-Pérez et al Yousefzadeh et al Fig. 9. (A) Oviduct; (B) uterus; (C) vagina (dorsal) and urethra (ventral). Subsequently, to find objective evidence of GSM, vaginal and urethral tissues were collected through vaginectomy when the rats reached menopause after day 21 post-ovariectomy, and histological analysis was performed. At the conclusion of the study, tissue collection through vaginectomy is essential to evaluate the response of vaginal and urethral tissues to a treatment intervention ( Rejeki et al Ye et al Conclusion GSM is a condition that significantly impacts the quality of life of menopausal women. Consequently, the development of novel therapeutic modalities or the improvement of current therapies remains essential. Therefore, comprehensive and precise protocols for the development of suitable animal models are required to guarantee the safety and efficacy of the therapeutic modalities.
