Methods We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial at a tertiary hospital to compare the efficacy of petroleum jelly application versus normal saline irrigation in preventing peristomal pressure injuries and promoting tracheostomy wound healing. This study enrolled 28 participants, aged 18–80 years, who underwent tracheostomy procedures at Vajira Hospital, Navamindradhiraj University. They were randomly assigned using a permuted-block randomization methods (block size = 4) to either the petroleum jelly application group or the sodium chloride irrigation (0.9% NaCl solution) group. The outcomes were evaluated by one physician and one nurse at first, second, and fourth weeks postoperatively using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (PUSH) Tool and Skin Integrity Score. Results The petroleum jelly application group demonstrated significantly lower mean scores on the PUSH Tool at first, second, and fourth weeks than the sodium chloride irrigation group. Moreover, the petroleum jelly application group exhibited significantly higher median scores for skin integrity at first, second, and fourth weeks than the sodium chloride irrigation group. The interrater reliability between the two observers was good to excellent. The petroleum-jelly arm showed faster improvement on both scoring tools across all follow-up points. Conclusions The participants who received petroleum jelly application following tracheostomy demonstrated better results in preventing pressure injuries and maintaining skin integrity compared with those who received sodium chloride irrigation.

[ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 10 Pressure injuries [ 11 12 13 12 13 4 This study aimed to compare the efficacy of petroleum jelly application and sodium chloride irrigation in preventing pressure injuries and promoting tracheostomy wound healing, with the ultimate goal of improving patients’ quality of life and accelerating hospital discharge, thereby leading to shorter hospital stays. Materials and methods Study design, setting and ethics A prospective randomized controlled trial, approved by the Research Ethics Review Committee (IRB no: 163/64FB), included 28 participants aged 18–80 years who underwent tracheostomy procedures at Vajira Hospital, Navamindradhiraj University, between November 2021 and December 2022. Clinical trial number: TCTR20240806002 (Thai Clinical Trials Registry), registered on August 6, 2024. Retrospectively registered. Participants and sample-size calculation The inclusion criteria were: adults aged 18–80 years, undergoing elective tracheostomy at Vajira Hospital, receiving a synthetic tracheostomy tube made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and able to provide informed consent and comply with follow-up care. All tracheostomies were performed using a standardized surgical technique, (open surgical technique with horizontal incision and blunt dissection) and this standardized technique was an explicit inclusion criterion. All participants received identical size 7 PVC tracheostomy tubes. Although cuff pressures were not protocolized, they were uniformly maintained within standard clinical practice (~ 20–30 cm H₂O). Level of consciousness and patient mobility status were not explicitly recorded. The exclusion criteria were: patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, those who underwent tracheostomy procedures outside the operating room, and those with other surgical wounds or cervical lymphadenopathy that could confound skin assessment. Patients who underwent a tracheostomy using techniques other than the standardized open surgical method described were excluded. The discontinuation criteria included death or the inability to care for the tracheostomy wound by dressing alone, such as requiring surgical debridement. The required sample was estimated with G*Power v3.1.9.7 [ 14 t 7 d . . Randomization and blinding Participants were randomized using permuted-block randomization (block size = 4) into either the petroleum jelly group or the saline (0.9% NaCl) group to compare their efficacy in preventing pressure injuries and promoting tracheostomy wound healing. The random allocation sequence was generated by a statistician independent of the trial and was concealed using sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered envelopes. These envelopes were opened by the otolaryngology resident only after the participant's enrollment and baseline assessment, ensuring that the allocation remained concealed until the intervention was assigned. Caregivers and participants were aware of group allocation; however, both independent outcome observers remained blinded throughout data collection and analysis. Interventions Wound care began on postoperative day 1 (the morning after the tracheostomy). In both groups the site was cleansed once daily with 10 mL sterile 0.9% saline. In the saline group, the cleansed area was covered with sterile gauze. In the petroleum-jelly group, cleansing was followed by the application of 0.5 g petrolatum measured precisely on a sterile, pre-weighed cotton-tip applicator to ensure consistency, circumferentially to the peristomal skin, after which the same gauze dressing was applied. Dressings were replaced every 24 h or sooner if wet or dislodged by trained otolaryngology residents or nurses, with caregivers continuing the identical regimen at home. Outcome measures and follow-up The outcomes were assessed by one physician and one nurse at first, second, and fourth weeks postoperatively using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing [ 15 16 7 1 2 2 Fig. 1 Petroleum jelly application Fig. 2 The CONSORT flow diagram of the study population Inter-rater reliability was excellent, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranging from 0.85 to 0.97 across all tools and time-points. The PUSH Tool yields a total score ranging from 0 (best) to 17 (worst), with higher scores indicating worse wound status and lower scores indicating better healing. The Skin Integrity Score ranges from 0 (worst) to 8 (best), with higher scores reflecting better peristomal skin integrity. Statistical analysis Continuous variables were first examined for normality with the Shapiro–Wilk test [ 17 p p p Results General characteristics The 28 patients who underwent tracheostomy procedures were randomly assigned to two groups. Fourteen patients used petroleum jelly for dressing their wounds, whereas the other 14 patients used sodium chloride irrigation (0.9% NaCl solution) for dressing their wounds. The study found no differences in basic demographic information. In the petroleum jelly application group, seven were female patients and seven were male patients, with an average age of 65.07 ± 8.38 years. In the sodium chloride irrigation group, four were female patients and 10 were male patients, with an average age of 66.29 ± 12.94 years. No significant differences in other demographic characteristics were observed between the two groups, including height, weight, body mass index, hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum albumin, serum creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, diabetes mellitus, smoking history, and history of infection, including sepsis, pneumonia, and other infections.

In Thailand, accessing moisture-retentive dressings, such as Mepilex Ag, [ 8 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 9 10 Furthermore, petroleum jelly is easy to use, cost-effective, and does not absorb into the bloodstream, making it suitable for most skin types. Its nonirritating nature and wide availability make it a practical alternative to expensive wound dressings in resource-limited settings [ 25 26 10 26 27 The population included in this study primarily comprised males aged between 18 and 80 years who underwent tracheostomy procedures. According to the study findings, petroleum jelly was effective in preventing pressure injuries and promoting wound healing, as assessed by the PUSH [ 15 16 7 Each participant underwent a medical history review and physical examination, which was conducted by a single physician (the researcher). This approach was employed to minimize potential discrepancies that could arise from multiple examiners. The purpose of these procedures was to accurately classify the target groups and to explain the utilization of tools, wound care procedures, and data collection methods. From this study, it was observed that the use of petroleum jelly was effective in preventing pressure injuries and facilitating wound healing in patients undergoing tracheostomy procedures. The results are consistent with those of Meng Yue et al., [ 22 The limitations of this study include its small sample size, which may not fully reflect the diversity of the population undergoing tracheostomy procedures. Furthermore, having only two evaluators could introduce potential biases in the assessments because different evaluators may have varying perspectives and interpretations. Moreover, the study only experimented with one type of petroleum jelly, particularly the product from the hospital’s production. This limitation restricts the generalizability of the findings to other types of petroleum jelly products available in the market. Additionally, while our study included patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes mellitus, it was not powered to assess subgroup differences based on comorbidities. Finally, because all PUSH domains were scored from standardized photographs rather than direct observation of the removed dressing, very light serous drainage or exceedingly heavy exudate may have been under- or over-estimated, respectively, introducing a potential measurement error. The small sample size and single-center design may limit the broader applicability of these results to diverse clinical populations. Additionally, we did not explicitly record certain patient characteristics such as level of consciousness (GCS or sedation state) and mobility status, which could potentially influence wound healing outcomes. To address these limitations and further develop the research, the researchers suggest increasing the sample size to enhance the representativeness of the findings. Expanding the number of evaluators, including both physicians and nurses, can provide a more comprehensive assessment and reduce potential biases. Furthermore, future studies could explore the efficacy of different materials and compare them with petroleum jelly to determine the most effective option for preventing pressure injuries and facilitating wound healing in patients undergoing tracheostomy. Conclusion Participants who received petroleum jelly application following tracheostomy exhibited significantly better outcomes in preventing pressure injuries and maintaining peristomal skin integrity compared with those who received standard sodium chloride irrigation alone, suggesting that petroleum jelly should be considered as an adjunct to standard tracheostomy wound care, particularly in resource-limited healthcare settings.
