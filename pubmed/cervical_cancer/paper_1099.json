Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA), recognized as the most common type of arthritis, is a comprehensive joint condition that results in significant pain and functional impairments, leading to notable morbidity [ 1 2 3 5 6 7 Despite the loss of articular cartilage being the hallmark characteristic of OA, the mechanisms underlying this OA‐related mechanism remain poorly understood. Synovium refers to a heterogeneous connective tissue exhibiting intrinsic pathologies during OA and aggravating the disease throughout the joint [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 Over the past decades, the rapid development of single‐cell transcriptomics has revolutionized the high‐resolution analysis of cellular composition [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2. Methods 2.1. Data Source In this study, we utilized transcriptomic data in order to screen for key genes and modeling of OA.

Functional Enrichment Analysis The key genes were uploaded to KOBAS‐i database ( http://bioinfo.org/kobas p 27 2.6. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) Analysis The “limma” R package was applied to calculate the difference on the gene expression level in control and OA groups [ 28 29 p 2 p 2.7. Construction of Diagnostic Model The “multipleROC” R package ( https://github.com/WandeRum/multiROC 2.8. Patients Samples Synovial tissues were collected for this study from six individuals, who had total knee replacement surgery due to OA, as well as from six patients suffering from meniscus injuries, who had normal synovial tissues. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the samples were gathered, processed, and analyzed following the ethical guidelines established by the Ethics Committee at Xiangyang Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei University of Chinese Medicine (Ethics Approval No. ZY2023Z016 and 2022BGE240). 2.9. Quantitative Real‐Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT‐PCR) Total RNA from the synovial tissue was purified using Trizol (Servicebio, Wuhan, China), and subsequently converted into complementary DNA (cDNA) through reverse transcription with Prime Script RT Master Mix (Takara, Shiga, Japan). For qRT‐PCR, we employed 2x SYBR Green qPCR Hub Mix (without ROX; Servicebio). The sequences of the primers for the seven essential genes are listed in Table 1 Table 1 Primers applied in quantitative reverse‐transcription PCR.

Statistical Analysis All computational analysis was realized in R software (version 3.6.3, Irving Medical Center, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA). Experimental data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 8.0.2, GraphPad, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). The data were deemed to be statistically significant when the p 3. Results 3.1. Single‐Cell Landscape in OA The single‐cell landscape in OA was depicted first to determine the cell population for our current research. Following the filtering, standardization, removal of batch effects, dimensionality reduction, eight main cell populations were identified and annotated based on their marker genes provided by CellMarker2.0 database and shown in brackets (Figure 1 DCN LUM FN1 TIMP1 VWF PECAM1 LYZ C1QB C1QA CXCR4 CCL5 NKG7 PDGFRB RGS5 CD79A CD27 TK1 MKI67 CCNB1 1 GSE216651 1 Figure 1 Single‐cell landscape in OA.

Cell–cell Communication Analysis With the purpose of exploring the potential involvement and effects of fibroblasts in OA, cell–cell communication analysis was initiated to determine the ligand–receptor pairs via which fibroblasts communicate with other cell populations. A highest communication probability was seen between mesenchymal cells/T cells and fibroblasts through the pairs of CD99‐CD99 (Figure 2 Figure 2 Bubble plots depicting the potential ligand‐receptor pairs via which fibroblasts and other cell population communicate with each other. 3.3. Identification of Fibroblasts‐Associated Gene Modules via hdWGCNA Hereafter, we aimed to determine the feature genes in OA‐related fibroblasts, and the hdWGCNA analysis was accordingly carried out. The optimal soft threshold was calculated to be eight and the coexpression network was then established (Figure 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Figure 3 Identification of fibroblasts‐associated gene modules via hdWGCNA.

Functional Enrichment Analysis on Key Genes Then the key genes were uploaded to the KOBAS‐i database to determine the enriched biological processes and functional pathways. The relevant results of GO enrichment analysis have suggested that these key genes were significantly enriched in collagen fibril organization, microfibril, and fibronectin binding (Figure 4A–C 4 Figure 4 Functional enrichment analysis on key genes.

Differential Analysis on Sorting Fibroblasts‐Associated Hub Genes The samples in the dataset were divided into OA and control groups, and the difference in the gene expression level was determined via “Limma” R package.

Construction of the Diagnostic Model Thereafter, in order to determine the diagnostic efficacy of these seven genes in OA, the relevant ROC curves were plotted, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated as well. The AUC of these seven genes was all higher than 0.8, suggesting the satisfying diagnostic efficacy (Figure 6 p 6 6 6 Figure 6 Construction of the diagnostic model.

This nomogram shows a diagnostic model constructed based on seven genes, where the expression level of each variable corresponds to a certain score (Points), and the higher the total score, the higher the probability of predicting OA.

Discussion The genetics of OA has been transformed with the development and application of large‐scale genome‐wide association scans, and some techniques like statistical fine mapping, in silico analyses on genomics data, and laboratory‐based functional studies have contributed to the identification of some targets which can encode proteins with a variety of roles, including extracellular signaling molecules, intracellular enzymes, transcription factors (TFs), and cytoskeletal proteins [ 30 30 31 CCR6 CLEC7A IL18 SRSF2 32 ZBTB16 TNFSF11 SCRG1 KDELR3 In our current study, we utilized multiple bioinformatics techniques to explore the feature biomarkers for OA. The scRNA‐seq data were applied first to reveal the cell population for our research. Based on the relevant data, fibroblasts were identified to be the cell population with the highest percentage in the GEO datasets. Fibroblasts are the mesenchymal cells involved in inflammatory diseases, which make up the stroma within the organ tissue and have been identified in existing scRNA‐seq analysis to be involved in OA [ 33 34 35 Previous studies applying WGCNA in the research of OA have revealed some potential therapeutic biomarkers in diagnosing OA [ 19 20 16 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 Thereafter, with the purpose of exploring the fibroblasts‐associated hub genes for our research, the key genes of hdWGCNA analysis were intersected with the DEGs. A total of seven common genes were obtained, including APOD BGN MXRA5 THY1 C1QTNF3 DPT OGN APOD 43 44 BGN 45 MXRA5 DPT 46 THY1 47 C1QTNF3 48 OGN 49 50 However, it should be noted that some research limitations exist in this study. First, the relatively small sample size of data integrated in this study, especially the single‐cell data derived from the tissues of only three OA patients, may not adequately reflect the overall heterogeneity of the OA patient population. For this reason, we plan to expand the sample size, especially to increase the samples of OA patients and controls from different regions, pathologic subtypes, and stages of disease progression, and to construct a larger validation cohort to improve the robustness and generalizability of the model. In addition, although we verified the expression trend of seven key genes by qRT‐PCR in multiple sample tissues, no protein‐level validation, or functional experiments were performed, which made it difficult to deeply illustrate the mechanism of these genes in OA. We will conduct further studies such as western blot, immunohistochemistry, and fibroblast intervention experiments to validate their functional roles in disease progression in combination with animal models of OA. Finally, this study focused on mining key markers in fibroblasts, and despite the uniqueness of this direction, OA is a complex disease with the involvement of multiple cell types, and focusing on a single cell type alone may limit a comprehensive understanding of its mechanisms. We plan to further analyze immune and structural cell subpopulations, such as macrophages, T cells, and chondrocytes in the synovium in conjunction with single‐cell data to explore their interactions with fibroblasts and to construct molecular network models at the multicellular level. 5. Conclusion All in all, in this study, based on single‐cell transcriptome data with hdWGCNA, we systematically identified key gene modules closely related to fibroblasts and screened seven differentially expressed and highly related core genes ( APOD BGN MXRA5 THY1 C1QTNF3 DPT OGN Nomenclature APOD: Apolipoprotein D AUC: Area under the curve BGN: Biglycan C1QTNF3: C1q and TNF related 3 DEGs: Differentially expressed genes DPT: Dermatopontin ECM: Extracellular matrix FC: Fold change GEO: Gene expression omnibus GO: Gene ontology hdWGCNA: High‐dimensional WGCNA KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes KNN: K‐nearest neighbor MXRA5: Matrix remodeling associated 5 OA: Osteoarthritis OGN: Osteoglycin PCA: Principal component analysis RNA‐seq: RNA sequencing ROC: Receiver operating characteristic scRNA‐seq: Single‐cell RNA sequencing SFs: Synovial fibroblasts TFs: Transcription factors THY1: Thy‐1 cell surface antigen UMAP: Uniform manifold approximation and projection WGCNA: Weighted gene coexpression network analysis.
