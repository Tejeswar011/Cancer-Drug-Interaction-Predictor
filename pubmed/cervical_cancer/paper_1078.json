They have contributed significantly to the creation of modern medications. To supplement existing information, therefore, this current investigation aimed to understand the potential therapeutic properties of the sidr plant against triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) on MCF-7 breast cell line by conducting phytochemical, nutritional, and antimicrobial profile comparisons of different plant parts. Methods Phytochemical analyses involved soluble sugar composition and oxidation profile, whereas nutritional analysis involved the proximate chemical analysis. Additionally, antimicrobial analyses involved six kings of food-borne bacterial strains. Results According to the study, leaves possessed the highest amounts of protein (12.44%) and ash (8.17%), as well as the highest amounts of ascorbic acid and total chlorophyll. On the other hand, pulps exhibited the highest flavonoid concentration in their ethanolic extract and had higher sugar contents. Furthermore, at a dosage of 100 µg/mL, the ethanolic extract of leaves showed potent antimicrobial action and suppressed over 50% of MCF-7 breast cancer cell survival. Conclusions Bioactive components, antioxidant, antimicrobial and nutritional elements of sidr plant appears a promising medicinal candidate to fight breast cancer cells.

Without a thorough comparison across many anatomical components, the majority of earlier research has concentrated on a single plant portion, usually the leaves. The distribution of bioactive compounds in plant tissues, including leaves, pulp, and seeds, varies significantly, and this can have a big impact on pharmacological potential and therapeutic use. Both conventional and contemporary methods of plant extraction are essential for separating bioactive substances for use in food, medicine, and agriculture ( Abdallah, 2017 Salih et al., 2019 Abdallah et al., 2024 The current investigation aimed to highlight the potential therapeutic properties of the sidr plant against TNBC on MCF-7 breast cell line with a comparative study for proximate chemical analysis, mineral profiling, physicochemical analysis, soluble sugar composition, oxidation profile, and antimicrobial assessments. Materials and Methods Schematic overview of the experimental program In order to demonstrate the sidr plant’s potential therapeutic benefits against TNBC on the MCF-7 breast cell line, a comparative analysis of proximate chemical analysis, mineral profiling, physicochemical analysis, soluble sugar composition, oxidation profile, and antimicrobial assessments were conducted. Figure 1 10.7717/peerj.19858/fig-1 Figure 1 The summary of the experimental work for sidr plant. Preparation of plant samples A sterile stainless-steel knife was used to manually separate the fresh fruits into pulps and seeds after they had been carefully washed with tap water. Fruit leaves, pulps, and seeds of Ziziphus spina-christi Hashem & El-Lahot, 2021 Preparation of aqueous and ethanolic extracts The powdered samples were extracted using two different solvents according to the described protocol by Guezzoun et al. (2024) Figure 1 Proximate chemical analysis Moisture, ash, ether, protein, fat, and fiber for leaves, pulps, and seeds were detected according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists ( Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), 1995 N Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), 2000 Mineral profiling Mineral contents were estimated for ash residues according to ( Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), 2019 Physicochemical analysis The total chlorophyll for various sidr parts was detected according to the acetone extraction (80%) after incubation for 15 min in the dark then centrifuging at 2,500 rpm for 3 min and absorption at 645 nm ( Wang et al., 2022 Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), 2007 Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC), 1995 Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) (2007) Soluble sugar composition High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (LC-10AD, Shimadzu, Japan) was used to detect the sugar’s composition. Standards of sucrose, fructose, and glucose were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Approximately 0.5 g of various sidr parts were extracted in five mL of ethanol-water (90:10, V: V), and heated in a water bath for 30 min at 80 °C, then centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were collected and adjusted to 25 mL and filtered by using a membrane size (0.22 µm). An LC-NH2 column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, five µm) with a flow rate (one mL/min) and 10 µL of injection volume were used to separate sugar compositions at 40 °C ( Gao et al., 2012 Oxidation profile Several assays for phytochemicals and antioxidant activities were detected on 500 µL of aqueous and ethanolic extracts. Total phenolics were detected by spectrophotometry by Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (10%) at 25 °C, while results were expressed as gallic acid equivalent (mg GAE/g). Pure water was used as a blank, while samples were evaluated at 765 nm ( Begum et al., 2024 Benabderrahmane et al., 2024 50 Taha et al., 2024 Uguru et al., 2023 Antimicrobial assessments The agar well-diffusion assay was applied to evaluate the antimicrobial assessments of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts ( Ahmed et al., 2022a Ahmed et al., 2022b Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumonia Salmonella typhi Khojah, Abdelhalim OB & Habib, 2022 Sarjito et al., 2021 Anticancer activity of sidr leaf extracts Cell culture The Shanghai Institute of Biological Sciences in China was the source of the human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7). The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 media and 10% DMEM supplemented with 150 units/mL of penicillin-streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were grown in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 Qiao et al., 2020 Cell viability Using a mitochondrial-dependent reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test (Sigma-Aldrich), mitochondrial respiration—a measure of cell viability—was ascertained. The MCF-7 cells were then subjected to various concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL) against the cells treated with the vehicle (equal ethanol concentration), whose viability was taken to be 100% for 24 h. In 96-well plates, treated MCF-7 cells with the ethanolic leaf extracts (1 ×10 5 Rokayya et al., 2013 Reactive oxygen species Cells were labeled with a 2,7-dichlorfluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) kit to evaluate changes in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The MCF-7 cells were incubated for the entire night in 6-well culture plates in a CO 2 Thawini & Al-Shawi, 2021 Statistical analysis SPSS analytics software (version 22), and Microsoft Office Excel 2020 for utilizing the statistical analysis of raw data. All values were evaluated using Graph Pad Prism (version 8.1). When applicable, suitable statistical procedures, such as one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, were used to assess differences between variables of interest. The results were presented as mean ± standard deviation, and a p Results and Discussion Proximate chemical analysis Some nutrients were evaluated in the sidr plant (leaves, pulps, and seeds), Table 1 Ahmed & Sati (2018) Memon et al.

However, the least inhibitory effects were noted less than eight mm inhibition zone with the aqueous extract against Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa Klebsiella pneumoniae Salmonella typhi Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi, Results on the inhibitory effects on the bacterial growth on leaves were linked with Salih et al. (2019) Taha et al. (2021) Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ali, Almagboul & Mohammed, 2015 Jain, Khatana & Vijayvergia, 2019 Sarjito et al., 2021 Albalawi, 2021 AlSheikh et al., 2020 Cytotoxic effects on breast cancer cells One of the leading causes of death is cancer. Cancer can be prevented by diet and lifestyle choices. Consequently, there is a lot of interest in finding chemotherapeutic or even chemopreventative drugs in safe and natural goods ( Zahara et al., 2022 Al-Eisa et al., 2023 Fig. 4 10.7717/peerj.19858/fig-4 Figure 4 The cytotoxic effects of sidr leaves on breast cancer cells (MCF-7). The results were contrasted with control cells, which exhibit dosage-dependent inhibition. The findings of the MTT assay showed that the ethanolic extract of leaves inhibited MCF-7 cell viability by >50% at 100 µg/mL after 24 h. The results showed that cell viability decreased with the ethanolic extract for leaves concentration dose, indicating that additional concentration can accumulate inside cells, causing stress and ultimately cell death. Guidelines for cancer therapy are poor, and the disease now has a high fatality rate worldwide ( Thawini & Al-Shawi, 2021 Reactive oxygen species generation As signaling molecules, ROS are essential and have been shown to have anti-tumorigenic actions. They preserve cellular homeostasis and perform essential signaling tasks at low concentrations. When ROS present in high concentrations, they can harm lipids, proteins, and genomic DNA, among other biological molecules, which can result in the development of tumors. ROS have also been linked to tumor invasion and metastasis. Conversely, elevated ROS levels can prevent tumor growth by killing cancer cells and stopping their proliferation. The primary cause of ROS excess is recognized to be mitochondrial malfunction ( Alshahrani et al., 2024 via Fig. 5 10.7717/peerj.19858/fig-5 Figure 5 Reactive oxygen species generation of sidr leaves on breast cancer cells (MCF-7). Anticancer medications that directly accumulate ROS are effective in treating several cancer types, but because they impact both cancer and healthy cells, their effects on healthy cells are still debatable ( Thawini & Al-Shawi, 2021 Abdallah et al. (2024) Mesmar et al. (2021) Although the experiments revealed significant antibacterial, antioxidant, and anticancer properties in the ethanolic leaf extract of Ziziphus spina-christi Conclusion The primary goal of the current investigation was to determine the nutrients, phytochemical composition, and antimicrobial assessments for various sidr parts and highlight the anticancer effects on MCF-7 breast cells. Therefore, all parts of the sidr plant can be used as functional foods that enhance health due to their medical, cosmetic, pharmacological, and nutraceutical properties. Sidr plants could serve as a natural antibacterial supply, especially against bacterial species. Standardized formulations for therapeutic use can be developed using the effective extracts found in this investigation as a basis. Generally, the current work indicates that sidr plant can be used as a medicinal agent to treat breast cancer cells. It is advised that future research investigate clinical uses and enhance extraction procedures for pharmaceutical development that is scalable.
