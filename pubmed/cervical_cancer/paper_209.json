There have been accelerated developments in the field of cancer care in the state of Assam in recent times. Though the highest burden of cervical cancer is found in the northeast region, no government- initiated specific programme for cervical cancer elimination has been developed. The strategies implemented at various health care level is mostly derived from the ‘umbrella’ initiatives of NPCDCS. Due to unique cervical cancer profile of the state, there is a need to fill in the data gaps that needs to be investigated and reported and possible solutions should be outlined to optimise the continuum of care. Aims and Objectives In this article, we have reviewed the government policies related to cervical cancer and their implementation at various level of health care system of Assam. Primary objective was to report the gap existing for implementation of cervical cancer prevention and treatment strategies in the state of Assam and secondary objective was to outline possible interventions to optimize the delivery of cervical cancer screening. Methodology The relevant articles related to government policies were searched on electronic database including Pubmed, national and state-level government websites on health welfare programmes and reports of NCDIR. The data for quantification of gap in cervical cancer services and awareness was extracted from the NCDIR survey conducted as a part of cancer research in the North East Region (CaRes NER), a multidisciplinary programme for preventing and controlling cancer in the north-eastern states run by ICMR-NCDIR, Bengaluru. Results Timeline of development in the field of cancer care has been summarised in this review under the headings of government initiatives so far for cancer care and its reflection in Assam, call for cervical cancer elimination and its implications in Assam, the current situation in the state of Assam, recent developments in cancer care field in Assam. The quantification of the gaps in cervical cancer care in the state of Assam is based on data from NCDIR survey. Among 2,817 respondents, fewer than a quarter were aware of cancer screening for major cancers, with no specific data available on awareness of cervical cancer. The majority of respondents reported learning about cancer through media or friends and family, while health awareness camps contributed minimally. Only 0.8% were aware of the HPV vaccine, and 0.2% expressed hesitation in discussing cancer. Notably, none of the respondents had undergone cervical cancer screening by any method. In terms of healthcare infrastructure, less than 10% of surveyed Primary Health Centers (PHCs) and none of the Community Health Centers (CHCs) or District Hospitals provided cancer screening services. Fewer than a quarter of PHCs had counseling services for risk behavior, provided by counselors or specialized personnel. Among the medical officers at PHCs, 38.5% had received training under NPCDCS, NHM, or other state-level non-communicable disease (NCD) programs. Gynecologists were available in approximately half of the CHCs and over 80% of district hospitals. However, over 90% of PHCs reported a shortage of laboratory facilities for cancer detection. Regarding HPV vaccination, none of the CHCs offered the service, while it was available in 14.3% of district hospitals and 20.0% of private health facilities Conclusion The key findings of this review and the proposed corrective steps in this paper can be implemented in systematic manner to optimise the delivery of cancer care services and improve the outcomes.

According to Globocan 2020 data, India harbours one-fifth of cases with estimated 0.12 millions incident cases and 0.08 millions deaths [ 1 2 3 4 4 5 A crucial aspect of cervical cancer control involves early detection and timely appropriate treatment. Recent developments in the CC elimination strategy based on the premise of WHO 90-70-90 approach (HPV vaccination- Screening- Treatment) has been imbibed into clinicians and stakeholders, however, the ground reality of implementation of currently available policies remain largely unknown. Few reports have shown the unmet need of treating cancer patients in north-east region due to reduced number of cancer treating facilities, availability of radiotherapy and cancer patient welfare schemes (6). In this review, we have tried to compare what is currently available in the state of Assam and what it should be for as an effort to eliminate cervical cancer, identify the gaps in government program, and how the gaps can be mitigated. Aim and objectives In this review, we aim to find the actual implementation of programme strategies related to cervical cancer screening and treatment at various level of health care system of Assam. The objectives of this review is to quantify the gap existing for implementation of cervical precancer prevention and treatment strategies in the state of Assam and to suggest interventions to optimize the delivery of cervical cancer screening. Methodology The relevant articles related to government policies were searched on electronic database including google scholar, Pubmed, national and state-level government websites on health welfare programmes and reports of NCDIR. Main search terms used were ‘ Cervical Cancer Screening’ AND ‘Assam’, ‘ Cervical Cancer Treatment’ AND ‘Assam’, ‘ Cervical Cancer Incidence/ Prevalence’ AND ‘Assam’, ‘Assam Cancer Care Foundation’ and ‘NCDIR’ AND ‘ North-East’. We reviewed and organised the information in systematic way related to burden of cervical cancer in Assam, awareness/ attitude/ practice related to the disease, the government initiatives for cancer care and its implications, the infra-structure and strategies adopted at various tiers of health care system to combat the disease and the recent developments in cancer care model in Assam. The main data for quantification of gap in cervical cancer services and awareness was extracted from the National Centre for Disease Informatics and Research (NCDIR) survey conducted as a part of cancer research in the North East Region (CaRes NER), a multidisciplinary programme for preventing and controlling cancer in the north-eastern states run by ICMR-NCDIR, Bengaluru. The survey utilised multistage cluster random sampling method and was conducted in a phased manner between November 2019 and December 2020 with the target population aged 18 or above. The total sample size was calculated to be 2880 in the four PBCR covering area (Cachar, Kamrup, Dibrugarh, Karimganj). The details of methodology can be obtained from the “Report on Monitoring Survey of Cancer Risk Factors and Health System Response in North East Region (NER) of India” [ 7 Results Government initiatives so far for cancer care and its reflection in Assam The earliest efforts to combat cancer in India dates back to 1976, when National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) was launched. Cervical cancer being a common cancer (along with oral and breast cancer) in India, it advocated its control through primary prevention by adopting measures like, health education and necessity of genital hygiene for its prevention. It also emphasised upon early detection of preventable cancers including cervical cancer by screening methods, facilitated strengthening of existing cancer treatment infrastructure and promoted palliative care. National Cancer Registry Programme (NCRP) was then initiated in 1982 by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which gives a picture of the magnitude and patterns of cancer. There are two types of registries; Population Based Cancer Registry (PBCR) and Hospital Based Cancer Registries (HBCR), which were started in January 1982. The PBCR take the sample population in a geographically defined area while the HBCR take the data from patients coming to a particular health institution. They provide data to ICMR on a regular basis [ 8 7 In 2010, NCCP was integrated with the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPDCS) to form NPCDCS (National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke). Under NPCDCS, Non Communicable Disease (NCD) Cells were established at National, State and District levels for programme management, and NCD Clinics were set up at District and CHC levels, to provide services for early and free diagnostics, treatment and follow-up for common NCDs. For the Cancer component, there is a Tertiary Care Cancer Centers (TCCC) scheme, which aims at setting up/strengthening of State Cancer Institutes (SCI) and TCCCs for providing comprehensive cancer care in the country. Among these NCD Clinic attendees during 2015-16, around 13,000 persons were detected with common Cancers [ 9 10 NCDIR under the aegis of Indian council of medical research (ICMR) aims to sustain and develop a national research data-base on cancer, and various NCDs through recent advances in electronic information technology with a national collaborative network. ICMR-NCDIR publishes reports of HBCR and PBCR and various surveys from time-to-time so as to undertake aetiological, epidemiological, clinical and control research in these areas [ 11 Call for cervical cancer elimination and its implications in Assam In May 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a call for elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem through widespread HPV vaccination, screening, early diagnosis and treatment of cervical pre-cancer and cancer. In November 2020, WHO launched a global Strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer. The strategy proposes an elimination threshold of 4 cases per 100,000 women, achieved by implementing the triple intervention targets by 2030 (Fig. 1 12  Fig. 1 Triple intervention as endorsed by WHO for cervical cancer elimination Even though the world is striving to achieve the specific goal of 90-70-90 for cervical cancer elimination, no government- initiated specific programme for cervical cancer elimination has been developed in India. The strategies implemented for cervical cancer control in India and its states including Assam at various health care level is mostly derived from the umbrella strategies of NPCDCS [ 9 13  Health promotion through awareness generation of early warning signals of common cancer, behaviour change and counselling and community education by inter personal communication, involvement of various categories of mass media, civil society, community based organization, panchayats/local bodies, other government departments and private sector, Screening and early detection of target population (age 30 years and above) opportunistic and/or camp approach at different levels of health facilities and also in urban slums of large cities, Timely, affordable and accurate diagnosis, Access to affordable treatment, Rehabilitation, Training of Auxiliary Midwife Nurses (ANMs), Establishment/strengthening of health infrastructure, CHC and district hospitals (DH), Establishing NCD clinics and strengthening laboratory at CHC and DHs, Public private partnership, which can be both for the purpose of new facility development or for outreach programmes. The feasibility of its contribution has been proven in Indian setting [ 14 Financial support to district and CHC/FRU/PHC for procurement of screening devices, essential drugs, consumables, transport of referral cases, Outreach services, Integration with AYUSH- The National Health Policy highlights the importance of mainstreaming AYUSH systems through integration and aiming to achieve the objective of reducing premature mortality from NCD including cancer by up to 25% by the year 2025 [ 15 Research and surveillance- on creating database, applied and operational research related to the programme, Survey for risk factors for NCDs, Cancer registry programme of ICMR, Monitoring and evaluation of the programme would be carried out at different levels through NCD cells, reports, regular visits to the field and periodic review meetings, Utilization of laboratory technician and health workers for screening with cytology/HPV at PHCs, Provision of a gynaecologist trained in colposcopy at CHC level, colposcopy equipment (1–3 per district) and a thermal/cryoablation unit, a pathologist, Improving training in Regional Cancer Centers (RCC) and training institutes (emphasis on surgical skills), Infrastructure for radiation and imaging techniques. The key targets to reach by March 2017 for cancer control were to establish 2 National Cancer Institute (NCI), 20 State Cancer Institute (SCI), 50 TCCC, chemotherapy facilities in atleast 75% of DH and 70 institutional networks on cancer registry. Financial assistance to each state under NPCDCS, is based on number of units to be taken up at different levels and on centre share: state share basis. The centre : state share is 75:25 except for North East & hilly states where Share is 90:10. The complete report on how far is the development in implementing each of this element in Assam is not available. Unlike routine grassroots-level screening for oral or breast cancer (such as that conducted at sub-centers), cervical cancer screening—whether through Pap smear or VIA/VILI—requires significantly more clinical and pathological support. Therefore, implementing cervical cancer screening at the grassroots level heavily depends on the financial capacity of the state government, particularly to meet the 25% share in the 75:25 central-to-state funding ratio. The data indicating whether these financial allocations have been consistently provided, or if essential components have been denied due to lack of funds is not available. Diagnostic facilities in the form of pathology services (histopathology and / or immunohistochemistry) and imaging ( magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography and PET-CT) is expanding. PET- MRI and medical cyclotron has recently been installed at SCI. Regarding radiation facilities, government centres have altogether 6 linear accelerators, four telecobalt machines, 3 high-dose rate brachytherapy units, 2 CT simulators, and 2 conventional X-ray treatment planning systems. A private hospital also caters to radiation services [ 16 The current situation in the state of Assam As per the 2011 census, the total population of Assam was 31,169,272 forming 2.58% of India and with a growth rate of 16.93% in the last ten years. The total population of Assam is expected to reach 35.60 million by 2026. The districts with higher population concentration are Kamrup, Nagaon, Sonitpur, Barpeta, Dhubri, Darrang, and Cachar. The total area of Assam is 78,438 square km. Thus the population density of Assam is 398 per square km which is higher than the national average of 382 per square km [ 17 7 Cancer is among the top five leading causes of death in the state. In females, the cervix uteri form the highest proportion (15.4%) followed by breast (14.1%) and that of the gall bladder (11.1%) [ 7 18 Recent developments in cancer care field in Assam Set up in December 2017, Assam Cancer Care Foundation (ACCF) is a joint partnership between the government of Assam and Tata trusts. They have proposed a tiered service delivery model to ensure cancer care at every levels. SCI, Guwahati and ACCF cancer centre, Dibrugarh will serve as Level 1 also called as apex centres. Level 2 have dedicated unit, annexed to government medical college/ multi- speciality hospital and include Barpeta, Diphu and Silchar. Tezpur, Lakhimpur, Jorhat, Darrang, Kokrajhar are being developed as level 3 which facilitate diagnostics and day care unit annexed to DH to provide services like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Level 4 will strive for awareness, community screening, home based palliative care with facilities sharing common resources with SCI, government medical colleges and DHs, wherever possible. It has set up six health screening and awareness kiosks - ‘Swasth Assam’ - at OPDs of various medical college hospitals. General health check-up and screening for various NCD including cervical screening services are being provided at the centre. Palliative care units, Onco care centres and radiotherapy unit are being set up in medical colleges. Along with tobacco control programs, screening through NHM programs, camps; health promotion drives and Cancer awareness; training of staff involved in screening at Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs), PHC, CHC, and DHs are being carried out. The foundation has been actively organizing community outreach programmes in remote areas in collaboration with local organizations with an added advantage. To change the ratio of early to late diagnosis of cancer from 30:70 to 70:30, awareness and screening camps are being organised across the state. Patient Navigators have strengthened the ‘continuum of care’ by streamlined follow-up and coordination mechanism. The collaboration between Amalgamated Plantations Pvt. Ltd. (APPL) tea gardens and ACCF have collaborated for screening, awareness and treatment facilitation services; for residents of tea gardens. The private partnership is deemed to accelerate and boost the development in all aspects of care delivery. For instance, according to ACCF, interstitial brachytherapy template was successfully performed recently at Dibrugarh cancer centre which has been the first such procedure in upper Assam [ 19 Gaps in cervical cancer care in the state of Assam Data are derived from the latest NCDIR report [ 6 Primary level strategies Gap in implementing primary level strategies was assessed through assessment of level of awareness and source of information about cancer screening. Among 2817 respondents, 23.5% were aware of cancer screening of three major cancers- oral, breast and cervical. No data was available for awareness of cervical cancer exclusively. Majority of them heard from media (73.9%), friends and family members (68.8%), and health worker (47.2%). Only 19.4% was contributed by health awareness camps. A minority of total population comprising 0.8% were aware about HPV vaccine and 0.2% felt hesitant to talk about cancer. None of the respondents had ever undergone cervical cancer screening by either means of VIA, PAP, HPV-DNA or any other methods. More-so, none had received advice to screen for cancer by doctor / health worker in the last one year. Health care facilities related to cervical cancer screening at primary level There are 4678 sub-centres, 765 health and wellness centres - sub centres, 1001 PHCs, and 379 health and wellness centre - PHC in Assam. The number of government allopathic doctors and dental surgeons are 6626. Among 6 interviewed PHCs in urban areas and 46 in rural, outpatient services were available in 5 (83.3%) and 46 (100%) facilities. However, cervical cancer screening facilities were present in only 4 (8.7%) of rural PHCs. Organised screening was done in 7 (15.2%) and opportunistic in 2 (4.3%) centres of rural areas. Referral system for screen positive patients was done to CHC, DH, TCH or private health facility. IEC materials related to cancer in the form of posters, videos, pamphlets or booklets were displayed/available in the patient waiting room / outpatient in 23 (44.2%), 2 (3.8%), 16 (30.8%) and 2 (3.8%) respectively. Proportion of MBBS medical officer, AYUSH medical officer, and Auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) trained for NPCDCS/NHM(NCD related)/state program were 4/6 (66.7), 1/1 (16.7) and 1/6 (16.7) respectively in urban PHCs. None of the staff nurse (0/6) or lady health visitor (0/1) were trained for this. Laboratory for cervical cancer screening with VIA was available in 5/46 (10.9%) of rural PHCs. The number of PHCs with availability of equipment and supplies in stocks for both vaginal speculum (Cusco’s and Sims) and torch / examination light were 4 (66.7%) and 31 (67.4%) in urban and rural areas respectively. Health care facilities related to cervical cancer screening at secondary level There are 199 CHCs, 14 sub-district hospitals, 24 DHs in the state of Assam. Among secondary health care facilities, number of CHC and DH were inadequate for both rural and urban population. Among 27 CHC and 7 DH, the availability of human resources were also inadequate. Only 16 (59.3%) CHC reported the availability of Gynaecologist of which 1 (3.7%) was trained for NPCDCS/ NHM(NCD related)/ State program. While 6 (85.7% ) DH reported the availability of Gynaecologist of which 1 (14.3%) was trained for NPCDCS/ NHM(NCD related)/ State program. Pathologist, General duty Medical Officer, Staff Nurse, Lab technicians, and Data Entry Operator were inadequately trained for the aforesaid program. Written standard treatment guidelines under NPCDCS was available in 13 (86.7%) and 2 (66.7) only. Cervical Cancer screening facility were available in 2 (28.6%) DHs (Table 1  Table 1 Laboratory and equipment & supplies in public secondary health care facilities (Percentage).

Various state government health schemes included ‘Assam Arogya Nidhi’, ‘Atal Amrit Abhiyan’ and chief minister’s free diagnostic services. Private secondary health care facility Cervical cancer screening facilities was available in 2/26 (7.7%) of urban centres and in none of rural centres. All of the centres had medical officer (MBBS and above), while specialists were available in 75–80% of facilities. HPV Vaccination and general pathology services were available in 6/26 (23.1%) and 4/ 26 (15.4%) of urban centres and in none of rural ones. Type of health facility or health care provider from where cancer care was taken among those who sought treatment Out of total cancer patients, the number of cervical cancer patients was 1 (16.7%) and 2 (16.7%) respectively among urban and rural respondents and constituted 30% of female cancers. Most of the female cancer patients 7/10 (77.8%) sought cancer care within the state and within government facility 5 (50%). 5 (50%) of female cancer patients were self- financed or took loans or sold assets and none had Health insurance schemes/ hospital incentives. Discussion India has a herculean task in front of it to achieve the goal of 90-70-90 for cervical cancer elimination. Assam is the most populous state in North-eastern India. A large part of the state is covered by hills and forests. The geographical indisposition, rugged terrain, vast hilly areas, and many ethnic groups contribute to the shortage of quality cancer-related health care facilities [ 20 1st pillar of goal of cervical cancer elimination is vaccination. It has been projected statistically that if global targets for HPV vaccination are met, cervical cancer cases could drop by 89% in the 78 worst affected countries which would avert 60 million cases of cancer over next century [ 21 22 According to this survey, HPV vaccination was provided by 14.3% of the DH and 20.0% of the private health facilities. None of the CHC had the provision of HPV vaccination, the reason of which could not be found in the available literature. Possible ways to combat the issue of low HPV vaccination is mentioned in the Table 2 23  Vaccine Gardasil Cervarix Gardasil-9 Cervavac Cost ₹2,800 per dose ₹3,299 per dose ₹ 9,100 per dose Rs 250 2nd pillar of cervical cancer elimination is screening. The FOGSI – GCPR (Federation of Obsterician and Gynaecologists of India- Good Clinical Practice Recommendations) recommends HPV testing, cytology or visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) in good resource settings. However, to ensure an acceptable cervical cancer prevention strategy in limited resource settings, VIA and affordable HPV test (if available), including self-sampling, can be used for screening of cervical cancer. Still, there are several obstacles to it [ 24 25 26 27 At primary level, we found that less than 10% of the surveyed PHCs’, none of the CHCs’ or DHs and 10% private secondary health facilities provided cancer screening services. 38.5% of the Medical Officers positioned at the PHCs had been trained for NPCDCS/NHM (NCD related)/State program. Over 90% of the PHCs’ reported to shortage of lab facilities for cancer detection. So, expanding screening coverage to populations with limited access is of utmost priority now. To overcome the challenge of effective cancer screening service delivery, actions are to be taken at all the three levels of health care system, health care providers and the eligible individuals to undergo screening and follow-up. Amidst limited financial and personal resources available cancer screening must be prioritised by clinicians, health care systems, payers, and patients. From the patient’s perspective, it should be able to reduce the risk of death due the disease. However, policy makers would benefit from knowing if increasing the intensity of the screening test administration or allocating money to alternative screening strategies would result in greater gains in health [ 28 None of the respondents had ever undergone cervical cancer screening by either means of VIA, PAP, HPV-DNA or any other methods. It is challenging to comprehend the reasons for inadequate uptake of screening; given the complicated interactions between demographic factors including income, education, and race and ethnicity. Whether they are the actual racial or ethnic traits rather than the socioeconomic status that are related to hesitancy for screening. The concern that race and ethnicity affect cancer screening even after adjusting for these cofactors is supported by evidence from a large body of social epidemiology research that has looked into this topic. Multi-strategy interventions are found to be more effective than any one intervention alone. Examples include programs that integrate case management by culturally sensitive community health educators and the print or other media to communicate the benefits of cervical examination, general education of the community regarding screening, and the handling of logistic barriers by arranging appointments for cervical screening and transportation to those appointments [ 28 The 3rd pillar of cervical pre-cancerous and cancer treatment is dependent on the availability of trained doctors including oncologist, infrastructure related to pathological laboratories, adequate radiation facilities and robust implementation of 2nd pillar. In our survey, physicians and surgeons were available only in a little over 10% of the CHCs. Gynaecologists were available in only about half of the CHCs’ and over 80% in DH. Only 33.3% of private secondary health facilities that were surveyed had cancer treatment facilities. Appreciation and rewards encourage growth at the primary level and improve the rendered services. Recently, NHM Assam was awarded the third rank by the Union ministry ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW). The best comprehensive primary health care (CPHC) team member from each state were also felicitated at the event. CPHC team members from Piazbari sub centre-health and wellness centre from Dhubri district in west Assam got the award.  Table 2 Possible strategies to combat the hurdles in implementing various aspects of three pillars of cervical cancer elimination Hurdles to implement different pillars in Assam Possible ways to combat Lack of awareness Political will to reach even out-skirts of the country and link awareness programme with social media Cost-effectiveness relative to other programs competing for resources Cost reduction by use of indigenous vaccine Limited availability of vaccine To include the vaccine in the National and state level programme Inadequate and unstructured health care system Sensitising Block/ Chief Medical Officers (BMO/CMO) at primary/ secondary levels of care and general practitioners including gynaecologists at tertiary level Initiating and sustaining an immunization program for adolescents School-based programme to deliver other adolescent health services alongwith. In areas where the rate of school enrollment among girls is low, community-based efforts to reach girls. Myths associated with vaccine Allay fear regarding attempts to control fertility among young women, Take ideas from COVID 19 awareness programme Cultural acceptability and public support To link ASHA and other health care workers to create awareness regarding the deadly nature of this preventable disease Change in paradigm of screening Using genital cancer survivors to change views on sexuality and sexual health, utilising ANM to provide self-collection kits and collect the swabs, teaching nurses to use modern cervical screening devices, utilising Artificial intelligence-based services, national programmes, and political commitment Conclusion The foundation for acceleration of cancer care services has already been laid and is being promoted by public-private partnership in the state of Assam. There has been a recent gain in momentum for building infrastructure for the same. The key findings of this study and the proposed corrective steps can be implemented in systematic manner to optimise the delivery of cancer care services and improve the outcomes.
