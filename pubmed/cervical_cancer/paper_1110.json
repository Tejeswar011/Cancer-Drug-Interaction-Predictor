This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/401460-caribbean-women-face-higher-obesity-and-diabetes-amid-socioeconomic-struggles Background Women in the Caribbean region experience significant health disparities shaped by intersecting medical and socioeconomic challenges. High rates of obesity, diabetes, and maternal mortality have been observed alongside persistent inequalities in development, employment, and food access. This study aimed to assess gender-based disparities in obesity, diabetes, reproductive health, and socioeconomic conditions across Caribbean countries, comparing outcomes to North America to identify structural drivers of women’s health inequities. Methods We analyzed regional and gender-based trends in health and social outcomes across up to 30 Caribbean countries. Publicly available data from 2019 to 2022 were compiled to assess noncommunicable disease prevalence, reproductive health indicators, and key economic metrics. Caribbean nations were compared to the United States and Canada to contextualize findings. Results Women in the Caribbean had higher obesity prevalence and a greater proportion of diabetes-related deaths compared to men. The region also reported elevated maternal and infant mortality, lower inequality-adjusted development scores, and wider gender gaps in unemployment. Food insecurity affected more than 40% of the population in several countries. Adolescent fertility and mortality rates were also higher in the Caribbean than in North America. Multivariate analyses revealed strong associations between chronic disease outcomes and structural indicators such as healthcare access and economic inequality. Conclusion Caribbean women face compounding health risks driven by overlapping medical, economic, and social vulnerabilities. These disparities highlight the need for coordinated regional strategies that go beyond behavioral health to address the broader structural determinants of health and gender equity. caribbean health disparities diabetes prevalence food insecurity and health gender disparities healthcare access barriers noncommunicable diseases obesity epidemiology public health inequities socioeconomic determinants of health women's health outcomes pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Gender health disparities are a well-documented global issue, with women often facing worse outcomes in chronic diseases, mental health, and access to healthcare [ 1 2 3 4 5 Despite its relative wealth, the Bahamas exhibits high obesity rates and diabetes-related mortality, consistent with global trends showing disproportionate NCD burdens in middle-income nations [ 6 4 7 Beyond chronic diseases, reproductive health poses additional risks. In the United States [ 8 9 9 10 11 We aimed to examine gender-based disparities in obesity and diabetes and their association with structural socioeconomic variables, using data from up to 30 non-Latin Caribbean countries. This study contributes new regional evidence on how structural inequities, including healthcare access, socioeconomic vulnerability, and gender-specific risks, shape women’s health across the Caribbean. By integrating chronic disease, reproductive health, and policy data, our findings provide a foundation for understanding the multifaceted drivers of health inequality in the region. This article was previously posted as a preprint on medRxiv on March 22, 2025 ( https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.22.25324462 Materials and methods Study design and data collection This cross-sectional study analyzed gender disparities in health outcomes across up to 30 Non-Latin Caribbean and reference countries using publicly available data from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for most health indicators, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for Human Development Index (HDI), Inequality-Adjusted HDI, and selected economic metrics, and the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) for diabetes prevalence and hyperglycemia in pregnancy rates by region. The analysis included metrics on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), reproductive health outcomes, and socioeconomic indicators, comparing these to benchmarks in North America (NA). All data used in this study were aggregate, country-level indicators obtained from public sources. No individual-level or patient-specific data were accessed or analyzed. Most health and socioeconomic indicators used in this study were from 2019, the most recent year with comprehensive and comparable country-level data. These data sources were selected for their coverage, credibility, and relevance, particularly given the limited availability of peer-reviewed literature addressing Caribbean health outcomes. Analyses were performed using the maximum number of countries available for each indicator while retaining all countries to preserve regional representation. Sixteen countries contributed data for at least 85% of variables; the remainder had more limited coverage. A table of the data used for the study is included in the Appendices section. The primary outcomes assessed were obesity and diabetes prevalence, maternal and adolescent health metrics, and socioeconomic disparities, including Human Development Index (HDI) scores, food insecurity, and unemployment rates. Several key health indicators, particularly mortality outcomes, required clarification due to differences in how they were defined or reported across primary sources. For transparency, we explain how select metrics were interpreted or calculated in this analysis. External mortality was classified as deaths from injuries, violence, traffic incidents, and other unintentional causes, following PAHO definitions. NCD mortality included deaths from chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory illness. Diabetes-related mortality was assessed using two complementary measures. The first was the age-adjusted diabetes mortality rate, defined by PAHO as the number of deaths per 100,000 population in which diabetes was identified as the underlying cause of death. This determination was based on national death certificate data coded using the International Classification of Diseases, submitted annually by member states to PAHO. This metric was used to compare overall diabetes mortality across regions. The second measure was the proportion of deaths due to diabetes, calculated by dividing the diabetes mortality rate by the general mortality rate (both age-adjusted) for each group. This proportion allowed us to assess the relative contribution of diabetes to total mortality within each gender group in the Caribbean. Additional variables related to lifestyle, healthcare access, and reproductive health were included to provide a broader context. In a separate analysis, we assessed national-level policy implementation related to NCD prevention using data from the 2022 PAHO ENLACE interactive scorecard. This tool evaluates country-level progress on commitments outlined in the 2011 UN Political Declaration and the 2014 UN Outcome Document on NCDs. Four policy indicators were selected: (1) national evidence-based clinical guidelines for NCD management, (2) policies or campaigns promoting physical activity, (3) implementation of the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, and (4) restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages to children. Each indicator was classified by PAHO as fully implemented (green), partially implemented (yellow), not implemented (red), or unknown (grey). For the policy implementation analysis, we used 2022 ENLACE data, as no comparable implementation metrics were collected in 2019, and earlier rounds used different definitions. Countries were grouped into two regions: North America (n = 2; Canada and the United States) and the Caribbean (n = 13; Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago). Data analysis All data processing and visualization, including scatterplots and trend lines, were conducted using Microsoft Excel. More advanced statistical analyses, such as Pearson Correlations and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), were performed in Python, as described later. For gender-wise comparisons, Student’s t-tests were used to compare male-to-female differences within Caribbean nations for each metric. Welch’s t-tests were used for country-level comparisons, grouping the United States and Canada as one group (North America or NA) and up to 30 non-Latin Caribbean nations as the other group (Caribbean or CAR), with a significance cutoff of p < 0.05 [ 12 https://gadm.org/data.html Due to incomplete reporting across key indicators in several countries, data imputation was performed to allow their inclusion in correlation and PCA analyses while minimizing bias from missingness. Countries with less than 75% of data for each variable were excluded, and the remaining missing data for 16 countries were imputed using Predictive Mean Matching within the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations framework in Python. This approach maintains the original data distribution by matching predicted values to the closest observed values, ensuring realistic imputation. After data imputation, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to examine associations. PCA was performed using the imputed data to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset with socio-economic and health indicators across the 16 countries. Variables with high collinearity were removed based on Pearson correlations before PCA, and additional variables were hand-selected based on relevance to women’s health metrics, socio-economic indicators, and other health-related metrics. In this analysis, normality was assessed for all 51 variables using the Shapiro-Wilk test, with 76% meeting normality criteria, which was deemed sufficient to proceed with PCA. A scree plot confirmed that the first two principal components explained most of the variance. Ward’s hierarchical clustering was applied to the PCA scores to group countries based on their socio-economic and health profiles, while the elbow method was applied to select the number of clusters. Bootstrapping was performed with 1,000 iterations to assess the stability of the PCA results, achieving a 95% confidence interval. Ethical considerations This study used publicly available, aggregated secondary data from international organizations and did not involve human subjects. Therefore, formal ethical approval was not required. Results The Caribbean nations show distinct gendered mortality patterns, with women facing higher diabetes mortality We first examined 2019 PAHO data across 30 Caribbean nations to evaluate gender-specific health outcomes. External mortality rates were significantly higher in men (110.68 per 100,000) compared to women (31.01; p < 0.001), while NCD mortality was higher in women (83.18%) than in men (75.33%; p < 0.01). Communicable Disease (CD) mortality showed no significant gender difference (Figure 1A 1B 1C Figure 1 Gender-based disparities in mortality and health indicators across the Caribbean region All data were obtained from PAHO using 2019 data. (A) A Student's t-test was performed examining the external causes mortality rate (Ext. Mortality rate, age-adjusted per 100,000 population) and the proportion of deaths from noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and communicable diseases (CDs) (%) by gender. (B) A Student's t-test was performed measuring the age-adjusted mortality rates (per 100,000 population) for ischemic heart disease, respiratory diseases, cirrhosis, and stomach cancer by gender. (C) A Student's t-test was performed to measure the diabetes mortality rate (per 100,000 population) and a Welch’s t-test was used to compare proportional diabetes mortality (%) between the USA/Canada and the Caribbean nations by gender. (D) Prevalence of insufficient physical activity and obesity (%) by gender. Asterisks denote statistical significance: p < 0.05 = *, p < 0.01 = **, p < 0.001 = **. To assess potential contributors to this pattern, we analyzed lifestyle metrics. Women in the Caribbean reported significantly higher rates of insufficient physical activity compared to men (67.79% vs. 53.47%; p < 0.001), and obesity prevalence was also higher among women (43.88% vs. 29.77%; p < 0.001; Figure 1D The Caribbean region faces greater socioeconomic and health challenges compared to the USA/Canada We then aimed to expand on the observed gendered health disparities and assessed socioeconomic conditions in the Caribbean relative to North America (NA). The region had significantly lower Human Development Index (HDI) scores (0.76 vs. 0.93; p < 0.001) and Inequality-Adjusted HDI (0.56 vs. 0.84; p < 0.01), reflecting more limited development and deeper structural inequality (Figure 2A 2B 2C 2D Figure 2 The Caribbean region faces greater socioeconomic and health challenges compared to the USA/Canada Human Development Index (HDI) and Inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI) data were obtained from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for 2019, while all other data were from the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for 2019.

Reproductive and early-life health indicators underscore deep regional and gender inequities To build on the observed health and socioeconomic disparities, we examined reproductive and early-life health outcomes in the Caribbean compared to NA. Maternal mortality was significantly higher in the Caribbean (9.39 per 10,000 live births) than in NA (1.41; p < 0.001), and infant mortality showed a similar trend, with rates more than twice as high in the Caribbean (11.58 vs. 5 per 1,000 live births; p < 0.001; Figure 3A 3B 3C 3D Figure 3 The Caribbean nations exhibit greater health and economic vulnerabilities compared to the USA/Canada Welch’s t-tests were used to compare the USA/Canada (US/CAN) with 30 Caribbean nations across all variables.

We also explored gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) prevalence as a marker of maternal health vulnerability. Both the Caribbean and North America reported a GDM prevalence of 20.7%, placing the region behind South-East Asia (25.9%) but ahead of South and Central America (15.8%; Figure 4 Figure 4 Prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by region, 2021 All data were obtained from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) for the year 2021. The dataset represents the prevalence of hyperglycemia in pregnancy (age 20-49) across different regions. The map was created in QGIS 3.34 T using shapefiles from the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM), available at https://gadm.org/data.html. Diabetes and obesity outcomes strongly correlate with socioeconomic development and healthcare access in Caribbean populations We examined how socioeconomic conditions relate to population health by conducting Pearson correlation analyses across Caribbean nations with at least 75% data availability, with results visualized in a correlation heatmap (Figure 5A Figure 5 Correlation of health and demographic variables and distinct regional health profiles in the Caribbean Only data with at least 75% availability were included for Pearson correlation and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). (A) illustrates the relationships between health and demographic variables across countries with at least 75% data availability. Positive correlations are shown in red, and negative correlations in blue, with stronger correlations indicated by more intense colors. (B) PCA identified three distinct clusters of countries. Principal Component 1 (PC1) reflects socioeconomic status and health outcomes, while Principal Component 2 (PC2) represents healthcare access and lifestyle-related health risks. Clusters highlight the USA, Canada, and Cuba with favorable health outcomes, intermediate Caribbean nations with moderate health and socioeconomic challenges, and more vulnerable Caribbean nations with higher adolescent mortality and fertility rates. Economic development was moderately correlated with multiple reproductive and adolescent health outcomes. Higher GDP per capita was associated with increased low birth weight prevalence (r = 0.610) and lower adolescent fertility (r = -0.710), suggesting complex links between economic status, maternal health, and early-life reproductive patterns [ 13 14 To identify underlying patterns in health and socioeconomic indicators, we performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) across countries with sufficient data availability. Two principal components explained the majority of variance in the dataset (Figure 5B Hierarchical clustering applied to PCA scores revealed three country groups with distinct profiles. The first cluster, Canada, the United States, and Cuba had the most favorable outcomes, including the lowest adolescent mortality (1.41 per 1,000) and fertility rates (24.6 births per 1,000), and the highest life expectancy (81.9 years). The second cluster, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago, showed intermediate outcomes, with adolescent mortality of 1.74 per 1,000, adolescent fertility of 35.6 per 1,000, and a life expectancy of 77.7 years. The third cluster, composed of the Bahamas, Belize, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname, demonstrated the greatest vulnerability. This group had the highest adolescent mortality (3.70 per 1,000), adolescent fertility (54.0 per 1,000), and the lowest life expectancy (73.7 years). It also reported the highest maternal mortality (123.1 per 100,000), with Haiti as an outlier at 128.4 per 100,000. Caribbean and North American countries differ in policy implementation for NCD prevention National action on NCD prevention varies widely across the Americas, as shown by comparisons of four key policy indicators from the 2022 PAHO ENLACE NCD scorecard. This analysis included North America (NA: United States and Canada) and 13 countries in the Caribbean region (CAR: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago) (Figure 6 Figure 6 Implementation of NCD-related policies across the Caribbean region and North America Data are from the 2022 Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) ENLACE interactive non-communicable disease (NCD) scorecard. Each bar represents the number of countries classified by implementation status across four key policy areas: national NCD guidelines, physical activity awareness, regulation of breastmilk substitutes, and marketing restrictions to children. Green indicates full implementation, yellow partial implementation, red no implementation, and grey unknown status. Panel A shows results for North America (n = 2; United States and Canada), both of which fully implemented three of the four policies, with no action taken on breastmilk substitute regulation. Panel B displays results for the Caribbean (n = 13; Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago), where implementation was more variable. Most Caribbean countries had not implemented policies on marketing to children or breastmilk substitutes, while a subset had made progress on NCD guidelines and physical activity awareness. We began by examining the presence of national NCD guidelines, which were fully implemented in both NA countries. In the Caribbean region, full implementation was reported in Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. Six countries, including Belize, Barbados, Bahamas, Guyana, Jamaica, and Suriname, had partially implemented guidelines, while the remaining four had taken no action. This mixed picture suggests that although some Caribbean countries are progressing toward national NCD care standards, full adoption remains limited. We then assessed physical activity awareness policies, which were fully implemented in both NA countries. In CAR, Barbados, Belize, and Saint Lucia had achieved full implementation, while Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago reported partial implementation. The remaining eight countries, including Jamaica, the Bahamas, and Antigua and Barbuda, had no such policies in place. The gap in physical activity promotion across much of the region may reflect both resource limitations and the absence of coordinated national strategies. Regulation of breastmilk substitutes showed minimal uptake in both regions. Neither NA country had implemented policies aligned with the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. Among Caribbean countries, only Guyana had fully implemented this policy. All others, including Saint Lucia, Jamaica, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, had not adopted any regulatory measures. Despite growing global consensus on the importance of protecting breastfeeding, this remains a neglected policy area across most of the Caribbean. Finally, marketing restrictions on children revealed the sharpest contrast. Canada and the United States had both fully implemented these protections. In contrast, all 13 CAR countries reported no implementation. This includes countries like Barbados and Belize that have otherwise made progress in other areas. The complete lack of child-targeted marketing regulation across the Caribbean raises concerns about commercial influences on childhood diet and long-term NCD risk. Discussion This study examined gender disparities in health outcomes across the Caribbean, focusing on how socioeconomic conditions, healthcare access, and systemic inequalities disproportionately affect women's health. The analysis highlighted the intersection of chronic diseases, reproductive health disparities, and economic stressors, with a particular focus on the Bahamas due to its notable obesity rates, limited healthcare access, and elevated mortality metrics. Building upon prior research, this study provides novel insights into the complex relationship between gender, health outcomes, and socioeconomic factors in the region [ 2 3 Our findings revealed significant gender disparities in NCDs, including obesity and diabetes. Women in the Bahamas exhibited higher obesity rates (54.1%) than men (38.3%), a disparity that aligns with broader NCD trends observed across the Caribbean [ 2 3 15 15 16 5A 5B 17 Reproductive health disparities also emerged as a defining element of gendered health inequality in the Caribbean. Maternal mortality rates in the region (9.39 per 10,000 live births ± 5.22) were substantially higher than those in North America, and adolescent fertility rates (34.26 per 10,000 ± 19.49) also exceeded those observed in high-income countries (p < 0.001 and p = 0.05, respectively). These patterns echo previous findings linking structural inequity and gender-based health disparities to weaker reproductive health systems and limited access to prenatal care [ 18 19 20 21 22 Socioeconomic conditions such as high income inequality and food insecurity continue to shape these health outcomes. Despite having the highest GDP per capita in the region, the Bahamas remains one of the most unequal societies, as indicated by its IHDI and GINI coefficients. This contradiction helps explain its simultaneous burden of economic wealth and elevated obesity prevalence, which we identified as the highest in the Caribbean. These patterns suggest that economic growth alone is insufficient to reduce chronic disease risk without equity-focused health and social policies. While social conditions remain central, emerging evidence also points to biological contributors. Genetic studies have identified African ancestry-linked variants, such as ZRANB3, that impair insulin secretion and increase diabetes risk [ 23 Similar disparities have been observed across other chronic conditions. For instance, studies show that cataract burden in Caribbean small island developing states (SIDS) disproportionately affects socioeconomically disadvantaged populations [ 24 19 25 19 26 27 The Caribbean’s economic dependence on tourism further compounds these structural vulnerabilities. While tourism boosts national GDP, it often generates low-wage, seasonal employment with limited job security or healthcare benefits. This economic structure mirrors prior findings on how gender-based and economic vulnerabilities shape health outcomes in the Caribbean [ 22 22 Our PCA-derived clusters offer further insight into how structural inequality manifests across the region. Cuba’s clustering alongside high-income countries like the U.S. and Canada is striking, given its much lower GDP ($103.43 billion vs. $1.74 trillion for Canada and $21.54 trillion for the U.S. in 2019) and ongoing economic constraints [ 28 29 In contrast, countries in the red cluster, such as the Bahamas, Belize, Dominican Republic, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Suriname, exhibited consistent patterns of socioeconomic vulnerability, under-resourced health systems, and disproportionately high gender-related disparities in NCD outcomes [ 4 The wide gaps in policy implementation observed in this study underscore the urgent need for coordinated equity-driven public health reform across the Caribbean. While countries in North America have achieved broad adoption of foundational NCD prevention policies, most Caribbean countries remain at an early stage, particularly in the areas of child-targeted marketing, breastfeeding protections, and physical activity promotion [ 30 7 The complete absence of marketing restrictions to children across all 13 Caribbean countries included in this analysis is especially concerning given the region’s documented challenges with ultra-processed food exposure, school-based advertising, and limited regulatory enforcement [ 30 4 9 3 Improving policy adoption will require more than regional consensus statements; it will demand clear political commitment, cross-country collaboration, and investment in health system readiness. Models like the PAHO ENLACE scorecard can provide useful benchmarking, but implementation support must go beyond measurement. Prior research has shown that achieving population-level impact requires aligning fiscal policies, regulatory tools, and public education strategies, particularly when tackling upstream drivers of NCDs such as poverty, food insecurity, and gender inequity [ 18 Efforts to advance universal healthcare coverage, reduce out-of-pocket costs, and embed preventive services into routine care are particularly promising for women’s health outcomes in vulnerable settings [ 30 This study has several limitations. Its cross-sectional design limits causal inference, allowing only for the identification of associations between economic conditions, healthcare access, and health outcomes. The analysis relied on publicly available datasets from PAHO, UNDP, and IDF due to the limited availability of peer-reviewed data on Caribbean health metrics, which may introduce inconsistencies in data quality across countries. Data imputation was used sparingly and only for the Pearson correlation and PCA analyses to preserve sample size; while necessary, this may have introduced minor bias. Additionally, data collection disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic limited the availability of recent socioeconomic indicators, particularly for smaller Caribbean states. As an ecological study, these findings reflect country-level associations and cannot be extrapolated to individual-level patterns, introducing a risk of ecological fallacy. Furthermore, variation in reporting practices across international sources may have introduced additional inconsistencies despite efforts to harmonize data. Conclusions This study concludes that women in the non-Latin Caribbean region face distinct health risks, including higher obesity and diabetes-related mortality compared to men. Gender gaps were also evident in reproductive health, with elevated maternal mortality and adolescent fertility rates in several countries. Although not uniform across the region, principal component analysis showed that nations with weaker reproductive health outcomes clustered together, reflecting shared vulnerabilities. Compared to North America, the Caribbean overall demonstrated a higher chronic disease burden, poorer reproductive health indicators, and lower development scores, underscoring the need for region-specific public health strategies. These findings carry important implications for policy and planning. Leaders must prioritize strategies that address chronic and reproductive health risks among women, with an emphasis on prevention, access, and equity. Expanding maternal health services, reducing adolescent fertility through comprehensive education, and strengthening chronic disease prevention are immediate priorities. Policy gaps identified through the ENLACE tool, particularly in food marketing to children and breastfeeding protections, represent clear opportunities for action. Regional collaboration can support shared policy frameworks and more consistent implementation across countries. By offering one of the most comprehensive cross-country analyses on Caribbean women, this study provides a data-driven foundation for advancing gender-responsive health systems.
