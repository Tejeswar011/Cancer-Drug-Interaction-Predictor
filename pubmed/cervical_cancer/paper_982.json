The key to this convergence lies in the fibroblast, a pivotal driver of disease progression, tissue injury and chronicity. Despite this central pathogenic role and growing recognition as a therapeutic target, effective treatments targeting fibroblasts remain elusive, leaving a critical gap in disease intervention. Methods Here we present a novel approach to target fibrosis using the melanocortin compound BMS-470539 to treat in vitro cultured human dermal fibroblasts obtained from healthy volunteers and systemic sclerosis patients and measuring various markers of senescence and fibroblast activation combining microscopy, DNA sequencing, cell migration and RNA sequencing and PCR techniques. We also used the in vivo bleomycin induced skin fibrosis in mice to determine pre-clinical efficacy of BMS-470539. Results BMS-470539 induced a ‘senescence-like’ state in human dermal fibroblasts from systemic sclerosis patients, characterised by proliferation arrest, lack of pro-inflammatory secretome and inability to induce secondary senescence. This senescence-like activity (accompanied by β-galactosidase activity, lipofuscin accumulation and other markers) resulted in the downregulation of fibrosis markers including ⍺-smooth muscle actin, migration, CCL2 and genes related to TGFβ and fibroblast activation. In vivo, the compound reduced skin thickness on the bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis murine model when administered intraperitoneally, and importantly, this senescence-like activity did not cause signs of fibrosis when administered intradermally. Conclusions Here, we introduce a novel strategy to disarm pathogenic fibroblasts in the context of skin fibrosis using a therapeutic pro-senescence-like approach using the unconventional melanocortin compound BMS-470539, to reset fibroblast behaviour and disrupt disease progression. This work also emphasizes the translational potential of how understanding shared pathogenic mechanisms across diseases may lead to new therapeutic opportunities to manage multiple diseases like arthritis and fibrosis.

For instance, studying the liver in liver fibrosis, and the colon in colon cancer, assuming that pathology begins and ends at the affected site. But this organ-centric model is being fundamentally challenged. Emerging evidence reveals that diseases can originate far from their eventual site of damage, as seen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which may begin in the oral, intestinal, or lung mucosa before reaching the joints [ 1 Beyond redefining disease origins, precision medicine has transformed how we classify and treat conditions. Recognition of disease heterogeneity strongly influences the way we search for novel targets, consisting of searching for ‘ differences within a disease’ 2 similarities across diseases’ 3 4 These new advances in our understanding of pathological systems are transforming our approaches to disease, not only for cancer management but importantly for autoimmune diseases. Shared mechanisms, molecular and cellular, operate across these diseases and taking a holistic approach rather than a disease/organ focus to develop new treatments may lead to new therapeutic innovations. An important advancement towards this approach is exemplified by the Connect Immune Research Consortium [ 5 ® ® More specifically, the concept of the stromal cell as a therapeutic target is an example of how understanding shared cellular mechanisms of disease may help expand the translational opportunities of novel therapeutic interventions. The fibroblast has emerged in recent years as pathogenic driver and hence as a promising cellular target for a wide range of diseases, including RA, fibrosis or cancer, and specific therapeutic strategies are being developed [ 6 8 9 10 11 This shared failure of fibroblasts to switch off offers a shared opportunity to develop innovative interventions that may be applied to a range of diseases. Strategies targeting the fibroblasts [ 6 8 We have previously reported the ability of the small molecule BMS-470539 to target synovial fibroblasts from RA patients [ 12 Here, we propose BMS-470539 as a potential new therapeutic approach to fibrotic diseases and provide further characterization of the actions of this compound, originally described in 2003 as a selective melanocortin 1 receptor (MC 1 13 Methods Primary human dermal fibroblasts Human dermal fibroblasts were obtained from 4 mm skin punch biopsy specimens from the forearm, isolated as described by Shi-Wen et al. 2021 [ 14 2 Chemical compounds and treatments The compounds used in this study were: BMS-470539 - CAS No. 2341796-82-3 (Tocris [for in vitro experiments] and Cayman Chemical [for in vivo experiments ] Lysosomal detection by phase-contrast microscopy Cells were treated with the compounds and over time periods as indicated in each figure legend. At the end of the period, cells were washed in PBS and images acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope and imaged with Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics, USA). The proportion of cells exhibiting a perinuclear ring were quantified. Lysosomal detection by immunofluorescence staining LysoTracker™ (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The culture medium was removed from the cells, which were then washed twice in sterile PBS. The cells (unfixed) were then incubated in LysoTracker™ diluted to 75 nM in complete DMEM and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-βGal) staining The Senescence Detection Kit (Abcam) was used according to manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were fixed with the provided fixative for 15 min. Staining solution containing 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) was then added and cells incubated in sealed plates at 37 °C overnight (~ 16 h). Then, the staining solution was removed, cells washed with PBS and the development of blue colour indicative of SA-βGal activity visualized using a brightfield microscope (EVOS XL Core Imaging System, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Sudan black B (SBB) staining A saturated SBB solution was prepared by dissolving 1.2 g of Sudan black B (Merck) in 80 ml of 70% ethanol [ 15 Immunofluorescence staining in cultured cells Cells were fixed in 4% PFA (Santa Cruz) for 20 min at room temperature before the fixative was removed and the cells washed thrice for 10 min each in PBS. Cells were then incubated in 5% normal goat serum (Abcam) diluted in PBS for 1 h followed by incubation in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed thrice for 10 min each in PBS before incubating in secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The cells were washed twice in PBS for 10 min each, followed by a 10-minute incubation in a 1 µg/ml DAPI solution in PBS (Merck). The cells were then washed for a final 10 min in PBS before visualisation using the EVOS FL Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The primary antibodies used in this study were: anti-MC 1 Immunofluorescence staining in tissues For the detection of MC 1 1 Transfections of HEK293 cells HEK293T (ATCC CRL-3216) cells were maintained in complete DMEM. Cells were transfected with human MC1R MC2R MC3R MC4R MC5R 4 Alamar blue assay Sterile 1X alamar blue reagent was prepared from a 10X stock solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in complete cell culture medium. Cell culture media was removed and replaced with 2 ml of the 1X alamar blue solution in a 6-well plate. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 Cell area quantification Cells were visualised using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope and imaged with Image Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics). For calculating cell size, images were taken at 20X magnifications and cell area quantified using the image processing package Fiji (National Institute of Health). Cell proliferation quantification Cells were treated with the compounds as indicated in each figure legend. At the end of the treatment period, cells were washed in PBS and then detached using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Trypsin was deactivated with the addition of complete DMEM, and the cells in suspension were pelleted by centrifuging at 270 g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 µl sterile PBS. 20 µl of the cell suspension was added to 80 µl Turk’s solution (0.01% Crystal Violet (Sigma) in 3% acetic acid) and 10 µl of this cell suspension loaded into a Neubauer chamber (Marienfeld Superior) to calculate the number of cells per ml. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) The following kits were used according to manufacturer’s instructions: CCL2, IL8 and IL6 uncoated ELISA kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Supernatants used to measure IL6 were diluted 1/10 before use, and supernatants used to measure IL8 and CCL2 were diluted 1/5. Gap closure assay Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 10 4 RNA extraction, real time PCR and primers RNA from cultured cells was extracted using Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep. cDNA was synthesized (1 ug RNA) with SuperScript VILO MasterMix (Invitrogen). Real time-PCR was performed with Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), on the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System. Expression was calculated as 2 −ΔΔCt HPRT1 HPRT1 CDKN1A CDKN2A Whole genome RNA sequencing and functional analysis RNA was extracted from cultured cells as described above, and samples sent to UCL Genomics (London, UK) to undergo bulk RNA sequencing. Samples were processed with Kapa mRNA HyperPrep kit (Roche) to create stranded libraries. Sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina), using an S1 flow-cell and 100 cycle SBS sequencing kit. Fastq files were analysed using Partek Flow Genomic Analysis Software (release no. 10.0.23.0720). Reads were aligned to the human genome hg38 using STAR 2.7.8a. Quantification to transcriptome was conducted using assembly Homo sapiens (human) hg38, annotation model RefSeq Transcripts 93 (2020-02-03). Transcript quantification was conducted with TPM normalisation method. Differentially expressed genes were obtained by comparing BMS-470539 treated with vehicle control treated, using a p Genomic DNA extraction Genomic (g)DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s advised protocol. The gDNA was eluted in 150 µl of RNase/DNase-free water. Quantity (ng/µl) and quality of the collected gDNA was measured using a NanoDrop™ 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

All experimental protocols complied with the relevant ethical regulations and were conducted under the Project Licence (PPL) PBA1ECDE5, using C57BL/6J mice purchased from Charles River. Female mice were used to better reflect the distribution of scleroderma in the human population, with a female to male ratio around 4:1. Animal studies using Mc1r e/e Bleomycin-induced skin fibrosis murine model To induce skin fibrosis, mice were injected intradermally with 50 µl of either 1 mg/ml (equal to 1 unit) of bleomycin or vehicle control (saline) into a single 1 cm 2 At day 28, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. 6 mm punch biopsies were collected from the fibrotic lesions. Livers, kidneys and spleens were also collected for additional histological analyses. Cardiac punctures were undertaken on freshly sacrificed mice to obtain whole blood samples. Histological analyses Tissues for histological analyses were fixed in 4% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Tissues were kindly embedded and sectioned at 5 μm thickness at the Barts Cancer Institute Pathology Services. Sections were deparaffinised in Histoclear II followed by decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100 − 50%) and then rehydrated in distilled water. For H&E staining, the sections were incubated in haematoxylin solution (Sigma) for 5 min, rinsed in running tap water and then counterstained with Eosin Y solution (Sigma) for 3 min. Stained sections were dehydrated and then mounted in Entrellan™ rapid mounting medium (Sigma) using 24 × 24 mm coverslips (VWR) and left to cure overnight. For picro sirius red staining and Masson’s trichrome staining, picro sirius Red Stain Kit (Abcam) and Trichrome Stain kit (Abcam), respectively, were used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Stained slides were imaged using a NanoZoomer S210 Digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu). Analysis of murine whole blood samples Blood was obtained from cardiac puncture and aliquots (30 µl) were analysed using a ProCyte Dx Haematology Analyzer (IDEXX) to quantify white blood cell, reticulocyte and red blood cell counts.

Alpha-smooth muscle actin (⍺SMA) is one of the most important markers of myofibroblast differentiation and it is associated with fibroblasts contractile ability. In the SSc cohort of fibroblasts used in this study, approximately 15% of cells on average exhibited prominent ⍺SMA expression (Fig. 3 3 3 4 4  Fig. 3 In vitro anti-fibrotic activity of BMS-470539 on cultured human dermal fibroblasts.

Briefly, 50 µl of 1 mg/ml bleomycin solution was injected intradermally every other day from day 1 to day 27, and mice sacrificed at day 28. BMS-470539 was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) from day 15, once fibrosis had been established.

A n Discussion Despite human knowledge growing at an exponential rate driven by advances in science and technology, this is not resulting in an exponential increase in therapeutic solutions reaching patients. A total of 38 new drugs were approved by the FDA in 1999, while only 55 in 2023, a small improvement in a quarter of a century [ 23 24 ® ® 25 26 27 10 28 29 Understanding context-dependent differences is important to fully exploit the therapeutic benefit of complex interventions. This is particularly relevant when proposing the process of cellular senescence as a therapeutic strategy, as growing evidence suggests that this may be beneficial or detrimental depending on the pathophysiological context [ 30 31 12 32 33 34 30 We previously reported that induction of a senescence-like phenotype on synovial cells improved arthritis. Here, using the same molecule, BMS-470539, we show the translational potential of this process in the context of skin fibrosis. We were able to recapitulate a similar phenotype in both healthy and scleroderma derived dermal fibroblasts, where the addition of this compound was associated with several markers of senescence like reduced proliferation, increased lysosomal accumulation and increased expression of SA-βGal and lipofuscin accumulation. A distinctive and relevant distinctive feature of BMS-470539 senescence-like activity was the lack of pro-inflammatory SASP, a common characteristic of senescent cells. The release of a SASP by senescent cells is believed to play an important role in flagging the presence of these cells to induce their own clearance by the immune system [ 35 36 37 Having characterised the unique features of these senescence-like actions on dermal fibroblasts, we then aimed at addressing the potential of this compound as an anti-fibrotic molecule. Using in vitro cultured cells, we show that BMS-470539 reduced the expression of ⍺SMA, slowed down the closure of the gap on a scratch assay and downregulated biological processes like angiogenesis, integrin signalling or cell migration among others, addressed using a whole genome transcriptomic approach. Specific genes include cell cycle regulators ( CDK1 CENPF CDC27 ACTA2 CNN2 TPM2 TGFB1I1 GDF6 P4HA1 38 In certain contexts, the presence or the accumulation of senescent cells has been suggested to be responsible, at least in part, for causing fibrosis [ 39 40 41 44 45 39 46 Of relevance from the therapeutic translational perspective, we did not observe any signs of toxicity on internal organs at microscopic level after prolonged administration of BMS-470539 for up to two weeks. We did not find either evidence of loss of activity on fibroblasts from patients carrying MC1R 47 1 8 48 1 49 1 1 In conclusion, we provide evidence that the senescence-like actions of the compound BMS-470539 could be beneficial in settings of fibrosis by preventing fibroblasts proliferation and activation without the toxicity derived from a pro-inflammatory SASP, as typical pro-senescence drugs do. Some aspects remain to be known, like for example, whether a combination with senolytic drugs will further enhance the in vivo efficacy of BMS-470539, how the anti-inflammatory actions derived directly from MC 1 Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
