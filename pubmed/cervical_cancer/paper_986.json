Here, we review the diverse impacts of KMT5a activity on human cancer development and progression. First, KMT5a is the only Mammalian enzyme that specifically induces monomethylation of histone 4 (H4) on lysine 20, thus regulating chromatin organization and, in turn, the transcription of several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. KMT5a, by inducing H4 methylation, also critically establishes the choice between different pathways of DNA double-strand break repair, with important consequences for genomic instability and cancer origin. Finally, KMT5a also methylates lysine residues on nonhistone proteins, and KMT5a-induced methylation of key oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins, including TP53, strongly affects cancer cell functions. Overall, KMT5a is overexpressed in a high percentage and wide variety of human cancers and has protumorigenic activity, which makes it a target for innovative therapy.

KMT5a also regulates a broad spectrum of other human physiological and pathological processes, as briefly summarized in Table 1 1 Table 1 Role of KMT5a in physiological and pathological processes beyond oncogenesis Erythroid cell maturation KMT5a lowers the levels of GATA-2, helping red blood cells to develop and survive properly Ref.

[ 8 Aging Age-related inflammation suppresses KMT5a expression, leading to epigenetic silencing of anti-ferroptosis genes and causing dysregulated iron metabolism, elevated ROS levels, and lipid peroxidation in aged muscle stem cells Ref. [ 9 KMT5a is the only mammalian enzyme that specifically induces monomethylation of H4 on lysine 20 (H4K20 me1 10 me1 11 12 KMT5a activity predominantly mediates transcriptional repression.

KMT5a expression is regulated by several microRNAs (miRNAs), whereas KMT5a protein levels are regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligases CRL4 Cdt2 β−TRCP 20 21 22 24 1 12 25 This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the multifaceted roles of KMT5a in cancer biology by combining evidence on its context-specific transcriptional outputs, its dual activity as a histone and nonhistone methyltransferase, and its regulation by noncoding RNAs. Importantly, we highlight how KMT5a orchestrates diverse oncogenic processes, including metabolic reprogramming, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, stemness, and DNA repair. In summary, KMT5a is as a central epigenetic regulator of oncogenesis and a highly attractive target for therapeutic intervention. KMT5a-mediated H4K20 methylation regulates the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors KMT5a-induced H4K20 methylation regulates the expression of several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes [ 25 2 Table 2 Genes whose expression, regulated by KMT5a, has protumorigenic effects Transcriptional target Outcome Described in References Inhibition of DUSP10 expression Upregulation of the MAPK-induced proliferation and survival pathway Pancreatic cancer (cell lines, surgical specimens, ectopic mice) [ 26 Inhibition of RADD expression Suppression of ferroptosis Pancreatic cancer (cell lines, surgical specimens) [ 27 Inhibition of TP53 and KIAA1324 expression Downregulation of tumor suppressor proteins Endometrial cancer (cell lines, surgical specimens) [ 29 Activation of CDC20, of vimentin and of androgen-induced transcription expression; inhibition of E-cadherin expression Induction of proliferation and epithelial–mesenchymal transition Prostate cancer (cell lines) [ 31 32 38 Activation of Wnt5a expression Upregulation of an oncogenic protein Acute myeloid leukemia (primary cells collected from bone marrow) [ 33 Inhibition of E-cadherin expression; activation of N-cadherin expression Epithelial–mesenchymal transition Breast cancer (cell lines, surgical specimens, orthotopic mice) [ 36 inhibition of E-cadherin expression Epithelial–mesenchymal transition Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (cell lines, surgical specimens) [ 37 Activation of vimentin expression Epithelial–mesenchymal transition Osteosarcoma (cell lines, surgical specimens) [ 39 Activation of HIF1a expression Glycolysis promotion Colorectal cancer (cell lines, ectopic mice); breast cancer (cell lines, surgical specimens) [ 40 41 Inhibition of FBP1 expression Gluconeogenesis inhibition Breast cancer (cell lines, surgical specimens) [ 42 Activation of OXCT1 expression Glycolysis promotion Breast cancer (cell lines, surgical specimens, organoids, ectopic mice) [ 43 Inhibition of SIRT4 expression Glycolysis promotion Hepatocellular carcinoma (cell lines, ectopic mice) [ 44 Activation of SREBP1 expression Lipid biosynthesis promotion Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (cell lines, surgical specimens, ectopic mice); papillary thyroid carcinoma (cell lines, surgical specimens) [ 47 48 Activation of osteopontin expression; inhibition of HES-1 expression Neo-angiogenesis promotion Normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells [ 49 Activation of ROR1 expression Cell stemness promotion Pancreatic cancer (cell lines, surgical specimens) [ 51 Cell proliferation and survival KMT5a is overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and higher KMT5a levels are correlated with poor prognosis [ 26 26 27 26 KMT5a is also frequently overexpressed in high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOCs) [ 28 me1 In endometrial cancer cells, KMT5a downregulates the expression of TP53 and of another tumor suppressor gene, KIAA1324, via H4K20 methylation of their promoter regions [ 29 30 Prostate cancer cell treatment with the androgen receptor (AR) agonist dihydrotestosterone results in H4K20 me1 31 me1 32 In acute myeloid leukemia patients, the levels of KMT5a-induced H4K20 me1 33 34 35 Collectively, these findings demonstrate that KMT5a is recurrently overexpressed in multiple cancer types, where it exerts oncogenic functions primarily through epigenetic modulation of gene expression. By regulating the transcription of key oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, KMT5a facilitates tumor progression via multiple mechanisms, including the activation of proliferative and prometastatic signaling cascades, and the suppression of programmed cell death pathways, such as apoptosis and ferroptosis. Epithelial–mesenchymal transition and cell adhesion In breast and prostate cancer cells, KMT5a regulates the transcription of genes involved not only in cell proliferation and survival but also in epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell adhesion. In breast cancer cells, the transcription factor TWIST recruits KMT5a to cadherin gene promoters, which results in E-cadherin transcriptional suppression and N-cadherin transcriptional activation [ 36 KMT5a also reduces E-cadherin expression in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) [ 37 In prostate cancer cells, in cooperation with the transcription factor ZEB1, KMT5a-induced H4K20 methylation results not only in E-cadherin promoter repression but also in vimentin promoter activation [ 38 39 Overall, by modulating gene expression, KMT5a activity induces the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and migration of cancer cells. Glucose metabolism and glycolysis KMT5a-regulated transcription is key for adjusting glucose metabolism in cancer cells. By upregulating the HIF1a/H2 axis, KMT5a promotes the glycolysis and growth of colorectal cancer cells [ 40 In breast cancer cells, KMT5a stimulates HIF1a transcriptional activity on several promoters of glycolytic genes, including hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2 [ 41 42 43 In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), KMT5a also sustains aerobic glycolysis and anabolic growth. In this case, however, KMT5a reprograms metabolism by repressing the expression of SIRT4, an inhibitor of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex inhibitor [ 44 45 46 Overall, KMT5a-regulated transcription induces a switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, a metabolic reprogramming critical for the survival of rapidly proliferating tumor cells. Lipid metabolism KMT5a regulates not only glucose metabolism but also lipid metabolism in cancer cells. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines, KMT5a is posttranslationally stabilized by the deubiquitinase USP17, which leads to the upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). This, in turn, promotes the lipid biosynthesis characteristic of ccRCC and enhances the proliferation and migration of ccRCC cells [ 47 47 The effects of KMT5a on lipid metabolism have also been confirmed in papillary thyroid cancer cells, where KMT5a inhibition suppresses the expression of SREBP1 and of other key proteins involved in lipid metabolism, such as fatty acid synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase [ 48 Angiogenesis KMT5a-regulated transcription plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis [ 49 49 Cancer stem cell maintenance Therapies often fail and tumors relapse because cancer stem cells (CSCs) are more resistant than differentiated tumor cells [ 50 Notably, KMT5a activity is essential for epidermal stem cell survival, and KMT5a overexpression has been associated with cancer stemness-related gene expression in epithelial tumors, such as gastric and lung cancers [ 5 6 22 23 51 + + 23 The evidence that KMT5a-deficient mice spontaneously develop hepatocellular carcinoma with cancer stem cell proprieties only apparently contradicts the above data [ 52 25 In summary, KMT5a, which is often overexpressed in both solid and hematological human cancers, represses the transcription of several tumor suppressor genes, including TP53. Although, as discussed above, KMT5a-induced H4 methylation is key for compacting chromatin and inhibiting transcription, in most of the tumors investigated, KMT5a has also been shown to induce the transcription of many oncogenes. The molecular mechanisms presumably vary, as H4K20 me1 In contrast with the predominantly oncogenic functions of KMT5a reported in other cancers, a unique tumor suppressor role for KMT5a has been found in patients with mesothelioma with BAP-1 mutations [ 53 me1 me3 me1 KMT5a-mediated H4K20 methylation regulates DNA repair The role of KMT5a in DNA damage repair has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere, and the reader is referred to that work for further detail [ 25 25 54 25 55 25 56 57 25 58 59 60 Regardless of the underlying mechanism, we recently reported that the role of KMT5a in regulating DNA damage repair can be targeted in glioblastoma [ 61 62 In summary, the role of KMT5a in promoting DNA repair suggests that it may be a potential target in cancer therapy. KMT5a-mediated methylation of oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins As described above, KMT5a methylates not only H4 but also nonhistone proteins, many of which play a driver role in cancer development and progression (Table 3 Table 3 Effects of KMT5a-induced lysine (K) methylation on cancer proteins Substrate Outcome Described in References TP53 (K382) Inhibition of TP53 tumor suppressing functions Teratocarcinoma (cell lines); colorectal cancer (cell lines, primary cells, tissue specimens, ectopic and orthotopic mice); neuroblastoma (cell lines, ectopic mice) [ 63 66 Numb (K158 and K163) TP53 degradation Breast cancer (cell lines) [ 67 PCNA (K248) Cell proliferation HeLa cervical cancer cells [ 68 SNIP (K301) Cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis Triple-negative breast cancer (cell lines, tissue specimens, orthotopic and tail vein injected mice) [ 69 c-MYC (K412) c-MYC protein stabilization Bladder cancer (cell lines, tissue specimens, ectopic mice) [ 70 CD147 (K234) glycolysis and cell survival Non-small cell lung cancer (cell lines, tissue specimens, ectopic mice) [ 71 A remarkable substrate of KMT5a methyltransferase activity is indeed TP53. KMT5a methylates TP53 at lysine 382 (TP53K382 me1 63 64 A recent study demonstrated that the cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1, which are secreted by C1Q + + 65 me1 me1 UNC0379 is also effective in a xenograft neuroblastoma mouse model. Experiments in neuroblastoma cell lines have demonstrated that KMT5a pharmacological inhibition reduces cell growth, by lowering TP53K382 me1 66 The effects of KMT5a lysine methyltransferase activity on TP53 are both direct and indirect. KMT5a can induce TP53 degradation by methylating Numb [ 67 The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein is methylated by KMT5a at lysine 248 [ 68 KMT5a-mediated monomethylation of Smad nuclear-interacting protein 1 (SNIP1) at lysine 301 promotes triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell growth, invasion and metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model [ 69 In bladder cancer cell lines, KMT5a was recently shown to methylate c-MYC at lysine 412, resulting in c-MYC protein stabilization [ 70 In small cell lung cancers, dimethylation of the tumor-associated, cell metabolism-regulating protein CD147 at lysine 234 enhances glycolysis and the survival of cancer cells [ 71 me2 Overall, KMT5a-induced methylation enhances the activity of oncogenic proteins and inhibits the function of tumor suppressor proteins, strongly suggesting that KMT5a inhibition can be highly effective in cancers driven by mutations in KMT5a substrates. MicroRNA-mediated regulation of KMT5a expression in cancer A single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs16917496, CC genotype) within the miR-502 binding region in the 3'-UTR of the KMT5a gene has been associated with reduced KMT5a expression. This polymorphism has been largely investigated in cancer patients with sometimes contradictory, probably not conclusive, results [ 72 73 81 82 85 76 86 KMT5a expression levels are positively correlated with those of the lncRNA XLOC_006390 in cervical cancer; however, no formal evidence has been provided to demonstrate that KMT5a is a direct target of this lncRNA [ 87 In breast cancer cells, KMT5a expression is directly downregulated by miR-335. Importantly, miR-335-induced KMT5a depletion enhances the sensitivity of resistant breast cancer cells to paclitaxel [ 88 89 90 36 89 91 KMT5a is directly downregulated by miR-382 in glioma cells and by miR-217 and miRNA-384 in osteosarcoma cells, resulting in the inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion [ 92 95 KMT5a expression is downregulated by miR-340-5p in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The axis of miR-340-5p/KMT5a is critical for regulating the number and function of CD8 + + + 96 In gastric cancer cell lines, KMT5a is directly downregulated by miR-192/215. In gastric cancer KMT5a might have tumor suppressor activity. KMT5a knockdown promotes the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells. Moreover, KMT5a levels were found to be lower in gastric tumors than in normal, paracancerous, gastric tissues through the analysis of a tissue microarray containing samples collected from 90 patients who underwent surgery without prior radiotherapy or chemotherapy [ 97 98 Overall, the regulation of KMT5a expression by different miRNAs in different tumor types adds another layer of difficulty in generalizing the functions of KMT5a in cancer. However, most of these studies confirm a protumorigenic role for KMT5a, as, in most of the cases, KMT5a downregulation by miRNAs results in the inhibition of cancer cell fitness (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Negative regulation of KMT5a gene expression by various miRNAs in different types of cancer. In most cases, miRNA-mediated downregulation of KMT5a leads to reduced cancer cell viability and impaired tumor progression Targeting KMT5a in cancer: development of small-molecule inhibitors In all the studies discussed in this review, KMT5a activity has been effectively inhibited in both cellular and animal models via UNC0379. UNC0379 was identified in 2014 as a selective KMT5a inhibitor through screening of a quinazoline-based compound library. UNC0379 inhibited KMT5a at an inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) of 7.3 ± 1.0 μM. Mechanistic studies revealed a competitive mode of inhibition with the H4 peptide substrate and a noncompetitive interaction with the S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) cofactor. The compound demonstrated selectivity for KMT5a over 15 other methyltransferases, including G9a and GLP [ 99 100 101 In addition to UNC0379 and its derivatives, the repertoire of available KMT5a inhibitors remains restricted, with only a limited subset demonstrating appreciable target selectivity. H Acid and thymolphthalein were first identified as inhibitors of KMT5a in 2007. Both compounds demonstrated low median IC₅₀ values against KMT5a (3.8 μM and 9.0 μM, respectively) and against EZH2 (3.0 μM and 25.2 μM, respectively). When evaluated in human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, H Acid had no detectable effect on cell proliferation at concentrations up to 500 μM, likely due to poor cellular permeability. In contrast, thymolphthalein strongly reduces cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and significantly decreases the global level of histone H4K20 me1 me3 102 In 2011, Kodama et al. carried out a structure-based virtual screening of approximately two million compounds utilizing the crystallographic structure of KMT5a. Among the top candidates identified, three compounds (EBI-099, EBI-435, and EBI-455) exhibited significant inhibitory activity in vitro. Notably, EBI-099 inhibited KMT5a enzymatic activity with an IC₅₀ of 4.7 μM, demonstrated high target selectivity by showing no inhibitory effect on G9a, and induced antiproliferative effects in K562 human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells [ 102 In 2012, Mai et al. synthesized a series of bis(bromo- and dibromomethoxyphenol) derivatives and investigated their inhibitory activity against multiple lysine methyltransferases. Among the compounds tested, the bis(dibromo) derivatives MC1946 and MC1948 selectively inhibited KMT5a, whereas the bis(monobromo) analogs MC1947 and MC2569 exhibited dual inhibitory activity against both KMT5a and EZH2. All the active compounds featured an electrophilic α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety, indicative of a potential covalent mechanism of enzyme inhibition, although this hypothesis has not been mechanistically validated. Importantly, MC1947 also exerts significant cytotoxic effects in cellular models [ 102 In 2013, Andersen et al. reported, following the screening of a library of marine natural products, the identification of nahuoic acid A, a polyketide isolated from marine-derived Streptomyces 103 104 In 2014, Luo et al. conducted a high-throughput scintillation proximity assay screening of over 5,000 commercially available compounds, resulting in the discovery of three potent KMT5a inhibitors, SPS8I1 (NSC663284), SPS8I2 (BVT948), and SPS8I3 (ryuvidine), with IC₅₀ values of 0.21, 0.50, And 0.70 μM, respectively [ 105 me1 Although multiple small-molecule inhibitors of KMT5a have been identified, UNC0379 has emerged as crucial for functional studies [ 25 UNC0379 was primarily developed as a tool compound for preclinical research and has not advanced into clinical trials, unlike other epigenetic-targeting agents. This is largely due to its suboptimal pharmacological properties, including poor aqueous solubility. Furthermore, data on its bioavailability and metabolic stability are currently lacking. Despite these limitations, the frequent overexpression of KMT5a in various human malignancies suggests KMT5a levels as a potential, predictive biomarker for KMT5a-targeted therapies. Notably, recent findings indicate that tumors characterized by elevated rates of ribosome biogenesis exhibit increased sensitivity to KMT5a inhibition [ 106 Conclusions Limitations and controversies KMT5a-induced H4K20 me1 However, notable exceptions to the oncogenic role of KMT5a have been described. In BAP1-mutant mesothelioma, KMT5a exerts tumor-suppressive effects by attenuating EZH2 overexpression and inhibiting cellular proliferation. In gastric cancer, the role of KMT5a appears more complex and context specific: While some studies have reported that KMT5a has tumor-suppressive activity, others have associated high KMT5a expression with poor prognosis. These discrepancies suggest that KMT5a function may be modulated by tumor stage, molecular subtype, or the tumor microenvironment and highlight the need for further investigation. Despite these exceptions, KMT5a is frequently overexpressed across a wide range of cancers, with elevated expression levels generally correlating with poor clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, KMT5a has not yet been explored clinically as a biomarker for patient stratification. Furthermore, the therapeutic targeting of KMT5a remains in a preclinical phase. UNC0379, the most widely utilized KMT5a inhibitor, has limited drug-like properties, including poor aqueous solubility and a lack of data on its bioavailability and metabolic stability, which has hindered its clinical development. Other candidate inhibitors (such as H Acid, EBI derivatives, and the SPS8I series) suffer from low selectivity, off-target effects, and poor cellular permeability. Therefore, realizing the full translational potential of KMT5a as a cancer therapeutic target will require the development of next-generation inhibitors with improved pharmacological profiles, as well as the identification of robust biomarkers to guide patient selection and stratification. Future prospects KMT5a is as a critical epigenetic regulator involved in multiple oncogenic processes, including transcriptional regulation, the DNA damage response, and the maintenance of cancer stem cells (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Roles of KMT5a in cancer cells In cancer cells, KMT5a-mediated H4 methylation can either induce or repress transcription, depending on the genomic and/or the cellular context. KMT5a-induced H4 methylation also regulates DNA damage repair, orchestrating the choice between different DNA repair pathways, and the expression of cancer stemness-associated genes. Moreover, KMT5a directly methylates several nonhistone proteins, with overall protumorigenic effects. Future research efforts should focus on the development of next-generation KMT5a inhibitors with improved potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties. Advancing toward such compounds is essential for translating KMT5a inhibition into the clinic. In addition to drug development, biomarker-driven approaches are crucial for identifying patient subsets most likely to respond to KMT5a-targeted therapies. Emerging evidence suggests that tumors characterized by increased ribosome biogenesis, elevated KMT5a expression, or increased H4K20 me1 Combination therapies are also anticipated to enhance treatment efficacy and overcome resistance mechanisms. Preclinical studies indicate potential synergy between KMT5a inhibitors and other epigenetic modulators (such as EZH2, G9a, or HDAC inhibitors), DNA damage response inhibitors (including ATR, CHK1, or Wee1 inhibitors), and agents targeting cancer stem cell maintenance pathways. Dual inhibition of KMT5a alongside other histone methyltransferases, such as EZH2 or G9a, may effectively abrogate compensatory methylation at alternative histone lysine residues, thereby reinforcing transcriptional repression and epigenetic silencing of oncogenic pathways [ 107 108 109 59 110 me1 Additionally, deeper mechanistic insights into the interplay between KMT5a and other histone modifications, as well as the identification of novel nonhistone substrates, will expand our understanding of the oncogenic functions of KMT5a. Given its role in sustaining cancer cell stemness, targeting KMT5a may also contribute to reducing therapy resistance and tumor recurrence, thereby supporting its inclusion in future combination treatment regimens. In conclusion, KMT5a has oncogenic functions in multiple cancer types. Its dual activity on histone and nonhistone substrates drives tumor progression, making it a compelling target for therapeutic intervention. The development of selective and drug-like KMT5a inhibitors, along with biomarker-guided strategies, will be essential to unlock their full clinical potential.
