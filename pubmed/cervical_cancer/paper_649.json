However, its influence on sprout production or health-related attributes has not yet been investigated. Therefore, in this study, corn sprouts were used as the raw material to compare the differential health effects of SMF treatment in a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effects of SMF-treated corn sprouts were assessed by analyzing changes in their active ingredients. Histological staining, qRT-PCR and 16s rDNA sequencing were performed in the DSS-induced colitis mouse model. The results indicated that dietary fiber and total phenol contents were significantly higher in SMF-treated corn sprouts (M-CSP) compared to SMF-untreated corn sprouts (C-CSP). M-CSP alleviated the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis, significantly reduced colonic epithelial damage, and suppressed the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. In addition, M-CSP markedly improved the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota. These findings provide new insights for the development and application of SMF technology to functional food ingredients. static magnetic field corn sprouts ulcerative colitis anti-inflammation gut microbiota National Key R&D Program of China 2022YFF1100205 Funding for this study was provided by National Key R&D Program of China (2022YFF1100205). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Sprouts, plant-based foods rich in nutrients and bioactive components, have received widespread attention in the food and health fields in recent years. Among these, corn sprouts, a nutrient-rich vegetable resource, have attracted considerable attention because of their high contents of carotenoids, total phenols, free phenols, and binding phenols [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 SMF treatment has been widely used as a physical method to improve plant germination, growth, and development. Recent studies have reported that appropriate SMF treatment increases germination rates in flaxseeds [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 Ulcerative Colitis (UC), a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) alongside Crohn’s disease (CD) [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Our previous study reported that SMF treatment increases endogenous enzyme activity in corn sprouts and enhances the antioxidant activity of dietary fiber [ 12 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Preparation of M-CSP and Static Magnetic Field-Untreated Corn Sprouts (C-CSP) M-CSP was prepared according to a previously reported methodology [ 12 2.2. Determination of the Bioactive Components in Corn Sprouts The nutritional components of corn sprouts, including protein, fat, moisture, ash, dietary fiber, soluble sugar and starch were analyzed in accordance with the following Chinese national standards: GB 5009.5-2016, GB 5009.6-2016, GB 5009.3-2016, GB 5009.4-2016, GB 5009.88-2014, GB/T 37493-2019 and GB 5009.9-2023 [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 2 3 2.3. Construction and Treatment of DSS Twenty-four male C57BL/6N mice (18 ± 2 g body weight) were obtained from Viton Lever Laboratory Animals Ltd. (Beijing, China). Mice were maintained in a pathogen-free environment on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. All experiments complied with national guidelines “Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals.” The experiments were approved by the Use Committee of the Jilin Academy of Chinese Medicine Sciences (JLSZKYDWLL2023-057). After seven days of acclimatization, the mice were randomly assigned to four groups: Con, DSS, C-CSP, and M-CSP ( n Table S1 2.4. Evaluation of Disease Activity Index (DAI) Daily weight loss, fecal morphology, and occult blood were recorded. The DAI was calculated according to the evaluation criteria and formulas, with the scoring criteria shown in Table S2 (1) D A I S c o r e = B o d y  W e i g h t  L o s s  S c o r e + f e c a l  m o r p h o l o g y  S c o r e + F e c a l  B l o o d  S c o r e       2.5. Evaluation of Organ Index The organs were weighed to calculate the corresponding organ indices. The following formula was used to compute the organ index. (2) O r g a n  i n d e x ( m g / g ) = ( O r g a n  w e i g h t × 1000 ) / w e i g h t ( g ) 2.6. Histopathological Analysis Colon tissues were extracted from physiological vials containing paraformaldehyde. The mixture was washed with flowing water for 5 h. Cut tissues were subjected to sectioning, xylene washing, ethanol gradient dehydration, and wax dipping. Tissue sections were processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Histological changes in the H&E-stained sections were assessed and imaged using the NIS-ELEMENTS BR Imaging Analysis System (Tokyo, Japan). Histological damage to the colonic tissue was assessed based on inflammation, mucosal damage, degree of glandular damage, and the extent of the affected area ( Table S3 29 2.7. Determination of Pro- and Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines in Colon Tissues ELISA kits (Shanghai Enzyme Linked Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) were used to measure the amounts of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-1β. Blood samples were stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C overnight, coagulated, and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C (HC-3618R High-Speed Refrigerated Centrifuge, Hefei, China), followed by ELISA analysis using the top layer of serum. 2.8. Determination of Nitric Oxide (NO) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) in Colon Tissues To prepare colon tissue homogenate, murine colon tissue was collected and weighed, then combined with PBS at a 1:9 w/v (3) N O μ m o l g p r o t = A 2 − A 0 A 1 − A 0 × C s × N ÷ C p r A 0 A 1 A 2 Cs N C pr (4) M D A n m o l m g p r o t = A 2 − A 0 A 1 − A 0 × C S × N A 0 A 1 A 2 Cs N 2.9. Determination of Serum Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) Serum samples were diluted to 1:15 in PBS prior to analysis. Serum SOD levels were measured using a commercial detection kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China).

Next, the Prime Script RT reagent kit (Takara, Japan) was used to synthesize complementary cDNA, and the obtained cDNA was stored at −20 °C. After setting up the real-time fluorescent reaction mixture, the cDNA was amplified by PCR (Eppendorf ® Table S4 2.11. High-Throughput Sequencing of Fecal 16s rDNA in Mice Mouse fecal colony DNA was extracted using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Hilden, Germany). After DNA extraction, the concentration and purity of the DNA were evaluated using a NanoDrop apparatus (Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencing system, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). PCR was performed to amplify the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene (Bio-Rad T100 Gradient Thermal Cycler, Hercules, CA, USA). Sequencing was conducted by Tianjin Novogene Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China) using the Novaseq-PE250 platform. 2.12. Statistical Analysis All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.0.0 GraphPad software. Statistical significance among groups was compared via either Student’s t p 3. Results 3.1. Effects of SMF Treatment on Bioactive Components in Corn Sprouts The effects of SMF treatment on the bioactive components of corn sprouts are shown in Table 1 3.2. Effect of M-CSP on Clinical Symptoms in DSS Mice The ameliorative effect of M-CSP on colitis was evaluated in a mouse model of DSS-induced UC. As shown in Figure 1 p p Figure 1 Figure 1 As shown in Figure 1 p p 3.3. Effect of M-CSP on Histologic Changes in DSS Mice Changes in immune organ indices indirectly reflect the degree of inflammatory reactions. As shown in Table 2 p 30 p Colitis is associated with significant mucosal damage, decreased goblet cell counts, and inflammation. The colonic mucosa of mice in the Con group was intact, with a flat surface, no villi, an orderly arrangement of glandular cells, moderate crypt depth, and no inflammatory edema or lesions. After DSS induction, the colonic mucosa of the mice showed irregularity; the intestinal wall was thinned; the lesions infiltrated the muscularis propria; most areas exhibited loss of glands, crypt structure, and cup cells; and the intestinal tissues showed obvious swelling ( Figure 1 Figure 1 p 3.4. Effects of M-CSP on Oxidative Stress-Related Indices and Inflammatory Factors in DSS Mice Excessive oxidative stress is associated with cellular damage [ 31 Figure 2 p Table S5 p Table S5 p Table S5 p IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine whose production reduces by worsening inflammation. IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α are pro-inflammatory cytokines highly produced in UC, exacerbating inflammation. As depicted in Figure 3 p Table S6 p Table S6 3.5. Effect of M-CSP on Myeloperoxidase (MPO), COX-2 and iNOS mRNA Expression Activated NF-κb promotes transcriptional upregulation of several genes involved in almost every aspect of immune response, including iNOS and COX-2 [ 32 Figure 4 p p p 3.6. Effect of M-CSP on the NF-κb Signaling Pathway The NF-κb pathway plays a vital role in the pathogenesis and progression of IBD [ 33 34 Figure 4 p p p 3.7. Effect of M-CSP on Intestinal Barrier Integrity in DSS Mice Decrease in tight junction proteins increases the risk of colitis [ 35 Figure 5 p p 3.8. Effects of M-CSP on Gut Microbiota Composition in DSS Mice UC development is closely related to imbalance in the intestinal microbiota.

Discussion During germination, seeds utilize starch and other dry matter to fuel growth and activate metabolic pathways that synthesize and integrate complex carbohydrates, such as cellulose and hemicellulose, into new cell walls, thereby increasing dietary fiber content [ 36 37 38 39 40 Using a mouse model of colitis to validate its efficacy, we observed that M-CSP played an important role in intestinal health. SMF treatment improved the nutritional quality of corn sprouts by elevating dietary fiber and polyphenol content, which were strongly associated with the health improvements observed in mice. Related studies have shown that foods rich in dietary fibers and polyphenolic compounds may reduce the incidence of colitis [ 41 42 43 44 12 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota is integral to UC pathogenesis [ 54 55 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Escherichia-Shigella Enterobacter Aspergillus phyla 56 Escherichia-Shigella Aspergillus phyla Escherichia-Shigella Bacteroides 57 58 Blautia 59 Akkermansia 60 61 Akkermansia 62 Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group 5. Conclusions In this study, compared with C-CSP, M-CSP exhibited a higher content of dietary fiber and polyphenols which contributed to more effective protection against UC. The beneficial effects included preventing weight loss, maintaining intestinal tissue structure, protecting the intestinal barrier from damage, and modulating inflammatory cytokines. M-CSP maintained intestinal homeostasis and enhanced intestinal function by regulating intestinal microbiota. This study examined the effects of M-CSP on colitis and established the foundation for the development of functional foods for UC treatment.
