It is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, glucotoxicity) and considered a major risk factor for the development of metabolic complications. Their convergence constitutes “diabesity”, representing a major challenge for public health worldwide. Limited treatment efficacy highlights the need for novel, multi-targeted therapies. Non-shivering thermogenesis (NST), mediated by brown and beige adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, has emerged as a promising therapy due to its capacity to increase energy expenditure and improve metabolic health. Also, skeletal muscle plays a central role in glucose uptake and lipid oxidation, further highlighting its relevance in diabesity. This review explores current and emerging knowledge on physiological stimuli, including cold exposure, physical activity, and fasting, as well as bioactive ingredients and drugs that stimulate NST in thermogenic tissues. Special emphasis is placed on melatonin as a potential regulator of mitochondrial function and energy balance. The literature search was conducted using MEDLINE and Web of Science. Studies were selected based on scientific relevance, novelty, and mechanistic insight; prioritizing human and high-quality rodent research published in peer-reviewed journals. Evidence shows that multiple interventions enhance NST, leading to improved glucose metabolism, reduced fat accumulation, and increased energy expenditure in humans and/or rodents. Melatonin, in particular, shows promise in modulating thermogenesis through organelle-molecular pathways and mitochondrial protective effects. In conclusion, a multi-target approach through the activation of NST by physiological, nutritional, and pharmacological agents offers an effective and safe treatment for diabesity. Further research is needed to confirm these effects in clinical practice and support their use as effective therapeutic strategies. obesity diabetes mellitus type 2 thermogenesis adipose tissue brown muscle skeletal food bioactive ingredients melatonin cold exposure exercise fasting MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/ ERDF EU PID 2021-125900OB-I00 This research was supported by grant PID 2021-125900OB-I00 funded by MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033/ and ERDF, EU. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Modern lifestyle trends in our current society, characterized by abundant calorie intake, lower levels of physical activity, and longer life expectancy, have contributed to a higher prevalence of obesity (mainly associated with visceral fat accumulation), propelling it to an alarming worldwide expansion [ 1 2 2 2 Figure 1 3 3 4 4 Thermogenesis is a physiological mechanism where energy is dissipated as heat for whole-body temperature maintenance in mammals [ 5 4 6 4 4 5 Several reviews have previously addressed thermogenesis as a therapeutic strategy against obesity and related metabolic disorders. For example, Cheng et al. [ 6 4 5 2. Methods To provide a comprehensive overview of current and emerging strategies that stimulate NST with potential anti-diabesity effects, this review focused on physiological conditions, bioactive compounds, and pharmacological agents that promote thermogenic activation in brown/beige adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The literature search was conducted in May 2025 using MEDLINE via PubMed and Web of Science databases. The following keywords and MeSH terms were used in various combinations: Obesity; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Thermogenesis; Adipose Tissue, Brown; Muscle, Skeletal; Food Bioactive Ingredients; Melatonin; Cold Exposure; Exercise; Fasting; Capsaicin; Paradol; Gingerol; Zingerone; Cinnamaldehyde; Cinnamic acid; Curcumin; Allicin; Quercetin; Caffeine; Catechin; Theaflavin; Flavanol; Berberine; Docosahexaenoic acid; Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid; Eicosapentaenoic acid; Eriocitrin; Menthol; Thymol; Resveratrol; Proanthocyanidin; Anthocyanin; Mirabegron; Levothyroxine; Liothyronine; Triiodothyronine; Resmetirom; Fexaramine; Farnesol; Chenodeoxycholic acid; Growth Hormone; Somatotropin; Tesamorelin; Liraglutide; Semaglutide; Exedin-4; Tirzepatide; Oxyntomodulin; Mazdutide; Retatrutide; Dapagliflozin; Empagliflozin; and Canagliflozin. Additional relevant articles were identified by manually screening the reference lists of key papers and recent reviews. No date restrictions were applied to allow inclusion of pioneering studies and foundational discoveries, regardless of publication year. Articles were selected based on their scientific relevance, novelty, methodological robustness, and depth of mechanistic insight, with priority given to studies in humans and, when not available, to well-designed rodent studies. Only peer-reviewed original articles, systematic reviews, and narrative reviews written in English were considered. Studies in both in vivo and in vitro settings were included if they provided significant insight into NST activation. Exclusion criteria included non-peer-reviewed materials, case reports, conference abstracts, and older articles that lack mechanical relevance to the scope of the review or contain data corroborated in more recent studies. All selected papers were independently screened and discussed by the authors to ensure inclusion of the most informative and impactful literature. No formal quality assessment tool was applied, as this was a narrative review aiming to synthesize high-quality, conceptually relevant evidence across a broad timespan. All figures and illustrations were created by the authors using the Biorender graphic tool ( https://www.biorender.com/ https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 3. White and Thermogenic Adipose Tissues In all mammals, including humans, three different types of adipose depots can be found, known as white, brown, and beige adipose tissues. They have unique characteristics that differentiate them from each other in terms of function, morphology, structure, protein expression profile, and developmental origin. WAT can also be differentiated into visceral WAT (vWAT), or abdominal fat, which is distributed around internal organs and is located inside the peritoneum; and subcutaneous WAT (sWAT), which is located underneath the skin. vWAT tends to cause low-grade inflammation that promotes insulin resistance and is responsible for the morbidity associated with obesity, whereas sWAT is metabolically active with less inflammatory activity, and could favor metabolic insulin action [ 7 Table 1 Table 1 8 9 Figure 2 In mitochondria from BAT and bAT, the transmembrane protein UCP1 is responsible for thermogenic adipose tissue’s contribution to NST. Under certain stimuli, UCP1 is activated and generates heat production by allowing protons to re-enter the mitochondrial matrix, uncoupling substrate oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) from the ATP synthesis [ 10 Figure 3 4. Skeletal Muscle and NST Skeletal muscle plays a key role in thermoregulation through the production of heat by non-shivering mechanisms. This organ represents around 50% of total body weight and is responsible for 70–80% insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, fatty acids metabolism, and whole-body energy expenditure through futile cycles [ 5 11 Figure 4 12 11 13 2+ 2+ 2+ Figure 4 12 Figure 4 14 5. Physiological Conditions Stimulating NST 5.1. Cold Exposure Cold is a powerful natural stimulus for the activation of adaptive thermogenesis, thus generating heat production in BAT and skeletal muscle. It is well known that cold exposure increases energy expenditure and reduces insulin resistance, making it an interesting strategy during diabesity treatment [ 15 16 17 18 18 19 20 21 14 22 The mechanism of cold-induced BAT and skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis is mostly elucidated in small rodents. Briefly, cold is sensed by thermal transient receptor potential channels (TRPs), which are proteins that detect environmental changes, such as temperature, pain, touch, osmolarity, and certain natural compounds. When cold-activated TRPs in skin sensory neurons send signals to the brain, sympathetic nerve activity increases. Noradrenaline released from sympathetic terminals then triggers NST activation in BAT and skeletal muscle, as well as brown-like phenotype in WAT or browning through β3-adrenergic receptor (β3-ARs) activation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1α) expression (the key regulator of thermogenesis) [ 12 16 5.2. Physical Exercise Physical exercise itself generates heat through fiber contraction, like cold-induced shivering thermogenesis. However, there is also a close relationship between exercise and non-shivering thermogenesis due to circulating myokines released after exercise. Irisin is the most important exercise-induced adipomyokine, which is involved in the activation of NST by inducing BAT activation and browning of white fat cells in both rodents and humans [ 23 23 24 25 26 In humans, combined training increases mitochondrial enzyme activity and activates BAT in obese and diabetic patients [ 27 24 28 29 23 30 5.3. Fasting Fasting is an increasingly popular dietary approach in which the consumption of energy-providing foods and beverages is restricted for a certain number of hours. A wealth of studies highlight the efficacy of fasting in the prevention of obesity, which goes beyond thermogenesis activation and weight loss [ 31 32 33 34 Li et al. [ 33 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 41 42 43 The molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of IF on BAT thermogenesis and WAT browning are still unclear, but activation of β3-ARs mediated by Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) may be essential in the regulation of these processes [ 44 37 UCP3 45 This section highlights the significant influence of physiological conditions such as cold exposure, physical exercise, and fasting on the activation of NST through mechanisms involving BAT, skeletal muscle, and WAT browning ( Table 2 Table 3 Figure 5 6. Bioactive Ingredients and Their Role in Promoting NST Several bioactive compounds have been shown to promote NST through BAT activation/WAT browning and/or skeletal muscle SERCA–SLN uncoupling. Food-derived bioactive agents have been extensively studied for their potential in treating diabesity due to their positive health effects.

Drugs Stimulating NST 7.1. FDA-Approved Drugs Although numerous drugs exist for obesity-related conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, pharmacological interventions specifically targeting obesity remain limited. Currently, only a few FDA-approved drugs are available for long-term obesity management, primarily acting by suppressing appetite or inhibiting lipid absorption. In contrast, therapies that enhance adaptive thermogenesis—particularly via BAT activation or WAT browning—are still underexplored [ 101 β3-ARs agonists 101 21 24 4 2 102 103 104 104 105 19 Thyroid hormone receptor (THR) agonists 15 11 4 4 15 12 3 4 106 107 106 17 12 2 6 4 108 Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists 32 36 2 3 109 15 26 110 24 40 4 111 Growth hormone (GH) 990 1529 263 299 7 112 221 366 72 67 113 114 Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists 101 184 282 50 60 115 172 265 43 51 116 116 187 291 45 59 117 118 225 348 48 68 119 120 121 NCT04081337 120 192 295 59 60 122 207 317 45 65 123 221 342 46 68 124 Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors 125 21 25 6 126 23 27 7 24 25 5 127 7.2. Melatonin Melatonin 13 16 2 2 128 129 130 128 In humans, however, data from several small-scale (<100 participants) studies on the use of melatonin in patients with metabolic syndrome or obesity are conflicting and inconclusive, ranging from a modest effect to no effect, depending on the protocol applied (melatonin dosage and duration) (reviewed in [ 129 131 132 129 A substantial amount of promising data regarding the potential role of melatonin-based therapy in the prevention of obesity and its related metabolic disorders has been reported in preclinical studies. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the beneficial effects of melatonin on body weight and metabolism, and several receptors have been proposed, including the membrane receptors MT1 and MT2, the main receptors studied regulating melatonin’s effects on obesity [ 133 133 134 130 135 133 136 133 Our previous studies showed that chronic melatonin treatment reduced body weight gain in a preclinical animal model of diabesity, assembling human obesity-related type 2 diabetes, browned subcutaneous fat, increased thermogenic BAT function and mass, enhanced skeletal muscle NST and oxidative fiber phenotype, and improved lipid profile, glucose homeostasis, low-grade inflammation, and mitochondrial biogenesis and functionality [ 134 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 Melatonin works via multiple means to limit oxidative stress: (i) One mechanism is by acting as a direct scavenger to detoxify free oxygen and nitrogen species and stimulating the expression and activity of some antioxidant enzymes (e.g., NRF1/2, glutathione, GPx, SOD2, and SIRT1/3) [ 133 146 136 147 148 147 148 149 133 142 150 151 152 137 144 153 154 142 150 155 156 133 Based on all of melatonin’s aforementioned effects concerning its beneficial impact on body weight, the potential thermogenic effect, the safety aspect, and the powerful antioxidant properties, melatonin should be considered as a promising therapeutic option in addition to the drugs mentioned above for obesity management by activating thermogenic mechanisms ( Table 2 Table 3 Figure 5 pharmaceuticals-18-01247-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Summary of the physiological conditions, bioactive agents, and drugs stimulating non-shivering thermogenesis (NST) in rodents with their anti-diabesity effect, thermogenic mechanism, and molecular pathway involved.

Limitations of the Study This review has several inherent limitations that should be considered when interpreting its results. First, the literature search was conducted using only MEDLINE via PubMed and Web of Science and included only peer-reviewed original articles, systematic reviews, and narrative reviews published in English. Although no date restrictions were applied, the literature search was not exhaustive, and language and database limitations may have excluded relevant studies published in other languages or indexed elsewhere. In addition, the quality of the studies included varied, and many did not use standardized methods to evaluate the outcomes of interest. Furthermore, the review does not include a formal assessment of the quality of the studies included. In addition, the predominance of preclinical studies in certain sections also represents a limitation in terms of the applicability and translationality of these thermogenic agents. More human studies are needed in this field as the overall clinical evidence remains scarce, especially with regard to well-designed randomized controlled trials. This review provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of the impact of thermogenesis in the fight against diabesity, while also serving as an update on the state of the art in this field of research. However, among clinical studies, which tend to have a more robust methodology, many of them are observational and mainly measure indirect thermogenesis through anthropometric outcomes, such as weight loss or fat reduction. Direct measurements of NST through thermogenic markers are rarely evaluated, with results based on indirect measurements. Therefore, the heterogeneity in the assessment criteria and methodologies used introduces a bias that could affect the comparability and validity of the conclusions, and it is important for the scientific community to adopt standard methodologies in future clinical studies on thermogenesis. The narrative nature of this review offers a broad and comprehensive perspective on a complex topic, but as a result, the level of evidence presented is less definitive than that of meta-analyses focused on more specific research questions where quantitative analysis is possible, with this also being a limitation of the current review. Therefore, future research should address these limitations by conducting randomized clinical trials with sufficient statistical power, standardized protocols, direct measures of NST, and incorporating diverse populations that include different genders, ages, and metabolic states. In addition, exploring multi-target interventions that combine physiological stimuli, bioactive compounds from the diet, and pharmacological treatments could provide more effective strategies against diabesity, a question that remains unexplored. 9. Conclusions and Future Perspectives After the discovery that brown and beige fat cells exist in human adults and contribute to energy expenditure, white-fat browning and BAT activation/recruitment, together with skeletal muscle SERCA/SLN-mediated NST, are regarded as a promising alternative strategy to treat obesity and related consequences. In this context, the main challenge now is to identify molecules that will directly target brown and beige fat cells and SLN expression in muscle and produce the intended metabolic benefits in humans, with minimal side effects. In recent decades, tremendous efforts have been made towards testing the potential of many treatments and physiological manipulations to induce WAT browning or BAT activity/recruitment. At first, food-sourced bioactive compounds are gaining high interest in obesity research, and extensive studies are being performed towards their possible thermogenic effect and metabolic benefit. Current evidence from animal models, cell culture models, and limited human studies highlights the promising potential of physiological stimuli, bioactive compounds, and pharmacological agents to activate the thermogenic program as a therapeutic strategy against diabesity. However, rigorous, well-designed randomized controlled trials in humans are urgently needed to validate these findings and assess their translational value in the current clinical practice. It is essential that these clinical trials incorporate comprehensive assessments of thermogenic activity using direct molecular markers, such as UCP1 and SLN expression, mitochondrial function, and respirometry, alongside traditional clinical endpoints, such as energy expenditure, heat production, anthropometric measurements, and glycemic control. Similarly, it is essential to include diverse populations, encompassing both sexes, various age groups (children, adults, and older adults), and metabolic conditions (obesity, type 2 diabetes, and diabesity), as well as considering other physiological states such as pregnant and/or breastfeeding women. This will improve the understanding of the efficacy and safety profile of these therapies in different patient subgroups and bring them closer to clinical implementation. Furthermore, future research must take into consideration (i) the optimal dosage and duration, (ii) the administration method, and (iii) the correct treatment time period. Meanwhile, no plausible pharmacotherapy is currently available in clinical trials to directly target obesity through NST. Currently, although some potential candidate drugs are available, data on their thermogenic effect on humans is scarce; hence, translating basic data to clinical trials targeting different human populations is still needed. Given that obesity is intimately linked to excessive ROS production, which plays a pivotal role in its pathogenesis, it could be of great interest to combine antioxidant therapies with weight loss strategies. Melatonin stands out among antioxidants due to its dual role, providing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory protection while also acting as a metabolic regulator. Further pharmacological strategies are needed to provide the expected metabolic benefits of increased energy expenditure, reduced body fat, and improved metabolic health, but also reduced oxidative stress damage, without clinically significant side effects. Seemingly, the dual thermogenic capacity of melatonin on muscle and adipose-mediated NST and its beneficial effects on body weight and metabolic health, along with its antioxidant properties and safety profile, make melatonin a plausible therapeutic target and the most optimal clinical candidate for treating obesity and its devastating complications in humans. Well-designed controlled clinical trials with long follow-up periods that take into consideration the dose and time of day of administration are required to assess the potential thermogenic effect of melatonin in obese/overweight individuals and its impact on body weight and metabolic profile, as well as its pharmacological safety in different human populations with various physiological conditions. Practical challenges, such as standardizing drug doses, administration methods, and the correct treatment period, as well as standardizing nutritional interventions, need to be carefully addressed in order to optimize clinical applicability. In addition, melatonin stands out as a particularly promising candidate due to its multifaceted role in mitochondrial protection, metabolic regulation, antioxidant capacity, and sleep improvement, all of which are critical for patients with diabesity, who often suffer from sleep disorders. Although the individual intervention trials of thermogenic agents reviewed in this paper are necessary to elucidate their efficacy, it would be interesting for future clinical trials to prioritize a multi-target approach, combining physiological interventions, such as physical exercise and fasting, with nutritional interventions based on hypocaloric diets enriched in thermogenic food-derived bioactive compounds, and pharmacological agents such as melatonin, which has both thermogenic and antioxidant properties. As each stimulus independently activates thermogenesis by different mechanisms, their combined effect could be greater than the sum of individual responses. This integrative approach could synergistically enhance NST activation and metabolic improvements beyond isolated interventions, representing an effective therapeutic approach in the struggle against obesity and related diseases.

On the left, ATPase pumps protons down their gradient to catalyze the synthesis of ATP in all cells, including WAT cells. On the right, UCP1 in BAT and bAT facilitates a proton leak from the intermembrane space back into the matrix, from which the energy produced is released as heat (thermogenesis).
