These diseases are caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, cholinesterase malfunction, neuronal inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The incidence of neurodegenerative disease has been on the rise. Current therapeutic interventions are expensive, exhibit poor efficacy, and have numerous side effects. Several studies have explored the potential of crucial dietary substances rich in antioxidants and micronutrients in alleviating the clinical manifestations of such deadly diseases. Consumption of sufficient antioxidants, fatty acids, and polyphenols in regular diets delays the onset of neurodegenerative diseases.

Introduction Neurodegenerative disorders are a group of heterogeneous disorders resulting from the progressive loss of neurons [ 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 The top contributing factors include age-related, continuous mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which can result in mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, as well as altered metabolism [ 15 16 17 15 16 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Among all neurodegenerative diseases, AD is the most common, which causes an amnestic cognitive impairment and is characterized by the presence of β-amyloid plaques and tau neurofibrillary tangles [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 3 Since ancient times, natural products have been used in the prevention and treatment of these ailments [ 33 34 35 36 37 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 NCT04451096 NCT03968133 NCT05173701 Current therapeutic interventions alleviate symptoms but cannot arrest the development of neurodegeneration [ 43 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 Approximately 40% of cases of dementia can be prevented by modifying lifestyle and dietary patterns. Various initiatives and programs have been developed with focus on ‘Food as Medicine’. These efforts integrate nutrition with healthcare, emphasizing the vital role that balanced, healthful eating plays in overall well-being. These initiatives harness the power of food to prevent, manage, and even treat various health conditions in a holistic approach with medical care [ 63 64 65 NCT04828785 This review discusses the pharmacological considerations and mechanism of neurodegeneration, including mitochondrial damage, neuroinflammation, glymphatic clearance, ferroptosis, brain–body interactions, and vagus nerve stimulation. It focuses on the role of specific diets, dietary patterns, and supplements in preventing neurodegenerative disorders. It examines clinical studies that evaluate these interventions, highlighting the pharmacological basis of antioxidant-rich diets in managing and preventing these diseases. Additionally, this review explores functional foods like vitamins, fruits, vegetables, and specialized diets that may aid in managing neurodegenerative conditions. It concludes with insights into the clinical status of these functional foods in relation to such disorders. 2. Pharmacological Considerations in Brain Disorders Mitochondrial function and energy production play a crucial role in regulating brain activity. Even in the resting state, the brain consumes around 20% of the body’s overall energy [ 66 67 68 66 2.1. Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Brain Disorders Mitochondrial dynamics include fission, fusion, motility, and mitophagy, which are critical for mitochondrial homeostasis. Dysregulation in mitochondrial dynamics can be a key pathogenic mechanism in various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases. Under normal conditions, an equilibrium exists between ROS production and their detoxification. This ensures that while ROS are generated as byproducts of cellular metabolism, they are efficiently neutralized, preventing any potential damage to cellular structures and maintaining overall cellular health. A shift in mitochondrial ROS production in turn causes oxidative stress, which causes irreversible damage to the mitochondrial membrane. Overproduction of ROS damages the cellular structure, contributes to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impairs cellular functions [ 69 70 71 72 73 74 73 75 Figure 1 76 Figure 1 77 Figure 1 78 79 80 81 71 75 82 2.2. Mitophagy Mitophagy is a cellular protective mechanism to clear dysfunctional mitochondria, which involves lysosomal degradation of mitochondria for the recycling of cellular components. Damaged mitochondria are removed through autophagy, which is a “waste disposal system”. Generally, damaged mitochondria are selectively encapsulated by autophagosomes, which in turn form mitophagosomes. These mitophagosomes are fused with lysosomes, forming mitophagolysosomes. The damaged mitochondria are then digested into phagocytic vacuoles. The key regulatory pathways of mitophagy include PINK1-Parkin, AMPK-ULK1, PGC-1α-NRF-1/2 transcription factor A [ 83 84 Certain food ingredients act as mitophagy inducers and impact mitochondrial function in many ways. Such functional foods include polyphenols, such as urolithin, mangiferin, and morin, which protect the mitochondrial membrane potential, preventing the activation of caspases in neurons, thereby inhibiting apoptosis [ 71 85 86 Table 1 87 88 2.3. Glymphatic Clearance for Brain Health Brain waste clearance is crucial for maintaining good neurological health. One such pathway involved in brain clearance is the glymphatic system. This system facilitates the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid towards the cervical lymph nodes. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a transmembrane water channel protein, is associated with the flow of fluids and the glymphatic system [ 102 103 104 104 105 105 106 Recent studies have shown the impact of diet and supplements (e.g., omega-3 fatty acids) in supporting brain clearance via the glymphatic system. Supplementation with PUFAs has been shown to increase the clearance of β-amyloid protein via the AQP4-dependent glymphatic system [ 107 108 109 109 2.4. Neuroinflammation Neuroinflammation is a multifaceted pathophysiological response of the body and brain in response to any injury or disease. As discussed in an earlier section, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation are linked, which is greatly influenced by diet and habit. For example, a high-fat diet induces neuroinflammation. It can increase the permeability of the BBB, which in turn can allow proinflammatory factors to interact with glial cells, promoting inflammation and neurodegeneration [ 110 111 112 Figure 1 77 113 2.5. Brain–Body Interactions in Brain Health 2.5.1. Gut–Brain Axis, Microbiome, and Virome The gut–brain axis is a bidirectional communication that connects the gastrointestinal tract to the CNS [ 114 Figure 2 115 116 117 118 119 The gut–brain axis influences metabolic, neural, endocrine, and immunological pathways ( Figure 2 The gut microbiota comprises around 100 trillion microorganisms that engage in a symbiotic relationship. About 90% of the total community of microbes in the human gut is the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes Phyla [ 120 121 Escherichia coli 122 123 124 125 The gut virome relation to brain health has received attention in recent studies, which includes bacteriophages [ 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 Traditionally, the appendix has been viewed as a vestigial organ with no significant purpose [ 133 134 135 136 121 133 134 Dysfunction of the intestinal barrier enhances the risk of systemic exposure to endotoxins, leading to the development of such chronic conditions [ 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 Also, treatment with faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with PD has been shown to reduce constipation (non-motor symptoms) by providing bacterial strains such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which produces SCFAs. These act as anti-inflammatory agents, increase ENS activity, and promote gastrointestinal motility [ 144 145 146 2.5.2. Heart–Brain Axis The heart–brain axis is also a bidirectional communication that involves neural, humoral, and immunological pathways. Further, several studies have emerged showing cardiac dysfunction correlation with neurodegenerative diseases [ 147 148 149 150 151 Exercise stimuli can prevent or slow cognitive decline in elderly patients with heart failure. In this respect, vagal stimulation, exercise training, electrical neurostimulation, and music therapy have become interesting options in the treatment of angina pectoris, heart failure, and hypertension, which in turn improves neurological conditions [ 148 2.5.3. Other Organs In addition to the gut–brain and heart–brain axis, other organs also exhibit bidirectional communication with the brain. For example, CNS inflammation is linked to liver function [ 152 153 Liver X receptors are nuclear receptors that are key regulators of lipid metabolism and inflammatory responses [ 154 58 2.6. Vagus Nerve Stimulation Impacted by Food Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) was approved in 1994 as an adjuvant therapy for refractory epilepsy. Multiple studies have reported reductions in seizure frequency and improvements in cognition after VNS stimulation [ 155 119 156 157 158 158 2.7. Ferroptosis Ferroptosis cell death is characterized by iron-dependent lipid oxidation, accompanied by variations in cell morphology and protein expression [ 159 160 161 162 163 164 2.8. Impact of Caloric Restriction on Brain Health Caloric restriction (CR) is a lifestyle intervention that improves long-term brain health owing to enhanced cognitive function. Physiological alterations associated with CR and fasting are known to have profound implications linked to dementia and reduced β-amyloid accumulation [ 165 165 166 167 168 167 d 169 169 170 3. Diets and Their Mechanism in Preventing Neurodegenerative Diseases People with neurodegenerative conditions are at greater risk of developing malnutrition [ 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 3.1. Foods That Worsen Neurodegenerative Diseases Unhealthy, unbalanced diet, along with environmental factors, including smoking, stress, alcohol consumption, pesticide exposure, and a sedentary lifestyle, are significant causes of the progression of neurodegenerative diseases [ 178 179 180 181 Consumption of whole grains can affect cognitive domains during childhood and adolescence [ 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 Consumption of refined sugars and sweeteners, including sweetened beverages, adversely affects cognitive functions, especially during childhood and pregnancy [ 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 195 196 3.2. Diets for Prevention and Management Now, we understand that dietary choices significantly impact physiology and the prevention and management of diseases. Various dietary patterns have been developed and studied, showing a significant role in maintaining overall health. Among these, the Paleolithic diet, Mediterranean, MIND, and ketogenic diets have gained attention for managing such health conditions. Some of these emphasize whole foods reminiscent of our ancestral eating habits, some focus on rich flavors and heart-healthy ingredients, and some uniquely combine elements of other diets to support brain health. In contrast, the ketogenic diet is recognized for its low-carb, high-fat approach. Mediterranean, ketogenic, and vegan diets have been shown to improve cognitive symptoms and reduce β-amyloid protein [ 197 3.2.1. Paleolithic Diet The Paleolithic diet is a modern concept of the diet consumed by humans during the “Old Stone Age” or Paleolithic era [ 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 NCT01381354 NCT03659422 3.2.2. Mediterranean Diet The Mediterranean diet includes the consumption of vegetables, fruits, cereals, seeds, and nuts as major sources of fats. It also includes moderate consumption of dairy products and low processed meats. Adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been shown to improve cognitive functions [ 207 208 NCT05175378 NCT03851861 NCT04435509 NCT04440020 209 210 211 212 3.2.3. DASH Diets The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) [ 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 3.2.4. MIND Diet MIND stands for a hybrid of the DASH and Mediterranean diets, an intervention for the neurodegenerative delay [ 220 221 222 223 NCT04337255 NCT02817074 NCT05301868 3.2.5. Ketogenic Diet It is a fat-rich, low-carbohydrate diet with fasting-like effects, which lead to a state of ketosis. It is known to reduce appetite and shows gastrointestinal side effects, which is referred to as keto flu. It has shown benefits in epileptic seizures, ALS, cerebral ischemia, AD, and PD [ 224 225 226 227 228 NCT05152771 NCT00777010 NCT05152771 3.2.6. Modified Atkins Diet The modified Atkins diet, often called “MAD”, is quite like the traditional ketogenic diet but is restrictive. It was initially developed in the 1970s for weight loss, but it is now “modified” from Atkins diet. Also, there is no caloric restriction; instead, fats and proteins are encouraged [ 229 230 231 NCT03718247 NCT03585907 NCT02521818 3.2.7. Swank Diet The Swank diet is based on evidence that high-fat consumption, mainly from dairy and meat sources, has a higher incidence of MS [ 232 233 232 234 235 NCT02914964 4. Clinical Studies on the Management of Neurodegenerative Disease with Diet Intervention 4.1. Parkinson’s Disease PD involves continuous degeneration of neurons in the basal ganglia, causing motor dysfunctions [ 236 237 238 237 The impact of diet in slowing down the progression of PD has emerged as a potential strategy for addressing such neurodegenerative diseases [ 239 240 Table 2 241 242 243 244 245 Intake of the Mediterranean diet elevates SCFAs such as acetate, butyrate, and propionate levels, stimulating gut microbiota like Roseburia spp. This helps maintain the intestinal barrier and reduce inflammation, leading to decreased non-motor symptoms (constipation) associated with PD [ 246 247 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 A meta-analysis states that probiotics rehabilitate gut microbiota, promote bowel movement, and provide beneficial strains like Lactobacilli Bifidobacteriu 249 L. reuteri L. fermentum L. acidophilus B. bifidum 250 251 252 Adherence to specific healthy diets, including Mediterranean, Modified Atkins, ketogenic, and gluten-free diets, is associated with specific components that have beneficial effects on the body.

Future Perspective and Conclusions Functional foods have emerged as a potential strategy in preventing and treating neurodegenerative diseases. Several studies have shown that neuronal dysfunction occurs due to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, which can be prevented and treated with micronutrients. However, the dose of micronutrients should be tuned to get the desired pharmacological effects. Most of these micronutrients restore normal body function and replenish the body’s deficiencies. However, precise monitoring of food intake, microbiome studies, and mapping of genetic variants requires further investigation. The area of nutrigenomics is evolving and could be a focus for future studies. Future studies could consider studying the health-promoting genes and reducing the expression of disease-promoting genes [ 339 In conclusion, adopting a balanced and nutrient-rich diet, along with supplementation of essential nutrients and the inclusion of bioactive phytochemicals, can play a crucial role in reducing the risk and managing neurodegenerative diseases. Ongoing research and clinical trials continue to highlight the importance of dietary interventions as promising alternatives for promoting brain health and preventing cognitive decline.
