Background Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) arising from long-standing burn scars—Marjolin's ulcer—is rare but aggressive. Multiple synchronous SCCs in burn scars are exceptionally uncommon and associated with rapid progression. Case presentation A 56-year-old male with a 40-year-old thermal injury to the right upper limb presented with two enlarging masses over the elbow and axilla. Initial cytology suggested benign dermoid cysts, but MRI indicated suspicious heterogeneous lesions. Excision with axillary lymphadenectomy revealed well-differentiated SCC with extensive nodal metastases and positive margins. Within one month, rapid multifocal recurrence and cervical lymphadenopathy required right upper limb amputation with cervical lymphadenectomy, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Postoperative care included antibiotic prophylaxis, multimodal analgesia, early physiotherapy, and psychological counseling. The patient expressed that he had never considered his burn scars a cancer risk and hoped his experience would encourage vigilance for chronic wounds. Discussion This case underscores the limitations of cytology in evaluating chronic scar lesions and the importance of early biopsy, histopathologic confirmation, and oncologic resection from the outset. Multifocal SCC in burn scars may indicate a high-risk biological profile, warranting aggressive surgical management and structured long-term follow-up. Conclusion Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for malignancy in chronic burn scars, avoid relying solely on cytology, and adopt an oncologic surgical approach at first intervention. Lifelong surveillance is essential to detect recurrence or new primary lesions. Highlights • Multiple SCCs developed in long-standing burn scars of the upper limb. • Rare synchronous SCC presentation with rapid local progression. • Successful oncologic control by wide excision and above-elbow amputation. • First reported Vietnamese case of multiple SCCs from burn scars. • Key lessons for early detection and surgical management of Marjolin's ulcer.

In 1828, Jean-Nicolas Marjolin provided the first formal description of ulcers developing in scar tissue. In 1903, Da Costa introduced the term Marjolin's ulcer to denote malignancies, particularly SCC, arising from chronic burn scars [ 6 7 8 5 7 9 SCC arising from burn scars is generally more aggressive than de novo cutaneous SCC, with higher rates of local recurrence, lymph node metastasis, distant spread, and disease-specific mortality [ 5 7 10 5 8 11 5 8 12 5 8 12 13 Herein, we present a rare case of multiple SCCs arising from a long-standing burn scar of the upper limb, highlighting the diagnostic challenges, surgical management, and need for vigilant follow-up. The case is reported in line with the SCARE Guidelines 2025 [ 14 2 Case report A 56-year-old Vietnamese male farmer, with no significant past medical history, no comorbidities such as diabetes or immunosuppression, a non-smoker, occasional alcohol use, and no family history of skin cancer, presented with progressively enlarging masses on the right upper extremity. He had sustained extensive burn injuries 40 years earlier from a gasoline explosion, affecting the right shoulder, arm, and elbow. Occupationally, he worked as a rice farmer, with moderate outdoor sun exposure but no evidence of chronic actinic damage elsewhere. Six months prior to presentation, a non-healing ulcer appeared spontaneously at the right elbow without trauma or new burn injury. The lesion resembled his current tumor, consistent with features of a Marjolin-type ulcer. It was treated with excision and skin graft at another facility, but graft failure occurred within weeks, and no records of operative details were available. Following grafting, two painless, well-demarcated masses developed—one at the right medial elbow (5 × 4 cm) and another in the axilla (3 × 2 cm) ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 1 (A, B) Clinical appearance of two tumors at the medial elbow and axilla of the right upper limb, located over long-standing burn scars.

Fig. 2 Surgery was performed by a senior surgeon with over 10 years of experience. Under general anesthesia with a combined brachial plexus block for postoperative analgesia, both masses were excised along with axillary lymph node dissection. Because cytology had indicated benign lesions, wide oncologic margins were not pursued. Intraoperative findings included dense scar tissue adherent to surrounding neurovascular structures. Histopathology revealed well-differentiated SCC with metastasis in 6 of 7 lymph nodes ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 (A) Gross specimens of the excised tumors and axillary lymph nodes.

Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Postoperative photographs following upper limb amputation and cervical lymphadenectomy. Fig. 4 One month later, the patient developed painful, irregular recurrent masses at the previous sites and cervical lymphadenopathy. Given rapid recurrence, multifocality, nodal metastasis, and aggressive course, amputation of the right upper limb with cervical lymphadenectomy was performed, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy 4 weeks later ( Fig. 4 Supplement Fig. 1 3 Discussion Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) developing in chronic burn scars, commonly referred to as Marjolin's ulcer, is consistently associated with more aggressive behavior and poorer prognosis compared to de novo cutaneous SCC. Numerous clinical series have reported higher rates of local recurrence, lymphatic spread, distant metastasis, and disease-specific mortality in post-burn SCC [ 2 [4] [5] [6] [7] [9] [10] [11] [12] 15 16 [4] [5] [6] [7] 9 11 12 Malignant transformation is driven by chronic inflammation, characterized by persistent infiltration of immune cells, overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α), and reactive oxygen species, which promote DNA damage and genomic instability [ [5] [6] [7] [8] 5 7 5 6 8 5 6 9 11 7 While single-lesion post-burn SCC already carries a poor prognosis, multiple synchronous lesions—as in our case—are even rarer and may be associated with higher recurrence and metastasis rates. This observation aligns with broader cSCC literature, where multifocal disease is linked to more aggressive tumor biology, shorter disease-free intervals, and increased mortality [ 4 5 9 11 13 15 16 [4] [5] [6] 9 12 Prevention should prioritize vigilant surveillance and timely intervention, not prophylactic excision of all scars [ [4] [5] [6] 9 12 [2] [3] [4] 6 9 6 7 17 [3] [4] [5] [6] 18 19 In conclusion, SCC arising from chronic burn scars represents a distinct clinicopathologic entity driven by sustained inflammation, hypoxia, genomic instability, and impaired immune surveillance. Optimal management requires high clinical suspicion, early histopathological confirmation of suspicious lesions, complete excision with negative margins, and structured long-term surveillance to minimize recurrence and improve patient outcomes.
