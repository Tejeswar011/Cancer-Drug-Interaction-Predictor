ACR Open Rheumatology https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ This is an open access article under the terms of the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ We report a rare case of IgG4‐related disease (IgG4‐RD) presenting with retroperitoneal fibrosis and autoimmune pancreatitis, followed by sequential development of papillary thyroid carcinoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Histopathologic and positron emission tomography–computed tomography findings were essential for diagnosis and guided timely treatment. This case highlights the potential oncogenic link between chronic IgG4‐driven inflammation and B cell malignancy, emphasizing the need for vigilant cancer surveillance in patients with IgG4‐RD. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:04.10.2025 Author disclosures are available online at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr2.70114 Introduction IgG4‐related disease (IgG4‐RD) is a systemic inflammatory condition characterized by the infiltration of IgG4‐positive plasma cells, forming mass‐like lesions in various organs. Clinically and radiologically, it can mimic malignancies, complicating diagnosis.  1  2 Case report A 61‐year‐old woman presented with persistent lower back pain and intermittent low‐grade fever for three months. Laboratory results showed normal tumor markers (CA19‐9 and carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]), whereas positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET‐CT) revealed a retroperitoneal soft tissue mass posterior to the pancreatic head, exhibiting hypermetabolic activity suggestive of malignancy. Additional findings included thyroid nodules with heterogeneous uptake in both lobes. Enhanced abdominal CT confirmed bulky retroperitoneal tissue with lymphadenopathy, raising suspicion of an aggressive tumor. However, CT‐guided biopsy of the pancreatic mass revealed abundant IgG4‐positive plasma cells, exceeding 150 cells per high‐power field, with an IgG4/IgG ratio above 40%, consistent with IgG4‐related autoimmune pancreatitis and retroperitoneal fibrosis (Figure 1A B 1C D Figure 1 Pathologic and imaging features in a patient with IgG4‐related disease (IgG4‐RD) and subsequent malignancies. (A and B) Retroperitoneal biopsy showing hallmark features of IgG4‐RD. (A) Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining reveals storiform fibrosis with dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration. (B) Immunohistochemistry highlights abundant IgG4‐positive plasma cells (>150/per high‐power field [HPF]). (C and D) Histopathologic features of papillary thyroid carcinoma. (C) H&E staining shows typical papillary architecture with fibrovascular cores. (D) Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) immunostaining demonstrates strong and diffuse membranous positivity in tumor cells. (E and F) Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET‐CT) findings during disease progression. (E) Whole‐body PET scan reveals metabolically active lymphadenopathy across multiple regions. (F) Coronal PET‐CT fusion image shows intense fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in retroperitoneal and pelvic masses. (G and H) Lymph node biopsy confirming diffuse large B cell lymphoma. (G) H&E staining shows diffuse infiltration of large atypical lymphoid cells with prominent nucleoli. (H) Immunohistochemistry for CD20 shows strong membranous positivity, confirming B cell lineage. All pathologic images, unless otherwise specified, are at a magnification of ×100. Six months later, with prednisone reduced to 5 mg daily and azathioprine to 50 mg daily, she developed recurrent back pain and left inguinal discomfort. Imaging revealed expanding retroperitoneal lesions and newly enlarged cervical and inguinal lymph nodes. Repeat PET‐CT suggested possible lymphoma (Figure 1E F 1G H Discussion This case underscores the diagnostic challenges of IgG4‐RD, a condition often indistinguishable from malignancies without histopathologic confirmation. IgG4‐RD is increasingly recognized as a mimic of pancreatic and retroperitoneal tumors,  3  4 The co‐occurrence of IgG4‐RD with malignancies raises important clinical considerations. Chronic inflammation in IgG4‐RD may create a protumorigenic environment, as suggested by recent studies linking IgG4‐RD with pancreaticobiliary and hematologic cancers.  5 Management of such cases requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this patient, close collaboration among rheumatology, endocrinology, pathology, and oncology ensured timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The initial administration of glucocorticoids and azathioprine effectively controlled IgG4‐RD, whereas the transition to chemotherapy addressed the subsequent DLBCL. Surveillance for malignancies is critical in patients with IgG4‐RD, especially those receiving long‐term immunosuppressive therapy. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for new or progressive lesions and pursue repeat biopsies when necessary. This case highlights the need for vigilant monitoring and personalized treatment strategies in managing IgG4‐RD with concurrent malignancies. Conclusions This case illustrates the complexities of diagnosing and treating IgG4‐RD in the presence of dual malignancies. The findings underscore the pivotal role of histopathology in distinguishing benign from malignant processes and highlight the importance of multidisciplinary care. Vigilant surveillance and timely intervention are essential to improving outcomes in this rare but challenging clinical scenario.
