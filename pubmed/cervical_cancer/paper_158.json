The normal Vero E6 (ATCC® CRL-1586™) cell line stemmed from green monkeys, and the prostate carcinoma cell line (DU-145, ATCC® HTB-81™) were procured from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) produced by ATCC, along with DMSO, foetal bovine serum, trypsin, were bought from Gibco BRL (Germany). MTT, PBS, and doxorubicin were acquired from Solarbio Life Sciences Company (Beijing, China). Formalin solution, ethanol, paraffin wax, and blood collection tubes were purchased from Legacy Lab Africa LTD (Nairobi, Kenya).

The animals were housed in standard cages for one week to acclimatize and were subjected to a 12-h cycle of light and darkness at room temperature. They had unlimited access to water and feed pellets. Clean-cut papers were placed on the floors of the cages to serve as bedding for the animals. The cages were cleaned up daily, and the papers were replaced with fresh ones. Ethical approval All protocols received ethical clearance from the Ethics Committee for the Use and Care of Animals at Mount Kenya University, Kenya (Ref. No. MKU/ISERC/3626). The experiments were designed to minimize animal pain and distress as much as possible, following the National Institutes of Health’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 56 2.4.3 Toxicological investigations on BCM The sub-acute toxicity investigation of BCM 57 58 2.4.4 Sub-acute toxicity The subacute toxicity was investigated as per the guidelines number 407 of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which outlines the standard protocol for a 28-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study in rodent models 59 et al 60 BCM BCM in vitro BCM 61 62 2.4.5 Clinical evaluation The animals were clinically evaluated as previously described. 62 63 37 (4) (5) 62 (4) A m o u n t o f w a t e r t a k e n ( m L ) = A W G P D ( m L ) - A W R A 24 h ( m L ) (5) A m o u n t o f f e e d c o n s u m e d ( g ) = A F G P D ( g ) - A F R A 24 h ( g ) 2.4.6 Collection of samples On day 29, following an overnight fast, animals were humanely euthanized under carbon dioxide (CO 2 64 65 61 66 67 2.4.7 Analysis of biochemical parameters Blood samples in additive-free tubes were allowed to coagulate at room temperature for 1 h prior to centrifugation (3,500 rpm, 10 min). The resulting supernatant sera were subsequently used for biochemical analysis 62 68 69 2.4.8 Analysis of haematological parameters Haematological parameters were assessed using blood collected in EDTA tubes through an automated Mindray BC-5000 haematological analyzer (Mindray Medical International Limited, Shenzhen, China). The haematological parameters investigated included key blood cell counts, erythrocyte indices, and platelet indices. 64 37 59 2.4.9 Macroscopic assessment and organ relative weights Post-euthanasia, all rats underwent a macroscopic pathological investigation, encompassing an evaluation of the exterior surface, internal organs, and all orifices, as well as a record of any evident pathological changes. Thereafter, vital organs such as the heart, lungs, spleen, liver, and kidneys were surgically removed and weighed to determine their absolute organ weight. Subsequently, the relative organ weight (ROW) was computed relative to the animal’s final body weight using the following equation (Eqn.

The fixed organs were then dehydrated with 100 % ethanol, embedded in paraffin wax, and allowed to solidify into blocks on a cold plate. Thereafter, they were sectioned with a microtome blade to a thickness of 3 to 4 µm. 68 72 73 68 74 72 2.5 Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0.2 (La Jolla, CA, USA) and OriginPro 2024 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). Results were then expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical comparisons between the different groups were performed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Dunnett's/Turkey’s post hoc test, as well as t-tests. A p-value of less than 0.05 was employed to indicate the statistical significance for all analyses conducted in the study. 3 Results 3.1 In vitro 3.1.1 Cytotoxicity and antiproliferation assay Both BCM Fig. 1 BCM Fig. 1 50 50 BCM Fig. 2 Supplementary Fig. S1 Supplementary Fig. S3 BCM- Fig. 2 Supplementary Fig. S2 Supplementary Fig. S4 BCM- 50 50 50 50 50 50 Table 2 Fig. 1 BCM Fig. 3 Table 2 Fig. 1 Viability of DU-145 prostate cancer cells as influenced by BCM BCM Brassica carinata Brassica carinata Fig. 2 Illustration of the concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of BCM A) BCM B) BCM Table 2 A summary table of the IC 50 50 BCM Treatments BCM- BCME Positive control P.value IC 50 33.47 ± 1.92 a 46.25 ± 0.88 b 4.51 ± 1.10 c p < 0.05 CC 50 117.33 ± 1.35 a 213.76 ± 2.41 b 12.16 ± 0.83 c p < 0.05 Selectivity Index (SI) 3.50 4.62 2.69 Summary of the IC 50 50 BCM .

The different phases (G1, S, G2) control cells' movement through the cycle, ensuring that cells cannot proceed to the next stage if their DNA is damaged.

Therefore, the assessment of serum-specific biochemical markers related to these organs is fundamental for assessing the toxic effect of any substance on their function. 119 60 120 62 1 BCM BCM 121 BCM 122 BCM BCM 75 123 BCM The hematopoietic system, especially the bone marrow, is a primary target for harmful substances. 124 125 1 BCM BCM BCM- 75 BCM Induced toxicity manifests through morphological alterations in vital organs, encompassing changes in size, color, and texture. 126 127 Drugs and xenobiotics are metabolized and eliminated mainly by the kidneys and liver.
