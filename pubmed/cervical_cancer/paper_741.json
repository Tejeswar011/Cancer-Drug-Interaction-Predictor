The ongoing obesity epidemic has led to a growing recognition of the detrimental effects of excessive adipose tissue accumulation on male reproductive health. Substantial evidence indicates that obesity adversely affects sperm quality, thereby impairing male fertility. Specifically, obesity is associated with compromised spermatogenesis, erectile dysfunction, and detrimental effects on offspring fertility parameters. These effects are mediated through various mechanisms, including alterations in the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, inflammation within the reproductive system, localized caloric excess in reproductive tissues, epigenetic modifications, disruptions in gut microbiota, and heightened oxidative stress levels. While the molecular alterations associated with obesity have been extensively documented, the precise mechanisms by which obesity influences male reproductive function remain inadequately understood. This article aimed to review the classification and distribution of adipose tissue in obesity, the impact of obesity on male fertility, and the potential mechanisms through which obesity affects male reproductive health, thereby offering insights into the prevention and treatment of obesity-related male fertility issues. obesity white adipose tissue brown adipose tissue sperm quality epigenetics male infertility 2024 Independent Innovation Fund of Huazhong University of Science and Technology 5003519022 Collaborative Education Project of the Ministry of Education between Industry and Academia 220601164154747 This work was supported by 2024 Independent Innovation Fund of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (No. 5003519022) and the Collaborative Education Project of the Ministry of Education between Industry and Academia (No. 220601164154747). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Male infertility is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the inability of a male to impregnate a fertile female after at least one year of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse. Males are solely responsible for approximately 20% of infertility cases and contribute to an additional 30% to 40% of cases overall [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Obesity is a complex disorder arising from the interaction of genetic, environmental, and psychosocial factors and is defined as a syndrome characterized by excessive accumulation of visceral fat [ 10 11 12 13 Obesity represents a complex disorder with multiple contributing factors, encompassing nutritional patterns, sleep deprivation, exercise frequency, pharmacological influences, hereditary factors, and familial tendencies. It significantly elevates the risk of cardiovascular diseases and is strongly associated with numerous comorbid conditions, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and several forms of cancer [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 2. Classification and Distribution of Adipose Tissue Adipose tissue is present in two functionally and structurally distinct forms: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) [ 13 27 28 13 29 30 BAT predominantly localizes to specific anatomical regions, including the cervical, perirenal, suprarenal, and cardiothoracic areas, particularly surrounding the aorta and mediastinal structures [ 31 32 Table 1 33 34 Beyond the classical classifications of white and brown adipose tissues, a distinct third adipocyte population, termed beige adipose tissue, has been characterized. These adipocytes are predominantly situated within subcutaneous fat depots, notably in the paravertebral and supraclavicular regions. Although histologically indistinguishable from brown adipocytes, beige adipocytes exhibit physiological properties similar to white adipocytes under basal conditions, demonstrating limited thermogenic activity [ 38 39 40 Figure 1 The testes constitute vital components of the male reproductive system, primarily responsible for the generation of spermatozoa and the production of the sex hormone testosterone [ 41 42 Extensive research has established that sexually dimorphic patterns of adipose tissue distribution in mammalian species, including humans, are closely associated with distinct metabolic risk profiles [ 43 44 45 46 47 3. The Impact of Obesity on Male Fertility 3.1. The Impact of Obesity on Spermatogenesis and Sperm Quality Obesity has been associated with impaired sperm quality and diminished male fertility [ 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 3.2. The Impact of Obesity on Erectile Dysfunction Erectile dysfunction (ED), that is, the consistent failure to achieve/maintain erection sufficient for intercourse, demonstrates strong epidemiological links with obesity. A clinical study conducted by Aleksandra et al. demonstrated significant correlations between the severity of ED, parameters of body fat accumulation, and gonadal hormone profiles in elderly male subjects aged 60 years and above [ 56 57 58 59 60 2 2 61 62 63 64 3.3. The Impact of Male Obesity on Offspring Excessive consumption of an HFD by parents before, during, and after lactation may adversely affect the reproductive health of male offspring [ 65 66 Gata6 Samd4b 67 68 4. Mechanisms Through Which Obesity Impacts Male Fertility The underlying mechanisms are primarily linked to dysfunction of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, inflammation within the reproductive system, increased localized heat in the reproductive organs, epigenetic modifications, disturbances in gut microbiota, and heightened levels of oxidative stress ( Figure 2 4.1. Endocrine Disorder Current epidemiological data indicate that approximately 45% of adult males meet the criteria for moderate-to-severe obesity, a population characterized by a high prevalence of endocrine dysfunction, including abnormalities in sex hormone levels [ 69 70 The proper functioning of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis is critically regulated by the rhythmic secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This neuroendocrine control system is highly sensitive to metabolic status and energy balance. When energy intake surpasses physiological requirements, this delicate equilibrium is disrupted, initiating a cascade of reproductive consequences, including hormonal imbalances, testicular oxidative damage, and impaired regulation of adipokines. These metabolic disturbances significantly affect gonadal physiology, secondary reproductive structures, and early embryonic development [ 71 72 73 74 75 4.2. Inflammation of the Reproductive System Obesity constitutes a state of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation mediated by various pro-inflammatory factors [ 76 77 78 79 80 81 Chaudhuri et al. demonstrated that the primary pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by adipose tissue, specifically interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), directly stimulate the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis [ 82 77 83 4.3. Elevated Localized Heat in the Reproductive System Spermatogenesis is widely recognized as a process highly sensitive to temperature variations within reproductive physiology, requiring an optimal thermal range of 32–35 °C for proper function in the human testis. Obesity has been associated with increased body temperature, particularly in the scrotal region [ 66 84 85 86 87 4.4. Epigenetic Modification During spermiogenesis, the terminal phase of sperm development, extensive post-translational modifications, including histone acetylation and ubiquitination, mediate the critical transition from nucleosomal to protamine-based chromatin packaging. These biochemical modifications induce chromatin decondensation, enabling the systematic displacement of histones by protamines—an essential transformation that permits extreme DNA compaction within the mature sperm head [ 88 89 90 Although the nutritional and health status of the mother during pregnancy and lactation exerts a more pronounced influence on offspring health compared to that of the father, the paternal contribution remains significant and should not be overlooked [ 91 26 92 93 4.4.1. Impact of Obesity on Sperm DNA Methylation Recent research has revealed that obese males exhibit distinct patterns of sperm DNA hypomethylation, particularly at imprinted loci and repetitive genomic regions, which are associated with reduced reproductive outcomes [ 94 95 Animal studies have demonstrated that diet-induced paternal obesity in F0 mice alters the microRNA composition of sperm and modifies the methylation patterns of germ cells. Notably, a reduction in overall germ cell methylation has been observed in the F2 generation offspring, indicating its potential as a biomarker for assessing offspring health and the heritable transmission of obesity and metabolic dysfunction across generations [ 96 97 98 99 4.4.2. Impact of Obesity on Spermatozoa Through Histone Modification Histones represent a family of highly basic nuclear proteins enriched with lysine and arginine amino acids that play fundamental roles in eukaryotic chromatin organization. These evolutionarily conserved proteins are categorized into five primary classes (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and undergo various post-translational modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, which dynamically regulate their interactions with DNA. These changes modulate how tightly DNA is packed, thereby regulating the binding of transcription factors and ultimately controlling gene activity [ 100 Deshpande et al. demonstrated that diet-induced obesity results in the dysregulation of histone modifications within testicular cells, affecting both transcriptionally activating marks (H3K4me3, H3ac, H4ac) and repressive marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3). In contrast, obesity of genetic origin selectively alters the levels of acetylated histones [ 101 102 103 104 4.4.3. The Impact of Obesity on Sperm RNA Environmental factors such as inadequate nutrition, psychological stress, and exposure to toxic substances have been shown to alter the RNA profile of paternal sperm, thereby affecting the phenotype of the offspring [ 105 106 107 Prolonged obesity in male murine models induces substantial modifications in sperm miRNA expression patterns [ 108 109 110 111 112 A comparative analysis revealed distinct expression profiles of sperm-derived small non-coding RNAs—including microRNAs (miRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA) fragments—between obese and lean male subjects. Wang et al. specifically reported dysregulation in several piRNA species, with significant expression differences identified in piR-31115, piR-33044, piR-36378, piR-36707, and piR-57942 [ 113 51 4.5. Intestinal Microbiota The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the development of obesity and metabolic disorders. Moreover, the gut microbiota and its metabolites possess the ability to influence and regulate multiple organs beyond the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the male reproductive system [ 114 115 116 117 118 119 4.6. Oxidative Stress Wang et al. conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis examining the relationship between obesity and male semen characteristics [ 120 121 122 123 124 68 Oxidative stress has been recognized as a key factor inducing alterations in mitochondrial function, a condition commonly termed mitochondrial dysfunction [ 125 52 79 126 127 128 5. Intervention Measures 5.1. Weight Loss Weight reduction has been demonstrated to ameliorate endocrine abnormalities in obese men, evidenced by increased serum testosterone levels and enhanced sexual function [ 70 129 129 130 131 5.2. Weight Loss Drugs Obesity adversely affects male fertility by disrupting the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, resulting in altered levels of testosterone and other reproductive hormones [ 132 84 133 134 135 Obese males often present with reduced testosterone levels; however, this finding alone does not warrant the initiation of testosterone replacement therapy. Administration of exogenous testosterone has been shown to suppress spermatogenesis. Research on hormonal contraceptive methods indicates that most men regain normal sperm production within one year after cessation of treatment. Clomiphene citrate has been recognized as a safe and effective therapeutic option for men aiming to preserve fertility potential [ 136 137 5.3. Regulate Intestinal Microbiota An increased prevalence of Prevotella species in semen has been correlated with oligozoospermia and asthenozoospermia in the context of obesity [ 114 115 138 139 5.4. Improve Oxidative Stress Extensive research has demonstrated that various dietary natural polyphenols, particularly flavonoids derived from fruits, vegetables, and edible plants, significantly influence mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis, as well as the regulation of ROS homeostasis [ 140 141 142 6. Conclusions Obesity has experienced a significant increase in prevalence over recent decades, and the detrimental effects it has on the human body are increasingly being highlighted. Body fat distribution patterns represent an important determinant of metabolic and reproductive health risks. In males, excessive adiposity adversely affects multiple aspects of reproductive function, including erectile physiology, spermatogenesis, and transgenerational health outcomes. These effects are mediated through interconnected pathways involving hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis dysregulation, systemic and local inflammatory responses, scrotal hyperthermia, epigenetic reprogramming, gut microbiome alterations, and oxidative stress accumulation. Notably, microRNAs in germ cells are restored through physical exercise. This review proposed improved strategies and treatment approaches for preventing and managing obesity-related low male fertility. Notably, implementing dietary improvements, engaging in regular exercise, and adopting healthier eating habits represent effective approaches for reducing obesity and its detrimental impact on male reproductive function. This review recognizes several limitations. In particular, it has predominantly presented recent relevant studies without performing a systematic analysis of their conflicting outcomes. Further research is necessary to substantiate these findings; nevertheless, this review provides a basis for developing various research avenues. Additionally, it delineates optimized intervention strategies and therapeutic approaches for managing obesity-related male subfertility.

WAT is predominantly distributed in the abdominal and thoracic regions, as well as within the gluteofemoral muscles. In contrast, BAT is primarily localized in the clavicular, scapular, and paraspinal areas. Beige adipose tissue is chiefly located on the posterior aspect of the neck and subcutaneously along the lateral sides of the spine. Figure 2 The impact of obesity on male fertility.
