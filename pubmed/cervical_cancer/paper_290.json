Purpose The primary aim of this study is to explore distinct patterns of post-traumatic growth (PTG) and fear of cancer progression (FOP) among breast cancer patients through latent profile analysis (LPA). Additionally, we assessed the differences in demographic and disease-related factors among breast cancer patients with varying patterns. Finally, we examined the influence of socio-demographic, disease-related, social support, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) factors on the varying patterns, aiming to assist healthcare providers in developing more effective psychological care strategies for breast cancer patients. Method A questionnaire survey was conducted on 752 breast cancer patients. Latent profile analysis was employed to explore the patterns of post-traumatic growth and fear of cancer progression in these patients, and multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictive factors for the different patterns. Results Based on the fit indices of latent class analysis, a three-class model was identified as the optimal solution, which included the Resisting group, Struggling group, and Growth group. In the Resisting group (24.33%), patients reported low levels of post-traumatic growth and high levels of fear of cancer progression; in the Struggling group (46.14%), patients exhibited moderate levels of post-traumatic growth and low levels of fear of cancer progression; in the Growth group (29.52%), patients demonstrated high levels of post-traumatic growth and moderate levels of fear of cancer progression. Additionally, the multiple logistic regression analysis reveals that marital status, place of residence, education level, disease stage, social support, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder levels in breast cancer patients serve as significant factors influencing the distinct patterns of post-traumatic growth and fear of progression. Conclusions This study suggests that there is heterogeneity in the PTG and FOP patterns in breast cancer patients. It provides a research basis for promoting the psychological recovery of breast cancer patients and highlights the importance of focusing on the positive effects of PTG while mitigating the negative impact of FOP. Healthcare providers can implement targeted nursing interventions based on the different patterns observed in breast cancer patients. breast cancer patients post-traumatic growth fear of disease progression latent profile analysis positive psychology The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Of these, 24.1% were reported in China. Furthermore, breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer incidence among women in China ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 However, patients exhibiting low levels of PTG may experience negative psychological outcomes, including a fear of cancer progression (FOP). FOP refers to a psychological state in which patients experience fear or concern about the recurrence or progression of a disease. Dysfunctional fear of cancer progression can lead to the development of negative psychological conditions such as depression and anxiety in patients ( 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Previous studies have extensively explored the factors influencing PTG or FOP, yet there has been limited investigation into the factors affecting the combined patterns of PTG and FOP ( 16 17 18 19 20 The Theory of Unpleasant Symptoms (TOUS) posits that physiological, psychological, and environmental factors influence an individual’s development. It consists of three main components: symptoms, symptom influencers, and symptom outcomes. The factors affecting symptoms primarily include physiological, psychological, and environmental aspects. These three factors are interrelated and mutually influence each other, collectively associated with the manifestation of symptoms ( 21 22 23 24 The application of LPA to explore the PTG and FOP patterns in breast cancer patients contributes to: (a) examining the levels of PTG and FOP across different patterns in breast cancer patients; (b) evaluating the demographic and disease-related differences among breast cancer patients in different patterns; and (c) investigating whether factors such as social support, anxiety, depression, and PTSD levels may influence the likelihood of different patterns in breast cancer patients. The research was primarily guided by three key hypotheses. Hypothesis 1: There are three patterns of PTG and FOP in breast cancer patients, namely mild PTG/high FOP, moderate PTG/moderate FOP, and high PTG/low FOP. Hypothesis 2: Marital status, place of residence, educational level, cancer stage, perceived social support, anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms are significant predictors of PTG and FOP patterns. Hypothesis 3: The profile characterized by mild PTG and high FOP is expected to be associated with the highest levels of psychological distress. Our research findings may contribute to the development of targeted nursing interventions by healthcare professionals, aimed at promoting both the psychological and physical well-being of breast cancer patients. Methods Participants This cross-sectional study, conducted between 25 July and 10 November 2024, involved 785 breast cancer patients hospitalized in several large tertiary hospitals in northern Anhui Province, China. A total of 785 questionnaires were distributed using a non-random sampling method. Of these, 752 valid responses were received, resulting in a valid response rate of 95.8%. The criteria for inclusion in this study were: 1) Pathological diagnosis of breast cancer; 2) Age ≥ 18 years; 3) No history of other malignancies or prior treatments; 4) Alert and able to communicate effectively without any communication impairments. Exclusion criteria included: 1) Recent use of sedative medications or the presence of metastatic cancer; 2) Co-existing severe cardiac, hepatic, or renal dysfunction; 3) Impaired hearing or speech capabilities that would preclude participation in the study. This research obtained approval from the Ethics Committee of Bengbu Medical University (Approval No. 2024-279), and all participants gave written informed consent. Data collecting method Before completing the questionnaire, trained members of the research team provided standardized instructions to participants, explaining the objectives and significance of the study. Patient data on social determinants and biological-behavioral factors were retrieved from the electronic medical records. Inpatients completed the questionnaire on-site, and the completed forms were immediately collected. An on-site review was conducted to identify any missing responses, and participants were prompted to provide any omitted information without delay. Following the completion of questionnaire collection, a dual verification process was conducted by two researchers. This process adhered strictly to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and appropriate follow-up questions were posed to clarify any ambiguous statements provided by the patients. Any errors or omissions were promptly corrected and supplemented. After all the questionnaires have been collected, they will undergo a dual verification process by two individuals to eliminate invalid responses, thereby ensuring the authenticity and accuracy of the research data. Measures Sociodemographic and disease-related variables The design was developed through a literature review by the researchers and consultation with clinical nursing experts, and it consists of two sections: demographic information and disease-related data. The demographic data encompasses variables such as age, marital status, educational level, monthly income per capita, Occupied zone, engagement in activities (e.g., reading, painting) within the past month, physical exercise, occupation, and average nightly sleep duration of cancer patients. The disease-related data includes factors such as whether chemotherapy was administered and the cancer stage, and the disease stage is classified as I to IV. Post-traumatic growth scale This tool was originally developed by Tedeschi and Calhoun, and subsequently adapted by Chinese scholar Wang Ji ( 25 Fear of disease progression scale The scale was initially developed by Mehnert et al. ( 26 27 Social support rating scale This research employed the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) created by Xiao Shuiyuan in 1986 ( 28 Hospital anxiety and depression scale The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), developed by Zigmond et al. in 1983, is a self-report scale used to screen for anxiety and depression in hospitalized patients ( 29 Post-traumatic stress disorder scale The measurement tool was created by the Behavioral Science Department at the U.S. National Center for PTSD, grounded in the DSM-IV criteria ( 30 26 Statistical methods This study utilized SPSS 27.0 and Mplus 8.3 for statistical analysis. To address missing data, the study employed the method of multiple imputation. This approach generates a complete dataset by using model estimation and repeated simulations. Descriptive statistics were computed using mean ± standard deviation for continuous data that met the assumption of normality, and frequencies and percentages for categorical or ordinal data. To maximize the interpretability of various solutions and facilitate model convergence, the five dimensions of the PTG scale and the two dimensions of the FOP scale were employed as indicators in the LPA. Given that PTG employs a 6-point Likert scale and FOP utilizes a 5-point Likert scale, and considering the differences in the scoring ranges of each dimension for both FOP and PTG, the scores for all seven variables were first converted into T-scores to facilitate interpretation. The T-score was calculated as: T = 50 + 10 × Z, where Z = (X − x 31 32 The optimal classification model for PTG and FOP patterns in breast cancer patients was determined based on the results of latent profile analysis. A Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between PTG and FOP. Chi-square tests or one-way ANOVA were performed using SPSS 27.0 to compare the differences in demographic data, disease-related information, social support, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder across different categories. An unordered multinomial logistic regression model was employed, with the latent categories of PTG and FOP patterns in breast cancer patients as the dependent variables. Factors exhibiting statistically significant differences in univariate analyses were used as independent variables to investigate the factors influencing different categories of breast cancer patients, with a significance threshold set at P < 0.05. In the multicollinearity test, this study utilizes the variance inflation factor (VIF) as a criterion for assessing collinearity. Specifically, VIF > 5 indicates the potential existence of multicollinearity among the explanatory variables, whereas VIF < 5 suggests the absence of multicollinearity issues ( 33 Results Sociodemographic characteristics A total of 785 breast cancer patients were enrolled in this study, of which 752 completed questionnaires were deemed valid, corresponding to a validity rate of 95.8%.

Discussion The characteristics of different patterns of PTG and FOP in breast cancer patients In this study, we conclude that the three-class model is the most effective and accurate for breast cancer patients exhibiting different patterns of PTG and FOP. In this study, based on the characteristics of each model, three distinct PTG and FOP patterns were named: the Resisting group (Low PTG/High FOP), the Struggling Group (Moderate PTG/Low FOP), and the Growth Group (High PTG/Moderate FOP). These patterns resemble those identified in previous studies concerning post-traumatic stress symptoms and post-traumatic growth in breast cancer patients ( 34 Our research findings indicate that 29.52% of breast cancer patients belong to the Growth group, characterized by high levels of PTG and moderate FOP, while 24.33% of patients belong to the Resisting group, characterized by low levels of PTG and high levels of FOP. The underlying cause of this phenomenon could be that individuals who undergo PTG often demonstrate more advanced emotional regulation and coping strategies in response to stress. Through constructive reflection on traumatic experiences, such patients may become more adept at managing and reducing anxiety associated with the potential recurrence of cancer ( 35 36 37 Predictive factors influencing the PTG and FOP patterns of breast cancer patients Physiological dimension The study found that patients with stage I and stage III breast cancer were more likely to be categorized into the Struggling group and Growth groups. This phenomenon may be because stage I breast cancer patients, with their better prognosis and higher chances of cure, face fewer physiological and psychological challenges. As a result, they are more able to approach the future positively. This cognitive shift helps patients face future challenges with confidence, draw strength from their trauma, and thus reduce the fear of cancer recurrence ( 38 39 Psychological dimension This study found that patients with higher levels of anxiety are more likely to be classified into the Resisting group. Related studies have shown that the anxiety levels of breast cancer patients are closely associated with PTG and FOP. Anxiety is significantly associated with lower levels of PTG in breast cancer patients, potentially reflecting difficulties in trauma processing and reduced likelihood of PTG development. Additionally, higher anxiety levels exacerbate the degree of FOP in these patients ( 40 41 42 43 Our study also found that patients with a higher degree of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are more likely to be classified into the Resisting group. Cancer patients often experience trauma-related symptoms, making them more susceptible to developing PTSD ( 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 Environmental dimension Our study reveals that married breast cancer patients are more likely to be categorized into the Growth group, indicating that marital status may serve as a predictor of three distinct patterns of PTG and FOP in these patients. The possible cause of this phenomenon may be that, compared to unmarried patients, married breast cancer patients communicate more frequently with their spouses, enabling them to more deeply perceive the support from their partners ( 51 52 53 54 In this study, breast cancer patients with ≤ 6 years of education and those living in rural areas are more likely to be categorized into the Resisting group. Studies suggest that the level of education in breast cancer patients is positively correlated with PTG. Individuals with higher educational attainment tend to approach problems from a more comprehensive perspective and demonstrate a more optimistic attitude toward negative life events. In contrast, patients with lower education levels have fewer cognitive resources to cope with stress and are less able to engage in deeper reflection on traumatic experiences ( 55 56 38 57 Furthermore, our study further reveals that patients with higher levels of social support are more likely to be categorized into the Struggling group and growth group. Previous studies have demonstrated that social support plays a critical role in fostering PTG ( 58 59 60 30 61 Clinical significance Firstly, our study integrates PTG and FOP into a unified model for breast cancer patients, aiming to investigate the distinct characteristics of breast cancer patients in different models. This approach highlights the heterogeneity of the condition and offers novel perspectives for clinicians in the context of psychological rehabilitation. Secondly, our findings suggest that clinicians should pay greater attention to breast cancer patients who are unmarried, live in rural areas, have lower levels of education and social support, and exhibit higher levels of anxiety and PTSD. These individuals tend to fall into the Resisting group, which is characterized by low levels of PTG and high levels of FOP, potentially leading to adverse psychological outcomes. Finally, from a treatment perspective, clinicians should consider the distinct patterns of breast cancer patients when developing and tailoring personalized treatments. For example, patients in the Growth group, who exhibit higher levels of PTG, may be better equipped to cope with trauma. Therefore, routine care should suffice for this group without the need for additional psychological interventions. For patients in the Struggling group, moderate social activities can help build a support system, enhance self-efficacy, and reduce FOP levels. In the Resisting group, interventions should prioritize PTG needs, with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) as the primary approach ( 62 Limitation There are several limitations to our study. First, this is a cross-sectional study, meaning it does not account for the changes in PTG and FOP over time in breast cancer patients. Second, the sample data were all derived from Anhui Province, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Finally, our study did not take into account other psychological variables that might influence the results or the patterns of PTG and FOP among patients. In addition, only self-report questionnaires were used. Therefore, future research could involve expanding the sample size and diversity, conducting longitudinal and qualitative studies, and employing latent class growth modeling to explore the causal relationships between PTG, FOP, and longitudinal trajectory categories. Conclusion Our study identified three latent classes of PTG among breast cancer patients: the Resisting group, the Struggling group, and the Growth group. Additionally, our findings indicated that marital status, place of residence, educational level, disease stage, SRSS, anxiety, and PTSD levels were influential factors affecting the patterns of PTG and FOP in breast cancer patients.
