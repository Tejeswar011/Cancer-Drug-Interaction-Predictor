From its serendipitous identification in Escherichia coli  1  2  3 This review focuses on pathogens – including viruses, bacteria and fungi – encompassing both CRISPR‐based detection technologies and targeted anti‐pathogen strategies. Traditional nucleic acid diagnostic techniques include culturing techniques, polymerase chain reaction (PCR),  4  5  6  7  8  9 Emerging methods such as biosensors offer potential solutions but still face challenges in achieving the desired level of selectivity at a lower cost.  10  11  12  9 However, the translation of CRISPR diagnostics from controlled laboratories to real‐world environments reveals critical challenges. For instance, field studies in sub‐Saharan Africa highlighted a 63% performance drop in Cas14‐based assays under high humidity, emphasising the fragility of enzymatic activity in non‐ideal conditions.  13 This review comprehensively examines CRISPR‐driven diagnostics – including viruses, bacteria and fungi – by exploring both CRISPR‐based detection technologies and targeted anti‐pathogen strategies. It further dissects the molecular mechanisms of CRISPR tools, compares their clinical efficacy with traditional methods and highlights cutting‐edge innovations such as amplification‐free detection and AI integration. Ultimately, we argue that CRISPR diagnostics must advance beyond technical refinement towards ecological adaptability, ensuring that precision medicine serves as a bridge – rather than a barrier – to global health equity. 2 MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF CRISPR/CAS SYSTEM AND ITS CLASSIFICATION The CRISPR/Cas system is a powerful tool for gene editing, mainly utilising the process of homology‐directed repair (HDR),  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21 The CRISPR/Cas system's versatility has enabled the development of innovative diagnostic platforms, including the Specific High Sensitivity Enzyme Reporter Unlocking (SHERLOCK)  22  3  23  24 Despite the extensive utilisation of PCR for nucleic acid detection purposes,  25  26  18  25  24  27 2.1 Mechanisms of CRISPR/Cas system In addition to its use in gene editing, the ability of the CRISPR/Cas system to recognise and detect specific DNA sequences extends its potential applications to bacterial detection. Through the exploitation of the activity of Cas proteins to precisely cleave DNA under the guidance of sequence‐specific CRISPR RNA (gRNA), researchers have developed a bacterial assay that is characterised by high specificity and sensitivity.  28  21 2.1.1 Target recognition: Complementary pairing of crRNA and target nucleic acids The function of CRISPR RNA (crRNA) is to act as a guide molecule, with the capability of recognising specific sequences of target nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) through base complementary pairing. In its natural state, crRNA is transcribed and processed from the CRISPR motif and carries a spacer region sequence that is complementary to the exogenous invasive nucleic acid.  29 16S rRNA  30  31 2.1.2 Enzymatic activity trigger: Conformational change and trans‐cleavage of Cas proteins Upon target recognition, Cas proteins undergo conformational changes that activate their nuclease activities, including cis‐cleavage (target‐bound nucleic acids) and trans‐cleavage (non‐specific cleavage of surrounding nucleic acids). Cas12, for instance, has been observed to induce collateral cleavage activity upon the recognition of target DNA, in addition to non‐specific trans‐cleavage of single‐stranded DNA (ssDNA).  3  22  32 2.2 Comparative analysis of CRISPR tools 2.2.1 Cas9 CRISPR/Cas9 systems have become versatile tools for nucleic acid detection, especially in the second class of CRISPR/Cas systems.  33 2 1  34  35  36 FIGURE 1 Detection technologies based on the CRISPR‐Cas9 system. The application of CRISPR/Cas9 in detection encompasses dCas9 detection using enzyme‐free amplification and HCR chromogenicity, as well as cellular in situ hybridisation using Cas9 specificity. Furthermore, graphene‐based wearable real‐time monitoring of target nucleic acid electrical signals is also possible. The inherent inability of CRISPR/Cas systems to directly amplify nucleic acids or produce detectable signals necessitates their utilisation in conjunction with alternative amplification techniques or complementary sensing technologies.  37  38 Staphylococcus aureus  39 In addition to conventional nucleic acid amplification techniques, the integration of CRISPR/Cas9 with electrosensors has facilitated the development of innovative detection platforms. These platforms, including microneedle‐graphene‐based wearable systems, facilitate real‐time, non‐invasive monitoring of mutant genes  40  41  42  43  44 The design of sgRNAs remains a pivotal factor in determining the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 RNP (ribonucleoprotein) systems, which poses a significant challenge in the development of effective detection systems. Nevertheless, advances in sgRNA design will provide a solid foundation for the future development of CRISPR/Cas‐based nucleic acid detection technologies. Despite the evident potential of Cas9 technology in the domain of bacterial detection, it is imperative to acknowledge the inherent limitations of the technology, which are pivotal to its effective application and further development. Cas9 has been observed to exhibit off‐target effects, which have the potential to impact diagnostic accuracy, manifesting as false positives resulting from DSBs and design flaws in sgRNAs that can compromise specificity. Off‐target effects represent a significant concern in the field of translational medicine concerning Cas9. Research in this area has identified two primary factors contributing to these effects: firstly, the ‘lenient’ requirements of Cas9 for PAM sequences, which results in the formation of suboptimal binding sites, and secondly, the mismatch tolerance exhibited by Cas9 itself. In order to assess off‐target effects, a range of methods have been developed, including nuclease binding assays.  45 Conventional detection methodologies reliant upon single‐gene recognition are susceptible to the occurrence of false positives, a phenomenon attributable to off‐target binding.  46 mecA  46  47 At present, the application of Cas9 technology in clinical settings is primarily focused on therapeutic applications, with only a limited number of examples of technologies related to detection, and even fewer examples of bacterial detection. Among cases involving the utilisation of CRISPR detection technology in clinical translation, the most salient example in recent years is the SHERLOCK detection technology case, which will be discussed in the following section. Certain Cas9 technologies are already being utilised in the domain of gene therapy within clinical settings. A notable example is the in vivo gene editing technology NTLA‐2001.  48 2.2.2 Cas12 (e.g. Cas12a, Cas12b) In addition to Cas9‐based nucleic acid assays, the CRISPR/Cas12 system is gaining attention as an important tool for nucleic acid diagnostics, with a target type of DNA (activation of the trans‐cleavage activity of incidentally cleaved ssDNA after specific cleavage of the target DNA).  49 2 FIGURE 2 Detection technologies based on the CRISPR‐Cas12 system. The utilisation of CRISPR/Cas12 detection technology offers considerable potential for application in clinical samples and large‐scale detection, through nucleic acid amplification or direct detection on paper‐based substrates, or through the use of gold nanoparticles for rapid, efficient, and cost‐effective detection. The combination of Cas12 with isothermal amplification technologies (e.g. RPA, ERA, LAMP) has been demonstrated to enhance the sensitivity of the assay, enabling the detection of trace nucleic acids without the necessity for complex pre‐amplification. For instance, the RPA/CRISPR/Cas12a platform for Pseudomonas aeruginosa  50 Mycobacterium tuberculosis M. tuberculosis  49  51 Cas12 assays detect crude samples in ≤60 min, enabling rapid diagnostics in clinical, food and environmental settings. For instance, the presence of Chlamydia pneumoniae  31 Salmonella Salmonella typhimurium Salmonella enteritidis  52  53  54 Cas12 facilitates the concurrent identification of multiple pathogens within a single tube or microarray platform, such as a dual system integrating Cas12a (DNA detection) and Cas13a (RNA detection) for the simultaneous detection of maize Stewartia (bacteria) and maize dwarf mosaic virus, with detection limits of 1 × 10 −6 −7  55 Klebsiella pneumoniae  56  32  57 In order to enhance the performance of Cas12, researchers have focused on improving system components. This has included the use of dual synthetic mismatch CRISPR/Cas12a (dsmCRISPR) and AIOD CRISPR technologies, which utilise dual PAM site crRNAs with a view to reducing cost and increasing specificity.  58  59  60  61  62 Concerns have been raised regarding the efficacy of Cas12‐based detection technologies. These concerns primarily encompass three areas: the initial signal conversion efficiency, the activation process and the interference of background signals. Additionally, issues have been identified with the stability of signal molecules and the interference of the matrix in complex samples.  63  64  60 Given the strong technical compatibility and inherent advantages of Cas12 detection technology, it is theoretically feasible to develop a Cas12 detection system similar to PCR that targets specific bacterial nucleic acids, as well as specific bacterial proteins or glycoproteins. This would enable these technologies to better advance towards clinical translation. For example, developing universal paper‐based portable test strips or low‐cost reagent kits to facilitate testing in remote areas can adapt to different testing scenarios. During the process of advancing the clinical translation of these technologies, regulatory oversight must clearly define risk stratification while establishing dynamic communication mechanisms to address issues such as how to quantify cross‐reactivity in multiplex testing. Clinical validation of the technology requires scientific design, including multi‐centre data collection and validation in complex scenarios. Intellectual property issues and clear commercialisation pathways must also be addressed. Relevant case studies can draw on Mammoth Biosciences' LAMP‐Cas12a cascade reaction technology for tuberculosis detection. The company is also advancing its CRISPR/Cas14‐based detection technology, whose characteristics will be elaborated upon in subsequent discussions. In conclusion, the CRISPR/Cas12 system, with its ultra‐high sensitivity, rapid detection and multi‐adaptation capability, has demonstrated significant advantages in the detection of bacteria, viruses and other pathogens. The portable platform combined with isothermal amplification technology provides an efficient solution for primary healthcare, food safety and environmental monitoring. 2.2.3 Cas13 (e.g. Cas13a) Cas13 is an RNA‐inducible RNase consisting of four variants: Cas13a, Cas13b, Cas13c and Cas13d. Its structural characteristics are defined by the presence of two higher eukaryotic and prokaryotic nucleotide (HEPN)‐binding domains, which facilitate the cleavage of ssRNA molecules. Cas13's unique collateral cleavage activity allows it to target and cleave non‐specific RNA around the intended RNA target.  65 The development of Cas13‐based technologies has become a significant focus in the domain of nucleic acid testing, particularly in the context of RNA‐targeted diagnostics. While the aforementioned strategies bear similarities to the CRISPR/Cas9 and Cas12 systems, often requiring integration with nucleic acid amplification techniques, Cas13 specifically targets RNA and therefore requires additional steps. These include reverse transcription of the RNA virus to DNA, followed by amplification and transcription back to RNA for detection.  66 3  67  22  68  69  70 FIGURE 3 Detection technologies based on the CRISPR‐Cas13 system. The utilisation of CRISPR/Cas13 in detection encompasses a range of immunology‐based methodologies, including antibody fixation and electrical signal binding, isothermal amplification, and lateral flow paper strip readout. Additionally, it involves micrometre‐scale well array chip (mChip)‐based oversized samples and multiplexed pathogen detection methods. The integration of Cas13 technology with visualisation techniques and portable devices has led to a substantial enhancement in the field's capacity for virus detection. For instance, the RPA‐CRISPR/EsCas13d platform, developed for pseudorabies virus, integrates RPA with the trans‐cutting activity of Cas13d on a dual‐readout portable platform, achieving a detection limit of as low as 1 copy/µL. The platform supports side‐by‐side chromatography strips or fluorescent visualisation, enabling the completion of detection in less than 1 h with quantitative real‐time PCR (qPCR) results. It is considered suitable for pig farming and public health monitoring in remote areas without complicated equipment.  71 Neisseria gonorrhoeae  72 The integration of expression monitoring of carbapenem‐resistant genes with the RPA‐Cas13a system facilitates a molecular level of support for real‐time assessment of bacterial drug resistance with attomolar detection limits and bedside diagnosis in less than 50 min.  73 The combination of Cas13 with electrochemical biosensors and digital bioassay technologies serves to extend the functionality of Cas13, thereby enabling efficient and rapid detection with minimal amplification. For instance, the CRISPR‐based amplification‐free digital RNA assay (SATORI)  74  75 M. tuberculosis  76 Advancements in Cas13 technology have also facilitated simultaneous detection and high‐throughput analysis of multiple targets. The Combined Array Reaction for Multiplexed Evaluation of Nucleic Acids (CARMEN) platform, when employed in conjunction with Cas13 (CARMEN‐Cas13), facilitates the robust detection of thousands of target pairs on a single array, thereby significantly reducing the cost of detection and supporting high‐throughput screening. This capacity is of particular importance for comprehensive pathogen surveillance and public health monitoring.  77 In addition to the detection of pathogens, Cas13 has been employed in the domain of live cell imaging and gene expression analysis. The live cell fluorescence in situ hybridisation (LiveFISH) technique employs Cas13 to monitor RNA and chromosome dynamics in living cells. This method employs fluorescent oligonucleotides to visualise RNA transcripts and genomic DNA in real time, thereby providing insight into gene expression and chromosomal disorders. Furthermore, Cas13 can be utilised for single‐cell sequencing to target RNA perturbation. CaRPool‐seq (Cas13 RNA Perturb‐seq) is one such method that enhances the accuracy and efficiency of combinatorial single‐cell gene perturbation studies.  78 The potential of Cas13 technology in the field of bacterial diagnostics has yet to be fully realised. Future research could focus on optimising RNA extraction efficiency, reducing background signal interference and developing more convenient amplification‐free assays. The development of isothermal amplification technology, microfluidic chips and smartphone reading technology has led to the prediction of a significant increase in the use of Cas13 in a variety of applications, including the detection of RNA viruses, the monitoring of drug‐resistant genes and the diagnosis of bacterial infections. This is particularly relevant in the context of preventing and controlling infectious diseases in resource‐poor areas, where Cas13 is considered to be highly advantageous due to its convenience and efficiency. It is inevitable that Cas13, as part of the CRISPR/Cas detection technology, will encounter issues of non‐specific detection. A number of relevant studies have revealed that the collateral cleavage of activated Cas13  22  79  80 Cas13a's collateral cleavage activity is only activated after the formation of the crRNA‐target RNA double strand,  81  82  22 The most clinically relevant example of CRISPR/Cas13‐based detection technology is the SHERLOCK technology. As of July 2025, the company responsible for SHERLOCK has made significant progress in the commercialisation of CRISPR‐related detection technologies, including technology licensing and collaboration, patent strategy and technology extension. The company has advanced comprehensive clinical trials and submitted an FDA application to achieve clinical translation by leveraging its technological advantages. In addition to SHERLOCK's FDA certification application, other relevant cases include Sense Biodetection's VerosCOVID‐19 test, which has undergone multi‐centre clinical trials,  83 2.2.4 Other Cas variants and emerging tools Cas14a1 overcomes the dependence of traditional CRISPR on PAM sequences by single‐primer isothermal amplification of integrated biosensors (SPCas) to achieve ultra‐sensitive detection of Salmonella typhi  13 H. pylori  84 Furthermore, the Cas14a1‐mediated pathogen nucleic acid detection platform is employed. As demonstrated in Figure 4 Streptococcus pyogenes E. typhimurium 3 FIGURE 4 Detection technologies based on the CRISPR‐Cas14 system. The employment of CRISPR/Cas14 in the detection process, in conjunction with the single primer isothermal amplification (SPIA) system, facilitates the identification of target pathogen nucleic acids. The Cas14a universal bacterial diagnostic platform  85 CasX, a constituent of the V‐type CRISPR system, possesses a compact protein structure and flexible PAM recognition properties, rendering it suitable for the development of miniaturised detection tools. Despite its current paucity of research, the potential of this method for the detection of Gram‐negative bacteria has been explored in preliminary studies, and it is conceivable that it may become a fundamental component of portable detection platforms in the future.  28 In recent studies, CasX has demonstrated the potential for application in the domains of highly specific bacterial typing, the detection of drug‐resistant bacteria and portable testing. The process of DNA cutting requires a minimum of 17 PAM proximal nucleotide matches to initiate stable binding, thereby enabling the detection of pathogens with a high degree of specificity. This is achieved by designing sgRNAs that target drug‐resistant genes (e.g. the bla family) or germline markers (e.g. 16S rRNA).  86 The advantage of CasX in terms of its small size renders it suitable for use in the construction of portable detection platforms, in conjunction with nanoparticles, microfluidic chips and other vectors. Optimisation of sgRNAs (e.g. sgRNAv2) to enhance their binding stability to nucleic acids,  87  88  88 Cas3, the core protein of the type I CRISPR system, has been demonstrated to possess the ability to target deconvolution and cleave double‐stranded DNA. The primary applications of this technology are in the domains of gene editing and the degradation of pathogen genomes. In the context of bacterial detection, it can be employed in conjunction with nucleic acid enrichment techniques to facilitate the efficient capture of low‐abundance pathogen DNA. However, the prevailing focus of current research endeavours pertains to the analysis of its underlying mechanism, with the exploration of its potential applications in clinical detection remaining in its nascent stages.  29 In context of Cas3‐related research, Type I‐A has exhibited favourable performance in the domain of detection, for instance. The HASTE assay platform is an innovative technique that utilises the ability of Cas3 to non‐specifically cleave nearby ssDNA reporter molecules following binding to the target DNA. This platform enables highly sensitive detection of dsDNA/ssDNA down to 1 pM, ssRNA at 0.1–1 nM and ssRNA at 0. The concentration of 1–1 nM is to be used in conjunction with the quantification of fluorescence and the testing of lateral flow chromatography strips. The ssRNA is to be activated by heat in a manner that is compatible with the processing of high‐temperature samples. The multi‐form detection supports the quantification of fluorescence and the testing of lateral flow chromatography strips. The low background detection is to be used to avoid false positives. Its potential applications include pathogen detection and multiplex testing.  89 The CRISPR/Cas system has evolved to encompass a variety of detection tools, each distinguished by its distinct mechanism of target recognition and enzyme activity triggered by different Cas proteins. Among these, Cas9 functions as an auxiliary element in the detection of drug‐resistant genes, while Cas12 and Cas13 have emerged as the predominant technologies for the detection of DNA and RNA pathogens, respectively. Furthermore, the emergence of variants such as Cas14 has transcended conventional limitations, paving the way for novel PAM‐free detection and ultra‐sensitive diagnostic methodologies. The synergistic development of these tools has led to significant advancements in bacterial detection technology, resulting in rapid, accurate and portable detection methods. 3 SYSTEMATIC COMPARISON BETWEEN CRISPR/CAS AND TRADITIONAL BACTERIAL DETECTION TECHNIQUES Table 1 S. aureus Salmonella noroviruses TABLE 1 Comparison of CRISPR‐Cas detection technologies in clinical and field applications.

NGS has been demonstrated to be capable of detecting multiple pathogens in high‐throughput settings. However, its sensitivity is limited when it comes to low‐abundance pathogens, such as SARS‐CoV‐2, where a cycle threshold (Ct) value greater than 35 is required for detection. To enhance its diagnostic accuracy to 100%, the incorporation of CRISPR pre‐processing is necessary.  105  94  106  106  93 Table 2 TABLE 2 Performance comparison of other pathogen detection technologies.

For instance, the Cas13‐based SHERLOCK system has been granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) in the United States for the detection of new coronaviruses,  124  125  126 3.3 Clinical validation of empirical studies 3.3.1 Pathogen detection efficacy Innovations in molecular diagnostics are injecting new momentum into the prevention and control of infectious diseases. The utilisation of CRISPR‐SERS conjugation technology in the context of M. tuberculosis  127 It has been demonstrated that this assay achieves 100% accuracy in sputum samples and is capable of reducing the identification of multidrug‐resistant tuberculosis from the traditional ‘weekly’ level to the ‘hourly’ level.  49  128 For SARS‐CoV‐2 detection, the RT‐RAA‐Cas13a system complements the scenario with amplification‐free technology: the former achieves a portable detection of 1 copy/µL in 30 min through recombinant enzyme‐mediated amplification with the RNA shear property of Cas13a  124  129  130 It is anticipated that, in the next 3–5 years, the enhancement of the WHO certification system will result in a transformation of the global infectious disease prevention and control paradigm.  131  132  133 3.3.2 Drug‐resistant bacteria detection applications In the domain of clinical diagnostics, CRISPR‐Cas12a has been demonstrated to achieve simultaneous detection of 14 targets (attaining 100% concordance with PCR) of high‐risk HPV subtypes (16/18/31/33, etc.) through the utilisation of multiplexed gRNA array design and signal decoupling technology.  134  135  46 The capacity of CRISPR‐Cas12a to function across diverse domains is especially evident in the context of food safety monitoring.  60 invA Salmonella  136  137  138  139 3.4 Breakthroughs in cutting‐edge technologies 3.4.1 No amplification detection The development of a dual‐strand displacement probe with a hybridisation chain reaction signal amplification system enabled researchers to achieve amplification‐free direct detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA with a sensitivity of 0.47 copies/µL.  129  140  141 3.4.2 Portable device integration A smartphone‐integrated CRISPR detection system combines optical signal analysis (1 copy/µL sensitivity) with blockchain encryption to ensure secure data flow. Detection results are time‐stamped, encrypted via elliptic curve algorithms and stored on tamper‐proof blockchain nodes  93  93  142  142 3.4.3 Multiple testing platforms The microfluidic chip system developed utilising CRISPR‐Cas12a in conjunction with multiplexed nucleic acid amplification technology has achieved simultaneous identification of eight pathogens, including influenza A/B viruses,  143  144 3.4.4 Gene editing optimisation The engineered FnCas9 variant was subjected to reconstruction of the α‐helical structural domain and optimisation of the PAM recognition interface, which resulted in a significant 3.5‐fold enhancement in single‐base mismatch tolerance.  145  146 This precise identification technology has been successfully translated into clinical‐grade testing tools.  147  121  148  149  150 4 THE INNOVATIVE DIRECTION OF THE NEXT‐GENERATION CRISPR DETECTION TECHNOLOGY 4.1 Multiplex detection and high‐throughput platform The evolution of CRISPR‐enabled bacterial detection systems is focused on overcoming practical implementation barriers while achieving quantifiable reliability metrics,  8  151  152  153  152 AMR  154 With the breakthrough of microfluidic technology and digital CRISPR system, multiple detection is developing towards higher throughput and automation. For instance, the integration of microfluidic technology with CRISPR systems enables multiplex detection of five or more targets, achieving results in just 30 min.  155  156  157  158 4.2 Amplification‐free CRISPR detection: Towards simplified diagnostics In recent years, non‐amplified CRISPR detection technology has made significant breakthroughs in sensitivity, timeliness and clinical applicability through the collaborative innovation of multiple strategies. Taking the CRISPR‐Cascade system as an example, it achieves rapid diagnosis of bloodstream infections through precise control of cascade reactions, completing tests within 10 min with a plasma sample compliance rate of 98.7%.  159  160 norovirus/  161 S. aureus 3 r  162  163 2  164 IAV  165 4.3 Intelligent CRISPR systems The combination of artificial intelligence and CRISPR is reshaping the paradigm of diagnosis, CRISPR signal can be used with smart phones (the results are digitised and transmitted remotely), so that real‐time data analysis can be carried out. For instance, CrisprAIE system (Cas12a + aggregation induced luminescence probe Q‐dsDNA/AIEgens‐Q) can detect norovirus/  161  166 5 CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND TRANSLATIONAL CHALLENGES 5.1 Technical challenges 5.1.1 Inhibitor interference in complex sample pre‐processing The presence of inhibitors (such as mucins and haemoglobin) in clinical samples (like sputum and blood) significantly hampers the sensitivity and reliability of CRISPR‐based detection methods. Studies have demonstrated that mucins in sputum can reduce the activity of Cas12a by 50%,  167  168 To address these challenges, numerous contemporary studies have proposed innovative solutions to facilitate clinical translation: for instance, as previously mentioned, the DETECTR technology successfully enabled direct detection of HPV DNA in unprocessed clinical samples without nucleic acid extraction. This method exhibits remarkable tolerance to PCR inhibitors, significantly streamlining the sample pre‐treatment workflow by eliminating time‐consuming purification steps that may introduce sample loss or experimental variability.  3  169 K. pneumoniae  168  170 M. tuberculosis M. tuberculosis  49  128 5.1.2 Scalability bottlenecks in high‐throughput detection Current CRISPR platforms struggle to meet the demands of large‐scale clinical screening due to limitations in throughput (typically <50 samples per batch) and automation levels. Although microfluidic technology has significantly enhanced detection efficiency, it has also increased equipment costs by 30%.  156 Helicobacter pylori  156  171  172 E. coli 5.2 Implement obstacle analysis 5.2.1 Demand for multi‐centre clinical data The clinical translation of CRISPR diagnostic technology (CRISPR‐Dx) requires rigorous validation through multi‐centre trials. A CRISPR/Cas‐based diagnostic platform for high‐risk HPV exhibits 100% concordance with PCR while simultaneously detecting 14 types and is compatible with cervical exfoliated cell samples, delivering results within 1.5 h.  125  173  170  174 5.2.2 Regional regulatory differences There are significant discrepancies in the evaluation standards for CRISPR‐Dx between the FDA and EMA. The FDA mandates a detection specificity of >99.5%, while the EMA requires only 98%.  51  125 5.2.3 Cost competitiveness model Although the cost of a single CRISPR test can be as low as $2–5,  62  112  50  62  175 5.2.4 Lack of standardisation The sensitivity fluctuations of commercial kits (such as a 20% variance in Cas14 reagents) highlight issues like non‐transparent buffer formulations.  13  170  176 5.3 Translational medicine strategy 5.3.1 Collaborative innovation between industry, academia and research The clinical translation of CRISPR‐Dx technology relies on interdisciplinary collaboration and industrial chain integration. A one‐tube RPA‐CRISPR‐Cas12b‐based detection system enabled the specific detection of mcr‐1 and tet (X4). The transition from laboratory validation to pre‐commercial production was accomplished within 18 months, with the core effort being the joint optimisation of crRNA design and reaction systems by universities and companies.  173  144  177 5.3.2 Policy drivers and optimisation of regulatory frameworks Global regulatory agencies are promoting the implementation of CRISPR‐Dx through accelerated approval pathways. The FDA's ‘Breakthrough Device Program’ prioritises the review of HPV genotyping kits and allows the sharing of multi‐centre trial data to reduce redundant validation.  13  178  170 5.3.3 Technology dissemination and empowerment at the grassroots level In resource‐poor areas, low‐cost technology adaptation and localised training are key. Inkjet‐printed CRISPR biosensors  62  179 5.4 Ethics and biosafety The widespread application of CRISPR technology in pathogen detection and monitoring has improved diagnostic efficiency but has also raised significant ethical and biosafety concerns. In wastewater monitoring  180  181  181 Genetic barcodes associated with CRISPR (such as specific spacer sequences) could also be captured by environmental microorganisms, altering their evolutionary paths. For instance, artificially designed CRISPR arrays might be integrated by bacteriophages, resulting in unpredictable cascading effects within ecosystems. Furthermore, biosafety regulations for the global field application of CRISPR are still inadequate, posing risks of misuse, such as the reversal of crRNA designs from test kits for bioweapons development.  182 To mitigate the biosafety risks associated with CRISPR technology, the scientific community has proposed a multifaceted array of countermeasures in recent years. Technologically, Ye et al. developed self‐deactivating CRISPR systems using engineered Cas proteins (e.g. pH‐/temperature‐sensitive variants). Their design incorporates a TEV protease cleavage site in Cas9, enabling automated degradation after detection.  183  28  184 5.5 Future direction 5.5.1 Integrated ‘sample in‐result out’ system Next‐generation CRISPR diagnostic devices will integrate the entire process of nucleic acid extraction, amplification and detection. By adding fully automated nucleic acid magnetic bead‐extracted samples to a pre‐packaged centrifugal microfluidics chip, 48 samples can be tested automatically within 15–60 min at 60°C.  185  37  186 5.5.2 Powering global validation with integrated smart and sustainable technologies Standardised validation across diverse populations is essential to address geographical biases in pathogen variants and host genetic backgrounds. Future initiatives must prioritise inclusion of low‐income regions and establish open‐access databases (e.g. CRISPR‐Dx Global Hub) to share detection performance metrics, inhibitor interference profiles (e.g. heparin, haemoglobin) and resistant mutation hotspots impacting guide RNA binding.  187 AI‐driven CRISPR design platforms are revolutionising assay development. CRISPR‐GPT utilises a multi‐agent large language model framework, fine‐tuned on domain‐specific data, to automate the design of gene‐editing experiments. This system reduces the experimental planning workflow from several weeks to mere minutes while maintaining high accuracy and achieving editing efficiencies exceeding 80% in validation studies.  188  189  168  190 6 CONCLUSION The CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a transformative tool in the field of molecular diagnosis, offering unprecedented sensitivity, specificity and rapid detection capabilities. Through the dual mechanisms of programmable nucleic acid recognition and enzyme‐mediated signal amplification, CRISPR‐based assays surpass conventional PCR methods in workflow simplicity and cost‐effectiveness ($2–5 per test). Clinical validations demonstrate practical utility in detecting drug‐resistant bacteria and emerging viruses. Moreover, multiplex platforms enable simultaneous analysis of up to 14 targets, significantly expanding its application potential in complex sample detection. However, several challenges must be addressed in clinical translation, including sample matrix interference, standardisation gaps and regulatory disparities between regions. In the future, the convergence of CRISPR with synthetic biology, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence promises to attach fully automated ‘sample‐in‐result‐out’ systems and genome‐scale pathogen surveillance networks. Such advancements will not merely transform infectious disease management but empower decentralised healthcare in resource‐limited settings, marking a new era of precision diagnostics and global health equity.
