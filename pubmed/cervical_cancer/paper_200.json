Given the widespread neural involvement and combined volitional and reflexive control, many neurologic conditions can result in swallowing disorders (dysphagia). There is no classification framework for neurogenic dysphagia according to where dysfunction lies within the sensorimotor hierarchy. Thus, underlying neuropathology is not thoroughly considered during dysphagia assessment and rehabilitation. In this review, we explore neurogenic dysphagia through classical sensorimotor hierarchy and movement disorders terminology. We provide comprehensive evidence of dysphagia signs and symptoms in pure cases of movement disorders and discuss nuances related to assessing signs of neuropathology responsible for disordered oropharyngeal swallowing biomechanics. Appreciation of the complexities of dysphagia and investigations into underlying pathologies will advance clinical management of neurogenic dysphagia and inform investigations of dysphagia identification and treatment. Swallowing is a complex sensorimotor task with widespread control throughout the nervous system.

First, how does a person's higher sensorimotor function—attributes that affect onset, timing, strength and coordination of all movements—influence swallowing? Second, if this sensorimotor function is a critical variable, how does this inform dysphagia rehabilitation? And finally, how can relevant markers of swallowing sensorimotor function be assessed? In this review, we explore specific biomechanical signs of neurogenic dysphagia ( Table 2 Fig. 1 Table 1 Figure 1  Classical sensorimotor hierarchy. https://BioRender.com/mge3k79 Table 2 Descriptions and potential consequences of abnormal swallowing physiology and evidence in pure cases of dysphagia Dysphagia sign Description Potential consequence(s) Pure case dysphagia a Muscle NMJ LMN UMN BG− BG+ CBM Apraxia Sensory Reduced lip seal Reduced lip closure during the swallow Loss of bolus from anterior oral cavity x – – – x x – x – Reduced or uncoordinated tongue movement Reduced or uncoordinated movement of the tongue when preparing and transporting the bolus from the oral cavity to the pharynx Inefficient swallowing x x x x x x x x x Tongue pumping Anterior/posterior rocking motion of the tongue as part of oral transit phase Inefficient swallowing – – – – x – – x – Involuntary movements of tongue/jaw/larynx Tremor or dyskinesia of orofacial musculature Inefficient swallowing – – – – x x – – – Ineffective mastication Solid bolus not being chewed sufficiently before swallowing Large pieces of unchewed solids x x x – x x x x x Piecemeal deglutition Breaking up a bite/sip into multiple different swallows Inefficient swallowing – x x – – x – x x Difficulty initiating a swallow Reduced ability to propel bolus into the pharynx Inefficient swallowing – – – – x x – x – Premature spillage Bolus spilling into pharynx prior to onset of oral transit phase Risk for airway invasion b – x x – x – – – – Delayed or absent pharyngeal swallow trigger Bolus head in the pharynx before the onset of pharyngeal phase Risk for airway invasion – x x – x x x – x Reduced nasopharyngeal valving Reduced movement of the velum to close off nasal cavity Nasal redirection c x x – x – x – – – Reduced hyolaryngeal excursion Reduced anterior-superior movement of the hyoid and the larynx during the pharyngeal phase of swallowing Risk for airway invasion x x x – x x x – – Reduced epiglottic retroflexion Reduced inversion of the epiglottis over the larynx d Risk for airway invasion x x – – – – – – – Reduced laryngeal closure Incomplete closure of the larynx, at the true vocal folds, false vocal folds, and/or contact between the arytenoids and epiglottic petiole Risk for airway invasion – x – – x x – – – Reduced tongue base retraction and/or diminished pharyngeal stripping wave Reduced posterior movement of the tongue base at the tail of the bolus and/or decreased sequential contraction of the superior, middle, and inferior pharyngeal constrictors at the tail of the bolus Inefficient swallowing x x x – x x x – – Delayed/reduced UOS opening Reduced relaxation of the cricopharyngeus muscles and/or reduced traction on the UOS from hyolaryngeal excursion and/or reduced intrabolus pressure to distend UOS Inefficient swallowing x x x – x x – – x Oesophageal dysmotility Slow or abnormal bolus passage through the oesophagus Inefficient swallowing x x – x x x – – x BG− = basal ganglia condition with loss-of-function phenotype; BG+ = basal ganglia condition with gain-of-function phenotype; CBM = cerebellum; LMN = lower motor neuron; NMJ = neuromuscular junction; UOS = upper oesophageal sphincter; UMN = upper motor neuron.  a  b  c  d Muscle pathology Diseases affecting the most peripheral level of the motor system—the muscle—are known as myopathies. Myopathy is an umbrella term describing heterogeneous conditions that affect muscle structure, ion channel function or metabolism. 17 18 18 19 Pure myopathic dysphagia: inclusion body myositis Sporadic inclusion body myositis is a primary progressive muscle disorder that is the most common inflammatory myopathy in individuals over age 50. 20 21 22-24 25-27 Oropharyngeal and oesophageal dysphagia is reported in more than 50% of patients with inclusion body myositis 28 29 30 31 32 33 33 33 32-36 33 32-34 37-39 23 32-34 37-43 33 38 43 Descriptions and consequences of these dysphagia signs are outlined in Table 2 23 33 34 37-44 32-34 37-39 42 Neuromuscular junction pathology Dysfunction at the neuromuscular junction prevents adequate transmission of neural signals from the lower motor neuron to the muscle. Neuromuscular junction disorders arise from loss or malfunction of proteins or enzymes involved in neuromuscular transmission and result in pre- or postsynaptic deficits. 45 46 46 Pure neuromuscular junction dysphagia: myasthenia gravis Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease characterized by antibodies against acetylcholine receptors or similar molecules at the neuromuscular junction, which results in weakness and fatigue of skeletal muscles. 47 46 Upwards of 60% of patients with myasthenia gravis experience dysphagia, 48 49 50 49-51 48 50-55 50 49-51 53 54 56 57 50 51 53 56-59 49 53 54 58 60 61 49 50 50 52 54 62 63 51 59 62 49-54 57-59 63 49 52 57 52 62 64-67 Descriptions and consequences of these dysphagia signs are outlined in Table 2 49-54 56 57 59 63 68 69 49-54 56-58 62 63 70 51-53 55 57 63 Lower motor neuron pathology Lower motor neuron pathology can occur in isolation (e.g. nerve palsies) or in conditions that impact other motor systems (e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Classical signs of lower motor neuron dysfunction include denervation atrophy, flaccid weakness, fasciculations, hypotonia and hyporeflexia/areflexia ( Table 1 11 71 Pure lower motor neuron dysphagia: spinal muscular atrophy One disease that specifically impacts lower motor neurons is spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic condition associated with progressive degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord and brainstem nuclei with resulting muscle atrophy and weakness. Spinal muscular atrophy can emerge in infancy, childhood or adulthood, and its severity is associated with the number of survival motor neuron 2 (SMN2) gene copy number. 72 73 74 75 74-78 Dysphagia prevalence in spinal muscular atrophy depends on the type, with estimates ranging from 23% to 100%. 79 73 75 73 75-78 80 81 73 75 82 75 81 75 82 83 81 82 82 82 75 82 Descriptions and consequences of these dysphagia signs are outlined in Table 2 81-83 73 75 81-83 73-75 77 78 80 82 84 Upper motor neuron pathology Upper motor neuron pathology can occur anywhere along the pathway of the corticospinal or corticobulbar tracts and is common in many conditions, such as tumours, stroke, trauma/injuries, inflammatory or infectious diseases, neurodegenerative diseases or metabolic disorders. Upper motor neuron signs include positive and negative signs 85 Table 1 86 87 88 Pure upper motor neuron dysphagia: primary lateral sclerosis A disease purely affecting upper motor neurons is primary lateral sclerosis. Primary lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by slowly progressing upper motor neuron dysfunction without lower motor neuron involvement. 89 90-92 92-94 Although descriptions of dysphagia symptomatology in primary lateral sclerosis are extremely scarce, 95 96 97 98 99 Descriptions and consequences of these dysphagia signs are outlined in Table 2 96 Basal ganglia pathology Any disease, lesion, procedure or medication that impacts nodes in the basal ganglia circuitry can result in a movement disorder. 100 Table 1 11 Table 1 101-107 Pure basal ganglia dysphagia: drug-induced parkinsonism Pharmacologic blockade of central dopamine receptors or interference with dopamine synthesis can result in drug-induced parkinsonism. 108 109 108 110 111 Dysphagia in drug-induced parkinsonism typically co-occurs with hypokinetic dysarthria 111-113 111-115 116 111 116 117 111 114 117 114 116 111 117 118 112 111 114 113 114 118 117 118 119 118 119 116 119 111 116 Descriptions and consequences of these dysphagia signs are outlined in Table 2 111 114 116 112 113 115-117 119 120 112 113 115-117 119 Pure basal ganglia dysphagia: tardive dyskinesia Tardive dyskinesia is an iatrogenic movement disorder due to postsynaptic dopaminergic hypersensitivity, caused by prolonged use of antipsychotic medication. 108 109 109 121 Dysphagia frequently co-occurs with dysarthria 122-125 124-126 127 116 121 128 116 121 126 129 116 121-123 127-130 127 124 116 123 123 124 123 126 126 123 116 122 126 116 122 123 126 Descriptions and potential consequences of abnormal physiologic signs listed above are outlined in Table 2 123 127 116 123 126 127 123 126 Cerebellar pathology Ataxia is an archetypal sign of cerebellar dysfunction, 131 132 Table 1 133 134 135 Pure cerebellar dysphagia: ataxia No currently published studies define the phenomenon of ataxic dysphagia, but there are increasing studies that suggest relationships between cerebellar damage and impaired swallowing. Pure cerebellar conditions with documented cases of dysphagia are rare. The existing literature to the date of this publication reported prevalence of dysphagia from 0% 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146-152 153-155 Dysphagia in conditions that primarily impact the cerebellum (localized stroke, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6) has been characterized by: reduced tongue movement 156 156 156 141 141 Descriptions and potential consequences of abnormal physiologic signs listed above are outlined in Table 2 141 156 Apraxia Apraxia is defined by the inability to execute complex and previously-learned skilled movements that cannot be explained by weakness, extrapyramidal symptoms, ataxia, loss of sensation or cognitive dysfunction. 157 158 158 Table 1 Buccofacial or non-verbal oral apraxia impacts learned movements of the face, cheeks, lips, tongue, larynx and pharynx, particularly on command or imitation. 159 157 159-168 157 160 167 12 160 169 170 171 172 Apraxia of speech is characterized by an acquired impairment in speech planning or programming that cannot be explained by sensorimotor or cognitive disturbances. 173 12 174 175-178 174 175 177-180 165 169 181-186 Pure apraxic dysphagia There is no consensus on a definition of swallowing apraxia. A common theme seems to be disrupted coordination in lingual movements during the oral preparation and transition phases of swallowing, though there appears to be disagreement as to whether this occurs only with a bolus in the mouth or a cue to swallow. 187-194 Despite usage of the term swallowing apraxia, there is still debate on whether these observations relate to a true condition of apraxia. 187 195 196 197 197 Sensory pathology Adequate sensation is a critical component of motor control. The importance of sensory feedback for adequate motor output is illustrated in patients with deafferentation syndromes. Patients with such syndromes display reduced recruitment of motor units, hypotonia and ataxia of affected limbs. 198 199 Pure sensory dysphagia To the authors’ knowledge, there have only been two case series describing dysphagia as an outcome of purely sensory origin: Nilsson and colleagues 200 201 201 200 201 200 201 Descriptions and potential consequences of abnormal physiologic signs listed above are outlined in Table 2 200 201 200 The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve can be experimentally deafferented by anesthetic injected into the paraglottic compartment. 202 203 204 203 While the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is a crucial component in triggering the pharyngeal phase of the swallow and in deglutitive airway protection, there are many other avenues of sensory integration in swallowing function, which have been investigated by experimental localized blockade of sensation in a sample of healthy swallowers. The following biomechanical changes have been reported after topical oral cavity anaesthesia, periodontal anaesthesia, lingual nerve block and oropharynx (posterior tonsillar pillars, soft palate, posterior pharyngeal wall) anaesthesia: reduced, uncoordinated tongue movements 205 206 206-208 207-209 208 210 Evaluation of swallowing pathophysiology A detailed review of evaluation of swallowing biomechanics is beyond the scope of this review; see reviews by Matsuo and Palmer, 211 et al 212 et al 213 et al 214 Table 2 Weakness Neuromuscular weakness can occur due to pathology in the muscle, neuromuscular junction, lower motor neuron and/or upper motor neuron. Weakness is often blamed for many signs and symptoms of dysphagia, from reduced tongue movements to reduced hyolaryngeal excursion to post-swallow residue, e.g. van den Engel-Hoek et al 215 et al 216 217 218 Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction tests can be particularly helpful in identifying what part of the neuromuscular unit is affected (muscle, junction or axon) and are the gold standard for assessment of denervation. 219 220-224 225 226 53 59 62 227 Lip and tongue pressure can be measured using a variety of devices, 228-231 214 227 210 , 232 Promising new imaging techniques that are now under development and optimization, such as dynamic real-time MRI and simultaneous functional MRI and dynamic MRI of the head and neck (SimulScan), 233 234 et al 235 Disruptions in muscle tone: hypotonia, spasticity, rigidity Muscle tone is assessed by passively moving a joint and judging the resistance, which is regulated by local reflexes and reticulospinal fibres. 71 236-238 239-243 Dietsch and colleagues 244 244 245 Hypo- and hyperreflexia The relevance of hypo- and hyperreflexia to swallowing function is not abundantly clear. Weak or absent gag reflex has been reported in individuals with lower motor neuron symptomatology and dysphagia, 246-251 252 253 254 255 254 256 Intact reflex or motor response to stimulation requires intact sensory pathways to the brainstem or spinal cord, intact interneuronal circuits and intact motor pathways. A delayed, incomplete or absent reflex response is an indication of dysfunction in one or more limbs of the reflex arc, and careful consideration must be given to determine where in that arc the dysfunction lies. Atrophy Atrophy of orofacial musculature is relatively easy to visualize at bedside and is reported in cases of lower motor neuron dysfunction. 221 257-265 74 246 266-268 269 Fasciculations Fasciculations occur during the process of muscle denervation and are best assessed in muscles at rest. 71 260 270 271 222 272 222-224 Hypokinesia, akinesia and bradykinesia Hypokinesia/akinesia and bradykinesia may be measured by assessing movement amplitudes and timing of various orofacial, lingual, pharyngeal, and laryngeal structures during swallowing as measured on instrumented swallowing evaluations, such as videofluoroscopy or endoscopy. There are recent attempts to better quantify swallowing biomechanics, such as the pharyngeal constriction ratio, 273 274 275 Ataxia There are several ataxia rating scales, 276 277-279 Apraxia Apraxic deficits can be elicited through a verbal command from the examiner on imitation or by observing an individual perform activities of daily living. Errors can be made in some situations with function spared in others, and evaluating movement accuracy is specific to each movement. Several tests for buccofacial apraxia include a command to swallow, but we have only identified one case report of a person with buccofacial oral apraxia who was reportedly unable to swallow on command. 162 Sensation Sensation relevant to swallowing can be assessed in a variety of ways. When describing sensation, it is vital to consider afferent, efferent and cognitive requirements underlying the assessment. Self-report measures are common in the assessment of sensation. In a cranial nerve examination, sensation is assessed by having the patient identify if and where they feel a stimulus and to describe the nature of the stimulus (sharp versus blunt, taste discrimination, etc.). During an instrumented swallowing evaluation, we may also probe if a patient is aware of the presence and/or location of residue. Reliability for residue detection and localization is poor, however. 280 255 281 282 Sensation can also be assessed through neuroimaging. For example, Pitts and colleagues 283 Neurogenic dysphagia rehabilitation Most dysphagia rehabilitation approaches were developed on the basis of visualized biomechanical breakdown or presence of a symptom of that breakdown. Furthermore, the majority of our active rehabilitation approaches have focused on increasing force generation of the muscles involved in swallowing, with an aim to consequently decrease anatomical obstruction to the bolus and/or increase pharyngeal pressure, resulting in improved bolus flow and airway closure. For example, the rationale for use of swallowing strengthening exercises might be something like: (i) during swallowing, floor of mouth muscles activate to lift the hyoid anteriorly and superiorly; (ii) anterosuperior movement of the hyoid is associated with airway protection; (iii) during the act of swallowing with increased voluntary effort, floor of mouth muscles are more active; and thus, (iv) an exercise programme activating the floor of mouth muscles will increase anterosuperior hyoid movement and thus improve airway protection. Unfortunately, the literature on these approaches is not compelling. 16 284-286 This biomechanical approach to intervention has a limited conceptual foundation for how we view oropharyngeal dysphagia. This limitation, in our view, is a fundamental shortcoming in that biomechanical assessment of visualized movement cannot define the underlying neurological nature of the problem. As we expand our understanding of sensorimotor control of swallowing and neuromechanical pathologies underlying deficits associated with neurogenic dysphagia, opportunities for more specific, efficient and efficacious management and rehabilitation approaches will follow. The approach of addressing the deficit is not at issue, but we need to address the neuromechanical deficit instead of the biomechanical deficit. Discussion In this review, we have shown that intact functioning of the muscle, neuromuscular junction, lower motor neurons, upper motor neurons, basal ganglia, cerebellum and sensory systems is necessary for functional oropharyngeal swallowing. That is, a condition that only impacts one of these systems is sufficient to cause dysphagia. We do not currently have a good understanding of the causal relationship between deficits in these sensorimotor systems and resulting changes to swallowing biomechanics, bolus flow and dysphagia sequelae. Without such understanding, the potential for phenotyping and application of well-rationalized treatments for neurogenic dysphagia is limited. Difficulty in developing a phenotypic categorization of dysphagia may stem from inherent limitations in swallowing assessments and evaluation protocols. With the exception of 3D computed tomography, 287 Dysphagia rehabilitation is consequently unspecific due to shortcomings in dysphagia assessment. Current rehabilitation paradigms work on addressing perceived failures in swallowing biomechanics. However, a large proportion of rehabilitations were built on the rationale that reduced oropharyngeal movements are a consequence of weakness and thus focus on strengthening underlying muscle groups. 288 289 15 It is important to acknowledge limitations inherent to a narrative review such as this. While this review aimed to synthesize and interpret a wide range of evidence, the lack of a standardized approach may have resulted in an incomplete representation of the literature base. Nevertheless, we identified a large gap in understanding and present a framework that can be used to drive future hypotheses-driven work. These assessment challenges and lack of strong rehabilitation efficacy data reviewed here allow for exploration of several clinical questions. Tools to quantify oral, laryngeal and pharyngeal sensorimotor functioning such as disruptions in muscle tone can help to gain more specificity in swallowing assessments. Work is needed not only to describe signs and symptoms that are common to a particular dysphagia aetiology but also to investigate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and whether they respond to therapies targeted to address physiology (e.g. neural signalling), biomechanics (e.g. oral and pharyngeal movements and pressure gradients), bolus flow (e.g. airway invasion, residue) and outcomes (e.g. malnutrition, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, quality of life). While unanswered questions may be frustrating to clinicians, patients and care partners, the potential for improvements to health and quality of life outcomes remain a strong driver in pursuing this difficult work.
