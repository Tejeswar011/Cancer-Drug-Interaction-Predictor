In tumors, extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) is an important driver of oncogene expression, genomic instability, the evolution of drug resistance, and poor patient prognosis. ecDNA is present in various tumors but is rarely found in normal cells. Here, we provide a detailed review of the structure, genetics, occurrence, outcomes, and functions of ecDNA, offering further reference for research on ecDNA. ecDNA tumorigenesis oncogene heterogeneity cancer progression The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

( 1 2 1 2 3 2 Structural and inheritance dynamics of ecDNA 2.1 Physical and functional architecture Approximately 30% of ecDNA exist in pairs within the nucleus, and thus, for a long time, they were referred to as double minutes ( 4 5 3  Figure 1 4 5 11 5 6 9 12 Figure 1 A body map of the prevalence of ecDNA in various cancers.

The data were extracted using Getdata Graph Digitizer (  https://getdata-graph-digitizer.com/ 3 A body map of the prevalence of ecDNA in various cancers. Categories include oropharyngeal, bone and soft tissue, breast, hepatobiliary, skin, ovary, bladder, CNS, lung, upper GI, renal, colorectal, uterus, prostate, and others. Each category lists specific cancer types with respective ecDNA percentages. ecDNA can carry a variety of common oncogenes, such as MYC MYCN Jun KRAS MYCL MDM2 EGFR FGFR2 PDGFRA ERBB2 CDK4 13 14 15 13 16 3 3 17 3 13 18 2.2 Non-Mendelian segregation mechanisms During mitosis, the spindle apparatus pulls the centromeres of chromosomes, guiding their alignment and equal segregation to ensure that daughter cells have identical chromosomal DNA. Multiple studies have shown that the copy number of ecDNA among tumor cells exhibits significant heterogeneity ( 19 20 21 22 22 23 14 14  Figure 2 Figure 2 Random segregation of ecDNA promotes intratumoral heterogeneity of cancer. ecDNA does not follow Mendelian inheritance and undergoes random segregation during cell division. After multiple rounds of cell division, the copy number of ecDNA in cells will exhibit significant heterogeneity. Diagram illustrating the uneven segregation of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) in cells, leading to intratumoral heterogeneity. Cells are shown with blue chromosomal DNA and red ecDNA. Arrows depict the segregation process, resulting in a cluster of cells with varying ecDNA counts. 3 Formation of ecDNA Since the discovery of ecDNA, researchers have been committed to exploring its origin and formation mechanisms. Analysis of single nucleotide variant (SNV) frequency has shown that ecDNA and chromosomal DNA are haplotypically distinct, providing evidence for the hypothesis that ecDNA originates from chromosomes ( 24  Figure 3 Figure 3 Biogenesis of ecDNA. (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) Diagram showing five mechanisms leading to ecDNA formation: A) Breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle depicting chromosomal breakage, replication, fusion, and bridge formation. B) Episome model illustrating excision and end-to-end ligation resulting in ecDNA. C) Chromothripsis process showing chromosomal breakage, fragment formation, and repair producing ecDNA. D) Translocation-bridge (TB) amplification model illustrating chromosomal breakage, translocation, and bridge formation leading to ecDNA. E) HPV model detailing HPV replication, virus genome concatemers formation, breakage, integration, excision, and recombination leading to ecDNA. 3.1 Excisional model The excisional model, also known as the episome model, is a simple hypothesis regarding the origin of ecDNA. The excisional model posits that ecDNA originates from double-stranded DNA breaks on chromosomes, so the resulting ecDNA usually have simple structures and low diversity ( 25 26 MYC MYC MYC 27 in situ MYC 28 29 12 22 According to whether the chromosome can be accurately repaired after DNA fragment excision, the excisional model is divided into the scarring excisional model and the scarless excisional model. In the scarring excisional model, DNA fragment excision occurs before DNA replication, and the organism connects the chromosomal break ends through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) ( 25 25 29 30 3.2 Breakage-fusion-bridge cycle BFB cycles were originally described by Barbara McClintock in 1939 for the fate of a dicentric chromosome during meiotic mitosis and endosperm development in maize ( 31 32 33 34 35 34 32 32 3.3 Translocation-bridge amplification Chromosomal translocations can also form dicentric chromosomes. During cell division, dicentric chromosomes separate to form chromosomal bridges, which break and circularize to form ecDNA ( 36 CCND1 36 36 36 3.4 Chromothripsis Chromothripsis refers to the occurrence of a large number of random breaks in one or several chromosomes within a short period ( 37 38 39 40 41 42 30 43 44 45 30 43 4 Viral integration and ecDNA biogenesis HPV is a small, non-enveloped virus with a circular double-stranded DNA genome, and more than 200 genotypes have been identified to date ( 46 47 48 49 50 51 17 52 53 55 56 1 2 3 4 5 56 57 5 ecDNA promotes oncogene expression Pan-cancer analysis shows that oncogenes encoded by ecDNA have the highest expression levels in tumor transcriptomes ( 15 EGFR MYC CDK4 MDM2 15  Figure 4 Figure 4 Examples of how ecDNA can promote oncogene expression.

Panel B shows trans-acting mechanisms with oncogenes and enhancers interacting. Panel C illustrates enhancer hijacking with oncogenes, enhancers, distal enhancers, and insulators. Panel D displays an ecDNA hub linking enhancers, oncogenes, and BRD4. 5.1 Amplification of ecDNA copy number In tumors, gene amplification is a measure to antagonize anti-cancer treatments by directly increasing the dosage of target proteins ( 58 59 60 61 15 62 5.2 ecDNA exhibits high transcriptional activity ecDNA can carry multiple regulatory regions, resulting in a non-linear relationship between transcriptional output and gene copy number. Transcription of ecDNA is very common ( 63 15 30 64 20 5.2.1 High chromatin accessibility of ecDNA Chromatin accessibility refers to the physical contact permissibility of nuclear macromolecules with chromatinized DNA, which is mainly determined by the distribution and occupancy of nucleosomes, as well as other DNA-binding factors ( 65 66 67 68 15 15 64 5.2.2 ecDNA as mobile enhancers Gene expression is regulated by genomic enhancers that recruit transcription factors and cofactors to activate transcription from target core-promoters ( 69 52 70 71 15 70 5.2.3 Enhancer hijacking Genes can hijack distal enhancers to compensate for the loss of local gene regulatory elements, thereby enhancing gene expression, a phenomenon known as enhancer hijacking ( 16 72 73 MYCN TRIB2 16 CDX2 MYC 74 MYC FGFR2 CD44 PDHX 74 64 5.2.4 Promoter hijacking ecDNA in COLO320-DM cells contains multiple copies of the long noncoding RNA gene PVT1 PVT1 MYC MYC 75 PVT1-MYC PVT1 MYC PVT1 MYC 75 PVT1 MYC 75 PVT1-MYC MYC 75 MYCL RLF 76 5.2.5 ecDNA hub FISH technology has confirmed that ecDNA in PC3 cells, COLO320-DM cells, SNU16 cells, and HK359 glioma cell lines all exhibit a significant tendency to aggregate in the nucleus ( 75 75 FGFR2 MYC 75 77 75 77 75 78 Immunofluorescence staining has confirmed that the ecDNA hub in glioblastoma-derived neurosphere cell lines is co-localized with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), suggesting that the ecDNA hub can promote the aggregation and recruitment of functional transcriptional machinery ( 23 PVT1 75 FGFR2 MYC 75 FGFR2 MYC MYC MYC MYC 78 MYC 75 It is worth noting that not all ecDNA in all cells can form ecDNA hubs or exhibit high transcriptional activity. Studies have shown that in glioblastoma stem cells, there is no aggregation or close interaction between ecDNA carrying EGFR MYC PDGFR 79 6 ecDNA promotes tumor heterogeneity, evolution, drug resistance, and poor prognosis Tumor cells continuously evolve into populations with intratumoral heterogeneity ( 80 80 81 82 83 84 6.1 ecDNA copy number, epigenetic, and genetic heterogeneity As mentioned above, ecDNA does not follow Mendelian inheritance and undergoes random segregation during cell division. Therefore, after multiple rounds of cell division, the copy number of ecDNA in cells will exhibit significant heterogeneity (  Figure 2 21 22 22 32 85 76 24 In glioblastoma, exons 2–7 of EGFR EGFRvIII 86 EGFRvIII EGFR 24 EGFRvIII 14 87 87 56 6.2 ecDNA promotes selection and drug resistance Studies have shown that the detection rate of ecDNA is significantly increased in tumor patients receiving chemotherapy and targeted therapy, suggesting that ecDNA may be an adaptive mechanism for tumor cells to cope with treatment pressure ( 3 DHFR 88 88 DHFR 22 CCND1 89 EGFRvIII EGFRvIII EGFRvIII EGFRvIII 22 EGFRvIII EGFRvIII 90 19 MYC 19 22 6.3 ecDNA leads to poor prognosis Studies have shown that patients with ecDNA+ medulloblastoma were more than twice as likely to relapse and three times as likely to die within 5 years of diagnosis ( 20 3 91 3 3 92 93 TP53 94 95 TP53 13 TP53 3 12 20 TP53 20 MYCN MYCN 96 97 RLF-MYCL 76 RLF-MYCL 98 7 Fate of ecDNA ecDNA plays an important role in tumorigenesis and progression. Can ecDNA persist long-term after abnormal formation in cells? Next, we discuss the fate of ecDNA in cells (  Figure 5 Figure 5 Fate of ecDNA. (A) (B) (C) Diagram illustrating three models of ecDNA behavior: A) Maintenance shows ecDNA replication and tethering to chromosomes during mitosis, resulting in daughter cells with ecDNA. B) Integration depicts ecDNA incorporation into chromosomes forming HSR, influenced by selective pressure. C) Elimination demonstrates the formation of micronuclei during mitosis, leading to ecDNA degradation or extrusion. 7.1 Maintenance ecDNA exhibits autonomous replication and undergoes replication only once during the S phase of the cell cycle ( 99 12 12 100 101 41 102 7.2 Integration As early as 1985, research revealed that MYC 103 BRAF 104 96 MYCN NBAS rs13028343 NBAS rs13028343 DCLK1 96 102 7.3 Elimination ecDNA usually carries oncogenes, so eliminating ecDNA can induce cell differentiation and reverse the tumor phenotype. Studies have shown that COLO320-DM cells contain ecDNA micronuclei, and low concentrations of hydroxyurea can further induce their formation ( 105 106 107 108 109 101 105 8 ecDNA as a potential therapeutic target ecDNA promotes massive transcription of oncogenes and rapid genomic evolution in tumor patients, leading to drug resistance and reduced survival rates. Therefore, ecDNA is an important potential therapeutic target in tumors. Under normal conditions, replication forks on ecDNA exhibit slightly reduced speed and an elevated stalling rate, indicating that they persistently operate under a certain degree of replication stress ( 110 111 110 63 112 63 113 114 63 CHK1 63 NCT05827614  Table 1 Table 1 Potential targeted therapeutic strategies for ecDNA. Intervention nodes Drugs Description Refs. ecDNA biogenesis PARP inhibitors DNA ligase 3 PARylation facilitates ecDNA biogenesis. PARP inhibitors block PARylation, and counteract ecDNA-driven drug resistance. ( 115 116 ecDNA replication Hydroxyurea Under replication stress induced by hydroxyurea treatment, ecDNA replication is compromised, leading to altered origin activation, reduced fork velocity and eventual ecDNA depletion from cells. ( 110 CHK1/CHK2 inhibitors The CHK protein kinase is essential to ensure ecDNA genome integrity, and CHK inhibitions could trigger preferential cell death in ecDNA+ tumour cells. BBI-355 is currently in clinical trials as a CHK1 inhibitor. ( 12 63 ATM/TOP1 inhibitor ecDNA replication-dependent activation of ATM-mediated DDR and DDR ensures ecDNA maintenance; TOP1 are critical regulators of ecDNA-induced DDR. ( 12 ecDNA clustering BET inhibitors BET inhibitors target BRD4 within ecDNA hubs, disrupting hub integrity and thereby reducing intermolecular interactions among ecDNA molecules, ultimately suppressing ecDNA-driven gene expression. ( 75 ecDNA micronucleation Hydroxyurea Low-dose hydroxyurea induces ecDNA clustering by promoting DDR. These clustered ecDNAs subsequently detach from anaphase chromosomes, ultimately promoting chromosomal micronucleation. ( 106 Gemcitabine Gemcitabine is able to decrease the number of ecDNA in cells at a 7500X lower concentration than the commonly used cancer drug hydroxyurea.

High-throughput sequencing enables comprehensive characterization of ecDNA sequence composition and dynamic alterations, yet it remains limited in resolving spatial organization and intercellular variability. In contrast, advanced imaging techniques allow direct visualization and real-time tracking of ecDNA dynamics but lack the capacity to provide precise sequence-level information. Furthermore, ecDNA detection rates vary substantially across cancer types, and the vast diversity of ecDNA-associated oncogenes introduces significant complexity for the development of ecDNA-targeted therapeutics. Adding to these challenges, the profound intratumoral heterogeneity driven by ecDNA through non-Mendelian inheritance mechanisms substantially reduces the diagnostic reliability of single-time tissue biopsies or liquid biopsies. Future advances are likely to emerge from integrative strategies that combine high-resolution imaging modalities—such as three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and live-cell imaging—with next-generation and single-molecule sequencing platforms. Such multimodal approaches are expected to provide a systematic understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of ecDNA and its influence on tumor evolution, clonal selection, and treatment response. In parallel, therapeutic strategies may increasingly focus on key regulatory nodes that govern ecDNA biogenesis and maintenance, offering potential broad-spectrum targets across multiple tumor types. Additionally, multi-region sampling and single-cell sequencing are anticipated to mitigate false-negative results associated with intratumoral heterogeneity, thereby improving the sensitivity and reliability of ecDNA detection. In summary, although ecDNA was first described over six decades ago, its critical roles in oncogenesis and cancer progression have only recently gained widespread recognition. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that ecDNA serves as a major driver of oncogene amplification, genomic instability, intratumoral heterogeneity, and therapeutic resistance. Ongoing studies are progressively elucidating the biological processes underlying ecDNA formation, maintenance, clustering, and clearance, laying a theoretical foundation for the development of ecDNA-targeted interventions, with several candidate compounds currently advancing into clinical trials. Nonetheless, key questions remain unresolved regarding the cellular origins, transcriptional regulation, and three-dimensional spatial architecture of ecDNA, highlighting the urgent need for further mechanistic investigations and technological innovations.
