However, its prevalence among the general population in Nigeria remains unknown. This study investigates the prevalence of self- and mutual masturbation and their associated factors among sexually active Nigerians. Methods Data were obtained from the Sexual Behaviour and HPV Infection in Nigerians in Ibadan cross-sectional study, including males and females aged 18–45 years. After obtaining consent, participants were asked during face-to-face interviews whether they had ever touched their genitals or inserted fingers into the vagina or anus for sexual pleasure (self-masturbation) or whether they and their sexual partners had ever touched each other’s genitals by hand for sexual pleasure (mutual masturbation). The prevalence of self- and mutual masturbation was reported using percentages, while their associations with participants’ demographic, lifestyle, and biological characteristics were examined using chi-square tests. Poisson regression with robust variance was performed to identify associated factors. Statistical significance was set at p Results Mutual masturbation (83.7%) was more common than self-masturbation (64.9%) among participants. The prevalence of self-masturbation was significantly higher among males than females (69.9% vs. 62.4%, p p Conclusion Self- and mutual masturbation are highly prevalent among sexually active Nigerians, with distinct factors influencing each behaviour.

In Nigeria, as in many parts of Africa, masturbation is similarly viewed negatively, primarily because of cultural and religious beliefs that classify it as immoral or harmful [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Existing studies have also identified the reasons for engaging in masturbation, with the most common motivation for both sexes being its role as a simple and safe way to explore one’s body and understand personal preferences for stimulation and arousal [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Given that masturbation is a typical sexual behaviour across different age groups and is essential to sexual functioning, it is surprising that there is little to no knowledge of its prevalence in Nigeria. In a scoping review that examined masturbation in Africa, only five studies were found to have focused solely on masturbatory practices, and none was from Nigeria [ 19 20 Against this backdrop, it is evident that there exist significant gaps in understanding the prevalence and factors associated with masturbatory behaviours in Nigeria. Therefore, this study sought to investigate the prevalence of self- and mutual masturbation, their associated factors, and potential associations with STIs, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Human Papillomavirus (HPV), among the general population in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Methods Study design, population, and study sites This study adopted a quantitative, cross-sectional design to examine the prevalence of self- and mutual masturbation, their associated factors, and potential links with STIs. Data were collected between 2016 and 2018 through a study on Sexual Behaviour and HPV Infection in Nigerians in Ibadan (SHINI). Details of the SHINI study have been published in previous studies [ 21 23 22 23 Sampling and enrolment of study participants The participants were recruited using a two-stage sampling technique. Four enumeration areas (EAs) were randomly selected from the Moniya and Mokola residential communities and one EA from Sasa using the 2006 National Population Commission Census EAs [ 24 The selected participants in each household were visited at home by the research assistants, who fully explained the study objectives and an information leaflet in English or a local language. Consenting male and female residents were invited to the clinic individually to participate in the study. Potential participants were contacted 72 h and 24 h before the clinic date, and a short message service (SMS) reminder was sent on the morning of the clinic appointment. At the clinic, a gender-matched research assistant discussed the study’s objectives again and provided a copy of the information leaflet to complement the discussion. Participants then signed a written or witnessed informed consent form, which included consent for the collection of biological samples for HPV and HIV testing. Afterward, a face-to-face interview was conducted in the participant’s preferred language (either English or a local language) using a structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was pilot-tested to identify questions that required refinement for clarity and conciseness. Feedback from the pilot test was used to enhance the reliability of the main study and to ensure that participants clearly understood the questions. The information collected included participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking, and sexual behaviours, including non-penetrative sexual activities. Specifically, participants were asked if they had ever touched their genitals or inserted fingers into the vagina or anus for sexual pleasure, as well as whether they and their sexual partners had ever touched each other’s genitals by hand for sexual pleasure since their sexual debut. Participants’ awareness and knowledge of HPV and its vaccination were also recorded. A gender-matched nurse then collected a blood sample for HIV testing and other biological samples for HPV testing. A detailed description of the sample collection procedure for both males and females at each anatomical site (oral, cervix, anal, vulva, and penis), along with information on storage and transportation, has been previously published [ 21 23 The rapid diagnostic test (RDT) HIV kit was used for HIV testing. The HIV testing was performed according to the National Guidelines for HIV Prevention, Treatment, and Care, Federal Ministry of Health, Nigeria [ 25 ® ® 21 22 Data entry and analysis The data analysis was performed using STATA 15.0 (Stata 2019. Statistical Software: Release 15. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC). The prevalence of self- and mutual masturbation was reported using frequency and percentage. A bar plot was used for the graphical representation of these behaviours. The distribution of self- and mutual masturbation across participants’ socio-demographic, sexual behaviours, and biological characteristics was presented using frequency and percentage for categorical variables and mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range for continuous variables, depending on the nature of the variables. The association between self- and mutual masturbation with participants’ characteristics was examined using the chi-square test of association. Risk factors associated with self- and mutual masturbation were assessed using Poisson regression with robust variance to ensure accurate and reliable estimates. Poisson regression with robust variance was chosen due to the high prevalence of self- and mutual masturbation; logistic regression odds ratios have been found to overestimate the prevalence ratio when prevalence is high [ 26 27 p p Results A total of 941 participants were recruited for the SHINI study, of which 625 are females (including 315 female sex workers) and 316 are males. Of the total participants, 611 (64.9%) had self-masturbated at some point since their sexual debut, while 787 (83.7%) reported having engaged in mutual masturbation (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Prevalence of self-

The result also showed that participants who owned a smart phone had a 45% higher relative risk of self-masturbation compared to those without a smart phone [Adjusted Relative Risk (ARR) = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.14–1.85]. Participants who had consumed alcohol significantly had 1.49 (95% CI: 1.02–1.23) times higher relative risk of self-masturbation compared to those who had never consumed alcohol. In addition, participants’ occupation was significantly associated with self-masturbation ( p In the crude model for mutual masturbation, males had a significantly lower relative risk of mutual masturbation compared to females [CRR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.85–0.97, p p p p After adjusting for other variables in the model, participants with multiple penile-vaginal sex partners had a higher relative risk of mutual masturbation compared to those with a single partner ( p p p Discussion In this study, mutual masturbation was more common than self-masturbation among the participants. The results of the study revealed gender differences in the prevalence of self-masturbation and mutual masturbation. Self-masturbation was significantly more prevalent among males than females, while mutual masturbation was significantly more prevalent among females than males. The gender differences in the reported prevalence of self- and mutual masturbation in our study were consistent with previous research, which reported a higher prevalence of self-masturbation among males than females and a higher prevalence of mutual masturbation among females than males [ 7 28 29 The analysis of the study results indicates a higher prevalence of mutual masturbation (83.7%) than self-masturbation (64.9%). This result contrasts with the findings of the U.S. National Survey of Sexual Health and Behaviour (NSSHB) conducted among participants aged 18–49 years between 2009 and 2018. The NSSHB reported a higher prevalence of self-masturbation (74.4%) compared to mutual masturbation (37.8%) [ 30 Furthermore, the results showed that participants’ occupation was significantly associated with the risk of self-masturbation, with a higher risk among skilled and semi-skilled workers compared to unskilled workers and those without paid jobs. This indicates an established relationship between education and occupational status, with individuals with higher education levels more likely to engage in skilled labour than those with little or no education [ 31 32 33 7 Another key finding of this study is that smartphone ownership was associated with a higher risk of self-masturbation compared to those without a smartphone. This reiterates findings in existing studies that have explored the relationship between smartphone use, pornography consumption, and self-masturbation [ 34 36 The study found alcohol consumption to be associated with the risk of self-masturbation, with participants who reported ever consuming alcohol having a higher risk of engaging in self-masturbation. While there has not been formal research specifically investigating the relationship between alcohol consumption and self-masturbation, there is evidence of alcohol consumption influencing sexual behaviours [ 37 39 40 41 An important finding of this study is that the prevalence of self-masturbation was highest among divorced, widowed, or separated participants, followed by single participants, and lowest among married participants. However, while the majority of studies conclude that self-masturbation is a substitute for partnered sexual activity, our data do not provide sufficient evidence to support this claim, as marital status was not significantly associated with the risk of self-masturbation after adjusting for other participant characteristics in our study. Therefore, it is essential to consider self-masturbation not solely as a substitute for partnered sex but also as an expression of sexual autonomy, stress relief, or personal preference among our study population. The findings indicate that divorced, widowed, or separated participants had a higher risk of self-masturbation compared to single and married participants, which may be attributed to reduced or no access to a regular sexual partner or changes in sexual habits following significant life events. The study found a significant difference in the prevalence of mutual masturbation among the major ethnic groups in Nigeria, with almost all Igbo participants (96.8%) reporting ever engaging in mutual masturbation, followed by Hausa/Fulani participants (89.2%). However, Hausa/Fulani participants had a higher risk of engaging in mutual masturbation compared to Igbo participants, and both Hausa/Fulani and Igbo ethnic groups had a higher risk of engaging in mutual masturbation than the Yoruba ethnic group. These findings signify the different socialization patterns that characterize the various ethnic groups in Nigeria. Similar trends have been documented in existing studies, which report a high prevalence of self- and mutual masturbation among Igbo participants as trends in various sexual behavioural studies have shown that Igbo people are more liberal and expressive about their sexual activities and behaviours compared to other ethnic groups in Nigeria [ 42 44 Additionally, the study findings revealed that participants who reside in rural areas were less likely to engage in mutual masturbation compared to participants who reside in urban areas. This is because rural areas tend to have stronger religious and traditional beliefs that discourage or condemn behaviours perceived as non-normative or outside the scope of procreative sex. In contrast, participants who reside in urban areas were generally more exposed to diverse perspectives on sexual behaviours due to greater access to information through media, education, and social networks. These factors may contribute to the lower engagement in mutual masturbation observed among rural participants. The analysis of the study found that sexual behavioural characteristics are significantly associated with the risk of mutual masturbation. Participants with multiple sexual partners had a higher risk of engaging in mutual masturbation compared to participants with a single sexual partner. This finding is consistent with earlier studies that reported individuals who frequently masturbate with their partners to also engage in intercourse more frequently as well as have more sexual partners [ 45 46 Another evident key finding in this study is the existence of a higher risk of engaging in mutual masturbation among participants who engage in other non-penile-vaginal sexual activities, such as receiving oral sex from their partner. These findings align with previous studies that reported an association between mutual masturbation and oral sex among both males and females [ 47 48 Strengths and limitations One strength of this study includes the inclusion of both adolescents and adults age groups, as well as the explicit and separate definitions of self- and mutual masturbation, allowing for a more complete and nuanced view of these behaviours compared to other sexual behavioural studies that do not distinguish between self- and mutual masturbation. Another key strength is the use of gender-matched research assistants to conduct live, in-person interviews to collect the data to reduce the bias often associated with reporting delicate subjects such as self- and mutual masturbation behaviours. Some of the potential limitations of the study include non-documentation of the reasons for engaging in self- and mutual masturbation, making it difficult to understand why there is a very high prevalence of these behaviours despite the religious and cultural beliefs against them, particularly self-masturbation. Therefore, future research studies could address this gap by employing validated scales to assess factors such as sexual autonomy, guilt, and social norms, which may provide more insight into why participants engage in these behaviours. Another limitation is the lack of data on the frequency of self- and mutual masturbation. Thus, there is a need to develop a more detailed questionnaire that captures the frequency, context, and variation across gender and age groups. This would help clarify the role of these behaviours in people’s sexual lives. Another limitation is because the cross-sectional design of the study limits our ability to infer causal relationships between the identified associated factors and engagement in self- and mutual masturbation. Conclusion In conclusion, this study revealed that mutual masturbation is more prevalent than self-masturbation generally, and it is associated with significant sex differences that are influenced by cultural, social, and behavioural factors. To address this, future studies could adopt a longitudinal or experimental design to understand the directionality of these relationships better and examine how the frequency of these behaviours changes over different seasons of the year. It is therefore recommended that further research should explore the frequency and reasons for engaging in self- and mutual masturbation, as well as the role of certain personality traits, to assess the impact of these behaviours on people’s sexual lives, particularly among those at high risk for STIs. The misconceptions surrounding masturbation should be addressed within sexual health education to improve public sexual health outcomes.
