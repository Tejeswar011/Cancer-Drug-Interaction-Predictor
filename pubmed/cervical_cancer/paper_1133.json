See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ Over the past century, dietary intake of linoleic acid (LA), an essential omega-6 fatty acid, has risen markedly in industrialized regions, largely due to industrial seed oils ( e.g. e.g. Linoleic acid Cancer mechanisms Oxidative stress Mitochondrial dysfunction Chronic inflammation Gut microbiota dysbiosis Dietary seed oils Short-chain fatty acids Terrain restoration pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes  Core Tip: INTRODUCTION The 20 th et al th 1 2 3 , 4 5 6 7 Before the industrial era, LA accounted for approximately 1%-2% of human caloric intake[ 8 8 9 8 9 2 10 2 4 6 This shift in dietary patterns has significantly altered human biochemistry, with LA now constituting a larger proportion of fatty acids in cell membranes and adipose tissue compared to previous generations[ 4 1 6 th 4 Figure 1  Dramatic four-decade rise in linoleic acid content of United States subcutaneous adipose tissue (1960-2008). 257 258 259 260 261 262 It is crucial to acknowledge that correlation does not imply causation; however, these parallel trends indicate that high dietary LA levels may contribute to creating an environment conducive to cancer development[ 11 12 Excessive dietary LA can stimulate the production of potent inflammatory mediators that are implicated in tumorigenesis[ 13 14 th 15 16 The subsequent sections of this paper will examine the primary mechanisms through which excessive LA exposure may contribute to carcinogenesis. These mechanisms encompass alterations in the gut microbiota[ 17 18 19 20 11 4 21 21 RISING LA INTAKE AND CANCER INCIDENCE TRENDS At a mechanistic level, high levels of LA have been shown in preclinical studies to promote oxidative stress by increasing the production of lipid peroxides, such as 4-HNE, which can damage cellular components including DNA and membrane proteins[ 22 23 24 25 26 Isolating the impact of LA on cancer risk from historical data is challenging due to multiple confounding variables, such as shifts in smoking prevalence, exposure to environmental toxins, and advancements in diagnostic capabilities over the 20 th 4 4 1 27 28 29 30 31 Table 1 Twentieth-century surge in dietary and adipose linoleic acid with parallel rise in United States cancer incidence  Decade  Per-capita linoleic acid intake (% kcal)  Adipose-tissue linoleic acid (% fatty acid)  Age-adjusted total cancer incidence (per 100000)  Key dietary milestone 1900s 1-2 N/A Approximately 90 Minimal seed-oil use 1950s 3-4 Approximately 8% Approximately 180 Margarine adoption 1980s 6-7 Approximately 14% Approximately 310 Widespread soybean oil 2000s 7-8 Approximately 18% Approximately 460 Ultra-processed foods N/A: Not applicable. This ecological evidence provides a foundation for hypothesis generation regarding how LA might influence cancer-related pathways, such as oxidative DNA damage or altered immune surveillance[ 32 33 34 Moreover, historical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) provide compelling evidence of LA’s potential toxicity. In a seminal 1965 RCT, Rose et al 34 P 35 th P 36 Similarly, re-analysis of the Sydney Diet Heart Study revealed that substitution of dietary saturated fats with safflower oil, a concentrated source of LA providing approximately 13% of energy, resulted in increased all-cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-2.43], CVD mortality (HR = 1.70), and coronary heart disease mortality (HR = 1.74), despite a reduction in serum cholesterol levels[ 37 P 38 37 OPPOSING EPIDEMIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FROM HUMAN COHORTS AND COUNTERANALYSIS Several large prospective cohorts and pooled analyses report either neutral or modestly inverse relations between dietary or biomarker LA and common cancers. A 2020 review of 38 prospective studies found no significant association between total omega6 PUFA intake and overall cancer incidence[ 27 vs 32 39 31 Limits of the “nullrisk” inference Closer inspection reveals that most human cohorts sample from a uniformly highLA world: Median exposures cluster between 5%-8% of total energy, far above the approximately 2% ancestral baseline[ 2 8 NATURAL LOWLA COMPARATORS ARE VANISHINGLY RARE Traditional groups with very low LA exposure (approximately 1%-3% of total energy), for example the Maasai of Kenya, atoll populations such as Tokelau and Pukapuka with coconut-based diets, and the Kitavans of Papua New Guinea, have historically reported low rates of cardiometabolic disease; systematic, site-specific cancer data are sparse. These populations illustrate that the “low-LA” quintile in Western cohorts may still lie well above truly low-exposure levels[ 40 41 Intervention trials favor reduction Randomized dietary-exchange studies that actively lower LA from approximately 7% to 2%-3% of total energy cut plasma 9- and 13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (HODE), 4HNE adducts and oxidized LDL within weeks[ 42 43 2 Table 2 Associations between linoleic acid and cancer risk or progression  Cancer type  Study design  Key findings/interpretation  Ref. Breast (ER+/ER-) Mendelian randomization (United Kingdom Biobank) Genetically elevated plasma LA was associated with increased risk of ER+ breast cancer. This suggests a potential causal relationship, though dietary intake thresholds were not assessed. No control population consuming < 5% LA of total daily energy [ 263 Triple-negative breast cancer Tumor metabolomics + xenograft LA served as a key metabolic substrate driving tumor progression via In vivo [ 13 Prostate Dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohorts No consistent association between dietary or biomarker LA and prostate cancer risk. Studies lacked low-LA intake arms (< 5% of daily calories), limiting ability to detect nonlinear effects [ 31 Non-small-cell lung United Kingdom Biobank (plasma LA) Higher circulating LA associated with significantly reduced incidence of non-small-cell lung. LA was inversely associated with time to diagnosis and overall risk. Relationship limited to biomarker data; dietary LA thresholds not stratified [ 264 Lung (all histologies) Prospective cohort (plasma fatty acids) Circulating LA inversely associated with lung cancer risk across histologic subtypes. No evidence of U-shaped risk or high-LA threshold effects. No low-intake (< 5% energy) group included [ 265 Pancreatic Case-control (PanC Consortium) Slight inverse association between LA intake and pancreatic cancer risk. Association was non-linear, with attenuation at higher intakes. No stratification by low-LA consumption [ 266 Colorectal Meta-analysis of dietary + biomarker studies Pooled analysis found modestly increased colorectal cancer risk with higher LA intake. Effect stronger for dietary LA vs [ 29 Colorectal (sub-site stratified) Pooled analysis (54 studies + 4 Mendelian randomization) Increased risk particularly for rectal cancer. No protective effect observed. Sub-group analysis suggests dose-response relationship, but low-LA intake not studied [ 11 Colon Animal + human tissue (CYP- epoxyoctadecenoic acids mechanism) LA-rich diets led to higher levels of pro-inflammatory epoxyoctadecenoic acids via [ 267 Colon and rectum EPIC-InterAct (plasma phospholipid LA) Plasma LA not significantly associated with colorectal cancer risk. Null finding, but biomarker variability may mask associations. No data on dietary intake below 5% energy from LA [ 268 Kidney Pan-cancer Mendelian randomization Genetically predicted higher LA levels associated with increased kidney cancer risk. Suggests possible causal effect. No reference to real-world low-LA cohorts [ 269 Hepatocellular carcinoma Tumor microenvironment analysis LA uptake enhanced tumor cell proliferation via LINC01116 [ 270 Hepatocellular carcinoma TCGA/ICGC multi-omics prognostic modeling High LA metabolic activity (gene expression signature) correlated with reduced survival and more aggressive tumor phenotypes. LA-related metabolic pathways proposed as therapeutic targets [ 271 Gastric adenocarcinoma EPIC-EURGAST (plasma phospholipids) No significant association between plasma LA and gastric cancer risk. Very limited range of dietary intake in cohort; < 5% energy LA group not present [ 272 Cervical Radiotherapy cohort (serum + fecal metabolomics) Patients with low serum and fecal LA at baseline showed poorer nutritional status and worse treatment response.

Excess LA can promote a cascade of oxidative and inflammatory effects at the cellular level. Chemically, LA’s polyunsaturated structure (18:2, n-6) is highly prone to peroxidation, a chain reaction initiated by ROS. When cell and lipoprotein membranes enriched in LA are exposed to ROS, LA readily oxidizes into reactive aldehydes and other oxidized LA metabolites (OXLAMs)[ 4 44 45 5 Furthermore, the human metabolic apparatus lacks sufficient enzymatic capacity, such as delta-6 desaturase, to rapidly metabolize excess LA, leading to its pronounced bioaccumulation in adipose tissue and cellular membranes[ 4 46 The inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) is primarily composed of phospholipids, with cardiolipin constituting approximately 20% of the total phospholipid content[ 47 48 49 One of the primary biological functions of LA is to enhance the flexibility of mitochondrial cristae, the inner membrane folds within mitochondria[ 3 50 51 52 53 50 The IMM serves as the epicenter of cellular energy production, hosting the ETC responsible for ATP synthesis. While ROS have been recognized as deleterious to cellular function since the mid-20 th 54 55 56 Protected by antioxidants such as manganese superoxide dismutase and glutathione, cardiolipin’s LA content is tightly regulated and does not pose a primary threat[ 57 58 59 60 in vitro The mechanism of destruction hinges on LA’s propensity to undergo lipid peroxidation under oxidative stress, generating toxic byproducts such as 4-HNE. This reactive aldehyde directly damages ETC components, notably complexes I and III, impairing ATP production and amplifying ROS generation in a vicious cycle[ 61 62 62 One particularly toxic LA-derived aldehyde is 4-HNE[ 63 in vitro 64 65 66 MECHANISTIC PATHWAYS LINKING EXCESS LA TO CARCINOGENIC TERRAIN Oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation Historically, strategies to counteract ROS prioritized broad-spectrum mitochondrial antioxidants, yet the pivotal role of LA in noncardiolipin phospholipids was largely ignored[ 62 67 60 68 Approximately 30% of proteins modified by 4HNE in cells are mitochondrial proteins, underlining how LA peroxidation preferentially harms these organelles[ 69 65 43 70 Mitochondrial dysfunction and βoxidation overload Mitochondria are central to cellular metabolism, particularly in energy production via 71 32 72 2 49 73 74 Researchers tested the hypothesis that LA or OXLAMs provided directly through the diet are involved in the development of hepatic injury. C57BL/6 mice were fed an isocaloric high-fat diet containing low LA, high LA, or OXLAMs for 8 weeks. The livers of OXLAM-fed mice showed lower triglyceride concentrations, but higher FA oxidation and lipid peroxidation in association with increased oxidative stress. OXLAM-induced mitochondrial dysfunction was associated with reduced complex I protein and hepatic ATP levels, as well as increased mitochondrial biogenesis and cytoplasmic mitochondrial DNA. Oxidative stress increased thioredoxin-interacting protein in the liver and stimulated the activation of mitochondrial apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 Leading to apoptosis. They also found increased levels of NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome components and Caspase-1 activation in the livers of OXLAM-fed mice[ 75 Impaired autophagy and mitophagy In this context, LA in cardiolipin stabilizes respiratory supercomplexes, enhancing ATP output by up to 30% in cardiac tissue. High levels of LA in cardiolipin are crucial for the formation and stability of respiratory super-complexes in the ETC, which in turn maximize ATP production[ 48 76 When cardiolipin undergoes peroxidation, it triggers significant downstream consequences[ 77 78 via 79 80 Notably, healthy cells can usually remove damaged mitochondria via 81 82 83 84 85 Inflammation and immune activation Dietary LA overload also tilts cellular signaling towards a pro-inflammatory state[ 86 87 88 89 42 Oncometabolites and pseudohypoxia (succinate/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α) Dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism from high LA intake can lead to the accumulation of certain metabolites that activate oncogenic pathways[ 90 91 92 93 94 91 2 via 95 96 4 97 Figure 2  Linoleic acid-induced succinate build-up triggers pseudohypoxic hypoxia-inducible factor-1α stabilization and tumor-promoting glucose transporter type 1/vascular endothelial growth factor signaling. Gut dysbiosis and immune-metabolic interplay Interestingly, the gut microbiome may also contribute to circulating succinate levels[ 98 via 94 Integrative perspective and dietary mitigation Interestingly, the fatty-acid composition of the remaining 80% of phospholipids in the IMM can be modulated through dietary interventions or targeted mitochondrial supplementation[ 99 100 4 3 3 Figure 3  Proposed oxidative cascade linking excess linoleic acid to mitochondrial dysfunction and tumor promotion: Oxidation of membrane-bound linoleic acid yields 4 hydroxynonenal and related oxylipins, which impair mitochondrial respiration, elevate reactive oxygen species, and activate nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells-dependent inflammatory circuits; concurrent gut dysbiosis amplifies systemic cytokine tone, together fostering DNA damage and tumor promotion.

EXCESS LA INTAKE SPARKS OXIDATIVE GUT DYSBIOSIS, ELEVATES SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION Excessive dietary LA can also disrupt the intestinal microbiome, leading to dysbiosis that promotes inflammation[ 24 24 23 23 First, the compromised epithelial monolayer loses its tight metabolic coupling to the gut lumen, permitting molecular oxygen from the richly perfused mucosa to diffuse inward. Oxygen tensions can rise from < 5 mmHg (anaerobic baseline) to > 30 mmHg, a level that selectively suppresses obligate anaerobes like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 101 Escherichia coli, 102 103 4 Beyond the colon, microbial metabolism of LA can yield inflammatory and carcinogenic byproducts. Gut bacteria can oxidize unsaturated fatty acids, producing compounds that trigger epithelial stress or even enter systemic circulation. For example, certain LA-derived oxylipins and secondary bile acids which increase on high-fat diets have been implicated in DNA damage and tumor promotion in the gastrointestinal tract[ 104 Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium 105 106 CARBOHYDRATE RESTRICTION: METABOLIC EFFECTS IN CANCER The high-fat, low-carbohydrate (HFLC) ketogenic diet is increasingly explored in cancer management, leveraging the Warburg effect, where tumor cells preferentially rely on glucose fermentation for energy[ 107 108 109 20 When carbohydrates are restricted, the body activates adaptive mechanisms to maintain euglycemia . 110 111 112 . 113 114 Shifting to fat metabolism heightens dependence on fatty acid oxidation[ 115 115 15 116 117 However, this effect is not universal and appears to depend on factors such as the fatty acid profile of the diet and individual metabolic variability[ 118 119 120 121 Clinical data on ketogenic diets in cancer reveal inconsistent results[ 122 NCT03962647 123 124 While the theoretical foundation for carbohydrate restriction in cancer therapy is rooted in sound scientific reasoning, its practical execution, particularly in the presence of high LA intake, may introduce metabolic complexities that undermine its efficacy[ 125 126 STRESS-INDUCED GLUCONEOGENESIS As noted, strict carbohydrate limitation or metabolic stress engages the body’s fight-or-flight hormones, which can inadvertently support tumor growth[ 127 128 129 130 128 131 Importantly, high-LA diets may inherently provoke greater hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity[ 132 133 134 135 136 137 HORMONAL AMPLIFICATION OF INFLAMMATION Excess LA intake can amplify inflammatory signaling through interactions with the endocrine system[ 138 139 140 141 142 139 via 143 Hyperinsulinemia is another hormonal disturbance tied to high-LA diets that magnifies chronic inflammation[ 4 144 145 146 147 e.g. P 38 Overall, hormonal imbalances induced by an LA-rich diet, including elevated estrogen, insulin/IGF-1, and leptin, converge to sustain a state of smoldering chronic inflammation and cell proliferation[ 148 149 via 20 PENTADECANOIC ACID HELPS REVERSE LA-INDUCED SUCCINATE BUILD-UP Pentadecanoic acid (C15:0), an odd-chain saturated fatty acid enriched in ruminant fat, has emerged as a potential countermeasure to the pseudohypoxic cascade initiated by excess LA[ 150 4 151 Pentadecanoic acid supplementation shortens HIF-1α protein half-life[ 151 150 152 Systemic inflammation fueled by succinate is thus addressed concurrently. Succinate engages the succinate receptor 1 on macrophages, driving IL-1β release[ 91 153 In this context, pragmatic dosing of 100-200 mg pentadecanoic acid per day (roughly one gram of full-fat dairy fat or a single commercial capsule) appears sufficient to normalize plasma levels without displacing essential nutrients[ 154 via 155 MICROBIOME REGRESSION In addition to acute dysbiosis, long-term dietary patterns high in fat and low in complex carbohydrates can cause a regression of gut microbiome diversity[ 156 157 158 Such microbiome regression has multiple implications for cancer[ 159 160 161 162 Bacteroides Enterococcus 163 164 146 Beyond the gut, systemic immunity may suffer from microbiome regression. The education of the immune system by commensal microbes training regulatory T-cells to prevent excessive inflammation is compromised when diversity is lost[ 165 166 167 166 168 KETOGENIC LOW-CARBOHYDRATE DIETS IN A COMPROMISED GUT TERRAIN Ketogenic or other low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes proposed as therapeutic interventions for cancer or metabolic diseases[ 169 170 24 171 In a recent controlled trial, healthy adults on a 12-week ketogenic diet with < 8% of calories from carbohydrates experienced a significant decrease in beneficial gut bacteria, notably Bifidobacteria 172 Bifidobacterium spp. 173 174 172 During the eight-week ketogenic intervention, median fiber intake collapsed to approximately 15 g/day, barely 50% of the 28-30 g/day benchmark set by the National Academies, thereby starving vital obligate anaerobe microbiota of fermentable substrates and diminishing butyrate-producing taxa such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Excluding fermentable carbohydrates in a chronically inflamed, dysbiotic intestine can impede microbial restitution[ 175 Bifidobacterium adolescentis Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 176 Ruminococcus gnavus 177 178 179 Imposing a low carbohydrate regimen on an already dysbiotic intestine is intrinsically double-edged[ 180 181 171 TERRAIN RESTORATION HYPOTHESIS: LOW LA DIET WITH PHASED CARBOHYDRATE REINTRODUCTION The “terrain-restoration” framework is presently hypothetical, a mechanistic model extrapolated from pre-clinical work, small proof-of-concept human studies, and ecological observations. No randomized-controlled trials have yet tested whether the combined strategy of LA minimization, staged carbohydrate re-introduction, microbiota rehabilitation, and mitochondrial supports can reduce cancer incidence or improve oncologic outcomes in humans[ 39 122 171 Addressing the deleterious effects of excess LA requires a multifaceted strategy aimed at restoring metabolic balance and reducing chronic inflammation (Figure 4 182 2 171 122 Figure 4  Four-phase dietary-lifestyle protocol for re-establishing a cancer-resistant metabolic terrain sequential dietary-lifestyle program aimed at restoring a cancer-resistant internal terrain: (1) Strict linoleic acid minimization; (2) Low-residue carbohydrate repletion; (3) Graded fermentable-fiber restoration to repopulate butyrogenic taxa; and (4) Adjunctive metabolic supports (intermittent fasting, pentadecanoic acid, exercise). Emerging technologies, such as conversational-artificial intelligence (AI) platforms, could theoretically assist by parsing ingredient lists, identifying hidden LA sources and suggesting accessible low-LA alternatives[ 183 184 Complementing these AI-guided dietary refinements, activation of intrinsic quality-control pathways directly repairs the organelle damage left behind by prior LA overload, thereby extending metabolic restoration from the pantry to the cellular level[ 185 186 By recycling these damaged organelles and releasing substrates that elevate the NAD + 187 188 189 110 In preclinical studies, intermittent fasting has reduced tumor progression and sensitized cancers to chemotherapy, partly by creating a less favorable metabolic environment for cancer cells[ 190 10 191 192 193 + + 194 Regular physical exercise is perhaps the most powerful mitochondrial therapy as it enhances mitochondrial biogenesis and efficiency, lowers insulin resistance, and reduces systemic chronic inflammation. Thus, an exercise program is an integral part of terrain restoration, helping to correct the sedentary, overfed state that magnifies LA’s harms. In this context, exercise is a crucial component, though its specific contribution to cancer risk reduction in a low-LA framework remains to be quantified. MICROBIAL AND METABOLIC OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES PGC-1α serves as a pivotal catalyst in mitochondrial biogenesis, a fundamental process for sustaining cellular energy homeostasis[ 195 196 197 Furthermore, converging evidence indicates that PGC-1α not only orchestrates mitochondrial biogenesis but also modulates autophagy, particularly mitophagy, thereby reinforcing cellular quality-control networks that can influence oncogenesis[ 198 , 199 201 202 203 In mouse models of melanoma, breast and prostate cancer, enforced PGC-1α expression mitigates the Warburg-type metabolic shift and suppresses tumor growth or metastasis, whereas genetic or epigenetic silencing of PGC-1α has the opposite effect. Nevertheless, the impact of PGC-1α is tissue-specific; in cholangiocarcinoma and certain hematological malignancies, high PGC-1α may instead facilitate invasion, underscoring a context-dependent role[ 204 Reconstituting an optimized microbiota is the second therapeutic pillar. In colons overrun by facultative anaerobes, Enterobacteriaceae, Ruminococcus gnavus 205 206 207 Once gastrointestinal complaints such as gas and bloating normalize, phase 2 introduces slowly digestible tubers, whole fruits, boiled potatoes, sweet potatoes, taro, followed by incremental additions of progressively increasing fermentable carbohydrates[ 208 Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Bifidobacterium adolescentis 209 via 210 To directly counteract the inflammatory and oxidative mediators from LA, certain pharmacological interventions can be employed. Low-dose aspirin, for instance, irreversibly inhibits COX-2, thereby reducing the production of PGE2 and other prostaglandins from AA[ 211 212 213 e.g. 214 via Pharmacologic attenuation of LA-derived eicosanoid signaling can be achieved with low-dose aspirin (75-100 mg/day), which acetylates the catalytic serine of COX-2 and suppresses PGE2 synthesis by approximately 50% within hours[ 215 216 217 Meta-analyses spanning three decades reveal that supraphysiologic antioxidant regimens, ≥ 400 IU/day α-tocopherol coupled with 500 mg/day ascorbate, neither curb cancer incidence nor mortality and may, by quenching beneficial metabolic signaling ROS, blunt exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis[ 218 219 220 Lifestyle and environmental interventions are essential for comprehensive terrain restoration, with optimal sleep hygiene serving as a vital component. Adhering to a consistent sleep regimen of 7-8 hours per night can reduce baseline cortisol concentrations by approximately 20%-30% and dampen sympathetic nervous system activity, thereby attenuating stress-induced gluconeogenesis and systemic inflammation, as indicated by lowered IL-6 Levels[ 221 222 223 224 Equally important, reducing exposure to environmental stressors complements these physiological interventions[ 225 226 227 39 4 8 42 150 228 238 Table 4 Candidate strategies to mitigate linoleic acid-driven metabolic stress: Doses, biomarkers, and evidence landscape  Intervention  Proposed human dose  Primary target  Expected biomarker change  Evidence level  Ref.

LIMITATIONS Although mechanistic data indicate a potential link between excessive intake of LA and oncogenesis, it is crucial to acknowledge the significant limitations and nuances inherent in this relationship[ 4 31 239 Specifically, the balance between omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, overall dietary quality, and individual metabolic profiles may influence the relationship between LA intake and oncogenesis[ 240 241 242 243 245 The majority of mechanistic insights linking LA to carcinogenesis are derived from animal models or in vitro 246 18 247 Additionally, the levels of LA used in these experiments often surpass those commonly encountered in human diets, with some studies administering diets containing up to 10% LA by weight, compared to typical human intakes of 5%-10% of total energy[ 4 248 in vivo 249 Another limitation of the LA-cancer hypothesis is that LA is not uniformly associated with adverse effects[ 250 251 252 38 45 From an oncological perspective, there is a notable absence of long-term RCTs that have specifically evaluated whether reducing dietary LA intake can decrease cancer incidence or mortality rates. Consequently, proposed therapeutic strategies, such as modifying dietary fat composition to lower LA levels or inducing autophagy to mitigate LA-induced cellular stress, are primarily grounded in scientific rationale derived from mechanistic studies and preclinical models, including mouse xenografts[ 253 Furthermore, individual responses to dietary LA are likely to vary due to genetic heterogeneity[ 254 255 e.g. TP53 256 257 While the LA-cancer hypothesis offers a unifying framework for exploring the potential role of dietary fats in oncogenesis, it must be integrated with other well-established preventive measures. These include avoiding tobacco use, controlling oncogenic infections such as human papillomaviru, and maintaining a healthy body weight through balanced nutrition and regular physical activity. In summary, more research, particularly prospective studies in human populations, is essential to determine the extent to which reducing LA intake and implementing terrain-focused therapeutic strategies will translate into measurable reductions in cancer risk or improvements in clinical outcomes. Recognizing these limitations ensures that recommendations are formulated with appropriate scientific caution and reinforces the importance of a holistic, multifactorial approach to cancer prevention and treatment. Prospective human studies will be helpful to quantify LA’s role in cancer risk, ensuring recommendations are evidence-based and integrated into a holistic prevention strategy. PRACTICAL CHALLENGES FOR HUMAN APPLICATION Although reducing dietary LA and restoring a balanced “terrain” is mechanistically compelling, translating these insights into everyday life is non-trivial. Ubiquity of seed-oil LA in the modern food system LA-rich oils are deeply embedded in global supply chains, from restaurant fryers to processed foods and ostensibly “healthy” snacks, making meaningful reduction difficult without substantial label scrutiny or home cooking. Even motivated participants in controlled feeding trials struggled to keep LA < 3% of energy, and biochemical markers ( e.g. 42 6 Measurement and compliance hurdles Self-reported food frequency questionnaires underestimate hidden oils, while objective biomarkers (erythrocyte or adipose fatty-acid profiling) remain costly and are rarely available in clinical practice. Digital solutions, barcode-scanning apps and large-language-model (LLM) chatbots that flag high-LA ingredients, are emerging, but real-world adherence data are sparse[ 182 183 Dietary trade-offs and metabolic side-effects Strategies that cut LA often rely on high-fat or ketogenic templates. Recent randomized data show that a well-formulated ketogenic diet can still impair glucose tolerance, elevate apoB, and erode gut-microbiota diversity within 12 weeks, even under close supervision[ 171 Socio-economic and cultural barriers Low-LA cooking fats ( e.g. Research design constraints Because virtually all industrialized populations consume LA well above ancestral levels, identifying “true” low-LA control groups is challenging. Future trials may need inpatient feeding, isotopic tracers, or recruitment of populations with traditional dietary patterns to disentangle LA effects from other lifestyle variables. LEVERAGING LLM TOOLS TO OVERCOME INGREDIENTIDENTIFICATION BARRIERS Despite growing public interest in lowering dietary LA, many consumers remain unaware that stealth vegetable-oil ingredients such as “high-oleic canola”, “vegetable shortening”, “textured soy protein” are embedded in > 70% of packaged foods. LLM platforms and AI-powered chatbots are now emerging as scalable aides that can: (1) Parse complex ingredient panels in real time; (2) Flag probable high-LA additives; and (3) Suggest lower-LA substitutes within a user’s price and taste constraints. In proof-of-concept studies, AI nutrition assistants have already reduced the time needed to identify hidden fats and allergens by 40%-60%, boosted label-reading accuracy, and increased users’ confidence in making grocery swaps[ 182 183 CONCLUSION The parallel rise of industrial seed oil consumption and cancer rates over the last century warrants investigation into the potential role of modern dietary patterns in modulating cancer risk. While preclinical studies indicate that excess LA intake may promote a pro-tumorigenic environment through mechanisms such as increased oxidative stress through lipid peroxidation, chronic low-grade inflammation, and disruptions in mitochondrial function, it is essential to acknowledge that cancer is a multifactorial disease. LA-rich diets may contribute to cellular dysfunction, including mitochondrial destabilization, impaired autophagy, and shifts in hormonal signaling and gut microbiota composition, which could collectively foster a terrain more conducive to tumor development. This perspective does not negate the established roles of known carcinogens, such as tobacco smoke or ultraviolet radiation, but underscores that dietary factors, as modifiable components, may influence the host environment in ways that either suppress or promote the growth of incipient cancers. Understanding the potential impact of LA on cancer biology opens new avenues for research into preventive and therapeutic strategies. Current dietary guidelines, which have historically prioritized reductions in total fat or saturated fat intake, could benefit from further research to determine the optimal balance of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids and to evaluate the long-term health implications of highly processed seed oils. Furthermore, epidemiological studies are needed to clarify the association between LA intake and cancer risk in human populations, as existing evidence is predominantly derived from animal models and in vitro Additionally, approaches such as intermittent fasting, pharmacological autophagy enhancers, and gut microbiome restoration protocols represent a shift from targeting tumor cells alone to strengthening the host environment. This terrain-centric paradigm posits that when the body’s biochemistry is rebalanced, such as oxidative damage controlled, inflammation quieted, and metabolism optimized directs cancer cells from thriving . In conclusion, the marked increase in fatty acid consumption, driven by the widespread adoption of industrial seed oils over the past century could hypothetically play a role in shaping a metabolic environment that influences cancer risk, though definitive causal relationships remain unestablished. Re-aligning our diets more closely with evolutionary conditions (minimizing refined seed oils and emphasizing whole foods rich in fiber and omega-3s) and addressing the downstream effects of excess LA hold promise for reducing cancer incidence in future generations. Interdisciplinary research integrating nutrition science, oncology, and microbiology will be essential to elucidate the precise role of LA in cancer pathogenesis and to develop evidence-based interventions for prevention and treatment. The challenge moving forward is to translate these insights into public health policies and clinical practices that prioritize cancer-preventive lifestyles alongside early detection and advanced therapeutic modalities.
