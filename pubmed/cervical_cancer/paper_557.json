The narrative immersion model (NIM) suggests that certain structural elements can increase narrative immersion. Notably, these structural elements are often found in naturally occurring diagnostic narratives (i.e., stories focused on diagnoses). Across two studies, the current research tested four NIM‐supported structural elements in the melanoma context.

According to the NIM, there are three levels of immersion (Shaffer et al., 2018 2018 2011 2012 1992 2006 The NIM also describes three different categories of narratives that emerged from prior research to develop a narrative taxonomy, including outcome, process, and experiential narratives (Shaffer et al., 2018 outcome narrative 2013 2018 diagnostic narratives 2018 2011 2019 The current research assesses the effectiveness of several structural elements proposed by the NIM and common to diagnostic narratives across two studies. Although the NIM builds on a strong body of existing narrative persuasion research, more empirical support is needed to test the specific claims of the model and demonstrate its utility as a tool for story building for health communication. Therefore, the current research tests the persuasiveness of four message features—point of view, prologue, time orientation, and story outcome severity—in the context of melanoma prevention. The first study examines the effects of first‐person voice, use of a prologue, and explicit orientation to time. The second study builds on the findings from Study 1 by examining how first‐person voice and use of a prologue interact with story outcome severity. 2 NARRATIVE IMMERSION MODEL 2.1 Diagnostic narratives The NIM posits that health narratives fall within three broad categories depending on their purpose and content, including process, experiential, and outcome narratives (Shaffer et al., 2018 2013 Outcome narratives are “stories about the psychological or physical outcomes of a health‐related event or decision” (Shaffer et al., 2018 2013 diagnostic narrative 2011 Research analyzing illness narratives demonstrates the pervasiveness of the diagnostic narrative (e.g., Banerjee et al., 2018 2014 2003 2017 2018 2019 Diagnostic narratives typically adhere to the three‐act format described by Aristotle, including (1) exposition, (2) rising action to climax, and (3) denouement (or conclusion). According to the NIM, the three‐act format should increase narrative effectiveness (Shaffer et al., 2018 2011 2014 2003 2018 2007 In the second act, narrators recognize that their symptoms are not normal and that it is necessary to seek medical help (Locock et al., 2016 2018 2014 2007 2003 2017 2002 2018 2011 In the third act, narrators provide descriptions of their treatment. These descriptions are typically brief, sometimes limited to a single sentence (Chou et al., 2011 2002 2019 2018 2018 As illustrated by this description, diagnostic narratives can vary in meaningful ways. These variations likely influence the persuasiveness of particular diagnostic narratives when used in health messaging (Shaffer et al., 2018 2.2 Levels of immersion According to the NIM, the magnitude of a narrative's impact is determined by the level of immersion it produces. There are three levels of immersion that form a continuum (Shaffer et al., 2018 2018 2008 2014 2016 2004 2018 2013 2008 The next level, involvement, means audiences are emotionally or mentally invested in the story and the perspective of the character(s) (Shaffer et al., 2018 2001 2015 2012 2013 2022 2011 Finally, audiences may reach the highest level, which is immersion. Immersed audiences are fully transported into the world of the story (Shaffer et al., 2018 2002 2015 2020 2021 2010 2004 2023 2017 Narratives should, therefore, be designed to increase believability, identification, and transportation to best immerse and persuade audiences about cancer risk (Cohen et al., 2015 2020 2018 2.3 Structural elements Beyond the three‐act format, diagnostic narratives commonly include several other structural elements. The NIM supports three of these elements, positing that they will enhance narrative effectiveness via believability, identification, and transportation (Shaffer et al., 2018 Diagnostic narratives are typically told using first‐person voice (Chou et al., 2011 2007 2019 2011 2018 2022 First‐person narratives will produce greater (a) behavioral intention, (b) believability, (c) identification, and (d) transportation compared to third‐person narratives. An explicit orientation to time has been observed across diagnostic narratives (Chou et al., 2011 2003 2002 2018 2015 2019 Narratives with an explicit orientation to time will produce greater (a) behavioral intention, (b) believability, (c) identification, and (d) transportation compared to narratives without an explicit orientation to time. Finally, the NIM suggests that narratives are most persuasive when they are coherent or complete in their overall structure and narrative flow (Shaffer et al., 2018 2011 2019 2015 Narratives with a prologue will produce greater (a) behavioral intention, (b) believability, (c) identification, and (d) transportation compared to narratives without a prologue. How will point of view, time orientation, and prologue interact to affect behavioral intention, believability, identification, and transportation? 3 STUDY 1 The hypotheses and research question were tested in the context of melanoma prevention. Diagnostic narratives shared by melanoma survivors are common on social media, blogs, and other online social settings (Lamprell & Braithwaite, 2018 2021 3.1 Participants and procedure Participants were recruited into a 2 (point of view: first vs. third) × 2 (prologue: yes/no) × 2 (explicit time orientation: yes/no) online message experiment using Qualtrics Panels following approval by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). Qualtrics contacted potential participants from their existing participant pool. Interested individuals followed a link to participate in the message experiment on the Qualtrics survey platform. Following demographic questions, participants were randomized into one of eight narrative conditions. Participants then responded to open‐ended questions about the narrative. Finally, participants answered Likert‐type questions capturing transportation, identification, believability, and intentions. Those who provided nonsensical or incorrect responses to the open‐ended questions (e.g., stating that the story was about COVID‐19) were removed from the study. This is an important strategy for protecting against the inclusion of responses from bots in online surveys (Griffin et al., 2022 1 TABLE 1 Participant demographics.

The illustrations and narrative text were put together in a format with a narrow width and greater length to promote easy consumption via smartphone. Stimuli for Study 1 and Study 2 can be viewed via this OSF link: https://osf.io/h57ug/?view_only=7691b6182e2b44d5a8b69a47cfc8e4c8 The narrative recounted the experience of Emily, a 27‐year‐old woman who was diagnosed with stage III melanoma. The story provides information about Emily's life before cancer, including her love for outdoor summer activities. Emily's cousin Kim notices a strange mole on Emily's arm when they are at the beach together. Emily examines the mole herself and identifies some of the key signs of a problematic mole (e.g., jagged border, strange color, and different from her other moles). She then visits a dermatologist who has the mole biopsied and recommends immediate surgery. The biopsy results return, and Emily receives the melanoma diagnosis. In addition to surgery, she must also have isolated limb perfusion, meaning chemotherapy just in her arm. Emily survives and is currently in remission. Point of view was manipulated to be either first‐ or third‐person. For example, the first‐person sentence “When I got home, I looked at my arm in the mirror” was written as “When Emily got home, she looked at her arm in the mirror” in the third‐person condition. Time orientation was manipulated by including explicit date/time information such as “July 21, 2012 had started like an ordinary Saturday.” In the condition without explicit orientation to time, this sentence read “It had started like an ordinary day.” Finally, the narrative varied in whether it included a prologue. The prologue explained that Emily was diagnosed with stage III melanoma at age 27. In‐line with prologues in naturally occurring melanoma diagnostic narratives (Lamprell & Braithwaite, 2019 Three additional structural elements are common to diagnostic narratives and were, therefore, included in all message conditions: brief orientation to space, direct report speech, and metaphors. Brief orientation to space includes short descriptions of scenes like “when I was lying awake at the hospital” (Chou et al., 2011 2019 2018 2011 2011 2019 2018 2019 3.3 Measures 3.3.1 Skin self‐exam intention Skin self‐exam intention was measured using two items from Jensen et al.

Pairwise comparisons demonstrated that, when stories did not include a prologue, identification was higher for a third‐person narrative ( M M 3.4.5 Transportation ANOVA did not identify any effects of the message conditions or their interactions on transportation. 3.5 Post hoc analyses The main analyses identified significant interactions between point of view and prologue on sunscreen intention and identification. Post hoc analyses used PROCESS model 7 to assess if identification was the mechanism through which the interaction moved intentions. Moderated mediation is present based on the index of moderated mediation having a 95% confidence interval (CI) that does not include zero (Hayes, 2018 Analyses identified a conditional indirect effect of point of view on sunscreen intention via identification (index of moderated mediation = 0.28, BootSE = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.0402, 0.5330). First‐person point of view had a negative indirect effect on sunscreen intention when a prologue was not included (effect = −0.17, BootSE = 0.09, 95% CI = −0.3490, −0.0105) but no indirect effect when a prologue was included (effect = 0.11, BootSE = 0.08, 95% CI = −0.0620, 0.2703). This means that when there was not a prologue, a third‐person narrative resulted in greater sunscreen intention compared to a first‐person narrative via greater identification with the story character. The indirect effects of point of view and prologue on skin self‐exam intention mirrored those for sunscreen intention (see Appendix at OSF link: https://osf.io/h57ug/?view_only=7691b6182e2b44d5a8b69a47cfc8e4c8 4 STUDY 2 The protagonist of the narrative utilized in Study 1 survived and was in remission. Yet, persuasion theory and empirical narrative research suggest that death narratives may be more persuasive than survivor narratives. For example, the terror management health model (TMHM; Goldenberg & Arndt, 2008 Research comparing death and survivor narratives, particularly in the melanoma context, has found that death narratives are usually more persuasive than survivor narratives (e.g., Jensen et al., 2017 2022 2017 2011 2019 First, the interaction between point of view and prologue may be contingent upon story outcome severity (Chen et al., 2015 2017 2022 Second, it is possible that foreshadowing hindered the survivor condition in past studies because the narratives were third‐person (Jensen et al., 2017 2022 How will point of view, prologue, and story outcome severity interact to affect behavioral intention, believability, identification, and transportation? 4.1 Participants and procedure Procedures mirror Study 1. A total of 592 participants were included in Study 2. See Table 1 4.2 Stimuli The same stimuli from Study 1 were used in Study 2, with two key changes. First, all narratives in Study 2 included an explicit orientation to time. Second, the story ending was manipulated so that half of the stories had the survivor ending from Study 1, and half of the stories had a death ending. The death ending explains that “Despite the successful removal of the mole and chemotherapy, additional melanoma tumors were found in the lymph vessels. [Emily/I] tried more treatments, including a clinical trial…But in the end, treatment had come too late.” In both the first‐ and third‐person versions, the final sentence states that “Emily passed away in 2014.” That sentence is also included in the prologue for the first‐ and third‐person death narratives, because foreshadowing death is an important feature of death narratives (Jensen et al., 2017 2022 4.3 Measures The same measures were used from Study 1.

Conditional moderated mediation is present based on the index of moderated–moderated mediation having a 95% CI that does not include zero (Hayes, 2018 Story outcome indirectly affected sunscreen intentions via believability dependent upon point of view and prologue; index of moderated–moderated mediation = −0.18, BootSE = 0.10, 95% CI = −0.4133, −0.0248. Story outcome had a positive indirect effect on sunscreen intentions when a third‐person narrative had a prologue (effect = 0.08, BootSE = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.0041, 0.1873) and when a first‐person narrative did not have a prologue (effect = 0.08, BootSE = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.0003, 0.1912). This means that death narratives positively influenced sunscreen intentions via believability if in third‐person with a prologue or in first‐person without a prologue. Point of view indirectly affected sunscreen intention via believability dependent upon story outcome and prologue; index of moderated–moderated mediation = −0.18, BootSE = 0.10, 95% CI = −0.4133, −0.0244. First‐person point of view had a positive indirect effect on sunscreen intention via believability when a survivor narrative had a prologue (effect = 0.09, BootSE = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.0110, 0.2013) and when a death narrative did not have a prologue (effect = 0.08, BootSE = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.0051, 0.1852). This means that first‐person voice positively influenced sunscreen intentions via believability for survivor narratives with a prologue or death narratives without a prologue. Finally, prologue indirectly affected sunscreen intention via believability dependent upon story outcome and point of view, index of moderated–moderated mediation = −0.18, BootSE = 0.10, 95% CI = −0.4044, −0.0280. Prologue had a positive indirect effect on sunscreen intention via believability for first‐person survivor narratives (effect = 0.08, BootSE = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.0066, 0.1951) and third‐person death narratives (effect = 0.07, BootSE = 0.05, 95% CI = 0.0039, 0.1783). This means that prologues positively influenced sunscreen intentions via believability for first‐person survivor and third‐person death narratives. Indirect effects of the three‐way interaction on skin self‐exam intention via believability mirrored those for sunscreen intention (see Appendix at OSF link: https://osf.io/h57ug/?view_only=7691b6182e2b44d5a8b69a47cfc8e4c8 5 DISCUSSION The NIM (Shaffer et al., 2018 Findings from the current research indicate that the effectiveness of first‐person point of view depends on other story elements. In general, first‐person narratives have been found to be more effective than third‐person narratives (Chen & Bell, 2022 2018 2008 2010 2021 Counter to hypotheses, transportation was not significantly affected by the message manipulations. The studies were powered to detect medium effects. It is possible that larger sample sizes would produce greater power and detect effects on transportation. However, all but one of the f p 4 7 F p Importantly, the findings related to transportation and identification point to two larger implications for the NIM. First, both transportation and identification may be part of the “immersion” level. Character identification likely had a stronger impact than transportation in the current research because melanoma themes were so heavily tied to the protagonist. Thus, the degree to which one became immersed in the narrative through the perspective of this character played an important role. Tal‐Or ( 2016 2018 Second, it is possible that having some of the structural elements proposed by the NIM, in the proper combination, is sufficient to achieve immersion. Having all the elements may not be necessary, and each added element beyond a certain threshold could have diminishing returns. All the narratives used in the current research included a three‐act format, brief orientation to space, use of metaphor, and direct report speech. This may have elevated all the narratives, reducing the effects of the manipulations. Future research should ascertain the dosage of NIM structural elements necessary to achieve immersion as well as use a more bare‐bones narrative as a control. The interaction among story outcome, point of view, and prologue on intentions in Study 2 was explained by narrative believability. These stories are likely perceived as having higher believability because they mirror naturally occurring story structures (Busselle & Bilandzic, 2008 2016 2016 5.1 Limitations and conclusion Despite its contributions, the current research has several key limitations that warrant discussion. First, study questions were assessed in the context of melanoma. Although this was a useful context given the prevalence of melanoma diagnostic narratives (Lamprell & Braithwaite, 2018 2019 2013 2022 Understanding the structural elements that increase persuasion is a priority for health and risk messaging research (e.g., Ma et al., 2023 2014 2018 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, 1DP2EB022360‐01 (PI: J.
