For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) success rates varied in the studies ranging from between 26% to 75.6%, with more than half of the studies having success rates below 50%[ 1 1 2 3 Solid vs liquid biopsies Tissue harvesting including site of cells and amount of tissue taken is also important for establishing successful organoid cultures. The literature highlights how resected tissue provides the greatest number of cells and success rate in establishing organoids; however, clinicians are becoming more inclined to research liquid biopsies (LBs) like blood or bile as it is less invasive[ 1 4 5 1 1 6 1 7 8 8 Pharmacogenomics and drug sensitivities Precision medicine or pharmacotyping is one of the main aims of using PDOs. Using a range of genetic analysis techniques like next generation sequencing and whole exome sequencing, oncologists can assess the suitability of comparing the validity of PDO drug sensitivity testing for primary tumour response[ 1 et al 1 1 9 10 13 5 11 13 Limitations of organoids The article raises awareness about the limitations of organoids due to failure to represent the tumour microenvironment.
