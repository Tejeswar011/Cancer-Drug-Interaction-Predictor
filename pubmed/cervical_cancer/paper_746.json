Conventional chemotherapy often has limited effectiveness and severe systemic side effects. This study explores a localized, topical delivery system using cisplatin-loaded nanomembranes as a safer and more targeted alternative. Cell viability assays established the safe cisplatin concentrations for tissue culture. Gelatin-based nanomembranes incorporating cisplatin were fabricated via electrospinning. Biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy were tested by applying the membranes to cultured melanoma and normal skin cells. Controlled drug release profiles were evaluated by adjusting cross-linking times. Cisplatin concentration between 3.125 and 12.5 µg/mL were found safe. Nanomembranes with these doses effectively eliminated melanoma cells with minimal harm to healthy skin cells. Drug-free membranes showed high biocompatibility. Cross-linking duration allowed tunable and stable drug release. Cisplatin-loaded gelatin nanomembranes offer a promising topical therapy for melanoma, enhancing drug targeting while reducing systemic toxicity. This approach may serve as a cost-effective alternative to systemic treatments like immunotherapy. Future research will focus on in vivo testing and clinical application. melanoma cisplatin chemotherapy drug delivery gelatin nanomembrane National Science and Technology Council, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC NSTC 112-2314-B-039-049-MY2 This work was supported by the National Science and Technology Council, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC (NSTC 112-2314-B-039-049-MY2). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Malignant melanoma is recognized as one of the most aggressive and deadly forms of skin cancer. Although it comprises only about 3% of all diagnosed skin cancer cases, it is responsible for approximately 65% of all skin cancer deaths [ 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 Current standard treatments for metastatic melanoma—following wide surgical excision—include immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors [ 2 7 8 9 10 7 11 7 12 7 12 13 14 Nanotechnology, a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field, has catalyzed transformative advances in medicine, particularly in diagnostics, tissue engineering, gene therapy, and drug delivery [ 15 16 17 17 18 19 17 19 20 Several studies have highlighted the efficacy of nanofiber-based drug delivery in cancer therapy. For instance, Tseng et al. developed a biodegradable electrospun membrane loaded with carmustine, irinotecan, and cisplatin to treat glioblastoma multiforme, reporting high drug release with minimal brain inflammation in both in vitro and in vivo models [ 21 22 19 23 To address these challenges, this study aims to develop electrospun gelatin nanomembranes as a localized drug delivery system for melanoma treatment. Gelatin, a natural polymer derived from collagen, was selected for its biocompatibility and structural similarity to the extracellular matrix [ 18 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Design Plan The design process starts with preliminary experimentation to study the cytotoxicity of cisplatin to cell cultures at different concentrations, and the resulting data guide the fabrication of drug-carrying nanomembranes. The nanomembranes are then characterized and evaluated in vitro with cell cultures; then, the nanomembrane is redesigned ( Figure 1 Scheme 1 2.2. Cell Culture L929 fibroblasts ((ATCC # CCL-1): C3H/An male mouse fibroblast cell line), B16F10 melanoma cells ((ATCC ® v v v v v v 2.3. CCK-8 Cell Viability Assay The MTT assay determined the cytotoxicity, and the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay measured the cell viability [ 24 25 4 2 2.4. Electrospinning As the structure and arrangement of collagen bear a strong similarity between human and porcine [ 26 2 Figure 1 2.5. Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) The fixed scaffolds were carefully mounted onto aluminum stubs and sputter-coated with gold to enhance surface conductivity and minimize charging effects. The morphological features and elemental compositions were examined using the Hitachi S-4500 field emission scanning electron microscope (Tokyo, Japan). The microscope was operated at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a 9.0 mm working distance to ensure high-resolution imaging. SEM provided a visual micrograph of the nanomembrane surface, while the EDX system yielded precise identification and quantification of element distributions. 2.6. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Analysis At the time of spectroscopy (Nicolet iS20, Thermo Fisher, Taipei, Taiwan), vials containing 5 mg of freeze-dried composite fabrics analyzed in this study were ground and mixed thoroughly with 95 mg of potassium bromide. A small amount of this mixed powder was put in the sample holder of a PerkinElmer Spectrum One instrument equipped with a TGF detector and analyzed using the DRIFT (Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform) method. Pure potassium bromide was used as the control for background spectra. For each spectrum, a total of 3600 scans, at 1 cm −1 −1 2.7. Cell Viability with Cisplatin-Incorporated Nanomembrane L929 fibroblasts, B16F10 melanoma cells, and HaCaT human keratinocytes were cultured and prepared as previously mentioned. Freshly harvested cells (3 × 10 5 Table 1 2.8. Release Rate Studies Platinum traces can be determined in the form of the PtCl(6)(2-) complex I hydrochloric acid solution by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm; due to the limitation of UV–visible spectrophotometry, ketoprofen was used instead of cisplatin for release profiling in this study. Briefly, ketoprofen was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (K1751, Saint Louis, MO 63103, USA). The controlled release tests were prepared using electrospinning as described above, with 50 mg ketoprofen instead of 5 mg cisplatin. For the standard curve of ketoprofen, 50 mg of ketoprofen was weighed accurately and dissolved it in 100 mL of methanol to prepare the stock solution. The prepared stock solution was subsequently diluted with 5 mL of 0.05 M phosphate buffer to obtain solution concentrations of 1.563, 3.125, 12.5, 25, and 50 μg/mL. The electro-spun fiber mats were collected, and the as-spun fibers were dried in a vacuum oven at 30 °C for 24 h and then exposed to 1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at room temperature for 0, 12, or 48 h. Fibers for cell culture were immersed in a 0.1 M glycine aqueous solution for 1 h to abate the toxicity of residue aldehyde groups to cells, followed by sterilization by dipping in 70% ( v v At each pre-determined time period, a dissolution test was performed on 4 samples. An amount of 100 mL of distilled water was used as the dissolution medium. Samples from the dissolution medium were withdrawn using a syringe at intervals of 1 day, and every day up to 7 days from all 4 vessels for all the formulations. They were then placed separately in labeled test tubes. The absorption of maximum ketoprofen was measured at 260 nm using a UV–Visible Evolution 60 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). A new standard curve was freshly prepared for every dissolution test. The mean absorbance values of the 4 samples were then converted to drug concentrations, and the percentage of drug release was plotted [ 27 2.9.

Discussion Chemotherapy remains a cornerstone of cancer treatment, aimed at controlling tumor progression and prolonging patient survival. However, systemic chemotherapy is often accompanied by limited efficacy and severe side effects, largely due to non-specific drug distribution to healthy tissues [ 30 31 32 33 34 Postoperative recurrence following malignant tumor resection remains a significant concern. Localized drug delivery during surgical excision may reduce the risk of recurrence and systemic metastasis. Cisplatin, widely used for solid tumors including sarcomas, has demonstrated potential for intraoperative application at low doses to reduce local recurrence [ 35 Cytotoxicity evaluation is critical for determining the clinical feasibility of anticancer therapies. In this study, the CCK-8 assay—a widely accepted method for assessing cellular metabolic activity—was used to quantify the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin [ 36 Cisplatin induces cytotoxicity through mechanisms such as DNA cross-linking and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, selectively targeting cancer cells due to their rapid proliferation and higher oxidative stress [ 12 37 When cisplatin was embedded within nanofibrous gelatin membranes, its cytotoxic effects on melanoma cells increased significantly, while normal fibroblasts and keratinocytes showed minimal damage [ 38 39 Gelatin-based nanofibers are gaining attention in drug delivery systems (DDS) due to their excellent biocompatibility, tunable degradation rates, and ease of chemical modification [ 40 21 22 18 Recent advancements in nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems aim to overcome challenges such as bacterial resistance and the limited efficacy of traditional cancer therapies. Conventional systemic administration of chemo- and immunotherapeutics often leads to off-target effects and unpredictable outcomes. Nanomedicine offers promising solutions through targeted, multimodal delivery platforms that improve pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and tumor localization of therapeutic agents [ 41 42 43 Gelatin has emerged as a valuable biomaterial in drug delivery due to its biocompatibility and functional versatility. As an energy-absorbing layer in laser bioprinting, it improves cell viability and reduces DNA damage [ 44 45 46 47 Melanoma, a highly aggressive and treatment-resistant cancer, benefits from local drug delivery approaches that minimize systemic toxicity. Due to its high mutational burden, melanoma presents numerous neoantigens, allowing immune system recognition [ 48 Table 2 22 49 Ketoprofen was selected as a model compound for drug release characterization due to practical analytical constraints associated with direct quantification of cisplatin using UV–Vis spectroscopy. Cisplatin lacks a strong chromophore, making its detection in complex biological matrices such as gelatin challenging without advanced instrumentation. In contrast, ketoprofen exhibits a strong UV absorbance peak at ~260 nm, allowing for straightforward, reproducible quantification of release kinetics using standard UV–Vis techniques. This substitution has clear limitations. Cisplatin’s chemical behavior—including potential interactions with functional groups in the gelatin matrix (e.g., amines, thiols), aquation dynamics, and ionic state—can significantly influence its release profile in ways that ketoprofen does not replicate. Additionally, the hydrophobicity of ketoprofen may lead to an underestimation of matrix–drug interactions relevant to cisplatin. Therefore, while ketoprofen serves as a practical proxy for initial kinetic modeling and formulation optimization, it should not replace direct cisplatin release studies for final translational assessment [ 50 This study has several limitations: (1) The murine B16-F10 melanoma cell line was selected for its well-established use in preclinical melanoma research; the absence of a human melanoma cell line, such as A375, limits the direct translational relevance to human disease. (2) Cytotoxic effects were assessed morphologically; quantitative assays are needed for confirmation. (3) This study used in vitro models; future research will involve 3D bioprinted skin and hydrogel-based tissue mimics [ 51 Nanoparticles provide targeted, sustained drug release while minimizing systemic side effects. Despite challenges in maintaining nanocarrier stability in circulation [ 52 53 5. Conclusions Embedding cisplatin into gelatin nanomembranes for local application not only reduces systemic toxicity and total drug usage but also lowers production costs. These nanomembranes may also be used for tumor vessel embolization, offering a less invasive alternative to open surgery. Controlled cross-linking and degradation rates can enable stable, time-regulated cisplatin release at therapeutic levels without systemic toxicity.
