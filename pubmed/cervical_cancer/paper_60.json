Background Constipation is a common gastrointestinal disorder with significant public health implications, particularly among aging populations. Current treatment options often exhibit limited efficacy and may have potential side effects, underscoring the necessity for safer and more effective alternatives. Postbiotics, which are bioactive metabolites derived from probiotics, have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their stability, safety, and multifunctional properties. Postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic has demonstrated potential in alleviating constipation; however, its mechanisms-particularly regarding the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis and the gut microenvironment-remain to be fully elucidated. Methods This study employed murine models of loperamide-induced constipation and in vitro Results Postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic significantly downregulated apoptotic (CASP3, CASP9) and pyroptotic (NLRP3, GSDMD, CASP1) pathway components while restoring the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bax/Bcl-2). Additionally, this postbiotic selectively modulated immune responses by reducing Th2/Th17-type cytokines (IL-2, IL-17A), without affecting Th1-type responses. Network analysis revealed that the action of hawthorn-probiotic postbiotics involves multiple targets including CASP8/CASP3-mediated cell death as well as STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathways. Conclusions Postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic demonstrates efficacy in alleviating constipation through the multi-pathway inhibition of apoptosis and pyroptosis, alongside the remodeling of the immune microenvironment. Its multi-target mechanism and favorable safety profile position it as a promising therapeutic candidate. These findings lay a solid foundation for the development of interventions based on hawthorn-probiotic postbiotics for constipation and related gastrointestinal disorders. postbiotic hawthorn probiotic constipation apoptosis pyroptosis inflammation immune modulation The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

This condition is experiencing a significant upward trend ( 1 2 3 4 μ 5 6 PANoptosis, a comprehensive mode of cell death, incorporates core features of Pyroptosis, Apoptosis and/or Necroptosis ( 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Recent studies have shown that certain probiotics and their metabolites (epigenin) can inhibit intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis through multiple pathways. Extracellular polysaccharide secreted by L9 of Lactobacillus plantarum 14 Bifidobacteria 15 Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 16 Lactobacillus Lactobacillus paracasei 17 18 This study investigates the anti-constipation mechanism of postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic (HP) from the perspective of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis regulation. By delineating HP’s role in modulating apoptotic pathways, this research will provide novel insights into its multi-target regulatory mechanisms, while offering a theoretical foundation for developing next-generation constipation therapies with enhanced efficacy and safety. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Preparation of hawthorn aqueous extract and postbiotic The preparation protocol is based on our previous research ( 19 Lactobacillus paracasei  Supplementary Table S1 9 2.2 Animal experiments Male KM mice (240-day-old) were purchased from Guangzhou Regal Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (SCXK [Yue] 2023-0059; SYXK [Yue] 2023-0182) and housed under controlled conditions (25 ± 2°C, 12 h light/dark cycle) with free access to food and water. All experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Following a 1-week acclimatization, mice were randomly divided into five groups (n = 5): the normal control group (N) received daily distilled water gavage, while the remaining mice were administered loperamide (5 mg/kg/day) for 7 days to establish a constipation model. Subsequently, constipated mice were assigned to four groups: model group (M) (no intervention), hawthorn group (H) (0.2 mL/day hawthorn aqueous extract, 1 g/mL), probiotics group (P) (0.2mL Lactobacillus paracasei 2.3 Preparation of gut microenvironment-mimicking conditioned medium To simulate the gut microenvironment in vitro 20 2.4 Cell culture NCM460 cells (National Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures, China) were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA), CaCO2 cells (National Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures, China) were maintained in DMEM medium (Gibco, USA). Cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco, USA) at 37°C under a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. 2.5 RNA isolation and quantitative analysis Total RNA was extracted from colon tissues using FreeZol Reagent (Vazyme, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA synthesis and genomic DNA removal were performed with the HiScript IV 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (+gDNA wiper, Vazyme, China). Quantitative PCR was conducted using ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme,China) in 20 μL reactions under the following conditions: 95°C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C (15 s) and 60°C (30 s). GAPDH served as the reference gene for normalization. Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method, with all reactions performed in triplicate.

Lysates were incubated at 4°C for 30 min, centrifuged (12,000 × g, 15 min), and supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay kit (Beyotime, China). Equal protein amounts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk for 1 h, incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies Caspase 1 (1:1000, M025280, Abmart), NLRP3(1:1000, P60622R3, Abmart), GSDMD(1:1000, PU224937 2.7 Fluorescence microscopy detection Cells were seeded in culture dishes according to experimental design. After treatment, the medium was aspirated, and cells were washed once with PBS before adding YP1/PI working solution (Beyotime, China). Following a 15-min incubation in the dark, fluorescence was observed under an inverted microscope with excitation/emission wavelengths of 491/509 nm (YP1, green) and 535/617 nm (PI, red). 2.8 Cell viability assay Cells (8,000/well) were seeded in 96-well plates. After adherence, fresh conditioned medium containing 10 μg/mL LPS (Sigma, USA) or gut microenvironment-mimicking conditioned medium (H, P, HP) was added. At 24 h, 10 μL CCK-8 reagent (NCM Biotech, China) was introduced, and absorbance at 450 nm was measured after 2 hours incubation using a multimode microplate reade. 2.9 Flow cytometry Cells treated for 24 h were harvested by centrifugation (300 × g, 5 min), washed with PBS, and resuspended in 500 μL 1×Buffer. Add Annexin V-FITC/PI (5 μL each, Elabscience, China) or YO-PRO-1/PI (0.5ul each, beyotime,China), mix gently, and incubate for 15–20 min at room temperature in the dark. The apoptosis rate was analyzed using a flow cytometer (BD Accuri C5, USA). 2.10 Identification of major components in the postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic The sample pretreatment process is as follows: Take 100 μL of postbiotic liquid sample, add 400 μL of pre-chilled methanol, vortex mix, then incubate at -20°C for 30 minutes to precipitate proteins. Centrifuge at 20,000 rcf at 4°C for 15 minutes, transfer 400 μL of the supernatant to a new tube, centrifuge again, and transfer the supernatant to a sample vial for analysis. All operations are performed on ice. Concurrently, equal volumes of each sample are mixed to prepare quality control (QC) samples for system stability monitoring. Chromatographic separation is performed using a Thermo Vanquish Flex UPLC system equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC T3 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm), with a column temperature of 40°C and a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min. Mobile phase A is an aqueous solution containing 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate and 5 mmol/L acetic acid, and phase B is acetonitrile. The gradient elution program is as follows: 0–20 min, phase B increases from 5% to 70%; 22–25 min, phase B increases to 95% and remains constant; 25.1–30 min, phase B decreases to 5% for column equilibration. Mass spectrometry detection was performed using an Orbitrap Exploris 120 mass spectrometer, with data collected in both positive and negative ion modes. Ion source parameters were set as follows: curtain gas pressure 1, auxiliary gas pressure 12, sheath gas pressure 50, ion source temperature 350°C; positive ion mode spray voltage +3800 V, negative ion mode –3400 V. Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode was used: primary scan range m/z 70–1050, resolution 60,000; the top 4 ions with a selected intensity exceeding 5000 were selected for secondary fragmentation, with a secondary resolution of 15,000 and a dynamic exclusion time set to 6 s. A QC sample was inserted every 10 samples to monitor and correct system errors. 2.11 Network pharmacology analysis Potential targets of HP were predicted using the SwissTargetPrediction and SuperPred databases, followed by standardization in UniProt. Constipation-related targets were identified from OMIM and GeneCards using “constipation” as a keyword, while PANoptosis-related genes were obtained by searching “pyroptosis,” “apoptosis,” and “necroptosis” in GeneCards, yielding 261 unique genes after deduplication ( 21  Supplementary Table S2 22 2.12 Statistical analysis The statistical analyses and graphical representations of the experimental data were expressed as “mean ± standard deviation” and performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Levene's test was employed to assess homogeneity of variance. If the test indicated significant variance (p < 0.05), further comparisons between groups were conducted using ordinary one-way ANOVA. If variance was found to be heterogeneous (p ≥ 0.05), subsequent analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. 3 Results 3.1 Postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic protect the intestinal barrier by altering the intestinal microenvironment to mitigate PANoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells As shown in the previous study, the model group (M) mice exhibited typical constipation symptoms (decreased frequency of defecation, dry feces, etc.), whereas the three drug groups, hawthorn (H), probiotics (P), postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic (HP) all significantly improved these symptoms, with the most significant effect in the HP group ( 19  Figure 1A 24  Figure 1B  Figure 1C Figure 1 Postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic can alleviate apoptosis and pyroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells by altering the intestinal microenvironment.

Three groups of therapeutic interventions showed significant anti-apoptotic effects: the H group exhibited 10.88% apoptosis, the P group 9.55%, and the HP group 7.89% - all significantly lower than the M group (p < 0.001). Notably, the HP group produced the most robust reduction (  Figures 1D, E  Figure 1F 3.1.2 Blockade of NLRP3-GSDMD pyroptosis by microenvironment remodeling In pyroptosis, NLRP3 initiates inflammatory vesicle assembly by recognizing exogenous and exogenous signals; Caspase-1 shears Gasdermin D and catalyzes IL-1β/IL-18 maturation; and the formation of membrane pores by GSDMD mediates cell rupture and inflammatory mediator release. We examined the mRNA and protein expression levels of these genes, and found that the expression levels of the genes related to pyroptosis were significantly higher in group M and lower in groups H, P and HP. (  Figures 1G–I 3.1.3 Attenuation of ZBP1-driven necroptosis through microenvironmental regulation Necroptosis was detected by YO-PRO-1/PI staining in each group. Fluorescence microscopy showed an increase in the number of both YO-PRO-1-positive (green fluorescence) and PI-positive (red fluorescence) cells in the M group compared with the N group, while the number of double-staining-positive cells was significantly reduced in the HP group (  Figure 2A  Figures 2B, C 25  Figure 2D Figure 2 Postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic can alleviate necroptosis in intestinal epithelial cells by altering the intestinal microenvironment.

Meanwhile, the results in the HP group were decreased compared with those in the M group (  Figures 4A–D  Figure 4E Figure 4 Postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic alleviates constipation-induced pyroptosis in the mouse colon.

Asterisks indicate statistical significance levels. 3.3 Postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic alleviates constipation and reshapes intestinal homeostasis by regulating the balance between inflammation and defense In the previous study, we found that the white medulla of the spleen in group M mice was blurred and the distribution of immune cells was reduced. The above lesions were significantly alleviated in group HP. Therefore, we further analyze the proportion of spleen lymphocyte subgroup. The proportion of CD3+CD4+ T cells in the spleen of mice in group M was significantly increased, suggesting excessive activation of helper T cells under constipation. The proportion of this subgroup in group HP was significantly adjusted back, indicating that it can block the inflammatory cascade reaction by inhibiting the abnormal proliferation of CD4+ T cells. The proportion of IL-2+ CD4+ T cells in group M reached 40.2%. This excessive activation might suggest that in constipation, the spleen exacerbates the hyperactivity of intestinal mucosal immune response by promoting B cell differentiation. However, after HP intervention, this proportion dropped sharply to 24.7%, directly confirming its inhibitory effect on the humoral immune pathway. The abnormal expansion of IL-17A+ CD4+ T cells in group M constitutes another key pathological link. The IL-17 secreted by them can induce neutrophil infiltration and intestinal barrier dysfunction. The significant decrease after HP intervention indicates that it can effectively block this pro-inflammatory axis. It is worth noting that although Th1-type IFN-γ+ CD4+ T cells showed a slight decrease of 0.12% in the model group, the HP group maintained a basal level of 0.32%. This non-statistically significant change precisely reflects the immunomodulatory wisdom of the preparation - inhibiting excessive inflammation while retaining the IFN-γ -mediated antiviral defense function. The IL-2+ subset in CD8+ T cells of group M expanded to 14.9%. This enhanced cytokine secretion may aggravate immunopathological damage. Although it slightly decreased after HP intervention, it was not statistically significant, suggesting that it balanced the cytotoxic effect and tissue protection by moderately inhibiting IL-2. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the proportion of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells among the groups. This selective regulation ensured that the direct killing function of cytotoxic T cells was not inhibited, providing an immune barrier for eliminating potential intestinal pathogens. This bidirectional regulatory model, which both inhibits excessive inflammation and retains necessary defenses, ultimately constructs a brand-new regulatory paradigm of intestinal immune homeostasis by reshaping the Th1/Th2/Th17 balance and precisely regulating the function of CD8+ T cells (  Figure 6  Supplementary Figure S1 Figure 6 Characterization of T-lymphocyte subpopulations and cytokine secretion in the mouse spleen.

Each condition is represented in columns, with corresponding box plots for spleen data on CD4+ T cell frequencies, showing statistical significance levels. 3.4 Network pharmacology analysis To further investigate the mechanism by which postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic(HP) treats constipation by alleviating Panoptosis, we performed network pharmacological analyses. Based on the intersecting genes, we observed 40 significant PANoptosis-related genes in HP treatment of constipation (gene names were shown in  Supplementary Table S3  Figures 7A, B  Figure 7C  Figure 7D Figure 7 Network pharmacology analysis.

Panel E is a bar graph comparing BP, CC, and MF based on -log10(p) values. 4 Discussion Although this study illustrates the mechanism by which hawthorn probiotic postbiotics (HP) alleviate constipation by regulating the intestinal microenvironment, thereby inhibiting PANoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, there are still several limitations that need to be further analyzed in subsequent studies. Constipation has long been regarded as a functional disorder, but recent studies have shown that low-grade inflammation and intestinal epithelial barrier damage play a key role in its pathogenesis ( 26 27 28 29  Supplementary Figure S2 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 in vivo This study also investigated changes in splenic T lymphocyte subsets, with these immune markers reflecting systemic and mucosal immune imbalance in constipation. Abnormal proliferation of IL-17A+ CD4+ T (Th17) cells is a core feature of constipation-related inflammation. Th17 cells secrete large amounts of IL-17, which recruits neutrophils and disrupt epithelial tight junctions, consistent with reported immune cell infiltration and impaired barrier function in the colonic mucosa of constipated patients ( 38 39 In this study, network pharmacology analysis provided valuable mechanistic hypotheses for future research. The top predicted targets TP53, TNF, and STAT3 were highly correlated with the core pathophysiology observed in our model. TP53 is a key regulator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ( 40 41 42 in vitro in vivo This study reveals a new mechanism by which HP alleviates constipation from the perspective of proteins and immune markers. HP achieves this by synergistically inhibiting the three key death execution proteins CASP3, GSDMD, and MLKL, thereby completely blocking pan-optosis and protecting epithelial barrier integrity. Concurrently, it precisely regulates the Th17/Th1 balance to alleviate inflammation while preserving defensive functions, thereby reestablishing immune homeostasis. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the application of HP in preventive strategies for constipation and related functional gastrointestinal disorders. 5 Conclusion This study deeply analyzed the multi-level mechanism of action of Postbiotic of hawthorn-probiotic (HP) in alleviating constipation and regulating intestinal homeostasis, revealing its systematic strategy of achieving intestinal protection by inhibiting the pan-optotic pathway, reshaping the immune balance and regulating the gene expression network. Studies have confirmed that HP significantly improves constipation symptoms by reconstructing the intestinal microenvironment. Its effect is not only reflected in the increase of the survival rate of intestinal epithelial cells, Furthermore, by blocking CASP3/CASP9-mediated apoptosis, inhibiting pyroptosis driven by the NLRP3-GSDMD axis, and regulating necrotic apoptosis in the ZBP1-MLKL pathway, a triple inhibitory effect on the pan-optotic pathway is formed. This protective effect is manifested at the tissue level as the specific down-regulation of the expression of key executive molecules such as CASP3, GSDMD and MLKL in colon tissue, confirming the complete protective chain of HP from cell death regulation to tissue repair. In the dimension of immune regulation, HP demonstrates precise immune regulatory capabilities: By inhibiting the excessive activation of Th2/Th17 cells, the hyperactivity of humoral immunity and neutrophil infiltration were blocked. Meanwhile, the Th1-type immune response and the direct killing function of CD8+ T cells are retained, establishing a bidirectional regulatory model of “anti-inflammation - defense protection”. The reconstruction of this immune homeostasis is highly consistent with the prediction results of network pharmacology. HP targets 40 core genes such as EGFR, GSK3B, and ALOX15, interferes with the NF-κB, IL-17, and TNF signaling axes, and forms a multi-level regulatory network of “gene - protein - pathway”. The research not only clarified the molecular basis of HP in the treatment of constipation, but also provided a theoretical basis for the development of new postbiotic preparations with both intestinal protection and immune regulation functions, suggesting its translational medical potential to achieve organ homeostasis regulation through epigenetic modification and microenvironment remodeling.
