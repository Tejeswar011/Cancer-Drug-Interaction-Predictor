See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in human health, influencing diverse physiological processes, including those related to sexual health. Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship between the gut microbiota and sexual health, mediated by its impact on systemic inflammation, hormonal regulation, and immune function. A balanced gut microbiota supports optimal levels of sex hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone, which are critical for sexual function and reproductive health. Additionally, gut-derived metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids contribute to maintaining mucosal barrier integrity and regulating immune responses, which are essential for protecting against infections that may impair sexual health. Conversely, dysbiosis, an imbalance in gut microbial composition, has been linked to conditions such as erectile dysfunction, polycystic ovary syndrome, and reduced libido, emphasizing its role in sexual dysfunction. Lifestyle factors, including diet, stress, and antibiotic use, can modulate the gut microbiota and, consequently, sexual health outcomes. Recent therapeutic approaches, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, offer potential for restoring gut balance and improving sexual health. This review highlights the central role of the gut microbiota in sexual health, emphasizing its importance as a target for therapeutic interventions to enhance overall well-being.

This complex and dynamic ecological community plays a vital role in regulating physiological functions and influencing susceptibility to disease through its metabolic activities and interactions with the host organism[ 1 2 3 Bacterial genera such as Enterococcus Ruminococcus Bacteroides Bifidobacterium Akkermansia muciniphila Clostridioides difficile Salmonella Helicobacter pylori Escherichia coli O157 Bacteroides fragilis Fusobacterium nucleatum 4 Recent years have seen exponential growth in scientific interest surrounding the microbiota, fueled by discoveries of its impact not only on systemic health but also on sexual health. This relationship extends far beyond physical aspects, deeply influencing the emotional and psychological dimensions of sexuality. Sexual health, defined as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being in relation to sexuality, is now understood as a multifaceted component of overall health that interacts with immune, endocrine, and neuropsychological systems[ 5 Emerging evidence suggests a bidirectional connection between gut microbiota and sexual health, mediated by its effects on systemic inflammation, hormonal regulation, and immune function[ 6 7 The interplay between gut microbiota and sexual health also includes interactions with the central nervous system (CNS). Known as the gut-brain axis, this complex communication pathway influences sexual behavior by modulating neurological and neurochemical processes tied to mood, desire, and sexual response[ 8 9 The composition of the gut microbiota is shaped by various factors, including[ 10 11 12 13 14 Dysbiosis is closely associated with sexual health conditions, including erectile dysfunction (ED), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and reduced libido. It impacts sexual function through its effects on systemic inflammation, hormonal regulation, and immune system function. In ED, dysbiosis aggravates endothelial dysfunction by increasing inflammation and impairing nitric oxide production, which is essential for blood flow[ 15 16 17 This intricate connection between microbiota and sexuality highlights the need for therapeutic interventions to restore microbial balance and enhance sexual health. Emerging strategies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation, offer promising avenues for improving both systemic and sexual well-being[ 18 HUMAN MICROBIOTA AND VAGINAL MICROBIOME: COMPOSITION, DIVERSITY, AND HEALTH IMPLICATIONS The human microbiota is a diverse community of microorganisms that colonizes both internal and external surfaces of the human body. The collective genetic material of these microorganisms constitutes the human microbiome. Primarily symbiotic, the microbiota derives benefit from its host. These host-microbe interactions can be neutral (commensalism), beneficial (mutualism), or, under certain circumstances, detrimental (pathogenicity), impacting physiological processes, immune responses, and nutrient acquisition[ 19 The human vaginal microbiota (VMB) constitutes a complex and dynamic ecosystem of beneficial microorganisms and opportunistic pathogens that coexist within the vaginal environment[ 20 21 22 COMPOSITION AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE VMB The composition and structure of the VMB have been extensively characterized, utilizing methods ranging from traditional microscopy to advanced high-throughput sequencing technologies[ 19 Lactobacillus 23 Five major microbial CSTs have been identified among reproductive-age women based on the relative abundance and composition of vaginal bacterial species[ 21 24 Lactobacillus crispatus L. gasseri L. iners L. jensenii Lactobacillus Anaerococcus Peptoniphilus Corynebacterium Prevotella Finegoldia Streptococcus Atopobium Gardnerella Sneathia Mobiluncus Megasphaera Clostridiales order 21 24 CST-IV has been strongly associated with vaginal dysbiosis, particularly bacterial vaginosis (BV), according to the Nugent scoring system. However, research has demonstrated the prevalence of CST-IV in asymptomatic individuals, notably among Black and Hispanic women, where it constitutes approximately 40% of cases[ 24 DISCOVERY OF NEW VAGINAL BACTERIAL SPECIES Recent research has identified a novel bacterial genus, Vaginella massiliensis Flavobacteriaceae Bacteroidetes 25 Vaginella massiliensis FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO LACTOBACILLUS The predominance of Lactobacillus 26 2 2 Lactobacillus 27 Lactobacillus 28 29 Lactobacillus 30 Lactic acid  Lactobacilli Lactobacillus 31 32 Lactic acid within the vagina exists in two isomeric forms, D (–) and L (+). It has been proposed that glycogen availability in the vaginal lumen increases due to the exfoliation of glycogen-rich epithelial cells, a process mediated by hyaluronidase-1 and matrix metalloproteinase activity. This, in turn, leads to the degradation of available glycogen by α-amylase, subsequently converted into D (–) lactic acid by Lactobacilli Recent studies suggest that lactic acid, particularly the L (+) isomer, can inhibit Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 infection independently of pH reduction[ 33 34 35 Lactic acid has also been shown to inhibit a range of infections, including Chlamydia trachomatis 33 36 38 34 39 via 40 41 Bacteriocins  Bacteriocins Bacteriocin IIa IIc Acidocin LF221A Gassericin T type-A Lantibiotic, Lactobacilli L. crispatus L. gasseri 42 S. aureus Klebsiella spp. E. faecalis E. coli 42 H 2 2 H 2 2 in vitro Lactobacillus 2 43 2 2 2 et al 36 2 2 2 2 2 Lactobacilli 36 Conversely, earlier studies suggested that hydrogen peroxide-producing vaginal Lactobacilli Candida 44 Lactobacilli 2 2 CANDIDA AND ITS ROLE IN THE VMB The VMB of healthy, reproductive-age women includes a fungal component, commonly termed the vaginal mycobiota, and its corresponding genomic profile is known as the vaginal mycobiome[ 45 Candida albicans -albicans Candida C. glabrata C. tropicalis C. parapsilosis 46 Recent advancements in high-throughput sequencing have provided deeper insights into the diversity of vaginal fungal communities. A landmark study published in 2013 utilized pyrosequencing to analyze the vaginal mycobiota of asymptomatic women in Estonia, revealing Candida 45 46 C. albicans -albicans Candida C. dubliniensis C. parapsilosis C. krusei Candida 45 While recent studies have revealed a more diverse vaginal mycobiota than previously recognized, C. albicans 45 47 Candida 48 Candida Candida Candida 49 Multiple factors influence Candida Candida 50 51 52 A recent study suggests that when Candida 51 51 Candida 53 54 VMB in recurrent vulvovaginal infections Disruptions in the VMB can lead to dysbiosis, a state where competing microbial communities favor those adapted to less favorable conditions. This process may result in a decrease in beneficial Lactobacillus 55 58 The three most common types of vulvovaginal infections are BV, VVC, and trichomoniasis[ 55 58 59 60 BV-VMB composition BV is a dysbiotic condition characterized by a decrease in lactic acid-producing bacteria and a concomitant increase in anaerobic bacterial diversity. This diverse community includes species from genera such as Anaerococcus Atopobium Bacteroides BVAB1 BVAB2 BVAB3 Gardnerella Leptotrichia Mobiluncus Mycoplasma Peptostreptococcus Peptoniphilus Prevotella Sneathia Advances in molecular techniques have continually expanded the list of potential BV-associated agents, including unculturable microorganisms, a limitation of older culture-based methods[ 61 Olegusella massiliensis Ezakiella massiliensis Corynebacterium fournierii 62 64 65 VVC VVC is a dysbiotic condition characterized by Candida 66 67 68 Similar to BV, VVC pathogenesis involves three primary stages: Adherence to epithelial cells, invasion, and biofilm formation, followed by the secretion of virulence factors. Two key proteins, Als3 and Ssa1, function in the “invasion” process[ 69 70 Studies have shown that environmental factors, such as nutrient depletion, neutral pH, a temperature of 37 °C, and low Candida 7 Candida 71 72 C. albicans 73 Candida The primary treatment for VVC remains antifungal medications, although their effectiveness is increasingly challenged by high recurrence rates and the emergence of drug-resistant Candida 74 74 in vivo 74 GUT MICROBIOTA The gut microbiota exerts diverse effects on the intestinal environment, influencing distant organs and systems, and is now recognized as a functional endocrine organ. It plays a pivotal role in the female endocrine reproductive system across the lifespan, interacting with hormones such as estrogens, androgens, and insulin, among others. Dysbiosis is associated with numerous diseases and conditions, including pregnancy complications, PCOS, endometriosis, and cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying these interactions remain incompletely understood. It is widely recognized that the number of microorganisms in the human body is roughly equivalent to the number of human cells, with the genetic content of these microbes exceeding the human genome by at least 150-fold[ 75 76 77 Estrogen and gut microbiota interaction The relationship between estrogens and the gut microbiota is bidirectional: Estrogens influence the microbiota, and the microbiota actively modulates estrogen levels. Estrogens play a crucial role in regulating gut microbiota composition, with the microbial group capable of metabolizing estrogens often referred to as the “estrobolome”[ 78 79 Gut microbes secrete β-glucuronidase, an enzyme that converts conjugated estrogens into their active deconjugated forms[ 78 78 80 81 Research has demonstrated that specific bacterial orders, such as Lactobacillales Proteobacteria Bacteroidetes Firmicutes 82 83 Recent studies have also highlighted the role of the gut microbiota in mediating the protective effects of 17β-estradiol against metabolic endotoxemia and chronic low-grade inflammation. In experiments, male mice treated with 17β-estradiol and ovariectomized female mice exhibited reduced levels of Proteobacteria 84 85 Estrogens are also associated with several hormone-dependent cancers, including those of the endometrium, cervix, ovary, prostate, and breast. Alterations in gut microbiota composition have been observed in many of these cancers, suggesting a potential role for the microbiota in cancer initiation and progression[ 86 The gut microbiota influences various aspects of female health, including fertility, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. Estrogens not only regulate the gut microbiota but also modulate estrogen metabolism and levels, with significant implications for various pathological conditions. For example, decreased ratios of estrogen metabolites to parent compounds, along with reduced fecal microbiota diversity, have been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women[ 87 In postmenopausal women, increased gut microbiota diversity positively correlates with a higher ratio of estrogen metabolites in urine[ 88 89 91 Furthermore, the gut microbiota can metabolize estrogen-like compounds from foods, such as soy isoflavones, which, in turn, promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria[ 92 Bifidobacterium Clostridiaceae 92 93 Bifidobacterium Clostridiaceae Estrogens and the gut microbiota may work synergistically to shape various aspects of women's health, including fertility, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. A deeper understanding of the interactions between estrogens and the gut microbiota will provide valuable insights, potentially leading to novel strategies for reducing the risk of endocrine diseases in women. INTESTINAL MICROBIOTA, FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT, AND EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT The intestinal microbiota and its metabolites significantly influence various stages of embryonic development, from gamete formation to processes such as fertilization, implantation, placentation, miscarriage, and birth. Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of gut bacteria in the female reproductive system[ 94 96 Lactobacillus crispatus Sneathia amnii 97 via 98 Recent molecular analyses have confirmed that the uterine cavity is not sterile, demonstrating that endometrial communities are derived from specific macroflora, with notable associations to gastrointestinal microbiota, particularly the Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria 99 100 in vitro 101 Lactobacillus 102 For instance, Th1 cells are a significant component of the immune system within the human endometrium, and a balanced Th1/Th2 ratio is essential for proper implantation. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota can provide immune-stimulatory signals that activate both innate and adaptive immune responses. In mice with altered gut microbiota, the differentiation of various T cell subtypes is impaired[ 103 104 Placental integrity and function are crucial for fetal growth and development. One study demonstrated that the placenta harbors a metabolite-rich microbiota, and variations in the placental microbiota have been linked to a history of antenatal infections, potentially influencing intrauterine infections and preterm birth[ 96 Escherichia Escherichia 105 Disruptions in the gut microbiota can also lead to ovarian dysfunction, including impaired oocyte development and abnormal ovulation. Studies in Drosophila Acetobacter 106 107 108 Lactobacillus 109 110 111 The microbiota in follicular fluid has been shown to influence in vitro Lactobacillus spp 112 113 SCFAS AND THE GUT-BRAIN-SEX CONNECTION: A NEUROBIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE The gut-brain axis has emerged as a key regulator of mood and overall well-being, with direct implications for sexual health. The gut microbiota plays a fundamental role in host physiology, influencing neurochemical and endocrine processes that modulate behavior and emotional responses. Dysbiosis can impair this bidirectional communication, contributing to mood disorders and affecting key aspects of sexuality, including motivation and function[ 114 A key element in understanding this relationship lies in the fermentation of indigestible fibers by gut bacteria, which leads to the production of SCFAs such as butyrate, acetate, and propionate (Table 1 115 116 116 Table 1 Short-chain fatty acids: Composition, absorption, and circulatory levels  Short-chain fatty acid  Relative abundance (%)  Fecal concentration (g/kg)  Main absorption route  Plasma concentration (μM)  Biological function Acetate About 60% About 60 g/kg Absorbed via 100-200 Primary energy source for peripheral tissues, precursor for lipogenesis, contributes to appetite regulation and gut-brain communication Propionate About 20% About 10-20 g/kg Mainly used by hepatocytes, with a small fraction entering the circulation 1-15 Plays a crucial role in hepatic gluconeogenesis and cholesterol metabolism, modulates inflammatory pathways Butyrate About 20% About 3.5-32.6 g/kg Primary energy source for colonocytes; also crosses the BBB 1-15 Essential for maintaining gut barrier integrity, possesses anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties MCTs: Monocarboxylate transporters; BBB: Blood-brain barrier. Because SCFAs are primarily synthesized in the colon, their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been a subject of research. Specific transporters in intestinal and endothelial cells facilitate SCFA absorption, allowing these metabolites to reach the brain, where they contribute to BBB integrity, regulate neurotransmitter levels, and influence neuronal activity[ 117 117 The gut microbiota also plays a crucial role in microglial cell homeostasis, which in turn influences synaptic pruning and neuroimmune regulation. Microglia serves as the primary immune cells of the CNS, actively regulating neural connectivity and synaptic function[ 117 118 Bifidobacterium spp. Lactobacillus spp. Escherichia spp. Streptococcus spp. Candida spp. Bacillus spp. 119 via Bifidobacterium infantis 119 119 Inflammation and gut permeability also play significant roles in modulating sexual health. Intestinal inflammation, often associated with dysbiosis, leads to increased production of bacterial endotoxins such as LPSs, which activate immune pathways and contribute to neuroinflammation[ 120 120 Animal models offer compelling support for a link between systemic inflammation and impaired sexual behavior. In rats, neonatal exposure to LPS affects the timing of puberty, disrupts sexual performance in adulthood, and reduces sperm viability. These effects were accompanied by long-lasting alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and hormonal regulation, highlighting how early immune activation can negatively influence reproductive and sexual outcomes later in life[ 121 122 The table below summarizes key mechanisms linking gut microbiota, inflammation, and sexual health (Table 2 123 123 1 Figure 1  Short-chain fatty acids and the gut-brain-sex connection. Table 2 Impact of gut microbiota on inflammation and sexual health  Microbiota factor  Effect on inflammation  Pathways and mechanisms  Impact on sexual health SCFA production Reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) and enhances anti-inflammatory responses (IL-10) Activates GPCRs, inhibits NF-κB signaling, enhances Treg activity Modulates neurotransmitter levels, improving libido and mood stability Gut barrier integrity Strengthens intestinal epithelium, reducing systemic endotoxin levels Increases tight junction proteins (occludin, claudin), reduces LPS translocation Prevents inflammatory-induced sexual dysfunction ( e.g. Dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) Promotes endotoxemia, activates TLR4 signaling, increases systemic inflammation Activates TLR4, increases pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), disrupts HPA axis function Neuroinflammation disrupts dopamine and serotonin homeostasis, potentially reducing libido and motivation; Contributes to decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and hormonal imbalances Neurotransmitter synthesis Modulates 5-HT, DA, NE, Ach and GABA production, impacting brain function Regulates tryptophan metabolism, modulates serotonin biosynthesis via Reduced serotonin synthesis may lead to mood instability and decreased sexual interest; Altered neurotransmitter release may impair arousal, orgasm, and emotional connection; Influences arousal, mood, and stress-related sexual disorders SCFA: Short-chain fatty acid; IL: Interleukine; TNF-α: Tumor necrosis factor α; GPCRs: G-protein coupled receptors; NF-κB: Nuclear factor kappa B; TLR4: Toll-like receptor 4; HPA: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal; 5-HT: Serotonine; DA: Dopamine; NE: Norepinephrine; Ach: Acetylcholine; NO: Nitric oxide; PGs: Prostaglandins; LPS: Lipopolysaccharide; Treg: Regulatory T cell; GABA: Gamma-aminobutyric acid. PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN GUT MICROBIOTA AND SEXUAL WELL-BEING Through the gut-brain axis, the gut microbiota can regulate sex hormone production and metabolism, such as testosterone and estrogen, which are essential for healthy sexual function. Dysbiosis can disrupt the production of essential microbial metabolites, including SCFAs, that support hormonal regulation and vascular health[ 124 125 2 Figure 2  Psychological factors in the relationship between gut microbiota and sexual health. SPA is one of the most common sexual disorders. It manifests as a form of anxiety that occurs during or before sexual activity. People who suffer from it may have concerns about their performance, partner satisfaction, erection, or orgasm. This condition can affect both men and women, negatively impacting sexual and relational quality of life. The primary causes include high expectations, where the pressure to satisfy one’s partner or meet idealized standards of sexual performance plays a significant role. Negative past experiences, including previous sexual difficulties, may trigger a cycle of fear and anxiety. Psychological and physical stress, along with fatigue, can exacerbate anxiety-related symptoms. Body image concerns, particularly low self-esteem and dissatisfaction with one’s appearance, often heighten insecurities. Relationship difficulties, whether due to emotional conflicts or communication barriers, can further contribute to performance anxiety. Additionally, misinformation and unrealistic beliefs about sexuality and performance may intensify psychological distress[ 126 127 In men, common manifestations include difficulty achieving or maintaining an erection (ED), premature ejaculation, or delayed ejaculation. In women, the condition often presents as a lack of sexual desire, difficulty with arousal, or pain during intercourse, like dyspareunia[ 128 These concerns can trigger the release of stress hormones, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, which constrict blood vessels. This mechanism can compromise sexual health, creating a vicious cycle of anxiety and stress, which fuels and maintains sexual dysfunction[ 129 130 Reduced diversity of the gut microbiota, as identified through gene sequencing studies in ED patients, correlates with modifications in sex hormone levels and overall sexual health[ 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 The bidirectional interaction between the gut, microbiota, and brain further underscores the importance of this system in sexual well-being. Psychological stress significantly impacts the gut microbiota, reducing microbial diversity and promoting dysbiosis, which directly affects sexual health[ 141 142 143 144 145 Dysbiosis triggers a cascade of physiological and psychological disruptions, including immune activation and inflammation that contribute to systemic dysfunction and impaired sexual health; disrupted neurotransmitter regulation, particularly serotonin, which influences mood, behavior, and sexual desire; enhanced stress reactivity, increasing vulnerability to SPA and other mental health challenges[ 146 147 148 Sexual dysfunction, such as low sexual desire, premature ejaculation and ED are frequently associated with affective disorders[ 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 157 Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is a significant but often overlooked aspect of this interplay. In women, depression predominantly affects desire and arousal, leading to difficulties in achieving orgasm or experiencing pleasure. The psychological burden of female sexual dysfunction, combined with societal stigmas, often discourages women from seeking help, perpetuating cycles of distress and dissatisfaction in intimate relationships[ 158 159 Gut health significantly influences not only physical aspects, but also self-perception, impacting confidence and sexual relationships. This connection becomes especially pronounced in the context of eating disorders, where disruptions in the gut microbiota, psychological distress, and sexual dysfunction create a complex and multifaceted challenge. Anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and obesity exemplify how these interactions manifest through different mechanisms[ 160 161 162 163 164 BN, characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting or laxative use, causes profound gastrointestinal and hormonal imbalances[ 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 The role of gut microbiota in regulating sexual health is increasingly recognized as a key factor in these conditions. Alterations in gut microbiota composition, commonly found in individuals with eating disorders, influence neurotransmitter production, such as serotonin and dopamine, which are crucial for mood regulation, sexual desire, and pleasure perception[ 176 177 178 180 181 182 GUT MICROBIOTA, DIET, AND MENTAL HEALTH: IMPLICATIONS FOR SYSTEMIC AND SEXUAL WELL-BEING Maintaining homeostasis in the human gut microbiota is vital for overall health[ 183 184 185 186 Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics have been clearly defined in scientific literature. Probiotics are “live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host”[ 187 188 189 Recent studies indicate that supplementation with specific probiotic strains, particularly Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium 190 192 9 193 194 195 196 197 via In addition to a balanced diet, probiotic supplementation is crucial for maintaining gut microbiota health and represents a promising, non-invasive therapeutic strategy for managing mood disorders and sexual dysfunctions. Probiotics hold significant potential as interventions for these conditions by modulating the gut-brain axis, reducing oxidative stress, and alleviating systemic inflammation. However, further research is needed to identify the most effective probiotic strains and establish optimal dosages for achieving clinically meaningful outcomes. Complementing probiotic use, a balanced diet plays a crucial role in maintaining a healthy gut microbiota, a well-documented relationship[ 198 199 et al 200 Faecalibacterium High fiber diets, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, particularly SCFA-producing species such as Bifidobacterium Faecalibacterium et al 201 202 203 These effects also have important implications for sexual health. SCFAs produced by dietary fiber fermentation improve endothelial function and lower systemic inflammation, two factors that are essential for healthy sexual function[ 7 204 205 206 Moreover, fiber-rich diets sustain SCFA production, reinforcing their wide-ranging benefits for gut, systemic, and sexual health. Conversely, low-fiber diets characteristic of Westernized lifestyles are strongly associated with decreased SCFA levels[ 207 208 209 INTEGRATING PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES AND PSYCHOBIOTICS: A NOVEL APPROACH TO GUT-BRAIN AND SEXUAL HEALTH The integration of psychobiotics represents an innovative and multidisciplinary approach to addressing sexual dysfunctions by modulating stress, anxiety, and overall mental well-being, all of which are closely linked to sexual function. Psychobiotics are a specialized class of probiotics defined as bacteria that confer mental health benefits by influencing the gut-brain axis[ 210 211 212 213 215 Notable strains, such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus Bifidobacterium longum 216 218 These effects may positively impact sexual function by improving desire, arousal, and satisfaction, primarily through stress reduction and increased mental energy. In neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, psychobiotics contribute to cognitive preservation, oxidative stress reduction, and neuroprotection by modulating gut microbiota composition and inflammation[ 219 Psychological therapies targeting the gut-brain axis, including gastrointestinal-specific cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), gut-focused hypnosis, and mindfulness-based approaches, have proven effective in managing disorders associated with gut-brain dysregulation[ 220 221 222 This integrated approach holds promise in various clinical contexts, particularly in treating psychogenic sexual dysfunction, such as performance anxiety and low sexual desire driven by psychological stress. By addressing both the psychological and microbiotic contributors to these conditions, the combined use of psychobiotics with therapies like CBT and mindfulness may enhance sexual responsiveness and overall satisfaction. This convergence of psychological interventions and psychobiotics represents a promising frontier in clinical research, integrating insights from neuroscience, psychiatry, and microbiology to develop more effective treatments for complex disorders. In the future, comprehensive therapeutic strategies that combine probiotics, dietary modifications, and psychological interventions may become a standard approach to managing sexual dysfunction associated with gut dysbiosis. Advances in microbiota research have enabled mapping of this intricate microbial community, revealing that each individual has a unique “microbial fingerprint” shaped by genetics and environmental interactions. These discoveries have paved the way for innovative therapeutic strategies, including tailored probiotics and prebiotics to support specific beneficial bacterial strains, personalized dietary interventions aimed at optimizing microbiota composition and reducing inflammation, microbiota-targeted pharmaceuticals designed to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects, and fecal microbiota transplantation, an emerging and effective treatment for dysbiosis-related diseases[ 223 CONCLUSION Gut microbiota plays a central role in the complex interplay between sexual health and mental well-being. Acting through the gut-brain axis, it influences key neurobiological processes such as neurotransmitter production, stress regulation, hormonal balance, and emotional resilience - all of which are critical for healthy sexual functioning. Dysbiosis has been linked to physiological conditions like ED and hormonal imbalances, but also to psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and SPA. Psychobiotics and microbiota-targeted therapies, especially when integrated with psychological interventions, offer promising avenues for addressing both the mental and physical dimensions of sexual dysfunction. A better understanding of the microbiota’s influence on neuropsychiatric and sexual health may lead to more personalized, effective, and holistic therapeutic strategies. Future research should continue to explore these connections, with the aim of advancing integrated care models that bridge psychiatry, sexual medicine, and microbiome science.
