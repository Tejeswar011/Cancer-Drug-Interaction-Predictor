Understanding the epidemiology of thyroid cancer and the future burden on public health systems is necessary. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, incidence, and mortality of thyroid cancer by age, sex, country in Asia in 2020 and its projection up to 2040. Methods The Global Cancer Observatory provided data on thyroid cancer incidence and mortality for the year 2020. By taking into account the sex, age group, and Asia region, the counts, rates, and mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs) were calculated. To estimate the projected number of new cancer cases or mortalities between 2025 and 2040 in a particular nation, the corresponding expected population for the years 2025 to 2040 was multiplied by the age-specific incidence or mortality rates calculated for 2020. Results In 2020, the 5-year prevalence rate, age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) for thyroid cancer were 24.60, 6.40, and 0.44 per 100,000 population in Asia, respectively. By country, the highest thyroid cancer 5-year prevalence rates and ASIRs were found in the Republic of Korea. The highest thyroid cancer ASMRs among both sexes combined were in the United Arab Emirates and Syrian Arab Republic. The highest incidence and mortality crude rates were in the 50–59 and 70 + age groups, respectively. Women had higher incidence and mortality rates than men. There were significant correlations between human development index and MIR and ASIR ( p Conclusions Asia is experiencing rising rates of thyroid cancer incidence and mortality. It is imperative to prioritize strategies aimed at high-incidence regions, transitioning countries with limited resources, and younger adult populations to alleviate the global burden of thyroid cancer and resolve disparities in cancer management.

HDI data were obtained from the United Nations Development Programme's Human Development Report Office [ 21 22 23 24 Study variables Study variables encompassed two key measures of thyroid cancer: incidence and mortality, which were further refined by calculating their respective crude rates and subsequent MIRs. MIRs serve as indicators of healthcare quality, with lower values indicative of superior cancer care encompassing screening, therapy, and overall disease management [ 25 22 21 Statistical analysis We presented comprehensive tables and figures illustrating various metrics including the number of new cases and mortalities, 5-year prevalent cases, crude incidence and mortality rates, 5-year prevalence rate, age-standardized incidence (ASIR), and age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), all standardized per 100000 population. To ensure accurate comparisons across populations with differing age distributions, we employed the direct standardization method using the Segi-Doll World standard population from 1966. Furthermore, we explored the relationship between thyroid cancer incidence and mortality rates, along with the estimated MIR, in relation to the HDI and CHE/GDP% for countries with available data. This analysis was conducted using bivariate correlation tests, with results reported using Pearson's correlation coefficient categorized into strong (> 0.5), moderate (0.5–0.3), and weak (< 0.3) ranges based on its absolute value. Statistical significance was determined by a p-value of less than 0.05 from a two-sided test. Additionally, we projected the number of new cancer cases or mortalities between 2025 and 2040 by extrapolating age-specific incidence or mortality rates calculated for 2020 and applying them to the corresponding expected population for the years 2025 to 2040. Population estimates were sourced from the United Nations, World Population Prospects, 2019 revision ( https://population.un.org/wpp/ 26 Results Prevalence, incidence, and mortality at the global, regional, and national levels Globally, the 5-year prevalent cases of thyroid cancer in 2020 were 1984927, corresponding to a 5-year prevalence rate of 25.50. There were a total of 586202 new cases of thyroid cancer in the world, presenting a crude rate of 7.50 per 100000 population, an ASIR of 6.60, and an all-age cumulative risk of 0.87% among both sexes. Moreover, thyroid cancer led to 43646 mortalities with a crude rate of 0.56, an ASMR of 0.43, and a cumulative risk of 0.14%. Continents with the highest ASIRs for thyroid cancer were Northern America (12.40) and Oceania (9.70), whereas Africa (2.00) was the continent with the lowest ASIR. In contrast, Northern America (0.30) and Europe (0.33) had the lowest ASMRs, while Africa (0.62) accounted for the highest ASMR among continents (Table 1 Table 1 Thyroid cancer five-year prevalence, incidence, and mortality metrics, as well as mortality-to-incidence ratio in 2020 for different geographic location in both sexes, males, and females Location Prevalence Incidence Mortality MIR 5-year prevalent cases 5-year prevalence rate Number Crude rate ASR Cumulative risk (%) Number Crude rate ASR Cumulative risk (%) Both sexes World 1984927 25.5 586202 7.5 6.6 0.87 43646 0.56 0.43 0.14 0.07 Asia 1139172 24.6 349897 7.5 6.4 0.83 25668 0.55 0.44 0.15 0.07 Eastern Asia 868943 51.8 260692 15.5 11.5 1.31 12023 0.72 0.4 0.14 0.05 South-Central Asia 90892 4.5 32548 1.6 1.6 0.26 6983 0.35 0.38 0.11 0.22 South-Eastern Asia 97851 14.6 32629 4.9 4.4 0.74 4578 0.68 0.63 0.25 0.14 Western Asia 81486 29.3 24028 8.6 8.6 1.1 2084 0.75 0.83 0.27 0.09 Continents Africa 47595 3.6 18457 1.4 2 0.35 4443 0.33 0.62 0.22 0.24 Europe 325708 43.5 87162 11.6 8.3 0.99 6399 0.85 0.33 0.11 0.07 Latin America and the Caribbean 209541 32 63368 9.7 8.6 1.07 4406 0.67 0.53 0.17 0.07 Northern America 243888 66.1 62256 16.9 12.4 1.58 2420 0.66 0.3 0.1 0.04 Oceania 19023 44.6 5062 11.9 9.7 1.29 310 0.73 0.45 0.13 0.06 Males World 438719 11.2 137287 3.5 3.1 0.46 15906 0.4 0.35 0.11 0.11 Asia 259942 11 84355 3.6 3.1 0.44 9737 0.41 0.36 0.11 0.11 Eastern Asia 196578 23 61997 7.2 5.4 0.66 4210 0.49 0.3 0.1 0.07 South-Central Asia 22976 2.2 8851 0.85 0.89 0.16 3361 0.32 0.37 0.11 0.38 South-Eastern Asia 23356 7 8203 2.5 2.4 0.41 1482 0.44 0.47 0.18 0.18 Western Asia 17032 11.7 5304 3.6 3.8 0.57 684 0.47 0.59 0.19 0.13 Continents Africa 9039 1.3 3839 0.57 0.94 0.18 1106 0.17 0.34 0.12 0.3 Europe 67958 18.8 19345 5.3 3.7 0.49 2359 0.65 0.31 0.09 0.12 Latin America and the Caribbean 36601 11.4 11866 3.7 3.4 0.47 1445 0.45 0.39 0.12 0.12 Northern America 60417 33.1 16560 9.1 6.3 0.94 1150 0.63 0.32 0.1 0.07 Oceania 4762 22.3 1322 6.2 4.9 0.78 109 0.51 0.32 0.1 0.08 Females World 1546208 40 448915 11.6 10.1 1.25 27740 0.72 0.5 0.17 0.06 Asia 879230 38.8 265542 11.7 9.9 1.21 15931 0.7 0.52 0.18 0.06 Eastern Asia 672365 81.7 198695 24.2 17.8 1.94 7813 0.95 0.48 0.17 0.04 South-Central Asia 67916 7 23697 2.4 2.4 0.35 3622 0.37 0.38 0.11 0.15 South-Eastern Asia 74495 22.3 24426 7.3 6.4 1 3096 0.93 0.76 0.3 0.13 Western Asia 64454 48.6 18724 14.1 14 1.66 1400 1.1 1.1 0.33 0.08 Continents Africa 38556 5.7 14618 2.2 3.1 0.49 3337 0.5 0.85 0.29 0.23 Europe 257750 66.6 67817 17.5 12.8 1.44 4040 1 0.35 0.12 0.06 Latin America and the Caribbean 172940 52 51502 15.5 13.4 1.61 2961 0.89 0.63 0.21 0.06 Northern America 183471 98.5 45696 24.5 18.4 2.19 1270 0.68 0.28 0.1 0.03 Oceania 14261 66.9 3740 17.5 14.5 1.79 201 0.94 0.57 0.15 0.05 Abbreviations ASR MIR In Asia, the 5-year prevalent cases of thyroid cancer reported for 2020 were 1139172, ranking it the highest among all continents.

In 2020, thyroid cancer caused 25668 mortalities in Asia, with a crude rate of 0.55, an ASMR of 0.44, and a cumulative risk of 0.15%. In 2020, among the four Asian regions for both sexes, Eastern Asia had the highest 5-year prevalence rate (51.80), while South-Central Asia had the lowest one (4.50). Similarly, Eastern Asia and South-Central Asia with ASIRs of 11.50 and 1.60 had the highest and lowest ASIRs, respectively. In terms of ASMRs, Western Asia had the highest value (0.83), while South-Central Asia had the lowest one (0.38) (Table 1 Among all the Asian countries, the highest thyroid cancer 5-year prevalence rates were found for the Republic of Korea (120.10), Israel (62.00), and Turkey (56.80).

Thyroid cancer incidence showed considerable variation across Asia. Elevated incidence rates were observed in several regions, while mortality rates remained low almost everywhere. Incidence rates among females consistently surpassed those of males, although the difference in mortality rates between sexes was much smaller. The study identified the 50–59 year age group as having the highest crude incidence rates of thyroid cancer, whereas the highest mortality rates occurred in those aged 70 and above for both sexes. Significant correlations were also noted between the HDI and both ASIR and the MIR. GLOBOCAN 2020 projected a 26.6% increase in newly diagnosed thyroid cancer cases and a 77.8% rise in mortalities in Asia by 2040. Prevalence and Incidence trends, mortality and survival patterns Over the previous 50 years, the incidence of thyroid cancer has grown considerably worldwide. Despite this, the mortality rates continued to be relatively low [ 27 3 Thyroid cancer is the most frequent endocrine malignancy [ 28 29 30 Some studies have suggested that improved accessibility to healthcare facilities, along with advancements in diagnostic technology, may explain the increase in diagnosed cases and incidence rates of thyroid cancer without affecting mortality rates. This aligns with prior research highlighting the association between rising thyroid cancer incidence and the expanding use of advanced diagnostic imaging. These modalities include ultrasonography, the preferred imaging technique for the thyroid gland, along with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [ 27 31 32 29 33 Earlier research has shown a significant pool of undetected, small thyroid cancers, particularly the papillary type, found in autopsy studies (ranging from 5 to 36% in both sexes) [ 34 27 35 36 The impact of income and sex on the stage of thyroid cancer at which the disease is diagnosed, alongside the positive correlations between thyroid cancer incidence and social and economic indicators such as household income, education, and health insurance, are in line with the hypothesis that the upward trajectory in thyroid cancer incidence is associated with enhanced healthcare accessibility and the adoption of advanced diagnostic methods [ 33 37 39 The precise extent to which the disparity between rising thyroid cancer incidence and stable mortality rates can be attributed to overdiagnosis remains uncertain. Prior studies have attempted to quantify this association. In certain regions, including the Republic of Korea, Belarus, China, Italy, Croatia, Slovakia, and France, estimates suggest that overdiagnosis among women may account for as high as 80% to 95% of newly diagnosed cases between 2008 and 2012. Other areas, such as Denmark, Norway, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and Japan, have reported figures ranging from 50 to 70%. It is noteworthy that a similar trend, albeit to a lesser degree, has been observed in men [ 40 41 Morris et al. [ 35 32 32 BRAF RAS 42 Another risk factor to consider is the modern lifestyle. A shift away from traditional diets towards a Western-style diet high in saturated fats and added sugars could be contributing to this trend. Obesity and adiposity, which are often linked to such dietary changes, appear to play a role in comparatively high incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancer [ 43 44 33 To reduce the rising incidence and prevent unnecessary interventions, several measures are recommended: 1) Adopting risk‐stratified screening guidelines that limit the use of cervical ultrasound to individuals with clinical suspicion (e.g., palpable nodules, family history or radiation exposure); 2) Educating healthcare providers on the natural history of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma and on criteria for active surveillance versus immediate intervention; 3) Launching public awareness campaigns to inform asymptomatic individuals about the potential harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and 4) Strengthening registry data quality and integrating tumor‐size reporting to monitor the burden of microcarcinomas over time. These measures might be useful for balancing early detection of clinically significant disease with the reduction of overdiagnosis and its sequelae. Regional disparities The incidence of thyroid cancer exhibits striking variations across Asia, with remarkable differences between and within countries [ 45 46 33 40 An increasing recognition of the significant implications of overdiagnosis and the slow-growing nature of small thyroid cancers has prompted revisions to international clinical practice guidelines. These revisions discourage routine screening for thyroid cancer and instead advocate for active surveillance of microcarcinoma. The worldwide impact of these guideline changes remains to be fully understood. However, the substantial decrease in thyroid cancer incidence rates observed in South Korea since 2010 and in the United States since 2015 suggests that the growing acceptance of guidelines and an active surveillance strategy may already be alleviating some of the adverse effects associated with overdiagnosis [ 3 As previously discussed, the incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancer exhibit marked disparities across the globe and especially in Asia, with East Asia being a particularly heterogeneous region. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, including demographic shifts, variations in healthcare systems across Asia, the influence of mass media, and economic disparities between countries [ 32 47 Age and sex patterns Regarding sex disparities, the incidence rate among females consistently exceeded that of males across various regions, with this disparity being particularly pronounced within the age groups of 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years old, where the difference can reach up to 17 cases per 100000 people. While rising trends in incidence rates were observed for both sexes, overdiagnosis appears to be more prevalent among women compared to men. Interestingly, the difference between men and women is much smaller in mortality rates [ 39 This sex disparity may be partially explained by women's greater demand for healthcare compared to men. Factors such as contraception, pregnancy, and perimenopausal circumstances often lead women to undergo more frequent checkups throughout their lives, providing additional opportunities for the thyroid gland to be examined closely [ 38 40 45 48 Our study identified the 50–59 year age group as having the highest crude incidence rates of thyroid cancer across both sexes. This finding aligns with established knowledge that the risk of developing cancer generally increases with advancing age. This age-related rise is likely due to the cumulative effect of risk factors and environmental exposures over time. Furthermore, the trend of global population aging is expected to exacerbate this phenomenon [ 45 Correlations with the socioeconomic status Evidence suggests significant disparities in both the incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancer across countries with varying HDI levels. This study investigated the potential role of national development and healthcare expenditure in influencing these disparities, specifically focusing on MIR as an indicator of healthcare and cancer management quality. We hypothesized that more developed regions with higher healthcare spending may have the capacity to deliver more effective thyroid cancer treatment, potentially leading to improved patients’ outcomes and lower MIRs. The widespread implementation of thyroid cancer screening programs, particularly in developed countries with robust healthcare systems and high healthcare spending, has been Linked to an increased detection of early-stage cancers. As evidenced by data from GLOBOCAN 2020, this trend is exemplified by regions like North America, where a high incidence rate coexists with a lower mortality rate. Conversely, regions like Africa and Western Asia, despite exhibiting the highest ASMRs from thyroid cancer, do not report comparably high ASIRs. In this regard, Northern America has the lowest MIR, and Africa has the highest. These findings suggest that screening programs, while potentially leading to a rise in incidence rates, may also contribute to improved prognoses and lower mortality rates when coupled with appropriate healthcare infrastructure and treatment modalities. Azadnajafabad and colleagues introduced a novel quality of care index for thyroid cancer to assess cancer care quality across different populations. They found that regions with higher socio-demographic development had better quality of care index scores. Besides that, regions with a high socio-demographic index exhibited the highest incidence rates per 100000 population across all age groups, while low socio-demographic index regions had the lowest incidence rates. Conversely, the mortality rates were highest in low socio-demographic index regions and lowest in high and high-middle socio-demographic index regions. The lower mortality rates in higher socio-demographic index regions were attributed to early detection, better healthcare access, and effective treatment [ 49 33 3 A recent study by Xu et al. [ 45 Challenges and future directions Our study suggests that the burden of thyroid cancer in Asia is predicted to increase substantially. Annual decreases in incidence and mortality rates exceeding 1.1% and 2.8%, respectively, are necessary to mitigate the future burden of this disease. Considering the projected rise in thyroid cancer incidence, several key areas merit future investigation. These include: 1) refining methods for monitoring disease incidence and analyzing trends; 2) enhancing our understanding of the disease through ongoing research; 3) developing strategies for early and accurate identification of patients amenable to effective treatments; 4) optimizing therapeutic approaches; and 5) implementing targeted prevention plans. Additionally, it is crucial to establish cancer screening protocols that balance the benefits of early detection with the potential harms of overdiagnosis and unnecessary interventions. Patients continue to undergo aggressive treatments, subjecting them to potential side effects without guaranteed benefits. The detection of small thyroid cancers and the phenomenon of overdiagnosis can lead to healthy individuals being labeled as patients, thereby exposing them to unnecessary therapeutic interventions such as total thyroidectomy, radiotherapy, or neck lymph node dissection [ 31 40 Moreover, a significant proportion of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer, exceeding 90% according to some estimates [ 46 50 33 40 45 A strategy to reduce the global and regional disparities in thyroid cancer incidence and mortality rates would be to employ cost-effective interventions tailored to the context of each country. Policymakers should provide particular local solutions to each nation's unique risk factors [ 45 51 Strengths and limitations Our study's strengths include investigations of epidemiological estimates of thyroid cancer in relation to HDI and CHE/GDP. These findings help identify and map existing disparities in thyroid cancer care, providing valuable insights into the impact of socioeconomic factors and healthcare financing on disease outcomes. On the other hand, there are several Limitations that should be acknowledged. The accuracy and reliability of national cancer estimates hinge upon the quality of the data sources. According to the GLOBOCAN methodology, the Limitation that requires acknowledgment is the quality, availability, and coverage of cancer data worldwide, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, careful interpretation of these estimates is crucial. The estimates presented in this study do not consider the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. Multiple reports have highlighted disruptions in routine medical appointments, cancer screenings, diagnostic biopsies, surgical procedures, and follow-up care for patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic [ 52 53 Conclusions We demonstrated that there are notable sex and age disparities among Asian regions and that incidence rates are directly correlated with countries’ development status. Projections indicate a rising burden by 2040 in Asia. The increasing rates observed in transitioning countries and among younger adults are particularly noteworthy. These findings emphasize the urgent need for proactive measures to mitigate future cases and mortalities associated with thyroid cancer.
