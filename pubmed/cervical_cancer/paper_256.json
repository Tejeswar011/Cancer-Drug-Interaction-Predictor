Methods: We investigated sexual orientation-related disparities in SCD in Nurses’ Health Study II ( N n n n n n Results: Relative to completely heterosexual participants, SM participants had 29% more SCD symptoms (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26–1.32). Symptoms were elevated in every SM subgroup; the largest disparities were among bisexual and mostly heterosexual subgroups (adjusted risk ratios for 1-unit increment in symptoms [aRR]: 1.60, 95% CI = 1.45–1.77; 1.48, 95% CI = 1.42–1.54, respectively) followed by lesbian/gay (aRR: 1.22, 95% CI = 1.14–1.31) and heterosexual-SM participants (aRR: 1.21, 95% CI = 1.18–1.25). Conclusion: SM women—particularly bisexual and mostly heterosexual women—had more symptoms of SCD than completely heterosexual women. These findings align with known sexual orientation-related disparities in dementia risk factors (e.g., mental health, substance use), and indicate that better understanding and closer monitoring of cognitive health in SM groups remains important for prevention efforts as an increasing proportion of aging Americans identifies as SM. aging cognition disparities sexual minority women pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
