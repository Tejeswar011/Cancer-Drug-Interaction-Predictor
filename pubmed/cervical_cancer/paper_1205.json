Absorbing the active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) into the pores can be beneficial in several ways. The narrow pores may stabilize the APIs in an amorphous state, thereby improving its aqueous solubility and providing protection for the encapsulated drug against various factors in the human body, including enzymatic or chemical degradation, which enhances the bioavailability of the product. Beside the overview of their main characteristics, the present review focuses on the recent findings on MSNs form therapeutic and drug formulation perspective, including functionalization possibilities, as the size and surface of the particles influence the interactions with the cell membrane; therefore, the epithelial permeability of and release rate from the carrier, and may offer even targeted delivery in an organ-, tissue- or cell-specific manner, improving the therapy, also avoiding drug-related side effects. mesoporous silica nanoparticles drug delivery toxicity functionalization stimuli-responsive Ministry of Culture and Innovation of Hungary TKP2021-EGA-32 Project No. TKP2021-EGA-32 was implemented with support provided by the Ministry of Culture and Innovation of Hungary through the National Research, Development, and Innovation Fund, financed under the TKP2021-EGA funding scheme. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Nanocarriers can be divided into two main groups: organic and inorganic types. The organic group includes lipid nanocarriers, liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, etc. In the case of the carriers in this group, the limited amount of delivered active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is a clear disadvantage, in addition to reduced stability, and great sensitivity to temperature, pH, and enzymes in a physiological environment. The inorganic group includes metal oxide-, carbon-, silicon-, silica-, and quantum dot-based nanocarriers. Their advantages are greater stability and well-tunable physicochemical properties, but their accumulation in the body may be a crucial question of their applicability. Silica nanoparticles (SNP) are silicon dioxide (SiO 2 1 MSNs are SiO 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 5 2 3 4 8 9 10 8 4 2 3 2 3 4 8 9 10 3 8 4 4 4 10 2 4 8 9 10 4 8 2 4 8 2 4 9 4 8 11 2. Effect of the Physicochemical Properties The physicochemical characteristics of SNPs have a significant impact on pharmacokinetics, thus influencing distribution, accumulation in various cells, degradation, and elimination from the body [ 1 10 10 1 12 10 12 1 10 Table 1 2.1. Particle Size The size of the particles greatly affects the interaction with epithelial cells, cellular absorption, and thus their effectiveness [ 1 10 12 12 1 12 13 24 24 12 13 12 1 12 12 1 12 13 1 12 1 12 12 2.2. Particle Morphology Silica nanoparticles can be produced and used in various shapes (sphere, cube, ellipsoid, rod). The shape of the particles can be characterized by the aspect ratio, which is 1 for spherical particles, but can reach 4 in the case of elongated rod-shaped ones [ 1 10 19 25 1 19 19 10 1 19 19 25 25 2.3. Pore Size and Pore Structure The carriers can have ordered and disordered pore structures [ 1 2 3 1 1 1 3 14 15 16 26 15 16 26 14 17 2.4. Surface Chemistry By connecting different functional groups, smaller or larger changes can be observed in the surface charge (zeta potential values) and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of SNPs [ 14 18 2 3 3 14 18 2 18 27 2 27 2 12 18 27 28 2 27 12 18 18 28 2 18 28 13 14 13 13 3. Toxicity Although MSNs can generally be recognized as safe products, their use during therapy may cause side effects in the body [ 1 2 29 1 4 27 4 8 2 4 8 2 4 27 2 4 8 30 1 1 31 18 31 23 32 18 18 33 31 23 23 32 34 35 34 35 4. Drug Loading Filling the pores with an API can be solved in several ways, which can be classified into two main groups: organic solvent-free and organic solvent-based methods [ 36 37 11 38 39 40 41 (1) E n t r a p m e n t  e f f i c i a n c y  % = E n t r a p p e d  d r u g T o t a l  d r u g  a d d e d × 100  (2) D r u g  l o a d i n g  % = W e i g h t  o f  d r u g  l o a d e d  i n  M S N T o t a l  w e i g h t  o f  l o a d e d  M S N  × 100 Loading the drug into mesoporous carriers can be beneficial since aqueous solubility may increase and a more favorable dissolution profile can be achieved during application, resulting in higher oral bioavailability [ 36 42 3 20 43 20 3 36 3 Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) are a versatile platform for the improvement of water solubility and bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs through the stabilization of the API in the amorphous state. Two outstanding mechanisms facilitate such stabilization: physical entrapment within nanoscale pores with a diameter less than the size of the critical nucleus. In this case, the ordered molecular packing necessary to develop crystals cannot advance. Furthermore, the unique interactions between the functional groups of APIs and the surface silanol groups of MSNs may immobilize drug molecules at or close to pore walls [ 44 45 46 47 45 47 Physical and polymorphic stability also depend on the way of loading. Prednisolone underwent a polymorphic transformation from form I to form II within pores when it was loaded into MSNs with the solvent-evaporation method, whereas melt-loading retained the original polymorph. This means that contacts between the solvent, API, and silica, and the presence of residual solvent can template some polymorphic structures. Furthermore, confinement within thin channels stabilizes metastable polymorphs that would otherwise very quickly convert into the thermodynamically stable polymorph in the bulk. This offers an opportunity to selectively stabilize desired polymorphs by pore size [ 48 49 To combat degradation and recrystallization, strategies such as surface functionalization with hydrophobic silanes, pore filling with polymeric co-formers, and selection of solvent-free loading methods (e.g., co-milling or melting) have been demonstrated to counteract water adsorption, increase drug-matrix interactions, and avoid solvent-templated polymorph formation. Tuning of pore size, surface chemistry, and loading processes allows MSNs to enable better long-term amorphous API stability and regulated polymorphism, thereby facilitating enhanced performance of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems. Several recent research works can support the previous finding and show that APIs in MSNs maintain their chemical structure, unaffected by covalent bonding during adsorption, storage, or release. Porras et al. observed consistent FTIR peaks for drug-MSN systems (albendazole loaded into SBA-15), confirming the preservation of functional groups [ 50 51 51 52 52 53 54 55 55 4.1. Solvent-Free Methods In the case of solvent-free processes, the main advantage is that it is not necessary to remove the solvent residue from the system at the end of the process, and the concentration of the API can also be controlled [ 36 37 37 37 56 36 37 56 36 37 36 37 20 2 36 4.2. Solvent-Based Methods Despite the advantages of solvent-free processes, solvent-based methods offer a more widespread alternative for filling the pores of the carriers. Each method listed here consists of two steps. First, mixing the drug solution and carrier, then removing the solvent [ 36 20 36 37 56 37 56 2 37 2 36 37 Figure 1 37 2 36 37 20 37 36 37 2 2 36 37 5. Drug Release It is necessary to understand the drug release mechanisms in porous media. Three categories can be distinguished based on the driving forces that create mass transport: advection, diffusion, and electrophoresis [ 3 3 3 2 57 3 According to some articles, the API is released from the pores according to first-order kinetics [ 2 57 16 58 21 22 Mathematical modeling, especially the application of the Fick diffusion equation, is very helpful in describing and predicting drug release from polymeric or porous matrices. Fick’s laws describe diffusion as the movement of molecules from a highly concentrated region to a region where the concentration is lower. Fick’s first law presumes the diffusion flux to be directly proportional to the concentration gradient. Fick’s second law controls the spatial and temporal change in concentration in the release medium [ 59 (3) M t M 0  =  4  D t π h 2 1 2  M t t M 0 D h This equation fits particularly well for premature release, up to 60% of the drug released, when there is no change in the matrix system during the release process. From a perspective of pore geometry, it essentially controls drug release rates by affecting effective diffusion pathways. Increased complexity of geometries increases tortuosity and reduces effective diffusion. High tortuosity and low pore connectivity reduce drug diffusion, consequently lowering the release rates. Additionally, surface roughness and pore size distribution affect surface area, diffusion, and residence times, and thereby drug release kinetics. Therefore, coupling the Fick diffusion model with parameters characterizing pore geometry (e.g., porosity, tortuosity, etc.) allows for more precise and automatic modeling of drug release kinetics. In this way, it is nicely explained why release profiles differ for chemically similar matrices due to differences in their geometrical shapes [ 59 60 This supports that the release rate depends on several factors, among others, influenced by the pore size, the pore structure, the amount of drug loaded, the solubility of the API, and the resulting interaction between the carrier and the transported molecules [ 2 Table 2 6. Drug Administration The present chapter discusses the most important findings in recent years regarding the utilization of different drug administration routes and methods. 6.1. Targeted Therapy Targeted therapy, aiming, for example, at antitumor treatments, can be divided into active and passive forms [ 72 73 73 74 25 10 27 72 74 72 74 25 10 27 72 10 27 Table 3 72 72 75 Magnetic particles were synthesized with an iron-containing coating. The model drugs were safranin O and hydrocortisone. The particles were functionalized with a bulky azo derivative to act as a gatekeeper and prevent early leakage of the drug. In vitro release models have demonstrated that most of the drug is released only in the colon, as desired. This is due to the reductive environment in the colon (the presence of the azoreductase enzyme), where the enzymatic degradation of the azo bond resulted in controlled release. In addition, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were performed in a rat model of induced colitis to test the effect of the magnetic field during therapy. The results improved when the rats wore a magnetic belt, which extended the retention time of the particles in the desired areas [ 75 38 33 75 33 63 2 63 65 76 63 76 63 70 70 76 76 11 11 65 77 65 65 67 67 Although the advent of active and passive targeting, particularly stimulus-responsive gates, represents an ideal marriage of the latest advancement and actual usage, e.g., folic acid and pH-responsive systems, a reference to likely challenges involved would be appropriate. Nanoparticles (NPs) would naturally encounter some challenges in accessing ideal targets. They can be deposited in non-target tissues due to physiological barriers, heterogeneity of receptor expression, and defective targeting mechanisms, and therefore become potentially toxic and less effective [ 80 81 80 The immune activation through functional nanocarriers is realized by interactions with innate immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and complement proteins. Immune recognition triggers inflammation, immune responses, or even swift clearance, thus presumably constraining therapeutic effects. Surface properties, such as chemical composition, topography, and charge, may influence the immune cell activation and binding specificity. The possible immune interactions need to be well characterized for the development of stealth and immunocompatible nanoparticles [ 82 80 80 6.2. Advantages of MSNs in Various Administration Routes The most recent findings and developments of MSN-based therapeutic approaches are displayed in Table 4 6.2.1. Dermal Drug Administration The skin is our largest organ, which consists of three layers: the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis. Due to its large surface area, it also serves as an important gateway for drug administration [ 25 25 56 25 56 56 25 56 25 25 25 56 25 61 83 61 61 83 61 61 6.2.2. Pulmonary Drug Administration MSNs are also suitable for pulmonary drug delivery. Inhalation is an attractive route of administration since the application is non-invasive and patient-friendly [ 18 18 25 25 56 72 56 56 72 56 Ho et al. employed the Multiple-Path Particle Dosimetry (MPPD) model for aerosolization and determination of lung deposition of silver nanoparticles, which method may be extended to other materials like mesoporous silica nanoparticles [ 87 87 88 88 56 25 25 89 89 90 90 S. aureus 18 18 18 18 62 6.2.3. Oral Drug Administration Oral route is one of the most reliable and popular ways of drug administration, as it is one of the simplest and most convenient ways for self-medication [ 25 56 25 42 56 14 14 25 56 13 13 13 14 Another study focused on repaglinide, an oral antidiabetic drug [ 84 84 84 Mesoporous carriers also offer an attractive alternative in the oral therapy of macromolecules instead of the more complicated parenteral administration. Peptides and proteins may denature in the highly acidic environment of the stomach, lose their structure and function [ 1 13 1 13 91 1 13 1 13 91 1 1 13 7. Oral Dosage Forms 7.1. Tablets Tablets are the most used solid dosage form due to their numerous advantages. They are characterized by excellent physical and chemical stability, high patient compliance, and efficient economic production [ 92 30 39 42 43 92 30 39 42 92 42 93 24 24 39 92 Certain molecules have an excessive adhesive property, and this represents another problem to be eliminated during direct tableting. In this case, a small amount of powder adheres to the surface of the upper- and lower punch or the die during each compression cycle [ 94 92 94 However, mesoporous carriers are often associated with poor tabletability due to bad powder flow behavior; thus, direct tableting can only be achieved by adding various excipients in large quantities [ 95 39 95 96 97 95 36 97 98 97 98 97 98 The potential of MSNs may also be utilized well in the case of polypills. In this case, all drugs must be dissolved in the solvent. After that, the carriers must be loaded with this complex solution, using one of the already mentioned drug loading methods. This can be followed by tableting nanocarriers. This approach can be very useful in the treatment of hypertension, where combination therapy is most often used. Patient compliance could also be improved with the production of such a polypill, since taking one pill instead of multiple pills may be simpler for the combined treatment of high blood pressure [ 99 7.1.1. Low-Dose Tablets One of the biggest challenges of tableting highly potent APIs (antibiotics, hormones, cytostatic molecules) is to achieve content uniformity [ 95 96 95 96 95 96 96 96 94 94 96 100 100 7.1.2. Freeze-Dried Tablets Lyophilization can be safely used for heat-sensitive drug substances because the drug is formulated at low temperatures and low pressure. Another advantage compared to direct compression is that the poor flowability does not cause problems here, and the pore structure of the nanoparticle is not damaged in the absence of compression. The freeze-drying process can be divided into three main steps: freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying [ 101 102 103 102 102 103 102 41 102 103 41 41 41 100 102 103 7.2. Granules/Pellets Mesoporous silica nanoparticles have poor powder rheology and poor flow properties, due to their low bulk density, small particle size, and high hygroscopicity, which make further processing and formulation, especially with direct compression, difficult [ 104 86 104 104 105 104 105 105 105 Wet granulation is the most frequently used technique to process MSNs, due to the many possibilities inherent in it [ 106 104 104 104 40 40 66 S. aureus 66 40 66 85 85 86 86 In the other case, the adsorption capacity of the carriers decreases due to granulation, which can impair the absorption of the molecules, since the binder can cover the surface of the pores or fill the channels [ 105 107 98 To reduce or avoid the liquid used, it is possible to use other granulation techniques instead of the traditional wet granulation: either steam granulation or melt granulation, which reduces the risk of premature drug release compared to traditional wet granulation [ 98 106 108 98 108 In the case of melt granulation, it is necessary to use meltable excipients that can melt at low temperatures (50–90 °C) as a binder [ 98 108 8. Conclusions In recent years, mesoporous silica nanocarriers have attracted great interest in pharmaceutical science due to their advantageous properties. Simple synthesis, low production cost, and tunable physicochemical properties characterize them. Their behavior in the human body, including targeting possibilities, can be influenced by particle size, particle morphology, pore size, internal structure, and surface chemistry. By modifying the surface functional groups and the surface charge, targeted therapy is achievable in several medical conditions. A wide range of drug loading techniques is available (whether solvent-based or solvent-free methods), so the most appropriate method can be selected, and higher drug concentration can be encapsulated, improving loading efficiency. Nevertheless, their formulation for different delivery routes, such as dermal, pulmonary, or the most favorable oral administration, is extremely difficult due to their large specific surface, adhesivity, and low density, which results in poor powder flow properties, posing a huge challenge in the manufacturing and formulation of solid dosage forms. Agglomeration of the particles by granulation or pelletization is an excellent solution for improving flowability. Concluding this, the granulation process of mesoporous silica needs to be investigated and optimized to maintain the initially high porosity and high specific surface area of the material.
