Here, we use a Black feminist approach to engage Black women in a qualitative exploration of the impact of medical racism on their health-related decision-making. Specifically, we explore the question, how does exposure to information on medical racism impact Black women today and inform their perceptions of healthcare? This qualitative study uses Black feminist approaches to study design including advisory boards, interviewer concordance, and focus group data collection with Black female college students who were in the developmental phase of emerging adulthood, ages 18–25. We also led seven virtual focus groups that focused on dialogue around agents of sexual socialization including knowledge of historical and ongoing medical racism. Four themes emerged from our thematic analysis. The first theme was compromised mental health. The second theme was a wealth and health paradox whereby income and education did not mitigate the impact of racism on health. The third theme was medical racism and distrust. And the fourth theme was around the role of Black Americans as guinea pigs, autonomous actors, and advocates in healthcare. Medical racism, whether it is experienced firsthand, vicariously, or as a part of one’s history, is a source of anxiety for Black women. This barrier to care must be addressed to promote health equity in the USA.

Racism itself, however, is also noted as a key determinant of health [ 6 7 8 9 Racism and Health In terms of the system of healthcare, racism, sometimes referred to as medical racism, manifests in several ways. It can be systemic, as described by the SDOH, where access to resources with known connections to health is limited for some and abundant for others. It can be interpersonal, where patient-provider interactions are based on racial differences and driven by stereotypes [ 10 12 13 14 15 12 Medical racism can also be historical and vicarious. Historical racism is particularly relevant to studies of Black health as Black Americans have a unique and sordid history with healthcare and medical research [ 16 17 18 19 As a result of the multifaceted nature of medical racism, Black Americans have a heightened sense of medical distrust [ 20 21 22 18 23 24 Theory: Black Feminist Approach The central tenet of Black Feminist thought is that Black women are a unique group of Americans as members of two marginalized populations. According to Collins [ 9 25 Methods The current study used data from a larger project, “An Exploratory Study of Barriers to Black Women’s Involvement in Gynecological Research and Healthcare” conducted at a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and a Predominantly White Institution (PWI) in the southeastern region of the USA. Both campuses provided IRB approval for the study in 2019. The sample was limited to Black female college students between the ages of 18 and 25, who identified as heterosexual. Those inclusion criteria are in place to (1) understand the Black female experience during emerging adulthood and (2) focus on gendered racism without potentially conflating homophobia. Although Black women’s perceptions of historical medical racism may not vary based on sexual orientation, the larger study included explorations of discrimination in healthcare and related research which is where homophobia could potentially be conflated. Emerging adulthood, ages 18–25, is an important developmental phase to focus on as young Americans are most likely to engage in high-risk sexual behaviors as they transition from adolescents to adults [ 26 We employed Black feminist methodology by Collins [ 9 27 27 9 8 27 18 Data Collection We conducted seven focus groups with the women from the HBCU ( n n Data Analysis We used a paid transcription service provider, to transcribe the focus groups. The research team listened to recordings and reviewed the transcripts for accuracy. All audio files were transcribed and de-identified to ensure accuracy and anonymity. Our analytical approach focused on Black Feminist perspectives as well as inductive thematic analysis. In line with Black feminist inquiry, we included Black female research assistants in the analysis process who were also emerging adults like our respondents. This helped bridge a potential age between the PIs and the respondents to ensure responses were not misrepresented. We also collectively processed our own traumas that arose during analysis as a team of Black women who have also been impacted by medical racism. Each of the three PIs and two student assistants worked to code the focus groups. Braun and Clark [ 28 28 Appendix 1 Trustworthiness and Reflexivity As Black female investigators researching a sensitive topic about Black women, we reflected on our positionality and the potential for bias. Lincoln and Guba [ 29 Results Women’s familiarity with data about sexual and gynecological health, current and past, varied. The women majoring in the social sciences tended to be familiar with some of the issues presented. Most of them did not study the issues in depth and were appreciative of the contextual information provided in the focus group. We derived four major themes from the analysis of the focus group data. The themes were compromised mental health, wealth and health paradox, medical distrust and racism, and the role of Black Americans. These themes reflected the Black women’s concerns about inferior quality healthcare and interaction with providers. The themes also highlighted how past traumatic events and current realities of Black women’s negative maternal and other health concerns may be contributing to the anxiety that Black women experience regarding healthcare. Compromised Mental Health The first theme from our analysis was compromised mental health. We conceptualize compromised mental health as references to distress, anxiety, anger, fear, or any feeling that leads to poor mental health and/or physiological responses. After the women were presented with known mistreatment of Black women in sexual healthcare, they were asked to respond to what they saw and heard. All the women noted that even though several events happened many years ago, they felt distressed and uncomfortable knowing that race impacted how Black women were treated. The more recent data they saw on current disparities left them feeling distressed as Black women of childbearing age. Our participants also noted that despite the information being difficult to hear and process, they were relieved to know that educators are discussing these issues at least in the college classroom. History teachers were becoming more comfortable with talking about how Black people were really treated instead of just following the actual curriculum guideline. These events are unsettling to me. - Lisa I think that those experiments it’s very heavy. It’s definitely a weight that we have to carry with us. - Kesha Here, we see two examples of young Black women who are experiencing poor psychological and physiological sensations that stem from exposure to instances of historical and vicarious racism. A Black feminist analysis of theme one would call for an interrogation of the system of healthcare which is rooted in and structured by white dominance and patriarchy. Collins [ 8 Wealth and Health Paradox The second theme from our analysis was the wealth and health paradox. The wealth and health paradox describes the realities faced by Black women in the USA. We operationalize the wealth and health paradox as health outcomes that are counter to existing frameworks around the relationships between health and social class. The Fundamental Cause Theory is an example that posits that social conditions are the greatest predictors of health; thus, the more educated and financially stable individuals are more likely they are to receive quality healthcare and have better health [ 30 31 The notion that being financially well-off should equate to having positive experiences in healthcare was discussed. The women acknowledged that even famous and popular Black women, like Serena Williams and Beyonce, experienced challenges with pregnancy and that if these women had challenges, then they were likely to as well. Our participants were aware that being educated did not shield them from having challenges with healthcare and poor maternal health outcomes. I remember hearing about Serena Williams and Beyonce, and how they have their pregnancy complications, and that terrified me because I’m just like, these women are the richest Black women ever and they’re having pregnancy complications. What does that mean for me? That terrified me to have kids. - Nia I’m just like, I thought we were trying to get more college-educated, we’re trying to wait longer, and be more informed so that we can reduce these risks. But it was like, the stress from racism that occurs in the workforce is aging us and the more college-educated we are, we’re more at risk to have complications. - Erica The health and wealth paradox is another example of a cost of the controlling images in place to marginalize Black women. The notion that Black women are strong, and do not experience pain at the same rates as white women, is so pervasive that not even fame or fortune can mitigate its impact. Medical Distrust and Racism The third theme that emerged from our analysis was medical distrust and racism. The sense of distrust seemed to come from the socialization Black women received within their own families. They discussed how family members steered them towards finding Black healthcare professionals after having poor experiences with non-Black healthcare providers. Several participants were already aware that race intertwined with healthcare experiences and that these experiences were part of Black history and persist in the present day. They were keenly aware of the role that Black women played in advancing medical knowledge and the expense of their health and well-being. Here, we see two manifestations of vicarious racism. In one case, the respondent took the words of her mom and used them as motivation to seek out Black doctors for all her healthcare needs. In the other case, a participant took her aunt’s experience and used it to contextualize existing disparities. Medical Distrust Growing up, like, my mom always made sure every doctor I’ve ever had in my life was Black. From my dentist to my dermatologist, she would always just explain to us why she’s always made sure that we had Black doctors, particularly women doctors if we could… and how it can sometimes be the difference between life and death. - Gina Racism I could definitely see there’s definitely a disparity when it comes to Black women and white women within the healthcare industry, just based on how my aunt was treated. She had to change the hospital and her doctors quite often, just because she was getting older white men who were telling her things, and it was just… they were combating each other in a way. -Lisa Medical distrust and medical racism are health-related manifestations of larger systems in place to perpetuate white male supremacy. A Black feminist perspective of medical distrust would connect Black women’s skepticism to historical events like those highlighted in the focus groups, as well as the experiences of Black women study participants themselves, and their loved ones [ 9 Role of Black Americans The fourth theme, the role of Black Americans, showed the diverse ways Black women conceptualized the role of Black Americans in terms of health and healthcare. The subthemes included medical guinea pigs, empowered, and autonomous actors. First, several participants expressed frustrations around the misuse of Black Americans in health-related research; for example, Kimi stated, “Black people have been at the hands of white nonsense for centuries and it’s just… it’s disgusting.” Second, from a vastly different perspective, several participants saw historical and ongoing medical racism as a reason to be empowered and advocate for others. The empowered subtheme demonstrates Black women’s sense of agency and purpose. They also noted that it was important for them to be advocates and stand stronger for other Black women. For these women, having the knowledge and awareness empowered them to take the necessary steps towards improving their own health experiences and outcomes. It also makes me want to also stand stronger for women and stand up for Black women, us as women and our sexuality and our identities. - Raye Third, several Black women saw this as a call to take charge of their own health or be autonomous health actors. They indicated that knowing about historical and present traumas in healthcare means that they must take the initiative on preventative care. Specifically, Chell noted, “because in the Black community parents say, go get tested, but it’s not like the thing where everyone is protesting. People don’t actually go as often as they should…We have to promote it more to where we make it as testing isn’t a bad thing. Everyone should go get tested.” Medical racism is a system of oppression that works to keep Black women marginalized and perpetually in poor health. Black feminist thought would call for Black women to mobilize and push back against the oppressive system of healthcare. Collins [ 9 In summary, the four themes highlighted Black women’s reactions to present and historical instances of medical racism. Our participants expressed anxiety and despair from learning more about atrocities Black women have, and continue to, face as well as revisiting stories of personal and vicarious racism. They also indicated that they felt the need to take action to improve their health outcomes despite the negative experiences that some women face(d). Discussion Overall, the findings showed that knowledge of socio-cultural and historical issues and events invokes healthcare-related anxiety for Black women. This corroborates previous findings showing that Black women experience generational trauma that stems from distrust in the healthcare system [ 18 10 32 33 The wealth and health paradox theme is supported by the literature as well. While some studies show that higher income and education levels are associated with better healthcare access, others indicate that in the case of Black Americans, this is not co. In some instances, Black women from higher SES and education levels experience higher odds of cardiovascular issues postpartum compared to low-income White women [ 34 35 34 The role of Black women theme highlighted Black women’s awareness of their history as medical guinea pigs, willingness to take agency of their own health, and preparedness to advocate for themselves. These findings are identifiable using a Black feminist approach as Collins [ 9 36 1 10 37 Taken together, these findings call for an expansion of healthcare to a more comprehensive care that considers the socio-cultural contexts that Black women live in, as well as their expectations for healthcare providers. The apparent fear of being profiled or stereotyped, and having knowledge of past medical-related trauma, can create barriers to accessing timely healthcare and selection of healthcare providers. A conceptual map with recommendations for healthcare providers is below. Key takeaways include recognizing the historical context of trauma, understanding that income and education are not the sole indicators of health outcomes, and building trust through transparency and cultural humility, as well as supporting advocacy efforts and respecting autonomy in health decision-making. Recognizing the historical context of trauma is vital in building connections and minimizing medical distrust among Black women. It helps in patient-provider interactions and patients feel seen and providers can acknowledge their positionality in the complex system of healthcare, and it enlightens Black women who may experience biased care with no knowledge of the root causes of those biases. Recognizing that socioeconomic status is not the sole indicator of health allows for a more intersectional understanding of patient-provider interactions and creates space to examine the role of racism as a social determinant of that. Building trust through cultural humility means looking inward. This calls for healthcare workers to ask, why do Black women fail to receive quality care on a consistent basis and what changes can we make to end that cycle? Finally, respecting autonomy in health-related decision-making means partnering with Black women patients. This means offering them several options and allowing them to make informed decisions about their own healthcare. Conceptual map of medical racism as a social determinant of Black women’s sexual healthcare. Study Limitations The study relied on focus group data to center the experiences of Black college women. There are several advantages to using focus group data that allows participants to build upon the responses of others; focus groups also carry disadvantages [ 38 Future Directions The findings of the study are limited to perception from a focus group of 28 women. Therefore, additional mixed method methodologies should be used to further examine how awareness of past and current instances of medical racism impacts Black women’s actions related to their healthcare. It is also important to engage the broader community in basic and applied research to help Black women process medical racism. Women from all socioeconomic levels should be engaged in future studies to better understand how income and education interact with the knowledge of medical racism and subsequent engagement with healthcare providers. We also recommend that medical and related health professions training must explicitly address and involve solution seeking around medical distrust and ongoing racism. Engaging with human services and mental health providers is also important to provide intervention for processing current and past traumas evoked by knowledge and experiences with medical racism. More research is needed to understand how trauma-informed interventions could support Black women’s pursuit of good healthcare. Conclusion Here, we analyzed data related to Black female college student’s perspectives on present and past instances of medical racism. The themes revealed that Black women experienced distress in learning about medical racism and that these experiences, though disheartening, often propelled them to advocate for better healthcare for themselves. We conclude that the awareness of the disparities related to Black women’s sexual health outcomes and the atrocities experienced can motivate Black women to be autonomous actors in advocating for improved healthcare experiences. In other cases, Black women experience anxiety which can become a serious barrier to care. Thus, these findings are also a call to action for healthcare training and medical services that integrate cultural humility and can meet the needs of Black women.
