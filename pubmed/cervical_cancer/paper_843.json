Many of these chronic diseases can be prevented or their onset mitigated through lifestyle interventions. Complementing these efforts, robust biomarkers enable early diagnosis (secondary prevention), while tertiary prevention can reduce long-term complications and improve disease management. Moreover, the importance of prevention extends beyond NCDs to infectious diseases, where lifestyle-related factors can also play a pivotal role. Innovative human-based research methods have shown suitable for modeling several diseases and advancing drug discovery. These approaches are particularly relevant in prevention research, given the inherently human nature of the lifestyle and environmental factors associated with disease risk and progression. Methods Here we conducted a retrospective evaluation of biomedical research projects funded under the 7th Framework Programme (FP7), Horizon 2020, and currently ongoing Horizon Europe (HE). We developed and refined a computer-based approach based on the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to examine three key aspects: (i) the integration of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention in these projects, (ii) the biomedical research areas which most frequently incorporate prevention, and (iii) the use of animal-based research versus human-centric approaches. Results Our findings reveal a persistent gap in the percentage of prevention-focused biomedical research projects, with only 4.4%, 4.5%, and 1.9% of FP7, H2020, and HE projects, respectively, addressing prevention. This gap was particularly pronounced in certain biomedical research areas, such as age-related diseases and diabetes and metabolic syndrome research, which showed a decrease in the percentage of prevention-related projects especially under most recent framework programme (HE). While the reliance on animal-based methods has been generally modest, averaging around 26% of all prevention-related projects, tertiary prevention research, and prevention projects focused on some biomedical areas (i.e., age-related diseases, personalized medicine, antimicrobial resistance, bone disorders, and respiratory diseases) showed increased percentages in projects using animals under more recent FPs. Analysis of funding distribution revealed progressively less funding allocated to prevention-related projects focused on diabetes and metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, age-related disorders, and AMR. In addition, the proportion of funding allocated to both secondary and tertiary prevention decreased under HE. Conclusions A shift toward human-centric approaches, particularly in prevention-focused research, is essential to enhance the translatability of findings. As policymakers prepare for the next EU funding framework, these insights offer critical guidance for developing targeted funding strategies that prioritize human-centric prevention research as a cornerstone of public health.

Strategies such as adopting a varied and balanced plant-based diet [ 3 5 6 7 10 Complementing these efforts, the use of robust biomarkers for early diagnosis (secondary prevention) can inform personalized medical interventions [ 11 12 12 13 In some cases, preventive measures have proven to be more effective than curative approaches (pharmaceutical treatments), either in preventing disease onset or in managing associated symptoms [ 14 15 16 17 Furthermore, many NCDs are interrelated [ 18 19 20 The importance of prevention extends beyond NCDs to infectious diseases, where lifestyle-related factors can also play a pivotal role. For instance, specific high-quality plant-based dietary patterns have been shown to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection and hospitalization [ 21 Despite chronic diseases accounting for up to 80% of healthcare costs in the EU, preventive healthcare represented only 0.38% of GDP in 2020 [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 Concerning communicable diseases, in November 2020, the European Commission put forward a new health security framework designed to better protect EU citizens. Drawing on lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, this framework strengthens the EU’s ability to prevent, prepare for, and respond to serious cross-border health threats. It does so through Regulation (EU) 2022/2371 [ 28 29 30 A previous analysis conducted by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) examined the major outputs associated with Alzheimer’s disease, breast cancer, and prostate cancer research projects funded under framework programme 5 (FP5), FP6, FP7, and Horizon 2020 (H2020), and what role the selection of the methodological approach(es) (animal and/or human-based methods and technologies) played in the generation of research impact [ 31 The present study aimed to expand this analysis by conducting a comprehensive retrospective evaluation of biomedical research projects funded under FP7, H2020, and current Horizon Europe (HE). Utilizing data retrieved from the CORDIS database [ 32 The results of this analysis could inform future research funding strategies by identifying specific biomedical and disease areas where prevention-related research has been underfunded. Highlighting the importance of human-centric research strategies in this context can enhance the translatability of findings and maximize the long-term impact of research investments. Relying on human-relevant research strategies is especially important when the goal of research is to explore the systemic and multi-factorial elements underlying human behavior, lifestyle, disease etiology and complexity [ 33 Such insights are particularly timely as policymakers and funding bodies prepare for the next European funding programme, FP10. By highlighting trends and gaps in prevention-related research, this study seeks to guide the development of targeted calls for proposals that better align with the overarching goal of improving public health outcomes through preventive measures [ 34 Methodological approach Manual screening of CORDIS projects Information on projects funded under the FP7 (2007–2013), H2020 (2014–2020) and currently ongoing Horizon Europe (HE) (2021 - till October 24, 2024) was retrieved from the European Commission’s CORDIS web portal [ 32 Manual screening was conducted independently by two researchers (FP and FF), following a predefined set of qualifiers and specific keywords for each qualifier to label the projects. Irrelevant entries, i.e., non-biomedical projects, were excluded from the analysis. To limit the number of biomedical research areas, a set of keywords was pre-defined and subsequently refined to enable the clustering of projects according to their main field of research. For example, projects related to different types of cancer were all labeled under “cancer”. In a similar way, disorders falling under the umbrella of metabolic syndromes (including diabetes) were labeled as “metabolic syndromes/diabetes”. The same approach was used to group projects addressing various rare diseases (labelled as “rare disease”), ageing-related complications (“ageing”), infectious diseases (“infection OR virus”), and other health issues 1  Table 1 Main qualifiers considered in this analysis and keywords assigned to label projects Qualifier Description and rules Main keywords assigned to label projects (indicated in bold) Disease area, biomedical research topic Indicate the main biomedical research area (e.g., cancer, diabetes, obesity, HIV, virus, infectious disease, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, ageing, diet, healthcare, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), etc.). Be consistent with the use of keywords. Combinations of keywords can be used to label each project, as appropriate. For example, the same project may have covered ‘inflammation’ and ‘cancer’, or ‘ageing’ and ‘dementia’, or ‘rare disease’ and ‘development’, etc ‘ Cancer ‘Metabolic syndrome’ ‘ Alzheimer dementia ‘ Neurodegenerative ‘Mental health’ ‘ Heart Cardiovascular ‘Infection’ staphylococcus ‘ Virus’ ‘Rare disease’ ‘ Elderly ‘ageing’ ‘ Child’ ‘infant’ ‘ Development ‘ AMR ‘ Healthcare ‘ Osteo’ bone ‘ Autoimmune ‘ Respiratory ‘ Inflammation inflammatory ‘ Personalized medicine’ precision medicine Type of prevention Indicate what type of prevention was considered in the project. Combinations of keywords can be used to label each project, as appropriate. For example, the same project may have covered ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ prevention, or ‘secondary’ and ‘tertiary’ prevention, or all three prevention categories, etc. If a project is a false positive (i.e., the word ‘prevention’ appears in the Objective field, but the project does not focus on biomedical science), label it as ‘not relevant.’ Similarly, projects addressing non-human animal diseases (e.g., porcine pneumonia or sheep toxoplasmosis) should also be labeled as ‘not relevant’ ‘Primary’ ‘ Secondary’ ‘Tertiary’ Use of animals Indicate whether live animals (in bred or transgenic) were considered in the project. Species like Drosophila m. If the information is unclear (as it is not explicitly mentioned in the objective), make your best guess by indicating “yes” or “no” followed by “unclear”, ‘Yes’ ‘No’ Use of human methods/models Indicate whether human-centered approaches, methods or models were considered. After indicating ‘yes’ or ‘no’, specify what approach was used. Combination of keywords can be used to label each project, as appropriate. For example, the same project may have considered ‘humans’ and ‘in vitro’, or ‘humans’ and ‘in silico’, or a combination of all three approaches etc. If the information is unclear (as it is not explicitly mentioned under the objective), make your best guess by indicating “yes” or “no” followed by “unclear” ‘Yes’ “ humans” “ in vitro” “ in silico” ‘No’ This preliminary (manual) data set was used to design a computational-based approach based on the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP)/Large Language Model (LLM) to identify additional biomedical research projects addressing prevention, as described in Sect. 2.2 Natural language processing-based approach for data analysis The initial (manual) pilot data set was extended by using a Large language model (LLM) approach. The DeepSeek-V3 LLM [ 36 S4 We used precision, recall, and F1-score (their harmonic mean) to evaluate how the NLP approach performed. Using the manually annotated pilot as a gold standard, Table 2  Table 2 LLM-based inference performance evaluation Criteria evaluated Precision Recall F1-score Is prevention-related? 1.000 0.873 0.932 Primary prevention 0.737 0.762 0.750 Secondary prevention 0.788 0.639 0.706 Tertiary prevention 0.563 0.724 0.634 The LLM screening led to the identification of 595 FP7, 1,120 H2020, and 36 HE additional prevention-related projects that were combined with the initial manual data set to generate an extended annotated data set (see Supplementary Excel “FP7-H2020-HE_Prevention Projects_EXTENDED DATA SET”). The extended data set was considered in the final analysis (Table 3  Table 3 Total number of biomedical research projects (and funding) addressing prevention considered in this retrospective analysis Projects FP7 H2020 HE (as of Oct 24, 2024) Total number of projects 19,814 35,386 13,865 Biomedical projects addressing “prevention” 881 (4.4%) 1,582 (4.5%) 259 (1.9%) Total budget for the framework programme (Euro) 55.7 billion 83.1 billion 41.2 billion Budget allocated to projects addressing “prevention” 3.45 billion (6.2%) 3.52 billion (4.2%) 1.71 billion (4.2%) The Excel filter function was used to group projects together based on their keywords. The grouping considered the following qualifiers:  prevention type (primary, secondary, tertiary, alone or in combination), the biomedical or disease area, the use of animals, the use of human-centered methods and approaches also defined as non-animal new approach methods or NAMs (considering ‘humans’, ‘in vitro’, and/or ‘in silico’). as shown in Figs. 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 5 6 7  Fig. 1 Overall numbers and percentages of prevention-related projects.

A B J B C D E F G H I J A Results Overall proportions of prevention-related biomedical research projects We first evaluated the overall representation of prevention-related biomedical research projects funded under the EU’s framework programmes FP7, H2020, and HE (Table 3 1 3 Further categorization of these projects by the type of prevention– primary, secondary, and tertiary – showed fluctuating distributions across the three funding programmes (Fig. 1 When examining projects with an exclusive focus on a single prevention type, primary prevention was the most prevalent under FP7 and HE, while projects that focused exclusively on secondary prevention were more common under H2020. In contrast, tertiary prevention projects consistently represented the smallest category (Fig. 1 A closer examination of the primary prevention-related projects revealed that ‘vaccines’ and ‘nutrition/diet’ related projects accounted for 5.4–9.6% and 8.8–10.3%, respectively, of all primary prevention-related projects funded under FP7, H2020, and HE, with vaccine showing a decline across the analyzed framework programmes (Suppl. Figure 1). Biomedical research areas mostly addressed in prevention-related projects Next, we assessed what biomedical or disease areas were most frequently addressed in prevention-related projects funded under these three funding programmes (FP7, H2020 and HE). The data revealed that cancer, infectious diseases or virus-related research, diabetes and/or other metabolic syndrome-related disorders, and heart and/or cardiovascular diseases, were the top four biomedical research areas addressed in prevention-related projects (Fig. 2 Notably, personalized/precision medicine-related projects addressing prevention also showed a remarkable increase starting from H2020 (7.9%, 15.1% and 24.3%, under FP7, H2020 and HE, respectively) (Fig. 2 An increase in the percentage of projects addressing prevention was observed for inflammation-related research, where the percentage of these projects increased from 1.5% under FP7, to 2.7% under H2020 and 6.6% under HE (Fig. 3 When considering the total numbers of projects that focused on the aforementioned diseases/biomedical areas (regardless of prevention) globally funded under these three FPs, the average percentage of those that incorporated prevention shifted from about 19% (under FP7 and H2020) to a lower 7.8% under HE considering all diseases on average (Table 4 4  Table 4 Total numbers of disease-specific research projects funded under FP7, H2020 and horizon Europe (HE), along with the

pediatric disorders, healthcare, rare diseases, inflammation-related diseases, and personalized/precision medicine — showed higher percentages of funding under most recent FPs (H2020 and HE) compared to FP7, other areas, including diabetes/metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, age-related disorders, and AMR, exhibited declined percentages under current HE, whilst others (e.g., cancer,

the type of prevention addressed by projects covering the nine most represented biomedical areas (i.e., cancer, infectious and/or viral diseases, diabetes and other metabolic syndrome disorders, cardiovascular diseases, ageing-related disorders, mental health issues, neurodegenerative disorders, healthcare, and the general field of personalized/precision medicine) (Fig. 3 S1 In the fields of both cancer and cardiovascular disease research, a higher percentage of projects addressing secondary prevention could be noticed (Fig. 3 3 3 3 Similarly, primary prevention-related projects addressing ageing/elderly disease research decreased under H2020 (68.6%, 54% and 61.5% for the three FPs, respectively) (Fig. 3 3 Noteworthy, in the field of mental health and neurodegenerative diseases, the percentage of primary prevention projects increased under H2020 and HE, with more than 77% and nearly 43% of HE projects addressing primary prevention, respectively (Fig. 3 The proportion of primary, secondary and tertiary prevention projects focusing on healthcare varied across the three FPs, but generally showed a predominance of primary and secondary prevention activities especially under FP7 and HE (Fig. 3 The percentage of personalized medicine projects considering primary prevention decreased under H2020 (36%) compared to FP7 (45.7%) and HE (60.3%) (Fig. 3 3 3 When considering other diseases or biomedical research fields, we found some increased percentages in HE projects addressing primary prevention specifically in the areas of Alzheimer’s disease/dementia (31%, 29% and 54.5% for the three FPs, respectively) (Suppl. Table S1 Similar figures were observed also in the field of development-related disorders (47.4%, 57.8% and 87.5% of FP7, H2020 and HE projects addressing primary prevention, respectively), as well as respiratory diseases (33.3%, 63% and 80%, respectively) (Suppl. Table S1 In contrast, the percentage of osteo-/bone-related diseases addressing primary prevention showed a decrease under H2020 (33.3%, 20.7% and 42.9% for the three FPs, respectively). Similarly, the proportion of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) research projects addressing primary prevention decreased under HE (53.8%, 52.9%, and 42.9% of FP7, H2020 and HE primary prevention projects, respectively), while the percentage of AMR-related secondary prevention/diagnostics research projects decreased under H2020 (46.2%, 32.4% and 57.1%, respectively). On the other hand, the percentage of projects on childhood/infancy-related disorders as well as autoimmune diseases that addressed secondary prevention increased under more recent FPs (from 32.3% in FP7, to 53.4% in H2020, and 47.8% in HE, for childhood/infancy, and from 50% in FP7, to 67.7% in H2020 and 71.4% in HE, for autoimmune disorders) (Suppl.

Table S2 S2 S2 Noteworthy, when considering the use of animal-based models in relation to the type of prevention research (primary, secondary or tertiary), we observed that the percentage of exclusively tertiary prevention-related projects that accounted for animals increased under HE, from 37.5% in both FP7 and H2020, to and 50% in HE (Fig. 5 5 5 5 5 Use of human-centric approaches in prevention-related biomedical projects We further explored the proportion of projects that considered the use of human-centered approaches, either alone or in combination with other methods (Fig. 6 1 Our findings revealed that the vast majority of all prevention-related projects made use of such approaches (85.7%, 88.2%, and 93.1%, for FP7, H2020 and HE, respectively), with increasing percentages across the three FPs (Fig. 6 When examining specific subcategories, we noticed that most of these projects focused on patients/participants’ cohorts, clinical trials and/or biological samples (‘humans’) (72.7%, 76.6% and 70.5% for the three FPs, respectively) (Fig. 6 The percentage of projects utilizing in vitro methods/models slightly decreased under most recent FP (35%, 31%, and 26.1%, for FP7, H2020 and HE, respectively) (Fig. 6 6 When considering the nine most represented biomedical areas, similar percentage distributions could be observed, particularly for cancer (Fig. 6 6 6 6 6 6 In the area of mental health, prevention-related projects that utilized in vitro methods were relatively underrepresented (between 0.9 and 6.8% across all FPs, green bars), while the percentage of those considering computational approaches increased over time (45.7%, 42.9% and 61.5%, respectively, see light blue bars in Fig. 6 6 On the other hand, the percentage of prevention projects on neurodegenerative diseases that considered the use of any human-based methods decreased under H2020 and the most recent HE (90.6%, 85.3%, and 78.6%, for FP7, H2020, and HE, respectively) (Fig. 6H, dark blue bars). When considering other less represented disease areas, under HE, an increase in the percentage of projects that considered the use of computational/in silico approaches was noted in the field of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia (44.8%, 59.7%, and 90.9%, under FP7, H2020, and HE, respectively) (Suppl. Figure 3 A and Suppl. Table S3 S3 S3 S3 S3 Despite the generally high percentage of prevention projects that addressed AMR and utilized human-based approaches (78.5% across all three FPs, on average), a decrease in the percentage of such projects could be seen over time, from 84.6% under FP7, to 79.4% under H2020, and 71.4% under HE (considering all human-based approaches altogether) (Suppl. Figure 3D and Suppl. Table S3 An analysis of funding distribution across projects, based on their use of animal or human-based methods (NAMs), shows an overall decrease in funding percentages under the most recent HE programme (Table 7  Table 7 Funding distribution across methods (animals and NAMs) Prevention-related FP7 H2020 HE Total funding (€) Total funding (€) Total funding (€) 3,446,101,731.32 3,515,757,578.18 1,714,215,247.86 Projects with animals 1,008,047,406.61 727,300,987.01 201,958,862.80 29.3 20.7 11.8 Projects without animals 2,438,054,324.71 2,788,456,591.17 1,072,024,866.09 70.7 79.3 62.5 Projects with NAMs 3,199,394,825.86 3,293,710,050.20 1,256,575,719.89 92.8 93.7 73.3 Both absolute numbers and relative percentages are reported Discussion How much does the EU invest in prevention within biomedical research? In 2021, EU Member States invested approximately €95.3 billion in preventive healthcare, accounting for 0.65% of GDP. This marked an 88.2% increase from the previous year, largely influenced by COVID-19-related immunization programmes [ 22 37 38 Low preventive healthcare expenditure in EU countries can lead to several long-term health impacts, in particular, a higher prevalence of NCDs [ 39 40 41 In addition, poor health from preventable diseases costs the European economy approximately 15% of GDP annually due to lost productivity and reduced quality of life, creating a cycle of economic decline [ 41 40 As populations age, the demand for healthcare increases, yet low preventive spending fails to effectively address the underlying health issues [ 42 43 In this retrospective analysis we sought to investigate the extent to which the EU has invested in prevention-related biomedical research during the last three framework programmes (FP7, H2020 and HE). Our findings reveal a persistent underinvestment in prevention-focused research, with only 4.4%, 4.5%, and 1.9% of life sciences-related projects addressing prevention under the entire FP7, H2020, and HE funding cycles, respectively. These projects were supported with 6.2% of the overall budget under FP7, and an equal 4.2% of the overall budget under both H2020 and HE. When considering the overall number of biomedical research projects covering a specific disease, we found that the percentage of those that accounted for prevention ranged between 7.8 and 19% over the three FPs (on average, about 15% of all biomedical-related projects). When looking at cancer, in particular, the average of projects addressing prevention was about 9.5%, while those focused on Alzheimer’s were on average 12.6% (see Table 4 31 4 When considering percentages of funding distribution, some areas, including diabetes and metabolic syndrome, neurodegenerative diseases, age-related disorders, and AMR exhibit a decrease across the three analysed FPs. Due to the potential impact of preventative measures on overall health, greater investment in prevention research is essential, aligning with recent policy recommendations [ 24 27 Notably, while primary and secondary prevention were well-represented in these projects, a concerning figure emerged: the percentage of primary prevention projects specifically addressing nutrition research represented less than 10% on average. This is particularly alarming given the critical role of diet in preventing NCDs such as cardiovascular disease [ 44 45 46 47 21 Several factors may contribute to the underfunding of nutrition research, which has significant public health implications. One reason could be that nutrition research often lacks the clear, tangible outcomes and quick returns on investment that are typically associated with pharmaceutical or therapeutic interventions [ 48 49 To address this gap, future funding frameworks should prioritize lifestyle-based prevention strategies, including nutrition and diet research, to enhance the prevention and delay the onset of major diseases. By doing so, we can capitalize on the potential of preventative nutrition approaches to improve public health outcomes and reduce the burden of NCDs. Projects on infectious and/or viral disease research, as well as those on ageing and elderly diseases that addressed primary prevention showed a decline starting from H2020. Considering the beneficial protective impact of primary preventative interventions and the role of lifestyle factors, such as diet in preventing infectious diseases [ 50 51 52 53 On a positive note, mental health-related projects that considered primary prevention showed an increase in percentage comparing the three FPs, which is in line with current EP recommendations [ 25 54 Lifestyle-related interventions, including dietary and physical activity, have been shown promising to prevent osteoporosis and the risk of bone fractures [ 55 57 It is noteworthy to mention that AMR has been recognized as one of the most pressing global health and development threats [ 58 59 58 4 S1 The use of animals in biomedical research related to prevention Traditionally, conducting research in areas such as neuroscience, ageing, immune system function, infectious disease research (especially for emerging pathogens), systemic effects, and developmental biology has been particularly challenging without the use of animal models or entire living organisms. However, remarkable progress has been made in recent years to overcome these limitations. Advances now enable researchers to study systemic effects, model immune responses [ 60 61 62 63 However, despite the European Medicines Agency (EMA) implementing special support measures through initiatives like the Innovation Task Force [ 64 65 The current regulatory landscape often lags behind technological innovation, particularly regarding the use of NAMs such as advanced in vitro models (e.g., organ-on-chip, 3D tissue constructs), and computational models. The regulatory landscape should keep pace with scientific progress in the field of NAMs, enabling the integration of advanced, human-specific technologies that can improve biomedical research, enhance safety assessments, and reduce reliance on animal models. Without regulatory alignment, scientific advancements risk being underutilized, delaying both safer product development and more ethical research practices. It should also be considered that the use of animals in basic or translational research aimed at understanding human diseases is not a regulatory requirement. In fact, human-based models, tools, and approaches are now widely available and increasingly used in these areas [ 66 31 67 Our analysis revealed an increase in the percentages of projects accounting for the use of computational/in silico approaches, including ‘omics’ and large human datasets, under more recent FPs. This reflects a growing recognition of the importance of human health data-driven approaches in elucidating the complexities of disease pathogenesis and developing targeted interventions. Human health-derived data, including electronic health records (EHRs), biobank and patients’ registries, medical imaging and multi-omics studies, have emerged as a vital resource for identifying disease risk factors, discovering novel biomarkers, and devising personalized prevention strategies [ 12 33 A crucial step towards optimizing the utilization of human health data is the establishment of the European Health Data Space (EHDS), which aims to standardize and facilitate secure access to health data across EU member states [ 68 Our analysis revealed that the majority of prevention-related projects (almost 90% on average) utilized human-centered approaches (alone or combined with other animal methods), with percentages increasing over time. Nevertheless, animal use in basic and translational research remains disproportionately high, accounting for 72% of animal use in these areas, as reported in the 2022 ALURES statistics [ 69 70 Our analysis of EU-funded prevention-related biomedical research projects funded under the three analyzed FPs indicates that almost 26% involved the use of animals. While this may be interpreted as a positive finding indicative of reduced animal use in prevention science, it underscores a potentially missed opportunity. Prevention research, by its very nature, deals with systemic and multifaceted elements of human behavior, lifestyle, disease etiology, and complexity—areas that are intrinsically challenging, if not impossible, to model in non-human species [ 33 Moreover, our analysis highlights a higher percentage in the use of animal-based models within tertiary prevention research, with an increase from 37.5% in both FP7 and H2020 to 50% in HE. Tertiary prevention strategies have generally relied on pharmaceutical interventions to reduce long-term complications and improve disease management. The approval and marketing of these interventions have historically been contingent on animal data for safety and efficacy testing. However, in recent years the legislative landscape has evolved, with increasing support for the integration of non-animal testing approaches in the development and evaluation of pharmaceuticals in the EU [ 71 72 73 Among analyzed biomedical research areas, ageing-associated diseases showed an increase over time in the percentage of prevention-related projects that utilized animals, from FP7 (21.4%) to HE (38.5%). Preference for using animals such as mice in ageing studies may stem, apart from their genetic similarity to humans, also from convenience, as their relatively short lifespan allows researchers to observe the progression of aging and age-related diseases within a much shorter timeframe than in humans [ 74 75 76 77 78 77 In addition to studying ageing directly in humans through observational cohort studies, patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiated derivatives have also shown promising for studying cellular ageing and the underlying molecular mechanisms [ 79 80 81 82 84 85 86 87 Our analysis also showed that prevention-related projects focusing on personalized and precision medicine and utilizing animals increased from FP7 (14.3%) to HE (23.8%). Personalized medicine represents a paradigm shift from the “one-size-fits-all” approach, focusing on understanding the individual differences among patients with the same disease. This approach enables the selection of therapies tailored to specific patient groups, predicting the likelihood of a treatment’s effectiveness for each individual [ 88 89 90 91 Our analysis also showed that under current HE, the percentage of prevention-related projects addressing AMR, osteo/bone-related disorders, as well as respiratory diseases, that accounted for the use of animals is higher than in previous FPs (FP7 and H2020). In the context of AMR, this increase is accompanied by a decline in the percentage of prevention projects that incorporate human-centered approaches. Concerns have been raised regarding the comparison of rodent preclinical models to the human skeleton, particularly in the context of cortical bone, highlighting key differences that limit the translational relevance of rodent models in skeletal research [ 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 Study limitations and future directions When considering potential limitations, this study focused solely on CORDIS as the project repository, as one of its primary objectives was to conduct a comparative temporal analysis of the three most recent EU framework programmes (FP7, H2020, and HE). However, it is important to acknowledge that prevention-related projects have also been funded under the EU4Health programme, launched in 2021. These projects, accessible via the EU Funding & Tenders Portal, were highlighted in a recent analysis conducted within the PROPHET project [ 99 100 Future research should aim to expand this analysis by incorporating additional project repositories, such as EU4Health. This could ultimately lead to a more comprehensive understanding of prevention-related projects and their impact on European healthcare policies. Furthermore, further studies should focus on integrating the EHDS with emerging technologies, such as AI-driven analytics and digital health tools, to improve real-time disease monitoring and predictive modeling. The effectiveness of the EHDS in improving human-centered healthcare policies and reducing reliance on animal-based research methodologies will be crucial in shaping the future of European biomedical research. Conclusions and potential recommendations Investing more in prevention-focused research is imperative, particularly through the adoption of human-centric technologies and strategies. The complex interplay of lifestyle-related factors, as well as the etiopathology and physiopathology of diseases in humans, cannot be accurately reproduced in animal models, underscoring the need for approaches that directly reflect human biology. Under HE, an increased use and deployment of human-centric approaches could be observed, compared to previous framework programmes. However, the overall percentage of biomedical research projects addressing prevention remains critically low. Our analysis also reveals an increase in the percentage of projects that accounted for the use of animals specifically in the area of tertiary prevention (from 37.5% in FP7 and H2020 to 50% in HE), ageing-related diseases, and personalized or precision medicine. Similarly, the proportion of HE projects using animals in areas such as AMR, bone, and respiratory diseases is higher than in previous framework programmes. These patterns reflect a counter-productive funding strategy. Prevention research inherently involves complex, human-specific factors—such as behavior, lifestyle, and environmental influences—that are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to model in non-human species. It could be argued that research project planning and funding strategies may default to animal-based approaches out of habit, rather than being guided by a thoughtful, evidence-based assessment of their suitability. Continuing to pour resources into animal-based prevention research—especially for primary and secondary prevention—is not only scientifically questionable, it’s a significant misallocation of public and private funds. Animal models fail to replicate the intricate, multifactorial nature of human health and disease, particularly the dynamic interplay between lifestyle, environment, psychosocial factors, and genetic predisposition. The shift toward human-based research is essential to generate actionable results that can effectively inform and shape public health policies. By prioritizing such approaches, we can bridge the gap between research outputs and their real-world application, leading to improved health outcomes and more sustainable healthcare systems. Based on the main findings of this analysis, some recommendations are proposed (Table 8  Table 8 Possible recommendations for shaping FP10 to enhance prevention-focused research and enable research-to-policy translation Area Recommendation Prevention research, policy alignment, and research impact 1.
