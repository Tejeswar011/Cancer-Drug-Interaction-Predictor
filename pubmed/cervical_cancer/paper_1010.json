In the United States, oropharyngeal cancer in men has now surpassed cervical cancer as the most common HPV-related malignancy. 4 5 Neglect of male HPV prevalence will impede attainment of the WHO “Global cervical cancer elimination” targets and impose an enduring burden on public-health systems. We therefore propose three urgent measures for lower and middle-income countries: First, embed gender-neutral, stigma-free HPV education into routine primary-care encounters. Second, launch organized screening programmes combining HPV testing with targeted oropharyngeal and anal cancer screening for high-risk population, especially men who have sex with men. Third, implement a phased, government-funded HPV vaccination strategy that initially prioritises high-risk male cohorts and subsequently expands to encompass all adolescent boys.
