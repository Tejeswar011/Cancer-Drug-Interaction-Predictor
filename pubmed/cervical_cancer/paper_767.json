This case report describes a three-year-old male bearded dragon that was brought to a veterinary clinic after it suddenly stopped eating. Although it was healthy at an examination ten months earlier, the animal showed signs of a significant pathological condition. Blood tests revealed abnormalities in the white blood cells and proteins that suggested leukemia, a type of cancer that affects lymphocytes, a subset of white blood cells. The animal was treated with medications, including corticosteroids, antibiotics, and an oral chemotherapeutic agent. Initially, the bearded dragon showed transient stabilization before rapidly deteriorating several days later. It developed breathing difficulties and vomited blood shortly before death. A necropsy (post-mortem examination) revealed that many internal organs, particularly the lungs, were severely infiltrated by abnormal lymphocytes. These findings confirmed the presence of an aggressive form of lymphoma/leukemia that had spread throughout the body. Lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia is a rare and severe disease and is difficult to treat in reptiles. This case highlights the importance of early diagnosis and the challenges of treating cancer in exotic animal species.

Introduction Neoplastic diseases, once considered rare in reptiles, have been increasingly reported in recent studies, with a notable prevalence in lizard species [ 1 2 3 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Despite these reports, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (L/L) in reptiles remains poorly documented. There are only a few descriptions that include immunohistochemical confirmation or therapy trials in reptiles. Lymphoblastic leukemia is a clonal hematopoietic malignancy characterized by the proliferation of neoplastic B- or T-lymphocytes from the bone marrow, often involving peripheral blood and other tissues. In mammals, it is classified according to cellular maturity (acute or chronic) and immunophenotype (B-cells or T-cells) [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 5 6 7 8 9 10 22 23 24 This case report describes the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, therapeutic management, and post-mortem findings of disseminated T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia in a pet bearded dragon, a comprehensive approach that has only recently become more routinely implemented in reptile medicine. 2. Case Description A 1.3-year-old male central bearded dragon, weighing 408.6 g at initial presentation, was kept in a well-equipped indoor terrarium with UVB lighting (Arcadia ProT5 UVB Kit–Dragon 14%, Arcadia Reptile, Mepal, Cambridgeshire, UK) with a thermal gradient of 31 to 40 °C. The food consisted of crickets, Zophobas morio The animal remained reportedly healthy until 30 December 2022, when it developed acute anorexia. According to the owner, the bearded dragon had stopped eating insects and was now completely dependent on assisted feeding, which was largely unsuccessful. Nevertheless, clinical examination showed that body condition and alertness were maintained. Subsequent radiographs also showed no abnormalities. Supportive therapy, including assisted feeding with critical care diet (3.5 mL PO of EmerAid Omnivore ® 25 ® On the 26 January 2024, the bearded dragon was again anorexic. The animal was 3.3 years old and weighed 480 g at that time. The physical examination revealed a moderate body condition. Blood samples were collected for hematological and biochemical analysis in a 1.3 mL lithium heparin tube from the ventral tail vein. The hematological analysis showed an erythrocyte count of 0.9 × 10 6 Figure 1 ® 2 26 On the 5 February, the owner reported increased respiratory effort and mild ocular discharge. On the 7 February, the lizard’s dyspnea worsened, characterized by distension of the gular pouch during respiration, persistent anorexia, and obstipation. On the 10 February, the animal presented for administration of lomustine, marbofloxacin, and methylprednisolone. Despite persistent respiratory effort, the animal remained in good body condition and gained weight (486 g). Hematological analysis confirmed similar results as before ( Table 1 Figure 2 A complete post-mortem examination was carried out within 24 h of death. The animal weighed 469 g and was in good nutritional condition (body condition score 6/9). Gross examination revealed dark discoloration of the gular skin and focal subcutaneous hemorrhage near the tail, likely related to recent venipuncture. The lungs were severely affected: the right lung was non-collapsing and filled with large volumes of clotted blood, while the left lung was partially collapsed and similarly contained clotted blood. The liver was significantly enlarged (32 g), diffusely pale, beige, with multifocal coalescing lighter yellow to white areas, and featured a focal, well-circumscribed white lesion on the capsule of the right lobe. The spleen was also markedly enlarged (33 × 12 mm), diffusely tan, and bulging on the cut surface. A small amount of blood was present in the oral cavity and stomach, whereas the intestines were largely empty or contained minimal mucoid content. All other organs appeared grossly unremarkable ( Figure 3 Histopathological examination revealed widespread infiltration of neoplastic round cells in nearly all examined tissues, as specified later. In the liver, large portions of the parenchyma were replaced by these neoplastic cells, with concurrent macrovesicular lipid accumulation observed in the remaining hepatocytes. The spleen lacked normal follicular architecture, exhibiting diffuse infiltration by the same neoplastic population and a high number of apoptotic lymphoid cells. Neoplastic cell aggregates were also found in the heart, stomach, testis, kidney (including involvement of one glomerulus), small and large intestines, and extensively within the spinal dura and adjacent musculature ( Figure 4 Immunohistochemistry on liver and spleen tissues revealed marked infiltration of CD3-positive neoplastic cells and effacement of tissue architecture. In mammals, the cytoplasmic staining with CD3 confirms a pro-T-cell lineage, as mature T-cell lineage expresses CD3 only in the cell membrane. Staining for B-cell markers CD20, CD79, and PAX5 was inconclusive or negative ( Figure 5 3. Discussion Lymphoid neoplasms are increasingly recognized in reptiles, including bearded dragons, and are often associated with non-specific hematological abnormalities that may also indicate inflammation [ 27 28 1 3 4 5 10 29 30 31 32 The present case describes a young male bearded dragon diagnosed with systemic T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which was confirmed by histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. The clinical signs were non-specific—mainly anorexia and lethargy—but progressed rapidly and eventually ended in death. Laboratory testing revealed severe leukocytosis with a predominance of lymphoblasts and elevated liver enzyme activities, which are consistent with previous reports of leukemia in P. vitticeps 5 31 4 22 23 32 33 10 Pogona vitticeps 3 34 Chemotherapy of L/L in reptiles is poorly documented. Due to species-specific metabolic and physiological differences, there are no standardised treatment protocols [ 35 36 9 19 21 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 A combination of lomustine, oral methylprednisolone, and marbofloxacin was used therapeutically in our study. This regimen was selected based on previous case reports indicating possible efficacy of lomustine and corticosteroids in reptiles with hematopoietic neoplasia [ 5 9 5 In the present case, a slight transient clinical improvement was followed by rapid deterioration and death within a few days of initiating chemotherapy. Bilateral pulmonary hemorrhage, confirmed at necropsy, was considered a probable fatal event. The underlying cause of this decline remains unclear. It may be due to chemotherapy-induced toxicity, disease progression, or a combination of both. Possible mechanisms include tumor lysis syndrome—although rarely reported in reptiles, it remains a potential risk—along with vascular fragility due to leukemic infiltration or endothelial damage induced by lomustine. Prophylactic measures such as hydration were administered at each clinic visit. Given the extensive leukemic burden observed histologically, spontaneous lung failure due to leukostasis-like mechanisms is also a plausible explanation. 4. Conclusions This case emphasizes several important points. First, cytology alone may be insufficient for the diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasms in reptiles; immunophenotyping is essential for accurate classification and prognosis. Secondly, although chemotherapy may provide a transient benefit, response to treatment is variable in reptiles, and pharmacokinetic data remain limited. Finally, the peracute terminal deterioration observed in this case highlights the limitations of current therapeutic protocols and emphasizes the need for further research into drug metabolism, dosing optimization, and supportive care in exotic species. This case illustrates the diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic challenges associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in bearded dragons. The use of immunohistochemistry was essential to confirm the T-cell lineage of the lymphoblastic neoplasm and to distinguish it from previously reported B-cell leukemias. Despite the initiation of a chemotherapeutic protocol with lomustine and methylprednisolone, the clinical course was rapidly progressive and fatal, and the treatment was not completed, emphasizing the aggressive nature of the disease and the limitations of current treatment approaches in reptiles. Systemic infiltration, including lung and meningeal involvement, contributed to multi-organ dysfunction and sudden death. This report contributes to the growing literature on hematopoietic neoplasms in reptiles and highlights the urgent need for further research on diagnostic markers, pharmacokinetics of chemotherapeutic agents, and species-specific treatment protocols.
