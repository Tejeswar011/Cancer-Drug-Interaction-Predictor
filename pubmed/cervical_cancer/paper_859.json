Background Cancer‐related fatigue (CRF) is a prevalent and multifactorial symptom that significantly impairs the quality of life in cancer patients. This study aimed to identify immune and clinical factors associated with CRF in a pan-cancer cohort and to develop a predictive model for CRF to inform personalized clinical management. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data from 146 cancer patients admitted to the Oncology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The variables collected included demographic information, disease‐related data, immunological parameters, and Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) scores. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent risk factors for CRF. A predictive model was developed, and its performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision curve analysis. Results Analysis results showed that multivariate logistic regression identified increasing age, increased absolute counts (AC) of CD4+CD38−T cells, and decreased AC of CD4+CD28−T cells as independent risk factors for CRF (P < 0.05). The predictive model demonstrated moderate performance, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.725 in the training set and 0.581 in the validation set. Conclusion These findings suggest that chronic inflammation, potentially associated with immunosenescence and immune remodeling, may contribute to the onset of CRF. Further research is needed to validate the model in large-scale, diverse patient populations and to develop targeted interventions to alleviate fatigue and improve the quality of life in cancer patients. cancer-related fatigue logistic regression analysis pan-cancer risk prediction model T-lymphocyte subsets The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Comparative studies across different cancer types are scarce, and the exploration of immune-related influencing factors remains insufficient. The primary risk factors affecting CRF in cancer patients have not been identified, thereby restricting the universality and accuracy of CRF prediction models. Consequently, identifying the key factors influencing CRF in pan-cancer patients and developing corresponding risk prediction models is of significant clinical importance. This study employs a retrospective analysis method, incorporating potential risk factors such as age, gender, marital status, family history, smoking status, alcohol consumption, clinical staging, surgical conditions, pathological status, and absolute counts of T lymphocyte subpopulations. It analyzes the impact of these factors on CRF in patients with various cancers, including breast, lung, liver, colorectal, prostate, gastric, pancreatic, and esophageal cancers. Utilizing univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, a risk prediction model for CRF was constructed, and the model’s predictive performance and calibration were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The predictive factors identified in this model are easily accessible in clinical settings, facilitating the timely identification of high-risk patients and providing new insights for formulating effective intervention strategies to mitigate CRF in cancer patients. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Research objects This study conducted a retrospective analysis of 146 cancer patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and received treatment at the Oncology Department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from March 2024 to December 2024. The patient screening process and study design are illustrated in Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Flow chart of the study. Flowchart showing the collection and analysis of oncology patients from Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, March 1, 2024 to December 1, 2024. Inclusion criteria: specific primary malignancies, aged 18 or older, three-month survival, BFI assessment, complete medical records. A total of 146 patients were analyzed, divided into a training set of 110 and a validation set of 36. The process involved variable screening, LASSO algorithm, and logistic regression analyses. A nomogram based on multivariate analysis was used for risk prediction, including calibration curve, ROC, and DCA for validation. 2.2 Inclusion criteria (those who meet the following five conditions are included) The inclusion criteria for this study are as follows: (1) Inpatients diagnosed with primary breast cancer (BC), lung cancer (LC), primary liver cancer (PLC), colorectal cancer (CRC), prostate cancer (PCa), gastric cancer (GC), pancreatic cancer (PC), or esophageal cancer (EC), or other malignancies through clinical histopathology to have any of the aforementioned cancers; (2) possession of complete medical records; (3) aged ≥18 years; (4) survival ≥3 months; and (5) completion of the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) assessment at the study time point, with fatigue severity categorized according to BFI cut-off values. Note: For the purpose of this study, fatigue status was determined exclusively based on the BFI score obtained at the assessment time point, irrespective of any prior CRF diagnosis documented in the medical records. 2.3 Exclusion criteria (excluding those who meet any of the following criteria) (1) Patients with secondary tumors or concomitant tumors; (2) Patients with severe complications, including cardiac, hepatic, renal, or hematological issues; (3) Patients with a history of psychiatric disorders or cognitive impairments. 2.4 Data collection 2.4.1 Demographic information Gender (Male/Female), Age (years), Marital status (Single/Married/Divorced/Widowed), Family history (Yes/No), Smoking history (Yes/No), Drinking history (Yes/No). 2.4.2 Clinical information Clinical Stage (0/I/II/III/IV), Surgical history (Yes/No), Treatment Methods (Radiotherapy/Chemotherapy/Immunotherapy/Targeted therapy). 2.4.3 Immunological indicators The absolute counts (AC) of the following immune cells were collected: CD3+T cells, CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, CD4 + + + + + + + + + 2.5 BFI score BFI comprises nine items, organized into two sections. The first three items evaluate the current fatigue level, the worst fatigue experienced in the past 24 h, and the usual fatigue level. The mean of these three scores constitutes the fatigue intensity score. The subsequent six items assess the impact of fatigue on various aspects, including general activities, mood, actions, daily work, relationships, and enjoyment of life, with their mean representing the fatigue impact score. The total BFI score is derived from the average of all nine items, ranging from 0 to 10; a higher score indicates a greater level of fatigue. Fatigue levels are categorized based on the total score: no fatigue (0 points), mild fatigue (1–3 points), moderate fatigue (4–6 points), and severe fatigue (7–10 points) ( Mendoza et al., 1999 Franz et al., 2019 2.6 Flow cytometry instruments and antibodies Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a 10-color BD FACS Canto Plus flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, United States; serial number U6573380-00541). Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, including CD3 + + + + + 2.7 Lymphocyte subsets enumeration and phenotyping Peripheral blood (2 mL) was collected from hospitalized patients into EDTA anticoagulant tubes, gently mixed, and immediately transported to the laboratory for flow cytometric analysis. BD Trucount™ Absolute Count tubes were prepared according to the number of samples, and each tube was labeled with a unique identifier. For Tn cell detection, 5μL each of anti-CD45, anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD62L, and anti-CD95 antibodies, together with 20μL each of anti-CD45RA and anti-CD45RO antibodies, were added to the corresponding tubes. For activated T cell detection, 5μL each of anti-CD45, anti-CD3, and anti-CD4 antibodies, together with 20μL each of anti-CD8, anti-CD38, and anti-CD28 antibodies, were added. For Treg cell detection, 5μL each of anti-CD45 and anti-CD25 antibodies, together with 20μL each of anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD127 antibodies, were added. Subsequently, 50μL of well-mixed anticoagulated whole blood was dispensed into each tube, gently mixed, and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. Thereafter, 450μL of 1×BD Multitest™ IMK Lysing Solution was added, the tubes were gently mixed, and incubation was continued under the same conditions for an additional 15min. Flow cytometric acquisition was performed using the flow cytometer, and absolute cell counts were calculated according to the following formula: Cells/μL = (acquired cells * total beads)/(acquired beads * sample volume). Cell populations were defined as follows: T cells were identified as CD3 + + + + + + + + + + + + − + + + + + − + + + + + − + + − + + − + + − −, + + - Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Gating strategies for Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets.

Several indicators, including patients’ demographic characteristics, clinical information, and absolute counts of T lymphocyte subpopulations, were used as independent variables. For variable selection, the LASSO regression was applied.

In recent years, an increasing number of studies have indicated that the occurrence of CRF is not only related to psychosocial factors ( Brownstein et al., 2022 Xin et al., 2023 Gu et al., 2024 Zhang et al., 2024 + − + − Age, as an independent risk factor influencing CRF, has been widely confirmed across various types of cancer. Elderly patients are more susceptible to CRF than their younger counterparts due to factors such as declining immune function ( Lewis et al., 2022 Arzu and Özlem, 2021 Tacara et al., 2022 Pergolotti et al., 2020 Ee et al., 2024 This study further revealed that alterations in CD4 + + − + − + Speiser et al., 2023 Dipalma and Blattman, 2023 Ye et al., 2023 Marija et al., 2022 + − Luis et al., 2022 Hammer et al., 2021 + − Pérez-Lara et al., 2021 Camacho-Pereira et al., 2016 Dang et al., 2023 Zeidler et al., 2022 + − + − Inflammation is widely recognized as a key mechanism underlying CRF ( García-González et al., 2025 Schmidt et al., 2024 Van Roekel et al., 2023 Zhang and Perry, 2024 Wei et al., 2023 Additionally, immune-related signaling pathways play a significant role in the development of CRF. Type I interferon signaling can induce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and is closely associated with an increase in monocytes ( Bower et al., 2024 Zhang et al., 2021 García-González et al., 2024 Sun et al., 2025 Wu et al., 2023 Despite identifying several important factors influencing CRF and constructing a preliminary predictive model, this study has certain limitations. First, the overall sample size was relatively small, particularly in the validation cohort, which may have reduced the statistical power to detect weaker associations and, to some extent, affected the model’s predictive performance. Second, as a single-center retrospective study, it is subject to the risk of selection bias, and the temporal or causal relationships between predictors and CRF cannot be definitively established; moreover, the study population may not be fully representative of the broader cancer patient population. In addition, the decrease in AUC from the training set (0.725) to the validation set (0.581) suggests a potential risk of overfitting, which may limit the model’s predictive performance in real-world clinical settings. Due to the retrospective and single-center nature of this study, external validation could not be conducted. Future studies should aim to validate the model using independent, multicenter datasets and prospective cohorts to comprehensively assess its robustness and enhance its generalizability. Third, although demographic characteristics, disease-related variables, and T cell subset indicators were included, several other established determinants of CRF—such as anemia, treatment type and intensity, comorbidities, inflammatory cytokine levels, immune checkpoint molecule expression, sleep quality, and psychosocial factors including depression and anxiety—were not comprehensively assessed due to incomplete or unavailable data. The omission of these variables may have introduced potential confounding factors, thereby limiting a full representation of the multifactorial nature of CRF. Fourth, the study primarily focused on immunological parameters, which, although providing novel insights into the potential role of immunosenescence, do not capture the full biopsychosocial complexity of CRF pathogenesis. Finally, the current model is mainly based on clinical and immunological variables and lacks integration with multi-omics data such as metabolomics and transcriptomics, thereby constraining an in-depth elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of CRF. Future prospective multicenter studies with larger and more diverse cohorts, incorporating a broader range of biological, clinical, and psychosocial parameters, are warranted to refine predictive models, enhance their generalizability, and support the development of personalized, mechanism-based interventions for CRF. 5 Conclusion This study identified increased age, reduced absolute counts of CD4 + − + − The authors thank the Open Research Project of the National Clinical Research Center for Acupuncture and Moxibustion (NCRCOP2024018) and the Independent Research Project of the First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (JYTC2025015).
