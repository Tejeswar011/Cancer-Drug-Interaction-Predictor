This condition is significantly associated with the development of cardiovascular disease, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may be crucial in initiating vascular calcification by regulating a network of specific cellular targets. In this study, we explored for the first time the potential role of microRNA-26b (miR-26b) in vascular calcification. Methods and results Using micro-positron emission tomography and computed tomography (micro-PET/CT) imaging with 18 Smad1 SMAD1 Conclusion The deficiency of miR-26b is crucial for initiating and promoting aortic calcification, revealing new therapeutic targets for aortic disease.

Introduction Vascular calcification (VC) results from a pathological deposition of calcium phosphate minerals in soft tissues. 1 2 3 4 5 18 18 6 7 18 8 9 VC is a cell-mediated process, and the acquisition of an osteoblast-like phenotype by healthy vascular cells in response to pro-calcific signals is central to the pathogenesis of this disease. 10 10 11 12 13 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded non-coding RNAs comprising ∼22 nucleotides. They act as post-transcriptional repressors by targeting the 3′-untranslated region of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in >60% of human genes. 14 15 16 17 The miR-26 family has recently been associated with cardiovascular disease and pathological angiogenesis. 18 18 19 19 2. Methods Detailed procedures are described in the Supplementary Materials 2.1 Human samples This study complies with the ethical principles recorded in the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and later amendments. Specimens of ascending aortic tissues were obtained from patients diagnosed with severe aortic valve disease (e.g. aortic regurgitation or aortic stenosis) and aortopathy elective of concomitant surgical aortic valve and aorta replacement (e.g. Bentall procedure) as well as patients with lone aortopathy elective for valve-sparing aortic root replacement (e.g. David procedure) at Hospital Universitario de Navarra, Spain. The study was covered by the Research Ethics Committee approval (Pyto. 2013/26, num 137) in agreement with the Spanish law (BPCCPMP/ICH/135/95). The clinical and demographic characteristics of the enrolled patients are described in Supplementary material online Table S1 9 2.2 Murine models and in vivo All experiments involving mice were performed following guidance and operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (2014) with prior approval of the UK Home Office (PP3528002) and the University of Edinburgh Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board. The results were reported following the ARRIVE guidelines.

Aortas were cleaned from periaortic fat, adventitia was separated mechanically from media, and the obtained layers were placed separately into an enzyme solution (Collagenase II, Elastase, Soybean Trypsin Inhibitor in HBSS with calcium and magnesium) for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO 2 2.4 RNA isolation, RT, and qPCR Total RNA was isolated using Qiazol reagent and miRNeasy miniKit (217004, QIAGEN), and reverse-transcribed into single-stranded cDNA, using an iScript Advanced cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad) for mRNA analyses. Downstream qPCR amplification was performed using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad) using primers at 300 mM final concentration. The validated primers are commercially available from Sigma (KICqStartTM Primers).

The aorta was dissected from surrounding tissue, and the perivascular fat was removed. Aortas were incubated with 103–127 kBq/mL 18 2.6 Immunohistochemistry and miR-26b in situ DAB staining for SMAD1 (pSMAD1/5, Invitrogen #700047) was performed using the Leica Bond III autostainer (Leica Biosystems, USA) and Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit (DS9800, Leica Biosystems, USA).

Equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto SDS–polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were then blocked with Intercept (TBS) Blocking Buffer with Tween 20 at 0.2% and immunoblotted overnight at 4°C with the following primary antibodies (1:1000): phospho-SMAD1 (Ser463/465) (41D10) (CST, #9516), total SMAD1 (Proteintech, 66559-1-Ig), and β-actin (Sigma, A5441). Secondary antibodies (1:15,000): IRDye® 680RD anti-Mouse IgG (926-68070) and IRDye® 800CW anti-Rabbit IgG (926-3221) were incubated for 1 h at RT.

It is characterized by a complicated signalling process in which multiple pathways and cell types are involved during various stages of the disease. By integrating single-cell transcriptomics and networking analysis with molecular imaging, we have demonstrated that deletion of miR-26b in mice resulted in spontaneous and age-related aortic microcalcifications by dysregulating cell-specific target genes and cell–cell communication between aortic cells. miRNAs interact with their target genes’ 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) to induce mRNA degradation or translational repression. The interaction is dynamic and dependent on many factors, such as the abundance of miRNAs and target mRNAs, as well as the affinity of miRNA–mRNA interactions. miRNA suppression of mRNA targets is not ubiquitous between cell types. Alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation affect 3′ UTRs, and cell-type-specific RNA binding proteins may change the miRNA response elements in the target genes, thus making mRNAs sensitive or insensitive to miRNA-mediated gene regulation in a cell-type-specific manner. 41 42 43 Differences in targeting approaches in miRNA KO mice, such as lengths of deleted sequences, can also explain the different phenotypes and target GEX. Recent studies using miR-26 family KO mice (CRISPR/Cas9-generated) have shown that only mice lacking all three copies of miR-26 (miR-26a, miR-26a-2, and miR-26b) developed a pathological phenotype, such as an increase in white adipose tissue 44 20 45 Cell cross-talk remains controversial but is a critical aspect in understanding vascular calcification. 46 16 47 48 Microcalcification in miR-26bKO mice was reversible, thus confirming that the early stages of the calcification process represent a potential therapeutic window for pharmacological intervention. With mechanistic insights, therapeutic strategies could be created to target the processes that initiate vascular calcification. In this study, LDN-193189 was used as a lead compound to interfere with the SMC-FBL cross-talk. This compound specifically inhibits BMP receptor-dependent phosphorylation of SMAD1/5/8 while mainly sparing the phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 by the activin and TGF-β receptors. 49 50 Limitation: It is essential to acknowledge the limitations of our current work. While our study provides valuable insights into the role of miR-26b in vascular calcification, our animal model only represents the early stages of the disease, not the entire spectrum of aortopathy. Additionally, the 6-month follow-up period may not have been sufficient to observe the long-term chronic effect of miR-26b deletion on the vascular calcification process, which is clinically associated with ageing and other cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, this study focuses on the cross-talk signalling between FBLs and SMCs, although other potential signalling pathways, such as those involving ECs and immune cells, could be involved. Nevertheless, our mouse model offers a platform for developing additional studies by including relevant cardiovascular risk factors. In conclusion, this investigation has demonstrated the contribution of miR-26b in initiating vascular calcification. Integrating transcriptomics, molecular imaging, and network analysis, we created a complete gene-to-pathway understanding of the FBL-SMC cross-talk leading to SMC calcification. Using samples from patients with vascular disease, we demonstrated that similar processes mediated by miR-26b downregulation potentially operate in conditions where vascular calcification is a common pathological feature associated with poor prognosis and severity. Therefore, these findings reveal critical mechanisms in regulating calcification initiation in vivo Supplementary Material cvaf117_Supplementary_Data Acknowledgements The following facilities were used at the Institute of Regeneration and Repair (IRR) at the University of Edinburgh: IRR Imaging with microscopy; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting, and single-cell multi-omics facilities.
