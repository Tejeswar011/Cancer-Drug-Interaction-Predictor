We analyze key findings from the recent literature that have expanded our understanding of how 3D tumor models can better predict response to therapies compared to traditional 2D cultures. We explore how different 3D tumor models capture different aspects of drug resistance and compare their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss how state-of-the-art 3D tumor models, characterized in recent research, can improve the predictive accuracy of cancer therapies in preclinical testing, ultimately leading to more effective cancer treatments. 2 Why 3D Tumor Models Are Essential for Translating Drug Resistance Research into Clinical Applications A major challenge in cancer treatment is the failure of drugs in human trials, despite promising preclinical results. This failure is often due to the lack of predictive accuracy of 2D models. However, 3D tumor models offer a more realistic system that can better predict the behavior of tumors in patients [ 21 22 One of the most promising applications of 3D tumor models is in the field of personalized medicine. Using models such as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and organoids, researchers can grow tumor cultures directly from patient biopsies [ 23 24 In the clinical setting, a combination of different drugs can be used in cancer treatment to overcome resistance mechanisms [ 25 26 As clinical trials become increasingly expensive and time-consuming, 3D tumor models offer a scalable alternative to traditional preclinical models, enabling prioritization of drug candidates and accelerating drug development [ 22 27 Cancer evolves in response to therapeutic pressure, and conventional 2D cultures offer limited insight into tumor adaptation because they cannot reproduce in vivo 28 While 3D models offer a powerful improvement over traditional 2D cultures, especially in mimicking the tumor microenvironment and cellular behavior, they are not without limitations. Many 3D platforms still fall short in capturing systemic processes such as innervation, hormonal regulation, immune surveillance, and whole-body drug metabolism [ 29 30 31 30 in vivo 3 Mechanisms of Drug Resistance in 3D Tumor Models In 3D tumor models, cancer cells exhibit a variety of resistance mechanisms driven by the unique architecture and microenvironment of the tumor ( Fig. 1 Figure 1 Mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer. Three-dimensional cancer models mimic different mechanisms of drug resistance including ( a b c d e smart.servier.com 3.1 Hypoxia-Induced Resistance Hypoxia is a hallmark of cancer and a critical feature of the TME, especially in the core of solid tumors [ 32 33 34 Fig. 1a Table 1 35 36 38 Table 1 Investigating drug resistance mechanisms using three-dimensional (3D) models Mechanisms of drug resistance Overview Suitable 3D models References  Hypoxia Tumor microenvironment with low oxygen Spheroids: [ 46 49 55 57 64 Promotes therapy-resistant cell populations Organoids: Contributes to poor prognosis and recurrence Xenografts: in vivo Tumor-on-a-chip:  Tumor heterogeneity Different cell populations within a tumor Spheroids: [ 81 82 95 96 98 100 119 Arises from genetic, epigenetic, and microenvironment changes Organoids: Xenografts: in vivo in vitro Important in tumor progression and drug resistance 3D bioprinted models:  Cancer stem cells (CSCs) Stem-like properties: self-renewal, differentiation Spheroids: [ 116 118 120 Organoids: Found in regions with poor drug penetration Xenografts: in vivo Associated with therapy resistance and aggressive phenotypes 3D bioprinted models  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) Increases cancer cell aggressiveness Spheroids: [ 121 122 125 130 Makes cells more resistant to therapy Organoids: Tumor-on-a-chip: Xenografts: in vivo 3D bioprinted models:  Cell-Extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions Cell-ECM interactions support tumor survival, ECM remodeling and secretion of factors that activate survival pathways Spheroids: Organoids: [ 77 136 139 142 148 Xenografts: in vivo 3D bioprinted models:  Metabolic reprogramming Metabolic reprogramming (e.g., increased glycolysis) enhances cancer cell survival and resistance Spheroids: [ 162 164 166 167 Organoids: Tumor-on-a-chip: Xenografts: 3D bioprinted models:  Drug efflux pumps Drug efflux pumps reduce drug efficacy by pumping out therapeutic agents from cancer cells Spheroids: [ 156 158 160 Organoids: Tumor-on-a-chip: Xenografts: in vivo 3D bioprinted models: Hypoxia is present in approximately 90% of solid tumors [ 32 39 Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are master regulators of cellular response to hypoxia eliciting downstream signaling that regulates angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion/metastasis, cancer-specific metabolism, immune escape, and cancer stem cell maintenance [ 40 41 42 43 44 45 3D cell models enable more relevance in studying tumor hypoxia than 2D cell models as they can mimic formation of hypoxic zones more accurately [ 46 48 49 HIF-1α is the primary regulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a major regulatory cytokine that promotes blood vessel formation in solid tumors [ 50 51 52 in vivo in vitro 53 54 Hypoxia is a major contributor to therapy resistance in cancer which has also been demonstrated by the use of 3D tumor models. Larger spheroids of triple negative breast cancer cells containing hypoxic core showed significant resistance to doxorubicin and cisplatin treatments as well as high expression of cancer stem cell marker cluster of differentiation 133 (CD133), compared to smaller spheroids without hypoxia [ 55 56 57 Hypoxia promotes therapy resistance by different mechanisms, including impaired DNA damage response, altered cellular metabolism and promotion of therapy resistant cell populations. It disrupts DNA damage response in tumors, leading to DNA damage and increased replication stress, contributing to genomic instability [ 58 60 61 62 63 63 65 Hypoxia, through HIF-1α, can also promote therapy resistance by increasing the expression of drug efflux pumps, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) that remove chemotherapeutic agents from cells, reducing their efficacy [ 66 67 68 69 68 70 71 72 74 3.2 Tumor Heterogeneity and Spatial Drug Exposure Tumor heterogeneity is another hallmark of cancer and refers to the existence of diverse cell populations with distinct genetic and phenotypic traits within a single tumor (intratumor heterogeneity) or between tumors of the same type in different patients (intertumor heterogeneity) ( Fig. 1b 75 76 2 77 79 Three-dimensional tumor models recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity of tumors and their dynamics more effectively than 2D models and enable the study of key features of solid tumors such as spatial drug exposure, metabolic gradients, and cell-cell interactions [ 80 82 83 84 85 86 88 89 90 In tumor tissue, drugs diffuse through layers of cells, forming concentration gradients that influence the response to treatment and its effectiveness [ 91 92 93 94 In vivo 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 Spatial drug gradient leads to the selective survival of drug-resistant populations deeper within the tumor. Within these deeper regions, a minor subset of cells known as drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) can avoid drug-induced cell death by adopting apoptosis-resistant state [ 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 104 in vitro 110 111 63 112 Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are another cell population enriched in 3D models, often located in regions with poor drug penetration, such as hypoxic areas [ 113 114 115 116 117 118 100 119 120 3.3 EMT and Invasiveness Cancer cells undergoing EMT are often more aggressive and invasive, making them more likely to spread to other parts of the body ( Fig. 1c EMT is a central process in cancer in which epithelial cells lose their polarity and adhesion and acquire mesenchymal properties such as motility and invasiveness. EMT is responsible for tumor progression, metastasis and resistance to therapy. In contrast to 2D models, 3D tumor models—such as spheroids, organoids and microfluidic systems—can better replicate the complexity of EMT and its role in drug resistance by mimicking tumor architecture, hypoxic gradients and selective pressure. These models improve cell-ECM interactions and alter EMT-related gene expression and resistance mechanisms [ 121 122 121 121 EMT activates survival pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), enabling resistance to therapy [ 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 EMT is also linked to an increase in stem cell-like characteristics in tumor cells. CSCs, characterized by their ability to self-renew and differentiate, exhibit increased resistance to therapy, making them an important target to overcome drug resistance in 3D tumor models [ 132 133 128 134 135 136 137 138 139 3.4 ECM and Cell-ECM Interactions The ECM, composed of proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, and elastin, regulates the behavior and resistance of tumors ( Fig. 1d 140 141 142 The ECM interacts with receptors such as integrins and CD44, activating survival pathways that lead to resistance [ 143 144 145 77 146 In the TME, fibroblasts can differentiate into cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which promote ECM remodeling and tumor progression. CAFs can secrete factors such as TGF-β and IL-6 that promote cell survival and drug resistance [ 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 3.5 Altered Drug Efflux and Metabolism Another important mechanism of drug resistance in 3D tumor models is altered drug metabolism and transport ( Fig. 1e Efflux pumps actively transport chemotherapeutics out of cancer cells, reducing intracellular drug concentration and efficacy. In 3D tumor models, key transporters such as P-gp, MRP1, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are frequently upregulated, contributing to chemoresistance [ 156 157 158 159 160 161 Cancer cells often undergo metabolic reprogramming to support their rapid growth and survival. In 3D cultures, this reprogramming is more pronounced, as tumor cells may shift to aerobic glycolysis or alter their mitochondrial function, which can contribute to resistance to treatments that target cellular metabolism or oxidative stress. Several studies have used 3D models to investigate metabolic reprogramming in cancer, highlighting the role of different metabolic pathways in resistance formation. Spheroids of colorectal and pancreatic cancer cells exhibited altered glucose metabolism compared to 2D cultures, with increased ATP production and metabolic shifts under nutrient stress [ 162 163 164 165 166 in situ 167 An overview of drug resistance mechanisms and 3D models suitable for studying these mechanisms is presented in Table 1 4 Types of 3D Tumor Models and Their Role in Understanding and Targeting Drug Resistance 4.1 Spheroid Models Spheroids are among the most widely used 3D tumor models ( Fig. 2 168 168 Figure 2 Schematic overview of key 3D cancer models applied in drug resistance studies. Illustrated models include organoids, xenografts, spheroids, tumor-on-a-chip platforms, 3D bioprinted tumors, and scaffold-based systems. Each model is accompanied by its main advantages and limitations in terms of complexity, scalability, physiological relevance, and clinical translatability. This figure was created using images adapted from Servier Medical Art (Servier, smart.servier.com Spheroids are particularly effective for investigating drug resistance mechanisms, as they closely mimic the TME, including drug penetration barriers, intra-tumor gradients, and cellular heterogeneity. Unlike traditional 2D models, spheroids recreate conditions that contribute to therapy failure, making them an essential tool for optimizing treatment strategies and identifying new drug resistance mechanisms. These advantages have led to a growing body of recent research exploring spheroids as a more accurate model for studying cancer therapies and resistance. Martinez-Bernabe et al. demonstrated that breast and colon cancer spheroids closely mimic in vivo 169 170 171 Spheroids also mimic the variability of drug exposure in tumors. In ovarian cancer, A2780 spheroids (drug-sensitive and drug-resistant) showed higher resistance to cisplatin and paclitaxel than monolayers due to changes in drug resistance gene expression, extracellular matrix proteins, cell density, and drug diffusion limitations. A moderate increase in cisplatin resistance and a significant increase in paclitaxel resistance were observed in spheroids. These results show how important it is to consider drug penetration and cell dynamics when developing chemotherapies [ 172 173 While most studies use single-cell type spheroids, heterogeneous spheroids with multiple cell types are becoming increasingly popular to better mimic the heterogeneity and physiology of tumors in vivo 174 175 One of the key features of spheroid models is that they can simulate drug penetration through tumor layers, especially in hypoxic regions that contribute to chemoresistance. Many chemotherapies do not reach the tumor core, leaving the inner cells unaffected, which promotes resistance. Spheroids can help analyze drug distribution across tumor regions and develop therapeutic strategies to improve penetration and efficacy. A recent study compared the response to 21 drug combinations in 2D and spheroid cultures of HCT 116, HT-29 and SW-620 cells. The results showed that spheroids were generally more sensitive and exhibited stronger synergistic effects, particularly with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor combinations, highlighting the advantage of using spheroids for more accurate drug discovery [ 176 Heterogeneous spheroids containing both cancer cells and CAFs are widely used in drug discovery. These models allow a deeper understanding of tumor-stroma interactions and their role in chemoresistance. For example, the therapeutic potential of the small molecule MSI-N1014 was recently investigated with spheroids composed of DLD1 and HCT116 colon cancer cells cultured with fibroblasts transformed into CAFs. MSI-N1014 effectively reduced CAF transformation and increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to 5-FU [ 177 178 Spheroids also serve as an effective platform for testing hypoxia-targeting agents and nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems designed to improve drug efficacy in poorly accessible tumor regions. For instance, Fan et al. explored a novel treatment approach by co-targeting CSCs via the ZIP4-HDAC4 axis and non-CSCs using cisplatin for high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) therapy. They found that ZIP4 induces the sensitization of ovarian cancer cells to histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Using a 3D in vitro 179 2 2 180 Nanoparticle-based therapeutics have gained significant attention in recent years, but many promising candidates fail in clinical trials due to limitations of 2D models. In contrast, spheroids offer a more physiologically relevant environment, enabling better predictions of therapeutic effects, assessing nanotoxicity in tumor-like systems. In addition to assessing nanotoxicity, spheroids also serve as valuable models for studying biological barriers. They better reflect cell metabolism, gene expression and signaling pathways, making them useful not only for assessing toxicity but also for evaluating the efficiency of nanoparticle delivery [ 181 Spheroids offer advantages such as relevance to tumor biology, cost-effectiveness, reproducibility and compatibility with high-throughput screening and advanced imaging. However, their avascular nature can interfere with cellular processes, affecting the accuracy of drug response, and size variability leads to inconsistent data. In addition, the challenges of evaluating drugs, the difficulty of analyzing single-cell response, and the poor replication of cancer-ECM interactions make standardization difficult, while obtaining cells for molecular analysis remains challenging. While certain spheroid models incorporate stromal components, many lack immune system integration and show variability in cellular composition. Their limited scalability and standardization can also hinder reproducibility and cross-study comparisons. 4.2 Organoid Models Organoids are 3D structures derived from patient tumor samples or stem cells. They self-organize into tissue-like forms while retaining the genetic heterogeneity and complexity of the tumor ( Fig. 2 Tumor organoids represent human tumors more accurately than spheroids and preserve genetic diversity, stromal interactions and immune responses [ 182 182 183 184 185 PDOs play a key role in personalized cancer treatment, as they allow clinicians to test how a specific patient’s tumor responds to different drugs. Beyond their growing role in functional precision oncology, PDOs are increasingly recognized as clinically relevant preclinical models with expanding regulatory and translational potential. They are being explored in prospective clinical study settings, where PDOs are tested alongside clinical treatments to inform therapeutic decisions in real time [ 186 187 188 189 PDOs are used in both research and drug testing, with different methods required to produce different cancer organoids. Driehuis et al. provided an overview of the techniques used to produce cancer organoids from patients and the protocols used to test the therapeutic effect [ 190 186 191 192 193 Recently, Tan et al. screened 419 FDA-approved drugs using liver cancer organoids and identified desloratadine, an antiallergic drug, as a potential anticancer agent [ 194 195 196 197 Although organoids mimic important features of tumors, they often cannot fully mimic the vasculature and fluid dynamics that influence drug delivery and resistance in vivo 4.3 Tumor-on-a-Chip Models Tumor-on-a-chip systems, pioneered by Ingber and colleagues in 2010 with the introduction of the lung-on-a-chip model [ 198 Fig. 2 199 These models excel in simulating drug delivery dynamics, allowing researchers to study how drugs interact with tumor cells in real-time. This is crucial for understanding resistance mechanisms related to drug efflux, tumor heterogeneity, and the formation of vascular barriers, all of which limit drug efficacy. For instance, Komen et al. developed a colorectal cancer-on-a-chip system with a drug-dosing channel for controlled drug delivery. Their study with oxaliplatin showed a dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth, with continuous drug administration proving more effective than a single high-dose treatment [ 200 ®® 201 To further explore tumor heterogeneity, a microfluidic device was designed to replicate intratumoral heterogeneity in PDAC by culturing cell lines with different genotypes and phenotypes. It was found that resistance to gemcitabine was higher in 3D co-cultures than in 2D monolayers, emphasizing the role of cell-cell interactions in drug resistance [ 202 203 Another critical application of tumor-on-a-chip models is studying the role of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and metastasis in drug resistance. A BBB model examining metastasis of lung, breast and melanoma cancer showed that astrocytes in the BBB modulate permeability and thus influence drug efficacy. Temozolomide was effective both in the presence and absence of a barrier and induced apoptosis in 77% of glioblastoma cells. Cisplatin and carboplatin were only effective in the absence of the BBB, while ifosfamide had no effect [ 204 205 207 Recent findings highlighted the need for more relevant in vitro 208 Tumors interact closely with their surrounding vasculature, which plays a critical role in drug delivery and resistance. Several tumor-on-a-chip platforms have been developed to study these interactions. One of the strengths of tumor-on-a-chip models is their ability to include stromal cells (e.g., fibroblasts, endothelial cells) and immune cells, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of how TME contributes to drug resistance. Wang et al. constructed a microfluidic chip that simulates the tumor-vascular microenvironment by co-culturing hepatic and breast tumor cell lines with endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Their study revealed that, after the drug treatment, cancer cell viability increased when cultured with endothelial cells and fibroblasts, highlighting the impact of the TME on drug resistance [ 209 210 in vivo 211 212 Using tumor-on-a-chip method, researchers can explore how stromal cells promote resistance through ECM remodeling, or how tumor-associated macrophages influence immune evasion and support tumor survival. By simulating immune-related resistance mechanisms, these systems are invaluable for developing therapies that target the TME or enhance the immune response against resistant tumors. For example, resistance to irreversible EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC is closely linked to EMT and driven by the TME. Using a multicellular lung-on-a-chip model, co-culturing human NSCLC cell line HCC827, human fetal lung fibroblasts HFL-1, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs, researchers demonstrated that IL-6-mediated fibroblast activation and EMT contribute to osimertinib resistance, which can be partially reversed by IL-6 inhibition with tocilizumab. This microfluidic platform replicates the complex tumor-stroma interactions, offering a valuable tool for studying drug resistance mechanisms and optimizing personalized therapeutic strategies [ 213 214 Despite advances, tumor-on-a-chip models face challenges such as standardization, scalability and the difficulty of replicating systemic in vivo 198 215 216 ® 217 219 ® 220 221 4.4 Xenograft Models Xenograft models represent a critical in vivo Fig. 2 222 224 Cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) models are established by implanting human cancer cell lines into immunocompromised mice. These models have been widely used for decades to study tumor biology and evaluate novel anticancer drugs. However, one limitation of CDX models is that they do not fully recapitulate the heterogeneity of patient tumors, as they are derived from long-established cell lines with altered genetic and phenotypic properties due to prolonged in vitro 225 226 223 224 227 224 228 229 230 231 224 Xenograft models provide an essential tool for investigating how tumors acquire drug resistance and adapt to therapy over time. By exposing xenografted tumors to various chemotherapeutic agents, researchers can assess mechanisms of resistance, such as enhanced drug efflux, activation of survival pathways, and alterations in the TME. For instance, in breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)-methylated PDX tumors, a resistance mechanism was found where gene fusions repositioned BRCA1 under a different promoter, allowing re-expression despite promoter hypermethylation [ 232 233 234 235 236 236 237 238 PDX models have gained prominence as a translational tool for personalized medicine [ 224 239 228 240 in vitro 240 To support preclinical cancer treatment testing, the U.S. and Europe established two multi-center pan-cancer PDX consortia, PDXNet and EurOPDX [ 229 241 242 243 244 245 Despite their numerous advantages, xenograft models are not without limitations. One key challenge is the lack of a fully functional immune system in traditional xenografts, which limits their ability to model immune-tumor interactions accurately. Humanized xenograft models help address this issue but are costly and complex to establish. Another limitation is the potential for genetic and epigenetic drift in PDX models over multiple passages, which may affect their ability to faithfully replicate the original tumor’s behavior. They are also expensive, low-throughput, and have long establishment times, limiting rapid translational application. Standardization of PDX generation and characterization is crucial to ensuring reproducibility and reliability in preclinical research. Future advancements in xenograft models may involve more refined humanized models with enhanced immune system functionality, further improving their translational value. 4.5 Scaffold-Based 3D Models Scaffold-based 3D cell cultures have become an important tool in cancer research, especially in the investigation of drug resistance mechanisms. This 3D organization plays a critical role in understanding how cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy, targeted therapies and immunotherapies [ 246 in vivo Fig. 2 137 247 in vivo Scaffolds can be made from either natural or synthetic materials. Natural scaffolds can be made from mammalian ECM biomolecules such as hyaluronic acid, collagen, fibrinogen or Evan basement membrane extracts, but also from natural non-mammalian polymers such as alginate and chitosan [ 248 249 250 251 252 253 A noteworthy example of a natural scaffold-based model is a multicellular 3D heterospheroid tumor system developed in a collagen hydrogel culture. By encapsulating liver cancer heterospheroids cultured together with stromal fibroblasts in a collagen gel, the model mimics the ECM barrier, a key factor influencing drug resistance. Tumors grown in this collagen-based 3D system show greater resistance to anticancer drugs than conventional 2D monolayers and homospheroid cultures [ 254 255 in vivo 21 256 In addition to ECM biomolecules, non-mammalian natural polymers such as alginate and chitosan are also frequently used in scaffold-based 3D cell cultures. Alginate, a polysaccharide derived from brown algae, is a highly biocompatible and easily gel-forming material that provides a hydrated environment ideal for cell encapsulation. It provides a physiologically relevant environment for tumor cell cultures and allows researchers to study the mechanisms of drug resistance more effectively than in conventional 2D models [ 248 72 257 in vivo 258 Chitosan, a biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide, has shown promise as a scaffold material for 3D cancer models, especially for drug resistance research. Its porous structure, its ability to support cell adhesion, and its ability to mimic the ECM make it an effective platform for studying tumor-stroma interactions and therapy resistance [ 249 259 in vivo 260 Synthetic polymers have gained a lot of attention in 3D cell culture and tissue engineering due to their adaptability, reproducibility and mechanical stability. Depending on the research application, scaffolds based on synthetic polymers can be customized to support cell growth, mimic the properties of the extracellular matrix, and have adjustable degradation rates, making them versatile tools in biomedical research [ 261 252 262 251 PLGA scaffolds, which are known for their biocompatibility and biodegradability, have great potential for preclinical drug testing. For example, PLGA/β-TCP scaffolds in perfusion bioreactors simulate mechanically stimulated tumor growth and drug resistance to liposomal doxorubicin, which is very similar to in vivo 250 263 264 253 265 Although scaffold-based models offer more in vivo in vivo 4.6 3D Bioprinted Tumor Models Three-dimensional bioprinted tumor models are a powerful tool for studying drug resistance. These models can overcome some of the limitations of conventional scaffold-based systems, such as poor reproducibility and lack of accurate tissue organization. Researchers can manipulate the layers of cells and the surrounding matrix to mimic the tumor’s heterogeneous structure, exploring how these features influence drug penetration and treatment outcomes ( Fig. 2 266 The precision of 3D bioprinting enables the creation of highly individualized tumor models that are ideal for drug delivery studies. These models can replicate the tumor architecture and ECM, which is important for understanding how drugs penetrate the tumor and how resistance develops in different regions. Targeted therapies can be tested in these models to evaluate their efficacy in overcoming spatial barriers to drug penetration, such as the tumor stroma or hypoxic cores. In glioblastoma models, researchers used bioprinted constructs with glioblastoma stem cells, astrocytes, neural precursor cells, and macrophages within a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel. These models reflected molecular characteristics seen in patient tumors and supported the study of drug sensitivity, cell communication, and immune cell interactions [ 267 268 269 Drug resistance has also been observed in a 3D bioprinted cervical cancer model [ 270 Bioprinting has also been used to produce patient-specific HCC models. In a study by Xie et al., tumor cells from HCC patients were mixed with gelatin and alginate to produce bioinks for printing. The resulting 3D structures were shown to have no tumor markers or genetic profiles. These models were stable in long-term cultures and were used for personalized drug screening, demonstrating that 3D bioprinting can be used in personalized medicine [ 271 272 In breast cancer models, different bioprinted tissue structures showed different levels of resistance [ 273 Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma models using patient-derived cells also showed features associated with drug resistance, such as stem cell marker expression and high proliferation [ 274 in vitro 275 Generally, 3D bioprinted tumor models are a useful tool for studying drug resistance. They allow researchers to control the tumor structure and environment, test patient-specific responses, and study the influence of various factors such as hypoxia, immune cells, and ECM composition. These systems can help improve preclinical testing and support the development of more effective cancer therapies. However, the technology also faces challenges, such as the inability to fully replicate the complex vascular network and immunological microenvironment, both of which are critical to understanding drug resistance in vivo 276 277 278 277 279 280 281 282 283 in vivo Table 2 Table 2 Comparison of 3D model types in drug resistance research and drug development 3D model type Key features Applications Advantages Limitations References  Spheroids Mimic avascular or poorly vascularized tumors Investigating mechanisms of drug resistance Closely mimic the tumor microenvironment (TME), including drug penetration barriers, intra-tumor gradients, and cellular heterogeneity Avascular structure may interfere with drug response [ 169 172 173 176 181  Organoids Retain genetic and epigenetic characteristics of primary tumors Drug screening Biomarker identification Accurately represent human tumors Limited vasculature [ 183 186 190 194  Tumor-on-a-chip models Suitable for studying drug transport Studying blood-brain barrier in drug resistance Simulation of complex interactions in a controlled environment Challenges in replicating solid tumor complexity [ 199 202 204 214 Immune cell infiltration Stromal cell contribution to resistance ECM and immune influences on tumor behavior Involvement of stromal and immune cells Biological accuracy issues  Xenograft models Enable in vivo Preclinical research for targeted therapies Preserves tumor heterogeneity (especially patient-derived xenografts (PDXs)) in vitro Absence of fully functional immune system [ 224 232 239  Scaffold-based 3D models Mimics in vivo Develop drug delivery systems Closely mimics in vivo Cannot fully replicate TME complexities [ 21 72 248 265  3D bioprinted tumor models Precisely recreates TME by manipulating cell arrangement and extracellular matrix Ideal for drug delivery studies Mimics patient-specific tumor architecture Cannot fully replicate complex vascular and immune environments [ 267 276 5 Conclusion: Tailoring 3D Model Types to Therapeutic Strategies In cancer research and drug resistance studies, 3D tumor models have greatly improved our understanding of the complex TME and its role in drug resistance. These models, including spheroids, organoids, xenografts, tumor-on-a-chip, scaffold-based systems and 3D bioprinted models, provide valuable platforms to study the molecular mechanisms behind chemoresistance and evaluate therapeutic strategies with greater accuracy than traditional 2D cultures. Spheroids and organoids have the advantage of mimicking tumor growth in vivo in vivo in vivo Although these models offer unique advantages, they also present challenges. Spheroids and organoids, while useful, cannot fully replicate the complexity of the TME, particularly with regard to vasculature and immune cell interactions. Xenografts are more complex and costly and require animal models. Tumor-on-a-chip systems offer high adaptability but cannot fully represent the complexity of solid tumors. Scaffold-based models can have issues with material variability and scalability, while 3D bioprinted models are highly accurate but expensive and require advanced technologies. Ultimately, the selection of a 3D model should be guided by the specific research questions, the type of cancer under investigation and the therapeutic approach to be explored. When researching drug resistance, it is particularly important to match the choice of 3D models to the therapeutic strategy. Spheroids are valuable for studying gradients that drive resistance in solid tumors, while PDOs capture tumor heterogeneity and individual resistance mechanisms. Xenografts validate resistance pathways and therapies in vivo A combination of these models could provide the most comprehensive understanding of cancer drug resistance mechanisms and the opportunity to test and develop more effective treatments. The integration of patient-specific models such as bioprinting and personalized cancer organoids promises to revolutionize cancer treatment by predicting individual response, improving preclinical accuracy, reducing clinical trial failures and advancing personalized therapies. Through their advancement, these model systems can accelerate the development of targeted cancer therapies and overcome drug resistance in clinical oncology. Beyond model selection and integration, several broader challenges and opportunities must be considered to enhance the translational impact of 3D tumor models. One major obstacle in cancer treatment is the limited efficacy of drug delivery, especially in solid tumors with dense extracellular matrix components, abnormal vasculature, and hypoxic regions. These factors often restrict drug penetration and lead to heterogeneous therapeutic responses. Advanced 3D platforms such as perfusable tumor-on-a-chip systems and vascularized bioprinted tumors provide unique opportunities to simulate these barriers and investigate strategies to overcome them, such as nanoparticle-based delivery or localized drug release. Additionally, the integration of multi-omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, into 3D model workflows offers an unprecedented systems-level view of tumor evolution, resistance mechanisms, and drug responses. Combining these data with patient-specific models like PDOs or bioprinted constructs enables precision oncology efforts that are both mechanistically insightful and clinically actionable. As these models move closer to clinical application, ethical and regulatory considerations are becoming increasingly relevant. Issues such as informed patient consent for tissue-derived models, data privacy, long-term biobanking, intellectual property, and equitable access to advanced model systems must be carefully addressed. Standardization and oversight from regulatory agencies, as well as transparency in data sharing, will be crucial for ensuring the responsible development and implementation of personalized 3D tumor models in both research and clinical contexts.
