License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ Purpose For locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC), the addition of brachytherapy (BT) improves overall survival (OS), and interstitial BT has been prospectively shown to improve target and organ at risk dose. Brachytherapy is less common in patients without insurance, underrepresented minorities, and in low-volume cancer centers, which may in turn widen cancer disparities. In this study, we utilized the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to examine the patterns and predictors of interstitial brachytherapy in patients with LACC, and its impact on OS. Material and methods Patients with LACC (stage IIB-IVA) diagnosed between 2004-2018 and treated with radiation were included. A logistic regression model was fit with the predictors, such as race, nodes, T-stage, facility type, age, and Charlson-Deyo score, to estimate the probability of receiving interstitial brachytherapy treatment and to calculate propensity scores. Cox regression model was defined using the calculated propensity scores as a covariate to examine the effect of brachytherapy group on OS. Results In the study, 9,829 patients were included, and 15% of them received interstitial BT. On multivariable analysis, a higher stage and treatment at an academic center were associated with increased interstitial BT. African American patients and those with positive nodes were less likely to receive interstitial BT. After propensity score matching, there was no OS difference between patient treated with interstitial vs. intracavitary BT (HR: 0.985, p Conclusions Our work supports the growing body of literature on BT utilization impacted by patient race and treatment facility. Patients with a higher stage of cervical cancer and those treated at a high volume or academic center were more likely to receive interstitial BT, reflecting appropriate intensification of therapy for larger tumors. Interstitial BT did not indicate an OS benefit. Further study could lead to improved understanding of barriers to accessing interstitial brachytherapy. cervical cancer brachytherapy interstitial disparities pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Purpose Cervical cancer (CC) is the second most common gynecologic cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death in women aged 20-39 years [ 1 1 2 3 1 4 5 6 The standard of care for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) is multimodality therapy, including chemotherapy, external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), and a brachytherapy (BT) boost [ 7 8 7 Despite the importance of BT in treatment outcomes for LACC, data suggest declining utilization of BT, particularly in patients without insurance, underrepresented minorities, and in low-volume cancer centers. The decline in brachytherapy among vulnerable populations may in turn widen cancer disparities [ 9 2 Locally advanced disease often requires interstitial management to adequately treat the extent of disease, while radiation oncologists may not be trained, equipped, or comfortable performing interstitial implants. A survey of ABS members indicated the complexity of interstitial BT requiring specific training and tools as a potential reason for the underutilization of BT overall [ 10 Material and methods Patient population and data selection The NCDB is a nationwide cancer outcomes database for approximately 1,500 Commission on Cancer-accredited cancer programs, and capturing approximately 70% of newly diagnosed cancer patients in the United States. Data are collected and submitted using nationally standardized data item and coding definitions, as outlined in the Commission on Cancer’s Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards. Data reported from Commission on Cancer-approved hospitals are abstracted from patient charts by certified tumor registrars, who undergo training specific to cancer registry. All data submitted to the National Cancer Database undergo integrity checks, internal quality monitoring, and validity reviews. Additionally, every few years, surveyors from the Commission on Cancer evaluate each hospital’s data collection processes. For the current study, the NCDB was used to identify patients with LACC (clinical FIGO stage IIB-IVA) diagnosed between 2004-2018, and treated with radiation that involved a component of BT. All histologies were included. Patients who received only BT or those with incomplete data were excluded from this cohort. Treatment groups were divided into patients who received EBRT + intracavitary BT vs. those who received EBRT+ interstitial BT. NCDB records on the type of high-dose-rate (HDR; intracavitary vs. interstitial) were acquired with the Standards for Oncology Registry Entry by institutional data registrars using radiation completion notes, with manual verification from treating physicians when needed. Hybrid (intracavitary + interstitial) applicators were captured as interstitial implants within this framework. Statistical analysis Chi-square tests were employed to compare categorical patient characteristics across brachytherapy groups, and Wilcoxon tests were used to compare continuous characteristics. A logistic regression model was fit with clinically relevant predictors, such as race, nodes, T-stage, facility type, age, and Charlson-Deyo score, to estimate the probability of receiving interstitial brachytherapy treatment and to calculate propensity scores. Following this analysis, a Cox regression model was defined with the calculated propensity scores as a covariate, to examine the effect of brachytherapy group on OS. Finally, Kaplan-Meier methods were applied to plot survival curves by brachytherapy group. Results The total number of patients who met entry criteria was 9,829, with median age of 55 years.

As has been shown in a previous report [ 20 In terms of OS, after propensity score matching, the utilization of interstitial BT implant did not translate into an OS benefit, possibly due to the selection of cases that have poor initial response to chemoradiation and/or advanced stage of disease. This analysis was subject to several inherent limitations of population database studies, such as the possibility of inaccurate coding, underreporting, and selection and reporting bias. This analysis was limited to patients who received radiation for LACC with a BT component. However, it is difficult to determine from the NCDB whether this has been performed with a definitive vs. palliative intent, which might influence the rationale behind the type of BT utilized, and hence, impact the analysis. Importantly, the NCDB only recently started to capture radiation treatment in distinct phases. The goal of 2018 implementation of separate phase-specific data items for the recording of radiation modality and external beam radiation treatment planning techniques, is to clarify these information and implement mutually exclusive categories; therefore, interstitial vs. intracavitary might not have been adequately acquired as distinct categories prior to this update. Conclusions The current work provides a unique analysis for interstitial BT utilization determinants in the management of LACC. It overall supports growing body of literature that BT utilization, irrespective of technique, is impacted by patient race and treatment facility. Our data show that patients with a higher stage cervical cancer and those treated at a high volume or at academic center were more likely to receive interstitial BT. This pattern possibly reflects appropriate intensification of therapy for larger tumors at centers with interstitial implant expertise. However, utilization of interstitial implant did not translate into an OS benefit. Further study could lead to improved understanding of barriers to accessing interstitial brachytherapy, and how current and proposed insurance as well as reimbursement models affect its implementation, in order to inform policy and efforts to ensure equitable and accountable care with brachytherapy.
