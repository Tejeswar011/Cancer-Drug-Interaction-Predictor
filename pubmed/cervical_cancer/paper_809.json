Background Osteoporosis in postmenopausal women is characterized by significant bone mass loss due to reduced oestrogen, leading to an increased risk of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF). Comprehensive risk prediction models for diagnosing and predicting fracture risk in this population are still lacking. Objective This study aims to identify key risk factors for OVCF in postmenopausal osteoporotic women and develop a machine learning model to predict OVCF risk by integrating clinical, biological, and musculoskeletal data. Methods This retrospective case-control study included 486 postmenopausal women diagnosed with osteoporosis between 2015 and 2018. The patients were divided into a non-fracture group (Group A) and a vertebral fracture group (Group B) based on whether they developed OVCF during the subsequent 5 years of treatment and follow-up. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for OVCF. Furthermore, a comprehensive risk prediction model was constructed using multiple machine learning algorithms. Results Among the 486 postmenopausal women, 269 (55.35%) experienced OVCF. Low bone mineral density (BMD), chronic inflammation, and sarcopenia were identified as independent risk factors, while regular anti-osteoporotic treatment was associated with a reduced fracture incidence. The Balanced Bagging machine learning model demonstrated an accuracy of 98.98%, a sensitivity of 98.24%, a specificity of 100.00%, and the model’s F 1 Conclusion The development of OVCF in postmenopausal osteoporotic women is influenced by a combination of bone metabolism, inflammatory processes, and muscle health. The machine learning model developed in this study provides a reliable and accurate tool for personalized OVCF risk prediction, allowing clinicians to optimize prevention and treatment strategies. Future large-scale prospective studies are required to validate these findings and enhance the model’s predictive capabilities. osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture percutaneous kyphoplasty postoperative refracture osteoporosis postmenopausal women machine learning Science and Education Strong Health Project of Suzhou in China MSXM2024011 The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

In postmenopausal women, oestrogen decline accelerates bone resorption, lowering bone mineral density (BMD) and increasing fragility fracture risk ( 1 2 3 4 5 4–8 9 10 11–14 Bone turnover markers, including type I procollagen N-terminal propeptide (P1NP; formation) and carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx; resorption), reflect skeletal metabolism, while osteocalcin (BGP) indicates osteoblastic activity ( 14–17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2 Methods 2.1 Management of the sample The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University (2024 Lun Research Grant No. 728). This study investigated factors associated with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. We analyzed 486 postmenopausal women diagnosed with primary osteoporosis between January 2015 and December 2018, all of whom received up to 5 years of outpatient follow-up. Patients were categorized into two groups based on the occurrence of OVCF. Inclusion criteria were: postmenopausal women with a menopause duration of 1–20 years, a diagnosis of primary osteoporosis, and regular follow-up for at least 5 years. Exclusion criteria included severe congenital or acquired spinal deformities, conditions significantly affecting bone metabolism, and incomplete medical or imaging records. Among the diseases that significantly affect bone metabolism are (1) chronic kidney disease (eGFR <60 mL −1 −1 2.2 Observation indicators We retrospectively collected demographic data, laboratory results, and imaging information, including age, BMI, fracture history, histories of hypertension and diabetes, serum calcium, vitamin D3, osteocalcin (BGP), type I collagen amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP), carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptide (CTx), bone mineral density (BMD), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), psoas major index (PMI), and multifidus muscle index (MMI). All patients underwent serological tests and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at diagnosis and during follow-up to assess BMD and bone metabolism markers. Time 0 was defined as the date of the index DXA. A standardised baseline assessment pathway was implemented, whereby bone turnover markers and lumbar MRI (for PMI/MMI) were obtained routinely on the same day as DXA whenever feasible, and otherwise within four weeks. Osteoporosis was defined according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at the lumbar spine (L1–L4) or the total hip. A T T T Anti-osteoporosis medications at baseline and during follow-up (bisphosphonates, denosumab, teriparatide, or SERMs) were extracted from the electronic record and summarised in Table 1 Table 1 General data comparison between No vertebral fracture group (Group A) and Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture group (Group B) patients.

Since the retrospectively collected laboratory dataset contained only a small fraction of missing values, we employed the missForest algorithm, thereby minimizing information loss while preserving the underlying distribution structure. Model training employed 10-fold cross-validation and grid search for hyperparameter optimization: the former partitions the training data into 10 subsets, iteratively using nine for training and one for validation to reduce partition bias, while grid search systematically explores a predefined parameter space to identify the optimal parameter combination. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as AUC, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, F 1 a priori 3 Result 3.1 Patient characteristics A total of 486 postmenopausal osteoporotic women (mean age 63.18 ± 4.57 years) were included, with 217 in the non-fracture group (Group A) and 269 in the OVCF group (Group B).

By comprehensively evaluating individual patients, the model can be embedded into electronic health record systems, providing clinicians with a more intuitive risk assessment to identify women with osteoporosis whose biochemical or imaging parameters indicate fracture vulnerability. Helps develop more effective prevention and treatment strategies. Comprehensive factor analysis helps identify patient deficiencies and provide multidimensional interventions. Early intensive anti-osteoporosis treatment, optimization of calcium-vitamin D status, and targeted resistance training can effectively stop the transition from osteoporosis to bone loss, thereby preventing the first OVCF. For future clinical deployments, our strategy is to reduce the need for bespoke data collection by leveraging data generated from routine care and providing a calibrated, patient-specific probability at the point of care. The production model uses nine routine variables, and a five-feature configuration (BMD T-score, CTx, NLR, age, BMI) retains >90% of the full model’s discriminative power. The tool remains deployable in resource-limited settings, while federated updating and periodic recalibration support sustainable, privacy-preserving model improvement across hospitals. Unlike single-modality calculators (e.g., DEXA thresholds or turnover markers alone) or physics-only morphometric models, our framework integrates densitometry, biochemical resorption activity, inflammatory tone, and clinical context to produce calibrated, patient-specific probabilities with case-level explanations. This multimodal, EHR-embeddable approach supports targeted, modifiable interventions and remains deployable in resource-limited settings via a five-feature configuration that preserves >90% of full-model discrimination. Although this study explored the risk factors for OVCF in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis through multifactorial analysis and machine learning modelling, there are still some limitations. First, this study was a retrospective study with a single sample source. Future large-scale prospective studies are needed to validate the broad applicability of these risk factors and predictive models. All participants in the study were recruited from China; therefore, genetic backgrounds, lifestyle factors, and medical care may differ from other ethnic groups, which may not make the model generalisable worldwide. Future prospective multicentre validation in European and North American populations will be sought, as well as recalibration of model thresholds for different ethnic backgrounds. In addition, given the low prevalence and incomplete ascertainment of some secondary causes of altered bone metabolism, we treated these factors as exclusion criteria rather than including them as covariates in the model. As a result, our model may not be generalisable to these subgroups and could potentially underestimate the risk in such contexts. Thirdly, although the baseline calibration was favorable, the time-varying treatment exposure (osteoporosis treatment regimen) and adherence were not explicitly modeled. Future studies should explore the influence of more potential factors on secondary OVCF in postmenopausal osteoporotic women to further improve the prediction model. 5 Conclusion This study identifies low BMD, chronic inflammation, and bone breaking indicator as key risk causes for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) in postmenopausal women, while regular anti-osteoporotic treatment reduces fracture risk. Multiple machine learning developed provides a reliable tool for personalized OVCF risk prediction, integrating clinical, biological, and musculoskeletal data to enhance prevention and treatment strategies. Future studies are needed to validate the model and explore additional factors, improving its accuracy and clinical application.
