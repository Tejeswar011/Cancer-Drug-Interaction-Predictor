In malignant neoplasms, gicerin has been implicated in promoting cellular invasion and metastasis. The present study aimed to investigate whether or not anti-gicerin antibodies could inhibit the progression of the human gastric cancer cell line NUGC-4 in a murine model. First, immunofluorescence staining was employed to confirm gicerin expression in the NUGC-4 cells. The cells were subsequently pretreated with either anti-gicerin antibodies or pre-immune IgG and transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice, where the extent of tumor growth and local invasion were both assessed. In a separate hematogenous metastasis model, mice received a tail-vein injection of NUGC-4 cells pretreated in an identical manner and pulmonary metastases were evaluated. Anti-gicerin antibody pretreatment led to a significant suppression of subcutaneous tumor formation, histological invasiveness and lung nodule formation compared with the controls. Taken together, these findings suggested that the antibody-mediated inhibition of gicerin reduced both local tumor progression and hematogenous spread in gastric cancer, highlighting gicerin as a promising therapeutic target that potentially may be effective when used in combination with conventional chemotherapy. gicerin cell adhesion molecule antibody gastric cancer cells metastasis Funding: pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Cell adhesion molecules fulfill critical roles in embryonic development, tissue repair and intercellular communication ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 14 2 3 6 8 11 Gicerin, originally identified from chicken gizzard smooth muscle, shares high homology with mammalian CD146/MelCAM ( 15 19 19 22 Gicerin has been shown to engage in both homophilic and heterophilic interactions, including those with specific laminins, influencing processes such as cell migration and neurite extension ( 19 20 19 20 15 19 20 Gastric cancer is a common gastrointestinal malignancy, frequently metastasizing to the liver and peritoneum, with occasional, but significant, pulmonary metastases ( 23 25 9 14 26 27 NUGC-4, a poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma cell line, is commonly used for in vivo 28 Materials and methods Immunization and purification of anti-gicerin antibodies To generate polyclonal antibodies against gicerin, 10 female BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old) were immunized with recombinant gicerin protein. The primary immunization was performed subcutaneously with 50 µg of recombinant rat gicerin protein (aa 1–545; accession number Q9EPF2-1) ( 29 Collected blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for 1 h prior to centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 10 min at 4°C to isolate serum. The sera from all mice were pooled and total IgG was purified using a Protein G Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's protocol. Bound IgG was eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.7) and immediately neutralized with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0). The eluates were subsequently dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and the IgG concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. Similarly, serum was collected from non-immunized normal mice and IgG was purified using protein G affinity chromatography. The resulting antibodies were used as pre-immune IgG. For the isolation of gicerin-specific antibodies, affinity purification was performed using a custom-made column prepared by covalently coupling recombinant gicerin protein to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Cytiva). The purified IgG was subsequently loaded onto the affinity column equilibrated with PBS. After extensive washing, bound antibodies were eluted with 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.7) and immediately neutralized, as aforementioned. The eluted antibodies were then dialyzed against PBS and protein concentrations were quantified using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The final purified anti-gicerin antibodies were subsequently adjusted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in PBS and stored at −80°C until use. The overview of antibody production and purification is shown in Fig. 1A Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) Staining Recombinant gicerin protein and mouse antibodies were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels. Protein samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, heated at 95°C for 5 min and loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out under reducing conditions using a Mini-PROTEAN Tetra System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) at a constant voltage of 100 V. After electrophoresis, the gel was briefly rinsed with distilled water and stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining solution (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature. The gel was subsequently destained with a solution containing 40% methanol and 10% acetic acid until protein bands became clearly visible. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Each well of the polystyrene ELISA plates (Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd.) was coated with 0.2 µg of recombinant gicerin proteins in PBS and the plate was incubated over night at 4°C. Each of the following incubation steps were preceded by washing the wells twice with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The wells were blocked for nonspecific binding by the addition of a commercial blocking buffer (DS Pharma Biomedical Co., Ltd.) and were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. The serial dilutions of pre-immune IgG and anti-gicerin IgG were added vertically to the wells and kept for incubation at 37°C for 1 h. The HRP-conjugated rabbit IgG diluted (1:5,000) in PBS was dispensed into each well. The plate was incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Later, a substrate buffer containing TMB (Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd.) was added to each well and kept for incubation at 37°C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of a stopping reagent (1.25M sulfuric acid). The absorbance was recorded at 450 nm using the ELISA plate reader (DS Pharma Biomedical Co., Ltd.). The ELISA titer was defined as the highest dilution factor of anti-gicerin IgG that yielded an absorbance value at least three times higher than that obtained with pre-immune IgG.

JCRB0834), HUVEC cells [JCRB Cell Bank; cat. no. IFO50271; F10 (passage 10)] and murine melanoma B16 cells (RIKEN BioResource Research Center; cat. no. RCB1283) were cultured in DMEM (high glucose) supplemented with L-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, 10% FBS and antibiotics (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 Confirmation of gicerin expression on NUGC-4 cells and HUVECs Monolayers of NUGC-4 and HUVEC cells were fixed using Zamboni's fixative and incubated with a murine polyclonal anti-gicerin antibody (1:500; generated as aforementioned) at 37°C, followed by an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100; MilliporeSigma; cat. no. AP124F) at 37°C. In addition, tumor tissues harvested from mice were fixed in Zamboni's solution and frozen sections (20 µm thickness) were subjected to immunofluorescence staining using the anti-gicerin primary antibody followed by the FITC-conjugated secondary antibody as aforementioned. Fluorescence microscopy revealed the distinct membrane-localized expression of gicerin on cells. A commercially available mounting medium containing DAPI was employed following the manufacturer's instructions. While nuclear staining was achieved, the combined display of phase-contrast, FITC (gicerin) and DAPI slightly reduced the clarity of cell contours in our setup; therefore, the final images are presented without DAPI to best illustrate the relationship between cell morphology and gicerin expression in the same field of view. Protein extraction and western blot analysis Cultured NUGC-4, HUVEC and B16 cells were rinsed twice with calcium- and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution and collected using a cell scraper. The harvested monolayer cells were subsequently homogenized in PBS using a Polytron homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris, followed by centrifugation of the supernatants at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-acetate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM EDTA and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and incubated at 4°C for 1 h with continuous rotation. The suspensions were subsequently centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 90 min at 4°C and the final supernatants were collected for western blot analysis, as described by Taniura et al 31 19 20 Subcutaneous tumor transplantation model Subcutaneous implantation of tumor cells into the cervical region of nude mice offers several advantages ( 32 7 2 After the final measurement, mice were deeply anesthetized using isoflurane (induction at 3–5% and maintenance at 2–3% in oxygen) and the absence of reflex responses (pedal withdrawal and palpebral reflexes) was confirmed before proceeding with the experiment. Sacrifice was performed by cervical dislocation while the mice were in a state of deep anesthesia, or alternatively by thoracotomy to confirm the cessation of cardiac activity. Mortality was verified by the absence of a heartbeat and fixed, dilated pupils. In accordance with institutional animal care guidelines, the maximum allowable tumor volume was limited to 1.5 cm 3 Pathologically, the tumors were excised, 10% buffered-formalin-fixed for 48 h at room temperature, paraffin-embedded and stained with hematoxylin for 5 min at room temperature (22–25°C), followed by eosin staining for 3 min at room temperature [hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining] for a histopathological assessment of local invasion. For immunofluorescence staining, tumor tissues were fixed in Zamboni's fixative, followed by cryoprotection in 20% sucrose solution for 24 h at 4°C. The samples were subsequently frozen at −30°C and 20-µm frozen sections were prepared using a cryostat. The frozen sections were blocked with 1% non-fat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at room temperature, and were subsequently incubated with a murine polyclonal anti-gicerin antibody (1:500; generated as aforementioned) at 37°C, followed by an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100; MilliporeSigma; cat. no. AP124F) at 37°C as aforementioned. Fluorescence microscopy revealed the distinct membrane-localized expression of gicerin on cells.

The NUGC-4 cell suspensions were preincubated with anti-gicerin polyclonal antibodies or pre-immune IgG for 1 h at 37°C. After five washing in PBS and centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4°C, the NUGC-4 cells were resuspended in DMEM and seeded on to the HUVEC monolayers. Following a 30 min incubation at 37°C, the cultures were gently washed with DMEM and removed and the NUGC-4 cells adhering to the feeder layers were observed under a light microscope (Nikon Corporation). The cell number per area was determined for five areas and the average scores and standard deviation (SD) were calculated.

Cells were subsequently incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 Statistical analysis All quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). For in vivo in vitro Results Generation and purification of murine anti-gicerin antibody The procedure for generating and purifying the murine anti-gicerin antibody is summarized in Fig. 1A Neutralizing activity of anti-gicerin IgG in cell adhesion The neutralizing activity of anti-gicerin IgG was evaluated using a cell aggregation assay. When anti-gicerin IgG was added to the suspension culture of gicerin-expressing L929 cells, a marked inhibition of cell-cell aggregation was observed ( Fig. 1Ba and Bb Fig. 1Bc 50 Gicerin is expressed in NUGC-4 cells Immunofluorescence analysis revealed the presence of distinct membrane-associated signals in NUGC-4 cells, confirming robust gicerin expression ( Fig. 2A Fig. 2B 19 20 Subcutaneous tumor growth and invasion is reduced in the subcutaneous tumor model In the subcutaneous tumor model, tumor masses derived from cells treated with anti-gicerin antibody exhibited markedly suppressed tumor growth compared with the control group (P <0.01; Fig. 3A Fig. 3B Fig. 3C Pulmonary metastasis is suppressed in the tail-vein injection model In the tail-vein injection model, mice that received pre-immune IgG-treated cells were found to develop multiple tumor nodules in the lung parenchyma, often accompanied by hemorrhagic changes ( Fig. 4 Inhibition of NUGC-4 cell adhesion to gicerin-coated surfaces by anti-gicerin antibody To evaluate the role of gicerin in mediating cell adhesion, culture dishes were coated with recombinant gicerin protein and seeded with NUGC-4 cells. A substantial number of cells adhered to the gicerin-coated surface under control conditions. However, in the presence of anti-gicerin antibody, cell adhesion to the gicerin-coated areas was markedly inhibited, as evidenced by a significant reduction in the number of adherent cells ( Fig. 5A In vitro cell adhesion of the NUGC-4 cells to vascular endothelial cells When HUVECs were used as a feeder layer and NUGC-4 cells were seeded, a substantial number of NUGC-4 cells adhered to the surface of HUVECs. Immunofluorescence staining subsequently revealed that gicerin was positively expressed in the monolayer of HUVEC cells, as well as in the NUGC-4 cells adhering to them ( Fig. 5B The addition of an anti-gicerin antibody markedly decreased the number of NUGC-4 cells that adhered to HUVECs compared with the addition of pre-immune IgG, demonstrating that the anti-gicerin antibody could inhibit the adhesion of NUGC-4 cells to vascular endothelial cells ( Fig. 5C In vitro cell migration assay To examine the involvement of gicerin in the migratory potential of NUGC-4 cells, an in vitro Fig. 5D Measurement of cell death by CDC assay When pre-immune IgG was used, the addition of fresh serum did not induce cell death. By contrast, significant levels of cell death were observed when fresh murine serum was added to NUGC-4 cells preincubated with anti-gicerin IgG; however, no cell death occurred when heat-inactivated serum was used ( Fig. 6A Fig. 6B Fig. 6C Discussion The present study demonstrated that gicerin was highly expressed in NUGC-4 gastric cancer cells and that the specific binding of these cells to anti-gicerin antibodies markedly suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth, local invasion and pulmonary metastasis in an in vivo 16 19 20 in vitro 20 26 Furthermore, the addition of anti-gicerin IgG to the culture medium was found not to alter the doubling time of tumor cells in vitro in vivo in vitro 33 16 19 20 34 36 16 19 20 36 39 16 19 20 34 36 in vitro in vivo Additionally, the present study demonstrated that the antibody markedly suppressed the motility of gastric cancer cells cultured on gicerin-coated dishes. These findings support the hypothesis that gicerin plays a critical role in facilitating tumor cell migration and tissue infiltration, particularly in gastric cancer. In subsequent studies, it is planned to further dissect the interaction between gicerin and other adhesion molecules such as cadherins and vimentin, using in vitro The present study chose recombinant rat gicerin as the immunogen for antibody production. This decision was based on previous success in establishing a high-purity, large-scale production system for recombinant rat gicerin protein, which enabled the generation of highly sensitive neutralizing antibodies when used to immunize rabbit ( 29 40 Despite overall 70–72% identity between rat and human gicerin/CD146 in the extracellular region, functionally important surfaces within the Ig like domains are conserved. Prior structural work shows that inhibitory anti gicerin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) can bind the D4-D5 interface and attenuate dimerization/activation. It is hypothesized that our polyclonal anti rat gicerin IgG contains subpopulations recognizing such conserved epitopes on human gicerin, which explained the neutralization of adhesion/invasion/metastasis observed in NUGC 4 cells. The present study did not perform epitope mapping. As follow up, it is planned to i) test binding to isolated human gicerin domain fragments (D1-D5), ii) run peptide competition or Pepscan ELISAs focusing on conserved surface loops within D1 and D4-D5 and iii) evaluate blocking against a reference inhibitory anti gicerin/CD146 mAb (e.g., AA98) to determine overlap. These experiments will pinpoint the dominant neutralizing epitopes. In the development of antibody-based therapies, these results underscore the dual role of gicerin in gastric cancer: not only as a structural adhesion molecule that facilitates tumor dissemination, but also as an immunological target whose inhibition may trigger tumor necrosis through host immune mechanisms. These findings collectively highlighted gicerin as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted, both to clarify whether anti-gicerin antibodies primarily interfere with homophilic or with heterophilic binding and to elucidate the functions of distinct isoforms, if any should exist. Additional investigations focusing on established tumors and the possible synergistic effects of anti-gicerin therapy in combination with standard chemotherapy will be essential in order to define the clinical applicability of this strategy. Overall, these findings have strongly supported the potential usefulness of gicerin as a molecular target in the treatment of gastric cancer. Gastric cancer cells actively shape their tumor microenvironment (TME) through several mechanisms that promote tumor survival, invasion and metastasis ( 41 4 33 41 in vivo However, when administering anti-gicerin antibodies to tumor-bearing animals, it is necessary to pretreat the antibody so as to minimize complement activation in the circulation. This cautionary measure arises from the fact that normal vascular and muscular tissues constitutively express gicerin; specifically, inadvertent binding of the antibody, followed by complement activation, could have deleterious effects on healthy tissues. Indeed, our preliminary pilot investigations revealed that the intravenous administration of intact anti-gicerin IgG to healthy mice induced pulmonary edema as a serious adverse event. Accordingly, before proceeding with in vivo Collectively, the observed suppression of gastric cancer progression in vivo in vivo Acknowledgements Not applicable.

Generation of mouse anti-gicerin antibody and validation of its binding activity. (A) The procedure for generating and purifying the murine anti-gicerin antibody is summarized. (a) BALB/c mice were immunized with recombinant gicerin protein, followed by IgG purification from serum. The IgG fraction was subsequently affinity-purified using a Sepharose column conjugated with gicerin protein. (b) As shown by SDS-PAGE, the gicerin recombinant protein immunized as the antigen for antibody production (lane 1) appeared as a single band at ~120 kDa, while the final purified mouse IgG (lane 2) exhibited a single band at ~150 kDa. Binding activity of mouse IgG to gicerin proteins by ELISA. (c) Recombinant proteins of gicerin were bound to plate at 2 µg/ml overnight at 4°C. Samples were blocked with 1% blocking buffer (Block Ace) in distilled water for 2 h. Serial dilutions of pre-immune or anti-gicerin IgG were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After washing with PBS, HRP-conjugated polyclonal antibody against mouse IgGs were reacted for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine was added to each well and plates were read at 450 nm utilizing a Multiscan JX (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). ELISA demonstrated that the purified antibody exhibited strong binding activity to gicerin protein, with an ELISA titer of 12,800 when compared to pre-immune IgG. (B) Neutralizing activity of anti-gicerin IgG in cell adhesion. (a) In the cell aggregation assay, L-929 cells expressing gicerin formed multicellular aggregates upon the addition of pre-immune IgG, indicating cell-cell adhesion. (b) When the anti-gicerin IgG was added to the suspension cultures, a marked inhibition of cell-cell aggregation was observed. Scale bars, 100 µm; magnification, ×200. (c) Dose-response curves were generated by plotting the aggregation index against the logarithmic antibody concentrations. Nonlinear regression analysis determined that the IC 50 50 Figure 1.

Figure 2. Gicerin expression in NUGC-4 cells. (A) Indirect immunofluorescence staining of NUGC-4 cells was performed and observed under a fluorescence microscope (as shown by the B-excitation filter). No fluorescence was detected when pre-immune IgG was applied (a, phase contrast; b, immunofluorescence). By contrast, strong green fluorescence was observed on the cell surface following staining with anti-gicerin IgG (c, phase contrast; d, immunofluorescence), indicating membrane-associated expression of gicerin. scale bars, 50 µm; magnification, ×400. (B) Western blot analysis of membrane fractions from B16 (lane 2), HUVEC (lane 3) and NUGC-4 cells (lane 4) following SDS-PAGE. The recombinant gicerin protein used as the immunogen was also subjected to electrophoresis as a positive control and to verify the specificity and reactivity of the antibody (lane 1). Notably, a doublet band of ~120 kDa was observed in lane 4, consistent with the expression of both the short and long isoforms of gicerin in NUGC-4 cells. Figure 2.

Figure 3. Tumor growth and histopathological features following subcutaneous injection into nude mice. (A) NUGC-4 cells treated with either pre-immune IgG or anti-gicerin IgG were subcutaneously injected into the dorsal neck region of nude mice (n=5 per group). Tumor volume was measured over time using the formula: AxB 2 Figure 3. Tumor growth and histopathological features following subcutaneous injection into nude mice.

(A) NUGC-4 cells pretreated with either pre-immune IgG or anti-gicerin IgG were injected into the tail veins of nude mice (n=5 per group). On day 15, lung tissues were harvested and examined histologically. (a) In the pre-immune IgG group, multiple metastatic foci were observed, characterized by epithelial-like tumor cell proliferation and frequent hemorrhaging. (b) By contrast, few metastatic lesions were detected in the anti-gicerin IgG group. Scale bar, 100 µm; magnification, ×100. (B) The number of metastatic foci per unit area in lung tissue was quantified histologically. Data are shown as mean ± SD (n=5 mice per group). Between-group comparison was performed with a two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test; the difference was statistically significant. Significance indicators: ns (P≥0.05), *P<0.05, **P<0.01. Figure 4.

Figure 5. (A) Inhibition of NUGC-4 cell adhesion to gicerin protein by anti-gicerin antibody. Only the right half of each culture dish was coated with recombinant gicerin protein. NUGC-4 cell adhesion was assessed under a phase-contrast microscope. (a) The cells predominantly adhered to the gicerin-coated region, indicating that NUGC-4 cells exhibit homophilic binding through gicerin molecules expressed on their surface. Adhesion was not inhibited by pre-immune IgG. (b) By contrast, treatment with anti-gicerin IgG markedly suppressed the attachment of NUGC-4 cells to the gicerin-coated area. These findings demonstrate that anti-gicerin IgG effectively blocks the homophilic adhesion ability of NUGC-4 cells via gicerin. Scale bars, 100 µm; magnification ×200. (B) Adhesion of NUGC-4 cells to HUVEC monolayers. (a) Immunofluorescence staining revealed gicerin expression on both adherent NUGC-4 cells and HUVEC feeder cells. NUGC-4 cells treated with either (b) pre-immune IgG or (c) anti-gicerin IgG were seeded on to confluent HUVEC monolayers. Compared with the pre-immune IgG group, the number of NUGC-4 cells attached to HUVEC layers was noticeably reduced in the anti-gicerin IgG group. Scale bar, 100 µm. Magnification: a, ×200; and b and c, ×50. (C) The number of NUGC-4 cells adhering to HUVECs was markedly lower in the anti-gicerin IgG group compared with the pre-immune control. Adherent cells were counted in randomly selected 0.3 mm 2 Figure 5. (A) Inhibition of NUGC–4 cell adhesion to gicerin protein by anti–gicerin antibody. Only the right half of each culture dish was coated with recombinant gicerin protein. NUGC–4 cell adhesion... Figure 6. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity assay. (A) NUGC-4 cells were incubated with either pre-immune IgG or anti-gicerin IgG, followed by treatment with either fresh mouse serum (complement-active) or heat-inactivated serum (heated at 56°C for 30 min). After a 1 h incubation at 37°C, non-adherent cells were removed and adherent cells were detached by treating the cells with trypsin-EDTA. Cell viability was assessed using the trypan blue exclusion method under light microscopy (a, with PBS; b, with pre-immune IgG, c, with anti-gicerin IgG; d, with pre-immune IgG and inactivated serum; e, with anti-gicerin IgG and inactivated serum; f, pre-immune IgG and fresh serum; g, with anti-gicerin IgG and fresh serum. (B) Viable (unstained) and nonviable (blue-stained) cells were counted and the percentages of dead cells were calculated. Data are mean ± SD (n=5 independent replicates per group). Seven groups were compared by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's HSD; only the cell + anti-gicerin IgG + fresh mouse serum group differed markedly from all other groups (***P<0.001). (C) Doubling times of NUGC-4 cells with anti-gicerin antibody. The cells were cultured with PBS, pre-immune IgG and anti-gicerin IgG and doubling times in each condition were calculated. As shown in the graph, anti-gicerin antibody did not affect the proliferation of NUGC-4 cells under in vitro Figure 6. Complement–dependent cytotoxicity assay. (A) NUGC–4 cells were incubated with either pre–immune IgG or anti–gicerin IgG, followed by treatment with either fresh mouse serum (complement–activ... ",
