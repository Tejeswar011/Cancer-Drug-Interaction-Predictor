Highlights • Urine and vaginal self-sampling were highly acceptable among women with CIN2+. • Instructional videos were effective and well-received for self-collection guidance. • HPV testing showed excellent agreement, especially for HPV16 detection. • Findings support self-collection in national programs to expand screening coverage. Objective In Brazil — a country of continental dimensions with marked socioeconomic disparities — the use of self-collected samples and first-void urine for cervical cancer screening may be particularly valuable. This study aimed to assess the acceptability of two self-sampling approaches - first-void urine collection and vaginal self-sampling - among women diagnosed with high-grade cervical lesions (CIN2+) referred to a tertiary care center. Additionally, the study evaluated the concordance of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) test results obtained from self-collected samples compared to those collected by a healthcare professional. Methods This cross-sectional study included 100 women. Participants completed a structured questionnaire on clinical history, demographics, gynecological and obstetric background. Following an instructional video, they performed self-collection of urine and vaginal samples. All participants then underwent colposcopic examination for lesion assessment and therapeutic planning. HPV DNA testing was conducted, and agreement analysis was performed between sample types. Results Both urine and vaginal self-collection methods were reported as easy and comfortable. Instructions were considered easy or very easy by nearly all participants for all collection methods. Clinician-collected sampling was associated with higher embarrassment and discomfort. Agreement analysis showed excellent concordance for HPV 16 and other high-risk HPV types between self-collected, urine, and clinician-collected samples, with all comparisons reaching statistical significance. Conclusions Urine and vaginal self-collection are feasible, acceptable, and reliable methods. Urine sampling was the preferred method in the present study. High concordance with clinician-collected samples confirms their clinical utility, and the positive response to instructional videos highlights the importance of educational support.

The Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA) estimates approximately 17,010 new cases for the 2023–2025 triennium, representing the third most common cancer among women in this country. 1 2 3 , 4 Brazil is a country of continental dimensions with significant socioeconomic disparities and cultural and structural barriers to accessing healthcare services. Combined with cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates, this scenario favors the adoption of a more sensitive screening method to control cervical cancer. In March 2024, the Brazilian Ministry of Health published guidelines authorizing the use of molecular tests for high-risk oncogenic human Papillomavirus (hrHPV) as primary screening for cervical cancer. This guideline, to be implemented by the end of 2025, establishes that cervical cancer screening in Brazil must be organized, using molecular hrHPV testing followed by cytology when necessary. 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 9 , 13 Limited access to healthcare services, the need for well-trained healthcare teams to assist women, and cultural factors such as fear or shame, pain, and physical limitations also hinder the effectiveness of the Brazilian cervical cancer screening program. Due to their less invasive nature and the possibility of being performed outside clinical settings, vaginal self-sampling devices have significant potential to improve screening effectiveness. 14 , 15 16 , 17 18 , 19 The use of First-Void Urine (FVU) samples for molecular hrHPV testing has also proven to be an effective and well-accepted alternative among women. 20 21 22 23 24 , 25 In this context, the use of educational videos by healthcare services emerges as an important tool to support the understanding of health-related information. 26 , 27 Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the acceptability of urine collection using the Colli-Pee® device and vaginal self-sampling with the Coari® brush, in comparison to the collection performed by a healthcare professional. Moreover, the authors aimed to assess the acceptability of urine sampling as an alternative method for cervical cancer screening among women with high-grade cervical lesions (CIN2+) referred for treatment at a tertiary care center. Finally, the study also evaluated the agreement of hrHPV test results between the different sample collection methods. Methods and methods Study population This was a cross-sectional study involving 100 women aged 21-years and older referred from Basic Health Units to a tertiary healthcare facility, the Clinics Hospital of Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de São Paulo, in São Paulo, Brazil, for colposcopy due to abnormalities detected in cervical cytology or histopathological biopsy findings. Samples were collected between January and September 2024. The exclusion criteria were pregnancy, prior total hysterectomy, immunosuppression, or a history of previous treatment for HPV-induced cervical lesions. All participants signed an informed consent form (Supp. Data 1). The volunteers completed a questionnaire covering clinical information, demographic data, gynecological and obstetric history, sexual practices, and comorbidities. Subsequently, the participants watched an instructional video explaining the devices used for urine collection (Colli-Pee®) and vaginal self-sampling (Coari® brush). Sample collection procedures After watching the instructional video, the participants received verbal instructions on the use of the Colli-Pee® FV-500 device (Novosanis®, Wijnegem, Belgium) as well as the Coari® vaginal self-sampling brush (Kolplast®, São Paulo, Brazil). Sequential collection of urine, vaginal self-sample, and clinician-collected cervical samples was then performed. The Colli-Pee® FV-500 device standardizes the collection of first void urine (13–20 mL), which is rich in cells from the lower genital tract, improving the sensitivity and reliability of molecular tests. Participants collected the urine sample in the restroom and returned the device to the healthcare staff. Vaginal self-sampling with the Coari® brush was then performed either in the examination room or in the restroom, based on participant preference. The procedure involved inserting the Coari® brush into the vagina, rotating it five times, and then removing it. The used brush was handed to the healthcare professional, who immediately added 19 mL of cell preservation solution (CellPreserv®, Kolplast®). Subsequently, all participants underwent colposcopic examination to evaluate cervical lesions and determine therapeutic management. Prior to colposcopy, cervical samples were collected using a sterile cervical brush (Kolplast®), which was inserted into the external cervical orifice and rotated five times. The material was immediately placed in cell preservation solution (CellPreserv®, Kolplast®). After the sequential collection of all three samples, participants completed a questionnaire assessing the acceptability of each sampling method as well as their satisfaction with the instructional video (Supp. Data 2). Immediately after collection, samples were transported to the laboratory, aliquoted, and stored at −20 °C for subsequent analysis. HPV DNA testing HPV DNA testing was performed using the Cobas® 4800 HPV Test at the Laboratory of the Gynecologic Oncology Research Institute (IPOG), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The Cobas HPV test provides specific genotyping for HPV16 and HPV18, as well as pooled results for 12 other high-risk types: HPV31, HPV33, HPV35, HPV39, HPV45, HPV51, HPV52, HPV56, HPV58, HPV59, HPV66, and HPV68. Sample preparation was conducted using the Cobas X480 platform, which simultaneously extracts, purifies, and prepares DNA for HPV and β-globin amplification. Instructional video An instructional video approximately four minutes in length was shown to participants, providing instructions on how to handle and use the vaginal and urine self-sampling devices ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=387uySsByHI Sample size calculation and statistical methods Sample size was calculated assuming an estimated HPV prevalence of 50 %, which maximizes sample size under a binomial distribution, with a 10 % absolute margin of error and a 95 % confidence level (α = 0.05). Based on this assumption, a minimum of 97 participants was required. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize sociodemographic, clinical, and reproductive characteristics of the participants. Categorical variables were expressed as absolute and relative frequencies with 95 % Confidence Intervals (95 % CI). Continuous variables were summarized using means and Standard Deviations (SD). Participants’ responses regarding acceptability and preferences for each sampling method were also presented as proportions with 95 % CIs. HPV DNA positivity rates by type (any HPV, HPV16, HPV18, and Other High-Risk types – OHR) were calculated for each sample collection method (urine, vaginal self-sampling, and clinician-collected cervical samples). Comparisons between methods were expressed as proportions with 95 % CIs and illustrated graphically. To assess the concordance of HPV detection across collection methods, Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (κ) was calculated for each HPV type. Agreement was interpreted according to Landis and Koch’s criteria. 28 p R R Ethical considerations All study procedures were conducted in accordance with the standards of the Institutional Ethics Committee under number CAAE: 55,640,222.7.0000.0068. All participants received a detailed explanation of the study objectives and procedures, and signed an informed consent form. Results The study population comprised 100 women diagnosed with high-grade cervical lesions. The majority of participants were between 30- and 39-years of age (39.4 %), followed by those aged 40–49 years (25.3 %) and 20–29 years (19.2 %). With regard to self-reported race/ethnicity, 56.0 % identified as Brown or mixed race, 26.0 % as White, and 17.0 % as Black. In terms of educational level, 62.0 % had completed secondary education, and 13.0 % reported having higher education. Most participants were either married or in a stable union (53.0 %). Regarding religious affiliation, 45.0 % identified as Evangelical or Protestant, while 28.0 % reported being Catholic. The majority of participants were non-smokers (83.0 %) ( Table 1 Table 1 Sociodemographic and clinicopathological characteristics of the study participants.

Reproductive history showed that 53.0 % of participants had experienced two to four pregnancies, and 58.0 % had given birth two to four times. A total of 33.0 % reported at least one abortion, with no participant reporting more than two. Hormonal contraceptives were the most frequently used method (37.0 %), while 31.0 % reported using no contraceptive method. As expected, due to the study’s inclusion criteria, the majority of participants presented high-grade abnormalities on initial cytology, including 71.0 % HSIL and 17.0 % ASC—H. Cervical biopsy results confirmed the presence of high-grade lesions in the majority of participants, with 51.0 % diagnosed with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) and 47.0 % with grade 3 (CIN3). Histopathological analysis of the surgical specimens revealed CIN2 or CIN3 in 72.0 % of the cases. Additionally, two participants were diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma exhibiting superficial stromal invasion, while two others presented with invasive carcinoma ‒ one squamous and the other adenocarcinoma. Conversely, chronic cervicitis was identified in 13.0 % of the cases.

The use of the device was described as very easy or easy by 96.0 % of respondents. Most participants reported no embarrassment (88.0 %) and only slight discomfort, while moderate embarrassment was reported by a small minority (2.0 %). When evaluating clinician-collected sampling, although the instructions were perceived as “very easy” by 38.0 % and “easy” by 61.0 % of participants, higher levels of embarrassment and discomfort were reported compared to self-collection methods. While 63.0 % of participants reported no discomfort during clinician collection, 28.0 % experienced mild discomfort, and 10.0 % reported moderate to severe embarrassment. Overall, urine collection was the most preferred method (53.0 %), followed by self-collection (17.0 %) and clinician collection (14.0 %). The most frequently cited reasons for these preferences included convenience (54.0 %), the ability to collect the sample independently (55.0 %), and the possibility of performing the procedure at home (51.0 %). The instructional video was overwhelmingly well evaluated: 99.0 % of participants reported that it facilitated understanding of the procedures, and all agreed that healthcare services should offer instructional videos. Furthermore, 62.0 % indicated that watching the video made them feel more confident and secure when using the devices. Conversely, 38.0 % stated that, although they found the video helpful, they would prefer to have a healthcare professional available to clarify any doubts after watching the video. t Fig. 1 Fig. 1 HPV positivity by type and sample collection method among participants with high-grade cervical lesions in the HPV self-collection acceptability study.

The findings support the use of self-collection as a reliable and well-accepted alternative to clinician-based sampling and offer relevant insights for optimizing cervical cancer screening strategies, especially in underserved populations. One of the main findings of this study was the high feasibility and acceptability of self-collection methods among women with high-grade cervical lesions. Notably, 70 % of participants chose self-collection over clinician collection as their preferred method, particularly with urine self-collection, where 97 % of participants reported no discomfort. Furthermore, 100 % and 97 % of participants found urine and vaginal self-collection devices easy to use, respectively. These findings align with earlier research and reinforce the potential of self-collection for use in high-risk populations where structural and psychosocial barriers persist. 29 , 30 Urine collection, in particular, emerged as the most preferred method (57 %), with participants citing convenience, autonomy, and the possibility of home-based use as important advantages. These findings are consistent with other reports. 31 , 32 The diagnostic performance of self-collection was also robust. High-risk HPV was detected in 86 % of clinician-collected samples, 82 % of vaginal self-collected samples, and 73 % of urine samples. Genotype-specific analysis revealed similar detection rates of HPV16 across all methods: 39 % (clinician), 40 % (vaginal self-collection), and 37 % (urine), highlighting the reliability of both self-collection approaches for detecting the most oncogenic HPV type. Cohen’s kappa analysis further supported these findings, showing almost perfect agreement for HPV16 detection and substantial agreement for overall hrHPV detection. These results mirror systematic reviews reporting high concordance between self- and clinician-collected samples in high-risk populations and validate the use of self-collection in diagnostic workflows. 33 Another strength of this study was the use of an instructional video to instruct participants on the correct use of self-collection devices. Nearly all participants (99 %) reported that the video was helpful, and 100 % believed such resources should be routinely available in healthcare services. These findings emphasize the role of digital educational tools in enhancing comprehension, reducing anxiety, and improving adherence to self-collection protocols. Previous studies have shown that audiovisual materials can significantly boost health literacy and screening participation. 26 These results are especially relevant in the context of Brazil’s transition to HPV DNA testing as the primary cervical cancer screening strategy. Given the country’s vast geography and socioeconomic inequalities, integrating self-collection ‒ especially urine collection ‒ into screening protocols may help overcome logistical and cultural barriers that limit participation. Previous modeling studies have shown that a single HPV DNA test at age 35 can reduce a woman’s lifetime risk of cervical cancer by approximately 25 % to 36 %. 34 35 Despite its strengths, this study has limitations. The sample included only women with histologically confirmed high-grade lesions, which limits the generalizability of the findings to the general screening population. Additionally, because participants were not instructed to avoid genital hygiene before collection, HPV detection rates may have been affected, particularly in urine samples. Finally, collections were conducted in a hospital setting with a professional available to clarify doubts ‒ this may have positively influenced both the acceptability and correct use of the devices. Future community-based studies should assess the performance of self-collection methods as used routinely and without supervision. Conclusion This study demonstrates that both urine and vaginal self-collection are feasible, acceptable, and diagnostically reliable methods for HPV detection in women with high-grade cervical lesions. Urine self-collection was the preferred method, highlighting its potential as a non-invasive and user-friendly option for expanding screening access. High concordance with clinician-collected samples confirms the clinical utility of these approaches. Furthermore, the strong positive response to instructional videos underscores the value of integrating educational tools to support self-collection and increase participation. These findings emphasize the value of adopting self-collection approaches within Brazil’s national screening framework.
