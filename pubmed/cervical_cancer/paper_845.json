Methods: For accurate CTGF mRNA expression assessment, 1728 samples were collected. Additionally, for uncovering potential signaling pathways, differentially co-expressed CTGF genes were employed. For exploring CTGF’s effects, its impact on immune microenvironment and drug sensitivity was studied. Results: CTGF mRNA was significantly underexpressed in BLCA (standardized mean difference [SMD] = −1.06, 95% CI: −1.89–0.23), and this downregulation was confirmed at the protein level ( p Conclusions: This study elucidated the low expression of CTGF in BLCA. CTGF may promotes tumor progression by remodeling the immune microenvironment and extracellular matrix. Additionally, its expression is positively correlated with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors and negatively correlated with resistance to PARP inhibitors. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY Bladder cancer (BLCA) is a common type of cancer, and despite the availability of multiple treatment approaches, its recurrence rate remains high. This study investigated a molecule named Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) to explore its potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target for BLCA treatment. Databases, such as TCGA, GEO, and HPA were utilized to examine the levels of CTGF in BLCA tissues. Additionally, computational tools were employed to investigate how CTGF regulates the progression of BLCA, immune infiltration in cancer tissues, and drug efficacy. Our results indicated that CTGF are significantly lower in BLCA tissues than in normal tissues. Mechanistic analysis suggested that CTGF and its related genes are involved in processes, such as motility, invasion, and regulation of the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, there were notable differences in the types of immune cell infiltration in BLCA tissues with varying CTGF expression levels, suggesting that CTGF is involved in the regulation between stromal control and immune response. Finally, drug sensitivity analysis revealed that CTGF expression was positively correlated with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors (e.g., Afatinib) and negatively correlated with resistance to PARP inhibitors (e.g., Olaparib). Overall, CTGF may be a valuable biomarker or target for BLCA treatment, but further research is needed to fully understand its clinical application. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS  Unlike most solid tumors, in BLCA, we found that CTGF is significantly downregulated at both mRNA transcription and protein levels, and high CTGF expression is associated with poor patient prognosis. It was found that significant differences in CTGF expression were observed across different patient’s ages, genders, pathological stages, tumor sizes (T), and lymph node metastasis (N). There are significant differences in the infiltration levels of CD4+ T cells, M0/M1/M2 macrophages, B cells, and other immune cells in BLCA tissues with varying CTGF expression levels. CTGF expression levels are positively correlated with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors (e.g., Afatinib) and negatively correlated with sensitivity to PARP inhibitors (e.g., Olaparib). These findings suggest that CTGF is associated with immune infiltration and drug therapy in BLCA, strongly supporting CTGF as a promising potential therapeutic target.

Introduction According to recent cancer statistics, bladder cancer (BLCA) ranks as the ninth most prevalent form of cancer globally, with an estimated 613,791 new cases and 220,349 deaths occurring annually. This accounts for approximately 3.1% of all new cancer diagnoses and 2.3% of cancer-related mortalities [ 1 2 3 4 In recent years, there has been a surge in research exploring the role of molecular markers in the diagnosis and treatment guidance of BLCA. For instance, tumors with infiltrating immune cells expressing PD-L1 have demonstrated better remission rates following treatment [ 5 6 7 Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF), commonly known as CCN2, is a highly adaptable signaling regulator that belongs to the secreted CCN protein family. This multifunctional molecule plays an instrumental role in numerous biological processes (BPs), including but not limited to wound healing, inflammatory reactions, cell adhesion, chemotaxis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and tissue fibrosis. By modulating a spectrum of biological activities, such as cell proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), CTGF significantly contributes to the initiation, progression, and metastatic potential of tumor, thereby positioning itself as a central figure in the intricate landscape of tumor biology [ 8 9 9 10 11 12 13 14 In BLCA research, functional enrichment analysis showed CTGF was significantly enriched in recurrent BLCA, with immunohistochemistry confirming its upregulation [ 15 16 17 18 8 19 We hypothesize that CTGF is involved in the mechanisms related to the occurrence and progression of BLCA. This study is designed to conduct a thorough investigation of CTGF protein and mRNA expression profiles in BLCA tissues, while also exploring the intricate relationships between CTGF and the immune microenvironment of BLCA, as well as its interactions with therapeutic interventions. Through the execution of these in-depth and all-encompassing analyses, we aspire to gain a deeper insight into the exact mechanistic pathways by which CTGF impacts the development and advancement of BLCA, along with the associated molecular changes. Furthermore, we seek to clearly elucidate the critical roles that CTGF plays in these complex processes. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data collection and processing for CTGF mRNA expression analysis In this study, CTGF mRNA expression data were sourced from several comprehensive databases, namely Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), ArrayExpress, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). To ensure data consistency and comparability, all mRNA expression datasets were normalized using the log2(x + 1) transformation and the “limma” package prior to analysis. In order to mitigate batch effects, we combined independent datasets that were generated on the same platform into a single, unified dataset. 2.2. Assessing the clinical significance of CTGF mRNA expression To effectively illustrate the distribution patterns and fluctuations of CTGF mRNA expression across various sample groups, violin plots were meticulously constructed utilizing R software version 4.4.1 (The University of Auckland). Subsequently, t 2.3. Evaluation of CTGF protein expression via This study received formal approval from the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, ensuring compliance with ethical standards and guidelines for human subject research (Approval No.: NO2023-S05701). Three tissue microarrays (BLC481, BLC1021, and BLC1501) were utilized for immunohistochemical staining to assess CTGF protein expression levels. These microarrays encompassed samples from 137 cases of BLCA to 33 cases of non-cancerous bladder tissue, with the latter sourced from adjacent cancerous or inflammatory bladder tissues. The results of the immunohistochemical staining were independently evaluated by two experienced pathologists. The scoring was based on both the intensity of the staining and the percentage of positive cells. The scoring criteria were as follows: a) staining intensity: 0 (no staining), 1 (weak staining), 2 (moderate staining), 3 (strong staining); b) percentage of positive cells: 0 (<5%), 1 (5%–25%), 2 (26%–50%), 3 (51%–75%), and 4 (76%–100%). The total staining score = staining intensity × percentage of positive cells. Subsequently, GraphPad Prism version 8.0 software was employed to conduct t via via 2.4.

The results revealed a significant difference in overall survival (OS) rates between patients with high and low CTGF expression. Specifically, patients in the high CTGF expression had significantly poorer OS compared to those in the low expression ( p Figure 1(C) p Table 2 Table 2.

Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of CTGF expression Next, an in-depth investigation into the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of CTGF expression was carried out. By utilizing the Cistrome Data Browser database, the top four TFs with the highest scores – RAD21, FOSL1, FOXA1, and SMC1A – were identified. Subsequently, the potential for these TFs to bind to the upstream TSS of CTGF and thereby regulate its expression was explored. ChIP-seq was then conducted on these TFs, and their binding sites upstream TSS of the CTGF were validated ( Figure 3(C) 3.6. Analysis of the correlation between CTGF expression levels and the immune microenvironment Based on the TCGA dataset, significant differences in eight immune cell subsets were found between cancerous and control tissue samples ( Figure 4(A) Figure 4(B) Figure 4(C) Figure S4 Figure 4.

Relationship between CTGF expression and drug sensitivity Next, the importance of CTGF in BLCA drug therapy was investigated, and its potential correlation with drug sensitivity in BLCA patients was explored. Significant differences in the sensitivity of 16 drugs were observed between the high-expression and low-expression groups. Decreased sensitivity to 14 drugs, including Dasatinib and Olaparib, was associated with high expression, while increased sensitivity to Afatinib and Erlotinib was noted ( Figure 5 Figure S5 Figure 5. The association between the differential expression (high/low) of CTGF and the responsiveness to drugs. 4. Discussion This study amalgamated an extensive array of sample resources from 24 distinct datasets across the globe, encompassing 1351 BLCA samples and 207 control bladder samples, to perform a thorough and in-depth analysis. This vast repository of data not only bolstered the statistical rigor of the study but also furnished substantial data support for unraveling the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying BLCA. First, in terms of expression, CTGF was found to be significantly downregulated in BLCA tissue compared to control bladder tissue. This finding contrasts sharply with previous reports in other tumor types, revealing CTGF as a potential key regulator in the development of BLCA and offering a new perspective for molecular subtyping and therapeutic target selection in BLCA. Second, with respect to mechanisms, epigenomic methods were employed to identify potential regulatory mechanisms governing CTGF expression. Third, the relationship between CTGF expression and immune microenvironment, potential signaling pathways, and drug sensitivity in patients with BLCA were concurrently investigated. Notably, the subgroup with downregulated CTGF expression exhibited significant differences in drug sensitivity, indicating that this molecule may act as a biomarker for forecasting treatment response. Consequently, it furnishes a vital molecular underpinning for the formulation of personalized treatment strategies tailored to BLCA. CTGF, a highly versatile secretory protein exhibiting a wide array of regulatory functions, plays a pivotal role in several critical pathological processes, including the modulation of fibrosis, the stimulation of cell proliferation, the induction of resistance mechanisms in tumor treatment, the promotion of tumor angiogenesis, and the augmentation of invasive and metastatic potential [ 8 9–12 in vitro in vivo 14 15 24 From a translational medicine perspective, the low-expression pattern of CTGF in BLCA may harbor the potential for developing novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Through ROC and SROC analyses, we found that CTGF expression levels demonstrated strong discriminative power in distinguishing BLCA from control bladder tissue (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.90–0.94). Moreover, CTGF expression significantly varied among different BLCA patients in terms of age, gender, and tumor stage. Additionally, significant differences in OS were observed between patients with different levels of CTGF expression. This indicates its potential as a biomarker for BLCA diagnosis or prognostic assessment. However, despite the rigorous statistical validation of this hypothesis in our study, the actual application of CTGF in clinical diagnosis still requires further validation, including larger-scale clinical cohort studies and the establishment of standardized detection methods for biomarkers. Second, in terms of mechanistic research, this study utilized epigenomic methods to reveal the potential regulatory mechanisms of CTGF expression. ChIP-seq validation identified binding sites upstream of the CTGF TSS for TFs such as RAD21, FOSL1, FOXA1, and SMC1A, suggesting that these TFs may be involved in regulating CTGF expression. This finding not only uncovers the complexity of CTGF expression regulation but also provides new targets for further investigating the role of CTGF in tumor progression mechanisms. With the aim of gaining a more in-depth understanding of the biological functions that CTGF exerts in BLCA, our study conducted an integrative multi-omics analysis, revealing the complex molecular network of CTGF in BLCA microenvironment regulation. KEGG pathway enrichment results showed that differentially co-expressed genes of CTGF significantly clustered in pathways, such as cytoskeleton in muscle cells, focal adhesion, and cGMP − PKG signaling pathway. These pathways play dual roles in BLCA progression: on one hand, dynamic changes in cytoskeleton remodeling and focal adhesion may lead to changes in the cellular microenvironment, thereby enhancing the migratory and invasive capabilities of cancer cells [ 25 26 27 28 29 30 Regarding the TME, for the first time, this study revealed the profound association between CTGF expression and the dynamic distribution of the immune microenvironment in BLCA. The TME, a complex system comprising the extracellular matrix, stromal cells, and immune cells, has been proven to have a decisive impact on cancer metastasis, prognosis, and therapy outcomes [ 31 32 15 5 33 34 Finally, our study found a significant association between CTGF expression and drug sensitivity in BLCA. Notably, the multifunctionality of CTGF extends beyond immune regulation. Previous studies have shown that this molecule plays a key role in paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer [ 35 36 37 38 39 5. Conclusions This study, utilizing multi-omics analysis and multi-center sample evaluations, unveiled the low-expression pattern of CTGF in BLCA. It was indicated that CTGF promotes tumor progression through the remodeling of the immune microenvironment and extracellular matrix. Moreover, it was discovered that CTGF expression is positively correlated with sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors (e.g., Afatinib) and negatively correlated with resistance to PARP inhibitors (e.g., Olaparib). Although the potential for clinical translation is substantial, there exists a necessity for the establishment of standardized detection systems and the exploration of combined treatment strategies. Future research endeavors will be directed toward the development of in vivo detection techniques for CTGF and the investigation of the mechanisms underlying immune combination therapies, with the aim of providing novel decision-making foundations for precision medicine in BLCA.
