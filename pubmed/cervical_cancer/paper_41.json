However, the discovery of the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatics has revolutionized our understanding of cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis and neuroimmune interactions. The glymphatic system facilitates perivascular cerebrospinal fluid–interstitial fluid exchange and promotes neurotoxic waste clearance, whereas meningeal lymphatics serve as conduits between the CNS and peripheral lymphatic circulation. Dysfunction in these lymphatic efflux pathways has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, traumatic brain injury, and intracranial hemorrhage, where impaired waste removal contributes to protein aggregation, neuroinflammation, and hence, disease onset and progression. Methods: Recent preliminary evidence suggests that surgical modulation of lymphatic drainage may offer novel therapeutic avenues for these disorders, with lymphatic microsurgery, particularly deep cervical lymphovenous anastomosis (LVA), proposed as an innovative procedure to enhance CNS lymphatic outflow. The first case reports in Alzheimer disease patients demonstrated not only the operative feasibility of LVA but also postoperative cognitive improvements. Despite these promising findings, systematic (pre)clinical studies remain scarce, calling for further research. Results: This article examined the role of the brain lymphatic system in neurological disorders and discussed the potential of lymphatic microsurgery as a novel therapeutic intervention. We also highlight ongoing clinical trials and potential future innovations, including surgical robotic assistance, and report on 2 cases of deep neck LVA for central lymphatic disorders. Conclusions: By combining neurolymphatic research with surgical advances, LVAs have the potential to redefine therapeutic paradigms in CNS disorder management. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes OPEN-ACCESS TRUE COUNTRY SWITZERLAND Takeaways Question: Findings: Meaning: INTRODUCTION The interplay between the central nervous system (CNS) and the lymphatic system has long been poorly understood. Historically, the brain was thought to be immune-privileged, lacking conventional lymphatic drainage. Histological evidence of lymphatic vessels could not be identified in the brain parenchyma, in part because of postmortem changes in the tissue. The blood-brain barrier was believed to prevent the diffusion of molecular and cellular components. However, the discovery of functional meningeal lymphatic vessels and the glymphatic system has redefined our understanding of CNS fluid dynamics, implicating lymphatic function in neurological health and disease. 1 2 1 3 5 The notion of “brain drain” via microsurgical optimization of cerebral lymphatic outflow may herald a new era in CNS disorder therapy; as reflected in the article’s title, this concept proposes that promoting lymphatic clearance from the brain (“drain”) could result in functional neurological improvement (“gain”). 6 7 7 9 LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE SYSTEM OF THE BRAIN Glymphatic System For a long time, the brain’s toxic metabolite removal was assumed to rely solely on intracellular degradation and slow diffusion across the blood-brain barrier. 2 10 1 2 Approximately 200 mL of CSF circulates within the brain, with complete turnover occurring roughly 4 times daily. 11 1 2 12 13 1 14 15 Meningeal Lymphatics Predominantly situated in the dura mater along the dural sinuses and the skull base, the meningeal lymphatic vessels provide a direct route for CSF drainage from the intracranial glymphatic to the peripheral lymphatic system. The meningeal lymphatic network seems to be located near the eyes, following a path above the olfactory bulb before settling alongside the sinuses and cranial nerves, and ultimately, exiting the cranium through foramina along with their respective structures. The meningeal lymphatic network is made up of narrower vessels. 10 10 Cervical Lymph Nodes Cervical lymph nodes (cLNs) represent the final checkpoint in the brain lymphatic clearance pathway, acting as an interface between waste originating from the CNS and the peripheral immune system (Fig. 1 16 10 17 18 16 19 20 14 Fig. 1. The glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic pathways in central nervous system clearance. Facilitated by astrocytic aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channels, CSF enters the brain parenchyma, mixes with ISF, and facilitates metabolic waste clearance. BRAIN LYMPHATIC IMPAIRMENT AND PATHOGENESIS OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS Neurological disorders pose a major burden for patients and the healthcare system. Recent research highlights the potential role of impaired lymphatic clearance in their pathogenesis, suggesting that disruptions in the brain’s waste removal systems may contribute to the accumulation of neurotoxic proteins and the progression of chronic inflammation. 1 5 18 21 30 Alzheimer Disease Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular Aβ plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. 31 32 20 Recent research revealed that the glymphatic system may be compromised in AD. 1 18 21 25 1 1 23 24 3 17 20 Parkinson Disease Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the pathological aggregation of misfolded proteins such as α‐synuclein. 33 5 26 28 34 27 34 5 Importantly, clinical studies, particularly with neuroimaging data, have also reported impaired neurolymphatic function in PD. 4 26 28 4 35 Traumatic Brain Injury Li et al 29 36 30 Intracranial Hemorrhage Liu et al 37 LYMPHATIC MICROSURGERY AS A THERAPEUTIC AVENUE Clinical Data Traditionally, the treatment of the aforementioned neurological conditions has primarily relied on pharmacological approaches. However, the discovery of a mechanical drainage component in their etiopathogenesis has drawn attention toward lymphatic microsurgical interventions, particularly cervical LVA. 38 39 41 In 2022, Lu et al 9 8 Although the pioneering work from China has laid a strong foundation, extensive preclinical studies and well-designed clinical trials are warranted. Several trials are underway to explore lymphatic supermicrosurgery in neurological disorders. Multiple prospective clinical trials investigating the effect of cervical LVAs in AD have been registered ( NCT06448442 NCT06448975 Yang et al 7 Numerous ongoing investigations in this field highlight the growing research momentum while emphasizing the pressing need for high-quality empirical data. A thorough preoperative assessment of the patient’s lymphatic function would, therefore, be essential to determine patient eligibility for the procedure. Histological evidence of lymphatic vessels could not be identified in the brain parenchyma, in part because of postmortem changes in the tissue. The blood-brain barrier was believed to prevent the diffusion of molecular and cellular components. Further research with objective, high-quality outcome studies remains indispensable to investigate both the safety and efficacy of LVA for the treatment of neurological disorders. Special consideration should be given to ethical concerns when planning clinical studies involving patients with neurodegenerative diseases or debilitating cranial injury, as these individuals represent a vulnerable patient population. Beyond the general ethical obligations inherent to surgical innovation, the application of lymphatic microsurgery in neurological disorders poses specific challenges. Informed consent must be carefully tailored to account for potential cognitive impairment, and surrogate decision-making may be necessary in select cases. Transparent communication of the experimental nature of the intervention, as well as the lack of large-scale efficacy data, is essential to avoid therapeutic misconception. Furthermore, equitable access to such advanced surgical options—including those involving costly robotic assistance—must be proactively addressed to prevent widening disparities in neurological care. Robotic-assisted Lymphatic Microsurgery Given the small diameter of many lymphatic vessels (<0.5 mm), LVAs require high-magnification microscopes and specialized microsurgical instrumentation. The use of robotic systems, such as the MUSA robot (MicroSure B.V., Son, The Netherlands) and the Symani Surgical System (Medical Microinstruments [MMI], Jacksonville, FL), is well established in the surgical treatment of lymphedema and central lymphatic lesions. 42 46 47 2 48 50 See Video [online] Fig. 2. Deep cervical LVAs.

B, (1) LVA of thoracic duct anterograde end-to-side to collateral external jugular vein, (2) LVA of thoracic duct retrograde end-to-end to collateral vein, and (3) multiple LVAs of deep lymphatic collectors draining the head in the left neck.

The acquisition and maintenance costs of robotic systems remain high, yet increasing acceptance and technological dissemination could lower costs over time. 53 59 60 61 45 The convergence of these 2 emerging fields—robotic supermicrosurgery and lymphatic reconstruction for the management of neurological disorders—holds immense potential for advancing treatment strategies and redefining therapeutic paradigms. Robotic assistance enables greater precision in manipulating delicate lymphatic structures, improving the efficacy of lymphatic reconstruction not only in the extremities but also potentially in the cervical region. In this context, it is also worth noting that if surgical intervention on the glymphatic system were ever to be performed, the use of robotic assistance would be practically mandatory due to its minuscule size of less than 100 µm. 62 CONCLUSIONS The discovery of the brain’s lymphatic system has revolutionized our understanding of CSF homeostasis and neuroimmune regulation, providing novel insights into the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. Impaired glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic drainage is increasingly recognized as a major factor in the accumulation of neurotoxic proteins, neuroinflammation, and progressive neuronal dysfunction. In this context, lymphatic supermicrosurgery—particularly deep cervical LVA—has emerged as a promising intervention to enhance CNS lymphatic clearance and facilitate the removal of toxic waste products from the brain. Early clinical reports suggested that LVA is not only technically feasible but may also improve cognitive function in select patients with AD. Despite these encouraging preliminary findings, thorough scientific validation remains imperative. The available evidence is limited to case reports, and further clinical studies are needed to elucidate the precise mechanistic impact of LVA on CNS fluid dynamics and its long(er)-term therapeutic potential. Future research should also focus on refining patient selection criteria, maximizing surgical safety—potentially incorporating robotic-assisted microsurgery—and exploring synergistic therapeutic strategies, including pharmacological modulation of lymphatic function. Given the nascent stage of this field, this article synthesizes early clinical insights with emerging experimental evidence and distinguishes between hypothesis and data, aiming to provide a structured, scientifically grounded framework for future investigation. To minimize potential bias and avoid overinterpretation, we have contextualized subjective observations and highlighted the need for robust, controlled, and objective studies moving forward. Ultimately, widespread clinical adoption will depend on the generation of high-quality, objective evidence from well-designed trials. However, unlocking the full potential of lymphatic supermicrosurgery is not merely a surgical challenge but a watershed moment in redefining brain health itself. If successful, LVA could herald a new era—one in which restoring the brain’s intrinsic clearance mechanisms becomes a cornerstone of neurological disorder therapy, offering hope where there are currently few options.
