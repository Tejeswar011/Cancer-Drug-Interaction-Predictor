However, the inability of traditional anti-cancer drugs to specifically target tumor cells not only leads to serious systemic side effects but also limits their therapeutic effects. In recent years, nanoparticle drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, polymeric micelles, and multimers, have attracted extensive research attention in the field of antitumor drug carriers due to their unique drug loading capacity, targeted delivery characteristics, and controllable release performance 1 3 4 5 6 7 Particle size is an important parameter for efficient delivery of nanocarriers to tumor sites, as well as for their high adsorption on the tumor cell surface, cellular uptake and intracellular transport, which eventually determine the efficacy of chemotherapy 8 10 11 13 14 16 17 Mesoporous silica is biodegradable, and the degradation product, silicic acid, can be absorbed and excreted through the urinary system. Lee 18 in vitro 19 20 22 Lipid-shell and mesoporous silica core nanoparticles (LMSNs) combine the characteristics of nanoparticles and liposomes. The dual vesicular and particulate structure is associated with high biocompatibility, stability and favorable pharmacokinetic profile 23 24 25 26 in vivo 27 in vivo in vivo Materials and Methods Materials Paclitaxel (PTX) was purchased from Hainan Yayuan Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Hainan, China), ethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China), cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was from McLean Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China), NaHCO 3 Synthesis of mesoporous silica core-lipid bilayer shell nanoparticles The preparation of MSNs started by dissolving 1.5 g of CTAB and K 2 4 3 2 The description of lipid-modified MSNs is shown in Table 1 28 29 30 Characterization of nanoparticles The morphology of MSNs was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7500F, JEOL, Japan) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1400, JEOL, Japan), and the morphology of PTX-LMSNs was observed by TEM. MSNs were gilded before being observed under a scanning electron microscope. The MSNs were dispersed in deionized water to a concentration of 2 mg/mL prior to TEM examination, while the PTX-LMSNs were diluted by 10 times. The particle size and polydispersion index (PDI) of PTX-LMSNs were measured by a Delsa Nano C (Beckman Coulter, USA), and their morphology was observed under a transmission electron microscope. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption was analyzed by a JW-BK 132F specific surface area and porosity analyzer (Beijing, China). The specific surface area was calculated by Brunauere-Emmette-Teller (BET) method, and the cumulative pore volume was calculated by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model.

C57 Mice were depilated and anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 1.3 g/kg uratan solution (> 98%, 65mg/mL), and injected intravenously with 0.1 mL of fluorescent Rhodamine-LMSNs. The mice were imaged at 5, 30, 120 and 360 min post-injection and euthanized for 6 h after imaging. The heart, liver, spleen, lungs and kidneys were dissected, washed with deionized water and placed in a Petri dish. The tissues were imaged at an excitation wavelength of 550 nm and an emission wavelength of 600 nm for a fixed exposure time of 0.1 s. After the experiment, the mice were euthanized by cervical spondylolysis. Pharmacokinetics analysis Animal experiments have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Guangdong Pharmaceutical University and comply with the ARRIVE guidelines and were carried out in accordance with the U.K. Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and associated guidelines, and EU Directive 2010/63/EU for animal experiments. SD Rats were fasted and weighed 12 h before the experiment. The animals were randomly divided into two groups (6 per group, equal number of male and female) and injected with 20 mg/kg PTX-LMSNs via the tail vein. Blood samples (250 µL) were collected via the retroorbital route at 0, 0.083, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h post-injection and placed in heparin-coated tubes. After the experiment, rats were euthanized by inhaling CO 2 Statistical analysis SPSS17.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis. The data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Comparison of the tested samples with the control samples was carried out by analysis of variance and t-test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Characterization of MSNs and PTX-LMSNs MSNs were morphologically characterized by SEM and TEM. As shown in the SEM images in Figure 1 1 1 As shown in Figure 2 2 2 2 According to the IUPAC nomenclature, the adsorption of MSNs belongs to a typical type IV isotherm 32 Drug loading and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of PTX-LSNs The DL and EE of PTX-LMSNs were 21.75 ± 4.28% and 96.36 ± 1.93%, respectively. This may be due to the fact that most drug molecules were loaded into the mesoporous silica pores, and only a few of them were adsorbed on the outer surface; these may cause a small amount of drug to dissociate into the solution during the preparation of lipid layer. The high drug loading and high encapsulation efficiency of PTX-LMSNs make them have significant clinical translational value, which can improve the therapeutic effect of paclitaxel and reduce the toxicity and side effects, providing a new strategy for the clinical application of tumor targeted therapy. In vitro Unlike weakly alkaline healthy tissues, tumors have a low pH due to the Warburg effect wherein the increase of oxygen consumption leads to the production of acidic metabolites 33 3 34 Biodistribution of antitumor drug in mice Distribution and fluorescence intensity of PTX-LMSNs in mice are illustrated in Figure 4 Organs were removed 6 h after administering with the PTX-LMSNs and subjected to ex vivo 5 The pharmacokinetic parameters of Taxol and the PTX-LMSNs were fitted by DAS software with the two-compartment model and are summarized in Table 2 6 in vivo Conclusions We successfully prepared PTX-LMSNs by fusing liposomes with MSNs. PTX-MSNs were sensitive to low pH, making them ideal drug carriers for the acidic TME, as they could be controlled to release the drug cargo in a pH-responsive manner. The targeted delivery of the drug cargo to the tumor site improves therapeutic efficacy while minimizing damage to normal tissues.
