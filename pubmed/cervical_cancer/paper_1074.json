Hormonal fluctuations in women, during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, menopause, and with oral contraceptive use, may alter the composition and behavior of oral biofilm, increasing susceptibility to gingival inflammation and periodontal disease. Conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), osteoporosis, and pregnancy-associated gingivitis further demonstrate the influence of endocrine factors on oral health. In men, higher rates of severe periodontitis are observed, potentially linked to testosterone-related immune responses and behavioral factors with associations to lower sperm counts, increased incidence of prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction. These distinctions underscore the importance of considering sex-specific biology in both the prevention and management of oral and systemic diseases influenced by biofilm.

The mechanisms of biofilm-related oral inflammation are well-documented, with increasing research suggesting the impact of oral biofilm may differ significantly between women and men, being influenced by biological sex, hormonal variations, and gender-specific behaviors (Figure 1 Figure 1 Bacteria in the oral biofilm have a connection to the reproductive systems in men and women, with transmission through the circulatory system to those distant systemic areas. This Illustration is created by the lead author, Gregori M. Kurtzman, of this study. In women, fluctuating hormone levels during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause can alter the oral microbiome, increasing susceptibility to gingival inflammation and periodontal disease. Additionally, conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), osteoporosis, and pregnancy-associated gingivitis highlight a unique interplay between systemic endocrine health and oral microbial ecology. Men, on the other hand, tend to experience a higher prevalence of severe periodontal disease, potentially due to a combination of behavioral factors. Those behaviors include lower dental care utilization and biological differences in immune response. Moreover, associations between periodontitis and systemic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and erectile dysfunction raise important considerations for male-specific health risks tied to chronic oral inflammation. This article explores the gender-specific implications of oral biofilm, with a focus on the differential immune, hormonal, and behavioral factors that influence oral-systemic health outcomes in women and men. Understanding these distinctions is critical for developing targeted preventive and therapeutic strategies that address the unique needs of each population. Oral biofilm: a central player in oral and systemic disease Oral biofilm, also referred to as dental plaque, is a densely structured, multi-species microbial community embedded within a protective extracellular matrix. The extracellular matrix is polymeric in nature and is of both host and bacterial origin. That matrix enables the bacteria to adhere to tooth surfaces and provides resistance to salivary flow, host immune mechanisms, and antimicrobial agents. This protective environment, referred to as “pathogenic synergism,” allows microorganisms to persist, adapt, and initiate disease processes both locally and systemically. The oral environment hosts over 700 bacterial species, with early colonizers such as Streptococcus sanguinis Streptococcus mutans 1 2 Porphyromonas gingivalis Tannerella forsythia Treponema denticola Fusobacterium nucleatum 3 4 5 6 7 8 Quorum sensing, an interbacterial communication mechanism, regulates gene expression, biofilm development, and pathogenic behaviors, such as the release of enzymes and toxins [ 9 10 11 12 Beyond localized periodontal damage, oral biofilm contributes to systemic inflammation and has been implicated in conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, respiratory illness, osteoporosis, and numerous other health conditions [ 13 14 15 16 Understanding the complex interplay between oral biofilm, host immunity, and systemic health is essential for developing more effective prevention and treatment strategies. As research continues to uncover these connections, personalized and interdisciplinary care will become increasingly important in improving patient outcomes. Review Female puberty and gingival inflammation The onset of puberty in females is accompanied by significant increases in circulating sex hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone. These hormonal changes influence the gingival tissues and the host's immune response, heightening gingival sensitivity to local irritants. As a result, minimal amounts of oral biofilm can trigger an exaggerated inflammatory response, characterized by gingival enlargement, increased gingival bleeding, and crevicular fluid flow and microbial changes commonly referred to as puberty-associated gingivitis [ 17 PCOS patients presented altered hormone levels, with elevated carbohydrate and lipid profiles. Additionally, those patients with PCOS present with more pronounced gingivitis than other patients. Those patients' neutrophils exhibit hyperactivity, which promotes interaction with the endothelium, potentially contributing to atherosclerotic disease [ 18 Poor oral hygiene plays a central role in amplifying these conditions [ 19 Prevotella intermedia Preventive care during puberty is critical. Emphasizing effective plaque control through regular brushing and flossing, along with professional dental cleanings and patient education, can significantly reduce gingival inflammation. Addressing oral hygiene habits early helps mitigate hormonally influenced gingival changes and reduces the risk of long-term periodontal complications. Additionally, early oral hygiene training aids in those home care skills becoming habits and influencing the patient's lifetime overall health. Hormonal influence on gum health Hormonal fluctuations throughout the female lifespan, particularly during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, have a significant impact on periodontal health [ 20 21 22 During puberty, the rise in sex hormones leads to increased gingival sensitivity and an exaggerated inflammatory response. Similarly, during menstruation, some women may experience cyclical gingival changes, including periodic gingival swelling or bleeding. During pregnancy, elevated hormone levels, particularly during the second and third trimesters, may contribute to pregnancy gingivitis. In some cases, pyogenic granuloma formation may present, which often resolves postpartum but can be influenced by poor oral hygiene. Conversely, the decline in estrogen during menopause is associated with reduced salivary flow, altered oral microbial composition, and an increased risk for gingival atrophy and subsequent alveolar bone loss. Women who are postmenopausal may experience “menopausal gingivostomatitis,” which is characterized by easily bleeding, dry, and shiny gingiva [ 23 Understanding the role of hormonal influence on oral health is essential for early intervention and personalized dental care. Preventive strategies should be tailored to each hormonal life stage. Emphasizing oral biofilm control, regular periodontal assessments, and coordination between medical and dental providers is essential when systemic hormonal therapies are involved. This integrated approach can help preserve oral health and improve quality of life across the patient’s lifespan. Menstrual cycle and periodontal changes The menstrual cycle, characterized by cyclical fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone, can exert a measurable influence on periodontal tissues [ 24 Progesterone levels peak and estrogen levels decline during premenstruation [ 25 26 27 Patients reporting cyclic bleeding or gingival discomfort during their menstrual cycle should be clinically evaluated by the dentist. Education on the interplay between hormonal cycles and periodontal health is essential, particularly for adolescent and reproductive-aged females, to encourage consistent oral hygiene practices and reduce the risk of chronic periodontal disease. Menopause, oral biofilm, and bone loss Menopause represents a significant physiological transition marked by a decline in estrogen production, having far-reaching effects on systemic and oral health. The reduction in estrogen levels during and after menopause contributes to changes in the periodontium, leading to increased susceptibility to oral biofilm accumulation, periodontal inflammation, and alveolar bone loss [ 28 Estrogen has an important role in maintaining the integrity of the oral mucosa, vascular tone, and bone metabolism. Its deficiency results in decreased salivary flow, altered oral microbial composition, and thinning of the oral epithelium, which facilitates the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria within the oral biofilm. Those microbial changes, combined with a reduced mucosal barrier function due to thinning of the gingival tissue, increase the host's vulnerability to periodontal disease. A critical consequence of estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women is the acceleration of alveolar bone resorption, similar to the mechanism observed in osteoporosis. That imbalance between osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity in the bone of the jaw leads to reduced bone density and structural deterioration (osteoporosis) [ 29 30 31 Management strategies to address menopausal hormonal oral tissue changes should include targeted periodontal care, rigorous biofilm control, and interprofessional collaboration with physicians managing hormonal or antiresorptive therapies. Adjunctive use of antimicrobial rinses, salivary substitutes, and hormone replacement therapy (when indicated) may provide additional benefits. Given the increasing aging population, understanding and addressing the oral-systemic implications of menopause is essential for preserving both periodontal and systemic bone health. Oral contraceptives and gum health The use of oral contraceptives, particularly those containing synthetic estrogen and progestin, can influence periodontal health by altering the host’s vascular and immune response to oral biofilm. Similar to hormonal fluctuations observed during pregnancy, puberty, and menopause, exogenous sex hormones introduced by oral contraceptives may increase gingival inflammation, even in the presence of minimal biofilm accumulation. Estrogen and progestin in oral contraceptives promote increased vascular permeability and capillary dilation within the gingival tissues [ 32 Prevotella intermedia 33 34 35 Importantly, oral hygiene care plays a role in those outcomes. Women using oral contraceptives with poor biofilm control are at a significantly greater risk of developing hormonally exacerbated gingivitis or early periodontitis. In contrast, effective oral hygiene home care and regular dental care can mitigate those effects, supporting periodontal stability. Pregnancy-related gingivitis and periodontitis Pregnancy induces profound hormonal, immunological, and vascular changes that can significantly impact periodontal health [ 36 Pregnancy gingivitis is the most common oral manifestation during gestation, which is characterized by gingival erythema, edema, bleeding on brushing or probing, and increased gingival crevicular fluid. Those changes are primarily due to hormone-induced vascular permeability and a shift in immune regulation, which heightens host response to the oral biofilm’s microorganisms. Alterations in oral microbiota, such as increased levels of Prevotella intermedia Pre-eclampsia is the second most frequent direct source of maternal mortality. Periodontitis appears as a significant risk factor for pre-eclampsia [ 37 38 Clinical management of pregnancy gingivitis includes early identification and treatment of gingival inflammation, ideally beginning with preconception care or during the first trimester. Non-surgical periodontal therapy, such as scaling and root planing, is considered safe during pregnancy, preferably in the second trimester, and is effective in reducing inflammation and microbial load. Education on oral hygiene practices, nutritional counseling, and coordination with obstetric care providers are essential components of comprehensive prenatal care. Recognizing pregnancy as a critical window for periodontal intervention offers a dual opportunity, improving maternal oral health and potentially mitigating systemic risks for both the mother and the developing fetus. Maintaining oral health during the peak of hormone release, such as pregnancy, helps alleviate the symptoms of periodontal disease as well as reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, although studies report conflicting results [ 39 Preterm pregnancy issues Preterm birth is defined as delivery before 37 completed weeks of gestation. This remains a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality globally. This is associated with a range of short- and long-term complications, including respiratory distress syndrome, neurological developmental impairments, and an increased risk of chronic health conditions later in life [ 40 41 42 Periodontal pathogens and their byproducts, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis Prevention and early management of risk factors for preterm birth should include comprehensive prenatal care, screening for systemic infections, and addressing modifiable lifestyle and health behaviors [ 43 Periodontal disease and sperm quality Emerging evidence has drawn attention to the potential systemic effects of periodontal disease beyond the oral cavity, including its association with male reproductive health [ 44 45 The pathogenesis of periodontitis involves a dysbiotic oral microbiota triggering a sustained host immune response, leading to elevated systemic levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP). These inflammatory mediators may disrupt hormonal regulation and spermatogenesis, potentially impairing sperm motility, morphology, and concentration. Additionally, periodontal pathogens and their endotoxins, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis 46 Routine periodontal evaluation should be considered in the broader assessment of male infertility, particularly in cases of idiopathic subfertility. Improving periodontal health through non-surgical therapy, antimicrobial interventions, and patient education may serve as an adjunctive strategy in enhancing male reproductive outcomes [ 47 Oral biofilm and testosterone-related immune function Oral biofilm's interaction with host immune function is complex and can be modulated by systemic hormonal factors, including testosterone, a cholesterol-derived molecule [ 48 Testosterone has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties by modulating the activity of various immune cells. It reduces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and down-regulates the activation of macrophages and dendritic cells. While this immunosuppressive action may confer protection against excessive tissue-damaging inflammation, it may also impair the immune system’s ability to mount an effective response against pathogenic oral bacteria. Consequently, men with higher circulating testosterone levels may exhibit a blunted inflammatory response to oral biofilm, potentially allowing for deeper microbial invasion and progression of periodontal disease [ 49 50 Understanding the interplay between testosterone and the immune response to oral biofilm is critical for developing personalized approaches to periodontal care. Future research exploring testosterone replacement therapy and its effect on periodontal parameters may offer novel insights into endocrine-immune-microbial interactions in oral health. Integrating hormonal assessment into periodontal risk profiling could enhance disease prevention and management strategies in hormonally influenced populations. Oral biofilm and prostate cancer Recent research suggests a potential link between chronic oral infections, particularly periodontitis, and the development or progression of prostate cancer. When dysbiosis occurs within the oral microbiome, this triggers a chronic inflammatory response that may extend beyond the oral cavity, influencing systemic health. Prostate cancer and periodontitis share several biological mechanisms, most notably the role of chronic inflammation [ 51 Porphyromonas gingivalis Fusobacterium nucleatum Additionally, some bacterial species within oral biofilms produce virulence factors capable of disrupting epithelial barriers, inducing oxidative stress, and modulating androgen metabolism, which may play roles in prostate carcinogenesis. The oral-prostate axis remains an emerging area of investigation, but preliminary findings support the hypothesis that maintaining periodontal health could be a modifiable risk factor in prostate cancer prevention and management [ 52 53 Oral biofilm and erectile dysfunction Recent attention focusing on a potential link between oral biofilm-induced inflammation and erectile dysfunction (ED) has been reported in the literature [ 54 55 Oral pathogens such as Porphyromonas gingivalis Treponema denticola Studies have also demonstrated that periodontal therapy may lead to measurable improvement in erectile function, as assessed by International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) scores, suggesting that oral health may be a modifiable factor in ED management [ 56 57 Biofilm control strategies and adjunctive therapies Managing oral biofilm effectively requires a dual approach - consistent professional dental care combined with consistent patient-driven oral hygiene home care. While daily brushing and flossing remain foundational, this has anatomical limitations. Toothbrush bristles generally access only 3-4 mm beneath the gingival (gum) margin, and dental floss typically reaches just 1-2 mm into the sulcus. Additionally, oral irrigators often fail to adequately penetrate into deeper periodontal pockets [ 58 59 60 61 62 63 Dental prostheses, such as full or partial dentures, also accumulate biofilm and pose a significant risk for aspiration-related infections, particularly among elderly or medically compromised individuals. Regular cleaning using a denture brush in combination with chlorine dioxide rinses may lower the risk of respiratory infections associated with oral biofilm in this population. Photobiomodulation (PBM) is another promising adjunctive therapy commonly referred to as low-level laser therapy. PBM employs red to near-infrared wavelengths to penetrate soft tissues, providing an anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effect in areas that mechanical tools often fail to reach [ 64 65 66 68 Together, these mechanical, chemical, and light-based strategies offer a comprehensive, evidence-supported approach to biofilm management. Integrating these modalities that are tailored to patient needs can enhance periodontal stability and reduce the systemic risks associated with chronic oral inflammation. Discussion Growing evidence underscores the significant role oral biofilm plays not only in the progression of periodontal disease but also in contributing to systemic health conditions, with distinct patterns emerging between genders. The chronic inflammatory burden triggered by biofilm-associated pathogens has been linked to a range of systemic disorders. Hormonal, behavioral, and immunological differences between men and women further shape those outcomes. Sex-based differences in oral and systemic health reflect the complex interplay between hormonal regulation, immune response, behavior, and the oral microbiome. In women, fluctuations in sex hormone levels during key life stages are associated with notable shifts in the composition and activity of the oral microbiota. These endocrine changes can heighten inflammatory responses within gingival tissues, increasing susceptibility to gingivitis and periodontal disease. Various clinical conditions, such as pregnancy-associated gingivitis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and postmenopausal osteoporosis, underscore the bidirectional relationship between systemic endocrine function and periodontal status. Notably, estrogen deficiency has been implicated in altered bone metabolism and connective tissue remodeling, potentially contributing to alveolar bone resorption and progressive periodontal breakdown. In contrast, men exhibit a consistently higher prevalence of moderate to severe periodontitis compared to women, a disparity attributed to both behavioral and biological factors. Delayed utilization of dental care, higher rates of tobacco use, and poorer oral hygiene practices are more commonly observed among male patients. Furthermore, gender-based differences in immune regulation may predispose men to more aggressive periodontal tissue destruction. Beyond oral implications, chronic periodontitis in men has been linked to an elevated risk of systemic inflammatory conditions, including cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction. These associations suggest the presence of shared inflammatory pathways and reinforce the importance of periodontal health as a component of broader systemic disease prevention and management. Gender-specific patterns highlight the importance of integrating oral health into systemic disease prevention strategies. Tailored approaches that consider hormonal influences, health behaviors, and gender-based biological differences are essential for effective prevention and management. Medical professionals should be attuned to these distinctions and collaborate with dental providers to deliver personalized care that addresses the broader systemic health implications of oral biofilm and periodontal disease. A comprehensive biofilm management plan that incorporates routine dental professional care, individualized patient education, and improved home care therapies can mitigate systemic inflammation and improve overall health outcomes. Recognizing oral biofilm as a shared risk factor for both genders, but with distinct manifestations and consequences, reinforces the need for gender-informed strategies in both clinical practice and public health policy. Conclusions Oral biofilm is increasingly recognized as a modifiable risk factor with systemic implications that differ between women and men. Gender-specific health conditions have been linked to chronic inflammation and microbial dysbiosis associated with periodontal disease. Those associations are mediated through systemic inflammatory responses, hormonal influences, and microbial translocation from the oral environment to distant systemic locations. Improved patient education and adherence to evidence-based oral homecare routines are key to disrupting oral biofilm and reducing the systemic inflammatory burden. However, patient efforts alone are insufficient. The dentist plays a critical role in the early identification and management of periodontal disease. Periodontal interventions should be considered integral to preventing biofilm-associated systemic complications. Integrating oral healthcare into broader medical care is especially important when addressing gender-specific health risks. Collaboration between medical and dental professionals can aid in bridging gaps in care. This ensures that conditions influenced by oral inflammation are more effectively prevented or managed.
