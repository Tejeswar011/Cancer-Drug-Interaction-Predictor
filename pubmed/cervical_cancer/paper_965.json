In comparison to ultrasonography, CT offers superior advantages in observing\ncentral lymph node metastasis, invasion of neighboring tissues and organs, and\ncoarse calcification ( 17 19 20 21 It is worth noting that the researchers have gradually changed their focus to basic\nresearch of PTC in recent years, with the aim to find PTC-related genes or small\nmolecules, which have been suggested by the American Thyroid Association Guide to\nhave the potential to assist in the diagnosis of PTC ( 22 BRAF V600E 23 24 BRAF V600E 25 BRAF V600E BRAF V600E 26 At present, there are few clinical reports about US-FNAB, CT and BRAF V600E BRAF V600E BRAF V600E SUBJECTS AND METHODS Ethics statement This study was reviewed and approved by the Academic Ethics Committee of Hunan\nProvincial People’s Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Normal\nUniversity (2019-1223), and was in line with the Declaration of Helsinki and the\nEnhancing the Quality and Transparency Of health Research network guidelines.\nAll subjects were informed of the purpose of the study and signed the informed\nconsent forms. Sample size estimation In this study, sample size estimation was conducted using the G*Power 3.0.10\nsoftware (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf, Germany)\n( Supplementary Figure\n1 t P Research subjects This study included 372 patients with thyroid nodules who visited the outpatient\ndepartment of Hunan Provincial People’s Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital\nof Hunan Normal University from January 2020 to March 2023. According to the\ninclusion criteria, 346 patients were included, among which 46 patients were\nexcluded as per the exclusion criteria. Finally, 300 patients were selected as\nthe study subjects, among which 184 patients who conformed to the diagnostic\ncriteria of PTC in the American Guidelines for the Clinical Diagnosis and\nTreatment of Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer, and were\ndiagnosed as PTC by postoperative histopathological examination were included as\nthe PTC group, and 116 patients who were definitely diagnosed as nodular goiter\n(NG) of benign lesions were enrolled as the NG group. Inclusion and exclusion criteria The inclusion criteria were as below: ( 1 BRAF V600E 2 3 4 5 6 The exclusion criteria were as follows: ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 PTC pathological diagnostic criteria were as follows: PTC patients were diagnosed\nby clinical pathological examination, as evidenced by the papillary structure of\ndifferent sizes, solid nest-like focal area, glassy or transparent cell nuclei\nwithin pseudo-inclusion bodies and nuclear grooves, and balanced distribution of\nfine-grained chromatin; besides, interstitial fibrous tissues displayed\nhyperplasia along with obvious hyalinization under the microscope, and the mass\nwas hard, with gray-brown surface and grayish-white cut surface. Data collection Clinical baseline data including age, sex, body mass index (BMI) and puncture\nsite of all study subjects, as well as the number of tumors, tumor diameter,\ncapsule invasion, lymphatic metastasis, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging and\nthe results of pathologic examination from US-FNAB, CT and BRAF V600E US-FNAB test Subjects were kept in the supine position, with the neck elevated to fully reveal\nthe puncture site. The nodule to be examined was punctured under the\nlocalization using a Color Doppler Ultrasonography diagnostic instrument (VIVID\n5, Massachusetts, GE, USA). The orientation of the puncture needle was changed\nunder negative pressure conditions, and the specimen was absorbed utilizing the\nrapid fan-shaped multi-point puncture method, with the specimen repeatedly\nabsorbed ≥ 5 times. After the elimination of the negative pressure and\nremoval of the needle, the puncture point was pressed using a sterile cotton\nball for 5 min. A part of the specimen was quickly coated and fixed for\ncytology, while the other part of the tissue was injected into the pathology\nspecimen bottle and stored at 2-8 °C for genetic test. US-FNAB operations were\nperformed by the same senior ultrasound physician using a unified puncture\nmethod (rapid fan-shaped multi-point puncture method). The US-FNAB outcomes were\ninterpreted by a senior pathologist according to the Bethesda diagnostic system\ndeveloped by the Thyroid Association of the National Cancer Institute of\nAmerica, and were reviewed blindly by two senior pathologists. In this study,\nthe positive results of US-FNAB were defined as follows: the results of the\npuncture report suggested that it was suspected to be PTC or consistent with the\nmanifestations of papillary carcinoma cells (pieces of hyperplastic thyroid\nfollicular epithelial cells could be seen, with crowded cell arrangement, and\nvisible multinucleated giant cells, intranuclear pseudoinclusions and nuclear\ngrooves). It was considered negative if the aforementioned description was not\nobserved. CT detection All metal material items on the patient were removed, and the patient was then\nkept in a supine position, with the neck extended back as far as possible to\nfully expose the thyroid gland in the anterior region of the neck. Before the\nexamination, the patients were instructed to hold his breath and not swallow. A\n256-slice spiral CT scanner (Brilliance ICT, Philips, Amsterdam, Netherlands)\nwas applied with a scanning pitch of 1.00, a layer thickness of 5.00 mm, and a\nlayer spacing of 5.00 mm. The scanning range was from the horizontal plane of\nthe mandible to the sternoclavicular joint. Elder patients were supposed to have\na limited extension to avoid obstruction of vertebral artery blood flow. After a\nthyroid CT scan examination, patients were injected with a contrast agent by\nnurses to perform an enhanced CT scan of the thyroid gland. Ioversol was used as\na contrast agent, which was injected into the elbow vein at a flow rate of\n2.00-3.00 mL/s using a high-pressure syringe. CT images were used for diagnosis\nby two experienced physicians using a double-blind method. In case of\ndisagreement of the diagnosis results, they needed to discuss to reach a\nunanimous conclusion. BRAF V600E On the day of specimen collection, DNA was extracted from histopathological\nspecimens collected through the US-FNAB test, and BRAF V600E BRAF V600E BRAF V600E Statistical analysis Statistical analyses and graphing were conducted on data using SPSS 21.0\nstatistical software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and MedCalc 19.0 software\n(MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). Normal distribution was tested using the\nShapiro-Wilk test. Measurement data in line with normal distribution were\nrepresented in the form of mean ± standard deviation. Comparisons between\ngroups were implemented using an independent sample t BRAF V600E P P RESULTS Baseline data characteristics We compared and analyzed the clinical baseline data of patients between the PTC\ngroup and the NG group. There were no statistically significant differences in\nclinical baseline data, including age, BMI, sex, puncture site and nodule\nnumber, between the two groups ( Table\n1 P Table 1 General information of the enrolled population PTC group NG group P Age (years) 43.02 ± 11.32 42.96 ± 10.63 0.512 BMI (kg/m 2 21.20 ± 2.23 21.07 ± 3.19 0.211 Sex (male) 30 (16.30%) 28 (24.14%) 0.101 Puncture site Left side 70 (38.04%) 41 (35.34%) 0.892 Right side 69 (37.50%) 45 (38.79%) Bilateral 45 (24.46%) 30 (25.86%) Number of nodules Single 114 (61.96%) 66 (56.90%) 0.399 Multiple 70 (38.04%) 50 (43.10%) Note: BMI, body mass index.
