However, it is not known in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This study aimed to elucidate the roles and mechanisms of NAT10 in tumor malignancy and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in PDAC. Methods NAT10 expression and its role in tumor progression and clinical prognosis were analyzed using bioinformatics and functional assays. Downstream genes regulated by NAT10 and their underlying mechanisms were explored using acetylated RNA immunoprecipitation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, RNA immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting. The role and mechanism of NAT10 in the PDAC TME were further explored using bioinformatics, single‐cell RNA sequencing, multiplexed immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. The association between NAT10 and immunotherapeutic response was investigated in a mouse model by inhibiting the programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1(PD‐1/PD‐L1) axis with a PD‐1/PD‐L1 binding inhibitor, Naamidine J. Results NAT10 was upregulated in PDAC tissues and cell lines, and was associated with poor progression‐free survival of PDAC patients. NAT10 promoted tumor progression by enhancing the mRNA stability of laminin β3 (LAMB3) via N4‐acetylation modification, thereby activating the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) pathway. NAT10 promoted subcutaneous tumor growth, increased the proportion of exhausted CD8 + + + + + + + + + Conclusions This study proposes a regulatory role of NAT10 in tumor progression and immune microenvironment via the LAMB3/FAK/ERK pathway in PDAC. These findings may favor the selection of candidates who may benefit from immunotherapy, optimize current therapeutic strategies, and improve the clinical prognosis of PDAC patients.

It is characterized by late diagnosis and poor 5‐year survival (∼9%) due to recurrence and distant metastasis [ 1 2 3 The recent breakthroughs of immunotherapy through immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have substantially changed therapeutic paradigms in several types of cancers with considerable survival benefits [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Epigenetic modifications, such as RNA modifications, play a crucial role in regulating molecular function, including N6‐methyladenosine (m 6 1 5 7 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 6 LncRNA 00662 36 In addition, ac4C plays vital roles in malignant tumor progression, including gastric cancer [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 47 48 49 47 In the current study, we focused on the roles and regulatory mechanisms of NAT10 in tumor properties and the TME of PDAC. These findings may facilitate the identification of molecular targets and predictive markers for immunotherapeutic response, thus optimizing current therapeutic strategies, especially immunotherapy, and improving the clinical prognosis of PDAC patients. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Tissue microarray Tissue microarray (TFPanc‐02) of 108 pairs of PDAC tissues and adjacent normal tissues (collected from December 2011 to December 2015) was obtained commercially (TUFEIBIO, Shanghai, P. R. China). All the patients were followed up regularly until September 2022. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University (No. LS2024065), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. 2.2 Immunohistochemistry Paraffin‐embedded sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in a graded alcohol series. Heat‐activated antigen retrieval was performed using a sodium citrate buffer. The sections were heated for 20 minutes using a microwave. Endogenous peroxidase activity was suppressed by exposure to 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. The sections were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with primary antibody at 37°C for 1 hour, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase‐conjugated secondary antibody at 37°C for 20 minutes. The sections were visualized using diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin for microscopic examination. The immunoreactive score (IRS, IRS = staining intensity × positive cell proportion) was used to assess protein expression. Staining intensity was graded as 0, 1, 2, and 3 (no staining, weak, moderate, and strong staining, respectively). The proportion of positive cells was scored as 1, 2, and 3 (<10%, 10%‐50%, and >50%, respectively). 2.3 Bioinformatic analysis Expression patterns of NAT10 LAMB3 GSE15471 GSE16515 LAMB3 http://gepia2.cancer‐pku.cn 50 NAT10 CD274 NAT10 LAMB3/ITGA2/CEACAM6 http://TNMplot.com/analysis/; n 51 NAT10 http://cis.hku.hk/; n NAT10 n 52 http://timer.cistrome.org/; n 53 2.4 Cells and cell culture Four human PDAC cell lines (BxPC‐3, MIA‐PaCa2, CoLo357, and PANC‐1), a mouse PDAC cell line (PanO2), and a human pancreatic ductal immortalized cell (HPNE) were purchased from Shanghai Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, P. R. China). All the cells were cultured in high‐glucose DMEM (Wisent, Nanjing, Jiangsu, P. R. China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Wisent), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 2.5 RNA extraction and real‑time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA). cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit (ProteinBio, Nanjing, Jiangsu, P. R. China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SYBR Green qPCR Supermix (ProteinBio) was used for qPCR analysis in an ABI 7900 real‐time PCR Detection System (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). β‐actin was used to normalize the RNA levels using the 2 −ΔΔCt S1 2.6 Stable cell line construction Lentiviruses encoding small hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting human NAT10 Nat10 NAT10 4 Nat10 4 NAT10/Nat10 S1 S2 2.7 RNA sequencing (RNA‐seq) and data processing Total RNA was extracted from the Nat10 https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release109/fasta/mus_musculus/dna/Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.toplevel.fa.gz 54 55 56 2.8 RNA interference and plasmid transfection Cells (6 × 10 5 LAMB3 LAMB3 2.9 Western blotting Total protein was extracted from the cells using radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (Beyotime, Suzhou, P. R. China). The protein extracts were separated on 10% gels via sodium dodecylsulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to 0.45 µm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, MA, USA). The proteins were probed with specific antibodies after the blot was blocked with a blocking buffer (Beyotime). Protein expression was visualized using Super ECL Chemiluminescent Substrate Kit (Millipore). The antibodies used in this process are listed in Supplementary Table S3 2.10 Immunofluorescence Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 minutes. After blocking, the cells were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. The cells were counterstained with 4',6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (DAPI; Beyotime) and YF488‐Phalloidin (Proteinbio) if needed. Stained cells were stored in the dark at 4°C until further investigation. The antibodies used in this process are listed in Supplementary Table S3 2.11 Clone formation assay Cells were seeded in a 6‐well plate (500 cells/well) and incubated in complete medium at 37°C with 5% CO 2 2.12 Wound healing assay Cells were seeded in a 6‐well plate and cultured until 100% confluence. A wound was inflicted using a 200 µL pipette tip. The cells were washed with phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) to remove the detached cells and cultured in a serum‐free medium. Microscopic images were captured at 0 and 24 hours after the wound was generated. The area of the wound was measured using the ImageJ software (version 1.53, National Institutes of Health, MD, USA). 2.13 Cell invasion assay The upper chambers (Corning, NY, USA) were coated with Matrigel (Becton, Dickinson and Company, NJ, USA). The cells (30,000 cells/well) suspended in serum‐free medium were placed into the upper chamber, and the culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber. The plates were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 2.14 RNA decay assays Cells were treated with 5 µg/mL Dactinomycin (Sigma, MO, USA) and harvested at different time points to extract RNA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for qPCR. The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1 2.15 RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)‐qPCR RIP was performed using a Magna RIP RNA‐Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were collected and lysed with RIP lysis buffer. Magnetic beads were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour at room temperature. IgG was used as a negative control. After washing, the beads were incubated with cell lysis at 4°C for 3 hours. The beads were then collected and washed, and the RNA complexes were isolated by phenol‐chloroform extraction. Enriched RNA fragments were subjected to qPCR analysis. The input RNA served as an internal control for normalization. 2.16 Acetylated RNA immunoprecipitation (acRIP)‐qPCR Total RNA was subjected to immunoprecipitation using aGenSeq ® 57 2.17 Xenograft model Four‐week‐old female C57BL/6 mice (18 to 20 g) were housed in a specific pathogen‐free facility with a 12‐hour light/12‐hour dark cycle and free access to food and water. The animals were terminated if the body weight loss exceeded 20%‐25% or the tumor weight accounted for more than 10% of the body weight. All animals were euthanized. For tumor growth evaluation, the flanks of mice were subcutaneously injected with PanO2 cells (3 × 10 6 2 6 2.18 Preparation of single‐cell suspension The subcutaneous tumors were excised, cut into small pieces, and digested in a dissociation medium containing 1 mg/mL collagenase IV (Sigma) and 0.2 mg/mL DNase I (Sigma). The tissue pieces were then incubated for 30 minutes at 37°C with vortexing manually every 10 minutes. After digestion, the cells were resuspended in 1 mL of ACK lysis buffer and incubated for 5 minutes to remove the red cells. Then, the cells were passed through 70 µm cell strainers to make a single‐cell suspension. Finally, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 300 × g 2.19 Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) and data preprocessing Single‐cell suspensions were converted into uniquely barcoded RNA libraries using the MobiNova‐100 Library (Mobidrop, Jiaxing, Zhejiang, P. R. China). The libraries were sequenced on a DNBSEQ‐T7 (Beijing Genomics Institute, Shenzhen, P. R. China). The output raw data was mapped to the mouse reference genome (version mm10) using MobiVision software (version 3.0, Mobidrop) with unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts summarized for each barcode. The UMI count matrix was analyzed using the Seurat (version 4.0.0) R package [ 58 59 Principal‐component analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce dimensionality using the “RunPCA” function of the Seurat R package. Graph‐based clustering was performed to cluster the cells according to their gene expression profiles using the “FindClusters” function of the Seurat R package. Cells were visualized using a two‐dimensional Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm with the “RunUMAP” function of the Seurat R package. The “FindAllMarkers” function (test.use = presto) was used to identify marker genes in each cluster. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were selected using “FindMarkers” function (test.use = presto). P 2 60 Pseudotime trajectory analysis was determined with the Monocle2 (version 2.9.0) R package [ 61 + 2.20 Flow cytometry The phenotypes of CD8 + S3 2.21 Multiplexed immunofluorescence staining Multiplexed immunofluorescence staining was performed using a multiplexed immunofluorescence kit (RecordBio, Shanghai, P. R. China) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Paraffin‐embedded sections were dewaxed and rehydrated. Heat‐activated antigen retrieval was performed using a sodium citrate buffer. The sections were then heated for 20 minutes using a microwave. Endogenous peroxidase activity was suppressed by exposure to 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, the sections were incubated with multiple primary antibodies, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase‐conjugated secondary antibodies and tyramide signal amplification. The sections were subjected to microwave heat treatment after each tyramide signal amplification. Nuclei were stained with DAPI after all antigens were labeled. Stained sections were imaged using the Pannoramic MIDI Digital Pathology System (3DHISTECH, Budapest, Hungary). The antibodies used in this process are listed in Supplementary Table S3 2.22 PD‐L1 and programmed cell death 1 (PD‐1) binding assay The interactions between PD‐1 and PD‐L1 were also assessed. The cells were fixed in 4% PFA at room temperature for 15 minutes and incubated with recombinant human/mouse PD‐1 Fc chimeric protein (MedChemExpress) at room temperature for 1 hour, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor TM S3 2.23 T cell‐mediated tumor cell killing assay Human peripheral blood CD8 + + 2.24 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 6.0; GraphPad Software, CA, USA).

The effective antitumor immune responses elicited by ICIs may depend on exhausted T cell subset in the tumor, whose function is restored by therapy [ 72 + Pdcd‐1) Cd28 Ifng Prf1 + Nat10 Nat10 In PDAC, the dense stoma in the TME obstructs the delivery of therapeutics and chimeric antigen receptor‐T (CAR‐T) cells to the tumor core [ 3 91 3 91 + The current study has some limitations. First, the subcutaneous tumor does not reflect all conditions of the TME. Therefore, the final verification should be performed in an orthotopic environment. In addition, PDAC is driven by KRAS p53 Kras Kras p53 NAT10 NAT10 NAT10 5 CONCLUSIONS This study proposed a regulatory role of NAT10 in tumor progression and immune microenvironment via the LAMB3/FAK/ERK pathway in PDAC. These findings may favor the selection of candidates who may benefit from immunotherapy, optimize current therapeutic strategies, and improve the clinical prognosis of PDAC patients.
