Methods This retrospective cohort study utilized the National Inpatient Sample (2016–2020) with weighted data to project findings to the general population. Patients were categorized as lean or non-lean based on BMI during hospitalization, excluding alternative etiologies via validated algorithms. Outcomes included composite cancer prevalence (primary) and individual cancer prevalence (secondary). Multivariable logistic regression was applied to assess differences. Results Among 34,955,252 U.S. hospitalizations, 539,275 patients had MASH (mean age: 64 years for lean vs. 58.8 years for non-lean; >60% female). Lean MASH hospitalizations had higher odds of lung (aOR 1.76, CI 1.33–2.10, P P P P P P P Conclusion Lean MASH hospitalizations are linked to higher odds of several cancers despite lower BMI, underscoring the need for a nuanced understanding of cancer risks in MASH. BMI alone may not fully capture oncologic risk in this population. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12876-025-04187-1.

Lean MASH, a metabolic condition without obesity, presents a paradox with unclear cancer risk profiles that have been minimally explored in Western populations. What this study adds: This study identifies a significantly higher prevalence of cancers—including lung, colon, kidney, liver, cervical, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma—among lean MASH patients compared to non-lean counterparts. It reveals that body composition may affect specific cancer risks in MASH patients independently of obesity. How this study might affect research, practice or policy: Findings suggest that BMI alone may not fully capture cancer risks in MASH, indicating the need for tailored cancer screenings that incorporate metabolic health in addition to body composition. This approach could inform clinical guidelines, public health initiatives, and future research on cancer prevention in metabolic liver diseases. Introduction Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously named Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is an umbrella term for conditions ranging from steatosis to Metabolic-dysfunction associated Steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with or without fibrosis. These terms were recently proposed by multinational liver societies to improve clarity, reduce stigma, and assist in better patient identification and awareness [ 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 Observational studies have shown that patients with MASLD are more likely to die from other cancers and cardiovascular risk, compared to hepatocellular carcinoma [ 9 10 11 Acknowledging a clear gap in detailed risk profiles associated with MASH in different body compositions, this study aims to fill this void by evaluating the prevalence of the most common malignancies across lean and non-lean MASH patients. Utilizing the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, a part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) managed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), we conducted a retrospective cohort analysis. The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient care database in the United States, providing a robust framework for tracking a wide array of healthcare outcomes across diverse populations [ 12 Methods Study design We conducted a retrospective cohort study of hospitalizations involving patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) using Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)’s National Inpatient Sample (NIS). AHRQ is a federal agency charged with research in United States health delivery system. The National inpatient sample is a Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) database from AHRQ [ 13 14 Data collection Using a validated algorithm, we identified all hospitalizations who were admitted with MASH as primary or secondary diagnosis. We then divided these hospitalizations into those with BMI less than BMI < 25 kg/m 2 2 2 2 Study variables/outcomes Patients demographics including age, gender, and race were extracted. Comorbidities include diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking status, sarcopenia. Hospital related variables include hospital location, teaching status, and bed size. hospitalization characteristics including length of stay, total hospitalization charges are provided by NIS for each hospitalization. Hospital location and teaching status are already defined in the NIS, and we utilized these definitions for our analysis. The median household income categories were determined based on the patient’s ZIP code and reported income in the administrative database, using the definitions provided by AHRQ. Data regarding the top 18 most common malignancies is provided in NIS. Outcomes The primary outcome was prevalence of the overall 18 malignancies in lean compared to non-lean MASH hospitalizations. The secondary outcomes were individual prevalence of all malignancies. Multiple confounders were collected and accounted for during analysis including age, gender, race, diabetes, sarcopenia, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hospital factors including location, teaching status, and hospital bedsize as well as Elixhauser comorbidity index. Statistical analysis We performed a descriptive analysis to study demographic variables in cases hospitalized with MASH stratified into lean versus non-lean. Continuous variables such as age were reported as mean. We used the discharge weight files provided by HCUP to evaluate overall hospitalization. Weights, strata, and clusters were employed in the analysis to account for the complex survey design of the NIS. A multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze statistical differences in the categorical outcomes. Cancer prevalence among these hospitalizations is reported in proportions. We performed a multivariable logistic regression analysis to study the differences in prevalence of malignancy and overall malignancy among hospitalizations with MASH versus those without MASH. We adjusted for confounding effect of demographic factors such as age, gender, race, primary payer, insurance status, hospital factors including location, bed size and teaching status. We also adjusted for patients’ comorbidities using Elixhauser comorbidity index which utilizes 31 independent patient co-morbidities identified based on ICD-10 coding system. We ran independent logistic regression of covariates and included only those co-variables with p p Ethical consideration As this database contains publicly available deidentified samples, this study was exempt from the Institutional Review Board at our institution. Results Between 2016 and 2020, a total of 34,955,252 hospitalizations were recorded in the United States. Of these, 539,275 involved adults (≥ 18 years) admitted with either a primary or secondary diagnosis of MASH. The analysis revealed distinct differences in the demographic and clinical profiles of lean versus non-lean MASH hospitalizations, as detailed in Table 1  Table 1 Demographic and clinical characteristics of lean vs. Non-Lean MASH hospitalized patients Variable Lean 324,330 (60%) Non-Lean 214,945 (40%) P Age, mean (years) 64.0 58.9 < 0.001 Gender < 0.001 Female 60.6% (196,502) 63.6% (136,429) Male 39.4% (127,828) 36.4% (78,516) Race/Ethnicity < 0.001 White 76.6% (247,552) 76.8% (165,473) Black 4.1% (13,309) 5.1% (10,962) Hispanic 13.7% (44,580) 13.4% (28,826) Other 5.7% (18,430) 4.6% (9,911) Charlson Co-morbidity index 0 5.78 (18,764) 8.58 (18,438) 1 9.68 (31,395) 12.21 (26,245) 2 10.34 (33,536) 11.83 (25,428) 3 13.39 (43,428) 13.23 (28,437) 4 16.24 (52,671) 14.31 (30,758) 5 44.57 (144,554) 39.84 (85,639) Charlson Co-morbidity index ≥ 3 74.2% (240,702) 67.3% (144,504) < 0.001 Comorbidities Diabetes Mellitus 62.6% (202,206) 64.1% (137,896) < 0.001 Hypertension 67.9% (220,640) 71.8% (154,779) < 0.001 Hyperlipidemia 38.7% (125,670) 42.7% (91,770) < 0.001 Smoking 0.6% (1,960) 0.5% (1,074( 0.0347 Sarcopenia 0.16% (519) 0.10% (215) 0.0196 Type of Admission < 0.001 Elective Admission 9.7% (31,474) 16.3% (35,095) Weekend Admission 22.1% (71,677) 20.7% (44,494) Primary Payer Source < 0.001 Private insurance 61.1% (198,926) 50.3% (107,602) Medicaid 11% (35,577) 14.1% (30,353) Medicare 23% (74,743) 30.3% (65,000) Other Payment Source 2.5% (8,110) 3.0% (6,449) Self-Pay 0.2% (649) 0.2% (430) No Charge 2.2% (7,144) 2.2% (4,734) Median Household income, $ < 0.001 <45 999 29.8% (96,593) 30.0% (64,485) 46 000–58 999 28.2% (91,710) 29.1% (62,508) 59 000–78 999 24.5% (79,695) 25.4% (54,698) >79 000 17.4% (56,519) 15.6% (33,554) Hospital Location Status < 0.001 Rural 8.1% (26,289) 6.9% (14,856) Urban 91.9% (298,041) 93.1% (200,089) Hospital Teaching Status 0.041 Teaching 73.9% (239,208) 74.9% (161,964) Non-teaching 26.1% (85,122) 25.1% (53,981) Hospital Bedsize < 0.001 Small 17.0% (55,059) 18.4% (39,491) Medium 25.4% (82,310) 25.5% (54,814( Large 57.6% (186,774) 56.1% (120,688) Composite cancer outcome Tables 2 3 p Table 2 Cancer outcomes by lean and Non-Lean status among hospitalizations Outcome Lean ( N Non-Lean ( N Breast Cancer 1,946 (0.6%) 860 (0.4%) Lung Cancer 1,617 (0.5%) 649 (0.3%) Prostate Cancer 1,063 (0.3%) 215 (0.1%) Colon Cancer 1,946 (0.6%) 860 (0.4%) Melanoma 130 (0.04%) 65 (0.03%) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 2,594 (0.8%) 1,075 (0.5%) Thyroid Cancer 130 (0.04%) 65 (0.03%) Kidney Cancer 3,632 (1.12%) 1,935 (0.9%) Pancreatic Cancer 1,294 (0.4%) 645 (0.3%) Liver Cancer 12,942 (4.0%) 5,612 (2.7%) Endometrial Cancer 260 (0.08%) 451 (0.21%) Ovarian Cancer 455 (0.14%) 257 (0.12%) Esophageal Cancer 195 (0.06%) 107 (0.05%) Brain Cancer 241 (0.074%) 140 (0.065%) Gastric Cancer 358 (0.11%) 171 (0.08%) Cervical Cancer 98 (0.03%) 22 (0.01%) Rectal Cancer 291 (0.09%) 1,285 (0.6%) Multiple Myeloma 1,166 (0.36%) 578 (0.27%) Composite Cancer Outcome 28,848 (8.9%) 13,977 (6.5%) Table 3 Unadjusted and Adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) of Cancer Outcomes Associated with Lean vs. Non-Lean Status, with Full Multivariate Model CovariatesOdds Ratios for Cancer Outcomes by Lean and Non-Lean Status Among Hospitalizations Outcome Unadjusted OR (95% CI) Adjusted OR (95% CI) a Adjusted P Breast Cancer 1.28 (1.07-1.52) 1.18 (0.98-1.42) 0.076 Lung Cancer 2.03 (1.63-2.52) 1.67 (1.34-2.10) <0.001 Prostate Cancer 1.81 (1.35-2.43) 1.18 (0.88-1.60) 0.259 Colon Cancer 1.35 (1.13-1.62) 1.23 (1.03-1.48) 0.026 Melanoma 1.19 (0.62-2.29) 1.06 (0.54-2.08) 0.867 Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 1.43 (1.22-1.68) 1.27 (1.08-1.50) 0.004 Thyroid Cancer 1.17 (0.59-2.34) 1.20 (0.60-2.41) 0.596 Kidney Cancer 1.26 (1.11-1.43) 1.26 (1.10-1.44) 0.001 Pancreatic Cancer 1.26 (1.01-1.57) 1.09 (0.86-1.37) 0.486 Liver Cancer 1.49 (1.38-1.61) 1.20 (1.12-1.31) <0.001 Endometrial Cancer 0.38 (0.27-0.53) 0.35 (0.25-0.50) <0.001 Ovarian Cancer 1.16 (0.82-1.65) 1.10 (0.77-1.56) 0.611 Esophageal Cancer 1.07 (0.63-1.80) 0.91 (0.53-1.57) 0.748 Brain Cancer 1.14 (0.70-1.84) 1.29 (0.78-2.13) 0.319 Gastric Cancer 1.39 (0.92-2.09) 1.18 (0.79-1.80) 0.432 Cervical Cancer 2.98 (1.01-8.81) 3.25 (1.07-9.88) 0.037 Rectal Cancer 1.48 (0.91-2.42) 1.42 (0.87-2.35) 0.161 Multiple Myeloma 1.34 (1.06-1.68) 1.15 (0.91-1.46) 0.227 Composite Cancer Outcome 1.41 (1.34-1.48) 1.22 (1.16-1.29) <0.001 OR CI a *significance if p Common cancer prevalence When examining specific cancer types, lean MASH hospitalizations demonstrated a higher prevalence of several cancers.

To date, and to the best of our knowledge Our study adds to the understanding of increased cancer risk in hospitalized patients with MASLD, including MASH seen in previous studies that revealed increased mortality rate among all stages of steatotic liver disease, including MASH [ 15 17 18 2 2 Our study corroborates existing research linking diabetes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as various extrahepatic solid organ cancers such as prostate, breast, esophagus, colon, lung, pancreas, kidney, and bladder [ 16 Previous observational studies have often evaluated cancer risks within the entire spectrum of MASLD but lacked a global perspective. Our findings contribute to this narrative by clarifying that while MASLD is commonly associated with increased risks for hepatocellular and extrahepatic cancers, the specific relationship between MASH, body composition, and cancer risk remains complex. This emphasizes the need for further investigations that are globally representative and stratify patients from initial steatosis through MASH to cirrhosis, thereby enhancing our understanding of how obesity interplays with metabolic liver disease to modulate cancer risk. Additionally, our analysis identified an increased risk of endometrial cancer in the obese MASH cohort, aligning with previous studies that have highlighted the role of hormonal imbalances associated with obesity [ 19 Finally, our sex-stratified analysis revealed striking disparities: lean female MASH patients had 115-fold higher odds of breast cancer but lower odds of liver and kidney cancers compared to non-lean females. While the extreme odds for breast cancer may reflect residual confounding (e.g., undiagnosed genetic risk), the inverse association with hepatocellular and renal cancers aligns with evidence that obesity-driven metabolic dysfunction (e.g., hyperinsulinemia, adipokine imbalance) disproportionately promotes these malignancies in non-lean populations. These contrasts underscore that lean MASH Clinical implications The observed disparities in cancer prevalence between hospitalized lean and non-lean MASH patients underscore the critical need for tailored screening protocols that account for metabolic health status and body composition. Clinicians should recognize the heightened cancer risk among hospitalized lean MASH patients and consider incorporating regular cancer screenings into their management plans. Given the threefold higher odds of cervical cancer observed in hospitalized lean MASH patients compared to their non-lean counterparts, routine cervical cancer screenings should be prioritized in this population. Early detection through regular screenings can facilitate timely intervention and improve patient outcomes. Managing MASH requires a holistic approach that extends beyond liver health to encompass comprehensive care targeting metabolic dysregulation and associated cancer risks. Clinicians should adopt a multifaceted management strategy that addresses both liver-specific concerns and modifiable risk factors implicated in cancer pathogenesis. Obesity and diabetes, known contributors to cancer development, should be actively addressed in the management of MASH patients. Interventions aimed at weight management, lifestyle modifications, and glycemic control are crucial for mitigating cancer risk and improving overall health outcomes. Public health implications Moreover, considering the findings highlighted in this analysis among hospitalized MASH patients, particularly among lean individuals, public health initiatives must prioritize raising awareness of these risks. Health promotion campaigns should be tailored to educate the public, with a specific emphasis on lean individuals, about the importance of maintaining a healthy weight and adopting lifestyle modifications to mitigate cancer risk. By disseminating targeted information through various channels, such as social media, community outreach programs, and healthcare facilities, public health campaigns can empower individuals to make informed decisions regarding their health and well-being. Policymakers play a pivotal role in addressing the public health implications of MASH-associated cancer risks. It is imperative for policymakers to integrate cancer screening and prevention strategies into existing healthcare systems, ensuring equitable access to preventive healthcare services for all individuals, including those diagnosed with MASH. This may entail implementing policies that facilitate early detection and intervention, such as reducing barriers to screening programs and promoting the adoption of evidence-based guidelines for cancer prevention and management. By enacting comprehensive policy interventions, policymakers can contribute to reducing the burden of MASH-associated cancers and improving health outcomes on a population level. Limitations We acknowledge several limitations in this study. First, the diagnosis of MASH is established using ICD-10 codes from a nationwide database, which may introduce selection bias due to potential misclassification or incorrect coding. Secondly, the lack of longitudinal follow-up in our dataset prevents us from determining if some lean patients were initially non-lean and lost weight due to underlying cancer or other health issues. This limitation is inherent to the use of the NIS, which does not track patients over time. This underscores the need for longitudinal studies to confirm our findings and to better understand the temporal dynamics between body weight changes and cancer development. Thirdly, as this is a cross-sectional study, we cannot measure causality, and only associations can be assumed. Additionally, it is important to note that the unit of analysis in this study is hospitalizations rather than individual patients. As a result, patients who are hospitalized more than once may be counted multiple times, which could impact the interpretation of the data. Despite employing multivariable analysis to control for patient demographics and comorbidities, residual confounding by unmeasured or inadequately measured factors cannot be ruled out. Factors such as lifestyle choices, socioeconomic status, and detailed clinical history were not available in the NIS, which could influence both MASH progression and cancer risk. Furthermore, the use of administrative data restricts the ability to explore deeper clinical nuances that might affect disease classification and outcomes. Clinical subtleties such as the severity of steatohepatitis, patient medication histories, and finer details of metabolic health are beyond the scope of what administrative codes can capture. Moreover, it is crucial to specify that this study is based on hospitalization data from the NIS. While this database could be externally validated to US hospitals, caution should be exercised in generalizing the findings to the broader US population. Moreover, we acknowledge that BMI is frequently underreported in administrative data, which may affect the reliability of our findings. Furthermore, BMI coding (e.g., Z68.2) may overlap lean and non-lean ranges, especially across ethnic groups (e.g., Asians), potentially leading to misclassification. This undercoding could potentially lead to misclassification and bias in our results. Additionally, BMI cutoffs may differ in older adults due to age-related changes in body composition; however, the database did not support age-specific BMI categorization. Therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting the associations between BMI and cancer risk in this study. Additionally, while our dataset includes hospitalizations from 2016 to 2020, the structure of the NIS only allows analysis at the yearly level making it difficult to differentiate between hospitalizations pre- and post-COVID-19 Pandemic in early 2020. Given the potential impact of the pandemic on cancer detection, screening delays, and healthcare access, this represents an important limitation. However, due to the limited post-pandemic observation period and the lack of monthly-level data, stratifying our analysis by pre- and post-pandemic years could introduce bias. Finally, while this study contributes valuable insights into the role of BMI in cancer pathogenesis among MASH patients, these findings need to be interpreted with caution and verified through additional studies that can address these limitations. This study is among the first to elucidate the potential cancer risk disparities within this patient population, laying the groundwork for more detailed investigations in the future. Future research Future research should prioritize validating these findings across diverse datasets and patient populations to ascertain the generalizability and robustness of the observed associations. Studies employing longitudinal databases that track patients over time would be particularly valuable, enabling researchers to observe changes in metabolic status and corresponding shifts in cancer risk profiles. This longitudinal approach would also facilitate a better understanding of the temporal relationship between MASH and cancer development. Prospective studies, ideally with a multi-center design, are crucial to explore not only the cancers examined in this study but also other malignancies that may be associated with MASH. Such studies should incorporate detailed metabolic and genetic profiling to dissect the mechanisms by which metabolic dysfunction influences cancer pathogenesis. Moreover, it would be instructive to explore the impact of interventions targeting metabolic dysfunctions, such as pharmacological treatments, lifestyle modifications, and bariatric surgery, on cancer incidence in MASH patients. This could offer insights into potential preventive strategies that could be implemented in high-risk populations. In addition to clinical studies, bioinformatics approaches involving big data analytics and machine learning could be employed to identify novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for cancers associated with MASH. These computational studies could leverage existing medical datasets to predict cancer risk and outcomes more accurately in patients with various forms of metabolic dysfunction. Ultimately, these efforts should aim to foster a multidisciplinary approach, combining clinical, genetic, and public health strategies to mitigate the elevated cancer risks associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. Conclusion(s) In conclusion, this comprehensive population-based study conducted in the United States has elucidated significant associations between body composition and cancer risks in hospitalized patients admitted with MASH. Specifically, hospitalized lean individuals with MASH were found to have an elevated risk of HCC, lung, colon, kidney, and cervical cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as compared to hospitalized non-lean MASH patients. Conversely, those hospitalized with non-lean MASH exhibited a higher risk of endometrial cancer as compared to their lean counterparts. These findings highlight the need for clinicians to consider body composition as a factor in cancer screening and prevention strategies for patients with MASH. While the results are compelling, they necessitate further validation through longitudinal studies to confirm these associations and to explore the underlying mechanisms. This study underscores the importance of tailored approaches in management and monitoring of cancer risks in different MASH patient subgroups based on their metabolic profiles.
