Recent evidence suggests that pelvic health physiotherapy can improve these dysfunctions and enhance quality of survivorship, but several barriers limit access to such care. Virtual programs are proposed as a strategy to improve access. Aim The main aim of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the newly designed Pelvic Health eRehabilitation Program in people treated for BGCs. The study also aims to explore the preliminary effectiveness of the Program in reducing urogenital impairments. Methods This study uses a proof-of-concept, interventional prospective cohort design. Twenty individuals with BGCs presenting with urogenital dysfunction (score ≥2 on the Pelvic Floor Bother Questionnaire) will be recruited in the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Alberta. The Program includes twelve weekly small-group online educational sessions with a pelvic health physiotherapist, five individual exercise prescription sessions, and access to a variety of online resources. The following standardized patient-reported outcome measures will be used: the International Consultation on Incontinence modular questionnaires for bladder and bowel symptoms, the Vulvar Pain Assessment Questionnaire, and the Female Sexual Function Index. Evaluations will be conducted before (E1), halfway through (E2), and immediately after (E3) the intervention. Conclusion Findings from this study will inform the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the Program for individuals experiencing urogenital dysfunction following BGCs treatment, supporting future development of a randomized controlled trial. This virtual Program holds promise to improve equity in access to pelvic health services.

Access to care may be limited by barriers such as the absence of cancer rehabilitation services in cancer centers, financial costs, having to travel to obtain services, or the immune-compromised state of health of people with cancer who are required to limit their face-to-face activities.  27  27  27  27 18 26 28 29 32 Methods Design and flow of the study For this study, a one-arm proof-of-concept design involving a 12-week intervention was selected to lay the groundwork for a future multicenter RCT. This study is designed in accordance with Eldridge and colleagues  33  34 35 36 N Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR)  37 Chronic advanced cancer rehabilitation conceptual framework for engagement of individuals with lived experience  38 Figure 1 Figure 1. Flow of the study. Study setting This study is multicentric, as it will be conducted in two locations (Québec and Edmonton, Canada). Interventions will be available in two languages: French and English. In Québec, the Centre interdisciplinaire de recherche en réadaptation et intégration sociale will serve as the primary site for study coordination, including the delivery of interventions in French. In Edmonton, the Cross Cancer Institute, a tertiary cancer center, will serve as the recruitment site, with English-language interventions delivered through the Cancer Rehabilitation Clinic. Participants and selection criteria Eligible participants will comply with the following selection criteria: (1) be >18 years of age; (2) have received a diagnosis of breast or gynecological (endometrial, cervical, ovarian, vulvar or vaginal) cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stages I‒IV); (3) be currently receiving any form of active or maintenance cancer treatment (regardless of type or intensity), or have completed cancer treatment (surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy) within the past 4 years; (4) have a urogenital dysfunction, as screened by a score of ≥2 on the Pelvic Floor Bother Questionnaire; and (5) be able to provide informed written electronic consent in English or French. Exclusion criteria are: (1) individuals who do not have regular access to internet, to a smart device or a computer, at home. Recruitment procedures Participants will be recruited using a combination of convenience and snowball sampling strategies. Convenience sampling will involve identifying eligible individuals through oncology follow-up clinics and previous research patient databases from both participating sites. Snowball sampling will be used to broaden recruitment by sharing study information through social media campaigns. Invitations will also be distributed through patient support groups on social media. Interested individuals will be required to initiate contact with the research team if they are interested in taking part in the study either by telephone or through a secure Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) form.  39 Intervention The PHRP will be 12 weeks in duration, in accordance with the recommended time required for training involving the pelvic floor muscles.  40  27 Figure 2  41  42 Figure 2. Anatomical diagrams for before and after hysterectomy (on the left), and hemi-vulvectomy (on the right). In addition to the pelvic floor muscle training program, the intervention will also involve a minimum of five individual sessions between the pelvic health physiotherapist and each participant to provide personalized exercise prescription. These sessions will include subjective assessment of symptoms, routine screening for adverse effects and potential complications such as infection, bleeding, or other symptoms requiring medical attention, as well as evaluation of perceived progress or difficulties with the exercises. Based on this subjective information, exercises may be modified, and personalized counseling and education will be provided regarding the applicability of other program components to each participant's context. These meetings are expected to last 15 min. Moreover, resources supporting the content presented in the sessions will be accessible on the online HEAL-ME platform (see Figure 3 Figure 3. Online resources on the HEAL-ME platform including weekly goal, educational videos, anatomical diagrams and weekly exercise program. Data collection Considering that the PHRP aims to facilitate access to pelvic health interventions, the acceptability outcomes selected for this study are based on Lévesque, Harris and Russell's conceptual model of access to healthcare, in which access is presented as an opportunity to seek and receive appropriate healthcare for our need.  33 43 45 46 47 48 49  50 51 52  53 Patient and public involvement This study follows the SPOR by involving interest-holders within the research team to help adapt research methods and ensure that the representation and dissemination of results are fair and effective for patients. As such, one Person With Lived or Living Experience (PWLLE) of gynecological cancer joined the research team to share and contribute her experiential knowledge to each of the research activities of this study, including the design. The PWLLE was invited to contribute to her preferred level of engagement,  54 Analysis plan Descriptive statistics will be conducted to describe personal characteristics using median and range, while frequency analyses will be calculated for feasibility outcomes (i.e., adherence and attrition rates). In line with recommendations for pilot studies, 33 55 56 Discussion The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding of the acceptability and feasibility of a virtual PHRP for individuals treated for BGCs. This is particularly important given the high prevalence of pelvic health needs in this population and the limited access to appropriate care. Digital health tools such as the PHRP offer a promising strategy to reduce this disparity by addressing barriers like geographic distance and financial constraints. However, for such tools to effectively improve access, their design and delivery must first be deemed acceptable and feasible by users.  57  58 Conclusion This study seeks to improve access to specialized pelvic health care for people diagnosed with BGCs who also have urogenital dysfunction, regardless of factors such as income, health status, or place of residence. Results will generate evidence to inform the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the program, laying the groundwork for future efforts to enhance survivorship care after BGC treatment.
