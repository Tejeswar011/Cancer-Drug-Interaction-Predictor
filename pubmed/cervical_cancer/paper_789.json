By synthesizing these findings with prior instances of lymph node endometriosis, the study seeks to offer innovative insights and identify potential targets for the diagnosis and treatment of this condition. A 36-year-old patient presented with escalating dysmenorrhea and a swiftly expanding abdominal mass. Imaging revealed the presence of a para-aortic mass, alongside a sizable cystic solid lesion in the pelvic abdomen featuring numerous internal grid-like patterns. The surgical removal of the uterus and enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes was performed via laparotomy, resulting in the pathological diagnosis of endometriosis in the para-aortic lymph nodes and cystic adenomyosis. Furthermore, sequencing analysis of lesions indicated that the lesions exhibited up-regulation of genes and pathways associated with cell activation, adhesion, inflammation, and immunity. Our study supports Halban’s “Benign Metastasis” theory in endometriosis, noting that lymph node spread often shows imaging changes and raised CA125 levels, necessitating distinction from malignant tumors for proper treatment. We also suggest a link between FOXA2 and SRRM2 genes and this endometriosis form, recommending further research on gene mutations and molecular pathways for better diagnosis and understanding.

Primarily affecting pelvic tissues, endometriosis also manifests outside the pelvis in approximately 12% of cases, posting a clinical challenge due to its rarity and atypical symptoms [ 1 2 2 5 1  Table 1 Reported cases of endometriosis in para-aortic lymph nodes References Publication year Age, y History Symptoms Pathology Size of node Beavis et al.

Throughout the progression of the disease, the patient demonstrated increasingly severe dysmenorrhea of extended duration, accompanied by a progressively enlarging mass in the lower abdomen. It is noteworthy that the patient self-administered mifepristone (Patient could not recall the dose) for a period of three years to manage intolerable and persistent lower abdominal pain. Symptom relief during medication, nonetheless, following the cessation of the medication, there was a notable recurrence of symptoms and an accelerated progression of the disease. The patient’s abdomen exhibited significant enlargement in the upright position, comparable to the size of a 5-month pregnancy (Fig. 1 2 3  Fig. 1 Patient’s abdomen in a lying position  Fig. 2 Imaging manifestations of the patient. Axial ( A B D E F The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy, with the explicit request of not preserving reproductive function.

A B C The final histologic pathology confirmed the uterine adenomyosis, endometriosis, and endometriotic cyst in the para-aortic lymph nodes. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated positive expression of CK7, PAX-8, WT-1, and CD10 (Fig. 4  Fig. 4 Histologic appearance of endometriotic implant in para-aortic lymph nodes. H&E = hematoxylin and eosin For two years post-surgery, regular follow-ups with pelvic ultrasounds, abdominopelvic CT scans, tumor marker tests, and routine gynecological exams were conducted, revealing no abnormalities. We conducted sequencing analysis on the lesions of the patient (Fig. 5  Fig. 5 Cystic adenomyosis lesions were compared with endometrium and uterine junction zone (from the patient’s own tissue) by RNA-seq, both cystic adenomyosis and endometriosis in para-aortic lymph nodes were compared with blood by WES. A B p C D E F Discussion The mechanism of lymphatic metastasis in endometriosis remains unclear. Halban’s theory of “Benign Metastasis” proposes that benign endometrial stroma and glands can disseminate through lymphatic and blood vessels. Previous research has demonstrated that individuals diagnosed with endometriosis exhibit heightened lymphangiogenic potential and an increased density of lymphatic vessels in the eutopic endometrium, it can also facilitate the infiltration of endometrial tissue into the lymphatic circulation [ 6 7 Studies and reports on lymph node endometriosis are limited and its exact prevalence is unknown. In a prospective study [ 8 9 10 Contrary to previous studies, our report suggests ectopic endometrium in retroperitoneum can occur independently, which means endometrium is more aggressive in this patient. The “eutopic endothelial determinism” points out that ectopic endothelium causes disease through attachment, aggression, and angiogenesis (AAA) [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Endometriosis diagnosis typically relies on patient history, symptoms, and tests, but lymph node endometriosis is often mistaken for cancer due to a lack of reliable markers. Diagnosis depends on surgeon experience and imaging. Advancements in noninvasive diagnostics and a better understanding of adenomyosis have revealed its strong link to adolescence, often appearing in early puberty and worsening over time. Early diagnosis is crucial for effective management [ 24 25 Due to the rarity of this case, sequencing was limited to one patient, preventing large-scale analysis. The study also lacks experimental validation. Future clinical efforts will focus on collecting samples from similar cases to enable broader analysis and better evidence. Large-scale studies should clarify lymph node involvement in different endometriosis types. Fundamental research is needed to establish lymphatic metastasis theory and identify biomarkers for severe endometriosis and adenomyosis. These efforts are crucial for timely, standardized diagnosis and treatment to protect fertility.
