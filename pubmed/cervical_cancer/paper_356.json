Despite decades of use in pain management, clinical evidence supporting Rebox remains inconclusive, with a lack of rigorous sham-controlled trials. This study aimed to evaluate its analgesic effect in a single-center, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial. Methods The study included consecutive patients with non-cancer nociceptive pain with average pain intensity ≥ 4 on a numerical rating scale (NRS), and pain duration of 2–12 weeks (de novo or acutely exacerbated chronic pain). Patients were randomized (1:1) into two arms based on the sequence of stimulation periods. Each period consisted of eight sessions of either Rebox or sham treatment, administered every other working day, with a 1-week washout period. The primary outcome was the difference in the reduction of pain intensity (average and worst pain in the last 24 h) following active versus sham stimulation. Results Seventy-one patients completed the study, with musculoskeletal back pain being the most common indication ( n d p d p Conclusion Rebox demonstrated a significant analgesic effect compared to the sham. The treatment was safe and well tolerated. These findings support integrating Rebox into clinical pain management, warranting further investigation in larger trials.

This is the first contemporary study to provide evidence for the efficacy of Rebox electrotherapy in pain management. The study hypothesized that Rebox electrotherapy would significantly reduce pain intensity compared to sham treatment.  What was learned from this study? In this randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind crossover trial, Rebox electrotherapy demonstrated a significant and clinically relevant analgesic effect across various nociceptive conditions, particularly musculoskeletal back pain. Rebox treatment was safe and well tolerated. The study highlights the potential of Rebox in clinical practice and identifies areas for further research into its underlying mechanisms. Introduction Noninvasive electrotherapeutic modalities have been used extensively in the management of acute and chronic pain, with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) being the most studied and widely applied technique [ 1 2 Rebox therapy is a form of microcurrent electrotherapy designed for pain management and rehabilitation, which has been clinically used since the early 1990s [ 3 5 Despite its routine clinical application for over three decades, high-quality evidence supporting the efficacy of Rebox therapy from rigorous sham-controlled trials is lacking. A sham-controlled crossover study by Johannsen et al. reported improvements in pain and function among patients with chronic lateral epicondylitis [ 6 7 8 8 The biological mechanisms underlying the potential effects of Rebox therapy remain unclear. The original hypothesis, formulated during the development of the method in the 1980s, proposed that transcutaneous correction of local acidosis (TCLA) plays a key role in its therapeutic action [ 9 10 1 Fig. 1 Example of Rebox application in a patient with low back pain. (1) The Rebox device generates specific rectangular direct current pulses, displaying real-time mean current and voltage intensity values on a digital display. (2) Treatment is delivered by a therapist via noninvasive transcutaneous administration, using a point-treatment electrode (cathode) applied to the site of pain while the muscles remain relaxed. The therapist manually adjusts the constant voltage (up to 20 V) to achieve a stable target mean current intensity of 140–160 µA. Each stimulation point is treated for approximately 2–5 s. A single session typically involves 20–40 stimulation points (blue dots), spaced 1–3 cm apart, depending on the extent of the affected region (red area). The total duration of one session is usually 10–20 min. (3) The patient holds a reference stainless steel cylindrical electrode (anode) in a hand to complete the electric circuit. (4) Detail of the treatment electrode. The treatment electrode features a gold-plated, flexible tip with a circular knurled contact surface (diameter 2.5 mm). It is applied perpendicularly to the skin with gentle, standardized pressure (transparent tip), ensuring optimal conductivity and reproducibility. This design represents an improvement over early Rebox models, which utilized a hard, sharp metal tip applied at an angle of approximately 30° [ 6 Our objective was to assess the clinical efficacy of Rebox in managing acute and acutely exacerbated chronic nociceptive pain across various conditions commonly treated at our pain center. The primary outcome was the difference in the reduction of pain intensity (average and worst pain in the last 24 h) following active versus sham stimulation. Secondary outcomes included the evaluation of the immediate analgesic effect, impact on functional interference, and the safety and tolerability of the treatment. Methods Study Design This study was a post-marketing, single-center, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover clinical trial. A total of 72 consecutive outpatient patients with moderate to severe non-cancer musculoskeletal pain (average numerical rating scale [NRS] pain intensity ≥ 4, pain duration 2–12 weeks, de novo onset or acute exacerbation of chronic pain) participated in the study [ 11 1 6 12 6 Table 1 Eligibility criteria Inclusion criteria Pain associated with one of the following diagnoses Myofascial musculoskeletal pain Musculoskeletal non-radicular back pain in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions Sacroiliitis with sacroiliac joint block Cervicocranialgia Frozen shoulder syndrome Arthrosis Epicondylitis Pain in tendons, ligaments, and other enthesopathies Postoperative pain Post-traumatic pain Duration of pain (de novo or exacerbation of chronic pain) before study inclusion ranged from 2 weeks to 3 months Average pain intensity in a given period of 2 weeks to 3 months before study inclusion of NRS ≥ 4 The patient could be concurrently treated with analgesics and could be undergoing manual physiotherapy (rehabilitation) Exclusion criteria: Age < 18 years Local contraindications: Impaired skin integrity at the site of application (open wound, skin ulcer, burns); note: the area around the postoperative scar was not an exclusion criterion Acute inflammation of the skin or subcutaneous tissue at the application site Deep vein thrombosis (diagnosed or suspected) General contraindications: Implanted electrical device (pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, deep brain stimulator, cochlear implant, etc.) Pregnancy Epilepsy Malignancy (diagnosed or suspected) Acute, potentially life-threatening condition Concomitant other physical therapy (electrotherapy, magnetotherapy, laser therapy, ultrasound therapy, mechanotherapy, etc.) The Rebox device was administered to the subject for any indication in the last 12 months before the study inclusion date A recent change in analgesic medication (i.e., new drug or change in dosage less than 1 week before the first stimulation session) or a planned change in analgesic medication during the study (change in drug or dose); note: any change in analgesic medication during the study was allowed and had to be recorded Ongoing acute infection, surgery, or trauma during the study Concurrent subject participation in another clinical study The subject was unable to sign informed consent NRS Ethical Approval The randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial was approved by the Ethics Committee of F. D. Roosevelt University Hospital with Policlinic, Banská Bystrica, Slovakia (approval no. 14/2023). The study was preregistered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT05968274 Blinding and Randomization Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the two arms according to the order of stimulation periods (Rebox–sham, or sham–Rebox). The study was double-blind. Two Rebox devices (active and sham) marked with “A” and “B” with visually identical hardware and firmware interface were used. Based on a computer-generated random number table, subject IDs were initially randomized into two arms. The IDs with instructions about the device order (A–B or B–A) were put in an opaque envelope. At randomization, each patient was assigned a unique ID, which was randomly drawn by the study nurse from an opaque envelope. The three study nurses, supervising physicians (i.e., operators and assessors), and the statistician all remained blinded to the active versus sham status of the two devices throughout the entire study. At the end of the study, the study nurses were asked which device they thought was the active one (replying “A”, “B”, or “unsure”). Patients were aware of being treated in a 1:1 ratio with active versus sham stimulation, but were not informed about the crossover study design or the order of device administration. Intervention Screening and clinical examination of all patients were performed by local physicians with a license in anesthesiology. At baseline, the therapist completed the entry questionnaire, which included the patient's history and relevant medical data. In each session, a CE-certified medical device, Rebox-Physio 4 (class IIa, manufacturer: REBOX THERAPY s.r.o., Czech Republic), either active or sham, was applied by a trained study nurse according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The active stimulation parameters included a target mean current intensity of 140–160 µA, pulse frequency of 3 kHz, and pulse duration of 250 µs. For stimulation technique, see Fig. 1 Primary Outcome: Pain Reduction According to BPI-SF For primary outcome assessment, a short form of the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI-SF) questionnaire was used, which was completed by all patients at the start and end of each stimulation period (i.e., four times). In BPI-SF, four pain items are assessed: average pain, worst and least pain in the last 24 h, and current pain. Each item is rated using the NRS with a pain score ranging from 0 to 10 (0 = no pain; 10 = worst pain imaginable) [ 13 14 Secondary Outcome: Immediate Pain Reduction Immediate pain reduction was monitored to explore whether Rebox produces acute analgesic effects comparable to other electrotherapeutic methods like TENS. At each session, a stimulation protocol was completed, focusing on the immediate analgesic effect, tolerability, side effects, recent changes in concomitant medication (if present), and potential technical failures during application. The immediate analgesic effect was evaluated by comparing the current NRS scores before and immediately after the stimulation session. Secondary Outcome: Functional Interference Functional interference was included to assess the broader impact of pain on patients’ daily activities and quality of life, using seven items of BPI-SF (general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life) [ 14 Secondary Outcome: Safety and Tolerability Safety and tolerability outcomes were analyzed in order to fulfill the requirements of the Medical Device Regulation (MDR). Tolerability of Rebox treatment was evaluated by the percentage of patients completing the stimulation protocol and by patients’ subjective tolerability ratings of each session (five levels: perfect, good, bearable, poor, fully unbearable). A patient was considered to have tolerated the therapy if at least 14 out of 16 sessions were completed without early cessation (tolerability cutoff). The treatment was considered generally tolerable if, among all enrolled patients, the tolerability cutoff was achieved in ≥ 90% of patients. Reported side effects were recorded and analyzed regularly during the study by a safety board. Statistical Analysis We initially conducted a G*Power analysis to estimate the necessary number of participants for a crossover design. Specifically, we performed G*Power analysis for analysis of variance (ANOVA): repeated measures, within-between interactions, which closely resembles a crossover design with four measurements across two comparable arms. Using standard input parameters (effect size f: 0.25; number of groups: 2; number of measurements: 4; alpha error probability: 0.05; power: 0.95), we determined that at least 36 participants would be required. To enhance the statistical power and robustness of our findings, we aimed to include 72 participants, doubling the minimum requirement, to strengthen the study’s ability to detect meaningful effects. Analyses were performed using the free software JASP 0.18.3.0. We firstly analyzed the descriptive data and evaluated the values of the NRS scores measuring the average and worst pain (according to the recommended BPI evaluation methodology) at four different times: T T T T 15 t T T T T T T T T 15 To examine the differences in the effects of Rebox and sham on immediate pain, we computed four comparable mean values of reported immediate pain scores—each derived from eight assessments before the application of Rebox or sham and eight assessments afterward. Additionally, we conducted a normality test to verify the data's distribution. To analyze functional interference, we computed seven BPI-SF items that should represent the functional interference. Similarly to the analysis of the pain reduction, we compared functional interference at four different time points for each arm separately. Also, we evaluated the carryover effect and overall difference in effectiveness of the treatment for the functional interference using statistical analysis recommended for crossover trials. Only patients with complete data for the assessment of primary outcomes were analyzed. De-identified individual participant data, including the data dictionary, statistical code, and other relevant materials, are available upon reasonable request. Results Study Group Characteristics Data collection was conducted between October 1, 2023, and October 7, 2024. Seventy-one patients (mean age 63.8 [12.6] years, 55 women) completed the study and were analyzed. One patient, age 81, died of an ischemic stroke after the first sham period.

Functional Interference A significant carryover effect was detected in functional interference analysis. Therefore, the results cannot be interpreted and no further analysis was performed. Safety and Tolerability The study reached the tolerability cutoff for general tolerability; no early study cessation occurred due to intolerance. Active stimulation was considered perfectly tolerated in 73.5%, good in 17.3%, bearable in 8.5%, poor in 0.5%, and fully unbearable in 0.2% (one session in total) of sessions. In 88.7% of active sessions and in 96.2% of sham sessions, no side effects were present. Local pain at the treatment electrode site was reported in 6.4% of active sessions (vs. 1.3% of sham sessions), while the pain intensity was mostly rated as mild to moderate. Local erythema of the treated area was observed in 4.9% of active sessions (vs. 2.5% of sham sessions). These side effects were transient, did not lead to early cessation of the session, and did not require any specific treatment. No serious adverse event occurred in connection with active stimulation. For details of the safety data, see the Supplementary Material. Discussion This study is the first contemporary randomized clinical trial to demonstrate the analgesic efficacy of Rebox electrotherapy across multiple pain conditions, predominantly in patients with acutely exacerbated chronic musculoskeletal back pain. Compared to the sham, Rebox significantly reduced both the average and worst pain scores, thus achieving the primary outcome. The effect size was moderate to high, as determined by Cohen’s d 1 16 17 A significant placebo analgesic response was observed only in the sham-first arm, persisting throughout the washout period. In contrast, subjects first exposed to active stimulation showed a greater reduction in pain in the first period; however, sham stimulation in the second period failed to further reduce pain intensity. Interestingly, the sham-first arm exhibited more pronounced pain reduction at the end of follow-up (i.e., after the second active period), suggesting that initial sham exposure may have primed the nervous system for an enhanced response to active treatment. The cumulative sham and subsequent active stimulation effects reduced average pain to an NRS score of 3.5, approaching the threshold for “no worse than mild pain,” an outcome some authors consider the only clinically acceptable result [ 18 19 20 21 The design of future trials should control for such robust placebo responses to isolate the true biological effect of Rebox, reduce bias from expectancy and contextual factors, and thus strengthen both internal and external validity. Future multicenter trials should employ several methodological strategies including a three-arm design (active, sham, and no-treatment control), baseline expectancy assessment as a covariate, a run-in placebo phase to identify and separate high placebo responders, and harmonized delivery protocols with standardized staff training, scripted patient interactions, and controlled environmental conditions across sites. The duration of Rebox-induced analgesia remains uncertain, as follow-up ceased after the stimulation periods due to capacity and budgetary reasons. Nevertheless, in the active-first arm, significant pain relief persisted until the end of follow-up, lasting at least 3.5 weeks. This beneficial aftereffect is in contrast to the transient effects of TENS, which typically provides pain relief mainly during or immediately after stimulation [ 1 A possible confounding effect of analgesic use was ruled out, as there were no changes in dosage or type of drugs present in any patient before or during the study course. On the other hand, despite the analgesic effect of Rebox, we observed no reduction in analgesic use during the stimulation period. However, this study was not specifically designed to evaluate analgesic consumption, and patients were not provided with guidance or recommendations regarding potential medication adjustments. Future research should explicitly focus on this important aspect. Furthermore, the majority of enrolled patients (76%) experienced an exacerbation of chronic pain, and the mean pain duration was 9 weeks at baseline. Only one patient underwent manual physiotherapy during the study, and no other physical therapy methods were applied. These findings support the genuine analgesic effect of Rebox, as spontaneous pain relief was unlikely. Regarding tolerability, the predefined safety threshold was met in all patients, with no early session cessations or withdrawals from the study. The known side effects of Rebox therapy—mild transient pain and localized erythema at the electrode application site—were more frequently reported during active sessions but remained infrequent overall, with 89% of active sessions and 96% of sham sessions reporting no side effects. These findings suggest that side effects had minimal impact on blinding integrity. No serious adverse events were reported, with 74% of active sessions were rated as having excellent tolerability. Taken together, our findings confirm the safety and favorable tolerability of Rebox therapy. Blinding integrity was further validated by the study nurses, all of whom remained uncertain about the active device assignment. This finding is in contrast to the study by Johannsen et al., where all therapists correctly identified the active treatment, potentially introducing bias [ 6 8 This study does not enable us to draw any conclusions about the biological mechanisms of Rebox action. The observed pain reduction aligns with our long-standing real-world clinical experience with Rebox therapy, which also demonstrates notable secondary effects, including myorelaxation and edema reduction. These findings indicate potential non-neuronal mechanisms of action. Rebox therapy is characterized by highly focused, short-lasting, low-intensity kilohertz-frequency stimulation, distinct from other electrotherapy methods. Recent studies have highlighted multiple effects of kilohertz-frequency stimulation on neural tissue, differentiating it from conventional electrical stimulation [ 22 23 24 25 26 Another less-researched sub-sensory electrotherapy technique, microcurrent therapy (MCT), shares similarities in current intensity range but differs due to its markedly lower current density, lower frequency, and longer stimulation duration at one treatment site. MCT has been shown to enhance tissue regeneration, angiogenesis, and neural sprouting, stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, reduce edema, and support muscle growth and protein synthesis [ 27 + + 2+ 2+ Our study has several limitations. A diverse range of musculoskeletal conditions was included to assess the broad therapeutic potential of Rebox and accelerate patient enrollment, presuming these conditions have physiological commonalities [ 1 15 28 Conclusion Repeated sessions of Rebox electrotherapy resulted in a significant and lasting analgesic effect in patients with nociceptive pain, particularly chronic back pain, compared to the sham. The treatment was safe and well tolerated. These findings support and justify the use of Rebox in clinical practice. Future large-scale studies should further investigate the effects across various clinical populations and explore additional pain-related outcomes. Moreover, our findings underscore the need for neurophysiological research into the biological effects of the Rebox currents and their connection to the placebo response.
