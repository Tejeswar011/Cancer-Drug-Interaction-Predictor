This narrative review examined the composition and dynamic changes of vaginal microbiota during carcinogenesis, focusing on mechanistic insights linking microbial dysbiosis to tumor immunity. Notably, commensal bacteria exhibit diverse immunoregulatory functions that can either potentiate or inhibit anti-tumor responses. Clinical evidence further reveals that CST IV microbiota associates with significantly elevated cancer risk, while probiotic interventions show promise in restoring immune surveillance. Critical gaps in standardization of microbiota-based therapies are addressed, emphasizing the need for strain-specific characterization and optimized delivery systems. Collectively, deciphering vaginal microbiome-immune crosstalk opens new avenues for precision interception against cervical cancer.

The latest figures from the American Cancer Society show that cervical cancer ranks second in diagnosed gynecological malignancies, with a notable rise in cases among younger individuals.  1 The female reproductive system, akin to the gastrointestinal system, supports a diverse array of unique microbiomes. A healthy vaginal microbial environment is dominated by Lactobacillus 8 9  2 Lactobacillus  3 Recent studies have highlighted similarities and close connections between the female gastrointestinal and vaginal system ( Figure 1  3  4  4 Gardnerella Prevotella Atopobium Sneathia Megasphaera  3  5 Figure 1. Interactions of the microbiome within the female reproductive system: Bacteria migrate among the urinary, reproductive, and gastrointestinal tracts through both direct and indirect pathways. The detection of shared bacterial species across these different anatomical locations suggests a significant likelihood of a continuous microbiome. The vaginal microbiome is susceptible to influences from hormonal changes and exogenous bacteria, both of which can alter the homeostasis of the vaginal environment. In this diagram exploring bacterial interactions in the female reproductive system, microorganisms in the urinary, reproductive, and gastrointestinal tracts migrate via both direct and indirect paths, with hormonal fluctuations and exogenous bacteria impacting the vaginal microbiome. Although direct studies of specific bacterial species in cervical cancer and immune modulation have not been as extensively conducted as those in gastrointestinal tumors, insights based on the gut microbiome offer valuable perspectives. Findings from these studies highlight the immunomodulatory roles of specific bacteria and their metabolites, which are likely to have parallels in the vaginal environment. This narrative review aims to bridge the gap by discussing the potential implications of gut microbiome research for understanding cervical cancer, focusing on bacterial compositional changes, potential immunomodulatory effects, and therapeutic value in cervical cancer. The search strategy for this review is as follows. Electronic searches of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were conducted to retrieve eligible papers published since 2005.

Dynamic factors influencing vaginal microbiota composition: Multiple factors can influence the composition of the vaginal microbiota throughout a woman’s life. Racial and Ethnic Diversity: Women from different racial and regional backgrounds exhibit distinct characteristics in their vaginal microbiota composition. Lifespan Changes: The vaginal microbial composition experiences dynamic shifts in response to hormonal variations. Particularly, Lactobacillus levels peak at birth and then gradually decrease as age advances, a change that influences vaginal homeostasis substantially. Menstruation & Pregnancy: Hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy significantly impact the vaginal microbiome, with potential implications for health. Others: Genetics, stress, sexual activity, hygienic status, living habits, and obesity also contribute to the variability in vaginal microbiota composition. Influences on vaginal microbiota: Race, ethnic background, hormonal life changes, lifestyle and genetic factors significantly impact vaginal microbiota composition throughout a woman’s life, affecting vaginal health. Lactobacillus  16 Lactobacillus Lactobacillus  21  21 Lactobacillus Lactobacillus Lactobacillus  22 In women of reproductive age, menstruation and pregnancy are the most impactful events on hormonal levels, which dynamically regulate glycogen production and pH levels in the epithelium, resulting in alternating dominance between lactobacilli 23 24 lactobacillus lactobacilli lactobacillus 23 24 In addition to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy significantly influences vaginal microbiota composition. Early in pregnancy, there is a notable shift toward a Lactobacillus-dominant microbiome, accompanied by a substantial decrease in bacteria linked to vaginal dysbiosis.  18  18  25 Lactobacillus  26 Flora Structure Shifts in Cervical Cancer Among a multitude of pathogenic bacteria, Helicobacter pylori  27  28 E. coli Clostridium difficile 29 30  31  29 32 34 HPV infection is widely acknowledged as a primary etiological factor in cervical cancer. However, among patients infected with high-risk HPV types, only approximately 10% progress to develop cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC), with the majority experiencing self-resolving infections.  35 3 5 36 37 Atopobium Gardnerella Allobaculum Enterococcus Clostridium  38 Lactobacillus 39 40 Figure 3 Sneathia sanguinegens Anaerococcus tetradius Peptostreptococcus anaerobius 41 43 Lactobacillus L. crispatus L. iners L. crispatus  42 Lactobacillus Figure 3. Vaginal microbiota composition in health and disease: Under healthy conditions, the vaginal microbiota is predominantly composed of Lactobacillus species, which play a crucial role in maintaining vaginal homeostasis and providing effective protection against pathogenic microorganisms. However, in the presence of cervical epithelial lesions, the balance of the vaginal microenvironment is disrupted. This disruption leads to a significant decrease in Lactobacillus abundance and a notable increase in vaginal microbial diversity. Consequently, dysregulated immune responses ensue, causing chronic inflammatory damage. These changes further compromise the integrity of the cervical epithelium, exacerbating HPV infection and promoting tumor progression. In health, vaginal microbiota is composed mainly of Lactobacillus, which maintains vaginal homeostasis and protects against pathogens. With cervical lesions, Lactobacillus decreases, and microbial diversity increases, leading to inflammation, cervical damage, HPV infection, and tumor growth. Microbial Dysbiosis and Immunological Environment of Cervical Cancer Lactobacillus Lactobacillus Figure 4 Figure 4. The antagonistic interaction between probiotics and pathogenic bacteria: Probiotics exert a protective effect on cervical health by maintaining microbial balance, producing lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, reducing HPV colonization, lowering levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and preserving the integrity of the epithelial barrier. In contrast, pathogenic bacteria promote HPV colonization and cervical epithelial damage by increasing levels of inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-10), activating antigen-presenting cells (APCs), causing an imbalance in the Th1/Th2 response, inducing chronic inflammation, facilitating persistent HPV infection, and disrupting hormonal balance, thereby accelerating the progression of cervical cancer. The image illustrates a diagram that compares the effects of probiotics and pathogenic bacteria on the progression of HPV infection to cervical cancer. Probiotics prevent HPV infection and cervical cancer by maintaining a healthy microbial balance, producing lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, clearing HPV, lowering pro-inflammatory cytokines, and strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier. In contrast, pathogenic bacteria promote HPV infection and cervical cancer by increasing inflammatory cytokines, activating antigen-presenting cells, causing imbalances in the Th1/Th2 response, chronic inflammation, persistent HPV infection, and altering hormonal balance.

Among cervical cancer patients, changes in the vaginal microbial composition were observed, with a dramatic decrease in the Lactobacillus Anaerococcus Peptostreptococcus Porphyromonas Prevotella Gardnerella vaginalis Sneathia genera  57 Gardnerella vaginalis  58 Gardnerella vaginalis Prevotella  46 Gardnerella vaginalis Lactobacillus  59 Gardnerella  60  61  46 3 46 62 63  64  65 Probiotics and Their Regulatory Effects on Immune Cells in Tumor Microenvironment Lactobacilli  3 47 66 Figure 5 Figure 5. Probiotics’ regulatory impact on immune cells: Probiotics exert a modulatory effect on various immune cell types through intricate regulatory mechanisms that enhance both innate and adaptive immune responses. Specifically, probiotics suppress the proliferation of immune cells that have a negative regulatory role, thereby fostering a more robust and efficient immune microenvironment. This beneficial effect is crucial for the clearance of HPV infections and effectively guards against the development of cervical epithelial lesions. Furthermore, the interaction among different immune cells forms a more complex reaction pathway, which amplifies the immune response and contributes to a comprehensive defense mechanism against pathogens. Immune cells response to probiotics: Probiotics modulate immune cells through complex regulatory mechanisms, suppressing negative regulatory cells and enhancing immune response for effective HPV clearance and prevention of cervical epithelial lesions. 17.8 Lactobacillus and innate immune modulation The positive impact of Lactobacillus Lactobacillus  67 Lactobacillus gasseri lactobacilli  68 Lactobacillus and macrophage modulation Macrophages are crucial in innate immune response,  69 Lactobacillus  70 L. johnsonii Lactobacillus 70 72 Lactobacillus and adaptive immune modulation The adaptive immune system represents a sophisticated defense mechanism capable of identifying and responding to specific pathogens. Through the collaborative efforts of various immune cells, it provides long-lasting protection and immunological memory. Lactobacillus and dendritic cells Antigen presentation, a cornerstone of adaptive immunity, is crucial for the human immune system to identify and eliminate tumor cells. The potential of Lactobacillus-derived metabolites to activate dendritic cells (DCs) has been previously reported.  73 Lactobacillus 74 77 Lactobacillus intestinalis  78  79 Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lactobacillus rhamnosus  80 Lactobacillus and cytotoxic CD8 + Recent research into Lactobacillus Lactobacillus  81  82 Lactobacillus Lactobacillus  81 Lactobacillus johnsonii L. johnsonii  83  83 Lactobacillus and regulatory T cells Tregs are a subset of T cells marked by CD4 and CD25 expression and high levels of the transcription factor Foxp3, primarily function to maintain immune homeostasis by suppressing excessive immune responses and regulating immune tolerance. However, Tregs are also commonly implicated in tumor immune evasion. The Fong team reported indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICA) derived from Lactobacillus lactis  84 Lactobacillus Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lactobacillus rhamnosus  85 Immunomodulatory Functions of Anaerobic Tumor-Associated Bacteria Tumor-associated bacteria are characterized by a group of anaerobic bacteria residing in the hypoxic region with rising abundance in tumor patients.  86 3 38 40 Lactobacillus  87 87 90 Figure 6 Figure 6. Regulatory impact of anaerobes and BV-associated bacteria on immune cells: Anaerobes and bacteria associated with BV typically stimulate the proliferation of immune cells that exert negative regulatory effects. The regulatory mechanisms involve several detailed pathways. Butyrate Production: Anaerobic bacteria produce butyrate, which promotes the differentiation and stability of Tregs by enhancing histone acetylation and activating PPARγ. This activation inhibits HIF-1α and modulates the mTOR pathway. Propionic Acid Effects: Propionic acid inhibits the differentiation and function of dendritic cells by blocking histone deacetylases, reducing the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, and promoting Treg differentiation. In addition, it suppresses macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses and enhances tumor cell proliferation. Tumor-Associated Pathogens: The surface proteins of bacteria initiate pro-oncogenic signaling cascades upon direct interaction with host cells through TCR signaling pathways, leading to the activation of downstream signaling networks. This process remodels the immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby fostering tumor progression. The regulatory impact of anaerobes and BV-associated bacteria on immune cells Bacteria-derived SCFAs in immune modulation Bacteria-derived SCFAs and macrophage polarization Previous research focused on the impact of bacteria-derived SCFAs on macrophages has revealed significant insights. Hezaveh’s team reported that low-concentration butyrate promoted tumor metastasis by upregulating the H19-MMP15 pathway, which in turn promoted the differentiation of M2-type macrophages in a mouse model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  91  92 +  93  93  94 Bacteria-derived SCFAs and DC maturation Previous studies have indicated that treatment with propionic acid suppresses the activity of HDAC1 and HDAC3, leading to a significant decrease in the expression of critical transcription factors PU.1 and RelB, which are essential for dendritic cell maturation. This inhibition hinders the differentiation of myeloid precursor cells into dendritic cells.  95  96 Bacteria-derived SCFAs and cytotoxic T cell regulation Prior studies have investigated the regulatory influence of SCFAs on CD4⁺/CD8⁺ T cells. Zhu’s team reported a positive correlation between bacteria-derived butyrate and the expression levels of CD8⁺ and Vδ2⁺ T cells in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Individuals exhibiting a favorable response to anti-PD-1 therapy had significantly higher serum butyrate levels compared with non-responders.  97  98  98 Bacteria-derived SCFAs and Treg regulation Tregs are typically recognized for their negative regulatory role within the immune milieu. Research focused on human autoimmune diseases has noted an upregulation of Foxp3 expression and TGF-β1 production subsequent to the application of propionic acid.  99 100 101 100 101  102  102  103  104 Tumor-associated bacteria and immunosuppressive microenvironment Bacterial structural proteins have been reported to reshape the tumor microenvironment.

According to the clinical trial involving 117 women affected by bacterial vaginosis or vaginitis with concomitant HPV-infections, antibiotic treatment plus vaginal Lactobacillus  113 114 115 Lactobacillus L. gasseri L. jensenii  59 Lactobacillus  59  116 Lactobacillus 117 118 Figure 7 Figure 7. Impact of microbial dysbiosis on cervical cancer therapy: Various strains of vaginal and intestinal microbiota are color-coded to indicate their beneficial or detrimental effects. Overall, a healthy microbial environment enhances the regulatory function of T cells, improving individual immune function and leading to increased immune cell infiltration and activation within tumors. This is partially associated with the modulation of immune checkpoint molecules by probiotics within the tumor microenvironment, enhancing the immune response against tumor and reducing their ability to evade immune surveillance. Microbial dysbiosis is correlated with poor prognosis, often characterized by the presence of anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, and the ectopic colonization and proliferation of gut bacteria, which are positively associated with reduced responses to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy in cervical cancer. Consequently, the combined use of antibiotics and probiotics appears to aid in the reconstitution of a healthy microbiome, protect epithelial integrity, and eliminate HPV infections. Therapeutic vaccines based on Lactobacillus also seem to reverse HPV infection status. If microbial dysbiosis persists, chronic inflammation will continuously trigger the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, ultimately leading to immune dysregulation and a loss of defense against HPV infection and cancer progression. The diagram illustrates the impact of tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing factors on prognosis, treatment efficacy, and microbial therapy in cervical cancer. It highlights the role of gut microbiota in disease progression, with a focus on Lactobacillus, intestinal immune response, and the effects of various bacteria on treatment outcomes. Probiotics-based therapeutic HPV vaccines Engineered probiotic-based vaccines are emerging as an innovative immunotherapeutic approach against HPV.  119 Lactobacillus  120 44 114  114 Table 1 Table1.

Conclusion Increasing progress have been made in depicting the landscape of vaginal microbiota and its multifaceted role in cervical cancer. Although specific microbial strains or molecular pathways implicated in tumor progression have been identified, a holistic understanding of the intricate regulatory network remains elusive. The vaginal microbiota in cervical cancer patients is highly heterogeneous, underscoring the necessity for personalized treatment paradigms. These require standardized and rigorous evaluation through multicenter randomized controlled trials, complemented by dynamic monitoring to delineate long-term benefits and potential adverse effects. Studies on the gut microbiome provides valuable insights into the potential roles of the vaginal microbiome in cervical cancer, there is an urgent need for more direct studies focusing on cervical cancer. Future research should be directed toward unraveling the precise mechanisms by which vaginal bacteria modulate immune responses and influence tumor progression in cervical cancer, which could enhance our comprehension of the disease and provide theoretical evidence for the development of targeted and effective therapeutic strategies.
