It is the most common form of dementia (≈75% of all dementia cases), affecting about 47 million people worldwide, and this number is estimated to increase to 152 million by 2050. 2 3 Senile plaques, which comprise large extracellular aggregates of insoluble fibrillar amyloid β peptide (Aβ), 4 5 6 7 8 9 BDNF and TrkB-FL mRNA and protein levels were shown to be decreased in the brain of AD patients when compared to healthy controls. 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 2+ N d 16 , 17 18 In this work, we aimed to leverage this knowledge to design a new therapeutic strategy for AD and to provide proof-of-concept results of its efficacy and safety. First, we demonstrate that TrkB-FL cleavage is a relevant mechanism for human disease by examining protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and the protein and mRNA profiles of postmortem AD human brains. Second, we show that TrkB-ICD overexpression caused dendritic spine loss and altered excitatory synaptic transmission, and it impacted the transcriptomic profile of synapse-related genes in primary cultured neurons. Third, with the aim of preventing TrkB-FL cleavage and TrkB-ICD formation, we designed peptides spanning the cleavage site of TrkB and fused to the TAT (Trans-Activator of Transcription) sequence, analyzed their conformational stability in silico in vitro ex vivo in vivo Results TrkB-FL cleavage is a hallmark of AD-related pathology progression in humans, and it correlates with the levels of Aβ 1-42 The decreased expression of BDNF and TrkB-FL in the brains of AD patients can either be (1) mechanistically implicated or (2) a by-product of AD progression. To address this question, we examined the status of TrkB-FL cleavage in samples from human patients with AD-related pathology at different stages of disease severity. We evaluated TrkB-FL cleavage in CSF samples from three groups of human patients with (1) mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but no evidence of Aβ deposition or neuronal injury (MCI controls), (2) MCI due to AD-high likelihood, or (3) frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Compared to MCI controls, patients with MCI due to AD showed increased levels of TrkB-ICD fragment and of the TrkB-ICD:TrkB-FL ratio, even though no significant changes in TrkB-FL levels were found ( Figures S1 1-42 Figure S1 Figures S1 1-42 1-42 Figure 1 1-42 Figures 1 Figures S1 1-42 Figures S1 Figure 1 Cleavage of TrkB-FL is a hallmark of AD progression, and it is correlated with the levels of Aβ 1-42 (A) Heatmaps of pairwise correlation p n n 1-42 1-42 R p −3 −3 Figures S1 1-42 n n n p −3 p −3 NTRK2 SV2B n n n p Figure S1 Tables S1 S2 Additionally, we analyzed postmortem inferior temporal cortical parenchyma samples from human patients with AD-related pathology in different Braak stages. TrkB-FL protein levels were decreased in the later stages, compared to earlier stages of the disease (by western blot: Figures 1 Figure S1 Figure 1 Figure S1 NTRK2 Figure 1 TrkB-ICD overexpression causes loss of dendritic spines, alters synaptic transmission, and impacts the expression levels of synapse-related genes Overall, the data above suggest that TrkB-FL cleavage may be implicated in the mechanisms driving AD progression by (1) compromising canonical BDNF signaling and/or (2) favoring TrkB-ICD formation, which may propagate Aβ-triggered toxicity. 16 , 18 To explore the effects of excess TrkB-ICD on neuronal morphology and activity, we transduced cultured primary cortical neurons with lentiviruses (LVs) expressing TrkB-ICD (or EGFP, as a control), under the regulation of the neuron-specific CaMKIIα promoter 19 Figure 2 Figures 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 18 Figure 2 The cleavage product TrkB-ICD causes dendritic spine loss and neuronal hyperexcitability and changes the expression levels of synapse-related genes (A) Schematic diagrams of the LV payload.

Yellow arrowheads label cells co-expressing MAP2 (a neuronal marker) and the LV payload, while blue arrowheads indicate untransduced neurons. Quantifications of transduction efficiency and neuronal selectively are shown in (C) and (E) for LV-GFP and LV-ICD, respectively ( n n n p p −3 n n n n p −2 p −2 p p p p Figure S2 To validate the model, we quantified the expression levels of TrkB-ICD through western blot analysis and found them to be significantly increased in neurons transduced with LV-ICD as compared to both LV-GFP-transduced and untransduced controls, while the endogenous levels of TrkB-FL were not impacted by TrkB-ICD overexpression ( Figures 2 Figures S2 18 To study the structural and functional implications of TrkB-ICD overexpression, we assessed (1) cell viability through the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, (2) spine density through immunocytochemistry studies, and (3) spontaneous excitatory neuronal activity through whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. While TrkB-ICD overexpression did not overtly affect cell survival ( Figure S2 Figures 2 Figures 2 To gain deeper insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms, we next isolated RNA from transduced and untransduced primary cortical neurons and performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). A lentiviral transduction was performed in a set of two out of three conditions (LV-GFP and LV-ICD), while, in another set (untransduced and LV-GFP), TrkB-ICD was not overexpressed. This experimental design allowed us to set up the statistical contrasts in a way that distinguishes effects due to the overexpression of TrkB-ICD (specific) from effects due to the LV transduction procedure itself (unspecific) (see materials and methods First, we performed differential gene expression analysis and found 360 genes to be differentially expressed due to TrkB-ICD overexpression (at false discovery rate [FDR] <0.05), while only 58 genes changed due to the transduction procedure. Second, we performed gene set enrichment analysis and found several Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched for both contrast levels. To discern which of these were specifically associated with TrkB-ICD overexpression, we compared the normalized enrichment scores (NESs) of all tested GO terms for both contrasts and found 23 GO terms to be specifically upregulated due to TrkB-ICD overexpression ( Figure 2 Figure S2 Figure 2 Figures S2 Figure 2 Nkd2 Cend1 Rtn4rl1 Ttl Gpr3 Ciapin1 Tafa2 Nefl Nefm Kif5c Abca7 Sik1 Hs3st1 Cdkn2d Gpr26 Pank1 Gdf11 Nnmt Unc13a Slc10a4 Cadps Ddn Slc35d3 Calb1 Npy2r Atf4 Slc20a1 Plcl1 Got1 Overall, these results show that TrkB-ICD overexpression can cause dendritic spine loss, alter excitatory synaptic transmission, and drive transcriptome-wide changes in genes encoding for synaptic proteins. A TAT-TrkB peptide with a lysine-lysine linker is conformationally stable and prevents TrkB-FL cleavage To prevent the excessive accumulation of TrkB-ICD and to restore canonical BDNF signaling, we designed peptides composed of the sequence spanning the TrkB cleavage site 16 Figures 3 S3 in vivo 20 , 21 Figure 3 A TAT-TrkB peptide with a lysine-lysine linker attenuates TrkB-FL cleavage, has high affinity for cell membranes, and is readily translocated to the cytosol and across an in vitro (A) Schematic depicting the TrkB-FL aminoacid sequence flanking calpains’ cleavage site, and the design of the TAT-TrkB peptide.

Next, we performed electrophysiology and radioactive assays to test whether such reduction in TrkB cleavage suffices to improve synaptic transmission and plasticity under Aβ-toxic conditions. To control for effects specific to the aggregation state of Aβ, we prepared different species of Aβ 1-42 Figure S6 1-42 Figure S7 ex vivo Figure S8 1-42 Long-term potentiation (LTP) is generally regarded as the neurophysiological correlate of cognition.

Chronic administration of TAT-TrkB prevented both learning and memory deficits in 5XFAD mice ( Figures 5 Figures 5 Figures 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 31 , 32 33 Figure 5 Figure S11 To gain a deeper mechanistic insight into the therapeutic effect of the TAT-TrkB peptide on the cognitive behavior of 5XFAD mice, we next evaluated synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices ex vivo WT Veh 5XFAD Veh Figures 5 34 , 35 5XFAD Veh 5XFAD TAT Figures 5 Possibly related to the impairments in synaptic plasticity, we found that vehicle-treated 5XFAD mice had decreased levels of PSD-95 (a postsynaptic protein) and of Synapsin-1 (a presynaptic protein), compared to WT littermates ( Figures 5 Figures 5 Figures 5 Dendritic spines harbor the postsynaptic sites of most excitatory synapses. In line with the results on the protein levels of PSD-95, we observed a loss of dendritic spines in the stratum radiatum Figures 5 Overall, these data suggest that TAT-TrkB improved the performance of 5XFAD mice in hippocampal-dependent learning/memory tasks, which could be mechanistically linked to the effects of the peptide in preventing the loss of postsynaptic sites and the synaptic plasticity deficits in the hippocampus. In vivo To test whether the TAT-TrkB peptide could have disease-modifying properties, we next evaluated its effects on Aβ and p-Tau pathology in 5XFAD mice. 5XFAD mice are known to develop Aβ pathology, with the initial plaques developing already at 4 months of age. 31 Figures 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figures 6 Figure S12 Figures 6 Figure 6 In vivo (A–D) Representative microscopy images of Aβ plaques in the hippocampus and cortex of 6-month-old 5XFAD mice (C and D).

Systemic administration of TAT-TrkB does not cause kidney or liver toxicity In addition to examining the neuroprotective effects of the TAT-TrkB peptide, we aimed to perform preliminary toxicity studies, which we describe below. Throughout the treatment period, we did not observe spontaneous deaths or clinical signs of disease in any animal undergoing treatment with TAT-TrkB (25 mg/kg). We monitored body weight as a general measurement of body condition and observed no significant changes from baseline for up to 9 consecutive weeks of treatment ( Figures 7 Figure 7 In vivo (A and B) Body weight is plotted as a function of experiment duration (A) (data are expressed as mean ± SEM). Changes in body weight from the start to the end of treatment are depicted in (B) ( n n n Furthermore, at the end of the treatment period, a subset of animals was necropsied, the liver and kidneys were collected for histopathological analysis, and blood was harvested for biochemical measurements in the serum. We measured (1) creatine kinase (CK) to assess muscle damage; (2) creatinine and urea to determine kidney function; and (3) aspartate and alanine transaminases (AST and ALT, respectively) to evaluate liver damage. We observed no differences between groups (i.e., no effect of genotype or treatment with TAT-TrkB), and individual levels were within the ranges of reference values 38 Figures 7 n Figures 7 materials and methods Overall, we found no evidence of toxicity resulting from chronic treatment with the TAT-TrkB peptide. Discussion Here, we demonstrate that Aβ-induced cleavage of the cognate receptor of BDNF, TrkB-FL, increases with the neuropathologic severity of AD. The BDNF/TrkB-FL system is dysregulated in AD, from very early stages, as shown by CSF samples from patients with MCI due to AD, but also when AD is fully established, as revealed by the analysis of postmortem inferior temporal cortical parenchyma samples from AD human patients. Since we lack brain parenchyma samples from non-AD patients, we cannot assess whether BDNF signaling deficits in the brain parenchyma occur from the earliest stages of AD, or whether these start only in the intermediate stages of the disease. Furthermore, we cannot ascertain whether TrkB-ICD formation also occurs in the hippocampus of AD patients, since we only analyzed samples from the inferior temporal cortex. Additionally, we found the levels of TrkB-ICD to be increased in CSF samples of FTD patients, suggesting that dysregulation of the BDNF/TrkB-FL system may occur across mechanistically different forms of dementia. In this work, we assessed the potential of TrkB-FL cleavage as a pharmacological target. To this end, we designed small TAT peptides spanning the cleavage site of the receptor. We were able to validate TrkB-FL cleavage as a novel therapeutic target, since the final candidate peptide could prevent (1) TrkB-FL cleavage in vitro in vivo ex vivo in vivo 20 in vitro in vivo We previously mapped the cleavage site of TrkB-FL to residues N520/S521, 16 39 Prevention of excitotoxicity-induced cleavage of TrkB-FL was shown to increase the survival of cultured cortical neurons through phospholipase-C-γ downstream pathways and sustained activation of CREB and MEF2D. 39 40 41 27 Soluble Aβ oligomers exert synaptotoxic effects beyond TrkB-FL cleavage, and several other receptors and pathways have been implicated. 42 43 We cannot, however, exclude that additional processing sites exist within the interdomain region that resides outside the sequence spanned by the peptide. It is challenging to target long stretches of aminoacid sequences with this strategy, since there are constraints to the size of therapeutically useful TAT peptides—specifically, toxicity increases and the ability to cross cellular membranes decreases as a function of the total peptide length. 44 39 Regardless, the level of protection afforded by TAT-TrkB was sufficient to prevent the loss of BDNF effects on synaptic transmission and plasticity ex vivo The exact neuroprotective mechanism of the TAT-TrkB peptide remains unclear, and some of its effects could be cell type specific. However, the evidence presented here allows us to build a case for at least three potential mechanisms. First, TAT-TrkB prevented the Aβ-driven loss of BDNF fast synaptic actions on glutamate release and ex vivo 45 , 46 47 48 , 49 Even though it is generally accepted that Aβ is upstream of Tau hyperphosphorylation, how the two are linked remains a major unresolved question for the understanding of AD pathophysiology. A previous study has implicated that astrocyte reactivity could play such a role. 50 The therapeutic potential of TAT-TrkB may be enhanced further when combined with BDNF mimetics and/or with existing (e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors, NMDA receptor antagonist) and experimental therapies (e.g., β-secretase inhibitors, immunotherapy, plasmapheresis). 51 52 53 , 54 16 55 56 In summary, TAT-TrkB specifically blocks a disease mechanism of AD whose therapeutic potential has not been addressed before.

CT01) metabolism. For the experiment in Figure S7 mEPSC recordings mEPSCs of isolated primary neurons (DIV14–16) were evaluated by whole-cell patch-clamp immediately after treatments, as performed routinely in the lab. 68 Figures 2 + + h A 2 2 Analysis of mEPSC events was performed using Mini Analysis software (Synaptosoft). The event detection threshold was set at 3-fold the root mean square baseline (noise). mEPSC frequency, average amplitude, and rise and decay times were determined by analyzing 5- to 10-min recording periods per cell. RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing RNA extraction RNA was extracted from primary cortical neurons at DIV10 using the NZY Total RNA Isolation Kit (NZYtech, catalog no. MB13402), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified RNA samples were analyzed using a 2100 Bioanalyzer Instrument (Agilent, catalog no. G2939BA) to assess mRNA quantity and quality, as reflected by rRNA levels and integrity. Only samples with RNA integrity values >8.0 were used for library preparation. Library preparation and sequencing Libraries were prepared from 1 μg total RNA using the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit version 2 (Illumina, catalog no. RS-122-2001) and loaded on an Illumina NextSeq500 system with a 150-cycle high output kit version 2.5 (Illumina, catalog no. 20024906) using the following read lengths: 80 cycles for read 1, 8 cycles for TruSeq single index, and 80 cycles for read 2.

Homogenates were clarified by centrifugation (16,000 × g m 2 Studies of biophysical interaction of TAT-TrkB with liposomes Preparation of liposomes Liposomes were used as in vitro 74 Partition coefficient determination The partition coefficients (Κ P 75 76 To obtain adjusted absorption spectra, the absorption spectra of liposomes without TAT-TrkB were subtracted from the absorption spectra in the presence of TAT-TrkB. Then, the light scattering of liposomes was removed, and the band resolution improved by determining its second derivative. The partition coefficients of TAT-TrkB were determined from the second derivative spectra at a wavelength where the light scattering of large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) was completely removed, applying a nonlinear least-squares regression to the following equation ( Equation 1 T (Equation 1) D T = D W + ( D m − D W ) K P [ L ] V m 1 + K p [ L ] V m D T D m D W K P [ L ] V m −1 −1 V m −1 V m −1 Membrane fluidity studies by DLS DLS was used to determine modifications on the membrane fluidity of LUVs induced by TAT-TrkB. This method evaluates changes in the optical properties of lipids through the variation of the mean count rate (MCR) with increasing temperature. By ensuring that the size and concentration of LUVs do not vary throughout the experiment, the variation of the MCR can be attributed to modifications in the membrane structure. Thus, we determined the temperature at which alterations on the lipid physical state occur, known as the main phase transition temperature (T m 77 m Equation 2 (Equation 2) M C R = A 2 − A 1 1 + 10 B ( 1 / T − 1 / T m ) + A 1 M C R A 1 A 2 B T T m BEB translocation and integrity assays To evaluate the ability of the TAT-TrkB peptide to translocate the BEB, we used a well-established in vitro 26 Figure S5 in vitro Aβ species preparation and characterization Aβ species preparation Aβ peptide 1–42 (1 mg/mL) (GenicBio, catalog no. A-42-T) was resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1% ammonia solution and adjusted to a final pH 7.2. Species separation was based on an ultrafiltration process, as previously described. 78 280 −1 −1 g 280 −1 −1 Aβ species characterization Aβ species (0.5 μg) were characterized by (1) SDS–PAGE in 4%–15% gradient gels (Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Protein Gels; Bio-Rad, catalog no. 4561083), followed by western blot (mouse monoclonal anti-Aβ antibody [6E10]; 1:1,000; BioLegend, catalog no.

The 5XFAD mice and WT littermates (24–25 weeks old) were sacrificed, under deep isoflurane anesthesia, by cervical displacement. In either case, the brain was quickly removed, hemisected, and one or both hippocampi were dissected free within ice-cold aCSF, previously gassed with 5%/95% CO 2 2 Aβ incubation procedures For the experiments in Figures 3 S3 25-35 16 Figure S7 1-42 Figures 4 S8–S10 1-42 80 1-42 40 , 78 , 81 , 82 83 Immunofluorescence PI staining of Aβ 1-42 After treatments, hippocampal slices were incubated with 500 nM PI (Sigma, catalog no. 81845) in gassed aCSF for 30 min at room temperature and then fixed in 4% PFA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 28908) in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. Next, slices were dehydrated with sequential solutions of 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose, embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Sakura Finetek, catalog no. 4583) and stored at −80°C. Serial 20-μm-thick hippocampal sections were cut on a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S, Leica Biosystems) and mounted on SuperFrost Plus glass slides (Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 10149870). Hippocampal slices were then rehydrated and boiled three times in a 10-mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Afterward, slices were treated with blocking solution (3% [w/v] BSA in PBS with 0.1% [v/v] Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, slices were incubated with a primary mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN [A60] antibody (1:200 in blocking solution; Millipore, catalog no. MAB377) overnight at 4°C. Slices were subsequently washed and incubated with a secondary goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:200 in blocking solution; Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. A-11001) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Afterward, slices were washed, incubated with 5 μg/mL Hoechst-33258 dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. H3569) for 5 min, washed again, mounted in Mowiol mounting solution, and imaged on the inverted fluorescent microscope Axiovert 135 TV (Zeiss). Staining of brain slices from 5XFAD mice One day after the last injection of TAT-TrkB or vehicle, mice were euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, i.p.), followed by cardiac perfusion with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4). The brain was quickly removed and hemisected, and the right hemisphere was fixed in 4% PFA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 28908), in PBS (pH 7.4) for 48 h at 4°C. Subsequently, the right hemisphere was washed and embedded in sucrose in sequential steps of 15% and 30% for 48 h each at 4°C. The right hemisphere was then embedded in gelatin for cryosectioning. Serial 50-μm-thick brain sections were cut on a cryostat (Leica CM3050 S, Leica Biosystems) and mounted on SuperFrost Plus glass slides (Fisher Scientific, catalog no. 10149870). Slices were first washed in TBS at 37°C to remove the gelatin, briefly post-fixed in 4% PFA (10 min, room temperature), and subsequently washed in TBS (3 × 5 min). Next, the tissue was permeabilized (0.25% Triton X-100 in TBS [pH 7.4]) for 10 min and incubated with blocking solution (5% BSA, 5% FBS, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS [pH 7.4]) for 1 h at room temperature. Afterward, slices were incubated with the primary (overnight at 4°C) and secondary antibodies (2 h at room temperature), with washing steps in between (TBS, 3 × 5 min). Antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-Aβ (W0-2) (1:500; Millipore, catalog no. MABN10), rabbit monoclonal anti-p-Tau (Ser416) (D7U2P) (1:250; Cell Signaling Technology, catalog no. 15013), and rabbit polyclonal anti-MAP2 (1:200; Abcam, catalog no. ab32454). The following secondary antibodies were used: goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. A-11004), goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (1:200; Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. A-11011), and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. A-21245). Simultaneously with the secondary antibodies, samples were incubated with DAPI (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog no. D1306) and, for the experiments in Figures 5 Analysis of imaging data For each group of experiments, all images were acquired in the same imaging session using the same laser power and exposure time. All representative images are shown with equalized brightness and contrast.

Z stacks (step size: 0.57 μm) spanning the entire thickness of the slice at each location were flattened onto a maximum intensity projection. Flattened images were thresholded and binarized using the Otsu method to segment and define the region of interest (ROI) for each plaque. Segmented ROIs with small areas (<50 μm 2 n n p-Tau expression levels For each sample, six fields were imaged, with a 60× objective, across different regions of the hippocampus. Z stacks (step size: 0.26 μm) spanning the entire thickness of the slice at each location were flattened onto a maximum intensity projection. A circular/ellipsoid ROI was manually centered on each p-Tau + – n Z – Figure 6 + Z Extracellular ex vivo Slices were transferred to a submerging chamber (1 mL) and continuously superfused at a 3-mL/min rate, with gassed aCSF at 32°C. Perfusion tubes were coated with 0.1 mg/mL BSA prior to BDNF experiments to avoid BDNF adsorption to the tubes. 85 stratum radiatum 68 , 85 stratum radiatum 86 I/O curves The stimulus delivered to the slice was decreased until no fEPSP was evoked and subsequently increased by increments of 20 μA. Data from three consecutive averaged fEPSPs were collected for each stimulation intensity. The range of inputs delivered to slices typically ranged from 60 μA to a supramaximal stimulation of 400 μA. LTP induction and saturation A weak LTP-inducing θ-burst protocol consisting of 4 trains of 100 Hz, 4 stimuli, separated by 200 ms was used (4 × 4). 68 For the experiments in Figures 4 S9 27 For the experiments in Figures 4 S10 28 , 85 For the experiments in Figure S10 PPF recordings PPF was quantified as the ratio between the second versus the first fEPSP slope (fEPSP2/fEPSP1) responses at different interstimulus intervals (10–150 ms). 68 Analysis of extracellular recordings For I/O curves, maximum slope values were obtained by extrapolation upon nonlinear fitting. Whenever the stimulus was intense enough to elicit a population spike (depolarization that follows the fEPSP), its amplitude was measured. Each population spike amplitude replicate was plotted as a function of the slope of the associated fEPSP, and the popspike/fEPSP ratio was calculated as the quotient between these values. 68 LTP magnitude was quantified as the normalized change in the average slope of the fEPSPs 50–60 min after LTP induction, relatively to the average slope of the fEPSPs measured during the 10 min that preceded the induction. The LTP saturation index (SI) was calculated as the quotient of the sum of the three LTP magnitudes by the magnitude of the first LTP ([LTP1+LTP2+LTP3]/LTP1; hence, if SI ≈ 3, then LTP is fully saturated; if SI >3, then LTP is not saturated; the higher the SI, the more desaturated the LTP). [ 3 Synaptosome isolation The synaptosomal fraction from rat hippocampi was prepared as routinely performed in the lab. 16 , 87 1-42 g g g g [ 3 [ 3 l 3 16 , 87 2 2 3 88 + + + Figures 4 S10 Calculation of the effect of BDNF on glutamate release The fractional release was expressed as the percentage of total radioactivity present in the synaptosomes at each time point. To quantify the effect of BDNF, internal control curves (performed in parallel within the same synaptosomal batch) were subtracted from BDNF curves. The incremental release induced by BDNF was quantified by integration of the area of the S2 peak upon subtraction of the estimated basal tritium release. Intraperitoneal administration of TAT-TrkB The TAT-TrkB peptide (25 mg/kg) was diluted in saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and administered i.p., starting at 4 months of age, to either 5XFAD mice or WT littermates, for up to 9 consecutive weeks, 5 days/week ( Figure 5 20 , 89 , 90 , 91 89 , 92 , 93 Heterozygous transgenic (5XFAD) mice and WT littermates were each randomly allocated to a treatment regime, dividing them into four groups: WT mice receiving either vehicle (0.9% NaCl) or TAT-TrkB (25 mg/kg) injections, and 5XFAD mice receiving either vehicle (0.9% NaCl) or TAT-TrkB (25 mg/kg) injections ( Figure 5 Behavioral assessments All behavioral tests were performed during the light phase between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. in a sound-attenuated room. Behavioral assays were performed in the following sequence: OF test, EPM test, and, lastly, MWM test. Experimenters were blinded to animal genotype and treatment group for the duration of the behavioral testing. Mazes were cleaned with a 30% EtOH solution between each animal. Open Field test The OF test was used to assess locomotor and anxiety-like behavior with the objective of detecting biases in animal behavior that could affect performance in other behavioral tests. The OF test was conducted in a wood open field arena (40 × 40 × 40 cm). 94 , 95 Figure S11 Mice movements were recorded and analyzed using SMART video-tracking software (version 2.5, Panlab, Harvard Apparatus Spain). The reference point used by the software to determine the position of the animal was the center of the mouse’s dorsum. The total distance traveled and the average speed were quantified to compare locomotor ability. Also, the percentage of time spent in the central zone was used as an inverse indicator of an anxiety-like behavior. Lighting conditions, physical apparatus, environmental clues, and animal manipulation procedures were kept as similar as possible between animals. Elevated Plus Maze test The EPM maze is shaped like a plus sign and consists of two open arms (no walls, 5 × 29 cm) and two closed arms (5 × 29 × 15 cm), arranged perpendicularly, and elevated 50 cm above the floor. Each animal was placed at the center of the maze, facing an open arm, with each test lasting 5 min. Mice movements were recorded and analyzed using SMART video-tracking software. The (1) total time spent in the open arms and the (2) total number of arm entries (i.e., sum of the number of entries in both open and closed arms) were used as anxiety-like and locomotor parameters, as previously described. 96 Morris Water Maze test Spatial memory was evaluated with the MWM test. 97 During habituation, each animal was familiarized with the presence of an escape platform—in this instance, placed in the center of the tank, 1 cm above water level. Animals were placed in the platform and after 20 s, they were placed back in their home cages beneath heat lamps. If the animals failed to stay on the platform for 20 s and did not climb back after 2 min, then they were guided to it and allowed to stay for an additional 20 s. Animals had a second habituation period later in the same day, with the escape platform still placed in the center of the tank, but at 1 cm below water level. During the acquisition phase, the escape platform was submerged 1 cm below water level in a fixed position, randomized for each animal, in the center of the target quadrant. Furthermore, visual cues of different shapes and colors were placed on the walls of the testing room. Each mouse was given four swimming trials per day (with 30-min intervals between trials). A trial consisted of placing the animal in the pool facing the wall and allowing it to explore and reach the hidden platform. Each animal was released from a different and randomized quadrant (different from the one holding the escape platform) in each trial of the same day. If the animal reached the platform before 60 s, then it was allowed to remain there for an additional 10-s period; if the animal failed to find the target within that time frame, then it was manually guided to the platform, where it was allowed to remain for an additional 20 s. After the end of each trial, mice were removed from the pool and placed back in their home cages beneath heat lamps to prevent temperature loss. During the probe test, the escape platform was removed, and animals were allowed to swim freely for 60 s while recording the percentage of time spent on each quadrant. Mice movements were recorded and analyzed using SMART video-tracking software. The latency to find the platform during the acquisition phase and the percentage of time spent in the target quadrant in the probe test were quantified and used to evaluate hippocampal-dependent memory. Kidney and liver histopathology One day after the last injection of TAT-TrkB or vehicle, mice were euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, i.p.). For each mouse analyzed, a comprehensive necropsy was performed and macroscopic findings were recorded. Kidneys and liver were harvested for histopathologic evaluation. Samples were immersion-fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Bio-Optica, catalog no. 05- K01009 Slices were deparaffinized and rehydrated using an Autostainer XL (Leica, catalog no. ST5010) by subsequently immersing them in the following solutions: xylene, 10 min; EtOH 100%, 5 min; EtOH 96%, 5 min; and distilled water, 5 min. Rehydrated slices were then stained with hematoxylin (Bio-Optica, catalog no. 05-06004E) and eosin (Sigma, catalog no. HT110132). Briefly, slices were treated with (1) hematoxylin, 3 min, and then rinsed with distilled water, 1 min; (2) 0.5% ammonia water, 10 s, and then rinsed with distilled water, 1 min; (3) EtOH 96%, 30 s; and finally, (4) Eosin Y solution, 10 min. Afterward, slices were dehydrated with one change of EtOH 96% and two changes of 100% EtOH, 2 min each. Finally, slides were coverslipped using Entellan mounting medium (Sigma, catalog no. 1.00869) and an automated glass coverslipper (Leica, catalog no. CV5030). Microphotographs were obtained with a Hamamatsu NanoZoomer-SQ slide scanner (Hamamatsu, catalog no. C13140 The microphotographs were evaluated by a certified pathologist and lesions were classified according to a 5-tier severity scale: 0, absent; 1, minimal; 2, mild; 3, moderate; and 4, marked. 98 Blood collection and clinical chemistry One day after the last injection of TAT-TrkB or vehicle, mice were euthanized with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg, i.p.).
