Microbial biomolecules act as natural reducing and capping agents, ensuring nanoparticle stability and preventing aggregation ( He et al., 2007 Singh et al., 2016 Gengan et al., 2024 Streptomyces Prakash et al., 2014 Boomi et al., 2020a Kumari et al., 2020 Ielo et al., 2021 Bharadwaj et al., 2021 Lange et al., 2019 Microorganisms adapted to extreme saline environments often exhibit unique metabolic pathways that are advantageous for the synthesis of bioactive compounds, including nanoparticles. Compared with commonly employed bacterial or fungal strains, actinomycetes are associated with lower risks of toxin and spore production, thus providing a safer platform for biosynthesis processes. In this study, we investigated the green synthesis of AuNPs using Streptomyces 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Preparation of sterile mycelial supernatant from Streptomyces Soil samples were collected from the saline land around Wujiaqu City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and the collected soil samples were dried at 100°C, ground and sieved (400 mesh), the soil obtained after sieving was divided into portions of 5 g each, and spread in the bacterial Petri dish, after which, sterilized Actinobacillus solid medium was slowly poured into the Petri dish to cover the soil and put into the incubator for cultivation at a constant temperature of 28°C, and the cultivation temperature was 28°C. The incubation temperature was 28°C. Actinomycetes were isolated from the soil samples by utilizing the characteristic that actinomycetes are able to produce aerial mycelium while bacteria cannot, and were further cultured for identification. YJD18 were cultured in Actinomyces liquid medium (Qingdao Hope Bio-Technology Co., Ltd) under constant shaking at 180 rpm and 28°C for 72 h. The actinomycete mycelia were harvested by centrifugation at 9500 rpm for 20 min and subsequently washed three times with sterile distilled water to ensure removal of residual media components. A 1 g wet biomass sample was suspended in 50 mL of sterile distilled water and incubated for 72 h at 180 rpm and 28°C following incubation, the cell-free supernatant was obtained by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was filtered using JIAO JIE qualitative filter paper (Fushun City Civil Affairs Filter Paper Factory, China) to remove any remaining debris. This cell-free supernatant was subsequently used for AuNPs synthesis. The identity of YJD18 was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the sequence has been deposited in the NCBI GenBank database under the accession number PV291671 2.2 Synthesis of AuNPs A mixture of 50 mL sterile mycelial supernatant and 50 mL chloroauric acid solution (analytical grade, purchased from Benze Reagents) was prepared in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask, with the final concentration adjusted to 1 mM. The mixture was reacted in a boiling water bath for 30 min. Color changes (from light yellow to ruby red with noticeable transparency) were observed and recorded. Samples were taken every 10 min to measure absorbance at wavelengths between 200 and 800 nm using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer. 2.3 Optimization of AuNP synthesis conditions To ensure the stability and high quality of the synthesized AuNPs, key synthesis parameters were systematically optimized using single-factor experiments. The formation and characteristics of AuNPs were monitored by UV–Visible (UV–Vis) spectroscopy. The parameters optimized included: Mycelial Biomass-to-Water Ratio: Ratios of 1 g:100 mL, 3 g:100 mL, 5 g:100 mL, 7 g:100 mL, and 9 g:100 mL were evaluated to determine the optimal biomass concentration for efficient nanoparticle synthesis; Chloroauric Acid Concentration: Final concentrations of 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM, 1.5 mM, and 2.0 mM were tested to identify the most effective precursor concentration; Supernatant-to-Water Volume Ratio: Ratios of 1:4, 2:3, 1:1, 3:2, 4:1, and 5:0 were examined to assess the impact of extracellular metabolites on nanoparticle formation; pH: A broad range of pH values (3.00, 5.00, 6.00, 6.25, 6.50, 7.00, 8.00, 9.00, and 10.00) was investigated to determine the optimal pH for AuNP biosynthesis; Resuspension Time: Mycelial resuspension durations of 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h were compared to optimize the extraction of active biomolecules involved in the reduction process; Boiling Time: Heating durations of 0, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 min were tested to evaluate the influence of thermal treatment on nanoparticle formation and stability. 2.4 Characterization of AuNPs The synthesized AuNPs were characterized using the following analytical techniques: UV–Visible Spectroscopy (UV-3100PC, Shanghai Meipuda Instruments Co., Ltd.): Absorption spectra were recorded over the wavelength range of 200–800 nm with a resolution of 1 nm; Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (FEI Talos F200X): The morphology of the particles was examined at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV under ambient conditions; Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED): The crystalline structure of the AuNPs was analyzed based on the diffraction pattern obtained during TEM imaging; Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Zeta Potential Analysis (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90): The particle size distribution, polydispersity index (PDI), and surface charge (zeta potential) of the AuNPs were measured; X-ray Diffraction (XRD) (Rigaku Ultima IV): The crystalline structure was determined using a scanning range of 20°–80°, with a step size of 0.02° and a scanning speed of 2°/min; Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) (Thermo Nicolet iS20): Functional groups associated with the AuNPs were identified in the spectral range of 400–4,000 cm −1 −1 2.5 Cytotoxicity evaluation of AuNPs 2.5.1 Cell culture The cytotoxicity of the synthesized AuNPs was evaluated using a panel of human cell lines, including cervical cancer (HeLa), breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), lung cancer (A549), liver cancer (HepG2), and two normal cell lines: normal liver (WRL-68) and normal kidney (293 T). Key reagents used in this study included fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin–streptomycin antibiotics, trypsin, high-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), RPMI-1640 medium (Biological Industries), MTT reagents (BIOFROXX), cisplatin (Bide Pharm), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Beijing Coolaber Technology Co., Ltd.). HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, whereas all other cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics. Cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO₂ until reaching approximately 80% confluency. 2.5.2 Cytotoxicity assay The cytotoxicity of the synthesized AuNPs was evaluated using the MTT assay. The procedure was as follows: Cells at approximately 80% confluency were harvested using trypsinization and adjusted to a density of 1 × 10 5 Cell viability (%) was calculated using the following formula: Viability ( % ) = A s A c × 100 where A s Ac Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, and differences were considered statistically significant at p 2.6 Statistical analysis In this study, the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) was used as the statistical tool to evaluate the significance of the research, specifically SPSS version 27.0. All quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from three independent biological replicates ( n t p 3 Results 3.1 Synthesis of AuNPs As shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 UV–Vis absorption spectra of sterile supernatant, chloroauric acid, and YJD18-synthesized AuNPs.

Panel a shows a single nanoparticle, panel b displays a cluster, and panel c shows a linear arrangement. Panel d presents a diffraction pattern with concentric circles. The right side features an X-ray diffraction graph with peaks at 2θ values corresponding to (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes, indicating crystalline structure. 3.3.2 Zeta potential and dynamic light scattering (DLS) The Zeta potential of the synthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was measured to be −11.6 mV, with a sharp and narrow unimodal distribution, indicating relatively uniform surface properties among the particles. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis revealed a hydrodynamic diameter distribution with the main peak located around 20–30 nm on a logarithmic scale, suggesting a concentrated size distribution and good monodispersity. The sharp peak shape without significant tailing further indicates minimal particle aggregation and a narrow size distribution, reflecting the favorable dispersibility of the synthesized AuNPs ( Figure 4 Figure 4 (a) (b) Two graphs labeled a and b. Graph a shows Intensity versus Zeta Potential in millivolts, with a peak at approximately zero. Graph b shows Percentage versus Particle Size in nanometers, with a peak around 100 nanometers. Both graphs display sharp peaks, indicating distinct distributions. 3.3.3 Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR spectra ( Figure 5 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 Figure 5 FTIR spectra of supernatant (a) (b) Two infrared (IR) spectra are shown: (a) Supernatant with peaks at 3406, 3051, 2950, 1650, 1543, and others; (b) AuNPs with peaks at 3396, 2929, 1655, 1406, and others. Both axes are labeled with absorbance and wavenumber in inverse centimeters. Peaks are annotated with molecular vibrations such as O-H, C-H, C=O, and X-H. 4 Dose-dependent cytotoxicity of AuNPs across tumor and Normal cell lines With escalating concentrations of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), significant morphological alterations were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, characterized by roughened cell surfaces, vacuole formation, and decreased cell density ( Figure 6 Figure 7 50 Table 1 50 Table 1 Figure 7 50 Table 1 Figure 6 Microscopic images (40× magnification) showing the cytotoxic effects of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), mycelial supernatant, and cisplatin (CDDP) on cervical cancer cells (HeLa).HeLa cells were treated with increasing concentrations (0–800 μg/mL) of AuNPs and supernatant, as well as with cisplatin as a positive control. Cell morphology changes, including cell shrinkage, rounding, and detachment, were observed with increasing concentration, especially at ≥500 μg/mL for AuNPs and ≥700 μg/mL for supernatant. CDDP treatment caused marked cytotoxic effects. All images were captured under 40× magnification; scale bar = 200 μm. Microscopic images comparing AuNPs and supernatant-treated cells at different concentrations (0 to 800 micrograms per milliliter) and a CDDP control. The images show varying cellular responses, with denser clustering and more disruption observed in AuNP-treated cells as concentration increases, compared to supernatant-treated cells which maintain a more consistent appearance. Each image segment measures 200 micrometers.

AuNPs show consistent effectiveness in reducing wound visibility and increasing cell viability compared to the supernatant. 6 Antioxidant activity of AuNPs In this study, observations from Figure 9 Figure 9 50 Figure 9 Representative images illustrating the DPPH free radical scavenging effects of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), sterile mycelial supernatant and vitamin C. * p p p Bar chart showing clearance rates against concentration in micrograms per milliliter for three groups: Vc, supernatant, and AuNPs. Vc consistently has the highest rate, followed by supernatant and AuNPs, across all concentrations from zero to nine hundred. 7 Discussion The optimization experiments for gold nanoparticle (AuNP) synthesis revealed that synthesis efficiency did not increase with escalating gold ion concentrations as expected. Notably, ultraviolet (UV) absorption peaks were detected at 0.5 and 1.0 mM, with the latter exhibiting greater absorption intensity than the former. This indicates that within the lower concentration range, elevated gold ion levels enhance AuNP synthesis, resulting in increased UV–Vis absorbance. Conversely, at higher concentrations, particle aggregation or size alterations occur, causing a shift in the UV–Vis spectrum ( Valsalam et al., 2019 Sathiyapriya et al., 2024 Ahmed et al., 2020 Patel et al., 2025 Hu et al., 2019 Krishnan and Lakshmanan, 2024 Britto et al. (2017) Morphological attributes of nanoparticles, including texture, size, and shape, serve as critical descriptors, with size being a key factor in biological activity. Chen et al. (2022) in vitro Lee et al. (2015) Adabi et al., 2017 Maffre et al., 2011 Muthukumar et al., 2016 Pan et al., 2007 Das and Velusamy, 2014 we performed FTIR analysis to compare the functional groups present in the sterile mycelial supernatant and the synthesized AuNPs. The FTIR spectra revealed peaks corresponding to O–H stretching (broad peak around 3,400 cm −1 −1 Ahmed et al., 2020 Narayanan and Sakthivel, 2011 In wound healing experiments, microscopic analysis and data indicated that AuNP concentrations <30 μg/mL significantly enhanced healing at 24 and 48 h. Compared to the untreated control, treated groups showed a notable reduction in wound area, with a concentration-dependent decrease up to 30 μg/mL, corroborating findings by Hu et al. (2019) Zgheib et al. (2019) Boomi et al. (2020b) Regarding antioxidant activity, the DPPH radical scavenging assay showed that the biosynthesized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in this study exhibited moderate free radical scavenging capacity, which increased notably with concentration, consistent with the findings of Ahn et al. (2018) Donga et al. (2020) Markus et al., 2017 Patra et al., 2016 Tang et al., 2015 in vivo in vitro Sharma et al., 2019 Huang et al., 2020 Kumar et al., 2021 Li et al., 2022 Singh et al., 2020 8 Conclusion This study successfully achieved the biosynthesis of AuNPs using extracellular secretions from YJD8, with optimized reaction conditions and comprehensive evaluation of their cytotoxicity. Future research should explore surface functionalization or conjugation with specific targeting ligands to enhance cellular selectivity and minimize off-target toxicity, thereby facilitating broader and more effective applications in cancer therapeutics.
