Intratumoral fibrosis was identified as an adverse factor in papillary and medullary carcinomas, but it has not been investigated in other subtypes. We aimed at exploring the presence of intratumoral fibrosclerosis in a cohort of 132 non-papillary follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas (53 follicular and 31 oncocytic carcinomas, including 10 high grade differentiated thyroid carcinomas and 48 poorly differentiated carcinomas) and correlating its presence and extent with clinical and pathological features and survival. For each case, all available hematoxylin and eosin slides were reviewed, and the presence of fibrosclerosis was assessed as the percentage of tumor area and semi-quantitatively scored as absent, mild (≤ 10%) or extensive (> 10%). In addition, digital image analysis was applied in 65 cases. Scoring of intratumoral fibrosis showed a strong agreement between two observers and between observers and digital image quantification. The presence and extent of intratumoral fibrosis were significantly associated with poorly differentiated carcinoma histology, large tumor size, extent of vascular invasion, presence of necrosis, high mitotic index, positive nodal status, and aggressive clinical outcome, and with a shorter disease-free and disease-specific survival, the former also in follicular and oncocytic carcinomas analyzed separately. These data support the potential use of fibrosis in the clinical practice since it is both easily assessable and significantly associated with the presence of parameters of aggressiveness. In addition, fibrosis is correlated with decreased survival rate independently from the tumor histotypes, suggesting its potential role as novel prognostic factor in non-papillary follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas.

In a recent meta-analysis, age > 45 years, male sex, tumor size > 4 cm, multifocality, extrathyroidal extension, widely invasive subtype, and the presence of cervical lymph node metastasis and/or distant metastases were identified as the most relevant factors that increase the risk of death of patients with FC [ 1 2 3 4 5 The presence of widely invasive subtype and extensive vascular invasion is also relevant negative prognostic factors in OC [ 6 8 9 Within the group of high-grade follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinoma (HG-FCDTC), poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC) subtype possesses a specific tumor architecture and clinical pathological characteristics. In this subtype, the extent of invasion has been also shown to affect disease-free survival [ 10 11 12 13 Apart for pure pathological characteristics, the presence of molecular alterations has a low impact in the prognostic stratification of FC, OC, and PDC. In FC, mutation burden but not RAS 14 TERT 15 16 17 Among pathological parameters potentially bearing a prognostic impact, intratumoral fibrosis has been investigated in thyroid cancer, but most data are restricted to papillary carcinoma (PC) [ 18 19 20 21 Few data are available on the significance of intratumoral fibrosis in the other non-papillary thyroid carcinoma subtypes. This is more probably related to the low prevalence of non-papillary carcinoma histotypes that hampers the analysis of large series. This study by Xu and coworkers mentioned above [ 19 22 23 24 25 Based on the above, the aim of our work was to explore the presence of intratumoral fibrosclerotic changes in a large series of non-papillary, non-anaplastic, follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas, to test interobserver variability and the usefulness of digital image analysis, and to correlate the presence and extent of intratumoral fibrosis with clinical and pathological characteristics. Material and methods Case series From the pathology files of the “Città della Salute e della Scienza” academic hospital (Turin, Italy), a non-consecutive series of 132 surgical specimens of non-papillary, non-anaplastic, follicular cell-derived thyroid cancers was retrospectively selected from years 2000 to 2017. The cases consisted of 53 follicular carcinomas (FC), 31 oncocytic carcinomas (OC), and 48 poorly differentiated carcinomas (PDC). All cases were reviewed and re-classified according to the most recent WHO classification of thyroid tumors [ 26 27 2 The following parameters were assessed and recorded: sex, age at diagnosis, tumor diameter, presence of tumor capsule, presence of capsular invasion, presence of vascular invasion, extent of vascular invasion (≥ or < 4 blood vessels involved), presence of necrosis, mitotic index in 2 mm 2 18 28 Before the study started, all cases were de-identified and coded by a pathology staff member not involved in the study, and all data were accessed anonymously. The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee (#610, date December 20th, 2017) and conducted in accordance with the principles set out in the Declaration of Helsinki. Considering the retrospective nature of this research protocol and that it had no impact on patients’ care, no specific written informed consent was required. Evaluation of intratumoral fibrosis To evaluate intratumoral fibrosis, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides of each case were reviewed independently by two investigators (EV and GVT). All available slides were evaluated for each case (from 1 to 32, mean 12). Fibrosclerotic changes were estimated evaluating all available sections at 4 × objective magnification, to assess in each field the percentage of fibrosis in the tumor area, to calculate the final percentage for each case. In selected cases (# 7), Masson’s trichrome and silver staining for reticulin were performed for determining the presence and extent of fibrosis. Fibrosclerotic changes included generally thin inter-follicular fibrous tissue deposition or wide inter-nodular fibrous septa, these latter either intratumoral or stemming from the tumor capsule and penetrating into the lesion (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Representative images of intra-tumoral fibrosclerotic changes, occurring as inter-follicular fibrosis ( a b d c e f The cases were scored based on the percentage of tumor area with fibrosclerotic tissue and then sub-grouped into cases with absent = 0, mild = 1 (from 1 o to 10%), and extensive = 2 (> 10%) fibrosclerotic changes for statistical purposes. The type of fibrous tissue deposition (inter-follicular vs. inter-nodular) was not further considered for statistical purposes. All cases with a discordant result between the two observers, namely, those that were grouped differently, were evaluated in one session at a multi-head microscope by all participants to the study, to exclude biases due to the presence of unspecific stromal changes (i.e., edematous or artifactual changes) and to reassess the percentage of fibrosis in each discordant case, in blind of the previous scoring. The result obtained by the collegial revision was then used for statistical purposes. A selected series of 65 cases with a positive score at light microscopy for mild or extensive fibrosis was also analyzed using digital image analysis (on Aperio Scanner ScanScope XT; Leica Biosystems) testing the concordance between the estimation of the percentage of fibrosis per tumor area under light microscopy and an automated quantification by means of the digital image software Aperio ImageScope version 12.4 (Leica Biosystems). These cases were selected among the 78 cases with fibrosis, excluding those with a quality of H&E adequate for light microscopy evaluation, but inadequate for optimal digital microscope scanning (i.e., with alterations in terms of heterogeneity of thickness or staining artifacts that would have prevented optimal focusing of the scanner). For each case, 2 random fields of 20 mm 2 1 2 2 Statistical analysis All the graphs, calculations, and statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software version 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The differences in the distribution of variables were analyzed using parametric and non-parametric tests (Student’s t p Results Interobserver reproducibility of fibrosis evaluation Two independent pathologists (EV and GVT) reviewed all H&E slides and scored the cases recording the percentage of tumor area with fibrosclerotic changes, irrespective of the type of fibrous tissue deposition.

The prognostic impact of the presence of fibrosclerotic changes was investigated in terms of both disease-free survival and disease-specific survival, in parallel with main known prognostic parameters in non-papillary, non-anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, such as age, extent of vascular invasion, pTN stage, and status of the resection margins (Table 2 Table 2 Univariate survival analyses Disease-free survival analysis Parameter All cases (# 126) FC and OC, only (#77) PDC, only (#48) HR a b p HR [CI] p HR [CI] p Age (> 55 vs ≤ 55) 2.84 [1.53–5.3] 0.0037 12.36 [3.76–40.5] 0.002 0.68 [0.28–1.67] 0.34 PDC vs FC + OC 5.2 [2.70–10.02] < 0.0001 / / / / OC vs. FC / / 0.14 [0.04–0.45] 0.026 / / Fibrosis (0 vs. 1–2) 0.21 [0.11–0.38] < 0.0001 0.17 [0.05–0.55] 0.009 0.52 [0.22–1.24] 0.22 Extent of vascular invasion (≥ 4 vs. < 4) 3.49 [1.85–6.57] 0.001 3.04 [0.86–10.7] 0.083 Not tested (4 cases with < 4 positive vessels, only) pT3-4 vs. pT1-2 4.98 [2.68–9.26] < 0.0001 8.12 [0.86–10.7] 0.001 1.00 [0.38–2.63] 0.99 pN + vs. pN0 4.82 [1.79–12.94] < 0.0001 Not tested (3 cases with pN + , only) 2.38 [1.03–5.45] 0.041 Resection margins (R1 vs. R0) 1.78 [0.90–3.52] 0.067 1.52 [0.34–6.7] 0.53 0.98 [0.47–2.05] 0.98 Disease-specific survival analysis Parameter All cases (# 126) FC and OC, only (#77) PDC, only (#48) HR [CI] p HR [CI] p HR [CI] p Age (> 55 vs. ≤ 55) 3.3 [1.42–7.69] 0.019 Not tested (5 cases died of disease, only) 0.98 [0.32–3.07] 0.98 PDC vs. FC + OC 5.84 [2.46–13.9] < 0.0001 / / Fibrosis (0 vs. 1–2) 0.05 [0.02–0.13] < 0.0001 0.27 [0.08–0.86] 0.027 Extent of vascular invasion (≥ 4 vs. < 4) 3.44 [1.48–7.99] 0.014 Not tested (4 cases with < 4 positive vessels, only) pT3-4 vs. pT1-2 5.64 [2.44–13.02] 0.001 1.49 [0.42–5.30] 0.54 pN + vs. pN0 4.88 [1.37–17.33] < 0.0001 1.73 [0.59–5.00] 0.31 Resection margins (R1 vs. R0) 1.88 [0.78–4.53] 0.11 1.08 [0.40–2.88] 0.88 a HR b CI In our series, age > 55 years, extensive vascular invasion (≥ 4 involved blood vessels), high pT stage and positive nodal status were all parameters associated with shorter survival in both disease-free and disease-specific survival analyses. Positive resection margin status, although with a trend to significance, failed to show a statistically proven association with poorer prognosis. Histological PDC subtype was a strong indicator of poor prognosis in both disease-free and disease-specific survival analyses (Fig. 3 p p 2 Fig. 3 Kaplan–Meier estimates of disease-free and disease-specific survivals according to tumor histotype ( p p a b c f The association between fibrosclerotic changes and adverse clinical outcome described above was strongly confirmed by univariate survival analyses. In fact, cases with absence, presence of mild or extensive fibrosclerotic changes were associated with progressively poorer survival in both disease-free and disease-specific survival analyses (Fig. 3 3 2 3 Discussion In the present study, the aim was to assess the presence and prognostic value of intratumoral fibrosis in non-papillary, non-anaplastic follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas. Intratumoral fibrosis has been shown in different studies to be associated with aggressive disease characteristics in papillary carcinoma [ 18 29 30 31 Fibrosclerotic changes were observed more frequently in PDC, but a relevant proportion of FC and OC cases, including HG-DTC, also had intratumoral fibrosis, although predominantly mild. Intratumoral fibrosis shared different patterns in the different histological types, probably as a consequence of the tumor structures. In fact, FC showed a predominant inter-follicular pattern, whereas PDC and OC showed a predominant inter-nodular pattern in the presence of a more solid/trabecular or large nesting architecture. However, several cases had mixed patterns of intratumoral fibrosis and the pattern itself, irrespective of the extent of fibrosclerotic changes, failed to show statistical significance in preliminary analyses (data not shown). In selected cases, we added to conventional H&E special histochemical stains, to highlight the tumor architecture and the presence of fibrous tissue in cases of hard interpretation, but they did not represent an added value, and were not subsequently employed. Another aim of the study was to assess the interobserver reproducibility of fibrosclerotic changes evaluation, to support its potential use as an additional morphological parameter to be included in the characterization of the thyroid cancer histotypes here investigated. The percentage of intratumoral fibrosis per tumor area was recorded by two independent investigators, and the correlation between them was almost perfect. Moreover, in selected cases, we added digital imaging quantification of intratumoral fibrosis, and the investigators strongly agreed with automated quantitative evaluation. Overall, these data show that the evaluation of the presence and extent of intratumoral fibrosis is an easy to assess and reproducible tool in the pathological work-up of thyroid carcinoma. The presence of fibrosclerotic changes was scored as absent, mild, or extensive for the statistical comparisons and to design a simple categorization. Although this simplified approach could have caused loss of information, it met the need of an easy semi-quantitative scoring system for clinical purposes adding a novel possible information on patient prognosis. The presence of fibrosclerotic changes clearly characterized cases with aggressive pathological features, such as PDC subtype of HG-FCDTC, presence of necrosis, increased mitotic index, positive nodal status, and positive resection margins. By contrast, intratumoral fibrosis was not significantly correlated with either tumor pT stage or tumor size. Concerning the latter, it proved to be statistically significant overall, but extensive fibrosclerotic changes were observed even in cases with a size < 2 cm. Invasive properties of tumors were differently associated with intratumoral fibrosis. In fact, the presence and extent of fibrosclerotic changes correlated with the presence of capsular invasion, whereas vascular invasion was not associated with it, except for extensive (≥ 4 blood vessels involved) angioinvasive PDC cases. Finally, aggressive clinical course, in terms of tumor relapse with or without disease-related deaths, was significantly associated with intratumoral fibrosis, with 34/41 aggressive disease cases (83%) having fibrosclerotic changes, as compared to 44/84 (52%) cases associated to a clinically indolent disease. Nonetheless, most of the associations described above are possibly biased by the more common occurrence of fibrosclerotic changes in PDC histotype, that is characterized by a more aggressive pathological phenotype. Taking this into consideration, survival analyses planned to weight the prognostic impact of intratumoral fibrosis were conducted, whenever possible, both in the whole series and separately in PDC and FC plus OC subgroups. Sub-analysis comparing the whole group of HG-FCDT (PDC plus HG-DTC) to FC and OC was also conducted. This approach helped to exclude possible histotype-related biases, although it caused a decrease in the potency of statistical analyses due to the lower number of included cases. Reliability of survival models was supported by the fact that almost all know prognostic factors we included in the analyses (age, histological type, extent of vascular invasion and pTN stage) showed a statistical significance, in both disease-free and disease-specific survival tests. Noteworthy, fibrosclerotic changes (comparing absence vs. presence, irrespective of its extent) were among the strongest statistically significant factors influencing prognosis in both disease-free and disease-specific survival models. Subgroup analysis of disease-free survival in FC and OC, only—either including or excluding HG-DTC cases—confirmed the strong association of the presence of fibrosclerotic changes with an increased risk of tumor relapse, whereas in disease-specific survival analysis of PDC subtype and in the whole group of HG-FCDTC, fibrosclerotic changes were associated with an increased risk of disease-associated death. Intratumoral fibrosis and cancer are closely related. More or less extensive desmoplastic stroma is a feature of several carcinomas, including breast, pulmonary, and pancreatic ones, and it was found to be associated to tumor progression [ 32 33 34 35 36 34 COL1A1 ACTA2 37 In conclusions, intratumoral fibrosclerotic changes represent a novel potential prognostic factor in non-papillary, non-anaplastic, follicular cell-derived thyroid carcinomas (follicular, oncocytic and HG-FCDTC, with special reference to its PDC subtype). Fibrosclerosis is significantly associated with the presence of parameters of aggressiveness, and with decreased disease-free and disease specific survival rates, independently from the tumor histotype. The evaluation of intratumoral fibrosis is also easily assessable both manually and with the aid of digitalization system, with a very high interobserver agreement, supporting its potential use in the clinical diagnostic practice.
