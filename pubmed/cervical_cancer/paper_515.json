Introduction Breast cancer is a heterogeneous and multifactorial disease, resulting from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes that transform normal cells into cancerous ones [ 1 α α α 2 3 4 5 Curcumin, a natural polyphenol of Curcuma longa 6 8 9 11 κ 8 12 10 12 Research has shown that curcumin not only promotes cell death but also reinstates tamoxifen sensitivity in breast cancer cell lines resistant to antiestrogen therapy [ 10 13 17 18 5 With the completion of the Human Genome Project, our understanding of the complexity and functional significance of lncRNAs has expanded considerably [ 19 20 21 Several circulating lncRNAs, including metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 HOX transcript antisense RNA cytoskeleton regulator RNA growth arrest-specific transcript 5 22 26 27 28 Similarly, UCA1 has emerged as a key player in cancer progression and therapy resistance. Its role in conferring resistance to anticancer drugs has been well established across multiple cancer types [ 29 β 30 31 α 32 33 Another well‐characterized oncogenic lncRNA, HOTAIR, functions as a molecular scaffold for chromatin‐modifying complexes and is known to promote breast cancer progression by inhibiting tumor suppressor miRNAs while activating pro‐oncogenic miRNAs [ 34 Suv39H1 35 Additionally, CYTOR has been implicated in breast cancer resistance to tamoxifen, where it enhances tumor cell survival by aberrantly activating the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, a key pathway in tumor proliferation and drug resistance [ 4 25 26 36 Collectively, these findings underscore the critical roles of circulating lncRNAs in breast cancer progression, therapy resistance, and biomarker potential. Their functional diversity and ability to modulate key oncogenic pathways highlight their promise as diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic targets in precision oncology. In addition to breast cancer, lncRNAs have also been shown to play important roles in central nervous system (CNS) tumors such as glioblastoma and meningioma [ 37 39 40 43 44 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Clinical Study 2.1.1. Study Design and Participants and Trial Treatment This study was conducted on volunteer patients diagnosed with breast cancer who had undergone primary treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, and subsequently initiated adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen. The study specifically focused on patients with luminal breast cancer subtypes, who have hormone receptor–positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative status, as these patients are typically treated with tamoxifen as part of standard hormone therapy. In contrast, HER2‐positive patients, who usually receive Herceptin (trastuzumab) in addition to tamoxifen, were excluded to maintain the study’s focus on endocrine therapy response in HER2‐negative cases. In this trial, NanoCurcumin [ 13 17 Following volunteer patient selection, an initial blood sample was collected prior to the administration of tamoxifen. The study population was divided into two groups: the target group ( n n 2.1.2. Ethics The current study was approved by the Vice Chancellor of Research Affairs of Tarbiat Modares University (Code: IR. MODARES.REC.1401.001). Informed consent was signed by all study participants prior to conducting the trial. The study was conducted in accordance with all contemporary medical ethics practices, as well as policies outlined by the university and inherent to the field. 2.1.3. Plasma Sample Collection and RNA Extraction Peripheral blood samples were collected from both the target and control groups using BD Vacutainer Venous Blood Collection Tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an anticoagulant. Immediately after collection, samples were stored at refrigerated temperatures and processed for plasma isolation. To achieve optimal plasma separation, samples were first subjected to centrifugation at 1900 g g 2.1.4. RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and Real‐Time PCR Total RNA was extracted from 200 μ For quantitative gene expression analysis, real‐time PCR (qPCR) was performed using the RealQ Plus 2x Master Mix Green, High Rox (Amplicon, Denmark). Reactions were carried out on an ABI Step One Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, California, United States) under the following cycling conditions: 95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 20 s, repeated for 40 cycles. Specific primers for the target genes were designed, validated, and ordered to Copenhagen, Denmark, with primer sequences and expected amplicon sizes detailed in Table 1 45 Table 1 Primer sequences for real‐time PCR amplification of lncRNAs and U6 control. This table provides the primer sequences used for the real‐time PCR amplification of MALAT1, CYTOR, HOTAIR, UCA1, GAS5, and U6 (internal control). Total RNA was extracted from plasma samples using the miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Advanced Kit (QIAGEN), followed by cDNA synthesis with the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific). Real‐time PCR was performed using the ABI Step One System (Applied Biosystems, California, USA) with RealQ Plus 2x Master Mix Green, High Rox (Amplicon, Denmark). U6 was used as the endogenous control for normalizing lncRNA expression levels.

Bioinformatics Analysis Expression data for lncRNA MALAT1 in tamoxifen‐sensitive and tamoxifen‐resistant breast cancer cells across four cell lines were extracted from the GEO database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ 2.3. In Vitro Studies 2.3.1. Cell Culture The MCF7 and MCF10 breast cancer cell line was obtained from the Pasteur Institute Cell Bank in Tehran. Cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing L‐glutamine (Zist Kala) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco), supplemented with 1% penicillin‐streptomycin (Zist Kala). The cells were incubated in a 5% CO 2 2.3.2. Treatment of MCF7 Cells With Tamoxifen and NanoCurcumin To establish a tamoxifen‐resistant model, MCF7 cells were long‐term exposed to gradually increasing concentrations of tamoxifen (over 4 months) following our laboratory’s established protocol [ 46 27 28 41 47 53 50 To evaluate the combined effects of tamoxifen and NanoCurcumin, cells were cotreated with 10‐ μ 13 16 54 55 Cells were cultured continuously under selective pressure and monitored monthly for changes in MALAT1 lncRNA expression profiles. 2.3.3. RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and Real‐Time PCR Total RNA was extracted using NORGEN total RNA purification kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA quality and quantity were assessed by gel electrophoresis and NanoDrop, respectively. RNA was treated with RNase‐free DNase 1 (Fermentase). cDNA synthesis and real‐time PCR were subsequently performed. 3. Results 3.1. Clinical Study Results MALAT1, UCA1, CYTOR, HOTAIR, and GAS5 expressions were compared between breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen alone (control) and those treated with tamoxifen plus NanoCurcumin (target group). Fold change in MALAT1, UCA1, CYTOR, HOTAIR, and GAS5 expression from Month 6 relative to Month 1 was calculated for each patient in both groups. The results indicated that the addition of NanoCurcumin to tamoxifen therapy led to a significant decrease in MALAT1 expression in the target group compared to the control group; expression changes in other lncRNAs were not significant, although they were in the direction we expected (Figure 1 Figure 1 NanoCurcumin enhances tamoxifen response by modulating expression of lncRNAs associated with drug resistance in breast cancer cells. As shown in the graph, the combination of NanoCurcumin and tamoxifen resulted in a relative reduction in MALAT1, UCA1, HOTAIR, and CYTOR expression and a relative induction in GAS5 expression, which suggests a decrease in tamoxifen resistance. The bar graph presents the fold change ratio of MALAT1, UCA1, HOTAIR, CYTOR, and GAS5 expression in tamoxifen‐treated and tamoxifen + NanoCurcumin–treated groups.

In Vitro Studies 3.3.1. Comparison of Breast Cancer and Normal Breast Cell Lines We compared MALAT1 expression between the MCF7 breast cancer cell line and the normal breast cell line MCF10 using qRT‐PCR. MALAT1 expression was significantly higher in MCF7 compared to MCF10 (Figure 2 Figure 2 MALAT1 expression is significantly elevated in tamoxifen‐sensitive MCF7 breast cancer cells compared to nontumorigenic MCF‐10 cells. Quantitative real‐time PCR analysis revealed significantly higher expression of the long noncoding RNA MALAT1 in MCF7 estrogen receptor–positive breast cancer cells relative to nontumorigenic MCF‐10 mammary epithelial cells. Expression was normalized to U6 and is presented as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired two‐tailed Student’s t p 3.3.2.

The Challenge of Tamoxifen Resistance in Breast Cancer Breast cancer remains a significant cause of cancer‐related mortality, with estrogen receptor–positive (ER+) subtypes comprising the majority of cases. Tamoxifen has been the mainstay of endocrine therapy for ER+ breast cancer; however, its long‐term efficacy is often compromised by the emergence of resistance, which occurs in 20%–30% of patients [ 1 2 5 20 4 20 32 33 47 48 56 The dysregulation of MALAT1 has been linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer, where its upregulation activates oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/AKT, Wnt/ β 47 49 51 4.2. NanoCurcumin Suppresses MALAT1 and Modulates Other lncRNAs Our clinical findings demonstrate that the combination of NanoCurcumin with tamoxifen results in a significant reduction in MALAT1 expression compared to tamoxifen alone, with a statistically significant p 46 47 14 49 50 The in vitro experiments provide further mechanistic validation, illustrating that MALAT1 expression is markedly higher in MCF7 cells compared to normal breast epithelial MCF10 cells, suggesting a cancer‐specific role for MALAT1 in driving oncogenic processes. Importantly, our study elucidates the temporal dynamics of MALAT1 expression during prolonged tamoxifen treatment, demonstrating that while tamoxifen initially suppresses MALAT1 expression, its levels begin to rise again after 4 months, potentially marking a key transition toward resistance. The addition of NanoCurcumin effectively counteracted this resurgence, sustaining low MALAT1 levels throughout the treatment course. This finding is particularly relevant, as it suggests that MALAT1 upregulation may serve as an early biomarker of impending resistance, and its suppression via NanoCurcumin could offer a novel intervention strategy. Statistical analyses using two‐way ANOVA and unpaired t 4.3. Mechanistic Insights: How NanoCurcumin Regulates MALAT1 The exact molecular mechanisms through which NanoCurcumin regulates MALAT1 expression remain an area of active investigation, though multiple lines of evidence suggest plausible pathways. MALAT1 is known to function as a ceRNA, sequestering tumor‐suppressive microRNAs such as miR‐561‐3P, miR‐125b, and miR‐218, thereby promoting oncogenic gene expression [ 20 27 28 10 18 β 47 51 52 53 57 4.4. Clinical and Translational Implications of Our Findings The translational implications of these findings are profound. As resistance to tamoxifen remains a major clinical hurdle, the integration of lncRNA‐modulating agents such as NanoCurcumin into therapeutic regimens may enhance treatment efficacy and prevent the emergence of resistance. The increasing availability of liquid biopsy technologies enables real‐time monitoring of circulating lncRNAs, presenting an opportunity for early detection of resistance markers such as MALAT1 and allowing for timely therapeutic interventions [ 21 22 Our study highlights the promising role of NanoCurcumin in resensitizing tamoxifen‐resistant breast cancer by modulating epigenetic regulators such as MALAT1 [ 47 52 10 18 Furthermore, emerging parallels between hormone‐driven tumors such as breast cancer and meningioma highlight a shared oncogenic reliance on PI3K/AKT signaling, lncRNA regulation, and hormonal receptor crosstalk [ 58 60 59 58 60 37 40 42 4.5. Study Limitations and Considerations for Translation Despite the promising findings presented, several limitations should be noted to contextualize the scope and generalizability of our results. First, the clinical sample was small ( n μ 13 16 54 55 5. Conclusion: A Step Toward Personalized Cancer Therapies In conclusion, our study underscores the critical role of MALAT1 in tamoxifen resistance and provides strong evidence that NanoCurcumin can serve as an effective modulator of MALAT1 expression, potentially reversing or preventing endocrine therapy resistance in ER+ breast cancer. The findings from our clinical, bioinformatics, and in vitro studies collectively highlight a compelling rationale for integrating NanoCurcumin into therapeutic strategies targeting lncRNAs. As research advances, the development of lncRNA‐directed therapies, combined with molecular diagnostics, may usher in a new era of precision medicine aimed at overcoming drug resistance and improving outcomes for breast cancer patients.
