Methods A total of 13,733 female patients were included in this cross-sectional study, utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2018. Various subtypes of UI were the primary endpoint. Overweight was defined as 25 kg/m 2 2 2 Results 47.53% presented with low-LCD score, and 52.47% had high-LCD score. The association between overweight or obese and an increased risk of SUI in both the low-LCD and high-LCD groups. Compared to the low-LCD group, the correlation between BMI and SUI was reduced in high-LCD group. Obese was related to a higher risk of UUI in female with low/high-LCD score. Women with high-LCD score exhibited a diminished correlation between obese and UUI risk, in contrast to their counterparts with low-LCD score. Similarly, higher risk of MUI can be found in overweight and obese female with low LCD score. In the high LCD group, obese was significantly associated with an increased risk of MUI. When the LCD score increased, there was a corresponding decrease in the impact of obese on MUI risk. Any subtype of UI risk was higher among women who were overweight or obese, regardless of their low or high LCD score. As the LCD score increased, the impact of overweight/obese on the any subtypes of UI risk decreased. Conclusion High-LCD score may attenuate the impact of overweight or obese on the SUI, UUI, MUI and any UI. Adopting LCD pattern may have the potential to mitigate the risk of overweight and obese-related UI.

Methods Data sources and study population For this cross-sectional study, all data are from the NHANES database 2007–2018. NHANES data is a representative sample of the non-institutionalized population of USA and designed with multistage probability sampling [ 16 Inclusion criteria: female participants aged ≥ 18 years from NHANES 2005–2018 (n = 18,797). Exclusion criteria: (1) with incomplete information about the UI (n = 1,919) and body mass index (BMI) (n = 120); (2) pregnant participants (n = 307); (3) with extreme energy intake (< 500 or > 5000 kcal/day for women) (n = 2,442); (4) with a history of bladder cancer, cervical cancer, uterine cancer, and brain cancer (n = 276). Finally, 13,733 eligible females were included for further analysis (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Flow diagram of our study cohort Data collection Outcome- assessment of urinary incontinence The primary endpoint encompassed the occurrence of various subtypes of UI, namely SUI, UUI, MUI and any UI. UI of NHANES participants was assessed by the questions in Questionnaire Data on “Kidney Condition” [ 17 Assessmentof overweight, obesity, and LCD Anthropometric parameters were measured at the Mobile Examination Center by trained interviewers, following standardized protocols [ 18 2 2 2 2 19 LCD was determined by conducting analyzing of the levels of fat, protein, and carbohydrate [ 20 20 22 Possiblecovariates Possible covariates included in our study: age (years), race, education, marital status, smoking status, drinking status, physical activity, number of vaginal deliveries, menopause status, hysterectomy, hypertension, diabetes, depression, cardiovascular disease (CVD), moisture (g), caffeine (mg), oral sex hormones, and drug for overactive bladder. Participants were classified as having hypertension if they were self-reported physician diagnosis, or were prescribed antihypertensive medication, or exhibited a systolic blood pressure level ≥ 140 mmHg, or demonstrated a diastolic blood pressure level ≥ 90 mmHg. Participants were categorized as having diabetes if they were self-reported physician diagnosis, or were taking medication for hypoglycemic drugs, or fasting glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, or glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%. Drug for overactive bladder includes oxybutynin, tolterodine, fesoterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, trospium, and mirabegron. Statistical analysis Data were presented as weighted mean ± standard error (SE) for continuous variables, and the number of cases and composition ratio [n (%)] for categorical variables. For the missing variables, the mean matching prediction method was employed to impute them, and sensitivity analysis was conducted on the dataset before and after interpolation (Supplementary Table 1 2 P P Results Participant characteristics Our study involved a sample of 13,733 female participants with an average age (SE) of 48.56 (0.28) years. Of the study subjects, 47.53% presented with an LCD score < 9.53, and 52.47% had an LCD score ≥ 9.53.

The results showed that women who were overweight/obesity had higher likelihood of experiencing UI compared to those with normal/underweight. Furthermore, as the LCD score increased, the impact of overweight on the SUI or UUI may decrease; high-LCD score may also attenuate the impact of obesity on the SUI, UUI, MUI and any UI. Subgroup analyses showed the similar results. The present study demonstrates that LCD exerts a regulatory effect on the relationship between overweight/obesity, and UI in women. The prevalence of UI increases with age and has a significant impact on quality of life, particularly among women [ 1 23 7 24 7 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 12 The current study has several strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to investigate the impact of a low-carbohydrate diet on the susceptibility to overweight and obesity-related UI among women, while also examining various subtypes of UI. The statistical analyses incorporated sampling design and weighting techniques to represent the general adults in the United States. However, several limitations must be acknowledged. Firstly, this study was a cross-sectional design, the causality between LCD, overweight/obesity and UI could not be determined. Second, the dietary data, UI, and certain covariates were based on self-reported information provided by the participants, which may lead to potential recall bias. The results should be interpreted with caution. Lastly, the NHANES database only provided data on the United States population, and the generalizability of our findings to other populations remains uncertain. It is imperative to conduct extensive prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials for further verify the impact of LCD on the risk of overweight and obese-related UI among women. Conclusion Our study revealed a significant association between overweight/obesity and UI in a large, nationally representative sample of women. High-LCD score may also attenuate the impact of overweight/obesity on the SUI, UUI, MUI and any UI. Adopting LCD pattern may have the potential to mitigate the risk of overweight and obesity-related UI. Future prospective studies are warranted to further validate our findings and explore the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.
