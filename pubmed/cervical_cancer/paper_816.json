Background Sarcopenia is a systemic disorder characterized by the progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function; however, its impact on the treatment outcomes of patients with esophageal cancer remains inconclusive. We aimed to evaluate the impact of sarcopenia and dynamic changes in skeletal muscle during treatment on neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (NICT) efficacy and prognosis in patients with locally advanced ESCC. Methods We retrospectively included 272 patients with locally advanced ESCC who received NICT. We calculated the skeletal muscle index (SMI) and its rate of change (ΔSMI%) from CT images at the L3 vertebral level obtained before and after treatment. Sarcopenia was defined as an SMI < 52.4 cm 2 2 2 2 Results The prevalence of sarcopenia increased from 50.9% before treatment to 55.1% at therapy completion.

We further identified independent risk factors for sarcopenia, anticipating that these findings will provide valuable insights for risk stratification and individualized treatment planning for patients with ESCC. Materials and methods Patients We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records of patients with esophageal cancer who received neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College between 2020 and 2024. The institutional ethics committee approved the study (File Number: 2025ER240-1), which was conducted in accordance with the 2013 Declaration of Helsinki; written informed consent was waived owing to its retrospective design. Inclusion criteria were: (i) age 18–80 years and a preoperative diagnosis of locally advanced, resectable ESCC staged at least cT3 or N+; (ii) receipt of at least two cycles of NICT at our institution, followed by minimally invasive McKeown esophagectomy. Exclusion criteria included: (i) prior antitumor treatments or distant metastases; (ii) palliative resection or exploratory surgery only; (iii) lack of abdominal CT images before or after treatment, or incomplete clinical records. Pathological staging was determined following the 8th edition of the Union for International Cancer Control/American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system. Figure 1 Figure 1 Flow chart of the study. Flowchart of patient selection for a study on esophageal cancer. Initially, 324 patients received neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (NICT). Fifteen with adenocarcinoma, four with small cell carcinoma, and four with mucoepidermoid carcinoma were excluded, leaving 301 patients. Further exclusions were made for absence of CT scans (24), palliative/exploratory esophagectomy (3), and incomplete medical records (2), resulting in 272 patients included in the study. These were categorized into three groups: only pre-NICT CT scan (20), CT scans before and after NICT (233), and only post-NICT CT scan (19). Assessment of skeletal muscle loss and definition of sarcopenia We quantified changes in patients’ skeletal muscle mass, using the Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI) and semi-automatically delineated regions of interest (ROIs) in muscle tissue, defined by Hounsfield unit thresholds of −29 to +150 HU, using the SliceOmatic software. We calculated SMI as the total cross-sectional area of all skeletal muscles at the L3 level on pre- and post-treatment abdominal CT scans (cm 2 2 21 2 2 2 2 Supplementary Figure 1 Neoadjuvant therapy regimens and surgery The NICT regimen comprised a platinum agent [80 mg/m 2 2 22 Endpoints The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). We used a Cox proportional hazards regression model to adjust for clinical covariates and evaluate their prognostic significance. OS was defined as the interval between surgery and death from any cause, while DFS was defined as the interval between surgery and first recurrence or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints comprised neoadjuvant treatment-related adverse events, treatment response rate, pathological complete response (pCR), and postoperative complication rate. We employed a multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent risk factors for sarcopenia before and after neoadjuvant therapy. Post-treatment responses were classified following the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD); CR, PR, and SD were collectively defined as disease control (DC). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were graded following the guidelines in version 5.0 of the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Statistical analysis Continuous variables that are normally distributed are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Non-normally distributed variables are expressed as median (interquartile range [IQR]). We compared continuous variables between groups using the Student’s t p p p Results Baseline characteristics We included 272 patients with ESCC treated with NICT followed by surgical resection, with imaging data available for 253 patients before neoadjuvant therapy and for 252 patients after treatment.

The results showed that excessive skeletal muscle loss during treatment was a negative prognostic factor, whereas sarcopenia diagnosed before or after neoadjuvant therapy was not. Furthermore, excessive muscle loss may help predict inferior treatment response and an increased incidence of hematologic toxicities. In our cohort, sarcopenia prevalence increased from 50.9% pre-treatment to 55.1% post-treatment, consistent with prior studies ( 15 17 13 14 19 20 23 24 19 20 23 23 p p 25 p p p 26 19 p The mechanisms by which sarcopenia influences ESCC progression and immunotherapy response remain unclear.

First, although this clinical study is the largest to date assessing sarcopenia’s impact in ICIs-treated ESCC and the first in which ΔSMI% = −2.8% was proposed as a prognostic cutoff, our findings are based on single-center data and require multicenter prospective validation. Therefore, we defined ΔSMI% < −2.8% as excessive muscle loss to underscore the clinical relevance of treatment-induced sarcopenia. Second, with a median follow-up of 20.4 months, short-term outcomes were addressed; nonetheless, long-term efficacy remains unclear. The lack of detailed documentation of nutritional support (e.g., ONS utilization rates, achievement of caloric targets) may confound interpretations of muscle wasting; future investigations should prospectively standardize nutritional interventions to mitigate such confounding. Finally, no universally accepted method or standard exists for diagnosing sarcopenia. We adopted the common approach of calculating SMI from L3-level CT images, consistent with prior research. Conclusion In summary, our findings show that in patients with locally advanced ESCC receiving ICIs, excessive skeletal muscle loss during treatment is associated with poorer short-term survival outcomes. Additionally, regarding therapeutic response and adverse effects, excessive skeletal muscle loss and sarcopenia could serve as predictive biomarkers for the efficacy and toxicity of ICIs. Furthermore, the pivotal role of multidisciplinary team (MDT) -including dietitians- in the perioperative multidisciplinary management of patients with ESCC, particularly in implementing standardized exercise interventions and nutritional support strategies, is highlighted in this study.
