This study aimed to assess the impact of EPA as a standalone supplement on body weight, body mass index (BMI), and muscle mass preservation in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) undergoing curative-intent treatment. Methods We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial between December 2015 and September 2018, enrolling 54 patients with advanced SCCHN. Participants received either 2.7 g/day of oral EPA or placebo, alongside standard nutritional support according to European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) guidelines. Assessments were performed at baseline (T0), post-induction chemotherapy (T1), and post-treatment (T2), including body composition, nutritional status, functionality, and inflammatory biomarkers. Plasma EPA (% of total fatty acids) was used as a biochemical marker of compliance. Results Both groups were balanced at baseline (median age 58.9 years; 46.3% malnourished). Neither the intention-to-treat nor per-protocol analyses showed statistically significant differences between groups in weight loss, BMI, or body composition ( p Conclusions Our study did not demonstrate a clear benefit of EPA supplementation on weight, BMI, or muscle preservation in patients with locally advanced SCCHN receiving curative-intent treatment. While EPA was safe and feasible, the findings do not provide sufficient evidence to support a clinically significant effect. Further research with larger sample sizes and more robust designs is warranted to better understand the potential role of EPA in this population.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been suggested to reduce inflammation in cancer patients [ 15 16 17 18 In HNC patients, most clinical trials have evaluated omega-3 fatty acids as components of commercial polymeric nutritional supplements [ 15 16 19 22 23 Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate whether EPA supplementation could have a positive effect on body weight, BMI and body composition in patients with locally advanced SCCHN undergoing a standardized curative-intent treatment protocol. Methods Study design and objectives This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial ( NCT02715596 Patients and oncological treatment Since cancer stage, treatment toxicity and response are closely related to progressive muscle and fat loss over time [ 24 25 The induction chemotherapy regimen (Fig. 1 26 2 27 2 2 28 29 Fig. 1 Oncological treatment plan Study products and compliance Patients were instructed to take one stick pack daily from the first day of chemotherapy and continuing throughout the entire treatment period (i.e. induction chemotherapy followed by CRT or RT plus cetuximab). Those in the intervention group received 2.7 g/day of EPA in liquid stick-pack format, while the placebo group received 2.7 g/day of mineral oil, matched in colour and odor to the EPA product. Given the poor compliance reported in previous studies [ 30 31 Compliance was assessed at each chemotherapy cycle by tracking the number of stick packs distributed, returned and the corresponding dates. In addition, plasma EPA levels were used as a biochemical marker of compliance. Total lipids were extracted from plasma samples, and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). Results were expressed as the proportion of EPA relative to total identified plasma fatty acids (relative percent). Assessments Body weight, BMI and body composition were assessed before starting the oncological treatment (T0), after the induction chemotherapy (T1) and two months following completion of RT (T2). BMI was also calculated as [(weight (kg)/height (m 2 All patients underwent an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan prior to treatment and again approximately two months completing RT (i.e. an overall span of 7–8 months), as part of routine clinical practice. The third lumbar vertebra (L3) on axial cross-section images was used as the reference point for analysis, following established methodology [ 32 34 2 2 2 2 34 36 2 2 Nutritional data included baseline height, percentage of weight loss in the 3 months prior to induction chemotherapy, current weight, nutritional status (Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment, PG-SGA) [ 37 38 Inflammatory markers were assessed through routine laboratory testing. Albumin and CRP were used to calculate the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) [ 39 40 Functional status was assessed via handgrip strength, using a hydraulic dynamometer (SI Instruments Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia). The test was performed on the dominant hand, with the patient seated, shoulder in adduction and neutral rotation, and elbow flexed at 90º, always using the same hand [ 41 Additional data were collected on nutrition impact symptoms and treatment-related toxicity, classified according to the National Cancer Institute – Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 [ 42 Sample size calculation To determine the sample size, we considered the objective of the study to evaluate the effect of EPA supplementation, comparing two groups: one supplemented and one control. The expected mean relative weight loss from baseline (T0) in the control group was −10% and −3% in the supplemented group. Assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 9, with a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, 54 patients were needed (27 per group) to find statistically significant differences between the two groups. Statistical analyses Descriptive statistics of baseline characteristics in the EPA and placebo participants were reported. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in weight and body composition from T0 and the absolute weight and body composition change from T0. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses as well as per-protocol (PP) analyses were conducted for outcomes of weight and body composition. Based on the ITT principle, all participants who were randomized were included in the analysis, regardless of protocol compliance. Per-protocol analysis compared intervention groups that included only those patients who completed the intervention. The percentage of change from baseline in weight and body composition outcomes were assessed using an analysis of covariance model (ANCOVA) adjusted for age, sex, malnutrition. Each ANCOVA model further comprised the baseline variable of the respective outcome at T0. The dynamics estimations in weight and body composition outcomes at each time point were obtained from linear mixed models (LMM) including intervention group and time as fixed factors, a group x time interaction term and a random intercept for subject. LMM were adjusted for age, sex and malnutrition, and each model further comprised the baseline variable of the respective outcome at T0. In the LMM models, p-values for the T2 vs T0 comparisons within groups were obtained using Tukey’s method for multiple post-hoc comparisons between time and group. All results will be reported as mean and 95% confidence interval (CI), adjusted for the previously mentioned covariates. In the ITT analysis, missing data due to noncompliance or dropout were imputed using the Reference-based multiple imputation method with the jump to reference 43 n 44 45 The validity of PP effect estimates required correct adjustment for confounding due to incomplete adherence to the assigned interventions [ 46 47 Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.4.2 with the RStudio 2024.04.0.

Nevertheless, a trend toward smaller decreases in the EPA group was observed across several measures (see Supporting Information Figure S1). PP analysis The per-protocol analysis included 33 patients who completed the intervention at T2: 16 in the EPA group and 17 in the placebo group. The mean percentage of weight loss was −10.5% (95% CI: −15.1% to −6.02%) in the EPA group and −10.4% (95% CI: −15.8% to 5.11%) in the placebo group (Fig. 3 2 When modeling weight dynamics over time, both groups showed significant weight loss. In the EPA group, the estimated mean change was –3.81 kg (95% CI: –5.70 to –1.91; p = 0.0009), compared to –7.72 kg (95% CI: –12.8 to –6.40; p < 0.001) in the placebo group. A similar trend was observed for BMI as shown in Fig. 4 2 2 2 SMI decreased in both groups, with a mean percentage loss of −8.3% (95% CI: −14.9% to −1.67%) in the EPA group and −9.2% (95% CI: −18.0% to −0.39%) in the placebo group (Fig. 3 2 2 2 2 No statistically significant differences were observed in the percentage change of adipose compartments (VATI, SATI, TATI) between groups (Supporting Information Table S1). Nevertheless, a trend toward smaller decreases in the EPA group was again observed across all compartments (Supporting Information Figure S1). EPA compliance At baseline, plasma EPA levels (expressed as % of total fatty acids) were similar between groups: 0.7% in the EPA group vs 0.5% in the placebo group. At T1 and T2, plasma EPA levels increased in the EPA group but remained stable in the placebo group. At T1, 10 patients (62.5%) in the EPA group showed increases in plasma EPA levels consistent with incorporation of the supplement, whereas no increased were observed in the placebo group. By the end of treatment (T2), approximately half of the patients in the EPA group maintained elevated EPA levels (Table 3 Table 3 Nutritional, functional, inflammatory and compliance parameters at T1 and T2 After induction chemotherapy (T1) End of radical treatment (T2) EPA ( n = 18) Placebo ( n = 21) EPA ( n = 16) Placebo ( n = 17) Malnutrition a , 9 (50.0) 10 (47.6) 14 (87.5) 14 (82.4) Energy intake, kcal/d 2401.1 (604.3) 2319.9 (494.6) 2222.8 (642.3) 2210.4 (770.6) Protein intake, g/d 101.2 (33.1) 86.1 (31.6) 96.0 (36.6) 96.8 (37.5) Enteral nutrition, n (%) 2 (7.4) 1 (3.7) 2 (11.8) 6 (35.3) Hand-grip strength, kg 27.8 (8.5) 33.0 (9.6) 25.5 (8.2) 31.4 (12.2) GPS b , 0 10 (58.8) 10 (50.0) 11 (68.8) 9 (56.2) 1 5 (29.4) 10 (50.0) 4 (25.0) 6 (37.5) 2 2 (11.8) 0 (0.0) 1 (6.2) 1 (6.2) IL-6 c 16.7 (23.8) 10.6 (7.9) 13.8 (15.2) 19.2 (24.5) NLR d 2.5 (1.6) 2.6 (2.2) 8.4 (14.6) 3.5 (1.6) EPA (% of total plasma fatty acids) 3.1 (2.3) 0.7 (0.5) 3.5 (3.1) 0.7 (0.4) * a b c d A total of 17 participants (31.5%) discontinued the intervention due to intolerance. Reported side effects included nausea, vomiting, heartburn, gastric fullness, and reflux, and were reported in both groups: 9 in the EPA group and 8 in the placebo group. Changes in nutritional, functional, inflammatory parameters over time The evolution of nutritional, functional, and inflammatory parameters after induction chemotherapy (T1) and at the end of treatment (T2) is presented Table 3 Nutritional status At baseline, 59.2% of patients in the EPA group were malnourished compared to 33.3% in the placebo group. By T1, malnutrition prevalence decreased in the EPA group and increased in the placebo group, resulting in similar rates (50.0% vs. 47.6%). This pattern remained consistent at T2. Dietary intake, including energy and protein consumption, showed no significant intra- or between-group differences at any time point. Nutritional support All participants received nutritional support in accordance with ESPEN guidelines. No significant differences were observed between groups regarding the need for different types of nutritional support at either T1 or T2. At baseline, two patients in the EPA group and one in the placebo group required enteral nutrition, and these same individuals remained on support at T1. By T2, six patients in the placebo group and two in the EPA group required enteral feeding. Functionality Hand-grip strength was preserved in both groups throughout the duration of the treatment, with no significant variations observed between the groups or over the course of the treatment. Inflammatory biomarkers There were no differences between groups regarding serum levels of proinflammatory biomarkers such as IL6, GPS and NLR. Toxicity No differences were observed in the incidence or severity of toxicities between the EPA and placebo groups. At baseline, nine patients reported dysphagia to liquids (five in the EPA group, four in the placebo group), including two cases classified as grade 3. Dysphagia to solids (grade 3–4) affected 20 patients, and 19 reported odynophagia across all severity grades. After induction chemotherapy, dysphagia persisted in two patients for liquids and in four for solids, with no cases exceeding grade 2 severity. Odynophagia remained in six patients, with one case classified as grade 3. Other nutrition impact symptoms emerged, including xerostomia (11 patients) and taste alterations (22 patients), all of mild to moderate severity (grade 1–2). Nausea and vomiting, likely related to EPA/placebo supplementation, were reported similarly in both groups. By the end of treatment, dysphagia to liquids was reported in five patients, and dysphagia to solids in seven, prompting enteral nutrition in two patients from the EPA group and six from the placebo group. Xerostomia became the most prevalent symptom (29 patients), followed by dysgeusia (27 patients) and fatigue (26 patients). Anorexia progressively worsened throughout treatment, with the most pronounced impact observed after treatment completion. Discussion This study did not demonstrate a clear benefit of EPA supplementation in attenuating weight loss, BMI decline, or muscle depletion in patients with locally advanced SCCHN undergoing curative-intent treatment. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses failed to show statistically significant effects. However, among those who completed the protocol, a modest trend toward reduced weight and muscle loss in the EPA group was observed, despite most not achieving optimal biochemical compliance. No significant differences were found in nutritional status, need for nutritional support, functionality, inflammatory biomarkers, or treatment-related toxicity. It is important to note that the study was not powered to detect differences in these secondary outcomes. EPA has been explored for its potential role in counteracting muscle protein degradation through inhibition of proteolytic pathways such as the ubiquitin–proteasome system [ 48 49 Previous meta-analyses have shown a positive association between omega-3 dose and body weight gain in cancer patients, but little effect on BMI or body composition [ 50 51 To explore whether a dose–response relationship existed in our cohort, we conducted a series of post hoc correlation analyses between plasma EPA levels and clinical outcomes. However, no significant associations were found, even among patients with higher biochemical compliance. Our findings contrast with a previous single-blind RCT in SCCHN patients that reported benefits in weight and lean mass using an EPA-enriched high-protein supplement [ 15 22 The potential of EPA to enhance chemotherapy sensitivity remains under investigation [ 52 53 Compared to previous trials, our study offers a homogeneous cohort of locally advanced SCCHN patients, all receiving a uniform treatment protocol. We also included a longer follow-up, capturing outcomes not only during treatment but also during the recovery phase, where post-treatment inflammation is known to persist. Most prior trials assessed EPA over 4 to 12 weeks, while our study spanned 6.5 months from baseline. Limitations include a small sample size and high dropout rate. Although we enrolled sufficient participants for baseline assessments, over one-third discontinued the intervention, largely due to intolerance. The liquid formulation, chosen to accommodate swallowing difficulties, may have hindered compliance due to taste or gastrointestinal side effects. Use of alternative formulations (e.g., capsules) might improve adherence in future studies. Moreover, lack of randomization stratification may have introduced imbalances between groups. In conclusion, this study did not find sufficient evidence that EPA supplementation significantly attenuates weight loss, BMI decline, or muscle loss in patients with locally advanced SCCHN undergoing curative-intent therapy. However, due to the limited sample size and adherence challenges, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Further research with larger, stratified cohorts and optimized delivery methods is warranted to better determine the clinical impact of EPA. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.
