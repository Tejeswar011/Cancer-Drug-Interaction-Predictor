Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) therapy specifically disrupts cellular processes necessary for cancer cell viability and tumor progression through the delivery of electric fields from a portable medical device. Patients with solid tumors such as glioblastoma experience significantly improved overall survival when receiving TTFields therapy concomitant with other standard-of-care therapies. TTFields therapy is also well tolerated and allows patients to maintain their quality of life. It is currently approved for the treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, pleural mesothelioma, and metastatic non–small cell lung cancer. Advanced practice providers (APPs), such as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, and other advanced oncology professionals, play key roles in the multidisciplinary team when implementing TTFields therapy. Advanced practice providers with prescribing authority can prescribe TTFields therapy after completing a one-time certification training. During the treatment decision-making process, APPs are poised to have in-depth conversations with patients and caregivers about TTFields therapy to help them grasp key concepts regarding efficacy and safety, how to properly use and integrate the device into their daily lives, cost of therapy, and how to get help using the various patient assistance programs. In addition, APPs play important roles in supporting optimal patient adherence and managing adverse events to ensure improved survival outcomes. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant central nervous system tumor in adults and is highly invasive ( Nabors et al., 2020 Ostrom et al., 2023 Ostrom et al., 2023 Nabors et al., 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN], 2024 NCCN, 2024 Rong, Li, & Zhang, 2022 Reardon et al., 2020 Jackson et al., 2019 Nduom et al., 2015 Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields; Optune Gio) are electric fields delivered noninvasively to the tumor site via a portable electric field generator and skin-placed arrays that disrupt cellular processes necessary for cancer cell viability and tumor progression ( Kirson et al., 2004 Mun et al., 2018 Novocure Inc, 2019b 2021 Voloshin et al., 2020a Novocure Inc, 2023d Novocure Inc, 2019b 2021 2024 Rivera et al., 2019 MECHANISM OF ACTION TTFields exerts physical forces on polar cellular components (e.g., tubulin and septin) to disrupt important cancer cell processes such as cell division and movement ( Mun et al., 2018 Voloshin et al., 2020a Figure 1 Karanam et al., 2017 Rominiyi et al., 2021 Giladi et al., 2015 Kirson et al., 2004 Mun et al., 2018 Voloshin et al., 2020a Karanam et al., 2017 Voloshin et al., 2020b Figure 1 Multi-mechanistic approach of TTFields therapy to disrupt processes necessary for cancer cells. TTFields disrupts microtubule spindle formation during mitosis, limits cancer cell motility by disrupting the microtubule network, downregulates DDR genes in cancer cells, and enhances antitumor immune responses.

JAMA Advanced practice providers are integral to communicating these long-term efficacy data to patients and caregivers. They are poised to have in-depth conversations with patients and caregivers and provide counsel during the decision-making processes to help determine if TTFields therapy is the right treatment for them. TTFields therapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor or docetaxel has demonstrated efficacy and safety in metastatic NSCLC following progression on or after platinum therapy ( Leal et al., 2023 Novocure Inc, 2024 Vergote et al., 2024 TTFields therapy daily usage is an independent predictor of outcomes. Post hoc analyses of EF-14 showed patients with the highest usage of TTFields therapy (usage levels > 90%) achieved the greatest median PFS and OS independent of other prognostic predictors ( Toms et al., 2019 Toms et al., 2019 Karanam et al., 2017 Mun et al., 2018 Murphy et al., 2016 ADVERSE EVENTS TTFields therapy is well tolerated from a QOL perspective ( Table 1 Novocure Inc, 2019b Mrugala et al., 2024 Table 1 Figure 3 Mrugala et al., 2024 Lacouture et al., 2020 Figure 3 Potential Tumor Treating Fields therapy-associated skin adverse events. (A) Pruritus, (B) hyperhidrosis, (C) contact dermatitis, (D) skin erosion, (E) pressure necrosis, (F) contact dermatitis and infection. Figure reprinted from Anadkat MJ et al. Front Oncol. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ If skin irritation occurs, APPs should encourage patients and caregivers to report these events immediately. Open lines of communication will aid in swift AE management and limit interruptions in therapy. This is not unique to TTFields therapy because other oncolytic therapies also require similar management ( ASCO, 2023 Table 2 Lacouture et al., 2020 Anadkat et al., 2023 Table 2 Dermatologic Adverse Event Management Reaction Symptoms Intervention Hyperhidrosis Excessive sweating Use aluminum chloride antiperspirant or topical glycopyrrolate when replacing arrays. Avoid ointments and medications that may cause sweating. Consider botulinum toxin injections. Pruritus Dry, itchy, flaky skin Use fragrance-free or anti-dandruff shampoo. Limit use of alcohol-based products. Use topical corticosteroids as necessary for inflammation and remove irritant. Contact dermatitis Contact: red, itching rash with papules, may resemble a burn, blisters, localized but more diffuse than irritant dermatitis Immediately remove irritant/allergen and array. Apply topical corticosteroid and/or a barrier film. Consider trimming adhesive if causing a reaction. Apply cold, moist compress for blistering. Consider systemic corticosteroids or treatment breaks for persistent reaction. Erosion/ulcer Erosion: epidermal breakdown, possibly with delineated moist/depressed lesion, mild bleeding, pain, or burning Remove array. Keep wound clean with dressing and treat with topical antibiotic. Consider wound culture. Consider oral antibiotic or treatment break for persistent reaction. Dermatitis and infections Inflammation of skin or hair follicle potentially with pus, itching, or burning Assess and treat with topical antibiotic. Use warm compresses with saltwater or Burow's solution. Consider wound culture and dermatology referral. Consider oral antibiotic or treatment break for persistent reaction. Note. Lacouture et al. (2020) Other rare AEs that may be related to TTFields therapy for glioblastoma include falls, headaches, and mild psychiatric symptoms (e.g., anxiety, insomnia, and confusion), all likely due to the need to carry, wear, and incorporate the device into daily life. Proper education and support from APPs can help improve integration of TTFields therapy into patients' daily lives ( Murphy et al., 2016 Kilias & Pellet, 2017 ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERATIONS Advanced practice providers play important roles in patient and caregiver device training. As previously mentioned, longer therapy usage is associated with prolonged median OS and 5-year survival ( Ballo et al., 2023 Toms et al., 2019 Advanced practice providers should counsel patients to keep up with their usual daily activities while wearing the TTFields device and remind patients to contact their Novocure device support specialists (DSSs) for access to extra power supplies, batteries, or arrays as needed to minimize disruptions ( Murphy et al., 2016 Novocure Inc, 2019b Batzianouli et al., 2023 Batzianouli et al., 2023 Novocure Inc, 2023c Novocure Inc, 2023a FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS An analysis from a US payer perspective found that adding TTFields therapy to temozolomide for glioblastoma was cost effective, with an estimated incremental 1.25 life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $197,336 per quality-adjusted life year gained ( Guzauskas et al., 2019 Chen et al., 2021 Barrington et al., 2022 Cherla et al., 2020 The actual cost of TTFields therapy to patients will vary depending on multiple factors, including insurance coverage and income. Through the MyNovocure patient support program, Novocure will advocate with insurance on behalf of patients ( Novocure Inc, 2023c IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ADVANCED PRACTICE PROVIDER Advanced practice providers, including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, and other advanced oncology professionals, play crucial roles within the wider multidisciplinary team encompassing MyNovocure team members, DSSs, caregivers, and other clinicians. In addition to helping manage their patients' disease and treatment, they can facilitate increased communication with patients and caregivers and present TTFields therapy to them using a patient- centered approach. Despite regulatory approval and proven efficacy across multiple tumor types, along with post-marketing safety data from > 25,000 treated patients ( Ceresoli et al., 2019 Leal et al., 2023 Mrugala et al., 2024 Novocure Inc, 2019a 2021 2024 Stupp et al., 2017 Advanced practice providers play an important role in increasing awareness of TTFields therapy, thereby facilitating its broader implementation in clinical practice. Advanced practice providers should provide consistent communication on treatment plans, survival benefits, administration considerations, AE monitoring and management, and optimal adherence. Ensuring that patients and caregivers understand these important TTFields therapy implications will help facilitate adherence and ultimately improve patient outcomes ( Mrugala et al., 2014 Frongillo et al., 2022 Novocure Inc, 2023b Advanced practice providers with prescribing authority who want to prescribe TTFields therapy are required to complete a one-time training course and certification process provided by Novocure ( Novocure Inc, 2023b CONCLUSIONS Survival rates for glioblastoma remain low despite recent advancements, and most available therapies are often associated with poor treatment tolerability ( NCCN, 2024 Ostrom et al., 2023 Kirson et al., 2004 Novocure Inc, 2019b Stupp et al., 2017 Acknowledgment Medical writing support was provided by Makaila Wallin, PharmD, from The Curry Rockefeller Group, LLC, a Citrus Health Group, Inc., company (Chicago, IL), and was funded by Novocure Inc.
