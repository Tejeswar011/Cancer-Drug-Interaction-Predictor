Prominent examples of such disorders encompass Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) impacting millions of people globally and causing significant financial and psychological hardships. Despite the existence of numerous approved medications for addressing NDDs, the majority merely alleviate associated symptoms and do not possess the ability to reverse the complications 1 2 , 3 4 , 5 6 7 2 2 8 Chemical species known as free radicals are defined by their reactive nature and the presence of an unpaired electron in their outer orbit. Simultaneously, they also exhibit the ability to exist independently. ROS are oxygenated molecules that are both free radical and non-free radical, such as hydroxyl radical (·OH), singlet oxygen (1/2 O 2 2 ·– 2 2 9 10 2 ·– 2 ·– 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 In summary, the emergence of AOX marks a significant breakthrough in therapeutic intervention, poised to revolutionize the landscape of neuroprotection by offering a formidable defence against metal and ROS-induced neurotoxicity. With its unparalleled ability to rejuvenate neurons, regulate metal homeostasis, and mitigate oxidative stress, AOX holds immense promise for preserving neuronal integrity and fostering sustained well-being in individuals afflicted by neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, AOX has shown promising results demonstrated by its encouraging outcomes in in vivo in vivo in vitro 2 Results and discussion 2.1 Design strategy, synthesis, and characterization of AOX Our design strategy is based on the metal chelation, antioxidant, and enhancement of neuronal outgrowth to recover the neurons from oxidative stress mediated neurodegenerative diseases ( Scheme 1 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 , 28 29 , 30 31 32 33 33 34 35 36 37 Scheme 1 2 Fig. S1 para 38 , 39 1 40 Fig. S1 3 3 3 1 13 Fig. S2–S11 Scheme 1 Design strategy and synthesis of AOX.

Assessing the impact of oxidative stress in the presence of a novel potent antioxidant influences mitochondrial morphology to provide an insight into the impact of cellular health. A hallmark of cells going through apoptosis is mitochondrial malfunction and results in altered mitochondrial morphology. It serves as an early biomarker to screen for an effective antioxidant showing neuroprotective therapies by reversing the altered mitochondrial morphology caused by the neurodegenerative processes. The DNA damage, cellular architecture, and altered mitochondrial morphology were analyzed by staining dPC12 cells after indicated treatments with Hoechst 33258/Phalloidin/Mitotracker CMX-ROS and were viewed under a fluorescent microscope (Supporting Information Fig. S25 Fig. 6 ψ m Fig. 6 2 2 2 2 Fig. 6 Figure 6 Effects of AOX in mitigating the mitochondrial ROS and maintaining the nito morphology in H 2 2 ψ m 2 2, 2 2 n P versus #### P versus 2 2 Figure 6 2.8 AOX attenuates oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway Nrf2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant genes, and ARE (antioxidant response element) is a DNA sequence that responds to Nrf2, promoting the transcription of protective antioxidant enzymes. Therefore, we further explored whether pre-treatment with AOX could promote the activation of the Nrf2/ARE signalling pathway, known for its critical cellular defence mechanism against oxidative damage, and block the activation of oxidative stress and apoptosis-mediated cell death in oxidant-treated dPC12 cells. The schematic representation of Nrf2/ARE pathway activation provides a visual overview of the molecular events involved and the influence of AOX in the cellular response to oxidative stress by activating Nrf2 nuclear translocation leading to the upregulation of phase-II antioxidant enzymes (NQO1, HO-1, GCLC, and GCLM) for promoting cellular resilience and redox homeostasis ( Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 β Fig. 7 Fig. S26 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 S26 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Fig. S27 Fig. 7 2 2 2 2 Figure 7 Determining the mechanism of action of AOX in alleviating the ROS through Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.

At 0.5, 1, 4, 8, and 24 h post-administration, the concentrations of AOX in the liver, kidney, heart, brain, and lungs were measured. The liver exhibited the highest concentration of AOX, indicative of significant hepatic uptake and metabolism, followed by the lungs and kidneys, which showed moderate levels, suggesting pulmonary distribution and renal elimination ( Fig. S28D and S28E Following successful validation of the antioxidant small molecule for BBB crossing and serum stability, an in vivo Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Figure 8 Effect of AOX in tBCCAO/R rat model of stroke.

The histological brain sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE) of the cortex and striatum region were studied as the stroke area was confirmed through TTC stain. On microscopic examination, we can see the thinness and weak staining of the neuropil with more vacuolization. The emergence of larger, shrunken neurons with pyknosis in their nuclei and eosin-stained cytolymph that was clearly visible was prominent in the infarction area, while AOX reduced the number of pyknotic neurons as well as the area of necrosis ( Fig. 9 Fig. 9 Fig. 9 Figure 9 Representative images of Haematoxylin and eosin-stained cells in (A) Cortex and (B) Striatum. Wistar rats were subjected to sham operation in one group, in the tBCCAO/R group rats were subjected to 20 min of ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion with the administration of vehicle (saline) and in tBCCAO/R + AOX group AOX (0.5 mg/kg) was injected at the end of ischemia and the start of reperfusion. AOX treatment at the time of reperfusion reduces brain damage after 24 h of tBCCAO ischemic/reperfusion in animals and improves the number of surviving neurons compared to the tBCCAO/R group.

At specified time intervals (0, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h), 100 μL of the incubated solution was withdrawn and diluted with an equal volume of acetonitrile. Subsequently, the diluted solutions were subjected to analysis using RP-HPLC for purity determination. Graphical representation of the obtained data was performed using GraphPad Prism software. 4.13 Serum stability of AOX AOX was incubated with 50% human serum to keep the final concentration of 150 μmol/L of AOX at 37 °C. 100 μL incubated solution was taken out and diluted with 100 μL of acetonitrile to complete the precipitate of serum proteins at different time intervals (0, 1, 6, 12, and 24 h). Then the solution mixture was kept at 4 °C to stop the protease activities for 20 min. Next, mixtures were taken out and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The filtrate solution was then taken and analyzed by RP-HPLC purity measurement. The graph was plotted with the help of a GraphPad Prism. 4.14 Half-life of AOX Half-life of AOX was determined according to the previously reported protocol with some modifications 64 , 65 (1) K elim = ( ln ⁡ ( C peak ) − ln ⁡ ( C trough ) T interval ) (1) t 1 / 2 = ( 0.693 K elim ) 4.15 Tissue distribution Tissue distribution of AOX was determined according to the previously reported protocol with some modifications 66 via 4.16 DPPH assay A stock solution of DPPH (100 μmol/L) was prepared in methanol and 500 μL was added to all the tubes followed by 500 μL of AOX at various concentrations (100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.562, 0.78, 0.39, 0.19, and 0). Therefore, the final concentration of DPPH becomes 50 μmol/L for each assay and the concentration of AOX becomes 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125, 1.562, 0.78,0.39, 0.19, and 0 μmol/L, respectively.

Briefly, PC12 cells were seeded in 6 well plates and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 2 2 g g 4.25 Detection of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) One of the most used methods for measuring intracellular ROS is the 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate Assay (DCFH-DA). A stock solution of 10 mmol/L DCFDA was prepared in DMSO and a working concentration of 10 μmol/L was freshly prepared in colorless DMEM culture media and used for the assay. Briefly, dPC12 cells were pre-treated with or without various concentrations of (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.312, 0.156, and 0.078 μmol/L) AOX and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 2 2 4.26 Flow cytometry analysis Cells were seeded in 6-well culture plates and incubated overnight followed by differentiation for further 5 days. Then the dPC12 cells were pre-treated with novel small molecule followed by a 2 h oxidant treatment(H 2 2 4.27 Measurement of cellular oxidative stress in live cells (CellROX) To measure the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in live cells a fluorogenic probe CellROX Deep Red Reagent (Invitrogen, C10422 4.28 Measurement of mitochondrial superoxide ROS (MitoSOX) Mitochondrial ROS was detected using a fluorescent probe MitoSOX Red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (Invitrogen, M36008 4.29 Mitochondrial morphology analysis The combined use of Hoechst, Phalloidin, and Mitotracker CMXROS staining provides a comprehensive view of unlocking the cell dynamics.

The dPC12 cells were collected, washed, and lysed with ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer and a 1% (2:1) protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail. The total protein isolated was quantified using Bradford assay. Equal amounts of protein samples (40 μg) were separated on a 10% and 12% SDS/PAGE gel and transferred electrophoretically onto a PVDF membrane. Subsequently, the PVDF membrane was blocked with 5% BSA for 2 h and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed thrice with 1 × TBST buffer and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at RT. Proteins were visualized by exposure in a BIO-RAD ChemiDoc using immobilon forte western HRP substrate. The band density was quantified by Image Lab 6.1 software. 4.32 Immunocytochemistry PC12 cells were cultured on 35 mm glass-bottom confocal dishes and differentiated as described before. dPC12 cells were pre-treated with AOX followed by oxidant as indicated. After the treatment, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 2 h at 37 °C, washed thrice with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 containing 2% BSA prepared in PBS for 30 min. Cells were given a single PBS wash and incubated with primary antibody (as per the dilution mentioned on the data sheet of the antibody) prepared in PBS and incubated at 4 °C for overnight. The next day, cells were washed thrice with PBS and incubated with FITC/TRITC/Cy3.5 conjugated secondary antibodies and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by nuclear staining using Hoechst 33258 for 10 min. Cells were washed and visualized using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX83). 4.33 RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcriptase- PCR (RT-qPCR) dPC12 cells were treated with/without AOX and were used for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from treated PC12 derived neurons using PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Cat. No. 12183018A, Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA concentration and purity ( A 260 A 280 Table 1 −ΔΔCt 4.34 Animal housing and care Adult male Wistar rats (weighing 280–320 g) were used for the experiments and procured from Jai Narai Vyas University (JNVU), Jodhpur animal house facility. Animals were housed in polypropylene cages having aspen shavings bedding (NEPCO) and had free access to filtered water and food pellet s ad libitum 4.35 Experimental animals Male Wistar rats, weighing 280–320 g, were randomly divided into three groups: Sham group (sham operation without tBCCAO surgery, n n n 4.36 Transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (tBCCAO) model Male Wistar rats were deeply anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) at a constant dose volume of 1 mL/kg body weight. After the toe pinch test for unconsciousness, they were fixed with adhesive tapes in the supine position on a heating pad (37 °C) for controlling the body temperature, and the mouth was inserted in the mask for constant oxygen supply. The neck of the animal was raised with the help of cotton bedding to facilitate visualization of the artery for occlusion. The neck area was shaved and disinfected with 70% alcohol. The right and left common carotid arteries were exposed through a midline incision on the neck. The common carotid arteries were occluded with mini-vascular clamps with a closing force of 150× g 4.37 Neurological deficit scoring After 24 h of reperfusion, all the animals were assessed for neurological deficits, according to the modified Neurological Severity Score (mNSS) 69 4.38 Cerebral infarct volume assessment After 24 h of reperfusion, 3 rats from each group were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the brains were harvested. The brain was then rinsed in PBS to remove excess blood and then was immersed in PBS and kept in a −20 freezer for 3 min to facilitate slicing of the brain. The brain was placed in the brain matrix and then five coronal sections of 2 mm thickness were sliced using a fine razor blade. The slices were collected in a Petri plate containing 0.05% TTC prepared in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C followed by fixation in 10% buffered formalin. Brain slices were photographed with a camera along with a ruler and analyzed by ImageJ analysis software. The % infarction size was calculated as Eq. (12) (12) Infarction % = Brain slice area − Total infarct area Cortex + Straitum × 100 4.39 Cardiac perfusion-fixation and tissue processing Adult male Wistar rats were anesthetized after 24 h of reperfusion after tBCCAO surgery with intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) at a constant dose volume of 1 mL/kg body weight using a 1 mL calibrated syringe and then were perfused transcardially with PBS and simultaneously fixed with 10% buffered formalin. After perfusion-fixation, the brain was dissected out and post-fixed in the same fixative for another 24 h. Then each brain was processed for paraffin blocking by dehydration in increasing gradation of alcohol dilution, clearing in xylene and finally infiltration with paraffin solution followed by embedding in paraffin blocks. After the blocks were prepared, 5 μm thick coronal sections were obtained with a rotatory microtome (Thermo Scientific HM 325) and collected on poly- d 4.40 Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis Standard hematoxylin–eosin staining was performed. Tissue slides were deparaffinized and incubated for 8 min in Mayer's hematoxylin solution and washed in warm water for 10 min sections were dipped in 95% ethanol and counterstained with eosin for 30 s. The slides were then dipped in xylene and mounted in DPX and visualized by Dewinter microscope. For immunohistochemical analysis slides with brain sections were dried at 37 °C for 30 min for better adherence of the sections to avoid washing out. Paraffin was removed from the slides by dipping the slides in xylene, followed by rehydration in a gradation of decreasing alcohol dilution. Antigen retrieval was performed by using the microwave method as instructed for the antibody by the manufacturer. Briefly, for anti-S100 β β (13) (13) CTCF = Integrated density – ( Area of selected cell × Mean fluorescence of background readings ) 4.41 SHOLL and fractal analysis To quantify the ramification of microglia of the cortex and striatum region, Sholl and fractal analysis was performed using a plugin for ImageJ software Sholl analysis and FracLac 70 4.42 Statistical analysis All of the results that were presented as the mean accompanied by the standard deviation (SD) were representative of at least three or four separate experiments. When comparing the mean values of more than two different groups, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed, on the data using Prism software (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., Version 8.0.2). A statistic was considered statistically significant if it had a P Author contributions Juhee khan: Writing – review & editing, Writing – original draft, Visualization, Validation, Software, Resources, Project administration, Methodology, Investigation, Formal analysis, Data curation, Conceptualization.
