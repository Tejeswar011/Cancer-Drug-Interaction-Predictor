Tumor mutational burden (TMB), which reflects the number of somatic mutations in a tumor, has been proposed as one such marker. In this study, we analyzed tumor samples from 61 patients with cervical cancer using next-generation sequencing. High TMB was found in over half of the cases and was associated with specific clinical features such as nodal involvement, diabetes, and infection with HPV52. However, TMB did not correlate with disease stage or the most common HPV types. Our results suggest that TMB may help refine patient selection for immunotherapy in cervical cancer but further research is warranted.

Introduction Cervical cancer remains a major global health issue, primarily driven by persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Tumor mutational burden (TMB), which quantifies the total number of somatic mutations per megabase of tumor DNA, has emerged as a potential biomarker in various cancers [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 The role of TMB as a biomarker in cervical cancer is still under investigation [ 16 17 18 15 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population This retrospective study included 61 consecutive female patients (mean age 55.1 ± 14.0 years) diagnosed and treated at the Clinical Department of Oncological Gynecology at the Bydgoszcz Oncology Center between 2014 and 2021 who consented to and underwent tumor tissue genomic profiling by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Informed consent was obtained from each participant, and the study was approved by the Institutional Bioethics Committee (approval no. [KB265/2012]). 2.2. Sample Collection and DNA Isolation Tumor specimens were obtained through various clinical procedures including diagnostic biopsies, surgical resections (hysterectomy or trachelectomy), conization, or endocervical curettage, depending on clinical indications and disease stage. Only formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor blocks with a tumor cell content between 5% and 90% were accepted for downstream analysis. While quality control filters were used, we did not perform purity-based normalization. DNA was extracted from 5–10 μm tissue sections using standard protocols optimized for FFPE material. The extracted DNA was quantified using the Quantifluor ® 2.3. NGS Library Preparation and Sequencing Two targeted NGS panels were used for library construction: ONCOaccuPanel™ (NGeneBio, Seoul, Republic of Korea), a comprehensive 344-gene panel covering key oncogenic pathways including cell cycle regulation, DNA damage repair, and PI3K signaling, and BRCAaccuTest PLUS™ (NGeneBio, Seoul, Republic of Korea), a BRCA1/2-focused panel included to assess HRD-related genes, as part of exploratory analysis. Library preparation was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions using hybrid capture enrichment. Paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) was conducted on either the MiniSeq or NextSeq 550 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), depending on batch size and sample availability. 2.4. Bioinformatic Processing and Variant Annotation Primary sequence data (FASTQ) were processed using NGeneAnalySys ® 19 ® 20 21 Microsatellite instability (MSI) in NGS is assessed using multiple conditions: (i) a total number of SNV/INDEL mutations across all genes of >30, an INDEL Index of >20%, and additional considerations, including the presence of AMC MSI marker, detection of pathogenic MMR gene mutations, evaluation of tumor purity, filtering of germline variants, false positives/negatives, and POLE pathogenic variants. 2.5. Statistical and Comparative Genomic Analyses The comparative mutational analysis between ca. planoepitheliale and adenocarcinoma subtypes was visualized using oncoplots generated via custom scripts in R (maftools v2.10.0). To evaluate co-mutation patterns and mutual exclusivity, a somatic interactions plot was used to depict the conditional probability of observing pathogenic variants in one gene given mutations in another. Genes with pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants (as per ACMG guidelines) were included in this matrix. To investigate potential clinical correlates of TMB status, patients were stratified into TMB-high and TMB-low groups. Continuous variables were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test, and categorical variables were assessed via the chi-squared or Fisher’s exact test. A univariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of high TMB status, including histological type, tumor grade, and mutational signatures. All statistical tests were two-tailed and considered significant at p 3. Results 3.1. Baseline Characteristics and Treatment Modalities Table 1 Figure 1 Surgical treatment was performed in 52 patients (85.2%), including radical hysterectomy or trachelectomy. Postoperative complications included two in-hospital deaths (3.3%), one case requiring nephrostomy, and three temporary or permanent colostomies. Adjuvant therapies were commonly administered: 52 patients (85.2%) underwent brachytherapy, and 50 (82.7%) received external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), often in combination with surgery. Chemotherapy was administered in 27 cases (44.3%), 20 of which (74.0%) were administered concurrently with surgery ( Figure 1 3.2. Genomic Landscape and Somatic Mutations NGS analysis identified a diverse spectrum of somatic alterations. There was no marked difference in the mutation classes between ca. planoepitheliale and adenocarcinoma in the analyzed subset: missense mutations accounted for 74% vs. 79%, frame shift deletions for 13% and 10%, nonsense mutations for 5.5% and 3.7%, and frame shift insertions for 4% and 2.9%, respectively ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Single-base substitution (SBS) analysis revealed a predominance of A>G and T>C transitions (A>G 30% vs. 37% and T>C 31% vs. 32% for ca. planoepitheliale and adenocarcinoma, respectively), which are typical of DNA aging and APOBEC enzyme activity, particularly in the context of viral infections such as HPV ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Somatic interaction analysis ( Figure 3 p Figure 3 3.3. Tumor Mutational Burden and Microsatellite Instability High TMB, defined as ≥10 mutations/Mb, was detected in 36 patients (59.0%), while microsatellite instability (MSI-high) was found in only 2 patients (3.3%). Our observed MSI rate (3.3%) is consistent with TCGA data (<5%) and reflects HPV-driven rather than mismatch repair-driven tumorigenesis. The TMB distribution was not significantly different between the ca. planoepitheliale and adenocarcinoma types (high TMB: 12% vs. 22%, respectively; p p p Figure 1 Patients with nodal involvement had a significantly higher mean TMB (+13 mutations/Mb). TMB was also elevated in patients with HPV52 infection (+25 mutations/Mb), Type 2 diabetes mellitus (+10), HPV68 positivity (+5.8), or grade G3 (+3.6 vs. G2). In contrast, hypertension was associated with a decreased TMB (−5.5 mutations/Mb). The results of the univariable analysis of TMB and clinical features are available in Figure 4 Clinically, patients are now followed for a median of 6 years [IQR; 5–7], with an overall survival (OS) rate of 95.2% and progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 90.5%, without differences between high and low TMB ( Appendix A Figure A1 3.4. Homologous Recombination Deficiency HRD, defined as LOH ≥ 16, was identified in 34 cases (55.7%) overall, with 25 occurring in the TMB-high group and 9 in TMB-low ( Figure 5 p The top five most frequent somatic variants included recurrent non-coding and coding alterations ( Figure 5 NG_012113.2 NG_011536.1 Figure 5 4. Discussion The management of advanced cervical cancer (FIGO IIB and higher) remains particularly challenging due to the limited systemic options and frequent resistance to conventional therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed oncology by enhancing T-cell-mediated anti-tumor responses, and their application in cervical cancer has led to regulatory approval of pembrolizumab for PD-L1-positive advanced cases, based on results from KEYNOTE-158 [ 5 22 4.1. Tumor Mutational Burden and Its Clinical Relevance Tumor mutational burden (TMB), reflecting the number of somatic mutations per megabase (mut/Mb), is a genomic biomarker associated with neoantigen load and potential immunogenicity [ 10 23 15 24 10 25 11 26 21 23 23 25 27 28 However, it remains unclear whether high TMB alone predicts responsiveness to immunotherapy in cervical cancer. While a high TMB could theoretically enhance neoantigen presentation, not all patients with TMB-high tumors respond favorably to checkpoint inhibitors [ 29 4.2. TMB and HRD: Disconnected Genomic Features We investigated the relationship between TMB and HRD in our cohort, defining HRD positivity by a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) score ≥ 16. HRD was present in 14.8% of patients, with no significant difference in its distribution between the TMB-high and TMB-low groups ( p 15 27 29 While HRD and pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations are established predictive biomarkers for PARP inhibitor sensitivity in cancers such as ovarian and breast, their role in cervical cancer remains under investigation [ 6 30 31 Among the most common somatic loci identified in our analysis (top fifth percentile), only one non-coding variant—chr22:g.29695793:A>C, near CHEK2—was enriched in HRD-positive cases. Other mutations of interest, such as PIK3CA (E545K, NG_012113.2 NG_011536.1 4.3. Clinical and Molecular Heterogeneity The clinical phenotype of TMB-high tumors in our cohort included increased prevalence of nodal metastasis and association with rare HPV types, particularly HPV52 and HPV68. This is in line with previous studies in the literature reporting diverse oncogenic potential among HPV genotypes, which may influence genomic instability and immune recognition [ 32 In contrast, patients with metabolic comorbidities such as hypertension exhibited lower TMB values. This inverse association has not been widely reported and arises from univariable analysis only, but systemic inflammation and immunosenescence in comorbid states may modulate tumor evolution and mutagenesis [ 33 34 The most frequent genetic alterations identified herein included PIK3CA, KRAS, PTEN, and TP53 mutations, which are recurrently observed in cervical tumors and other gynecologic cancers [ 35 4.4. Future Directions and Unanswered Questions Despite promising results, our findings highlight the complexity of integrating TMB into clinical decision-making. While TMB is an FDA-approved biomarker for ICI therapy in advanced cervical cancer, its potential role as a selection tool for adjuvant or neoadjuvant immunotherapy following surgery remains speculative. Further randomized trials are needed to assess whether adjuvant immunotherapy can improve outcomes in TMB-high patients after surgical resection. For the time being, MSI remains the only currently validated marker. Moreover, our study underscores the importance of contextualizing TMB with other biomarkers. For example, the interplay among TMB, PD-L1, MSI, HRD, and TILs could form the basis for comprehensive immuno-genomic profiling to stratify patients for treatment [ 36 37 Advances in NGS technology, including whole-exome and panel-based sequencing, allow for rapid and cost-effective TMB assessment. However, standardization of assays and interpretation frameworks is necessary to ensure reproducibility and cross-study comparison [ 15 5. Conclusions TMB represents a promising yet complex biomarker in cervical cancer. While we observed clinical and genomic patterns associated with high TMB, we did not identify significant correlations with HRD. As cervical cancer therapy continues to evolve toward precision medicine, integrated genomic profiling—including TMB, HRD, and immune biomarkers—will be essential for optimizing treatment strategies.
