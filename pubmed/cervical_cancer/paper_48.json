This research aims to explore the role of Serpina3c, which is highly expressed in adipocytes, in obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia and metaflammation. Serpina3c global knockout (KO) mice, adipocyte-specific Serpina3c overexpressing mice, Serpina3c knockdown (KD) mice, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (Hif1α) KD mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks to generate obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia mice models. In the present study, Serpina3c KO mice and adipocyte-specific Serpina3c KD mice exhibited more severe obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia and metaflammation under HFD conditions. Serpina3c KO epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) primary stromal vascular fraction (SVF)-derived adipocytes exhibited higher lipid (triglyceride and non-esterified fatty acid) levels and higher fatty acid synthase expression after palmitic acid (PA) stimulation. Adipocyte-specific Serpina3c overexpression in KO mice prevented the KO group phenotype.

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers used for the Serpina3c gene are presented in ( Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Figure S1 All procedures were conducted according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals and were approved by the Care of Experimental Animals Committee of Southeast University. Mouse model of obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia The mice were housed under standard conditions at 22 ± 1°C and a humidity level of 50%-60% with a 12-hour light–dark cycle at the Animal Center of Southeast University. All animals were provided free access to water and free access to either normal food (Normal diet, ND) (XTCON50J, XieTong) or an HFD (XTHF60, XieTong). Eight-week-old male mice were fed an HFD for 16 weeks to produce obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia mice [ 22 23 Generation of AAV serotype 8 (AAV8)-mediated adipocyte-specific Serpina3c-overexpressing, Serpina3c knockdown, and Hif1α knockdown mouse models The adipocyte-specific Serpina3c-overexpressing (OV) mouse model and adipocyte-specific Hif1α knockdown (KD) model were generated by the subcutaneous injection of Serpina3c gene-overexpressing plasmids or Hif1α KD plasmids with the adiponectin promoter coated by AAV8 viral particles (AAV8-Adipoq-Serpina3c/AAV8-Adipoq-shHif1α) into the inguinal WAT (iWAT) of 12-week-old Serpina3c KO male mouse background (10 12 12 24 25 AAV8-Adipoq-shSerpina3c viral particles (or AAV8-Adipoq-NC particles) were subcutaneously injected into the iWAT of 12-week-old wild-type (WT) mice (Genechem Co., Ltd, Shanghai) to generate adipocyte-specific Serpina3c KD mice [ 24 25 Body composition and food intake analysis The body composition of 24-week-old mice was determined using a 7.0 T micro-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) instrument (PharmaScan, Bruker, Germany). Food intake was monitored weekly over 24 weeks, and the average daily food intake was calculated. Blood collection and serum metabolite measurements After mice were fasted overnight and then anesthetized using 1.5% isoflurane, blood samples were collected through the posterior orbital venous plexus. Serum TG [A110-1-1, Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (NJBI)], total cholesterol (TC) (A111-1-1, NJBI), NEFA (A042-2-1, NJBI), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (A112-1-1, NJBI), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (A113-1-1, NJBI), lactic acid (LD, A019-2-1, NJBI), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (C009-2-1, NJBI), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (C010-2-1, NJBI) levels were measured using appropriate kits in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The serum levels of insulin were determined using an ELISA kit (E-EL-M1382, Elabscience, Wuhan). Tissue metabolite measurements Mice fed an HFD for 16 weeks were euthanized at the age of 24 weeks by cervical dislocation after anesthetization with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (1%, 50 mg/kg) [ 26 Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence Tissues (iWAT, eWAT, BAT, heart, liver, and muscle) were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for H&E staining, immunohistochemistry, or immunofluorescence. The inflamed adipocytes were identified by the detection of Mac2-positive CLSs within eWAT. Related antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table S2 Oil Red O staining OCT-embedded frozen sections (heart, liver, and muscle) were washed once in 60% isopropanol and then stained with Oil Red O solution. Confluent 3T3-L1 adipocytes or primary adipocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then stained with Oil Red O solution at room temperature. Seahorse analysis A Seahorse XF Glycolysis Stress Test Kit (Agilent Technologies) was used to measure the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Briefly, 2 × 10 4 Primary stromal vascular fraction-derived adipocyte production, differentiation, and treatment eWAT was isolated from WT and Serpina3c KO male mice at 6 weeks and digested with collagenase II (2 mg/mL, Worthington, USA) for 30–60 min at 37 °C, and then filtered and centrifuged. The SVF was then suspended in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM). White adipogenesis induction was performed on SVF using a complete DMEM culture medium containing 0.5 mmol/L isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), 1 µmol/L dexamethasone, and 10 μg/mL insulin for 2 days, and then culture medium with 10 µg/mL insulin for 2 days. Finally, the cells were cultured in complete DMEM culture medium for 4 days [ 27 Bone marrow-derived macrophage production and differentiation Mouse bone marrow (BM) was flushed from the tibias and femurs of C57BL/6 male mice (6-8 weeks old). BM suspensions were then filtered. After removing red blood cells (RBCs) by sterile lysis, the samples were washed and centrifuged and then re-suspended with a complete DMEM medium supplemented with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (20 ng/mL). Molecular docking and co-immunoprecipitation assays Molecular docking was performed with the help of a specialized molecular modeling service company (PRIMARY BIOTECH, China). At least 1 mg of total protein lysate from each sample was used for the immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments. All samples were incubated with 2 µg primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The next day, 5 µL of Protein A agarose and 5 µL of Protein G agarose were added to each sample, and the samples were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were then washed three times, and bound protein was eluted with IP buffer for subsequent immunoblotting. RNA sequencing Total RNA was extracted from PA-treated Serpina3c knockdown 3T3-L1 adipocytes, PA-treated Serpina3c overexpression 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and PA-treated corresponding control 3T3-L1 adipocytes. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was subsequently performed following sample testing, library construction, and library quality control (Applied Protein Technology Co., Ltd., China). Bioinformatic analyses were performed using the OmicShare tools, a free online platform for data analysis ( https://www.omicshare.com/tools Untargeted metabolomics Metabolomics was performed on adipose samples from mice fed an HFD for ten weeks. All analyses were performed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). An Orbitrap Exploris 120 mass spectrometer was used for first and second level mass spectrometry data acquisition under the control software (Xcalibur, version 4.4, Thermo) (BIOTREE, Shanghai). Small interfering RNAs transfection Nuclear factor erythroid two-related factor 2 (Nrf2) small interfering RNA (siRNA), Hif1α siRNA, and control RNA were commercially generated (Genepharm, China). The sequences of these RNAs are listed in Supplementary Table S1 Plasmid transfection procedure Plasmid transfection was performed when a cell confluence of 60-80% was reached and was validated according to the manufacturer’s instructions (AD600075, Zetalife, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was isolated from tissues and cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). cDNA synthesis was performed on the isolated RNA using HiScript III RT SuperMix (R323, Vazyme, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The expression levels of genes of interest were then quantified by qRT-PCR (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad) using an SYBR Green qPCR kit (Q711, Vazyme). The sequences of all primers used are available in Supplementary Table S1 Western blotting The adipose tissues and cells were homogenized in lysis buffer, and concentrations were detected using a BCA protein assay kit (BL521A, Biosharp, Chongqing). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 4–20% Bis-Tris protein gel. The separated protein samples were then transferred to PVDF membranes for Western analyses. All antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table S2 1 Patient enrollment In total, 78 patients from a coronary artery disease (CAD) cohort screened within the Department of Cardiology, Zhongda Hospital, between March 2019 and December 2020, were included. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongda Hospital affiliated with Southeast University (2018ZDSYLL134-P01). Inclusion criteria: (1) male or non-pregnant female aged 18–85, (2) willing to sign written informed consent. Exclusion criteria: (1) acute myocardial infarction (AMI), (2) previous coronary artery bypass grafting history, (3) acute ischemic stroke or bleeding, (4) severe liver or kidney diseases, (5) uncontrolled severe hypertension, (6) severe dyspnea, (7) recent surgery history, (8) suffering from other severe diseases and having a life expectancy less than a year, and (9) any other circumstances deemed unsuitable for participation in the study by the researchers. All patients were divided into three groups based on their calculated body mass index (BMI): BMI < 24 ( n n n Supplementary Table S3 1 Blood samples were collected using EDTA tubes. Then the samples were centrifuged promptly at 3000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4℃ to collect the upper plasma. The kallistatin levels in patient plasma samples were measured using ELISA kits (E-EL-H5550, Elabscience). Statistical analyses In the process of data analysis, we utilized three software tools: SPSS 26.0, GraphPad Prism 9.5.0, and MedCalc 15.0. For continuous data, the results were presented as mean ± standard deviation. When the data simultaneously satisfied the assumptions of normal distribution and homogeneity of variance, we employed the unpaired t-test to compare differences between the two groups. For comparisons involving more than two groups, we applied one-way ANOVA, coupled with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or the Student–Newman–Keuls test to assess statistical significance. In cases where the data only met the assumption of normal distribution but not homogeneity of variance, we utilized the unpaired t-test with Welch’s correction for comparisons between two groups and Welch’s ANOVA test for comparisons among multiple groups. For data that did not adhere to a normal distribution, we opted for the Mann–Whitney test for comparisons between two groups and the Kruskal–Wallis test for comparisons involving multiple groups. For categorical variables, we conducted comparisons using the chi-squared test.

( A P B r P C r P D https://BioRender.com/q58d916 P P Discussion Obesity-induced adipose dysfunction is often accompanied by hyperlipidemia [ 28 29 30 in vivo in vitro First, we found a high expression of Serpina3c in WAT, which could be down-regulated by HFD feeding. Importantly, Serpina3c was highly expressed in adipocytes, but not in undifferentiated SVF preadipocytes and macrophages, suggesting its regulatory role in adipocyte function. Our research revealed that Serpina3c deficiency in adipocytes exacerbated adipocyte dysfunction and obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia after 16 weeks of HFD feeding. We have shown that Serpina3c, which is abundantly expressed in adipocytes, exerts a crucial role in lowering blood lipids and mitigating inflammation by modulating adipocyte function, as evidenced by our findings using AAV8-mediated adipocyte-specific conditional knockout, which led to improved hyperlipidemia and metabolic inflammation. During the development of obesity, the vascular oxygen supply cannot keep up with the expansion of adipose tissue [ 31 32 33–36 in vivo in vitro 37 38 39 40 Additionally, we observed that Serpina3c deficiency led to an increase in Nrf2 localization to the nucleus. NRF2 has been reported to bind to the HIF1α promoter, transcriptionally regulating HIF1α mRNA levels [ 41 42 43 20 21 44 45 46 Metaflammation is known to be related to dyslipidemia and obesity [ 47 48 49 in vitro 50 51 However, there are still some limitations in our study. First, we were unable to obtain human adipose tissue samples for validation. Second, we have not yet developed a drug delivery strategy that can specifically target kallistatin/Serpina3c within adipocytes, with the aim of providing new options for translational research in obesity treatment. Conclusion In conclusion, Serpina3c regulates adipocyte function to improve hypertriglyceridemia and macrophage inflammation via the Hif1α/glycolysis pathway. Serpina3c is a promising target for the treatment of obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia and metaflammation. Clinical perspectives Obesity-induced adipose dysfunction is often accompanied by hyperlipidemia and metaflammation. Targeting adipose tissue metabolic function is an effective strategy for the future clinical prevention and management of hypertriglyceridemia. Serpina3c inhibits the Hif1α-glycolysis pathway and reduces de novo lipogenesis and lactic acid secretion in adipocytes by binding to Nrf2, ultimately ameliorating obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, and metaflammation induced by HFD. Serpina3c knockout aggravates these phenotypes in HFD mice. The plasma expression levels of kallistatin (the human homolog of Serpina3c) are decreased in obese patients and are negatively related to triglyceride and lactic acid content in human plasma. Serpina3c/kallistatin is a promising target for the treatment of obesity-related hypertriglyceridemia and metaflammation.
