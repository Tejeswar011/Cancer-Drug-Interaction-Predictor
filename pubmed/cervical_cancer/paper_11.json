Current evidence demonstrates that while HSV and VZV may reactivate in immunocompromised cancer patients, there is no causative relationship between these two viruses and oncogenesis. It is necessary to make a distinction between cancer-inducing viruses and reactivated viruses due to immune suppression among cancer patients.

The manuscript presents an interesting view on the dual role of viruses in the biology of cancer stem cell (CSC). It explains the mechanism through which oncogenic viruses such as human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) promote tumor initiation and development by the induction of CSC-like properties. These viruses have oncoproteins that disrupt cellular homeostasis by immortalizing the cell and tumor growth. Furthermore, the potential of oncolytic viruses (OVs) to selectively infect and kill CSCs and non-CSCs is promising for the treatment of cancer. By review of the contradictory roles of viruses in tumorigenesis and as a strategy for cancer therapy, the article offers the possibility of utilizing viral mechanisms for therapeutic advantage [ 1 The article mentions that “The major oncoviruses are Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, mastadenovirus, aviadenovirus, rhadinovirus, varicellovirus, polyomavirus, adenoviruses, orthopoxvirus, leporipoxvirus, parvovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HPV, human herpesvirus 8, and simplex virus which induce uncontrolled cell growth by a common way of interfering with the tumor p53 gene”. However, the inclusion of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and varicellovirus (Varicella-Zoster Virus, VZV) as oncoviruses needs clarification. HSV and VZV are not classified as tumor viruses or oncoviruses. Oncoviruses are defined as viruses that directly induce cancer by inserting their oncogenes into host cells, driving oncogenic transformation. Recent studies indicate that although HSV infections are common among immunosuppressed cancer patients, no conclusive evidence exists for a direct involvement of HSV in cancer induction [ 2 3 4 5 2 Similarly, the VZV, which is responsible for causing herpes zoster (HZ), reactivates mostly in immunocompromised individuals, i.e., cancer patients or those who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Reactivation rates of VZV reach as high as 63% in certain populations with cancer [ 6 7 Importantly, within the herpesvirus family, only EBV, KSHV, and more recently Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) are supported by evidence as oncogenic viruses. Notably, cutting-edge research indicates that some high-risk HCMV strains possess malignant transforming potential and may contribute to tumor progression by reprogramming the tumor microenvironment and influencing CSC biology in the central nervous system [ 8 In conclusion, the article’s claim of HSV and VZV as oncoviruses is unsupported by reliable sources and may mislead readers.
