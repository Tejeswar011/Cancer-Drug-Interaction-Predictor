This clinical condition can be particularly challenging to manage in premenopausal women seeking pregnancy and eligible for conservative treatment. There is limited literature concerning the reliability of hysteroscopic sampling methods and the potential underestimation of endometrial cancer rates in women diagnosed with atypical endometrial hyperplasia before surgery. Even less is known about the effectiveness of hysteroscopic endometrial sampling according to premenopausal and postmenopausal status, considering confounding factors related to endometrial pathology on this topic. The present study aimed to fill this knowledge gap and revealed that resectoscopic endometrial biopsy has the lowest rate of underestimating endometrial cancer in premenopausal women.

Introduction Atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) is a challenging condition for clinicians. This diagnosis may include concurrent endometrial cancer (EC) in up to 40% of cases [ 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 Additionally, EC includes a diagnostic workup, including specific imaging, which is not mandatory for AEH (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging) [ 9 In AEH, the type of endometrial sampling can affect the correct preoperative diagnosis. In the past, endometrial biopsies were performed with blind sampling, which proved unreliable, sampling on average only half the endometrial cavity and therefore often missing focal lesions [ 10 11 7 12 The two primary endoscopic methods for endometrial sampling are hysteroscopically guided biopsy (HSC-bio) and hysteroscopic endometrial resection (HSC-res). Currently, the most widely used is HSC-bio [ 7 13 14 15 16 13 14 The present study aimed primarily to assess the underestimation rate of EC in AEH, using different hysteroscopic sampling methods (HSC-bio vs. HSC-res), including a comparison of confounding variables. Secondly, the focus was on potential differences in procedure performance between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, as treatment options may vary in clinical practice. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Setting This multi-institutional retrospective study involved thirteen oncology referral centers in Italy. Women diagnosed with AEH after undergoing either office hysteroscopy (HSC-bio) or resectoscopic endometrial biopsy (HSC-res) received definitive surgical treatment within forty days of the first diagnosis, with hysterectomy being the oncological reference standard. The histological assessment of AEH was based on the WHO 2014 classification and includes a dichotomous categorization: atypical and non-atypical endometrial hyperplasia [ 17 18 19 19 2.2. Study Groups and Variables The sample of women included in the study was divided into two groups: those undergoing HSC-bio and those undergoing HSC-res, which represented the dependent variable. The main indications for performing hysteroscopic examinations in the study participants were abnormal uterine bleeding or endometrial abnormalities identified via ultrasound. Women who underwent HSC-res did so primarily due to the failure of the office hysteroscopy or inadequate tissue sampling during the HSC-bio procedure or due to the presence of contraindications to performing the diagnostic assessment in an outpatient setting. The following independent variables were considered: age, pre- or postmenopausal status, parity, smoking status, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities (including diabetes, hypertension, or both), presence of Lynch syndrome, history of breast cancer, use of tamoxifen, use of hormone therapy, abnormal uterine bleeding, and ultimately EC stage based on the EC classification system [ 9 2.3. Procedure Details All office hysteroscopies (HSC-bio) were performed in an outpatient setting without anesthesia and under vaginoscopy, utilizing a 5 mm continuous-flow sheath with a 30° viewing angle, and using saline solution as a distension medium. Endometrial sampling was performed using 5 French semi-rigid forceps inserted through the working channel of the hysteroscope (Bettocchi Hysteroscope, Karl Storz ® In contrast, resectoscopic endometrial biopsies (HSC-res) were conducted in a hospital setting. The procedure was performed in the operating room under general anesthesia, employing a 9 mm continuous-flow sheath with a 12° viewing angle. Initially, the cervical canal was dilated to 9.5 mm, and then the instrument was introduced, and a bipolar operating loop of 26 French was used for biopsy sampling of the endometrium only, and saline solution was used as as a distension medium (Karl Storz ® 2.4. Sample Size Calculation The sample size calculation was performed to compare two proportions based on the primary outcome: the rate of concurrent EC in women with AEH, utilizing two different endometrial sampling methods: HSC-bio and HSC-res. According to the existing literature on this subject [ 13 14 19 20 2.5. Statistical Analysis Continuous independent variables were assessed for distribution using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Variables that did not exhibit a normal distribution were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U test and were presented as medians along with interquartile ranges. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-squared test and reported as counts and percentages. Significant differences identified in univariate analyses were further examined in a multivariate logistic regression model, which was used to identify variables significantly associated with the endometrial sampling methods employed. In multivariate analysis, we included explanatory variables that showed a p 21 The MedCalc Statistical Software was used to perform statistical analyses [MedCalc ® https://www.medcalc.org p 3. Results The present study included 536 women with a preoperative diagnosis of AEH who subsequently underwent definitive treatment. Of these, 383 underwent HSC-bio and 153 HSC-res. Figure 1 The characteristics of the patients are presented in Table 1 Univariate analysis comparing the independent variables revealed significant differences between the two groups in terms of age and pre- and postmenopausal status (see Table 2 p Table 2 To evaluate a possible association of missed ECs with the two hysteroscopic procedures analyzed and adjusted for confounding variables as described in the methods, a multivariate analysis was performed in which the dependent variable was categorized as follows: EC = 1, No-EC = 0 ( Table 3 Table 3 Interestingly, when analyzing premenopausal and postmenopausal women separately, a significant difference was observed in the rate of underestimation of EC among premenopausal women. Specifically, in this group, the rate of cancer events for those in the HSC-res group was 14%, compared to 28.8% for women in the HSC-bio group ( p Table 4 Table 4 Tables S1 and S2 The analysis of the final stage of EC cases revealed no significant differences between the two endoscopic procedures ( Table 5 Table 5 Table 5 Table 6 Table 6 4. Discussion The present study demonstrated that there was no significant difference between HSC-res and HSC-bio about the rate of EC underestimation in the entire cohort of women with AHE. Interestingly, the secondary objective of the study showed a significantly lower rate of EC in premenopausal women with AEH undergoing HSC-res compared to HSC-bio. The diagnosis of AEH raises concerns about the possible concurrent presence of endometrial cancer. Our observed rate of approximately 30% is slightly lower than recent data from a systematic review and meta-analysis [ 22 10 11 4 5 7 23 Currently, an endometrial biopsy in these cases should be performed under hysteroscopic guidance [ 7 13 14 24 14 13 13 14 Based on our analysis, the majority of EC cases were categorized as low-risk. It has been established that both AEH and low-risk EC can be managed conservatively [ 7 12 25 26 Moreover, our results indicate that 5.6% of premenopausal women with concurrent EC had intermediate- or high-risk tumors, and most of them were in the group undergoing HSC-bio. This information raises questions about the appropriate management of this population. Overall, our sample included 161 premenopausal patients. Of these, approximately 21% were under 45, which nowadays represents a life period to desire pregnancy. Additionally, it is worth noting that the average age of childbirth has significantly increased over the years, with many women giving birth even after 45 [ 27 28 However, in this scenario, it is essential to clarify the acceptability, safety, and risk of complications associated with endometrial resection in women seeking pregnancy. In this context, it is crucial to emphasize that a diagnostic resectoscopic endometrial biopsy does not impact fertility [ 6 29 30 31 32 30 33 Conversely, it is unclear why HSC-res does not perform as well in postmenopausal women compared to the outpatient HSC-bio method. One possible explanation is that postmenopausal women have less tissue available for sampling, regardless of the technique used. As a result, the difference in the amount of tissue obtained by the two methods may be less pronounced than in premenopausal women, partly explaining the slight difference in reliability. It is important to emphasize that further investigations are required to clarify this unclear difference. Another aspect worth noting is that HSC-res requires anesthesia and hospitalization and often involves longer waiting times compared to HSC-bio. Thus, each option should include a careful assessment of costs, risks, and benefits. In this context, outpatient procedures may be adopted that utilize miniaturized hysteroscopes with operating loops. Although these tools may not be available in all clinical divisions, they should be implemented because they can facilitate more tissue sampling without the need for anesthesia, allowing for immediate execution in an outpatient environment [ 34 The present study has several limitations: (i) its retrospective nature; (ii) outpatient and inpatient procedures have not been standardized a priori; (iii) it is unknown whether only selected areas were biopsied or whether and when random biopsies were also performed; (iv) the total amount of tissue sampled may differ (e.g., in pre- or postmenopausal women); (v) based on the study design (including only women with a pre-operative diagnosis of AEH), the exact diagnostic accuracy of the two hysteroscopic methods could not be provided. Strengths include the large sample analyzed, which consists of only hysteroscopic biopsies. The focus on pre- or postmenopausal status is novel in this field. Furthermore, the histological reference standard representative of the final endometrial lesion should be emphasized, given that the final diagnosis was made on hysterectomy specimens. 5. Conclusions Overall, the primary objective of the present study showed no significant difference between HSC-res and HSC-bio in the rate of EC underestimation in women with AEH. However, the significant findings in premenopausal women are particularly engaging, as this population may undergo conservative treatment: in premenopausal women wishing to conceive, HSC-res may be indicated to provide a more reliable histological reference standard. This data needs to be confirmed by a prospective study. To compare further endometrial sampling methods, miniaturized hysteroscopes with operating loops could be added to office sampling methods.
