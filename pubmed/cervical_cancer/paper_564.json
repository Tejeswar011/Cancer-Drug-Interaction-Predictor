This review critically examines emerging strategies to overcome key barriers in viral vaccine design and deployment. We focus on four major areas: (1) structure-guided antigen engineering to stabilize conformations; (2) the mRNA platform and its delivery system; (3) advanced adjuvant systems that enhance cellular and humoral immunity; and (4) approaches to mitigate immune imprinting and antigenic variability, such as chimeric antigens and glycan shielding. We also explore anti-idiotypic vaccination strategies and the limitations of current animal models in predicting human immune responses. In addition, to address vaccine hesitancy and inequitable access, we advocate for global collaboration in manufacturing, distribution, and public education to ensure inclusive immunization strategies. By integrating molecular insights with platform technologies, we aim to inform the rational design of future vaccines with improved efficacy and public acceptance. novel vaccine infectious viral disease delivery system adjuvant imprinting immunization USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture 2024-67012-42721 This work was supported by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative Competitive Grant No. 2024-67012-42721 from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture for F.Y. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Vaccines have saved millions of lives throughout history. In general, there are two types of vaccines: live and non-live. A live vaccine can be derived from passaging a virulent strain to become less virulent while maintaining its antigenicity, or from a genetically modified strain using reverse genetics to abolish virulent factors. Both forms will replicate sufficiently in a host to activate strong protective immunity without causing symptomatic disease. Many commercial vaccines against important diseases are live, such as the oral polio vaccine, MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine, and Rotavirus vaccine [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 There are many effective vaccines in history. Recent vaccine development highlights diverse platforms and antigen designs for infectious viral diseases ( Table 1 7 8 9 10 11 12 In this review, we focus on innovative strategies and the mRNA platform to address key challenges in vaccine development for infectious viral diseases. These strategies are based on advancements in novel delivery systems for mRNA vaccines, protein structure determination, novel adjuvants, and anti-idiotypic strategies. Multiple novel strategies are also discussed to overcome immune imprinting for broad protection. We also provide perspectives on developing protective vaccines by combining multiple effective approaches and emphasize the importance of global collaboration to combat viral diseases for human health. 2. Structure-Guided Antigen Design The advancement of X-ray crystallography, Cryo-EM, computational biology, and technologies for neutralizing antibody isolation and mapping of antigenic sites has enabled structure-guided vaccine antigen design, focusing on protein engineering for desired, stabilized conformations [ 35 36 Introduction of proline or disulfide bonds. Two proline substitutions (2P) at the apex of the central helix and heptad repeat I can efficiently stabilize spike proteins of MERS-CoV, human coronavirus, SARS coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 in the prefusion conformation [ 12 The inactivated RSV vaccine and postfusion F protein-based subunit vaccine elicit non- or poorly neutralizing antibody responses, resulting in minimal efficacy [ 37 38 In the case of HIV, gp120 binds to cell receptors, followed by structural changes allowing gp41 to refold and fuse with the cell membrane [ 39 40 Cavity filling. 41 42 Electrostatic and hydrogen bond substitutions. 43 Structure-guided vaccine antigen design based on the preliminary findings of MERS-CoV and HCoV spike proteins enabled the rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines [ 12 3. mRNA Technology and Its Future mRNA vaccines represent a rapidly advancing platform with unique advantages over traditional approaches, including the ability to generate proteins with native conformations that induce both antibody and T cell responses. Their success depends on safe and effective delivery systems, most notably lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which protect mRNA and enhance cellular uptake. Three major formats—non-replicating linear mRNA, self-amplifying RNA (saRNA), and circular RNA (circRNA)—are under clinical investigation, each offering distinct benefits and challenges in stability, translation efficiency, and safety. Ongoing innovations focus on reducing unwanted immune activation, improving RNA purity, and achieving targeted delivery to specific tissues or immune cells. These advances are shaping the future of mRNA vaccines, broadening their potential beyond COVID-19 to diverse infectious diseases and therapeutic applications. Unique advantages and classification of the mRNA platform. 44 45 There are three forms of RNA that have entered clinical studies: traditional non-replicating linear RNA, saRNA, and circRNA ( Figure 1 46 47 44 mRNA can be recognized by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), mainly Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and stimulate inflammatory cytokine production. This immune-activating capacity of mRNA can be overcome by replacing uridine with pseudouridine or its derivatives during the mRNA synthesis process in vitro [ 48 49 Delivery systems for mRNA vaccines. 50 Figure 1 Table 2 51 52 53 54 55 mRNA vaccines are mostly administered intramuscularly, where lipid nanoparticles are taken up by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells, through multiple entry mechanisms, such as micropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and caveolae-mediated endocytosis [ 56 57 58 vaccines-13-00979-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Features of key mRNA delivery systems.

Safety profiles of mRNA vaccines. 61 62 63 64 65 66 Proinflammatory cytokines triggered by mRNA vaccines or adjuvants of other types of vaccines could help recruit APCs to the inflammation site and promote B and T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation into effector cells. However, an excess of inflammatory cytokines causes a cytokine storm, which manifests as fever, fatigue, etc. mRNA vaccines have faced the challenge of their highly inflammatory nature. The introduction of modified nucleosides (pseudouridine, N1-methylpseudouridine, or other nucleoside analogues) dramatically sequesters the recognition of mRNA by host immune PRRs, such as TLR2, TLR7, TLR8, and RIG-I [ 48 49 Targeted delivery of mRNA into a specific tissue or organ. 67 68 69 70 71 72 The second strategy for targeting is through LNP optimizations. Different lipids exhibit distinct features. Through an ionizable lipid library screening, the iso-A11B5C1 lipid was found to selectively bind to muscle cells while showing low potency in off-target organs like the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes [ 73 74 75 In all, mRNA vaccines offer unique advantages by inducing both antibody and T cell responses, supported by lipid nanoparticle delivery systems that enhance stability and uptake. Three formats—linear mRNA, self-amplifying RNA, and circular RNA—are being explored, each with distinct strengths and limitations. Ongoing innovations aim to reduce inflammation, improve RNA stability, and enable targeted delivery, broadening mRNA vaccines’ potential beyond COVID-19. 4. Novel Adjuvant Development As indispensable components of vaccines, adjuvants play an essential role in enhancing adaptive immunity and allowing lower antigen doses for increased magnitude and durability. Both immunostimulants (or danger signal molecules or PAMPs) and delivery systems can serve as adjuvants. Immunostimulants (e.g., TLR agonists) activate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of host cells to produce co-stimulatory cytokines, which help adaptive immune cell maturation and differentiation. Delivery systems (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) prolong antigen bioavailability inside cells, enhance APC presentation, and boost adaptive immunity. Classical adjuvants can be classified into four categories: aluminum adjuvants, emulsion adjuvants, TLR agonists, and particulate adjuvant systems [ 76 77 Aluminum and emulsion adjuvants. 78 79 80 81 82 Novel Toll-like receptor (TLR)-based adjuvants. 83 84 85 86 87 88 77 Particulate adjuvant. 89 cGAS-STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase—stimulator of interferon genes) pathway activators. 90 91 92 Overall, TLR agonists remain the most popular vaccine adjuvants in preclinical and clinical trials. Incorporating multiple PRR agonists into oil-in-water emulsions may potentially enhance vaccine efficacy. The development of different vaccine types, such as routes of immunization, desired immune responses, types of pathogens, and disease stages, may require selecting the right adjuvant with desired features. Importantly, novel adjuvant development needs to combine with different delivery systems with distinct physicochemical properties for optimal vaccine efficacy. 5. Universal Vaccines to Overcome Imprinting Frequent antigenic mutations of the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, driven by constant selective pressure, pose significant challenges in developing universal vaccines. We have seen from COVID-19 vaccinations that boosting with a heterologous spike protein did not induce broader neutralizing antibodies against the variant; instead, the produced antibodies mostly targeted the parental strain of SARS-CoV-2 [ 93 94 95 96 7 Figure 2 7 97 98 93 94 99 Targeting the conserved region. 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 Engineering the host immune system. − − + + 111 112 113 114 115 Targeted delivery. 116 + + 117 118 119 120 120 121 122 Developing universal vaccines for inducing broadly neutralizing antibody responses remains the focus of vaccine research. The aforementioned novel strategies to engineer antigens or the host immune system, coupled with emerging delivery systems, have the potential to overcome pre-existing immunities or immune imprints to address critical infectious viral diseases for human health. 6. Anti-Idiotypic Vaccination Strategies The concept that immunoglobulins themselves can serve as an immunogen to combat infectious diseases has also garnered interest. The F(ab) component of the immunoglobulin represents the “antigen binding fragment” of the antibody and comprises a variable light (VL) and variable heavy (VH) chain proximal to a constant light (CL) and constant heavy (CH) component ( Figure 3 2 2 idiotype Figure 3 anti-idiotypic anti-anti-idiotypic It has been postulated that such anti-idiotypic antibodies may serve as a mechanism to control levels of select immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies by neutralizing the Ig induced by their respective cytokine networks [ 123 124 125 126 127 125 128 129 The application of anti-idiotypic and anti-anti-idiotypic antibody responses as a means to modulate infectious diseases has also been described. Keay et al. [ 130 131 132 133 Furthermore, anti-idiotypic antibody generation has demonstrated promising results in other animal models of infectious bacterial disease. In some of those studies, anti-idiotypic antibody vaccination was more effective than the actual antigen in inducing bactericidal antibody responses [ 134 135 136 Variations in anti-idiotypic antibody preparations may also affect their effectiveness. It is possible that “whole antibody molecule” anti-idiotypic vaccination approaches may introduce differential outcomes because of the Fc (fragment crystallizable) component influence. Each Fc component of the Ig classes has a unique binding potential with its cognate Fc receptor (FcR), which is present on different cell types. For IgG-FcγRI, FcγRIIA/B and FcγRIIIA/B are expressed on human B cells, neutrophils, eosinophil monocytes, macrophages, masts, and dendritic cells [ 137 138 139 140 Figure 3 In contrast, it could be that the “whole antibody molecule” (Fc inclusive) anti-idiotypic vaccination approach may be advantageous since it may provide additional immunomodulatory anti-idiotypic responses. To this end, commercial intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) preparations have been shown to contain multiple anti-idiotypic antibodies, such as anti-factor VIII antibodies, anti-DNA autoantibodies, anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin (Tg) autoantibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-microsomal antibodies, anti-neuroblastoma antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, anti-platelet antibodies, anti-Sm idiotypes (ID-434), and anti-GM1 antibodies. Further, IVIG has been used increasingly as an immunomodulatory agent in the treatment of autoimmune and systemic inflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis and polymyositis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, and anti-phospholipid syndrome, and these beneficial clinical effects may be in part moderated by the by virtue of their whole Ig molecule anti-idiotypic neutralizing potential [ 141 142 Additional concerns regarding anti-idiotypic vaccination strategies with respect to clinical feasibility, safety, and scalability are warranted. Regarding clinical feasibility, the strengths of such an immunization approach include (1) target flexibility, where antibodies can be designed against complex antigens, including haptens, poorly immunogenic molecules, or non-protein targets; (2) precision:, in which anti-idiotypic antibody maturation offers a highly specific mimicry of the original antigen, potentially enhancing immune targeting, and (3) versatility, where, in addition to anti-viral anti-idiotypic vaccination, this approach can be applied to other infectious diseases, cancers, and autoimmune conditions. However, anti-idiotypic vaccination maturation is not without challenges, including the (1) identification of functional Ab2. It is possible that only a subset of Ab2 molecules would act as true “internal image” mimics. Screening and validation would be required and can be labor-intensive. (2) The regulatory pathway involves fewer precedents existing compared to conventional vaccines, so regulatory approval may require extensive safety and efficacy studies. Clinical and preclinical applications of anti-idiotypic vaccination efficacy include trials related to malignancy in cancer. Studies by Lode et al. [ 143 2 2 144 145 134 135 136 Regarding scalability, molecular biological modifications of anti-idiotypic antibodies, also known as nanobodies—which are the single domain antibody derived from the variable region of heavy chain antibody—may serve as a novel approach to maturing anti-idiotypic vaccines [ 146 146 147 148 149 134 Thus, anti-idiotypic vaccination strategies represent a unique antigen-obviating approach to immunize healthy individuals against infectious and other diseases and provide alternatives to conventional vaccines. 7. New Animal Models for Vaccine Testing Before clinical trials of a vaccine in humans, the vaccine’s safety, dose selection, immunogenicity, and efficacy need to be demonstrated using proper animal models that mimic the pathological disease of interest. Although obtaining an ideal animal model for human vaccine evaluation is challenging, it should be economical, readily obtainable, and well-recapitulate the human immune response and disease features. Existing models for COVID-19. 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 Limitations of animal models. 159 160 161 162 Future directions. 163 8. Global Collaboration and Education Low vaccine accessibility and the anti-vaccine movement are partially due to low compliance. For example, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the acceptance rate for the vaccine ranged from 56% to 75%, which is insufficient to reach the herd immunity threshold of 80% or higher [ 164 165 166 167 168 Needle-free technology can be classified into two types of delivery modes: mucosal surface and skin. For mucosal immunization, multiple strategies have been developed to overcome the mucosal barrier for vaccine delivery to specialized microfold (M) cells. The oral polio vaccine, developed decades ago, sets the standard for ease of administration, and these types of vaccines are generally live attenuated viruses with tissue tropism for mucosal areas [ 169 170 171 172 75 86 The other delivery mode for needle-free technology is through the skin, which typically contains a rich network of immune cells, particularly Langerhans cells as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Jet injectors are needle-free instruments that inject vaccines transcutaneously or subcutaneously through a minute orifice under high pressure [ 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 To reduce sociopolitical barriers to vaccination, the scientific community needs to provide more education to the general public and political figures about the existing knowledge and importance of vaccines. Being transparent with the non-scientific community is important, as vaccine effectiveness can be affected by multiple factors, such as age, immune status, adherence to schedule, and the disease itself [ 181 182 9. Conclusions Developing next-generation vaccines that are safe, efficacious, cost-effective, and easily deployable requires collaboration between multidisciplinary teams, including material engineering, structural biology, computational biology, immunology, bioinformatics, and policymakers. Novel delivery platforms, such as LNP-mRNA technology, induce robust adaptive immune responses. Structure-guided antigen design provides a more rational approach to potentiating protective immunity. Novel adjuvants will promote the activation of adaptive immunity. Developing universal vaccines to overcome the imprinting issue requires advanced antigen design and an understanding of virus–host immune interactions. Anti-idiotypic vaccination strategies provide the opportunity to harness the power of the immune system itself as a mode of immunization. Novel animal model development would facilitate the evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy, providing robust evidence before preclinical and clinical testing in humans. Vaccine skepticism and hesitation can be overcome using combined strategies, including improved infrastructure, public education, technological advancement, and established regulatory policies. All these elements constitute a comprehensive strategy to combat infectious diseases and improve human health.

This figure illustrates various RNA formats that have been explored or utilized, including conventional mRNA ( A B C D E F Figure 2 Repeated SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations elicit a dominant immune response against the ancestral Wuhan-Hu-1 strain. Variants of concern pose significant threats to global health. However, booster doses of spike-based vaccines targeting these emerging variants predominantly recall the conserved immune response imprinted by the ancestral strain, resulting in limited protection against the variants.
