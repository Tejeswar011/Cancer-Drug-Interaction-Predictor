Due to its aggressive nature and resistance to conventional treatments, there is a pressing need to develop novel and more effective therapies for this deadly malignancy. Here, we explored the therapeutic potential of the DNA minor groove binders trabectedin (TRB) and lurbinectedin (LUR) for the treatment of iCCA using cell lines, spheroids, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs), and the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) in vivo model. TRB and, more substantially, LUR, significantly inhibited cell growth in iCCA cell lines, spheroids, CAFs, and PDOs at very low nanomolar concentrations. Specifically, the two drugs significantly reduced proliferation, triggered apoptosis, and caused DNA damage in iCCA cells. At the metabolic level, TRB and LUR decreased mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. At the molecular level, the two compounds effectively downregulated the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and Hippo/YAP pathways and suppressed the expression of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-Myc), E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1), Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), TEA domain transcription factor 4 (TEAD4), and cluster of differentiation 7 (CD7) proto-oncogenes. Furthermore, LUR significantly restrained the in vivo growth of iCCA cells in the CAM model. Our data indicate that TRB and LUR possess strong anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activities and could represent promising therapeutic agents for the treatment of iCCA. intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma trabectedin lurbinectedin innovative therapies DNA damage response patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs) cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) apoptosis Italian Association Against Cancer (AIRC) IG 24815 IG 23117 This work was supported by grants from the Italian Association Against Cancer (AIRC) grant number IG 24815 to G.L.G. and IG 23117 to C.R.

Introduction Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) is the second most common primary liver cancer, arising from the epithelial cells of the intrahepatic bile ducts and accounting for approximately 15% to 20% of all liver malignancies [ 1 2 3 The primary risk factors associated with the development of iCCA include primary sclerosing cholangitis, fibro-polycystic liver disease, chronic infections with hepatitis B and C viruses, hepatobiliary flukes, hepatolithiasis, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, in many cases, iCCA occurs without any identifiable risk factors [ 4 5 6 7 8 There is a growing trend toward combining systemic therapy, locoregional therapies, and molecular approaches [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Recent studies have concentrated on synthesizing new compounds or screening bioactive components from natural products to create innovative treatments for unresectable tumors. In our pursuit of new approaches for treating iCCA, we began investigating the anticancer drugs trabectedin (TRB; Yondelis, ET-743) and lurbinectedin (LUR; Zepzelca) [ 16 17 Ecteinascidia turbinata 18 19 20 21 20 22 23 24 25 26 TRB is used as a second-line treatment in the clinical setting for advanced soft tissue sarcoma, particularly liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma, as well as for relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer when combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin [ 27 28 29 30 17 31 32 Notably, both TRB and LUR not only affect cancer cells but also have a significant impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME). This includes immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), as well as the blood vessels within the tumor. These compounds work by blocking various inflammatory mediators, reducing monocyte adhesion, and influencing the expression of genes involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Additionally, they hinder the production of angiogenic factors that are essential for tumor growth and progression [ 33 34 NCT02454972 NCT05126433 NCT02210364 NCT00147212 NCT00050427 In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness and mechanisms of action of TRB and LUR in various in vitro models of iCCA. Our findings indicate that these two drugs show promise as therapeutic candidates for treating this aggressive type of cancer. 2. Results 2.1. Trabectedin and Lurbinectedin Restrain Cell Growth and Trigger DNA Damage in iCCA Cell Lines To determine the cytotoxic potential of TRB and LUR in iCCA, the two DNA minor groove binders were administered to six human iCCA cell lines (HUCCT1, CCLP1, KKU213, KKU156, KKU055, and SG231). The cell lines were treated with concentrations between 0 and 100 nM of TRB and LUR, and colorimetric MTT assays were performed 48 h after drug administration. Both drugs profoundly reduced tumor cell viability in the six cell lines tested in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1 50 To further elucidate the mechanisms of action of the two drugs in iCCA cells, the six cell lines were subjected to proliferation and apoptosis assays. As concerns cell proliferation, incubation with TRB and LUR at increasing concentrations (1 and 5 nM) significantly reduced bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation in the six cell lines, often with a more pronounced constraining effect induced by LUR, in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2 Supplementary Figure S1A–F Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S2A–D 35 36 To further substantiate our findings, randomly selected HUCCT1, KKU156, and KKU213 cell lines were treated with TRB and LUR at 1 nM concentration, and flow cytometry analysis was performed 24 h after starting drug exposure. First, we examined the apoptosis induced by the two compounds on the three cell lines, which was measured using Annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD). Treatment with the two drugs resulted in a substantial increase in cell apoptosis compared to the vehicle ( Figure 4 Supplementary Figures S3A,B and S4A,B Figure 4 Supplementary Figures S3C and S4C Supplementary Figure S5 Overall, the data indicate that TRB and LUR effectively inhibit the growth of iCCA cell lines by limiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and causing DNA damage. 2.2. Signaling Pathways Affected by Trabectedin and Lurbinectedin in Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Cell Lines Next, we aimed to identify the oncogenic cascades modulated by TRB and LUR in iCCA cells. Therefore, protein and mRNA extracted from HUCCT1, SG231, CCLP1, and KKU055 cell lines treated with DMSO, 1 nM TRB, and 1 nM LUR were subjected to Western blot ( Figure 5 Supplementary Figures S6 and S7 Supplementary Figure S6 Figure 5 Figure 5 37 c-Myc E2F1 TEAD4 BRD4 CDK7 c-Myc E2F1 BRD4 CDK7 Supplementary Figure S7 Altogether, the present data indicate that TRB and LUR affect various pathways and oncogenic transcription factors in iCCA cells. 2.3. Trabectedin and Lurbinectedin Decrease Mitochondrial Respiration and Glycolysis in iCCA Cells To evaluate whether TRB and LUR affect iCCA metabolism, we assessed their influence on mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis of KKU055 and HUCCT1 cells. To determine the mitochondrial respiratory capacity, the oxygen consumption rate was quantified ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 As concerns glycolysis, both drugs affected this metabolic pathway in KKU055 cells ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 To investigate further the molecular mechanisms by which TRB and LUR influence mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, we evaluated the expression levels of key regulators involved in these metabolic processes in KKU055 and HUCCT1 cells. We focused on some regulators that are governed by the transcription factors E2F1 and c-Myc, which we found to be downregulated by TRB and LUR. Our results indicated that mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1; both involved in mitochondrial biogenesis), as well as lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) and phosphoglacerate mutase 1 (PGAM1; both involved in glycolysis), were all downregulated in both KKU055 and HUCCT1 cell lines, particularly in the cells treated with LUR ( Supplementary Figure S8 Overall, the data suggest that LUR and, to a lesser extent, TRB reduce mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis of iCCA cells. 2.4. Effects of Trabectedin and Lurbinectedin on the Subcellular Structure of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Cells Next, the ultrastructural morphology of iCCA cells from KKU055 treated with TRB and LUR was analyzed using transmission electron microscopy. Various parameters were examined to assess changes in cell morphology, including cell size and shape, the status of the nucleus (heterochromatin and euchromatin), and the state of the mitochondria (size, shape, matrix density, and cristae structure). After treatment with the drugs, several notable changes were observed. Membrane blebbing and the presence of apoptotic bodies indicated the onset of apoptosis. Additionally, many cells appeared rounded, making it challenging to distinguish between heterochromatin and euchromatin. Also, the mitochondria exhibited significant alterations, such as a less electron-dense matrix and irregularities in the cristae structure. Some mitochondria showed a rounded shape and pronounced swelling. Furthermore, vacuole formation was observed, along with partial rupture of the cell membrane. These findings were consistent following exposure to either TRB or LUR ( Figure 8 2.5. Trabectedin and Lurbinectedin Hamper Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Organoid Growth Organoids are three-dimensional miniature structures derived from stem cells that recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity, structure, and functions of human organs, often serving as a drug testing model [ 38 39 Figure 9 2.6. Trabectedin and Lurbinectedin Hinder Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Growth In Vitro Accumulating evidence from other tumor types suggests that TRB and LUR play a role in regulating the tumor microenvironment [ 22 23 33 34 40 Figure 10 Figure 10 2.7. Lurbinectedin Reduces iCCA Growth In Vivo Finally, we assessed the impact of LUR on the growth of iCCA in vivo using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay ( Figure 11 Figure 11 n n 3 3 p Figure 11 Figure 11 41 3. Discussion iCCA is an aggressive epithelial malignancy of the biliary tract characterized by increasing global incidence and late-stage clinical presentation owing to the lack of disease-specific symptoms. The tumor exhibits marked therapeutic resistance, rapid progression, and poor patient survival, rendering it a major oncological challenge. Consequently, iCCA constitutes a significant health burden worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes in this lethal cancer type [ 1 2 3 4 5 In this study, we investigated the effects of TRB and LUR on the growth of iCCA cells. Both TRB and LUR are promising antineoplastic agents known for their favorable toxicity profiles and unique mechanisms of action. These drugs create adducts in the minor groove of DNA, leading to single-strand and double-strand breaks. This process initiates a cascade of events that ultimately results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [ 16 17 18 25 26 37 27 28 29 30 Regarding iCCA, only one promising study has examined the effects of TRB, which was found to inhibit genes and microRNAs related to several cellular processes, including protein modification, migration, motility, and apoptosis, in a patient-derived xenograft and associated cell line [ 42 Notably, we observed that the restraint of tumor cell growth and the inhibition of hCAFs occurred at low nanomolar concentrations of both drugs, highlighting their effectiveness in the tested models. These results indicate that TRB and LUR effectively target both cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in iCCA. Supporting this observation, previous studies have shown that TRB and LUR possess the unique ability to simultaneously kill cancer cells while affecting several aspects of the TME across various cancer types. The drugs achieve this objective by inducing selective apoptosis of monocytes and macrophages and by inhibiting the transcription of multiple inflammatory mediators, which ultimately helps alleviate the immunosuppressive environment [ 33 40 43 YAP1 TEAD4 E2F1 c-Myc BRD4 CDK7 43 In the context of cellular metabolism, treatment with LUR resulted in a significant decrease in mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in iCCA cell lines. This pattern was also observed with TRB, although to a lesser extent. Ongoing work in our laboratory is focused on delineating the specific targets of TRB and LUR in iCCA growth and metabolic pathways. While this study presents promising findings that may inform future treatment strategies for iCCA, several limitations should be considered. Although a broad range of preclinical models was employed, including human iCCA cell lines, 3D spheroids, PDOs, CAFs, and the CAM assay, the lack of validation in mammalian models limits conclusions regarding pharmacokinetics, systemic toxicity, and tolerability. The CAM assay, while offering an in vivo-like environment and not classified as an animal model under EU regulations, does not replicate the complexity of mammalian immune and stromal interactions, which are essential for evaluating drug responses in a clinically relevant context. Also, the study did not investigate long-term treatment effects or the emergence of resistance mechanisms, which are particularly relevant given the aggressive nature and therapeutic resistance of iCCA. Additionally, the limited number of PDOs used may not fully reflect the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease, potentially affecting the generalizability of the findings. Our assays, including Annexin V-PE/7-AAD flow cytometry, cleaved PARP and caspase-3 Western blotting, γH2AX detection, and BrdU incorporation, were designed to assess apoptosis, necrosis, and DNA damage. However, other regulated cell death modalities such as immunogenic cell death (ICD) and ferroptosis were not evaluated. These pathways require distinct readouts, such as calreticulin exposure, extracellular ATP and HMGB1 release for ICD, and iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and ROS accumulation for ferroptosis. Previous studies have shown that LUR can induce ICD and that TRB may trigger ferroptosis and modulate tumor-associated macrophages [ 44 45 . Future research should aim to confirm the in vivo efficacy of TRB and LUR in mammalian models and explore their impact on the immune microenvironment. Moreover, investigating combination therapies with established or emerging agents may enhance therapeutic efficacy and help overcome resistance. Furthermore, expanding the diversity of patient-derived models and incorporating immune-competent systems will be essential to validate these strategies and support their clinical translation. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Lines and Reagents The HUCCT1, KKU156, KKU213, CCLP1, KKU055, and SG231 human iCCA cell lines, purchased from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB; Ibaraki, Osaka, Japan) or the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, USA), were employed in the experimental procedures. CCLP1, KKU055, KKU156, KKU213, and SG231 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA), whereas HUCCT1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco). All media were supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 U/mL penicillin, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Anprotec, Milpitas, CA, USA). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 4.2. Viability, Proliferation, Apoptosis, and DNA Damage Assays iCCA cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1.0 × 10 4 2 v v 50 Cell proliferation was assessed at the 48 h time point using the BrdU Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA). Briefly, cells were incubated with 1x bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 2 h and fixed for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the fixing solution was discarded, and cells were incubated with the anti-BrdU mouse antibody (# 5292; Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were stained with the HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody for 30 min at room temperature. After incubation with the TMB substrate solution for an additional 30 min at room temperature, the stop solution was added, and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Apoptosis was determined in the iCCA cell lines using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. To assess the extent of DNA damage, the DNA Damage Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was applied following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell line experiments were repeated at least three times in triplicate. 4.3. Flow Cytometry Assay Flow cytometry analysis was performed after treating iCCA cells with TRB or LUR. Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 10 5 4.4. Spheroid Generation and Assessment of Cell Viability To establish three-dimensional (3D) cultures enriched in CCA stem-like cells, cells were cultured for seven days under non-adherent conditions in poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (poly-HEMA)-coated dishes (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) using serum-free DMEM/F12 medium. The medium was supplemented with 1x B27 supplement (without vitamin A) (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF), and 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), as previously described [ 35 36 4.5. Patient-Derived Tumor Organoids (PDOs) PDO cultures were generated following established protocols. Briefly, iCCA tumor specimens (~1 cm 3 ® 46 Cell viability in PDOs was assessed using the MTT assay. Briefly, 1.0 × 10 4 ® 38 39 4.6. Isolation and Treatment of Human Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (hCAFs) hCAFs were isolated from iCCA tissues as previously reported [ 38 47 2 4.7. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) Total mRNA was extracted from iCCA cell lines using the Quick RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA). Subsequently, mRNA expression of the genes of interest was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The following TaqMan gene expression assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used: BRD4 (Hs04188087_m1), CDK7 (Hs00361486_m1), CTGF (Hs01026927_g1), CYR61 (Hs00155479_m1), E2F1 (Hs00153451_m1), LDHA (Hs01378790_g1), NRF1 (Hs00602161_m1), PGAM1 (Hs01652468_g1), TEAD4 (Hs01125032_m1), and TFAM (Hs00273372_s1). PCR reactions were conducted using 100 ng of cDNA from the collected samples, with an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). Cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, and then extension at 60 °C for 1 min. Quantitative values were calculated using the PE Biosystems Analysis software version 1.2.3 and expressed as N target (NT). NT  =  2 −ΔCt 4.8. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis Cells were homogenized in M-PER Mammalian Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing the Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For Western blotting, 40 μg protein was denatured by boiling in Tris-MOPS-SDS running buffer, resolved using SurePAGE gels (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA), and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) via electroblotting in Towbin buffer (25 mM Tris, 195 mM glycine, 20% methanol). Membranes were blocked in Pierce Protein-free Tween 20 Blocking Buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h and probed with the following specific antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology: anti-phospho-4EBP1 Thr37/46 Ser235/236 Ser473 Thr202/Tyr204 Ser139 Ser824 4.9. Seahorse Mitochondrial Respiration and Glycolysis Analyses Seahorse assays on adherent cell lines were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. KKU055 and HUCCT1 (1.0 × 10 4 2 2 2 2 4.10. Transmission Electron Microscopy Analysis KKU055 cells were resuspended in Cytoblock Reagent (Epredia, Dreieich, Germany) and subsequently embedded in 4% low-melting agarose. For the embedding process (post-fixation with osmium tetroxide, dehydration, infiltration with EPON) the LYNX microscopy tissue processor (Reichert-Jung, Wetzlar, Germany) was used. Semi-thin sections (0.75 µm), for the selection of relevant areas, and ultra-thin sections (80 nm) were cut by using the Reichert Ultracut S Microtome (Leica-Reichert, Wetzlar, Germany). First, the grids were contrasted with aqueous 2–uranyl-acetate, followed by 2–lead-citrate solution for 10 min, each. Electron-microscopic analysis was performed on 10 cells per group using the LEO 912AB transmission electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). 4.11. Chicken Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) Assay and Immunohistochemical Staining Fertilized, specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken eggs (VALO Biomedia, Osterholz-Scharmbeck, Germany) were kept at 37 °C and 80% constant humidity. On day 8, a window of 1.5–2.0 cm diameter was cut in the shell at the more rounded pole of the egg and sealed with tape (Durapore silk tape, 3M). The next day, 2.0 × 10 6 ® 4.12. Statistical Analysis GraphPad Prism version 10.2.1 software and IBM SPSS version 26 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) evaluated statistical significance. For IC 50 p p p p 5. Conclusions Overall, our study provides compelling evidence that TRB and LUR exert potent anti-tumor effects in iCCA across a range of preclinical models. Both agents effectively inhibit tumor cell proliferation and target components of the tumor microenvironment, such as CAFs, at low nanomolar concentrations. Mechanistically, TRB and LUR induce DNA damage, apoptosis, and downregulate key oncogenic pathways such as mTORC1 and YAP, while also suppressing the expression of proto-oncogenes and impairing cellular metabolism. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of TRB and LUR in iCCA and support further investigation into their mechanisms of action and combinatorial strategies. Future studies incorporating mammalian models and immune profiling will be essential to validate these results and advance TRB and LUR toward clinical application in this challenging malignancy.
