Introduction Quinazolin-4(3 H 1 2 H 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Figure 1 The quinazolinone skeleton is also widely found in many naturally occurring alkaloids isolated from various plants and microorganisms ( Figure 2 Dichroa febrifuga 11 Aspergillus nidulans Rhizophora stylosa 12 H H Bacillus cereus 13 β Bouchardatia neurococca 14 Peganum nigellastrum 15 Due to the wide range of biological activities exhibited by quinazolinone derivatives and the importance of these compounds as potential therapeutic candidates, numerous synthetic methods have been developed for their preparation. Classical methodologies for constructing the quinazolinone ring system, based on the Niementowski reaction and the condensation of anthranilic acid derivatives with carbonyl compounds, carboxylic acids, aryl halides, or ortho esters and amines, often require the use of hazardous chemicals, strong oxidants, and either high temperatures or long reaction times under specific reaction conditions [ 16 H H 2 3 17 H tert 18 H 2 3 19 Multicomponent reactions (MCRs) represent one of the most efficient and versatile approaches for the synthesizing new organic compounds, including biologically active quinazolinone derivatives. They enable the rapid and cost-effective construction of complex structures through the formation of multiple bonds in a single synthetic step, often under mild and environmentally friendly conditions [ 20 21 22 This mini-review highlights selected examples of the multicomponent-reaction-based synthesis of various substituted quinazolin-4(3 H H (1) Metal-catalyzed reactions, employing catalysts, such as palladium, copper, ruthenium, cobalt, and iridium; (2) Isatoic-anhydride-based strategies, utilizing isatoic anhydride as a key starting material for the construction of quinazolinone ring; (3) Alternative synthetic approaches involving, among others, the utilization of N 2. Metal (Palladium, Copper, Ruthenium, Cobalt, Iridium)-Catalyzed Reactions ( Scheme 1 2.1.

[ 28 2 Scheme 8 The optimized reaction conditions involved the use of MCM-41-2P-Pd(OAc) 2 Scheme 8 To eliminate the use of toxic carbon monoxide under high-pressure conditions, Ji and Zhu [ 29 H Scheme 9 t 2 A plausible mechanism involves the oxidative addition of Pd(0) to the aryl halide, followed by insertion of tert t N tert Scheme 9 tert 29 With this in mind, Zhu and Yang [ 30 Scheme 10 3 2 2 2 2 N N From a synthetic point of view, methodologies based on the widely available substrates as starting materials are more attractive and necessary as synthetic tools. A potential issue with the strategies outlined above is the availability of suitably substituted 2-aminobenzamides. On the other hand, 2-aminobenzonitrile derivatives are broadly available and could be used as precursors to the aforementioned anthranilamides, thereby improving substrate versatility. Building on these premises, Beller and Wu [ 31 2 2 2 2 3 Scheme 11 tert N N It can be surmised that the reaction proceeded via the aminocarbonylation of aryl bromides in a catalytic cycle, resulting in the formation of N 2 3 N Scheme 11 Condensed pyridoquinazolones are important due to their broad biological activity, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and CNS-related activities. Based on their experience in the synthesis of quinozalinones via palladium-catalyzed reactions, Wu and Beller [ 32 Scheme 12 3 H 3 Therefore, the deprotonated form of 2-aminopyridine underwent nucleophilic attack on the acyl-palladium intermediate, ultimately yielding linear products, after intramolecular nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Copper-Catalyzed Multicomponent Synthesis of Quinazolinones Copper salts have emerged as a promising alternative to more expensive catalytic systems, such as those based on palladium. The effectiveness of copper-based catalysis is well documented in the literature, particularly in cross-coupling reactions for the synthesis of numerous bioactive molecules and natural products. This is largely due to their good tolerance of various functional groups, low toxicity, and cost-effectiveness [ 37 38 Recognizing these features, Guo et al. [ 39 N An investigation into the scope and limitations of the reaction [ 39 3 N N Scheme 16 Scheme 17 Liang et al. [ 40 Scheme 18 2 tert 3 2 2 As reported by the authors, a small amount of 3-arylquinazolinones was detected when anilines and alkyl amines were used as coupling partners. However, 3-alkylquinazolinones were obtained with high selectivity each time, which can be attributed to the higher reactivity of alkyl amines. Mechanistic studies ( Scheme 19 The next step involves an intramolecular Friedel–Crafts (F-C) aminoalkylation at the ortho Shinde and Kshirsagar [ 41 Scheme 20 para 2 2 3 3 i 3 Based on a series of experiments, the authors [ 41 N 3 2 Scheme 20 Tripathi et al.

Remarkably, alkyl alcohols also reacted well under the optimized reaction conditions to provide corresponding lactams. However, when alcohols were used, the addition of 2 eq. of TBHP was necessary to oxidize them into the corresponding aldehyde, which served as key intermediates in the synthesis of quinazolinones from alcohols ( Scheme 22 Even more TBHP was required when methyl arenes were used as a substrate for the synthesis of quinazolinone; in this case, as much as 3 eq. was needed. Considering this fact and the results of a series of control experiments, the authors suggest that tert tert Scheme 22 3 ortho meta para In 2017, Mulakayala [ 43 H Scheme 23 p 3 3 d H The authors’ proposed route for constructing the quinazolinone skeleton is presented in the lower part of Scheme 23 p 2 In turn, Alves et al.

The desired lactams were obtained in good-to-excellent yields (74–96%). An important issue for the authors was understanding the mechanism of this conversion ( Scheme 28 4 2 2 18 H H 2.4.

Strategies for the Synthesis of Quinazolinones Involving Isatoic Anhydride ( Scheme 33 One of the more widely used strategies for obtaining the quinazolinone skeleton involves the use of isatoic anhydride as a key building block ( Scheme 33 H H molecules-30-03729-sch033_Scheme 33 Scheme 33 Strategies for the synthesis of quinazolinones involving isatoic anhydride.

The ultrasound method, benefiting from cavitation effects, proved more efficient, delivering excellent yields (90–97%) within a short reaction time (up to 10 minutes, compared to several hours under reflux) and requiring only a low catalyst amount (12 mg).

However, benzyl amines with electron-donating groups on the phenyl ring afforded higher yields of the products (74–84%) than those with electron-withdrawing groups (64–77%). Furthermore, amines containing a heterocyclic ring, such as furan-2-ylmethanamine and (1 H Much attention has also been devoted to methods for synthesizing 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1 H H 64 65 The following examples illustrate the applicability of multicomponent reactions to the synthesis of 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1 H In 2021, Ghosh et al.

[ 81 H Scheme 58 2 3 tert 2 2 Scheme 58 Indoles bearing Me, I, F, Br, or Cl substituents on the phenyl ring were well tolerated under the optimized conditions. Their reactions with cyclohexylamine and glyoxylic acid afforded the corresponding lactams in a 53–75% yield. Moreover, it was observed that substituents on the indole aromatic ring, particularly Me at the C7 position, exhibited steric effects. Additionally, the reaction showed broad tolerance toward diverse amines. Both alkyl amines of varying chain lengths (e.g., ethyl, butyl, pentyl, cetyl) and sterically hindered amines (e.g., neopentylamine, isobutylamine, cycloheptanamine) were compatible. Furthermore, benzylamines bearing either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic ring, as well as tetrahydrofurfurylamine and tryptamine, also participated effectively in the transformation. The synthetic potential of this method was demonstrated in the two-step synthesis of the alkaloid Rutaecarpine, employing indole, tryptamine, and glyoxylic acid as reactants in a single domino procedure, followed by Bergman’s protocol. Additionally, the procedure was successfully scaled-up to the gram scale ( Scheme 59 According to a comprehensive mechanistic investigation ( Scheme 60 2/ 3 + Pyrrolopyrazinoquinazolinones are a group of heterocyclic compounds with promising pharmaceutical potential.

Conclusions Quinazolin-4(3 H The development of new synthesis methods involves not only the design of new reagents or catalysts but also the application of alternative activation techniques to conventional heating, such as microwave irradiation, ultrasound, photocatalysis, and mechanochemical activation. These aspects are also partially addressed in this review The main aim of this review is to summarize a wide range of innovative and efficient methods for constructing quinazolinone skeleton based on one-pot multicomponent reactions. MCRs serve as a powerful tool for generating libraries of highly functionalized compounds, often from readily available and inexpensive starting materials. This review focuses on the discussion of reaction conditions, substrate scope, and development of new reaction types and catalytic systems. In addition, the most important mechanistic aspects of the reported methods are highlighted. An equally important aspect discussed in the article is the environmental friend-liness of the applied methodologies, including the use of water as a solvent, the avoid-ance of toxic reagents, simple product separation, and catalyst recycling. Recent advances in the development of novel methodologies for the preparation of quinazolinone derivatives include, for example, a solvent- and oxidant-free mechanocatalyzed protocol reported by Sharma et al. [ 84 85 2 2 86 H In conclusion, it can be said that concern for the environment will play a key role in shaping the directions of future research in the field of quinazolinone synthesis.
