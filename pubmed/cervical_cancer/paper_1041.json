This study extends previous methods to: (1) measure the persistence of racial bias in mortgage lending for Black Americans by adding temporal trends and credit scores, and (2) evaluate the continuity of bias in discriminatory areas from 1990 to 2020. These additions create an indicator of persistent structural housing discrimination. We studied the Boston-Cambridge-Newton and Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan statistical areas to examine distinct historical trajectories and urban development. We estimated the odds of mortgage denial for census tracts. Overall, all tracts in Boston-Cambridge-Newton ( N N http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054 National Cancer Institute UM1CA221940-05S1 U01CA253912-02S2 Hughes Amy E. http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048 American Cancer Society CRP-22-080-01-CTPS Haas Jennifer S. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © The New York Academy of Medicine 2024 ",
