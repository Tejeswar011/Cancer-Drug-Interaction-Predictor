This systematic review investigates the intersection of IPV and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with a focus on four leading conditions: cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes. Advancing understanding in this area is essential for informing the development of targeted IPV prevention and intervention strategies, improving clinical care for affected populations, and shaping health equity policy responses. Methods Guided by the research question, “How does experiencing IPV influence the burden progression or management of non-communicable diseases among adults diagnosed with cardiovascular disease cancer chronic respiratory disease or diabetes?“ Results The review identified consistent positive associations between IPV and adverse outcomes across cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease, based on findings from 39 studies. Cancer emerged as the most frequently studied condition, with 19 publications, of which 14 focused specifically on breast or gynecological cancers. In contrast, research on the other NCDs was more limited, revealing an uneven distribution of scholarly attention and underscoring important gaps for future investigation. Risk of bias appraisal showed that 94.9% ( n n Conclusions This review highlights a growing body of evidence linking IPV with worsened outcomes for individuals living with NCDs. To advance the field, future research should prioritize the development and implementation of IPV screening tools tailored to NCD populations, adopt standardized IPV definitions and measurement strategies, and expand the use of longitudinal designs to better understand causal pathways and long-term health impacts.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines IPV as behaviors by current or former partners that cause physical, sexual, or psychological harm, including acts of physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse, and controlling behaviors [ 3 4 5 Approximately 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men have experienced severe physical violence from an intimate partner in their lifetime, and about 1 in 5 women and 1 in 13 men have experienced sexual violence by an intimate partner [ 3 6 7 7 9 3 10 Individuals with NCDs frequently interact with healthcare providers, making each clinical encounter an opportunity for screening and conversation of various social drivers of health, including IPV [ 11 12 13 14 14 10 Building on this need for greater clinical awareness, we conducted a systematic review to examine the intersection of IPV and NCDs. Our review synthesizes existing literature on IPV in the context of those diagnosed with a NCD, specifically cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, or diabetes (including kidney disease caused by diabetes). To guide our analysis, we focused on four key research questions: What is the prevalence of IPV among individuals with cardiovascular disease cancer chronic respiratory disease or diabetes? What IPV screening tools are used in studies examining IPV and NCD? How does the timing of IPV experiences relate to the onset of NCD? What is the relationship between IPV and disease severity or management in individuals with chronic conditions?What is the relationship between IPV and disease severity or management in individuals with chronic conditions? Methods Key definitions Three key definitions are critical to this review: NCD, IPV, and health outcome. Utilizing the WHO definitions, “NCD” was defined as a condition lasting one or more years that require ongoing medical attention, limit activities of daily living, or both [ 2 15 3 4 16 17 Search strategy This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [ 18 2 1 All resulting citations were imported to Covidence, a screening data extraction tool for conducting systematic reviews [ 19 1  Table 1 Keywords used in accessed databases Database Keywords PubMed 5147 articles ((“chronic disease“[tw] OR “chronic diseases“[tw] OR “chronic illness“[tw] OR “chronic illnesses“[tw] OR “chronic condition“[tw] OR “chronic conditions“[tw] OR “chronically ill“[tw] OR “heart diseases“[MeSH Terms] OR “heart disease“[tw] OR “heart diseases“[tw] OR “cardiovascular diseases”[MeSH Terms] OR “cardiovascular disease”[tw] OR “cardiovascular diseases”[tw] OR cancer[tw] OR cancers[tw] OR neoplasms[MeSH Terms] OR neoplasms[tw] OR tumor[tw] OR neoplasia[tw] OR “lung diseases“[MeSH Terms] OR “chronic lung disease“[tw] OR “pulmonary disease“[tw] OR “pulmonary diseases“[tw] OR “cystic fibrosis“[tw] OR Asthma[tw] OR stroke[MeSH Terms] OR stroke[tw] OR “alzheimer’s“[tw] OR alzheimer[tw] OR “alzheimer disease“[MeSH Terms] OR diabetes[tw] OR “diabetes mellitus“[MeSH Terms] OR “diabetes insipidus“[MeSH Terms] OR “kidney failure, chronic“[MeSH Terms] OR “renal insufficiency, chronic“[MeSH Terms] OR “chronic kidney disease“[tw] OR “chronic renal insufficiency“[tw] OR “organ transplantation“[tw] OR “transplant“[tw])) AND ((“intimate partner violence“[MeSH Terms] OR “domestic violence“[tw] OR “domestic abuse“[tw] OR “spouse abuse“[MeSH Terms] OR “spouse abuse“[tw] OR “partner abuse“[tw] OR “intimate partner violence“[tw] OR “intimate partner abuse“[tw] OR “dating violence“[tw] OR “rape”[tw] OR “gender-based violence“[MeSH Terms] OR “gender-based violence“[tw] OR “family violence“[tw])) PsychInfo 2456 articles chronic disease OR chronic diseases OR chronic illness OR chronic illnesses OR chronic condition OR chronic conditions OR chronically ill OR heart disease OR heart diseases OR cardiovascular disease OR cardiovascular diseases OR cancer OR cancers OR neoplasms OR tumor OR neoplasia OR lung diseases OR chronic lung disease OR pulmonary disease OR pulmonary diseases OR cystic fibrosis OR asthma OR stroke OR alzheimer s OR alzheimer OR diabetes OR diabetes mellitus OR diabetes insipidus OR chronic kidney disease OR chronic renal insufficiency OR organ transplantation OR transplant AND domestic violence OR intimate partner violence OR domestic abuse OR spouse abuse OR partner abuse OR intimate partner abuse OR dating violence OR rape OR gender based violence OR family violence Scopus 1589 articles (TITLE-ABS-KEY (“chronic disease” OR “chronic diseases” OR “chronic illness” OR “chronic illnesses” OR “chronic condition” OR “chronic conditions” OR “chronically ill” OR “heart disease” OR “heart diseases” OR “cardiovascular disease” OR “cardiovascular diseases” OR “cancer” OR “cancers” OR “neoplasms” OR “tumor” OR “neoplasia” OR “lung diseases” OR “chronic lung disease” OR “pulmonary disease” OR “pulmonary diseases” OR “cystic fibrosis” OR “asthma” OR “stroke” OR “Alzheimer” OR “diabetes” OR “diabetes mellitus” OR “diabetes insipidus” OR “chronic kidney disease” OR “chronic renal insufficiency” OR “organ transplantation” OR “transplant”)) AND ((TITLE-ABS-KEY (“domestic violence” OR “intimate partner violence” OR “domestic abuse” OR “spouse abuse” OR “partner abuse” OR “intimate partner abuse” OR “dating violence” OR “rape” OR “gender based violence” OR “family violence”))) Data abstraction and Preparation A Cochrane data abstraction form [ 20 Methodological quality assessment Two researchers (BWJ and SR) independently assessed the quality of the included studies using the appropriate JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for each study design (e.g. qualitative, cross-sectional, cohort, and randomized controlled trial) [ 21 2 3 4 5 22  Table 2 JBI critical appraisal questions for cross-sectional studies Q1 Were the criteria for inclusion in the sample clearly defined?

Evidence synthesis A narrative synthesis approach was employed due to substantial heterogeneity across included studies in terms of study design (e.g., cross-sectional, cohort, and randomized controlled trials), participant characteristics (e.g., age, clinical condition), IPV definitions and measurement tools, and the NCD outcomes assessed. Findings were grouped and analyzed thematically by NCD category, focusing on patterns in IPV exposure timing, measurement approaches, and outcomes. This method allowed for a structured summary and comparison of findings across diverse methodologies while accounting for contextual and measurement variability that precluded meta-analysis.

Eleven studies used a single measure of IPV and eight employed a combination of measures. The most frequently used measure was the Women’s Experience with Battering (WEB) scale [ 41 Table 6 27 27 25 24 Several studies examined the links between IPV and cancer patients’ experiences and access to care. One study found that 56% of participants felt IPV had intensified following their cancer diagnosis [ 40 30 26 32 23 These studies had several limitations including some with small sample sizes and others facing potential selection bias. For example, one study recruited participants exclusively from a gynecological oncology ward while another drew from local cancer support groups [ 23 29 Studies of diabetes and IPV Table 6 42 44 45 43 45 42 Despite the methodological differences, these studies highlight the significant health associations between IPV and diabetes outcomes. One study found a 15–20% increase in type 2 diabetes incidence among those experiencing physical IPV or prolonged IPV exposure, with an 80% higher risk for recent severe psychological IPV [ 42 45 44 43 Limitations of these studies include the use of non-validated measurement tools and tools that may not have fully captured the range or severity of IPV. While two studies utilized population-level data, the other two were restricted to a single geographic region, limiting the generalizability of findings. Studies of cardiovascular disease and IPV Table 6 46 47 48 All three studies found worse cardiovascular health outcomes for individuals with IPV experiences compared to those without. One study reported a higher likelihood of coronary heart disease among women with IPV histories [ 48 47 46 Study limitations included the use of non-validated study questions [ 47 48 46 48 Studies of respiratory disease and IPV Table 6 49 51 52 53 40 All three studies demonstrated the significant associations between IPV and asthma-related health outcomes. For example, women living in Brazil who reported past or current violence were at a higher risk for poor asthma control [ 41 25 However, these findings are subject to several limitations. First, all three studies used cross-sectional designs, preventing conclusions about causal relationships between IPV and asthma. Additionally, the U.S. study relied on the 2005 BRFSS survey, which excluded questions on psychological abuse, threats, and stalking, potentially can be linked to IPV underreporting. Furthermore, its data were limited to fewer than seven states, as not all states administered both the IPV and adult asthma modules. Results of multiple diseases and IPV Table 6 54 61 54 56 58 60 62 63 54 58 60 61 63 55 56 60 62 63 Regarding IPV measurement, seven studies used a single IPV survey tool, while three employed multiple tools. Notably, six studies relied on study-designed surveys, and the Conflict Tactics Scale was the only tool used in more than one study, appearing in three [ 42 44 In terms of data sources, eight studies analyzed population or healthcare data to assess IPV prevalence among individuals with multiple NCDs. One study compared population data with IPV organization records to examine NCD prevalence, while another utilized data from an anti-violence center. These methodological differences contributed to a wide range of reported IPV prevalence, from 3.9 to 32%. Nine of the ten studies identified associations between IPV and various health outcomes. Among the seven studies examining asthma, all found significant associations, including one that, after controlling for smoking, found women with asthma had 1.5 times higher odds of experiencing IPV compared to women without asthma. Of the five studies that examined cancer-related health outcomes, all found positive associations with IPV, with one study showing that women with cervical cancer had more than twice the odds of having experienced IPV compared to women without cervical cancer [ 45 r p r p 42 46 Other notable findings related to NCD management include that women with experiences of IPV were 1.5 times more likely to visit a doctor and nearly twice as likely to see a traditional healer in the past 12 months compared to those without IPV. A study from India also found that lifetime spousal violence victimization was associated with being underweight, with one possible explanation being the withholding of food as a form of abuse [ 47 Sources of heterogeneity Despite the methodological differences, the studies included in this review exhibited substantial heterogeneity in terms of IPV measurement tools, study design, participant characteristics, and geographical location, which contributed to variability in reported IPV prevalence and health outcomes. Differences such as the use of varied IPV screening instruments, inconsistent timeframes for IPV assessment, and the inclusion of populations with distinct cultural, socioeconomic, or health profiles likely explain much of the divergence in findings. Figure 2 This heterogeneity underscores the need for greater consistency in IPV measurement across research involving NCD populations. Future studies should prioritize the development, validation, and implementation of IPV screening tools that are tailored to individuals living with chronic conditions. From a clinical perspective, the lack of standardized tools and definitions can hinder accurate detection of IPV in healthcare settings, leading to missed opportunities for early intervention and comprehensive care. Standardizing measurement approaches will not only strengthen the evidence base but also support clinicians in identifying and addressing IPV more effectively in NCD care settings.

Most notably, concerns related to the reliability and validity of IPV measurement tools were prevalent. Some studies relied on single-item questions, unvalidated screening tools, or measures that did not capture the full scope of IPV (e.g., emotional abuse, coercive control). These gaps raise important questions about the consistency and comparability of IPV measurement across studies and suggest that findings may underestimate the true burden of IPV among populations affected by NCDs. Discussion This review highlights the growing body of research examining the intersection of IPV and NCDs, with 39 identified studies exploring associations with cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease. Notably, cancer was the most frequently studied condition, with 19 publications, 14 of which focused on breast or gynecological cancers. An additional five multi-NCD articles incorporated cancer outcomes. In contrast, research on other NCDs was more limited, revealing an uneven distribution of research attention across NCDs and highlighting gaps that warrant further exploration. Prevalence and forms of IPV Across the 39 studies, IPV prevalence ranged widely, from 0.98 to 90%, likely reflecting differences in study design, eligibility criteria, population characteristics, and IPV definitions utilized. While multiple forms of IPV were assessed, including physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, only two studies examined economic abuse. This omission is concerning, given that economic dependence is a well-documented barrier to leaving violent relationships [ 64 65 Most common IPV instruments The most used instrument in the reviewed studies was the Women’s Experiences with Battering (WEB) Scale, applied in 13 studies. The WEB Scale’s strength lies in its ability to capture the subjective experiences of psychological vulnerability and a survivor’s sense of power and control in her relationship [ 41 66 67 50 Additionally, it is important to recognize that measurement differences as well as differences in reliability and validity of each screening tool may have influenced findings. Nearly one-third of the studies included relied on researcher-created questionnaires, rather than validated scales. While tailored measures may address population-specific concerns, the lack of validation in diverse populations raises questions about comparability across studies. It remains unclear whether these instruments were originally developed or adapted from existing tools, underscoring the need for greater transparency in reporting measurement approaches. The Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS) or its revised version (CTS-2) was used in nine studies, including six conducted in the U.S and one each in Italy, Brazil, and China. While the CTS initially advanced IPV research by focusing on behavioral descriptions (i.e., hitting, punching, threatening) rather than using terms like ‘abuse’ or ‘rape,’ [ 68 52 52 Beyond the known limitations of the CTS, comparisons across studies in this review should be interpreted with caution, as variations in measurement may have affected the consistency of reported IPV experiences. In some cases, studies developed their own IPV questions without using validated screening tools or adapted validated tools without testing, further limiting comparability. Effective IPV screening in NCD populations requires tools sensitive to the unique challenges of living with a NCD [ 53 69 70 36 Barriers to preventative care and the underestimation of chronic disease in IPV survivors In the U.S., research indicates that IPV survivors generally have higher rates of overall healthcare use and costs but are more likely to seek urgent or emergency care rather than preventive services, such as mammograms or routine physical screenings [ 71 36 72 56 56 73 73 11  Table 11 Application of adapted NASEM social care ‘5A’ framework [ 73 Social Care Category Definition Application to IPV Awareness Activities that identify the social risks and assets of defined patients and populations. Healthcare systems require providers to increase their knowledge of the dynamics of IPV. Adjustment Activities that alter clinical care to accommodate identified social barriers. Incorporating shared decision-making to improve rapport, trust, and health outcomes. Universal education and/or screening efforts are incorporated. Assistance Activities that reduce social risk by connecting patients with social care resources. Design services that maximize dignity (i.e. gift cards provided to exchange in food pantries or for clothing). Alignment Activities by health care systems to understand existing social care assets in the community and then organize and invest in healthcare activities to facilitate synergies that positively affect outcomes. Incorporate trauma lens to evaluate the system as a whole (i.e. analyze and share data related to health outcomes of IPV survivors). Advocacy Activities in which health care organizations work with partner social care organizations to promote policies that facilitate the development and (re)deployment of assets or resources to address health and social needs. Engaging local, state, and federal levels to address social drivers of health, including the policies, institutions, and systemic inequities that impact social drivers of health (i.e. advocate for policies that address barriers to leaving violent relationships such as expanding Medicaid for IPV survivors or guaranteed insurance coverage for IPV survivors)[ 74 Limited longitudinal data A notable gap in IPV research is the scarcity of longitudinal studies, with only four studies employing such a design. Longitudinal research is critical for understanding the temporal relationship between IPV and NCD outcomes, including long-term health outcomes for survivors. This approach allows researchers to identify risk factors (i.e. economic stress, mental health conditions), that influence IPV persistence or shape NCD trajectories. Longitudinal data also offers insights to evolving SDH, providing a more comprehensive understanding of quality of life among NCD patients with IPV experiences [ 5 Future studies should also consider qualitative longitudinal designs to capture survivors’ evolving perspectives, coping strategies, and interactions with healthcare and support systems over time. Such approaches can offer rich, contextual insights into the lived experiences of individuals managing both IPV and chronic disease. Strengths and limitations of this review This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the intersection between IPV and four common NCDs, identifying key research gaps, particularly the limited focus on economic abuse and NCDs. However, several limitations must be considered. Despite an extensive search strategy, some relevant publications may have been missed. Additionally, focusing on the four NCDs in the WHO 4 × 4 framework, this review excludes other NCDs that may intersect with IPV. Methodological variation, including differences in IPV definitions, measurement tools, and study design limits comparability. Furthermore, many included studies focused on specific subpopulations, such as individuals with breast cancer or participants from U.S.-based cohorts, which may limit the generalizability of findings to other contexts. Finally, inconsistency in how studies address potential confounders, such as education, socioeconomic status, and health-related behaviors, underscores the complexity of disentangling the pathways linking IPV and chronic disease outcomes. Conclusion Despite methodological differences, this review highlights the heightened vulnerability of individuals experiencing both IPV and NCD. The findings reveal positive associations between IPV and diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease, underscoring the need for more rigorous and methodologically consistent research. Future studies should prioritize the development and validation of IPV screening tools specific to the NCD population, expand the use of longitudinal designs, and adopt standardized IPV measurement approaches. Strengthening the evidence base is essential for developing effective interventions and support systems that address the complex health needs of IPV survivors living with NCDs.
