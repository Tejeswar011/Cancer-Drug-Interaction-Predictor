Although the postpartum breast undergoes extensive involution and remodeling, the molecular drivers that promote subsequent tumor development remain incompletely understood. We investigated whether signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1) contribute to epithelial proliferation through suppression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Methods Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded postpartum ( n n Results Transcriptomic profiling revealed a postpartumspecific interferon signature (STAT1, GBP1), elevated Ki67, and reduced CDKIs; immunofluorescence across > 200 lobules confirmed these increases and suggested that GBP1 fully mediates the STAT1–Ki67 link. In HMECs, knockdown of STAT1 or GBP1 induced a marked rise in p21 and p57 (CDKN1A and CDKN1C), accompanied by G1 cell cycle arrest and reduced proliferation. Combined knockdown had an additive effect on suppressing epithelial proliferation, suggesting a cooperative role for STAT1 and GBP1 in modulating cell cycle progression. Conclusions These findings identify a STAT1–GBP1 axis that enhances postpartum epithelial proliferation by repressing CDKI expression. This mechanism may help to explain the heightened vulnerability observed after childbirth and highlights potential biomarkers or early intervention targets in postpartum breast tissues.

This transition involves extensive immune cell infiltration to clear dying cells, as well as dynamic extracellular matrix reorganization [ 11 12 13 16 Cytokine-driven JAK/STAT signaling pathways, including those involving interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), are central to immune responses but can also influence epithelial cell fate [ 17 20 21 24 25 26 27 Mammary epithelial cell proliferation is tightly controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs), which together regulate cell cycle progression [ 28 30 31 32 In postpartum tissues, the JAK/STAT pathway has been implicated in mammary gland remodeling, alveolar cell clearance, and immune cell infiltration during involution. Specifically, STAT1 is recognized as a key mediator of cytokine-driven signaling that regulates epithelial homeostasis, although its postpartum-specific role remains less fully explored [ 33 34 22 23 In this study, we harnessed multiple complementary approaches—transcriptomic profiling, multiplex immunofluorescence, and functional assays in patient-derived human normal breast tissue biopsies and human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs)—to identify molecular programs that may contribute to subsequent development of PPBC. Examining postpartum and nulliparous normal breast tissues from a carefully matched cohort, we uncovered elevated expression of STAT1 and GBP1, alongside increased proliferation markers and altered CDKI dynamics, in postpartum tissues. Using multiplex immunofluorescence and lobulelevel mediation analysis, we further tested whether GBP1 transmits STAT1 signalling to the proliferative marker Ki67 in vivo. Functional knockdowns of STAT1 or GBP1 in postpartum-derived HMECs induced G1 arrest and increased CDKI expression, providing direct mechanistic support for a STAT1-GBP1 axis that sustains epithelial proliferation. By situating these findings within a human tissue-based model system, we provide a physiologically relevant framework for understanding how postpartum breast remodeling might interact with oncogenic pathways. These insights lay the groundwork for future investigations into the molecular interplay between immune signaling, epithelial plasticity, and health disparities in PPBC. Notably, our data raise the question of why certain postpartum remodeling pathways—normally transient—may remain activated or become dysregulated in some parous women, thereby contributing to malignant transformation. Clarifying these mechanisms could guide risk stratification, inform early intervention, and enable the development of targeted strategies to mitigate the excess risk carried by postpartum women. Materials and methods Study population Women under 45 years of age undergoing mastectomies for invasive breast cancer or breast reduction procedures at Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, between July 2019 and April 2024 were recruited for this study. Eligible participants included postpartum women (within five years of their last childbirth) and age- and BMI-matched nulliparous controls. Both European American and African American women were included in the study population. Women with prior breast cancer diagnoses or previous breast surgeries were excluded. This study was conducted under the approval of the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB #19-001672). All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. Breast tissue samples were collected and processed for organoid preparation, formalin fixation and paraffin embedding (FFPE), and snap-frozen for RNA extraction. All tissue samples used for analysis were confirmed cancer-free by pathological diagnosis. Transcriptomic profiling and gene set enrichment analysis Total RNA was extracted from 10 μm FFPE breast tissue sections using the RNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen, Cat# 73504) following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality and concentration were measured using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Samples were profiled using the NanoString IO360 and BC360 panels, which target 1,500 distinct genes relevant to oncology and breast cancer biology. Hybridization reactions were processed using the nCounter Prep Station, and fluorescent counts were acquired with the nCounter Digital Analyzer. Data were normalized using nSolver 4.0 software with background correction and housekeeping gene normalization. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on the NanoString data to identify enriched biological pathways, following the method described by Subramanian et al. [ 35 Tissue processing for organoids and derivation of HMECs Breast tissue samples were processed into organoids and human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) were derived as described by LaBarge et al. 2013 [ 36 Knockdown of STAT1 and GBP1 in HMECs siRNA Transfection Lentiviral Transduction NM_007315 NM_007314 NM_002053 NM_002053 RNA extraction and gene expression analysis Total RNA was extracted from HMECs using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and quantified with a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 µg of RNA and the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted using the QuantStudio 7 Flex system with TaqMan assays specific for STAT1, GBP1, CDKN1A, and CDKN1C (Applied Biosystems). Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2^−ΔΔCT method, normalizing to GAPDH as the internal control. Multiplex immunofluorescence on FFPE breast tissue Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks of benign breast parenchyma obtained from five postpartum and five agematched nulliparous women were sectioned at 5 μm onto MAS slides (Matsunami) to minimize tissue loss during repeated heating and stripping cycles. Prior to multiplexing, each primary antibody was validated on serial sections by conventional chromogenic immunohistochemistry and by singleplex immunofluorescence to confirm both staining pattern and optimal working dilution, first in reference tissues with known abundance of the target antigen and then in normal breast tissue. Optimized conditions were carried forward into a fivecolor Opal protocol (Akoya Biosciences) adapted from Parra et al., 2017 [ 37 The final panel was applied in the following sequence: STAT1 (Cell Signaling #14994, 1:2.13, Opal-520), GBP1 (Abcam #ab131255, 1:2.6 ≈ 0.39, Opal-690), Ki67 (Dako M7240, 1:9 ≈ 0.11, Opal-480), and cytokeratin AE1/AE3 (Dako M3515, 1:6.8 ≈ 0.15, Opal-780); all antibody dilutions are given as reciprocal values to allow direct replication. DAPI counterstain was applied in the final step. Slides were imaged on a PhenoImager HT 2.0 platform (Akoya Biosciences) using manufacturerrecommended exposure times, spectral libraries and autofocus settings. Multispectral images were unmixed with inForm 2.6; the autofluorescence library generated from the control slide was applied to all samples. Epithelial regions were delineated by cytokeratin signal, nuclei were segmented by DAPI and fine-tuned with assisting components, and markerpositive cells were identified with phenotype thresholds derived from singleplex controls. For every morphologically intact, noninvoluting lobule present on the section, the percentage of STAT1, GBP1 or Ki67positive cells in the epithelial segment was exported for downstream statistical analysis. Cell proliferation and cell cycle assays EdU Incorporation Assay Propidium Iodide Staining for Cell Cycle Analysis Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.1. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher’s exact test, while continuous variables were analyzed with two-tailed unpaired t-tests with Welch’s correction or the Mann–Whitney U-test, as appropriate. Heatmaps and gene expression comparisons were generated using GraphPad Prism. NanoString data normalization and statistical analyses were performed with nSolver 4.0 software, while GSEA was performed using GSEA V4.3.2 software. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Accordingly, we next analyzed the full lobule dataset but safeguarded against pseudoreplication by fitting a simple ordinary leastsquares model with a parity indicator while computing Huber–White standard errors clustered on patient identity. This clusteraware approach preserved every lobule yet treated the cohort as ten independent subjects. The resulting coefficients represented the mean difference in the marker expression between postpartum and nulliparous lobules, with robust inference that accounts for intra-patient variability.

Targeted knockdown of STAT1 or GBP1 using siRNA or lentiviral constructs led to substantial increases in key CDKIs: CDKN1A (p21) expression rose by 9- to 10-fold, and CDKN1C (p57) by 5- to 6-fold (Fig. 4 4 4  Fig. 4 STAT1 and GBP1 regulate cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs).

PI staining revealed significant G1 arrest, as the percentage of cells in G1 increased from 37% in controls to 74% in knockdown cells (Figs. 5 6 7  Fig. 5 Knockdown of STAT1 and GBP1 induces G1 cell cycle arrest in HMECs.

(A) (B) (C) (D) p These results establish a mechanistic link between STAT1/GBP1 activity and the proliferative state of postpartum mammary epithelial cells. By suppressing CDKI expression, STAT1 and GBP1 appear to facilitate G1-S transition and sustained proliferation. Their cooperative action suggests a key regulatory axis that may be foundational to the pro-growth signaling milieu observed in postpartum breast tissues. Together, these data provide a physiologically relevant, human tissue-based framework for understanding how postpartum involution-associated signaling pathways modulate the epithelial cell cycle and potentially influence subsequent breast cancer risk. Discussion This study provides evidence that STAT1 and GBP1 cooperatively modulate mammary epithelial cell proliferation during the postpartum period by suppressing CDKIs and promoting cell cycle progression. Through an integrated approach—combining transcriptomic profiling of carefully matched postpartum and nulliparous human breast tissues, immunohistochemical validation, and functional manipulations in primary HMECs—we delineate a postpartum-specific network that may contribute to the heightened risk of PPBC. Our findings place ISGs, including STAT1 and GBP1, at the center of a regulatory hub that links the postpartum inflammatory milieu to the control of epithelial proliferation. By comparing postpartum and nulliparous breast tissues, we identified a distinct transcriptional signature characterized by elevated STAT1, GBP1, and multiple cyclins and CDKs, coupled with reduced expression of key CDKIs (e.g., CDKN1A/p21, CDKN1C/p57). Gene set enrichment analysis reinforced this connection, revealing significant enrichment of proliferation- and cell cycle–related pathways, as well as breast cancer–associated gene sets, in postpartum tissues [ 1 40 42 Our mediation analysis revealed a molecular chain that is active only in the postpartum breast: STAT1, a canonical interferonresponse transcription factor, transcriptionally upregulates GBP1, and GBP1 becomes the proximate driver of epithelial proliferation. The simplest view of the dataset, one median value per patient, already showed that STAT1, GBP1 and the proliferation marker Ki67 are all higher in the postpartum breast; the same pattern persisted when every lobule was analyzed with patientclustered inference. The mediation analysis clarified how these markers are linked. In postpartum lobules, nearly the whole association between STAT1 and Ki67 flowed through GBP1, whereas the direct effect of STAT1 on Ki67, after adjusting for GBP1, not only shrank but reversed sign, indicating that once GBP1 is considered, higher STAT1 is associated with lower Ki67. Such a sign change, termed inconsistent mediation, suggests that the pathway through GBP1 captures virtually all of the proliferative influence of STAT1. In nulliparous lobules neither the component paths nor the indirect effect was detectable, confirming that the cascade is dormant in resting breast tissue. This model is biologically plausible. STAT1 binding sites flank the human GBP1 promoter [ 43 27 44 45 In combination with our HMEC results, our findings refine the temporal and mechanistic landscape of STAT1 biology. Whereas the GEICAM EMBARCAM study linked STAT1 over expression to established pregnancy associated tumors [ 25 STAT1 26 27 The apparently favorable association of GBP1 and STAT1 with recurrencefree survival in bulktumor datasets [ 46 47 We found that silencing STAT1 and GBP1 in postpartum-derived HMECs curtailed proliferative pathways (Figs. 4 5 6 7 data not shown 27 48 49 50 51 43 52 53 14 Critically, functional studies in postpartum-derived HMECs provided direct mechanistic support for the role of STAT1 and GBP1 in regulating CDKI levels. Knocking down either STAT1 or GBP1 not only increased CDKN1A and CDKN1C expression but also induced G1 cell cycle arrest and suppressed proliferation. These perturbations were additive rather than purely overlapping, underscoring a cooperative relationship. These observations suggest that, in the postpartum setting, STAT1 and GBP1 can override normal proliferative checkpoints. Whether such changes facilitate early oncogenic events and influence PPBC risk remains to be determined in longitudinal studies. These findings align with a growing body of literature indicating that the postpartum breast, undergoing involution and substantial remodeling, is a dynamic environment in which immune-derived signals can influence epithelial cell fate. The infiltration of immune cells, release of cytokines, and shifts in the extracellular matrix are well-documented hallmarks of involution [ 17 19 22 23 54 62 63 Our functional studies implicate STAT1 and GBP1 as key upstream regulators of epithelial cell proliferation. Knockdown of either STAT1 or GBP1 in HMECs led to robust upregulation of CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN1C (p57), resulting in cell cycle arrest at G1 and decreased proliferation. These data provide direct experimental evidence supporting the regulatory role of STAT1 and GBP1 in controlling epithelial cell proliferation. Previous studies have identified STAT1 as a critical mediator of interferon responses and an enhancer of p53-dependent growth arrest [ 37 43 While GBP1 is often discussed in the context of viral defense, it is also implicated in immunity to various intracellular pathogens (including Chlamydia) [ 64 22 23 Our approach, leveraging patient-derived tissues and primary HMECs, offers a physiologically relevant perspective. The careful matching of postpartum and nulliparous cohorts and use of NanoString panels encompassing 1,500 cancer-related genes yielded a robust dataset that facilitated the identification of 185 significantly altered genes. While we acknowledge that the sample size ( n n Future efforts can build on this foundation. Larger cohorts and longitudinal sampling may help determine whether STAT1/GBP1-driven changes precede malignant transformation or reflect an intermediate stage in cancer evolution. Similarly, dissecting the interplay between STAT1/GBP1 and other postpartum involution signals, such as specific cytokines or extracellular matrix components, will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the postpartum niche. Complementary approaches, including spatial transcriptomics and high-dimensional imaging, could elucidate the cellular architecture of postpartum breast tissue and define how immune cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial clusters interact to sustain JAK/STAT activation. In addition, exploring targeted modulation of STAT1 or GBP1 in experimental models may illuminate their therapeutic potential. If inhibition of these factors can restore CDKI levels and normalize epithelial proliferation, then targeting the STAT1‑GBP1 axis could be explored as a strategy to mitigate postpartum‑associated vulnerability. Such strategies could be especially relevant for individuals at elevated risk due to parity-related factors or those who face health disparities, as postpartum breast cancer risk is known to vary by race and ethnicity [ 8 10 In conclusion, this study characterizes a STAT1-GBP1 axis that directs epithelial proliferation by regulating CDKI expression in postpartum breast tissues. The alignment of transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional data provides a cohesive mechanistic model that advances our understanding of molecular changes that accompany the postpartum state. While further research is warranted to fully chart the postpartum regulatory landscape and translate these insights to clinical interventions, our work lays groundwork for developing strategies to identify and monitor postpartum molecular signals that could inform breast‑cancer risk assessment.
