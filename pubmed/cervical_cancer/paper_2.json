Inappropriate and incomplete referrals contribute to delayed access to these providers. Referral guidelines and physician education have been shown to decrease such inefficiencies. Therefore, the goal of this study was to address inappropriate referrals directed to the neurosurgical spine assessment clinic via implementation of a quality improvement initiative. We hypothesised that appropriate referrals, which included patients with potential surgical pathology and fulfilled referral criteria, would increase by 25% following referral guideline distribution. Methods A three-phase study was implemented: (1) baseline data were collected from preintervention referrals by noting the reason for consultation and if certain information, deemed relevant for an appropriate referral, was included; (2) a referral guideline, outlining when and how to refer, was distributed to family physicians in the region; and (3) postintervention referrals were collected and analysed as in phase I. Results A total of 404 referrals were collected (161 pre-intervention and 243 post-intervention). A 36% increase in patients who were deemed appropriate surgical candidates was reported post-intervention (p=0.044), with an escalation in the proportion of patients requiring neurosurgeon assessment observed over time. Limited improvements were appreciated in the presence of the criteria indicated for inclusion in a referral document. Conclusion While challenges remain when attempting to modify the referring behaviours of primary care physicians, this research has demonstrated that guidelines aimed at enhancing specialist directed referrals can lead to improvements in their performance. Nonetheless, translating guidelines into practice is a recognised issue, often requiring time and multiple exposures. Active forms of medical education and multifaceted interventions have been demonstrated to be the most effective means of implementing guidelines into practice, an approach that could further address referral inadequacies in the future.

The efficacy of referral guideline distribution in primary care has been promising, but variable. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Improvements were found in primary care providers’ ability to recognise surgically appropriate conditions following referral guideline distribution, while alterations to referral documentation that required active behaviour modification were limited. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY This form of intervention has the capacity to decrease non-surgical candidate referrals and subsequent wait times for those requiring specialist assessment. Introduction Improving access to medical specialists remains a persistent challenge in healthcare. In Canada, wait times have escalated consistently over the past three decades, reaching a further peak following the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to neurosurgical providers is particularly concerning as they report the longest waits across all specialties. In 2022, the time from referral to surgical consultation averaged 46 weeks, with an additional 13-week wait experienced among those requiring treatment. This is a stark contrast to 1993 when the median wait between referral and treatment was only 13 weeks. 1 Among neurosurgical services, delayed access to a spine surgeon continues to be a concern with many providers overrun with referrals. 1 3 4 5 6 Distinguishing what constitutes an appropriate surgical referral among non-urgent spinal conditions presents a challenge faced by referring providers. Studies have demonstrated that anywhere from 30% to 44% of referrals for lumbar spine pain were inappropriate for surgical assessment, with as few as 26% deemed suitable. 7 8 8 In addition to contributing to increased healthcare costs and workloads for medical providers, 6 9 10 2 11 In an effort to alleviate wait times to see a spine surgeon, various efforts have been undertaken to optimise patient management and referral processes. These initiatives include the development of guidelines on back pain management, 12 13 3 10 14 15 16 17 The primary goal of this study was therefore to reduce the volume of unnecessary referrals to the neurosurgical spine assessment clinic via distribution of referral guidelines. We hypothesised that appropriate referrals, including surgical candidates or those fulfilling referral criteria, would increase by 25% following guideline distribution. 16 17 Methods Study design This project is a quality improvement study conducted between July 2020 and August 2021. Funding was acquired to support this work, but had no role in the study design, implementation, interpretation or reporting. No study members had competing interests or conflicts of interest. Participant data was gathered from incoming referrals and subsequent patient assessments performed by clinic nurse practitioners (NPs). The project is designed with three phases in order to test the effectiveness of the intervention. The first phase established baseline referral data, the second developed the education materials and distributed them across the primary care networks in the region and the third repeated the referral data collection to assess for effectiveness of the intervention. Phase I Baseline data from referrals were collected between July 2020 and February 2021. The study’s research coordinator gathered the physicians’ reasons for referral and assessed if certain information, deemed relevant for an appropriate referral, was included. This involved evaluating if referrals referenced symptom onset, traumatic or inciting incidents, functional impairments and neurological exam findings (eg, sensation, motor function, reflexes and straight leg raise (SLR) when appropriate). Following referral to the neurosurgical spine assessment clinic, patients underwent triage through telephone screening by NPs specially trained in evaluating spine patients. Specific questions regarding a patient’s symptoms were assessed to facilitate the NPs in generating an accurate diagnosis and to evaluate the patient’s likelihood of benefiting from surgery. Those deemed appropriate surgical candidates underwent final consultation with a neurosurgeon. Phase II A concise one-page referral guideline ( online supplemental Appendix A 2 8 13 The referral guideline was distributed via a primary care network and provincial health authority to all family physicians in the region between March 2021 and May 2021, sent by email to their officially recorded address. Further, upon referral to the spine centre, a decision letter was returned by the clinic NPs to every physician, which included a copy of the guidelines for the provider’s reference. Phase III Postintervention referrals and clinic NP assessments were collected over a 6-month period (March 2021– August 2021) to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention. Patient and public involvement This study did not require direct patient involvement. Data were drawn from primary care physician referral letters, patient chart review and during routine patient screening by NPs, which is conducted independent of this study. Therefore, patients were not involved in its design. Inter-rater reliability To ensure reliability of the research coordinator’s data collection, an inter-rater reliability audit was completed. A subset of referrals (n=70 or 17%) 18 19 www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0. Assessment of preintervention versus postintervention results was carried out via χ 2 Results Demographics A total of 404 referrals and subsequent NP assessments were collected, comprising 161 pre-intervention (July 2020–February 2021) and 243 post-intervention (March 2021–August 2021). Of the referrals, 176 were male (44%), 220 female (55%) and 6 undisclosed (1%). The average age among all patients was 57 years old. Data were categorised into two time phases: 1–3 months post-intervention (n=165) and 4–6 months post-intervention (n=78). These timeframes were not established a priori in the study design, rather in anticipation of a time lag from the dissemination of the referral guideline to utilisation. 20 21 Surgical candidates Before the intervention, 22% (n=36) of patients referred were identified as potential surgical candidates via NP triage and underwent further assessment by a neurosurgeon. In contrast, during the 6-month postintervention period, 30% (n=73) of those referred were deemed prospective surgical candidates. This revealed a statistically significant increase (p=0.044) in the proportion of patients proceeding to neurosurgeon consultation following the educational intervention at a rate of 36%. In keeping with the hypothesis of delayed uptake, during the initial 0–3 months alone, statistical significance had not yet been achieved (p=0.216). Within this interval, 26% of patients proceeded to further surgical consultation (n=43), representing an 18% increase. Between the 4–6-month timeframe, however, 38% (n=30) of referred patients were considered potential surgical candidates by clinic NPs. This equated to a 73% increase in the proportion of patients deemed appropriate for further surgical assessment (p=0.013). See figure 1 Figure 1 Number and per cent distribution of referrals deemed surgical versus non-surgical candidates pre-intervention vs post-intervention. Time to triage and surgical consultation Prior to the intervention, the average time from receipt of referral to triage was 38 days. Among those identified as potential surgical candidates, the time from referral to surgical consultation averaged 56 days. The time from receipt of referral to NP triage averaged 24 days during the 1–3-month postintervention period, while the time from referral to surgical consultation was 60 days. Between 4 and 6 months post-intervention, the time from receipt of referral to triage averaged 21 days and the time from referral to surgical consultation was 64 days. How to refer Following the intervention, a significant increase was observed among referrals in the inclusion of motor exam findings (p=0.03) and the incorporation of reported functional impairments (p=<0.001) experienced by the patient. However, no change was demonstrated in referral practices when it came to reporting traumatic/inciting incidences. Further, there was no improvement in the inclusion of the neurological exam findings of sensation or reflexes, nor in the performance of an SLR. Among the data recommended for inclusion in a referral letter, they were included in only 21% of referrals cumulatively ( figure 2 Figure 2 Percentage of referrals, including data deemed essential for inclusion in an appropriate referral letter (note that patients in which a finding was deemed not applicable have been removed from this analysis, that is, ‘straight leg raise’ is unnecessary for those diagnosed with a cervical issue). Reasons for referral According to the NP assessments, the distribution of specific diagnoses among all referred patients was as follows: radiculopathy 43% (n=175), back pain 15% (n=61), neurogenic claudication 12% (n=47), myelopathy 5% (n=22), neck pain 5% (n=21), peripheral neuropathy 2% (n=8), spinal instability 2% (n=7), lesion/tumour 0.7% (n=3) and fracture 0.5% (n=2). When comparing NP diagnoses to those listed by the referring physician, an overall agreement of 34% was observed. The diagnosis that referring physicians were most likely to recognise was radiculopathy, demonstrating a 51% agreement compared with clinic NP diagnosis. Other diagnoses showed a much lower level of recognition, as outlined in figure 3 Figure 3 Degree to which a referring physician made the same diagnosis as the spine assessment nurse practitioners. Inter-rater reliability The inter-rater reliability audit yielded an average Cohen’s kappa value of 0.790 for all items evaluated in the referral documents. This falls within the ‘Substantial’ agreement category. Discussion In this study, the guideline for improving incoming referrals to the neurosurgical spine assessment clinic acts as an example of both the improvements that can be made as well as challenges that might be faced when attempting to modify providers’ referring behaviours. Interestingly, both baseline (60%) and postintervention (49%) rates of inappropriate referrals were greater than those reported in prior literature that assessed unnecessary referrals to neurosurgical spine surgeons. 7 8 8 12 13 22 This study’s primary goal of increasing the rate of appropriate surgical referrals by 25% following guidelines distribution was achieved, with a statistically significant improvement of 36% (p=0.044). Along with this change to referral habits, improved screening times were observed. The wait from receipt of referral to initial NP assessment decreased from 38 to 23 days post-intervention, which may have been due to subsequent relief on the clinic triage team. While no improvement was noted in the time from referral to surgeon’s assessment, this is not unexpected due to the extent of surgical backlogs. Notably, the estimated patient wait list for disc surgery/laminectomy in this region is 899 as of 2022. 1 It is possible that factors besides guideline distribution could have contributed to the increased proportion of referred patients deemed appropriate surgical candidates. This study took place over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic where anomalies in patient behaviours and referral patterns have been demonstrated. For example, avoidance of healthcare services by patients contributed to decreased rates of referrals for non-operative degenerative spine conditions in the UK, with likely proportionately more patients with significant, surgical pathology presenting to their family doctor at this time. 23 24 Reassuringly, however, improvements similar to our own have been demonstrated on the distribution of referral guidelines in other fields of medicine prior to the pandemic. Mahalingam experienced a 45% decrease in inappropriate GP referrals to an otolaryngology emergency clinic. 17 et al 25 17 17 22 As anticipated, a lag was observed in this study between the distribution of guidelines and referral behaviour changes. Statistically significant improvements in the referral of appropriate surgical candidates were limited to the 4–6-month postintervention timeframe. This increasing effect over time is in keeping with data that indicates that implementation of guidelines into practice requires time and multiple exposures. 20 21 et al 25 The education guidelines were less successful when it came to augmenting physician reporting behaviours in referral documents. Focal neurological deficit elicited on physical exam is one criterion indicating a patient is an appropriate referral for surgical assessment. 8 13 26 figure 2 When assessing GP’s reason for referral and ability to recognise different surgical diagnoses, certain conditions were much more commonly referred and accurately identified. The conditions outlined in the referral guidelines as appropriate for referral to the spine clinic included radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication, myelopathy, osteomyelitis, fractures, cancer, spinal instability and non-urgent tumour. 2 8 13 10 14 GP diagnoses were compared with clinic NPs under the assumption that the NPs, who are trained to evaluate spine patients on a daily basis, are better equipped to generate an accurate diagnosis. 3 2 8 10 14 Overall, however, the improvements noted in this study demonstrate that educating referring physicians on spine conditions that warrant surgical consultation likely led to the intended decrease in non-surgical referrals. Although prior studies also demonstrated successful improvement in referral behaviours following guideline distribution, 16 17 25 20 21 20 21 27 Finally, it should be noted that lack of familiarity with appropriate surgical conditions is not necessarily the only reason for inappropriate referrals. It has been noted that spine pain patients frequently request aggressive treatment. Resultantly, GPs may refer not due to lack of understanding or knowledge, but rather to appease patients. Therefore, providing GPs with tools to deliver conservative care, while also countering requests for unnecessary aggressive surgery, has been described as a further method to manage patients’ demands for inappropriate care and to alleviate stress on spine surgery services. 22 Limitations As noted, one of the key limitations of this study is that it was performed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is a period where anomalies in patients’ behaviours and referral patterns have been observed. 23 17 25 25 et al t Conclusion Disability related to structures of the spine is common in primary care, making up a significant proportion of pain presentations. 4 6 7 8 20 21 27 Supplementary material 10.1136/bmjoq-2024-002774 online supplemental file 1 Funding: Provenance and peer review: Patient consent for publication: Ethics approval: Patient and public involvement: References 1 Moir M Barua B Waiting Your Turn: Wait Times for Health Care in Canada Fraser Institute 2022 1 86 2 Fourney DR Waiting Lists for Lumbar Spine Referrals in Canada: What is the Solution?
