Nowadays, there are simplified platforms to produce nanocarriers for small-peptide antigen delivery, derived from various infectious agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases, based on virus-like particles (VLPs). They have good cell-penetrating properties and protective action for target molecules from degradation. Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes anogenital warts and six types of cancer in infected women, men, or children, posing a challenge to global public health. The HPV capsid is composed of viral type-specific L1 and evolutionarily conserved L2 proteins. Produced in heterologous systems, the L1 protein can self-assemble into VLPs, nanoparticles sized around 50–60 nm, used as prophylactic vaccines. Devoid of the viral genome, they are safe for users, offering no risk of infection because VLPs do not replicate. The immune response induced by HPV VLPs is promoted by conformational viral epitopes, generating effective T- and B-cell responses. Produced in different cell systems, HPV16 L1 VLPs can be obtained on a large scale for use in mass immunization programs, which are well established nowadays.

Introduction Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a promising biotechnology used in vaccine and drug delivery research, as they are safe, highly immunogenic, and adaptable. VLPs play a key role in addressing HPV-related diseases, both in preventing new infections and as nanocarriers for treating existing tumor cells [ 1 VLPs are impressive tools that can be applied to work with viral structures at the atomic level and have become key tools in studies in several areas, such as biology, medicine, and engineering. Thus, the use of VLPs in the development of antiviral vaccines was a natural path to follow. The success of this application paved the way for the development of other vaccine types and delivery system technologies, utilizing them as nanomachines capable of delivering drug products directly to their specific targets [ 2 2 3 VLPs are multimeric nanostructures composed of viral structural proteins with self-assembling ability. They can be produced through the expression of one or more recombinant viral proteins and measure 0.1–200 nm in diameter [ 3 4 5 5 The eVLPs are nanostructures that mimic native enveloped virions through self-assembly of viral structural proteins but lack viral genetic material. Their morphology—typically icosahedral, spherical, or rod-shaped—is determined by the parental virus’s capsid proteins, with structural complexity ranging from single-protein assemblies to multi-layered structures incorporating matrix proteins and host-derived lipid membranes containing viral glycoproteins [ 6 7 6 7 The characteristics of VLPs, including their nanoscale size, multimeric antigen presentation possibilities, and highly organized repetitive structure, underscore the potential of biotechnology in vaccine generation [ 8 Figure 1 9 10 6 To date, several VLP-based vaccines have received approval for both human and veterinary use, with many other candidates currently in advanced stages of clinical evaluation [ 12 13 14 6 7 15 HPV belongs to Alphapapillomavirus (α-HPV), the primary genus within the Papillomaviridae family implicated in human infections. This genus comprises approximately 65 viral types, which are categorized into low-risk HPV (LR-HPV) and high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) based on their carcinogenic potential [ 1 16 17 16 17 HPV is a small virus characterized by an icosahedral structure with a diameter of approximately 55 nm. Its genetic composition consists of a single, circular double-stranded DNA molecule, which encodes six early regulatory proteins (E) and two late structural proteins (L). While the development of therapeutic vaccines for existing lower genital tract HPV infections remains a significant challenge, remarkable progress has been made in prophylactic vaccination. The L1 structural protein is well-known for its ability to self-assemble into VLPs, which form the basis of current highly effective HPV vaccines [ 18 19 20 19 21 22 23 24 25 HPV virus-like particles emerge through self-assembly of viral components within the infected cell, persisting through their extracellular stage until they are recognized and infect a new host cell. At this point, they cease to exist as their physical integrity is lost, initiating a new infectious cycle [ 16 2. Overview of Basic Concepts 2.1. Virus-like Particle and the Versatility of the Host System of Expression VLPs mimic the structure of viruses but do not contain genetic material, making them safe for humans and veterinary use ( Figure 2 2 8 Escherichia coli 26 27 Lactobacillus casei 1 28 Pichia pastoris 29 30 31 32 Figure 3 Different research groups have explored a diversity of expression systems. For example, Sakauchi et al. (2021) [ 32 32 Lactobacillus casei L. casei 1 28 Spodoptera frugiperda 30 Trichoplusia ni 33 34 Saccharomyces cerevisiae 34 Pichia pastoris 1 29 35 36 Escherichia coli 37 2.2. VLPs as a Platform for Drug Delivery Virus-like particles (VLPs) offer a highly effective drug delivery platform, leveraging their natural ability to penetrate cells—a trait inherited from their viral origins [ 38 39 40 41 42 Figure 4 VLPs can deliver bioactive molecules to modulate gene expression, either activating or inactivating target genes. For instance, Wei and colleagues (2009) demonstrated that RNA encapsulated in MS2 bacteriophage VLPs effectively inhibited hepatitis C virus translation [ 43 42 44 45 Macrobrachium rosenbergii nodavirus 46 In summary, VLPs offer a wide array of applications, presenting numerous advantages as outlined below. 2.2.1. Uses of VLPs Preventive Vaccines: VLPs have been incorporated into vaccines against viruses such as HPV and Hepatitis B, inducing an effective immune response that helps prevent infections. Oncology Therapies: In addition to vaccines, VLPs are being explored as nanocarriers for cancer therapies, allowing targeted delivery of drugs directly to tumor cells. Personalized Vaccines: VLPs’ versatility enables them to be adapted to create personalized vaccines for various pathogens or virus variants, allowing for a rapid response to emerging outbreaks. Delivery Platforms: VLPs can deliver antigens from different pathogens, facilitating the creation of combination vaccines. 2.2.2. Advantages of VLPs Compared to Other Vaccine Approaches Safety: Because VLPs do not contain viral genetic material, they cannot cause infections, making them a safe option for vaccination. Immunogenicity: VLPs are highly immunogenic, inducing a strong and long-lasting immune response with fewer doses than other vaccines. Versatility: The ability to modify VLPs to include different antigens enables their use in a wide range of diseases, from viral infections to cancer. Efficient Production: VLPs can be produced in mammalian cells, such as HEK cell lines, which are ideal for large-scale production and can quickly be adapted to various antigens. Fewer Side Effects: The non-infectious nature of VLPs makes them less likely to cause side effects than the attenuated virus vaccines. 2.3. Structural Basis of HPV Function Examining the structural composition and fundamental architecture of viruses is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which they infect host cells and replicate. The following outlines the main components and characteristics of the HPV. 2.3.1. Basic Structure of HPV I. Capsid: The capsid is a protein coat that surrounds and protects the virus’s genetic material. It is composed of proteins called capsomeres, which are arranged in specific patterns. The shape of the capsid can be icosahedral, helical, cylindrical, or complex, depending on the type of virus. For example, the capsid of HPV is composed of two structural proteins, L1 and L2, which assemble to form an icosahedral structure. The major capsid protein, L1, organizes into 72 pentameric capsomeres, arranged in a T = 7 symmetric lattice ( Figure 5 II. Genetic Material: Viruses contain genetic material, either DNA or RNA, which can be single- or double-stranded. This material allows the virus to hijack host cell machinery, replicate, and produce new viral particles. HPV has a double-stranded DNA genome that encodes proteins for replication and assembly, enabling it to infect and spread within host cells. This genetic diversity is key to viruses’ ability to infect a wide range of hosts and cause disease. HPV is a non-enveloped virus; some viruses have a lipid envelope surrounding the capsid, which is derived from the host cell membrane. This envelope contains viral proteins that facilitate the virus’s adherence to and entry into cells. Enveloped viruses, such as HIV and influenza viruses, are generally more sensitive to disinfectants and environmental conditions. 2.3.2. HPV Mechanisms of Pathogenesis I. Attachment and Entry: Proteins on the surface of the viral capsid bind to specific receptors on the host epithelial cell surface—undifferentiated basal cells of stratified epithelia. The HPV major capsid protein L1 interacts with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) on the cell surface. This binding triggers structural changes in the virus, exposing the minor capsid protein L2 after the L1-HSPG interaction. The exposed L2 protein then interacts with additional cell receptors, such as integrins, facilitating clathrin- or caveolin-mediated endocytosis. This process enables the virus to enter the host cell and initiate infection. II. Replication: Once inside a cell, the virus releases its genetic material and uses the host cell’s machinery to replicate itself. HPV’s replication strategy first establishes a low-copy-number replication phase, during which a limited set of Early E1 E2 III. As infected basal cells begin to differentiate and migrate into the suprabasal layers of the epithelium, an upregulation of viral Early IV. Assembly: Simultaneously with the vegetative replication, the Late V. Release: Finally, the new HPV virions are released from the host cell, completing the viral life cycle and enabling further transmission. In conclusion, the structural basis of viral function and the basic architecture of viruses are fundamental to understanding how these infectious agents operate and replicate. The capsid, composed of proteins, protects the virus’s genetic material and is essential for its replication and infection [ 2 These structures not only define the shape and stability of viruses but also determine their ability to infect cells and spread. The interaction between viral proteins and cellular receptors is crucial for virus adhesion and entry, while replication and assembly depend on the host cellular machinery [ 47 To summarize, viral architecture is a crucial determinant of the efficacy of infection and the pathogenicity of viruses. Understanding these structures and functions is essential for the development of vaccines and antiviral therapies, allowing the creation of effective strategies to combat viral infections and protect public health [ 47 48 3. VLP Vaccines and the Role of Capsid and Other HPV Proteins in Research Cervical cancer is the fourth most prevalent type of cancer among women worldwide, with approximately 600,000 new cases registered in 2020. Data indicates that approximately 90% of the 342,000 deaths recorded from this type of cancer occurred in low-income countries [ 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 The GLOBOCAN 2022 database provides estimates of new cancer cases and deaths worldwide for all cancers combined (ICD-10 codes C00-C97) and for 36 specific cancer types. These include oropharynx, anus, vulva, vagina, cervix uteri, penile, and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC; ICD-10 code C44, excluding basal-cell carcinomas) [ 57 58 Currently, the primary method of preventing cervical cancer is through periodic cytological exams, Pap smear tests, and prophylactic vaccination of pre-adolescent girls and boys. In Brazil, the prophylactic vaccine Gardasil ® 59 60 The vaccines can be used by people who are undergoing treatment or have already had an HPV infection, as they can protect against other types of HPV and prevent the formation of new genital warts and the risk of cancer [ 61 ® Table 1 62 63 64 64 65 Nevertheless, other options have been studied, such as a 9-valent HPV vaccine in development by Shanghai Bovax, which targets the same HPV types as 9-Gardasil ® ® 66 ® 30 3.1. Chimeras Designed for New HPV Vaccines VLPs were recognized as a new generation of prophylactic vaccines against viral infections two decades ago. Today, they serve as the foundation for both prophylactic nanovaccines and therapeutic drug nanocarriers, which are often constructed as multivalent chimeric VLPs (chi-VLPs) through genetic modifications or chemical conjugation. Continuous advancements in genetic engineering have expanded the strategies available for developing multivalent chi-VLP vaccines. This section highlights studies focused on chimeric capsid VLPs and chimeric enveloped VLPs, discussing the advantages and limitations of each approach [ 67 Key requirements for designing multivalent chi-VLP vaccines include the following: Surface-exposed antigens must be incorporated without compromising the structural stability of the chi-VLPs. The chi-VLPs should induce protective antibodies against both the displayed antigen and the source virus of the VLPs. Notably, antigenicity is not a prerequisite for VLPs that function solely as carriers for antigen display or drug delivery [ 67 Currently, three licensed vaccines are based on the mixture of L1 VLPs from two, four, or nine different HR-HPVs [ 68 15 15 The minor capsid protein L2 harbors highly conserved, HPV-neutralizing epitopes that are shared across multiple high-risk HPV types [ 69 15 6 Personalized cancer immunotherapies, combined with nanotechnology (nanovaccines), are revolutionizing treatment strategies for HPV-related cancers, complementing advancements in chi-HPV vaccine studies. Chi-HPV vaccines, designed to incorporate L1 and L2 epitopes from multiple HPV types, aim to broaden the protective immune response and prevent a broader range of HPV infections [ 13 15 6 Nanotechnology plays a pivotal role in both approaches. In chi-HPV vaccines, nanoparticles enhance the stability and immunogenicity of VLPs, improving their ability to elicit broad and durable immune responses. Similarly, in personalized cancer vaccines, nanocarriers such as polymeric nanoparticles and high-density lipoprotein-mimicking nano-discs facilitate efficient delivery of tumor-specific antigens, boosting immune activation and precision in targeting HPV-related malignancies [ 70 Recent preclinical studies have highlighted the potential of chi-L1/L2 VLPs to provide cross-protection against diverse HPV types, extending beyond those targeted by current prophylactic vaccines. Personalized cancer nanovaccines build on this progress by addressing therapeutic gaps and enabling the treatment of HPV-related cancers, such as cervical and oropharyngeal cancers. Additionally, integrating proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) with nanotechnology offers a novel approach to selectively degrade oncogenic HPV proteins, enhancing treatment efficacy. The synergy between chi-HPV vaccines, personalized nanovaccines, and advanced technologies like PROTACs presents a comprehensive strategy to combat HPV-related diseases, overcoming challenges in nanocarrier optimization and safety to provide innovative solutions for both prevention and treatment [ 71 3.2. Some Examples of Chi-VLP Applications Qi et al. (2022) [ 72 72 Zhou and Zhang (2023) [ 73 Pichia pastoris Figure 5 22 Notably, it did not interfere with the immunogenicity of Ag85B. The chi-HPV16L1/Ag85B VLPs were observed to induce higher Ag85B-specific antibody responses and elicit significant Ag85B-specific T cell immune responses in female C57BL/6 mice compared with recombinant Ag85B. These findings provide new insights into the development of novel chi-HPV16L1/TB VLP-based vaccine platforms for controlling TB infection, which are urgently required in low-income and developing countries [ 73 Chen et al. (2022) [ 74 Notably, it did not interfere either with the HIV-1 antibody reactivity targeting sequential and conformational P18I10 and T20 peptides presented on chi-HPV:HIV VLPs or with the induction of HPV16 L1-specific antibodies in vivo. It was possible to observe that chi-L1:P18I10/L1:T20 VLPs vaccines could induce HPV16- but weak HIV-1-specific antibody responses and elicited HPV16- and HIV-1-specific T-cell responses in BALB/c mice [ 74 Moreover, an additional dose of the immunizing agent could be a potential booster, increasing or renewing the effect of the earlier dose, thereby enhancing HIV-specific cellular responses in the heterologous immunization after priming with the rBCG HIV vaccine. This research work would contribute a step towards the development of the novel chi-HPV:HIV VLP-based vaccine platform for controlling HPV16 and HIV-1 infection, which is urgently needed in developing and industrialized countries [ 74 Chen et al. (2023) [ 75 Chi-L1:P18I10 VLPs purified from both methods were capable of self-assembling into integral particles and shared similar biophysical and morphological properties. After BALB/c mice immunization with 293F cell-derived and chromatography-purified L1:P18I10 VLPs, almost the exact titer of anti-L1 IgG ( p p p 75 Adjusting the effective and safe dose for HPV chi-VLPs is crucial. Administering a higher dose of HPV chi-VLPs can lead to two possible outcomes: while it may trigger a more robust immune response, it risks intensifying adverse immunological effects [ 67 76 77 62 66 78 79 To mitigate these potential adverse effects, a multifaceted strategy is needed. Rigorous preclinical and dose-escalation clinical trials are crucial to determining the optimal VLP dose that balances strong immunogenicity with minimal reactogenicity. The development of advanced adjuvant systems that precisely modulate the immune response, rather than simply amplifying it, could allow for lower effective VLP doses. This could involve adjuvants that selectively promote desired immune pathways or increase the efficiency of antigen presentation. Furthermore, optimizing the design of the chi-VLPs themselves so that they are more efficiently recognized and processed by immune cells could reduce the required amount of antigen. Ultimately, the goal is to achieve maximal protective immunity with the lowest possible VLP dose, ensuring high efficacy and an excellent safety profile, while continuously monitoring for any unanticipated adverse events through robust post-marketing surveillance. 3.3. Further Applications of VLPs in Drug Delivery The immunogenic features of VLP nanoparticles make them attractive for further exploration of their potential abilities, particularly in drug delivery and gene therapy. Beyond transporting peptides/proteins or other active molecules on the surface of the VLPs, they can bind proteins, nucleic acids, or other small molecules. Consequently, they can be used to deliver molecules to specific cells, tissues, or organs [ 6 The VLPs’ uptake by the cells occurs via receptor-mediated endocytosis through the plasma membrane that surrounds VLPs, internalizing them into the cell as a vesicle. So, after the vesicles detach from the membrane, they arrive in the cytosol. Then, vesicles are moved along the cytoskeleton for association with the primary endosomes. Sometimes, the endosomal vesicles separate from the primary endosome, grow up as the final endosome, and fuse with the pre-lysosomal vesicles containing acidic hydrolase to form lysosomes. The unknown materials are disintegrated inside the lysosomes and made available to the cells. Nevertheless, lysosomal degradation is also a problem because it prevents proper drug delivery, due to about 40% of newly produced drugs being disapproved as a result of poor bioavailability [ 6 The use of drug nanocarriers is an advantageous strategy to solve this limitation. Until now, several specific sites, e.g., tumor tissues, have reduced the required dose of the drug and improved treatment results. Interestingly, some VLPs present a natural tropism toward a particular tissue, due to the virus from which they originated. For example, HBV naturally infects the liver so that HBV-derived VLPs can target liver cells. In the same way, rotaviruses have a special attraction for the intestine, and their derived VLPs can be used for drug delivery to the intestinal tissue [ 6 VLPs are preferably taken up by tumor cells due to their ability to be engineered with receptor-binding domains on their surface. These domains, which can be chemically or genetically attached, allow VLPs to selectively bind to specific receptors highly expressed on cancer cells, thus enhancing the targeted delivery of drugs and improving therapeutic effects [ 80 81 82 More specific targeting is typically achieved by arranging the receptor-binding domain on the VLP surface. Target domains can be chemically or genetically attached to the surface of VLPs, allowing the VLPs to selectively bind to cancer cells expressing a specific receptor, enhancing the therapeutic effects of drugs [ 83 83 Table 2 Table 3 VLPs elicit strong immune responses across different immune cell subsets. They are readily recognized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) like dendritic cells, leading to their maturation and subsequent activation of T helper (CD4+) and cytotoxic T (CD8+) lymphocytes [ 118 80 119 118 119 3.4. Other Applications Based on HPV Proteins Despite the availability of prophylactic vaccines, HPV infections remain highly prevalent worldwide [ 120 121 122 22 E6 E7 123 124 125 Proteins such as L2 and E6 can be utilized as promising tools in the development of DNA vaccines, being expressed directly inside cells as recombinant proteins that combine regulatory and coding sequences, thereby eliciting both humoral and cellular immune responses. It has been demonstrated that the L2 protein induces humoral action leading to the production of anti-L2 antibodies with evident prophylactic action, while the E6 protein promotes the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) with high prevalence against malignant cells, generating the possibility of anticancer therapeutic action [ 126 127 The VLP structural proteins may contain several epitopes that are searchable by molecular modeling and in silico assays, identifying high-level immune stimulation peptide sequences [ 128 129 130 131 132 32 132 Zhai et al. (2017) [ 105 105 133 Research into peptide-based vaccines against HPV seeks applied peptide epitopes from structural proteins L1 and L2, as well as the oncoproteins E6 and E7, which are involved in HPV carcinogenesis by interfering with cell cycle control and interacting with regulatory proteins. E6 interacts with the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A, known as E6AP, forming a complex responsible for the degradation of tumor protein p53, resulting in the loss of the cell cycle checkpoint and evading apoptosis [ 134 128 135 136 Both DNA and peptide vaccine platforms, as well as VLP technology, have benefited from bioinformatic studies. Computational techniques, including Computer-Aided Design and Drafting (CADD) and in silico assays, are essential tools in HPV vaccine development. The main advantage of CADD is that it allows modeled ideas to be explored before physical prototyping is implemented. CADD streamlines the design of multiepitope constructs by predicting interactions between HPV antigens (e.g., L1, L2, E6, and E7) and immune receptors, while in silico assays simulate immunogenicity, toxicity, and structural stability. These methods reduce costs and accelerate candidate selection. However, their reliance on simplified models and incomplete databases requires experimental validation to confirm predictions [ 137 138 Diverse treatments have already been tested to combat HPV-associated diseases, including the use of therapeutic vaccines developed on different platforms, such as attenuated vectors (viral or bacterial), peptide/protein vaccines, and even cell-based vaccines [ 133 139 140 141 139 76 142 143 144 145 141 146 147 At this point, immunoinformatic tools can assist scientists in predicting high-immunogenic and conserved epitopes that induce B- or T-cell responses against HPV infection. The heat shock proteins (HSPs) are promising adjuvants able to stimulate innate and adaptive immunity, making the linkage of antigens to HSPs a promising strategy to increase the efficiency of vaccine candidates [ 141 147 146 While computational approaches cannot fully replace experimental testing, they provide a robust framework to enhance the efficiency and precision of HPV vaccine development, bridging gaps between design and real-world application, as well as accelerating the research steps [ 137 138 148 4. A Brief Overview of Methods for Studying Viral Particles The detailed analysis of viral structure and physical properties depends on a range of advanced scientific techniques [ 149 150 Figure 6 151 152 153 Figure 5 152 153 The integration of genomics and proteomics has significantly advanced viral characterization. Genetic sequencing provides essential information on viral genome organization and encoded proteins, while proteomic analysis is fundamental for identifying and quantifying viral proteins. A key application of proteomics is the functional analysis of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) between viral and host cell components. Understanding these PPIs is vital, as they govern critical aspects of the viral life cycle, immune evasion, and manipulation of host cellular processes, ultimately influencing viral pathogenicity [ 154 149 150 5. Conclusions and Future Directions Based on significant advances in nanotechnology and protein engineering, chimeric L1/L2 HPV-based VLPs (chi-L1/L2 VLPs) represent a highly promising and versatile platform for both innovative vaccines and advanced nanocarriers. Given their self-assembling nature and the absence of viral genetic material, these nanoparticles offer an inherently safe and highly immunogenic approach to combating diverse pathogens. The ability of chi-L1/L2 VLPs to competently and recurrently present multivalent antigens is a key advantage, facilitating targeted delivery that can induce robust and long-lasting immune responses. This transformation highlights a shift in perspective, where viruses, once viewed solely as threats, now serve as templates for powerful biomedical tools. Chi-L1/L2 VLPs enable the construction of precise nanostructured arrays, which can be manipulated through the insertion of various epitopes. This allows for the creation of customized polyvalent antigenic nanoparticles to address diverse public health needs. Furthermore, the ability of VLPs to escape endosomes before lysosomal degradation significantly enhances their efficacy as delivery vehicles. Overall, VLPs offer a compelling set of properties that make them highly advantageous as drug delivery systems. These properties include allowing chemical modifications and drug insertion into their cavity, high immunogenicity, in vivo persistence, safety, and efficient delivery. They are also highly effective at low doses and demonstrate favorable stability under refrigeration, along with a high manufacturing safety profile. Although their production speed cannot yet rival that of mRNA or viral vector vaccines, the proven benefits of VLP technology are undeniable. In the global effort to prepare for future pandemics, a multiplatform strategy is crucial. This involves continued investment in and integration of diverse platforms, such as mRNA vaccines, viral vector-based vaccines, peptide vaccines, traditional VLPs, and potent chimeric VLPs, like chi-L1/L2 VLPs. This comprehensive approach, backed by international collaboration in vaccine development and distribution, is essential for strengthening global health systems and mitigating the severe social and economic impacts of emerging infectious diseases.

Dendritic cells take up VLPs and present their antigens via MHC-I and MHC-II, stimulating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. CD8+ T cells differentiate into cytotoxic effectors and memory cells, providing long-term cellular immunity. Simultaneously, VLPs directly cross-link B cell receptors and, with CD4+ T helper cells (Th), drive plasma cell antibody production and memory B cell formation. This dual response ensures robust, long-lasting protection (VLP AI model by Nierengarten, 2025 [ 11 Figure 2 The difference between HPV virus-like particles (VLPs) and the HPV virus is significant. L1 is a structural protein capable of forming organized structures, grouping into 72 pentamers. The second structural protein of HPV is L2, which cannot self-assemble independently. However, L2 can co-assemble with L1, stabilizing L1 pentamers and enabling the formation of chimeric HPVL1/L2 VLPs. The HPV viral particle consists of a structural capsid formed by L1 and L2 proteins, encapsulating the viral genome. Figure 3 Schematic steps to obtain VLP: First, the target gene can be inserted into an expression vector, and subsequently, the modified vector can be introduced into a host cell. The protein should then be expressed using the chosen host cell platform. Following the expression, the cell products should be processed, followed by VLP maturation and purification (VLP AI model by Nierengarten, 2025 [ 11 Figure 4 Schematic approaches to VLPs as nanocarriers for various molecules and drugs.
