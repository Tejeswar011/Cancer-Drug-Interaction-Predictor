Research on plants has demonstrated that terpenoid compounds can resist pest infestation and enhance plant resistance ( Pétriacq et al., 2017a Huang et al., 2019 Zhong et al., 2022 Sugiyama et al., 2016 Bouwmeester et al., 2025 Xu et al., 2023 Pleurotus ostreatus Actinobacteria Firmicutes Suarez et al., 2020 Stropharia rugosoannulata Mortierella Cladosporium Tang et al., 2022 Morchella Chloroflexi Tan et al., 2021 Ganoderma lucidum Ren et al., 2020a Chang et al., 2018 Unlike typical mushrooms or polypores, the medicinal part of P. cocos Lin et al., 2022 Zhiyong et al., 2024 Li et al., 2021 Zhang et al., 2023 Jia et al., 2025 P. cocos By integrating high-throughput sequencing with high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS), this study systematically characterizes the structural features of the P. cocos P. cocos 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Cultivation of Poria cocos The present study was conducted at the Chinese Medicine Resources Experimental Base of the Hunan Academy of Chinese Medicine, Changsha, Hunan Province, China (N 28°12′09.10″, E 112°45′03.05″). P. cocos P. cocos 2.2 Harvesting of samples After 9 months of cultivation, sampling was conducted by carefully excavating the topsoil to collect mature P. cocos P. cocos P. cocos Figure 1 Figure 1 Schematic diagram of sampling locations in Poria cocos (A) Poria cocos (B) (C) (D) (E) Diagram illustrating a sequence for preparing soil additives.

For bacterial 16S rRNA amplification, the primers 341F (CCTAYGGGRBGCASCAG) and 806R (GGACTACNNGGGTATCTAAT) ( Ferreira et al., 2024 Bukavina et al., 2022 2.4 Bioinformatics analysis The QIIME 2 software platform was used to process the data obtained from Illumina HiSeq amplicon sequencing. Briefly, the reads were processed and applied to DADA2 pipeline for the assignment of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Before application to DADA2, the fungal sequences were trimmed by the plugin of ITSxpress. The DADA2 workflow includes filtering, dereplication, chimera identification, and merging of the paired-end sequences. Taxonomic assignment of the ASVs was performed using the SILVA 128 database for bacteria and the UNITE database for fungi. The RDP Classifier algorithm was employed for sequence alignment analysis. To assess sequencing depth sufficiency and sampling completeness, Good’s coverage estimator was computed. Alpha diversity metrics (including observed ASVs, Shannon index, and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity) and beta diversity analyses (using UniFrac distances) were subsequently calculated to evaluate within-sample and between-sample microbial diversity patterns, respectively. Beta diversity was visualized by principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). In order to further explore the differences in microbial community structure among different groups, partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) was applied. 2.5 Extraction and HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS analysis of pachymic acid The collected samples were placed in a constant-temperature drying oven and continuously dried at 55°C until reaching constant weight, then ground into uniformly-sized powder. Precisely 1.00 ± 0.01 g of the powdered sample was weighed and mixed with 5 mL of methanol for ultrasound-assisted extraction. The extraction process was conducted in an ultrasonic bath with 220 W power and 50 kHz frequency for 15 min. After allowing the extract to stand for 20 min, the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 μm organic phase microporous membrane. Chromatographic analysis was performed using HPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Acetonitrile and pure water were used as mobile phases A and B, respectively. The injection volume was 10 μL with a solvent flow rate of 1 mL/min, using an InterSustain C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, GL Sciences Inc., Tokyo, Japan) maintained at 20°C. The solvent gradient program was set as follows:0–10 min: 51% A; 10–15 min: 51–86% A; 15–25 min: 86–100% A; 25–35 min: 100% A; 35–40 min: 100–51% A; 40–50 min: 51% A. Mass spectrometry conditions employed negative ion mode with a scan range of m/z 100–1,500. 2.6 Statistical analysis The quantitative determination of pachymic acid was done in six repetitions and expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Differences among groups were analyzed statistically using one-way analysis of variance. Statistical analyses of different samples were performed using the Origin statistical software. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was utilized to analyze the correlation. p 3 Results 3.1 Microbial community composition This study conducted a systematic taxonomic analysis of microbial communities across five sample groups. A total of 39 bacterial phyla and 820 genera were identified, along with 16 fungal phyla and 587 genera. Significant differences were observed in the relative abundance of various taxonomic units among sample groups, with their phylogenetic relationships illustrated in Figure 2a Figure 2b Figure 2 Phylogenetic trees of fungal (a) (b) (c) (d) Poria cocos Circular phylogenetic trees and Venn diagrams compare bacteria and fungi. Image a shows the bacterial tree with colored phylum labels, indicating sample variations. Image b depicts the fungal tree similarly. Image c's Venn diagram presents overlap and uniqueness among bacterial groups A to D. Image d's Venn diagram illustrates the same concept for fungal groups. Both diagrams use color coding for clarity. High-throughput sequencing yielded 17,578 high-quality ASVs. Among these, bacterial ASVs accounted for 13,175 (75.0%), while fungal ASVs comprised 4,403 (25.0%). Microbial community analysis revealed that the core bacterial and fungal ASVs shared across all samples numbered only 75 and 64, respectively ( Figures 2c d Microbial composition analysis across sample groups revealed that P. cocos Figures 2c d P. cocos 3.2 Beta diversity analysis of microbial community Multivariate statistical analysis revealed significant differences in microbial communities among sample groups. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis distance showed that the first two axes (PCoA1 and PCoA2) of bacterial communities cumulatively explained 31.79% of the total variance (PCoA1: 20.66%; PCoA2: 8.61%), while those of fungal communities explained 29.65% (PCoA1: 21.36%; PCoA2: 8.29%). The analysis demonstrated that P. cocos Figures 3a b Figures 3c d P. cocos Figure 3 Multivariate analysis of microbial beta diversity.
