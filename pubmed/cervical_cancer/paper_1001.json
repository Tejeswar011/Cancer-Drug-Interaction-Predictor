By contrast, βIVa-tubulin\nexpression exerted opposite effects\non cell motility.

Previously established cell lines were categorized\ninto two cohorts: low grade (cells isolated from patients with stage\nI and II disease) and high grade (cells isolated from patients with\nstage III and IV disease; Figure Table S1 Figure 5 Effects of 1 1a–c 1 1a–c n n p p Next, whether the effects\nof inhibiting invasion\nwere due to the\nmodulation of β-tubulin subunit levels in cells treated with\ntaxane derivatives was investigated. Microtubules rich in βIII-tubulin\nand poor in βIVa-tubulin were hypothesized to play a critical\nrole in the regulation of 1b 1c Thus, the decision was made\nto modulate the levels of the tubulin\nsubunits. Initially, the effects of taxane analogs in βIII-tubulin-overexpressing\ncolon cancer cells were studied.

On the contrary,\nonly agents that achieve an adequate intracellular concentration can\nexert biological effects. Therefore, whether modifications of the\ncore taxane structure influenced the recognition of novel molecules\nby major membrane transport systems was investigated. As paclitaxel\nand docetaxel are known substrates of ABCB1 (also known as P-gp, an\nMDR protein that is a major constituent of blood–organ barriers), Figure S7 N Conclusions In\nsummary, the novel paclitaxel analogs 1b 1c 1b 1c 1b 1c Experimental Section General  1 13 1 1 13 1 13 3 1 13 d 6 1 13 4 10 –1 1a 4a 6a 1a c Synthesis Ruthenocenecarbonyl\nChloride 2b 505 mg\n(340 μL, 4.0 mmol) of oxalyl chloride followed by 1 drop of\nDMF were added to a slurry of 500 mg (2.0 mmol) ruthenocenecarboxylic\nacid in 10 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane.

LS180 cells originate from a primary\ncolon adenocarcinoma and correspond to stage II disease, whereas HCT116\ncells were also derived from a primary tumor but classified as stage\nIII. SW620 cells were established from a lymph node and represent\na stage III tumor. Finally, LoVo cells were isolated from a liver\nmetastasis and represent stage IV colorectal cancer. CCD841 CoN is\nan adherent cell line isolated from the colon tissue of a healthy\ndonor. The multidrug-resistant SW620 V cell line was derived from\nparental SW620 cells as described previously. 2 Mycoplasma\nsp. Patient Cohort Tissue specimens\nfrom 9 patients with\ncolorectal cancer were obtained from CRC surgery at the Norbert Barlicki\nMemorial Teaching Hospital No. 1 of the Medical University of Lodz,\nLodz, Poland, between June 2023 and September 2023. For immunohistochemical\nstaining, the tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin\nand embedded in paraffin. The specific clinicopathological data of\nthe patients are presented in Table S1 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Immunohistochemical reactions\nwere performed on 4 μm paraffin sections obtained from TMA blocks\nmounted on Superfrost Plus slides (Menzel Gläser, Braunschweig,\nGermany). The sections were dewaxed and rehydrated, and the epitopes\nwere exposed using a Pre-Treatment Link Rinse Station and Target Retrieval\nSolution (pH 6 for K i Colon Cancer Cell Line Isolation from Patient Tissue The\naseptic solid cancer fragments obtained from inside the tumor\ntissue were excised carefully to avoid blood vessels and fatty acid\nelements and, after rapid transport, transferred to DMEM supplemented\nwith penicillin (500 U/mL) and streptomycin (300 μg/mL) to prevent\nbacterial contamination with heparin (5 μg/mL). Next, the tumor\ntissue was placed in sterile PBS and carefully rinsed. Then, the necrotic\nareas, fatty tissue, and blood clots were removed with sterile scissors\nand forceps. The obtained tissue was minced with scissors and vigorously\npipetted with 10 mL of PBS. After heavier pieces sedimentation, the\naggregates were harvested, transferred into a 15 mL sterile tube,\nand centrifuged (400 g 2 2 2 Spheroid Culture Colon cancer 3D spheroids were formed\nusing Greiner Bio-One’s Magnetic 3D Cell Culture Technology\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells\nwere grown to 80% confluence and labeled with NanoShuttle-PL (Greiner,\nBio-One) overnight in a 6-well plate. Then, 30,000 cells were seeded\ninto 96-well cell-repellent Greiner Bio-One flat-bottom plates and\nplaced on a magnetic drive for 30 min. Next, the spheroids were treated\nwith compounds or vehicle (1 μM or 0.25% DMSO), followed by\nincubation for 72 h to form 3D structures. The medium was replaced\nwith fresh medium every 72 h until the end of the experiment (8 days).\nThe spheroids were visualized each day using a light inverted Nikon\nD-Eclipse Ti microscope (4× objective) with Nikon NIS-Elements\nand analyzed using ImageJ software v. 1.53a. Interference RNA A mixed set of four siRNAs targeting\nhuman TUBB4 and a negative control siRNA (scramble) were employed\n(Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). The concentration of siRNA used was previously\ndescribed. Transient Plasmid Transfection An expression vector\ncontaining TUBB3 Viability Assay The sensitivity\nof colon cancer cell\nlines to new paclitaxel analogues was determined using the Sulforhodamine\nB assay as described previously. 50 Cell Cycle Analysis Exponentially growing cells (1,00,000\ncells/well seeded in 6-well plates 24 h before time 0) were treated\nwith the IC 90 1 Reactive Oxygen\nSpecies Production The dihydrorhodamine\n123 (DHR123) oxidation assay was performed as described previously. UIC2 Binding\nAssay A total of 1,00,000 parental SW620\ncells expressing low levels of ABC proteins or their MDR variant SW620\nV cells overexpressing ABCB1 g Microtubule Isolation and Polymerization Tubulin polymerization\nassay was performed using crude tubulin extracts isolated from drug-treated\ncancer cells to assess compound-induced changes in tubulin assembly\nin a cell-dependent context. Microtubule proteins were isolated from\nparticular colon cancer cell lines as described previously. 2 Western Blot Analysis Cell lysates and Western blotting\nwere performed as described previously. Transwell Invasion Assay The invasion assay was performed\nas described previously with modifications. 2 MMP-7 ELISA MMP-7 secretion was analyzed with a Human\nTotal MMP-7 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN)\naccording to the manufacturer’s protocol. The optical density\nwas measured at 450 nm using an Infinite F50 microplate reader (Tecan,\nGroding, Austria). The MMP-7 level is presented as ng of MMP-7 secreted\nby 1 million cells. Fluorescence Microscopy A total\nof 5000 cells/ml were\ngrown on sterile glass microscope slides at 37 °C in a humidified\natmosphere of 5% CO 2 2 Statistical Analysis All the data were analyzed using\nGraphPad Prism version 9.1 software (GraphPad, Inc., San Diego, CA).\nThe data are shown as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of at\nleast three independent experiments. The statistical significance\nof the differences was assessed by one-way or two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s\npost hoc test, assuming 0.05 as the significance level.
