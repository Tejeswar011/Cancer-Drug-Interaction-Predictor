Intelligent exercise systems using IoT, big data, and AI offer real-time monitoring, improved safety, interactive engagement, and remote supervision marking a shift from traditional models and promoting self-managed health in older adults. Purpose To investigate how Intelligent exercise influence older adults’ digital resilience and adaptation, by integrating quantitative outcome measures with qualitative insights into their real-world experiences. Methods This mixed-methods study recruited participants via purposive sampling from a senior fitness club. Participants completed a quantitative questionnaire and a one-to-one qualitative interview to discuss their experiences and adjustment processes when engaging in intelligent exercise. Results A total of 69 participants were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group completed at least six months of an introductory smart sports equipment course. Data were collected via questionnaire, and 16 participants took part in interviews. Resilience scores in the intervention group increased significantly from 21.35 ± 4.37 at baseline to 23.35 ± 5.4 after six months ( P Conclusion Intelligent exercise program can strengthen older adults’ digital resilience and promote healthy aging.

Factors such as the equipment's complexity, learning level, and suitability, as well as the user's technology acceptance, can influence exercise maintenance and performance. Although advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have opened possibilities for personalized health management. However, current research has focused on the benefits of intelligent exercise systems, with less attention given to structural barriers—such as limited digital literacy, financial constraints, and privacy concerns—that affect adoption among older adults. Further research is needed to explore the outcomes of smart sports technology use in this population to better address broader issues of equity and inclusiveness in digital health. This study adopts a mixed-methods design to evaluate the impact of smart sports equipment on the Digital resilience of older adults and to qualitatively explore their lived experiences with intervention. Of particular importance is the concept of digital resilience—the capacity to adapt and thrive in digital environments—which aligns with theoretical models such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).  12  12 Intelligent exercise and health promotion Recent advancements in digital health have facilitated the integration of intelligent exercise technologies, such as smart sports equipment and AI-driven platforms into physical activity and health promotion strategies. Intelligent exercises typically combine interactive interfaces, virtual training environments, and gamified components to enhance user engagement and exercise adherence.  13  11  9 7 11 Several studies have highlighted the benefits of intelligent exercise systems, including improved health self-management through real-time feedback, enhanced motivation via gamified experiences, and remote support for users by healthcare professionals and caregivers. 6 14 7 11  15 Prior research has also noted that older adults often struggle to maintain physical activity using conventional equipment due to factors such as limited motivation, lack of feedback, and perceived monotony.  16  17  18 Intelligent exercises and digital resilience Digital resilience is an individual's or organization's ability to adapt to and address challenges in shifting digital environments. It entails the adaptive use of digital tools, psychological acceptance of technological changes, and data-driven health management competence. As the use of smart sports equipment increases, digital resilience is critical for health promotion in older adults, as it enhances older adults’ exercise adaptation, health awareness, and digital engagement. 19 21  22 23 24  25  24 The interactions and real-time feedback from smart sports equipment can enhance exercise motivation, reduce sedentary behavior, and foster global physical functioning. 26 27  28  29 27 30  13 Methods Study design The mixed-methods design to enhance data complementarity and research depth by integrating quantitative user data with qualitative feedback. Methodological triangulation was employed to combine both data sources, using qualitative themes to interpret and enrich the quantitative findings. This approach strengthened the interpretive depth and practical relevance of the study outcomes. 31 32 Figure 1 Figure 1. Research flowchart. The quantitative component employed a quasi-experimental design, with participants assigned to the control and intervention groups based on their affiliated units. The control group continued with their daily conventional exercise routine, while the intervention group received a weekly intelligent exercise program in addition to their conventional exercise routine. The changes in the participants’ mental resilience after engaging in intelligent exercise were assessed through a pre- and post-test. The second phase involved qualitative research, in which in-depth individual interviews were conducted with the participants to explore their multifaceted experiences with intelligent exercise. The interview data were primarily analyzed using a phenomenological approach, with content analysis applied as a complementary method. This process involved both coding frequency analysis and narrative synthesis. To ensure coding consistency and credibility, a double-coding the essence and core meaning of lived human experiences by emphasizing the subjective perceptions and feelings of the participants.  32 While grounded in the philosophical foundation of phenomenology, content analysis was applied as a complementary method to support the analysis by systematically and objectively organizing the data, identifying recurring themes or concepts, and constructing essential experiential structures and conceptual models. Coding frequency analysis was also conducted to quantify the data, and narrative interpretations were generated to further illustrate participants’ lived experiences. Participants The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age ≥65 years, (2) Participants who completed at least three months of an intelligent exercise course during the study period, Chang et al.,  33  34  35 α  36  37 Intervention The intervention was developed through an expert review process. It was collaboratively designed by two doctoral candidates in nursing and four certified Level 2 fitness instructors. After the initial design, content validity was evaluated by four experts, including two professors of gerontology, one professor of rehabilitation medicine, and one practicing rehabilitation physician. The resulting Content Validity Index (CVI) was 0.92, which exceeds the acceptable threshold of 0.80, indicating high content validity.  38 Table 1 Table 1. Design of the exercise intervention. Duration Exercise Content Category/function 15 minutes Warm-up Stretching exercises combined with low-impact aerobic exercises, such as running in place, step touch, knee lift, and rhythmic upper-limb movements.

It is certified by the US FDA and EU TÜV, meeting international medical device safety and performance standards. SMARC incorporates AI-powered precision assessments to deliver customized exercise prescriptions tailored to each user's physiological parameters and health condition. Through high-end sensors, it continuously captures real-time data on muscle strength, joint angles, and movement patterns, providing immediate visual feedback to guide posture correction and improve training accuracy. Training intensity, frequency, and content are automatically adjusted by AI or manually fine-tuned by professionals to optimize outcomes. All training sessions are uploaded to a cloud platform, enabling healthcare providers or exercise specialists to monitor and analyze progress in real time. SMARC has been effectively applied to post-orthopedic surgery patients, older adults with sarcopenia, and elderly individuals requiring functional restoration or preventive decline management, demonstrating proven benefits in both clinical and long-term care settings.  39 Table 1 Measurement tools In the first phase, quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire. The collected demographic data included age, sex, employment status, education, marital status, smoking status and drinking status. The participants’ resilience levels were assessed using the Chinese version of the Resilience Scale (CRS),  40  41  42 α In the second phase of the study, all interview questions were specifically designed for participants in the intervention group, as the primary objective was to explore their experiences, perceptions, and responses to the digital health intervention. Since the control group did not receive the intervention, therefore not included in the interview process. Researchers created a semi-structured interview outline, based on the relevant literature and suggestions from field experts, to collect the qualitative data. The interview questions were as follows: (1) How did participating in the smart sports equipment intervention influence your physical activity level? (2) How did participating in the intervention influence or change your cognitive status (i.e., mood and memory)? (3) How did participating in the intervention influence your general purpose in life (i.e. psychological well-being and attitude toward life)? (4) Do you have any suggestions regarding the use of smart sports equipment? Data collection and statistical analysis The quantitative data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software. The demographic data are described using numbers (percentages) and means (standard deviations). The mean resilience scores and pretest-posttest differences were compared between groups, using paired sample t A single trained interviewer conducted all interviews to ensure consistency when collecting the qualitative data. The interviews were conducted in quiet settings based on participants’ preferences. They were audio recorded and transcribed within 24 hours. Data saturation was determined through an iterative process of coding and thematic analysis. After each set of 3 interviews, the research team evaluated whether new categories or themes were emerging. Recruitment continued until no additional themes were identified in consecutive interviews, at which point data saturation was considered achieved. The data were organized and analyzed using MAXQDA software. Its various automated functions, such as content search, data visualization, sorting and coding, data linking, and data mapping, replace manual reviews that require multiple readings. We followed Colaizzi's  43 Each step in the process is as follows: (1) Generating data or datasets: The interview text was transcribed, and the transcript was checked for missing or unclear data. If missing or unclear data were present, the participant was re-interviewed to verify the content's accuracy. All data were anonymized to ensure participant confidentiality. (2) Coding: Open coding was performed on the transcript to preliminarily name and categorize smaller chunks of data. (3) Categorizing: The preliminarily coded data were further categorized to establish meaningful connections with the theme structure. (4) Forming a core concept: The data analysis results were systematized to form a core concept. (5) Integrating and describing the findings: The findings of the phenomenon are collectively integrated and described. (6) Shaping the essence of the phenomenon: The fundamental meaning of the phenomenon was described. (7) Validating the findings from the participants: The participants reviewed the findings to ensure that their experiences had been portrayed accurately.  43 Qualitative rigor was assessed based on the four criteria proposed by Lincoln and Guba  44 Rigorous process ensured that the coding structure accurately reflected the lived experiences of participants and increased the trustworthiness of the findings. To avoid researcher bias, the data were peer-reviewed by a researcher with at least 10 years of experience in conducting qualitative research. The trained interviewer was a third party unassociated with the research team and was tasked with conducting the interviews and analyzing the data. Using software to analyze the qualitative data also helps to minimize personal bias and achieve a consistent interpretation of the data. The interview outline, participant data, interview content, and data were recorded and reviewed on a computer. As such, rigor was maintained throughout this study. Ethical considerations This study was approved by an institutional review board (approval number: YM111099E) and funded by the National Science and Technology Council (program number: NSTC 111-2314-B-A49-013-MY3). All participants signed an informed consent form and could withdraw from the study at any time. The study data were kept confidential. All research procedures adhered to research ethics, and conducting the study at the senior fitness center posed no ethical concerns. The equipment and training services were provided by the Health Promotion Administration and Public Health Bureau of Hsinchu City.

The interviewees went from trying out intelligent exercises to incorporating them into their lives, improving their training outcomes, and feeling more confident in continuing to engage in intelligent exercises. Regular physical activity became a routine once they incorporated exercise into their daily life. Training outcomes included improved muscular strength, endurance, and balance, and the interviewees’ sense of control over their health. From unfamiliarity to proactive integration Using smart sports equipment became more than an activity completed during the intervention. The interviewees were initially unfamiliar with the smart equipment but gradually began to use it more often, experiencing its health benefits, particularly physical and spiritual changes. At first, I wasn’t used to using the smart sports equipment and thought that the procedure was complicated. Now I use it regularly every week. (C13) Incorporating the smart sports equipment enriched the course content, and now it is a habit of mine to use it. (D3) I try to use more types of smart sports equipment and maintain regular exercise, which is an excellent habit. (F11) When it comes to physical activity, I’m not a flexible person. But given the opportunity to use the equipment regularly definitely helps me to keep exercising. (M1) Exercise can be integrated into life. When I first participated in this course, I didn’t understand why smart sports equipment was necessary. I gradually understood that new technologies are intertwined with our lives. (P3) Finding balance and sound sleep Although the intervention occurred during the daytime, its effects were key to a good night's sleep. The interviewees felt physically revitalized after the intervention, fell asleep more easily, and slept more soundly at night, as if after a hard day's work. Their overall sleep quality improved. Every time during the week when I come here to take part in the course, I definitely sleep better later that night. Workout day, to me, is a time to adjust my body. I sleep better after doing physical exercise. (F13) I usually sleep for 6–77 hours, but I can get an additional 1–2 hours of sleep on workout day. The sleep quality is indeed better because I won’t wake up at night. (F4) After exercising, I always have a good night's sleep and wake up feeling reenergized. (K5) I normally sleep late, at around 11 or 12 at night. But after doing the exercises recently, I’ll feel tired at around 9 o’clock, and I’ll hit the sack. (M3) I fall asleep easily after exercising. The sleep quality is excellent, and I wake up the next day feeling fresh. (O6) Improving chronic disease management and recovery skills The interviewees noted how the smart sports equipment became a turning point for their engagement in physical recovery and health management. The fitness training yielded stable blood pressure, improvement in heart rate, and chronic pain relief and served as a proactive strategy for resisting physical decline and living with chronic conditions. Using the smart sports equipment improved my chronic condition. I still continue taking my medications without altering the dose, and my blood test parameters remain the same. (E6) Although you can’t eliminate your illness by using the smart sports equipment, doing so improves your body's ability to combat it. (G7) The shoulder press corrected my hunched shoulders and improved my body posture. I am also able to maintain my regular exercise habits. (J3) I have a heart condition; my heart rate soars to 140–150 bpm when exercising vigorously. After completing the course, I feel that my heart rate has decreased during exercise. (I1) I think my chronic conditions have improved. The blood test, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia reports have green-colored values [normal values], which means that my health has improved. (K6) My physical activity levels have changed for the better after completing the course. My blood pressure used to be 130–140 mmHg, but after exercising, it dropped to 120–130 mmHg. It has improved, but not so noticeably…. The weakest part of my body is my muscular endurance. I think I have improved it after completing the course. The balance trainer activated my bones and muscles and improved my balance. (L3) The instructor allowed us to use the smart sports equipment, which helped stabilize my blood pressure and improve my physical activity level. (N2) The physical activity outcomes are pretty decent. I used to suffer from chronic pain, but now the bouts of pain are shorter. (N6) Advancing toward delayed aging Exercising with smart sports equipment enabled the interviewees to maintain their physical functioning, slow their aging, and maintain their mobility and autonomy. This course basically represents good governance. The government subsidizes the use of smart sports equipment and allows me to realize the importance of delayed aging through exercise. (A16) The balance trainer is greater for training balance and reaction time. Older people like us have slower reactions and are susceptible to falls. The instructors here are astute and help us a lot by encouraging us to work out more. (G4) I don’t feel any improvements in my muscular strength after using the smart sports equipment, but it did delay the aging process. (G6) I managed to correct my hunched back after attending the course and gain a better posture. (J3) I enjoy using the squat machine the most. My legs feel better when I sit down. I used to overuse my legs. When I was 40 years old, the doctor told me to go for a knee replacement. I had mobility issues, and I couldn’t walk. But after attending the course for several sessions, I am able to walk for longer durations without using a knee brace. (I5) Participants’ experiencing exercises as aligned with their needs The real-time data records of the smart sports equipment enable users to better understand their fitness. The equipment should not only be an exercise tool but also should meet patients’ needs so that exercising is a “friendlier” process. Accessing exercise performance results in real-time Using the smart sports equipment gave the interviewees a better understanding of their physical fitness and allowed them to observe their physical changes, such as improved muscular strength and cardiorespiratory function, and to see the associated data. The smart sports equipment allows me to observe my heart rate and calories burned, and it also records my data. (A10) To me, the smart equipment is an excellent device for assessing mobility. After using the shoulder press, I understand better about my shoulder problem. (B1) The smart equipment keeps records based on your performance and personalizes your exercise status. (F10) The smart equipment has a calorie monitoring function that provides reference values for us to check whether we have improved our exercise performance. (G9) I think it's convenient to use the smart equipment. Based on the physiological parameters like heart rate and blood pressure, I can check whether my physical fitness has improved or not. (K7) Developing equipment-user alignment Despite its benefits, the interviewees believed that smart sports equipment should better align with users’ needs to make exercising more straightforward and user-friendly. The equipment interface should include easy-to-understand instructions so that the user is able to use it correctly. (B15) When the equipment detects that the user's force input has decreased, it should automatically adjust the load rather than increasing it. (J12) When powered up, the interface should first ask whether the user is a beginner. If they answer yes, it should launch a series of tutorials. Like what the frame displayed on the equipment means, how you should move the ball on the screen, and what moving means…. It should be like a game mode. (K16) I feel that the instructions on the smart equipment are a bit unclear. I don’t understand what different exercises represent. (M9) Fostering of close peer relationships In addition to improving physical fitness and mental health, the intervention significantly reduced the interviewees’ stress and negative emotions. It brought them joy and increased their confidence in themselves and control over their lives. The peer interactions throughout the intervention allowed them to build supportive emotional connections, which further mitigated their loneliness and anxiety. Broadening meaningful social circles The intervention fostered positive emotional bonds and well-being, including vitality and satisfaction with life. It provided opportunities for the interviewees to interact and share experiences, build solid social connections, and enrich their purpose in life. Regarding the mental health benefits, the exercise instructor guided us to interact with each other, which improved our moods. (A24) I honestly enjoy this course; it is relaxing, and I feel better when attending it. (N11) Attending the course is like going back to school. We feel younger and have improved well-being. (L10) I feel happier, and I am able to suppress my negative thoughts by interacting with others. I feel more at ease. (O11) Aside from feeling healthier physically, I also learned a lot of new things and enhanced my social bonds. I don’t feel alone because I have a group of friends whom I can talk with. (B12) There is a sense of rapport during the course. Everyone talks to one another and expresses concern. (D8) By getting along with these classmates, I improved my interpersonal interactions and learned how to communicate with unfamiliar people. (J6) After exercising, my interpersonal interactions have improved, from mental well-being to discussing our purpose in life. (K12) The team cohesion during the course improved my mood. I get to engage in physical activity and meet my friends every time I come here. (N9) I seldom participate in social activities in my daily life. This course allows me to communicate with the instructors and peers and connect with the world outside. (O9) By joining the senior fitness club activities, you are guaranteed to have a thirst for knowledge. You can learn how to plan your life after retirement and make it more meaningful. (P11) Expanding the influence of health in communities The interviewees emphasized the social benefits of smart sports equipment and exercise courses, especially in slowing aging and decreasing medical expenditures. They felt that the course should be broadened to a larger population of older adults and could be a strategy for rationally allocating national healthcare resources and exhibiting the value of public health. I don’t feel like there is a need to improve the smart equipment, but I think the implementer should market it more actively so that more people can benefit from it. (M9) Like the saying goes, prevention is better than cure, so promoting the course and slowing the aging process through exercise can help our country cut down on medical expenditures. (M9) The smart equipment made me a healthier person; it is awesome. (M9) We should introduce the course to a wider older adult audience. This course is very helpful. (M9) I feel that it is worth promoting this intelligent exercise course. (M9) The government should help popularize the use of smart sports equipment. (M9) Discussion This study adopted a mixed-methods approach to explore the effects of an intelligent exercise intervention on older adults. The quantitative results showed that the resilience of participants in the intervention group improved after participating in the intervention. The qualitative interviews further revealed three core concepts in older adults’ experiences of engaging in intelligent exercises: (1) participants’ health as transitioning from adapting to internalizing digital technology, (2) participants’ experiencing exercises as aligned with their needs, and (3) fostering of close peer relationships. These findings underscore the older adults’ transition from adapting to intelligent exercise in the early stage and gradually integrating it into their daily lives. In addition to effectively improving older adults’ digital resilience, the intelligent exercise intervention fostered their adaptability and technology engagement. Our findings showed that the CRS scores of participants in the intervention group increased significantly from the pre-test to the post-test. Participating in intelligent exercises helped older adults to adapt to digital technologies, reduce their technology anxiety, and build their confidence in using smart equipment. After adapting to the smart sports equipment, the older adults internalized their technology usage behavior and reinforced their digital participation and intentions through social support. The establishment of digital resilience is a process of constant adaptation and learning. Consistent with Davis's  12  12 The primary purpose of intelligent exercises is to help older adults to improve their health management skills by adapting to the exercises and then incorporating them into their daily lives. Our results showed that intelligent exercises improved older adults’ sleep quality, management of chronic conditions, and exercise maintenance, thereby delaying the onset of functional decline.  45  46  12 Despite agreeing that intelligent exercises offer a wide range of benefits, most interviewees had a few concerns and offered suggestions for existing technologies and designs. For example, they felt that the equipment interfaces were too complex and not intuitive. Domingos et al.  47  48 Using the smart equipment for several months and becoming familiar with it reduced the interviewees’ technology anxiety and improved their willingness to learn new technologies. This finding aligns with Anderson et al.'s  49  50 The Metaverse Equitable Rehabilitation Therapy (MERTH) Framework, proposed by Veras et al., outlines five critical domains—equity, health services integration, interoperability, governance, and humanization—which provide a comprehensive structure for evaluating digital interventions in aging populations.  51 The interviewees also felt that the personalized functions could be further optimized. For example, one stated, “I enjoyed using the smart sports equipment, but my only concern is user discomfort caused by the equipment's height, which may not suit everyone,” while another stated, “The equipment should be able to automatically adjust the loading when its sensors detect the user is not exerting enough strength. I feel stressed when it continues to increase the loading instead.” Choudhary noted that AI can help to achieve safer and more efficient exercise by automatically adjusting the intensity based on the user's health status.  52 Health promotion through the integration of intelligent exercises and digital technologies is a key opportunity for healthy aging, a notion that has gained traction among government and social organizations, and smart sports equipment can serve as an important tool to help formulate public health policies.  53  50 Challenges in promoting intelligent exercises persist, including gaps in policy planning, older adults’ digital adaptation, and financial limitations-all of which affect the long-term feasibility of implementation. As learning motivation may decline over time, particularly among those unfamiliar with digital tools,  54 To align with the WHO  55 This study has several limitations. First, participants were recruited through purposive sampling at the senior fitness club of a university in Northern Taiwan, which may have introduced selection bias and limited the generalizability of the findings. Although members were drawn from three administrative districts—East District, North District, and Xiangshan District—providing some degree of regional representativeness, the sample may not fully reflect older adults from other regions or those not regularly engaged in structured exercise programs. Second, group allocation was not randomized but based on institutional affiliation, which may have selection bias. To mitigate this, demographic characteristics and baseline data were included as covariates in the analyses, and statistical controls were applied. Future studies are recommended to recruit from multiple sites, adopt randomized designs, and include more diverse populations to enhance representativeness and external validity. Third, participants were self-selected and likely more motivated and health-conscious, introducing the possibility of selection bias. Third, Participants’ resilience was assessed using the Chinese Resilience Scale (CRS), Participants’ resilience was assessed using the Chinese Resilience Scale (CRS), though self-reports may involve response bias due to over- or underestimation. Future research should consider longitudinal designs to assess the sustained impact of intelligent exercise interventions, incorporate objective physiological measurements (e.g., muscle strength), and explore cross-cultural applications to examine contextual influences on digital resilience and technology adoption. Expanding to larger, more diverse populations and implementing randomized controlled trials would strengthen the evidence base for integrating smart sports equipment into community health promotion strategies. Conclusion Intelligent exercise represents a promising form of digital health intervention that can strengthen Digital resilience, enhance digital engagement, and promote healthy aging among older adults. To ensure sustained adoption, future developments should align with digital health equity principles by prioritizing user-centered design, improving usability, and addressing accessibility barriers. Intelligent exercise systems into broader digital health ecosystems such as community health centers, telehealth services, and personalized care platforms may further support long-term behavior change, reduce the digital divide, and empower older adults to take a more active role in their health management.
