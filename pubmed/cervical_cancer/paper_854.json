Exploring\nthe associations between circRNAs and diseases is crucial for early\ndiagnosis and targeted treatment. However, due to the complexity of\nbiological relationships and the presence of multisource heterogeneous\ndata, traditional prediction methods often face challenges such as\ninsufficient information integration, limited semantic expression,\nand information loss. To address these challenges, this paper proposes\na computational model, MTGCDA, based on a multisource heterogeneous\ngraph transformer for high-accuracy prediction of circRNA-disease\nassociations. Specifically, MTGCDA first integrates multisource biological\ninformation about circRNAs and diseases, constructing a heterogeneous\ngraph containing multiple node types and multiple edge relationships.\nRepresentation learning of the graph structure is performed using\na heterogeneous graph neural network, fully exploiting the latent\nsemantic features of different node types. The model then fuses the\nembeddings of circRNA and disease nodes in a multilayer heterogeneous\ngraph convolutional network to construct a joint feature representation,\nwhich is then fed into a CatBoost classifier to accurately score circRNA-disease\nassociations. Experimental results on the CircR2Disease data set demonstrate\nthat the MTGCDA model achieves an AUC of 0.9756, significantly outperforming\nseveral existing methods. At the same time, among the 20 selected\ncircRNA-disease association pairs, 17 pairs were verified by literature\nreports, further demonstrating the high accuracy of the model in predicting\npotential associations and its biological practicality.

With the continuous deepening of\ncircRNA research, a large amount\nof circRNA-related disease data has been continuously accumulated.    These\nmethods integrate a variety of biological information to\naccurately predict potential circRNA-disease associations, thereby\npromoting in-depth research and application of circRNA in the biomedical\nfield. For example, in the network analysis-based method, Lei et al. In order to address the challenges of circRNA-disease association\nprediction and improve the prediction performance, we proposed a new\ncomputational method, MTGCDA. This method is based on a multilayer\nheterogeneous graph encoder with a Transformer structure, which aims\nto capture the potential association between circRNA and disease.\nIn the model design, we first aggregate multisource information into\ncircRNA and disease nodes to construct an initial feature representation,\nand further aggregate and update the features through a multilayer\nheterogeneous graph encoder. Subsequently, the circRNA and disease\nembedding features extracted from each layer are spliced to maximize\ninformation retention. In the decoding stage, we use the spliced features\nas the input of the CatBoost classifier for the association prediction\ntask. To verify the effectiveness of the model, we conducted 5-fold\ncross-validation (5-CV) on the benchmark data set and conducted a\ncomprehensive comparison with 8 advanced methods. Figure Introducing biological meta-pathway information: In\norder to better capture the diverse associations between circRNA and\ndiseases, the MTGCDA framework effectively integrates biological meta-pathway\ninformation. This innovative design enables the model to learn the\ncomplex relationship between circRNA and disease at different biological\nlevels, significantly improving the model’s ability to predict\npotential unknown associations. Application\nof multilayer heterogeneous encoders: This\nmodel uses multilayer heterogeneous encoders to capture different\ntypes of associations. Through this deep feature aggregation strategy,\nthe model can fuse information at different levels, enhance the ability\nto characterize circRNA-disease relationships, and effectively improve\nthe accuracy and generalization of predictions. Deep fusion of embedded information: Considering the\nadvantages of CatBoost in processing embedded features, we use it\nas a decoder to process the circRNA-disease feature splicing matrix,\nfurther optimizing the performance of the model. This design ensures\nefficient fusion of information and enhances the accuracy and stability\nof the model. 1 Schematic diagram of the MTGCDA framework. (a) Multisource information\nconstruction and fusion: This integrates multisource biological information\nabout circRNAs and diseases and constructs a heterogeneous graph.\n(b) Transformer heterogeneous graph representation learning: This\nextracts latent semantic features from different node types through\na heterogeneous graph neural network. (c) Classifier association prediction:\nThis embeds the fused nodes into a CatBoost classifier to accurately\nscore the association between circRNAs and diseases. Methods Data Set As people’s research on the association\nbetween circRNA and diseases deepens, many public databases have been\nconstructed. We constructed four circRNA-disease association data\nsets from many databases, namely CircR2Disease,    Table 1 Dataset Details Database CircRNA Disease Associated CircR2Disease 561 100 607 CircAtlas 708 117 775 Circ2Disease 234 60 254 CircRNADisease 286 48 304 Similarity Feature Extraction Based on circRNA and Disease In our experiments, the similarities constructed using circRNA\ndata include circRNA functional similarity, circRNA sequence similarity,\nand Gaussian kernel similarity. The similarities constructed using\ndisease data include Gaussian kernel similarity and disease semantic\nsimilarity. Disease Semantic Similarity Construction In order to\nmeasure the semantic similarity between diseases, we obtained the\nMeSH vocabulary of disease ontology markers from the MeSH disease\ndatabase and constructed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) by obtaining\ndisease semantic information to reveal the association between different\ndiseases. When constructing a DAG d N  d E  d d DAG  d d N  d E  d DAG DAG d D d s 1 { D d ( s ) = 1 i f s = d D d ( s ) = max { μ · D d ( s ′ ) | s ′ ∈ c h i l d r e n o f s ) i f s ≠ d In the above formula, μ d DV d 2 D V ( d ) = ∑ s ∈ N d D d ( s ) According to the above calculation\nprocess, we assume that there\nare two different diseases, d i d j DS d i d j 3 D S ( d ( i ) , d ( j ) ) = ∑ s ∈ N d ( i ) ∩ N d ( j ) ( D d ( i ) ( s ) + D d ( j ) ( s ) ) D V ( d ( i ) ) + D V ( d ( j ) ) GIP Nuclear Similarity Feature Extraction of Diseases and circRNAs Gaussian integral projection (GIP) kernel similarity is a similarity\ncalculation method based on known interaction information. Based on\nexisting research, in this study, we use GIP kernel similarity to\nmeasure the similarity between circRNA and disease. We construct disease\nsimilarity models based on adjacency matrices and circRNA models based\non adjacency matrices, respectively. The adjacency matrices are obtained\nfrom known association relationships. When constructing the interaction\nrepresentation between diseases, an V d i d i 4 D G I P ( d ( i ) , d ( j ) ) = exp ( − θ d ∥ V ( d ( i ) ) − V ( d ( j ) ) ∥ 2 ) 5 θ d = 1 m ∑ i = 1 m ∥ V ( d ( i ) ) ∥ 2 6 C G I P ( c ( i ) , c ( j ) ) = exp ( − θ c ∥ V ( c ( i ) ) − V ( c ( j ) ) ∥ 2 ) 7 θ c = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ∥ V ( c ( i ) ) ∥ 2 In the above formula, θ  c θ d m n Constructing circRNA Functional Similarity Using Semantic Relationships The construction of circRNA functional similarity comprehensively\nconsiders the similarity contribution of its associated diseases.\nBased on the method proposed by Wang et al., assuming that there are\ntwo semantically identical diseases and both are associated with a\ncertain circRNA, then the circRNA may have similar functions to the\ncircRNA associated with the disease. Based on this hypothesis, two\ndifferent circRNAs are given, represented by c i c j D i D j d i d j C FS c i c j 8 C F S ( c ( i ) , c ( j ) ) = ∑ 1 ≤ i ≤ | D ( i ) | S ( d ( i ) , D ( j ) ) + ∑ 1 ≤ j ≤ | D ( j ) | S ( d ( j ) , D ( i ) ) | D ( i ) | + | D ( j ) | 9 S ( d ( i ) , D ( j ) ) = max 1 ≤ k ≤ | D ( j ) | ( D S ( d ( i ) , d ( k ) ) ) Constructing circRNA Sequence Similarity Based on PCC In order to quantify the similarity between different circRNAs, the\nPCC method was used to measure the sequence similarity between circRNAs. k u v 10 C P S ( u , v ) = ∑ i = 1 n u i − u̅ ∑ i = 1 n v i − v̅ ∑ i = 1 n ( u i − u̅ ) 2 ∑ i = 1 n ( v i − v̅ ) 2 Where n  u̅ = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n u i  v̅ = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n v i Multisource Heterogeneous Similarity Information Fusion In order to enhance the information richness of similarity, we fuse\nmultiple similarity information. Specifically, after constructing\ndifferent similarity matrices, we use a multisimilarity fusion strategy\nto integrate the similarity information on circRNA and diseases. This\nmethod can effectively reduce the limitations of a single feature,\nmake full use of the features of different data sources, and improve\nthe comprehensiveness of similarity measurement. In terms of\ncircRNAs, their similarity is represented by C  FUS c i c j C FUS 11 C F U S ( c ( i ) , c ( j ) ) = { C F S ( c ( i ) , c ( j ) ) if c ( i ) and c ( j ) exist C G I P ( c ( i ) , c ( j ) ) otherwise Similarly, we adopt the same fusion\nstrategy when constructing\nthe disease similarity information representation. Let the disease\nsimilarity be D  FUS d i d j 12 D F U S ( d ( i ) , d ( j ) ) = { D ( d ( i ) , d ( j ) ) if c ( i ) and c ( j ) exist D G I P ( d ( i ) , d ( j ) ) otherwise Finally, we used the multisimilarity\ninformation fusion method\nto construct the circRNA fusion similarity network ( C  FUS D  FUS Construction of Multilayer Heterogeneous Graph Transformer Traditional heterogeneous graph models are difficult to characterize\ncomplex dynamic relationships, while the Transformer-based multilayer\nheterogeneous graph can achieve adaptive modeling and accurately capture\nthe deep associations of heterogeneous data through relationship-aware\nself-attention and relationship-specific parametrization, thereby\nimproving expression and generalization capabilities. Therefore, this\nmultilayer heterogeneous graph is used for node representation learning\nto accurately capture the complex association characteristics and\ndeep interaction patterns between circRNA and diseases. Here, we first\nneed to calculate the heterogeneous mutual attention. Since the target\nnode circRNA and the source node disease are connected through a heterogeneous\ngraph, in order to effectively transfer information, it is necessary\nto calculate the attention weight between the target node circRNA\nand its adjacent disease node. This weight reflects the role of the\ndisease node in updating the circRNA node representation during the\ninformation aggregation process. The calculation process is as follows: 13 Attention ( n d , e c , d , n c ) = Softmax ∀ d ∈ N ( d ) ( P i ∈ [ 1 , h t h ] ATT‐head i ( n d , e d , c , n c ) ) 14 e ( l ) [ n c ] ← Aggregate ∀ c ∈ N ( c ) , ∀ e ∈ E ( d , c ) ( Attention ( n d , n c · M e s s a g e ( n d ) ) ) 15 e ( l ) [ n d ] ← Aggregate ∀ d ∈ N ( d ) , ∀ e ∈ E ( c , d ) ( Attention ( n c , n d · M e s s a g e ( n c ) ) ) 16 ∑ ∀ d ∈ N ( c ) Attention ( n d , e d , c , n c ) = 1 t h × 1 In the formula, Attention Message Aggregate n  c n  d e  d, c i  K − L i n e a r τ ( n d ) i : R d i m → R h t h d i m hth dim τ K–Linear Similarly,\nwhen generating the i–th Q–Linear τ ( nc ATT head  i n  c e c,d n d τ n d K  i n  c 17 A T T − h e a d i ( n d , e d , c , n c ) = ( K i ( n c ) W ϕ ( e d , c ) A T T Q i ( n d ) T ) · μ < τ ( n d ) , ϕ ( e d , c ) , τ ( n c ) > dim 18 K i ( n c ) = K − L i n e a r τ ( n d ) i ( h ( l − 1 ) [ n d ] ) 19 Q i ( n d ) = Q − L i n e a r τ ( n c ) i ( h ( l − 1 ) [ n c ] ) In the above, since different meta-paths\nhave different effects\non the target node, μ τ n d ϕ e d  c τ n c n  c h 20 M e s s a g e H G T ( n d , e d , c , n c ) = P i ∈ [ l , e t h ] M S G − h e a d i ( n d , e d , c , n c ) 21 M S G − h e a d i ( n c , e c , m , n c ) = M − L i n e a r τ ( n c ) i ( e ( l − 1 ) [ n c ] ) W ϕ ( e d , c ) M S G In the above formula,  M − L i n e a r τ ( n d ) i  W ϕ ( e d , c ) M S G e d  c (  l ) n c 22 e ( l ) [ n c ] = A − L i n e a r τ ( n c ) ( σ ( ẽ ( l ) [ n c ] ) ) + e ( l − 1 ) [ n c ] 23 e ( l ) [ n d ] = A − L i n e a r τ ( n d ) ( σ ( ẽ ( l ) [ n d ] ) ) + e ( l − 1 ) [ n d ] Association Prediction The circRNAs extracted from\nthe multilayer heterogeneous encoders were spliced with disease signatures\nto construct a comprehensive representation of circRNA-disease associations\nas shown below: 24 Z i j = [ F c ( i ) , F d ( j ) ] Among them, F c i i th F  c F d j j th F  d Results and Discussion Evaluation Indicators In order to measure the performance\nof the proposed method MTGCDA in prediction tasks to a certain extent,\nwe introduced multiple evaluation indicators to cover the responsiveness\nof the model at different decision-making levels. Specifically, they\ninclude: Accuracy (ACC), Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Specificity.\nThe specific calculation is as follows: A c c u r a c y = T P + T N T P + T N + F P + F N P r e c i s i o n = T P T P + F P R e c a l l = T P T P + F N F 1 = 2 · P r e c i s i o n · R e c a l l P r e c i s i o n + R e c a l l S p e c i f i c i t y = T N T N + F P Among them, TP TN FP TN Empirical Analysis of MTGCDA through 5-CV In order\nto systematically evaluate the stability and generalization performance\nof the proposed method, we used 5-CV for training and testing in all\nexperiments. In the experiment, we evenly divided the complete sample\nset into five subsets, selected one of the subsets as the test set\nin each iteration, and the remaining four groups were used for model\ntraining. This cycle was repeated five times to ensure that each subset\ncould participate in one evaluation as test data. The final experimental\nresults were measured by the average of the five evaluation results\nto minimize the interference of chance on model performance. In the\nsample construction process, considering that the number of verified\nassociations between circRNA and disease is far less than that of\nunknown association pairs, if all unobserved associations are directly\nequated as negative samples, a large number of potential true positive\nsamples may be introduced, resulting in label errors and interference\nwith model training. Therefore, in each cross-validation partition,\nwe regarded the known circRNA-disease pairs in the database as positive\nsamples, and randomly selected an equal number of pairs from unknown\nassociations as negative samples. This strategy not only balances\nthe ratio of positive and negative samples and avoids the bias of\nthe model due to class imbalance, but also effectively reduces noise\ninterference and improves the quality and effectiveness of training\ndata. Through such a sample construction and evaluation mechanism,\nnot only the robustness of the model in the training stage is enhanced,\nbut also its generalization ability on unknown data is improved, laying\na solid foundation for subsequent association prediction tasks. During the model training process, we reasonably configured various\nkey parameters to ensure the stability of the model performance and\nthe efficiency of the training process. All experiments were completed\nunder the same hardware environment. We set the initial learning rate\nto 0.001 and the weight decay coefficient to 1 × 10 –5 Figure 2 Evaluation of the prediction performance of\nthe MTGCDA model based\non 5-CV.

During\nthe experiment, different features were combined in multiple ways,\nand the prediction ability of the combined model of different features\nwas evaluated by inputting different combinations of these views into\nthe model. The experimental results are shown in Figure 3 Performance comparison\nof multiview information fusion strategies\nin MTGCDA model. From the experimental results, we can see that\nthe combination\nC_fun + C_GIP + C_Seq + D_GIP + D_SE achieved the best results, with\nAUC of 0.9756, AUPR of 0.9599, F1 score of 95.13%, ACC of 94.98%,\nRecall of 98.03%, Specificity of 91.94%, and Precision of 92.96%.\nThis combination performed best in indicators such as AUC, AUPR, F1,\nand ACC, indicating that the various features in the combination have\na synergistic effect in improving the predictive performance of the\nmodel and can effectively enhance the model’s ability to predict\nthe association between circRNA and disease. In contrast, although\nthe combinations C_fun + C_GIP + D_GIP +\nD_SE and C_fun + C_Seq + D_GIP + D_SE also performed well in some\nindicators, they failed to surpass the optimal combination overall.\nSpecifically, although the AUC and AUPR of the combination of C_fun\n+ C_GIP + D_GIP + D_SE also reached a high level (0.9619 and 0.9478\nrespectively), the F1 score and ACC dropped slightly, indicating that\nthe combination has certain deficiencies in some evaluation dimensions.\nThis shows that the advantages of a single feature may be difficult\nto fully exert in all dimensions, and the complementarity of multiple\nfeature combinations is crucial to improving performance. We further\nexplored the complementarity of features and their impact on enhancing\nthe generalization ability of the model. The Impact of Different Feature Dimensions on Model Performance In order to further evaluate the impact of feature dimensions on\nmodel prediction performance, we designed experiments under different\ndimension settings to compare and analyze the performance of the model\non multiple indicators. In this experiment, while keeping other parameters\nunchanged, the feature dimensions were set to 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,\nand 512 respectively, and 5-fold cross validation was used to obtain\nthe average performance index. The experimental results are shown\nin Figure 4 Impact of feature\ndimension on the prediction performance of MTGCDA\nmodel. Experimental results show that model performance\nsteadily improves\nwith increasing feature dimensionality at low dimensionality. When\nthe feature dimension increases from 16 to 128, the model shows significant\nimprovements across all metrics, including AUC (from 0.9446 to 0.9756),\nAUPR (from 0.9290 to 0.9599), and F1-score (F1-value) and ACC (accuracy)\nreaching 95.13% and 94.98%, respectively. This suggests that at low\ndimensionality, the model’s ability to capture the characteristic\ninformation associated with circRNAs and diseases is limited, and\na moderate increase in feature dimensionality can help more comprehensively\ncharacterize potential associations. However, when the dimensionality\nis further increased to 256 and 512, model performance decreases.\nAt 256 dimensionality, the AUC drops to 0.9364 and the AUPR to 0.9036,\nboth lower than the results with 128 dimensionality. This suggests\nthat excessively high feature dimensionality may introduce redundant\ninformation or noise, disrupting the model during training and affecting\nprediction accuracy and generalization. Overall, the experimental\nresults suggest that a trade-off should be made between information\nrepresentation ability and redundant noise when selecting feature\ndimensions to obtain the best prediction performance. Impact of MTGCDA Model Structure Hyperparameters on Performance In order to further explore the impact of model structural hyperparameters\non performance, this paper designs an ablation experiment on the number\nof attention heads and network layers in the multihead attention mechanism.\nThrough the control variable method, under the premise of fixing other\nparameter configurations, the number of attention heads and network\nlayers are systematically adjusted to evaluate their specific impact\non model performance, so as to optimize the model structure design\nand improve its generalization and expression capabilities. In the experiment of the number of attention heads, we set 2, 4,\n8, 16, 32, and 64 heads respectively, and evaluated their performance\nin multiple indicators such as AUC, AUPR, F1, ACC, Recall, Specificity\nand Precision. The experimental results are shown in Figure 5 Impact of varying the\nnumber of attention heads on the performance\nof MTGCDA. The experimental results show that the model performance\nis optimal\nwhen the number of attention heads is 4, at which time AUC and AUPR\nare 0.9756 and 0.9599 respectively, and the F1 value also reaches\n0.9513, showing good stability and accuracy. As the number of attention\nheads increases, the overall model performance shows a downward trend.\nThe reason is that the multihead mechanism introduces too much redundant\nattention distribution, which dilutes the effective representation\nand makes it difficult for the model to focus on key semantic dependency\nfeatures, which in turn weakens the discrimination ability. In the setting of the number of network layers, we increase the\nmodel depth from 1 layer to 8 layers to observe its impact on representation\nlearning ability and prediction performance. The experimental results\nare as Figure 6 Performance\ncomparison of MTGCDA model with different number of\nstructural layers. The results show that as the number of layers increases,\nthe overall\nmodel performance shows a steady upward trend until it reaches the\noptimal level at 5 layers, when all indicators perform best (AUC is\n0.9756, AUPR is 0.9599). This shows that moderately deepening the\nnetwork helps capture more complex high-order feature associations\nand enhances the modeling ability of potential circRNA-disease associations.\nHowever, after more than 5 layers, the model performance fluctuates\nand falls back, especially in indicators such as F1 and Precision.\nThis phenomenon may be caused by problems such as gradient disappearance,\nredundant feature stacking, and overfitting brought by deep networks,\nwhich affects the generalization performance of the model on the test\nset. In summary, when the number of attention heads is set to 4 and\nthe number of network layers is set to 5, the model performs best\nin all performance indicators, showing good robustness and generalization\nability. Comparative Analysis of Multiple Classifiers under the MTGCDA\nFramework In order to comprehensively evaluate the adaptability\nand stability of the proposed method under different classifier architectures,\nthis paper compares the performance of various mainstream classification\nmodels based on the unified feature representation input, including\nsupport vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), CatBoost,\nextra trees (ET), AdaBoost, gradient boosting (GB), histogram-based\ngradient boosting (HGB), decision tree (DT) and Gaussian naive Bayes\n(NB). The index comparison is shown in Figure Table 7 Comparative\nanalysis of the performance of various classifiers\nin the MTGCDA model. 3 Experimental Results of Different\nClassifiers classifier AUC AUPR F1 (%) ACC (%) Recall\n(%) Specificity (%) Precision (%) SVM 0.8035 0.6733 88.55 87.15 99.33 74.96 79.93 LR 0.8250 0.7258 84.88 83.03 95.64 70.28 76.36 CatBoost 0.9756 0.9599 95.13 94.98 98.03 91.94 92.96 ET 0.9447 0.9409 89.55 89.13 93.36 84.83 86.08 Adaboost 0.7318 0.6580 75.15 69.44 92.53 46.22 63.30 GB 0.9247 0.9114 88.08 87.23 94.41 80.14 82.60 HGB 0.9247 0.9042 87.85 86.90 94.64 79.31 82.14 DT 0.8817 0.8472 86.74 85.34 96.01 74.56 79.15 NB 0.7727 0.7947 76.30 72.32 89.28 55.39 66.74 The experimental results show that the CatBoost classifier\nhas\nachieved the best performance in almost all evaluation indicators,\nand its performance is significantly higher than other classifiers.\nThis shows that CatBoost has shown strong adaptability and generalization\ncapabilities in dealing with high-dimensional sparse features, modeling\nnonlinear relationships, and coping with data imbalance problems,\nverifying its rationality as the core classification component of\nthis study. Among other ensemble learning methods, Extra Trees and\nGradient Boosting also performed well. The former is highly competitive\nin AUC and AUPR, and the latter has also reached a high level in multiple\nindicators. This shows that classifiers based on ensemble mechanisms\nhave significant advantages over traditional methods in modeling complex\nfeature interactions. In contrast, although traditional linear classifiers\nsuch as SVM and Logistic Regression perform well in Recall rate, their\noverall recognition ability is limited and it is difficult to fully\ncapture complex nonlinear distribution features. The weak classifier\nNB performed poorly in this task, indicating that its ability to model\nhigh-dimensional complex biological data is limited. In summary, CatBoost\nnot only achieves the best results in key indicators such as Precision,\nRecall, and F1 value, but also has strong model stability and generalization\nability. It is the most suitable classifier choice for the current\ntask. Comparison with Other Models In recent years, with\nthe continuous deepening of circRNA research, many computational methods\nhave been proposed to efficiently predict circRNA-disease associations\n(CDA) and have achieved good results. In order to further comprehensively\nevaluate the effectiveness and advancement of the MTGCDA model proposed\nby us, this paper systematically compares it with the current mainstream\ncircRNA-disease association prediction methods, including SATPIC2CD, Table 4 Comparison of Results from Different\nModels Methods AUC Recall ACC F1 SATPIC2CD 0.9728 0.9703 0.4976 0.017 HGCNCDA 0.9491 0.5137  0.9920 0.5532 Bi-SGTAR 0.8747 0.8759 0.4965 0.0107 RPMVCDA 0.9518 0.9115 0.9378 0.911 EELMCDA 0.9291 0.8705 0.924 0.9194 MNDCDA 0.9070 0.4874 0.9612 0.0509 ICDFGF 0.9572 0.9104 0.9012 0.9029 ELCDA 0.9289 0.8320 0.8560 0.852 MTGCDA  0.97558  0.9803 0.94976  0.9513 To further assess the differences in predictive performance\nbetween\nmodels, we performed a statistical analysis on the results. The obtained\np-value was 0.0215, below the 0.05 threshold, suggesting that the\nnull hypothesis of no performance difference can be rejected. This\nindicates that the models show statistically significant variations\nin their predictive capabilities. Validation on an Independent Data Set To further validate\nthe generalization performance of the proposed method, we conducted\nexperiments on the Circ2Disease independent data set. This data set\nwas not used in the model training process and effectively evaluates\nthe model’s adaptability to unseen samples. During the experiment,\nthe model parameters were consistent with those in the main experiment,\nand the same evaluation metrics were used for comparative analysis.\nThe experimental results are shown in Table 5 Verification of Experimental Results\non Dataset Circ2Disease Test set AUC AUPR F1 (%) ACC (%) Recall\n(%) Specificity (%) Precision (%) 1 0.9046 0.8776 87.93 86.27 98.08 74.01 79.69 2 0.9393 0.8852 90.53 91.18 91.49 90.91 89.58 3 0.8785 0.8309 88.70 87.25 99.17 74.51 79.69 4 0.9784 0.9706 93.58 93.07 99.20 86.01 87.93 5 0.9517 0.9579 89.72 89.11 90.57 87.50 88.89 Average 0.9305 0.9045 90.09 89.38 95.70 82.58 85.16 The experimental results show that the model also\nachieves excellent\npredictive performance on this independent data set. Metrics such\nas AUC, AUPR, F1 score, and ACC are similar to or slightly better\nthan those on the main data set, demonstrating that the model can\neffectively capture the potential associations between circRNAs and\ndiseases in different data environments. Case Study To further verify the reliability and practical\napplication ability of the proposed model MTGCDA in identifying potential\ncircRNA-disease associations, this paper conducted a case study based\non real data. Specifically, we regarded all known circRNA-disease\nassociations as positive samples, and randomly selected association\npairs equal to the number of positive samples from unknown associations\nas negative samples to construct a training set. After the model was\ntrained on this sample set, it predicted all unknown circRNA-disease\ncombinations and output the corresponding association scores. The\nhigher the score, the greater the possibility that the combination\nis a potential true association ( Table 6 20 High-Confidence Disease-Related\ncircRNAs Predicted by the Model  CircRNA Disease PMID 1 circ-ABCB10 Colorectal Cancer 33902207 2 hsa_circ_0000144 urinary bladder cancer 30098434 3 hsa_cire_0007385 Lung Cancer 29372377 4 circPVT1 acute myeloid leukemia 36718632 5 mmu_circRNA_017963 Alzheimer\ndisease 29448241 6 Circ_BEND6 hepatocellular carcinoma Unconfirmed 7 mmu_circRNA_006229 Alzheimer disease 29448241 8 hsa_circ_0016760 Liver Cancer 29440731 9 circANRIL atherosclerosis 35497183 10 hsa_circ_0001946 urinary bladder cancer 29694981 11 Cir-ITCH liver cancer Unconfirmed 12 hsa_circ_0001141 Stomach Cancer 33060778 13 circHIPK3 urinary bladder cancer 37269429 14 hsa_circ_0004458 Gastric Cancer 28544609 15 Circ_SLC8A1 urinary bladder cancer 31228937 16 mmu_circRNA_012180 Alzheimer\ndisease 29448241 17 circRNA_ 010567 Colon Cancer Unconfirmed 18 hsa_circ_0007158 urinary bladder cancer 27484176 19 hsa_circ_0004214 Cervical Cancer 28622299 20 has_circ_0006633 Gastric Cancer 28656881 Based on this, we selected several circRNA-disease\ncombinations\nwith high model prediction scores for in-depth analysis. These predictions\nwere then empirically validated by searching relevant literature in\nthe PubMed database. The results demonstrated that these high-confidence\npredictions were supported by existing experimental literature, further\ndemonstrating the applicability and predictive power of the MTGCDA\nmodel in real-world biological scenarios. Furthermore, we identified\n20 circRNA-disease associations with high potential for research.\nThese results were not only applied to the model training process,\nbut also demonstrated biological plausibility in recent studies of\ndisease mechanisms. Among them, circ-ABCB10 may play a role in colorectal\ncancer by regulating the expression of genes involved in cancer cell\nproliferation and migration, while hsa_circ_0000144 has been found\nto regulate the proliferation and invasiveness of bladder cancer cells.\nOverexpression of circPVT1 is closely associated with drug resistance\nand prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia, potentially promoting tumor\nprogression by regulating key oncogenic signaling pathways. Regarding\nthe neurodegenerative disease-associated mmu_circRNA_017963, it is\nimplicated in regulating neuronal apoptosis and synaptic function\nin Alzheimer’s disease models, suggesting its potential role\nin disease progression. circANRIL, a potential regulator of atherosclerosis,\nmay exert its effects by influencing vascular smooth muscle cell apoptosis\nand inflammatory responses. For the predicted associations that have\nnot yet been experimentally validated, circ_BEND6 with hepatocellular\ncarcinoma, Cir-ITCH with liver cancer, and circRNA_010567 with colon\ncancer, these are identified as important candidate targets for future\nexperimental validation. Based on their prediction scores, they are\nspeculated to participate in disease progression by regulating cancer-related\nsignaling pathways and cell cycle-related genes. This discovery\ndemonstrates the excellent generalization performance\nand potential for biological knowledge mining of MTGCDA, providing\nvaluable candidate targets and theoretical foundations for subsequent\nexperimental research. These results further validate the feasibility\nand effectiveness of MTGCDA in practical applications and demonstrate\nits powerful ability to uncover potential circRNA-disease associations.\nThis model can not only help researchers efficiently screen candidate\nassociations with biological significance, but also provide solid\ntheoretical support and predictive tools for exploring the mechanisms\nof disease occurrence and developing new biomarkers. Conclusions In recent years, a large number of studies\nhave shown that circRNA\nplays a key regulatory role in the occurrence and development of diseases.\nTherefore, building an efficient and accurate prediction model to\nidentify potential circRNA-disease associations is of great significance\nfor disease mechanism research and target discovery. This paper proposes\na novel multisource heterogeneous graph joint attention mechanism\nmodel MTGCDA to systematically mine potential circRNA-disease associations.\nMTGCDA integrates a variety of biological feature information, including\nsequence similarity, functional annotations, semantic hierarchical\nrelationships, and GIP kernel similarity, constructs a multisource\nheterogeneous graph, and introduces an attention mechanism to dynamically\nmodel the importance of feature channels, thereby accurately capturing\ncomplex biological relationships. Experimental results show\nthat MTGCDA performs significantly better\nthan existing mainstream methods on multiple real data sets, and achieves\nleading results in indicators such as AUC, AUPR, and F1, verifying\nits effectiveness in feature fusion and representation learning. Parameter\nsensitivity analysis and ablation experiments further confirm the\ncore value of the multisource heterogeneous structure and attention\nmechanism in the model. At the same time, the case study section demonstrates\nthe application potential of MTGCDA in actual circRNA-disease association\nmining, in which several high-scoring prediction pairs have been confirmed\nin the literature, indicating that this method not only has good generalization\nability, but also has strong biological explanatory power. Although\nMTGCDA has achieved satisfactory results, the heterogeneous\ngraph constructed by the current model has not yet covered more potential\ntypes of biological information, and there is still room for further\nexpansion. Although MTGCDA performs well in integrating multisource\nfeatures and predicting circRNA-disease associations, the model still\nhas several limitations: First, it relies heavily on the integrity\nand quality of the input data, and prediction accuracy may be affected\nwhen data is missing or noisy. Second, the model has high computational\ncost and memory consumption when processing large-scale data or high-dimensional\nfeatures, and it does not fully model the complex nonlinear relationships\nbetween features. Future research can further explore meta-pathway\ndesign, graph structure expansion, and cross-modal information fusion\nto enhance the model’s ability to express and explain complex\ndisease mechanisms, providing stronger theoretical support and practical\ntools for circRNA-related research.
