Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a specific subpopulation of cells within the tumour characterised by self-renewal, proliferation and tumorigenic potential. Heterogeneity in the CSCs population and their ability to rewire the signalling networks make it difficult to target cancer by single gene inhibition. This study investigates the regulatory role of miR-195-5p in modulating CSC properties and associated signalling pathways in breast cancer. Previously shown to inhibit proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, miR-195-5p is now revealed to downregulate stemness markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and CD44). The prevalence of heterogeneity of stemness markers in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines is a novel advancement of this study. In MCF-7, SOX2-and CD44-overexpressing cells were found to be distinct, non-overlapping populations, as confirmed by immunofluorescence colocalisation analysis. SOX2-positive nuclei comprised ∼30 % of the MCF-7 population and were significantly reduced following miR-195-5p overexpression. Mechanistically, this downregulation of stemness correlated with decreased expression of β-catenin and its upstream regulators GSK3β and FZD6, were validated as direct targets of miR-195-5p using a luciferase reporter assay. miR-195-5p also inhibited TCF/LEF transcriptional activity, indicating suppression of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signalling. Functionally, miR-195-5p overexpression led to a reduced proliferation zone in CFSE-prestained 3D spheres derived from MCF-7 cells over seven days. To further dissect its mechanism, Wnt signalling was perturbed using siRNA against GSK3β, β-catenin and ICG-001 (a CBP/β-catenin interaction inhibitor), and their combination. GSK3β knockdown led to increased β-catenin expression, nuclear localisation, and enhanced 3D sphere proliferation, while β-catenin inhibition upregulated protein expression of GSK3β and suppressed proliferation of cancer cells. Combined inhibition of GSK3β and CBP/β-catenin interaction downregulated expression of β-catenin, supporting the role of miR-195-5p in CSC suppression. This study identifies miR-195-5p as a potent regulator of CSCs and proliferation, and modulator of the Wnt signalling cascade. Co-inhibition of GSK3β and CBP/β-catenin through miR-195-5p highlights its therapeutic potential in combating stemness and proliferation in breast cancer.

Among major malignancies, breast cancer exhibits the highest incidence rate and is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide (GLOBOCAN 2022). Despite lower mortality rates in developed countries, the highest incidence and mortality in developing countries like India continue to face high incidence and mortality, primarily due to late-stage detection and limited access to advanced therapeutic interventions [ 1 The primary reason behind breast cancer drug resistance and relapse is the presence of a specific subpopulation of tumour-initiating cells (TICs) known as cancer stem-like cells (CSCs), which have drug efflux activity, can self-renew, proliferate, metastasise and arrest in G0 phase (senescence) during chemotherapy. CSCs are prone to mutation and possess multilineage differentiation potential, instigating tumour heterogeneity and making it difficult to target with a single drug administration. They exhibit oncogenic potential and play a central role in tumour initiation, progression, and heterogeneity [ 2 + - 3 4 Evidence from literature suggests that the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway has a vital role in regulating breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), rewriting crucial processes such as proliferation, self-renewal, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), maintenance of tumour microenvironment, and therapeutic resistance [ [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] 11 While various inhibitors of the Wnt pathway have established anticancer potential in preclinical studies, none have yet been permitted for clinical practice [ 12 13 [14] [15] [16] [17] 18 19 20 This study traverses the regulatory capacity of miR-195 in BCSCs by evaluating its influence on stemness markers, signalling pathways Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt, and proliferation capability on a 3D spheroid model. Through molecular, cellular, and functional assays, it is demonstrated that miR-195 efficiently targets the Wnt signalling and accompanying stemness pathways, exhibiting its potential for eradicating BCSCs, the chief factor driving the relapse and resistance in breast cancer. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 A computational approach to identify target genes of miRNA-195-5p To understand the mechanism of action of miR-195, the potential target genes were identified using a computational database. The prediction of target genes of miR-195 was analysed using TargetScan 8.0 ( www.targetscan.org/vert_80/ https://www.mirbase.org/ https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ 21 2.2 Cell line maintenance and transfection The Breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were procured from CSIR- National Centre for Cell Sciences (NCCS), Pune, India. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) High glucose (Sigma USA) and RPMI (Sigma USA) respectively containing 10 % (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, Brazil), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, 0.25 μg/mL amphotericin (Thermo Scientific) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5 % CO 2 5 5 2.3 Immunofluorescence microscopy MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded and transfected in 24-well plates using the method mentioned above. The cells were then fixed with chilled 4 % paraformaldehyde (in 1× PBS pH 7.4), permeabilised with 0.3 % Triton X-100 and blocked for 2 h with 1 % BSA, 22.52 mg/mL glycine in PBS. Cells were incubated overnight in primary antibodies SOX2 (Anti-Rabbit CST #3579S) and CD44 (Anti-mouse CST #3570T 1:200 dilution). Cells were washed with PBST and incubated with secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor-488 anti-rabbit antibody and Alexa Fluor-555 anti-mouse (1:500 dilution). Nucleus wear DAPI was used to stain them at a concentration of 1 μg/mL. A fluorescent image was captured using a Nikon Ti-epifluorescence microscope and analysed using ImageJ software. 2.4 Quantitative gene expression MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate. Transfection of miR-195 mimic and anti-miR-195 inhibitor was performed when the cells reached ∼80 % confluency. After 24 h of transfection, cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. Total RNA was extracted using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., USA). cDNA was synthesised using a High-Capacity Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) per the manufacturer's instructions. Stem-loop primers were used to synthesise cDNA miR-195, and the SNO transcript was used for normalisation [ 22 Supplementary Table 1 23 2.5 Western blotting Cells were harvested and lysed using RIPA Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 % SDS, 1 % NP 40, 1 % Sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM EDTA, containing protease inhibitors and Phosphatase inhibitors). Nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extraction was performed using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Thermo Scientific) [ 24 25 2.6 3′ UTR cloning & dual-luciferase reporter assay To validate the target binding correlation of miR-195, the 3′ UTR sequence of GSK3β (chr3:119,821,321–120,094,447) and FZD6 (chr8:103298898-103332866) was obtained from the UCSC Browser. Primers were designed between the miRNA binding site, containing hanging restriction sites Not1 and Xho1, using Primer3 software. The insertion sequence is amplified using human genomic DNA as a template and Pfu polymerase (Promega). The cloning Vector used was psiCHECK-2™ dual luciferase plasmid (Promega), and PCR amplified insert sequences were double-digested with restriction enzymes, Xho Not 2.7 TCF/LEF reporter luciferase assay Canonical WNT/β-catenin signalling activity was analysed using a TCF/LEF Reporter kit (BPS Biosciences, USA). MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with miR-195 and TCF/LEF reporter vector with Lipofectamine 3000 as per the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, cells were harvested and analysed for Luciferase activity using a Dual-luciferase Assay Kit (Promega) [ 26 2.8 siRNA-mediated gene knockdown and protein interaction inhibitor To understand the significance of gene inhibition and the network regulatory mechanism of miR-195, we carried out siRNA-mediated knockdown of GSK3β, β-catenin (Invitrogen) and ICG-001 (Sigma) mediated CBP/β-catenin interaction inhibition (5 μM). MCF-7 cells were transfected with siRNA in 12-well plates at a dose of 25 nM by using Lipofectamine 3000 and harvested after 24 h. 2.9 Cell cycle analysis After 72 h of transfection, cells were harvested using trypsin and washed twice with cold PBS. The cells were fixed with ice-cold 70 % ethanol for ∼4 h at −20 °C. Cells were then centrifuged at 10,000× g 2.10 3D sphere formation assay ∼1.5 × 10 5 27 28 2.11 3D sphere proliferation zone assay 24 h post-transfection, MCF-7 cells were harvested to make a single-cell suspension after washing twice in PBS. Cells were incubated in 5 μM CFSE Dye (Invitrogen) for 20 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were washed and re-instated in DMEM-High glucose complete media to absorb any unbound dye, and ∼10000 cells were seeded in a U-shaped-bottom non-adherent microplate (Thermo Scientific, USA) and centrifuged. The 3D spheres were imaged for 7 days using a ZOE Fluorescence Microscope (Bio-Rad). ImageJ software was used to analyse the proliferation zone based on dye retention and to calculate the percentage of dye-retaining area relative to the total spheroid area measured from the corresponding brightfield images [ 28 2.12 Statistical analysis Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism Software (v.9.5, GraphPad, Inc., USA) to ascertain the statistical significance, and an unpaired t 3 Results 3.1 In silico This study reanalysed previously identified differentially regulated genes from our miR-195-regulated microarray dataset ( GSE43656 Supplementary Fig. 1A Supplementary Fig. 1B Fig. 1 Supplementary Fig. 1B Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 miR-195-5p Target Prediction and Expression Analysis. Fig. 1 To contemplate the above observations, the regulatory mechanism of miR-195 was analysed in vitro Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 3.2 Identification and characterisation of cancer stem cell-like populations in breast cancer cell lines Considering the downregulation of the stem cell proliferation pathway in the microarray data, it was first imperative to identify the stem cell-like population in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. CSCs are known to be regulated by pluripotent transcriptional factors, such as SOX2, NANOG, OCT4, and c-MYC, and/or have the expression of cell surface markers like CD44 and CD133 [ [29] [30] [31] The MCF-7 cell line was found to have a unique subpopulation of SOX2-positive and rare CD44-overexpressing cells. Colocalisation analysis revealed that SOX2-positive and CD44-overexpressing cells exist as distinct populations, underscoring the heterogeneity of CSCs in MCF-7 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 2A Supplementary Fig. 2B Supplementary Fig. 2C Supplementary Fig. 2A 29 3.3 miR-195 down-regulates stemness markers in breast cancer cells Transcription factors, such as CD44, OCT4, NANOG, and SOX2, are critical pluripotency regulators that regulate cancer stemness [ [30] [31] [32] 33 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 34 Fig. 2 Downregulation of the expression of stemness markers in MCF-7 & MDA-MB-231 cell lines by miR-195-5p (100 nM) . Fig. 2 3.4 miR-195 downregulates stemness in breast cancer through the Wnt signalling network As mentioned above, Wnt signalling is a critical pathway regulating stemness in all cancers, including breast cancer [ 5 6 35 In-silico Fig. 3 Fig. 3 miR-195 regulates the WNT signalling network in MCF-7 . Fig. 3 We investigated the effects of miR-195 on the translational expression of GSK3β, GSK3β-pS9, FZD6, pan-AKT, and c-MYC, key regulators of the Wnt signalling pathway critical for maintaining stemness. Overexpression of miR-195 at 100 nM concentration reduced the protein levels of GSK3β, GSK3β-pS9, FZD6, pan-AKT, and c-MYC, whereas suppression of endogenous miR-195 using Anti-miR-195 increased the expression of GSK3β and FZD6 expression in the MCF-7 cell line ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Nuclear β-Catenin activates T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF) with their cofactor CBP, regulating oncogenic processes such as proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while promoting stemness via upregulation of c-Myc and cyclin D1 [ [36] [37] [38] Fig. 4 Fig. 3 39 Fig. 4 miR-195 inhibits cell proliferation by regulating β-Catenin expression and TCF/LEF promoter activity in MCF-7. Fig. 4 3.5 miR-195 regulates cell proliferation by regulating the expression of β-catenin in MCF-7 It is known that the strong expression of nuclear β-Catenin is directly correlated with the high proliferation capacity of breast cancer cells, and the nuclear translocation of β-catenin is blocked by modulating the PI3K/AKT axis [ 32 Fig. 4 Since CSCs are characterised by their self-renewal, tumorigenic and proliferation potential, in this study, we have focused on the proliferation nature of MCF-7 in the 3D tumour microenvironment. Previously, our research group showed that miR-195 regulates cell proliferation in MCF-7 cells in an in vitro Fig. 4 3.6 miR-195 inhibits cell proliferation by modulating the Wnt signalling network Our observations indicate that miR-195 inhibits Wnt signalling at multiple levels, reducing β-catenin expression and TCF/LEF promoter activity and affecting breast cancer cell proliferation in 3D spheroid models. To further validate the functional relevance of the Wnt signalling network and its regulation by miR-195, we modulated its expression through siRNA-mediated inhibition of GSK3β and β-catenin, as well as ICG-001-mediated inhibition of the CBP/β-catenin interaction individually, and their combination. Nuclear β-catenin requires CREB-binding protein (CBP), a key co-activator, for transcriptional activation of TCF/LEF and plays an essential role in regulating cancer stem cells (CSCs) [ 40 Fig. 5 10.13039/100004980 CBP Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Co-inhibition of GSK3β and β-Catenin/CBP modulates β-Catenin expression and localisation in MCF-7 cells. Fig. 5 4 Discussion Tumour heterogeneity has long been recognised, and the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis emerged as early as the 18th–19th century. However, the first functional validation based on cell surface markers CD44+ve/CD24-ve became successful in breast cancer after more than 100 years in 2003 [ 32 41 In breast cancer, CSCs are characterised by markers such as CD44+ve/CD24-ve, CD133, OCT4, SOX2, and ALDH1. Our immunofluorescent colocalisation analysis in MCF-7 cells revealed distinct subpopulations expressing either CD44 or SOX2, without overlap. This is also seen in a study on patient tumour cells, where none of the CD44+ve cells had colocalisation with ALDH1 markers [ 42 43 44 MicroRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-195, have emerged as promising therapeutic molecules for targeting CSC heterogeneity due to their ability to simultaneously modulate multiple signalling pathways. miR-195 has been identified as a tumour-suppressive miRNA with a pivotal role in regulating diverse signalling networks such as PI3K/AKT, MAPK/ERK, and Wnt/β-catenin [ 45 46 47 49 50 Fig. 1 Supplementary Fig. 1 Wnt signalling plays a crucial role in the maintenance of CSCs by facilitating self-renewal, proliferation, and metastasis, primarily through β-catenin/CBP-mediated transcription of downstream targets such as LGR5, c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and CD44 [ 48 To better mimic in vivo tumour architecture, we utilised a 3D spheroid culture system, which recapitulates human tumours' spatial and physiological heterogeneity, including proliferative outer zones, quiescent inner zones, and necrotic cores [ 51 52 Our observations at the molecular level highlight a dual-axis regulatory role of miR-195-5p, targeting GSK3β and β-catenin in chorus to suppress the function of CSCs. While siRNA-mediated inhibition of GSK3β individually led to increased nuclear accumulation of β-catenin due to impaired degradation, the direct siRNA-mediated inhibition of β-catenin might have induced compensatory upregulation of GSK3β. Similarly, disruption of the CBP/β-catenin interaction using ICG-001 resulted in increased expression of both GSK3β and β-catenin. Remarkably, co-inhibition of GSK3β and β-catenin led to a noticeable reduction in β-catenin expression, underlining a synergistic effect shown by miRNA-195 to curb the proliferation in breast cancer cells through targeting the Wnt signalling pathway. This phenocopied the miR-195-5p impact, emphasising that miR-195 coordinated targeting circumvents compensatory feedback loops often associated with single-target strategies. These results underscore the therapeutic potential of miR-195 in overcoming feedback-driven resistance mechanisms in CSC-enriched tumours. While our observations in vitro 5 Conclusion Immunofluorescence investigation of the MCF-7 cell line exposed the distinct cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulations independently overexpressing either CD44 or SOX2. This is representative of phenotypically heterogeneous CSCs. In uniformity, miR-195 downregulated SOX2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, as observed in the microarray analysis. MDA-MB-231 cells exhibited relatively high expression of CD44, and miR-195-5p significantly downregulated CD44 level, emphasising its regulatory potential across both subtypes of breast cancer. In 3D spheroids of MCF-7, miR-195 controlled the spheroid architecture and proliferation zones by targeting the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway. The above findings disclose a functional link between miR-195-mediated regulation of Wnt signalling, dynamics of β-Catenin expression, and tumour organisation, highlighting its potential as a beneficial modulator in breast cancer.
