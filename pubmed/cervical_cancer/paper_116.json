ARID1A has a dual role in oncogenic and tumor-suppressive functions, depending on the type of cancer. However, its role in SCLC remains unclear. Herein, we showed that ARID1A was highly expressed and correlated with prognosis in SCLC.

The results demonstrate that while both BRD and JQ1 monotherapies effectively inhibit tumor growth in vivo, their combination exhibits superior antitumor activity (Fig. 8 S8 Discussion SCLC is a devastating neuroendocrine tumor with high mortality and recurrence rates [ 32 33 ARID1A ARID1A ARID1A ARID1A c-MYC PARP1 ARID1A, a subunit of the SWI/SNF family, is a chromatin remodeling complex that functions through ATP hydrolysis and energy release and exhibits a synthetic lethal effect with the ATR/CHK1 pathway [ 22 24 ARID1A ARID1A ARID1A c-MYC PARP1, 34 35 c-MYC PARP1 8 Bromodomain and outdomain (BET) proteins, mainly composed of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 proteins, function as epigenetic readers and transcription coactivators and are currently recognized as therapeutic cancer targets [ 36 37 ARID1A 10 ARID1A ARID1A ARID1A In conclusion, our experiment reported for the first time that ARID1A functions as a tumor suppressor gene in SCLC cells, and ARID1A ARID1A ARID1A Materials and Methods Cell culture Human lung cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S), and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS and 1% P/S. All cells were cultivated in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 Antibodies and drugs Primary antibodies against the following proteins were used for immunoblotting: ARID1A [Cell Signaling Technology (CST), #12354S, 1:1,000], c-MYC (CST, #5605, 1:1,000), PARP1 (Active Motif, #39559,1:5,000), phospho-Akt (Ser 473 235/236 317 4 8 9 SCLC dataset analysis RNA-seq data from 50 SCLC and 75 LUAD cell lines, and general information for these cell lines, were downloaded from https://depmap.org/portal/download/ GSE60052 GSE149507 https://bigd.big.ac.cn/gsa-human https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/omix https://www.cancerrxgene.org/downloads/anova ARID1A MYC 50 ARID1A MYC 50 ARID1s https://www.cbioportal.org Cell viability and clonogenic assays Cells seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 3,000 cells per well were treated with small compounds as indicated. After incubation for 72 h at 37 °C, 20 μl of CellTiter-Glo (CTG) solution was added to each well and incubated in the dark for 10 min at room temperature. The fluorescence intensity was recorded on an Envision PerkinElmer porous plate microplate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). Cells in each group were tested with at least 3 independent biological replicates. For the clonogenic assay, cells were plated at a density of 1,000 to 3,000 cells per well in 6-well plates. After 24 h, the media were replaced with complete media containing various dilutions of the drugs and cultured for 14 to 21 d in a humidified incubator of 5% CO 2 Transfections with siRNA and plasmid DNA For siRNA-mediated ARID1A c-MYC PARP1 S1 EdU assay Cells were treated with 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 2 h at 37 °C under the prescribed conditions at a final concentration of 10 μM. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min and permeated with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Cells were then washed with PBS containing 3% BSA 3 times, followed by the detection of EdU signals using a Leica confocal microscope. Virus package and construction of stable cell lines The short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were designed using the AsiDesigner software ( https://rnaidesigner.thermofisher.com/rnaiexpress/sort.do ARID1A ARID1A ARID1A Drug treatment For drug treatment studies, SCLC cells were treated with 2 mM HU for 4 or 8 h to induce replication stress or with 4 mM HU to generate DSBs. For JQ1 treatment, cells were exposed to 1 or 2 μM JQ1 (DMSO as vehicle control) for 24 h before harvest. Long-term clonogenic assays employed specified concentrations of JQ1 and BRD-K98645985 for 7 to 10 d. Drug synergy was assessed by 72 h cotreatment with JQ1 and BRD-K98645985, followed by CellTiter-Glo viability assays, with synergy indices calculated using Combenefit software (CRUK Cambridge Institute). RT-qPCR and ChIP-PCR The Trizol RNA extraction kit was used to extract the total RNA from the cells. Next, total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Novizam reverse transcription kit with a genomic DNA (gDNA) eraser according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Finally, qPCR detection and analysis were performed using the Novizam fluorescence quantitative kit on a Roche LightCycler 96 Real-Time PCR System. The relative expression levels of the tested genes were normalized to the housekeeping gene β-actin. The primer sequences used for qPCR are summarized in Table S3 38 S4 Cell apoptosis assays To detect apoptosis, the cells were treated under specified conditions for 48 h and then incubated with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide for annexin detection. Cell apoptosis was detected using FACSCalibur (Cytexpert, Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA), and data were analyzed using FlowJo V10 software (Flowjo LLC, Ashland, Oregon, USA). Immunofluorescence staining For indirect immunofluorescence, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After blocking with 5% BSA for 30 min, the primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4 °C. On the second day, a fluorescent secondary antibody was applied in the shade at room temperature for 1 h. After elution, slides were sealed with an anti-quenching agent containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for further image acquisition using a Leica confocal microscope.

The slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). IHC studies were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. After retrieval using a universal retrieval buffer, the slides were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The next day, slides were rinsed and incubated with the respective secondary antibody. Images were photographed using a Leica confocal microscope. The antibodies used in IHC staining were as follows: Ki67 (CST, 9449, 1:300), ARID1A (CST, #12354S, 1:1,000), c-MYC (CST, #5605, 1:300), PARP1 (Active Motif, #39559, 1:500), RAD51 (Abcam, ab133534, 1:200), and γH2AX (Ser 139 Quantification and statistical analysis The band intensities from the Western blot were quantified by gray value by area using ImageJ software. To quantify the IHC staining of SCLC specimens, the signals were quantified by integrated optical density (IOD), equal to optical density by area, using Image Pro Plus software.
