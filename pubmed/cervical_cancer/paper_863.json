Although SPMs following multiple myeloma (MM) have been studied, data on second primary multiple myeloma (SPMM) remain limited. This study aimed to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of SPMM with those of primary MM through a retrospective analysis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 183 patients with primary MM and 12 patients with SPMM treated at a single center between 2003 and 2022. To reduce selection bias, propensity score matching (1:3) was performed based on age, sex, year of MM diagnosis, and International Staging System stage. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. Results: After matching, 48 patients (36 with primary MM and 12 with SPMM) were included in the final analysis. At the time of MM diagnosis, 83.3% of patients with SPMM had achieved complete remission of their primary malignancy. All but one received standard MM treatment. The median overall survival (OS) was 45.1 months for the primary MM group and 41.5 months for the SPMM group. There was no statistically significant difference in OS between the groups (hazard ratio: 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.33-1.56). Conclusions: Patients with SPMM, most of whom had well-controlled primary cancers, received active treatment and demonstrated clinical outcomes not significantly different from those with primary MM. These findings support the use of aggressive treatment strategies for SPMM. Larger prospective studies are warranted to establish optimal treatment strategies.

As long-term survival becomes more common, attention has increasingly shifted toward the late effects of cancer treatment, particularly the development of second primary malignancies (SPMs). SPMs are defined as distinct neoplasms that occur either synchronously or metachronously in individuals who have survived a first primary malignancy.  1 2 5 Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant plasma cell disorder, with approximately 160,000 new cases and 106,000 deaths estimated annually, worldwide.  6  7 8 9 The development of SPMs in MM survivors has been increasingly recognized. Identified risk factors include patient-related characteristics (for example, older age, smoking history, obesity, male sex, and ethnicity), disease-related mechanisms (notably clonal hematopoiesis), and treatment-related exposures (e.g., alkylating agents, radiation therapy, lenalidomide, and bortezomib). 10 11 12 14 15 16 Methods Study design and patient selection We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients diagnosed and treated for MM at Korea Cancer Center Hospital between January 2003 and December 2022. Eligible cases were selected consecutively during the study period based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Primary MM was defined as a pathologically confirmed diagnosis of MM. SPMM was defined as MM diagnosed either synchronously or metachronously in individuals with a history of a prior primary malignancy. Patients without pathological confirmation or those diagnosed without a treatment plan were excluded. Patients with missing data for key variables were excluded from the corresponding analyses. In total, 183 patients with primary MM and 12 patients with SPMM were included in the study. This study adheres to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines for observational studies. A completed STROBE checklist is provided as Supplementary File 1  17 Propensity score matching and statistical analysis To reduce potential confounding and improve comparability between the 2 groups, propensity score matching was performed using a 1:3 nearest-neighbor algorithm without replacement and with a caliper width of 0.1. The propensity scores were calculated based on sex, age, year of MM diagnosis, and International Staging System (ISS) stage. Balance between groups before and after matching was assessed using absolute standardized mean differences (SMDs), with values below 0.1 indicating acceptable balance.  18 Outcome measures The primary objective of this study was to compare the clinical characteristics and survival outcomes between patients with primary MM and those with SPMM. Treatment response was assessed according to the criteria established by the International Myeloma Working Group. 19 20 Results Study cohort and baseline characteristics Between January 2003 and December 2022, 183 patients were diagnosed with primary MM and received treatment planning. Twelve patients developed SPMM following a prior malignancy. After 1:3 propensity score matching, 36 patients with primary MM were selected, resulting in a final cohort of 48 patients for analysis ( Figure 1 Table 1 Figure 1.

Discussion Second primary multiple myeloma remains a relatively underexplored clinical entity, with most existing data derived from small, retrospective studies. In this study, 12 patients were diagnosed with SPMM over the study period. Notably, 10 of these patients had achieved CR of their primary malignancy at the time of SPMM diagnosis. All but one patient received active treatment (chemotherapy) for MM, indicating that SPMM was managed with therapeutic intent. Importantly, no statistically significant difference in OS was observed between patients with primary MM and SPMM, suggesting that SPMM may share similar clinical characteristics and prognosis with primary MM. However, this finding should be interpreted cautiously, as the small sample size may have limited the ability to detect statistically significant differences. Previous studies have primarily focused on SPMs arising after treatment for MM, identifying several associated risk factors such as age, smoking, and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), as well as specific therapeutic agents.  11 21 22  22 In contrast, only a few studies have investigated SPMM, which appears to be associated with relatively longer OS compared with other SPMs. One previous study found that most primary malignancies occurred before MM diagnosis and were predominantly early-stage neoplasms with favorable outcomes. In addition, the median OS differed significantly based on the presence of a prior malignancy (36.5 vs 21.4 months).  15  16 In our study, most patients had achieved CR of their primary malignancy at the time of SPMM diagnosis, and all but one received active treatment for SPMM. Although guidelines provide specific recommendations, such as CPX-351 for therapy-related AML, no standardized treatment protocols have been established for SPMM.  23 Currently, quadruplet regimens that include monoclonal antibodies are recommended for newly diagnosed MM.  24 Our study has certain limitations. First, it is a retrospective analysis with a relatively small cohort. Second, the limited sample size precluded the use of multivariate analysis to identify independent risk factors for SPMM. Moreover, no formal sample size calculation was performed prior to the analysis, which may have further limited the statistical power to detect significant differences between groups. Third, owing to the unavailability of fluorescence in situ hybridization and complete cytogenetic data in many cases, risk stratification was constrained. A fourth limitation of our study is the absence of a universally accepted definition of SPMM. We adopted a definition based on previously reported criteria for second primary cancers. However, this may introduce variability in interpretation and limit comparability across studies. Finally, although propensity score matching was performed to account for changes in Korea’s national insurance policy over the 20-year study period, it was not possible to fully adjust for all relevant variables, such as the approval of novel therapeutic agents for reimbursement and changes in age eligibility criteria for ASCT. These factors may have contributed to differences in OS. Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, this is the first study in Korea to compare the clinical characteristics of SPMM with those of primary MM. Another important consideration is the small sample size in both our study and previous studies, which may have limited the ability to detect statistically significant differences. Although propensity score matching was employed to minimize the effects of confounding variables, residual imbalances, such as differences in cytogenetic abnormalities and hypoalbuminemia ( Table 2 Conclusion Our findings suggest that actively treated patients with SPMM did not show significantly different clinical outcomes compared with those with primary MM. The remission status of their primary malignancies may have enabled this therapeutic approach. As treatment strategies for MM develop, active management of SPMM may be appropriate in selected cases. Further prospective studies are needed to better define optimal treatment strategies.
