Introduction It has been estimated that nearly 60,000 individuals (specifically 59,660) will be diagnosed with head and neck cancer (HNC) in the United States in 2025, with the vast majority of cases representing squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This burden will translate into approximately 12,770 cancer-related deaths over the same period [ 1 2 3 Traditionally, the most recognized etiological factors for HNSCC have been tobacco use and chronic alcohol consumption [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 10 13 14 15 16 17 18 18 19 14 20 21 22 23 24 In fact, the recognition of HR HPV infection as a strong predictive and prognostic factor in OPSCC has led to its incorporation into the TNM classification, effectively distinguishing HPV-positive tumors from HPV-negative tumors as biologically and clinically distinct entities. This distinction has, in turn, driven the growing interest in treatment deintensification strategies. Among the options for treatment deintensification, transoral surgery, in particular using surgical robots (TORS: transoral robotic surgery), is currently increasing in popularity; in selected HPV-positive patients [ 25 For this reason, most of the cases in the recent series describing the advantages of TORS in OPSCCs are HPV+ primary cases [ 26 27 28 29 However, treatment deintensification through TORS on primary OPSCC should still be validated in ongoing clinical trials and compared with other strategies [ 23 On the other hand, even if the comparison between external approaches and TORS in the management of recurrent OPSCC has been less extensively evaluated, similar oncological outcomes, but markedly lower complication rates and long-term morbidity in patients treated through TORS have been reported [ 30 The aim of the present study was to verify these last figures in our preliminary clinical experience concerning recurrent squamous cell carcinomas at the base of the tongue (BoT), and to outline, using the available literature data, specific, rational and oncologically safe indications for TORS in such a salvage setting. The homogeneity of the series (all cases were post-irradiation recurrences at the base of tongue) allowed us to reduce biases deriving from different patterns of spread/surgical techniques as well as adjuvant treatments. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patient Characteristics All the patients previously treated for OPSCC using primary radiochemotherapy at Policlinico Gemelli, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, and diagnosed with recurrence at the BoT between September 2013 and September 2014, who underwent salvage TORS were included. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. All the head and neck cancer patients were evaluated by a multidisciplinary head and neck tumor board, comprising otolaryngologists, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, radiologists, nuclear medicine specialists, and plastic surgeons, which managed every clinical recommendation through the thorough evaluation of acquired clinical and imaging data. 2.2. Diagnostic Work-Up All the patients underwent early diagnosis of the recurrence in a multidisciplinary head and neck follow-up ambulatory of the institution. In all cases, the recurrence was first suspected at the physical examination by the otolaryngologists and was histologically confirmed after a complete imaging work-up, including a PET-CT and an MRI. The therapeutic recommendation, based on the criteria described in Table 1 30 2.3. Surgery The transoral robotic surgery (TORS) procedure employed in our series generally followed the approach described by Moore et al. [ 31 Figure 1 General anesthesia was managed with a neuromuscular blockade specifically induced to facilitate transoral exposure. Initial setup involved dental protection and the insertion of a mouth gag to adequately expose the oropharyngeal lesion. Once exposure was confirmed, the Da Vinci Si Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was deployed on the patient’s left side. A 30° dual-channel endoscope was inserted to provide a panoramic view of the tumor field. The left robotic arm was fitted with a 5 mm EndoWrist Schertel grasper (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.), while the right robotic arm carried a 5 mm monopolar spatula cautery instrument. Both robotic arms were advanced carefully under direct vision. The retractor blade was gently positioned in an anterior direction to ensure optimal visualization of the tumor’s anterior margin and to expose the inferior extent of the neoplasm as fully as possible. Mucosal incisions were initiated at the anterior border of the lesion to facilitate posterior displacement into the endoscopic field. An additional incision was placed at the paramedian line to permit the resection of part of the contralateral BoT, allowing for broader oncologic margins. These steps also exposed the hyoid bone without provoking significant hemorrhage. Once anterior and medial incisions were completed, the robotic retractor was employed to grasp healthy tissue at the anterior edge of the specimen, applying countertraction that greatly assisted in the dissection of the remaining tumor. The precise trajectory of the surgical cuts was determined by tumor extent. Resection proceeded through adjacent soft tissues that appeared to be normal upon inspection in order to achieve complete excision. The surgical field included the removal of the ipsilateral palatine tonsil. The hypoglossal nerve was always preserved. Thanks to the enhanced maneuverability afforded by robotic instrumentation which is particularly advantageous for accessing the tongue base and for manipulating the tumor in various planes, and to the magnified 30° endoscopic visualization, the entire tumor could always be resected en bloc 2.4. Outcomes All clinical and pathological staging parameters were extracted from medical records and histopathological reports. Oncological outcomes were assessed from the date of salvage surgery and included overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and relapse-free survival (RFS). Information on treatment-related toxicities—encompassing both short-term surgical complications and long-term sequelae—was also collected from patient records. Particular attention was given to functional outcomes, with data retrieved on swallowing function, the need for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), and tracheostomy dependence. When available, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were also analyzed, especially regarding dysphagia, using the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory. 2.5. Ethical Considerations The current study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. According to the policies of our institutions, this case series did not require Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversight. This exemption is based on the fact that the patients were not subjected to any procedure with prior research intent, the series does not involve systematic investigation methods such as statistical analysis, and the report simply describes noteworthy clinical treatments, presentations, or outcomes. Additionally, no identifiable patient information has been included. Since the data were analyzed with a retrospective design, in this case, mandatory ethical approval is not required under Italian law (GU No 76; 31 March 2008). 3. Results Four patients corresponded to the inclusion criteria and were included in the selected period. Patient and tumor characteristics, together with oncological and functional outcomes, are shown in Table 2 All the surgeries resulted as R0 (negative margins) at the final histopathology report. For this reason, and considering the previous full dose of radiochemotherapy, further adjuvant treatment was never recommended by the tumor board in the present series. None of the patients were lost to follow up, and none of the patients showed distant metastases. Three out of four cases obtained locoregional control. Two are currently alive with no evidence of the primary oropharyngeal disease, one of them is currently undergoing therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors for a second primary tumor (lung adenocarcinoma), one died due to intercurrent cardiovascular disease 6 years after the procedure with no evidence of disease, and one case died of recurrent disease after a second transmandibular salvage. The HPV positivity rate in this small series was 25% (Case 1, Figure 1 No significant postoperative complications nor long-term sequelae have been recorded. The cuffed cannula was substituted in all patients with a cuffless cannula (with a cap) within the 4th postoperative day, and in all cases, the temporary tracheostomy underwent closure within the 10th postoperative day. All patients reported oral feeding without limitations compared with the pre-salvage status, at 1 month after the robotic resection. None of the survivors experienced drastic swallowing or breathing impairment requiring gastrostomy and/or a new tracheotomy. 4. Discussion The main limitation of the present study is clearly the very small sample size. Other limitations that detract from the possibility to draw definitive conclusions which lead us to consider our results as preliminary include the absence of comparison group(s) and the retrospective design with relative potential selection bias. However, the results of the present preliminary series of salvage TORS for recurrent OPSCC at the BoT are extremely encouraging and consistent with the literature [ 30 The most popular indication to TORS in OPSCC is currently the primary HPV+ lesion, with the aim/justification of deintensification, which should still be validated in ongoing clinical trials and compared with other strategies [ 23 In particular, some critical questions still need to be answered before really considering TORS as the standard of care for primary HPV + OPSCC: Is treatment deintensification through primary surgery rational for treating notoriously radiosensitive malignancies, such as HPV-related OPSCC? Is the survival obtained through TORS in this group really equivalent to that obtained with chemoradiation? In case of recurrence, is the pattern of spread of the recurrence and therefore the salvageability of patients previously treated through TORS similar to that of those who exclusively underwent radiation? How many OPSCC patients treated through TORS will require adjuvant treatment? Is the long-term toxicity from a single modality treatment, even at higher doses, really greater than that from a combined treatment? In fact, the last question has been addressed by the Orator 1 randomized trial, with inconclusive findings, while the first one has been addressed by the Orator 2 randomized trial which has been interrupted for excessive acute morbidity (perioperative deaths) in the surgical arm [ 32 Instead, a situation, as in the present series, in which transoral surgery, particularly TORS, would otherwise require a more invasive alternative, characterized by much greater morbidity, is the recurrence after primary radiochemotherapy [ 33 20 34 35 30 36 37 Our study confirms TORS as a valid alternative from an oncological point of view. However, in oncologic surgery involving the head and neck as well as other sites in humans, the precise recommendation and meticulous planning, relying on shared and evidence-based guidelines, are clearly the most decisive parameters for success. In the present study, we analyzed recurrences/persistence of SCCs at the BoT of individuals primarily treated using radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy). This situation could occur in 25 to 50% of primarily irradiated OPSCC (strongly depending on the HPV positivity rate), which, as described above, is one of the most frequent head and neck malignancies and is certainly the condition with the clearest increase in incidence in head and neck oncology. Thus, as clinicians will often encounter such situations, the critical issue is to provide reliable criteria for choosing the proper salvage surgery, which, when feasible, is likely the only remaining possibility to save these patients. In some cases, TORS might be an oncologically safe option [ 30 38 28 39 40 Most TORS procedures described in the literature have been performed for primary cases [ 26 27 21 30 27 41 The series described in the retrospective study of White et al. included both post-irradiation and post-surgical salvages in the whole oropharynx, without specifying the subsite. In contrast, the present small series includes only post-irradiation recurrences centered on the BoT, which are the most frequently amenable to TORS [ 30 In general, these cases can be more frequently safely salvaged through TORS than recurrences in other subsites (particularly in the tonsil) for anatomical reasons (internal the and common carotid are farther, and it is often possible to obtain wider margins following the described planes of dissection), and for more predictable and relatively constant patterns of spread than in post-surgical relapses. Therefore, the present small but homogeneous series, with relatively typical and clearly defined features, seems particularly suitable to discuss the selection criteria for salvage TORS. Some of these criteria are obvious and have practically been constantly adopted and described in the literature [ 30 42 43 Table 1 Other principles, such as the need to preserve at least one lingual artery in the procedure, are completely shareable, but this fact does not necessarily imply that resecting a BoT SCC crossing the midline is always contraindicated. Indeed, tumor proximity with both lingual arteries during surgery places the tongue at risk of devascularization especially in previously irradiated cases [ 44 Table 2 Table 1 In providing our recommendation to salvage TORS, we ultimately relied on the diagnostic work-up and restaging of the recurrence, but not on the primary lesion. This issue has never been specifically addressed in previous studies, but in our opinion it is crucial; indeed, if we accept that the recommendation is based on the rT, we could use TORS to treat small recurrences/residuals from bulky primary lesions with a good but not complete response to radiotherapy, and in these patients, as in the present series, we could expect relatively high survival rates and good functional outcomes. The risk of further recurrences and failure due to subclinical multifocal residual disease can be decreased through seriate preoperative biopsies also in areas that are apparently free of disease after irradiation but are involved at primary clinical presentation. We believe that the role of frozen sections should be limited as much as possible, while “histological mapping” with definitive reports for the discussion at the tumor board should be included in the preoperatory work-up for use in therapeutic decisions and surgical planning.
