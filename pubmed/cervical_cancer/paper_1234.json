Introduction Seaweed comprises algae which have been used in different industries and cultures as foods, cosmetics and nutraceuticals. Their uses have been described in a number of different parts of the world including Asia (e.g., China, Japan and Korea), Europe (e.g., Austria, Germany and Britain) and North America (e.g., United States and Canada), among others [ 1 2 3 1 4 5 In addition to its environmental benefits, there are also health benefits [ 6 7 2 8 9 This paper provides a narrative review of the potential therapeutic and nutraceutical importance of seaweed and algae, with a particular emphasis on extracts isolated from species which are members of the genus Sargassum 2. Algae Algae are photosynthetic autotrophic organisms that first appeared on Earth around 1.6–1.7 billion years ago and are currently responsible for around half of the fixation of carbon dioxide which takes place on the planet [ 10 11 12 13 Globally, there are around 9200 reported species of macroalgae, comprising approximately 6000 red algae, 2000 brown algae and 1200 green algae [ 14 2 2 15 16 17 18 1 2 3 5 6 7 9 14 17 12 10 14 3 Like terrestrial plants, algae do not have an immune system and rely on the production of phytochemicals to protect themselves from factors such as predators, tissue damage, ultraviolet light, desiccation and salinity [ 16 14 19 20 Specific to seaweeds, their main components are carbohydrates, which constitute around 50–60% of their weight [ 21 22 11 23 15 1 Algae have a low lipid content, typically in the range of 1.5–3%, with most of the lipids containing polyunsaturated fatty acids such as omega 3 and omega 6 [ 21 24 21 3. Sargassum Sargassum 25 Sargassum 26 Sargassum 27 More recently, in molecular investigations, the use of DNA markers led to an alternative approach to classification [ 27 Arthrophycus Bactrophycus Sargassum Phyllotrichia 27 Given the wide range of different ecological niches occupied by species within the genus, and the range of roles these species play, it is not surprising that they produce a wide range of different bioactive metabolites, with many of these attracting industrial interest. However, this interest has to be treated with a degree of caution due to the fact that many of the species have high heavy metal content, which can present health challenges for roles such as medicinal or nutritional uses. Examples of properties, together with examples of species showing these properties, are summarized in Table 1 Sargassum Sargassum 28 29 30 Sargassum 18 Sargassum 31 32 Recently, some Sargassum S. fluitans S. natans 28 29 S. horneri 33 Sargassum Sargassum 25 34 Sargassum 54 55 Sargassum 56 The effects of extracts of Sargassum Cicer arietinum 57 Gracilaria Sargassum 54 There are other examples of using species from the Sargassum S. muticum Capsicum annuum 58 However, attempts to use Sargassum 59 In addition to having been investigated for potential benefits to growth in plants, work has been carried out to determine if Sargassum 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 However, in terms of a role in animal feeds, the use of Sargassum Sargassum 60 Sargassum 61 62 Association of heavy metals with Sargassum Sargassum Sargassum 44 63 64 45 Sargassum 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 However, in most cases involving in vivo treatments, no attempt was made to reduce the heavy metal content before evaluating their physiological effects. Rather surprisingly, no toxicity has been reported. In fact, as can be seen in Table 2 65 S. fusiforme S. fusiforme 66 S. liebmannii Although no toxicity, due to arsenic’s potential to cause health damage, has been reported from administering Sargassum Sargassum 48 S. fusiforme 50 Although there are reports on the use of treatments to reduce the arsenic concentration in Sargassum 67 S. fusiforme marinedrugs-23-00343-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Physiological effect of Sargassum Species Model Diet Period Results Reference(s)  S. fusiforme Alzheimer rat model APPswePS1ΔE 9 Supplemented 50% ( w w 10 Reduced cholesterol precursors levels, cholesterol metabolites in serum and cerebellum [ 65  S. fusiforme Male C57BL/6 mice 5000 mg/kg 2 No toxicity observed in acute toxicity test [ 68  S. fusiforme Male C57BL/6 mice 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg 10 No toxicity observed in long-term study [ 68  S. fusiforme Male C57BL/6 mice High-fat diet supplemented with 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg 10 Reduced weight gain [ 68  S. horneri Male C57BL/6 mice High-fat diet supplemented with 2% w w w w 13 Reduced weight gain [ 69  S. siliquosum Male Wistar rats High-fat diet supplemented with 5% w w 16 Decreased fat mass, abdominal fat and fat vacuoles in the liver [ 70  S. liebmannii Male C57BL/6 mice 0.5 g/kg, 1 g/kg and 10 g/kg 7 days Toxicity not observed (LD50) [ 47  S. liebmannii Sprague Dawley rats Normal diet supplemented with 20% w w 77 days Toxicity not observed in sub-chronic toxicity test [ 47 4. Therapeutic and Nutraceutical Applications There are multiple potentially commercially important uses for Sargassum 4.1. Anti-Inflammatory Activity Ethanol extraction from algae can be used as a method to isolate lipids as well as a number of bioactive compounds. When Sargassum miyabei 51 Sargassum polycistum 71 Anti-inflammatory properties of Sargassum S. fulvellum 72 2 72 Danio rerio When the anti-inflammatory activities of lipid extracts of S. ilicifolium Escherichia coli 73 57 2 74 In terms of molecular effects on cells, polysaccharides from S. thunbergii 75 S. horneri 76 S. swartziiy 2 59 77 S. siliquosum 78 Sargassum S. horneri 79 In addition to in vitro work, in vivo analysis has also been performed. For example, DBA/1J mice with bovine collagen type II-induced arthritis, an anti-inflammatory effect of an S. muticum 80 S. fusiforme Lactobacillus acidophilus 81 S. fusiforme The fucoidan fraction JHCF4, which is known to be an antioxidant [ 82 Hizikia fusiformis S. fusiforme 83 2 When structure–function relationships of sulfated polysaccharides from S. carpophyllum Thus, there is anti-inflammatory potential available with extracts from a number of different species within the genus Sargassum 4.2. Antioxidant Activity Oxidative stress occurs due to the imbalance between the production and accumulation of free radicals, generating damage at the cellular level [ 84 Drosophila melanogaster S. fusiforme 85 85 S. serratifolium 86 Different methods of extracting antioxidants have been described. One example of this involved studying four different extraction methods of S. hystrix 84 S. polycystum 87 S. polycystum In a study of the antioxidant capacity of some polyphenols from different species, it was found that S. thunbergii S. miyabei 88 Sargassum Pediococcus acidilactici Weisella paramesenteroides Pediococcus pentosaceus Enterococcus faecium 89 E. faecium An extract of phlorotannins (polyphenolic compounds) from S. linifolium 90 91 S. binderi 92 In addition to work with rats, further in vivo work was carried out with yellow catfish ( Pelteobagrus fulvidraco Sargassum kjellmanianum Sargassum kjellmanianum 93 Polysaccharides were obtained after fermentation of S. fusiforme Lactobacillus rhamnosus 94 Further examples exist of the use of fermentation with bacteria to help increase free radical scavenging capacity. For example, fermentation of S. horneri Lactiplantibacillus pentosus 95 2 2 As was seen when looking at the anti-inflammatory potential, it is also clear that a number of molecules have the potential to act as antioxidants. Likewise, these molecules have been reported in a range of different species within the genus. 4.3. Antiviral Activity The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has increased the current level of studies into compounds which can act as antiviral drugs and provide antiviral treatments. Certain polysaccharides from brown algae, especially fucoidans, are known to have antiviral activity through studies of multiple molecular pathways [ 96 However, the potential use of the effects of Sargassum S. fusiforme 73 Sargassum 97 Other examples of the use of polysaccharides from Sargassum S. henslowianum 98 Sargassum naozhouense S. ilicifolium Gambusia affinis 99 Several recent studies reinforce the pharmacological value of the Sargassum 100 S. siliquastrum 101 101 S. euryphyllum 102 S. fusiforme 2 3 103 Hence, in terms of antiviral properties, several different extracts from a number of species within the Sargassum 4.4. Antibacterial Activity Currently, antibiotic resistance is a potentially serious global problem, which has prompted interest in trying to identify other types of agents with antimicrobial properties as replacements [ 104 Sargassum 105 An in vivo study was conducted using zinc nanoparticles from S. wightii Bacillus subtilis Staphylococcus aureus Shigella sonnei Pseudomonas aeruginosa 106 S. crassifolium Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 107 S. tenerrimum Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pyogenes Mycobacterium tuberculosis Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antimicrobial activity of a fraction of fucoidan from S. polycystum Streptococcus mutans Pseudomonas aeruginosa Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli 108 Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pseudomonas aeruginosa S. aquifolium 109 Sargassum Sargassum S. tenerrimum Escherichia coli 110 S. crassifolium Escherichia coli 105 New research highlights strategies based on nanomaterials and Sargassum S. tenerrimum Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterococcus faecalis 111 S. cymosum Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli P. aeruginosa 112 A further example of this was where the ethanolic extract of S. carpophyllum Pseudomonas 113 Therefore, several different compounds with the potential to act as antibacterial agents have been identified. These come from a number of different species within the genus and have antibacterial potential against a range of species, encompassing both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. 4.5. Prebiotic Activity Recently, the importance of intestinal health and the maintenance of the intestinal microbiota represent a factor for the decrease in various diseases related or not to the digestive system [ 114 115 Sargassum 116 117 A study investigating seaweed and its bioactive compounds, with an emphasis on polysaccharides, claimed that these can be used as a great dietary supplement with benefits for intestinal health [ 118 119 Fu et al. [ 120 S. thunbergii 94 Mesocricetus auratus S. confusum 121 The effect of polysaccharides extracted from S. fusiforme 122 Sargassum Calcium alginate was extracted from S. fusiforme 123 Bacteroides Bacteroides Akkermansia Alloprevotella Weissella Enterorhabdus Helicobacter Recent evidence confirms that various polysaccharides and fibers from Sargassum Sargassum fusiforme Bifidobacterium Faecalibacterium 124 S. horneri Lactobacillus Bacteroides 125 S. fusiforme Akkermansia muciniphila 81 Thus, inclusion of extracts from Sargassum 4.6. Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases Obesity is a metabolic disorder caused by excessive accumulation of fat in the body [ 126 S. horneri 96 Sargassum Sargassum Sargassum 69 A study of S. horneri 127 Sargassum When Syrian golden hamsters were fed with high amounts of lipids and sucrose and treated with S. confusum 121 S. siliquosum Sargassum 70 Another example involved looking at arterial hypertension in an in vivo study using bioactive peptides from S. maclurei 128 Sargassum A recent study confirmed that fermentation enhances the metabolic effect of S. horneri 95 Lactiplantibacillus pentosus S. fusiforme S. fusiforme Fucus vesiculosus 129 S. plagiophyllum 130 4.7. Anticancer Activity The antimetastatic and antiproliferative effects of fucoidan extracted from S. fusiforme 131 The antiproliferative and antiapoptotic effect of polysaccharides extracted from S. polycystum 132 The anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects of fucoidan extracted from S. fusiforme 133 When the antimetastatic effect of fucoidan extracted from S. hemiphyllum 134 The anticancer capacity of S. fluitans 135 I C 50 Emerging evidence suggests that Sargassum S. cinereum 136 S. muticum 137 50 0 1 Thus, in terms of potential anti-cancer treatment, a number of molecules isolated from Sargassum 4.8. Neuroprotective Activity Sargassum 65 Asparagus racemosus Azadirachta indica Cassia fistula Curcuma aromatica Datura metel Piper retrofractum Senna tora Terminalia chebula Sargassum fusiforme Sargassum Sargassum fusiforme w w Sargassum Abcg1 Scd1 Sargassum fusifome Sargassum fusiforme S. swartzii 138 S. swartzii The anticholinesterase capacity of sasgacromenol and sargaquinoic acid extracted from S. sagamianum 139 140 The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory capacity of the ethanolic extract of S. thunbergii 141 105 Recent studies indicate that various compounds derived from Sargassum S. oligocystum 142 A β 25 − 35 In an APPswePS1ΔE9 transgenic model of Alzheimer’s disease, dietary supplementation with a standardized brown seaweed extract including Sargassum 143 144 Thus, extracts from Sargassum 5. Conclusions In the face of climate change and the depletion of resources for food production, exploring sustainable alternatives has become essential. In this regard, macroalgae emerge as a promising option.
