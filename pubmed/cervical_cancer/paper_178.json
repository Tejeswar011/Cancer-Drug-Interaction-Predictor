Accumulating evidence has unveiled the significant involvement of lncRNAs in various cancers, where they are known to be a key factor for tumors’ statement changing, e.g., modulating proliferative, apoptotic, migratory and chemotherapy resistance in cells. In addition, lncRNAs are also regarded as potential diagnostic and prognostic tumor biomarkers. Studies have suggested that lncRNAs modulate biological processes by regulating linear RNA transcription and protein production. A recently discovered long non-coding RNA, SNHG3, is identified to have associations with cancer, which displays atypical expression patterns and functions as an oncogene in various cancers. Additionally, SNHG3 has been demonstrated to hold promise as a diagnostic biomarker and a tool for prognostic assessment in cancer patients. This review summarizes current knowledge about SNHG3’s expression, functional roles, molecular mechanisms, and implications for diagnosis and prognosis in human cancers.

However, the upstream regulatory mechanisms of SNHG3 remain far from being fully elucidated. To determine the factor responsible for increased SNHG3 expression in breast cancer, potential binding factors for the SNHG3 promoter region were predicted using JASPAR tools [ 10 A study [ 13 r r Platinum-based drugs combined with 5-fluorouracil are commonly used as the primary treatment for esophageal cancer, but platinum resistance often results in local recurrence and poor patient outcomes [ 35 16 SNHG3 functions in malignancies The research has manifested that numerous factors play a role in the onset and advancement of cancer, with key aspects being resistance to cell death, activation of pathways that lead to invasion and metastasis, and increased resistance to chemotherapy [ 36 1 SNHG3 in cell viability and proliferation In vitro gain- or loss- of function experiments have shown that SNHG3 plays a crucial role in cancer cell proliferation. SNHG3 was found to promote cell proliferation by facilitating cell cycle progress. In prostate cancer cells, decreasing SNHG3 expression reduced the number of cells in the S phase, while increasing SNHG3 expression accelerated cell cycle transition from the G0/G1 phase to the S phase [ 31 29 37 10 6 7 8 10 11 15 18 19 21 23 29 33 30 2 6 Cancer-related exosomes contribute to cancer progression [ 38 39 40  Table 2 In vivo functional characterization of SNHG3 in cancer Cancer type Cancer cell lines Animal Role in tumor growth Role in tumor metastasis References Bladder cancer 5637 BALB/c nude mice Promote – [ 6 T24 NOD-PrkdcscidIl2rgem1/Smoc mice Promote – [ 7 Breast cancer MCF-7 nude mice Promote – [ 11 MDA-MB-231 BALB/c nude mice Promote Promote liver metastasis [ 10 MCF-7 BALB/c nude mice Promote – [ 8 Colorectal cancer SW480 BALB/c nude mice Promote – [ 15 Gastric cancer HGC-27 BALB/c nude mice Promote – [ 18 SGC-7901 BALB/c mice mice Promote Promote lung metastasis [ 19 Glioma U-87-MG, U-251-MG BALB/c nude mice Promote – [ 21 Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma AMC-HN-8 BALB/c nude mice Promote – [ 23 Ovarian Cancer HeyA8 BALB/c nude mice Promote – [ 29 Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma BCPAP BALB/c nude mice Promote – [ 33 Prostate cancer PC-3 BALB/c nude mice – – [ 30 Du 145 BALB/c nude mice Promote – [ 31 SNHG3 in cell death Apoptosis, autophagic, and necrotic cell deaths are key mechanisms for cells to die [ 41 19 20 22 23 25 31 34 SNHG3 in cancer metastasis Metastasis is a common cause of cancer deaths [ 42 43 6 8 11 19 22 24 34 11 19 6 7 10 14 25 22 19 28 29 33 SNHG3 in cancer angiogenesis Angiogenesis is of essential importance in tumor formation, invasion, and metastasis, making it crucial for tumor progression. In vitro experiments show that reducing SNHG3 expression weakens bladder cancer cells’ ability to promote tube formation, while increasing SNHG3 promotes angiogenesis [ 7 Mechanisms underlying SNHG3’s effects in malignancies Studies show that some lncRNAs regulate cell processes by affecting epigenetic changes, influencing transcription and splicing, interacting with RNA-binding proteins, and working as miRNA sponges [ 44 1 2  Fig. 1 Upstream regulatory and downstream molecular mechanisms underlying SNHG3 in human cancers  Fig. 2 The regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of SNHG3 in multiple human cancers SNHG3 serves as a CeRNA Recent research on the ceRNA hypothesis has significantly contributed to the field of RNA biology by uncovering a novel RNA interaction mechanism.

However, most of the models were developed using bioinformatics approaches, further large prospective clinical cohorts are needed to verify the clinical utility of SNHG3. Moreover, to establish SNHG3 as a reliable diagnostic or prognostic tool, further research is needed to evaluate its expression, sensitivity, and stability in non-invasive body fluids. A prognostic model using four lipid metabolism-related lncRNAs was developed from the TCGA-LUAD dataset [ 51 n n GSE50081 n n GSE31210 GSE31210 To develop an oxidative phosphorylation-related gene signature, a seven-gene signature was established using LASSO Cox analysis in the TCGA-LUAD training dataset (522 samples) [ 52 p p GSE30219 p GSE30219 In another study [ 53 P P Another five-lncRNA prognostic signature was established in prostate cancer from TCGA database, and the prognostic risk score formula was calculated as follows: SNHG3 × 0.672549074 + LINC00857 × 0.453738256 + LINC00908 × (-1.24500487) LINC00900 × (-0.289510446) + FENDRR × 0.204942803 [ 54 n n P A risk score formula for gastric cancer prognosis prediction was created using RNA sequencing data from the TCGA database [ 55 n n P p P A prognostic model using eight glycolysis-related lncRNAs was developed for hepatocellular carcinoma using LASSO regression analysis in the TCGA database [ 56 P P P Concluding remarks Numerous studies have found that SNHG3 is frequently overexpressed and promotes cancer progression in multiple tumors. High SNHG3 expression level has been associated with advanced cancer stages and patient outcomes in various tumors, suggesting that SNHG3 levels could serve as a potential indicator for diagnosis or prognosis of different cancers. Nevertheless, a large number of in-house patients with RNA expression profiles and long-term follow-up data were need to verify the classification performance and survival prediction performance of the prediction models. SNHG3 is shown to impact cancer cell behavior, such as proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis, by influencing regulatory networks in cancer through interacting with RBPs or functioning as a ceRNA, and regulating protein levels. Targeting SNHG3 holds potential for cancer treatment. To date, several strategies have been developed to target lncRNAs, and approaches directed against SNHG3 are currently under development. (1) Small interfering RNA (siRNA): siRNA binds to lncRNAs via base complementarity, guiding the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to recognize and degrade the target transcript [ 57 8 24 25 58 59 60 7 61 62 63 64 65 In summary, this review offers a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of SNHG3 in human cancers and aims to provide new insights and perspectives to facilitate further advancements in this field of research.
