Because of its unique structure and ability to inhibit cancer cells, it has been changed in different ways to find out its pharmacological properties. This paper discusses the common chemical modifications of podophyllotoxin molecules, including the C-4 and E-4 site replacements. Furthermore, its common inhibitory effects on cancer cells and antiparasitic activities, among others, are outlined by the connection between conformational changes and pharmacological activities. Importantly, Podophyllotoxin can effectively overcome the phenomenon of multidrug resistance through a dual-targeting mechanism, including inhibition of microtubule protein synthesis and topoisomerase II activity, and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recent findings reveal its potential to modulate immune responses through the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, further extending beyond its classical mechanisms. This study finally provides a systematic summary of the activity of podophyllotoxin in common cancer cells, including those in the breast, lung, and prostate.

Created by ChemDraw (PerkinElmer, version 22.0, Waltham, MA, USA) Unlike the mechanism by which paclitaxel analogues block microtubule depolymerization, podopyllotoxin binds to the hydrophobic pocket of the β-tubulin subunit, inhibiting the conversion of microtubulin to microtubules and disrupting the dynamic equilibrium between microtubule tubules and microtubulin, thereby inhibiting the process of mitosis and arresting the cell cycle in G2/M phase. It is evident that the colchicine binding site is also present here [ 5 6 7 8 Fig. 2 Figure 2 Podophyllotoxin acts by inhibiting microtubule protein synthesis, topoisomerase II activity, and regulating various signaling pathways. Podophyllotoxin has dual anticancer mechanisms: the inhibition of microtubule assembly disrupts mitotic spindle formation, leading to G2/M cell cycle arrest; inhibition of topoisomerase II induces DNA double-strand breaks, resulting in genomic instability and cell death. These effects activate key signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival, collectively contributing to the therapeutic effects against various cancers, including breast, lung, prostate, gastric cancer, and leukemia.

Researchers apply the podophyllotoxin backbone to the synthesis of protein degradation targeting chimeras [ 9 Fig. 2 10 11 Despite the continuous progress and improvement in the treatment of cancer, cancer is still one of the most difficult problems in the world due to its difficult treatment, easy recurrence, and different physical conditions of patients. According to the World Health Organization, cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide, followed first one which is cardiovascular diseases [ 12 13 2 Conformational Relationships Podophyllotoxin is a polycyclic compound, consisting of four stereogenic centers and five rings (A–E) ( Fig. 3 Table 1 11 14 15 16 ′ 17 18 19 20 Figure 3 This figure shows the overall idea of structure modification, derivative design, and pharmacological activity study of podophyllotoxin as the core; different modification sites will have different biological activity changes.

Based on the extensively characterized cytotoxic properties of this natural lignan, researchers have focused on optimizing its efficacy, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties through strategic chemical modifications. Notably, derivatives featuring improved solubility, reduced systemic toxicity, and enhanced tumor-targeting capabilities are now progressing through various stages of clinical evaluation.

However, the high genetic heterogeneity of breast cancer and the poor response of some subtypes limit the generalization of this class of drugs. In the future, it can be combined with multi-target action as well as individualized therapy to achieve better clinical efficacy [ 34 3.2 Lung Cancer Lung cancer has two categories: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), is the second most common cancer [ 72 Fig. 5 73 74 Figure 5 Activity of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives in lung cancer.

Podophyllotoxin and its derivatives inhibit microtubule polymerization or stabilize microtubules, keep microtubules in a quiescent state, and block the normal microtubule depolymerization process, leading to cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, and ultimately inducing apoptosis. Created in https://BioRender.com The cell cycle is a continuous process of constant cycling, which is regulated by two key molecules, cell cycle proteins and cell cycle protein-dependent kinases (CDKs), and other inhibitory factors, and is divided into four phases, G1, S, G2 and M [ 103 104 106 Podophyllotoxin can play a key role in tumor cell proliferation, migration and programmed death by modulating several key signaling pathways that regulate cellular life activity.

Introducing different aromatic heterocycles, amino acids, sugar groups, and fatty acid substituents at key sites of the parent (e.g., C-4) to improve stability and water solubility, targeting selectivity, and to reduce autotoxicity, these modifications not only enhance cytotoxicity, but also potentiate podophyllotoxin inhibitory effects. Blocking the process of microtubule protein polymerization, inhibiting mitosis, arresting the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, and promoting the induction of apoptosis, it exhibits a variety of antitumor activities.
