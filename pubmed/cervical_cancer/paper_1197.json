Introduction Medicinal plants are valuable natural sources of phytocompounds with biological properties [ 1 Lythrum salicaria Lythraceae 2 3 Lythri herba 4 L. salicaria 2 3 5 6 7 3 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 3 6 9 15 16 8 14 17 8 18 19 5 20 10 12 21 L. salicaria 22 23 Polyphenols are considered a broad class of secondary plant metabolite and are typically divided into phenolic acids, flavonoids, tannins, lignans, and stilbenes, based on their chemical structures. About 8000 polyphenols are currently known [ 24 L. salicaria 5 5 25 25 3 5 25 5 3 5 9 20 25 3 5 8 9 25 5 9 3 5 9 25 5 8 25 19 25 26 27 28 25 19 25 26 27 28 26 27 28 27 28 L. salicaria 29 Polyphenols possess numerous biological activities, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, cardioprotective, and anticancer effects [ 24 30 31 L. salicaria 3 L. salicaria 32 In the context of the extensive use of plant-based products in therapy, their toxicity investigation is crucial [ 33 Drosophila melanogaster 34 Drosophila melanogaster 35 Drosophila melanogaster 34 In this background, the aim of our study was to investigate two extracts of L. salicaria Drosophila melanogaster Lythrum salicaria Drosophila melanogaster 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Chemicals Methanol, glycerin, acetic acid, DPPH, 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine (TPTZ), chloroform, and ammonium hydroxide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company, St. Louis, Missouri, USA. (+)-Catechin, cinnamic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, syringic acid, resveratrol, rutin, and quercetin standards were obtained from Dr. Ehrenstorfer GmbH, Augsburg, Germany. Phosphomolybdotungstic reagent (Folin–Ciocâlteu’s reagent), potassium persulfate, charcoal, agar powder, and saccharose were acquired from VWR Chemicals, Leuven, Belgium. Sodium carbonate, sodium acetate, ferric chloride, hydrochloric acid, and ascorbic acid were purchased from Chemical Company, Iași, Romania. Trolox, ABTS and nipagin were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific, Kandel, Germany. Ethanol was acquired from Chimreactiv S.R.L., Bucharest, Romania. 2.2. Plant Collection and Preparation L. salicaria Vascular Plants of Romania, illustrated field guide 36 2.3. Bioactive Compound Extraction The dried plant material was milled using a domestic electric grinder, until a powder was obtained. Then, two types of extracts were prepared. For the first extract (LSmet-1), 0.5 g of ground plant was mixed with 10 mL of solvent mixture (methanol/distilled water, 70:30, v v 37 38 Drosophila melanogaster v v 2.4. Phenolic Profile HPLC Analysis Phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in the extracts by HPLC-UV, using the SCL-40 HPLC apparatus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The method was adapted from previously described protocols [ 37 39 v v Figures S1–S3 Supplementary Materials, Table S1 2.5. Spectrophotometric Analysis 2.5.1. Total Polyphenol Content Assay To determine the TPC of the extracts, the Folin–Ciocâlteu method was adapted from Frum et al. (2022). A volume of 0.4 mL of extract, 1 mL of Folin–Ciocâlteu reagent, 10 mL of distilled water, and 2 mL of 290 g/L sodium carbonate solution were mixed in test tubes. After 10 min of shaking, the tubes were incubated into a water bath at 40 °C for 20 min. After cooling at room temperature, the absorbance was measured at 760 nm against a blank by using a Shimadzu UV 1900 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) [ 40 A calibration curve with concentrations between 0.86 and 8.57 μg gallic acid/mL was plotted. Triplicate analyses were performed for each sample. The results were expressed as mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/g dry plant. 2.5.2. Assessment of Antioxidant Capacity DPPH Assay To investigate the DPPH scavenging activity of the extracts, a method adapted from Georgescu et al. (2022) was conducted. A 25 μg/mL DPPH stock solution was prepared and left in the dark for 2 h before analysis. In a test tube, a volume of 1940 μL of DPPH stock solution was mixed with 60 μL of extract and kept in a dark place for 15 min. The absorbance was measured at 515 nm against a blank by using a Shimadzu UV 1900 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) [ 39 A calibration curve with concentrations between 0.5 and 25 μg DPPH/mL was plotted. Triplicate analyses were performed for each sample. The concentration of DPPH in the sample was calculated using Formula (1): (1) C s a m p l e = A s a m p l e  −  i s C s a m p l e i s The percentage of DPPH free radical scavenging activity (%RSA) was calculated using Formula (2): (2) % RSA  =  C s t o c k  −  C s a m p l e C s t o c k ∗ 100 C s t o k C s a m p l e FRAP Assay The reducing power of the extracts, which is correlated with their antioxidant activity, was evaluated by the FRAP assay, using a method adapted from Vicaș et al. (2015). The following stock solutions were prepared: 300 mM acetate buffer (pH = 3.6), 20 mM FeCl 3 3 41 A calibration curve with concentrations between 0.15 and 0.50 μmol trolox/mL was plotted. Triplicate analyses were performed for each sample. The results were expressed as μmol trolox equivalent (TE)/g dry plant. ABTS Assay To test the antioxidant activity of the extracts using the ABTS assay, a method adapted from Vicaș et al. (2015) was applied. Sixteen hours before analysis, a 2.45 mM potassium persulfate and 7 mM ABTS stock solution was prepared and kept in a dark place. After this period, the solution was diluted until an extinction of 0.70 ± 0.02 at 734 nm was reached. For the analysis, 25 μL of each plant extract was mixed with 2.5 mL of the diluted ABTS solution and then vortexed for 30 s to ensure proper mixing. Next, the extinction was measured at 734 nm against a blank by using a Shimadzu UV 1900 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) [ 41 A calibration curve with concentrations between 0.06 and 2.09 mmol trolox/L was plotted. Triplicate analyses were performed for each sample. The results were expressed as mmol TE/g dry plant. 2.6. In Vivo Drosophila melanogaster Viability Tests To study the in vivo effect of LSmet-3 extract on the viability of Drosophila melanogaster 42 The normal medium simulated a normal diet containing all necessary nutrients and was prepared as follows: in 1200 mL of distilled water, 70 g of yeast paste was added and stirred until homogeneous. In this mixture, 52 g of saccharose and 30 g of wheat flour were introduced and brought to a boil under continuous stirring, followed by the addition of 10 g of agar powder. After 30 min of boiling under continuous stirring, the mixture was cooled at 50 °C. Finally, 1 g of nipagin was dissolved to prevent mold contamination. The high-sugar medium was prepared similarly to the normal medium, except that a 0.75 M concentration of sucrose was used [ 42 Three concentrations of the LSmet-3 prepared as given in Section 2.3 Drosophila melanogaster 42 The tested Drosophila melanogaster w m4h w m4h 42 2.7. Drosophila melanogaster Eye Pigment Quantification To quantify eye pigments of Drosophila melanogaster w m4h 43 3 4 4 2.8. Statistical Analysis The results are expressed as the mean and standard deviation (SD) of three replicates. An independent sample t-test and one-way ANOVA (Tukey’s post hoc test) were performed to assess the significance of differences between means. All statistical tests were computed using IMB SPSS statistics for Windows, version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). 3. Results and Discussions 3.1. Phenolic Profile As presented in Table 1 Other researchers have also investigated the chemical composition of L. salicaria Lythrum salicaria 44 Bencsik et al. (2013) reported a comparable amount of gallic acid (166.3 μg/g) and a lower concentration of rutin (1.1 μg/g) in a hydro-ethanolic (50% ethanol) extract from Lythri herba 5 45 46 L. salicaria 6 L. salicaria 3 L. salicaria 14 Varga et al. (2020) investigated the composition of L. salicaria 7 47 48 Previous studies reported that L. salicaria 5 6 7 5 7 5 3.2. Polyphenol Content and Antioxidant Activity Table 2 L. salicaria The TPC was relatively higher in the hydro-methanolic extract than in the hydro-ethanolic extract because polyphenols are more soluble in methanol than in ethanol. Several studies have reported that polyphenol extraction using methanol as a solvent leads to a higher yield compared to ethanol [ 49 50 50 L. salicaria 8 Some authors suggest that a concentration above 20 mg GAE/g indicates that an extract could be considered rich in phenolic compounds; however, there is no universally established threshold beyond which the phenolic content is considered high [ 51 L. salicaria 52 51 L. salicaria 10 18 6 L. salicaria 12 The composition of the extracts varies depending on the collection areas and the methods used to extract the material [ 10 L. salicaria 53 L. salicaria L. salicaria 13 3 L. salicaria 32 Although the LSeth-2 extract had a lower content of phenolic compounds, its antioxidant activity was not significantly different from that of the LSmet-1 extract. This suggests that other substances from the extracts (for example, ascorbic acid) could exert an antioxidant effect. Nevertheless, Tunalier et al. (2007) observed a stronger DPPH scavenging effect for hydro-methanolic extract compared to methanolic and water extracts, as well as a moderate correlation between TPC and DPPH scavenging activity [ 8 L. salicaria 21 6 L. salicaria 9 10 L. salicaria 11 L. salicaria 12 54 14 According to Tian et al. (2021), the antioxidant capacity of flavonoids is positively correlated with the number of hydroxyl groups from their chemical structure; thus, the high antioxidant potential determined for the extracts analyzed may be due to the high concentration of quercetin, the compound with the most hydroxyl groups among the other flavonoids analyzed [ 55 3.3. In Vivo Drosophila melanogaster Viability Tests on Neutral and Normal Diets When considering a plant extract for therapeutic use, its potential toxicity should be evaluated using an in vivo model system in a concentration-dependent manner. In this regard, we have developed a system based on fruit flies and their diet that is suitable for detecting position-effect variegation (PEV). We can analyze the influence of specific nutrition on the biological effects of a given plant extract by applying three types of diets to individuals with identical genotypes and epigenomes. Furthermore, all the tested Drosophila Drosophila Drosophila In the case of the neutral diet that provides no nutrients to newly hatched Drosophila w m4h w w w w 56 57 58 59 On a neutral medium, larvae were observed on day 2 at a concentration of 4.76% LSmet-3, with day 0 considered the seeding day. By day 10, some larvae died, and by day 15, most were dead. By day 19, all the larvae died. This suggests that the LSmet-3 extract contained some nutrients but not enough to support the larva and pupal stages of the life cycle. At a concentration of 20% LSmet-3, first- and second-instar larvae were visible on day 3, with one pupa observed on day 12. At a concentration of 33.33% LSmet-3, first- and second-instar larvae were visible on day 6. No larvae were detected from the second day onwards at a concentration of 50% LSmet-3. It is therefore likely that the increasing LSmet-3 concentration in the neutral medium did not fully support the viability of Drosophila On a normal medium, concentrations of LSmet-3 extract ranging from 10 to 500 μL per 2 mL of normal medium significantly increased the larval viability of Drosophila melanogaster Figure 1 Figure 2 In addition to viability, the developmental timing of the LSmet-3 extract/normal-media-fed individuals was monitored. Clearly, there were no differences with respect to controls in the 10–100 µL concentration range (see Figure 2 These experiments demonstrated that supplementing a normal diet with LSmet-3 could have detrimental effects at high concentrations. This toxicity has variable strength, initially being associated with delayed larval and pupal development, though it does not affect viability. Ultimately, the further increasing concentrations of LSmet-3 induce a more pronounced developmental shift and, finally, complete lethality at the highest concentration. 3.4. The Relevance of the Hormetic Effect of LS Extracts An assessment of the effect of LSmet-3 extract concentration on the viability of Drosophila 60 61 Explaining the biphasic effect of the LSmet-3 extract is both challenging and puzzling. While the experiment is reproducible and the concentration dependence on the effects is evident, the relevance of the extract composition is worth considering. Previous research conducted by Ogunsuyi et al. (2020) had found no significant changes in survival rates of Drosophila melanogaster Drosophila melanogaster 62 Another study demonstrated that rutin exerts a hormetic effect that is responsible for lifespan extension in fruit flies. They reported that 200 and 400 μM of rutin significantly increased the median lifespan of Drosophila melanogaster 63 Regarding resveratrol, another component of the LS extract, other researchers observed that supplementing food with 200 μM resveratrol significantly increased the viability of larval and adult fruit flies compared to the control group. Additionally, no significant differences were reported for both lower (25, 50, and 100 μM) and higher (800 μM) concentrations, indicating that resveratrol could also generate a hormetic effect [ 64 In another study, the dose dependency of quercetin was monitored in Drosophila melanogaster 65 Interestingly, when the effects of resveratrol on Drosophila melanogaster 66 Another study by Iancu et al. (2021) investigated the water and alcohol extracts of L. salicaria Artemia salina 21 Artemia nauplii 67 Lythrum salicaria L. salicaria 12 3 L. salicaria 14 There is ample and mostly in vitro experimental evidence pointing towards the dose-dependent toxicity of various LS extracts, in addition to their beneficial physiological effects. However, the biphasic nature of the LS extracts requires further analysis. In this respect, in addition to the extract composition, the diet administered to the tested individuals could interfere with the expected beneficial effect. 3.5. In Vivo Drosophila melanogaster Viability Tests with High-Sugar Diet When the LSmet-3 extract was assessed on an HS diet, the toxic effect of the extract became more pronounced. In the case of a normal diet, the LSmet-3 extract showed increased viability within the 10–500 μL concentration range (see Figure 1 Figure 3 The results obtained suggest that the HS diet exacerbates the toxic effects of the LSmet-3 extract. At a concentration of 500 μL of the extract, no viable third-instar larvae or adults were detected. This suggests that the interaction between the HS diet and the LSmet-3 extract increases the level of toxicity. Nevertheless, this toxicity also features a developmental shift that becomes more pronounced at the concentration of 100 μL of LSmet-3 (see Figure 4 This developmental shift takes about five days, but almost all larvae entering the pupal stage complete metamorphosis, suggesting that toxicity is mostly linked to larval development-specific events. It has been reported that a high-sugar (HS) diet negatively impacts the development of Drosophila melanogaster 68 69 Drosophila melanogaster 42 These experiments tell us that special attention should be paid to any plant extract intended for therapeutic use since multiple interactions could emerge, and the concentration dependency of the interacting partners deserves a detailed evaluation. 3.6.

Conclusions The reported research focuses on the polyphenol content of extracts obtained from Lythrum salicaria Lythrum salicaria Low concentrations of the Lythrum salicaria Drosophila melanogaster Furthermore, similar experiments performed at HS dietary conditions showed the Lythrum salicaria Lythrum salicaria Drosophila melanogaster Lythrum salicaria Acknowledgments We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the Research Center in Biotechnology and Food Engineering (C.C.B.I.A.) and the Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu for their support provided throughout the research period.
