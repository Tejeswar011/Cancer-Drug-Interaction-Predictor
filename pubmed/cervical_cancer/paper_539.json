The clinical data of 1,118 patients with DTC who underwent surgical treatment at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University from June 2019 to June 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were categorized into two groups: the recurrence group and the non-recurrence group, based on the presence or absence of recurrence. A univariate analysis was conducted on the patient data, followed by a Cox multivariate analysis to identify the risk factors for recurrence in patients with DTC after surgery. Among the eligible patients with DTC, there were 865 females and 253 males, with ages ranging from 15 to 77 years. The follow-up period lasted between 36 and 60 months, during which 46 patients experienced a recurrence. The Cox multivariate regression model analysis indicated that male gender, tumor size, multifocal tumors, central lymph node metastasis, lateral neck lymph node metastasis, and BRAF V600E gene mutation were independent risk factors for the recurrence of DTC ( P P Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-18385-0.

Studies report recurrence rates as high as 10–30% over long-term follow-up 4 6 7 This study addressed gaps in the existing literature or confirmed previous findings through the following approaches:  Evaluating understudied risk factors—including multifocality, BRAF V600E mutation status, and the extent of gland resection—alongside conventional clinicopathological variables. Providing region-specific data from a large cohort in Xinjiang, China, where demographic and environmental factors may affect recurrence patterns. Developing a clinically actionable nomogram to quantify individualized recurrence risk, thereby enabling tailored surveillance and treatment. By integrating these elements, our work aims to enhance postoperative management strategies and reduce recurrence by enabling the early identification of high-risk patients. Results Analysis of recurrence The follow-up period extends from the day of the patient’s surgery until June 30, 2024, with a follow-up duration of 36 to 60 months. Among 1,118 cases of DTC patients, 46 cases experienced recurrence during the follow-up period, with the time interval from surgery to recurrence ranging from 3 to 59 months. Based on recurrence status, patients were categorized into two groups: the recurrence group (46 cases) and the non-recurrence group (1,072 cases). During the early postoperative period, the frequency of outpatient follow-up visits was relatively high. Visits were conducted at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after the operation. Laboratory blood tests were performed at 1 month and 3 months, and blood tests combined with ultrasound examinations were conducted at 6 months. Subsequently, telephone follow-ups were conducted every 3 months, and outpatient follow-ups were combined with blood tests and ultrasound examinations every 6 months. During the outpatient follow-ups, detailed physical examinations were also conducted for the patients. For patients with suspicious recurrence suggested by routine ultrasound, further puncture biopsy was performed. For patients with malignant pathology results from the puncture biopsy, secondary surgical treatment was carried out.The postoperative routine pathological diagnosis of malignancy confirmed the recurrence. For patients with confirmed recurrence, RAI treatment was evaluated. Endocrine treatment was more standardized. The follow-up frequency was higher than that of patients without recurrence within 1 year after the operation. After outpatient follow-up 1 month after surgery, outpatient follow-up every 3 months, blood sampling and ultrasound examination were performed, and the amount of TSH inhibition therapy was adjusted in time. 1 year later, telephone follow-up was performed every 3 months, and outpatient follow-up was performed every 6 months. Chi-square test for patients with DTC Patients in the recurrence group and the non-recurrence group exhibited statistically significant differences in gender, tumor diameter, number of tumor lesions, cervical lymph node metastasis status, local tumor invasion, extent of gland resection, BRAF V600E gene mutation, and postoperative serum Tg levels (all P P 1  Table 1 Comparison of basic information and clinical characteristics of patients [ M P P Variable Non-recurrence Recurrence Z/χ2  P Gender 7.460 0.006 Female 837(78.1) 28(60.9) Male 235(21.9) 18(39.1) Age of first operation 46(36,53) 41(36,51) -1.374 0.169 BMI 24(22,27) 25(22,27) -0.09 0.928 Tumor diameter 0.7(0.5,1.1) 1.7(1.3,2) -7.403 <0.001 Tumor location 3.540 0.060 Unilateral thyroid 767(71.5) 27(58.7) Bilateral thyroid 305(28.5) 19(41.3) Number of tumor lesions 1(1,2) 2(1,3) -3.627 <0.001 TNM stage 0.048 0.316 I, II 1064(99.3) 45(97.8) III, IV 8(0.7) 1(2.2) Central lymph node metastasis 24.004 <0.001 No 666(62.1) 12(26.1) Yes 406(37.9) 34(73.9) Lateral lymph node metastasis 69.217 <0.001 No 1003(93.6) 27(58.7) Yes 69(6.40) 19(41.3) Local invasion 7.325 0.007 No 978(91.2) 36(78.3) Yes 94(8.80) 10(21.7) Combined with HT 0.844 0.358 No 875(81.6) 40(87.0) Yes 197(18.4) 6(13.0) Extent of gland resection 8.690 0.013 Bilateral total thyroidectomy 738(68.8) 22(47.8) Subtotal thyroidectomy 57(5.40) 3(6.5) Unilateral lobectomy 277(25.8) 21(45.7) Radioiodine therapy 7.670 0.006 No 661(61.7) 19(41.3) Yes 411(38.3) 27(58.7) BRAF V600E gene expression 10.073 0.002 No 411(38.3) 7(15.2) Yes 661(61.7) 39(84.8) Preoperative serum TSH levels 2.34(1.58,3.52) 2.19(1.44,3.66) -0.156 0.876 Preoperative serum Tg levels 9.46(3.93,19.45) 7.07(2.97,18.16) -0.509 0.610 Preoperative serum Tgab levels 19.33(14.27,70.44) 16.29(12.72,38) -1.175 0.240 Preoperative serum TPOab levels 12.43(9,20.17) 13.9(9.95,21.49) -1.061 0.289 Postoperative serum TSH levels 0.98(0.23,2.79) 1.42(0.14,5.01) -0.623 0.534 Postoperative serum Tg levels 0.46(0.04,4.61) 4(0.81,11.26) -4.085 <0.001 Postoperative serum Tgab levels 19.22(14.55,47.95) 16.84(13.25,32.6) -1.408 0.159 Postoperative serum TPOab levels 12.35(9,20.27) 12.22(8.26,16.12) -1.211 0.226 Follow-up time 47(41,53.5) 31.5(11,49) -4.855 <0.001 *BMI: Body Mass Index. *HT: Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

Discussion The impact of gender on prognosis Studies have shown that the recurrence rate of thyroid cancer after surgery is higher in males than in females 8 9 10 11 The impact of tumor size and pathological stage on prognosis This study demonstrates that tumor diameter is an independent risk factor for the recurrence of DTC ( P 12 13 The impact of tumor multifocality, local invasion, and neck lymph node metastasis on prognosis Patients with multifocal and locally invasive DTC have a higher risk of central and lateral neck lymph node metastasis 14 15 16 P The impact of thyroidectomy extent on prognosis The extent of initial surgery for thyroid cancer has long been a subject of debate among experts. The latest guidelines in China recommend that patients with tumors larger than 4 cm in diameter, tumors larger than 1 cm located in the isthmus, positive surgical margins, visible extrathyroidal invasion, vascular invasion, bilateral multifocal lesions, clinical lymph node metastasis (number of nodes ≥ 5 or diameter ≥ 3 cm) or distant metastasis should undergo total or near-total thyroidectomy. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) recommends that patients with tumors larger than 4 cm, those exhibiting obvious extrathyroidal invasion, or those with confirmed lymph node metastasis should undergo total or near-total thyroidectomy 7 P 17 18 The impact of BRAF V600E gene mutation on prognosis V600E mutation is the most frequently observed alteration in the BRAF oncogene, exhibiting a high mutation rate 19 16 20 21 22 P The impact of HT on prognosis HT is negatively correlated with the aggressive pathological features of DTC; however, it does not significantly impact overall survival or disease-free survival in patients following surgery 23 24 25 P The impact of laboratory test results on prognosis Luca et al. established a decision tree model to predict the recurrence of DTC based on postoperative serum Tg levels 26 27 P While postoperative serum Tg showed statistical significance in our univariate chi-square test ( P Preoperative serum Tg, TSH, Tgab, and TPOab can be combined with relevant imaging examinations to assist in the diagnosis of thyroid tumors. Additionally, postoperative serum levels can aid in assessing prognosis, with serum Tg being a crucial indicator for monitoring residual thyroid tissue after total thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine ( 131 24 Clinical application of the nomogram The nomogram developed from our multivariate Cox regression model serves as a practical tool for assessing individualized recurrence risk in DTC patients. Clinicians can determine a patient’s probability of recurrence by summing the points assigned to key predictors. Please refer to Fig. 5  Fig. 5 Nomogram for recurrence risk in DTC patients. (To use it, locate each predictor variable, draw a vertical line to the “Points” axis to assign points, sum all points, and project the total to the “Linear Predictor” axes. Higher total points indicate increased recurrence risk.) Clinical Utility:  Risk Stratification: This process identifies high-risk patients (e.g., those with total points exceeding 100) who require intensive surveillance. As mentioned earlier, frequent follow-ups were conducted. Treatment Guidance: Provides support for decisions regarding bilateral resection or adjuvant RAI therapy in high-risk cases. (Current guidelines 7 Patient Counseling: Effectively conveys personalized recurrence risk through visual communication. Conclusions Combined with our data, the developed nomogram provides a clinically actionable tool for recurrence risk quantification. We recommend that high-risk patients with differentiated thyroid cancer—such as those with bilateral lymph node metastasis identified through imaging examinations, BRAF V600E gene mutations, and those with large tumor volumes and multifocal lesions revealed by rapid intraoperative pathological examination—be considered for bilateral thyroid lobectomy. The nomogram objectively identifies these high-risk profiles and quantifies how surgical choices influence recurrence probability. For the management of cervical lymph nodes, therapeutic cervical lymph node dissection is advised. A comprehensive perioperative evaluation should be conducted, and preoperative communication with patients must be prioritized. There are still some limitations in this experiment. First, the follow-up period in this study was limited to 36 to 60 months. Although this duration is sufficient to capture early recurrences, it may not be adequate for identifying late recurrences, which can occur many years after initial treatment. Longer follow-up periods are necessary to fully understand the long-term recurrence patterns and outcomes in DTC patients. Second, the study did not document the specific locations of tumor occurrences within the thyroid gland. The precise location of the tumor (e.g., upper pole, lower pole, isthmus) may influence the risk of recurrence and should be considered in future studies. Despite these limitations, the findings of this study contribute to the growing body of evidence regarding the risk factors for postoperative recurrence of DTC. Addressing these limitations in future research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of DTC recurrence and help refine clinical guidelines for the management and follow-up of DTC patients. Methods Selection and characteristics of the patients Based on the established inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 1,118 patients diagnosed with DTC after undergoing thyroid cancer surgery between June 2019 and June 2021 were included in this study with a follow-up period of 36 to 60 months (i.e., 3 to 5 years). **Inclusion criteria: ** 1)Patients with a postoperative pathological diagnosis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC); 2) Patients with complete clinical data who consented to participate in follow-up visits, either by telephone or in-person outpatient visits. **Exclusion criteria: ** (1) Pathological diagnosis of undifferentiated cancer, medullary cancer, or benign tumors; (2) Patients with concomitant malignant tumors at other sites or distant metastases to the liver, lungs, etc.; (3) Patients with incomplete clinical data, those who refused follow-up visits, or those lost to follow-up (i.e., failed to attend outpatient reviews or provided incorrect contact information). Study groups and data collection We conducted telephone follow-ups, outpatient follow-ups, and other methods to monitor selected patients. If the routine pathological examination results from the second surgery indicate recurrence of thyroid bed or residual thyroid tissue, central zone lymph node metastasis, or lateral neck lymph node metastasis, it is classified as recurrence. We then document the recurrence status of the patients. Patients are categorized into a recurrence group and a non-recurrence group based on the presence of DTC in the pathology results. Data from both groups are collected, including:  Basic information includes age, gender, and Body Mass Index (BMI). Pathology-related information includes the TNM stage (refer to the 2015 ATA guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancers 16 Treatment-related factors include the extent of surgical resection (bilateral total thyroidectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy, or unilateral lobectomy), as well as preoperative and postoperative serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroglobulin antibody (Tgab), and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOab). Thyroid hormone supplementation is initiated on the second day following a total thyroidectomy. The dosage is adjusted based on laboratory results obtained one month post-surgery. In the case of unilateral thyroid lobectomy, the necessity for thyroid hormone supplementation and the appropriate dosage are determined based on laboratory results one month after the surgery. Patients with DTC who are at medium to high risk of recurrence receive radioactive iodine ( 131 Statistical method Using SPSS 26.0 software for data analysis, count data is represented as n (%), and comparisons between two groups are conducted using the χ M P P 4  Table 4 Assignment table.
