Although tumor immunotherapy represents a promising approach to cancer treatment, its effectiveness is often hindered by the heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and immune escape mechanisms. In recent years, small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have attracted increasing attention in tumor immunology due to their essential role in gene regulation. This review systematically examines the multifaceted regulatory functions of sncRNAs in tumor immunity, with a focus on six major subtypes: microRNA, siRNA, piRNA, snoRNA, tsRNA, and snRNA. The molecular mechanisms by which these sncRNAs reshape the TME are discussed, including their roles in modulating immune cell differentiation (e.g., T cell polarization, macrophage phenotype transition), regulating immune checkpoint expression (PD-1/PD-L1, CTLA-4, Tim-3, LAG-3), and influencing tumor antigen presentation. This review also explores the dynamic network through which sncRNAs contribute to tumor immune escape. Furthermore, this study highlights the clinical potential of sncRNAs as liquid biopsy biomarkers and their application prospects in therapeutic strategies, such as targeted silencing of immunosuppressive molecules via nano-delivery systems, combination treatments with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy. Despite current challenges, including limited delivery efficiency and off-target effects, emerging technologies like AI-assisted sequence design and organ-on-a-chip models present new opportunities for clinical translation. This comprehensive review provides a theoretical foundation and translational insights for elucidating the functional network of sncRNAs in tumor immunology and advancing precise therapeutic interventions. small non-coding RNA tumor immunity immune checkpoint tumor microenvironment tumor immune escape tumor immunotherapy The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Major subclasses include microRNA, siRNA, piRNA, snoRNA, tsRNA, and snRNA ( 7 10 11 13 14 15 16 2 Overview of small non-coding RNAs RNA plays a crucial role in biological processes. As shown in  Figure 1 9 17  Figure 1 Figure 1 Classification of RNA. DNA is transcribed into coding RNA and non-coding RNA under the action of RNA polymerase. Coding RNA is further translated to generate proteins, while non-coding RNA is divided into lncRNA and sncRNA. Diagram illustrating RNA transcription from DNA via RNA polymerase. Coding RNA produces mRNA, leading to protein synthesis. Non-coding RNA branches into long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) forming circular RNA, transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and small non-coding RNA (sncRNA). SncRNA divides into small interfering RNA (siRNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), transfer RNA-derived small RNA (tsRNA), microRNA (miRNA), and piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA). microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding single-stranded RNA molecules approximately 20–24 nucleotides in length that primarily bind to the 3’ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of target mRNAs. When full complement is achieved, miRNAs mediate mRNA cleavage and degradation ( 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 23 siRNA are double-stranded RNA molecules consisting of 21–25 nucleotides. Based on their origin, siRNAs can be classified as endogenous, exogenous, or derived from post-transcriptional processing of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Similar to miRNAs, siRNAs mainly act at the post-transcriptional level by guiding sequence-specific gene silencing ( 25 26 26 27 28 29 30 27 31 32 piRNAs are typically 26–31 nucleotides in length and bind to the PIWI subfamily of Argonaute proteins to form the piRNA-Piwi complex (piRC) ( 33 34 33 35 36 37 38 39 in vitro 40 35 41 42 35 43 44 snoRNAs are small non-coding RNAs ranging from 65 to 300 nucleotides in length. Typically, they are processed from the intronic regions of small nucleolar RNA host genes (SNHGs) ( 45 33 46 33 47 33 46 48 in vivo in vitro 49 50 tsRNAs are a class of non-coding small RNAs generated from the cleavage of tRNA molecules. They are generally categorized into two subtypes based on their cleavage sites: tRNA-derived stress-induced RNAs (tiRNAs) and tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) ( 51 53 51 53 54 10 52 53 55 58 52 53 59 60 in vitro 61 62 54 63 In vitro 54 54 63 snRNAs are typically 100–300 nucleotides in length and include several key types, such as U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. These snRNAs associate with specific proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), which together constitute the core components of spliceosomes ( 64 65 66 67 68 69 In summary, it is evident that different types of sncRNAs exhibit significant differences in terms of size, structural characteristics, functions and mechanisms, as shown in  Table 1  Figure 2 Table 1 The size, structural characteristics, functions and mechanisms of different types of small non-coding RNAs. Category Size Structural characteristics Functions Mechanisms References miRNA 20–24 nt Single-stranded non-coding RNA, processed from hairpin-structured precursors. Regulate gene expression, incomplete complementary binding to the 3’ UTR of target mRNA, recruiting RISC complexes to inhibit translation or trigger mRNA degradation. Forms the RISC with AGO proteins to recognize and bind target mRNAs. ( 18 19 23 siRNA 21–25 nt Double-stranded RNA with relatively uniform length. Mediates RNA interference and silences gene expression through degradation of target mRNAs. Via complete complementary pairing, it recognizes and cleaves target mRNA, leading to its degradation. ( 25 27 piRNA 26–31 nt Single-stranded RNA that associates with the PIWI protein family. Predominantly silence transposons in germ cells and maintain genomic stability. Bind with PIWI protein to form piRC, silencing the target sequence through DNA methylation or heterochromatin modification. ( 33 38 snoRNA 65–300 nt Predominantly localized in the nucleolus and containing conserved sequence motifs. Participate in methylation or pseudouridylation modification of rRNA.

( 51 60 snRNA 100–300 nt Rich in uridine, associating with specific proteins to form snRNPs. Participate in pre mRNA splicing. Binding with proteins to form snRNPs, participating in spliceosome assembly and splicing reaction. ( 64 67 Figure 2 Association between sncRNAs and multiple cancers.

Each section features illustrations of the affected organ, sncRNA molecules, and specific RNA types linked to each cancer. 3 Regulation of tumor immune cells and tumor immune microenvironment by sncRNA 3.1 Regulation of immune cell development, differentiation, and function sncRNAs exert critical regulatory roles in the development, differentiation, and functional modulation of diverse immune cell populations involved in tumor immunity, including B cells, T cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and natural killer (NK) cells ( 70 74 70 72 73 74 70 73  Figure 3A 75 20 in vivo in vitro 45 76 77 45 78 Figure 3 Four main ways for sncRNA to regulate tumor immunity. (A) (B) (C) (D) Diagram illustrating immune regulation in four panels. A) Immune cells: differentiation of M1 and M2 macrophages, SNORA38B and miR-155 effects on Treg and Th1 cells, leading to cytokine release. B) Immune checkpoint: interactions involving PD-1, CTLA-4, TCR, and MHC-I regulating T-cell activity and tumor cell proliferation. C) Immune microenvironment: miR-21 influences macrophage cells, impacting tumor blood vessels and cancer cell death. D) Immune escape: miRNA and MHC-I suppression aid in Treg, T-cell, and NK cell interactions, facilitating tumor immune evasion. 3.2 The impact on the tumor microenvironment The TME is a complex ecosystem composed of tumor cells, immune cells, stromal cells, lymphatic and blood vessels, and the extracellular matrix ( 79 4 79 80 81  Figure 3C 82 83 84 50 4 Regulation of tumor immune checkpoints by sncRNAs and their involvement in tumor immune escape 4.1 Regulation of tumor immune checkpoint by sncRNAs sncRNAs can enhance anti-tumor immunity by modulating the expression of immune checkpoint molecules. Immune checkpoints include a group of inhibitory receptors and ligands such as programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 (  Figure 4B 3 85  Figure 4A 86  Figure 3B 87 88 89 91 Figure 4 Schematic diagram of tumor immune checkpoint mechanism.

Panel B displays a cancer cell evading immune response through PD-L1 interaction with CD8+ T cells. Panel C depicts cancer cells inducing Th1 cell apoptosis via Tim-3 and Gal-9 pathways. Panel D illustrates T cell interaction with an antigen-presenting cell (APC) through LAG-3 and MHC-II with IL-2 production and KEEL domain involvement. Tim-3 and its receptor, galectin-9 (Gal-9), have emerged as novel targets in recent studies on tumor immune checkpoints ( 92 93 94  Figure 4C 94 95 93 96  Figure 4D 97 98 4.2 Participation of sncRNAs in tumor immune escape Beyond regulating immune checkpoints, sncRNAs contribute to tumor immune escape through multiple mechanisms, including the modulation of tumor antigen presentation, reshaping of the tumor microenvironment ( 4  Figure 3D 99 100 101 102 Moreover, sncRNAs not only act directly through epigenetic mechanisms but also exert regulation at the post-transcriptional level, which influences epigenetic expression ( 103 104 105 105 107 108  Figure 5 109 Figure 5 sncRNAs regulate PD-L1 expression through the shared PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Schematic diagram illustrating the signaling pathways regulating PD-L1 expression and function. Growth factors activate Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, initiating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/Raf/MEK/ERK cascades. These pathways converge on transcription factors (STAT3, AP-1) to drive PD-L1 transcription. Additionally, post-transcriptional regulation is depicted, with sncRNAs (miR-34, miR-197, miR-200) targeting PD-L1 mRNA 3’ UTR. Diagram depicting the signaling pathways involved in PD-L1 expression. Growth factors activate receptor tyrosine kinase, initiating pathways through PI3K leading to AKT and mTOR, and RAS-GTP leading to ERK. These pathways influence PD-L1 expression via mRNA, with regulatory effects from miRNAs and sncRNAs. PD-L1 protein is produced, and its inhibition is indicated. 5 Application prospects of sncRNA in tumor immunotherapy 5.1 sncRNA as a tumor biomarker sncRNAs have emerged as critical targets in tumor biomarker research, owing to their exceptional stability in body fluids and tissue samples, tissue-specific expression patterns, and strong association with various diseases ( 62 110 113 113 114  Figure 6A 114 113 115 116 117 118 114 Figure 6 The relevant applications of sncRNA in tumor immunotherapy are illustrated. (A) (B) (C) (D) Illustration depicting four approaches in cancer therapy. A: Tumor markers from blood, feces, and tissue analyzed by PCR for tumor cells. B: Immune checkpoint therapy uses antisense oligonucleotides and miRNAs to target gastric tumor cells via T cells. C: Chemoradiotherapy involves sncRNA with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, considering pulmonary fibrosis. D: CAR-T therapy uses miRNA and shRNA to modify CAR genes in T cells, targeting cancer antigens leading to cancer cell death. Central focus is on tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy. Similarly, sncRNAs can also serve as biomarkers for non-solid tumors. Studies have comprehensively characterized the landscape of circulating sncRNAs in serum and bone marrow supernatants from patients with AML using high-throughput sequencing. The combination of tsRNA signatures (e.g., tsRNA Ala-TGC Gly-CCC 119 5.2 Targeting immune checkpoint pathways Immune checkpoints play a critical role in tumor immune escape, and their blockade has become a key strategy in tumor immunotherapy ( 84 120 121 124 125 126 85 89  Figure 6B 127 128 in vitro in vivo 129 In vitro 130 132 in vitro in vivo 131  Figure 6B 133 125 134 5.3 Combination therapy The integration of sncRNA with conventional treatment modalities, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and CAR-T therapy, has significant therapeutic potential. 5.3.1 SncRNA combined with chemotherapy Combining sncRNA-based therapy with chemotherapy has demonstrated synergistic effects in enhancing anti-tumor immunity (  Figure 6C 135 138 136 138 141 In vitro 139 142 143 144 145 5.3.2 sncRNA combined with radiotherapy Radiotherapy induces the release of tumor-associated antigens, and sncRNA can enhance the recognition and response of immune cells to these antigens, thereby synergistically amplifying the anti-tumor effects of radiotherapy (  Figure 6C 146 147 148  Figure 6C 149 150 5.3.3 sncRNA in combination with CAR-T therapy sncRNA can optimize the function of CAR-T cells and enhance their cytotoxic activity against tumor cells (  Figure 6D 151 155 In vitro 156 157 in vitro in vivo 158 At present, there are many clinical trials of sncRNAs in tumor immunotherapy. For example, researchers have attempted to apply CART cell therapy to other malignant tumors. In order to prevent allogeneic CART cell graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), researchers chose a shRNA based on miRNA, which targets CD3ζ and effectively downregulates the expression of T cell receptor below the detection level. They generated allogeneic anti-B cell mature antigen CART cells (CYAD-211), which co expressed shRNA based on anti-CD3ζ miRNA in CAR construction in vivo in vitro in vivo NCT04613557 159 NCT04811898 160 6 Research challenges and future prospects In summary, sncRNAs play an important regulatory role in tumor immunity. Different types of sncRNAs play different roles in the occurrence, development, and immune escape of various tumors. Certain microRNAs can participate in tumor immune escape by influencing tumor cell apoptosis, invasion, metastasis, and the function of immune cells in the TME. siRNAs are capable of targeting specific molecules to modulate immune cell activity and enhance the body′s anti-tumor immune response. Additionally, other sncRNAs including piRNAs, snoRNAs, and tsRNAs each play distinct roles in regulating tumor immunity-related pathways or cellular functions. Small non-coding RNA molecules and their roles in tumor immunity are summarized in  Table 2 Table 2 Small non-coding RNA molecules and their roles in tumor immunity.

Although sncRNAs have been implicated in key processes such as immune checkpoint regulation and tumor-associated macrophage polarization, the dynamic regulatory networks involving sncRNAs within the TME have not yet been fully elucidated. In particular, the mechanisms of cross-talk between sncRNAs and epigenetic modifications, as well as those involving metabolic reprogramming, remain poorly understood. Additionally, synergistic or antagonistic interactions among different subclasses of sncRNAs require further investigation. Addressing these knowledge gaps will necessitate the application of advanced technologies such as single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics. More importantly, safety concerns remain a major barrier to the clinical application of sncRNA-based therapies. The toxicity mechanism of siRNA mainly includes its inherent immunogenicity, hybridization dependent toxicity (such as off target effect and targeted over silencing) and saturation effect of RNA interference mechanism. In addition, delivery systems (such as lipid nanoparticles and polymer carriers) may also trigger immune activation and chemical toxicity, such as complement activation, cell membrane damage and mitochondrial damage. To meet these challenges, researchers have adopted a variety of strategies: reducing the immunogenicity of siRNA by chemical modification (such as 2’-ome or 2’-f). Optimizing the seed zone design to reduce the Miss effect. Develop ionizable lipid nanoparticles to improve the safety of delivery systems. GalNAc coupling technology was used to achieve efficient liver targeting ( 163 29 163 in vivo 164 As understanding of the roles of sncRNAs in tumor immunity deepens and nanotechnology-based delivery systems continue to evolve ( 33 165 166 Acknowledgments Thanks for the technical support by the Core Facilities, Health Science Center, Ningbo University.
