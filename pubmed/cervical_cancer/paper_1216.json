Introduction Ménière’s disease (MD) is an inner ear disorder pathologically characterized by endolymphatic hydrops. Clinically, MD exhibits considerable heterogeneity, with a classic triad comprising episodic vestibular dysfunction and progressive auditory impairment. Its hallmark symptoms include recurrent episodes of rotational vertigo lasting from 20 min to 12 h, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss predominantly affecting low-to-mid frequencies, and cochlear symptoms such as tinnitus or aural fullness. The disease typically follows a chronic and progressive course [ 1 2 Although MD was first systematically described by Prosper Ménière in 1861, its precise pathogenesis remains incompletely understood [ 3 4 5 6 MD predominantly affects middle-aged and older adults and exerts a profound impact on their quality of life [ 7 8 9 10 11 In recent years, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has demonstrated unique advantages in the prevention and treatment of inner ear disorders such as vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss. By adhering to the principle of syndrome differentiation and treatment, TCM aligns closely with the modern medical paradigms of “precision medicine” and “personalized therapy.” It emphasizes a holistic approach, conceptually resonating with the principles of modern systems biology and aligning closely with the core tenets of network pharmacology, which integrates multi-target, multi-pathway, and multi-level analyses to elucidate the complex interactions between drugs and biological systems [ 12 13 XYN is a proprietary Chinese medicine formulation composed of extracts from ten distinct medicinal herbs, selected according to traditional pharmacopeia principles. It is commonly prescribed in clinical settings to alleviate symptoms such as dizziness and tinnitus and has been applied in the treatment of MD [ 14 15 In light of the above, as shown in Figure 1 By integrating multi-level and multi-dimensional network-based approaches, this study endeavors to provide robust experimental and theoretical evidence supporting the clinical application of XYN in MD treatment, thereby establishing a solid foundation for the development of novel, safe, and effective therapeutic strategies. 2. Results 2.1. UHPLC-MS-Based Chemical Profiling of XYN The extract of XYN was analyzed under positive ion mode. Major chromatographic peaks in the total ion chromatogram were systematically identified based on retention time, accurate mass measurements from high-resolution mass spectrometry, and MS/MS fragmentation patterns. The identification results are presented in Figure 2 Figure 2 In total, 125 compounds were identified, comprising 45 flavonoids, 29 terpenoids, 17 phenylpropanoids, 14 alkaloids, 13 organic acids, 3 coumarins, 1 lignan, 1 quinone, and 2 others. The above results were obtained through manual interpretation without the use of reference standards. Further confirmation requires the acquisition and comparison of authentic reference compounds. Detailed information is provided in the Table S1 2.2. XYN Administration Alleviates Endolymphatic Hydrops and Improves Associated Symptoms 2.2.1. Validation of the Endolymphatic Hydrops Model and Post-Modeling Re-Grouping Baseline balance across groups following re-grouping is presented in the Figure S1 In addition, guinea pigs in the model group demonstrated reduced weight and impaired behavioral performance, confirming the successful establishment of the endolymphatic hydrops model. 2.2.2. XYN Attenuates Endolymphatic Hydrops in the Cochlea Figure 3 These findings indicate that, compared to the blank control group, guinea pigs in the model group exhibited clear enlargement of the endolymphatic space, confirming the presence of endolymphatic hydrops consistent with the pathological features of Meniere’s disease. Relative to the model group, animals in all treatment groups showed a reduction in hydrops severity, suggesting that both XYN and BHS effectively alleviated endolymphatic hydrops in guinea pigs. 2.2.3. XYN Improves Gait Trajectories in Guinea Pigs As shown in Figure 4 2.2.4. XYN Improves Behavioral Indices in Guinea Pigs Across Groups Behavioral assessments in this study included general condition (weight and overall appearance), auricular reflexes (low-, medium-, and high-frequency stimulation), nystagmus, and righting reflex. As shown on the left side of Figure 4 2.2.5. XYN Improves Behavioral Indicators Before and After Treatment Within the Same Guinea Pigs Considering that individual differences among guinea pigs may influence the precision of behavioral assessments, we further analyzed changes in behavioral indices before and after treatment within the same animals. As shown on the right side of Figure 4 2.3. The JAK-STAT Signaling Pathway as a Core Axis in the Pathogenesis of Endolymphatic Hydrops and the Therapeutic Action of XYN 2.3.1. Differentially Expressed mRNAs and Proteins Associated with Endolymphatic Hydrops and XYN Intervention According to Figure 5 According to Figure 6 GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed separately on DEGs and DEPs associated with disease onset and drug intervention, stratified by up- and downregulation. The enriched pathways were predominantly involved in immune response, inflammation, metabolism, and cytoskeletal regulation. Notably, both mRNA and protein datasets were significantly enriched in the cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway, among others. Detailed enrichment analysis results are provided in the Figures S2–S5 2.3.2. Metabolism, Inflammation, and Immunity-Related Phenotypes Are Associated with Meniere’s Disease Onset Given the lack of clearly defined research directions in MD, MR analysis was first performed to identify meaningful investigative targets, which subsequently guided the interpretation of high-throughput sequencing results in this study. Based on previous research and the transcriptomic and proteomic findings outlined earlier, metabolic, immune, and inflammatory factors or pathways were prioritized for MR analysis. GWAS summary statistics for both exposures and outcomes were obtained from the Finnish biobank, with all relevant data accessed in September 2024. The Finnish data were derived from the most recent r-11 version of the database. Given the large size of the datasets, additional validation was conducted to ensure the robustness of the findings. SNPs were selected based on a genome-wide significance threshold of p −6 p −5 Table S2 A total of 2275 two-sample MR analyses were conducted, treating candidate phenotypes as exposure variables and MD as the outcome. All instrumental variables had F-statistics > 10, indicating sufficient strength. IVW analysis identified 112 exposure phenotypes with a causal relationship to MD, among which 57 phenotypes were positively associated (OR > 1, p p Specifically, out of 1400 metabolic traits, 75 were associated with MD. Among 731 immune cell phenotypes, 32 were associated. From 91 inflammatory circulating proteins, 3 were associated. Further analysis showed that 35 metabolic traits, 19 immune cell phenotypes, and 1 protein were positively associated with MD risk, while 40 metabolic traits, 13 immune phenotypes, and 2 proteins were negatively associated. In addition, both otitis media and anxiety disorders were found to have a significant positive correlation with MD risk. To enhance reliability and confirm consistency, Bayesian-weighted MR analysis was conducted on 110 phenotypes from the three largest datasets. This analysis confirmed 90 significant exposure phenotypes with consistent effect directions in both standard and Bayesian MR approaches. As shown in Figure 7 Overall, metabolism-related phenotypes exerted the strongest influence on MD risk, followed by inflammatory protein and immune cell–related phenotypes. 2.3.3. The JAK-STAT Signaling Pathway as a Core Axis in Endolymphatic Hydrops Pathogenesis and XYN Intervention After stringent filtering, 191 genes were identified as pathologically upregulated in MD and downregulated following XYN treatment, whereas 286 genes exhibited the opposite trend—pathologically downregulated and pharmacologically upregulated. Similarly, 18 proteins were identified in each of the corresponding categories. Altogether, 209 molecules were classified as pathologically upregulated and pharmacologically downregulated, and 304 as pathologically downregulated and pharmacologically upregulated. These findings resulted in the identification of 513 potential molecular targets of XYN in the treatment of MD. As shown in Figure 8 Further stratification of the PPI network into two subnetworks—based on pathological upregulation/pharmacological downregulation and vice versa—yielded the following: The 209 pathologically upregulated, pharmacologically downregulated molecules formed a subnetwork comprising 38 nodes and 136 edges. MCODE analysis identified IFNG and STAT1 as high-degree nodes, with IFNG emerging as a key molecule within the core subnetwork. The 304 pathologically downregulated, pharmacologically upregulated molecules formed a subnetwork of 86 nodes and 129 edges, where AOX2 was identified as a prominent node in the MCODE-defined core subnetwork. Key nodes across these networks—including AOX2, IFNG, STAT1, and IL22—are well-recognized components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, and many (e.g., STAT and AOX family members) are closely associated with lipid metabolism. In conjunction with the MR analysis findings from Section 2.3.2 2.3.4. The hsa-miR-3148/ZBTB20 Regulatory Axis as a Potential Blood Biomarker for Meniere’s Disease While findings from animal and basic research provide valuable mechanistic insights, a translational gap remains before clinical application can be achieved. Therefore, this section focuses on identifying potential blood biomarkers for MD using RNA sequencing data from clinical MD patients. Two datasets— GSE202657 GSE176560 GSE202657 As shown in Figure 9 GSE176560 The 34 differentially expressed miRNAs and their predicted target mRNAs were imported into Cytoscape to construct a miRNA–mRNA regulatory network, after removing isolated nodes and unconnected subnetworks. The resulting network consisted of 442 nodes and 457 edges, including 15 miRNAs and 427 mRNAs. Among these, hsa-miR-3148 had the highest node degree among miRNAs, and ZBTB20 had the highest node degree among mRNAs. Intersecting the mRNA lists from both datasets led to the identification of 41 core mRNAs associated with MD pathogenesis. A refined miRNA–mRNA regulatory network was then constructed using these 41 mRNAs and the 34 differentially expressed miRNAs from GSE176560 Importantly, ZBTB20 was also found to be significantly differentially expressed in both the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of the guinea pig model in this study, further supporting its potential relevance as a clinical blood biomarker for MD. 2.4. Overactivation of the JAK-STAT Signaling Pathway in MD and Its Suppression by XYN Treatment As shown in Figure 10 Western blot results similarly demonstrated overactivation of JAK-STAT pathway proteins in the model group, with significant differences compared to controls. Treatment with XYN and BHS resulted in suppression of these protein expressions to varying extents. Expression levels of IFNG and AOX were significantly downregulated in all treatment groups; However, expression of IFNGR1, JAK1, and phosphorylated STAT/total STAT ratio (p-STAT/STAT) was significantly downregulated only in the high-dose XYN group. While other groups showed a downward trend, these changes were not statistically significant. The sequences of primers and the details of antibodies used in the experiments are provided in Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 3. Discussion Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers a distinctive perspective on the pathogenesis of vertigo. Classical TCM teachings suggest that “no vertigo occurs without phlegm” and “no vertigo occurs without deficiency,” highlighting that impaired blood circulation, meridian obstruction, and failure of blood to nourish the brain are key mechanisms underlying the condition [ 16 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Notably, the pathological hallmark of MD—endolymphatic hydrops—aligns closely with the TCM concept of “phlegm–fluid retention (tan yin)”, which is believed to result from dysfunction in San Jiao (the Triple Energizer) and disrupted fluid metabolism [ 23 XYN, composed of Alisma plantago-aquatica Atractylodes macrocephala Wolfiporia cocos Pinellia ternate Ligustrum lucidum Eclipta prostrata Chrysanthemum morifolium Achyranthes bidentata Citrus reticulata Glycyrrhiza uralensis http://www.worldfloraonline.org 24 25 14 15 25 Atractylodes macrocephala 26 27 Pinellia ternate 28 Mechanistic studies on MD predominantly rely on the guinea pig model of endolymphatic hydrops, which can be reliably induced by arginine vasopressin (AVP) or its analog dDAVP [ 29 9 10 By integrating high-throughput sequencing with MR analysis, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway was identified as a central molecular axis involved both in the pathogenesis of endolymphatic hydrops and the therapeutic mechanism of XYN. There is accumulating evidence supporting the immune-inflammatory mechanism underlying MD. In a subset of patients, anti-inner ear antibodies and circulating immune complexes have been detected in the serum [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 At the molecular level, the JAK-STAT signaling pathway serves as a central node in cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses. It is composed of ligand–receptor pairs such as IFNG, members of the JAK family, and STATs [ 36 37 38 39 40 41 These findings suggest that humoral immune dysregulation and cytokine imbalance act synergistically, driving JAK-STAT-dependent inflammatory cascades, which represent a fundamental pathological basis for the progression and fluctuation of MD symptoms. The JAK-STAT signaling pathway plays a pivotal role not only in immune and inflammatory regulation, but is also closely associated with a variety of metabolic disorders, including obesity, insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and atherosclerosis [ 42 43 44 45 The AOX family plays a key role in maintaining the homeostasis of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., DHA), thereby regulating membrane fluidity and signal transduction in inner ear cells, as well as alleviating local inflammation [ 46 Notably, chronic activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in MD may exacerbate cochlear damage by amplifying oxidative stress. For example, STAT3 promotes the expression of NADPH oxidase complexes, leading to elevated reactive oxygen species levels. In parallel, peroxidation byproducts of lipid metabolism, such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, require detoxification via the AOX system. However, this detoxification process itself generates additional oxidative species, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, thereby further increasing oxidative burden [ 47 48 49 Although this study focused on the JAK-STAT signaling pathway as a central regulatory axis, other highly enriched pathways identified in our analysis may also hold significant relevance. Previous research has suggested that genetic alterations in Toll-like receptor pathways and cytokine-related signaling—particularly involving interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α—are closely associated with the inflammatory processes observed in Meniere’s disease [ 50 51 This study also explored potential biomarkers in the blood of MD patients. Notably, ZBTB20 deficiency has been shown to significantly reduce the endocochlear potential, disrupt the high-potassium/low-sodium environment of the endolymph, and induce hydrops by impairing fluid homeostasis [ 52 53 + + 54 55 Despite the promising findings presented in this study, several limitations should be acknowledged. Currently, there is a significant lack of fundamental research on MD, and data concerning the effects of XYN on human tissues or patients remain extremely limited. As a result, no suitable external datasets are presently available for independent validation of our findings. Future studies will aim to investigate the mechanistic basis and therapeutic relevance of XYN using human-derived tissues and well-characterized clinical samples. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Component Identification Results of XYN Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry was employed for the chemical analysis. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm; Dublin, Ireland) using a Vanquish UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a binary gradient pump, autosampler, column oven, and diode array detector. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile (A) and 0.1% formic acid in water (B), with the following gradient program: 0–2 min, 95% B; 2–42 min, 95% to 10% B; 42–44 min, 10% B; 44–45 min, 10% to 95% B; 45–50 min, 95% B. The flow rate was set at 0.3 mL/min, the injection volume was 3 μL, and the column temperature was maintained at 35 °C. Mass spectrometric detection was performed on a Q-Exactive Orbitrap quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source and controlled by Xcalibur 4.1 software. In positive ion mode, the spray voltage was 3.5 kV, with the ion source temperature set at 350 °C, capillary temperature at 300 °C, and the S-Lens RF level at 60 V. Sheath and auxiliary gas (nitrogen, >99.99%) were supplied at 40 and 20 arbitrary units, respectively. In negative ion mode, the spray voltage was 3.2 kV, with sheath and auxiliary gas flow rates adjusted to 35 and 10 units, respectively. Data were acquired in both full-scan ( m z For sample preparation, XYN were finely pulverized, and 1.0 g of powder was accurately weighed into a stoppered conical flask. Methanol (50 mL) was added, and the mixture was subjected to ultrasonic extraction for 40 min. After cooling, the extract was weighed again and adjusted with methanol to compensate for solvent loss. The solution was thoroughly mixed, filtered, and passed through a 0.22 μm microporous membrane prior to UHPLC-HRMS analysis. 4.2. Experimental Animals Male albino Hartley guinea pigs, weighing 250 ± 10 g, were obtained from Beijing Fangyuan Yuan Breeding Facility (License No. SCXK [Beijing] 2020-0001; Animal Quality Certificate No. 110334241100018953). All experiments were conducted at the Laboratory Animal Center of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (Facility License No. SCXK [Beijing] 2023-0011), with ethical approval granted by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the university (Approval No. BUCM-2024022707-1091). Animals were housed under controlled environmental conditions: temperature 18–22 °C, relative humidity 40–60%, and a 12 h light/dark cycle. All procedures involving animal care and use were conducted in strict accordance with the Regulations for the Administration of Laboratory Animals (China), as well as the guidelines and requirements of the Animal Ethics Committee of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. 4.3. Pharmacodynamic Evaluation Based on Endolymphatic Hydrops Model 4.3.1. Establishment of the Guinea Pig Endolymphatic Hydrops Model Intraperitoneal injection of dDAVP induces endolymphatic hydrops, leading to clinical manifestations such as vertigo and hearing loss, with minimal invasiveness and high safety [ 56 57 58 The modeling agent dDAVP was prepared at doses of 4 μg/kg and 8 μg/kg to generate low- and high-concentration solutions at 0.04 μg/μL and 0.08 μg/μL, respectively. Solutions were stored at −20 °C until use. After a 7-day acclimation period, guinea pigs were intraperitoneally injected with the low-concentration dDAVP solution at a dose of 1 mL/kg daily for 7 consecutive days, followed by the high-concentration dDAVP solution at the same dose for 3 consecutive days. This protocol was used to induce endolymphatic hydrops in the guinea pigs. 4.3.2. Behavioral Assessments Behavioral performance of the guinea pigs was evaluated using several criteria, including general condition, auricular reflex, presence of nystagmus, and righting reflex. Scoring was performed according to the standards outlined in Table 5 Table S3 4.3.3. Re-Grouping and Drug Administration To account for individual variability among guinea pigs and subtle differences introduced during the modeling process, animals with successfully induced endolymphatic hydrops were re-grouped to balance baseline characteristics and ensure the scientific rigor and reliability of experimental outcomes. Each group (excluding the blank control group) was balanced in terms of weight, auricular reflex, nystagmus, and righting response to minimize bias caused by group-level deviations. Animals were randomly assigned into six groups ( n Following the treatment period, behavioral assessments were conducted as described in Section 4.3.2 4.4. High-Throughput Sequencing and Bioinformatics Analysis 4.4.1. Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analysis Total RNA was extracted from guinea pig cochlear tissue and used for transcriptome library preparation. The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, generating 150 bp paired-end reads. Data obtained from the Illumina (or BGI) platform were subsequently used for bioinformatics analysis. For proteomic analysis, total protein was extracted from cochlear tissues. Peptides from each sample were analyzed using an Orbitrap™ Astral™ mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled with a Vanquish Neo liquid chromatography system (Thermo Scientific) in data-independent acquisition (DIA) mode. DIA data were processed using DIA-NN version 1.8.1. Both transcriptomic and proteomic data were aligned to the reference genome Cavia porcellus (NCBI Genome Assembly mCavPor4.1, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/-GCF_034190915.1/ For downstream proteomic analysis, raw expression values were log2-transformed with a + 1 offset and linearly scaled to the range of 1–100. Differential expression analysis for both mRNA and proteins was performed using the limma package in R. Differentially expressed genes and proteins were defined based on a threshold of |log 2 2 p Gene Ontology ( http://geneontology.org/ https://www.kegg.jp/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/gene/GCF_034190915.1/ p 4.4.2. Integrated Omics Analysis To comprehensively identify key molecular targets, DEGs and DEPs were merged and categorized into two molecular subsets: (1) molecules upregulated under pathological conditions and downregulated after pharmacological treatment, (2) molecules downregulated under pathological conditions and upregulated following treatment. These subsets were considered potential molecular targets of XYN in the intervention of MD. Each of the two molecular subsets, as well as their combined set, was imported into the STRING database ( https://cn.string-db.org/ 4.4.3. Analysis of Risk Factors for Meniere’s Disease This study conducted an analysis based on publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) datasets, strictly adhering to the STROBE-MR (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Using MR) guidelines to ensure methodological rigor and reliability of results [ 54 A comprehensive search was conducted in the PubMed database for factors associated with the onset of MD, using keywords such as “Meniere’s disease etiology” and “risk factors for Meniere’s disease.” Inclusion criteria required articles to directly address the etiology, pathophysiology, or risk factors of MD. Eligible literature types included scientific papers that contribute to understanding MD’s etiology, specifically original research articles, review articles, and pertinent case reports. Exclusion criteria eliminated articles unrelated to MD etiology, including those focused exclusively on treatment, prognosis, or other otologic disorders, as well as case reports lacking substantial etiological insights. Additionally, low-quality studies—such as non-peer-reviewed articles, conference abstracts, studies with insufficient methodological rigor, and duplicate publications—were excluded. To retrieve relevant GWAS data, we searched databases such as the Finnish Database, GWAS Catalog, and PubMed for studies on associated risk factors and collected data on potential exposure phenotypes and outcomes related to MD. To comprehensively examine the relationship between exposure phenotypes and MD across all GWAS datasets, we applied a genome-wide significance threshold of 5 × 10 −6 To address linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs and enhance the robustness of the analysis, we utilized reference data from the 1000 Genomes Project ( https://github.com/mrcieu/gwasvcf/ All statistical analyses were conducted in R (version 4.4.1). The primary MR analysis method was inverse variance weighted (IVW), implemented using the TwoSampleMR package in R. IVW is a meta-analysis-based approach that combines the Wald ratios of individual SNPs by weighting them inversely to their variance, assuming all instruments are valid and there is no horizontal pleiotropy. Post-analysis, heterogeneity was assessed via Cochran’s Q test, where a p Results are reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In this study, p p 4.4.4. Analysis of Blood Biomarkers in Meniere’s Disease Patients The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ Initial preprocessing steps included the removal of entries with missing values or duplicate data points. Subsequently, the data were normalized to bring all variables within a comparable range, facilitating reliable downstream analyses. Genes with missing expression values or duplicates were removed from the expression matrix, and those with expression levels below 5 were filtered out. Differential expression analysis of miRNAs and mRNAs was performed using the limma package in R. Significant differentially expressed molecules were identified based on the criteria |log 2 2 p p Target mRNAs regulated by differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted using the miRDB ( https://mirdb.org/ http://mirwalk.umm.uni-heidelberg.de/ 4.5. Molecular Biology Experiments To validate the expression of the key pathways and core molecules identified in the preceding analyses, RT-qPCR and Western blot assays were performed. For RT-qPCR, total RNA was reverse transcribed using the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit. The resulting cDNA was mixed with DEPC-treated water, target gene primers, and SYBR Green reagent to prepare a 10 μL reaction system. Amplification was carried out using a three-step PCR protocol, followed by analysis of melting and amplification curves. Relative expression levels of target genes were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt For Western blotting, total protein concentrations in each group were quantified using the BCA assay and adjusted to uniform levels with PBS. Protein samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, loaded by group, and transferred to NC membranes using a wet-transfer sandwich method. Membranes were blocked with BSA at room temperature for 1.5 h, then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST five times, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1.5 h, followed by another five washes with TBST. Protein bands were visualized using ECL detection reagents on a chemiluminescent imaging system. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ software 1.50i. The relative expression of target proteins was calculated as the ratio of the target protein band intensity to that of the internal reference protein. 4.6. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.4.1). For MR, the primary analytical method employed was IVW analysis, implemented via the TwoSampleMR package. To assess the reliability of the causal estimates, Cochran’s Q test was used to evaluate heterogeneity among IVs, with p MR-Egger regression was applied to detect horizontal pleiotropy, and leave-one-out sensitivity analysis was used to determine whether the causal effect estimates were unduly influenced by any single SNP. Results were presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, and statistical significance was set at p Data visualization was performed using the ggplot2 package in R to intuitively display the analytical outcomes. Quantitative results were expressed as the mean ± standard error of the mean. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used to analyze differences among multiple groups. 5. Conclusions This study, for the first time, systematically integrates transcriptomics, proteomics, animal experiments, and bioinformatics approaches to investigate the pathogenesis of MD and elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of XYN from the perspective of molecular interaction networks. As shown in Figure 11 In summary, these findings provide both experimental and theoretical support for the clinical application of XYN in MD treatment and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Moreover, this integrative research framework offers valuable insights for exploring the role of traditional Chinese medicine in managing refractory and multifactorial diseases.
