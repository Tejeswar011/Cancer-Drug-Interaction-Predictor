Alveolar macrophages (AMs) play a crucial role in regulating inflammation and repair processes during acute lung injury (ALI)/ARDS. However, the transcriptional and functional changes in AMs during ALI/ARDS remain poorly understood, especially when considering species-specific differences between murine models and human pathophysiology. This study aims to elucidate these changes in AMs during ALI/ARDS by integrating in vitro and cross-species transcriptomic analyses. Methods We conducted RNA sequencing on LPS-stimulated MH-S cells and integrated the data with publicly available murine ( GSE225406 GSE40885 GSE121871 GSE243066 Results We identified 45 conserved upregulated genes and 4 downregulated genes across species, highlighting core transcriptional regulators of LPS-induced Macrophage activation. Functional enrichment analysis revealed significant involvement of immune-inflammatory pathways. PPI network analysis identified 10 core genes potentially central to AM-mediated ALI/ARDS pathogenesis. Experimental validation confirmed the upregulation of key genes and demonstrated that LPS treatment significantly impaired the efferocytosis capacity of AMs with dysregulated expression of stabilin-2, suggesting a potential association with this functional defect. Furthermore, the core gene set showed diagnostic potential in ARDS patient samples (AUC = 0.86). Conclusion This analysis identifies cross-species conserved core genes and inflammatory pathways in AMs during ALI/ARDS. Our findings provide insights into AM-mediated inflammatory mechanisms and highlight candidate genes for further functional studies to explore their potential as therapeutic targets.

They serve as the first line of defense against respiratory pathogens and play a pivotal role in regulating immune-inflammatory responses [ 6 7 1 8 8 Previous studies have attempted to characterize AMs’ transcriptional signatures in ALI/ARDS using human datasets [ 9 10 11 GSE89953 GSE76293 GSE32707 9 11 These investigations were limited by mismatched control cell types (e.g., neutrophils and whole blood cells) in human studies [ 10 9 8 GSE225406 11 GSE40885 12 Further, to simulate the heterogeneity of primary AMs and the human microenvironment as closely as possible, we selected the high-virulence Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infected group and the untreated group from GSE121871 13 14 GSE243066 15 16 17 Finally, to preliminarily assess the clinical diagnostic potential of the core genes, we performed gene set variation analysis (GSVA) based on these genes, calculating enrichment scores across groups within the core gene set. Using these scores as diagnostic markers, we constructed a multi-gene scoring model. Materials and methods Research approach This study aims to analyse the transcriptional changes of AMs in ALI/ARDS. Firstly, an in vitro model of LPS-stimulated MH-S cells was established. RNA sequencing was performed to identify DEGs, which were then cross-species analysed in combination with mouse ( GSE225406 GSE40885 GSE121871 GSE243066 1 Fig. 1 Workflow chart of the study Transcriptome sample extraction and detection First, MH-S cells (obtained from ATCC) were seeded in six 10 cm² culture dishes (3 dishes per group), divided into two experimental groups: infection group and control group. When cell density reached 80%−90% on the second day, the experimental group was treated with 10 ng/mL LPS (Millipore Sigma, cat#: L2630) while the control group received an equivalent volume of complete medium. After 72 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO₂, the medium was discarded and cells were washed twice with PBS. Total RNA was extracted using the Cell/Bacterial Total RNA Extraction Kit (Genesand, cat#: RE716). Control samples were designated as MH.S.Normal.1, MH.S.Normal.2, MH.S.Normal.3, while experimental samples were labeled MH.S.LPS.72 h.1, MH.S.LPS.72 h.2, MH.S.LPS.72 h.3. RNA purity, concentration, and integrity were assessed using the Agilent 4200 Bioanalyzer, with samples achieving an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ≥ 4 qualifying for subsequent analysis. Library construction and transcriptome sequencing After the RNA samples passed quality inspection, eukaryotic mRNA was enriched using magnetic beads with Oligo(dT). Subsequently, the mRNA was fragmented into short segments by adding a fragmentation buffer. Using the mRNA as a template, single-stranded cDNA was synthesized with random hexamer primers. Then, buffer, dNTPs, DNA polymerase I, and RNase H were added to synthesize double-stranded cDNA, which was subsequently purified using AMPure XP beads. The purified double-stranded cDNA underwent end repair, A-tailing, and sequencing adapter ligation, followed by size selection using AMPure XP beads. Finally, PCR amplification was performed, and the PCR products were purified with AMPure XP beads to obtain the final library. The constructed library underwent quality control, and qualified libraries were subjected to PE150 sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 high-throughput sequencing platform. Sequencing data quality control After obtaining the sequencing data of the sample, the first step was to assess the quality of the sequencing data and filter out low-quality data to ensure the reliability of the subsequent analysis results. The quality control (QC) process uses the software fastp. The QC criteria were as follows: 1. The proportion of bases with quality values lower than 15 should not exceed 40%; 2. Starting from the 5’ end of the read, in a sliding window of 4 bases, the average quality value shall not be lower than 20. If it is lower, the sequence within the window and to its right shall be discarded; 3. After QC, the length of the read shall not be less than 75 bases; 4. The number of N bases in a single read should not exceed 5. Screening of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) The DESeq2 software was used to perform differential expression analysis of genes between the two groups (We refer to this dataset as MH-S raw data in the following text.). The criteria for screening DEGs were set as P Datasets The mRNA profiles of GSE225406 11 GSE40885 12 GSE121871 13 GSE243066 15 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GSE225406 GSE121871 GSE243066 GSE40885 Differential expression analysis For the GSE225406 GSE40885 P Functional enrichment analysis The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) was employed to conduct GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. The screened significant differentially expressed genes were uploaded to the DAVID platform. With the aid of its built-in analysis tools, we aimed to identify the significantly enriched GO terms in biological processe (BP), molecular function (MF), and cellular component (CC), as well as the KEGG pathways. Based on the adjusted p-values and the number of differentially expressed genes enriched in the pathways, the top thirty significant pathways were sorted and selected (the screening criterion was a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). In cases where there were fewer than 30 pathways meeting the criterion, the top-ranked pathways were selected for analysis.). Subsequently, the ggplot2 package and the goplot function in R software were utilized to visualize the results of the enrichment analysis by drawing bubble plots and circular plots. Analysis of core genes We mapped all mouse genes to human homologs using biomaRt before analysis [ 18 https://www.string-db.org/ https://cytoscape.org/ https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cytohubba Analysis of common DEGs expression by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) Thirteen upregulated and one downregulated common DEGs were validated using qRT-PCR. RNA from MH-S cells was extracted (Genesand, cat#: RE716), reverse-transcribed to cDNA (Servicebio, cat#: G3329), and amplified via SYBR Green Master-Mix (Servicebio, cat#: G3326) on a Bio-rad CFX Connect system. Relative expression (stimulated vs. control) was calculated using 2^-ΔΔCT. Primers (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) and PCR amplification cycling conditions are listed in Table S1 Analysis of ACOD1 (also known as IRG1) and TNIP3 expression by Western blotting MH-S cells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease/phosphatase inhibitors (Solarbio, cat#: P6730/P1260), sonicated, and centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min). Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Bioworld, cat#: BD0028). Denatured samples (40 µg) were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore Sigma, cat#: IPVH00010), blocked with QuickBlock buffer (Beyotime, cat#: P0252), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. After TBST washes, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at RT. Bands were visualized using Immobilon substrate (Merck, cat#: WBKLS0100-1) and imaged (Amersham Imager 680, Gene Ray Electric company, USA). Quantification was performed with Image J. Antibody details are provided in the Table S1 Immunofluorescence analysis of TNIP3 expression in MH-S cells MH-S cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (GenXion, cat#: JX0100). They were then blocked for 30 min with QuickBlock™ Blocking Buffer for Immunol Staining (Beyotime, cat#: P0260), and incubated overnight with primary antibodies. After washing with PBS, they were incubated for 1 h at RT with FITC and Cy3 conjugated secondary antibody. After nuclear staining with DAPI (Servicebio, cat#G1012) and washing with PBS, the cells were checked under a confocal laser microscopy (SP8, Leica, Germany). Antibody details are provided in the Table S1 Murine acute lung injury model To avoid potential confounding effects of estrous cycle-related hormonal fluctuations in female mice and facilitate results comparison, six-to-eight-week-old SPF-grade male BALB/c mice were obtained from Guangdong Medical Experimental Animal Center (license number SCXK [YUE] 2022-0002). The mice were group-housed in pathogen-free cages at the Experimental Animal Center of Guangzhou Medical University. The housing conditions were standardized with a room temperature of 20–26 °C, humidity of 40–70%, and a 12-hour light/dark cycle. The mice had free access to water and standard rodent chow throughout the protocols. The experimental protocol was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Guangzhou Medical University. After one week of acclimatization, the mice were randomly divided into two groups: the control group and ALI model group, The ALI model was induced by direct intratracheal instillation of LPS (2 mg/kg) (Escherichia coli serotype O111:B4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), as described in protocols from other groups [ 19 Hematoxylin-eosin staining analysis For histopathological assessment, mouse lungs were dissected and fixed in paraformaldehyde for 24 h at 4 °C. The lung tissues were then embedded in paraffin, and cut into 4-µm-thick sections. Subsequently, the sections underwent routine dewaxing using xylene I and xylene II solutions, followed by hydration with an ethanol concentration gradient. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Servicebio, cat#: G1076) was performed to visualize nuclei and cytoplasmic structures in the sections. Bright-field images were acquired using a microscope (DM68, Leica, Germany). Immunohistochemistry analysis The lung tissue sections of mice were cut into 4 μm slices after being embedded in paraffin. After antigen retrieval and washing, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with a 3% H 2 2 S1 Determination of the efferocytosis of MH-S cells Jurkat T cells (obtained from ATCC) were exposed to UV light at a wavelength of 254 nm for 30 min and then returned to the incubator for 4 h to allow spontaneous apoptosis to occur, and more than 80% of the cells were observed to undergo apoptosis under the microscope using Trypan blue staining. MH-S cells treated according to the control and LPS (10 ng/mL, 72 h) groups were inoculated onto cell crawls in 12-well cell culture plates. Apoptotic Jurkat T cells were labeled with PKH26 using PKH26 Red fluorescent cell membrane staining kit (Solarbio, cat#: D0030). Apoptotic Jurkat T cells were added to each well at a ratio of 10:1 (apoptotic Jurkat T cells: MH-S cells) in 600 µl of complete culture medium and co-cultured with MH-S alveolar Macrophages for 4 h. They were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and fluorescence of unendocytosed apoptotic Jurkat T cells was quenched by incubating for 2 min with 1 ml of 0.04% Trypan Blue Stain Solution (Solarbio, cat#: C0040). MH-S cells were then blocked for 30 min with QuickBlock™ Blocking Buffer, and incubated overnight with Rabbit anti-Stab2 (diluted 1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat#: PA5-76192). After washing with PBS, they were incubated for 1 h at RT with FITC conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (diluted 1:200, Servicebio, cat#: GB22303). After nuclear staining with DAPI and washing with PBS, the cells were checked under a confocal laser microscope (SP8, Leica, Germany).

Differences between two continuous groups were analysed using the independent Student’s t-test for normally distributed variables. All experiments were repeated at least three biological replicates, and the data were presented as mean ± standard error (mean ± SE). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results RNA sequencing data quality assessment of LPS-stimulated MH-S cells To systematically characterize the LPS-induced transcriptional alterations in MH-S alveolar macrophages, we conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on cDNA libraries generated from equal quantities of total RNA isolated from untreated cells and cells exposed to LPS (10 ng/mL, 72 h). Illumina-based high-throughput sequencing produced an average of 7.0 GB raw data per group (Table S2 S2 Cross-dataset identification of LPS-Induced differentially expressed genes To ensure robust comparability across datasets, we first performed principal component analysis (PCA) on transcriptomic profiles from three independent sources: (1) our MH-S cell raw data (LPS vs. untreated controls), (2) the murine alveolar macrophage dataset GSE225406 GSE40885 2 p GSE225406 GSE40885 ACOD1 CLEC4E 2 2 Fig. 2 The screening of DEGs.

Intersection analysis identified 47 conserved BP terms (e.g., “cellular response to lipopolysaccharide”, “innate immune response”, “inflammatory response”, “defense response to virus/bacterium/protozoan”, “apoptotic process” and “ERK1/ERK2 cascade”) and 25 shared KEGG pathways (e.g., “TNF signaling”, “cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”, “pathways in cancer”, “NOD-like receptor signaling”, and “efferocytosis”) across all datasets (FDR < 0.05; Figs. 3 4 S3 Fig. 3 GO enrichment analysis.

The diagram depicts a network analysis of common DEGs, where each node represents a protein with distinct levels of expression. We submitted 49 overlapping DEGs to the STRING database (v12.0, medium confidence score ≥ 0.4) to visualize their relationships as a network. To enhance the network’s clarity, we established a threshold of a minimum interaction score of 0.4 and omitted disconnected nodes. A total of 265 edges comprising the entire network were generated. The interaction network was divided into three parts according to K-means clustering, as shown in Fig. 5 The cytoHubba tool was then used to identify the top 20 hub genes within this network, which we regarded as candidate core genes. Subsequently, we queried the GeneCards database to search for potential target genes associated with ALI pathogenesis. The search query was formulated using Boolean operators as follows: (“Alveolar macrophages” AND (“Acute Lung Injury” OR “ALI” OR “Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome” OR “ARDS”)). This query aimed to retrieve genes that were both related to AMs and implicated in ALI/ARDS. Upon retrieving the GeneCards data, we focused on the Relevance score, a metric provided by the database to gauge the degree of association between genes and the search terms. Although the Relevance score did not have an absolute cutoff, we primarily considered genes with Relevance Scores exceeding the dataset mean (≥ 19.6) as potential candidates. The list of potential target genes obtained from GeneCards was then cross-referenced with our 20 pre-identified hub genes. After comparison and verification, 10 genes emerged as core genes common to both datasets: STAT1 CCL5 PTGS2 HIF1A CCR5 ISG15 CD38 MX1 IRF7 CLEC4E 5 Fig. 5 The PPI network of common DEGs was constructed using the STRING online database, followed by module analysis. ( A) B) Validation of overlapping DEGs by qRT-PCR, Western blotting, immunohistochemical staining, and Immunofluorescence staining To validate the common DEGs derived from bioinformatics, we assessed the relative mRNA expression levels of some common DEGs in MH-S cells treated with LPS (10 ng/mL), using qRT-PCR.

Confocal microscopy with z-sectioning revealed that debris (identified by PKH26 staining) was localized within the cytoplasm of Stab2-positive macrophages. A single confocal slice demonstrated that some apoptotic cytoplasmic debris was surrounded by higher concentrations of Stab2 staining compared to the surrounding plasma membrane (Fig. 7 7 Fig. 7 LPS inhibits the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by MH-S cells.

Using an LPS-induced MH-S cell model and publicly available murine ( GSE225406 GSE40885 CLEC4E IRF7 ISG15 ACOD1 TNIP3 Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AM-mediated ALI/ARDS. The conserved upregulation of genes such as STAT1 CCL5 PTGS2 HIF1A 20 21 22 PTGS2 COX2 23 24 25 26 Moreover, we validated the upregulation of TNIP3 and, for the first time, discovered that long-term LPS stimulation (72 h) induces significant nuclear translocation of TNIP3 protein in MH-S cells. This discovery expands the understanding of TNIP3’s role in inflammation regulation: previous studies have primarily focused on TNIP3’s cytoplasmic functions in suppressing classical inflammatory pathways such as NF-κB, for example, by inhibiting the activation of TRAF6 and IKKβ downstream of TLR4 to block NF-κB-dependent expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α) [ 27 28 Functional enrichment analysis on DEGs from each dataset and the shared DEGs revealed significant enrichment of GO terms in biological processes, including immune-inflammatory responses, cellular signaling transduction, cell migration and apoptosis, and antiviral defense mechanisms. KEGG pathway analysis further highlighted inflammation/infection-related pathways (e.g., “Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction”, “TNF signaling”, and “Toll-like/NOD-like receptor signaling”) and cancer-associated pathways. Consistent with established mechanisms [ 29 30 31 32 21 31 33 The enrichment of antiviral pathways (“defense response to virus,” “cytosolic DNA-sensing”) suggests that LPS-induced interferon signaling may enhance macrophage antiviral capacity. LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6) upregulate interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), indirectly enhancing antiviral effector production [ 34 35 20 36 37 To further explore the functional relationships among common DEGs, we constructed a PPI network and applied K-means clustering to categorize the nodes into three distinct clusters. The red cluster is related to “Interferon Alpha/Beta Signaling”, suggesting that although LPS itself is a bacterial product, the interferon signal it induces may enhance the host’s defense against potential viral infections through cross-reactivity. The green cluster is related to “Interleukin-10 Signaling”. IL-10 is a classic anti-inflammatory cytokine that induces STAT3 phosphorylation and entry into the nucleus by activating the JAK1-TYK2-STAT3 signaling pathway, selectively inhibiting the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes (such as TNF-α, IL-6) [ 38 39 40 STAT1 CCL5 PTGS2 HIF1A CCR5 ISG15 CD38 MX1 IRF7 CLEC4E 41 42 43 Beyond the LPS-induced bacterial model explored here, our identification of conserved core genes in AMs holds potential relevance for ARDS of diverse etiologies, particularly viral infections. Notably, several genes within our signature, such as ISG15 and MX1, are classical ISGs with well-established roles in antiviral defense [ 34 44 45 44 46 Notably, all datasets showed “Efferocytosis” pathway enrichment, reflecting AMs’ critical phagocytic function [ 47 48 49 Finally, we validated the cross-species conservation and diagnostic potential of a set of core genes (including CLEC4E IRF7 ISG15 GSE121871 CCL5 PTGS2 HIF1A CLEC4E GSE243066 CLEC4E IRF7 STAT1 16 As the direct site of pathological changes, AMs obtained via bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) represent an ideal sample source for validating and applying these core genes. Measuring the gene expression of AMs in BALF can most accurately reflect the local inflammatory microenvironment driving ARDS. However, BAL is invasive, which limits its routine use. PBMs serve as a less invasive and more readily accessible alternative sample. We found that the core gene signature retains discriminative capacity in PBMs despite their reflection of systemic conditions; this is promising for potential point-of-care testing applications. While PBM-based signatures may be less specific than those from AMs in BALF for solely assessing lung injury, they can function as valuable screening tools or prognostic indicators. Our research has some limitations. First, our predictions are based on bioinformatics analysis; functional validation in animal models and clinical samples is needed to confirm their causal roles in ARDS, so further experimental verification is required. Second, we did not consider the factor of time variation, while alveolar Macrophage genes have a dynamic change pattern. Third, currently, no appropriate clinical data have been found to verify the possibility of using the gene set including these 10 core genes as a biomarker for diagnosing ALI/ARDS, and direct validation in alveolar macrophages from ARDS patients is necessary to confirm clinical relevance.
