Dandy-Walker syndrome is a rare congenital malformation of the posterior fossa that presents unique anesthetic challenges, including difficult airway management, altered consciousness, hydrocephalus, and potential for prolonged postoperative ventilation. Hydrocephalus, the most common finding, can complicate ventilation and intubation, whereas brainstem involvement, along with agenesis of the corpus callosum, pontine hypoplasia, and distortion of the medullary respiratory centers, may contribute to prolonged postoperative ventilation. Anesthetic management in such cases requires thorough airway assessment, preparation for potential airway difficulties, intracranial pressure monitoring and control, and total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) to facilitate rapid emergence. We describe the case of a 3-year-old male with macrocephaly, movement disorders, delayed cognitive development, and altered mental status, scheduled for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement under TIVA without muscle relaxants, with careful airway preparation and intracranial pressure control. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Dandy-Walker syndrome managed in this manner.

It is associated with increased intracranial pressure and neurological impairment. The estimated incidence is approximately 1 in 30,000 live births [ 1 2 4 Hydrocephalus represents the most common neurological manifestation, occurring in approximately 70-90% of cases. This frequently necessitates early neurosurgical intervention due to progressive intracranial hypertension and its adverse effects on neurodevelopment. Encephalocele is reported in about 16% of patients, while structural abnormalities of the corpus callosum, including hypoplasia or complete agenesis, are found in nearly 30%, further contributing to the complexity of the neurodevelopmental profile [ 4 Clinically, Dandy-Walker syndrome is characterized by signs of increased intracranial pressure, macrocephaly, headache, nausea, and vomiting, alongside cerebellar signs such as movement disorders, respiratory difficulties, diminished gag reflex, poor nutritional status, and delayed neurodevelopment. Hydrocephalus remains the main surgical indication, with ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement being the standard approach. We present the case of an infant diagnosed with Dandy-Walker syndrome within the first months of life after seizure onset. The diagnosis was confirmed through imaging and clinical evaluation. The patient underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement under general anesthesia. In this case, particular emphasis was placed on the use of total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and the deliberate avoidance of muscle relaxants to address the potential for difficult endotracheal intubation, facilitate rapid emergence, and reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. This approach underscores the importance of tailoring anesthetic management to the unique neuroanatomical and respiratory challenges presented by Dandy-Walker syndrome. Case Report Investigations A 3-year-old male patient, weighing 21 kg, was admitted to our institution for surgical management of Dandy-Walker syndrome. The planned procedure was a ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. The patient was born at term, with the first clinical signs of the condition appearing at 2.5 years of age, prompting referral to a pediatric neurologist and subsequent imaging studies. The diagnosis of Dandy-Walker syndrome was based on the presence of hydrocephalus, dilation of the fourth ventricle, and cerebellar hypoplasia ( Figs. 1 3 Figure 1 Preoperative head MRI demonstrating agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, dilatation of the fourth ventricle, and hydrocephalus (arrows). MRI: magnetic resonance imaging. Figure 2 Preoperative head MRI demonstrating significant hydrocephaly (arrow). MRI: magnetic resonance imaging. Figure 3 Preoperative head MRI demonstrating agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, significant hydrocephaly (arrows). MRI: magnetic resonance imaging. The clinical presentation was dominated by signs of increased intracranial pressure, including agitation, altered mental status, nausea, vomiting, deviated eyes, and impaired motor coordination ( Fig. 4 Figs. 5 6 Figure 4 Eye deviation. Figure 5 Mild micrognathia. Figure 6 Mallampati class II-III. Diagnosis No premedication was administered due to the patient’s decreased level of consciousness and the associated risk of aspiration during anesthesia induction. Standard plus intracranial pressure monitoring was applied, and a 22-gauge peripheral intravenous cannula was inserted ( Figs. 7 8 Fig. 9 Figure 7 ICP monitoring (ICP was 15 mm Hg, in arrow). ICP: increased intracranial pressure. Figure 8 Standard monitoring. Figure 9 Video laryngoscopy intubation. Treatment General anesthesia was induced with intravenous administration of propofol at a dose of 2 mg/kg and fentanyl at 3 µg/kg to ensure adequate hypnosis and analgesia. Anesthesia maintenance was performed using TIVA, consisting of continuous infusions of propofol at 200 µg/kg/min and remifentanil at 0.3 µg/kg/min, allowing for stable hemodynamic conditions and rapid emergence. No neuromuscular drugs were used. The surgical procedure was completed without intraoperative complications. Upon completion of surgery, the patient met extubation criteria and was successfully extubated in the operating room. No episodes of apnea or respiratory failure were observed during the 30-min observation period in the operating room following extubation. Follow-up and outcomes Postoperatively, the patient was transferred in stable condition to the ward for further monitoring and recovery. After postoperative imaging (head MRI) and abdominal ultrasound was performed, the patient was discharged home ( Figs. 10 11 Figure 10 Postoperative MRI indicating shunt catheter in arrow.

Discussion Dandy-Walker syndrome represents a complex spectrum of intracranial malformations with significant clinical and anesthetic implications. The constellation of anomalies, including hydrocephalus, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and cystic dilation of the fourth ventricle, presents multiple perioperative challenges. Anesthetic management requires preparedness for elevated intracranial pressure, difficult airway scenarios often compounded by craniofacial dysmorphisms, and potential postoperative respiratory complications related to brainstem dysfunction. Pediatric patients further require specialized expertise, particularly in establishing and maintaining peripheral venous access. Comprehensive preoperative assessment and multidisciplinary planning are essential to optimize outcomes [ 5 6 While principles of pediatric neurosurgical anesthesia resemble those in adults, unique challenges arise due to congenital anomalies, distinct tumor types, and variable anatomical localizations. Key considerations include monitoring and controlling intracranial pressure, managing difficult airways, securing venous access, maintaining age-appropriate mean arterial pressure, and preventing hypoxia or hypercapnia [ 6 7 Airway evaluation is critical in patients with craniofacial or neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Features such as macrocephaly, micrognathia, macroglossia, and cervical spine anomalies can increase the risk of difficult mask ventilation and intubation [ 8 9 9 Postoperative respiratory failure remains a major concern, as central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities including corpus callosum agenesis, pontine hypoplasia, and medullary respiratory center distortion may impair respiratory drive and airway reflexes [ 10 10 Reversal of neuromuscular blockade is a critical step in anesthesia to ensure safe postoperative recovery when muscle relaxants are used. Two primary approaches, quantitative train-of-four monitoring and clinical judgment, are used to assess residual blockade. TOF monitoring provides objective, real-time data that improve the accuracy of reversal agent dosing and reduce the risk of postoperative respiratory complications [ 11 12 13 14 14 Based on this experience, ultrashort-acting agents such as propofol and remifentanil, combined with avoidance of muscle relaxants, are recommended to minimize postoperative respiratory complications [ 15 16 17 17 18 19 20 Effective postoperative pain management is essential. Opioid use may be limited due to potential respiratory depression and altered consciousness, while NSAIDs are constrained by bleeding risk. Multimodal analgesia, including regional techniques, NSAIDs, dexmedetomidine, paracetamol, ketamine, and scalp blocks, is effective for controlling postoperative pain, reserving opioids for insufficient pain control [ 21 24 Generally, careful evaluation by both neurosurgeons and anesthesiologists is essential to ensure patient safety and optimize prognosis. This assessment begins with determining the indication and timing of surgery, which should be guided by an individualized approach from both surgical and anesthetic teams. In children with posterior fossa arachnoid cysts, management decisions should be based primarily on clinical presentation rather than radiological findings. Pesaresi et al found that a “wait and see” approach is effective for asymptomatic patients, while surgical decisions should consider cyst location, hydrocephalus, and patient age. Age < 12 months, hydrocephalus, macrocephaly, and shunt placement increase the risk of re-surgery. Outcomes were similar across microsurgical, endoscopic, and shunting procedures, highlighting the importance of individualized treatment planning [ 25 Our anesthetic strategy, summarized in Table 1 Table 1 Key Considerations and Recommended Actions in Pediatric Neuroanesthesia for Patients With Dandy-Walker Syndrome [ 7 9 Situation Management considerations Recommended actions Pediatric neuroanesthesia expertise Requires specialized pediatric and neuroanesthetic skills Fellowship or extended training programs for advanced experience Airway management 1) Macrocephaly, micrognathia, macroglossia; 1) Thorough preoperative airway assessment; Intubation High risk of failed conventional intubation 1) Prepare alternative devices; 2) Ensure rapid, atraumatic intubation Anesthetic technique 1) Risk of postoperative respiratory complications; 1) Total intravenous anesthesia with short-acting agents; Postoperative respiratory care Risk of apnea, aspiration, atelectasis, prolonged ventilation 1) Close monitoring in postanesthesia care unit; Pain management Limitations due to respiratory depression and bleeding risk 1) Multimodal analgesia (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol, ketamine, dexmedetomidine, regional techniques); Cardiac and other congenital anomalies Possible coexisting defects Comprehensive preoperative evaluation including electrocardiography and echocardiography Conclusions Pediatric neuroanesthesia requires dual expertise in both pediatric and neuroanesthetic management. Patients with Dandy-Walker syndrome present unique perioperative challenges, necessitating comprehensive preoperative evaluation. Special attention should be paid to associated congenital anomalies, particularly cardiac malformations, airway abnormalities, and neurologically related dysfunctions. Careful airway management, including a clearly defined rescue strategy, is essential, along with the use of short-acting anesthetic agents to allow precise control of anesthesia. Muscle relaxants should be avoided if train-of-four monitoring is unavailable, and rapid emergence from anesthesia should be planned to minimize postoperative respiratory complications. The use of total intravenous anesthesia under these principles is recommended to ensure a safe and uneventful anesthetic course. Learning points Pediatric neuroanesthesia is a highly specialized field that demands a skilled and experienced multidisciplinary team. Dandy-Walker syndrome poses distinct challenges, particularly concerning airway management, intracranial pressure control, and the prevention of postoperative respiratory complications. The anesthesia plan prioritized difficult airway management, minimized pulmonary complications with short-acting intravenous agents, avoided muscle relaxants, when possible, used train-of-four monitoring if relaxants were necessary, and ensured rapid emergence.
