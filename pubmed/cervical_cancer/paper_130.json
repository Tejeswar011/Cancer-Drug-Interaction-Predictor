Background Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) have been observed in various tumors, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), where they function as active centers of humoral immunity within the tumor microenvironment, facilitating the production of distinct immunoglobulin (Ig) subtypes with diverse effects. This study aimed to investigate the expression of TLS-associated Ig in ESCC and its prognostic significance. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 109 ESCC cases. TLS presence was evaluated using immunohistochemistry, and the expression of Ig-positive cells was assessed. Additionally, gene expression profiles related to TLS were analyzed with gene chip data from 274 ESCC cases obtained from the GEO database. Results Among the 109 ESCC cases, 69 (63.3%) exhibited TLS, while 40 (36.7%) did not. Patients with TLS demonstrated significantly better prognoses compared to those without TLS (P < 0.001). ESCC tumor tissues with TLS exhibited higher infiltration of Ig-positive immune cells. Among the variables examined, the differential expression of IgG4 was the most pronounced (P = 0.04). Furthermore, ESCC cases exhibiting TLS with elevated IgG4 expression demonstrated a poorer prognosis compared to those with TLS and reduced IgG4 expression (P = 0.036). The presence of TLS in general and low IgG4 expression in TLS were associated with improved survivals in patients who underwent post-surgery chemotherapy (p < 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). Analysis of the GEO dataset indicated that predominant IgG4 expression within TLS was associated with a reduced number of activated CD8+ T cells and an increased presence of CD4+ T helper cells and dendritic cells. The expression of TLS in ESCC was linked to a more favorable prognosis, whereas TLS with increased IgG4 expression correlated with a less favorable prognosis. Conclusions The differential expression of immunoglobulins within TLS can modulate its function within the tumor microenvironment. In addition to the number of TLSs themselves, the immune heterogeneity present within TLS maybe a critical factor in individualized assessment of tumor immunotherapy. esophageal cancer immunoglobulin G4 tertiary lymphoid structure tumor microenvironment prognosis National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/501100001809 The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

According to the 2020 GLOBOCAN global cancer data, the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates of EC worldwide were recorded at 6.3 and 5.6 per 100,000, respectively. However, within China, these Figures surged to 13.8 and 12.7 per 100,000, surpassing those observed in nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom ( 1 2 3 Tumor immunotherapy is a rapidly developing field in cancer treatment. In tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), the interaction between tumor cells and immune cells or molecular components forms a complex system that plays a crucial role in tumor development, prognosis, and treatment. Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are ectopic lymphoid tissues formed in abnormal lymphatic tissues or organ areas and are commonly seen in inflammatory reactions associated with autoimmune diseases, organ transplantation, infections, tumors, and are also known as ectopic lymphoid tissues (ELTs) or tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs) ( 4 5 12 13 14 TLS is rich in activated B cell and plasma cell infiltration and serves as an active center of humoral immunity in TIME. Immunoglobulins (Ig) represent essential immune molecules orchestrating humoral responses, exerting critical anti-tumor effects through diverse mechanisms ( 15 16 This study investigated the distribution characteristics of TLS and the expressions of some relevant Ig subtypes in 109 cases of ESCC in the Chaoshan region of Guangdong Province, China. We examined TLS with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and investigated the impact of TLS and different Ig subtype expression patterns on the prognosis of ESCC. Additionally, we analyzed the molecular pathways associated with different immune expression patterns within TLS employing the GEO database. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Clinical cohort and specimens One hundred and nine cases of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) diagnosed between 2013 and 2019 were obtained at Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks or slides from tumor tissues were collected, along with corresponding clinical and survival information. Basic clinical information and inclusion criteria are detailed in the  Supplementary Materials 2.2 Immunohistochemistry staining and scoring Consecutive sections of paraffin-embedded tissue were utilized for Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE), IHC, and Stain–Decolorize–Stain (SDS) experiments as previously described ( 17  Supplementary Materials Supplementary Table S1 2  Table 1 Table 1 Comparison of TLS characteristics in different developmental states.

Based on a 75% cutoff point in the gene expression levels of IGHG1 and IGHG4, the TLS ESCC group was further classified into four subgroups: a group with low expression of both IgG1 and IgG4 (1 IgG1 low/IgG4 low group), a group with low IgG1 expression and high IgG4 expression (2 IgG1 low/IgG4 high group), a group with high IgG1 expression and low IgG4 expression (3 IgG1 high/IgG4 low group), and a group with high expression of both IgG1 and IgG4 (4 IgG1 high/IgG4 high group). The 28 immune cell gene sets were downloaded from the Tumor-immune system interactions database (TISIDB) ( 20 21 https://www.omicstudio.cn/tool http://www.sangerbox.com 3 Results 3.1 Clinical characteristics and TLS distribution in ESCC specimens Among the 109 cases, there were 89 males (81.7%) and 20 females (18.3%).

Panel B includes labeled stains: CD20, CD21, ki67, with varying distributions and intensities. Each stain highlights different cellular components using specific markers. IgA, IgM, IgG1, and IgG4 stainings were analyzed on tumor tissues from 15 ESCC cases. Among these, 10 cases had TLS, while 5 cases did not (  Figures 2A, B  Figure 2C  Figure 2C Figure 2  (A) (B) (C) Microscopic images and graphs showing immunoglobulin staining.

H) Survival curve for IgG4 levels, with corresponding data. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between the number of TLS and tumor volume size. Tumor volume size was defined as the product of the length, width, and thickness of the tumor, as recorded in the clinical pathology report (mm³). The results showed that the number of TLS in ESCC was significantly negatively correlated with tumor volume size (  Figure 3C The log-rank test was used to assess the significance of differences in survival time among different clinical indicator groups and the presence or absence of TLS in the 109 ESCC cases. The results showed that N stage (P < 0.001), pTNM stage (P = 0.001), alcohol history (P = 0.023), and the presence of TLS (P < 0.001) had significant differences in terms of OS (  Figure 3G  Supplementary Figure S2 The optimal cut off value for the average density of IgG4-positive cells was calculated with X-tile software to be 28.3/mm 2  Figures 3D–F  Figure 3H  Supplementary Figure S3  Supplementary Table S2  Supplementary Table S3 3.4 The impact of TLS and IgG4 expression on prognose in different postoperative treatment patients Out of the 109 patients, 1.8% (2/109) received immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy, and 1.8% (2/109) received immunotherapy combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Immunotherapy drugs included Camrelizumab, with treatment regimens comprising Camrelizumab in conjunction with Tegafur, Gimeracil and Oteracil Potassium Capsules or Camrelizumab combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin. These four patients remained alive and were followed up until July 2024. Among 109 patients, 21% (23/109) received combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy, 17% (19/109) underwent post-operative radiotherapy, 18% (20/109) received postoperative chemotherapy, and the remaining 39% (43/109) did not receive any corresponding treatment after surgery. The impact of TLS and IgG4 on prognosis across different postoperative treatment groups is illustrated in  Figures 4A–L  Figure 4J  Figure 4B Figure 4 The influence of TLS and IgG4 on prognosis including OS and PFS statistics, in different postoperative treatment groups: chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy group (CRT, A, E, I, D B, F, J, H C, G, K, L Twelve Kaplan-Meier survival curves display different treatment effects over time, labeled A to L.

Panel F presents a bar chart of gene ontology results across three categories. Panel G shows a bubble chart of pathway analysis with enrichment scores and p-values. The gene expression signal scores for 28 immune cell-related gene sets were calculated using ssGSEA for the TLS ESCC group. ANOVA and LSD tests were used to compare the differences in immune cell infiltration among four subgroups in the TLS ESCC group (  Figure 5D  Supplementary Figure S5–S10 + + +  Figure 5D +  Supplementary Figure S6 Using differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, genes that showed significant differences were screened using “2 IgG1 low/IgG4 high group” as the experimental group and “3 IgG1 high/IgG4 low group” as the control group, excluding IGHG1 and IGHG4 genes. A total of 1,011 DEGs were obtained, including 728 upregulated genes and 283 downregulated genes (  Figure 5E  Figures 5F, G 4 Discussion The advancements of tumor immunotherapy have been increasingly applied in clinical practice. The importance of TIME in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of tumor and response to treatment has been increasingly appreciated. TLS is an ectopic lymphoid structure formed in the inflammatory response of autoimmune diseases, organ transplantation, infection, tumors, and other diseases. Recently, the distribution characteristics of TLS in different types of tumors, its impact on tumors, its relationship with clinical prognosis and treatment efficacy, and its application as a potential target in tumor immunotherapy have been investigated by a few groups ( 22 25 Most studies suggested that TLS is associated with a good prognosis and can enhance the efficacy of immune therapy. Zhou, et al, found that bladder cancer with high expression of TLS-related genes in the gene expression profiles of 11,835 bladder cancer cases from the TCGA database had favorable prognosis and better responses to PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors ( 25 + 24 + + 26 27 The heterogeneity of TLS has been consistently observed across multiple studies. TLS differing in maturity, density, and spatial location may exert opposing effects on antitumor immunity. TLS are thought to enhance responses to immunotherapy. For example, TLS improved survival in patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors by promoting antibody production and T cell activation in renal cell carcinoma ( 28 28 29 30 31 13 32 34 Our findings demonstrate that TLS exerts a substantial impact on patient survival, and that specific features such as B-cell class switching to IgG4 further modulate prognosis. These observations underscore the functional heterogeneity of TLS and the intricate nature of the immune microenvironment. Perhaps this can also explain why TLS’s prognostic situations were not all alike in recent studies ( 4 35 15 28 36 38 39 40 The immunosuppressive role of IgG4 in tumors is not yet fully understood. However, recent investigations have provided important insights into its underlying mechanisms. As early as 2013, a study on malignant melanoma demonstrated that tumor-induced Th2-type inflammation promotes the accumulation of CD22+ B cells and IgG4+ infiltrating cells within tumors, leading to the polarization of tumor-associated B cells to produce IgG4 ( 41 42 36 38 38 Furthermore, in this study, the GEO database was utilized to study and analyze the gene expression profile related to TLS in ESCC, to further explore the mechanism of the high expression of IgG4 in TLS and its impact on the TIME. The results indicate that high expression of TLS-related IgG4 is associated with less infiltration of activated CD8 + + + 43 in vitro in vitro 37 43 44 45 48 Previous research reported increase of IgG4 levels in the context of chronic infections, immune tolerance, and autoimmune diseases ( 39 49 50 51 The most significant differentially expressed gene related to the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway is IL-17RE, which encodes the receptor protein for IL-17 cytokines ( 52 52 53 54 54 53 55 55 In summary, this study elucidates the cellular composition and morphological characteristics of TLS in ESCC, the expression of TLS-related Ig subtypes, and the association between the distribution of TLS and clinical prognosis. It indicates that ESCC with TLS may have better survival than those without, and ESCC with TLS and high IgG4 expression may lead to different immune cell infiltration patterns and poor prognosis. Analysis of TLS-related gene expression profiles in ESCC suggests that high expression of TLS-related IgG4 may be associated with long-term chronic infection or certain cytokines productions, such as IL-17, further affecting the occurrence, development, and treatment efficacy of tumors. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the relationship between TLS and TIME in ESCC, identifying potential targets for tumor immunotherapy and providing basic data and theoretical basis for further optimizing immunotherapy strategy of ESCC. TLS are emerging as promising targets for immunotherapy. Thus, understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of TLS may help elucidate individual differences in immunotherapeutic response and facilitate the development of more precise therapeutic regimens.
