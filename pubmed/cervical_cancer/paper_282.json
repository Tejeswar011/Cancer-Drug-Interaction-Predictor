Optimal management strategies remain unclear, and prognostic tools for risk stratification are lacking. Objectives: To analyze differences in clinicopathological features, treatment patterns, and survival outcomes between Chinese and American ENEC patients, and to develop a prognostic nomogram for unresectable disease. Design: A retrospective comparative cohort study. Methods: We analyzed 88 ENEC patients from a Chinese institution and 545 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Demographic, tumor, treatment, and survival data were compared using Chi-square tests and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox regression identified prognostic factors for cancer-specific survival. A nomogram for unresectable ENEC was developed using SEER data and evaluated using C-index, calibration curves, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: Significant population differences included age distribution (46–65 years: 51.1% Chinese vs 35.4% SEER, p p p p Conclusion: ENEC demonstrates distinct population-specific characteristics between Chinese and Western patients, with fundamental differences in treatment approaches but comparable surgical outcomes. The validated nomogram provides superior risk stratification for unresectable disease compared to traditional staging. These findings support population-tailored management strategies rather than universal treatment paradigms for ENEC. Plain language summary East meets west: comparing esophageal rare cancer types between Chinese and American patients—what works best for treatment and survival? This study compares a rare but aggressive type of cancer called neuroendocrine carcinoma found in esophagus between Chinese and American patients. We analyzed data from 88 Chinese patients and 545 American patients to understand differences in disease features, treatments, and outcomes. We discovered significant differences between these groups. Chinese patients were generally younger and had tumors more often in the middle part of the food pipe, while American patients typically had tumors in the lower part. The cancer cells also looked different under microscopes in these two groups. Interestingly, Chinese doctors chose surgery much more often (about 78% of cases) than American doctors (only about 9% of cases) for patients whose cancer hadn’t spread. Despite this huge difference in treatment approach, patients who received surgery had similar survival times in both countries. We identified several factors that predict how long patients might survive, with cancer spread and patient age being important in both groups. For patients who couldn’t undergo surgery, we created a prediction tool that doctors can use to estimate survival chances and guide treatment decisions. Our findings suggest that carefully selected patients might benefit from surgery regardless of whether they’re from China or America, challenging current treatment approaches. This research helps doctors better understand this rare cancer and may improve how we treat patients from different backgrounds. comparative analysis esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma nomogram population-specific differences prognostic factors pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes cover-date January-December 2025 typesetter ts1 Introduction Esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (ENEC) represents a rare but highly aggressive subset of esophageal malignancies, characterized by neuroendocrine differentiation, rapid progression, and poor clinical outcomes.  1  2  3 Despite significant advances in understanding more common esophageal malignancies, the molecular landscape, clinical behavior, and optimal management strategies for ENEC remain poorly defined. This knowledge deficit is particularly evident when comparing research outputs from Eastern and Western populations. 4 5 6 7 The epidemiological profile of ENEC exhibits notable variations across populations. While Western literature predominantly describes lower esophageal involvement with associations to Barrett’s esophagus and gastroesophageal reflux disease, reports from Asian countries suggest different anatomical predilections and potentially distinct risk factors. 8 9 10 11 Treatment approaches for ENEC remain heterogeneous and largely extrapolated from management paradigms for small cell lung cancer or non-neuroendocrine esophageal malignancies, rather than being evidence-based for this specific entity. 12 13 5 14 2 15 Prognostic stratification for ENEC patients remains challenging. Traditional staging systems designed for conventional esophageal cancers or small cell carcinomas may not adequately capture the unique biological behavior of ENEC.  16 11 17 Our study aims to address these critical knowledge gaps by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of demographic characteristics, clinicopathological features, treatment approaches, and prognostic factors between a Chinese ENEC cohort and patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database in the United States. We hypothesize that significant differences exist in disease presentation, management strategies, and prognostic determinants between these populations. Additionally, we seek to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram specifically for unresectable ENEC patients, a particularly vulnerable subgroup with limited therapeutic options and poorly characterized outcomes. This investigation not only enhances our understanding of geographical and ethnic variations in ENEC but also provides clinically relevant tools for risk stratification and treatment planning for this challenging malignancy. Materials and methods Study design and patient selection This retrospective comparative study analyzed two distinct cohorts of patients with histologically confirmed primary ENEC: a Chinese cohort from a single academic institution and a Western cohort derived from a population-based cancer registry. The reporting of this study conforms to the STROBE statement (Supplemental File 1).  18 For the Chinese cohort, we identified patients diagnosed with primary ENEC at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University between January 2007 and December 2022. Pathological diagnosis was established according to the 2019 World Health Organization classification criteria for neuroendocrine neoplasms, requiring characteristic morphological features (nested/trabecular growth pattern, salt-and-pepper chromatin) and positive immunohistochemical staining for at least two neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin, chromogranin A, or CD56/NCAM) in >20% of tumor cells.  19 The Western cohort was extracted from the SEER database (18 registries, November 2022 submission) using SEER★Stat software version 8.4.1 ( https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/ Data collection and outcome measures For the Chinese cohort, data were systematically extracted from electronic medical records by two independent investigators, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Collected variables included demographic characteristics (age, sex), tumor-specific parameters (anatomical location, histological subtype, TNM classification according to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system), presence and sites of distant metastases, treatment modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy), and survival outcomes. Pathological specimens were reviewed by two experienced pathologists specializing in gastrointestinal malignancies. For the SEER cohort, we extracted comparable demographic, clinicopathological, treatment, and survival data using standardized SEER variables. Tumor location was categorized as upper third (cervical esophagus, C15.0), middle third (C15.1), lower third (C15.2, C15.5), overlapping (C15.8), or esophagus not otherwise specified (C15.9). TNM staging information was derived from the SEER-specific collaborative staging and AJCC staging variables. Metastatic sites were identified using relevant SEER site-specific metastasis codes. The primary endpoint was cancer-specific survival (CSS), defined as the interval from initial diagnosis to death attributed to esophageal cancer or last follow-up. Patients who died from causes unrelated to esophageal cancer were censored at the date of death for CSS analysis. Statistical analysis Categorical variables were compared between cohorts using Pearson’s Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test when appropriate. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with differences assessed by log-rank test. Median survival time with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated for both cohorts and relevant subgroups. Univariate Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify potential prognostic factors associated with CSS. Variables with p All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R version 4.3.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Two-sided p Development and validation of prognostic nomogram To enhance risk stratification for unresectable ENEC patients, we developed a prognostic nomogram using data from 250 non-surgically treated patients with complete clinical information from the SEER cohort. This unresectable cohort includes patients with metastatic (M1) disease and those with localized but unresectable tumors (e.g., advanced T4 or nodal involvement deemed inoperable per SEER treatment records). These patients were randomly divided into a training set ( n n Variables were selected for the nomogram based on univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis of the SEER training set ( n The model’s clinical utility was further evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, with area under the curve (AUC) calculated for both the training and validation sets. Internal validation was performed using 1000 bootstrap resamples to assess potential model overfitting, while external validation was conducted using the validation set. Decision curve analysis was performed to determine the range of threshold probabilities for which the nomogram provides clinical net benefit. The nomogram development and validation were performed using the “rms,” “survival,” “timeROC,” and “DecisionCurve” packages in R software ( https://www.r-project.org/ Results Demographic and clinicopathological characteristics Our analysis included 545 patients from the SEER database (Western cohort) and 88 patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University (Chinese cohort) diagnosed with ENEC.

Discussion This study presents one of the most comprehensive comparative analyses of ENEC between Eastern and Western populations to date. Our findings revealed significant differences in tumor characteristics, treatment approaches, and prognostic factors between Chinese and American patients. The striking disparities in tumor location—with Chinese patients exhibiting more middle esophageal tumors (26.1% vs 16.9%) and fewer lower esophageal tumors (22.7% vs 62.2%)—likely reflect distinct etiological factors. Western populations experience higher rates of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett’s esophagus affecting the distal esophagus, while in China, different dietary habits, environmental exposures, and genetic factors may contribute to the middle esophageal predominance. Similarly, the remarkable histological differences, with small cell carcinoma predominating in the SEER cohort (76.9% vs 38.6%) but adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation more prevalent in the Chinese cohort (38.6% vs 8.8%), suggest both biological differences and variations in diagnostic practices across regions. The earlier clinical presentation observed in Chinese patients, with 71.6% presenting without distant metastases compared to only 45.9% in the SEER cohort, could reflect differences in screening practices, healthcare access patterns, or potentially different biological behavior. This finding aligns with previous research suggesting more frequent endoscopic screening programs in Asian populations, resulting in earlier tumor detection. 20 21 The most notable disparity was observed in the rates of surgical intervention, with 77.8% of non-metastatic Chinese patients undergoing surgery compared to merely 8.8% of SEER patients. This fundamental divergence in treatment philosophy reflects the more aggressive surgical approach traditionally favored in Asian countries for localized NETs, whereas Western practice patterns typically favor non-surgical approaches for small cell histologies based on extrapolation from small cell lung cancer management. Remarkably, despite this pronounced treatment disparity, median CSS for surgically treated patients was similar between cohorts (Chinese: 44 months, SEER: 30 months; p Our multivariate analyses identified both shared and population-specific prognostic factors. In both cohorts, metastatic disease and age emerged as powerful independent predictors of survival. However, the substantially larger effect size for M1 disease in the Chinese cohort (HR = 49.74 vs 1.96 in SEER) suggests potential differences in biological behavior or post-progression treatment efficacy. The Chinese cohort demonstrated a wider array of independent prognostic factors, including tumor location, histological subtype, T stage, and N stage, possibly reflecting the higher proportion of surgical specimens, allowing for more precise pathological assessment. The observation that adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation conferred better outcomes in the Chinese cohort challenges the view that all high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasms share similarly poor prognoses and suggests potential benefits from histology-specific treatment approaches. The prognostic nomogram developed in this study addresses a critical need for accurate risk stratification in unresectable ENEC. With a C-index of 0.725 and excellent calibration, this tool integrates five readily available clinical variables—age, tumor location, N stage, M stage, and receipt of chemotherapy—ensuring practical applicability in diverse clinical settings. The model’s particularly strong performance in predicting 24-month survival (AUC 0.82–0.87) makes it valuable for identifying patients with unresectable disease who may achieve longer-term survival with appropriate management; however, external validation in independent datasets (e.g., non-SEER cohorts) is necessary before it can be widely applied in clinical practice. Several limitations warrant consideration. The retrospective design introduces potential selection biases, including the unavoidable risk that patients selected for surgery may have had inherently better prognostic factors (e.g., younger age, fewer comorbidities, or earlier disease stages not fully captured in the data), which could confound treatment-outcome associations. Additionally, the criteria for surgical eligibility (e.g., based on T/N/M stage, overall physical condition, or institutional protocols) are not clearly delineated in the retrospective data, particularly in the SEER cohort, raising concerns about comparability between groups and amplifying the risk of selection bias in the surgical cohort. The marked imbalance in cohort sizes (SEER: n n n TP53 RB1 Despite these limitations, our findings have important clinical implications. The substantial differences between Chinese and Western ENEC patients highlight the need for population-specific approaches. The relatively favorable outcomes in surgically treated patients suggest that surgical resection should be considered for appropriately selected patients regardless of histological subtype. The nomogram provides a practical tool for risk stratification in unresectable ENEC, potentially facilitating more informed treatment decisions. Future research should focus on prospective validation in larger, multinational cohorts with standardized pathological assessment, as well as integration of genomic and biomarker analyses (e.g., TP53 RB1 Conclusion Our comparative analysis reveals significant heterogeneity in ENEC between Chinese and Western populations. Chinese patients present with distinctive features, including younger age, predominance of middle esophageal involvement, higher rates of adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation, and earlier stage at diagnosis. The substantially higher utilization of surgical intervention in Chinese patients highlights a fundamental divergence in treatment philosophy. Notably, similar survival outcomes in surgically treated patients from both cohorts suggest potential benefit from surgical approaches in appropriately selected patients regardless of ethnicity. The prognostic nomogram developed for unresectable disease provides a practical tool that outperforms conventional staging systems, potentially enhancing clinical decision-making. Our findings indicate that management strategies should be contextualized to specific patient populations rather than universally extrapolated from small cell lung cancer paradigms. Future research incorporating molecular characterization across ethnic groups and dedicated clinical trials for ENEC-specific treatments may advance more personalized therapeutic approaches for this aggressive malignancy.
