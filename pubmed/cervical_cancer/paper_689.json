According to estimations, the number of cases will increase in the future. Therefore, the costs associated with the disease will also increase. We conducted a literature review of the state of knowledge about the costs of treatment and the economic burden of breast cancer. We focused on the estimates of direct costs, i.e., treatment of breast cancer, adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment, supportive care and indirect costs. A few specific combinations of drugs were cost-effective only under the condition of decreasing the unit prices of a medication. Further summarizing reviews and developing a methodology for standardized comparisons are necessary.

Introduction Breast cancer is the most common malignant cancer among women, following lung cancer in the general population. In terms of mortality, breast cancer ranks fourth. According to information provided by the World Health Organization, the global incidence in 2022 was 1,871,979 cases. The age-standardized incidence rate was 46.8/100,000 [ 1 2 The main risk factors for breast cancer include advancing age, starting menstruation before age 12, beginning menopause after age 55, having dense breasts, a personal history of breast cancer or non-cancerous breast conditions, a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and prior radiation therapy treatment [ 3 4 5 6 7 Breast cancer is a chronic disease and it requires long-term treatment, which is expensive and usually limits the social and professional life of patients. The diagnosis affects entire families, causing emotional distress and requiring family members to take on caregiving responsibilities. This emotional toll extends to patients’ social lives, where they report withdrawing from social activities due to physical weakness, treatment side effects, and emotional distress, further diminishing their quality of life. Moreover, breast cancer imposes substantial financial strain on patients and families, with survivors often experiencing worsened financial status during and after treatment despite assistance; one study found financial distress scores remained significantly elevated post-treatment [ 8 The first category of costs primarily includes the healthcare system’s expenses for medical services, as well as patients’ out-of-pocket costs for treatment, such as expenses for medications and medical supplies. The second category covers the costs of lost productivity due to sickness absence or presenteeism [ 9 10 Since breast cancer is a serious disease regarding prevalence, costs and prognosis and new research projects on the matter are published every year, we found it important to summarize their findings. Therefore, we aimed to provide answers to the following research question: what are the current direct and indirect costs associated with breast cancer according to latest research and what types of treatment were found to be cost-effective? We focused on the estimates of direct costs, i.e., treatment of breast cancer, adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment, supportive care and indirect costs. Also, we aimed to provide a response to the following research question: what types of costs are mostly focused on in the latest research and what type of gap exists in the published literature. 2. Materials and Methods A literature review was conducted to summarize the state of knowledge about the costs of treatment and the economic burden of breast cancer within MEDLINE and Academic Search Ultimate databases. We applied the following query: (breast cancer) AND (cost OR costs OR economic analysis OR economic evaluation OR economic loss OR expenditure OR spend OR expense OR burden OR productivity OR costs OR cost analysis). We limited the scope to papers published in 2024 and 2025. We also applied additional filters limiting the papers acquired to the ones focused on humans and providing the answers to clinical questions focusing on costs and economics. The study was registered in the PROSPERO system under the number CRD420251131809. The criteria for inclusion of publications according to the PICOS scheme are presented in Table 1 We included papers that were based on Markov model simulations, partitioned survival models, medical records, surveys or systematic reviews. Markov models in the field of health economic evaluation provide means to estimate the probability of transition to other health states, costs and health benefits using the current data as a basis and taking the perspective focused on the future of patients, their quality of life and associated costs [ 11 The partitioned survival models are frequently used within oncology modelling [ 12 3. Results The PRISMA schema is depicted in Figure 1 The search performed within the records of databases led to 199 papers. After title and abstract verification of relevancy to the subject, we limited the number of articles to 56. Next, full-text verification was performed and it ended up with 27 papers included in the final analysis. For this, two authors evaluated the abstracts of the publications, qualifying them for further analysis. Potentially eligible publications were then independently reviewed by another two authors. All doubts regarding further inclusion of the publications in the review were resolved by consensus of the entire team of authors. We excluded the studies devoted to breast cancer screening, studies focused on other types of cancer and studies focused on survival rates. Table 2 Table 2 The review of the results acquired in the studies included is divided into sections for direct costs, i.e., treatment of breast cancer, adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment, supportive care and indirect costs. It gives answers to our first research question as it provides the results regarding costs of breast cancer and cost-effectiveness analysis. In the following sections, we provide estimates in the currency used by the authors of the original papers. Also, if the authors used currency other than USD, we converted it into USD using the annual mean of operational rates of exchange. These rates are provided by the United Nations Treasury [ 13 cancers-17-03012-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Characteristics of publications included in the review.

Direct Costs 3.1.1. Treatment of Breast Cancer A cost effectiveness study [ 14 The treatment with Trastuzumab deruxtecan was also evaluated for the group of patients with HER2+ unresectable and/or metastatic breast cancer [ 15 Treatment based on biosimilar intravenous trastuzumab was more economical than treatment based on subcutaneous trastuzumab in Malaysia [ 16 In Indonesia, treating HER-2 positive early breast cancer with trastuzumab and chemotherapy was compared to chemotherapy alone [ 17 Trastuzumab-Emtansine was found to be close to cost-effectiveness in Iran for HER2+ breast cancer [ 18 In the four studies cited, above Trastuzumab or Trastuzumab deruxtecan was found to be cost-effective treatment for patients with HER2+ breast cancer. Trastuzumab-Emtansine, an alternative to Trastuzumab in addressing resistance to trastuzumab, demonstrated close cost-effectiveness. CDK4/6 inhibitors, i.e., palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib, were proven to be effective in treating HR-positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2−) breast cancer [ 19 The addition of capivasertib to fulvestrant in treating HR-positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2−) breast cancer was associated with an additional cost of USD 410,765 yielding 1.46QAL [ 20 A study [ 21 The use of abemaciclib and ribociclib, CDK4/6 inhibitors, with letrozole in treatment of HR-positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2−) breast cancer was also evaluated in India taking two scenarios into consideration [ 22 Talazoparib was evaluated for treating advanced HER2− breast cancer with germline BRCA1/2 mutations from the perspective of the health sector in China and in the United States [ 23 Olaparib, another PARP inhibitor with positive outcomes in treating HER2− early-stage cancer, was not found to be cost-effective in the United States or in China [ 24 In the six studies cited above regarding patients with HER2− breast cancer, CDK4/6 inhibitors, specifically abemaciclib, and talazoparib, a PARP inhibitor, were shown to be cost-effective. Sacituzumab govitecan was proven to be not cost-effective for patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer compared with chemotherapy [ 25 For the same population of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, toripalimab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, was demonstrated to be cost-effective [ 26 However, in another study [ 27 Out of the three studies regarding treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer, only one concluded that one type of treatment (Toripalimab plus chemotherapy) was cost-effective. Table 3 The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for preventing febrile neutropenia in the course of the treating breast cancer with high-risk chemotherapy treatment was evaluated [ 28 Robotic mastectomy was found to be associated with higher upfront costs, but also higher long-term QALY gains when compared to conventional mastectomy [ 29 The costs of reoperations in the population of patients with breast cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery were estimated in another study [ 30 The cost associated with delayed or forgone care of breast cancer was also estimated [ 31 In a retrospective cost-of-illness analysis involving medical history of 525 patients in Iran, the total economic burden of breast cancer was estimated to be equal to USD 5394,409.13, with a mean of USD 10,275.07 per patient [ 32 33 A cost-of-illness analysis of breast cancer patients in Dubai [ 34 In Canada [ 35 In a study conducted in Türkiye, the mean annual cost for newly diagnosed breast cancer was estimated to be equal to USD 21,595.62 for a patient if cancer was metastatic and USD 4490.76 for a patient if cancer was non-metastatic [ 36 HR-positive/HER2-negative (HR+/HER2−) breast cancer were the most frequent diagnostic categories taken into consideration. According to the studies reviewed above, some specific combinations of drugs may be cost-effective only under the condition of dropping the prices of a medication. 3.1.2. Adjuvant and Neoadjuvant Treatment The cost-utility of neoadjuvant treatment with the use of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab or lapatinib, another monoclonal antibody, compared to single therapy with trastuzumab and chemotherapy was analysed [ 37 Abemaciclib, an CDK4/6 inhibitor, for the adjuvant treatment of luminal HER2 was proved not to be cost effective in Spain [ 38 Only two studies were focused on adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment and both were country specific, with from Sri Lanka and the other from Spain. 3.1.3. Supportive Care Computer application management of electronic patient-reported outcomes was evaluated in terms of cost-effectiveness [ 39 3.2. Indirect Costs In a retrospective cost-of-illness analysis involving medical history of 525 patients [ 32 40 32 In a study conducted in Türkiye, the total indirect cost was estimated to be equal to USD 982,867,753.58, USD 815,199,359.02 for newly diagnosed patients and USD 169,767,030.43 for patients diagnosed previously [ 36 4. Discussion The majority of papers were focused on direct costs of treatment. Most studies were focused on comparisons within the same-drug class, and the majority of them led to favorable conclusions. This finding is consistent with another review on the topic [ 41 The comparison of different treatments regarding cost effectiveness is difficult because of complexity. Different studies use different units for assessing the costs, especially when comparing different countries, but also the cost effectiveness depends on the precise diagnostic category and on the stage of a disease. The same is true for indirect costs as the estimations yield wide confidence intervals. The estimated numbers of new cases of breast cancer are supposed to grow in the coming years, which inevitably will lead to an increase in all types of costs. Therefore, summarizing reviews and developing a methodology for standardized comparisons are necessary. Our review is limited. Firstly, the scope of this paper based on the systematic review methodology is limited to the papers included in the MEDLINE database only. Moreover, the evaluations of direct costs from different studies use different units depending on the currency specific to the region studied in each paper and this impedes comparisons because the relative value of currency when exchanged to another currency changes over time. Also, the accessibility of papers focused on indirect costs is limited as they are all country-specific, which is a key limitation as well. 5. Conclusions Current evidence indicates that cost-of-illness studies on breast cancer mostly concentrate on direct medical expenditures, while indirect costs and broader societal consequences remain sparsely examined. This imbalance limited a full estimate of the disease’s economic burden and restricted cross-study comparability. The article therefore underscores the need for more comprehensive investigations that integrate both direct and indirect cost components and adopt standardized costing frameworks. Such methodological harmonization would improve the accuracy of economic estimates and guide more informed resource allocation. Addressing these research gaps is essential for shaping cost-effective policies and ultimately enhancing the management and system response to breast cancer. The breast cancer incidence will increase in the future. At the same time, access to appropriate treatment may remain different depending on the level of income in a country. For example, in China, the out-of-pocket money paid by patients for health in 2022 is USD 381, USD 125 in India, USD 551 in Poland, USD 1.380 in the USA and USD 378 in Iran [ 42 43 44 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, I.G., A.C. and K.R.; methodology, I.G., O.P., A.C. and T.C.; formal analysis, M.P., A.D. and A.B.-K.; writing—original draft preparation, M.B., K.S., P.W.-B. and J.D.; writing—review and editing, P.P., D.W.-C., J.P., E.B. and W.C.; visualization, E.G., A.M.C. and D.S.-M.; supervision, P.I. and R.K.; project administration, A.C., M.P. and O.P.
