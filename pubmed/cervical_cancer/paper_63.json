Introduction Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by colonic mucosal inflammation, compromised intestinal barrier function, and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Current therapies often have significant limitations, including adverse effects, highlighting the need for safer alternatives. Periplaneta americana Materials To address this gap, this study investigated the composition and therapeutic activity of PAW and its sequentially fractionated components based on molecular weight: PAW1 (< 3 kDa), PAW2 (3-10 kDa), and PAW3 (> 10 kDa) using membrane separation. Using a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC model in C57BL/6 mice, we compared the effects of unfractionated PA and its fractions (PAW1, PAW2, PAW3) on UC pathology and intestinal flora. Results Our results demonstrate that PA, PAW1, PAW2, and PAW3 ameliorated key UC-associated pathologic features; notably, the unfractionated PA exhibited superior efficacy compared to its individual fractions. PA treatment significantly mitigated DSS-induced body weight loss, disease activity index scores, and colon shortening. It preserved intestinal mucosal integrity, evidenced by increased goblet cell numbers and elevated expression of tight junction proteins (occludin-1, ZO-1). PA treatment reduced colonic inflammation by significantly downregulating pro-inflammatory mediators (NF-κB-p65, TLR4, MyD88, TNF-α, IL-17A, IFN-γ, MPO, iNOS) and upregulating the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, while IL-4 levels were also modulated. Furthermore, PA treatment attenuated intestinal dysbiosis in UC mice, characterized by an increase in beneficial bacteria (e.g., Psychrobacter Actinobacteriota Conclusion These findings collectively indicate that the aqueous extract of Periplaneta americana Periplaneta americana ulcerative colitis cytokine inflammatory response gut microbiota Innovative Research Group Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/100014718 82405020 Yunnan Provincial Department of Education 10.13039/501100007846 编号:2025J0819 The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

[Chengdu, China; Certificate No SCXK (Chuan) 2020-0030]. Mice were housed in an animal laboratory with a temperature and humidity of 22 °C ± 2 °C and 50% ± 5%, respectively, and a 12 h light/dark cycle ( Andersson et al., 2024 ad libitum 2.2 Materials and reagents PA (Lot. 20200521) was provided by Yunnan Jingxin Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Yunnan, China) and authenticated by Yang Zizhong. Olsalazine sodium capsules (Lot. 210206) were procured from Zhejiang Zhongyi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang, China). DSS (Lot. 1132-222) was obtained from Shenzhen Lijing Biochemistry Technology Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China). Anhydrous ethanol (Lot. 1703113601) and formic acid (FA, Lot. 20171122) were acquired from Fuchen Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China) and Tianjin Windship Chemical Reagent Technology Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China), respectively. Acetonitrile (ACN, HPLC grade, Lot. 204127) was sourced from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ, United States). A fecal occult blood test kit (Lot. 20230520) was purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute (Nanjing, China). Commercial ELISA kits for myeloperoxidase (MPO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-17A, IL-4, IL-10, and interferon-gamma (IFN- γ 2.3 Extraction and fractionation of PA components Dried PA powder (15 g) was extracted with ultrapure water (1:10, w/v) at 90 °C for 2 h. This extraction procedure was repeated twice. The combined aqueous extracts were filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to a final concentration of 1.0 g/mL (equivalent to crude extract). Subsequently, anhydrous ethanol was added to the concentrate and the mixture was stored at 4 °C for 24 h to facilitate precipitation. Following centrifugation (4,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), the supernatant (PAW) was collected. This supernatant was sequentially fractionated by ultrafiltration using membranes with nominal molecular weight cut-offs of 10,000 Da and 3,000 Da. The resulting fractions were collected as follows: PAW1, Filtrate < 3 kDa; PAW2, Retentate 3–10 kDa (filtrate from 10 kDa membrane retained by 3 kDa membrane); PAW3, Retentate > 10 kDa. The crude PAW and the three ultrafiltered fractions (PAW1, PAW2, PAW3) were lyophilized (Freeze-dried) and stored at −20 °C until further use. 2.4 Nano LC-MS/MS resolution of peptide sequences in PA The freeze-dried PA was redissolved in ultrapure water and filtered to obtain the PA test solution. The PA test solution was reduced with 10 mM of DL-dithiothreitol (DTT) at 56 °C for 1 h, followed by alkylation with 50 mM of iodoacetamide (IAA) for 40 min in the dark at room temperature to obtain the PA peptide substance. Before LC-MS/MS analysis, PA peptides were resuspended in 0.1% FA. The analysis was performed using an Ultimate 3000 System Nanoflow UPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) coupled to a Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap™ Mass Spectrometer with an ESI nanospray source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States), equipped with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ resin (150 μm × 15 cm, 1.9 μm, Dr. Maisch GmbH, Germany). Elution was performed using solvent A (2% CAN with 0.1% FA) and solvent B (80% CAN with 0.1% FA) at a 600 nL/min flow rate and an injection volume of 5 μL. The gradient elution procedure was as follows: B from 4% to 8%, 2 min; B from 8% to 28%, 43 min; B from 28% to 40%, 10 min; B from 40% to 95%, 1 min; and B from 95% to 95%, 10 min. Additionally, the samples were analyzed using a Q Exactive™ hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap™ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, United States) with a spray voltage of 2.2 KV and a capillary temperature of 270 °C ( Wang et al., 2023 The mass spectrometry parameters were configured to a mass resolution of 70,000 at 400 m/z, an automatic gain control target of 3e6, a maximum fill time of 40 ms, and a mass spectrometry precursor scanning range of 300.0–1,800.0 m/z. The 20 most intense peptide ions were scanned using MS/MS starting at 100 m/z with an isolation width of 3.00 and a normalized collision energy of 40.0. Raw MS files were analyzed using Byonic and searched in the target protein database according to the sample type ( Cadang et al., 2023 Carnevale Neto et al., 2022 2.5 LC-MS resolution of molecule compounds in PA The freeze-dried PA were dissolved in ultrapure water and filtered through a 0.22 μm microporous membrane. The target compounds were separated using an EXION LC System (SCIEX) ultra-high performance liquid chromatograph (Sciex, ExionLC AD) and passed through a Waters UPLC liquid chromatography column (ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3, 1.8 μm, 2.1 × 100 mm) at 400 μL/min ( Fu et al., 2024 You et al., 2024 Dong et al., 2023 2.6 Animal model establishment and treatment The mice were randomly divided into seven groups (n = 6 per group): control, UC model, Olsalazine (200 mg/kg), PA (100 mg/kg), PA_3KD (100 mg/kg), PA_3-10KD (100 mg/kg), and PA_10KD (100 mg/kg) group. The dosages administered were selected based on prior research findings and have been proven effective in the UC model ( Tao et al., 2020 Zhang et al., 2022 Liu et al., 2023 Zhao et al., 2024 Figure 1A FIGURE 1 Protective effect of PA on DSS-induced UC mice.

Panels D and E present bar graphs for spleen and thymus index. Panel F includes colon images from each group. Panel G has a bar graph of colon length. The results indicate differing impacts of treatments, with various statistical annotations. 2.7 Disease activity index scoring and sample collection Daily observations of body weight, fecal consistency, and rectal bleeding were recorded throughout the experiment. The DAI score was assigned to UC mice based on a composite of three scores: body weight loss (0, <1%; 1, 1%–5%; 2, 5%–10%; 3, 10%–20%; and 4, >20%), fecal consistency (0, normal feces; 1, well-formed pellets; 2, paste and semi-formed stools that do not adhere to the anus; 4, diarrhea, liquid stools that adhere to the anus), and rectal bleeding (0, bloodless; 1, red blood; 2, dark red blood; 4, rectal prolapse) ( Niu et al., 2013 Huang et al., 2024 2.8 Determination of colonic cytokines and MPO and INOS activities by ELISA The homogenized colon tissues were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were analyzed for TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17A, INF- γ 2.9 Histopathological analysis of the colon The colon of the end tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 4-μm-thick slices ( Nie et al., 2022 2.10 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis Samples were immersed in a sodium citrate buffer solution and heated in a microwave oven for antigenic repair. Subsequently, the sections were placed in a closed solution at room temperature for 30 min before being incubated with primary antibodies (NF-κB-p65, TLR4, MyD88, occludin-1, and ZO-1) at 4 °C overnight. All sections were treated with secondary antibodies, and the color was developed using an IHC kit (DAB). Positive DAB-stained regions were quantified using ImageJ software (version 1.48) according to the methodology reported for previous IHC analysis ( Zhao et al., 2024 2.11 Western blotting analysis Total proteins were extracted from murine colon tissues utilizing a tissue protein extraction kit (Lot. 061623231130, Beyotime, China). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Lot. B500, LABLEAD, China). The extracted protein samples were denatured by boiling in sample buffer at 100 °C for 10 min and subsequently resolved via electrophoresis on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Lot. ISEQ00010, Millipore, United States). Subsequently, the membranes were blocked with 5% milk for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies targeting NF-κB p65 (1:1,000, Lot 8242S, Cell Signaling Technology, United States), β-actin (1:20,000, Lot AC026, ABclonal, China), and Lamin-B (1:500, Lot WL01775, Wanleibio, China). Following incubation, the membranes underwent three washes with TBST, each lasting approximately 15 min. Thereafter, the membranes were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1,000, Lot AS014, ABclonal, China) at room temperature for 1 h. Protein expression was subsequently detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Advansta, United States), and imaging was conducted with an Azure 280 imaging system (Azure Biosystems, United States). Anti-β-actin served as an internal loading control. Analysis was carried out in ImageJ and signal intensities were normalized to loading controls, where applicable. 2.12 16S rRNA gene sequencing Fecal samples stored at −80 °C were removed from the refrigerator and thawed at 4 °C. Genomic DNA was extracted from feces using the aMG-Soil kit (Omega BioTek) according to the instructions of the manufacturers ( Wu et al., 2022b Li et al., 2023b ® http://greengenes.secondgenome.com/ post hoc post hoc P Douglas et al., 2020 2.13 Statistical analysis All data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 22.0). The normality of the data distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and the homogeneity of variances was verified using Levene’s test. For comparisons among multiple groups (e.g., Control, UC, PA, PAW1, PAW2, PAW3), a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied if the data met the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances, followed by Tukey’s post hoc post hoc P 3 Results 3.1 Analysis of the PA The active constituents of the unsegmented PA extracted from P. americana Supplementary Figure S1 Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Table S2 A total of 1,326 molecular compounds were identified by LC-MS, with detailed annotations provided in Supplementary Table S3 Supplementary Table S4 Supplementary Figure S2 3.2 PA attenuates symptoms of DSS-induced UC mice Compared with the control mice, the UC mice exhibited a significant reduction in body weight and an increase in DAI scores ( Figures 1B,C Figures 1D,E Figures 1F,G 3.3 PA attenuates DSS-induced colonic histopathological damage in UC mice H&E staining revealed the extent of colonic tissue damage and the potential protective role of PA components. In the control group, the structural integrity of the colonic tissues, including the mucosal, submucosal, and muscular layers of the mice, was intact. In contrast, mice in the UC group exhibited extensive crypt and goblet cell loss, significant inflammatory cell infiltration, and damage to the submucosal structures ( Figures 2A,B Figure 2D FIGURE 2 Effect of PA on pathological damage in the colon of UC mice.

Sections are marked for localized infiltration and integrity in submucosa and muscular layers. Graph D compares inflammatory cell and epithelial integrity scores, and graph E illustrates the relative area of positive cells, showing statistical significance across groups. AB-PAS staining, which targets mucopolysaccharides and goblet cells, was an essential morphological marker for evaluating intestinal function and structure ( Cheng et al., 2023a Figure 2C Figure 2E Immunohistochemical staining revealed significant insights into the barrier function of the colonic mucosa ( Figure 3 Subramaniam et al., 2016 Figures 3A–D FIGURE 3 Effect of PA on inflammatory signaling at the intestinal barrier in UC mice.

Panel F presents a bar graph of the Nuclear/Cytoplasmic NF-κB p65 ratio, highlighting significant differences. Scale bars represent fifty micrometers. To investigate whether the anti-inflammatory effects of PA are associated with the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway, the expression levels of NF-κB p65 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm were assessed. As illustrated in Figures 3E,F P Occludin-1 and ZO-1 were identified as key components of the tight junctions that constitute the mechanical barrier between intestinal epithelial cells. The mice in the UC group demonstrated significantly reduced occludin-1 and ZO-1 expression levels than those in the control group, indicating a breakdown of intestinal barrier integrity ( Figures 4A–C FIGURE 4 Effect of PA on intestinal barrier integrity in UC mice.

Each condition displays mean values with error bars and data points. In contrast to pro-inflammatory mediators, we found that post-treatment levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) were significantly higher in the mice in the UC model group than in those in the control group ( Figures 5G,H 3.5 Effects of PA on intestinal flora The utilization of 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine the effect of PA on intestinal microflora diversity and composition in a DSS-induced UC mouse model highlights the role of the gut microbiome in UC and the potential therapeutic effects of PA. These findings demonstrated that the sequencing effort was sufficient to capture a representative snapshot of microbial richness across the samples, as indicated by the plateauing of the rarefaction curves ( Figures 6A,B FIGURE 6 PA regulates the diversity of gut microbiota in UC mice.

The results were presented using branching plots and histograms to illustrate the distribution of LDA values ( Figures 7D,E Psychrobacter Limosilactobacillus unclassified Jeotgalicoccus, Dubosiella Desulfovibrionia Bifidobacterium Clostridium sensu stricto 1 3.6 Relevance analysis and functional prediction The above findings suggest that PA effectively reduces intestinal inflammation and modulates intestinal flora composition in UC mice. However, the potential impact of PA on the relationship or coherence between these two factors remains unclear. The effects of cytokines on gut microbiota composition were assessed using canonical correlation analysis (RDA/CCA), db-RDA, and Spearman correlation heatmaps ( Figures 8A–C γ Figure 8C Psychrobacter Psychrobacter Dubosiella, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, and Desulfovibrio Psychrobacter, Dubosiella, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia, and Desulfovibrio FIGURE 8 Correlation analysis and functional prediction of gut microbiota with inflammatory factors. (A) (B,C) (D) (E,F) Panel A shows a CCA plot at the genus level with arrows indicating specific biomarkers. Panel B displays a db-RDA plot at the OTU level with arrows for biomarkers. Panel C is a Spearman correlation heatmap showing associations between microbes and biomarkers. Panel D presents a bar chart for COG function classification, highlighting various functions. Panels E and F are heatmaps of pathway levels 2 and 3, showing different metabolic activities. Each graph includes a color-coded legend for groups such as control, UC, and PA treatments. The functions of microbial communities were predicted using PICRUSt2 software combined with EggNOG (evolutionary genealogy of genes: non-supervised orthologous groups) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) databases based on the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing results ( Figures 8D–F 4 Discussion  P. americana Peng et al., 2024 Zhao et al., 2017 DSS is a negatively charged sulfated polysaccharide that inhibits epithelial cell proliferation, disrupts the intestinal mucosal barrier, and induces the release of cytokines from nonspecific immune cells, which leads to colitis ( Zafarmand et al., 2022 Herein, 438 active peptides were identified, and 1,326 molecule compounds were extracted from the PA, including phenols, flavonoids, amino acids, and their derivatives, using Nano-UPLC-MS/MS and UPLC-MS analysis. Among them, phenols, flavonoids, amino acids and their derivatives exhibited the highest percentage of peak area, and these components collectively constitute the pharmacodynamic material basis of PA for the treatment of UC by enhancing the body’s ability to resist oxidative stress, promoting tissue repair, exerting anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects, and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells.  In vivo Jiang et al., 2021 Glover et al., 2022 Zheng et al., 2022 Yan et al., 2022 Parikh et al., 2019 Ke et al., 2023 Li et al., 2023c PA was demonstrated to effectively mitigate DSS-induced UC in mice by restoring gut microbiota dysbiosis, as determined through 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. This finding aligns with the recognized role of gut microbial imbalance in the pathogenesis of UC, which involves impairments in barrier function, immunomodulation, and metabolism. In the DSS-induced mouse model of UC, alterations in microbial composition and structure were observed. Analyses of alpha diversity, such as the increased Simpson’s index, and beta Diversity analyses (PCoA, NMDS) both indicated that PA administration enhanced microbial similarity and abundance across treatment groups. This resulted in a shift in the overall community structure towards that of the healthy control group. At the phylum level, PA demonstrated efficacy in reversing the dysbiosis characteristic of UC by reducing the aberrant enrichment of pro-inflammatory-associated phyla such as Desulfobacterota Actinobacteriota Verrucomicrobiota Proteobacteria Hu et al., 2023 Knox et al., 2019 Zhu et al., 2022 Desulfovibrionaceae Cao et al., 2024 Xiao et al., 2021 Erysipelotrichaceae Kaakoush, 2015 Akkermansiaceae Cheng et al., 2023a Subsequent LEfSe analysis identified UC-significant biomarkers, including Desulfovibrio Desulfovibrio + Ma et al., 2018 Psychrobacter Wang et al., 2024 5 Conclusion In this study, we demonstrated that PA significantly ameliorated the pathological processes associated with DSS-induced UC. This was evidenced by the effective alleviation of core symptoms such as weight loss, shortened colon swelling, and the presence of blood in the stool. Furthermore, PA facilitated the reconstruction of the intestinal mucosal barrier function by restoring the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors, inhibiting the inflammatory mediators TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB-p65, and enhancing the expression of tight junction proteins, including occludin-1 and ZO-1. Finally, PA reversed the enrichment of pathogenic bacteria by remodeling the intestinal flora, specifically Desulfovibrio Akkermansiaceae Periplaneta americana 6 Limitations of the study Our study is subject to three notable limitations. Firstly, while we observed a significant downregulation of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB p65 expression following PA treatment, the causal necessity of this signaling pathway was not functionally validated by knockout models or drug inhibition experiments. This limitation precludes us from definitively asserting whether the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway is essential for the efficacy of PA. Secondly, although it was demonstrated that PA induces the restoration of microbial diversity and inhibits pathogenic genera such as Desulfovibrio Dubosiella These limitations stem primarily from experimental time and resource allocation constraints. However, it is now established that intestinal immunotherapy will be a specific direction for future research, and future work will perform humanized fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), whereby the microbiota of PA-treated mice is transplanted into a model of aseptic colitis, followed by polyomics integration to identify the key species that mediate therapeutic effects. Simultaneously, conducting detailed chemical characterization of the components in each molecular weight fraction of PA to clarify their pharmacological basis.
