To date very little is known about loneliness in Parkinson's disease (PD) and focal/segmental craniocervical dystonia (FSCD). Objectives To explore whether level of loneliness is disease‐specific by comparing PD, FCSD and healthy controls (HCs), and to define predictors of loneliness in both PD and FSCD. Methods Eighty‐two people with PD, 63 people with FSCD and 50 HC were surveyed. The UCLA Loneliness Scale was used to assess loneliness. Various non‐motor symptoms, psychosocial variables and measures of subjective well‐being were assessed and used as potential predictors of loneliness. Results There was no significant difference in reported levels of loneliness between people with PD and matched HCs, and between people with PD and people with FSCD, but people with FSCD reported higher levels of loneliness than HCs ( p p p p p p p p p Conclusions We identified important predictors of loneliness in PD and FSCD. The identified age‐ and gender‐specific differences in loneliness in people with PD and FSCD contribute to our better understanding of this complex and not yet fully understood concept. loneliness Parkinson's disease focal/segmental craniocervical dystonia optimism and stigma the Slovenian Research and Innovation Agency (ARIS) P2‐0209 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:30.09.2025 Loneliness is a state in which an individual feels socially isolated  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  4  5  9  10 When loneliness is not addressed it can have serious consequences on the individual's cognition, emotions, behavior and health.  11  12  13  14  15 Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disabling, neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by primary symptoms of tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity  16  17  18  19  20  21  20  22  23  24  23 When socializing, people with PD can struggle due to their motor and non‐motor symptoms and dyskinesias, that may make them feel that they fail to meet social norms; which may in turn influence their self‐esteem, and increase their perceived stigma and in the longer term affect their ability to sustain relationships with family, friends and colleagues leaving them feeling isolated and lonely.  25  26  27  28  28  29  29 While it is important to understand if people with PD are more prone to loneliness compared to HCs it can also be useful to compare loneliness levels to those of people with another movement disorder. Dystonia refers to a group of heterogenous, movement disorders characterized by muscle spasms, uncontrollable repetitive movements, and contorted postures  30  31  32  33  34  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  40 The main aim of our study was to investigate the potential impact of motor and non‐motor symptoms of PD and FSCD on loneliness compared to healthy controls and the mediating role of apathy, depression, hope, happiness, perceived stigma, self‐esteem and personality. We hypothesized that both patients with PD and FSCD would be lonelier compared to healthy controls. We examined the potential contributions of anxiety, depression, apathy, perceived stigma, extroversion, subjective well‐being, resilience, hope, self‐esteem and social support as predictors of loneliness in PD and FSCD. The secondary aim of the study was to investigate the effects of age, gender and perceived stigma on loneliness in PD and FSCD. We hypothesized that older patients, male patients and patients with higher perceived stigma would feel lonelier. Methods Participants Eighty‐two (150 initially contacted, 98 responded–65% response rate) people with PD, 63 (98 initially contacted, 66 responded–67% response rate) people with idiopathic FSCD and 50 (77 initially contacted, 50 responded–65% response rate) HCs were recruited from the patient lists of 3 collaborating consultant neurologists (PL, KB, and PJ) at the National Hospital of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London. All patients had been diagnosed as having idiopathic PD according to the criteria of the UK Brain Bank  41  30 The sample size required to conduct the study was estimated based on a significance level of 0.05, a power of 0.80 and a medium‐high effect size based on previous research.  37 Measures The questionnaire pack consisted of a cover sheet which required participants to divulge demographic and clinical information on age, gender, and disease duration.

Both, PD, p p Discussion The main findings of the study were that loneliness was significantly higher in people with FSCD compared to HCs, but there was no difference in loneliness between PD and FSCD and PD and HCs. While perceived stigma significantly predicted loneliness in both PD and FSCD, non‐motor symptoms, lack of optimism and practical support additionally predicted loneliness in PD. Furthermore, patients with PD and FSCD with higher experience of perceived stigma were lonelier than those with lower levels of perceived stigma. Female and older patients with PD and younger patients with dystonia reported greater loneliness. In the past couple of decades much has been published about the loneliness epidemic sweeping the modern Western world.  56  57  58  21  28  33  34  59  60  61  62  63  61  63 Looking at the predictors of loneliness; while perceived stigma predicted loneliness in both FSCD and PD, the non‐motor symptoms, and lack of practical support and absence of optimism predicted loneliness in people with PD. Perceived stigma is a devaluating, discriminant, and discomforting feeling caused by the negative perception of self and by others when the stigmatized person is perceived as different from the “norm.”  64  65  65  66  65  67  68  32  69  64  70  71  72 It has been suggested that sometimes the impact of non‐motor symptoms, which were found to significantly predict loneliness in PD, is worse than the impact of motor symptoms.  73 Whereas the results show that perceived stigma and non‐motor symptoms have a negative impact on social connectedness, optimism and practical support both have more protective qualities, therefore it was not surprising that lack of optimism predicted loneliness in PD. Optimism is a personality dimension defined by the expectation of positive outcomes, life engagement, and a future orientation.  74  75  76 The SSSQ  37  77 Further research could explore the effects of duration of disease as well as the neurodegenerative nature of PD versus the more static nature of FSCD. We did not assess the non‐motor symptoms of people with FSCD, which is one of the limitations of this study along with the small sample size, which could also be considered for any future research. Comparing other neurological disease groups such as essential tremor or multiple sclerosis, as comparative groups, could also shed light on more disease‐specific features which contribute to loneliness. There are several limitations of the study. We collected the data by sending the questionnaires and scales to the patients by post. Therefore, we were not able to consider the objective motor status of the patients who participated in the study and used only the self‐reported stage of illness, which was nevertheless shown to correctly reflect the motor stage of PD.  43 In conclusion, our study supports the notion that people with CND are lonelier than HCs. We found higher levels of loneliness in FSCD patients compared to HC. Perceived stigma was a significant predictor of loneliness in both, PD and FSCD patients. In addition, patients that felt more stigmatized also felt lonelier. Non‐motor symptoms, lack of optimism and practical support predicted loneliness in PD. Female patients with PD felt lonelier than male patients. In addition, older patients with PD and younger patients with FSCDS were lonelier. Further research is needed to understand the underlying intricacies of what contributes to loneliness in PD and FSCD as well as other movement disorders. Author Roles (1) Research project: A.
