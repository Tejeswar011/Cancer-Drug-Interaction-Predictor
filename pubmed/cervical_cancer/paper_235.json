We identified important associations between these biomarkers and ORR, PFS, and OS among participants receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy; these results may inform the design of future studies evaluating pembrolizumab treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC. In the exploratory analysis of TIL expression and clinical outcomes, TIL ≥ 5% was significantly associated with better ORR, PFS, and OS with pembrolizumab monotherapy but not with single-agent chemotherapy. As with CPS, efficacy estimates at the median TIL cutpoint (≥ 5%) suggest that a subset of patients with metastatic TNBC necessitating later-line therapy can derive prolonged survival benefit from pembrolizumab over chemotherapy. Although TIL expression and CPS were moderately correlated, they were independently predictive of clinical outcomes. Understanding which patients with later-line metastatic TNBC would benefit from pembrolizumab would need to be tested in a prospective study; however, TIL expression represents a pragmatic and globally accessible technique that seems to evaluate patients for a pre-existing immune response.

To our knowledge, 2 other studies have evaluated the association between BRCAm/HRD status and clinical outcomes in advanced solid tumors treated with pembrolizumab. In the phase 2 TOPACIO study of niraparib plus pembrolizumab in women with advanced or metastatic TNBC, the ORR was 47% for participants with BRCAm tumors and 11% for those without confirmed tumor BRCAm 15 16 In the exploratory analysis of TMB and clinical outcomes, there was a trend toward a positive association between TMB and clinical response with pembrolizumab but not with chemotherapy. Although the association between TMB and ORR was not statistically significant, those with PFS and OS were. Notably, OS was longer for participants with TMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb with a clear and consistent separation of Kaplan-Meier curves for OS, and a similar trend was also observed in participants with TMB < 10 mut/Mb, albeit less pronounced. However, it must be noted that there were relatively few participants with TMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb (10.2%), which may have limited the ability to assess the predictive value of TMB in this setting. Our findings are broadly consistent with those from the KEYNOTE-158 study, in which TMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb was associated with response to pembrolizumab among participants with advanced solid tumors (none of whom had breast cancer) 8 Other studies have evaluated biomarkers for immunotherapy in patients with TNBC and provide important context for our findings. The phase 3 IMpassion130 study showed a clinical benefit with atezolizumab (an anti–PD-L1 antibody) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in patients with locally advanced or metastatic TNBC with PD-L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (PD-L1 IC+) but not in the intent-to-treat population (ie, irrespective of PD-L1 IC status) 17 18 19 20 21 22 A range of novel biomarkers are currently being evaluated for their potential to predict response to immunotherapy in patients with breast cancer. Emerging evidence has suggested there may be associations between efficacy outcomes and potential biomarkers, including gene-signature scores for T helper 1 cells, B cells, and neutrophils 21 23 A key strength of the current findings is that they are based on data from a randomized, phase 3 trial. The presence of a comparator group allowed us to demonstrate that the association between TILs and Tcell inf inf 24 In summary, Tcell inf Methods Eligibility criteria Full eligibility criteria and study design have been published previously 2 The study was done in accordance with the principles set forth in the Declaration of Helsinki and with the International Council on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines. An independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each site (listed in the Supplementary Materials NCT02555657 Study treatment Briefly, participants were randomized 1:1 to receive pembrolizumab or chemotherapy. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 status (CPS ≥ 1 vs CPS < 1) and by prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment versus de novo metastatic TNBC. Participants randomized to the pembrolizumab group received pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 35 cycles or until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or investigator decision. Participants randomized to the chemotherapy group received the investigator’s choice of capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine per local guidelines until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or investigator decision. Participants in the chemotherapy group who had documented disease progression were not permitted to cross over to receive pembrolizumab. Assessments The presence of TILs in tumor samples was assessed by light microscopy of hematoxylin and eosin‒stained sections using a predefined method 25 26 ® 27 29 ® 8 BRCAm/HRD status was categorized into 3 groups: BRCAm, BRCA BRCA Tumor imaging was performed using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging at baseline, every 9 weeks for 1 year, and every 12 weeks thereafter until participants had radiologic evidence of disease progression, started a new anticancer treatment, or withdrew consent, or until the end of the study. Tumor response was assessed by a central imaging vendor per RECIST version 1.1. Statistical analyses The study’s primary endpoint was OS (defined as time from randomization to death from any cause). ORR and PFS (time from randomization to disease progression or death) were secondary endpoints. Evaluation of the relationships between potential biomarkers and antitumor activity of pembrolizumab was an exploratory endpoint. Biomarker analyses were performed in the all-patients-as-treated population (ie, those who received ≥ 1 dose of study medication analyzed according to treatment received). This exploratory analysis assessed the associations of TILs, Tcell inf inf Relative prognostic and predictive effects of the biomarkers were assessed in subgroups defined as follows: above or below the median TIL score; Tcell inf low inf non-low BRCA BRCA inf inf 30 31 The 95% CIs for ORRs were estimated using the Clopper and Pearson method 32 P inf inf Supplementary information  Supplementary Materials Publisher’s note Supplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41523-025-00814-y.
