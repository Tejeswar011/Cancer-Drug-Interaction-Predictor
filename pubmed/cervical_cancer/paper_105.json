M2 macrophages serve crucial roles in the tumor microenvironment (TME), contributing to tumor progression, immune evasion and resistance to therapy. However, the prognostic importance of M2 macrophage-related genes in LIHC and their potential for predicting responses to immunotherapy remain underexplored. A bioinformatics analysis was performed using The Cancer Genome Atlas data to identify M2 macrophage-related genes in LIHC. Differential expression and weighted gene co-expression network analysis were used to identify key gene modules and a prognostic model was developed and validated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves. The immune therapy response was assessed using tracking of indels by decomposition and Submap analyses. Killer cell lectin like receptor B1 (KLRB1) was knocked down in HuH-7 cells and overexpressed in HuH-1 cells to evaluate its effect on tumor cells and macrophage regulation. The effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cell tube formation was also assessed. A total of two M2 macrophage-related genes (KLRB1 and phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase type 2α) were identified as notable prognostic biomarkers for LIHC. The prognostic model demonstrated certain predictive power, with high-risk patients exhibiting markedly worse overall survival. This model was validated in external datasets and associated with immune infiltration patterns. Furthermore, low-risk patients were more likely to respond to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The inhibition of KLRB1 enhanced LIHC cell activity and increased macrophage polarization from the M0 phenotype to the M2 phenotype by regulating LIHC cell secretions. In conclusion, M2 macrophage-related genes are valuable prognostic biomarkers in LIHC. The prognostic model effectively stratifies patients by survival risk and predicts immunotherapy responses, thereby highlighting the potential for improved TME-targeted therapies in LIHC. The mechanism of KLRB1 regulation in LIHC-macrophage interactions and its impact on LIHC activities were also evaluated. liver hepatocellular carcinoma M2 macrophages prognostic risk model bioinformatics analysis immunotherapy prediction tumor immune microenvironment Evaluation of the Efficacy of Liver-Coursing Spleen-Rectifying Decoction in Treating Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and its Effects on Intestinal Flora and Serum LPS of Patients S202406060003 The present work was supported by the Evaluation of the Efficacy of Liver-Coursing Spleen-Rectifying Decoction in Treating Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and its Effects on Intestinal Flora and Serum LPS of Patients (grant no.

Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, key genes associated with M2 macrophage infiltration were identified using the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) algorithm. A risk model was constructed based on these genes and validated using survival analysis. Additionally, the potential of these genes as therapeutic targets was examined by assessing their relationships with immune checkpoint expression and responses to immunotherapy. The findings offer valuable insights into the role of M2 macrophages in LIHC and identify potential biomarkers for prognosis and immunotherapy strategies. Materials and methods Data collection and preprocessing The primary dataset used for data analysis included the LIHC cohort from the TCGA database, which included gene expression profiles and clinical data for patients with LIHC. The raw RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data were processed and normalized to the transcripts per million format to standardize the gene expression levels across all samples. In addition, samples with a reported survival time of 0 days were excluded from the analysis to ensure the integrity and reliability of the survival data. To validate the prognostic model, two independent external validation datasets were used. The first dataset ( GSE76427 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ https://dcc.icgc.org/ Evaluation of macrophage immune infiltration in LIHC To assess macrophage immune infiltration in LIHC and normal tissue samples, six widely used immune infiltration estimation methods were applied: CIBERSORT ( 16 17 18 19 20 21 Network construction, module preservation and correlation analysis WGCNA was employed to identify gene modules associated with M2 macrophages ( 22 Prognostic gene selection and M2 macrophages-related model development Univariate Cox regression analysis was performed on 292 genes to identify those associated with prognosis in LIHC. Genes with P-values <0.05 were selected for further investigation. To refine this selection, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression was performed with 10-fold cross-validation to identify the optimal regularization parameter (λ). A λ-value that optimized the model fit while minimizing overfitting was chosen. Multivariate Cox regression was subsequently performed to evaluate the independent prognostic value of the selected genes. A prognostic risk score model was developed based on the expression levels of these genes, which were weighted by their respective regression coefficients. The risk score formula was calculated by multiplying the expression level of each gene by its corresponding coefficient. To assess the model's predictive accuracy, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate overall survival (OS) and model performance in both the training cohort ( GSE76427 Functional enrichment analysis To examine the differential activation of biological pathways between the two risk groups, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was performed on the hallmark gene sets ( 23 24 Immune infiltration, tumor mutational burden (TMB) and immune checkpoint analysis To assess the relationships between immune characteristics and risk stratification, the ESTIMATE algorithm (ESTIMATE: Home) was first applied to quantify the scores for each patient with LIHC. Pearson correlation analyses were subsequently performed to examine the associations between these scores and the prognostic risk score. The TMB was also evaluated for each patient and a correlation analysis was performed with the risk score to determine whether the TMB was associated with the risk profile. To further explore immune responses, we employed the ‘limma’ package of R studio to conduct differential expression analysis was performed on common inhibitory and stimulatory immune checkpoint genes with the threshold of |log2 fold change|>1.5 and P<0.05. The expression of these genes was compared between the two risk groups to investigate their potential roles in immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. Additionally, the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) algorithm was employed to assess the immune escape potential in both risk groups ( 25 26 Single-cell (sc)RNA-seq based on the tumor immune single cell Hub 2 (TISCH2) database The killer cell lectin like receptor B1 (KLRB1), with the smallest P-value in the multivariate Cox regression, was analyzed across multiple single-cell datasets to investigate its role in the TME. Using the TISCH2 database ( 27 http://tisch.compbio.cn/home/ + + + Pan-cancer expression and prognostic analysis of KLRB1 To investigate the potential role of KLRB1 in cancer biology, a pan-cancer analysis was performed using data from TCGA. First, KLRB1 expression across various cancer types (including LIHC) was assessed to identify significant differences in expression. The prognostic value of KLRB1 was subsequently examined by analyzing its expression in relation to clinical outcomes, including the disease-free interval (DFI), disease-specific survival (DSS), OS and platinum-free interval (PFI) parameters across various cancer types. A forest plot analysis was performed to further investigate the relationship between KLRB1 expression and OS across various cancers. Finally, the samples were categorized into high- and low-KLRB1 groups and differential expression analysis was performed. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was subsequently used to identify enriched biological pathways in the high- and low-expression groups, thus providing insights into the potential mechanisms through which KLRB1 influences tumor progression. Cell culture The HuH-1 (CL-0811), HuH-7 (CL-0120), and THP-1 (CL-0233) cell lines were purchased from Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd. The HuH-1 and HuH-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from GIBCO; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from GIBCO; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with a 5% CO 2 Construction of KLRB1 knockdown and overexpression cell lines A lentivirus-based short hairpin RNA (shRNA) strategy was employed using three distinct shRNA sequences to downregulate KLRB1 expression in HuH-7 cells. These shRNA sequences were cloned into the lentiviral vector pLKO.1. Simultaneously, full-length KLRB1 complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized by PCR using total RNA extracted from HuH-1 cells and cloned into the lentiviral overexpression vector pLV-CMV-MCS-PGK-Puro to induce KLRB1 overexpression in HuH-1 cells. Both vectors were obtained from Addgene (Beijing Zhongyuan Co.). For lentivirus production, 10 µg of pLV-CMV-MCS-PGK-Puro was co-transfected with 7.5 µg of packaging plasmid (pMDLg/pRRE; Addgene; Beijing Zhongyuan Co.), 2.5 µg of envelope plasmid (VSV-G; Addgene; Beijing Zhongyuan Co.) and 15 µg of a helper plasmid (pRSV-Rev; Addgene; Beijing Zhongyuan Co.) using the calcium phosphate transfection method as part of a 3rd generation lentiviral system. Transfection was performed at 37°C for 48 h. Lentiviral particles were generated by co-transfecting 293T cells (Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) with a packaging plasmid mix (REV: VSVG: PMDL=2:3:5) using TurboFect transfection reagent (cat. no. R0532; Fermentas; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), with virus supernatant harvested 36–48 h post-transfection and filtered for use in infection. HuH-7 and HuH-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates until reaching 60–70% confluency before infection with lentiviral particles at a multiplicity of infection of 10, supplemented with poly-L-lysine (8 µg/ml) to enhance transduction. Following 12–16 h of co-culture with the virus, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium. After 48 h, stable transductants were selected using 2 µg/ml puromycin (the original concentration was 1 mg/ml) to confirm successful transduction. All procedures were conducted at 37°C with 5% CO 2 Table SI RNA extraction and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) According to the manufacturer's protocol, total RNA was extracted from tissue samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Subsequently, a cDNA synthesis kit (cat. no. R212-01; Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd.) was used to convert the RNA into cDNA. The qPCR experiments were conducted using SYBR Green qRT-PCR Master Mix (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd.), with GAPDH serving as the internal control for normalization and the 2 −ΔΔCq 28 Table SII Cell proliferation assay Cell proliferation was assessed using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Beijing Solarbio Science & Technology Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A total of 2,500 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and cultured for 3 days. A total of 10 µl of CCK-8 solution was added to each well for 1 h before measurement of the absorbance at 450 nm at room temperature. Transwell migration assay A Transwell chamber (pore size, 8 µm; Corning, Inc.) was used to assess the migratory ability of the cells. Target cells (typically 1×10 5 2 Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining assay To assess cell apoptosis, the Annexin V-FITC/PI (BioLegend, Inc.) dual-staining method was used. First, sh-KLRB1-2 and OE-KLRB1 cells were seeded into culture dishes and cultured until they reached 70–80% confluence. After treatment, the cells were collected and washed twice with PBS to remove residual culture medium. The cells were then resuspended in 1× binding buffer and stained with annexin V-FITC and PI solution. The mixture was gently vortexed and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 15 min. Annexin V-FITC binds to phosphatidylserine exposed on the surface of the cell membrane, thereby marking early apoptotic cells, whereas PI stains the nuclei of late apoptotic or necrotic cells with compromised membrane integrity. After staining, apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSAria III; BD Biosciences) and evaluation using FlowJo (version 10.8.1). The dual fluorescence signals from annexin V-FITC and PI allowed for the distinction between healthy cells, early apoptotic cells, late apoptotic cells and necrotic cells, thereby providing a comprehensive assessment of the apoptotic status of the cells. Cell tube formation assay Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (PUMC-HUVEC-T1; cat. no. CL-0675) were obtained from Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd. The third to the fifth passage of HUVECs in the logarithmic growth phase were used for the subsequent experiments. The cell tube formation assay involved seeding HUVECs onto a solidified layer of Matrigel ® qPCR detection of macrophage cell polarization To evaluate the polarization status of M0 cells, the expression levels of polarization marker genes were assessed using qPCR. The THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from GIBCO; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). Cultures were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with a 5% CO 2 −ΔΔCq 28 Table SII Western blot analysis The total protein of cells was obtained using radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer for 30 sec (cat. no. P0013B; Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). The total protein was separated using 10% SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (GE Healthcare). Following a 2-h blocking step at room temperature with 5% non-fat dry milk (Yili), the membranes were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4°C. The primary antibodies were as follows: Bax (1:500 dilution; cat. no. A12009), Bcl-2 (1:1,000 dilution; cat. no. A19693), C-caspase-3 (1:500 dilution; cat. no. A11319) and β-actin (1:10,000 dilution; cat. no. AC038; all from ABclonal Biotech Co., Ltd.). Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; cat. no. AB_1185567; goat anti-rabbit IgG; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology) and analyzed densitometrically using ImageJ software (version 1.8.0_345). Statistical analysis All bioinformatics analyses in the present study were performed using R Studio version 4.3.1 ( https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/old/4.3.1/ Results Differential expression of M2 macrophages in patients with LIHC and normal controls Macrophage infiltration levels in LIHC and normal tissue samples were evaluated using six immune infiltration analysis methods. The heatmap shown in Fig. 1A Fig. 1B Identification of M2 macrophage-related gene modules The optimal soft threshold for constructing the gene co-expression network was determined to be 14, which yielded a scale-free topology model fit value approaching 0.9 ( Fig. 2A Fig. 2B Fig. 2C Fig. 2D Development and validation of the M2 macrophage-related genes prognostic model Univariate Cox regression analysis identified 14 genes with significant associations with patient prognosis (P<0.05) in the LIHC cohort ( Fig. 3A Fig. 3B Fig. 3C Fig. 3D GSE76427 Fig. 3E Differential pathway and functional enrichment between the two risk groups GSVA of the hallmark gene sets revealed distinct differences in pathway activation between the two risk groups. The high-risk group exhibited upregulation of pathways associated with coagulation, allograft rejection and myogenesis, thus suggesting an active inflammatory and tissue remodeling environment. By contrast, the low-risk group exhibited increased activity in pathways involved in cell cycle regulation, including ‘E2F_TARGETS’, ‘G2M_CHECKPOINT’ and ‘MITOTIC_SPINDLE’, thereby indicating increased cell proliferation and division ( Fig. 4A Fig. 4B Fig. 4C Fig. 4D Immunotherapy prediction analysis based on the TIDE and Submap algorithms A strong negative correlation was observed between the risk score and all three ESTIMATE scores (immune, stromal and overall ESTIMATE scores), thereby indicating that higher scores were associated with lower levels of immune and stromal cell infiltration ( Fig. 5A Fig. 5B Fig. 5C Fig. 5D Fig. 5E Fig. 5F Expression and ligand-receptor interactions of KLRB1 in single-cell datasets To understand the role of KLRB1 in immune cell populations, its expression was analyzed in six distinct single-cell datasets from the TISCH2 database. KLRB1 was observed to be predominantly expressed in CD8 + + Fig. 6A + Fig. 6B + + Fig. 6C Expression and prognostic importance of KLRB1 KLRB1 expression was first assessed in multiple cancer types using TCGA pan-cancer data. KLRB1 was observed to be significantly differentially expressed in a majority of cancer types, including LIHC, thereby highlighting its relevance in tumor biology ( Fig. 7A Fig. 7B Fig. 7C Fig. 7D Regulation of tumors by KLRB1 and its associated secretory factors on macrophage polarization qPCR was used to assess the mRNA levels of KLRB1 in HuH-7 and HuH-1 cells. The results revealed that KLRB1 expression was higher in HuH-7 cells compared with HuH-1 cells ( Fig. 8A Fig. 8B Fig. 8C Fig. 8D and E Fig. 8F Fig. S1 Fig. 8G To investigate how KLRB1 affects the secretion of tumor cell-derived factors involved in macrophage polarization, culture supernatants were collected from KLRB1-knockdown and KLRB1-overexpressing cells and incubated with THP-1 cell-derived M0 macrophages. The polarization status of M1 and M2 macrophages was then assessed using qPCR. The results demonstrated that KLRB1 knockdown culture supernatant increased the expression of M2 markers CD206 and IL-10, whereas KLRB1-overexpressing cell culture supernatant reduced the expression of CD206 and IL-10. By contrast, the M1 markers CD86 and IL-12 were downregulated following KLRB1 knockdown culture supernatant treatment and upregulated after overexpression supernatant treatment ( Fig. 8H Discussion LIHC is one of the most prevalent and fatal malignancies worldwide, with a poor prognosis being observed, primarily due to late-stage diagnoses, high recurrence rates and resistance to conventional treatments ( 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 In the present study, M2 macrophage-related genes that serve significant roles in the prognosis of LIHC were identified. Using bioinformatics analyses, a prognostic risk model was constructed based on these genes, which demonstrated promising predictive power in both the training and external validation datasets. These findings reinforce the growing body of evidence suggesting that M2 macrophages are key players in the TME of LIHC and contribute to tumor progression ( 9 36 Although increased infiltration of M2 macrophages has been associated with poor prognoses in various cancers, the present study did not identify direct correlations between M2 macrophage infiltration and various clinical outcomes (such as OS or progression-free survival) in patients with LIHC. This discrepancy may be due to the complex nature of the liver TME, where multiple factors, including hepatic fibrosis, viral infections and cirrhosis, contribute to disease progression beyond macrophage infiltration. Therefore, although M2 macrophage-related genes demonstrate potential as biomarkers for predicting disease progression, additional studies are necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms through which M2 macrophages influence the clinical course of LIHC. Notably, the present study suggests that M2 macrophages may influence the efficacy of immunotherapies in LIHC. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated promising results in various cancers, their effectiveness in LIHC is often hindered by the immunosuppressive TME, which is partly shaped by M2 macrophages ( 37 Although M2 macrophages serve a critical role in the TME and have been associated with poor prognoses in various cancers, the present study identified KLRB1 as an important factor in LIHC. KLRB1 is primarily expressed on NK cells and certain T-cell subsets and has been implicated in immune regulation and tumor immune surveillance ( 38 KLRB1 serves a crucial role in tumor regulation, with previous studies involving LIHC and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) highlighting its complex dual function. The expression levels and functions of KLRB1 vary markedly across different tumor types. For instance, in breast cancer and LUAD, low expression of KLRB1 is typically associated with poor prognosis, and its functions involve immune regulation, cell proliferation and migration ( 39 Despite the promising results associated with the M2 macrophage-related prognostic signature, several limitations must be acknowledged in the current study. Firstly, the research primarily relied on data retrieved from public databases, which often contain relatively small sample sizes and may not be promptly updated. In addition, the focal point of the investigation involved M2 macrophage-related genes; however, the specific molecular mechanisms by which these genes regulate the progression of LIHC necessitate further in-depth explorations. Consequently, the interpretation of the results presented requires additional validation and enhancement. Furthermore, the prognostic signature was predominantly verified using public datasets, which may harbor intrinsic biases and do not provide clinical validation within independent, real-world patient cohorts. Secondly, although analyses of immune-cell infiltration and predictions regarding immunotherapy offer valuable insights, the exact mechanisms linking M2 macrophage-related genes to immune responses in LIHC remain inadequately understood and warrant additional experimental investigations. Furthermore, the present study suggested that KLRB1 may serve a role in modulating immune responses and facilitating the progression of LIHC. A thorough review of the literature regarding KLRB1 indicates that this gene represents a novel therapeutic target; however, the molecular mechanisms through which KLRB1 regulates LIHC remain largely unexplored and should be further investigated. Additionally, the present research did not evaluate potential interactions between other key genes and molecular pathways that could influence the progression of LIHC, thereby highlighting the need for further explorations in this area. Finally, although the prognostic signature demonstrates promise in guiding immunotherapy strategies, its clinical applicability is constrained by the absence of prospective clinical trials to validate its predictive power. Future studies should focus on validating the prognostic signature within larger, more diverse patient populations and elucidating the mechanistic roles of M2 macrophages in the context of LIHC.
