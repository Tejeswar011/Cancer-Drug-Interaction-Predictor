Methods A retrospective study of 124 elderly ESCC patients treated between 2021 and 2024. Patients were divided into immunotherapy and non-immunotherapy groups. Progression-free survival (PFS) was compared, and inflammatory markers were analyzed using Cox regression and ROC curves. Results Median PFS was significantly longer in the ICI group (13.7 vs. 10.9 months, P = 0.043). Immunotherapy was an independent protective factor for PFS. Post-treatment NLR and PNI were predictive of outcomes in the ICI group. Conclusion Combining ICIs with chemoradiotherapy improves survival in elderly inoperable ESCC patients. NLR and PNI may serve as accessible biomarkers to guide immunotherapy. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of combining immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with chemo-radiotherapy in elderly patients with inoperable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). It also assessed whether certain inflammatory markers could help predict the outcome of the treatment. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS ICI combined with chemo-radiotherapy improved survival in elderly patients with inoperable ESCC. Immunotherapy was an independent protective factor for progression-free survival. Post-treatment NLR and PNI predicted outcomes in patients receiving immunotherapy. Peripheral inflammatory markers may help guide personalized immunotherapy strategies.

Introduction Esophageal cancer ranks among the most lethal malignancies globally, with a disproportionately high burden in Asia. Epidemiological data reveal 510,700 new cases and 445,100 deaths worldwide in 2022, placing it within the top ten malignancies for both incidence and mortality [ 1 1 2 Over 70% of ESCC patients are elderly (≥60 years), with 64.4% diagnosed at advanced stages (III–IV) [ 3 4 5–7 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 have revolutionized ESCC management, demonstrating median OS of 15–31 months and 3-year survival >25% in phase II/III trials [ 8 9 Inflammatory markers including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI)—reflect immune-nutritional status and predict outcomes in gastrointestinal cancers [ 10–13 This study evaluates the efficacy of ICI-combined therapy in elderly inoperable ESCC patients and investigates dynamic changes in peripheral inflammatory markers to establish a predictive model for personalized treatment. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study population We retrospectively analyzed 124 ESCC patients (≥60 years) diagnosed at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (January 2021–July 2024). Ethical approval was obtained from the hospital’s Institutional Review Board (YX2024-223), adhering to the Declaration of Helsinki. Inclusion criteria included pathologically confirmed diagnosis of ESCC, evaluable lesions via imaging, no prior history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, and a life expectancy of at least 3 months. Exclusion criteria included non-squamous histology, recurrent or secondary esophageal cancer, and severe comorbidities such as cardiovascular or autoimmune diseases. 2.2. Data collection Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected, including baseline information on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking and alcohol history, tumor location and staging (AJCC 8th edition), comorbidities, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score, and lymph node metastasis. Inflammatory markers, such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), platelet-immune ratio (PIV), and prognostic nutritional index (PNI), were calculated from pre- and post-treatment (after 2 cycles) blood counts. 2.3. Treatment and efficacy evaluation Treatment regimens were individualized according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) guidelines. Radiotherapy was administered using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with doses ranging from 40 to 60 Gy, delivered in 1.8–2 Gy fractions, 5 fractions per week. Chemotherapy was given to 91 patients, with regimens including albumin-bound paclitaxel + platinum (n = 41), fluorouracil + platinum (n = 16), and others (n = 34). Immunotherapy was administered to 63 patients with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (e.g. pembrolizumab, camrelizumab, sintilimab) combined with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Treatment response was evaluated using the RECIST 1.1 criteria, and special attention was given to pseudoprogression in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor. 2.4. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS 27.0. The ROC curves were used to determine the optimal cutoff values for inflammatory markers. Specifically, the test variable (X) represents the value or ratio of peripheral blood inflammatory markers at a defined time point, while the state variable (Y) indicates a binary event reflecting whether the survival time of a given sample exceeds the median survival time of the corresponding treatment group. Survival differences were evaluated via Kaplan-Meier/log-rank tests. Cox regression identified independent prognostic factors. A P-value <0.05 indicated statistical significance. 3. Results 3.1. Demographic and clinical characteristics This study included 124 treatment-naive, locally advanced inoperable ESCC patients (≥60 years, pathologically confirmed) from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University. All patients received radiotherapy as first-line treatment. The male-to-female ratio was 3.3:1. Immunotherapy regimens included pembrolizumab (n = 2), camrelizumab (n = 28), toripalimab (n = 3), sintilimab (n = 28), tislelizumab (n = 1), and envafolimab (n = 1). Baseline characteristics (age, sex, BMI, smoking/alcohol history, tumor location, stage, KPS score) showed no significant differences between immunotherapy (n = 63) and non-immunotherapy (n = 61) groups (P > 0.05, Table 1 Table 1.

Predictive value of peripheral inflammatory markers In the immunotherapy group, post-treatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR, AUC = 0.651) and prognostic nutritional index (PNI, AUC = 0.687) predicted PFS, with optimal cutoffs at NLR < 2.40 and PNI ≥ 44.23. For the non-immunotherapy group, ΔPLR (change in platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio) predicted survival (AUC = 0.654, cutoff ΔPLR < 1.78). Other markers (pre-/post-treatment NLR, PLR, MLR, SII, PIV, PNI, and ΔNLR/ΔMLR/ΔSII/ΔPIV/ΔPNI) showed no predictive value in either group. Baseline PNI values were comparable between the immunotherapy group and the non-immunotherapy group, with no statistically significant difference observed (median PNI (IQR): 49.5 (42.1–52.8) vs. 48.9 (41.0–51.7), P = 0.62).

Discussion In China, 79.5% of ESCC patients are aged ≥60 years, with over 80% diagnosed at advanced stages. However, standard chemoradiotherapy remains poorly tolerated due to comorbidities, immunosenescence, and malnutrition (baseline PNI <45 in 72.3% of our cohort), resulting in 35% treatment discontinuation rates. While radiotherapy dose escalation up to 50.4 Gy fails to improve survival and increases pneumonitis risk [ 14–16 This retrospective study demonstrates that combining immunotherapy with chemoradiotherapy significantly prolongs median progression-free survival (13.7 vs. 10.9 months, P = 0.043) in elderly patients with inoperable ESCC, without increasing severe adverse events. Dynamic monitoring of peripheral inflammatory markers revealed prognostic value for post-treatment NLR and PNI in the immunotherapy group, and ΔPLR in the non-immunotherapy cohort. These findings highlight the clinical feasibility of immunochemoradiation and the predictive utility of accessible biomarkers in this high-risk population. Mechanistically, radiotherapy synergizes with ICIs by inducing immunogenic cell death, releasing tumor-associated antigens, and remodeling the immunosuppressive microenvironment [ 17 18 19–22 23 24 Systemic inflammatory response markers, including NLR and PNI, reflect immune-nutritional status and predict outcomes. Our results corroborate evidence that low NLR (<2.40) and high PNI (≥44.23) correlate with improved PFS, consistent with meta-analyses linking elevated PIV/SII to doubled mortality risk [ 25 26 This study provides several novel insights. We specifically focused on elderly patients (≥60 years) with inoperable ESCC, a population often underrepresented in clinical trials due to comorbidities, malnutrition, and limited treatment tolerance. Our findings demonstrate that immunotherapy combined with chemoradiotherapy significantly improves progression-free survival without substantially increasing severe toxicities, supporting its feasibility and safety in this vulnerable group. In addition, we highlight the prognostic value of simple and accessible peripheral markers: post-treatment NLR and PNI were predictive in the immunotherapy cohort, whereas ΔPLR was informative in the non-immunotherapy group. These results suggest that routine hematological indicators may serve as practical tools to guide personalized immunotherapy, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings. This study has several limitations that may affect the interpretation and applicability of the results. First, the retrospective single-center design introduces selection bias and limits external validity. Clinical characteristics, treatment approaches, and outcomes may vary across institutions and regions. Second, the lack of molecular profiling, specifically PD-L1 expression and tumor mutational burden, limits the study’s ability to stratify patients based on immunotherapy responsiveness. Third, the absence of longitudinal monitoring of systemic inflammatory response markers restricts understanding of their dynamic relationship with treatment efficacy or disease progression. The last limitation of our study is the heterogeneity of treatment regimens, as patients received different ICIs and chemotherapy protocols. Given the limited sample size, subgroup analyses were not feasible. Future large-scale studies are needed to clarify potential differences in efficacy and safety among various regimens in elderly ESCC patients. Due to insufficient death events, mature OS data were not yet available, and longer follow-up is required. 5. Conclusion Immunochemoradiation improves survival without exacerbating toxicity in elderly inoperable ESCC patients. Peripheral inflammatory markers offer practical prognostic tools to optimize therapeutic strategies. Larger prospective studies are needed to validate these findings and explore predictive biomarker combinations. Author contributions Conceptualization, BL.
