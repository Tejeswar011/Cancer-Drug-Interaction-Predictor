To date, over ten MSC-based therapies have been approved and marketed worldwide, with their potential applications increasingly recognized. In gynecology, the exploration and clinical application of MSCs has advanced rapidly, with MSCs derived from diverse sources—including bone marrow, adipose tissue, menstrual blood, umbilical cord, umbilical cord blood, and placenta—undergoing extensive research and clinical trials. Due to their self-renewal, multidirectional differentiation, and immunomodulatory capabilities, MSCs offer promising prospects for treating gynecological diseases. MSCs are being explored for the treatment of various conditions, such as uterine adhesions, endometriosis, premature ovarian insufficiency, polycystic ovary syndrome, pelvic floor dysfunction, and gynecological tumors. Notably, MSC therapies for uterine adhesions and early-onset ovarian failure have progressed to clinical application, demonstrating notable efficacy. However, challenges remain in applying MSCs in gynecology, including cell source selection, standardization of preparation methods, and assessment of safety and efficacy. This review aims to systematically summarize the current status of MSC applications in gynecology, analyze existing challenges, and propose future directions for development. With advancements in technology and ongoing research, MSCs are expected to demonstrate broader applications in gynecological disease treatment, benefiting a larger number of patients.

Initially discovered in bone marrow [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Currently, sixteen MSC therapies have been approved worldwide: ten derived from bone marrow, three from the umbilical cord, two from adipose tissue, and one from umbilical cord blood. These therapies are used to treat conditions such as acute graft-versus-host disease, acute myocardial infarction, complex anal fistulas in Crohn’s disease, osteoarthritis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and other diseases. MSCs are also widely explored in gynecology [ 19 20 21 1  Fig. 1 Sources and Applications of MSCs in Gynecology. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are extensively studied in the field of gynecology for various conditions, including primary ovarian insufficiency, intrauterine adhesion, pelvic floor dysfunction, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and gynecological tumors. These studies primarily utilize MSCs derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord or cord blood, placenta, endometrium, and menstrual blood. The schematic diagram is created with BioRender.com(Agreement number: IE28HDZZWG) Mesenchymal stem cells in gynecology MSCs are primarily sourced from two categories: adult sources and perinatal sources. Adult MSCs can be isolated from specific tissues, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, endometrium, peripheral blood, menstrual blood, dental pulp, and muscle. Perinatal mesenchymal stem cells are derived from the umbilical cord (including cord blood), placenta (such as the amnion, chorionic frondosum, and basal decidua), fetal membranes, and amniotic fluid [ 19 Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are the most established and widely used MSCs. BMSCs must be obtained through invasive methods, and their number in the bone marrow is limited (approximately 0.01 − 0.001%). Typically, BMSCs need to be expanded and cultured to obtain an adequate number of cells for treatment [ 22 23 24 In August 2022, the British Standards Institution (BSI) published the international standard ISO/TS 24651:2022 for BMSCs. This standard outlines the requirements for the collection, isolation, culture, characterization, quality control, cryopreservation, storage, thawing, distribution, and transport of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) for research purposes [ 25 Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADMSCs) are increasingly used due to their abundant availability, with up to 1 billion cells potentially generated from 300 g of adipose tissue through liposuction [ 26 27 28 29 30 Menstrual blood stem cells /endometrial mesenchymal stem cells First reported in 2007 [ 31 32 33 34 35 Endometrial mesenchymal stem cells (eMSCs), derived from the female endometrium, share similarities with MenSCs. eMSCs exhibit strong self-renewal capacity and multidirectional differentiation potential, contributing to the repair of the functional layer of the endometrium during the normal menstrual cycle. However, due to the challenges in collection, their clinical application potential is not as promising as that of MenSCs. eMSCs have shown potential for repairing endometrial damage in animal models [ 36 Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells The umbilical cord contains a high concentration of MSCs, which are typically isolated from Wharton’s jelly. In the umbilical cord, the highest concentration of MSCs and the highest derivation rate are isolated from Wharton’s jelly [ 37 38 39 40 Umbilical cord blood mesenchymal stem cells In addition to being enriched with MSCs, umbilical cord blood also contains MSCs, alongside the well-known hematopoietic stem cells [ 41 42 Placenta mesenchymal stem cells The placenta is a critical organ for material exchange between the fetus and the mother. Its structure primarily consists of the amnion, chorionic frondosum, and basal decidua, all of which are enriched with MSCs. Placenta mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) may have superior proliferative capacity compared to umbilical cord MSCs [ 43 44 The amnion is the innermost layer of the fetal membrane, directly in contact with both the amniotic fluid and the fetus. It consists of an epithelial layer, a basement membrane, and a mesenchymal layer. The amnion is a key component of the placenta, and its MSCs have become a focus of current research due to their potential in tissue repair and anti-inflammatory effects [ 45 46 Mesenchymal stem cell lines To achieve large-scale production and quality control of stem cells and their exosomes, researchers have begun to employ advanced techniques in the hope of obtaining more stable cell lines. In 1973, Reznikoff and colleagues isolated the C3H10T1/2 cell line [ 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 Chen et al. constructed an immortalized mesenchymal stem cell line, hTERT-UCMSC, by lentiviral transduction of hUC-MSC. The exosome production and characteristics of the immortalized hTERT-UCMSCs remained consistent with the primary cells up to the 35th generation, suggesting their potential for the treatment of liver failure [ 56 57 58 59 Despite the existence of these various cell lines, the most commonly used in gynecological disease research remains MSCs directly isolated from humans or mice/rats. Furthermore, developing an immortalized MSC line suitable for gynecological disease research represents a significant direction for future studies. Such a cell line would aid scientists in gaining a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of gynecological diseases and provide a robust tool for the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Mechanistic studies of mesenchymal stem cells in gynecology Similar to other fields of study, MSC research has been conducted through both in vivo and in vitro experiments. In addition to studying the direct effects of MSCs on gynecological diseases, research also explores the exosomes they secrete [ 60 61 62 1  Table 1 MSC-Binding materials in gynecological diseases Disease Type of MSC Combined Material Authors IUA BMSCs Poly(glycerol sebacate) Xiao B et al.

[ 154 Intrauterine adhesion Intrauterine adhesion (IUA), also called Asherman’s syndrome, is characterized by reduced or absent menstruation, cyclic pelvic pain, recurrent miscarriage, and infertility [ 63 64 65 66 67 68 The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is closely linked to fibrosis development [ 69 70 71 The therapeutic effects of different scaffolds loaded with BMSCs varied across studies. Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) scaffolds significantly prolonged the retention time of BMSCs in the damaged rat uterus, outperforming poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and collagen scaffolds. Additionally, the PGS/BMSCs group demonstrated direct differentiation into endometrial stromal cells post-injection, promoting increased endometrial thickness, gland number, and vascular regeneration. The pregnancy rate in the PGS/BMSCs group was significantly higher than in the other groups [ 72 73 ADMSCs significantly improved endometrial regeneration and angiogenesis in Asherman syndrome rats by upregulating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1). Additionally, miR-98 and miR-199a levels were significantly reduced in AS, but the treatment did not significantly alter their expression, indicating that the role of miRNAs in AS warrants further investigation [ 74 75 76 77 A recent study comparing the effects of BMSCs and ADMSCs in a rat model of Asherman syndrome found that both topical injections significantly increased endometrial thickness, outperforming intravenous ADMSCs. Topical ADMSCs were the most effective in reducing fibrosis, whereas intravenous BMSCs significantly increased VEGF expression, though the number of cells migrating to the damaged endothelium was low [ 78 In IUA, an increase in Collagen I is associated with fibrosis, a decrease in cytokeratin 18 (CK18) reflects a reduction in glands, and integrin αV regulates cellular function [ 79 81 82 Although eMSCs are generally considered difficult to use clinically, Xu Y et al. generated multi-lineage endometrial organoids (MLEOs) by co-culturing endometrial epithelium organoids with eMSCs, and used human acellular amniotic membrane (HAAM) as a biocompatible scaffold to form a MLEO-HAAM complex. This complex was then transplanted into a rat model of endometrial injury. The MLEO-HAAM complex was found to be effective in treating AS [ 83 Different injection doses and methods influence the efficacy of hUC-MSCs. In vitro experiments have shown that hUC-MSCs exert their therapeutic potential in IUA by modulating the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway [ 84 6 6 6 6 85 Combining hUC-MSCs with novel materials to enhance their effects is common in studies. hUC-MSCs combined with hydrogel reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6), increased anti-inflammatory factors (Interleukin-10 (IL-10)), modulated the inflammatory response, activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK/ERK1/2) signaling pathway, induced VEGF expression, and increased embryo implantation and live birth rates. These findings highlight their potential in repairing endometrial damage and restoring fertility [ 86 87 88 89 90 In addition to the traditional rat model, in the rabbit model, Wang JJ et al. also found that hUCB-MSCs significantly repaired endometrial injury in the IUA model by promoting endometrial glandular hyperplasia and decreasing the level of fibrosis. The mechanism may be related to inhibiting the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase / protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway and upregulating the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor 4, a PI3K/AKT pathway-associated anti-fibrotic molecule [ 91 Overall, MSCs, either alone or in combination with certain materials, can promote endometrial glandular and vascular proliferation, alleviate inflammatory responses, reduce fibrosis, improve endometrial damage, and restore endometrial function in IUA through various mechanisms. MSCs can undoubtedly be used to treat IUA (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Therapeutic Mechanisms of MSCs in IUA. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, and menstrual blood are key for intrauterine adhesion (IUA) repair. BMSCs ADMSCs UC-MSCs MenSCs Endometriosis Endometriosis (EMs) is a major disease that impacts women’s reproductive health, with key symptoms including progressive dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, deep painful intercourse, and infertility [ 92 93 94 95 Research on MenSCs is increasing, and they are more readily available compared to eMSCs. One study demonstrated a significant upregulation of genes related to stem cell properties, apoptosis, migration, invasion, inflammation, and angiogenesis in endometriosis patients (E-MenSCs) by comparing gene expression between menstrual blood stem cells from E-MenSCs and healthy women. Inflammation-related genes, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-γ, and NF-κB, showed significantly increased expression in E-MenSCs [ 96 97 BMSCs may contribute to the progression of endometriosis, potentially by secreting nutritional factors that promote the proliferation of endometriotic cells and upregulating the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 1, thereby facilitating lesion growth [ 98 99 100 Although BMSCs may promote the development of endometriotic lesions, a study by Dwiningsih SR et al. found that BMSC transplantation in a mouse model of endometriosis reduced the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1 (TNFα-R1), decreased granulocyte apoptosis, and improved follicle formation [ 101 In contrast to BMSCs, ADMSCs suppress endometriosis through immune modulation. Meligy FY et al. pointed out that ADMSCs treatment significantly reduced the number of CD68-positive macrophages in the endometriosis mouse model and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as interferon-γ (IFNγ), TNF-α, and IL-1β), while enhancing the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but had no significant effect on IL-6 [ 102 103 103 It has been found that hUC-MSCs can significantly reduce nerve fiber density in endometriotic lesions, which may have a positive effect on alleviating endometriosis-related pain, though the exact mechanism remains unclear [ 104 105 106 In conclusion, in the context of endometriosis, BMSCs, eMSCs, and MenSCs may all promote the development of the disease, and the current focus of research is to block the mechanisms by which they contribute to its progression. ADMSCs have been shown to inhibit endometriosis through immune regulation; however, due to a limited number of studies, the specific regulatory factors involved remain debatable. The role of hUC-MSCs is still unclear, and further experiments are needed to elucidate their involvement in the development of endometriosis. Premature ovarian insufficiency and/or premature ovarian failure Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as ovarian dysfunction that occurs in women before the age of 40 and is characterized by elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, decreased estrogen levels, and menopausal symptoms, which ultimately result in the loss of fertility [ 107 107 108 109 110 MSCs have been widely studied for their potential therapeutic effects on POI, with a particular focus on umbilical cord-derived MSCs. Exosomes derived from MSCs have also been extensively investigated in the context of POI; however, this aspect will not be summarized in this paper. The primary outcomes of these studies generally assess ovarian function recovery, including increases in ovarian size and weight, follicle count, granulosa cell numbers, estradiol (E2) levels, and decreases in FSH levels. Most animal models used in these studies were induced by cyclophosphamide (CTX), while some used zona pellucida sperm-binding protein 3 (ZP3) peptide to induce autoimmune POI. UC-MSCs treatment has been shown to significantly improve ovarian function and restore hormone secretion and follicular development in chemotherapy (CTX)-induced POI. The underlying mechanisms for this effect are primarily related to the reduction of granulosa cell apoptosis and modulation of the immune response. UC-MSCs inhibit granulosa cell apoptosis through the activation of the AKT and P38 signaling pathways, while also down-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-1β, and up-regulating the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), and VEGF. This results in a reduction in polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) and macrophage (Mφ) infiltration in ovarian tissues, ultimately alleviating the inflammatory response [ 111 112 113 114 Beyond mouse and rat models, studies have also been conducted using porcine models of POF. Cai J et al. administered hUC-MSCs to a CTX-induced POF model in Tibetan pigs, and their findings suggested that hUC-MSCs may inhibit apoptosis via regulation of the AKT/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. They also significantly improved ovarian function and structure in these pigs, as well as modulated hormone levels [ 115 In addition, metabolomics studies have explored the mechanisms by which hUC-MSCs restore ovarian function. hUC-MSCs improved ovarian function in CTX-induced POI mice by activating the nuclear-related factor-2 (Nrf-2) antioxidant pathway, enhancing iron metabolism (Nrf-2/ ferritin heavy chain 1(FTH1)), and promoting the antioxidant response (Nrf-2/ glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)), thereby inhibiting ferroptosis [ 116 117 118 In addition to chemotherapy-induced POF, hUC-MSCs have shown therapeutic effects in autoimmune-induced POF rat or mouse models [ 119 120  Fig. 3 Therapeutic mechanisms of UC-MSCs in POI. Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) are a promising treatment for premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). They modulate the immune microenvironment by downregulating cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-1β, IFN-γ) and upregulating cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, TSG-6, VEGF). UC-MSCs reduce the number of Th1 cells, neutrophils (PMN), uterine NK cells (uNK cells), and macrophages ( Mφ While umbilical cord MSCs have been the primary focus of research (Fig. 3 121 122 BMSCs have also shown potential in enabling the formation or repair of primordial follicles in the ovaries of CTX-induced POF mice, restoring hormonal balance and fertility in the damaged ovaries [ 123 124 124 Recently, ADMSCs have been shown to increase the number of healthy follicles in a CTX-induced POI model, improve anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels, and exert an anti-apoptotic effect by regulating the expression of proteins such as Caspase3, Connexin43, and Pannexin1 [ 125 MenSCs have also demonstrated the ability to improve ovarian function in chemotherapy (cisplatin-induced) POF mice by reducing granulosa cell apoptosis and ovarian interstitial fibrosis. Their reparative effects are mainly mediated through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), rather than direct differentiation into oocytes [ 126 127 In addition to the commonly studied MSCs, some emerging MSCs have shown promising potential for breakthroughs in POI treatment. Human hair follicle-derived MSCs may improve ovarian function in a cyclophosphamide-induced premature ovarian failure mouse model by inhibiting ferroptosis in granulosa cells and modulating the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)/NRF2/HO-1 pathway. They are considered to be more effective than hUC-MSCs [ 128 129 130 Polycystic ovary syndrome Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovarian morphology [ 131 132 In rat models of PCOS, ADMSCs were found to significantly improve ovarian function and metabolic status by regulating mitochondrial dynamics, enhancing mitochondrial function, and reducing oxidative stress and inflammatory responses via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [ 133 134 Chugh RM et al. reported that hBMSC treatment significantly improved metabolic phenotypes restored normal ovarian function, and increased fertility in PCOS mice. The inflammation-modulatory effects of hBMSC treatment included a significant increase in the gene expression of IL-10 and its receptor in ovarian tissues, elevated serum levels of IL-10, IFN-γ, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2, and a decrease in the gene expression of pro-inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-1β, CCL2, and CD11c in the adipose tissue of PCOS mice [ 135 136 In vitro experiments on PMSCs have shown that these cells may restore folliculogenesis, repair ovarian function, correct hormonal imbalances, and improve lipid profiles and liver function in a PCOS rat model. These effects were mediated through the secretion of various biologically active mediators, such as growth factors and anti-apoptotic cytokines, modulation of intra-ovarian signaling pathways, promotion of angiogenesis, and improvement in blood perfusion to damaged ovarian tissues [ 137 In addition to studies on cell therapy using MSCs, research on MSC-derived exosomes for the treatment of PCOS has been extensive but will not be discussed in detail here [ 138 139 Dysfunctional pelvic floor disorders Pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) occurs when the supportive tissues of the female pelvic floor become weakened due to degeneration and trauma. It encompasses a range of disorders, including pelvic organ prolapse (POP), stress urinary incontinence (SUI), and genital fistulae [ 140 141 In a study using an aged rat model with a total vaginal incision, Ben Menachem-Zidon O et al. found that BMSCs significantly improved the inflammatory response in aged rats. This was evidenced by a reduction in the number of CD68 + macrophages and a decrease in the co-expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α [ 142 143 144 145 146 147 Zhu L’s team explored the potential of hUC-MSC transplantation in repairing vaginal tissue damage in a de-ovulated rhesus monkey model. They found that hUC-MSCs significantly up-regulated the expression of smooth muscle, collagen I, elastin, and fibrillin-5 while down-regulating the expression of MMP2, MMP9, and MMP13 [ 148 149 150 151 In another study, ADMSCs were obtained from young female rats and applied to a rat anterior vaginal wall nerve injury model induced by bilateral pubic neurotomy. The results showed that ADMSCs significantly increased the nerve content of the anterior vaginal wall. Additionally, gene expression analysis related to nerve regeneration revealed that the group treated with ADMSCs on gelatin scaffolds exhibited higher and earlier expression of nerve-related marker genes at the early stages of treatment [ 152 153 Furthermore, studies have shown that scaffolds seeded with eMSCs improved tissue repair, enhanced biomechanical properties, and reduced foreign body reactions in immunodeficient POP rats. This combination of eMSCs and novel gelatin-coated polyamide scaffolds provided significant therapeutic benefits, although this model does have limitations in fully mimicking the physiological environment of human POP repair [ 154 With their strong regenerative capabilities, MSCs combined with novel scaffold materials hold great promise for the treatment of pelvic floor dysfunction. This innovative therapy not only significantly reduces surgical trauma but also enables long-lasting cellular repair and tissue regeneration through the slow-release properties of the scaffold. This approach offers a safer and more effective long-term treatment option for patients suffering from pelvic floor disorders. Gynecological tumors Gynecological malignant tumors, including ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer (EC), and cervical cancer, pose significant health risks for women. Traditional treatment options, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, have reached a therapeutic bottleneck, prompting the exploration of novel approaches such as immunotherapy and cell therapy [ 155 157 In ovarian cancer, the mechanisms of MSC therapy are complex and present contradictory findings. For example, Chu Y et al. used both in vitro and in vivo models to demonstrate that ADMSCs may promote the proliferation and invasion of epithelial ovarian cancer cells by upregulating MMPs [ 158 159 160 158 161 Some studies have explored the use of MSCs as vectors for targeted ovarian cancer treatment. Shi S et al. demonstrated the potential of using BMSCs as vectors to deliver lentivirus-mediated E4-NIS genes to ovarian cancer cells [ 162 163 (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT02068794 MSCs have been less extensively studied in the context of EC and cervical cancer. However, there have been promising findings in these areas. For example, it has been reported that eMSCs inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by secreting dickkopf-1-related proteins, which in turn suppresses the proliferation and stemness of EC cells. This effect is more pronounced than that observed with ADMSCs or UC-MSCs. Furthermore, the inhibitory impact of eMSCs combined with progesterone appears to be superior to progesterone treatment alone in EC cells, which may offer a potential fertility-preserving therapeutic strategy for young EC patients [ 164 165 166 168 Clinical research on mesenchymal stem cells in gynecology No drugs have been approved for marketing for the use of MSCs in treating gynecological diseases. As of March 16, 2025, 1,551 MSC-related studies have been registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov www.clinicaltrials.gov m 169 178 ( NCT03386708  NCT02313415  NCT02680366  NCT03724617  NCT02644447  NCT02603744  NCT02912104  NCT01804153 Challenges and prospects Despite numerous breakthroughs in stem cell therapy, significant challenges remain for its advancement. The mechanisms underlying the differentiation and regulatory networks of MSCs are not yet fully understood, leading to a wide range of research findings that often contradict each other. This inconsistency not only creates uncertainty in clinical applications but also hinders the standardization of treatment protocols. Moreover, while MSCs exhibit promising biological properties in vitro, their long-term efficacy and safety in vivo require further validation through extensive clinical trials involving larger patient cohorts. A key challenge lies in the methods for large-scale production and quality control of MSCs, which are crucial to ensuring the safety and efficacy of cell therapies. This remains one of the main reasons why many research outcomes struggle to transition into clinical practice and fail to deliver effective benefits to patients. For instance, Alofisel, an allogeneic adipose-derived MSC therapy for Crohn’s disease [ 179 181 182 Additionally, the high cost of MSC therapy, often reaching tens of thousands of dollars, further limits its widespread use. Developing efficient, cost-effective, and personalized therapies to benefit a larger patient population remains a significant challenge. However, the future of MSC therapy remains promising. As research continues to uncover the underlying mechanisms, this technology is expected to become safer and more efficient, potentially becoming a powerful tool for enhancing women’s health. MSCs represent not only a significant advancement in medical science but also a beacon of hope for many women suffering from gynecological diseases. They show great potential in treating infertility, refractory gynecological conditions, and cancer treatment and preservation. For example, MSC therapy has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in treating IUA and POI, offering new solutions to problems that conventional medicine has struggled to address. Looking to the future, the once ‘intractable diseases’ may eventually become a thing of the past, with MSCs playing a pivotal role in this transformation. As technology advances, the sources of MSCs will become increasingly diverse, ranging from bone marrow and adipose tissue to umbilical cord and placenta, providing more options for personalized treatment. With the continued progress of science and technology, MSCs are expected to be further optimized to better meet the individual needs of patients. We have reason to believe that MSC therapy will play a crucial role in more disease areas and bring significant benefits to patients worldwide.
