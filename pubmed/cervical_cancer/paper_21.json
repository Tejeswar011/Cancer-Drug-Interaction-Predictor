Purpose Chemotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become the standard first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer, but its efficacy remains suboptimal. This study aimed to evaluate whether the addition of radiation therapy (RT) to ICIs can improve patients’ survival. Methods and Materials This retrospective cohort study analyzed clinical data from 178 patients with recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer who were treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC between December 2019 and October 2023. Based on their actual treatment regimens, patients were stratified into 2 groups: the chemoimmunotherapy-alone group (ICIs group) and the chemoimmunotherapy combined with RT group (ICIs + RT group). To minimize selection bias, propensity score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics between the groups before comparative analysis. The primary endpoint was overall survival, and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival and safety. Results After propensity score matching, 128 patients were selected for the final analysis, with 64 patients in the ICIs + RT group and 64 patients in the ICIs group. The median follow-up time was 11.26 months (95% CI, 7.02-15.32). The median overall survival was 23.71 months in the ICIs + RT group and 13.00 months in the ICIs group (hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.31-0.88; P P Conclusions Adding RT can significantly improve survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer who are treated with chemoimmunotherapy, but further prospective trials are needed for validation. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Esophageal cancer is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death globally. 1 2 , 3 4 5 6 7 A multitude of retrospective and prospective studies from the era of chemotherapy have demonstrated that radiation therapy (RT) can effectively relieve the symptoms of dysphagia in patients with advanced esophageal cancer, thereby improving the quality of life and nutritional status of these patients. Furthermore, palliative RT targeting the esophageal lesion has been demonstrated to significantly prolong OS in patients whose disease is well controlled after first-line chemotherapy. 8 , 9 4 , 6 Theoretically, RT and immunotherapy have synergistic effects. The Keynote Evaluating Your New Oncology Therapy Experiment (KEYNOTE)-001 study, which investigated the efficacy of pembrolizumab (an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy) in later-line treatments for various solid tumors, demonstrated that patients who had previously received RT exhibited superior outcomes with ICIs. 10 11 , 12 The aim of this study was to evaluate whether RT can provide survival benefits in patients with recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer receiving ICIs treatment and to analyze the safety of the combined treatment. Methods and Materials Study design and participants This retrospective study analyzed clinical data from patients with metastatic or recurrent esophageal cancer who received first-line chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy at the First Affiliated Hospital of USTC Cancer Center between December 2019 and October 2023. Through electronic medical record screening, 178 cases meeting preliminary eligibility criteria were initially identified. After rigorous reevaluation against inclusion criteria, propensity score matching (PSM) was ultimately applied, yielding 128 well-matched cases for final analysis ( Fig. 1 Figure 1 Research process. Abbreviations Figure 1 Pretreatment examinations included hematologic and biochemical tests, esophagogastric biopsies, contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT), neck/abdominal CT or ultrasound, positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT), esophageal magnetic resonance imaging, and barium swallow studies. Tumor staging was performed in accordance with the Eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system. The study employed standardized oncological definitions for disease progression patterns: locoregional recurrence (LRR) encompassed tumor reappearance either at the primary site or within regional lymphatic drainage basins, while disease progression involving extraregional lymph node stations or systemic organs was classified as distant metastasis (DM). All patients in the ICIs group had no history of RT or endoscopic therapy. Seven patients in the ICIs + RT group had previously received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or definitive chemoradiotherapy. Furthermore, all patients included in the study underwent systemic therapy combining paclitaxel- and platinum-based chemotherapy combined with ICIs ( Table 1 Table 1 Patients’ characteristics and treatment information before and after PSM * , † Table 1 Before PSM After PSM Characteristics Level Total (n = 165,%) ICIs (n = 101,%) ICIs+RT (n = 64,%) P Total (n = 128,%) ICIs (n = 64,%) ICIs+RT (n = 64,%) P Gender Female 142 (86.06) 88 (87.13) 54 (84.38) .619 18 (15.16) 8 (12.50) 10 (15.62 .611 Male 23 (13.94) 13 (12.87) 10 (15.62) 110 (85.94) 56 (87.50) 54 (84.38) Age <70 83 (50.30) 45 (44.55) 38 (59.38) .064 67 (52.34) 29 (45.31) 38 (59.38) .111 ≥70 82 (49.70) 56 (55.45) 26 (40.62) 61 (47.66) 35 (54.69) 26 (40.62) Location Lower 15 (9.09) 7 (6.93) 8 (12.50) .347 52 (40.62) 29 (45.31) 23 (35.94) .225 Middle 82 (49.70) 49 (48.51) 33 (51.56) 65 (50.78) 32 (50.00) 33 (51.56) Upper 68 (41.21) 45 (44.55) 23 (35.94) 11 (8.59) 3 (4.69) 8 (12.50) Stage Ⅲ-ⅣA 72 (43.64) 44 (43.56) 28 (43.75) .981 53 (41.41) 25 (39.06) 28 (43.75) .474 ⅣB 93 (56.36) 57 (56.44) 36 (56.25) 75 (58.59) 39 (60.94) 36 (56.25) ECOG 0 79 (47.88) 40 (39.60) 39 (60.94) .008 74 (57.81) 35 (54.69) 39 (60.94) .719 1 86 (52.12) 61 (60.40) 25 (39.06) 54 (42.19) 29 (45.31) 25 (39.06) Abbreviations: ⁎ All patients received paclitaxel-based therapy combined with platinum-based agents. † Patients in the ICIs+RT group received a median radiation dose of 50 Gy. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the institutional review board, and because of its retrospective nature, informed consent was waived. Treatment and follow-up The most commonly employed chemotherapy regimens consisted of systemic therapy combining paclitaxel with platinum-based compounds. The primary immunotherapeutic agents were anti-PD-1 antibodies, specifically including camrelizumab, tislelizumab, and pembrolizumab, which were administered either concurrently with or sequentially to chemotherapy. Radiation therapy was performed using intensity modulated RT or volumetric-modulated arc therapy with an energy of 6 MV. The RT followed the involved-field irradiation principle. The gross tumor volume of the primary tumor (GTVp) was defined as the primary esophageal tumor, and the gross tumor volume of lymph nodes was defined as positive lymph nodes confirmed by contrast-enhanced CT, PET/CT scans, or cytology. For the locoregional field, GTVp of the primary lesion was expanded with 3 cm margins proximally and distally, GTVp and gross tumor volume of lymph nodes along with a 0.8 cm radial margin, to generate the clinical target volume. The planning gross tumor volume (PGTV) and the planning target volume (PTV) exceeded the GTV or clinical target volume by 5 mm in 3 dimensions. For patients with distant metastases, positive cervical and abdominal lymph nodes were typically included in the radiation field, while local treatment was optional for distant organs such as the lungs, liver, and bones. For locoregional lesions field (36 cases, 56.3%), the prescribed doses for PGTV or PTV were 40 to 60 Gy in 20 to 30 fractions using simultaneously integrated boost technique on 5 consecutive days per week ( Table E1 Table E1 Radiation therapy mainly targeted the primary tumor, mediastinal metastatic lymph nodes, nonregional lymph nodes, and distant metastatic organs, using intensity modulated RT or volumetric-modulated arc therapy with an energy of 6 MV. The patients were followed up every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 2 years, and annually after 5 years. Clinical examinations included routine blood tests and tumor markers, contrast-enhanced chest CT, neck/abdominal CT or ultrasound, barium swallow studies, and PET/CT if indicated. Endpoints and statistical analysis Intergroup covariate comparisons were performed using Pearson’s χ² test or Fisher’s exact probability test for nominal variables. To address potential confounding bias, PSM analysis was implemented. Propensity scores were derived through multivariable logistic regression incorporating clinically relevant covariates: gender, chronological age, ECOG performance status, and tumor staging parameters. Applying a nearest-neighbor matching algorithm with a caliper width of 0.02 SDs and 1:1 matching ratio, 2 well-balanced cohorts were successfully generated, each comprising 64 matched cases. The primary endpoint of this study was the OS of the included patients. Secondary endpoints included the PFS, safety, and tolerability. Continuous variables were summarized using descriptive statistics, including mean, SD, median, and range. Categorical variables were tabulated as frequencies and percentages. The OS was calculated from the date of recurrent/metastatic diagnosis until death or censoring, while the PFS was measured from the date of recurrent/metastatic diagnosis to disease progression, death, or censoring. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate PFS and OS. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression models were applied to identify significant prognostic factors affecting PFS and OS.

The mOS was 18.14 months for subgroup A and not reached for subgroup B (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.23-1.6; P Fig. E1 Further analysis was conducted to determine the value of adding RT to the treatment regimen for 2 distinct patient subgroups, namely those with only local recurrence and those with DM. A total of 42.2% of the patients in the ICIs + RT group and 39.1% of the patients in the ICIs group experienced only local recurrence. For the patients with DM, the mOS was 18.14 months in the ICIs + RT group and 11.42 months in the ICIs group (HR, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.43-1.28, P Fig. 3 P Fig. 3 P Fig. 3 P Fig. 3 Figure 3 Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with distant metastasis and locoregional recurrence in ICIs + RT and ICIs groups.

Similarly, the the Evaluation of Safety and Clinical Outcome of Recombinant T-cell Therapy-1 (ESCORT-1) study reported the mPFS and mOS of 6.9 and 15.3 months, respectively. 15 , 16 A number of studies have reported disparate OS outcomes for patients with locoregionally recurrent esophageal cancer treated with RT or chemoradiotherapy, with reported values ranging from 7.0 to 24.3 months. 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 The optimal radiation dose for recurrent metastatic esophageal cancer remains controversial. Guttmann et al 25 26 P Figs. E2 27 28 Another concern with combination therapy is toxicity. In a phase 1b trial of RT (60 Gy in 30 fractions) combined with camrelizumab as first-line treatment for locally advanced ESCC, 10 out of 19 patients (53%) experienced grade 3-4 adverse events. 29 30 Table 3 Our study has several limitations that should be addressed. First, the results are limited by the retrospective design and the small sample size. Although the only significantly different variable between the ICIs + RT group and the ICIs group was the line of chemoradiotherapy, inherent selection bias remains. Second, the lack of essential biomarker information, such as PD-L1 expression, is a significant limitation. Finally, a notable limitation of this study is its exclusive focus on patients with squamous cell carcinoma, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to adenocarcinoma or other non- squamous cell carcinoma subtypes. In conclusion, our study indicates that adding RT to chemoradiotherapy significantly improves the OS of patients with locally advanced recurrent and metastatic esophageal cancer with good safety. We acknowledge that our results require validation and further improvements in larger, prospective, multicenter studies.
