This study aims to summarize the specific ultrasonic manifestations of UCD. Methods This retrospective study included patients who underwent preoperative ultrasound for enlarged lymph nodes and were later diagnosed with UCD between January 2016 and March 2024. Ultrasound features, including lymph node size, cortical characteristics, corticomedullary interface, hyperechoic regions, and Doppler flow signals, were recorded. Pathological types were classified as hyaline vascular (HV), plasma cell (PC), or mixed. The ultrasonic features of each UCD subtype were systematically analyzed. Results A total of 41 patients were enrolled in the study, comprising 29 with HV-type, 4 with PC-type, and 8 with a mixed type. All patients presented with enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) characterized by a solitary mass, well-defined margins, and increased cortical thickness. Among these, 95.12% (39/41) exhibited an indistinct corticomedullary interface. Additionally, 41.46% (17/41) showed eccentric or asymmetrical cortical thickening, while 58.54% (24/41) demonstrated complete effacement of the fatty hilum. Approximately 24.39% (10/41) of cases exhibited macrocalcification, and 56.10% (23/41) displayed short linear hyperechoic foci within the lymph nodes. Furthermore, patients with HV-type and mixed-type conditions exhibited more abundant blood flow signals compared to those with PC-type (75.86% vs. 25% vs. 87.50%, P Conclusions Ultrasound characteristics of UCD generally comprise sizable, solitary masses with clearly delineated borders, a thickened cortex, and disappearance of the fatty hilum. Principal imaging indicators encompass microcalcifications and short linear hyper-echoes. Ultrasound represents an effective and non-invasive modality for the early identification and diagnosis of UCD. Trial registration Retrospectively registered.

We aim to summarize the characteristic ultrasonic features of UCD, thereby enhancing diagnostic accuracy for clinicians. Materials and methods Study design and patients This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (Approval No: S-K1539), and the requirement for written informed consent was waived. Patients from Peking Union Medical College Hospital between January 2016 and March 2024 were included. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Patients diagnosed with unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) based on complete lymph node resection biopsy and clinical features consistent with solitary enlarged lymph nodes; (2) Patients who had undergone preoperative ultrasound examination. Ultrasonic imaging All US examinations were performed using Resona 7 or 8 devices (L 5–14, Mindray Medical, Shenzhen, China), Acuson S2000 (L 8–14, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany), and the iU22 machine (L 5–12, Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Both 2D and color Doppler images were reviewed. Based on previous reports, the following US features were used to evaluate LNs. For multiple enlarged lymph nodes (LNs) within a single station, ultrasound (US) images of the biopsied LNs were assessed. In grayscale ultrasound, lymph node size (long and short diameters), LN shape (regular, lobulated), margin (well-defined, obscure), cortex characteristics (eccentrical or asymmetrical thickened cortex and complete effacement of the fatty hilum), corticomedullary interface (clear, unclear), matting (yes, no), macrocalcification (yes, no), and short linear sign (yes, no) were recorded [ 13 14 1  Fig. 1 Two sonographic presenting patterns of unicentric Castleman disease. The grayscale US images (left) and the schematic illustration images (right) are shown in the figures A A1-A2 B B1-B2 US, ultrasound; LN, lymph node For Color Doppler imaging, the gain was standardized by initially increasing it until background noise became visible, followed by a slight reduction to eliminate noise and prevent overestimation of vascularity [ 13 15 16 13 17 Pathological diagnosis of SLNs Combined with clinical and imaging examinations, surgical resection or core biopsy was performed on patients with suspected lymphadenopathy (LN). Pathological findings helped classify the lesions into three subtypes of Castleman disease (CD): hyaline vascular subtype (HV), plasma cell subtype (PC), and mixed subtype. The HV subtype was identified by atrophic follicles with hyaline vessels and concentric rings of lymphocytes, along with a predominance of lymphocytes in the interfollicular areas. The PC subtype was characterized by the absence of follicular hyaline vessels in LN structures and notable aggregation of plasma cells in the interfollicular zone. Lesions showing both HV and PC features were classified as the mixed subtype [ 18 Statistical analyses The continuous variable was shown as the mean ± standard deviation and analyzed by an independent two-sample t-test. Categorical variables were expressed as cases and percentages and analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test. P Results Patient characteristics of the cohorts A total of 41 patients were ultimately included in this study, comprising 25 females (60.98%) and 16 males (39.02%). The mean age of the patients was 34.34 years, with a standard deviation of 13.57 years. Regarding clinical manifestations, 36.59% (15/41) of UCD patients were asymptomatic and incidentally detected during imaging examinations, while 46.34% (19/41) had palpable masses. 56.10% (23/41) of cases involve superficial lymph nodes, including inguinal ( n n n 1  Table 1 The clinical baseline of UCD patients Clinical characteristics UCD ( n Age 34.34 ± 13.57 Gender Female 25(60.98) Male 16(39.02) Histopathology Hyaline vascular type (HV) 29 (70.73) Plasma cell type (PC) 4(9.76) Mixed type 8(19.51) Clinical manifestations By palpation at physical examination 19(46.34) Compression symptoms 7(17.07) Incidentally discovered by imaging 15(36.59) Distribution superficial 22(53.66) deep 19(46.34) Lymph node distribution Single enlarged LN 30(73.17) Multiple enlarged LNs in one area 11(26.83) Lymph Node Location Retroperitoneal 11(26.83) Abdominal pelvic cavity 7(17.07) Inguinal 2(4.88) Axilla 5(12.20) Cervical 16(39.02) US findings for UCD and image analysis The ultrasound findings for all patients are summarized in Table 2 2  Table 2 The ultrasound characteristics of all patients with UCD Ultrasound characteristics UCD ( n Long axis (length, L) (cm) 4.37 ± 1.52 Short axis (depth, S) (cm) 2.46 ± 1.20 Long/short-axis ratio (L/S ratio) 1.99 ± 0.77 L/S ratio < 2.00 22 L/S ratio ≥ 2.00 13 L/S ratio ≥ 3.00 6 Nodal shape Oval 33(80.49) Lobulated 8(19.51) Cortex thickness(cm) 2.12 ± 1.26 Cortex characteristic Eccentric or asymmetrical thickened cortex 17(41.46) Complete effacement of fatty hilum 24(58.54) Corticomedullar interface Clear 2(4.88) Unclear 39(95.12) Macrocalcification 0 31(75.61) 1 10 (24.39) Short linear hyperechoic foci​ 0 18(43.90) 1 23(56.10) Either macrocalcification or short linear hyperechoic foci 30(73.17%) Both macrocalcification and short linear hyperechoic foci​ 3(7.32%) Blood distribution None 4(9.76) Hilar color flow 3(7.32) Non-Hilar color flow 34(82.92) Blood volume No color 4(9.76) Minimal 7(17.07) Abundant 30(73.17)  Fig. 2 US images from a 36-year-old man with a palpable mass in the left cervical region.

Our results demonstrated that the UCD usually exhibited enlarged lymph nodes with complete effacement of the fatty hilum and unclear corticomedullary interface. 73.17% of patients showed a strong echo, including either macrocalcification or short linear hyperechoic foci within the LNs, which were notably characteristic findings for UCD. In addition, compared with the PCV, the HV groups exhibited more abundant blood flow signals for lymph nodes. In our study, the majority of UCDs were detected incidentally by physical examination or medical visits for palpable masses. UCD classically presents as hypoechoic masses with increased volume and cortical thickening, which is associated with pronounced follicular hyperplasia in the cortical region and atrophic germinal centers [ 18 19 20 22 23 25 This study describes the observation of central short linear echogenic foci within unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) lesions. This ultrasonographic feature, observed in 56.10% of cases in our cohort, suggests considerable diagnostic value for UCD. Histopathologically, the echogenic foci are hypothesized to correspond to the proliferative fibrovascular stroma and hyalinized vessels that characteristically surround the hyperplastic lymphoid follicles in UCD, particularly the hyaline-vascular subtype [ 26 27 28 29 27 30 26 For different CD histological types, HV-type patients generally exhibit combined blood flow patterns and abundant flow signals. According to a previous study, after the administration of a contrast agent, the enhancement degree of the PV type is usually lower than that of the HV type [ 20 18 The diagnosis of CD is often suspected initially owing to radiographic findings. In this study, we propose some imaging signs to provide auxiliary guidance for physicians during clinical procedures. In particular, the two characteristic patterns may be helpful for the diagnosis of CD. However, accurate preoperative diagnosis of CD is difficult based on radiologic features alone. The US findings can be manifestations of several diseases, including lymphoma, metastatic LN, and other diseases. Future research will therefore require considerably larger cohorts to investigate any difference. Our study has some limitations. First, it is a single-center retrospective study; due to the low incidence of UCD, the number of cases included in this study was relatively limited. As our hospital is a comprehensive tertiary hospital for the rarity of CD, our study includes the largest UCD cohort to date. Second, for some deep-seated LNs, the richness of blood flow might be underestimated due to the application of a relatively low-frequency probe. Future prospective studies need to be conducted with a standardized diagnostic workup. Conclusions UCD is typically manifested as a solitary enlarged lymph node with a thick cortex, absence of medullary structure, and an unclear cortico-medullary demarcation. These lesions showed macrocalcification or short linear hyperechoic patterns. They may indicate a diagnosis of UCD. Additionally, compared with PV, the HV group presented more often with abundant color flow signals on color Doppler flow imaging. Ultrasound is expected to play a significant role in the evaluation of UCD and in guiding appropriate regions for biopsies.
