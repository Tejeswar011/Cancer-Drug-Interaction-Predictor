In recent years, research into the background of carcinogenic processes has increasingly focused on the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in tumorigenesis. In addition to the presence of tumor cells and non-malignant components, which include immune cells, extracellular matrix elements, stroma, and endothelial cells, the microbiome is now increasingly being classified as an integral part of the TME. The establishment of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) in 2007 along with the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques proved to be a breakthrough in terms of human microbiota research, shedding new light on the existing knowledge of microorganisms inhabiting various niches of the human body and their functions. Emerging scientific evidence from preclinical and clinical studies indicates significant differences in the microbiome composition between tumor tissues and benign controls. The presence of specific pathogenic strains within a tissue may play a key role in the initiation and progression of inflammation, which not only may be directly responsible for the stimulation of tumorigenic processes but may also affect the destabilization of the host genome, causing significant disruption of its metabolism. The role of microorganisms in the induction and promotion of pathological processes, including cancer, has been confirmed in many studies to date. Recent years of research on the microbiota of the female reproductive tract (FRT) have not only indicated that the endometrium has its unique microbial composition but have also made it possible to point out differences in composition between the microbiome of healthy and tumor-lesioned tissue, suggesting a potential role for dysbiotic disorders in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer (EC). In this review, we aim to highlight the complex interplay between bacterial interactions and host immunity, and how this phenomenon contributes to the development and progression of endometrial cancer. endometrial cancer endometrial microbiota dysbiosis tumor microenvironment estrabolome gut microbiota The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The diagram illustrates the potential sources of microorganisms colonizing the endometrial environment, highlighting the role of the anatomical, mechanical and haematogenic factors. 1 – Dysfunction of uterine peristaltic activity can promote colonization through enhanced transport caused by increased frequency of contractions. 2 – Microorganisms entering from the vagina. 3 – The cervical mucus suppository limits but does not completely block the passage of microorganisms from the vagina 4 – The peristaltic pump supports the transport of sperm cells from the cervix, which may be accompanied by a movement of other factors, including bacteria. 5 – Endometrium can also be colonized by microorganisms spread by blood that originate from the oral cavity (A) (B) (C) https://BioRender.com/xmrvrud Illustration of the female reproductive system with labeled parts: fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus, endometrium, cervix, cervical mucus plug, and vagina. Arrows point from mouth, lungs, and stomach to blood cells, highlighting systemic interactions. 2.2 Representatives of endometrial microbiota Similar to the vaginal microbiome, it is commonly believed that the endometrium of healthy women is a niche dominated by bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus 3 Lactobacillus iners Prevotella Lactobacillus crispatus 4 Flavobacterium Lactobacillus 5 6 Lactobacillus Gardnerella Bifidobacterium Streptococcus Prevotella Lactobacillus 8 16 Lactobacillus 8 9 Lactobacillus 10 Despite the prominent results, it is still hard to determine the definite molecular pattern of microorganisms residing in healthy endometrium. Some studies have found no lactobacilli in the reproductive tract of healthy, asymptomatic women, which may suggest that the dominance of lactobacilli over other microorganisms residing in the endometrium is not always associated with a condition indicative of abnormalities. Verstraelen and colleagues ( 11 Bifidobacteria Pseudomonas Acinetobacter Vagococcus Sphingobium 12 13 Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Cloacibacterium, and Comamonadaceae 14 Pseudomonas Propionilbacterium Streptococcus Moraxella 15 Klebsiella pneumoniae Clostridium botulinum Pasterurella multocida The reasons for the differences in the results obtained can be traced to physiological stimuli at the individual level, as well as technical ones, resulting from the methodology of the study. There are many factors, such as medical history, endocrine disorders, genetic conditions, age, ancestry or behavioral variables, that can directly and indirectly affect the composition of a patient’s microbiota. Studies have shown that the microbiome of women suffering from various types of reproductive disorders, such as endometriosis, endometrial cancer, polyps, or infertility, had a different composition than that observed in patients without similar abnormalities ( 30 31 32 33 34 35 3 36 37 38 Lactobacillus Lactobacillus Gardnerella Bifidobacterium 16 Bacteroidetes Proteobacteria Actinobacteria Firmicutes Lactobacillus 39 3 Maintaining endometrial eubiosis 3.1 Eubiosis – the microbial homeostasis It may seem impossible for the microorganisms to survive in this highly variable environment due to the menstrual cycle, but research clearly indicates that the endometrium has its own microbiota. Maintaining a balance between commensal bacteria and pathogens in this particular niche is essential for its healthy activity. Based on the studies of gut microbiota, in 2010, Hooper and Macpherson ( 40 41 One potential role of the endometrial microbiota is to modulate immune responses within the niche through several mechanisms, such as competition, receptor stimulation and modulation of epithelial barrier function. Both endometrial stroma cells and epithelial cells are equipped with several receptors that allow them to recognize foreign molecular patterns of pathogenic microorganisms. Recognition of foreign antigens leads to the activation of the inflammatory response, resulting in the secretion of a wide range of specific chemokines that are sensed by appropriate subsets of immune cells. They also stimulate the synthesis of PRR receptors. Moreover, commensal microorganisms restrict the pathogen invasion by depleting the environment of nutrients ( 42 30 43 44 3.2 URT as an immunologically suited niche The immune system plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis within the female URT, protecting it from pathogens and preventing pathological changes (  Figure 2  Table 1 45 Figure 2 Endometrial immune cells and their role in sustaining immunological homeostasis. The interaction between these cells plays a crucial role in maintaining a balanced immune environment, which is essential for both fertility and successful pregnancy. • Neutrophils secrete IL-1-9, which contributes to early inflammation and defense against pathogens while also influencing the recruitment of other immune cells to the site of infection or tissue injury. • Mast Cells: secrete trypsin and chymotrypsin, enzymes that participate in tissue remodeling and inflammatory responses. Their role is particularly important in regulating vascular permeability and mediating allergic or immune responses within the endometrium. • B cells within the endometrial immune microenvironment secrete IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, and GM-CSF. These cytokines play diverse roles, including modulating local immune responses, regulating inflammation, and supporting the survival and function of other immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells. • uNK cells are central to the endometrial immune response, secreting a variety of factors, including VEGF, PEGF, angiopoietin, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and GM-CSF. These cytokines and growth factors are crucial for angiogenesis, tissue remodeling, and activating other immune cells like macrophages and CD8+ T cells. • CD8+ T Cells secrete IFN-γ, TNF-α, perforins, granzymes, IL-4 and IL-12, participating in immune surveillance and destroying infected or altered cells. Their activation is modulated by uNK cells and other immune cells, contributing to the balance between defense and immune tolerance. • Macrophages of the endometrium secrete IL-1, IL-10, IL-15, prostaglandins, MCP-1 and IL-1β, which influence local inflammation, tissue repair, and the recruitment of other immune cells. Macrophages also act as key regulators of the immune response, being able to activate endothelial cells to produce HBD-2, an antimicrobial peptide that further contributes to local immune defense. • DCs expressing MHC-II play a crucial role in antigen presentation and the initiation of adaptive immune responses. Their interaction with T cells helps to shape the endometrial immune landscape, promoting tolerance or active immune defense depending on the tissue requirements. • CD4+ T cells grouped into four subtypes are pivotal in regulating immune responses: o Treg cells are induced when TGF-β levels in the environment are high; they secrete IL-10, IL-35 and TGF-β, ensuring immune tolerance and preventing excessive inflammation. ○ TH17 are being activated when TGF-β levels are low; TH17 cells secrete IL-17, playing a role in pro-inflammatory responses and the recruitment of neutrophils and other immune cells. ○ Th1 secrete IFN-γ, IL-2, TGF-α, and TGF-β. These cells are involved in promoting immune defense and activating macrophages to clear pathogens or damaged cells. ○ Th2 secrete IL-13, IL-10, and IL-4, promoting tissue repair and helping to modulate the immune response to avoid excessive inflammation, contributing to the maintenance of homeostasis.

It includes mast cells, neutrophils, CD8+ T cells, B cells, macrophages, uNK cells, CD4+ T cells, and DCs. Various cytokines and factors such as ILs, TNF-α, VEGF, and GM-CSF are shown, highlighting complex signaling pathways. Arrows indicate directions of influence among cells. Table 1 Immune cells crucial to function of endometrium. Immune cell type Abundance Functions uNK cells most abundant in endometrium low cytotoxicity, cytokines secretion (IFN-γ, TNF-α), production of proangiogenic factors (VEGF, PlGF) Macrophages ~10% of immune cells in endometrium phagocytosis, tissue remodeling, cytokine secretion (IL-10, MCP-1), promote implantation Dendritic Cells (DCs) ~10% of immune cells in endometrium antigen presentation, phagocytosis, activation of T-cells, regulation of mucosal immunity T Lymphocytes third most abundant cells in endometrium CD8+ (cytotoxic): induction of apoptosis, cytokines secretion; CD4+ (helper): coordination of immune response Neutrophils low abundance in endometrium, rises during menstruation tissue remodeling during menstrual cycle, cytokines secretion: IL-1-9, phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides synthesis Mast Cells low abundance in endometrium, near endometrial blood vessels proteases release (trypsin, chymotrypsin) for inflammatory responses, biological defense B Lymphocytes rare (1% of endometrial immune cells) cytokine secretion (IL-6, IL-10, IL-17), differentiationinto plasma cells 3.2.1 Uterine natural killer cells The most abundant immune cells residing in the endometrium are the uterine natural killer cells (uNK cells). The number of cells in the endometrium undergoes changes related to the menstrual cycle, increasing during the secretory phase. Also, the quantity of uNK cells rises in early pregnancy, representing up to 70% of all hematopoietic cells and gradually decreases in the middle and late gestation ( 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 55 3.2.2 Macrophages and dendritic cells Macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) represent the major antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the uterine environment, accounting for about 10% of all endometrial immune cells. APCs are one of the key elements activating the inflammatory response by the bacterial molecular pattern and presentation of their antigens to T lymphocytes ( 56 57 58 Macrophages are the most abundant group of endometrial APCs. Their physiological role in the endometrium is associated with tissue clearance and remodeling ( 59 60 61 50 3.2.3 Neutrophils Neutrophils’ presence in the endometrium increases innate immune defense thanks to the secretory capacity of IL 1-9, phagocytosis, production of oxidative compounds and release of antimicrobial peptides ( 62 3.2.4 Mast cells The main role of endometrial mast cells is related to biological defense mechanisms by releasing proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin to activate inflammation and the immune response ( 63 3.2.5 B and T lymphocytes In a healthy pre-menopausal endometrium, B cells are relatively rare, accounting for only 1% of immune cells. They participate in immune regulation by secreting a wide range of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, and GM-CSF, and they can differentiate into plasma cells when stimulated by antigens ( 64 65 The main role of cytotoxic T cells is to participate in the apoptosis of the target cell. CD8+ T cells can directly initiate apoptosis by secreting cytotoxic perforin proteins and granzymes or by integrating the FasL-CD95 ligand (FasR), resulting in the initiation of apoptosis through the activation of caspase proteases in the intruder cell. In addition to participating in indirect apoptosis, CD8+ T cells can kill target cells by releasing cytokines such as TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-12, which activate other immune cells in addition to affecting the target cell ( 66 67 68 CD4+ T cells represent a less abundant, however important, group of cells involved in the production of immune mediators and interaction with other immune cells upon activation by APCs. Th1 cells are responsible for the secretion of IFN‐γ, TNF‐β, IL‐2 and macrophage activation. Moreover, they also produce TNF-a, which is involved in promoting inflammation. Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13, which are mostly involved in humoral immunity and extracellular pathogen infection ( 69 70 71 72 3.3 Menstrual cycle – hormonal dynamics and reproductive function While the number of immune cells in individual parts of the URT is relatively constant, the number of cells in the uterus is sensitive to changes in sex hormone levels caused by the ovarian cycle. Cyclical hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle may affect immune responses, which is crucial for promoting endometrial receptivity, necessary for embryo implantation ( 46  Figure 3 in vitro 73 74 Figure 3 Hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle. The graph illustrates the dynamic changes in the level of key reproductive hormones across a typical ovulatory menstrual cycle. Created in BioRender. Kuźmycz, O. and Wierzbińska, W. (2025) https://BioRender.com/es82lve Line graph showing hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. Estrogen decreases until day 14, then rises. Progesterone peaks around day 21. LH spikes sharply at day 14. FSH shows a small peak around day 14. Ovulation occurs on day 14. Experimental studies have shown that the immune cell composition in the endometrium undergoes dynamic changes during the menstrual cycle, particularly during menstruation. Immune cells, including T-helper cells (CD4+ T cells), cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells), natural killer (NK) cells, and macrophages, fluctuate in response to hormonal changes. There is a marked infiltration of macrophages during menstruation, which play a key role in tissue remodeling and the clearance of apoptotic cells. Additionally, dendritic cells are involved in initiating immune responses and show dynamic changes in number and activation state throughout the menstrual cycle. These fluctuations of immune cells are tightly regulated by hormonal signals, primarily estrogen and progesterone, and contribute to maintaining immune homeostasis in the endometrium, which is essential for reproductive health. Both DCs and macrophages reach their peak number during the late secretory phase ( 75 62 76 63 3.4 TLRs as specific microbiological identifiers The survival of commensal microbiota within the endometrium is determined by the presence of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which enable the differentiation of pathogenic microorganisms from the physiological microbiota, thus strengthening the endometrial defense barrier. These receptors can be found on the surface of columnar cells lining the upper FRT and on immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils or NK cells ( 77 79 TLRs represent a group of trans-membrane receptors belonging to the family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). In their structure, one can differentiate an extracellular domain, a very short trans-membrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain. The extracellular domain is composed of leucine-rich repeats and is responsible for the binding of a well-defined ligand by a specific receptor. It plays a key role in recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as bacterial or viral nucleic acids, LPS, lipoproteins, or peptidoglycan ( 80 56 81 - ). 82 84 85 87 88 89 90 91 4 Dysbiosis in endometrial immunopathologies 4.1 Endometrial dysbiosis In a situation where the microbial load is too high or rich in representatives of certain taxa, excessive tissue destruction and immune stimulation can occur, leading to an imbalance of homeostasis between bacteria, which is dysbiosis. It is not known whether dysbiosis is a cause or an effect of the disease. However, there is no doubt that disorders within the composition of the endometrial microbiome are associated with the occurrence of abnormalities in the physiology of the female reproductive system ( 18 Disruption of the endometrial microbiota homeostasis may result in pathological conditions such as endometritis, defined as chronic inflammation caused by bacterial pathogens. Due to its asymptomatic course, it is an infrequently diagnosed condition that can be closely associated with recurrent implantation failure (RIF) or pregnancy loss. It is estimated that endometritis can affect up to 45% of infertile patients ( 92 93 Actinomyces Corynebacterium Enterococcus Fusobacterium Gardnerella Prevotella Propionibacterium Staphylococcus Streptococcus E. coli 94 4.2 Inflammation in the pathogenesis of EC Endometrial cancer is currently the most commonly diagnosed malignancy affecting women in developed countries, and an increasingly problematic gynecological cancer. It is estimated that there were nearly 400,000 new cases worldwide in 2018, and according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the incidence rate of this cancer, by 2040, will increase by up to more than 50% worldwide ( 95 Histologically, one can differentiate between 2 types of EC: estrogen-dependent (I type), which accounts for 10-20% of all cases, and non-estrogen-dependent (II type), which accounts for 80-90% ( 7 96 In 1863, the prominent German pathologist Rudolf Virchow observed the presence of lymphocytes in tumor tissues, which allowed him to hypothesize that chronic inflammation links to the onset of cancer. More than 150 years later, we dispose of evidence that enables us to confirm that his hypothesis was correct ( 97 98 99 Helicobacter pylori 100 101 Fusobacterium Fusobacterium mortiferum Fusobacterium nucleatum Fusobacterium necrophorum F. nucleatum 102 Porphyromonas 103 104 The link between chronic inflammation has so far also been demonstrated for endometrial cancer. The role of inflammation in EC was first pointed out by Modugno et al. ( 105 106 107 108 109 110 Dialister Bifidobacterium Prevotella Gardnerella Anaerococcus 4.3 TLRs and mediators of inflammation in the tumor progression Certain bacteria in the endometrial environment may play a key role in the initial stages of inflammation by inducing an excessive inflammatory response (  Figure 4 111 112 113 114 115 Figure 4 An excessive immune response of the tumor microenvironment caused by bacterial dysbiosis. The figure illustrates the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which bacterial dysbiosis contributes to the progression of endometrial cancer: (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) (G) (H) (I) https://BioRender.com/9rwu2yc Diagram illustrating the interaction of various cellular and molecular components in an inflammatory response. It includes elements like IL-1, IL-2, and other interleukins, NF-kB signaling, and factors like TGF-alpha, VEGF, and COX-2. Bacterial metabolites interact with TLRs, influencing reactive oxygen species production. Cells such as uNK cells, macrophages, and mast cells are shown interacting with these molecules, contributing to inflammation through pathways like arachidonic acid metabolism and cytokine release. Visual flow is depicted with arrows indicating directionality of interactions. Activated TLRs may also play a key role in angiogenesis by stimulating the secretion of VEGF, which promotes tumor vascularization. The presence of blood vessels enables significant tumor growth because of the nutrients and oxygen supplied. However, the vessels formed under the influence of VEGF are characterized by both functional and structural differences, compared to those found in healthy tissues. These differences result in increased hypoxia of the tumor-affected tissue. Hypoxia, in turn, stimulates further VEGF synthesis and tumor growth ( 116 117 Recognition of bacterial molecular patterns by TLR receptors may also result in overactivation of NF-κB. NF-κB is a protein complex involved in the synthesis of many pro-inflammatory cytokines, playing a key role in regulating the inflammatory response. However, the ability of the NF-κB factor to inhibit apoptosis, induce proliferation, and enhance angiogenesis suggests its important role in tumor progression ( 118 119 120 Cytokines are a diverse group of soluble proteins released mainly by cells of the immune system in response to infection, inflammation, or tissue damage. To date, the secretion of the cytokines IL-6, IL-17, as well as transcription of genes coding inflammatory factors such as IL-8 ( 121 122 123 124 125 126 Activation of TLR receptors, including TLR-2, also contributes to the induction of oxygen free radicals (ROS) ( 127 2- 2 2 - 128 129 130 131 132 G. vaginalis 121 133 140 141 4.4 Genome destabilization in EC immunopathogenesis Dysbiotic disorders within the endometrial microbiota and persistent chronic inflammation can also lead to the destabilization of the host genome. Chronic inflammation resulting from a disruption of microbial homeostasis within the endometrium provides an environment that promotes damage to the host’s genetic material. Metabolic changes resulting from mutations or damage to host DNA can result in cell cycle disruption, inhibition of apoptosis or stimulation of proliferation of malignant cells ( 142 143 144 2 144 145 Differences in the metabolism of cancer cells compared to unaltered tissue were demonstrated in 2017 by Altadill and colleagues ( 146 137 Firmicutes Proteobacteria Tenericutes Actinobacteria Bacteroidetes 147 5 Dysbiosis in EC 5.1 Endometrial dysbiosis in EC The correlation between endometrial dysbiosis and endometrial cancer is indicated by the results of studies from the last decade (  Figure 5 133 Atopobium vaginae Porphyromonas Figure 5 Findings indicating the potential role of pathogenic bacteria in the development of endometrial cancer over the past 10 years.

Research into the composition and function of microorganisms residing in various niches of the human body proved that the microbiota plays an extremely important role in our physiology. Particular importance in the proper functioning, but also in the pathogenesis of many diseases, has been attributed in recent years to gut microbiota ( 148 149 Balanced gut microbiota is composed of a diverse group of microorganisms belonging to 4 main phyla: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria Proteobacteria Bacteroidetes Firmicutes 150 151 152 153 154 The intestinal microbiota is also responsible for the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) - metabolites produced in the process of fermentation of dietary fibers, proteins, and other substrates. By lowering the intestinal pH, SCFAs promote the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria Clostridium Escherichia coli 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 161 162 163 164 165 166 96 167 168 169 170 5.3 Estrobolome in EC The gut microbiome, particularly a subset of microbial genes known as the estrobolome, plays a pivotal role in regulating estrogen metabolism. The estrobolome consists of microbial genes, products of which are capable of metabolizing estrogens, primarily through the enzymatic action of β-glucuronidase. Estrogens, predominantly produced by the ovaries and adipose tissue, circulate in the body, mostly in a conjugated form. In this state, they are bound to glucuronic acid or sulfate, which renders them inactive and unable to bind to estrogen receptors. However, the action of microbial enzymes, specifically β-glucuronidase, deconjugates these estrogens, releasing the free, bioactive form capable of binding to estrogen receptors located throughout various tissues, including the endometrium ( 157 In the gut, the microbiome influences the bioavailability of estrogen by modulating the process of conjugation and deconjugation. The estrobolome is, therefore, a key player in determining the balance of active estrogen in the body, with direct implications for hormonal regulation ( 161 171 144 Increased estrogen levels, whether due to endogenous sources like adipose tissue in obesity or hormonal therapies, can lead to endometrial hyperplasia, a precursor to endometrial carcinoma ( 172 161 162 173 114 174 Erysipelotrichaceae Bifidobacteriaceae 175 Lactobacillus 176 6 Conclusions Considering current research, the growing body of evidence suggests that microbial dysbiosis, both in the endometrial environment and in the gut, plays a critical role in the immunopathology of endometrial cancer. An excessive load of pathogenic microorganisms can trigger a cascade of inflammatory responses due to the activation of Toll-like receptors and the subsequent production of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and IL-8. This persistent inflammation contributes to an environment conducive to tumor progression, characterized by angiogenesis, oxidative stress, and DNA damage, which ultimately supports carcinogenesis. The upregulation of TLRs, NF-κB, and cyclooxygenase enzymes further highlights the importance of chronic inflammation in EC pathogenesis. Moreover, the gut microbiome’s impact on systemic inflammation and estrogen metabolism, particularly through the estrobolome, is a key link to EC development. Dysbiosis in the gut can disrupt the balance of microbial enzymes, such as β-glucuronidase, leading to the increased bioavailability of active estrogens. This hormonal imbalance, in combination with obesity-related factors, can drive endometrial hyperplasia and promote the initiation of cancer. The interaction between gut-derived metabolites, immune signaling, and estrogen regulation underscores the interconnectedness of the microbiota in shaping both immune responses and hormonal homeostasis, key factors in EC risk. All these arguments strongly support the importance of dysbiosis in the immunopathogenesis of EC. However, the available literature data on the role of EC microbiota in tumor initiation and progression features a wide variety of research protocols used and consequently, results obtained. Standardization of the research protocols would allow studies to be conducted with greater replicability and accuracy, which is crucial for understanding the role of microorganisms in the pathogenesis and progression of EC. More research is needed not only to identify the molecular basis of microbial activity in this niche but also to understand the mechanisms that regulate it. Restoring microbial balance in both the reproductive tract and the gut may provide a promising approach to modulate the inflammatory and hormonal environments that drive EC. Targeting microbial dysbiosis through diet, probiotics, or other microbiome-directed therapies could offer new avenues for the prevention and treatment of this hormonally driven malignancy. Further research into the specific microbial species involved, their mechanisms of action, and their influence on host metabolism and immune responses will be essential to developing such interventions. New possibilities and strategies for EC prevention and therapy support, as well as new diagnostic techniques, may also result from this knowledge.
