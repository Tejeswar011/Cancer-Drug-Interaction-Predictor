The goal is to identify robust radiomic features (RFs) with the highest percentage changes during treatment and examine their correlation with the administered dose. Methods Reproducible RFs were identified through a test-retest analysis using a cheese phantom. This study involved 20 male patients (10 PCa, 10 RCa). The left and right femoral H&N regions were segmented on MVCT images from the initial, middle, and final HT sessions. Absolute RF values and relative percentage changes were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Pearson correlation coefficient with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment (q < 0.05) was used to evaluate the relationship between altered RFs and the dose (Gy). Results The femoral H&N had the highest relative percentage changes (RPCs) for intensity-histogram (IH) and intensity-based (IB) RFs, respectively, with texture-based RFs providing insights into radiotherapy-induced changes. Strong correlations ( r r r r Conclusions Among robust RFs, the most highly correlated with dose alterations were IB, IH, and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-based RFs. The RFs at mid- and end-treatment varied with dose fractionation. Percentage changes in robust MVCT features during HT may serve as early markers.

Although many developments have focused on linear accelerators, the implementation of MC algorithms in treatment planning systems also provides valuable opportunities for tomotherapy systems, potentially improving dose calculation accuracy in regions prone to skeletal toxicity [ 7 Despite these advancements, radiation-induced late toxicity—particularly bone toxicity—remains a significant concern for patients receiving pelvic radiation therapy (RT), which can result from both direct and indirect effects of radiation on bone tissues [ 8 9 10 11 Treating fractures in irradiated bones presents significant challenges due to the increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Fractures resulting from RT often have a high rate of non-union [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 10 19 Recent developments in image analysis and biomarker research have led to the creation of advanced tools for diagnosing diseases, predicting outcomes, and managing treatments [ 20 19 21 22 25 26 Texture analysis (TA) is a mathematical approach that evaluates grayscale intensities and pixel locations within an image, allowing for the quantification of subtle image inhomogeneities that may be imperceptible to the naked eye. This method generates textural features (TF), which are derived from analysis-based methods [ 19 27 28 29 31 There is a notable research gap, as no studies have examined the changes in RFs in the femoral H&N regions during HT using treatment planning MVCT images. Beyond its role in patient positioning, MVCT provides a unique opportunity for real-time monitoring of bone changes during HT. Unlike conventional imaging, MVCT enables repeated acquisition throughout the treatment course without requiring additional imaging sessions, allowing for the dynamic assessment of bone structural alterations in response to radiation. To our knowledge, no prior studies have leveraged MVCT to track changes in the femoral H&N during HT, highlighting the novelty of this approach. Integrating MVCT-based monitoring with radiomic analysis may facilitate early detection of bone toxicity and provide a non-invasive biomarker for treatment adaptation. Specifically, this study aims to assess the changes in reproducible RFs of the femoral H&N in patients with PCa and RCa undergoing HT and to identify correlations between these changes and the administered radiation dose. Methods Study design and workflow implementation The study workflow, outlined in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Study workflow: (I) (II) I. Test-retest analysis using a cheese phantom for selection of robustness features To ensure robustness of feature identification, a cheese phantom was used for the test-retest analysis (Fig. 1 Cheese Phantom image acquisition A cylindrical TomoTherapy “cheese” phantom, also referred to as a tomo-phantom or Sun Nuclear Tomo-Phantom, was employed to extract RFs from various materials (Fig. 2 mm mm g/cm 3 ) g/cm 3 g/cm 3 g/cm 3 Two sets of test and retest MVCT images were acquired for the cheese phantom, with a 15-minute interval between scans involving setup changes. The MVCT protocol was consistent for both scans, employing the standard algorithm, normal pitch, and 4 mm  Fig. 2 (A) (B) Phantom image segmentation ROIs were manually delineated in the initial image and replicated in the second image to ensure consistency in the ROI for feature extraction, maintaining identical volume. These contours were segmented and visualized using different colors in the LIFEx package v7.4.0, as illustrated in Fig. 3 29  Fig. 3 ROIs highlighted in various colors corresponding to the bone plugs on the cheese phantom MVCT image in the LIFEx software Phantom image preprocessing After image segmentation and prior to feature extraction, image preprocessing was performed to homogenize the images, reduce noise, increase sensitivity, and normalize the intensities across the two images. This preprocessing was consistent for both images. The intensity rescaling method used was relative (ROI: min < > max), with image intensities discretized to 400 Gy levels and 10 size bins. Spatial resampling was conducted considering spacing X, Y, and Z to be 1 × 1 × 1 mm 3 Phantom image feature extraction After delineation of the ROI, a total of 94 RFs were extracted for each region. These RFs were classified into first-order and second-order categories. First-order features were further divided into intensity-based (IB) and intensity-histogram (IH) RFs. IB features were derived from the intensity values, while IH features are statistical features derived from histograms of the intensity values. Second-order features, also known as textural features, are calculated based on the spatial relationships between voxels. These features are further classified into four categories: gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray-level run length matrix (GLRLM), and neighboring gray-tone difference matrix (NGTDM) features. Phantom statistical analysis Following feature extraction, the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was computed based on the two sets of images. Features with a CCC of less than 0.9 were considered non-repeatable and excluded from further analysis [ 32 34 II. Reproducible feature-dose analysis in patients with prostate and rectal cancers After acquiring reproducible RFs based on the cheese phantom test-retest analysis in the previous section, the next main step, according to Fig. 1 Patient data collection From January 2019 to December 2022, a retrospective selection of 20 patients at our institution was conducted, including 10 with PCa and 10 with RCa. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Iran University of Medical Sciences under ethics approval number IR.IUMS.FMD.REC.1401.387. Additionally, the Institutional Review Board approved the authorization for this retrospective analysis. All relevant clinical data and dosimetric information from the patient’s medical records were collected for the present study. MVCT images from the initial, middle, and final sessions were collected. Patients were included based on the visibility of the entire femoral H&N in their MVCT scans. Moreover, patients with metallic prostheses were excluded because artifacts from these implants can interfere with the accurate delineation of the femoral H&N and affect radiomic feature extraction. None of the patients with PCa received chemotherapy as part of their treatment regimen. In contrast, patients with RCa underwent chemotherapy with Capecitabine (150 and 500 mg/m² Radiotherapy was administered using a tomotherapy linear accelerator (Radixact X9) with 6 MeV Radiation dose data for the patients were obtained from the dose-volume histogram (DVH) values in the radiotherapy plan report. While the doses for the left and right femur differ, they are identical for the H&N on each side. Patient image segmentation An experienced radiologist manually delineated four regions, including the right and left femoral sections of both H&N, on the transaxial slices of initial, middle, and final MVCT images of HT sessions using the LIFEx package V7.4.0 [ 29 4  Fig. 4 Segmentation of a PCa patient: (A) (B) (C) Patient image preprocessing Following the manual segmentation, image pre-processing was conducted using the LIFEx package v7.4.0 [ 29 Patient feature extraction After preprocessing the MVCT images of PCa and RCa patients undergoing HT, the same set of RFs was extracted as those acquired from the MVCT images of the cheese phantom. The robust features derived from the test-retest exam were analyzed. Consequently, only the stable features from the initial, middle, and final session MVCTs were retained for further analysis. The RFs were extracted in six different conditions: (1–3) absolute RFs from the MVCT images of initial, middle, and final treatments, and (4–6) three sets of relative RFs based on changes from MVCT images of initial to middle treatments, initial to final treatments, and middle to final treatments. These features are labeled with _0, _1, _2, _01, _02, and _12 at the end of the feature name to ensure distinct identifiers, respectively. Patient statistical analysis Initially, the normality of the data was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test to determine whether to use Pearson correlation or Spearman rank correlation analysis. To identify meaningful differences among features from three time points: the initial, middle, and final sessions, a repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using SPSS software v26.0. A p-value of less than 0.05 is considered statistically significant, indicating that there is likely a difference between the various treatment time points. Relative percentage change (RPC) was calculated as the difference between the mean of the second measurement and the mean of the first measurement, relative to the mean of the first measurement (_02 RFs) as the most prominent set of relative RFs compared to _01 and _12 RFs. The RPC analysis was conducted for four regions—left femur head, left femur neck, right femur head, and right femur neck —across patients with PCa and RCa during HT. Moreover, the Pearson correlation coefficient, followed by Benjamini and Hochberg p-value correction, was calculated between both absolute and relative RFs, and the administered dose from the final session, considering q-value < 0.05 was significant. This dose is approximately twice that of the middle session, making any subsequent analysis consistent whether the dose from the final or middle session is used. Results Phantom statistical analysis Out of the 94 extracted features, 73 were identified as robust based on their CCC (greater than 0.95) during the analysis of bone plugs (see Supplementary Table 1 Patient statistical analysis: relative percentage changes Tables 1 2  Table 1 Features (Bold letters) with the relative changes in pca.

This highlights the significance of these features in their respective regions. In RCa patients (Table 2 In RCa, alterations were observed in IB, GLCM, and GLRLM features in the neck regions. Conversely, IH, GLCM, GLRLM, and NGTDM features exhibited changes in the femoral head. This underscores the relevance of these features in their specific anatomical locations. Patient statistical analysis: repeated measure ANOVA Tables 3 4 3 In RCa, significant alterations in IB features were observed across the femoral H&N regions. IH RFs displayed substantial variations only in the femoral right neck. No significant alterations were detected in the IH RFs of the femoral head. GLCM features showed significant differences in the right femoral head, specifically in Joint Average and Sum Average. No significant changes were noted in the GLRLM and NGTDM categories across any regions.

Additionally, the test-retest cheese phantom was utilized to identify RFs that are consistent and reliable across multiple scans under identical conditions. High reproducibility in these features strengthens their potential to enhance radiomic models, improving diagnostic accuracy, prognostic evaluation, and treatment response in clinical practice. Radiomics offers a quantitative and objective approach to enhancing cancer detection and treatment decisions [ 35 36 By extracting detailed information from medical images and integrating it with clinical, genomic, and other data, radiomics can identify biomarkers crucial for diagnosis and therapy [ 24 35 36 26 37 38 38 39 1 2 Moreover, the GLRLM category in Tables 1 2 5 7 8 While there is no study specifically utilizing MVCT images to evaluate RFs of the femoral H&N, the literature includes a few similar studies investigating RF changes in bone due to radiation. These studies, although employing different methodologies and designs, share the common goal of assessing radiation-induced alterations in bone. Abdollahi et al. [ 2 2 1 Hayar et al. [ 3 3 40 40 Nardone et al. [ 19 19 In line with our findings, Ishikawa et al. [ 41 Similarly, Rydzewski et al. [ 21 According to Tables 3 4 3 4 Based on the repeated-measure ANOVA results detailed in Table 3 4 To further clarify the biological and structural meaning of the most informative radiomic features, we highlight the key RFs identified in our study. NGTDM_Complexity quantifies the variability in gray levels within a defined neighborhood and reflects how heterogeneous the local bone texture is; increases in this feature during treatment may indicate disrupted trabecular structure or altered bone microarchitecture. NGTDM_Strength measures the dominance of uniform gray levels across neighboring pixels, serving as an indicator of tissue uniformity; decreases in this feature suggest reduced homogeneity and possible early marrow changes. GLCM_Joint Maximum represents the highest frequency of co-occurring gray-level pairs, with higher values indicating repetitive or uniform texture patterns; variations in this feature during therapy may signal changes in trabecular density or mineralization patterns. First-order features from the IB and IH categories capture statistical characteristics of voxel intensities, such as mean, variance, and skewness, which are closely related to bone mineral content and microarchitecture. Observed changes in these features across treatment time points may reflect early bone marrow fat infiltration, decreased trabecular connectivity, or other dose-related structural alterations. Collectively, these features provide interpretable imaging biomarkers that link quantitative texture and intensity patterns with underlying radiotherapy-induced bone changes, supporting their potential utility for early detection of bone toxicity and fracture risk. One of the study objectives was to compare HU-based first-order RFs, which are derived from statistical measures of HU such as mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, with second-order texture features to determine which can detect changes earlier. ANOVA analysis indicated that the observed changes in both cancer types were primarily associated with IB_RFs and IH_RFs, suggesting that first-order categories are more sensitive to variations in imaging features across the treatment period. The greater number of significant changes in IB and IH features points to alterations in bone mineral content and microarchitecture, which could have clinical implications for the long-term management of bone health in cancer patients undergoing RT. Figures 5 6 This study uniquely leverages MVCT images to track radiotherapy-induced changes in the femoral H&N during HT. Unlike CT or MRI, which are typically acquired months after treatment and offer limited insights, MVCT images are readily available before and during HT as part of the treatment planning process, providing real-time data for ongoing assessment. Importantly, our study did not involve patients with fractures or bone complications; instead, it focused on monitoring RF changes across courses of HT to evaluate the feasibility of tracking radiation-induced alterations. Through test-retest analysis, reproducible RFs were identified, and subsequent ANOVA and RPC analyses revealed features that significantly change during therapy. Pearson correlation analysis was also employed to determine the relationship between RFs and the administered dose, further elucidating the dose-response dynamics. The systematic review by Berk [ 42 1 43 Strong negative correlations (approximately − 0.7) were found between changes in H&N RFs and dose (Gy) in PCa. In contrast, for RCa patients, significant correlations were observed with IB features, such as the IB Coefficient of Variation ( r r r While the current study uniquely demonstrates the feasibility of MVCT radiomics for real-time monitoring of bone changes during HT, it is important to consider the broader context of multimodality imaging [ 44 45 46 18 46 Beyond monitoring radiation-induced changes in the femoral H&N, MVCT-based radiomics has demonstrated prognostic potential in other clinical contexts. For example, a recent study in H&N squamous cell carcinoma showed that radiomic features extracted from MVCT images acquired during RT could stratify patients by overall survival, with predictive performance comparable to planning CT–based radiomics and superior to clinical factors alone [ 47 Despite the significance of our findings, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the small sample size limits generalizability, even when the robust features were applied, but future studies should include larger cohorts. Second, the absence of a detailed clinical history regarding bone health prevented us from comparing RFs between patients with healthy bones and those with bone complications. Establishing distinct patient groups based on bone health status in future research could provide insights into the differences between normal and compromised bone features. Third, patients with metallic prostheses were excluded because artifacts from these implants interfere with accurate delineation of the femoral H&N and can distort the gray-level intensities in MVCT images, potentially leading to unreliable radiomic feature extraction. The presence of prostheses could artificially alter texture and first-order features, introduce noise, and confound the assessment of radiation-induced bone changes, thereby affecting the robustness and reproducibility of the results. Future studies may explore artifact-reduction techniques or alternative imaging strategies to include patients with prostheses and expand the applicability of MVCT radiomics. Fourth, the single-center data collection limits the applicability of our results; multi-center studies would provide more generalizable insights. Fifth, while the CCC method was utilized for feature selection, more advanced methods could be employed in future research to enhance clinical relevance, potentially incorporating ML techniques for improved clinical applications. Sixth, one limitation of this study is the reliance on manual segmentation, which is time-consuming and subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. Future work could benefit from the integration of automated or semi-automated segmentation methods—particularly those based on deep learning—to enhance consistency, reduce labor intensity, and enable large-scale clinical application [ 48 50 51 52 Conclusions Of the 73 robust features extracted from MVCT images during tomotherapy, only 12—primarily from IB, IH, and GLCM categories—demonstrated strong correlations with dose-related changes in the femoral H&N. The alterations in features observed at mid-treatment and the end of treatment varied depending on dose fractionation and the time points analyzed. Moreover, percentage relative changes in robust features during tomotherapy have the potential to serve as non-invasive imaging biomarkers and early radiomic markers from MVCT images, offering promise for predicting future bone complications following radiotherapy. Specific features such as NGTDM_Complexity, NGTDM_Strength, and GLCM_Joint Maximum may provide valuable insights into radiotherapy-induced femoral H&N bone changes and further enlighten osseous pathologic processes. Early detection of structural changes may help mitigate the risk of fractures in patients with PCa and RCa following HT for future study.
