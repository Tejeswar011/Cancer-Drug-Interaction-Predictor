Despite genetic, nutritional, and management advances that have improved broiler productivity ( Basit et al., 2023 Bülbül et al., 2023 Javed et al., 2023 Dinasarki et al., 2024 Magnoli et al., 2024 Prebiotics, probiotics, and their combinations (synbiotics) are leading candidates to replace AGPs because they enhance gut health, immunity, and growth performance ( Atalla et al., 2023 Tangthirasunun et al., 2024 Devi and Mirnawati, 2023 Alqahtaani et al., 2024 Fathanah et al., 2024 Yu et al., 2024 Coniglio et al., 2023 A growing research focus is the interaction of these additives with gut-derived hormones such as ghrelin, a key regulator of feed intake, energy balance, and gastrointestinal motility ( Honda et al., 2017 Gilani et al., 2021 Liang-liang et al., 2023 Poher et al., 2018 Mahdavi et al., 2025 Gilani et al., 2021 Srifani et al., 2024 Mahdavi et al., 2025 This study therefore evaluated the effects of dietary mannan oligosaccharide, Bacillus clausii Materials and methods Broiler rearing and experimental treatments A total of 250 day-old broiler (Hubbard) chicks were obtained from a local commercial hatchery. Chicks with uniform body weight were carefully selected and randomly allocated into five treatment groups. Each group was further divided into five replicates, comprising 10 chicks per replicate. The birds were reared in floor pens with a 2-inch layer of clean, dry litter material, and each replicate was housed separately to avoid cross-contamination. During the first week of brooding, an initial temperature of 32–34°C was maintained using infrared heat lamps. The temperature was gradually reduced by 2–3°C per week to reach approximately 24°C by the end of the third week, in accordance with standard brooding protocols. Continuous lighting (24 hours) was provided during the first 3 days to help chicks adjust to the environment, followed by 23 hours of light and 1 hour of darkness throughout the remainder of the trial. Adequate ventilation and controlled environmental conditions were ensured in an open-sided poultry house to maintain bird comfort. All birds were fed diets formulated according to NRC (1994) recommendations, with a starter diet provided during the starter phase (1–10 days), a grower diet during the grower phase (11–28 days), and a finisher diet during the finisher phase (29–42 days) as shown in Table 1 Saccharomyces cerevisiae Bacillus clausii Table 1 Broiler diet formulations and nutrient composition ( National Research Council NRC 1994 Table 1: Ingredients (%) Starter (1–10 d) Grower (11–28 d) Finisher (29–42 d) Maize 52.00 55.00 60.00 Soybean meal (44 %) 38.00 35.00 30.00 Vegetable oil 2.50 3.00 3.50 Dicalcium phosphate 1.80 1.60 1.40 Limestone 1.00 1.00 1.00 DL-Methionine 0.25 0.20 0.15 L-Lysine HCl 0.20 0.15 0.10 Salt 0.30 0.30 0.30 Vitamin-mineral premix¹ 0.50 0.50 0.50 Total 100.00 100.00 100.00 Calculated chemical composition Nutrient Starter (1–10 d) Grower (11–28 d) Finisher (29–42 d) Metabolizable Energy (kcal/kg) 3000.00 3100.00 3200.00 Crude Protein (%) 22.00 20.00 18.00 Calcium (%) 1.00 0.90 0.85 Available Phosphorus (%) 0.45 0.40 0.35 Lysine (%) 1.20 1.05 0.90 Methionine + Cystine (%) 0.90 0.80 0.70 ¹Vitamin-mineral premix provides per kg of diet: Vitamin A (12,000 IU), D3 (2,000 IU), E (10 mg), K (3 mg), B1 (2 mg), B2 (6 mg), B6 (3 mg), B12 (0.02 mg), niacin (40 mg), folic acid (1 mg), pantothenic acid (10 mg), biotin (0.1 mg), choline chloride (500 mg), iron (60 mg), zinc (60 mg), manganese (60 mg), copper (5 mg), iodine (1 mg), selenium (0.2 mg). Feed and fresh drinking water were provided ad libitum Zootechnical parameters All performance indicators—including feed intake, water intake, body-weight gain, and feed conversion ratio (FCR)—were systematically recorded at the end of each production phase (starter: days 1–10, grower: days 11–28, and finisher: days 29–42) Antibody titers On day 30, 1 mL of blood was collected from 3 birds/replicate. Serum was separated and ND antibody titers were determined using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test, while IBD titers were assessed using ELISA. Using V-bottom 96-well plates, serum samples were serially diluted in PBS, mixed with 4 HA units of antigen, and incubated with RBC suspension. Absence of haemagglutination (pellet formation) indicated presence of antibodies. HI titer was recorded as the reciprocal of the highest dilution inhibiting haemagglutination, expressed as log₂X ( Khan et al., 2025 Immunoglobulin estimation Fifteen mL blood from sheep was collected in EDTA tubes, washed with PBS, and SRBCs were prepared at 0.25 % in PBS. At 21 days, birds were injected with 0.1 mL SRBCs. After 14 days, blood was collected, serum isolated, and antibody titers measured. A direct hemagglutination assay was used to measure total antibodies (IgM, IgA, IgG). Serum was heat-inactivated (56°C, 30 min), serially diluted in PBS-BSA, and mixed with 1 % SRBCs. Plates were incubated (37°C, 24 hrs), and titers read at 50 % agglutination. For IgM/IgG differentiation, serum was treated with 0.2 M 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME, 37°C, 30 min). Hemagglutination post-treatment indicated IgG; the difference from total titer represented IgM. Gut morphology and histological procedure At the end of the experimental period, feed was withdrawn overnight from selected birds. The birds were weighed and humanely euthanized by cervical dislocation in accordance with the AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals (2020) Mushtaq et al., 2025 Ghrelin gene expression analysis via RT-PCR Approximately 100 mg of broiler proventriculus and pancreas tissues were collected and homogenized in TRIzol reagent for total RNA extraction, following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA purity and concentration were measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (A260/A280 ratio), and integrity was confirmed on 1 % agarose gels. To eliminate potential genomic DNA contamination, RNA was treated with DNase I (Ambion DNA-free kit). Samples were stored at −80°C until further analysis. We validated three candidate mRNA reference genes—GAPDH, ACTB (β-actin), and RPL4—together with 18S rRNA. Expression stability across tissues and treatments was evaluated using geNorm and NormFinder, and the geometric mean of the two most stable genes (GAPDH and RPL4) was used for normalization. Reverse transcription was carried out using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific 0.5–1 µg of total RNA Quantitative PCR was performed on Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus initial denaturation at 95 C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 s and 61 C for 1 min. 90 % to 105 %. Ghrelin gene expression was normalized to the geometric mean of GAPDH and RPL4 and calculated using the 2^–ΔΔCt method.

These improvements were particularly evident in body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR), while feed intake was either unaffected or slightly reduced. Such outcomes suggest that the enhanced performance was not a result of increased feed consumption, but rather reflects improved nutrient absorption and energy partitioning toward muscle accretion Khan and Naz, 2013 This indicates that the birds utilized dietary nutrients more efficiently, which is a key economic advantage in commercial broiler production ( Dalbool et al., 2024 ; Habib et al., 2024 ). Ciptaan et al., 2024 Yu et al., 2024 Prebiotics, such as mannan-oligosaccharides, and probiotics, particularly Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium Obayomi et al., 2024 Khan et al., 2020 Gulzar et al., 2019 Obayomi et al., 2024 The present findings of increased villus height and villus-height–to–crypt-depth ratio strongly support this mechanism, demonstrating direct structural evidence of enhanced absorptive capacity. Khan and Naz, 2013 Consequently, a healthier gut not only facilitates better nutrient uptake but also limits the energy cost of immune activation by reducing pathogen load. In addition, synbiotics are known to upregulate the activity of digestive enzymes and nutrient transporter proteins, further enhancing the efficiency of nutrient assimilation ( Gulzar et al., 2019 this improved efficiency can reduce feed costs and lower nitrogen excretion, which is environmentally beneficial in intensive poultry systems. Methiwala et al., 2021 A possible contributing factor to the improved feed efficiency is the observed upregulation of ghrelin gene expression in the proventriculus of Combo-II birds ( Fig. 3 Mahdavi et al., 2025 Although feed intake did not increase, elevated ghrelin expression may stimulate growth hormone secretion and anabolic pathways, helping explain the superior weight gain despite stable intake. Gilani et al., 2021 The supplementation of prebiotics, probiotics, and their combinations plays a pivotal role in enhancing the immune function of broiler chickens through multiple, well-established mechanisms ( Adhikari and Kim, 2017 Akhter et al., 2023 Rashid et al., 2023b Rashid et al., 2023a Khan and Naz, 2013 Younas et al., 2025 Khan et al., 2020 Nguyen et al., 2024 The significantly higher antibody titers to ND and IBD observed here confirm that these pathways were activated, providing functional protection beyond vaccine responses. Adhikari and Kim, 2017 Prebiotics, such as mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS), further support immune health by selectively stimulating beneficial gut bacteria, especially Bifidobacteria Lactobacilli Khan et al., 2020 Khan and Naz, 2013 Younas et al., 2025 Adhikari and Kim, 2017 The near-zero mortality recorded in the synbiotic groups underscores the practical relevance of these immune benefits for flock health and farm profitability. When administered in combination, prebiotics and probiotics (i.e., as synbiotics) exert a synergistic effect, improving colonization of beneficial microbes and amplifying immune stimulation. This synergy likely accounts for the superior immune responses observed with full-dose combinations ( Adhikari and Kim, 2017 Yadav et al., 2022 Such coordinated innate–adaptive activation offers a non-antibiotic strategy for disease prevention, aligning with global efforts to reduce antimicrobial use in poultry production. Dietary supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics, and their combinations exerts significant influences on intestinal morphology, which is critical for nutrient absorption and gut health in broilers ( Wang et al., 2016 Khan and Naz, 2013 Adhikari and Kim, 2017 Khan and Naz, 2013 Our finding of a markedly higher VH:CD ratio in Combo-II birds provides histological confirmation of these processes. Prebiotics, such as fructo-oligosaccharides and mannan-oligosaccharides, selectively support the growth of beneficial bacteria like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, enhancing microbial balance and reducing intestinal inflammation ( Khan et al., 2020 Obayomi et al., 2024 Yadav and Jha, 2019 Da Silva et al., 2021 Tong et al., 2023 These structural enhancements explain the consistent improvements in FCR across all growth phases observed in our study. The significant upregulation of ghrelin gene expression in both the pancreas and proventriculus of broiler chickens following supplementation with prebiotics, probiotics, and particularly their combinations, reflects the modulatory impact of gut microbiota on neuroendocrine signaling pathways involved in energy homeostasis and appetite regulation ( Gilani et al., 2021 Dimaraki and, 2006 Gilani et al., 2021 Yu et al., 2024 Hamamah et al., 2023 These findings highlight a novel endocrine dimension of synbiotic action, linking gut microbiota changes to hormonal regulation of growth. Prebiotics, on the other hand, selectively stimulate the growth of commensal bacteria that ferment dietary fibers to produce SCFAs like butyrate and propionate ( Adhikari and Kim, 2017 Cani et al., 2013 Yu et al., 2024 Conclusion Full-dose combined supplementation of mannan-oligosaccharide (200 mg/kg feed) Bacillus clausii mL kg⁻¹ feed) greater body-weight gain and improved feed conversion ratio p Humoral immunity Intestinal histomorphology ghrelin gene expression in both pancreas and proventriculus was up-regulated Funding Not applicable Ethical statement This study was approved by the ethical committee of, the Department of Poultry Science, Faculty of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences, The University of Agriculture Peshawar, Pakistan under notification No. L- 452/AH/UAP dated 16/11/2022.
