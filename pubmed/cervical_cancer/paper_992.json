The process is referred to as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Cytokines and chemokines, which are inflammatory agents found in the carcinoma microenvironment, induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) changes in malignant cells. Evaluating the role of cytokines in EMT in breast carcinoma and investigating their potential therapeutic implications is the objective of this comprehensive research report. The following search criteria were applied to the Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases: “cytokines,” “the cytokines,” “chemokines,” “EMT,” “epithelial-mesenchymal transition or transformation,” “breast tumor,” “breast carcinoma,” and “breast cancer.” A body of research comprising 54 articles has demonstrated that a number of cytokines, including TNF-α, TGF-β, and IL-6, contribute to the promotion of EMT alterations in breast tumors. The epithelial markers E-cadherin and β-catenin were downregulated as a consequence of morphological changes induced by EMT; conversely, the mesenchymal markers N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin were upregulated. The EMT transforming factors (EMT-TF) TWIST/ZEB/SNAI1/SNAI2 were upregulated. Pharmaceuticals with the capacity to specifically target cytokines or their epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signalling pathways have the potential to significantly reduce treatment resistance, impede the progression of cancer, and prevent the recurrence of breast cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by cytokines is a factor in breast cancer progression and metastasis.

Simultaneously, the expression of mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), N-cadherin, and vimentin is upregulated, hence enhancing the cell’s ability to undergo movement and migration [ 6 7 8 7 Cytokines are tiny protein molecules that facilitate communication between cells and are essential for cell proliferation, differentiation, and the propagation of anti-inflammatory signals [ 9 10 11 12 1  Fig. 1 The illustration presented herein illustrates the metamorphosis of mammary epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells. Cytokines are essential in this process as they suppress the expression of epithelial genes inside the nucleus of mammary gland epithelium and stimulate the activation of mesenchymal genes. Consequently, the cells exhibit an increased expression of mesenchymal traits, which enhances the development of tumors and their spread to other parts of the body Objectives The objective of this study is to examine the potential impact of cytokines on breast tumors and what drives their clinical significance. This could be accomplished by the examination of the different connections between cytokines and indicators of EMT in breast carcinoma. For instance, it encompasses alterations in the morphology of cells, such as the disappearance of structures that facilitate adhesion between cells and the formation of a spindle-like shape. It also involves changes in the expression levels of proteins that serve as markers for epithelial cells (catenin/E-cadherin) and mesenchymal cells (vimentin/fibronectin/N-catenin), as well as the interaction with EMT-TFs, such as TWIST/SNAIL I/SNAIL II/ZEB. Furthermore, if the study includes it, the possible progression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) would be recorded because of its possible medicinal significance. Materials and procedures Methods and enrollment The registration number for the protocol that was created and submitted to PROSPERO is CRD42023417123. Criteria and requirements Criteria for inclusion  Enrolment in English proficiency studies during January of 2009 and September 2023. Investigations that encompass both human subjects and lineages of cancer cells. Developement of the empirical exploration. The emphasis is specifically directed at cytokines. Disease being studied: Breast cancer. Target variable: Emergency Medical Technician. Outcome measures: The cytokine-induced variations in mesenchymal morphology result in the acquisition of a spindle-like shape. This method also leads to the suppression of epithelial indicators, such as E-cadherin and catenin, while enhancing the levels of mesenchymal indicators, such as N-cadherin, vimentin, and fibronectin. Furthermore, the occurrence of EMT-TFs, including SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST, and ZEB, is correlated with these alterations. If the investigation demonstrates the involvement of the EMT pathways, we will place extra emphasis on exploring their potential therapeutic significance. Criteria for exclusion  Examine scholarly literature about the topic, however the whole text of the article is not accessible. The malignancy being investigated is not a kind of breast cancer. Studies looking at how breast tumors’ epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is affected by variables other than cytokines. Breast tumors do not address the involvement of cytokines in EMT. Information sources To identify the pertinent terms included in the abstracts and titles of the papers, searches were performed in the PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science. Methodology for search and selection The search criteria included the terms “cytokines,” “EMT” “epithelial mesenchymal transition or transformation,” and “breast cancer.” The precise search techniques may be found in the Supplementary Materials section. The identification of papers included in the specified databases was carried out by analyzing the titles and abstracts of publications published in English from January 2009 to November 2023. Following a comprehensive examination of the titles, any duplicative research were eliminated, and the abstracts of the remaining papers were assessed. Following this, written pieces of information or content that failed to meet the predetermined criteria for inclusion were excluded. Later on, comprehensive texts were obtained for the outstanding publications that have been included up to this point, based on the information supplied in their abstracts. The articles were subjected to a rigorous screening procedure to ascertain their pertinence and appropriateness for inclusion in the systematic review. This was performed to extract and amalgamate the pertinent data. The eligibility of each research was reviewed separately by two reviewers, Yian Chen and Haining Ding. The two reviewers scrutinized the Lists of articles that were included, and any disparities were resolved via deliberation with an unbiased third reviewer, Jiaqing Song. The article selection process adhered to the 2020 PRISMA requirements [ 13 2  Fig. 2 The above flowchart illustrates the systematic process of paper assessment, exclusion, inclusion, and investigation as outlined in the PRISMA 2020 standards [ 13 Extraction of information The information utilized in this review were obtained from each study through the independent efforts of two examiners, specifically Yian Chen and Haining Ding. The extracted data elements comprised the subsequent: the source population (e.g., human cells or cell lines), the cytokines and chemokines that were specifically investigated, the subtype of breast cancer under investigation, the laboratory assays employed, the influence of cytokines on EMT, and the EMT markers that were utilized. The extracted data elements also included the name of the primary author. Potential for bias in isolated research Two evaluators, specifically Yian Chen and Haining Ding, conducted separate assessments of the rigorousness of the methodology and substance of the research projects prior to selecting them for the review. Disagreements that may have arisen were efficiently managed via a deliberative procedure that included an unbiased third reviewer, identified as Jiaqing Song. The assessment of the studies that were incorporated centered on their compliance with ethical protocols and the procurement of necessary research resources. Results synthesis On the basis of the study subject matter, publications that met the specified criteria were categorized broadly as follows: animal samples, human tissue samples, and cell samples. After classifying the first three cancer categories, the pertinent discoveries from each research were taken from their corresponding results and discussion parts. The identified variations in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were used to categorize these results into clusters. The morphological alterations that accompany the epithelial-mesenchymal transition were the precise basis for the formation of the clusters. One aspect of this process entails a decrease in the levels of specific indicators associated with the transition between the two cell types, referred to as EMT, and a rise in the amount of other indicators, including vimentin, fibronectin, N-cadherin, or claudin, which are linked to the mesenchymal layer. Moreover, the clusters were identified based on the modification of components associated with EMT transcription, including SNAI1, SNAI2, TWIST, or ZEB. A narrative synthesis approach was used to get overall results for each cluster, following the categorization of changes in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) generated by cytokines into clusters of subgroups. Results Findings of the search and attributes of the publications A total of 1245 papers were published in English throughout the timeframe of January 2009 to November 2023. Recognition of these articles was predicated on their titles and abstracts, which were indexed in the aforementioned databases. Prior to conducting the screening process for duplicate records, a total of 242 studies were eliminated. Subsequently, 1003 studies were assessed using the information provided in their title and abstract, and out of these, a total of 797 papers were excluded from our evaluation owing to their lack of relevance to our search parameters. Out of the remaining 206 articles, 9 were just abstracts from conferences, while the rest were asked to provide full texts. As a result, none of the texts were comprehensive enough to be included. Subsequently, a total of 197 full text publications underwent scrutiny to determine their relevance and eligibility for inclusion in the systematic review. An additional 143 articles were eliminated due to their lack of direct relevance to our specific area of interest, or their failure to clearly establish a relationship between any cytokine and the occurrence of EMT alterations in breast cancer. In the end, a grand total of 54 articles were chosen for the specific task of extracting and combining data.

[ 26 Chuannan Fan 2022 China Human normal mammary epithelial cells: MCF 10 A ∙ Immunofluorescence ∙ Western blot TGF-β Breast cancer cells The expression levels of N-cadherin and Vimentin proteins, regulated by TGF-β, were increased in OVOL1-deficient MCF10-M2 cells. Pre-treating MCF10A-M2 cells with SB431542 inhibited the increase in expression of mesenchymal markers caused by the removal of OVOL1. OVOL1 acts as a suppressor of the TGF-β/SMAD pathway and prevents TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Researchers may investigate OVOL1 agonists that have improved selectivity as well as in vivo safety in order to offer medicinal advantages for individuals with tumours in the breast. [ 63 Carlos Juarez-Cruz, Juan 2022 Mexico Human normal mammary epithelial cells: MCF 10 A ∙ Immunofluorescence ∙ Western Blot Leptin Breast cancer cells Chronic administration of leptin results in a transition from a cylindrical to a spindle shape in cells. Furthermore, it leads to reduced levels of the E-cadherin protein, causing a shift in its localization away from cell junctions in MCF10A cells. Additionally, it induces alterations in the subcellular distribution of vimentin filaments in MCF10A epithelial cells. The prolonged exposure to high levels of leptin in the microenvironment of normal breast tissue can lead to changes in the normal mammary gland epithelium, potentially increasing the risk for women to develop more aggressive forms of breast cancer. [ 35 Bellavi Daniele 2022 Italy Human breast cancer cell line: MCF-7 ∙ Western blot IL-1β Breast cancer cells The Western blot examination demonstrated increased levels of N-cadherin and Vimentin, together with decreased level of E-cadherin, a marker for epithelial cells, after the administration of IL-1β ( p TET possesses the possibility to serve as a therapeutic treatment option as a druggable target in breast cancer, addressing the issues of progression and bone metastasis. [ 52 Stefania Livia Ciummo 2021 Italy Human BC cell lines: BCSC-105 and BCSC-608 ∙ Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy CXCL1 Breast cancer cells CXCL1 downregulated the levels of TWIST2 and SNAI2, while simultaneously upregulating the levels of BCSC of TWIST1, accompanied by a substantial drop in E-cadherin expression. Directing efforts towards inhibiting the CXCL1 signaling pathway and its related factors might be a beneficial approach to limit the BCSC population and improve the effectiveness of current immunotherapeutic methods in aggressive breast cancers. [ 14 Wan Hua 2021 China Mouse immortalized NMuMG breast epithelial cell line ∙ Western blot ∙ PCR (RT-qPCR) ∙ Immunofluorescence Staining TGF-β Animal breast cancer cells Following TGF-β treatment, N-cadherin and Vimentin expression increased concurrently with a decrease in E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, the transcription factor Slug, known to induce EMT, was upregulated. TGF-β as a therapeutic target for treatment of breast cancer. [ 40 Fang Deng 2021 China Human BC cell lines: MDA-MB-231 ∙ Western blot IL-8 Breast cancer cells By turning on the PI3K-Akt-MAPK pathways, IL-8 encourages the TNBCs’ migration and prevents the cellular cycle from progressing through the S phase. This coincides with by an increase in Cyclin B1 expression and a decrease in E-cadherin expression. Through the PI3K-Akt-MAPK signalling pathways, the overexpression of IL-8 promotes the migration and multiplication of TNBCs. Consequently, IL-8 has the potential to serve as an innovative therapeutic target for TNBC. [ 36 Lázaro García-Morales 2020 Mexico Human BC cell lines: MCF-7 ∙ Immunofluorescence ∙ Western blot IL-1β Breast cancer cells EMT was induced by binding of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1β to its receptor IL-1RI, which is found on non-invasive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. This binding activated the β-catenin/IL-1R signaling pathway. Cannabidiol (CBD) led to a rise in both the levels of mRNA as well as protein of β-catenin and E-cadherin. CBD could be an inducer of MET and could be very useful in cancer therapy, while malignant cells treated with CBD become sensitive to conventional cancer therapy. [ 44 Hyeon-Yeol Cho 2020 Korea Human BC cell lines: MCF-7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231 ∙ Immunofluorescence ∙ real-time PCR IL-6 Breast cancer cells While untreated cells remained spherical, those subjected to IL-6 treatment became longer and wider. Also, they showed that vimentin and N-cadherin were more highly expressed, but E-cadherin was significantly reduced. IL-6 has potential as an indicator or focused therapy towards the control of breast carcinoma. [ 15 Alec N Woosley 2019 USA Mouse immortalized NMuMG breast epithelial cell line ∙ Western blot TGF-β Cytology of breast cancer in animals The level of E-cadherin, which indicates the adherence of epithelial cells, decreased in NMuMG shSCR cells after a 24-hour exposure to TGFβ. Nevertheless, the level of E-cadherin in NMuMG shILEI cells remained unaltered under same circumstances. The expression levels of the mesenchymal markers N-adhesin andα-SMA in NMuMG and E1KD subpopulations exhibited a contrasting pattern to those of E-cadherin. The ILEI/LIFR complex is essential for preserving cancer stem cells in distant sites and may influence the shift from a dormant state to active metastasis. [ 50 Siyang Wen 2019 China Human BC cell lines: BT-549,HS578T ∙ Western blot IL-32 Breast cancer cells The expression of mesenchymal proteins, namely N-cadherin and waveform protein, is considerably upregulated by IL-32. However, the anti-IL-32 antibody inhibits mesenchymal marker expression.The effects of IL-32 are mediated by the IL32-integrin 3–p38 MAPK signalling pathway. This research presents a novel therapeutic approach for specifically targeting the stroma of breast cancer. [ 16 Li Wang 2019 China Human BC cell lines: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 ∙ Immunofluorescence TGF-β1 Breast cancer cells The presence of TGF-β1 caused a change in the physical appearance of the cells, transitioning them from an oval shape to a spindle shape. Furthermore, the presence of E-cadherin is diminished as a consequence of the reduction in intercellular adhesion at the level of genes and proteins. The results of the experimental analysis indicate that the levels of mesenchymal markers, such as N-cadherin and waveform proteins, is increased in MCF-7. TGF-β1 had a pivotal influence on the morphology, motility, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers of MCF-7. Concentrating on TGF-β1 signaling might be a feasible approach for the treatment of breast cancer. [ 27 Liu Li 2019 China Human BC cell lines: MDA-MB-231 ∙ Immunofluorescence ∙ Western blot TGF-β Breast cancer cells The cellular morphology of MDA-MB-231 became more spindle-shaped after being treated by TGF-β. Following treatment, Markers indicating the presence of waveform protein, fibronectin, and α-SMA exhibited increased expression at both the genetic and protein levels. Nonetheless, these alterations can be counteracted by T-96. Therapeutically, T-96 may be effective in inhibiting EMT induced by TGF-β in breast cancer. [ 42 Hongli Li 2019 China Human BC cell lines: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 ∙ Immunofluorescence ∙ Western blot IL-22 Breast cancer cells; Human breast tumour tissues. Vimentin expression was upregulated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cytoplasms in response to IL-22 stimulation, whereas E-cadherin levels were exclusively downregulated in MCF-7 cells. In the context of breast cancer cells, miR-486-5p inhibits IL-22-mediated EMT via the Dock1/NF-κB/Snail signalling pathway. This research provides novel insights into the metastasis of cells of breast cancer, potentially advancing the development of innovative strategies against breast cancer. [ 58 Eunmi Lee 2019 USA Human BC cell lines: MCF-7, ZR75-1-A20 ∙ qPCR ∙ Western blot TNF-α Breast cancer cells In response to TNF-α stimulation, the levels of Vimentin and Snail, which are indicators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), were elevated. In contrast, the expression levels of epithelial cell markers CLDN3 and E-cadherin were decreased. Targeting TNF-α signalling may provide a novel approach for treating breast cancer. [ 45 José Esparza-López 2019 Mexico Human BC cell lines: MBCDF, MBCD17 ∙ Western blot IL-6 Breast cancer cells IL-6 promotes EMT by downregulating the levels of E-cadherin and upregulating the levels of Vimentin and SNAIL. The process is reversed by adding MTF to IL-6 cells. MTF suppresses the growth and movement of cells generated by IL-6, offering a possible therapeutic approach for addressing the aggressive characteristics of breast cancer. [ 53 Neng Wang 2018 China Human BC cell lines: MDA-MB-231;MCF-7 ∙ Western blot ∙ Immunofluorescence analysis CXCL1 Breast cancer cells The levels of β-catenin, vimentin, and N-cadherin exhibited a substantial upregulation subsequent to CXCL1 treatment. Conversely, a progressive inhibition of E-cadherin expression was observed. CXCL1 serves as a biomarker for evaluating the future risk of malignancies and as a potential target for management in this ailment. [ 62 C-H Wang 2018 Taiwan Human BC cell lines: MDA-MB-231;MCF-7 ∙ Western blot Resistin Breast cancer cells Resistin stimulated the expression of transcription factors ZEB1, SNAI1, SNAI2, and TWIST1, which promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the mesenchymal marker vimentin. Additionally, It inhibited the expression of The protein ofE-cadherin in luminal-type breast carcinoma cells. Through activation of the TLR4/NF-κB/STAT3 signaling pathway, resistin causes breast cancer cells to develop mesenchymal phenotypes and stem-cell-like characteristics. This study presents definitive evidence of the implication of resistin in the progression of breast cancer. It showcases its role as one of the inaugural endogenous TLR4 ligands that are clinically relevant. As a result, several potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer therapy are discovered, along with their downstream impacts. [ 65 GE MA 2018 China Human BC cell lines: ZR-75-1; MCF-7 ∙ qPCR ∙ Western blot ∙ Immunoblotting CCL5 Breast cancer cells Administration of CCL5 led to increased levels of Vimentin expression in both MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells. However, it resulted in a decrease in the presentation of E-cadherin only in ZR-75-1 cells, but not in MCF-7 cells ( p An elevated level of plasma CCL5 can promote the EMT of carcinoma of the breast cells. Plasma CCL5 shows potential as a candidate to predict chemotherapy response in NCT of LABC. [ 17 Rong-Si Wu 2017 China Mouse immortalized NMuMG breast epithelial cell line ∙ Western blot ∙ Immunoblotting TGF-β Breast cancer cells TGF-β facilitated EMT via lowering the abundance of E-cadherin and elevating the levels of vimentin, fibronectin, and N-cadherin. Furthermore, it elevated the levels of a number of transcription factors and genes involved with EMT, such as Zeb1, Zeb2, Twist1, Twist2, and Snai2. In contrast, the impact caused by TGF-β was suppressed when OVOL2 levels were increased. This study presents a strategy to inhibit breast cancer invasion by restoring OVOL2 expression. [ 46 Xuan Sun 2017 China Human BC cell lines: T-47D ∙ Western blot IL-6 Breast cancer cells IL-6 caused a substantial rise in the phosphorylation of N-cadherin, Vimentin, Erk1/2, and Shp2. Additionally, it led to a notable reduction in E-cadherin expression. Through its tyrosine phosphorylation and phosphatase activity, Shp2 regulates the IL-6-induced EMT process. Both the phosphatase activity of Shp2 and its tyrosine phosphorylation are crucial for inducing EMT triggered by IL-6. [ 56 Bridgette F Peake 2017 USA Human BC cell lines: BT474, JIMT1, MDA-MB-231 ∙ Western blot ∙ PCR GDF15 Breast cancer cells The level of the epithelial marker E-cadherin was dramatically decreased in stable clones that overexpressed GDF15. Conversely, the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin, and FoxM1 was significantly elevated. In addition, the levels of activity of Snail, Zeb-1, and Slug showed an increase. The overexpression of GDF15 in breast tumours leads to the stimulation of the IGF-1R-FoxM1 pathway, which serves as a mechanism for aggression. This discovery offers a justification for doing preclinical assessments of therapies that simultaneously target IGF-1R and FoxM1. [ 41 Paola Ortiz-Montero 2017 Colombia Human BC cell lines: MCF-7 ∙ Western blot ∙ PCR IL-6, IL-8 Breast cancer cells The gene expression levels of ZEB1, TWIST-1, and TWIST-2 exhibited a consistent threefold increase in response to IL6, the concurrent administration of IL6, IL8, and TGF-β. Significantly, the most elevated levels were seen following IL8 therapy. IL-6 as targeted therapy. [ 55 Shun Li 2017 China Human BC cell lines: MCF-7 ∙ Western blot ∙ PCR MCP-1 Breast cancer cells After being treated with MCP-1, cells experienced a disruption in their cell-cell connections and exhibited an altered shape characteristic of non-cancerous epithelial cells. On the contrary, they exhibited elongated and spindle-shaped characteristics. In addition, the activation of MCP-1 resulted in significant elevations in the levels of Snails, fibronectin, and VIM, whereas the expression of the epithelial cell indicator E-cadherin fell. Furthermore, MCP-1 stimulated the MEK/ERK signalling pathways and increased cellular motility and invasion. Suppressing the transmission of MCP-1 signals has the potential to be used as a therapeutic approach for treating breast cancer. [ 66 Ziqi Zhang 2016 China The human BC cell lines: MDA-MB-231 ∙ Quantitative RT-PCR CCL25/CCR9 Breast cancer cells Activation of the CCL25/CCR9 pathway markedly increased the level of MMP-1 and marginally augmented levels of MMP-2 and MMP-11. These results support the evidence indicating that the stimulation of CCL25/CCR9 signalling resulted in a modest reduction in E-cadherin expression. CCL25/CCR9 presents a promising target for preventing metastasis of cancer. [ 59 Drenka Trivanović 2016 Serbia The human BC cell lines: MCF-7 ∙ Western blot ∙ Quantitative RT-PCR ∙ Immunoblotting IFN-γ/TNF-α Breast cancer cells The action of IFN-γ and TNF-α resulted in a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin as well as an upregulation of VIM and N-cadherin. Furthermore, it was shown that hASCs, which were pre-treated using IFN-γ and/or TNF-α, facilitated the occurrence of EMT in MCF-7 cells via the influence of TGF β1. The significance of the inflammatory carcinoma microenvironment in guiding human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) to acquire features that promote the growth of breast tumors. [ 18 M-F Pang 2016 Sweden The mouse BC cell lines: EpRas ∙ Immunofluorescence staining ∙ confocal imaging TGF-β1; CCR7/CCL21 Breast cancer cells The treatment with TGF-β1 resulted in a more noticeable EMT, as seen by enhanced cell elongation, inhibition of E-cadherin, and induction of VIM and Snail. During the process of EMT mediated by TGF-β, the study discovered that the modulation of CCR7 expression takes place. Furthermore, the act of inhibiting or suppressing CCR7 led to a reduction in the capacity of cells undergoing EMT to migrate towards CCL21 and lymphatic endothelial cells, as well as to disseminate throughout the lymphatic system. This study highlights the significance of TGF-β-induced EMT in beginning the specific movement of cancer cells into the lymph system by inducing characteristics associated with dendritic cells (DC). [ 19 Sensen Lin 2016 China Human BC cell lines: MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 ∙ Immunoblotting ∙ Western blot TGF-β1 Breast cancer cells Exposing carcinoma cells to TGF-β1 led to an inhibition in the level of E-cadherin as well as an upsurge in the level of vimentin, fibronectin, snail, and slug. MHP-1, a recently identified polysaccharide derived from Mortierella hepialid, has the ability to correct these alterations. In future cancer treatment, TGFβ-based therapy will be used. One should contemplate the employment of non-toxic agents such as MHP-1 in concert with present anti-cancer drugs. [ 39 Nizam Uddin 2015 Korea Human BC cell lines: MDA-MB-231 ∙ Western blot IL-1α, IL-8, Breast cancer cells PIM2 amplifies the stimulation of STAT3 by promoting the production of IL-1α as well as IL-8, hence augmenting the expression of vimentin and ZEB1. PIM2 regulates EMT and modulates the function of signalling molecules like IL-1a, IL-8, and STAT3. PIM2 has been found to be an intriguing treatment option for breast carcinoma, as shown by the presence of a positive feedback loop. [ 60 Yichun Qiao 2015 Sweden The human BC cell lines: BT549; Hs578T ∙ Western blot TNFα Breast cancer cells Administration of TNFα led to a significant decrease in the amount of E-cadherin protein expression, whereas concomitantly raising the quantities of N-cadherin and fibronectin protein expression. The expression of AP-1 in TNBC cells is triggered by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). This study uncovers a key mechanism that facilitates the metastasis of TNBC to distant sites in the body as a result of inflammation. Additionally, it identifies AP-1, ERK, Akt signalling, and ZEB2 as prospective targets for therapeutic intervention. These discoveries may assist in reversing EMT, a crucial mechanism that regulates the development of invasive capability. [ 20 Joel Johansson 2015 Sweden Mouse mammary EpRas tumor cells ∙ Western blot ∙ Immunofluorescence TGF-β1 Animal breast cancer cells The research revealed a slight decrease in a degree of E-cadherin and an elevation in the levels of vimentin in EpRas cells after treatment with TGF-β1. Furthermore, these cells underwent a transformation into an elongated, spindle-shaped structure. Cells with tumours develop EMT and acquire immune cell features as a result of TGF-1 stimulation. Elucidating the potential function of EMT in endowing malignant cells with characteristics that enhance their ability to migrate to distant locations. [ 33 Mohsin Bashir 2015 India Human BC cell lines: MCF-7; MDA-MB-231 ∙ Western blot ∙ Confocal microscope images activin-A Breast cancer cells Administration or excessive expression of activin-A results in a decrease in the synthesis of E-cadherin and an elevation in VIM and N-cadherin concentrations. Activin-A induces EMT, which stimulates invasion and also increases the creation of tumors and the spread of carcinoma of the breast to other parts of the body. Downregulation of activin-A can impede cancer progression by halting EMT. [ 51 Joanna Mucha 2014 Polan Canine mammary tumor cells: CMT-U309, CMT-U27 ∙Immunohistochemical analysis IL-28 Breast cancer cells The introduction of IL-28 resulted in a substantial upregulation of vimentin expression. Illiad-28/IL-28RA signaling promotes the migration and invasion of mammary tumors in canines. The canine model has the potential to be a suitable alternative to clinical studies that specifically investigate the impact of MDSC-targeting medicines on cells that are cancerous. One potential method to treating breast cancer is to target both IL-28/IL-28RA (IFN-∙) signalling pathways simultaneously. [ 21 FangFang Zhou 2014 China MCF-10 A ∙ Western blot ∙ Immunofluorescence TGF-β Breast cancer cells EMT is a phenomenon that is facilitated by TGF-β. This process involves the increased expression of N-cadherin and fibronection, as well as the decreased level of E-cadherin. NR4A1 expression has a direct association with changes in EMT markers induced by TGF-β, making it a significant enhancer for TGF-β-induced EMT. The research has revealed a unique way by which the microenvironment enhances migration and dissemination of cancerous breast cells. Currently, clinical studies have been launched for drugs targeting TGF-β with the goal of anti-cancer treatment. [ 22 Xu Han 2014 China Human BC cell lines: MDA-MB-231; MDA-MB-435 ∙ Western blot ∙ quantitative real-time PCR TGF-β1 Breast cancer cells Cancerous breast cells experience EMT, which involves varied alterations in their morphology. The observed alterations are associated with a reduction in the level of E-cadherin and an elevation in the level of vimentin. Furthermore, inhibiting miR-10b counteracted the EMT generated by TGF-β1 in cancerous breast cell populations. The study provides evidence of the involvement of miR-10b in the process of TGF-β1-induced EMT. MiR-10b has promise as a therapeutic target for treating breast cancer metastases. [ 64 N R West 2014 Canada Human BC cell lines: MCF7; T47D ∙ Western blot ∙ Immunofluorescence OSM/OSMR Breast cancer cells Both types of cells exhibited expression of snail and slug transcription factors after OSM treatment. Additionally, to varied degrees, fibronectin (FN1), FOXC1, and ZEB1 were stimulated. Curiously, MCF7 cells had a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin along with an increase in the synthesis of N-cadherin, however, this phenomenon was not seen in T47D cells. OSM and OSMR show promise as novel avenues for therapy for breast carcinoma. [ 67 Tammy Sobolik 2014 USA Human BC cell lines: MCF7 ∙ Western blot ∙ Immunofluorescence CXCR4 Breast cancer cells Upon activation of CXCR4, the genes ZEB-1, vimentin, and cadherin 11 were shown to be upregulated. Targeting the MAPK/PI3K pathways caused changes in cells cultured on regenerated basement membranes in three-dimensional settings. Concomitant administration of CXCR4 antagonists with MEK inhibitors, PI3K inhibitors, or CXCR2 inhibitors could deliver beneficial effects for cancerous breasts patients who have CXCR4 receptor expression. [ 57 Masanobu Tsubaki 2013 Japan The human BC cell lines: MCF7; The mice BC cell lines: 4T1 and NMuMG cells ∙ Quantitative real-time PCR RANKL/RANK Breast cancer cells Treatment with RANKL led to a decrease in the amounts of E-cadherin as well as an elevation in levels of VIM and N-cadherin. After being treated with RANKL, the levels of the EMT-TFs such as Snail and Twist were shown to be upregulated. The NF-κB signalling pathway is essential for promoting the development of EMT in both healthy mammalian epithelial cells and cancerous breast cells, especially when activated by RANKL. Dimethyl fumarate, a substance that inhibits NF-κB, successfully inhibited the development of EMT triggered by RANKL. The RANKL/RANK system promotes movement, infiltration, and spread of cancerous cells by triggering EMT. This has potential to be an advantageous and focused therapeutic alternative. [ 68 Matthew Aaron Thomas Sweede 2013 USA MCF10A ∙ Western blot ∙ Immunofluorescence MCP-1 Breast cancer cells MCP-1 induced a decrease in the staining about E-cadherin, β-catenin, and Integrin α6 near the protrusions in 3D-cultured MCF10A acini. Significantly, the pharmacologic antagonist PD98059 impeded MCP-1 mediated changes by obstructing Erk signaling. This study establishes a basis for future researchers to inquire about MCP-1 and other cytokines originating from adipose tissue in the initial stages of mammary carcinogenesis. [ 49 Jeong Su Park 2013 Korea The human BC cell lines: MCF7; MDA-MB-231 ∙ Western blot IL-32β Breast cancer cells Vimentin and slug expressions were upregulated in the cells overexpressing IL-32β but downregulated in the cells with IL-32β knockdown. The MCF-7 cells that were transfected with IL-32β exhibited a significant reduction in the quantity of E-cadherin as well as an elevation in the levels of VEGF. The activation of STAT3 is induced by VEGF activated by IL-32β, resulting in enhanced migration and aggression. Exploring the potential of inhibiting IL-32β signalling as a therapeutic approach for breast carcinoma. [ 23 Qian Liang 2013 New Zealand Normal human mammary epithelial cells: MCF-10 A ∙ Western blot TGF-β1 Breast cancer cells The MCF10A cells grown with TGF-β1 demonstrated a significant decrease in the amount of level of the epithelial marker E-cadherin. Concurrently, there was a substantial rise in the manifestation of the mesenchymal biomarkers α-SMA and N-cadherin. During the EMT induced by TGF-β1, the level of CDK5 and p35 proteins increased, resulting in a rise in CDK5 kinase activity. CDK5 is crucial in triggering the process of EMT caused by TGF-β1, TWIST, and SNAIL. CDK5 is very likely to have a substantial impact on the process of EMT during the migration and dissemination of cancerous cells in the breast. [ 37 Tal Leibovich-Rivkin 2013 Israel Normal human mammary epithelial cells: MCF-10 A ∙ Flow Cytometry ∙ Quantitative real-time PCR TNFα; IL-1β Breast cancer cells The levels of E-cadherin was reduced and the levels of VIM was elevated in MCF-10 A cells. Furthermore, Zeb1 and Snail were ultimately upregulated, whereas Twist expression was found to decrease concomitantly. Inhibiting the inflammatory microenvironment may impede the capacity of non-transformed cells to undergo plasticity, EMT, spreading, as well as invasion. [ 47 Guozhu Xie 2012 China The human BC cell lines: T47D ∙ Quantitative real-time PCR ∙ Immunofluorescence ∙ Western blot IL-6 Breast cancer cells Observations revealed that T47D cells underwent morphological alterations, shifting out of a pebble form to a spindle-like shape. Additionally, the suppression of E-cadherin expression was observed, accompanied by the simultaneous increase in vimentin and twist. EMT is essential in the formation of cancerous cells which have stem cell-like properties. IL-6 has significant promise as a viable option for treatment of cancer and for impeding the development of breast carcinoma. [ 24 Gianluca Turcatel 2012 USA The mice BC cell lines: 4T1 and NMuMG cells ∙ RT Real Time PCR TGF-β Breast cancer cells Upon exposure to TGF-β, mesenchymal NMUMG cells underwent morphological changes, adopting a spindle-like shape and reorganising their actin structure. Consequently, the result was a decline in the concentration of E-cadherin and a rise in the concentration of α-SMA. The upregulation of mir-99a and mir-99b led to a series of biochemical and behavioural alterations that suggest a partial EMT. The identification of the mTOR gene as a prominent target of mir-99b and mir-99a presents encouraging possibilities for its use in the medical treatment of cancer-related diseases. [ 28 Jinkyoung Kim 2012 Korea The human BC cell lines: MDA-MB-231; MCF-7 ∙ Immunofluorescence ∙ Western blot EGF Breast cancer cells EGF may upregulate the expressions of Snail, VIM, as well as fibronectin, whereas downregulating the transcription of E-cadherin, which triggers the onset of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MCF-7 cells. Following treatment with EGF, the cells underwent dispersion and experienced disruption in their intercellular connections, leading to the formation of elongated cell morphologies that resemble the fibroblast-like structures often seen in mesenchymal cell populations. The EGF-induced EMT in carcinoma of the mammary cells is mediated by the transmission pathway that involves ERK1/2-phospho-Smad2/3-Snail. The identification of the ERK1/2-phospho-Smad2/3-Snail signalling pathway could offer novel therapeutic targets for the advancement of therapies aimed at managing aggressive breast tumours. [ 29 Hung, Chao-Ming 2011 Taiwan The human BC cell lines: MCF-7 ∙ Western blot ∙ Confocal microscopy HGF Breast cancer cells Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) induced an increase in the level of VIM and a downregulation in the expression of E-cadherin in the cells. Osthole efficiently inhibited the EMT process induced by HGF by specifically obstructing the activation of the c-Met/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway. Osthole might be used as a therapeutic intervention to inhibit hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in breast cancer. [ 25 Michael K. Asiedu 2011 USA The mice BC cell lines: MMCs ∙ Immunoblot ∙ RT-PCR ∙ Flow Cytometry TGFβ;TNFα Breast cancer cells Malignant cells extracted from mammary glands (MMCs) obtained from tumours in neu-Tg mice exhibited a distinct alteration in cellular morphology, transitioning from a rounded to an elongated configuration, which is indicative of the phenomenon referred to as EMT. Extended exposure to TGFβ and TNFα resulted in a decrease in the level of E-cadherin expression and an increase in the level of N-cadherin, Snail, Twist, and Zeb1 expression. Exposure of tumour cells to TGFβ and TNFα triggers a chemical reaction known as EMT, resulting in the development of cells that exhibit a consistent phenotype characteristic of stem cells from breast carcinoma. This results in an improved capacity for self-regeneration. Exposing cells to cytokines could be used to generate long-lasting BCSCs outside of the body. This suggests that these cells might be valuable for identifying biomarkers and developing medicines that target stem cells in breast cancer. [ 48 N J Sullivan 2009 USA The human BC cell lines: MCF-7; BT474; T47D; ZR-75-1 ∙ Western blot ∙ Quantitative real-time PCR ∙ Immunofluorescence IL-6 Breast cancer cells IL-6 exposure led to a reduction in E-cadherin and concurrently led to an elevation in VIM, CDH2, Snail, and Twist. In addition, MCF-7 cells exhibited prominent cytoplasmic Vimentin intermediate filaments. Targeting IL-6 might be a viable approach for cancer treatment and to hinder the progression of breast cancer. [ 61 Tatsuyoshi Funasaka 2009 Japan The human BC cell lines: MBA-MD-231; Normal human mammary epithelial cells: MCF-10 A ∙ Western blot ∙ Immunofluorescence PGI/AMF Breast cancer cells PGI/AMF decreases E-cadherin levels as well as enhances ß-catenin expression, while also promoting Snail promoter activity. Control of PGI/AMF could potentially offer a novel opportunity for targeting latent micrometastases. Morphological alterations in mesenchymal cells The cellular morphology of cancerous breast cell lines undergoes a transformation from a pebble-like shape to a thin, elongated spindle-like form, referred to as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), after treatment with TGF-β [ 16 18 19 22 24 25 27 63 28 44 47 55 25 63 Suppression of epithelial markers Various studies have shown that cytokines cause a reduction in the function of genes and proteins linked to epithelium indicators, such as E-cadherin and β-catenin, during EMT in carcinoma of the breast. The expression of E-cadherin is reduced within cells of the breast after treatment with TGF-β [ 14 19 21 25 63 28 29 30 33 35 37 40 42 44 48 49 52 53 68 65 66 57 25 37 58 60 59 61 62 56 63 64 The level of the epithelial biomarker β-catenin is diminished in cancerous of the breast cells upon treatment with IL-1 [ 36 68 53 61 Increased expression of mesenchymal markers Multiple studies have shown a greater amount of mesenchymal biomarkers, including VIM, fibronectin, and N-cadherin, in cancer cells of breast or cell lines after treatment. Excessive expression has been seen at both the genomic and proteomic stages. The level of vimentin has been shown to enhanced under the exposure to TGF-β [ 14 16 19 22 26 27 63 28 30 29 33 35 37 39 42 44 48 39 49 50 53 51 55 65 67 57 37 58 59 62 56 63 It has been shown that N-cadherin is upregulated as a component of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) triggered by TGF-β [ 14 17 21 23 25 26 33 35 44 46 48 50 53 57 25 60 59 56 64 Fibronectin expression has been demonstrated to increase in response to TGF [ 17 19 21 27 28 55 60 64 When administered with TGF-β [ 15 23 24 27 Activation or Inhibition of EMT-TF As will be elucidated upon in the following section, transcription factors (TFs) implicated in emergency medical technician processes, such as Slug, have been demonstrated to manifest raised levels in lineages of breast cancer upon exposure to various cytokines. The expression of Snail2/Slug and SNAIL1/Snail has been shown to increase in response to TGF-β therapy [ 14 17 19 25 28 37 45 48 49 55 65 57 25 37 58 61 62 56 64 17 25 41 41 47 48 52 57 62 17 25 37 39 39 41 41 67 25 37 62 56 64 3 Experimentation on animals  Table 3 Attributes of the papers included in the systematic review.

The presence of increased levels of FGF16 in tumour samples, together with the stimulation of cell invasiveness and migration, confirms the cancer-causing properties of FGF16 in breast cancer. [ 43 Katara, Gajendra K 2020 USA Generation of IL-22−/−/PyMT mice ∙ PCR ∙ Western blot IL-22 Animal experimentation Deficiency in the IL-22 gene results in reduced production of EMT-TFs Snail-1, Snail-2, Zeb-1, MMP-3 and Twist-1. The results suggest which IL-22 promotes invasion through triggering the activation of the EMT pathway in breast tumours. IL-22 governs the aggressive conversion of malignant cells via the EMT pathway, which could also impact breast cancer aggression. [ 50 Siyang Wen 2019 China 4-week-old female nude mice ∙ Western blot ∙ IHC staining IL-32 Animal experimentation CAFs synthesize the IL32 protein, which specifically interacts with integrin β3 located on the surface of malignant cells of the breast. This interaction initiates the following initiation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, leading to an increase in the expression of mesenchymal markers such as fibronectin, VIM, and N-cadherin. This method promotes the aggressiveness of carcinoma cells in breast by expediting the process of EMT. The p38 MAPK signalling pathway has potential as a viable avenue for therapy for the management of cancers of the breast. [ 32 Michael W Pickup 2015 USA The established PyMT mouse model ∙ Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence BMP/BMPR1a Animal experiment action Eliminating BMPR1a in breast carcinomas leads to changes resembling EMT. The presence of EMT-TFs Snail, which is often associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), was identified in the tumour epithelium. Meanwhile, Slug had gained the ability to move freely outside of the cell’s core in cKO (conditional knockout) tumours. Furthermore, the cKO tumours exhibited a nuclear distribution of β-catenin and a distinct decrease in E-Cadherin, which was correlated with an increased mesenchymal phenotype. Further investigations are needed to explore the specific processes by which BMP receptors promote or restrict tumour growth in different cancer-related scenarios. Morphological alterations in mesenchymal cells The administration of FGF16 therapy [ 30 32 Suppression of mesenchymal markers A heightened level of vimentin expression was documented in response to FGF16 treatment [ 30 50 Overexpression of N-cadherin has been documented in the context of EMT induced by IL-32 [ 50 The overexpression of fibronection, an additional mesenchymal factor, has been documented in the context of EMT in response to IL-32 treatment [ 50 Activation or Inhibition of EMT-TF A decrease in Snail expression was documented in response to IL-22 treatment [ 43 32 43 4 Human body samples  Table 4 Attributes of the papers included in the systematic review. Humen Reference no. Author, year, location Research population/Cell line Methods Cytokines/Chemokine Object Results Clinical implication [ 54 Nie Gang 2021 China Clinical patient ∙ Western blot ∙ PCR CXCL8 The breast cancer tumor samples The tumour samples showed heightened levels of CXCL8 mRNA and protein, along with increased amounts of N-cadherin as well as VIM, and reduced expression of E-cadherin. The level of N-cadherin, VIM, and MMP9 was significantly decreased in mammary cancerous cells that were exposed to CXCL8 after being pre-treated with Danirixin. Nevertheless, the quantities of E-cadherin mRNA were replenished. Danirixin has promise as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of breast carcinoma by inhibiting the TAMs/CXCL8 modulatory pathway. This might potentially result in the eradication of BCSCs as well as a decrease within the migration of mammary tumors. [ 50 Siyang Wen 2019 China Clinical patient ∙ Western blot IL-32 Human breast tumour tissues and their corresponding normal breast tissues Mesenchymal proteins (N-cadherin and vimentin) were substantially upregulated by IL-32 in BT549 and Hs578T cells. In contrast, the action of anti-IL-32 antibodies suppressed the growth of mesenchymal indicators. IL-32 functioned via the IL32–integrin 3–p38 MAPK pathway. This work presents a novel potential treatment approach for concentrating on the stromal components of a mammary tumor. [ 18 M-F Pang 2016 Sweden Clinical patients ∙ Immunofluorescence staining ∙ confocal imaging TGF-β1; CCR7/CCL21 Human breast tumour tissues and their corresponding normal breast tissues Research has confirmed a correlation between the expression of CCR7 and CCL21 and the occurrence of EMT in human breast carcinoma. Tumour cells often exhibit diminished E-cadherin level and concomitant upregulation of CCR7 level during their invasion into adjacent tissue. An EMT profile is present when the mesenchymal-to-epithelial ratio in tumour samples exceeds 1. tumours exhibiting an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype show notably higher levels of CCR7 and CCL21 expression compared to tumours that do not. This work identified the induction of EMT by TGF-β as the mechanism responsible for initiating the directed migration of cancer cells via the lymphatic system. [ 31 Xiaoping Zhu 2015 USA Two independent clinical breast cohorts ( n n ∙ Western blot ∙ Quantitative RT-PCR CTGF Clinical breast cohorts The higher level of CTGF in aggressive mammary breast tumours demonstrated a direct association with the heightened level of mesenchymal markers fibronectin and VIM, as well as displaying an inverse relationship within the amount of epithelium marker E-cadherin. The CTGF-TNFR1-IκB autocrine signalling aided pathway. Therapies utilising drugs that specifically target CTGF, TNFR1, and IκB signalling pathways effectively prevented both the EMT process and the growth of cancer. [ 38 Gali Soria 2012 Israel Clinical patients ∙ Immunofluorescence ∙ Flow Cytometry TNFα; IL-1β Human breast tumour tissues and their corresponding normal breast tissues TNFα significantly induced a decrease in the level of E-cadherin at the cell membranes of the tumour cells. Furthermore, it has led to a substantial reduction in the presence of β-catenin on the cell membranes of the tumour cells. Simultaneously, the tumour cells have developed cellular protrusions, followed by significant reconfiguration of the actin cytoskeleton. IL-1β stimulation has resulted in decreased level of E-cadherin on the membrane of the plasma. This study present results provide further evidence to the major importance of TNFα in supporting breast malignancy, while strengthen the need to consider this cytokine as a therapeutic target in this disease. Morphological alterations in mesenchymal cells The movement of cell shape from a pebble morphology to a spindle-like, thin, extended form is considered a hallmark of EMT. This change was found in cells that were subjected to TNFα [ 38 Suppression of epithelial markers E-cadherin quantity was diminished upon administration of CXCL8 [ 54 18 31 38 38 β-catenin, which is a hallmark of epithelial cells, has been shown to decrease in cancerous cells of breast following treatment by TNF [ 38 Increased expression of mesenchymal markers A heightened level of vimentin expression was documented in response to CXCL8 treatment [ 54 31 N-cadherin, a mesenchymal markers, was upregulated with CXCL8 [ 54 50 Fibronection, another mesenchymal markers, was upregulated with CTGF [ 31 Before each research was included in the review, it was evaluated to see whether or not it adhered to ethical standards for the methodology, the materials it used, and its behavior. The evaluation did not include any studies that either failed to explicitly describe the active chemical that was being investigated or failed to clearly establish a particular EMT change that was the consequence of therapy with a specific cytokine in breast tumors. Due to the inability to assess the abstracts’ quality and adherence to the defined approach, they were excluded from the investigation. Key cytokine signaling pathways EMT is a crucial biological process during which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and adhesion properties, gaining migratory and invasive capabilities typical of mesenchymal cells. This process is highly relevant in cancer progression, including breast cancer, where it contributes to metastasis and therapeutic resistance. Several cytokine signaling pathways play pivotal roles in regulating EMT. TGF-β Signaling Pathway. TGF-β is a major inducer of EMT. TGF-β binds to its receptors, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of Smad2/3 proteins [ 69 70 IL-6/STAT3 Signaling Pathway. IL-6 activates the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. IL-6 binds to its receptor IL-6R, triggering the JAK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 [ 71 72 CXCL12/CXCR4 Signaling Pathway. CXCL12 binds to its receptor CXCR4, activating downstream signaling cascades such as PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways [ 73 IL-8 Signaling Pathway. IL-8 interacts with its receptors, CXCR1 and CXCR2, initiating signaling pathways that involve PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK. IL-8 signaling promotes EMT by upregulating transcription factors like Snail and Slug, which suppress epithelial characteristics and enhance mesenchymal features [ 74 The cytokine signaling pathways, including TGF-β, IL-6/STAT3, TNF-α/NF-κB, CXCL12/CXCR4, and IL-8, play significant roles in the regulation of EMT in breast cancer. These pathways interact intricately with EMT-inducing transcription factors, modulating the phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells. Understanding these pathways provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of metastasis and therapeutic resistance in breast cancer, particularly in the context of triple-negative breast cancer. Tumor-stroma inflammation network that promotes pro-metastatic states [ 75 4  Fig. 4 Tumor-stroma inflammation network Targeted Pharmacological inhibitors Recent advances in targeted therapies have shown promise in inhibiting the EMT process and consequently, the progression and metastasis of breast cancer. Various pharmacological inhibitors have been developed to target key cytokines and their signaling pathways. These inhibitors can potentially reduce treatment resistance and prevent recurrence of breast cancer. For instance, TGF-β inhibitors: Drugs such as Galunisertib (LY2157299) inhibit the TGF-β signaling pathway, preventing the induction of EMT and metastasis [ 76 77 78 79 80 81 5  Fig. 5 Targeted pharmacological inhibitors Discussion This systematic review comprises an extensive collection of studies that examined the effects of cytokines on EMT in breast cancer by utilising human tissues or cell lines from various origins. Determining the correlation between cytokines and EMT was the aim of this study. This study represents the inaugural comprehensive investigation into the effects of cytokines on extracellular Matrix formation in breast carcinoma. The objective of this research is to compile all pertinent English language articles that have been authored and published on this issue over the last 15 years. Researches have demonstrated that different cytokines like TGF-β, TNF-α, interleukin-1, FGF, HGF, and IFN, have a significant impact on the EMT process in breast carcinoma. Specifically, these cytokines play a crucial role in promoting transformation of epithelium cells into mesenchymal cells, a process known as EMT. This alteration leads to the inhibition of certain proteins that are distinctive of cells of the epithelium, like E-cadherin and β-catenin. Detectable levels of mesenchymal markers, like waveform proteins, N-adhesins, fibronectin, as well as α-SMA, have shown an increase. In addition, cytokines triggered alterations in blood concentrations of transcription factors (TFs) implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Involvement of cytokines might explain the observed variances. For instance, the gene Zeb1 is often increased in expression to facilitate the process of EMT. Slug, Snail, and Twist demonstrate alterations that facilitate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In addition, Twist also exhibits changes. At present, the role of cytokines in EMT in other tumors has been reported, such as cancer of the ovaries [ 82 82 83 84 85 86 Advantages and constraints of our analysis A significant benefit of our study Lies in its exhaustive examination of English-language studies conducted over the last 15 years. The platform used aims to elucidate the influence of cytokines/coagulation factors on EMT in different types of mammary tumours. The investigations used human tissues or breast cancer lineages of cells, and the origins of these tissues, cellular lines, and chemicals were properly documented. In addition, detailed elucidations were given for research methodologies such as immunoblotting, immunofluorescence analysis and PCR. Studies are constrained by the absence of consistency in the cell types, tissues, animals, and experimental procedures used in the papers. Several studies utilized tissues from humans, while others used lines of cancer cells, and a few utilized both. In addition, the systematic evaluations included experiments that used cell lines originating from various sources. Due to the diverse array of sources, processes, and treatment settings, it was not feasible to use a single statistical test to amalgamate the data. Therefore, statistical tests were not used. Additional suggestions for further research Additional research is necessary to determine the involvement of EMT in the development of treatment resistance in breast carcinoma. Further research is necessary to determine the effectiveness of specifically targeting certain kinds of cytokines or their inhibitory molecules in combination with epithelial-mesenchymal transition targets and EMT-TFs to stop cancer growth or overcome treatment resistance. Conclusion This systematic review includes several studies that used diverse cell types or human tissues from various origins to investigate the influence of cytokines on EMT in breast cancer. This work represents the first and comprehensive investigation of the influence of cytokines on the phenomenon of EMT in breast carcinoma. This website contains a comprehensive collection of all relevant written in English publications on this topic that have been published in the fifteen years prior to this one. Further investigation is necessary to get a thorough comprehension of the role of cytokines in the EMT pathway in breast carcinoma, since current research are inadequate. Given the critical importance of EMT in cancer progression, it is possible to develop targeted therapeutic approaches that specifically target these cytokines or the signalling pathways that occur before and during EMT. Acquiring a thorough comprehension of the specific function of cytokines and their signaling pathways in initiating EMT in distinct subtypes of breast carcinoma and developing innovative targeted therapeutic strategies has the capacity to hinder the spread or metastasis of tumours, reduce the likelihood of cancer malignant recur counteract or hinder resistance to drugs in these malignancies, and greatly improve the effectiveness of current chemotherapy and alternative treatments.
