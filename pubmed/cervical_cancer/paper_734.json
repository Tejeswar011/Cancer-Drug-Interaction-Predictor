Given the lack of evidence-based methods for diagnosing and assessing fibromyalgia, it ranks among the most difficult chronic pain conditions to treat. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) can inhibit acute and chronic pain transmission by inhibiting neuronal ion channels. Methods: Here, we aimed to explore the analgesic efficacy and mechanism of PD-L1/PD1 in an intermittent cold stress-induced fibromyalgia pain mouse model.

Introduction The prevalence of fibromyalgia pain is predicted to increase owing to the lack of medicines for this symptom, as well as its underlying cause. Fibromyalgia is particularly challenging to treat because the cause of pain is difficult to identify due to incorrect diagnoses, complex symptomatology, and a lack of meaningful biomarkers. So far, there has been no standard therapy or alternative treatments established to help fibromyalgia patients [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), also known as CD274, regulates cellular immune responses in dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and endothelial cells. It is present in tumor cell membranes and can bind to the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expressed in T cells. Accordingly, PD-L1/PD-1 signaling modulates immune function within the tumor microenvironment [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 The communication between neurons and glial cells (mainly microglia (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1, Iba1-positive) and astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP-positive)) in pain signaling is crucial for the development of chronic pain. In case of injury or pathophysiological situations, overactivated microglia, which are considered proinflammatory M1 cells, can further increase the levels of inflammatory cytokines such as ILs, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and chemokines to initiate allodynia and hyperalgesia and cause chronic pain [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 Acupuncture, an ancient form of Chinese medicine, was first used in Asia over 3 thousand years ago for disease treatment, and especially pain management. Given its well-known therapeutic effect as well as minimal side effects, acupuncture is practiced around the world to treat back and dental pain, headaches, tennis elbow, and fibromyalgia. Modern acupuncture involves inserting a very fine steel needle into a specific point on the body called an acupoint; when performed manually, the needle is lifted and rotated to ensure the occurrence of the de-qi, suggesting successful manipulation. Electroacupuncture (EA) is reported to be therapeutically effective and yield consistent results. A recent double-blinded, randomized controlled trial demonstrated that acupuncture could relieve chronic pain and major depressive disorder [ 22 23 24 25 26 26 The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether EA could reduce pain associated with fibromyalgia in mice. Our hypothesis was that EA could significantly relieve fibromyalgia pain via PD-1 signaling. We also aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of EA’s alleviation of fibromyalgia pain in detail. We found an association between PD-L1/PD-1 present on microglia/astrocytes and TLR4 and its allied signaling pathways in a mouse model of intermittent cold stress (ICS)-induced fibromyalgia pain. These phenomena were found in mice receiving EA treatment or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) PD-L1 injection. Our results provide novel insights into the relationship between EA analgesia and the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Mice and Fibromyalgia Pain Model The experimental mice were 8–12-week-old female C57BL/6 wild-type mice (18–20 g) bought from BioLasc Taiwan, Ltd. (Yilan, Taiwan). We used female mice to reflect the higher prevalence of fibromyalgia pain in females than in males in humans. After arrival, the mice were placed in a home cage under a 12 h light/dark cycle (light 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.). The temperature was maintained at 25 °C with 60% moisture. The experiments were approved by the Institute of Animal Care and Use Committee of China Medical University (Permit no. CMUI-ACUC-2021-336), Taiwan, according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal s 27 2.2. Electroacupuncture After being anesthetized with 5% isoflurane for induction, the mice were given 1% isoflurane for maintenance via a head-stuffed tube for inhalation. A pair of 1” acupuncture needles (32G, Yu Kuang Chem. Ind. Corp., Tainan City, Taiwan) was implanted bilaterally into the ST36 acupoint. The ST36 acupoint in mice is 3–4 mm below the patella, between the fibula and tibia, and on the anterior side of the anterior tibial muscle. The acupoint was electrically stimulated with a constant square pulse with 1 mA intensity, 2 Hz frequency, and 100 μs width for 20 min from a Trio 300 stimulator (Ito, Tokyo, Japan). The EA treatment sessions were conducted on day 3 and day 4. 2.3. Monitoring of Nociceptive Behavior In separate Plexiglas boxes perforated overhead, the mice were placed on elevated horizontal wire mesh stands and covered with a dark cloth for 30 min before starting the behavioral test. The environment was kept silent, and room temperature was maintained (25 °C), allowing the mice to habituate. The experiments were only conducted when the mice were calm, with all of their feet placed on a surface, and when they were not grooming or sleeping. A von Frey filament measuring instrument (23924 Victory Blvd., Woodland Hills, CA, USA) was pressed onto the center of the right plantar hind paw of the mice. The maximum pressure was achieved when the right hind paw was lifted using the plastic tip and the mouse reflexively withdrew the hind paw. We allowed for 3 min breaks between stimuli. The results were recorded as mechanical sensitivity. Hargreaves’ test was used for measuring the mice’s thermal sensitivity, and the setup was similar to that used for the von Frey test. The subjects were placed in an animal enclosure that separated the mice to limit interaction and was covered with a dark cloth. After allowing 30 min of habituation, the experiments were initiated. The IITC Plantar Analgesia Meter (23924 Victory Blvd., Woodland Hills, CA, USA) was used to measure the withdrawal latency time of the mice when subjected to radiant heat applied to the center of their right hind paws. A cut-off time of 20 s was set to prevent tissue damage. In the thermal paw withdrawal test, the nociception threshold was assessed using the latency of paw withdrawal upon stimulus and was recorded when the heat applied caused the subject to withdraw its hind paw. 2.4. Western Blot Analysis The mice were euthanized with 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital, followed by cervical dislocation. The total lumbar part 3–5 of DRG, lumbar dorsal horn of SC, thalamus, SSC, and CB5-7 of the mice were excised to extract proteins. Tissues were placed on ice and stored at −80 °C until protein extraction. Protein extracts were prepared; then, 10% radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer assay (Fivephoton Biochemicals, San Diego, CA, USA, RIPA-50), 100 μL of a protease inhibitor (FC0070-0001, Bionovas, No. 194 Kingsdale Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada), and 100 μL of phosphatase inhibitor (FC0050-0001, Bionovas, No. 194 Kingsdale Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada) were added to the lysate. After homogenization, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C in an adjustable centrifuge. A total of 10 μL of extracted tissue sample was subjected to 8% or 12% SDS Tris-glycine gel electrophoresis, according to the protein size. Current from an electrophoresis power supply was used to run the gels in two sections: Section 1 Section 2 2.5. Injection of Intracerebral Ventricles with PD-L1 Adult C57BL/6 female mice ( n 2.6. Statistical Analysis We used the G*Power 3.1.9.7 statistic software program to determine the sample size. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS 21.0 statistical program. A Shapiro–Wilk test was performed to examine the normality of the results. All statistical data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences between groups were analyzed using an analysis of variance test (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. p 3. Results 3.1. EA or PD-L1 Injection Relieved Mechanical and Thermal Hyperalgesia in an Intermittent Cold Stress-Induced FM Mouse Model To explore the role of EA and PD-L1 in fibromyalgia pain, we first generated a fibromyalgia pain model via ICS induction.

Beneficial Effects of EA or PD-L1 on Fibromyalgia Pain Were Mediated via Microglia, Astrocytes, and PD-1 Pathway in the Mouse DRG The effects of EA or PD-L1 on microglia, astrocytes, and PD-1 receptor expression were evaluated 4 days after fibromyalgia induction. On day 4, microglia (Iba1) and astrocytes (GFAP) were significantly increased in the L3–L5 DRG compared with the normal mice ( Figure 2 p n Figure 2 p n Figure 2 p n Figure 2 p n Figure 2 p n Figure 2 p n Figure 2 p n 3.3.

Discussion In this study, we identified an effect of EA on fibromyalgia pain mediated through PD-L1/PD-1 signaling. The fibromyalgia mouse models exhibited mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, with nociception attenuated by 2 Hz EA or PD-L1 injection. We found that the PD-1 receptor was reduced in the peripheral DRG as well as in the central SC, thalamus, SSC, and CB5-7 of the mice. We also confirmed that microglia/astrocytes and the TLR4 pathway were stimulated after FM induction. These trends were reversed by 2 Hz EA or PD-L1 injection. Our findings suggest that the administration of these treatments, due to their effect mediated through PD-1, could be a beneficial therapy for fibromyalgia. All results are displayed as standard error of mean (S.E.M) ( Table S1 Growing scientific evidence indicates that the immune checkpoint PD-L1 could be stimulated in cancer cells to inhibit T-cell function through activating the PD-1 receptor. Less is known about how the PD-1 signaling pathway regulates pain signaling, especially in terms of neuromodulation. One study reported that healthy DRG tissue could release PD-L1 to notably inhibit either acute or chronic pain. Local PD-L1 injection reliably induces antinociception in healthy mice through PD-1 activation. In addition, PD-L1 inhibition via neutralization of the PD-1 receptor initiates considerable mechanical allodynia, suggesting its role in pain control. Our results demonstrated that EA efficiently relieved nociception and led to low PD-1 levels in fibromyalgia mice. Deletion of Pd1 28 Wang et al. reported that the immunotherapy nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PD-1, can suppress tumors. They utilized a genetic knockout of the PD-1 receptor ( Pd1 −/− 29 30 31 After a stroke, patients often experience thalamic pain, which is a neuropathic pain syndrome; an increase in cases of this type of neuralgia has been observed. A recent study declared that collagenase IV injected into the right thalamus of mice induced thalamic pain, which could then be relieved by dexmedetomidine (a selective α2 adrenergic receptor agonist). The increased levels of Iba1, GFAP, and TLR4/NF-κB signaling in the thalamic pain mouse models were reversed by intraperitoneal injection of dexmedetomidine [ 32 2+ 2+ 33 34 35 36 37 5. Conclusions We found that mechanical and thermal pain in mice with ICS-induced fibromyalgia was reversed by 2 Hz EA and PD-L1 injection. Further, levels of microglia/astrocytes and also HMGB1 and S100B were increased, whereas PD-1 was decreased, in the DRG, SC, thalamus, SSC, and CB5-7 of fibromyalgia mice. Also, the expression of nociceptive TLR4 and its related downstream elements increased after fibromyalgia induction, which was then repressed by EA or PD-L1 injection in all of the tested regions except for the DRG, where PD-L1 injection could not reverse changes in expression, suggesting it is ineffective here. Our results indicate that EA’s effect on the PD-L1/PD1 pathway might be the key to its potential as a therapeutic target for fibromyalgia ( Figure 9 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/brainsci15090976/s1 Author Contributions I.-H.H., W.-H.C., and M.-C.L.: conceptualization, methodology, software, data curation, writing—original draft, visualization, and investigation; H.-C.H., H.-Y.L., and Y.-W.L.: supervision, validation, and writing—review and editing.
