Introduction Cantú syndrome (CS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the KCNJ8 ABCC9 Methods We investigated the effects of CS-associated KATP channel overactivity on epithelial barrier integrity and tight junction (TJ) proteins using murine models. Heterozygous (SUR2 wt/AV AV/AV Results GOF mutations in KATP channels caused significant dysregulation of TJ proteins. Occludin expression was increased in SUR2 AV/AV wt/AV Discussion Our findings demonstrate that CS-associated KATP channel GOF mutations disrupt tight junction dynamics and induces structural remodeling of the colon. This establishes a novel link between KATP channel dysregulation, metabolic-epithelial interactions, and intestinal pathophysiology in CS. Furthermore, the results highlight potential therapeutic targets to mitigate barrier dysfunction, providing a basis for developing interventions to address gastrointestinal symptoms in CS.

These octameric complexes consist of four inwardly rectifying Kir6.x subunits (Kir6.1/KCNJ8 or Kir6.2/KCNJ11) and four sulfonylurea receptor subunits (SUR1/ABCC8 or SUR2/ABCC9). Their tissue-specific configurations confer functional specialization across the pancreatic, cardiovascular, skeletal, and neural systems ( 11 14 10 15 17 In the gastrointestinal tract, KATP channels regulate chloride secretion, influence smooth muscle contractility, and modulate neural reflexes, playing a role in disorders like inflammatory bowel disease and Hirschsprung's disease ( 18 23 20 24 25 26 28 29 31 32 36 Rodent studies support a role for colonic KATP channels in chloride secretion and epithelial barrier maintenance, with functional interactions noted between these channels and hydrogen sulfide (H 2 37 20 38 39 42 Our previous work demonstrated that CS-associated GOF mutations in murine KCNJ8 [Kir6.1(V65M)] and ABCC9 [SUR2(A478V)] recapitulate key human phenotypes, including profound skeletal muscle pathology and cardiovascular defects ( 43 44 The Kir6.1(V65M) and SUR2(A478V) mutations likely perturb colonic physiology via distinct mechanisms. Kir6.1(V65M) may enhance channel open probability, promoting excessive potassium efflux and membrane hyperpolarization, impairing ion transport and TJ integrity. In contrast, SUR2(A478V) may decrease ATP sensitivity, resulting in constitutive channel activation, metabolic dysregulation, oxidative stress, and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. These divergent mechanisms suggest mutation-specific effects on epithelial and barrier function. To investigate this, we examined murine models harboring heterozygous (SUR2 wt/AV AV/AV Results Kir6.1- and SUR2-dependent KATP channels are expressed at the epithelial level and the muscular level in the colon Histological analyses of human and murine colonic tissue reveal distinct localization of Kir6.1 and SUR2-gated KATP channels across epithelial and muscular compartments. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates robust expression of Kir6.1 and SUR2 subunits within the smooth muscle layers, with pronounced enrichment in circular and longitudinal muscle fibers ( Figures 1 3 34 36 Figure 1 Immunohistochemical localization of KATP channel subunits Kir6.1 and SUR2 in normal human colon tissue.

Each section reveals cell structures with varying staining patterns, highlighting cellular and tissue detail differences. The sections are stained to differentiate morphological features. Within the epithelial compartment, Kir6.1 and SUR2 immunoreactivity is predominantly localized to the apical and basolateral membranes of enterocytes, with pronounced staining in the crypts of Lieberkühn ( Figure 3 20 38 Beyond epithelial and muscular compartments, Kir6.1 and SUR2 expression extends to neuronal structures of the enteric nervous system, with detectable levels in myenteric and submucosal ganglia. Within these regions, expression is particularly associated with inhibitory motor neurons, where KATP channel activation is linked to reduced excitability and modulation of enteric reflexes. This expression pattern aligns with electrophysiological studies implicating KATP channels in enteric neurotransmission ( 20 Figures 1 3 GOF CS mutations result in an alteration in the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins (Occludin, Claudin-1, and ZO-1) in colon tissue Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of colonic RNA extracted from CS and WT mice revealed significant changes in the mRNA expression profiles of key tight junction proteins, including Occludin, Claudin-1, and ZO-1, in mutant mice compared to controls. Specifically, the expression of Occludin, a critical tight junction protein responsible for regulating epithelial barrier integrity, was differentially regulated depending on the specific KATP mutation; Occludin expression was significantly ( p AV/AV wt/AV wt/VM AV/AV AV/AV wt/AV wt/VM AV/AV AV/AV wt/AV wt/VM n post hoc p Figure 4 Figure 4 Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of tight junction gene expression. mRNA levels of OCLN (A) CLDN1 (B) TJP1 (C) wt/AV AV/AV wt/VM wt/AV AV/AV post hoc P P P P Bar graphs showing mRNA relative expression levels of OCLN, CLDN1, and TJP1 in different genotypes including WT, SUR-W/W, SUR2A/V, and Klfα1-W/M.

Gain-of-function mutations in the CS gene result in a transcriptional shift toward pro-apoptotic signaling in the colon, a process closely intertwined with oxidative stress responses.

Each condition displays differently stained tissue samples, indicating variations in protein expression among the samples. Gain-of-function CS mutations lead to the disruption of tight junction protein expression and epithelial barrier integrity Immunohistochemical staining of colonic sections from CS and WT mice revealed significant alterations in the expression of tight junction proteins, particularly Occludin and Claudin-1. In WT mice, both proteins were strongly expressed at the apical junctions of epithelial cells, maintaining the characteristic organization of tight junctions. In contrast, CS mice exhibited a marked reduction in the expression of Occludin and Claudin-1, particularly at intercellular junctions. The staining intensity of Occludin was notably diminished, indicating a disruption in tight junction integrity, while Claudin-1 expression was similarly reduced, further suggesting impaired barrier function. This decrease in tight junction protein expression may underlie a structural and functional impairment of the epithelial barrier, potentially contributing to increased intestinal permeability in CS mice. These findings support the hypothesis that altered KATP channel activity plays a role in destabilizing tight junctions, which may exacerbate barrier dysfunction and intestinal inflammation in the mutant phenotype ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Representative histological analysis of the sample with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) reaction and immunostaining for junction proteins (occludin, and Claudin-1) on colon sections of (a, a1) (b, b1) wt/AV (c, c1) AV/AV (d, d1) wt/VM Histological images labeled A, B1, B2, C1, and C2 show tissue sections stained to highlight mSUR2 expression. Staining reveals brown areas indicating mSUR2 presence, contrasted against blue-stained surrounding tissue. Different panels display varied magnifications and tissue orientations. Gain-of-function CS mutations induce structural and functional alterations in the colonic epithelium and smooth muscle of CS mice Histological examination of colonic sections from CS and WT mice revealed notable structural alterations in the colonic epithelial layer and smooth muscle of CS mice. CS mice disrupted the typical organization of tightly packed columnar cells with well-defined apical-basal polarity in the epithelial layer. The epithelium exhibited signs of disorganization, including irregular cell arrangement and a marked increase in intercellular spaces, indicative of a compromised epithelial barrier. This disruption is likely associated with the destabilization of tight junctions, as evidenced by the reduced expression of tight junction proteins, such as Occludin and Claudin-1. Moreover, the epithelial layer of CS mice showed increased cellular infiltration, indicative of an inflammatory response, which further supports the notion of epithelial dysfunction. Notably, sections from CS mice exhibited autolytic disintegration phenomena, likely a consequence of the inflammatory state, accompanied by intense caspase-3 immunoreactivity ( Figure 8 Figure 8 Representative histological analysis of the sample with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) reaction and immunostain for casp-3 on colon sections of (a 1 , a 2 ) (b 1 , b 2 ) AV/AV wt/AV (c 1 , c 2 ) wt/VM Histological images showing intestinal tissue sections from three genotypes: WT, SUR2AV/AV, and Kir6.1wt/VM. Each genotype has two magnifications: low (a1, b1, c1) and high (a2, b2, c2). WT sections have light staining, SUR2AV/AV sections show dense, dark staining, and Kir6.1wt/VM sections have intermediate staining. CS mice displayed hypertrophic changes in the underlying smooth muscle layer characterized by increased muscle thickness and apparent disorganization of smooth muscle fibers. Smooth muscle cells appeared structurally disordered and showed signs of hyperplasia, particularly in the muscularis propria, most prominently in SUR AV/AV Table 1 Table 1 A comparative histological analysis was performed to assess the severity and distribution of pathological changes in colonic tissue across genotypes, including WT and CS mice (SUR2 wt/AV AV/AV wt/VM  Pathological changes  WT  SUR2 wt/AV  SUR2 AV/AV  Kir6.1 wt/VM Diffuse inflammation –/+ ++ +++ +++ Patchy/focal inflammation – ++ +++ + Active cryptitis – +++ +++ +++ Mucosal remodeling – +++ +++ +++ Alteration of the musculature – ++ ++ +++ Neutrophils in lamina propria – ++ ++ ++ Overall, these structural alterations in the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of CS mice reflect a complex disruption of colonic architecture, likely contributing to observed physiological abnormalities such as increased intestinal permeability and impaired motility. These impairments may stem from altered KATP channel activity in CS mice, which exacerbates both epithelial and smooth muscle dysfunction, ultimately contributing to the pathophysiology of the mutant phenotype ( Figure 8 Table 1 AV/AV wt/VM Discussion To our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive evidence that Kir6.1 and SUR2 subunits of KATP channels are strongly expressed in both human and murine colons, with predominant localization in the colonic epithelium. These findings suggest that KATP channels are crucial in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, enabling selective nutrient absorption while preventing pathogen infiltration. Prior research has documented the presence of Kir6.1/SUR2 complexes in rodents' non-vascular smooth muscle and colonic epithelial cells, and their co-localization with TJ proteins in the small intestine ( 40 43 KATP channels are well-known metabolic sensors that couple ATP/ADP ratios to ion fluxes and membrane potential, ensuring cellular adaptation to metabolic stressors such as hypoxia or ischemia ( 13 16 26 45 We employed multiple murine models carrying gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in SUR2 [SUR2(A478V)] or Kir6.1 [Kir6.1(V65M)] to explore the impact of KATP channel hyperactivity. Heterozygous SUR2A478V animals showed moderate epithelial alterations, while homozygous mutants displayed more severe pathology, including smooth muscle hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation, consistent with a dose-dependent GOF effect. Kir6.1V65M mice exhibited pronounced deficits in motility and neuromuscular coordination, which aligns with findings by York et al. ( 20 wt/VM In WT mice, epithelial homeostasis is maintained through cell turnover, TJ remodeling, and immune surveillance. In contrast, CS mice with GOF mutations in Kir6.1 or SUR2 displayed compromised barrier function and heightened inflammation ( 20 SUR A V AV SUR w t AV Kir V M Our data suggest that KATP channel hyperactivity compromises TJ integrity through converging mechanisms, notably membrane hyperpolarization and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( 29 30 46 48 47 49 GOF mutations in KATP subunits led to structural and molecular abnormalities, including epithelial disorganization, inflammation, and apoptosis. These defects were accompanied by increased caspase-3 activity, indicating widespread programmed cell death. Mechanistically, sustained potassium efflux and plasma membrane hyperpolarization elevate intracellular calcium, enhancing mitochondrial respiration and generating excess ROS. This oxidative stress damages TJ components, disrupts cytoskeletal anchoring, and activates inflammatory pathways. It also perturbs apoptotic regulation by decreasing BCL2/BCL-XL BAX Additionally, KATP channels may directly interact with TJ components, as shown by the co-localization of Kir6.1 and SUR2 with Claudin-1, implicating a structural role in barrier maintenance. Beyond epithelial cells, our localization studies revealed expression of Kir6.1 and SUR2 in colonic smooth muscle and ICC, suggesting involvement in neuromuscular coordination and pacemaker activity. This may underlie the motility impairments seen in CS models, especially in Kir6.1 mutant. Overall, our findings point to KATP channel dysregulation as a central driver of intestinal dysfunction in CS via oxidative stress, inflammatory activation, and epithelial disruption. However, the precise molecular pathways, particularly calcium signaling and ROS, warrant further investigation. This study provides novel insights into the role of KATP channels in CS-related intestinal pathology. Its strength lies in using multiple murine models and a multi-level analytical approach encompassing molecular, histological, and functional parameters. Identifying oxidative stress and apoptosis as mediators of TJ dysfunction highlights promising therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, some limitations should be acknowledged. While murine models offer valuable mechanistic insights, interspecies differences in physiology and immune responses may limit translation to humans. Our analyses focused primarily on structural, molecular and histological features of colonic epithelial integrity. Functional permeability assays, such as Using chamber measurements or sugar absorption tests, were not performed, representing an important limitation. Such assays provide direct quantification of paracellular flux, electrolyte transport and barrier function, and would be essential to corroborate the molecular observations derived from frozen tissues, which are well suited for immunohistochemistry and histochemical analyses but not for functional studies. By concentrating on the colon, our work does not address potential contributions from other intestinal regions. Although the colon was selected owing to its established relevance in disease, the small intestine differs substantially in immune cell populations, microbial ecology, nutrient absorption and epithelial turnover, all of which may shape pathophysiology and responses to intervention. Further, direct assessments of intracellular calcium flux and reactive oxygen species generation would strengthen the mechanistic link between KATP channel hyperactivity, oxidative stress and tight junction disruption. Future studies will therefore aim to define the causal chain connecting KATP hyperactivity, calcium flux and ROS production, incorporating Ussing chamber assays and complementary measures of epithelial transport to validate the structural findings reported here. Finally, although CS is not generally associated with sex differences in cardiovascular function, possible sex-specific effects of CS mutations on intestinal physiology cannot be excluded, and forthcoming experiments in CS mice will address this question. Despite these limitations, this work lays the foundation for future research to develop therapeutic strategies targeting KATP channels or downstream pathways to restore intestinal barrier function in CS and related conditions. Materials and methods Animal care and ethical statements Given the current lack of evidence supporting sex-based differences in conditioned stimulus (CS) responses, our experiments were conducted exclusively using male mice to maintain consistency and reduce potential variability ( 8 9 w t VM w t AV A V AV 8 9 ad libitum Animal sacrifice and tissue harvesting Animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia with ZOLETIL 50/50 (40 mg/kg, i.p.). Tissues and organs were harvested under sterile conditions to prevent contamination. Organs were weighed and either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for protein extraction or embedded in OCT for immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, then stored at −80 °C. All procedures were conducted in Ringer's solution (145 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl 2 2 Total RNA isolation and RT-qPCR According to the manufacturer's instructions, total RNA was isolated from colon tissue using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA).

Results are presented as mean ± SEM unless otherwise specified. The corresponding figure legends detail the number of biological and technical replicates for each experiment. Statistical analyses were conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc p t p wt/VM n wt/AV n AV/AV n n n Conclusion The present study demonstrates that GOF mutations in Kir6.1 and SUR2, characteristic of CS, induce profound alterations in TJ protein expression and epithelial barrier integrity. CS murine models exhibited disrupted mRNA and protein levels of Occludin, Claudin-1, and ZO-1, correlating with structural epithelial defects, increased paracellular permeability, and inflammatory infiltration. Additionally, smooth muscle hypertrophy and fibrosis indicate broader neuromuscular dysfunction in the colon. Mechanistically, KATP channel hyperactivity likely drives oxidative stress and caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, compromising barrier integrity and sustaining a cycle of inflammation and tissue damage. These findings underscore the essential role of KATP channels in intestinal homeostasis and link their dysregulation to epithelial and neuromuscular pathology in CS. Given that SUR1 and SUR2 subunits are well-established drug targets in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, the high expression of KATP channel subunits in the colon suggests their potential for pharmacological modulation of intestinal motility and barrier function. Targeting oxidative stress or KATP channel activity may offer novel therapeutic strategies to restore barrier function and mitigate intestinal complications in CS and related disorders.
