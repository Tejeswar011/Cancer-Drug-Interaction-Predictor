Various NADESs, formulated from polyalcohols, sugars, and organic acids, were employed as pretreatment solvents prior to microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD) to facilitate plant cell wall breakdown and improve the efficiency of EO extraction. The findings revealed that the most effective pretreatment conditions for enhancing EO extraction involved using a NADES composed of choline chloride and glycerol (in a 1:2 molar ratio), applied to fennel seed powder at a solid-to-NADES ratio of 1:6 g/mL. Optimal performance was achieved with 20% water content in the NADES, microwave irradiation at 400 W for 6 min, followed by 96 min of MAHD. Under these conditions, the NADESs-based MAHD achieved the highest EO yield, increasing it from 1.33% with water-based MAHD to 2.70%.

Introduction Fennel ( Foeniculum vulgare 1 Figure 1 2 3 4 5 6 EOs are concentrated natural oils extracted rich in aromatic compounds, commonly used in aromatherapy for their therapeutic benefits. EOs from Foeniculum vulgare trans 7 EOs are commonly extracted using traditional methods such as hydrodistillation and steam distillation. However, these methods often require long extraction times and yield relatively small amounts of oil, which can lead to the loss of valuable components through hydrolysis or thermal degradation, especially in the case of unsaturated compounds. To address these issues, MAHD has emerged as a green, eco-friendly, and efficient alternative that combines microwave heating with traditional hydrodistillation principles. The development and adoption of MAHD EO extraction is highly desirable. Due to its advantages including shorter extraction time, faster heating, improved product quality, energy efficiency, and no direct contact between the plant and heat source, MAHD is widely used for extracting volatile compounds from various plants [ 8 Additionally, pretreatment is essential for overcoming the natural resistance of plant cell walls and enhancing the release of intracellular bioactive compounds. Recently, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as a novel class of green solvents offering a promising alternative for such applications. They are typically made by mixing hydrogen bond donors (HBD) and hydrogen bonds acceptors (HBA) in various molar ratios; this results in a combination that has a lower melting point because of the hydrogen bonding. Low toxicity, affordability, biodegradability, broad liquid range, low vapor pressure, non-flammability, chemical and thermal stability, ease of synthesis with excellent purity, water compatibility, and strong solubilizing power are only a few benefits of DESs. DESs made from solely natural substances are termed natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) [ 9 10 11 12 13 Angelicae pubescentis 14 15 Aralia elata 16 17 18 19 20 Liquidambar formosana 21 22 23 Despite the recognized potential of EO extraction from F. vulgare F. vulgare 2. Results 2.1. Effects of NADES Components Efficiency of NADES-MAHD using different types and molar ratios of NADESs represented as EO extraction yields shown in Figure 2 24 25 26 EO yields were in the range of 1.33–2.70%. The highest yield was obtained using Ch:Gly at a molar ratio of 1:2 (ND2) as NADES. Therefore, it was selected for further investigation. It is worth mentioning that, although not giving the highest extraction yield, NADES composed of Ch:EG, Ch:CA and Ch:Glu provided remarkable high yield at 2.32–2.48% for all ratios in this study. Due to the similar dipole moments of glycerol and ethylene glycol, NADESs based on Ch:Gly and Ch:EG showed comparable extraction yields. For carboxylic acids, an overall yield of EOs from Ch:CA was found to be higher than that of Ch:OA. This effect can be attributed to the intrinsic properties of citric acid, which exhibits a relatively high dipole moment and an abundance of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, thereby promoting extensive hydrogen-bonding interactions that enhance the structural stability of the system [ 27 Glucose was reported slightly higher dipole moment than fructose. This is due to the different ring size and arrangement of hydroxyl groups. As a result, when used as NADESs in NADES-MAHD, Ch:Glu represented a higher average yield of EOs than that from Ch:Fru. The polarity of DESs varies depending on the hydrogen bond donor (HBD) component used. Organic acid-based DESs are generally the most polar, while sugar- and polyalcohol-based DESs exhibit lower polarity, similar to that of methanol. Additionally, the polarity of a NADES can be fine-tuned by adjusting the molar ratio of its components. Since solvent polarity strongly influences the extraction efficiency of EO compounds, matching the polarity of the NADES with the oil composition typically leads to higher yields [ 28 All types of NADES-based MAHD resulted in higher EO yields (1.77–2.70%.) compared to water-based MAHD without pretreatment (1.33%), indicating that the use of NADESs as a pretreatment for turmeric had a significant impact on enhancing EO yield. These interactions increase cell wall permeability, thereby facilitating EO extraction. As NADES are composed of natural plant-compatible components, they represent a promising green solvent for improving EO isolation [ 29 Although Ch:Gly at a 1:2 molar ratio (ND2) provided the highest yield (2.70%), increasing the ratio to 1:3 (ND3) led to a significant decline (2.07%). Similar trends were observed for Ch:OA (ND12), with a yield of 1.77%, and Ch:Fru (ND18), with a yield of 1.78%. This reduction is likely due to the decreased amount of choline chloride, which lowered the proportion of hydrogen bond acceptors in the NADES system. Since hydrogen bonding is crucial for solubilizing bioactive compounds, especially those with polar functional groups like hydroxyls, this imbalance may impair extraction efficiency. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining an optimal donor-to-acceptor ratio in NADES formulations [ 30 2.2. Effects of Solid-to-NADES Ratio Solid-to-NADES (S/N) ratio is one of the most important parameters in the pretreatment step of EO extraction, as shown in Figure 3 31 32 31 2.3. Effect of Water Content in NADES Water plays a major role in NADES properties. High viscosity is one of the distinct characteristics of NADES due to the extensive hydrogen bonding. Adding water to NADES decreased this viscosity, making solvent molecules easier to contact fennel seeds [ 33 24 A water content of 20–30% in NADES is generally recommended, as it can enhance the extraction efficiency of both polar and non-polar compounds [ 30 Figure 3 In addition to decreasing viscosity, water in NADES also affected the hydrogen-bond network of NADES, a phenomenon that disrupts the plant cell wall or improves the solubility of EOs. With too high water content, NADES loses this network, hence the decreased extracted yield [ 34 35 Recent studies have shown that water content influences not only the viscosity of lactic acid-based NADES but also several physicochemical and antimicrobial properties. Dilution with water weakens hydrogen bonding, decreases density and refractive index, increases pH, and significantly reduces viscosity and surface tension. Moreover, higher water content increases water activity and leads to a reduction in antimicrobial activity. These findings highlight the importance of controlling water content when designing NADES for green extraction and antimicrobial applications [ 36 2.4. Effect of Pretreatment Power Microwave power was suspected to improve extraction efficiency by inducing molecular vibrations that disrupt plant cell walls during the pretreatment stage, thereby facilitating dissolution and allowing EOs to diffuse out [ 26 37 Figure 3 2.5. Effect of Pretreatment Time The extraction procedure consisted of two steps: NADES pretreatment and MAHD. Besides NADES compositions, parameters including pretreatment duration were investigated. Pretreatment time directly affected the yield of EO. As shown in Figure 3 38 2.6. Antimicrobial Activities All fennel EOs were examined for their antimicrobial activity against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria, as outlined in Table 1 S. pyogenes L. monocytogenes Salmonella Typhi P. aeruginosa S. aureus E. coli 39 40 P. aeruginosa 40 Table 2 Str. Pyogenes P. aeruginosa. The antifungal activities of fennel EO extract are detailed in Table 1 C. albicans 41 C. albicans C. albicans 42 In addition to their antimicrobial properties, it is important to consider the cytotoxic potential of fennel essential oil. Sharopov et al. (2017) reported that the essential oil of fennel seeds exhibits low cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines, including HeLa (human cervical cancer), Caco-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma), CCRF-CEM (human T lymphoblast leukemia), and CEM/ADR5000 (adriamycin-resistant leukemia), compared to the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin [ 43 2.7. Antioxidant Activity Antioxidant capacity of EOs is shown in Table 3 50 23 50 44 50 • 44 Nevertheless, previous studies have suggested that compounds such as fenchone and anethole contribute to the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of fennel, while monoterpene hydrocarbons (e.g., those present in thyme and oregano) play a significant role in inhibiting oxidation–peroxidation [ 45 40 2.8. Volatile Phytochemical Compositions of Fennel Seed EOs The EOs of F. vulgare Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Table 4 Figure 6 In addition, oxygen atoms in fenchone probably made the difference by interacting with NADES, making the compound more accessible to solvents. EO obtained by Ch:CA (1:2) and Ch:OA (2:1) also demonstrated other interesting constituents besides a higher number of compounds compared to other EOs. The 4 major compounds (anethole, estragole, fenchone and D-limonene) extracted by MAHD, without any NADES, were found identical to those reported by Diao et al. [ 46 46 Considering, α-terpineol was a compound found only when carboxylic acids were used as HBDs, Ch:OA (2:1). trans trans 20 Multiple studies have demonstrated the antimicrobial effects and underlying mechanisms of D-limonene against a range of bacterial and fungal species, while β-ocimene, a key component in EOs, has been associated with anticonvulsant, antifungal, and antitumor activities, along with pest-resistant properties [ 47 34 3. Discussion In recent years, growing environmental awareness has led companies to adjust their ethical standards and production practices. The drive toward global sustainability and the concept of a “green industry” calls for practical solutions that reduce environmental impact while preserving product quality [ 48 Foeniculum vulgare 49 34 50 10 The higher extraction yield observed in NADES-based MAHD compared to water-based MAHD can be attributed to the superior penetration capacity of NADES constituents. These components absorb microwave radiation more effectively than water and convert it into thermal energy, which facilitates the dissolution of cell wall components and the extraction of soluble substances from the plant material. This enhanced performance is largely due to the unique role of hydrogen bond donors (HBD) under microwave irradiation, which promotes compound release through efficient microwave absorption, disruption of the cell wall, and cellulose dissolution [ 51 52 The integration of NADES with microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (NADES-MAHD) not only enhances essential oil yield but also significantly improves energy efficiency compared to conventional hydrodistillation (HD). By reducing extraction time and lowering electricity consumption, NADES-MAHD minimizes the overall energy demand of the process. For instance, during the extraction of essential oils from Litsea cubeba 24 Interest in essential oils has steadily increased in recent years due to their high economic value and expanding market demand. These aromatic compounds are widely applied in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. Despite their potential, scaling up essential oil extraction using microwave-assisted hydrodistillation (MAHD) remains challenging, primarily because of the limited penetration of microwaves into plant materials [ 53 54 Beyond extraction efficiency, an important consideration for the industrial application of NADES is their toxicological safety, particularly the potential risk of co-extracting toxic trace elements from plant matrices. Although NADES are composed of generally recognized as safe (GRAS) components, their strong solubilizing power may lead to the unintended extraction of metals or other impurities. This concern has been recently addressed in a study on Glycyrrhiza glabra 55 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Materials and Chemicals Choline chloride (98%) was purchased from Loba Chemie Pvt Ltd., Mumbai, India. Oxalic acid dihydrate (≥99.5%) was purchased from Qrec (Asia), Rawang, Malaysia.

The material was authenticated by the Faculty of Science and Technology, Pibulsongkram Rajabhat University (PSRU), Phitsanulok, Thailand. Foeniculum vulgare 4.2. Preparation of NADESs The selection of hydrogen bond donors (HBDs) was guided by previous studies demonstrating their effectiveness in forming NADES with choline chloride for essential oil extraction. Ethylene glycol, glycerol, oxalic acid, citric acid, glucose, and fructose were selected as hydrogen bond donors (HBD) along with choline chloride (HBA) as NADESs because previous research utilized ethylene glycol, glycerol, oxalic acid, and fructose along with choline chloride as a DES-based microwave-assisted hydrodistillation method (DES-MAHD) to extract clove essential oils [ 23 Litsea cubeba 24 Both glucose and fructose were selected as HBDs along with choline chloride (HBA) due to previous findings in the literature. Yu et al. (2017) employed glucose, fructose, ethylene glycol, glycerol, and urea as HBDs with choline chloride to extract essential oils from pepper fruits using the DES-based MAHD method and observed that fructose as HBD gave the highest essential oil yield [ 56 22 Table 5 4.3. NADES-MAHD for EO Extraction Microwave-assisted natural deep eutectic solvent pretreatment coupled with hydrodistillation (NADES-MAHD) was selected as the extraction method. The schematic diagram of the extraction setup is shown in Figure 7 37 Yield of EO(%) = W E F (1) E F 4.4. Antimicrobial Assay The antimicrobial activities of fennel EO extract were evaluated using the agar disk-diffusion method. A suspension containing a final inoculation size of 0.5 McFarland was prepared for four Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pyogenes Bacillus cereus Listeria monocytogenes Escherichia coli Salmonella Typhi Pseudomonas aeruginosa Enterobacter aerogenes A suspension of Candida albicans Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined using broth dilution method in 96-well plates. A series of two-fold dilutions of each EO, ranging from 25 to 0.01 mg/mL, was prepared in MHB with the volume of 50 µL. The solution was then added 50 µL of bacteria culture containing approximately 1.5 × 6 4.5. DPPH Radical Scavenging Assay A 50 μL aliquot of EO stock solution (diluted 5-fold) was mixed with 150 μL of DPPH solution (0.417 mM). Methanol was used as the blank. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, the absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a microplate reader (Metertech, Taipei, Taiwan). The percentage of DPPH radical inhibition was calculated using Equation (2), as follows: % DPPH radical scavenging = (A control sample control (2) control sample 4.6. GC–MS-Based Analysis of Fennel Seed Phytochemicals EO samples were diluted with dichloromethane, and anhydrous sodium sulfate was added to eliminate moisture from the solution. The phytochemical compositions in the EOs were identified and quantified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) using an Agilent 6890N GC coupled with a 5973 MSD (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Sample injection was performed in split mode with a split ratio of 20:1, using an injection volume of 1 μL and an injector temperature of 230 °C. The column oven temperature was initially set at 60 °C and then ramped to 250 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. Mass spectrometric detection was conducted using electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV, with a scan range of m/z Compound identification in fennel seed EO was carried out by matching the acquired mass spectra with those available in the NIST Mass Spectral Search Program database. Additionally, confirmation was supported by comparing the Kovats retention indices (RIs), calculated based on the retention times of the target compounds relative to a homologous series of n-alkanes (C 9 26 4.7. Statistica Analysis All experimental data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Data analysis was performed using the trial version of Minitab 18 software, including analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post hoc test to determine statistically significant differences among means ( p 5. Conclusions This study successfully developed a novel green extraction strategy combining NADES pretreatment with MAHD to isolate essential oils from Foeniculum vulgare S. pyogenes C. albicans Although the overall EO composition remained consistent, NADES pretreatment led to a higher content of monoterpene hydrocarbons, with D-limonene and trans Despite the promising results of NADES-assisted MAHD for essential oil extraction, comprehensive optimization of process parameters is still required to fully enhance extraction efficiency and reproducibility. In addition, further studies are needed to assess the stability of essential oil components in NADES and to evaluate the feasibility of solvent reuse. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for meeting the stringent quality standards of the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries, and for supporting the industrial-scale adoption of NADES-MAHD as a sustainable extraction technology.
