However, to date, no studies have compared the effectiveness of different administration routes of dexamethasone for thoracoscopy-guided thoracic paravertebral block (TTPB). This prospective randomized controlled study evaluated the postoperative analgesic effects of dexamethasone administered intravenously or perineurally in combination with ropivacaine for TTPB in patients undergoing radical lung cancer resection. Methods A total of 150 patients were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone intravenously (Group I, n=75) or perineurally (Group D, n=75). Before wound closure, patients in Group I underwent TTPB with ropivacaine while receiving an intravenous dexamethasone injection, whereas patients in Group D received a perineural mixture of ropivacaine and dexamethasone. The primary outcome was the time to first postoperative rescue analgesia. Secondary outcomes included Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores, postoperative 48-hour sufentanil consumption in patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA), postoperative blood glucose levels, postoperative recovery parameters, and incidence of adverse events. Results Compared with Group I, Group D showed a significantly longer time to first postoperative rescue analgesia, lower VAS scores at all assessed time points, and reduced postoperative 48-hour sufentanil consumption. Group D also showed a smaller increase in postoperative blood glucose levels, an earlier time to first ambulation and a shorter postoperative hospital stay (all P P Conclusion In TTPB, perineural dexamethasone administration with ropivacaine provided superior and longer-lasting analgesia compared with intravenous administration. Additionally, it accelerated postoperative recovery and shortened hospital stay.

Despite significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer in recent years, its 5-year survival rate remains low, particularly in advanced-stage patients. 1 2 3 4 5 6 In postoperative analgesia, thoracic paravertebral nerve block (TPVB) has been widely used for pain management following thoracic surgeries, effectively mitigating the surgical stress response and enhancing pain management. 7 8 9 Ropivacaine, a long-acting local anesthetic, is commonly used in thoracic paravertebral block to extend analgesic duration. However, its effect lasts only about 6 hours, 10 11 12 Methods Study Design and Population This single-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial (Identifier: ChiCTR-ICR-2400086347) was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on June 28, 2024. The study (KY2023SL340-01) was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Ningbo Medical Centre Lihuili Hospital. The study adhered to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. 13 Participants Inclusion criteria were: (1) patients aged between 20 and 75 years; (2) American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade II; (3) body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kg/m²; and (4) provision of written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) allergy to ropivacaine or dexamethasone; (2) abnormal blood coagulation, thoracic vertebral deformity or fracture, or diabetes; (3) severe pleural adhesions; (4) requirement for intraoperative conversion to open thoracotomy; and (5) patient refusal. Randomization and Blinding During the grouping process, patients were randomly assigned to different groups in a 1:1 ratio according to the computer-generated randomization sequence. Group allocation information was concealed within sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed envelopes prepared by a designated nurse. A dedicated management team was established within the study to safeguard the allocation documents and prepare the corresponding study drugs for thoracic surgeons prior to TTPB procedures. Patients received their group assignment records before the TTPB procedure, and the healthcare staff prepared the paravertebral block and study drugs accordingly. In the Group I, while the surgeons performed paravertebral block under thoracoscope guidance, the anesthesiologists simultaneously administered dexamethasone intravenously. In Group D, the thoracic surgeon accurately administered a mixture of ropivacaine and dexamethasone for the paravertebral block under thoracoscopic guidance, the anesthesiologist simultaneously administered the same volume of normal saline intravenously. To strictly maintain blinding and ensure the objectivity and reliability of the study results, the surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nursing staff who participated in the surgery were not involved in postoperative follow-up, outcome assessment, or statistical analysis. Patients and postoperative assessment personnel were blinded to the administration method of dexamethasone. The combination of different dexamethasone administration routes and the TTPB procedure was performed intraoperatively. Patients were under general anesthesia, and postoperative assessment personnel did not participate in the surgery, both were blinded. Postoperative assessments and outcome evaluations were conducted by independent anesthesiology personnel not engaged in the surgical procedure. Anesthesia Procedure Standard monitoring included continuous electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure measurement, pulse oximetry (SpO 2 2 2 Surgical Procedure A two-port thoracoscopic lobectomy was performed via incisions located at the 7th intercostal space along the midaxillary line and the 4th intercostal space between the midclavicular and anterior axillary lines. Malignancy was confirmed intraoperatively before completing the lobectomy. A 26F thoracic drain was inserted before chest wall closure. Analgesia Methods Before chest closure, a 5G scalp needle with extension tubing was inserted into the paravertebral space under thoracoscopic guidance, 1 cm lateral to the T5-T6 interspace and 0.5 cm below the parietal pleura ( Figure 1 Figure 1 The TTPB is located in the fifth and sixth thoracic paravertebral spaces. The white raised area indicates the spread of local anaesthetic in the paravertebral space. Study Outcomes The primary outcome was the time to first postoperative rescue analgesia. Secondary outcomes included VAS scores at six postoperative time points (1, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours), postoperative 48-hour sufentanil consumption in PCIA, postoperative blood glucose levels (measured at 1, 6, and 24 hours), time to first ambulation, and adverse events. VAS scores were measured at specific postoperative timepoints from T1 to T6 after surgery. For blood glucose measurements, the assessments were taken at T1, T2, and T3. The evaluation indicators for postoperative recovery status include: time to first ambulation (hours), chest tube removal time (days) and postoperative hospital stay time (days). The “time to first ambulation” refers to the duration (in hours) from the completion of surgery to the patient’s first attempt at walking, as assessed by the attending nursing staff. This was recorded as the time elapsed until the patient was able to independently stand and walk with or without assistance. Postoperative adverse effects, including epidural spread, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, atelectasis, were assessed. Sample Size and Statistical Analysis The sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome—time to first postoperative rescue analgesia. A pilot trial of 20 patients in each group showed mean (±standard deviation [SD]) times of 19.5 ± 2.6 hours in Group D and 21.1 ± 2.7 hours in Group I. To achieve a power of 0.8 with an alpha of 0.05, the required sample size was calculated to be 54 patients (27 in each group) using the MedSci Sample Size Tools. To account for potential missing data or dropouts, recruit at least 40 patients per group. Based on previous studies by Prangmalee, L et al 11 12 t t U P Results A total of 152 patients with eligibility, 2 patients refused to participate, 150 patients were randomized into Group I or Group D. During the study, three patients in Group D required conversion to open surgery, while two in Group I experienced severe pleural adhesions. These five patients were excluded from the final analysis. Consequently, 145 patients completed the study ( Figure 2 P Table 1 Table 1 Characteristics of the Patients and Surgery I Group (n = 73) D Group (n = 72) P value Gender 0.868 Male 42 (57.5%) 40 (55.6%) Female 31 (42.5%) 32 (44.4%) Age (years) 57.5 ± 10.1 58.2 ± 9.6 0.682 BMI (kg/m 2 23.9 ± 2.7 23.7 ± 2.8 0.585 Surgical site 0.736 Left 28 (38.4%) 30 (41.7%) Right 45 (61.6%) 42 (58.3%) Surgery time (minutes) 123.4 ± 10.6 125.1 ± 11.9 0.362 Sufentanil (μg) 37.3 ± 3.2 36.8 ± 3.5 0.388 Remifentanil (μg) 806.0 ± 36.6 798.3 ± 38.5 0.219 Note Abbreviation 2 Figure 2 Flow chart of this study.

Notes P Discussion Patients undergoing thoracoscopic radical resection for lung cancer commonly experience significant postoperative pain. Effective analgesia facilitates early diaphragmatic movement, coughing, and expectoration, thereby reducing the risk of pulmonary complications such as impaired lung function impairment and infections. 9 14 TPVB is a well-established technique for postoperative analgesia following thoracic surgery. 15 16 8 17 10 11 12 As a potent glucocorticoid, dexamethasone exhibits potent anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, anti-allergic, and analgesic properties. 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 In the present study, compared with Group I, patients in Group D had a significantly longer time to first rescue analgesia, lower sufentanil consumption in PCIA within 48 hours postoperatively, and lower VAS scores at all time points. These findings suggest that perineural dexamethasone combined with ropivacaine for paravertebral nerve block provides superior and longer-lasting analgesia compared to intravenous administration. The shorter duration of effect in the intravenous group may be attributed to faster systemic distribution and metabolism. Interestingly, postoperative nausea was less frequent in Group I than in Group D, which may reflect the more rapid central nervous system penetration of intravenously administered dexamethasone, this is consistent with the research results of Wei G et al. 28 29 30 31 32 Compared with Group I, Group D had a shorter time to first ambulation and a reduced postoperative hospital stay. These findings underscore the benefits of superior analgesia in promoting early mobilization and enhancing recovery, consistent with previous findings. 33 There were certain limitations in our study. Firstly, it did not evaluate the analgesic effects of different dexamethasone doses or explore other nerve block approaches, such as multi-segment TTPB. Secondly, patients with diabetes were excluded due to the known hyperglycemic effects of DEX; further studies are warranted to evaluate safety in this population. Thirdly, longer-term outcomes were not assessed. Conclusion For patients undergoing thoracoscopic radical lung cancer resection, perineural injection of dexamethasone in TTPB with ropivacaine provided superior postoperative analgesic effects, prolonged nerve block duration, and had a smaller impact on blood glucose levels compared to intravenous administration. Additionally, it reduced hospital stay and promoted faster postoperative recovery. Acknowledgments The author would like to thank all the patients who participated in this project.
