Background Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is crucial for overall energy homeostasis as a thermogenic organ with high metabolic activity. While the recruitment of BAT contributes to improved glycemic and lipid homeostasis, the exact molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Objective This investigation compared the transcriptomic responses of semaglutide (GLP-1 receptor agonist) and tirzepatide (dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist) on BAT in mice fed a high-fat, high-fructose diet (HFHFD). These outcomes enhance our understanding of the metabolic actions of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists, providing a conceptual basis for future BAT-targeted therapeutic strategies. Methods Twenty-eight male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON; n n n Results Both semaglutide and tirzepatide reduced body weight, improved lipid profiles, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. Compared with the saline group, administration of semaglutide led to differential expression of 467 genes (199 downregulated and 268 upregulated), whereas tirzepatide modulated 40 genes (20 downregulated and 20 upregulated).

GIP receptors (GIPRs) are widely expressed in the pancreas, brain, bone, and adipose tissue ( 4 5 6 7 8 β 8 9 BAT is functionally distinct from white adipose tissue (WAT), which primarily serves as a lipid storage site. BAT exhibits a specialized form of non-shivering thermogenesis, driven by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which facilitates the direct conversion of chemical energy into heat ( 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 17 Therefore, this study investigated and compared transcriptomic changes in BAT following semaglutide and tirzepatide administration in HFHFD-fed mice, aiming to elucidate their transcriptional regulatory mechanisms and assess whether BAT represents a novel therapeutic target for metabolic disorders. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the metabolic regulatory mechanisms of GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists while providing a theoretical basis for future BAT-targeted therapies. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Reagents and animals Tirzepatide (Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, USA) and semaglutide (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsværd, Denmark) were purchased from their respective manufacturers. Twenty-eight male C57BL/6J mice (7 weeks old; 20 ± 2 g) were maintained under standardized conditions (24 ± 1 °C, 12-h light/dark cycle) and allowed unrestricted access to regular chow and water. The study protocol was evaluated and endorsed by the Ethics Committee of Hebei General Hospital (Approval No. 2025-DW-002). 2.2 Experimental design Mice were acclimated for one week prior to randomization into either an HFHFD-induced obesity model group ( n n Following obesity induction, the model mice ( n n Figure 1 17–20 18 21 17 20 18 21 Figure 1 Experimental design and intervention schedule. Six dot plot charts display gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Chart A includes three sections: top GO terms comparing HFHFD-NS vs. CON, HFHFD-Sema vs. HFHFD-NS, and HFHFD-TZP vs. HFHFD-NS, highlighting processes like lipid metabolism and cellular functions. Chart B includes KEGG enrichment for the same comparisons, showing pathways such as steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling, and cAMP signaling. Dots vary in size according to gene number and are colored by p-value, indicating significance levels. Body weight was tracked weekly across the intervention timeline. After completing all 16 drug administrations, mice were subjected to a second IPGTT following the same protocol as the first test to evaluate glucose metabolism, and the AUC was calculated accordingly. Mice were intraperitoneally anesthetized with 1% pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and euthanized via cervical dislocation at the end of the experiment. Blood samples were collected via retro-orbital bleeding, and both interscapular BAT and liver tissues were harvested for subsequent analyses. 2.3 Biochemical assays Blood samples obtained as described in Section 2.2 were centrifuged (3,000 rpm, 15 min, 4 °C), and the serum was stored at −80 °C until analysis. Serum insulin levels were measured using a Mouse Ultrasensitive Insulin ELISA kit (ALPCO, Salem, USA; 80-INSMSU-E01). Serum TG, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were quantified using commercial assay kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China; A110-1-1, A111-1-1, A112-1-1, A113-1-1). For hepatic TG measurement, approximately 50 mg of liver tissue was homogenized with nine volumes of buffer (w/v = 1:9, g: mL) on ice using a mechanical homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged (2,500 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was used for TG quantification with a commercial kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China; A110-1-1). Absorbance was measured at 500 nm on a microplate reader (Multiskan FC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China), and hepatic TG levels were normalized to tissue weight and expressed as mmol/g tissue. 2.4 Histological analysis For hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, BAT tissues were immersed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for fixation, followed by sequential dehydration in graded ethanol, xylene clearing, and subsequent paraffin embedding. Paraffin-embedded BAT tissues were sectioned into 5-μm slices, deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with H&E following standard protocols. After dehydration and cover slipping, tissue morphology was examined under a light microscope at 200 × magnification. For Oil Red O (ORO) staining, BAT samples were rapidly frozen, cryo-sectioned, and treated with 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation. Tissue slices were stained with ORO to visualize lipid droplets, followed by differentiation, hematoxylin counterstaining, rinsing, and mounting. The lipid droplet area was quantitatively analyzed based on microscopic images using Aipathwell software (Servicebio, Wuhan, China). 2.5 Transcriptomic analysis 2.5.1 RNA extraction and library preparation BAT RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). The assessment of RNA quantity and purity was carried out on a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, USA), while RNA integrity was evaluated with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Library construction for RNA sequencing was completed with the VAHTS Universal V5 RNA Library Prep Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). 2.5.2 Transcriptomic data processing and bioinformatics analysis Sequencing was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), yielding 150 bp paired-end reads. Adapter trimming and quality filtering of raw FASTQ reads were conducted with fastp (v0.20.1; HaploX Biotechnology, Shenzhen, China) ( 22 23 21 24 Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed in R (v3.2.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) to assess intergroup consistency and clustering patterns. Genes exhibiting a q-value below 0.05 and an absolute log₂ fold change greater than 1 were categorized as differentially expressed based on DESeq2 (v1.22.2; European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) analysis ( 25 GO ( 26 27 p 2.6 RT-qPCR validation procedure for DEGs To validate the RNA-seq–identified genes associated with inflammation and lipid metabolism, RT-qPCR analysis was performed. Total RNA (0.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the TransScript All-in-One First-Strand cDNA Synthesis SuperMix with gDNA Remover (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China; AT341-02). The reverse transcription step was conducted at 42 °C for 15 min, followed by enzyme inactivation at 85 °C for 5 s. Quantitative PCR was carried out using PerfectStart™ Green qPCR SuperMix (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China; AQ601) on a Roche LightCycler 480 II system (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Each 10 μL reaction consisted of diluted cDNA, 2 × SuperMix, gene-specific primers (OE Biotech Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China), and nuclease-free water. The primer sequences for the target genes are provided in Supplementary Table S1 −ΔΔCt 2.7 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS (version 27.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, USA) and GraphPad Prism (version 9.5; GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). Results are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical comparisons were carried out using an independent samples t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), or two-way ANOVA, based on data distribution and group structure.

Analysis revealed 58 genes with increased and 108 with decreased expression in the saline group as opposed to the control. Compared with the saline group, semaglutide administration resulted in 467 DEGs, including 268 upregulated and 199 downregulated. In contrast, tirzepatide administration yielded 40 DEGs (20 upregulated and 20 downregulated) ( Figure 4A Figure 4 Transcriptomic analysis of DEGs across four groups of mice.

Venn diagram analysis ( Figure 4B PCA demonstrated distinct transcriptional profiles and clear group separation among the control, saline, semaglutide, and tirzepatide groups, underscoring the transcriptomic impact of HFHFD and pharmacological interventions ( Figure 4C Figures 4D E Pon1 Cyp1a1 Il1b Egr2 Ryr2 Tfrc Ptger4 Hsd11b1 Camk2b Aacs Atp1a3 Atp1a3 Cyp1a1 Hsd11b1 Zbtb16 Ryr2 Atp1a3 Cyp1a1 Hsd11b1 Tfrc Il1b Ptger4 Tiam1 3.6 GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that DEGs were significantly overrepresented across biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MF), and cellular components (CC), indicating functional relevance at multiple cellular levels. In BAT following HFHFD intervention, DEGs were predominantly involved in BPs such as lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolic process, and lipid biosynthesis, which are closely associated with energy homeostasis in BAT. These results suggest a potential metabolic remodeling of BAT under HFHFD conditions, with an emphasis on lipid-handling pathways. In the semaglutide group, DEGs were primarily involved in lipid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, ATP biosynthesis, and oxidoreductase activity. This enrichment indicates that semaglutide may enhance lipid utilization and energy production in BAT, contributing to its metabolic benefits. In contrast, DEGs in the tirzepatide group were predominantly enriched in positive regulation of neutrophil extravasation, oxidoreductase activity, and NF-κB binding. These findings imply that tirzepatide may exert immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects alongside metabolic regulation, potentially contributing to improved metabolic homeostasis ( Figure 5A Figure 5 Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs in GO categories and KEGG pathways. (A) (B) p Six dot plot charts display gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. Chart A includes three sections: top GO terms comparing HHFHD-NS vs. CON, HHFHD-Semvas vs. HHFHD-NS, and HHFHD-TZP vs. HHFHD-NS, highlighting processes like lipid metabolism and cellular functions. Chart B includes KEGG enrichment for the same comparisons, showing pathways such as steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling, and cAMP signaling. Dots vary in size according to gene number and are colored by p-value, indicating significance levels. KEGG pathway analysis revealed distinct enrichment profiles of differentially expressed mRNAs across the experimental groups. The saline group demonstrated pronounced enrichment of multiple metabolic and signaling pathways—such as PPAR signaling, fatty acid elongation, steroid biosynthesis, and AMPK signaling—relative to the control group. This enrichment suggests notable changes in energy metabolism, inflammatory signaling, and apoptotic processes following HFHFD exposure. In the semaglutide group, DEGs were primarily enriched in pathways involved in inflammatory responses, metabolic control, and disease-associated signaling, implying that semaglutide may contribute to immune regulation and the maintenance of metabolic balance. Tirzepatide-associated DEGs showed significant enrichment in pathways regulating lipid and energy metabolism, glycolytic processes, and insulin signaling, supporting its potential role in restoring metabolic homeostasis and improving systemic energy regulation ( Figure 5B 3.7 PPI network analysis The PPI network constructed via STRING ( Figure 6A Ins Il6 Lep Pparg Tfrc Hsd11b1 Cyp1a1 Camk2b Gdf5 Ptger4 Il1b Il1b Figure 6 PPI network analysis and validation of gene expression by RT-qPCR.

This difference is likely attributable to multiple interrelated factors. First, the disparity in DEG counts should not be interpreted as a direct reflection of differences in pharmacological potency. The extent of transcriptomic changes does not necessarily correspond to the magnitude of metabolic improvement ( 30–32 9 33 Second, the dosing strategy in this study was based on prior high-quality research in similar mouse models, where the two agents were administered at non-equivalent doses (semaglutide 30 nmol/kg vs. tirzepatide 10 nmol/kg) ( 17–20 Third, DEG detection is influenced by sample size, within-group variability, between-group differences, and the statistical thresholds applied. Higher biological variability within the tirzepatide group could reduce the number of genes meeting statistical significance, even in the presence of true biological effects. PCA indicated partial overlap between the tirzepatide and saline groups, suggesting modest group separation and potentially reduced detection sensitivity. Furthermore, the statistical thresholds applied in this study were relatively stringent (FDR < 0.05 and |log₂FC| > 1); relaxing these cutoffs would increase the number of DEGs detected in the tirzepatide group. Finally, although euthanasia timing, tissue collection time, and ambient temperature were standardized to minimize experimental variability, subtle differences in sampling location or other technical factors cannot be entirely excluded as contributors to the observed results. In summary, the pronounced disparity in DEG counts between semaglutide and tirzepatide is best understood as the outcome of a multifactorial interplay involving (i) distinct pharmacological mechanisms and receptor selectivity, (ii) non-equivalent dosing and consequent differences in transcriptomic breadth, and (iii) biological as well as technical variability, rather than a straightforward difference in therapeutic potency. Previous studies have demonstrated that both semaglutide and tirzepatide improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse models ( 34 35 Transcriptomic analysis revealed that both semaglutide and tirzepatide upregulated the expression of Cyp1a1 Hsd11b1 Atp1a3 Cyp1a1 36 37 38 39 40 Cyp1a1 Hsd11b1 Hsd11b2 Hsd11b1 Hsd11b2 Hsd11b1 Hsd11b1 Hsd11b1 41 Hsd11b1 Hsd11b1 42 Ucp Pgc1α 43 Hsd11b1 Atp1a3 + + Atp1a3 44–46 Atp1a3 In addition to shared targets, tirzepatide uniquely modulated Tfrc Il1b Ptger4 Tfrc Tfrc 47–50 Tfrc Tfrc 51 Tfrc 52 Tfrc Il1b Ptger4 Il1b 53 Il1b Il1b 54 β 55 Il1b Il1b 56–58 Il1b As a receptor for prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), Ptger4 59 60 Ptger4 in vitro 61 Ptger4 Ptger4 α β Ptger4 62 Ptger4 KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the differentially expressed mRNAs were involved in several key signaling and metabolic pathways. The KEGG pathway findings demonstrated that transcripts elevated by semaglutide treatment were mainly associated with metabolic pathways involving energy production, amino acid turnover, lipid handling, and xenobiotic metabolism. In addition to metabolic pathways, the upregulated genes were also associated with signaling pathways governing cellular growth, survival, differentiation, and endocrine homeostasis. These changes may reflect enhanced metabolic activity, improved cellular adaptation to energy imbalance, and a potential shift toward immune activation or anti-infective defense mechanisms. The downregulated mRNAs were primarily associated with regulatory pathways such as PPAR, cGMP–PKG, AMPK, and RAAS signaling, potentially reflecting a reduction in overall cellular metabolic burden. Tirzepatide-induced upregulated mRNAs were primarily associated with pathways involved in metabolic regulation, signal transduction, and endocrine function, suggesting enhanced regulation of glucose homeostasis, calcium-phosphate metabolism, and anti-inflammatory processes. In comparison, the downregulated mRNAs in the tirzepatide group were predominantly enriched in signaling and cellular regulatory pathways, such as “inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, “potentially reflecting a suppression of inflammatory activity.

The relatively small number of samples may weaken the robustness of statistical inference and limit the generalizability of the results. It may also contribute to increased inter-sample variability, partly explaining the lower number of DEGs identified in the tirzepatide group compared to the semaglutide group. This study also focused exclusively on BAT; future investigations should incorporate multi-tissue transcriptomic analyses to capture systemic regulatory effects. Additionally, as this work was conducted in a mouse model, caution should be exercised when extrapolating the findings to humans, since notable interspecies differences in anatomical distribution, thermogenic activity, and pharmacological responsiveness of BAT may affect translational relevance despite functional similarities. Finally, although several candidate genes were identified, their precise mechanistic roles remain to be elucidated. Further functional studies, such as gene knockout or silencing, are warranted to confirm their relevance. Notably, the transcriptional alterations observed in BAT carry important translational implications. Human BAT activity has been linked to improved glucose homeostasis, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and reduced cardiometabolic risk. Our findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists may differentially regulate BAT function, potentially providing a molecular explanation for their distinct clinical effects. These insights underscore the possibility that BAT could serve not only as a therapeutic target of incretin-based interventions but also as a biomarker to inform individualized treatment strategies for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Future clinical studies integrating BAT activity imaging or molecular assessments will be essential to validate the applicability of these preclinical findings to human outcomes. 5 Conclusion This research provides further evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of semaglutide and tirzepatide in mitigating metabolic dysregulation in a diet-induced obesity mouse model.
