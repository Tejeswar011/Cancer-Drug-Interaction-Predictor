During 2012–2016, we received tissue specimens or whole carcasses of 4 dogs with variable enlargement of the thyroid glands. The 2 males and 2 females were of mixed (mongrel) inbreeding, 3–4.5-y-old. All tumors had lobulated architecture forming follicular structures variably containing colloid. On immunohistochemistry of the tumors from 3 of the dogs, 2 were thyroglobulin positive, and all 3 were negative for calcitonin, confirming follicular thyroid carcinoma in 2 of the dogs. Thyroid carcinomas have not been reported previously in related mongrel dogs, to our knowledge. canine immunohistochemistry thyroid tumor Trinidad & Tobago UWI Campus Research and Publication Fund CRP.3.MAR16.50 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes typesetter ts1 ",
