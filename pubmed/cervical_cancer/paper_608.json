Introduction In an era defined by escalating energy demands and the urgent need to address climate change, the pursuit of sustainable solutions stands at the forefront of scientific and technological innovation. Central to this endeavor is the development and deployment of sustainable materials with minimal environmental impact to revolutionize the way we generate, store, and consume energy. Energy material research encompasses diverse materials and technologies critical for addressing global energy challenges. Their applications span from solar panels and wind turbines to fuel cells, batteries, and energy-efficient building materials. Solar panels are moving silicon, III-V and II-VI compounds, and quantum dots [ 1 2 Wind turbines are constructed from recyclable steel, new alloys, composites, and even eco-friendly resins to harness wind power [ 3 Energy storage is also pivotal in achieving the EU’s climate neutrality targets. Notably, advances in nanomaterials and bidimensional (2D) materials have introduced sustainable options for energy harvesting and storage. There has been a growing focus on employing eco-sustainable biomass-derived biopolymers and native materials as a viable alternative to traditional energy storage applications. Biopolymer-based energy devices, like batteries, supercapacitors, electrode materials, and ion-exchange membranes, a novel and eco-conscious approach, hold great potential for flexible and smart electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices, owing to their affordability, environmental sustainability, and biodegradability [ 4 5 6 7 8 Phase-change materials (PCMs) made from bio-based fatty acids or salts are increasingly used in energy-efficient buildings for thermal energy storage [ 9 Research into lead-free piezoelectric ceramic materials can help convert mechanical stress into electrical voltage, enabling the harvesting of vibrational energy from ambient sources [ 10 Simultaneously, the exploitation of alternative resources has emphasized the strategic importance of molecular hydrogen (H 2 11 12 The development and modulation of these materials through appropriate fabrication and processing methods are indeed the Holy Grail for meeting current technological requirements and ensuring significant advancements from laboratory to industrial applications in the context of improved sustainability. This scenario could be achieved in the near future, provided that the developed materials and fabrication methods meet the criteria of eco-friendliness, reproducibility, integration with established industrial processes, and economic sustainability. This work aims to enlarge the current landscape of sustainable materials for energy, discussing ongoing activities related to the development of advanced materials and technologies for sustainable energy production, encompassing bulk systems, thin films, and nanostructures, as well as strategies for efficient energy production, conversion, and storage. By examining both recent breakthroughs and persistent critical challenges that hamper widespread adoption, such as scalability, cost, and integration with existing infrastructure, this study aims to illuminate the path toward a resilient and environmentally conscious energy future. The related issues are presented and discussed in different sections through the critical analysis of selected case studies summarized in Figure 1 Specifically, Section 2 Section 3 Section 4 Section 5 Section 6 Section 7 Section 8 Section 9 2. Carbon-Based Nanomaterials for Chemical Energy Conversion Energy conversion is a critical aspect of harnessing renewable energy, enabling its transformation into chemical energy and storage in the form of hydrogen produced by the electrochemical splitting of water. This stored energy can be utilized in devices such as fuel cells when needed. Recent advances have highlighted the importance of developing green electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water splitting. In this context, carbon-based nanomaterials are very attractive frontrunners due to their electrical, mechanical, and optical properties, easily tunable morphologies, high surface area, rich surface chemistry, multiple porosity, high thermal and chemical stabilities, and intrinsic low toxicity as well as for the green character and economic viability. While several papers have reported on the use of graphene, carbon nanotubes, and fullerenes for both energy storage and conversion [ 13 2.1. Biomass-Derived Carbon Dots for Solar Energy, Thermal Conversion, and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Carbon-based dots (CDs) are a class of fluorescent nanomaterials consisting of a carbon core with sizes below 10 nm enveloped by different surface functionalities. Their use has recently rapid expanded in energy production [ 14 15 16 17 18 15 16 19 20 This broad perspective of utilization is empowered by their favorable properties including high photostability, good water solubility, and intrinsic low toxicity [ 21 22 23 24 2 Figure 2 17 sc 2 sc 2 2 Figure 2 Furthermore, the integration of CDs into materials used in solar–thermal conversion improves the energy generation process [ 25 26 27 Figure 3 In addition, CDs are also employed as support for catalysts in HER and OER for water splitting [ 18 28 29 30 −1 −1 Moreover, it exhibited excellent stability in photocatalytic water splitting, maintaining a PHE rate of more than 38 mmol·h −1 −1 30 3 −2 −1 For all these applications, the preparation of cost-effective CDs represents a relevant aspect of their sustainability that can be achieved through the development of synthetic approaches spanning from hydrothermal/solvothermal to electrochemical, chemical, and microwave-assisted methods utilizing precursors derived from the recovery of biological and agro-industrial wastes. Recently, a considerable number of research efforts have been devoted to the development of sustainable synthesis approaches based on environmentally friendly precursors derived from biomass and biowaste, as well as the development of novel processes that are both efficient and do not require high levels of external energy [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 Figure 4 The obtained CDs exhibit an intense color evolution from blue to yellowish green depending on the employed acid additives. This CDs’ fluorescence emission has been proven to increase the conversion efficiency of C-dot-sensitized solar cells. In a recent study [ 36 Figure 4 2.2. Nanoarchitectures Based on gCN for Sustainable Energy Production In the ever-increasing search for economically viable, environmentally friendly, and Vis-light-active photoelectrocatalysts for sustainable energy generation, graphitic carbon nitride (gCN), a 2D metal-free n 41 42 43 E G 44 45 46 47 Figure 5 48 49 50 Figure 5 51 52 53 Herein, we focus on the most relevant characteristics of representative systems belonging to categories (a) and (b), along with their performances in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the bottleneck of water splitting for yielding green hydrogen [ 48 49 50 51 In the course of our studies on gCN-based electrocatalysts, we have initially focused our attention on the functionalization of supported gCN with a minimum amount of complementary Co-containing catalysts capable of enhancing the ultimate OER photoactivity ( Figure 5 48 Figure 6 x 2 4 x 54 55 Figure 6 2 4 p n Figure 6 2 4 Figure 6 48 In an alternative approach, a straightforward preparation route to gCN OER photoelectrocatalysts supported on flexible carbon cloths, integrating highly dispersed NiO as co-catalyst, involved a single-step electrophoretic process (see Figure 5 50 56 p n Figure 6 Figure 6 50 Figure 6 post-operando 50 57 A relevant example in this regard is Fe 2 3 2 3 The resulting materials possessed a porous lamellar morphology with a high active area that did not undergo any relevant modification after functionalization with gCN ( Figure 7 49 50 Figure 7 Figure 7 2 3 2 3 2 3 51 These results, along with the system long-term stability, improved by gCN introduction ( Figure 7 3. Phase-Change Materials as Innovative Approach to Thermal Energy Storage Thermal energy storage (TES) systems stock thermal energy by heating or cooling a storage medium. TES technologies include sensible heat storage, latent heat storage, and thermochemical energy storage. These methods store energy as heat in various mediums such as water, molten salt, or phase-change materials (PCMs). Among these, latent heat storage (LHS) involves PCMs that absorb or release energy during phase changes, such as solid-to-liquid, liquid-to-gas, or solid-to-solid transitions, as schematized in Figure 8 Figure 8 3.1. New Frontiers by Moderate-to-High-Temperature Metallic Phase-Change Materials LHS PCMs can be sorted into different categories according to the three main criteria of chemical nature, phase change state, and temperature range of phase transition, T m Table 1 T m T m Jankowski et al. [ 59 The optimal properties for different types of PCMs include not only high latent heat and thermal stability, but also low corrosion, non-toxicity, no supercooling, non-flammability, and low cost [ 60 For medium-to-high temperatures, molten salts including alkali metal nitrates, nitrites, and their mixtures are among the most used PCMs [ 61 In this context, metallic PCMs (m-PCMs) are of interest for the medium-to-high temperature range thanks to the high thermal conductivity that can provide fast thermal response. m-PCM are considered as a favorable choice due to their thermal conductivity at least two orders of magnitude higher than that of molten salts [ 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 The primary challenge impeding the utilization of metal-based phase-change materials (m-PCMs) in thermal energy storage (TES) applications is the necessity for adequate confinement during their liquid state. Liquid metals exhibit high corrosivity towards numerous materials. Additionally, the solid–liquid phase transitions are accompanied by volumetric changes, which can induce significant mechanical stresses on the containment media during thermal cycling. To harness the potential of m-PCMs, recent research has concentrated on developing an optimal combination of m-PCMs and their respective containers. Various fabrication methodologies are currently being explored to produce efficient and user-friendly m-PCMs. A comprehensive list of proposed production strategies is presented Table 2 Three main strategies are pursued, as represented in Figure 9 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 The predominant method for producing m-PCMs involves encapsulating small quantities of PCM within capsules, thereby ensuring the effective containment of the liquid phase. Encapsulation is advantageous for latent heat storage due to its increased heat transfer area and protection against environmental fluctuations. Various encapsulation techniques exist, with macro-encapsulation (capsule size > 1 mm) and micro-encapsulation (capsule size between 1 µm and 1 mm) being commonly employed. Micro-encapsulation, compared to macro-encapsulation, offers a faster charging/discharging rate due to the reduced heat transfer distance [ 89 90 Encapsulating metallic PCMs present challenges due to the high chemical corrosion of liquid metals with most potential shell materials and volume expansion during phase transition from solid to liquid. The former issue necessitates the use of inert or ceramic-based coatings, while the latter is more significant for PCMs that transition at high temperatures, especially if encapsulated in their solid form at temperatures significantly lower than the operational range. Consequently, container selection must consider sufficient tensile strength and toughness to withstand thermal stresses induced by PCM volume expansion. Most encapsulation processes involve multistep procedures, starting with PCM preparation followed by deposition on the material forming the capsule. These processes can be costly in terms of preparation time and production expenses, limiting the widespread adoption of encapsulated PCMs [ 78 79 80 82 The limits of the previous two approaches foster the research for containerless methods that take advantage of the formation of different phases in suitable metallic alloys, where one phase melts at a considerably lower temperature than the others. The latter is the active (PCM) phase. The first studies were performed by Sugo et al. [ 83 Figure 10 83 86 87 More recently, casting processes were proposed, for the production of Al-Sn-based alloys with proper microstructures. Also, advanced 3D printing proved to be quite an effective alternative to produce form-stable m-PCMs with isolated active-phase particles [ 86 We propose that the use of a commercial Al alloy as a substitute of pure aluminum increased the number of microstructural constituents in the system, with a more complex arrangement. Promising results in terms of thermal stability of the produced material were obtained for the investigated Al-Sn based alloys, as confirmed by repeated differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses across the melting temperature range of the low-melting phase. Moreover, the evolution of the microstructural features and phase distributions with thermal cycling was monitored through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Finally, advanced 3D printing also proved to be quite an effective alternative to produce form-stable m-PCMs with isolated active-phase particles, opening a new frontier on tailored shaping of m-PCMs. Thus, the multitude of processes presented clearly highlight the intense research on m-PCM, on a multitude of materials, sizes, shapes, and temperatures, that can fulfill the requirements of a variety of specific applications. Research is ongoing on the widening of the types of Al alloys considered and exploring the processability window for such materials by numerical analysis and experimental evaluation. 3.2. Phase-Change Material Emulsions for Thermal Energy Storage and Phase Change Materials in Buildings Heating and cooling in European buildings and industry account for half of the EU’s energy consumption [ 91 92 93 94 T i T f ∆ h t o t a l e ,  P C M E = ∫ T i T f c p d T + ∆ h l a t e n t ∫ T i T f c p d T h latent Figure 11 Currently, some challenges hinder the large-scale exploitation of PCMEs, such as the colloidal instability due to thermodynamic reasons (coalescence, creaming, flocculation, etc.). Various papers have investigated strategies for improving stability or developing preparation methods that increase the emulsion stability with the solvent-assisted method [ 95 96 97 Figure 12 The applications of PCMEs in the energy sector are numerous, spanning solar–thermal and photovoltaic systems or solar–thermal–electric conversion [ 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 Figure 13 106 The application of LHTES in buildings has many advantages including the ability to narrow the gap between the peak and off-peak loads of energy demand, by storing solar energy during the day, and releasing it at night, thus reducing daytime temperature fluctuation, improving the degree of thermal comfort, and reducing cooling costs. In general, LHTES increases the thermal inertia of building components. Therefore, PCMEs have been incorporated into wall materials such as gypsum wallboards and concrete to enhance the thermal energy storage capacity of buildings with particular interest in passive solar applications, peak load shifting, etc. [ 106 107 Figure 14 108 Some simulations evaluated the effects of the application of PCMs in different building positions on the energy consumption of a building in a hot-dry climatic region, always reducing energy consumption [ 109 Concerning PCMs’ use in insulating materials, some studies have been conducted on the thermal characterization of PCM in polyurethane (PU), a commercial material used for insulating components [ 110 111 Figure 15 Some studies have also reported the investigation of PCM/geopolymer composites in construction materials [ 112 Thus, thermal energy storage based on LHTES, and more specifically on PCMEs, offers the potential to optimize energy use in various sectors. PCMEs have shown significant potential in improving heat transfer in fluids for heating and cooling applications. Despite their benefits, PCMs face challenges that must be addressed for their widespread adoption related to (i) finding a proper way to disperse PCMs in geopolymers and to reduce composite costs, (ii) improving colloidal stability, (iii) addressing supercooling, and (iv) developing effective encapsulation techniques to contain leaks and improve thermal conductivity. As research and development continue to address challenges and explore new possibilities, PCM emulsions are poised to play a crucial role in achieving energy efficiency and sustainability in the years to come. 4. Thin Films for Hydrogen Energy Technologies Scientific advances in materials play a key role in the transition toward hydrogen sustainable energy systems. Thin-film technologies offer a promising avenue for the development of efficient, cost-effective, and scalable hydrogen energy solutions. These films, characterized by their thickness on the nanometer to micrometer scale, have found applications across the entire hydrogen energy value chain, from production and storage to conversion and utilization. Here, we focus on our recent research on hydrogen barrier coatings and hydrogen permeation membranes that are expected to become crucial in promoting effective hydrogen storage and transportation in the future. 4.1. Nitride Thin Films as Hydrogen Permeation Barriers: An Advanced Solution for Hydrogen Embrittlement Prevention In the hydrogen storage and transportation sector, the development of barrier systems for reducing hydrogen embrittlement (HE) of structural materials is becoming of paramount importance, which may compromise their mechanical integrity with increased susceptibility to cracking, severely jeopardizing structural integrity, especially in tanks and pipelines. Steel, aluminum, magnesium, and titanium alloys may experience HE, which could be mitigated by blocking or limiting hydrogen diffusion inside the material by applying suitable coatings, acting as hydrogen permeation barriers (HPBs). Concerning materials, polymeric films produced by thermal spraying are promising HPBs: even though polymers present poor mechanical strength, their low hydrogen permeability values are attractive [ 113 114 115 3 4 116 117 x 118 119 2 120 121 122 123 124 125 Creating effective TiAl/TiAlN multilayer coatings requires precision engineering and advanced manufacturing techniques. Physical vapor deposition processes such as DC magnetron sputtering and high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) [ 118 126 20 −3 Controlling the microstructure of the multilayer system is essential to achieve the desired barrier properties. Parameters such as layer thickness, composition, and interface quality are carefully tailored. As an example, DCMS samples of FIB cross-sections of a TiAl-TiAlN bilayer ( Figure 16 Figure 16 127 Figure 16 Figure 16 128 Figure 16 129 130 131 Figure 16 Figure 16 Figure 16 Figure 16 Finally, in general, it must be considered that amorphous films have better barrier properties than crystalline ones. An additional improvement can be obtained by adding elements such as Si, which contribute to obtaining a quasi-amorphous film, thus exhibiting a low structural order at medium and long ranges. Despite their promising attributes, TiAl/TiAlN coatings face challenges such as cost, scalability, and optimization. Thus, research efforts are focused on improving their mechanical robustness and chemical stability. Furthermore, scaling up the production of high-quality multilayer thin films for industrial applications remains a challenge. As research progresses and manufacturing techniques improve, these coatings are poised to play an even greater role in ensuring the safety and longevity of hydrogen-exposed materials. 4.2. Metallic Thin Films as Separation Membranes for Hydrogen Energy Hydrogen production from fossil fuels is mainly achieved through steam reforming, which generates a gaseous mixture rich in H 2 2 132 133 134 135 136 Figure 17 To further reduce the use of critical raw materials and membrane costs, partial or total replacement of palladium is a prospect to be pursued, and much research is ongoing on this topic. Some group IV and V metals, such as vanadium, show high hydrogen permeability but, if uncontrolled, their huge solubility can compromise mechanical stability (embrittlement). Several vanadium-based alloys have been tested to substitute Pd-based membranes [ 137 138 139 140 141 64 36 142 2 143 The magnetron sputtering technique also enables the deposition of a selective non-noble layer and of a thin protective and catalytic film in a single vacuum stage, preventing oxidation at the interface. Therefore, some studies investigated the use of HiPIMS for the deposition of multilayers on top of porous substrates as membranes for hydrogen separation with a very low content of palladium. Some examples that have demonstrated suitable permeability and selectivity values, combined with resistance to hydrogen embrittlement, are Pd/V 93 7 144 x y z w 145 Figure 18 x y z w Thus, developing efficient and cost-effective methods for producing metallic thin films at scale is a critical area of research. Implementing surface modifications to improve resistance to poisoning and the embrittlement of these multicomponent layers make them a promising solution as membranes that play a pivotal role in the global transition to a hydrogen-based energy economy. 5. Ferroelectric Ceramics and Composites as Transformative Approach to Energy Storage and Harvesting Electrostatic capacitors, particularly relaxor ferroelectric (RFE) ceramics, are one of the most common classes of energy storage systems due to their high-power density and rapid charge/discharge capabilities. Their potential for high-voltage applications and integration into portable electronics makes them attractive; however, enhancing their energy density remains crucial for broader applications, as shown in Figure 19 3 4+ 4+ 4+ 4+ 146 147 148 149 150 By targeting the crossover between FE and RFE behavior, significant improvements in energy storage density have been achieved. Yuan et al. [ 151 −3 −1 0.86 0.14 0.79 0.11 0.10 3 0.65 0.35 3 2/3 1/3 3 −3 rec −3 −1 152 To further enhance performance, especially breakdown strength (BDS), several strategies have been explored. As porosity and defects cause electrical failure, increasing ceramic density using sintering aids, core–shell particles, or composites with insulating phases like SiO 2 153 2 5 rec −3 −1 3 1–0.015x 0.015x 3+0.015x 2/3 1/3 145 154 Recently, record performance was achieved using in situ phase separation in the composition (0.6–x)(Bi 0.5 0.5 3 3 3 rec −3 −1 155 Improving energy storage performance remains a key challenge for bulk perovskite ceramics and a number of strategies have been exploited. Trends toward replacing expensive noble metal electrodes (Pt-, Ag-based) with base metals (Ni, Cu) necessitate a deeper understanding of ceramic/electrode interfaces [ 156 For flexible electronics, ceramics brittleness is a limitation. Polymer–ceramic composites offer a solution by combining the flexibility, durability, and high BDS (1500–5000 kV cm −1 157 Lead-free ceramics like BT, (Bi 0.5 0.5 3 3 x γ 1–γ 3 158 33 −1 −1 151 The performance of polymer–ceramic composites can be tailored to specific applications through microstructure engineering, primarily via the careful selection of filler composition, morphology, and surface modification (e.g., core–shell structures or functionalization) [ 159 160 161 In these composites, permittivity generally increases with the volume fraction of inorganic fillers. For example, adding 30 vol.% BT can yield permittivity values between 20 and 40, depending on processing, particles synthesis, and functionalization methods [ 162 33 −1 −1 163 164 Particle size and dispersion are critical. Small particles (~100 nm) enhance interfacial interactions and polarization but often agglomerate, while larger particles (>1 μm) may improve dielectric properties at the cost of flexibility and processability [ 165 166 Filler morphology also plays a key role. Huang et al. demonstrated that composites containing BT nanofibers achieved higher breakdown strength (BDS = 691.9 kV mm −1 −1 167 155 165 To address this, Padurariu et al. [ 168 2 2 Figure 20 2 4 154 Enhancing the piezoelectric performance of polymer–ceramic composites can be effectively achieved through processing techniques such as electrospinning and patterning, which enable precise control over the alignment of fillers and polymer chains ([ 169 33 170 Texturing strategies for lead-free materials aimed at flexible energy harvesting and sensing applications have also been demonstrated [ 171 172 A notable example is the work of Athira et al. [ 173 −2 Additionally, 3D printing has emerged as an advanced fabrication method that allows accurate control over composite architecture and filler distribution, fostering innovation in composite performance, sustainability, and material design [ 174 Ongoing research focuses on improving the understanding of ceramic–polymer interfacial phenomena and clarifying the interdependence between composition, microstructure, and properties to unlock further performance gains in these multifunctional materials. 6. Metallic Materials for Energy Applications Metallic materials are indispensable in a wide array of energy-related applications due to their unique properties, such as high thermal and electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance. These materials are integral to conventional energy systems, including fossil fuels and nuclear power, as well as emerging renewable energy technologies, such as wind, solar, and hydrogen energy. The selection, design, and optimization of metallic materials are critical to improving the efficiency, longevity, and sustainability of these energy systems, and some examples are discussed below. 6.1. Cu-Based Alloys Manufactured by Additive Manufacturing for Advanced Heat Exchangers Metals such as copper and aluminum exhibit excellent thermal conductivity, facilitating heat transfer in systems like power plants and heat exchangers. Additive manufacturing (AM) is an advanced manufacturing method, which allows the achievement of 3D complex structures through a layer-by-layer strategy. Among AM technologies, the most widespread one in the industrial environment is Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), which relies on a laser beam scanning a powder bed for the material consolidation. In the energy field, Ni alloys, such as Inconel 625 and 718, and Al ones, such as AlSi10Mg, are well-consolidated materials to be fabricated using the LPBF process, while nowadays the most novel achievements are oriented to the development of novel structures in pure Cu and Cu-based alloys for thermal management systems. In this case, the design for AM can offer unique opportunities for producing high-performance heat exchangers, thanks to the high degree of geometrical complexity as well as the high surface-to-volume ratio that can be reached by adopting AM production [ 175 176 Figure 21 Laser material processing, including LPBF, of pure Cu and Cu-based alloys represents a considerable technological challenge, due to the low absorption coefficient of such alloys under laser irradiation as well as their high thermal conductivity. To tackle such limitations, two main strategies are investigated, i.e., (i) the development of Cu alloys with novel chemical compositions, with the main scope of improving the LPBF processability for high-quality parts, and (ii) the exploration of different laser sources, emitting the radiation far from the infrared (IR) field, which is typically used for processing metals, but is not able to offer acceptable absorption values for highly reflective materials. For instance, CuZrCr and CuCrNb alloys are promising for their good balance between processability and functional properties. Figure 22 178 The most recognized approach is oriented to the use of green or blue lasers that exhibit a high absorption for highly reflective materials [ 178 179 180 Figure 22 The microstructure of LPBFed (Laser Powder Bed Fusion) Cu alloys typically exhibits fine grains due to the rapid solidification induced by the laser process. In the as-built condition, the grains are oriented along the building direction, which can be observed in the microstructure images in Figure 23 181 The mechanical properties of LPBFed Cu alloys can be tuned by heat treatments, which promote precipitation phenomena that strengthen the material, as shown in Figure 24 Figure 25 184 The quality of manufactured parts significantly influences both mechanical and thermal/electrical performance, contingent upon the presence of residual pores and cracks. Consequently, the manufacturing process plays a critical role in determining the final performance of the components. It can be inferred that the in-service performance of LPBFed copper heat exchangers can be markedly enhanced by the design flexibility afforded by the additive manufacturing (AM) process and the selection of appropriate post-processing thermal treatments. Specifically, aging treatments offer a synergistic enhancement of both mechanical strength, due to the precipitation of secondary phases, and thermal conductivity, owing to the depletion of alloying elements from the copper matrix. Future research should focus on the development of novel alloys based on elements with low solubility/miscibility relative to the face-centered cubic copper phase. 6.2. Ductile Iron Castings as an Opportunity for Wind Energy Wind energy represents a renewable, reliable, and environmentally sustainable power source that is rapidly expanding to mitigate CO 2 185 186 Its durability results in fewer replacements and repairs, thereby reducing overall expenses and enhancing sustainability. Additionally, DI is fully recyclable, promoting further sustainability by minimizing raw material usage and the carbon footprint of production. Table 3 Table 4 Material Quality Indexes (MQIs) for foundry products are designed to classify materials and their integrity, and they should be obtained from the basic tensile mechanical properties, because tensile testing is the most used and immediate testing method to characterize materials. About cast irons, one of the first MQI proposed by Siefer and Ortis and later developed by Crews in 1974 [ 187 m 2 188 m 2 m However, an effective microstructure quality assessment should uniquely classify the matrix grade (ideal microstructure) based on composition and production route—limitations that MQI-based methods do not address. Indeed, an innovative mathematic procedure using Voce equation-based diagrams [ 189 190 191 192 Considering the relevance of mechanical behavior of DIs, we focus herein on innovative mathematical methods to correlate mechanical behavior with defects. This helps develop process–microstructure–properties relationships to assess from one side material integrity and the production routes of these materials, thus reducing the waste production, and from another side, to predict the lifetime of DIs, contributing to more sustainable, long-lasting solutions in the renewable energy production. The proposed method to assess the integrity of DIs focuses on analyzing tensile flow curves with the dislocation-density-related Voce equation [ 180 181 σ σ v σ o σ V ε p ε c σ ε p σ V ε c σ V σ o d σ ε p Θ o σ ε c Θ o ε c Θ o ε c Θ o ε c In DI castings, defects like degenerated graphite, namely exploded, spiky, or chunky graphite (CHG), inclusions, gas, and shrinkage porosity can severely impact the integrity of the cast components and reduce their mechanical properties, including tensile strength, ductility, fatigue resistance, and fracture toughness. In heavy section components, like the ones used in wind turbines, degenerated graphite can be even more dramatic, significantly affecting their performance in the application. Therefore, production control and the establishment of new reliable procedures for integrity assessment of heavy sections are even more critical. An example of nodular and degenerated chunky graphite observed on the polished section and fracture surface of a GJS400 cast can be seen in Figure 26 Figure 27 Figure 27 Figure 27 Furthermore, the use of MAD as an integrity assessment tool has been validated to effectively classify DIs by the silicon content, namely 2.5%, 3.5%, and 4.5% Si. With the silicon content higher than 3.0% wt, high-silicon strengthened ductile irons (HSSDI) are fully ferritic, making them cost-effective due to the elimination of heat treatment processes. Additionally, they are characterized by a narrow hardness range, which enhances their machinability. Figure 27 Figure 27 The same approach has also been used for innovative IDIs [ 193 S Figure 28 Thus, the studies conducted on ferritic spheroidal ductile irons (DIs), high-strength spheroidal ductile irons (HSSDIs), and innovative ductile irons (IDIs) have demonstrated the efficacy of Voce-based analysis as a robust assessment tool for evaluating the integrity and quality of castings. This analytical approach facilitates the production of cast components with enhanced durability, thereby promoting a sustainable methodology within the wind energy sector. The utilization of IDIs, characterized by their amalgamation of strength, flexibility, and economic viability, is pivotal as the global energy landscape transitions towards greener solutions. Therefore, we envisage the integration of such innovative materials as essential for ensuring the efficiency, longevity, and sustainability of wind energy systems. 6.3. Relevance of Material Design for Power Generation—Case Study of Ni-Based Alloys by Casting In most power plants, fuel is burned to generate heat to drive steam for turbines. The conditions in boiler steam turbines and heat exchangers are relatively harsh, and the selected materials need to have the characteristics of heat resistance, high temperature resistance, and high creep resistance. A large number of favorable combinations of properties, such as excellent high-temperature mechanical properties, good oxidation and corrosion resistance, and ability to withstand extreme temperatures and high stress levels, make Ni-based alloys particularly suitable for power generation [ 194 195 196 197 193 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 During the last sixty years, different types of Ni-based superalloys have been developed and grouped into series based on their composition, such as NIMONIC, INCONEL, HASTELLOY, CMSX, RENÉ, TMS, MC, INCOLOY, etc. [ 209 210 A l N i γ The most common approach to achieve a broad range of applications in materials science with high performance levels is material design. Its methodology involves a series of steps, iterations, and periodic feedbacks between theory, experiment, and computations, making it possible to perform investigation based on a quadriade “composition–processing–microstructure–properties” [ 211 212 213 214 215 Figure 29 In alloy design, the role of the CALPHAD method is twofold: for the calculations of thermodynamic functions of mixing (the enthalpy, activity, integral and partial Gibbs energies) as well as for the assessment of phase diagrams aimed to determine thermodynamic stability of a system by means of its lowest energy or chemical equilibrium with its environment and/or be used as the part of models describing the thermophysical properties like the surface tension and viscosity. Therefore, models predicting the thermophysical properties of Ni-based alloys as functions of composition have been developed in the framework of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and hard sphere-like theory. The preliminary analysis of the experimental data on the surface tension and viscosity, used to validate the existing models, indicates that the surface properties of Ni-based alloys can be properly described using the compound formation model (CFM) [ 216 217 Among the thermophysical properties of liquid Ni-based superalloys, we also measured the surface tension, using the sessile (SD) and large drop (LD) container-based experimental methods [ 218 219 220 Figure 30 221 222 223 224 Figure 30 g 219 μ-g All the experimental surface tension data were used for the validation of the theoretical models. In order to identify the potential sources of systematic error and to arrive at the best-agreed-upon values, round robin measurements of the same property in different laboratories and with different methods or equipment have been performed. Results on the surface tension measurements and modeling of liquid Ni-based superalloys alloys are shown in Figure 30 Table 5 7. Amphiphobic Coatings for Environmental Protection of Solar Panels Among the various practical applications of renewable energy, photovoltaic (PV) systems have become the main way to utilize solar energy due to their high efficiency, safety, and environmental friendliness [ 225 226 227 Figure 31 228 Therefore, there is an urgent need to maintain the conversion efficiency of the PV through effective techniques such as reducing reflectivity and dust deposition. To cope with such a scenario, implementing surfaces with highly water-repellent coatings, with superhydrophobic and amphiphobic properties, offers a potential solution, as their self-cleaning ability helps minimize the accumulation of dirt and debris. For solar panels, amphiphobic and self-cleaning coatings must be both transparent and long-lasting to reduce the need for human intervention and maintenance while ensuring high efficiency. In recent years, nanostructured superhydrophobic (SHS) coatings (water contact angle >150°) with high optical transparency (85–95%) have been developed to enhance self-cleaning and optical performance of photovoltaic (PV) modules. Here, we provide key elements of the application of amphiphobic, high-transmittance, self-cleaning coating solutions in Figure 32 230 In order to obtain a superhydrophobic surface, we followed different routes, namely working on surface energy by exploring novel materials and on its surface morphology and roughness. As transparency is linked to light scattering, which increases with surface roughness, surface roughness is generally kept below 100 nm to minimize scattering. However, working with modulating material surface roughness does not always result in highly transparent superhydrophobic and amphiphobic coatings [ 231 Exploring materials to tailor surface energy usually involves toxic fluorine-containing materials with low surface energy, which inevitably raises health and environ mental concerns and increases production costs. As an example, a coating was developed using the aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), achieving a CA of 168.3° with excellent optical transparency (92% at 350 nm, stable across the visible range), and remarkable durability against sand impact and water droplet erosion [ 232 Jeong et al. [ 233 234 235 236 237 2 3 Figure 33 Although anti-smudge coatings for photovoltaic glass have advanced, their mechanical durability and corrosion resistance remain inadequate. Therefore, in the field of anti-reflective coatings and anti-smudge surfaces, it is crucial to concentrate on several key research areas, including engineering multilayer coatings, coatings that integrate multiple functions (e.g., anti-reflection, anti-smudge, anti-icing, and self-healing), and designing gradient refractive index structures and introducing crosslinking agents. Given the worldwide spread of large solar plants, the potential commercial upscale of such self-cleaning and transparent coatings is highly demanded. Their comparatively low cost and easy-to-maintain features make them good candidates, provided that the present limitations, like durability data, can be overcome in the long term. 8. Life Cycle Assessment Applied to the AlTiN Case Study Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a comprehensive quantitative method designed to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of energy materials throughout a product’s entire life cycle. A “cradle-to-grave” approach considers all production phases, from the extraction of raw materials to production, transport, and distribution, all the way to its use phase and eventual end of life, which includes waste treatment and potential recycling. A distinct, yet common, approach, often applied in scientific research, is the “cradle-to-gate” analysis. This approach specifically aims to pinpoint environmentally critical steps during the development of new production or synthesis routes, omitting the use and end-of-life phases from its scope. Literature studies demonstrated the importance of an early environmental evaluation for a new material development, also at the laboratory scale, permitting to minimize the final impact in the case of a pilot and industrial upscaling [ 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 Here, we show the example of LCA applied to an experimental campaign involving the materials presented in Section 4 247 Section 4 248 2 The life cycle impact assessment method applied was environmental footprint (EF) 2.0. The complete inventory analysis of this work can be found in ref. [ 249 Figure 34 The most impacting activity was in the “Vacuum” system, followed by the “Cooling” and “Cleaning” phases; their relevance was confirmed by the single score values (characterized results after normalization and weighting) shown in Figure 35 As similarly reported in previous studies [ 250 251 252 Thus, several materials have a high potential to be the resources of the energy of the future. However, despite these great prognostics for sustainable materials, LCA demonstrated that they are not necessarily environmental-impact-neutral, and their potential to be less-energy consuming or less-polluting than other materials must be assessed considering each specific case by means of tools like LCA. 9. Recycle and Reuse of Materials for Energy The concept of circularity must be applied to all materials for energy, as the deployment of solar panels, energy storage and conversion systems, and wind turbines increases and the end-of-life management of these components becomes increasingly pressing. The presented materials for energy comprise a wide range of materials that intersect with the topic of life cycle of materials. Most of the described solutions are in an early stage of development; nonetheless, the topic of how these materials will be implemented in the energy value chain and to which extent they will affect the overall carbon footprint of the specific application are already taken into consideration, by applying the LCA (as performed in the previous section) at the laboratory scale. The material recovery and reclamation by mechanical and chemical processes are simpler when the material is used as such in the energy devices (e.g., silicon in solar panels), as they can be reclaimed and reintroduced in the same supply chain. Refurbishment and remanufacturing are criteria applied to wind turbines, where wind turbine blades can be repaired and refitted. As wind energy grows, finding a way to chemically deconstruct and reuse the composites in wind turbine blades and effectively recycle structural materials is a serious concern and very energy-intensive; hence, more efforts to study the recycling and reuse of the wind turbine blades are essential. In these frameworks, metals, which we have been described in Section 3 Section 4 Section 6 As for the materials reported in Section 2 23 253 Figure 36 In light of all the above considerations and the significant interest shown by the scientific community in adopting the principle of circular economy when developing materials for energy, recycling and reuse will be a challenging aspect of future research studies on these materials. Indeed, it must also be said that the scientific challenges pertaining to the burden of cost play a crucial part in the advancement of recycling materials used in renewable energy and energy storage systems. 10. Conclusions and Perspectives The escalating global energy demand and the imperative for decarbonization necessitate innovative solutions to enhance energy efficiency, manage carbon emissions, reduce the costs of renewable energy, and develop scalable technologies for integrating renewables into the energy distribution system. Global cooperation and policy support are essential for addressing environmental challenges and ensuring long-term sustainability. Here, we have provided some examples of new energy storage and conversion materials that present several key benefits, offering promising methods to tackle challenges related to energy generation, on-demand supply, pollution remediation, and advanced manufacturing with minimized costs and environmental footprints. Despite significant advancements in PCM research and applications, further research is required to advance thermal energy storage technologies, which are crucial for achieving climate neutrality goals and ensuring a more flexible, efficient, and sustainable energy system. The adoption of ductile iron castings in the wind energy industry represents a step towards making renewable energy more accessible, reliable, and resilient. Continued innovation and collaboration could position ductile iron as a cornerstone material in the pursuit of a sustainable planet. While ferroelectric nanocomposites for energy storage show promise, challenges such as ensuring consistent nanoscale morphology, optimizing composite compositions, and addressing interface compatibility issues remain. Additionally, developing scalable and cost-effective fabrication methods and processes is necessary for their commercial viability. To rationally select a technology, the capital and operation costs and life cycle assessment of the whole technical system must be considered. As for the commercial exploitation of the proposed materials, the following considerations provide a perspective on their market: The synthetic approaches of C-based nanostructures are still limited to the laboratory scale; consequently, the commercialization of CDs is limited to few companies that offer small amounts of customized CDs for laboratory applications in their catalogues. Applications of PCMs are traditionally dominated by the use of organic compounds and inorganic salts. However, the recent commercial developments and industrial applications of metallic PCMs are focused on specific sectors, where their unique thermal properties could provide significant advantages. As an example, they can be employed in the energy storage at high temperature in concentrated solar power plants or for the recovery of waste industrial heat generated by metallurgical or cement plants. Moreover, metallic PCMs can be integrated into power-to-heat technologies that store the excess electricity by transforming it into thermal energy. As for ferroelectric materials, although they offer valuable properties for both commercial and domestic applications, their target market faces significant challenges, primarily due to the high costs of raw materials and complex production processes that hinder widespread adoption. Additionally, strict environmental regulations, especially concerning lead-based compounds, are driving the shift toward more environmentally sustainable alternatives, influencing market dynamics. To address current challenges, ongoing research is also increasingly focused on cost-effective, eco-friendly solutions, such as ferroelectric composites, for next-generation applications in flexible electronics, sensors, and energy-efficient systems, promoting a more scalable and sustainable evolution within this emerging market segment. Geopolitical instability, fluctuations in raw material prices, and logistics bottlenecks can affect the timely delivery and cost of cast iron components. The trend toward ever-larger wind turbines drives demand for correspondingly larger castings, pushing the technical limits of foundry capabilities. As for commercialization pathways of the metallic-based systems for hydrogen barriers and membranes, the key factors to be considered are that barrier layers produced by PVD or CVD require that these processes are scaled for larger components and more complex geometries; cost considerations could also be perceived as a barrier to commercial exploitation; however, while initial costs may be higher than for traditional coatings, the durability and performance benefits are proving attractive in demanding environments. Furthermore, standardization and certification have to be addressed to certify intermetallic-based materials for use in critical infrastructure, ensuring reliability and interoperability. Given the worldwide spread of large solar plants, the potential commercial upscale such self-cleaning of transparent coatings is highly demanding. Their comparatively low cost and easy-to-maintain features make them good candidates, provided that the present limitations, like durability data, can be overcome in the long term. In conclusion, the selection of energy technologies must consider capital and operational costs, commercialization potential, and the life cycle assessment of the entire technical system. Looking ahead, several emerging trends and research directions are evident from these contributions. The integration of artificial intelligence with material design, the development of multifunctional materials for energy applications, and the optimization of sustainable production methods represent particularly promising avenues for future research. Furthermore, the principles of a circular economy—repair, reuse, and recycling of materials—should be integrated into energy technology development to enhance sustainability. Despite the remaining challenges, researchers are diligently working to overcome obstacles by developing better materials. Effective energy management significantly impacts global warming and human health, necessitating continuous attention from policymakers to sustain strategies for achieving both economic growth and climate protection coordinated internationally. Clearly, this is not a journey that scientists should undertake alone. Effective energy management has a significant impact on global warming and human health, necessitating continuous attention from policymakers to sustain strategies for achieving both economic growth and climate protection.
