Background/purpose Cervical lymph node metastasis represents a critical prognostic factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); however, early-stage or subtle metastases often pose diagnostic challenges under conventional microscopy. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising solutions to enhance diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This study aimed to evaluate the extent to which AI-assisted tools can improve diagnostic performance and efficiency in the detection of cervical lymph node metastases. Materials and methods Sixty-six hematoxylin-eosin-stained slides containing 621 lymph nodes from oral SCC cases were digitized. Four participants (two oral pathologists, one postgraduate year (PGY) resident, one fourth-year dental student) reviewed slides with and without the AI-assistant tool. Diagnostic accuracy and interpretation time were compared. Results AI assistance significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency across different participants. False positives and false negatives decreased notably, especially for junior participants. Review time was also significantly shortened for negative and macrometastatic slides ( P P Conclusion The AI-assisted tool improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in detecting cervical lymph node metastases in oral SCC. It may serve as a preliminary screening tool and a valuable educational aid for training junior pathologists, underscoring its potential for broader application in digital pathology.

However, early-stage or subtle metastasis can be challenging to detect due to the small number of tumor cells and their frequent obscuration by surrounding lymphoid tissue. This may lead to diagnostic errors, even among experienced pathologists. Recent advances in AI have led to the development of AI-assisted tools that help detect micrometastases (<2 mm, ≥0.2 mm) hidden within lymph nodes. For example, the Taiwan-based company aetherAI has developed a platform known as “aetherAI-LNMD-GA,” which is specifically designed to support pathologists in identifying subtle metastatic foci of gastric cancer in lymph nodes. 9 In this study, we utilized the aetherAI-LNMD-GA (aetherAI, Taipei City, Taiwan) tool for evaluation. Our study aimed to address two primary objectives: first, to assess whether this AI tool could help oral pathologists and trainees to identify SCC cells within cervical lymph nodes more easily and improve their diagnostic accuracy; and second, to evaluate whether its use could reduce the time required by oral pathologists and trainees for interpretation of slides. Materials and methods The histological dataset in this study comprised 66 hematoxylin-eosin-stained histopathological slides, encompassing a total of 621 lymph nodes. These slides were retrospectively retrieved from the archives of the Division of Oral Pathology, Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital approved with Institutional Review Board of our Institution (KMUHIRB-E(I)-20250078). All specimens originated from cervical lymph node dissections conducted during surgical resections of oral SCC in adult patients between 2021 and 2023. Whole-slide images were acquired and digitized at 40× magnification (0.23 μm/pixel) using a NanoZoomer S360 digital slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The methodological framework for evaluating the diagnostic utility of the AI-assisted tool in detecting metastatic SCC in cervical lymph nodes is illustrated in Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Figure 1 Workflow of this study.

Figure 2 Following a two-week washout period, the same participants re-examined the same set of digital slides with the assistance of aetherAI-LNMD-GA. In this second phase, areas suspected to contain metastatic carcinoma were highlighted in red by the AI tool ( Fig. 2 Results The study set comprised 66 slides in total, including 53 negative slides, eight slides with macrometastases (≥2 mm), three slides with micrometastases, and two slides containing both macrometastases and micrometastases ( Fig. 2 Table 1 Fig. 4 P P P Table 1 Summary of diagnostic performance of participants.

Figure 4 Discussion In the current era of AI, the integration of AI technologies into the medical field has been rapidly advancing, particularly in the domain of histopathological diagnostics. AI is expected to assist pathologists in identifying potential lesions with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. Among its various applications, the detection of lymph node metastasis from malignant tumors remains a critical area where AI support is especially valuable. To date, numerous AI-assisted approaches for detecting lymph node metastases have been reported across a variety of tumor types, including breast, 10 , 11 12 , 13 9 , 14 15 16 17 In the present study, we applied a previously developed AI-based tool, originally designed for detecting lymph node metastases of gastric cancer, to the identification of cervical lymph node metastases in oral SCC. Our findings demonstrate a significant improvement in both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Notably, even experienced pathologists are at risk of overlooking subtle micrometastases due to their small size and inconspicuous presentation. With AI assistance, the detection rate of such challenging cases markedly increased. Furthermore, for novice pathologists who are still gaining experience in diagnostic pathology, the unaided interpretation of slides often results in a high false-positive rate. However, the use of AI substantially mitigated this issue. Therefore, beyond its role in improving diagnostic precision, AI-based diagnostic tools also show great promise as educational aids for training junior pathologists. By leveraging AI guidance, trainees can gain critical diagnostic insights and pattern recognition skills that traditionally require many years of clinical experience to acquire. In this digital era, such tools offer the potential to accelerate the learning curve by providing structured exposure to curated histological slides supplemented by AI-driven feedback. Beyond accuracy, diagnostic efficiency is another key advantage of AI assistance. In our study, the time required for slide interpretation was markedly reduced across all conditions of cervical lymph node samples when AI assistance was used, especially among less-experienced trainees. Although the reduction in interpretation time for micrometastatic slides did not reach statistical significance, a decreasing trend was still observed. This lack of statistical significance may be attributed to the relatively small number of micrometastatic slides included in the current study. In this study, the threshold for the AI-assisted tool was intentionally set to a relatively sensitive level. During the evaluation process, we observed that under this setting, the AI system occasionally produced false-positive results. Specifically, structures such as salivary gland tissue ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 In summary, the integration of AI-assisted tools in the diagnosis of lymph node metastases from malignant tumors has demonstrated clear benefits in both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, such tools significantly enhance the diagnostic capabilities of less-experienced pathologists, serving as valuable aids in training and clinical decision-making. We anticipate that with further development and broader implementation, AI-assisted diagnostic systems will contribute to more accurate pathological diagnoses and help alleviate the growing workload faced by pathologists in routine practice. These findings highlight the potential of AI to transform histopathological workflows and underscore the importance of continued innovation in digital pathology.
