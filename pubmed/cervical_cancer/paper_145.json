Purpose This study explored the potential of α-Hederin in the treatment of cervical cancer. Methods CCK8, EdU staining assay, flow cytometry were conducted for apoptosis, cell cycle, ROS, and mitochondrial membrane potential. Mechanism effects of α-hederin on cervical cancer cells were investigated using transcriptome sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and single-cell sequencing. Further in-depth detection of key proteins with western blot, immunofluorescence, overexpression of CHK1 gene, DNA damage inhibitors, and NAC inhibitors were performed to study the regulation of the cell cycle. In vivo nude mice tumorigenicity experiments and metabolomics analysis of the tumor tissue were also performed. Results α-Hederin significantly inhibited SiHa and HeLa cell growth, promoted apoptosis, and inhibited migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells. Sequencing and bioinformatics analysis revealed that α-hederin mainly regulated cell cycle, DNA replication, P53, and other signaling pathways to inhibit the proliferation of cervical cancer cells and inhibited the G2M phase of the cell cycle, mainly by suppressing CDK1 and CyclinB expression. α-hederin may use ATM-CHK1-CDC25B/CDC25C and ATM-P53-P21 to regulate CDK1/Cycline B activity. Inhibition of this action significantly promoted G2M phase block. In vivo experiment indicated that the drug can effectively inhibit cervical cancer growth. Conclusion α-hederin may be an effective drug to inhibit cervical cancer and has a good development prospect.

Despite the widespread HPV vaccination and screening, the incidence of cervical cancer has not decreased significantly [ 1 2 3 α-Hederin, a pentacyclic triterpenoid saponin isolated from Fructus Akebia [ 4 5 5 6 7 8 Abnormalities in cell cycle progression are a fundamental mechanism of tumorigenesis that make regulators of the cell cycle machinery rational targets for anticancer therapy. Thus, therapies targeting components of the cell cycle machinery can inhibit cancer cell division and also reverse cancer metabolism and restore cancer immune surveillance [ 9 10 11 12 13 12 13 14 15 The purpose of this study is to explore the potential mechanism of inhibiting cervical cancer cells by studying the effect of α-hederin on cervical cancer cells, and to provide a new traditional Chinese medicine monomer for the treatment of cervical cancer. Materials and methods Cell culture Human cervical squamous carcinoma cells including SiHa cells and HeLa from pricella (Wuhan, China) were cultured in DMEM medium (DMEM; Gibco, USA) and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Yeasen, Shanghai, China), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, USA). Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO₂. The medium was changed every 2–3 days to maintain optimal conditions for cell growth. For experimental treatments, cells were inoculated at a concentration of 1 × 10 5 Chemical reagents α-Hederin (HY-N0255), methylproamine (MPA, HY-15620), N-acetylcysteine (NAC, HY-B0215) were purchased from MedChemExpress (New Jersey, USA) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, D8371, Solarbio). The following antibodies were used: Caspase3 (Proteintech, 19,677–1-AP, 1:1000), Cleaved caspase3 (Proteintech, 25,128–1-AP, 1:1000), PARP1 (proteintech, 13,371–1-AP. 1:3000), Cleaved-PARP1 (BOSTER, Clone#HI-16, 1:1000), E-cadherin (Proteintech, 20,874–1-AP, 1:100,000), N-cadherin (Proteintech, 22,018–1-AP, 1. 8000), γ-H2AX (Proteintech, 83,307–2-RR, 1:10,000), ATM (Proteintech, 27,156–1-AP, 1:1000), CHK1 (Biodragon, BD-PT0902,1:1000), P-CHK1 (Proteintech, 28,805–1-AP, 1:4000), P53 (Proteintech, 10,442–1-AP, 1:10,000), P21 (Biodragono, BD-PP1849, 1:1000), CDC25B (Biodragono, BD-PT0799, 1:1000), the CDC25C (Proteintech, 16,485–1-AP, 1:8000), CyclinB2 (Proteintech, 21,644–1-AP, 1:8000), CDK1 (Proteintech, 10,762–1-AP, 1:2000). CCK8 experiments To assess the effect of α-hederin on cell proliferation, SiHa and HeLa cells were inoculated in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 3 EdU staining for proliferation analysis To evaluate cell proliferation, SiHa and HeLa cells were inoculated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 10 5 Apoptosis assay by flow cytometry Apoptosis induced by α-hederin treatment was explored. SiHa and HeLa cells were inoculated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 10 5 Clone formation assay To analyze the effect of α-hederin on the clone formation potential of SiHa and HeLa cells, the cells were first inoculated in 6-well plates at a density of 500 cells/well and cultured overnight. Twenty-four hours after inoculation, the cells were treated with different concentrations of α-hederin for 48. After treatment, the medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the culture was continued for 14 days under conventional culture conditions. Finally, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and were then stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution for 30 min. Clone formation efficiency was determined by calculating the ratio of the number of clones to the total number of inoculated cells and expressed as a percentage. The experiment was repeated three times and the data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy for mitochondrial membrane potential assay To assess the effect of α-hederin on the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) of SiHa and HeLa cells, cells were first inoculated in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 10 5 Cell scratch assay Cell scratch experiments were performed to assess the effect of α-hederin on the migratory ability of SiHa and HeLa cells. SiHa and HeLa cells were inoculated in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 5 Transwell cell migration assay Transwell migration assays were performed to assess the effect of α-hederin on the migration ability of SiHa and HeLa cells. SiHa and HeLa cells were inoculated in 24-well Transwell chambers at a density of 1 × 10 5 Clinical cervical cancer tissue acquisition The clinical tissue samples of cervical cancer used in this study were obtained from surgical resection specimens of patients approved by the Ethics Committee of Youjiang Medical University of Nationalities (Ethics Review No. 2025010501). Our research strictly adheres to ethical requirements and the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed informed consent. Surgically excised tumor tissue samples were sent to the laboratory for processing immediately after surgery. Tumor samples were used for immunohistochemical analysis. To ensure the reliability of the experimental results, we strictly screened patient samples that met the inclusion criteria and excluded patients with a history of chemotherapy or radiotherapy and or other malignant tumors. All samples were processed in accordance with uniform operational specifications during the experimental process to ensure the completeness and representativeness of the samples. For control analysis, normal cervical tissues were collected from the same patients and used as a control group. All tissue samples were handled and used in accordance with ethical requirements and in strict compliance with relevant clinical research norms. Transcriptome sequencing RNA sequencing was performed to investigate the effect of α-hederin treatment on the gene expression profile of cells. HeLa cells were inoculated in 6-well plates at a density of: 1 × 10⁶ cells/well and treated with 10 μM α-hederin for 24 h. Control cells were treated with equal amounts of loaded DMSO. Control cells were treated with an equal amount of loaded DMSO. RNA from total samples was isolated and purified using TRIzol (Invitrogen, CA, USA), per manufacturer protocols. The amount and purity of total RNA were quality controlled with a NanoDrop ND-1000 (NanoDrop, Wilmington, DE, USA). The integrity of the RNA was examined using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA) and also using agarose electrophoresis. Concentrations > 50 ng/μL, RIN values > 7.0, OD260/280 > 1.8, and total RNA > 1 μg satisfied downstream experiments. The mRNA with PolyA (polyadenylate) was specifically captured by two rounds of purification using oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Dynabeads Oligo (dT), item no. 25–61,005, Thermo Fisher, USA). The captured mRNAs were fragmented using the Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module (NEBNext® Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module, Item No. E6150S, USA) at 94 °C for 5–7 min. The fragmented RNA was used to synthesize cDNA by reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen SuperScript™ II Reverse Transcriptase, No. 1896649, CA, USA). cDNA was then synthesized using E. coli DNA polymerase I (NEB, No. m0209, USA), with RNase H (NEB, No. m0209, USA), and RNase H (NEBNext® Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module, No. E6150S, USA). RNase H (NEB, item no. m0297, USA) for two-strand synthesis to convert these composite double strands of DNA and RNA into DNA duplexes. dUTP Solution (Thermo Fisher, item no. R0133, CA, USA) was also doped into the duplexes to complement the ends of the double-stranded DNA into flat ends. An A base was added to each of its ends to enable it to be ligated to a junction with a T base at the end. Fragment size was screened and purified using magnetic beads. The second strand was digested with UDG enzyme (NEB, item no. m0280, MA, US) and subjected to PCR—pre-denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, denaturation at 98 °C for a total of 8 cycles of 15 s each, annealing to 60 °C for 15 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension retained at 72 °C for 5 min—to allow for the formation of a library with a fragment size of 300 bp ± 50 bp. Finally, we used illumina Novaseq™ 6000 (LC Bio Technology CO., Ltd. Hangzhou, China) to perform bipartite sequencing according to the standard operation with sequencing mode PE150. The downstream raw data were formatted as fastq and analyzed using gffcompare ( https://github.com/gpertea/gffcompare/ https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2 https://ccb.jhu.edu/ https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html p https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ Bioinformatics analysis and single-cell analysis The cervical cancer transcriptome dataset GSE63514 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ p https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm http://www.lilab-ecust.cn/pharmmapper/ https://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/ The dataset GSE168652 Cell cycle determination using flow cytometry During the logarithmic growth phase of SiHa and HeLa cells, cells were treated with different concentrations of α-hederin or other conditions for 24 h. The control group was only added with an equal amount of DMSO. After treatment, cells were collected by washing with PBS, trypsin digestion, and centrifugation, and were fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol overnight. After fixation, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 50 μg/mL RNAase for 30 min at 37 °C to remove RNA. Subsequently, cells were stained with 50 μg/mL propidium iodide (PI) dye, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light, to ensure that the dye binds to DNA. After staining was completed, PI fluorescence signals were detected using a flow cytometer (e.g., BD FACSCalibur or BD LSRFortessa), and cell cycle distributions were analyzed using FlowJo software. All experiments were performed with at least three biological replicates. The cell cycle distribution was analyzed using flow cytometry to compare the cell cycle changes between the different treatment and control group and to assess the effect of α-hederin on the cell cycle. Western blot During the logarithmic growth phase, cells were treated with different concentrations of α-hederin for 24 h. The control group was only added with an equal amount of solvent. After treatment, cells were washed in PBS, collected, and lysed using RIPA lysis buffer (containing 1% protease inhibitor and phosphatase inhibitor), incubated on ice for 15 min, centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was quantified by BCA method to ensure consistent protein concentration in each sample. Overall, 30 μg of total protein was extracted, which was denatured and treated by adding 5 × SDS loading buffer, and separated by electrophoresis using a 10% SDS-PAGE gel (6% SDS-PAGE gel was used for large proteins). After membrane transfer, PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder for 1 h and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the corresponding primary antibodies diluted at a suitable ratio of 1:1000. Membranes were subsequently incubated with HRP-labeled secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit or anti-mouse, 1:50,000, proteintech) for 1 h at room temperature. Protein signals were detected using ECL luminescence reagent (Epizyme, China) and imaged on a chemiluminescence imaging system (Tanon, Shanghai, China). The density of protein bands was quantified using ImageJ software, and the results were normalized to the internal reference protein GAPDH. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the results were statistically analyzed. Immunofluorescence experiments During the logarithmic growth phase of SiHa and HeLa cells, the cells were treated with different concentrations of α-hederin and MPA for 24 h. The control group was only added with an equal amount of solvent. A γ-H2AX immunofluorescence staining kit (Beyotime, China) was used and the relevant experiments were completed per manufacturer’s instructions. Observation and photography were performed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany). Images were analyzed using ImageJ software to calculate the intensity of γ-H2AX fluorescence staining in each sample. All experiments were repeated at least three times and the data were statistically analyzed. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) experiments During the logarithmic growth phase of SiHa and HeLa cells, cells were treated with different concentrations of α-hederin and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 24 h. The control group was only added with an equal amount of solvent. The treated cells were washed twice with PBS and subjected to ROS detection using 10 μM DHE (dihydroethidium, Invitrogen) or DCFH-DA (2’,7’-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, Sigma-Aldrich) dyes, and were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After staining, cells were washed three times with PBS to remove unbound dye and blocked using a blocking solution containing DAPI (Beyotime). ROS fluorescence signals were captured using a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany). Images were quantitatively analyzed using ImageJ software to calculate the relative fluorescence intensity of ROS in each sample. All experiments were repeated at least three times and the results were statistically analyzed. Meanwhile, ROS quantification was performed using flow cytometry. DHE fluorescence was detected by excitation (~ 488 nm) and its emission wavelength (~ 530 nm). Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software to record the fluorescence intensity of each cell and to calculate the difference in ROS levels between the treatment and control groups. The relative fluorescence intensity of ROS reflects the amount of intracellular ROS production. All experiments were repeated at least three times and the results were statistically analyzed. Construction of CHK1 overexpressing stably transfected cell line To construct a CHK1 overexpressing stably-transformed HeLa cell line, gene transduction was first performed using a lentiviral vector system. We used the CHK1 overexpression plasmid provided by Applied Biological Materials Inc (ABM), which contains the coding sequence of the human CHK1 gene and is driven by the CMV promoter for expression. The CHK1 overexpression plasmid, psPAX2 and pMD2.G plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 T cells at a mass ratio of 2:1:1 according to conventional methods. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) transfection reagent was used for transfection, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, lentiviral particles in the supernatant were collected and concentrated using ultracentrifugation. The concentrated lentiviral particles were used to transfect HeLa cells. At 48 h post-infection, successfully transduced cells were screened using an antibiotic screen (e.g., puromycin-containing medium). A CHK1 overexpressing stably transduced HeLa cell line was finally obtained. The establishment of stably transduced cell lines was confirmed using western blot analysis for CHK1 overexpression. Cellular Thermal Shift Assay(CETSA) Cervical cancer cells were treated with α-hederin (20 µM) for 24 h, with DMSO used as a control for the Buffer group. After treatment, cells were subjected to thermal denaturation by incubating at temperatures ranging from 40 °C to 65 °C for 3 min. Following heat treatment, cells were lysed, and the stability of CDK1 and CHK1 was assessed by Western blot analysis. The protein band intensities were quantified to evaluate the effect of α-hederin on protein stability. Animal experiments During the logarithmic growth period, HeLa cells were harvested and resuspended in saline, and cell suspensions were prepared. Briefly, 6–8-week-old male BALB/c nude mice (Beijing Viton Lever Laboratory Animal Science and Technology Co., Ltd.) weighed approximately 20 g. After one week of acclimatization, nude mice were injected with 1 × 10⁶ HeLa cell suspension subcutaneously into the right axilla. Tumor volume was measured periodically using the formula V = (L × W 2 Hematoxylin–Eosin staining and immunohistochemical experiments After fixation, the tumor tissues, liver, and kidney tissues were routinely dehydrated, made transparent, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned into 4–5 μm thick sections. Sections were first deparaffinized and hydrated, contrast stained with hematoxylin, followed by staining with eosin, and finally dehydrated and sealed. The stained tissue sections were observed under a light microscope, which was used to assess the morphological changes in the tumors, including cellular morphology, tissue structure, and tumor aggressiveness. For further analysis of molecular markers in tumor tissues, tumor tissue sections were stained for immunohistochemistry. First, antigen repair was performed using 10 mM sodium citrate buffer, followed by closure of endogenous peroxidase activity using 3% hydrogen peroxide solution. Sections were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C in a specific primary antibody (e.g., Ki-67, PCNA, P53) solution. The next day, the sections were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody and visualized using 3,3’-diaminobenzidine as the chromogenic reagent. The stained sections were contrast stained using hematoxylin and finally sealed. Immunohistochemically stained positive cells were quantified using ImageJ. Metabolomics analysis Samples stored at −80 °C were thawed on ice and homogenized for 20 s using a grinder (30 Hz). To 20 mg of the ground sample, 400 μL of a methanol:water solution (7:3, V/V) containing the internal standard was added. The mixture was shaken at 1500 rpm for 5 min, left on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (300 μL) was incubated at −20 °C for 30 min, followed by a second centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C. A final 200 μL of the supernatant was collected for LC–MS analysis. Samples were analyzed using two LC–MS methods: one under positive ion mode and the other under negative ion mode. A T3 column (Waters ACQUITY Premier HSS T3, 1.8 µm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm) was used with solvents A (0.1% formic acid in water) and B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) following this gradient: 5–20% B (2 min), 20–60% B (3 min), increase to 99% B (1 min), hold for 1.5 min, return to 5% B (0.1 min), hold for 2.4 min. The column temperature was 40 °C, the flow rate was 0.4 mL/min, and the injection volume was 4 μL. Data acquisition was performed in information-dependent acquisition (IDA) mode using Analyst TF 1.7.1 software, with source parameters set to 50 psi for ion source gases, 25 psi for curtain gas, 5000 V (positive) or −4000 V (negative) for ion spray voltage, and a temperature of 550 °C. TOF MS scans covered 50–1000 Da with a 200 ms accumulation time. Product ion scans were performed from 25–1000 Da with a 40 ms accumulation time and a collision energy of ± 30 V. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) were calculated using the R package ComplexHeatmap. Differential metabolites were identified using VIP (VIP >1) and p p Statistical analysis All experimental data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Intergroup comparisons were performed using t-test (between two groups) or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (among multiple groups). Data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0.

Figure 8 8 8 8 Discussion We observed that α-hederin significantly inhibits the value-added of cervical cancer cells and promoted their apoptosis. CCK-8 assay assessment of cell proliferation showed that α-hederin had a significant concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on SiHa and HeLa cells, which was further verified by cell cycle and proliferation assays by Hoechst and EdU fluorescent staining. Caspase-3 is a widely expressed conserved protein known for its role in apoptosis through protein hydrolysis activation. As an important regulator of apoptosis, activated caspase-3 cleaves multiple downstream substrates and drives the execution of cell death. Increasing evidence indicates that caspase-3 regulates the survival, proliferation and differentiation of normal and malignant cells, in addition to playing a key role in cell death [ 17 18 17 The results of cell migration experiments showed that α-hederin treatment significantly inhibited the migration ability of cervical cancer cells. Wound healing experiments and Transwell migration experiments showed that α-hederin could effectively reduce the speed of cell migration and number of migrating cells. Combined with its impairment of mitochondrial function, α-hederin may inhibit the motility of cancer cells by inducing energy deficiency and increasing cellular stress response, thus, weakening the invasiveness of cancer cells. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical in tumorigenesis, where the EMT program enhances metastasis, chemoresistance, and tumor stemness, and the hallmark of EMT is the up-regulation of N-calmodulin followed by the down-regulation of E-calmodulin [ 19 We further examined the mechanism by which α-hederin inhibits the cervical cancer cells by transcriptome sequencing of cervical cancer cells, and found that α-hederin inhibited the proliferation of cervical cancer cells by regulating several key cancer-associated [ 1 20 21 22 23 24 GSE63514 Our results showed that α-hederin could effectively block the G2/M phase of cervical cancer cells. In the late G2 phase of the cell cycle, elevated levels of cyclin B can form a stable CDK1/cyclin B complex, which triggers cells to enter the M phase of mitosis [ 25 25 26 27 26 27 We found that α-hederin may be used by ATM-CHK1-CDC25B/CDC25C and ATM-P53-P21 to regulate CDK1/cycline B activity by phosphorylating downstream substrates, and ATM and ATR amplify signaling responses by phosphorylating downstream substrates, and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1) and checkpoint kinase 2 (Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1) and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) are phosphorylated and activated by ATR and ATM, which in turn phosphorylate other substrates. ATR-mediated activation of CHEK1 inhibits cell cycle protein-dependent kinases (CDKs), leading to cell cycle arrest [ 28 29 9 30 31 Fig. 9 Diagram depicting the mechanism of α-hederin in blocking the G2M phase in cervical cancer cells In addition to this mechanism, we focused on the P53 signaling pathway in transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Tumor protein P53 (TP53) is the most commonly altered gene in cancer. Loss of its activity is thought to be a failure of the barrier that enables tumor transformation. Among different functions, the TP53 signaling pathway is closely related to cell cycle control, and cell cycle arrest is the main biological outcome observed after P53 activation, which prevents the accumulation of damaged DNA as well as genomic instability [ 32 25 The P53 tumor suppressor gene and the gene product ATM (“ataxia-telangiectasia mutated”) mediate cell cycle perturbations in response to DNA damage and play a role in cell death, genetic stability, and cancer susceptibility [ 33 We further investigated the role of DNA damage in α-hederin-treated cervical cancer cells using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining analysis and found that γ-H2AX expression was significantly increased in SiHa and HeLa cells after α-hederin treatment, a phenomenon that showed an upward trend in concentration-dependence, which further confirmed the occurrence of DNA damage. The presence of MPA, an inhibitor of DNA damage repair, attenuated γ-H2AX expression. γ-H2AX expression γ-H2AX serves as an early marker of DNA DSB damage [ 34 35 36 37 38 CHK1 is involved in the regulation of downstream effectors that determine cell fate and promote cell death [ 37 39 39 Metabolomics analysis revealed significant changes in tumor metabolic profiles induced by α-hederin treatment. One significantly upregulated metabolite was 4-hydroxytamoxifen, a metabolite of tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer [ 40 41 In summary, this study revealed that α-hederin can significantly inhibit the growth of cervical cancer and induce apoptosis via DNA-damage-dependent cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Therefore, α-hederin, as a potential herbal monomer, may be an effective DNA damage inducer and is expected to be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of cervical cancer after future clinical trials. However, its toxicology and specific mechanism need further study. A limitation of this study is that we did not conduct a deeper investigation into the key targets of α-hederin in inhibiting cervical cancer and its molecular mechanisms. This will be a focus of our next phase of research. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.
