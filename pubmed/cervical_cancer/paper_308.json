Substance use disorders (SUDs) among women with gynecologic cancers pose challenges to treatment adherence, patient well-being, morbidity, and mortality. Despite the prevalence of SUDs, routine screening practices have not been widely adopted. This quality improvement project implemented the Revised Opioid Risk Tool (ORT-OUD) to screen for SUDs among gynecologic oncology patients. The aims were to provide a referral to addiction psychiatry in a minimum of 80% of patients who screened as high risk and demonstrate the feasibility of ORT-OUD implementation in clinical practice, with at least 75% of advanced practice providers (APPs) reporting it as feasible. The ORT-OUD was offered to all patients aged 18 years or older, consented, and were on the APPs' schedules during the project implementation period (3 months). Patients completed the ORT-OUD privately, and APPs reviewed and scored the tool. Patients with scores of 3 or higher were offered a referral to addiction psychiatry. Advanced practice providers were then given a survey to assess their perception of the project's feasibility. Descriptive statistics were used to track referral rates and APP perceptions. Of 134 patients screened, 9.7% were identified as high risk for SUDs. Of those patients, 76.9% accepted a referral to addiction psychiatry. One hundred percent of APPs reported the ORT-OUD implementation as feasible. Challenges identified included time needed to explain the screening tool and patients' perceptions of the screening tool questions. This project successfully identified a proportion of gynecologic oncology patients at risk for SUDs and facilitated access to specialized care. Challenges in the screening process highlight the importance of patient education and communication strategies. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Substance use disorders (SUDs) have garnered nationwide attention amid an ongoing opioid epidemic. It was previously believed that SUDs did not affect people with cancer to the same extent as the general population (3.2%); however, recent studies show SUDs occur at the same rate, if not more, than in the general population ( Coffa & Snyder, 2019 Teulings & Broglio, 2020 Yusufov et al., 2019 Carmichael et al., 2016 Opioids are commonly used to manage cancer-related pain, particularly in advanced stages where the prevalence of pain is more than 60% ( Snijders et al., 2023 Yusufov et al., 2019 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2015 Yusufov et al., 2019 Snijders et al., 2023 Ramzan et al., 2018 Goetz et al., 2021 Farkouh et al., 2020 Farkouh et al., 2020 Farkouh et al., 2020 Routine screening with a validated tool is known to increase the rate of identifying people with SUDs and those at risk for SUDs ( Choflet et al., 2020 Teulings & Broglio, 2020 Aldridge et al., 2017 Choflet et al., 2020 McLellan, 2017 Lefkowits & Duska, 2017 Substance use disorders are chronic illnesses that need to be monitored, treated, and managed over long periods of time by a trained specialist ( McLellan, 2017 Aldridge et al., 2017 Yusufov et al., 2019 Carmichael et al., 2016 Choflet et al., 2020 Yusufov et al., 2019 Carmichael et al., 2016 Dannenberg et al., 2022 Barclay et al., 2014 The Revised Opioid Risk Tool (ORT-OUD) is a validated screening tool that identifies patients with SUD risk factors and has been successfully used in people with cancer and those being prescribed opioids for chronic pain ( Table 1 Carmichael et al., 2016 Dannenberg et al., 2022 Barclay et al., 2014 Teulings & Broglio, 2020 Table 1 Revised Opioid Risk Tool (ORT-OUD) Mark each box that applies Yes No Family history of substance abuse Alcohol 1 0 Illegal drugs 1 0 Rx drugs 1 0 Personal history of substance abuse Alcohol 1 0 Illegal drugs 1 0 Rx drugs 1 0 Age between 16–45 years 1 0 Psychological disease ADD, OCD, bipolar, schizophrenia 1 0 Depression 1 0  Scoring totals Note. Cheatle et al. (2019) This project focused on a Northeastern United States gynecologic oncology practice that did not have a screening tool in place for SUDs. The practice uses an online database called Internet System for Tracking Over-Prescribing (I-STOP) to track controlled substance prescriptions. I-STOP allows providers to access a patient's prescription history and review for potential overprescribing, and is a hard stop prior to prescribing an opioid. A review of 20 patients prescribed opioids in the practice revealed that none were screened for an SUD. The broader University associated with this practice has an addiction psychiatry clinic staffed by specialists trained in SUD assessment, management, and pain control. Therefore, a quality improvement (QI) project that both implements an SUD screening tool in the practice and manages a referral process to addiction medicine was paramount. METHODS Design and Setting This QI project was conducted by a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) student from October 2023 to December 2023 in an outpatient gynecologic oncology practice in upstate New York. The department sees an average of 40 patients per day, serving people with gynecologic cancers or precancerous conditions, including ovarian, cervical, endometrial, vulvar, fallopian tube, and vaginal cancer. During the project, 134 patients were screened for SUD risks using the ORT-OUD. Institutional review board approval was not required. Aims, Intervention, and Instruments The purpose of this QI project was to implement a validated screening tool into a gynecologic oncology practice to identify those at risk for an SUD and to provide a referral to addiction psychiatry. The specific aims were to (1) report that APPs placed a referral to treatment in a minimum of 80% of patients who screened positive on the ORT-OUD via the electronic medical record within 2 weeks of a positive screen, and (2) assess the feasibility of ORT-OUD implementation in clinical practice, with at least 75% of participating APPs reporting the process as feasible. During the 3-month project implementation period, the ORT-OUD was offered to all patients in the offices of the five APPs who participated, provided they were over the age of 18 and consented to completing the assessment. A brief in-person presentation was provided to office staff detailing the project goals, ORT-OUD screening process, documentation protocol, and referral process via the electronic medical record. The ORT-OUD was given to patients as a paper handout at check-in by a patient care technician, with the patient's electronic medical record number for identification. Patients then privately completed the ORT-OUD in the exam rooms prior to the APP entering. The APP then reviewed and scored the ORT-OUD and documented the patient's score in the electronic medical record within their provider note. The APP offered a referral to the affiliated addiction psychiatry group to any patient who screened high risk (score ≥ 3). The ORT-OUD designates a score of three or higher as high risk for opioid misuse, as patients with scores at or above three are more likely to engage in aberrant drug-related behaviors ( Cheatle et al., 2019 Post-implementation data were collected through a retrospective chart review of the patient's electronic medical records. Patient information was deidentified, and referral rates were recorded in an Excel spreadsheet on a password-protected computer. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the first aim of the project. Following this, the paper surveys were properly disposed of in the office receptacle for protected health information. The APP post-implementation questionnaire was then provided to all five APPs after completion of the ORT-OUD implementation. The APPs anonymously completed a two-item Likert scale survey to assess their perception of the project's feasibility into practice and which area was most challenging to implement (screening, documenting, or referring). The surveys were returned to a secure office cabinet for review. Responses were recorded anonymously in the Excel spreadsheet on the password-protected computer. Descriptive statistics were again utilized to evaluate APP assessment of project feasibility (second aim). RESULTS From October to December 2023, 134 patients were screened. Patient ages ranged from 19 to 89 years old, and types of cancers included endometrial, cervical, ovarian, vulvar, and vaginal cancer. ORT-OUD scores ranged from 0 to 6. The average score was 1.5, and the median score was 1 ( Table 2 Table 2 ORT-OUD Score Frequency ORT-OUD Score  n  % 0 60 44.8 1 34 25.4 2 27 20.1 3  7  5.2 4  2  1.5 5  3  2.2 6  1  0.7 Note. For the first project aim, out of the 134 patients screened, 13 screened positive (9.7%) with a score of ≥ 3, indicating high risk for an SUD ( Table 2 For the second project aim, all five (100%) APPs strongly agreed integrating ORT-OUD into practice is feasible. An open-ended item asked APPs to offer the most challenging area (screening, documenting, or referral process). Two (40%) APPs said there were no challenging areas and three (60%) APPs reported that the screening process was the most challenging. Reasons provided for screening challenges were time to explain the purpose of the screening tool and patients' perceptions of the questions. DISCUSSION This QI project successfully identified a proportion of gynecologic oncology patients at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD), underscoring the importance of routine screening for SUDs among people with gynecologic cancers and precancerous conditions. While there are limited data on screening rates in the general population, it is estimated that 3.2% of the US population ages 12 and older have an OUD ( Coffa & Snyder, 2019 Strand et al., 2022 Strand et al., 2022 Limitations Despite the overall success of the intervention, challenges were encountered during implementation, particularly related to the screening process. Some APPs reported difficulties in explaining the purpose of the screening tool to patients and addressing patient perceptions of the questions. These challenges underscore the importance of patient education and communication strategies to enhance the acceptability and effectiveness of SUD screening initiatives. One suggestion is to provide patients with an informative pamphlet or brief video at check-in to enhance patient understanding of the purpose of the screening tool and how to answer the questions appropriately. CONCLUSION The findings of this project have several implications for clinical practice in gynecologic oncology settings. Firstly, routine screening for SUDs, particularly using validated tools such as the ORT-OUD, should be integrated into oncology practices nationwide. Women in particular may be at higher risk for adverse events related to substance use, and gynecologic oncology providers need to be aware of this. This proactive approach enables early identification of patients at risk for SUDs, allowing for timely intervention and support with the goal of improving patient safety and outcomes. Secondly, the successful implementation of the ORT-OUD and referral process highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing SUDs among gynecologic oncology patients. By leveraging existing resources and expertise within addiction psychiatry, oncology practices can enhance the comprehensive care and support provided to patients with SUDs and risk factors. Fortunately, addiction medicine clinics are becoming more widespread, thus improving community access. Moving forward, further research is needed to explore the long-term impact of SUD screening on patient outcomes, including pain management, treatment adherence, and quality of life. Future initiatives should investigate strategies to optimize the SUD screening process, address patient barriers, and enhance the integration of addiction psychiatry services into oncology care.
