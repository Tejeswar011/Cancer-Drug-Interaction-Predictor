The treatment of ASCC was centralised in Sweden in 2017. This study aims to describe the characteristics and outcomes of surgery for ASCC nationally, focusing on short‐term morbidity and mortality. Materials and Methods All patients with ASCC who underwent surgery from 2017 to 2021 in Sweden were retrospectively identified. Perioperative complications and mortality rates were recorded, and risk factors were analysed. Results A total of 97 patients underwent 103 surgical procedures. The median age was 64 years (56–74), and 61% were women. Indications included recurrent tumours after CRT (43%), residual disease (34%), re‐recurrence following prior salvage surgery (8%), primary surgery due to CRT contraindication (8%) and post‐treatment sequelae (8%). Surgical procedures included 84 (82%) abdominoperineal excisions, 10 (10%) pelvic exenterations, 5 (5%) perineal excisions for local re‐recurrences and 4 (4%) lymphadenectomies. Overall, 48% of patients experienced perineal morbidity, defined as perineal wound infection, dehiscence, necrosis or pelvic abscess. Major surgical complications (Clavien‐Dindo ≥ III) were reported in 22/103 (21%) of procedures. Most reoperations (9/16) were related to flap complications. Thirty‐ and 90‐day mortality rates were 0% and 1%, respectively. Conclusion This national cohort study presents the largest recent series of surgically treated ASCC patients in Sweden. Surgery caused substantial short‐term morbidity, particularly perineal morbidity, while short‐term mortality remained low. Although no significant risk factors for major complications were identified, these findings highlight the need for improved perineal wound management and further evaluation of long‐term outcomes. abdominoperineal excision anal cancer Myocutaneous flap reconstruction pelvic exenteration perineal wound postoperative complications Skåne County Council's Research and Development Foundation 10.13039/100012558 Allmänna Sjukhusets i Malmö Stiftelse för Bekämpande av Cancer 10.13039/501100009736 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:03.10.2025  Jacobsen S Angenete E Johnsson A Lydrup M‐L Nilsson PJ Buchwald P Short‐term morbidity and mortality following surgical treatment of anal squamous cell carcinoma in Sweden – A national multicentre study Colorectal Dis 2025 27 e70241 10.1111/codi.70241  What does this paper add to the literature? This first nationwide evaluation of surgical outcomes for ASCC in Sweden highlights significant short‐term morbidity and underscores the need for improved perineal wound management, supporting future optimisation of surgical and reconstructive strategies in specialised clinical centres. INTRODUCTION Anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) is a rare malignancy strongly associated with high‐risk types of human papilloma virus (HPV) [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 7 12 13 14 11 15 16 17 The aims of this nationwide retrospective cohort study were to describe surgical approaches and the short‐term morbidity and mortality after surgical treatment for ASCC in Sweden between 2017 and 2021. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients Surgically treated ASCC patients in Sweden from January 2017 to December 2021 were retrospectively identified through local theatre lists at participating centres, encompassing all eligible patients nationally. Up until 2017, salvage surgery was performed at several different referral hospitals in Sweden. The centralisation of ASCC surgery began in 2017, designating Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg and Skåne University Hospital in Malmö as the two national centres. During the implementation period, patients also underwent surgical treatment at Ersta Hospital and Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm. All patients undergoing surgical treatment for ASCC irrespective of indication were included, that is patients with recurrent or residual ASCC, patients with locoregional recurrence after salvage surgery as well as patients receiving primary surgical treatment due to previous irradiation for other pelvic malignancy. In addition, patients undergoing surgical treatment due to radiation sequelae (i.e. fistulas, chronic wounds, intolerable perineal pain) were included. All perineal reconstructions were performed by plastic surgeons in collaboration with the colorectal surgical teams at the respective centres. All patients were discussed at a national multidisciplinary conference to assess surgical indication and determine appropriate treatment. This retrospective observational cohort study was approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Dnr 2020–06085). Definitions Residual or recurrent ASCC was diagnosed by biopsy or radiological suspicion, with residual disease diagnosed within 6 months of completing CRT and recurrence after 6 months. Re‐recurrence was defined as locoregional relapse after prior salvage surgery. Total pelvic exenteration was defined as APE with cystectomy and resection of the internal reproductive organs. Posterior exenteration involved APE with hysterectomy (± posterior vaginal wall), sparing the bladder. Anterior exenteration referred to cystectomy with reproductive organ resection. Local excision was defined as wide tumour removal after re‐recurrence, without anorectal excision. Data extraction The Swedish anal cancer registry, initiated in 2015 and with a coverage of >95% of all ASCC cases nationwide, was used to extract data on clinical staging, tumour characteristics and oncological treatment [ 18 19 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to present data. Continuous data were reported according to distribution as the median with interquartile range. Categorical data were presented as numbers with percentages. A Directed Acyclic Graph was constructed to identify potential confounders and variables directly influencing postoperative outcomes, thereby guiding the selection of covariates for inclusion in the logistic regression analysis used to identify potential risk factors for major complications (Clavien‐Dindo ≥ III) following surgery (Figure S1 RESULTS Patient and surgical characteristics A total of 97 patients treated between 2017 and 2021 were identified from local theatre lists at the hospitals in Malmö, Gothenburg and Stockholm. During the study period, four patients underwent at least one reoperation. In total, 103 surgical procedures were performed.

Perineal complications occurred after 47/98 (48%) resections, including perineal surgical‐site infections in 29/98 (30%) resections. Pelvic abscesses requiring ultrasound‐guided drainage were observed in seven patients. There were 16 unplanned reoperations, most commonly due to flap‐related complications (9/16; 56%), such as wound infection combined with flap necrosis and/or dehiscence.

Most surgeries were performed for residual or recurrent disease following CRT. Perineal complications were the most common, though typically minor and managed conservatively. Still, 21% of patients required surgical or endoscopic intervention. Despite this, the 30‐ and 90‐day mortality was rates were low, 0 and 1%, respectively. Previous studies on ASCC surgery have largely been limited to single‐centre case series [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 A Danish single‐centre study reported minor and major postoperative complications in 32% and 31% after APE with myocutaneous flap reconstruction and similarly found no clear predictors of major complications despite a sample size of 98 patients [ 26 Major complications were more frequent with VRAM flaps (35%) than gluteal flaps (18%), though not statistically significant. This may reflect the greater technical complexity of VRAM reconstruction, often used for larger, irradiated defects in ASCC [ 27 27 Our results imply that surgery for ASCC is associated with considerable 30‐day postoperative morbidity. However, complications appear to be adequately identified and managed, reflected in the low 30‐ and 90‐day mortality following the centralisation of salvage surgery in Sweden. Despite this, there remains a need to improve management of the perineal wound after APE. The long‐term effects of perioperative perineal morbidity on wound healing, functional outcomes and quality of life warrant further investigation. During the 5‐year study period (2017–2021), 97 patients underwent surgery for ASCC, representing approximately 10% of all ASCC patients in Sweden, based on an annual incidence of 200 ASCC cases. This confirms that surgery for ASCC remains uncommon, aligning with previously reported rates (15%) [ 28 18 29 A key limitation of this study is its retrospective design, which relies on accurate electronic charting and registry data. Missing information and potential underreporting of minor complications may introduce information bias. We did not apply the Comprehensive complications index [ 30 Additionally, the study population was heterogeneous, including patients without preoperative CRT and those undergoing lymphadenectomy only. The heterogeneity in surgical indications, technique, extent of resection and flap reconstruction type influence complication risk and generalisability, thereby limiting interpretation of pooled complication rates across the cohort. To improve statistical homogeneity, only patients undergoing APE or extended APE for oncological indications (i.e. salvage for residual/recurrent tumours or primary surgery due to CRT contraindication) were included in statistical analysis. Although missing data were limited, using complete case analysis may have introduced bias; however, this is unlikely to have significantly impacted results. Together, these factors may have reduced the statistical power and limited the generalisability of the results. A major strength of this study is its national, multicentre design, capturing all surgically treated ASCC patients in Sweden over a five‐year period. This enabled the inclusion of a relatively large and representative cohort despite the rarity of the disease. Additionally, the combination of meticulous medical chart review and national registry data enhances data reliability and reduces information bias through cross‐validation of clinical variables. In conclusion, salvage surgery in Sweden is predominantly performed as ELAPE for residual or recurrent ASCC after initial CRT. While short‐term morbidity is substantial, with perineal complications occurring in nearly half of patients, most are managed conservatively. International multicentre collaborations with pooled data from specialised units will be essential to identify risk factors for perineal morbidity and establish a consensus on optimal perineal reconstructive strategies.
