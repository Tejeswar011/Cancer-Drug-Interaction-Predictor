Previous studies have shown that NP can interfere with hormone synthesis and metabolism in humans and animals, leading to male reproductive dysfunction. This study utilized the scRNA-seq method to evaluate cell populations and their heterogeneity, aiming to elucidate the toxic mechanisms of NP exposure on testicular cells. We demonstrate, for the first time, the transcriptomic characteristics of testicular single cells in adolescent mice exposed to NP. Adolescent mice, initially exposed at 4 weeks of age, were subsequently analyzed at sexual maturity after a continuous exposure period of 3 months. The blank control and NP-exposed groups underwent scRNA-seq analysis, identifying ten cell populations. The results showed that after NP exposure, the number of germline cells was remarkably reduced compared to the control group. NP exposure significantly decreased the protein expression of the four common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) ( Cmtm2b Rpl28 Adam32 Pgam2 Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10565-025-10095-7. Highlights  NP exposure interfered with testicular development and spermatogenesis. NP exposure affected the cell cycle of Spermatogonia and Spermatocyte.

C57BL/6 male mice (3 weeks of age) were obtained from the Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control (Wuhan, China) and housed at the Animal Center of Xiangyang No.1 People's Hospital (Hubei, China) in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment. All mice were housed in standard polypropylene cages (320 × 215 × 170 mm) under a 12-h light/dark period at a temperature of 21 ± 2 °C, with free access to water and standard laboratory food. Adolescent mice, aged 4 weeks at the onset of exposure, were evaluated for analysis at sexual maturity after a 3-month exposure duration. After one-week acclimation, mice were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6/group): (1) blank control (untreated), (2) solvent control (corn oil vehicle), (3) NP-treated group (5 μg/kg, 1 × human tolerable daily intake [TDI]), (4) NP-treated group (50 μg/kg, 10 × TDI), and (5) NP-treated group (100 μg/kg, 20 × TDI). The human TDI of NP is 5 μg/kg (Chang, et al. 2019 2024 2015 2021 All treatments were administered via intragastric gavage using sterile 20-gauge ball-tipped needles between 9:00–11:00 AM every second day (Cary, et al. 2023 2024 Collection of tissue samples Following the final exposure, the mice were euthanized via cervical dislocation. The testes and epididymides were quickly removed and weighed. For each mouse, the left testis was used for biochemical analysis. After fixing the tissue with 10% formalin, half of the tissue was prepared for paraffin embedding for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry, while the other half was prepared for optimal cutting temperature (OCT) embedding for immunofluorescence. The right testis was used for scRNA-seq analysis. The remaining tissues were stored at –80 ℃ until biochemical analysis. Determination of sperm quality The mice were euthanized by decapitation, and the cauda epididymis was immediately rinsed with 100 μL of prewarmed sperm nutrient solution at room temperature. Ten deep cuts were made in each epididymis and incubated immediately in a CO 2 2 H&E staining analysis Fresh testicular tissue samples were immersed in 4% neutral-buffered formalin and fixed for 24 h at room temperature, then dehydrated with ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 5 µm slices. These sections were then stained with H&E and examined using a pathological section scanner (KFBio KF-PRO-020, Ningbo, China). Tissue dissociation and single-cell sample preparation To obtain samples for single-cell RNA sequencing, testicular tissue was used for cell capture. One testis from each of the blank control group and 100 μg/kg NP group was selected for analysis. The tissue was washed three times with PBS washing solution and transferred to a 1.5 mL EP tube, which was then then stored at –80 °C and shipped to Beijing SeekGene Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) for tissue dissociation. The resulting cell suspension had a concentration between 400 to 1000 cells/μL, with a cell survival rate exceeding 90%. Barcode coding was performed using SeekOneChip, and scRNA-seq was conducted on the SeekOne ® MM system. Quality control and cell annotation of single-cell RNA sequencing data We utilized the 10 × Genomics platform for single-cell RNA sequencing of the sample. Using the Seurat package (version 4.3.1), we generated a single-cell expression matrix to calculate cell percentages, filter data, normalize expression values, determine principal components (PCs), perform dimensionality reduction using UMAP, cluster cells, annotate cell types, and analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs). High-quality single-cell data were retained based on rigorous criteria: cells with a gene count between 200 and 5500 to exclude low-quality cells, empty droplets, and doublets; mitochondrial genes accounting for less than 40% of total gene expression; and genes expressed in at least 3 cells. This process resulted in 17,475 cells for further analysis. Technical batch effects, defined by experimental groups (control vs. NP groups) and sequencing runs, were corrected using Harmony (v1.0). Successful integration was validated by pre-/post-correction visualization, a high mixing efficiency (distance ratio = 0.971), and preserved biological clustering (silhouette score > 0.8) (Fig. S2). After integrating the data, we applied the Harmony package to mitigate batch effects. We determined the optimal number of PCs and selected those with a significance level ( P Searching for DEGs in ten different cell populations DEGs analysis was performed for ten cell populations among the control and NP groups using the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test. A scatter plot of DEGs was generated using ggplot2, with selection based on a P P GO and KEGG analysis GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using the online Metascape tool ( https://metascape.org https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ P P Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis The STRING online database ( https://string-db.org Trajectory inference The R software package Monocle (version 2.28) was utilized to infer the trajectories of RS and ES subtypes. First, data from RS or ES subtypes was extracted to construct CellDataSet (CDS) objects, followed by filtering out low-quality cells based on criteria such as removing genes expressed in fewer than 10 cells. Clustering was performed using highly variable genes identified by Seurat. DEGs were identified using differentialGeneTest function, with genes having a q-value < 0.01 selected for further analysis. Dimensionality reduction was conducted using the DDRTree reverse graph embedding method. Finally, the results were visualized using plot_cell_trajectory function. Intercellular communication analysis The Cellchat software package (version 1.6.1) in the R package was applied to construct Cellchat objects, preprocess data from the control and NP groups, and infer cell communication networks. The number and intensity of ligand-receptor pairs between cells were calculated and visualized using a Circle plot. Conservative and specific signaling pathways between the control and NP groups were identified, with differences in all ligand-receptor pairs displayed using bubble plots. Western blotting Western blot analysis included testicular tissues from 6 biological replicates per group. The total proteins of the testicular tissues were extracted with RIPA lysis buffer (Servicebio, Wuhan, China) supplemented with 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, 04693132001). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay, with 30 μg of total protein loaded per sample. Equal amounts of protein extracts were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE gels and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (0.45 μm, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). The membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-CMTM2 polyclonal antibody (1:1000, C15132 Immunoreactive proteins were detected using ECL detection reagent (G2161, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). The protein bands were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence plus Western blot detection system (SCG-W5000, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Densitometric analysis of the protein bands was performed using AIWBwell™ analysis software (Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Data normality was verified using the Shapiro–Wilk test. For normally distributed data, we conducted one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the least significant difference (LSD) post-hoc test. Single-cell data analysis and computations were conducted using R software (version 4.3.1).

A total of 17,475 cells were successfully classified into 33 independent clusters, comprising 9,756 cells from the control group and 7,719 cells from the NP group (Fig. 2 Anp32b AA467197 Spaca3 1700027A15Rik Cst12 Fabp3 C1qb Col1a2 Ccl5 Abcb1a 2 2 Fig. 2 Results of single-cell RNA sequencing data analysis.

( A B C D Discussion Male infertility has become a global issue in medicine, culture, and society. Previous studies have shown that genetic mutations, endocrine and metabolic disturbances, and lifestyle changes can affect semen quality and even lead to male infertility (Thacharodi, et al. 2023 2022 2023 2023 2023 2019 2016 2017 2021 2020 2021 Spermatogenesis is initiated at puberty and continues throughout life. The present study focused on the impact of NP on reproductive cells during the adolescent-to-adult period in mice. Our studies revealed that NP exposure during this period adversely affected semen quality, compromising male fertility. These results align with findings from Aly et al.(Aly, et al. 2012 2024 2019 2022 2016 2024 2022 In vitro 2022 2015 2020 In mammals, the process of spermatogenesis undergoes three main stages: the formation of primary SPG, meiosis, and spermatogenesis (Xie, et al. 2021 2021 2020a 2020b Cmtm2b Cct7 Rpl28 Rps14 Cmtm2b 2019 2020b Cct7 2022 2020 Rpl28 Rps14 2019 2021 2023 Cmtm2b Cct7 Rpl28 Rps14 Oxidative phosphorylation plays a key role in metabolic processes, providing energy to sperm and supporting their metabolic activities by producing ATP (Foutouhi, et al., 2022 2024 2024 2018 2024 Our research indicated that, in addition to SPG, SPC is the germ cell type most affected by NP exposure. Previous literature has defined the four stages of SPC as leptonema, zygonema, pachynema, and diplonema (Lin, et al., 2019 2024 Adam32 2021 2020 2021 2020 Cmtm2b 2019 2018 2019 2018 2021 2022 Pgam2 2019 Pgam2 2019 Adam32 Cmtm2b Pgam2 The development of RS depends on energy metabolism, with ATP being generated by the mitochondria in the center of the germ cell through oxidative phosphorylation Lehtiniemi, and Kotaja, 2017 2020 2021 2021 2021 2021 2021 2020 Our results indicate that the DEGs common to both early and advanced ES include Prm1 Prm1 2019 2019 2019 2021 Prm1 We found that NP exposure induced a notable increase in intercellular interactions in the testicular microenvironment, reflecting cellular heterogeneity in response to NP exposure. Cellular communication is crucial for spermatogenesis (Zhang, et al. 2022 2+ 2016 2015 2015 2023 2023 2020 2024a 2024b Conclusion Findings from this study have shown that exposure to NP during adolescence to adulthood interferes with testicular development and spermatogenesis in mice, leading to a decrease in semen quality in adulthood. Using scRNA-seq, we found that NP exposure affected the oxidative phosphorylation and cell cycle of SPG, negatively impacting multiple stages of SPC development by interfering with the cell cycle and cell division and causing deterioration of intracellular oxidative phosphorylation and ROS homeostasis in the differentiation of RS into ES. The developmental issues in ES may result from disruptions in cell differentiation and flagellated sperm motility. Moreover, NP exposure alters cellular crosstalk between germ and somatic cells by affecting signaling pathways such as NECTIN, CADM, and GRN. Overall, this study provides new insights into the potential impact of NP on male reproductive health, emphasizing the significance of environmental hormones in fertility issues. However, our research has some limitations. Although scRNA-seq revealed differences in gene expression among cell types, batch effects may have impacted the results. Furthermore, we were unable to fully investigate the effects of NP exposure on cell development at different stages, and we lacked a more in-depth analysis of its specific roles in reproductive health. Further research into these mechanisms is needed to identify new therapeutic targets to mitigate reproductive toxicity associated with environmental pollutants such as NP.
