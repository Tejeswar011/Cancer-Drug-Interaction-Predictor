Zuojin Wan (ZJW), a traditional Chinese medicinal formula, has been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects on CRC. It can inhibit the proliferation of CRC cells and improve the prognosis of CRC by enhancing immunity; however, the precise immune mechanisms remain unclear. A CT26 cell-induced CRC tumor-bearing mouse model in this study was established to investigate the therapeutic effects of ZJW on CRC. In vivo experiments confirmed that ZJW significantly reduced the size of CRC tumors and decreased the levels of M2 TAMs markers, including CD206 and Arg-1, while increasing the levels of iNOS. Furthermore, in a co-culture system with macrophages, ZJW reduced the proportion of M2 macrophages and increased the proportion of M1 macrophages. Simultaneously, ZJW intervention attenuated the proliferation and migration of CT26 and MC38 cells. ZJW may suppress the migration and proliferation of CT26 and MC38 cells by inhibiting M2 TAMs. The results of network pharmacology combined with Western blot indicated that ZJW may suppress M2 TAMs by inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in TAMs. This study confirmed that Zuojin Wan may suppress the malignant progression of colorectal cancer by inhibiting M2 TAMs, potentially mediated by inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in TAMs. Zuojin Wan traditional Chinese medicine colorectal cancer tumor-associated macrophages JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway the Guangxi Young Talents Program No.0502405914 and DC2400003575 the National Natural Science Foundation of China https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 No. 82460718 the Middleaged and Young Teachers’ Basic Ability Promotion Project of Guangxi No.2023KY0308 and 2022KY0280 the Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region https://doi.org/10.13039/100012547 No.2025GXNSFBA069323, 2022JJB140189 the PhD start-up fund of Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine https://doi.org/10.13039/501100011833 No. 2022BS033 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes cover-date January-December 2025 typesetter ts1 Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) has been reported as the second largest cause of cancer-related death. In developing countries such as China, the incidence of colorectal cancer is rising rapidly due to lifestyle changes. 1 2  3  4 As the most abundant immune cell in tumor immune microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are known as the “Big Brother” of tumor immune escape.  5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 14 15 16 Previous studies have shown that inhibiting M2 TAMs could suppress the malignant progression of CRC.  17  18 Methods and Materials Cell Culture and Reagents RAW264.7 macrophages (RRID: CVCL_0493, Cat#STCC20020P), CT-26 cells (RRID: CVCL_7254, Cat#STCC20017), and MC38 cells (RRID: CVCL_B288, Cat#PSTCC20018P) were bought from Servicebio (Wuhan, CN).The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 or DMEM containing 10% of fetal bovine serum (Gibco, NY, USA,Cat#A5256701), 2 mM of glutamine, 100 units/mL of streptomycin and penicillin at 37°C in a humidified 5% of CO 2 Preparation of Zuojin Wan Zuojin Wan decoction is composed of Coptis chinensis Evodia rutaecarpa Coptis chinensis Evodia rutaecarpa Components Analysis from Aqueous Extracts of ZJW The extracts were mixed with acetonitrile and water (ratio: 1:1 v/v) and filtered through 0.45-µm microporous membrane prior to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The Welch Ultimate C18 column (5 µm, 4.6 mm × 250 mm, Welch Materials, Inc in Shanghai) was applied for chromatographic separations. The mobile phase was composed of A (0.4% phosphoric acid water) and B (acetonitrile) with a linear gradient elution: 0 to 5 minutes, 4% to 12.4% B; 5 to 20 minutes, 12.4% to 13.4% B; 20 to 25 minutes, 13.4% to 14.8% B; 25 to 28 minutes, 14.8% to 17% B; 28 to 43 minutes, 17 to 17.3% B; 43 to 50 minutes, 17.3% to 20% B; 50 to 52 minutes, 20% to 21.5% B; 52 to 55 minutes, 21.5% to 21.6% B; 55 to 70 minutes, 21.6% to 22.1% B; 70 to 71 minutes, 22.1% to 22.5% B; 71 to 76 minutes, 22.5% to 23.5% B; 76 to 86 minutes, 23.5% to 25% B; 86 to 90 minutes, 25% to 29% B; 90 to 95 minutes, 29% B. The eluate was monitored by a diode array detector at the wave length of 335 nm. The injection volume was 5 μL at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The column oven temperature was maintained at 25°C. Peaks were assigned by comparing their retention time with that of each reference compound eluted in this mobile phase and by spiking samples with references dehydroevarine (D22GB172079, purity ≥ 98.0%), pharmacorhizine (Z05D10X104878, purity ≥ 98.0%), palmatine hydrochloride (Z16J10X79792, purity ≥ 98.0%) and berberine hydrochloride (S01A10K94340, purity ≥ 98.0%), which were purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. In addition, fingerprints of ZJW from 10 batches were identified. Animals, Induction of CRC and Treatments BALB/c mice (male, 20-22 g, 6-8 weeks old) were purchased from Hunan Slack Jingda Experimental Animal Co., Ltd. (Hunan, China). After 1 week of acclimatization under specific pathogen-free conditions (55% ± 2% humidity, 25°C, 12-h light/dark cycle), CT26 cells in logarithmic growth phase were adjusted to 1 × 10⁷ cells/mL. A 200 μL suspension was injected subcutaneously into the right axilla of each mouse. And mice with tumor sizes of 100 to 150 mm 3 Figure 1 Figure 1. Diagram of Animal modeling. CT26 cells was injected subcutaneously into the underarm of the right forelimb of mice. On day 7, mice with tumor sizes of 100 to 150 mm 3 Diagram describes experiment involving animal modeling: CT26 cells injected, right forelimb of mice on Day 7, tumor-sized 100-150 mm3 selected for follow-up, mice divided into six groups: Control, Model, ZJW-L, ZJW-M, ZJW-H, and 5-FU - ZJW oral administered daily from Day 7-21, 5-FU injected every 3 days Tumor Size and Spleen Index On day 21, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and tumors were gathered and photographed. Then, the volume and weight of tumor was measured and recorded. At the end of this study, the tumor volume of the mice adhered to the requirements of animal ethics.  19 Analysis of Cytokines in Serum After sacrificed, blood was collected from mice and left for 2 hours, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C, and serum was collected. Serum immune cytokines TGF-β (Enzyme Linked, Cat#YJ057830), IL-1β (Enzyme Linked, Cat#YJ098416), IL-6 (Enzyme Linked, Cat#YJ063159), IL-10 (Enzyme Linked, Cat#YJ037873), TNF-α (Enzyme Linked, Cat#YJ002095), and IL-12 (Enzyme Linked, Cat#037868) were detected by ELISA kits according to manufacturer’s instructions. Results were expressed as pg/mL of serum in each sample. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of Tumor Tissues Paraffin-embedded sections (4 µm) of tumor were analyzed for Ki67 (1:400, Proteintech, Cat#27309-1-AP, RRID: AB_2756525), iNOS (1:400, Proteintech, Cat#22226-1-AP, RRID: AB_2879038), and Arg-1 (1:400, Proteintech, Cat#16001-1-AP, RRID: AB_2289842). After extracting the antigen, the expression was detected by primary antibody at 4°C overnight. Biotin-labeled secondary antibody and streptavidin HRP were incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. The immune reaction was detected with 3-3-diaminobenzidine and then re-stained with hematoxylin. Immunofluorescence (IF) of Tumor Tissues TSA Fluorescence System Kit (Servicebio) was used to detect CD3 and CD8.Briefly, rabbit anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (1:200; Servicebio, Cat#GB13014, RRID: AB_2920578), rabbit anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody (1:250; Servicebio, Cat#GB15068, RRID: AB_3246431), and goat anti-rabbit HRP (1:200, Bioss) were used as secondary antibodies. The tissue sections were then incubated with an Alexa Fluor-488 secondary antibody (1:1000, Servicebio, Cat#GB25303, RRID: AB_2910224) for 2 hours. Following washed with 5% PBST, and the cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The sections were finally sealed with anti-fluorescence quenching mounting agent, all tissue sections were examined using fluorescence microscopy (NIKON). To detect the co-localization of F4/80 and CD206 in tumor tissues, after antigen repair, tissue sections were incubated with 3% H 2 2 GB113373 GB113497 Cell Viability Assays To analyze the given experimental setup for determining cell proliferation using the CCK-8 assay, seeding of cells in 96-well plates was performed. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 4 Transwell Assay and Trypan Blue Assay Detected the Migration and Proliferation of CT26 Cells and MC38 Cells in the Co-culture System In the transwell assay, the control group (conventional cultured RAW264.7), M2 TAMs group (20 ng/mL IL4/IL13 induced cultured RAW264.7 for 48 hours), M2 TAMs + ZJW group (RAW264.7 co-cultured with 20 ng/mL IL4/IL13 + 32 μg/mL ZJW for 48 hours) were inoculated into the lower chamber of transwell plate with 1 × 10 5 5 2 In the trypan blue viability assay, 1 × 10 5 5 Flow Cytometry The cells in each well were digested with 0.5 mL of 0.25%trypsin-EDTA for 3 minutes at 37°C. The suspension was transferred to centrifuge tubes, centrifuged at 300 g Isolation of TAMs Tumor tissue was cut into small fragments, and the tissue fragments were digested using collagenase VIII (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#9001-12-1) for 1 hours at 37°C. After digestion, the suspension was filtered through a 70 μm mesh to remove larger tissue pieces and clusters and resulted in a single-cell suspension. The cell suspension was centrifuged and washed twice with PBS to remove residual enzyme and other debris. The cells were resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium and left to adhere for 40 minutes. After the adhesion period, non-adherent cells were washed away, leaving behind primarily macrophages. The remaining adherent cells, which were flat or irregularly shaped and attached to the surface of the petri dish, were characterized as TAMs based on their morphology and positivity for the macrophage-specific marker F4/80. The protocol was designed to efficiently isolate TAMs from tumor tissues, leveraging the inherent properties of macrophages such as adhesion and specific marker expression. The isolated TAMs could then be used for further experiments. Western Blot Analysis The cells were collected and lysed using cold RIPA buffer (Beyotime Biotechnology, Cat#P0013C). After the cells were lysed, the protein concentration in the resulting lysate was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Cat#P0010). A consistent amount of protein, 20 μg, from each sample was loaded onto a Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel. The separated proteins were then transferred onto a 0.22 μm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. The PVDF membranes were incubated with primary antibodies iNOS (1:1000, Proteintech, Cat#22226-1-AP, RRID: AB_2879038), Arg1 (1:1000, Proteintech, Cat#16001-1-AP, RRID: AB_2289842), JAK2 (1:1000, ABclonal, Cat#A11497, RRID: AB_2758584), p Quantitative Real-Time PCR Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher, Cat#15596026CN), the concentration and purity of RNA were calculated, and reverse transcription was performed according to the TaKaRa ® 2 2 −△△Ct Network Pharmacology The targets of the herbs ( Coptis chinensis Evodia rutaecarpa https://old.tcmsp-e.com/ http://www.tcmip.cn/ETCM2 http://www.disgenet.org/ http://www.genecards.org https://omim.org/ https://www.string-db.org/ https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ Statistical Analysis All the statistics shown were presented as mean ± SD with GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, CA, USA).

ZJW Enhanced the Anti-Tumor Immune Effect of CRC Mice The immune cytokines in the serum of mice were determined by using ELISA. The data showed that the levels of immune cytokines IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β, TNF-α, and TGF-β that promote the immunosuppressive microenvironment, were abnormally elevated in the model group compared to the control group, which indicated the intervention of ZJW may significantly down-regulated IL-6, IL-10, IL-1β, TNF-α, and TGF-β. However, IL-12, which have anti-tumor effects, were abnormally reduced in CRC tumor-bearing mice. It was found that the intervention of ZJW may up-regulate IL-12 and promote the anti-tumor immune effect ( Figure 4A Figure 4B C  20 Figure 4.

Effects of ZJW on JAK2/STAT3 Signaling Pathway in Macrophages In order to verify the results of network pharmacology-related signaling pathway analysis, Western blot was used to determine the protein levels of JAK2, p Figure 9E F p Discussion Colorectal cancer (CRC), an aggressive malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract, ranks as one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer globally. The development and progression of CRC are intricate processes that involve not only genetically aberrant cancerous cells but also numerous elements within the encompassing tumorigenic cellular ecosystem.  20  21  22 + + Over the past 2 decades, mounting empirical evidence has demonstrated that the tumor microenvironment (TME) assumes significance equal to genetic and epigenetic mutations in tumor genesis, progression, and metastasis. 23 26  27  28 29 31  32  33  34  35 36 37 Animal experiments demonstrated that Zuojin Wan (ZJW) reduced serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, TGF-β, IL-6, and IL-10 while increasing IL-12 in CRC-bearing mice. In CRC models, elevated TNF-α triggers pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1β and IL-6), initiating an inflammatory cascade. These cytokines collectively activate STAT3 signaling in tumor cells, sustaining proliferation. IL-1β further promotes M2 macrophage polarization, inducing immunosuppression. TGF-β activates cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that secrete collagen and fibronectin, forming a dense stromal barrier to create an immunosuppressive microenvironment facilitating CRC progression. 38 39 35 40 In vivo experiments demonstrated that Zuojin Wan (ZJW) downregulated CD206 and Arg1 expression while upregulating iNOS in CRC tumors, indicating inhibition of M2 TAMs polarization. Flow cytometry in vitro confirmed IL-4/IL-13-induced M2-like polarization in RAW264.7 macrophages, whereas ZJW suppressed M2 polarization and increased M1 macrophage proportion. Furthermore, Transwell assays revealed that ZJW-pretreated macrophages (stimulated with IL-4/IL-13 for 48 hours) significantly inhibited migration of co-cultured CT26 and MC38 cells. The trypan blue exclusion assay further showed ZJW enhanced macrophage-mediated suppression of CT26 and MC38 proliferation. Collectively, ZJW inhibits CRC cell migration and proliferation by blocking M2 TAMs polarization. Integrating these findings, we investigated the pathway through which ZJW inhibits M2 polarization of TAMs. The network pharmacology analysis revealed that ZJW could modulate TAMs polarization and exert anti-CRC effects by regulating kinase activity, epithelial cell proliferation, intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathways, and protein serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase activity. Additionally, our KEGG pathway enrichment analysis identified the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway as the most enriched among the targeted pathways. Research indicates that the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway serves as a central regulatory hub in the tumor microenvironment, driving the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward the pro-tumor M2 TAMs.  41 42 43  44 Conclusion In conclusion, integrated in vivo and in vitro experiments combined with network pharmacology demonstrate that Zuojin Wan (ZJW) suppresses the malignant progression of CRC by inhibiting M2 polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). This inhibition is mediated through suppression of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. A limitation of this study is the need for CRC in situ models and pathway agonists to further validate this mechanism.
