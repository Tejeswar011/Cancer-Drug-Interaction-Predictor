Currently, PC and LC represent the third leading cause of cancer-related death, while GCs and CRCs account for 4.8 million cancer cases and 4.4 million cancer deaths worldwide. Poor prognoses are mainly due to late diagnosis, limited efficacy of available treatments, tumour recurrence, as well as therapy-induced secondary tumorigenesis and drug resistance. In recent decades, these issues have been afforded using nanomaterials (NMs), with promising results. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are nonpareil nano systems, which have demonstrated high potential in both cancer diagnosis and treatment, showing to be excellent vehicles for drugs, antibodies, genes, etc. Used alone or in combination with available therapeutic strategies, such as photothermal, photodynamic, drug targeting, gene, immune, and chemotherapies, CNTs have shown notable results in laboratory settings, enhancing the anticancer effects and reducing toxic outcomes of traditional treatments. Anyway, despite PC, LC, and CRC being three of the five tumours (60%) considered the most perfidious and lethal cancers, studies on the use of these innovative NMs to cure them represent only 37% of those regarding the treatment of the most known tumours. Regarding this scenario of a worrying lack of efficient treatments for highly lethal PC, LC, GC, CRC, and RC, this umbrella review was drawn up to promote filling this gap in studies by reporting the still too limited and often obsolete experimentation on the possible use of CNTs for their diagnosis and therapy. To this end, such case studies have been collected in several informative Tables which are functional for readers, and the studies have been discussed. This study wants to sensitize scientists towards more extensive research to find novel safer applications of CNTs against PC, LC, GC, CRC, and RC, both in terms of early diagnoses and efficient treatments. Such efforts should also focus on clarifying the not yet fully unveiled toxicological aspects and regulatory hurdles, both of which persist around CNTs. Research should also be finalized to produce patents rather than journal articles, thus accelerating the translation of CNTs to clinical practice. carbon nanotubes (CNTs) CNT-improved anticancer therapies CNT-improved cancer diagnosis hepatopancreatic carcinoma intestinal cancer This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Cancer is a disease characterized by unrestrained cell development without contact inhibition, which in its metastatic forms invades other bodily organs causing dramatic impairments of organism functions [ 1 2 3 4 5 Helicobacter pylori 6 7 8 9 9 10 11 12 Furthermore, as the twelfth most common cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal disease [ 13 14 14 9 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 5 23 24 25 26 9 10 9 10 27 28 5 Methodology to Create This Review and Related Tables Concerning the collection of materials to create this review and construct Tables, a first search was made on both Scopus and PubMed database, crossing first the keyword “hepatopancreatic cancer, liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, intestinal cancer, carbon nanotubes”. Then, we cross similar keywords, substituting cancer with tumour. Results by these two procedures were unified for the searches made on both PubMed and on Scopus, obtaining two collections of articles. The collection accounting for the high number of studies was maintained, which was that which derived from research found on Scopus. From all articles found, review articles and obsolete studies were removed; then, only experimental works and preclinical and clinical trials, if present, were considered. Since to construct graphs available in Section 7 5 2. Nanotechnology for Improved Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis In this context of a limited and poorly efficient arsenal available to treat and diagnose cancer, nanotechnology has significantly contributed to transforming oncology by providing innovative therapeutic alternatives to overcome the limitations of conventional ones [ 29 30 31 32 32 33 A good number of these NMs, which have remarkably enhanced the efficiency of anticancer chemotherapeutics [ 1 34 30 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 51 46 CNTs have a nanosized diameter of a few nanometres and a micro sized variable length [ 52 53 5 52 54 55 5 5 56 57 Collectively, adequate functionalization has furnished modified CNTs, which in addition to being capable of carrying anticancer drugs and proteins for CNT-improved chemotherapy [ 58 5 59 CNTs have demonstrated great potential against difficult-to-treat cancers such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is a malignant cancer with a very high mortality rate around the world and very few existing efficient anti-TNBC drugs to treat it [ 60 60 61 Aiming at achieving a direct extermination of cancer cells, CNTs have also been utilized as enhanced photosensitizers for CNT-improved photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) [ 5 59 62 63 64 Moreover, despite CNTs possessing extraordinary physicochemical, mechanical, electrochemical, and electrochemiluminescence properties different from those of nanomaterials known so far [ 65 5 54 55 To address solubility and toxicological issues, several surface modifications have been carried out to increase their hydrophilicity and water dispersibility and decrease toxicity [ 64 66 67 52 52 Figure 1 1 In collecting information for editing our latest study concerning the use of CNTs in the treatment and diagnosis of the most common types of cancers [ 5 In this regard, due to the worrying lack of efficient treatments and diagnosis methods for these highly lethal and aggressive cancers and for the early detection of GC, the poor prognosis of which is mainly due to late diagnosis, this umbrella review was edited. Precisely, the still too limited and often obsolete experimentation on CNT applications for the diagnosis and therapy of PC, LC, GC, and CRC were discussed. To this end, the existing case studies on this topic found in the literature have been provided and discussed by using several informative and easy understandable Tables. Differently from the already existing reviews on the use of CNTs for treating cancers in general, the major scope of this study was to inform scientists about the high positive impact that CNTs could have if applied in the therapy and diagnosis of specific tumours, such as PC, LC, GC, CRC, and RC, in relation to the few and obsolete articles existing on the topic so far. Secondly, this paper aimed at sensitizing researchers towards more extensive research to find novel possible applications of CNTs against these difficult-to-treat malignancies, both in terms of early diagnosis and efficient treatment. In our opinion, such research should be focused more on the development of patents than to that of journal articles. We are strongly hopeful that the information provided here and the possible future patents inspired by this work could accelerate the translation of CNTs into clinical practice, which is still hampered by the not yet fully unveiled toxicological aspects, regulatory hurdles, and other factors, which have also been reviewed here. 3. Carbon Nanotubes for Anticancer Therapy and Cancer Diagnosis The following Figure 2 1 In anticancer biomedicine, CNTs have been widely studied as vectors for the transport and delivery of various agents, including contrast media, antigens, nucleotides, plasmids, therapeutic agents, etc. [ 5 5 1 1 5 69 69 1 In fact, in addition to surgery and traditional chemotherapy (CT), other current available therapeutic strategies include anticancer PTT, PDT, gene therapy (GT), immunotherapy (IT), and their association to realize combination therapy (COT) with enhanced outcomes due to synergistic effects [ 5 70 70 5 71 71 72 73 74 + 75 76 5 5 Table 1 Table 1 77 Table 1 Table 1 Almost all studies on the use of CNTs to manage cancers established that they can be used to develop multimodal platforms capable of efficiently realizing the simultaneous early cancer detection and enhanced cancer treatment [ 1 78 79 80 81 82 83 3 4 84 5 5 Table S1 Supplementary Materials 4. Hepatopancreatic Cancer Therapy and Diagnosis Using CNTs 4.1. Carbon Nanotubes for Pancreatic and Hepatocellular Cancers Diagnosis Early detection is essential for reducing mortality from pancreatic and hepatocellular cancers, but conventional screening methods can be invasive, expensive, time consuming, and have low efficiency [ 85 85 85 86 4.1.1. Carbon Nanotubes for Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis As above reported, PC is an aggressive lethal tumour, with a low survival rate which reaches only 5–7% in its IV-stage advanced forms. Since PC is refractory to conventional chemotherapy regimens it is often treated with surgical resection [ 87 88 89 90 91 92 86 93 94 95 95 96 97 97 PC can also be diagnosed based on the amount of guanine and deoxy guanine triphosphate (dGTP) residues present in the DNA of PC patients recruited. To this end, Liu et al. developed MWCNT-modified glassy carbon electrochemical sensors, which were successful in PC diagnosis when combined with the technique of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [ 98 99 99 4.1.2. Carbon Nanotubes for Liver Cancer Diagnosis Human liver cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer globally, with more cases in Asia and Africa than in Europe [ 100 100 100 100 Li et al. developed a novel immune-sensing method for simultaneously detecting three LC biomarkers, such as α-fetoprotein (AFP), α-fetoprotein variants (AFP-L3), and abnormal prothrombin (APT), by immobilizing proper antibodies on gold-coated CNTs (Au@CNTs) and labelling the obtained nanocomposite with redox probes (anti-Au@CNTs@rdx) [ 101 Figure 3 102 Due to the use of bio-orthogonal reactions, the biosensor possessed regulable LOD for Golgi protein 73 and α-fetoprotein, while the amount of HRP and ALP on the sensor affected its sensitivity. LODs were in the unprecedented order of tens of pg/mL toward HRP and ALP [ 102 101 104 104 2 2 105 2 2 105 The various methods of sensing PC, HCC, and LC using CNTs are summarized in Table 2 Table 3 Table 2 4.1.3. Discussion on the Case Studies Previously Reported Collectively, at least in laboratory settings, the use of CNT surfaces to anchor antibodies or other elements to detect CA19-9 biomarkers at very low concentrations could be an appealing strategy to realize the early diagnosis of PC and to distinguish between PC patients and those with other diseases in which CA19-9 is present. Chemical interactions have been reported as the most responsible factors for CA19-9 adsorption. They are tuneable by modifying surface physicochemical properties of CNTs [ 97 Table 2 Table 3 Anyway, due to their amazing electronic properties, SWCNTs have gained great attention in electrochemical biosensing. 4.2. Pancreatic Cancer Therapy Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal cancers, the poor prognosis and low-rate survival of which mainly depend on the emergence of chemoresistance and frequent relapses [ 112 112 113 114 115 116 117 117 118 119 120 121 121 121 121 121 122 Table 4 Iancu et al. non-covalently functionalized MWCNTs with human serum albumin (HSA) and assessed the efficiency of the achieved HSA@MWCNT complex in the photothermal ablation of PC cells by administering it intra-aerially to the resected cancer tissue (ex vivo) [ 123 123 124 Later, Mahmood et al. co-administered SWCNTs and etoposide, a drug used commonly in chemotherapy to treat several types of tumours, observing a synergic effect [ 125 133 134 135 126 Conversely, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used by Mocan et al. to modify MWCNTs, obtaining PEG@MWCNTs nanocomposites which were used as photosensitizers to induce hyperthermia under laser radiation and realize a CNT-improved PTT anticancer treatment against PC cells [ 127 127 128 129 4.3. Liver Cancer Therapy Like PC, liver cancer (LC) is another type of very aggressive and lethal cancer which is difficult to treat because of the tumour location deep in the tissue [ 112 22 112 2 f 136 136 136 137 137 Later, Ji et al. used chitosan (CHI)- and folic acid (FA)-modified SWCNTs, producing a nanocomposite (CHI@FA@SWCNTs) for the targeted drug delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) in vitro and in vivo [ 138 138 138 139 139 139 ® 2 140 Table 5 In the past, Gu et al. engineered doxorubicin (DOX) and hydrazine-benzoic acid (HBA) bearing SWCNTs via hydrazine bonding, producing nanocomposites (DOX@SWCNTs and DOX@HBA@SWCNTs) which were tested on HepG2 LC cells to assess their release profiles and cytotoxic effects [ 141 141 141 Sobhani et al. synthesized 80% w w v v 130 130 As it was anticipated by our survey which inspired this study, the studies available on the experimentations of CNT-based nanocomposites for the treatment of PC and LC are very limited (10 concerning PC and 7 concerning LC), and date back more than 10 years ago. Curiously, although the urgent need for novel treatment options to improve the poor diagnosis of PC and LC and the low survival rates of patients bearing these lethal tumours, and despite their excellent outcomes, these early studies scarcely stimulated scientists in the field to make further in vitro and in vivo experiments to deepen our knowledge about this promising nanotechnology. As confirmation, the subsequent Table 6 5 With the aim of improving the accumulation of an anticancer drug (sorafenib) in LC in situ, Elsayed et al. developed sorafenib (SOR)-loaded functionalized CNTs. They produced SOR@ f 142 f 142 Since LyP-1 is a peptide binding pancreatic cancer cells, Lin et al. synthesized MWCNTs functionalized with LyP-1 residues (LyP-1@ f f 57 Figure 4 f 57 Lobaplatin (LOB) was loaded on PEG@CNTs, and the resulting LOB@PEG@CNTs nanocomposite was labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FLUO) to visualize the cellular uptake of SOR into HepG2 cells by Yu et al. [ 143 143 Table 7 5 4.4. Discussion on the Case Studies Previously Reported All these studies confirmed that CNTs could be excellent vectors for anticancer drugs, genetic materials, antibodies, etc., thus allowing enhanced CT, IT, and GT. Furthermore, they demonstrated great potential to develop nanocomposite sensitizers for enhanced PTT. Additionally, the functionalization of CNTs surfaces with proper ligands which can be recognized by PC and LC cells, as well as the engineering of CNTs nanocomposites structured to be capable of recognizing specific constituents of the TME or of being responsive to specific signals/conditions of the TME, could permit high accumulation at tumour sites thus allowing targeted therapy and low side effects to normal cells. Differently from CNT-based biosensors, CNT-based nanocomposites experimented for PC and LC therapy were made of both SWCNTs and MWCNTs, with a light preference for using SWCNTs. SWCNTs are more efficient in drug delivery applications than MWCNTs since they have an ultra-high surface area and good drug loading capacity. Therefore, they are preferred over MWCNTs for realizing DDSs. The major concerns with the use of SWCNTs remain their insolubility and their higher level of impurities, which can cause toxicity. These issues can largely restrict their importance in biological and biomedical applications in vivo. Anyway, to improve the solubility of SWCNTs in aqueous solutions, pegylated nanocomposites with biocompatible properties have been widely designed. 5. Carbon Nanotubes for Gastric and Colorectal Cancer Therapy and Diagnosis Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the foremost cancer-related causes of death, characterized by poor diagnosis and low survival rate, mainly because GC is often at advanced stages already at first diagnosis [ 112 112 5 5.1. Carbon Nanotubes for Gastric and Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis Early detection is essential for reducing mortality from gastrointestinal cancers (GICs), but conventional screening methods can be invasive, expensive, time consuming, and inefficient [ 85 86 2 146 147 225 89 148 225 89 148 148 148 89 148 The effective labelling of Colon-26 cells utilizing an oxidized and PEGylated SWCNT (o-SWCNT@PEG)-based over-thousand-nanometre (OTN)-near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe has been reported by Sekiyama et al. [ 149 149 150 150 151 2 152 153 f 153 153 Table 8 5.2. Carbon Nanotubes for Gastric and Colorectal Cancer Therapy In the year 2009, a hydrophilic MWCNT-based drug delivery system (DDS), namely HCPT@DATEG@ f 154 f 154 155 155 156 157 158 + + + 158 158 159 160 152 2 152 161 50 161 162 162 f- 163 163 164 165 166 166 167 166 168 169 170 166 168 170 Sundaram et al. engineered hyaluronic acid (HA)- and chlorin e6 (Ce6)-modified SWCNTs, achieving a HA@Ce6@SWCNTs nanocomposite whose anticancer effects were assessed when used for PDT to eradicate Caco-2 colon cancer cells [ 171 Figure 5 Flow cytometry results indicate that the CNT-improved PDT enhanced both early- and late-stage apoptosis in comparison to control cells and to the use of free Ce6 [ 171 Collectively, although noticeable among the research related to this field, these studies are still too few (14), as in the case of the hepatopancreatic cancer. Moreover, among these limited experiments the in vivo ones were rarely paid attention (4 out of 16, 25%). Tripisciano et al. have encapsulated irinotecan (Ir), a chemotherapeutic commonly used to treat colorectal cancer, into MWCNTs with a large inner diameter, achieving the nanoformulation Ir@MWCNTs which demonstrated high drug-filling efficiency (∼32 wt.%) for the antineoplastic agent [ 172 172 225 89 148 89 148 Studies, dating back more than 10 years have been summarized in Table 9 Table 10 5.3. Discussion on the Case Studies Previously Reported Case studies reported in Table 8 146 147 Table 9 Table 10 Table 8 Table 9 Table 10 Table 9 Table 10 Table 10 6. Main Factors Which Hamper CNTs Translation in Clinical Practice All nanomaterial (NM)-based drugs encounter several translational barriers and challenging steps to be approved for clinical practice, and they have been schematized in Figure 6 173 Anyway, several nanomaterial-based products are already on the market and used mainly to treat cancers, and even more are in clinical development. The greatest use of NMs in clinical trials encompasses a variety of drug delivery platforms, including polymeric micelles, liposomes, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles, loaded with already approved drugs [ 173 ® ® 30 35 36 173 ® 173 5 52 54 55 77 52 54 5 52 54 Mainly, surface functionalization, enhanced purity, and not-defective CNTs can reduce their toxicity, while optimization of CNTs physicochemical properties, such as surface area, diameter, and length, can play a key role in governing their biocompatibility [ 174 175 176 1 177 178 179 179 180 181 182 183 184 2 185 CNTs with enhanced long-term biocompatibility, degradation, and clearance in vivo are urgently needed to allow in clinic practice the exploitation of the great potential of CNTs observed in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies. Galassi et al. assessed in vivo the short- and long-term biodistribution and biocompatibility of a single-chirality DNA-encapsulated SWCNTs complex using male C57BL/6 mice at 6–12 weeks of age [ 186 186 186 Also, a wide dissertation on the regulatory hurdles concerning the production and application of CNTs in several sectors can be found in our previous papers [ 52 54 52 54 187 187 Collectively, the main problems which still delay CNTs clinical application in cancers treatment, comprise the not fully clarified mechanism that govern the CNTs effects in the diagnosis and therapy of cancer, the not fully unveiled mechanisms of action of CNTs on normal cells and tissues, the potential toxic effects which can occur due to their special structure, the not fully clarified mechanisms of CNT-induced toxicity, and the low biodegradability of raw CNTs due to their hydrophobic properties which prevent enzymes from approaching them, thus impeding enzymatic degradation [ 5 188 6.1. Approaches to Reduce Possible CNT Toxicity CNTs can accumulate in the environment and human bodies, thus possessing potential severe hazardous outcomes which can also be caused from the CNT-induced activation of toxic systems in the tissues of organisms that encounter them [ 55 189 190 191 192 193 194 55 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 Table 11 5 6.2. CNTs Technologies Closest to the Clinical Application However, despite all of the promises associated with the application of CNTs in biomedicine, the most important concerns continuously raised by scientists are based on CNT nanotoxicology and the environmental effects of CNTs, mostly due to their non-biodegradable state, which justify the lack of widespread FDA approval for CNTs [ 56 The CNT technologies closest to clinical application regard those finalized for the preparation of CNT-based nanocomposites for cancer diagnosis and imaging. At the moment, no clinical practice has ever been reported concerning the application of CNTs as DDSs in cancer treatments and diagnosis, while there are some clinical trial cases that assessed the employment of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) in lymphatic monitoring during colorectal cancer surgeries, lymph nodes collection in advanced gastric cancer, and lymph node biopsy of papillary thyroid carcinoma, confirming the great potential and promising future of CNTs in cancer theragnostic [ 202 203 204 Tables S2 and S3 in Supplementary Materials 205 206 207 NCT01773850 206 Other clinical trials regarded the application of CNTs to treat dental caries [ 208 209 210 7. Authors Considerations According to Figure 7 5 5 This percentage even worsens if clinically approved anticancer nanomaterials are considered, where only 22% of those on the market are finalized to treat PC, metastatic PC, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular cancer/liver cancer (HCC/LC) ( Table 12 30 35 36 Figure 8 Table 12 68 Figure 8 Table 12 Additionally, despite gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) not being among the five most lethal tumours, it carries a very poor prognosis, mainly due to the late stage of diagnosis [ 78 Figure 9 Figure 9 5 Figure 9 Collectively, the studies concerning the application of CNT-based nanocomposites to treat and detect PC, LC, GC, CRC, and RC account for 51% of those concerning the most relevant tumours ( Figure 8 Figure 9 8. Conclusions and Recommendations Nowadays, it is generally recognized that early diagnosis is crucial to improving the chances of effective treatment and cure for all tumours. Detecting cancer in its early stages can mean a greater chance of successful treatment and a better quality of life for patients. Prevention policies and continuous population screening are in place for most tumours and several diagnosis steps and methods exist, such as blood and urine tests to detect specific markers indicating the presence of a possible neoplasm; genetic tests; diagnostic imaging, including X-ray, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); and biopsy and histopathological analyses which are more efficient than anticancer drugs or anticancer treatments for tumours when discovered. Anyway, new more efficient options to both treat and detect tumours are urgently needed to improve patients’ conditions, quality of life, compliance with therapies, and survival rate. As already evidenced in our previous paper on the use of CNTs to detect and treat the most known cancers, this umbrella review has evidenced more in-depth the great advantages which could be derived from applying CNTs to engineer CNT-based devices for the diagnosis and therapy of specific tumours, including the most lethal and perfidious cancers (CRC, PC, and LC) and the cancers having a low survival rate due to too late diagnosis or the lack of efficient instruments for early diagnosis (GC). Used alone or in combination with available therapeutic strategies, such as photothermal, photodynamic, drug targeting, and gene, immune, and chemotherapies, CNTs have shown notable results in laboratory settings in allowing the manufacturing of therapeutics and theragnostics with enhanced anticancer efficiency and reduced toxic effects compared to traditional chemotherapeutics. Anyway, data reported in this review have also evidenced that despite PC, LC, and CRC are reported as the three among the five tumours (60%) considered the most aggressive cancers affecting humans, GC has a very low survival rate due to a too late diagnosis, and the potential for CNTs to ameliorate this scenario has been confirmed, studies on the use of CNTs to treat them represent only the 37% of those regarding the CNT-based treatment of tumours in the complex. Still too limited and often obsolete experimentation on the possible use of CNTs for the diagnosis and therapy of such tumours is a great concern which needs a solution. The scope of this review was to sensitize researchers to pay more attention to the great advantage that the association of CNTs with anticancer drugs, anticancer treatments, and methods for cancer diagnosis could have. The more efficient treatments and early diagnosis of all cancers, which could derive from extensive and safe applications of carbon nanotubes, could significantly ameliorate patients’ survival rate and quality of life by reducing doses and times of treatments, and therefore their side effects.
