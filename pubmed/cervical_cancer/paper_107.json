License ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ Purpose Brachytherapy is a well-established modality in oncology, particularly for prostate and cervical cancers, offering precise radiation delivery while sparing healthy tissues. Despite its clinical benefits, the research trajectory of brachytherapy in clinical trials remains underexplored. This bibliometric analysis aimed to assess publication trends, research focus areas, and citation impact of prospective clinical trials on brachytherapy. Material and methods A bibliometric analysis was conducted using Web of Science database. Clinical trials were identified with key words “brachytherapy” and “prospective”, without time restrictions. Bibliometric parameters analyzed included year of publication, journal distribution, authorship, institutional and geographical contributions, citation metrics, and disease focus. Results A total of 84 clinical trials published between 1982 and 2024 were analyzed. The United States was the leading contributor (44.0%). Prostate cancer was the most frequently studied malignancy (35.7%), followed by breast (15.5%) and gynecologic cancers (13.1%). The “International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics” published the most trials. Citation analysis showed significant differences among cancer types, with soft tissue sarcoma studies having the highest median citation count ( p Conclusions While clinical trial research in brachytherapy has expanded over time, notable disparities in research intensity and citation impact exist among disease sites. Greater attention to underrepresented malignancies, along with sustained investment, interdisciplinary collaboration, and enhanced training, is needed to advance the role of brachytherapy in cancer care. bibliometric analysis brachytherapy publication trends clinical trials collaborative networks pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Purpose Over the past decades, clinical trials have played a pivotal role in refining brachytherapy techniques, optimizing treatment protocols, and expanding their applications across different cancer types. A comprehensive analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov data from 1980 to 2023 identified 446 brachytherapy-related trials, with a significant increase in registrations post-2010. These studies predominantly focused on prostate, cervical, liver, endometrial, and breast cancers, underscoring the versatility of brachytherapy in oncologic treatments [ 1 Bibliometric analyses serve as valuable tools to assess the evolution and impact of research within a specific domain [ 2 3 3 Despite the proven efficacy of brachytherapy, its utilization has experienced fluctuations, potentially due to factors, such as limited training opportunities, resource constraints, and the advent of alternative therapies. A bibliometric evaluation of clinical trials from 2000 to 2015 indicated a stagnation in the number of new brachytherapy trials, contrasting with an overall increase in radiotherapy studies. This underscores the need for renewed focus and investment in brachytherapy research to harness its therapeutic potential [ 4 In this paper, we aimed to conduct a bibliometric analysis of prospective clinical trials on brachytherapy, elucidating publication trends, research focus areas, and collaborative patterns. By mapping the trajectory of brachytherapy research, we seek to identify gaps and opportunities that can inform future clinical practices and research endeavors. Material and methods The Web of Science database was employed to identify eligible studies, with key words “brachytherapy” and “prospective” used in the search. Clinical trials tab was selected as the document type. With no time limit set, 84 articles were identified and analyzed. All studies were checked for duplicate reporting before statistical evaluation, and no duplicate reporting was found. The PRISMA diagram showing the selection phase of the studies is provided in Figure 1 Fig. 1 The PRISMA diagram showing the selection phase of the studies We evaluated bibliometric parameters, such as journal, year of publication, authors, department of the first author, country of correspondence, total citation number, and average citation per year (CPY). All analyses were performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 20.0 for Windows. Variables were tested using visual (bar charts) and analytic methods (Kolmogorov-Smirnov/Shapiro-Wilk’s tests) to determine whether or not they were normally distributed. Descriptive analyses were done using frequencies for each bibliometric parameter extracted. Characteristics of the selected articles were described by using frequencies and proportions for dichotomous and categorical variables. As the average CPY was not normally distributed, Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U p Results The whole data of 84 clinical trials listed historically from newest to oldest are presented in Supplementary material Figure 2 n Table 1 n Figure 3 Figure 4 Supplementary material Fig. 2 Distribution of prospective clinical trials on brachytherapy by year Fig. 3 Distribution of prospective clinical trials on brachytherapy by country Fig. 4 Illustration of map-based bibliometric analysis results Table 1 Journal distributions Publication titles Count International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics 16 Brachytherapy 13 Radiotherapy and Oncology 12 Radiation Oncology 3 European Journal of Cancer 2 Gynecologic Oncology 2 Japanese Journal of Clinical Oncology 2 Journal of Clinical Oncology 2 American Journal of Roentgenology 1 Annals of Surgical Oncology 1 Breast Cancer 1 Breast Journal 1 Cancer 1 Chest 1 Circulation 1 Clinical Oncology 1 Clinical Research in Cardiology 1 European Journal of Radiology 1 European Journal of Surgical Oncology 1 European Urology Oncology 1 Indian Journal of Cancer 1 International Journal of Gynecological Cancer 1 International Journal of Urology 1 Journal of Endourology 1 Journal of Gynecologic Oncology 1 Journal of Korean Medical Science 1 Journal of Radiation Research 1 Journal of the American College of Surgeons 1 Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery 1 Lancet Oncology 1 Lung Cancer 1 Medicine 1 Ophthalmology 1 Pathology Oncology Research 1 Radiology 1 Strahlentherapie und Onkologie 1 Tumori 1 Urology 1 World Journal of Surgical Oncology 1 World Journal of Urology 1 For the whole cohort, the median total citation value and average citation count per year were 29.5 (range, 0-748) and 2.04 (range, 0-24.83), respectively.

The predominance of studies on prostate, cervical, and breast cancers highlights their central role in brachytherapy research. Strong contribution of the United States reflects the country’s leadership in radiation oncology [ 1 3 A noticeable rise in trial activity after 2010 may be attributed to technological innovations, such as image-guided brachytherapy (IGBT) and advanced radionuclide sources [ 4 5 Interestingly, soft tissue sarcoma and brain tumor studies exhibited the higher median citation counts, indicating an increased academic interest. The statistically significant citation difference between STS and other malignancies (except for brain tumors) may stem from the novelty or clinical challenges of brachytherapy in these settings [ 6 Despite the demonstrated benefits of brachytherapy, its overall representation in clinical trials is limited compared with other radiotherapy modalities. Contributing factors may include declining training programs, logistical barriers, and increased adoption of alternatives, such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and proton therapy [ 7 8 9 Our study is not without limitations. It includes only articles indexed in the Web of Science database, potentially omitting relevant studies. Additionally, citation metrics may not always reflect clinical relevance. Future research should include multiple databases and integrated qualitative assessments of clinical outcomes to provide a more holistic view. In our study, while the prospective studies on brachytherapy were evaluated from the Web of Science database with the title tab, future studies using similar topics under different tabs, such as topic and abstract, will provide a more detailed evaluation. Conclusions This bibliometric analysis underscores key patterns in prospective brachytherapy research, including dominant cancer types, geographic contributors, and citation trends. While prostate cancer continues to lead research activity, a broader focus on underrepresented malignancies is warranted. Given brachytherapy’s unique clinical value, future efforts should support its advancement through cross-disciplinary collaboration, targeted funding, and educational initiatives, to sustain its role in modern oncologic care.
