However, due to the large surgical trauma, long operation time, and the need to implant exogenous fixation, the risk of postoperative infections in patients is relatively high ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 2 Subjects and methods 2.1 Design Retrospective comparative test. 2.2 Time and place The trial was completed from January 2020 to December 2023 in the Department of Orthopaedics, the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. 2.3 Inclusion criteria i. Age ≥18 years old; ii. Diagnosed with Degenerative spinal disease by clinical and imaging examination; iii. Including the following procedures: Spinal Stenosis Decompression; Discectomy for Herniated Disc; Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion with Internal Fixation for Spondylolisthesis, among others; iv. Data and follow-up results were complete. v. Passed by the Ethics Committee of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, NO.20240710-01. All patients signed an informed consent form prior to surgery, which included the following clause: “Anonymized medical data may be used for medical research purposes”. 2.4 Exclusion criteria i. patients with a history of previous spinal surgery; ii. patients with pathological fractures caused by tumours or infections; iii. patients with severe neurological, psychiatric, or basic illnesses or other inability to cooperate with pain assessment; iv. patients with a body mass index >35 kg/m 2 2.5 General information 380 patients with spinal disorders who underwent surgery in our hospital from January 2020–December 2023 were selected for the study. They were divided into 301 cases in the uninfected group and 79 cases in the infected group according to whether or not infection occurred within 7 days after surgery. At least two of the following criteria were met for infection: 1. the bacterial culture results of the tissues were positive; 2. the tissues showed a significant increase in neutrophils under high magnification; and 3. the presence of signs and symptoms of infection, such as redness, fever, tenderness, swelling, pain, etc., and the infection was also supported by laboratory tests and imaging tests. All spinal surgeries were performed at the Spinal Surgery Center (Provincial Referral Center for Spinal Disorders) of the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. The procedures were conducted by a team of four attending physicians and senior specialists with spinal surgery qualifications (each possessing >10 years of spinal surgery experience), strictly adhering to standardized surgical protocols. The scope of treatment includes: Spinal Stenosis Decompression; Discectomy for Herniated Disc; Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion with Internal Fixation for Spondylolisthesis, among others. 2.6 Test method The human CRP and ALB enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Item No.: H-EL-CRP, HEL-ALB) were purchased from Shanghai Zeye Biotechnology Co. The ELX800 automatic enzyme labeller was purchased from BIO-TEK, USA. Peripheral venous blood was drawn on an empty stomach 24 h before and 24 h after the operation, and was divided into two portions; one portion was tested for blood routine using the automatic blood cell analyser and its accompanying kit to calculate NLR; the other portion was centrifuged at 2,500 r/min for 10 min to separate serum, and then CRP and ALB levels were measured by using the CRP and ALB ELISA kits and the enzyme marker to calculate CRP/ALB ratios. 2.7 Evaluating indicator General information was collected, including gender, age, body mass index (BMI), past history, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, smoking history, and history of alcohol consumption; surgical information, including time of surgery, surgical site, the presence of blood transfusion, and the presence of internal fixation; and test results, including NLR and CRP/ALB ratio, were recorded. Infection definition: According to the Guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Infectious Diseases Society (IDSA). 2.7.1 Superficial surgical site infection (SSI) Infection within 30 days post-surgery involving only skin/subcutaneous tissue, with ≥1 of: • Purulent drainage from the incision. • Positive aseptic culture. • Symptoms (pain/swelling/erythema) + deliberate opening by surgeon. 2.7.2 Deep/implant-related infection Infection within 90 days involving deep soft tissues (fascia/muscle) or implants, with ≥1 of: • Purulent drainage from deep tissue. • Abscess/infection seen during reoperation/histopathology. • Symptoms (fever/localized pain) + positive deep tissue/implant culture. 2.8 Statistical methods SPSS26.0 statistical software was used to statistically analyse the patients' gender, age, BMI, past history, surgical data, and test results. Firstly, one-way factor analysis was performed, and the count data were expressed as cases (rate) by x 2 t P P 3 Results 3.1 Analysis of participant number 380 spinal surgery patients were included, divided into 2 groups according to whether they were infected or not, 79 in the infected group and 301 in the uninfected group, and all of them were entered into the analysis of the results, with no dropout data. 3.2 Test flow chart The group flow chart of the two groups is shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 Flow chart of patient assignment. Flowchart depicting patient selection for a study. From 391 qualified patients, 11 are excluded: 4 with active tuberculosis, 5 with other spinal diseases, 2 unable to tolerate surgery. Final inclusion is 380; 301 in the uninfected group and 79 in the infected group, all entering outcome analysis. 3.3 A unifactorial analysis of infections occurring after spinal surgery The results of univariate analysis showed that the differences in age, diabetes mellitus, operation time, blood transfusion, internal fixation, postoperative NLR and postoperative CRP/ALB ratio were statistically significant when comparing the two groups ( P P Table 1 Figure 2 Table 1 Results of the univariate analysis of the infection occurring after spinal surgery.

Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve showing the performance of various factors in predicting outcomes. The factors include internal fixation, blood transfusion, age, post NLR, post CRPALB, and operation time. Each factor is represented by a different colored line, with corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values and confidence intervals. The gray dashed line indicates the baseline. Sensitivity is plotted against 1-specificity. 3.5 Predicted value analysis The results showed that the features of internal fixation, blood transfusion, age, postoperative NLR, postoperative CRP/ALB ratio and operation time, the results showed that the AUC value of the internal fixation feature was 0.626, which had medium predictive ability, with low sensitivity and high specificity; the AUC value of the blood transfusion feature was only 0.577, which had relatively low predictive ability; the AUC value of the age feature was 0.770, which showed good predictive The AUC value for the age feature was 0.770, showing good predictive ability with good sensitivity and specificity; the AUC value for the postoperative NLR feature was 0.791, also with good predictive ability; especially prominent was the postoperative CRP/ALB ratio feature, which had an AUC value of 0.878, with high sensitivity and specificity, indicating its excellent performance in predicting the target; and the AUC value for the surgical time feature was 0.752, with predictive ability is fair. The optimal thresholds for each feature also varied, providing an important reference for clinical decision-making.

Overall, the results suggest that postoperative inflammatory-related indicators (such as Post-CRP/ALB ratio, Post-NLR) and age are core predictive factors, and their application potential needs to be further validated in clinical context. The results of multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that older age, longer duration of surgery, intraoperative blood transfusion, use of internal fixation, and elevated postoperative NLR and CRP/ALB ratio suggested an increased risk of postoperative infection and the need for timely measures to prevent infection. This study innovatively demonstrates the synergistic value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CRP/ALB) in predicting postoperative spinal infections, addressing a critical evidence gap in biomarker applications for this field. Distinct from prior orthopedic research, this work is the first to systematically validate the superior predictive efficacy of postoperative CRP/ALB (AUC = 0.878, sensitivity 97.5%, specificity 80.7%) and NLR (AUC = 0.791) in a large-scale spinal surgery cohort ( n P However, this study also had the following limitations: i. it was a retrospective case study, which may have a selective bias of its own, in addition to the fact that it was not possible to radiologically screen all patients undergoing spinal surgery, which may have affected the results; ii. the sample for this study came from only one hospital database, which may have affected the generalisability of the results, and subsequent multi-centre, large-sample studies are still needed; iii. it was only internally validated, with the Lack of external datasets for further validation of the predictive ability of column line plots; iv. Future studies can explore the integration of Post-NLR and Post-CRP/ALB ratio indicators into a composite prediction model to further improve the discrimination ability; and v. In future clinical trials and cohort studies, gender must be analyzed as a key stratification or covariate to avoid masking true efficacy or risk or drawing biased conclusions due to the omission of gender factors. This will help obtain more reliable and generalizable results. 4 Conclusion The results of this study suggest that the risk factors for postoperative spinal infection are multifactorial, including (age, surgery time, blood transfusion, internal fixation, postoperative NLR and postoperative CRP/ALB ratio, which may serve as potential predictors of postoperative spinal infection.
