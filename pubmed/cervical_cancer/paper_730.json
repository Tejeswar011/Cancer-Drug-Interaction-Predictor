Introduction Preterm birth (<37 weeks gestational age), particularly spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB), remains the leading cause of neonatal mortality and long-term complications such as neurological deficits [ 1 2 3 4 5 However, the short time window between mid-pregnancy and preterm birth makes early intervention for cervical shortening particularly challenging in clinical practice. Currently, there are no reliable early methods for predicting short cervix in mid-pregnancy, which limits timely and effective preventive measures. While TVUS remains the gold standard for cervical length assessment, there is no consensus on which populations should be screened. Universal screening—though more effective in reducing sPTB than selective or opt-in approaches—imposes significant economic burdens [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 Therefore, it is essential, particularly for pregnant women with high-risk factors for sPTB, to develop a more cost-effective and simple approach for use in the early stages of pregnancy to predict short cervix in mid-pregnancy. This is also a crucial step in developing more effective prevention and treatment approaches. This type of approach can not only enable clinical doctors to take corresponding measures to prevent short cervix in mid-pregnancy as soon as possible but also provide the best balance for diagnostic cost-effectiveness. At present, machine learning (ML) algorithms have been widely implemented to detect diseases and predict outcomes [ 12 13 14 15 +0 +6 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Participants and Cervical Length Assessment From January 2020 to December 2020, 1480 women with singleton pregnancies were recruited from Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine. At enrollment (11 +0 +6 All participants underwent standardized cervical length measurement by TVUS at 20–24 gestational weeks. In this study, a short cervix was defined as a cervical length < 25 mm at this timepoint [ 16 The study plan was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine (approval number: KS22221). The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) singleton pregnant woman with at least one risk factor for sPTB (<37 weeks), such as a history of mid-pregnancy loss or preterm birth, a history of cervical surgery or electrocautery, a history of cervical cerclage, advanced age (defined as ≥35 years), or uterine malformation; (2) women who underwent regular prenatal follow-up and delivered at our hospital; and (3) Women who either had a normal cervical length at enrollment (based on TVUS in those with clinical indications for short cervix or preterm birth) or who did not undergo cervical length assessment at enrollment (due to the absence of these high-risk factors), and all underwent standardized TVUS monitoring of cervical length in mid-pregnancy (20–24 weeks). The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) delivery before 24 weeks of gestation or iatrogenic preterm birth; (2) twin gestation, fetal chromosomal abnormalities or severe malformations, or selective fetal reduction after 14 weeks of gestation; and (3) loss to follow-up. 2.2. Data Processing and Cohort Division Variables with missing values were examined prior to analysis. As the proportion of missing data was low (<5%), a complete case analysis was performed. This approach was chosen to preserve the integrity of the dataset without introducing imputation-related assumptions. We acknowledge that the exclusion of incomplete cases may introduce a degree of selection bias; however, given the low rate of missingness, the impact on model performance and generalizability is expected to be minimal. All included pregnant women were randomly divided into training and testing cohorts at a 7:3 ratio using base R. The sample() function was applied to randomly assign individuals to each group, and a fixed random seed (set.seed(1000)) was used to ensure reproducibility of the data split. The training set was used for model development, while the testing set was reserved for performance evaluation. 2.3. Multimodal Data for Predicting Short Cervix in Mid-Pregnancy The cervix was visualized in real time with an ultrasound probe placed in the vagina. Cervical length was measured as the distance between the internal os and the external os along the endocervical canal [ 17 16 18 Multimodal data collected during the first trimester (11 +0 +6 Table A1 19 20 Clinical variables included maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, gravidity, parity, history of second-trimester pregnancy loss, previous preterm birth, mode of conception, uterine malformations (diagnosed by transvaginal 3D ultrasound or MRI [ 21 22 23 Laboratory variables consisted of vaginal microbiological testing and peripheral blood inflammatory markers. Vaginal secretion samples were collected between 11 +0 +6 5 24 25 26 27 28 5 29 30 2.4. Predictive Variables Feature selection involved automatically removing unnecessary features and selecting a subset of features to be used in predictive modeling. Tree models (Boruta), regularization techniques (LASSO regression, elastic net), and naive Bayesian recursive feature elimination (RFE) are commonly employed methods for feature selection. The Boruta algorithm was a wrapper algorithm based on random forest classification. It was iterated over all variables to determine if they had a higher Z score than the shadow variables. Lasso analysis was performed using L1 regularization, and the coefficients of unimportant regression variables were set to zero. Elastic net regression was used to extend the generalized linear model by adding regularization with a mixed L1/L2 loss function [ 31 32 2.5. Derivation and Validation Data To reduce the impact of the data imbalance, we augmented the data by using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for Nominal and Continuous features (SMOTE-NC) in the training set. The SMOTE is a commonly used oversampling technique for dealing with imbalanced datasets [ 33 2.6. Model Development and Validation We employed seven popular ML algorithms: logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Among all the models, the LR and LDA models were parametric models, while the others were nonparametric ML models. We performed tenfold cross-validation to determine the best parameters for the parametric models, selected suitable hyperparameters for the nonparametric models in the training set, and ultimately applied them to the test set. In addition to the randomly divided test set mentioned above, we also validated the ML models by bootstrap resampling methods. All ML models were evaluated based on 1000 datasets generated by the stratified bootstrapping technique. The bootstrap samples were used as the training set, and the out-of-bag data were used as the test set. The performance of the predictive model was evaluated based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) in the test set. In addition, the accuracy, precision, F1 score, sensitivity (Recall), and specificity were computed to evaluate model performance. The calibrations of the models were evaluated by using calibration curves. Brier scores were used to calibrate the models. A lower Brier score indicated a greater degree of calibration. Furthermore, we employed decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess the possible clinical impacts of all our models. To further assess model generalizability, an independent dataset from the same institution but a different time period (January 2025) was used for validation. 2.7. Model Interpretation To interpret the model predictions, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values were used. According to game theory, SHAP scores correlate feature importance with Shapley values. The formula for calculating SHAP values was as follows: S h a p l e y  V a l u e = ∑ S ⊆  1 , . . . , n / i | S | ! ( n − | S | − 1 ) ! n ! f ( S ∪ i ) − f ( S ) In this formula, n is the total number of features, S is the subset of features, and is the function model [ 34 SHAP values were used to estimate the contribution of each feature to the predictive model and quantify the association of each variable with the outcome of a single person in the cohort. The procedure for building the model for predicting short cervix in mid-pregnancy is shown in Figure 1 2.8. Propensity Score Matching To evaluate the independent effect of short cervix in mid-pregnancy on adverse pregnancy outcomes, propensity score matching (PSM) was adopted to match subjects in the short cervix and normal cervix groups by decreasing potential confounding bias. The matching ratio was 1:1, and the caliper value was 0.05. 2.9. Statistical Analysis For continuous data, the Mann–Whitney U test was used for nonnormally distributed data, and Student’s t 2 https://www.r-project.org/ p 3. Results 3.1. Study Population Characteristics The study cohort comprised 1480 pregnant women at high risk of sPTB. A total of 376 women were diagnosed with a short cervix, defined as a cervical length of <25 mm measured by TVUS between 20 and 24 weeks of gestation, while 1104 had a normal cervical length. The pregnant women with a short cervical length had a mean age of 33.8 ± 3.37 years, and those with a normal cervical length had a mean age of 33.9 ± 3.42 years. Significant differences were observed between the short and normal cervical length groups in several clinical and laboratory parameters, including pre-pregnancy BMI, pregnancy history, mode of conception, cervical surgery history, vaginal infections, and WBC and neutrophil counts. Age and history of first-trimester pregnancy loss did not differ significantly between groups. The clinical features of the included population are shown in Table 1 3.2. Variable Screening The full dataset was randomly divided into two exclusive datasets, with 70% comprising the training set (N = 1033) and 30% comprising the test set (N = 447). Four different feature selection methods were applied to select optimal predictive variables for short cervix in mid-pregnancy. We first applied the Boruta algorithm to 21 original features from the general information, medical history and laboratory examination aspects ( Table A1 5 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 5 Figure 3 Table A1 Figure 3 3.3. Data Preprocessing In the training set, the proportion of women with short cervix in mid-pregnancy was significantly lower than that of healthy individuals (25.5% vs. 74.5%). In the testing set, there was a similar situation (25.3% vs. 74.7%). There was an important imbalance in the data described above ( Table A2 3.4. Construction and Assessment of ML Models We employed the four feature variables selected above to construct the prediction model. Seven machine learning models were constructed, including LR, LDA, KNN, SVM, DT, RF, and XGBoost models. Tenfold cross-validation was implemented on the training set to optimize the parameters. The optimal parameters or hyperparameters of all the models are presented in Table A3 The LR model was applied to examine the four factors selected above ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 5 Table 2 Figure 5 Table 2 3.5. Verification of the ML Models The models were validated using the testing set. In the testing set, the RF model had the highest AUC (0.992, 95% CI: 0.986–0.997), while the XGBoost model had the second highest AUC (0.987, 95% CI: 0.976–0.998) ( Figure A1 p Figure A1 Table A4 Figure A1 Table A5 Table A6 Additionally, we validated the model using an independent dataset collected in January 2025 from pregnant women during their registration at Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine. The dataset comprised 141 patients, with basic information provided in Table A7 Figure A2 3.6. Interpretability Analysis for the Optimal Model We use the SHAP method to evaluate the interpretability of the XGBoost model. The scatter plots show the SHAP value of each feature for each sample ( Figure 6 Figure 6 5 Figure 6 5 Figure 6 3.7. sPTB Rate in the Normal and Short Cervix Groups For pregnancy outcomes, in the group with a short cervix in mid-pregnancy, the sPTB (<37 weeks) rate was high at 41.2%, whereas the rate reached only 9.7% in the normal cervix group. Similarly, the sPTB rate (<34 weeks) was 31.6% in the short cervix group, while it was only 2.9% in the normal cervix group. The incidence of sPTB significantly differed between the two groups with different cervical lengths ( Table 1 Table A8 4. Discussion In this study, we aimed to address a clinically important challenge: the early identification of pregnant women at risk for a short cervix in mid-pregnancy, a key risk factor for sPTB. While TVUS at 20–24 weeks is the standard for detecting cervical shortening, it provides limited opportunity for early intervention. By leveraging routinely collected clinical and laboratory data from the first trimester (11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks), we applied and validated multiple ML models capable of predicting short cervix approximately six weeks in advance. This early prediction window holds substantial potential for improving pregnancy management by enabling timely preventive strategies, ultimately improving maternal and neonatal outcomes. Our study highlights the importance of four key factors—pre-pregnancy BMI, history of second-trimester pregnancy loss, WBC, and positive vaginal microbiological culture (VMC ≥ 10 5 35 36 37 These factors were then used as input variables to apply seven different ML models. One of the key findings of our study was the relationship between pre-pregnancy BMI and short cervix. The relationship between pre-pregnancy BMI and short cervix remains controversial. Kaline Gomes Ferrari Marquart et al. [ 38 39 40 In addition to BMI, WBC was found to be an important predictor of short cervix, which is consistent with earlier research linking systemic inflammation to cervical remodeling. By studying serum markers, Simhan HN et al. showed that a shortened cervical length in mid-pregnancy may be associated with systemic inflammation [ 5 41 Another novel aspect of our study is the identification of positive vaginal microbiological culture ≥10 5 42 Furthermore, in our study, a history of mid-pregnancy loss was a strong predictor of a short cervix in mid-pregnancy. This was consistent with the findings of an earlier study [ 38 20 43 To establish the best performing model, we developed and compared several machine learning algorithms based on their predictive power using the selected input variables. The KNN, RF, and XGBoost models achieved high AUCs in the training set, but the differences were not statistically significant. However, the XGBoost model had a better calibration curve and DCA performance. It also had the best accuracy (0.849) and F1 score (0.848), and relatively high Recall (0.838). Therefore, the XGBoost model was the best ML model for the prediction of short cervix in mid-pregnancy among all seven ML models. Although the XGBoost (value = 0.987) model had the second highest AUC value and the RF model (value = 0.992) had the highest AUC value in the test set, these values were not significantly different. The high AUC observed in the test set can be attributed to the fact that we used SMOTE-NC to balance the training set, while the test set, reflecting a real-world distribution, was imbalanced. The test set contained a higher proportion of negative cases, which made the model more likely to predict the majority class (negative) accurately, resulting in higher specificity. In imbalanced datasets, even a model that predicts mostly the negative class can achieve high specificity, which may inflate the AUC. Therefore, while the AUC is high, it should be interpreted with caution, as it primarily reflects the model’s ability to predict the majority class, rather than its performance across all categories. The RF model, though achieving a high AUC, was significantly less sensitive than the XGBoost model, particularly due to its lower Recall, making it less suitable for predictive modeling in this context. The XGBoost model also performed the best according to bootstrap validation. Thus, we believe that the XGBoost model has better clinical applicability and is more effective in predicting short cervix in mid-pregnancy. To further assess the robustness and generalizability of the XGBoost model, we performed an additional validation using an independent dataset from our hospital, collected in January 2025. This validation supports the model’s reliability and potential applicability in clinical settings. In the SHAP plot of the XGBoost model, we explained the feature contribution based on the SHAP value. These findings indicated that positive SHAP values were associated with a greater probability of short cervix in mid-pregnancy, while negative SHAP values were associated with a lower probability of short cervix in mid-pregnancy. In this research, pre-pregnancy BMI (0.889) was the most significant predictor, and the second most important predictor was the WBC (0.827). According to the available literature, a high pre-pregnancy BMI and an increased WBC in first trimester are also important risk factors for sPTB [ 29 44 45 Nevertheless, we acknowledge several limitations that cannot be ignored. First, we classified cervical length as a binary variable (<25 mm vs. ≥25 mm) during the 20–24-week gestational period, which may have oversimplified the complex relationship between cervical shortening and the risk of sPTB. This simplification may have missed finer distinctions in risk, and we plan to refine this approach in future studies. Additionally, our study only assessed cervical length at a single timepoint (20–24 weeks), which may limit our ability to capture cases where cervical shortening occurs progressively. Multiple follow-up assessments would improve our ability to track changes over time. Furthermore, while we used an independent updated dataset for external validation, the absence of an external cohort from different hospitals or countries may limit the generalizability of our model. Our study was conducted at a single center with a predominantly Chinese population, which may not fully reflect the risk profiles of other ethnic groups. Moreover, our study population consisted of women with at least one risk factor for preterm birth, meaning it does not represent a low-risk population. Therefore, the findings may not be applicable to women at lower risk for preterm birth. Future multi-center, international studies are needed to validate the model across diverse populations. Future multi-center, international studies are needed to validate the model across diverse populations. Finally, while our model demonstrates promising predictive capabilities, it does not yet provide a specific clinical threshold for interventions. Determining such thresholds would require further investigation, integrating clinical decision-making criteria and expert consensus. Future research will aim to refine our model and explore the potential for actionable clinical guidelines that can inform timely interventions in at-risk pregnancies. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study applied machine learning methods to predict the risk of short cervix in mid-pregnancy using first-trimester clinical data. Four key predictive factors for short mid-trimester cervical length included pre-pregnancy BMI, WBC, prior second-trimester pregnancy loss, and positive vaginal microbiological culture results (VMC ≥ 10 5 Acknowledgments We would like to thank all participants for collecting the data for this study.
