Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were analysed in PAAD to develop personalised therapeutic strategies.

The study selected nine TLS‐related genes and analysed the TLS status in patients with PAAD. High TLS scores were linked to better survival, enhanced immune cell infiltration and increased chemosensitivity.

The 5‐year survival rate is only 11.5% (from SEER database, 2014–2020). PAAD has an insidious onset; additionaly, the cancer cells proliferate rapidly to facilitate disease progression, and distal metastasis can occur at an early stage of tumour development [ 1 2 PAAD is characterised by a ‘cold’ tumour microenvironment (TME) and hard to benefit from immunotherapy [ 3 4 5 5 6 Tumour mutational burden (TMB) predicts the efficacy of immunotherapy in PDAC. TMB‐high cases (≥ 10 mut/Mb) displayed prolonged survival and strong anti‐tumour immune responses fuelled by T helper cell/DC‐mediated priming of the cytotoxic T cells [ 7 TP53 KRAS CDKN2A SMAD4 8 9 The nine TLS‐related genes ( CCR6 CD1d CD79B CETP EIF1AY LAT PTGDS RBP5 SKAP1 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Here, we extracted data from study [ 11 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Data Acquisition Transcriptome data of 182 PAAD samples sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and normalised by log2(FPKM+1) were obtained from the University Of Cingifornia Sisha Cruz (UCSC) Xena ( https://xenabrowser.net 1 FIGURE 1 Flowchart of this study. 2.2 TLS Scores Assessment and Correlation With Clinical Characteristics The limma package ( https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GSVA.html 18 Next, all samples were divided into high and low TLS levels groups (TLS_H and TLS_L group) according to the median TLS score. The overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were assessed by the Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival curve in the survival package Version2.41–1 ( http://bioconductor.org/packages/survivalr/ 19 19 2.3 The Correlation Between TLS Status and Tumour Immune Microenvironment GSVA package (Version 1.36.3) in R software, based on the single‐sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm was used to assess the proportion of individual immune cells for each sample included in the analysis [ 20 MUC MUC ENO PVRIG BTLA C10orf54 CD274 CD276 CTLA4 HAVCR2 LAG3 PDCD1 PDCD1LG2 TIGIT 2.4 Acquisition of Nine TLS Related Genes in Single Cell Data of PDAC Single‐cell RNA‐seq data analysis was performed following the methodology described in Mo et al.

The significantly enriched KEGG pathways were screened by combining three key statistical values: enrichment score, normalised enrichment score (NES) and p 2.8 Predictive Effect of Externally Validated TLS Features on PAAD Patients The pancreatic cancer‐related expression dataset GSE79668 25 26 GPL11154 Homo sapiens TLS scores were calculated in the GSE79668 2.9 Statistical Analysis Pearson correlation was used to assess the relationship between two normally distributed variables.

MYC pathway activation drives resistance to mTOR inhibitors such as AZD8055 in breast cancer [ 56 57 58 59 60 8 S2 61 KRAS 17 KRAS S1  LAT 9 LAT 62 LAT 63 LAT 63 3 The current study relies on bulk RNA‐seq with GSVA to assess TLS status and the Scrublet algorithm for single‐cell clustering of the nine TLS‐related genes, approaches that have inherent limitations. The bulk RNA‐seq method may obscure cell‐type specific expression patterns, while single‐modal analysis lacks integration of multi‐omic datasets. This limitation hinders the full characterisation of TLS formation mechanisms across diverse biological contexts. Advanced algorithms such as scCross and the Dynamic Hypergraph Hyperbolic Neural Network (DHHNN) could uncover fine‐grained cellular heterogeneity and gene regulatory networks [ 64 65 66 67 5 Conclusion In summary, our findings reveal that a high TLS score, derived from nine TLS‐related genes ( CCR6 CD1d CD79B CETP EIF1AY LAT PTGDS RBP5 SKAP1 Author Contributions  Mengzhou Gao: Guohui Li: Xin Wang: Xueyun Wang: Danning Tang: Xiang Ao: An Luo: Zhenguo Wen: Teng Wang: Zhaojun Jia: Ethics Statement The authors have nothing to report.
