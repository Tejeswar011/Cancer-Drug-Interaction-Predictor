This study aims to elucidate the mechanistic basis by which the propionate pathway influences LUAD progression at the genetic level. Methods The TCGA-LUAD cohort was retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and LUAD-related datasets ( GSE13213 GSE72079 Results A total of 166 DE-PMRGs were identified by intersecting 4,403 DEGs with 531 PMRGs. A risk model was constructed using five characteristic genes (LDHA, KYNU, SLC2A1, CFTR, MAOB) via univariate Cox and LASSO analyses. GSVA revealed 18 activated pathways in the high-risk group (e.g., heme metabolism, P53 signaling), versus 14 pathways in the low-risk group (e.g., E2F targets, mTORC1 signaling). Significant differences were observed in 14 immune cell types (e.g., eosinophils, neutrophils) and 4 immune checkpoints (PDCD1LG2, CD274, CD27, IDO1) between risk groups. LDHA, KYNU, and SLC2A1 were significantly positively correlated with activated CD4 + T cells, γδ T cells, and memory B cells, while CFTR and MAOB were associated with 9 immune cell types (e.g., activated B cells, eosinophils). Eight chemotherapeutic agents were identified to correlate with risk scores via drug sensitivity analysis. Conclusion This study identifies five propionate metabolism-related genes (LDHA, KYNU, SLC2A1, CFTR, MAOB) that may influence LUAD prognosis, providing a scientific foundation for further mechanistic investigations and potential clinical applications.

According to the American Cancer Society, there were approximately 228,150 new lung cancer cases and over 142,000 deaths in the United States in 2019 [ 1 1 2 1 3 It has been reported that propionic acid upregulates the surface expression of the immunostimulatory NKG2D ligand MICA/B by applying metabolic changes in colon dividing cells, thereby possessing the potential as an immunoactivated anticancer therapy [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Therefore, this study focuses on propionate metabolism-related genes for the first time. Based on TCGA and GEO databases, it combines machine learning algorithms. The study identifies propionate metabolism-related genes (PMRGs) associated with LUAD patient survival. These genes provide potential targets for clinical diagnosis, patient prognosis, and treatment. They also lay a theoretical foundation for in-depth understanding of LUAD mechanisms. Materials and methods Data sources The TCGA-LUAD cohort (518 LUAD and 59 normal samples) was downloaded from TCGA ( https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov GSE13213 n GSE72079 n https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ http://www.genecards.org Identifying and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed PMRGs (DE-PMRGs) Firstly, we calculated the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LUAD group and the normal group via “DESeq2” R package in the R language ( adj.p 2 14 adj.p 15 Creation of the risk model In the TCGA-LUAD dataset, 513 patients’ DE-PMRGs expression data (FPKM) were used to randomly divide them into an internal training set (360 cases) and an internal validation set (153 cases) in a 7:3 ratio. To identify genes significantly associated with patient survival, we performed Univariate Cox regression analysis using the ‘survival’ package (version 3.1–12). In the training set, univariate Cox proportional hazards regression was applied, with the expression levels of differential propionate metabolism-related genes treated as continuous variables to compare against survival time. Genes were selected based on a p-value < 0.05. Based on the genes selected through univariate Cox analysis, the LASSO algorithm was used to select model genes in the training set, with the parameter family set to binomial and type.measure set to class, to perform LASSO logistic regression. Strongly correlated features were selected, and characteristic genes were screened based on the value of lambda.min. The risk scores were calculated based on those genes following the formula: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:risk\\:score=\\sum\\:_{n=1}^{n}\\left(coefi*Xi\\right)$$\\end{document} GSE13213 GSE72079 Creation of a nomogram Independent prognostic factors were identified via univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses combining risk scores and clinical features. A nomogram for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival was constructed using the “rms” package (version 6.1-0), with reliability evaluated via calibration curves and ROC analyses. Correlation analysis of clinical characteristics To assess the relevance between clinical characteristics and risk scores, we analyzed the differences of risk score were between the groups divided based on clinical characteristics. The clinical characteristics includes age (≤ 55/>55), gender (female / male), OS status (living/deceased), stage (Ⅰ/Ⅱ/Ⅲ/Ⅳ), pathologic-T stage (T1/T2/T3/T4), TMB (high TMB/ low TMB), pathologic-M stage (M0/M1), pathologic-N stage (N0/N1/N2/N3), smoking (no smoking/smoking), and radiation therapy (No/Yes). To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of different clinical characteristics on risk scores, we performed stratified analyses to assess the heterogeneity of this relationship in different subgroups (e.g., age, sex, pathologic stage, etc.). Moreover, to explore the relevance between the clinical characteristics and survival rate of LUAD patients, K-M curves were plotted. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) GSVA enrichment analysis can retain key information without specifying explicit differential gene thresholds, and thus find sets of functional genes that are not very different but have a consistent trend of gene differences without screening for differences. To find common functions of genes and associated pathways within a collection of genes, the 50 marker gene sets were gained through the MSigDB as reference gene sets. The GSVA scores for all enriched pathways in the two risk groups were calculated via “GSVA” R package (version 3.0.3) [ 16 17 Immune analysis With the Single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) algorithm, we can obtain the immune cell types, immune functions, and immune pathway activities for each sample, and then group the samples based on immune activity. ssGSEA calculates the rank value of each gene based on the expression profile file, followed by subsequent statistical analysis. The immune-related gene sets used in this analysis include not only immune cell types but also immune-related pathways and functions, and these gene sets are very comprehensive. By using these immune-related gene sets for analysis, we can accurately determine the immune activity of each sample. Text in R language was used to compare the differences in immune scores between two risk groups. Then the relevance of differential immune cells with each other, and the relevance between characteristic genes and differential immune cells were evaluated via the Spearman ( P 18 Drug sensitivity analysis To assessing the sensitivity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents in the two risk groups, the IC50 of chemotherapy drugs was calculated high and low risk groups via the “pRRophetic” R package (version 0.5) [ 18 p Statistical analysis In this study, The R software was used to perform statistical analysis. The Wilcox test used to analyze discrepancy between groups. The P Results Acquisition and enrichment analysis of DE-PMRGs A total of 4,403 DEGs were identified between LUAD and normal tissues (Fig. 1 S1 1 S2 1 1  Fig. 1 Screening and enrichment analysis of differential propionate metabolism-related genes.

P Bootstrap analysis The BCa method using the boot function of R language was applied to analyze the TCGA-LUAD cohort studied in this paper. It was found that the gender confidence interval of the sample was (-0.0829,0.0789) (Fig. 9 9 9 9 9  Fig. 9 The confidence interval of gender, age, T stage, N stage and M sage. (A) The confidence intervals for gender are (-0.0829,0.0789). (B) age are (-0.0067,0.0016). (C) T stage are (-0.1049,0.143). (D) N stage are (-0.0863,0.0276). (E) M stage are (-0.0324,0.1667) Discussion The high mortality rate of LUAD underscores the need for improved prognostic tools and therapeutic targets. While previous studies have explored single genes (e.g., ALDH2 [ 19 13 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 P 30 P 31 32 11 33 36 49 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 Establish a nomogram prediction model based on these 5 genes and stages, and divide the training group patients into high-risk and low-risk groups according to risk scores. It was found that there was a significant difference in survival rates between the two, and validation was conducted in the validation group, both of which proved the effectiveness of the risk model. Then we conducted a stratified analysis to evaluate the predictive model’s ability in predicting overall survival rates for different subgroups of patients. We found that for patients with TMB-L and over 55 years old, risk scores can predict the overall survival of patients within 5 years, and there is a significant difference between the high and low risk groups. For smoking and T1-2 patients, OS within 5 years can also be well predicted, but it is not significant. For patients with T3-4, N1-3, and M1, it can also be predicted well, but it is not significant. For patients with TMB-H and M0, the OS after 3 years can be well distinguished, but it is not significant. For non-smoking patients, OS within 4 years can be predicted well, but it is not significant. Previous literature has also conducted stratified survival analysis on the clinical predictive ability of the model, and Al Dherasi’s 7-gene model can effectively predict the prognosis of different ages, genders, and stages [ 43 44 45 According to GSVA enrichment analysis, P53 pathways, heme metabolism, apical junction, and KRAS signaling pathways, WNT signaling are activated in high-risk groups. These signaling pathways typically involve DNA damage, oxidative stress, activation of proto-oncogenes, vascular growth, and invasion, all of which are related to tumor progression. According to reports, regulating the WNT pathway can reduce the resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells to osimertinib [ 46 47 48 The immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in the occurrence, development, and prognosis of lung cancer. Through immune microenvironment analysis, this study found significant differences in immune cell composition and immune checkpoint expression between the high and low-risk groups, including activated CD4 + T cells, central memory CD4 + T cells, eosinophils, etc [ 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 Finally, we also predicted the differences in the therapeutic effects of chemotherapy drugs between the two groups, indicating significant differences in the efficacy of immunotherapy and chemotherapy among different groups, leading to different prognoses. In summary, the five genes identified all play important roles in the occurrence, development, treatment, and prediction of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). By combining these five genes to calculate a risk score and using a Nomogram predictive model, the 1-year/3-year/5-year survival rates of patients can be estimated. Patients with poor prognosis are recommended to initiate combined therapies as early as possible, while those with favorable prognosis can choose milder treatment approaches. This helps clinicians provide personalized treatment recommendations and improves patients’ quality of life. Current clinical prognosis for patients relies mainly on tumor staging and tumor burden, lacking an accurate predictive method. The findings of this study may provide a feasible approach for predicting LUAD prognosis. For patients and families with limited economic conditions, survival rate prediction can help evaluate therapeutic benefits, formulate consumption plans, and assist in deciding whether to continue treatment, avoiding unnecessary family economic burdens. However, this study has limitations. First, the TCGA and GEO databases used have relatively limited sample sizes, and the lack of external validation with large independent cohorts may affect the robustness and generalizability of the prognostic model. Additionally, the specific molecular mechanisms of propionic acid metabolism in LUAD—especially in tumor growth and immune escape—remain underexplored. Therefore, future research plans include incorporating more clinical datasets to enhance the model’s robustness and generalizability. We also plan to validate related genes’ expression levels through experimental methods (e.g., qRT-PCR, Western blot, animal models, and cell models) and explore their functional roles and underlying mechanisms in LUAD. This will deepen our understanding of the propionic acid metabolic pathway in LUAD and provide more theoretical basis for clinical treatment. Conclusion This study constructed a prognostic model for LUAD based on propionate metabolism-related genes, successfully identifying five characteristic genes (LDHA, KYNU, SLC2A1, CFTR, MAOB) and demonstrating the model’s good performance in predictive ability. The model provides an effective prognostic assessment tool for clinical practice, helping doctors identify high-risk patients to achieve early intervention and closer monitoring. Additionally, the five characteristic genes may offer new potential therapeutic targets for lung adenocarcinoma. Future research can deeply explore the mechanisms of these genes in the occurrence and development of lung adenocarcinoma, as well as their potential as drug targets, opening up new directions for precision medicine.
