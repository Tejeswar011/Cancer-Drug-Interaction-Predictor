Objective Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that targets epithelial tissues. Virtually all cases of cervical cancer are related to HPV, emphasizing the importance of vaccines in prevention. Although >200 million doses have been administered worldwide, concerns persist about adverse reactions. This study evaluated the safety of the HPV vaccine and the main adverse effects. Data sources The study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42023365692). The systematic searches were conducted in the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases using the search strategy \"HPV\" AND \"vaccine\" AND \"safety\" NOT \"COVID\" from 01/01/2007 to 31/12/2022. Inclusion criteria were based on the PICOT strategy, focusing on studies with humans, vaccinated populations comprising children, adolescents, and adults, and Phase II/III randomized clinical trials. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of the studies. Summary of findings Eleven articles were qualified for qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis. The results indicated that HPV vaccination was associated with increased local reactions, fatigue, and myalgia compared to the placebo. However, there were no significant differences in serious adverse events, gastrointestinal reactions, cutaneous effects, headache, or fever between the vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusion Local reactions, fatigue, and myalgia were more prevalent in the HPV vaccine group; the overall safety profile of the vaccine was favorable. The HPV vaccine was deemed safe, mirroring the profile of adverse reactions seen with other vaccines. With its potential to prevent cancer, the benefits of HPV vaccination far outweigh the minimal risks.

These viruses have a high specificity for tissues and infect both cutaneous and mucosal epithelium. At least 14 of them pose a high risk of causing cancer. HPV types 16 and 18 are responsible for most cancer cases, contributing to approximately 70 % of cervical cancers and precancerous cervical lesions. 1 2 Several factors, such as prolonged use of oral contraceptives, multiple pregnancies, smoking, a compromised immune system, and co-infection with other sexually transmitted diseases, in addition to the specific type of HPV (high-risk), can increase the chance of developing precancerous cervical cells. 2 3 4 5 Six prophylactic HPV vaccines have been licensed, all based on the L1 major capsid antigen, which self-assembles into virus-like particles. Three bivalent vaccines protect against the oncogenic types HPV-16 and HPV-18: Cervarix® (GSK), Cecolin® (Innovax), and Walrinvax® (Walvax/Zerun). Two quadrivalent vaccines protect against the low-risk types HPV-6 and HPV-11, in addition to the high-risk types HPV-16 and HPV-18: Gardasil® (MSD) and Cervavac® (Serum Institute of India). The nonavalent vaccine Gardasil 9® (MSD) protects against infections caused by HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and five additional high-risk types: 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. 6 7 8 So far, >200 million doses of preventive HPV vaccines have been administered globally. 9 10 11 12 Given the importance of HPV vaccination in preventing infection and cancer occurrence, this study aimed to evaluate through a systematic review and meta-analysis \"How safe are HPV vaccines and what are the main adverse reactions for healthy individuals?\" Methodology Search strategy The study was conducted according to the recommendations of the PRISMA guideline. The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42023365692). The systematic search was implemented in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, and Web of Science. The search strategy “HPV” AND “vaccine” AND “safety” NOT “COVID”. Two researchers (MYS, PHGB) independently selected the articles, and conflicts were discussed with a third author (SAS). Eligibility criteria The inclusion criteria were based on the research question: \"How safe are HPV vaccines and what are the main adverse effects?\" To establish such criteria, the PICOT strategy (Population, Intervention, Control, Outcome, Type of Study) was used. The studied population consisted of healthy individuals. The intervention was HPV vaccination. Comparison was made with individuals who received a placebo, and the primary outcome was to analyze the safety and major adverse reactions post-vaccination. For the type of study, the authors considered Phase II/III Randomized Clinical Trials. Eligibility criteria were a) Articles published in English; b) Articles involving human subjects; c) Vaccinated population consisting of children, adolescents, and adults; d) Abstracts available in selected databases; e) Articles relating to the vaccine and HPV; f) Vaccine safety; g) adverse effects of HPV vaccine; h) Healthy individuals and non-pregnant women; i) Phase II/III randomized clinical trials; j) Articles between 2007 and 2022. Articles that did not match the eligibility criteria were excluded from the selection. Data extraction and qualitative synthesis Three independent authors (PHGB, MS, and RJ) extracted information from each article and presented it in a spreadsheet containing title, DOI, access link, authors, year, journal, country, study type, participants, study demographics: number of participants, age range; study characteristics: type of control, primary outcome, a secondary outcome, and follow-up time; vaccine data: HPV vaccine type, number of doses, the interval between doses, days after vaccination for symptoms, local reactions, injection site pain, swelling at the injection site, redness at the injection site, stiffness, sweating, malaise, fatigue, fever, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, urticaria, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, dizziness, genitourinary tract symptoms, the onset of chronic diseases, the onset of autoimmune diseases, vaccine-related systemic effect, serious adverse event, death. Quality of the studies To evaluate the quality of the studies, the PEDro scale (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) was used. The instrument was applied in the articles selected for meta-analysis and consists of 11 items. Each article receives a score according to the PEDro Quality Scale, ranging from 0 to 10, one point for each criterion, except for the first, since it concerns the external validity of the study, not entering the actual score. Thus, the more points an article has, the lower the risk of it containing biases: from 0 to 4 points is considered a low-quality article; 5 and 6, intermediate; and from 7 to 10, high quality. 13 Meta-analysis The authors performed the meta-analysis using vaccine-related adverse events (local reaction, fever, headache, fatigue, cutaneous symptoms, myalgia, and gastrointestinal symptoms) as dichotomous variables, which were analyzed by the Mantel-Haenszel method, and a random-effects model was applied. Results from random-effects models were reported as relative risks (RR) with 95 % CI. Heterogeneity was assessed by the I-square (I 2 14 Funnel plots were also employed to evaluate potential study bias, and subgroup analysis was performed using HPV vaccine valence (bivalent or quadrivalent) as a grouping variable. The statistical significance level was set at p Results A total of 4904 articles were selected from different databases: 405 articles from Cochrane Library, 1076 from Embase, 804 from PubMed, 264 from Science Direct, 1237 from Scopus, and 1118 from Web of Science. Subsequently, 2888 duplicate articles were excluded. The remaining 2016 documents were screened based on their titles and abstracts. Based on the eligibility criteria, 181 articles were selected for full-text assessment. In the end, 11 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis ( Figure. 1 Figure. 1 Prisma Flowchart demonstrating the article selection steps. Figure 1 In the present study, 11 articles published between 2007 and 2019 met the eligibility criteria. Of the 11 articles, four have their country of origin in China, while the remainder are from countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America ( Table 1 Table 1 Characteristics of the selected studies. Table 1 Reference Country Participants characteristics Sex/Age a n Vaccine/ Number of doses/ Application range b Results Chen et al. 15 China Females Quadrivalent Gardasil Four participants (two in the qHPV vaccine and two in the placebo) discontinued the study vaccination due to adverse effects (AEs) that were considered vaccination-related. Within 15 days following any vaccination, injection-site AEs were more frequent among qHPV vaccine recipients, and systemic AEs were similar in frequency between the qHPV vaccine and placebo groups. Kim et al. 37 South Korea Females Bivalent Cervarix Local (pain) and general (fatigue, myalgia, or headache) symptoms were commonly reported in both groups. Li et al. 19 China Males Quadrivalent Gardasil The qHPV vaccine was generally well tolerated. Injection site AEs were higher in vaccine than placebo recipients. Vaccine-related systemic AEs were reported with similar frequency in vaccine and placebo recipients. There was one serious AE among placebo recipients that was determined by the investigator to be not related to vaccination. Mikamo et al. 11 Japan Males Quadrivalent Gardasil Vaccination-related AEs were slightly higher in the qHPV vaccine than in the placebo group. The most common reactions were mild to moderate injection site pain, erythema, and swelling. Moreira et al. 16 Australia Canada Colombia Denmark Hong Kong Mexico Sweden United States Females Nonavalent Gardasil The most common AEs were injection-site events, the majority of which were mild. Overall, the 9vHPV vaccine was generally well tolerated in prior qHPV vaccine recipients. Mugo et al. 21 Ghana Kenya Senegal Females Quadrivalent Gardasil Across vaccination groups, the most common AEs were at the injection site, including pain, swelling, and erythema. No subject discontinued study medication due to an AE and no serious AEs were reported. There were no deaths. This study demonstrated that qHPV vaccination of Sub-Saharan African women was highly immunogenic and generally well tolerated. Muñoz et al. 38 Colombia France Germany Philippines Spain Females Quadrivalent Gardasil The proportion of women who reported a serious AE on days 1–15 after any vaccination was comparable between the vaccine and placebo groups. Injection-site AEs were mainly responsible for the slight increase in AEs recorded in the vaccine group. There were no vaccine-related serious AEs recorded. Reisinger et al. 22 North and Latin America Europe Asia Males and Females Quadrivalent Gardasil A higher proportion of vaccine recipients than placebo recipients reported one or more injection-site AEs following any vaccination. Rates of fever were similar between vaccination groups. No serious vaccine-related adverse experiences were reported. Sow et al. 18 Sub-Saharan Africa Females Bivalent Cervarix Injection site pain was the most frequent local symptom in both groups. Local reactions were higher among the vaccine group. The most frequently observed general symptoms in both groups were headache and fever. No participant withdrew owing to AEs. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported. Zhu et al. 17 China Females Bivalent Cervarix Symptoms were generally mild, self-limiting, and of short duration. Injection site symptoms (pain, redness, and swelling) were reported in a numerically higher percentage of subjects in the vaccine group than in the control group. One serious adverse effect (gastrointestinal tract infection) was assessed by the investigator as possibly related to vaccination. Safety outcomes between groups were generally similar. Zhu et al. 20 China Females Bivalent Cervarix The 2vHPV had an acceptable safety profile when administered to healthy Chinese females. The incidence of solicited local symptoms following any dose was generally higher in the vaccine group than in the control group. None of the serious AEs was considered to have a causal relationship to vaccination by the investigator, and no event had a fatal outcome.

Regarding gender, nine articles used groups composed solely of women, while two used groups with both men and women. None of the articles were similar in terms of age range, but the youngest age evaluated was 9 years old and the oldest was 45 ( Table 1 Among the 11 articles, four used the bivalent Cervarix vaccine, six used the quadrivalent-HPV Gardasil, and only one utilized the nonavalent-HPV Gardasil vaccine. Unanimously, all articles administered vaccination in three doses. Following the three doses, their intervals were distributed as follows: four articles with an interval of 0–1–6 months; six articles with an interval of 0–2–6 months, and only one with an interval of 1–2–6 months ( Table 1 Meta-analysis Local reaction The injection-site events related to the HPV vaccine were local pain, swelling, and redness. The meta-analysis showed that patients vaccinated with the HPV vaccines have a greater chance of developing local reactions when all vaccine valences are grouped (1.48 [CI: 1.30,1.69]; p 2 Figure. 2 p 2 Figure. 2 p 2 Figure. 2 Figure. 2 Forest plot of the risk ratio for a local reaction after HPV vaccination.

Figure 8 Serious adverse reactions vaccine-related Only three trials reported serious adverse events (SAE) deemed related to vaccination, which precluded the performance of a meta-analysis for this outcome. Chen et al. 15 16 17 Other adverse reactions Moreover, the studies described other adverse events. Sow et al. 18 19 18 20 18 Quality assessment Overall, all studies were considered excellent on the PEDro scale (9–10 score). Nine of the eleven clinical trials satisfied all the PEDro scale criteria. Since Mugo et al. 21 22 Discussion Vaccine hesitancy, according to the World Health Organization's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Vaccine Hesitancy (SAGE-WG), is the delay in accepting or refusing vaccination, despite the availability of vaccination services. This phenomenon, which is multifactorial and difficult to resolve, was identified by the World Health Organization in 2019 as one of the ten main threats to public health. 23 24 A cross-sectional analysis of the National Immunization Survey, conducted between 2015 and 2018, revealed a 79.9 % increase in the proportion of parents who refused vaccination against Human Papillomavirus (HPV) for their adolescent children, due to concerns about the safety of the vaccine. 25 All the trials selected for this study compared HPV vaccines (bivalent, quadrivalent, and nonavalent) to a placebo group. The outcomes most observed in the trials were local reactions, fatigue, myalgia, headache, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, mucocutaneous alterations, and serious adverse effects. Fatigue and myalgia are more frequent after the HPV vaccination than after the placebo injection. The most common reactions are local site symptoms such as redness, swelling, and pain. Local site reactions were also more frequently observed in those who received HPV vaccines when compared with placebo subjects. There was no significant difference between the HPV vaccine and placebo for the other outcomes evaluated. The meta-analysis pointed out that people from the HPV vaccine group were more likely to have fatigue when compared to the placebo group (RR 1.21 [95 % CI: 1.11, 1.32]; p 14 7 p 26 p When it comes to vaccines against other viruses, fatigue is also more prevalent in the vaccine groups than in the placebo groups. For the COVID-19 vaccine, Sutton et al. 27 p It was observed that myalgia was also more frequent in patients who received the HPV vaccine than in patients who received a placebo. The studies analyzed for this symptom presented low heterogeneity (I² = 19 %). Gonçalves et al. 12 p 28 29 This meta-analysis demonstrated that the HPV vaccine group had a greater chance of having local reactions than the placebo group. When separated by valence, the results remained consistent for bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines. Likewise, Huang et al. 30 For serious adverse events, this study analyzed three trials, which found that these events were rare. Lu et al. 31 In a document from the Vaccine Safety Net - a global network of websites organized by the WHO 32 Another vaccine commonly used for children is the triple viral vaccine against rubella, measles, and mumps. In a retrospective cohort study, Rowhani-Rahbar et al. 33 p Regarding headache, there was no significant difference between the patients vaccinated against HPV and those who received a placebo. Moreover, Sangar et al. 34 Likewise, the placebo group and the HPV vaccine group had similar risk of developing fever (RR 1.06 [95 % CI: 0.96, 1.16]; p 35 1 , 3 p 36 p Regarding effects on the gastrointestinal tract (RR 1.13 [0.86, 1.49], with p 12 p 28 p p For cutaneous reactions (RR 1.33 [95 % CI: 0.63, 2.83], p 28 p Despite analyzing the study quality using the PEDro tool, to exclude articles with a high risk of bias, great heterogeneity was still obtained in most of the analyses of adverse reactions, especially when vaccines were analyzed separately. Furthermore, few studies were found comparing the 9vHPV vaccine with placebo, making it difficult to analyze the adverse reactions of this vaccine. Conclusion In summary, fatigue and myalgia were more commonly observed in the HPV vaccine group than in the placebo group. Furthermore, patients vaccinated against HPV were more susceptible to developing local reactions when compared to those who received a placebo. There was no significant difference between the HPV vaccine and placebo for the following outcomes: serious adverse effects, gastrointestinal reactions, cutaneous effects, headache, and fever. The HPV vaccine was considered safe in most outcomes, demonstrating a profile of adverse reactions like other vaccines. Since the HPV vaccine prevents some types of cancer, the benefit of applying the vaccine is far greater than the risk. Conflicts of interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
