The FASEB Journal https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This is an open access article under the terms of the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ ABSTRACT Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly invasive and metastatic malignancy. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), including hsa_circRNA_0101125, have been implicated in regulating cancer metastasis. But its potential roles in ESCC remain underexplored, particularly in relation to miR‐143‐3p. This study aimed to investigate the role of hsa_circRNA_0101125/miR‐143‐3p in the occurrence and development of ESCC. KYSE150 and ECA109 cells were used as in vitro models to evaluate the biological effects of hsa_circRNA_0101125. The interaction between ZNF148 and miR‐143‐3p was confirmed by dual‐luciferase assay. To assess the functional role of this pathway, cells were transfected with sh‐hsa_circRNA_0101125 vectors and/or miR‐143‐3p inhibitors, followed by assays for cell viability (CCK‐8), migration (wound healing assay), and invasion (Transwell assay). Transcriptions and expressions of hsa_circRNA_0101125, miR‐143‐3p, and ZNF148 were measured by RT‐qPCR and western blot. Results showed that hsa_circRNA_0101125 was localized in the cytoplasm and negatively regulated miR‐143‐3p, which targeted ZNF148. Inhibition of hsa_circRNA_0101125 significantly reduced cell viability, migration, and invasion, downregulated ZNF148 and Vimentin, and upregulated miR‐143‐3p and E‐cadherin expressions. In contrast, downregulating miR‐143‐3p abolished these effects. Therefore, hsa_circRNA_0101125 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of ESCC cells by inhibiting the expression of miR‐143‐3p. hsa_circRNA_0101125 promotes esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression by sponging miR‐143‐3p and upregulating ZNF148 expression. This regulatory axis enhances tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, likely by modulating EMT‐related markers including E‐cadherin and Vimentin. Inhibiting hsa_circRNA_0101125/miR‐143‐3p/ZNF148 might ameliorate esophageal squamous cell carcinoma progression. The hsa_circRNA_0101125/miR‐143‐3p/ZNF148 axis may serve as a potential therapeutic target in ESCC. epithelial‐mesenchymal transition esophageal cancer hsa_circRNA_0101125 miR‐143‐3p ZNF148 Joint Funds for innovation of Science and Technology, Fujian Provionce 2020Y9100 Fujian Provincial Natural Science Foudation of China 2019J05085 Startup Fund for Scientific research, Fujian Mecial University 2020QH1067 Fujian Medical University 10.13039/501100013795 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date 15 October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  H.

Cao Hsa_circRNA_0101125 Promotes Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma via miR ZNF148 The FASEB Journal 39 19 2025 e71031 10.1096/fj.202500257R  Funding: Abbreviations circRNA Circular RNA CSCs Cancer Stem Cells EMT Epithelial‐Mesenchymal Transition miR MicroRNA ZEB1 Zinc Finger E‐box Binding Homeobox 1 ZHX3 Zinc Fingers and Homeoboxes 3 ZNF148 Zinc Finger Protein 148 1 Introduction Esophageal cancer is an invasive malignant tumor that causes over 400,000 deaths worldwide every year [ 1 2 3 2 3 4 Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non‐coding RNAs that lack a 5′ end cap and a 3′ end poly (A) tail, and form ring structures by covalent bonds. CircRNAs can serve as miRNA sponges (competing endogenous RNA, ceRNA mechanism) to regulate gene expression in a variety of cancers, thereby affecting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells [ 5 6 7 MicroRNAs (miRs) are non‐coding single‐stranded RNAs that contain 20–23 nucleotides, which block mRNA translation and regulate target gene expression by degrading mRNA or by complementing mRNA coding sequences [ 8 9 10 11 12 Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) represent one of the largest families of transcription factors and are deeply involved in diverse cancer‐related processes, including proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the regulatory role of the hsa_circRNA_0101125/miR‐143‐3p/ZNF148 axis in ESCC progression. To achieve this, we employed two representative ESCC cell lines, KYSE150 and ECA109, and conducted a series of functional experiments, including in situ hybridization, RT‐qPCR, dual‐luciferase reporter assays, and phenotypic analyses of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The results demonstrated that hsa_circRNA_0101125 acts as a molecular sponge for miR‐143‐3p, thereby enhancing ZNF148 expression and promoting ESCC cell proliferation and motility. These findings might reveal a novel circRNA‐mediated ceRNA regulatory axis and suggest that hsa_circRNA_0101125 may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in ESCC. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 In Situ Hybridization The fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method was used to detect the localization of hsa_circRNA_0101125 in cultured ESCC cells. Cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips placed in 24‐well plates and cultured under standard conditions to 70%–80% confluence. These coverslips served as cell climbing slides for subsequent fluorescence in situ FISH. After paraffin removal and hydration, the slices were treated with pepsin diluted with 3% citric acid. In situ hybridization was performed using the hsa_circRNA_0101125 in situ hybridization kit (MK11075‐h, Boster, Wuhan, China), followed by fluorescence staining with Cy3 fluorescent antibody (Boster, Wuhan, China). Finally, the nuclei were stained with DAPI and the slices were observed under a fluorescence microscope (CKX53, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). 2.2 Cell Culture and Cell Transfection Esophageal cancer cell lines KYSE‐150 (CL‐0737, Procell, Wuhan, China) and ECA‐109 (BNCC342591, BeNa Culture Collection, Beijing, China) were cultured in complete culture medium RPMI‐1640 (KGM31800S, KeyGen Biotech, China) containing 2 μg/mL puromycin (P8230, Solarbio, Beijing, China) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, New York, USA) at 37°C in a culture incubator containing 5% CO 2 To investigate the functions of hsa_circRNA_0101125 and miR‐143‐3p in ESCC cells, the CH‐plvx‐shRNA‐hsa_circRNA_0101125 vector (synthesized by General Biol (Anhui) Co. LTD, Anhui, China), miR‐143‐3p mimic, and miR‐143‐3p inhibitor (both synthesized by General Biol (Anhui) Co. LTD, Anhui, China) were transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (L3000001, Thermo Fisher, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The working concentration for both the miRNA mimic and inhibitor was 25 nM, as recommended in the product datasheet. After transfection, cells were cultured for an additional 48 h before subsequent analyses. The mimics and inhibitors used in this study were shown in Table 1 TABLE 1 Mimics and inhibitors used in this study.

A total of 1 × 10 4 2.4 Wound Healing Assay ESCC cells in good condition were seeded into a 24‐well plate at a density of 1 × 10 6 24h/48h 0h 0h 2.5 Transwell Invasion Assay Transwell chambers with 8 μm pore size were pre‐coated with 60 μL of diluted Matrigel (1:6 in serum‐free medium; 356 234, BD Biosciences, New Jersey, USA) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Cells in good condition were defined as those displaying firm adherence, clear cytoplasm, and intact cell membranes under inverted microscopy. ESCC cells in good condition were digested, washed with PBS, and resuspended in serum‐free medium. A total of 200 μL of the cell suspension (1 × 10 5 2.6 Construction of Dual‐Luciferase Reporter Vectors The wild‐type (WT) and mutant (MUT) 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) sequences of ZNF148 containing the predicted miR‐143‐3p binding site were synthesized and cloned into the pmirGLO dual‐luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) using SacI and XhoI restriction sites. The predicted binding site of miR‐143‐3p was 5′‐UGAGAUGAAGCACUGUAGCUC‐3′. The WT‐ZNF148 3′UTR sequence included the intact miR‐143‐3p binding site, while in the MUT‐ZNF148 construct, several nucleotides at the binding site were substituted to disrupt miR‐143‐3p pairing. Plasmids were transformed into DH5α competent cells selected in LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin. The plasmid was extracted and RT‐qPCR was performed for validation. The sequences of WT‐ZNF148 (Wild Type‐ZNF148) were GAGCTCTTAGATTTTTAGGTTTGATATGGTTGTGTCATAATCAT CTCGTAATTGACAATTTTAACTTTTGGCAATAAAAGGAAATTGGGATATCTTTGGAACTGTAAAACCTGGTTTACTCGAG. The sequences of MUT‐ZNF148 (Mutant‐ZNF148) were GAGCTCTTAGATTTTTAGGTTTGATATGGTTGTGGACGAAGACGAGA GTAATTGACAATTTTAACTTTTGGCAATAAAAGGAAATTGGGATCGAGTTGGAACTGTAAAACCTGGTTTACTCGAG. For the reporter assay, KYSE‐150 and ECA‐109 cells were co‐transfected with either WT‐ZNF148‐pmirGLO or MUT‐ZNF148‐pmirGLO vectors and miR‐143‐3p mimic or negative control mimic (25 nM) in 24‐well plates. After 48 h of transfection, luciferase activity was measured using the Dual‐Luciferase Reporter Assay System (E1910, Promega, Wisconsin, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. 2.7 Dual‐Luciferase Assay KYSE150 and ECA109 cells were seeded in 24‐well plates and co‐transfected with either WT‐ZNF148‐pmirGLO or MUT‐ZNF148‐pmirGLO reporter plasmids (Promega, USA), together with 25 nM miR‐143‐3p mimic or negative control mimic, using Lipofectamine 3000 and P3000 reagent (L3000001, Thermo Fisher, Massachusetts, USA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, plasmids and mimics were diluted in Opti‐MEM medium and mixed with transfection reagents to form complexes. After incubation, the complexes were added to the cells and incubated for 48 h. Cells were then lysed on ice using lysis buffer; the lysed cell samples were stored at −80°C. Cell lysate from each group was taken and added into the 96‐well plate, and luciferase test reagent was added into each well to detect the activity of firefly luciferase. Then, Renilla luciferase test reagent (substrate: buffer =1:100) was added into each well, and the Renilla luciferase activity was detected. All experiments were performed in triplicate. 2.8  RT qPCR Total RNA was extracted from ESCC cells using the Trizol reagent (CW0580S, CWBIO, Jiangsu, China). RNA/miRNA was extracted using the RNA ultrapure extraction kit (CW0581M, CWBIO, Jiangsu, China)/miRNA ultrapure extraction kit (CW0627S, CWBIO, Jiangsu, China), and mRNA concentration and purity were measured using a UV visible spectrophotometer. For mRNA reverse transcription, the PrimeScriptTM RT reagent kit (RR047A; Takara Medical Technology, Beijing, China) was used to generate cDNA from the extracted RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. For miRNA reverse transcription, specific stem‐loop primers were designed and synthesized to target mature miR‐143‐3p. Reverse transcription was carried out using the miRNA First‐Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MR201‐01, Vazyme Biotech, China) under the following conditions: 25°C for 5 min, 50°C for 15 min, and 85°C for 5 min. Fluorescence quantitative PCR was performed using a fluorescence PCR instrument (CFX Connect Real‐Time PCR Detection System, Bio‐Rad Laboratories (Shanghai) Co. Ltd.). The reaction steps were as follows: predenaturation at 95°C for 10 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 58°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s. β‐actin and U6 were used as the internal controls. The relative expression level of genes was calculated using the 2‐ △△ 2 TABLE 2 Primers used in this study.

The cell culture medium was discarded; RIPA cell lysate (C1053, ApplyGen, Beijing, China) was added, and the samples were placed on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation with a high‐speed centrifuge (12 000 r/min) for 10 min, the supernatant was taken and transferred to a new EP tube. BCA protein assay kit (E‐BC‐K318‐M, Elabscience, Wuhan, China) was used to detect protein concentration in cell supernatant. SDS‐PAGE was performed and the proteins were then transferred onto the PVDF membrane (IPVH00010, Millipore, Massachusetts, USA). The membrane was blocked with 3% skim milk for 1 h. After incubation with Rabbit Anti ZNF148 (1/1000; AF0792, Affinity, Jiangsu, China), Mouse Anti Vimentin (1/1000; 60 330–1‐Ig, Proteintech, Wuhan, China), Rabbit Anti E‐Cadherin (1/1000; AF0131, Affinity, Jiangsu, China) or Mouse Anti‐β‐Actin (1/2000; HC201, TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) overnight, the membrane was washed three times. HRP conjugated Goat Anti Mouse IgG (H + L) (1/2000; GB23301, Servicebio, Wuhan, China) or HRP conjugated Goat Anti‐Rabbit IgG (H + L) (GB23303, Servicebio, Wuhan, China) was added to incubate the membrane for 2 h, and then the membrane was washed three times. The PVDF membrane was soaked with luminescent liquid (RJ239676, Thermo Fisher, Massachusetts, USA) and images were developed under the ultra‐high sensitivity chemiluminescence imaging system (Chemi DocTM XRS+, Bio‐Rad Laboratories (Shanghai) Co. Ltd.). Band intensity was quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, USA). Relative protein expression levels were normalized to GAPDH and expressed as fold change over control. All blots were repeated in at least three independent experiments. 2.10 Statistical Analysis SPSS 20.0 software was used for statistical analysis. All experiments were repeated three times, and the quantitative results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (X ± S). The quantitative values between the two groups were compared using an independent sample t p 3 Results 3.1 The Localization of hsa_circRNA_0101125 and the Expression of Related Genes in KYSE150 ECA109 The FISH method was used to detect the localization of hsa_circRNA_0101125 in KYSE150 cells.

ESCC cells have a strong ability to proliferate and migrate, leading to cancer metastasis [ 3 4 21 6 21 7 MiRNAs are single stranded RNAs that contain 20–23 non‐coding nucleotides and play important roles in regulating cancer development. MiR‐143‐3p, as a tumor suppressor, can inhibit the occurrence of cancers such as ESCC, ovarian cancer, and gallbladder cancer [ 11 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a cellular biological process in which epithelial cells gradually lose their cellular characteristics and morphology and gradually acquire the characteristics of mesenchymal phenotype [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 12 36 Despite the significant findings, several limitations should be acknowledged in this study. First, although our study demonstrated that hsa_circRNA_0101125 regulates ZNF148 expression through sponging miR‐143‐3p, the regulatory effect of miR‐143‐3p on ZNF148 protein expression was assessed in the context of hsa_circRNA_0101125 knockdown and rescue. This approach provided indirect evidence supporting the negative regulatory relationship between miR‐143‐3p and ZNF148, as reflected by the downregulation of ZNF148 upon hsa_circRNA_0101125 silencing and its partial restoration following miR‐143‐3p inhibition. However, direct validation of miR‐143‐3p's impact on ZNF148 protein levels in isolation was not performed in this study. Future investigations might explore this regulatory interaction more thoroughly by independently evaluating the effects of miR‐143‐3p mimics and inhibitors on ZNF148 expression. Second, the observed changes in E‐cadherin and Vimentin expression following modulation of the hsa_circRNA_0101125/miR‐143‐3p axis suggest a potential link to EMT. While miR‐143‐3p has been previously associated with EMT regulation [ 37 5 Conclusions In conclusion, this study revealed that hsa_circRNA_0101125, as a tumor promoting factor, plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of ESCC. The hsa_circRNA_0101125 regulates the proliferation, migration, and stemness transformation of ESCC cells through the miR‐143‐3p/ZNF148 axis. This study may provide a potential new treatment strategy for ESCC.
