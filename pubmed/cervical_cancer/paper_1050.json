An alarming increase in the incidence of OTSCC in the younger age group. This study aimed to explore clinical and histopathological characteristics, survival, and other post-surgical outcomes in patients with OTSCC treated with glossectomy through the Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery at the Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs (MNGHA) within our study period. This is a retrospective study carried out through the collection and analysis of data from medical charts of 56 patients with oral tongue cancer who were treated by glossectomy. Treatment was initiated from January 2010 to December 2021. Patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, treatment modality, failure patterns, and survival rates were collected and analyzed. At diagnosis, 62.5% were tobacco smokers, 46.8% had poor dental hygiene, and 76.8% had ulcerative lesions. Furthermore, 33 cases presented with early-stage clinical disease and 23 cases with advanced stage. The median follow-up was 54 months, 28 patients (50%) were free for 3–5 years.
