Although acquired resistance is still a significant obstacle, PARP inhibitors, e.g., olaparib, have demonstrated promise in prolonging progression-free survival (PFS) in these individuals. The therapeutic potential of CDCA5 silencing in conjunction with olaparib to improve treatment effectiveness for ovarian cancer with a BRCA1 mutation is examined in this study. Methods Using BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer cell lines (UWB1.289 and SNU251) and xenograft models, we analyzed the effects of CDCA5 knockdown alone or combined with olaparib. Functional assays (CCK-8, immunofluorescence, TEM, western blot) evaluated proliferation, autophagy, DNA damage, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling. Results CDCA5 knockdown inhibited proliferation, activated autophagy, and induced DNA damage in BRCA1-mutated cells. Moreover, combination with olaparib synergistically enhanced these effects, with significant tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Mechanistically, the combination suppressed the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, promoting autophagy and exacerbating DNA damage. Pharmacological activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR reversed these antitumor effects. Conclusions The anticancer effects of olaparib are enhanced by CDCA5 knockdown, which also promotes autophagy and exacerbates DNA damage via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. These findings provide a novel therapeutic approach for treating BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer that overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance and enhances treatment results.

By encouraging autophagy and enhancing DNA damage via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, we reveal for the first time that CDCA5 knockdown dramatically improves the anticancer effects of olaparib. These findings uncover a novel mechanism underlying olaparib sensitivity and highlight CDCA5 as a critical modulator of therapeutic response in BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer. Our findings suggest valuable insights into overcoming PARP inhibitor resistance and point to a promising novel combination approach for treatment of ovarian cancer with BRCA1 mutation. Materials and methods Cell culture Human normal ovarian epithelial cells (IOSE-80) as well as BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer cell lines (UWB1.289 and SNU251) were provided by the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). All cells were incubated in RPMI-1640 medium (Cat. No. 11875085, Gibco, USA) which was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Cat. No. A5670701, Gibco, USA) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 Cell transfection and treatment UWB1.289 and SNU251 cells were transfected with 20 nmol/L of either a negative control siRNA (si-NC) or a small interfering RNA targeting CDCA5 (si-CDCA5), both of which were produced by GenePharma (Shanghai, China), in order to reduce CDCA5 expression. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Cat. No. 13778100, Invitrogen, USA) was used for transfection, and the reagent-to-siRNA ratio was 3:1 (µL: pmol) for 24 h. Supplementary Table 1 contains a list of the siRNA sequences that were employed. For drug treatment, cells were exposed to 5 µM olaparib (Cat. No. HY-10162, MedChemExpress, USA) to assess its effects based on a prior study [ 25 Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay UWB1.289 and SNU251 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a concentration of 3,000 cells per well and incubated under standard conditions for 24 h in order to analyze the cell viability. Following the addition of 10 µL of CCK-8 reagent (Cat. No. 96992, Sigma, USA) to each well, the wells were retained for two hours at 37 °C. After that, absorbance was detected at 450 nm by a microplate reader (Epoch, BioTek, USA). Immunofluorescence staining After 20 min of room temperature fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (Cat. No. P6148, Sigma, USA), cells were permeabilized for 15 min with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Cat. No. P0096, Beyotime, China). Following 30 min of blocking with blocking buffer (Cat. No. P0260, Beyotime), cells were treated with rabbit monoclonal antibodies against LC3 (1:100, Cat. No. ab232940, Abcam, USA) or γ-H2AX (1:100, Cat. No. ab81299, Abcam, USA) for an entire night at 4 °C. Cells were cultured with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:100, Cat. No. ab150081, Abcam, USA) for 1 h at room temperature after three PBS washes. A fluorescence microscope (Ti2-U, Nikon, Japan) was used to view fluorescent signals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) After being fixed for two hours at room temperature in 2.5% glutaraldehyde, cells ready for ultrastructural examination were post-fixed for one hour in 1% osmium tetroxide. Samples were examined using a TEM (JEM-1400, JEOL, Japan) following staining with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Animal studies Jackson Laboratory provided the female BALB/c nude mice, 6–8 weeks old and weighted 20–25 g. With a 12-hour light/dark cycle, temperature of 22 ± 2 °C, humidity of 50 ± 10%, and unfettered access to water and food, they were kept under regulated environmental conditions. UWB1.289 cells transduced with si-NC or si-CDCA5 lentivirus were suspended in a 200 µL solution of PBS as well as Matrigel and subcutaneously injected into the right flanks of mice at a density of 5 × 10 6 n 25  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$Volume\\,=\\,0.5 \\times a \\times {b^2}$$\\end{document} where a b Animals were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane after 21 days of treatment and euthanized by cervical dislocation. After being removed, tumors were examined further. The Animal Ethics Committee of Bengbu Medical University gave its approval for all animal studies, which were carried out in compliance with the ARRIVE criteria (Approval No. [2024]376). Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining The tumor tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned at a thickness of 4 μm, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated using graded alcohols before being stained for 5 min with hematoxylin (Cat. No. G1004, Servicebio, China). Eosin (Cat. No. G1002, Servicebio, China) was used for counterstaining, and 1% hydrochloric acid-alcohol was used for differentiation. Sections were dehydrated and cleared in xylene before being mounted and seen under the microscope (Eclipse Ni-U, Nikon, Japan). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Tumor sections fixed in paraffin were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then exposed to a boiling water bath for 20 min to retrieve antigen using 10 mM EDTA buffer (pH 8.0). 3% hydrogen peroxide was applied to inhibit endogenous peroxidase activity for 15 min. Then sections were retained with a primary antibody against Ki67 (1:200, Cat. No. AF0198, Affinity, USA) for a whole night at 4 °C. Following PBS washes, sections were treated with a secondary antibody (1:400, Cat. No. SA00004, ProteinTech, USA) for 20 min at room temperature. DAB was employed to reflect the color, and hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. Following differentiation, dehydration, and mounting, stained sections were visualized under a Nikon microscope. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay Instructed by the manufacturer, a TUNEL Cell Apoptosis Detection Kit (Cat. No. C1091, Beyotime, China) was used to identify apoptotic cells in tumor tissues. DAB was used to produce the color, and then hematoxylin restaining, differentiation, dehydration, and mounting were performed. A Nikon device was used to evaluate stained slices under a microscope. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) The RNeasy Mini Kit (Cat. No. 74106, Qiagen, Germany) was applied to extract total RNA from cells. A spectrophotometer (NanoDrop 2000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was employed to confirm the quality of the RNA, guaranteeing an A260/A280 ratio between 1.8 and 2.0. The Omniscript RT Kit (Cat. No. 205111, Qiagen, Germany) was used to generate complementary DNA (cDNA), and the Taq PCR Master Mix (Cat. No. 201445, Qiagen, Germany) was administered to conduct qRT-PCR. After normalizing CDCA5 expression to GAPDH, the 2^-ΔΔCt technique was adopted to determine relative expression levels. Supplementary Table 2 provided specific primer sequence information. Western blotting For 30 min, cells and tumor tissues were lysed on ice with intermittent vortexing every 5 min in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors (Cat. No. P0038, Beyotime, China). Using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Cat. No. P0009, Beyotime, China), protein concentrations were determined. Protein (30 µg) in equal quantities was divided using 10% SDS-PAGE; then put onto PVDF membranes at 100 V for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Membranes were blocked with 3% BSA for one hour at room temperature, then treated with primary antibodies for a whole night at 4 °C. Next, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were retained for an additional hour. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Cat. No. P0018, Beyotime, China) was used to observe protein bands. Supplementary Table 3 lists all of the antibodies that were employed. Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6. Comparisons between two groups were evaluated using the student’s t p Results CDCA5 is highly expressed in ovarian cancer Western blot analysis revealed CDCA5 expression considerably higher in BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer cell lines (UWB1.289 and SNU251) compared to normal ovarian epithelial cells (IOSE-80) ( P P 1 P 1 CDCA5 knockdown suppresses proliferation and induces autophagy and DNA damage in BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer cells The expression of CDCA5 was suppressed using siRNA in UWB1.289 and SNU251 cells in order to ascertain its functional role. Effective CDCA5 knockdown in both cell lines was verified by Western blot ( P 2 P P 2 P P 2 2 P 2 P 2 Synergistic effects of CDCA5 knockdown and Olaparib on proliferation inhibition, autophagy, and DNA damage We investigated whether combining olaparib with CDCA5 knockdown may result in increased anticancer effects, considering the function of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, in causing DNA damage through compromised base excision repair. In comparison to either therapy alone, co-treatment with si-CDCA5 and olaparib substantially decreased cell viability in UWB1.289 and SNU251 cells ( P P P 3 P P 3 3 P 3 P P 3 Combination therapy suppresses the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway We examined how the combination therapy affected the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in order to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms. Western blot analysis confirmed that, in comparison to controls, CDCA5 silencing alone decreased the phosphorylation levels of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR in UWB1.289 and SNU251 cells. The p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR ratios were significantly reduced by the addition of olaparib ( P P P 4 Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is essential for enhanced autophagy and DNA damage induced by combination treatment Pharmacological activators MHY1485 (mTOR activator) and 740 Y-P (PI3K/AKT activator) were applied to UWB1.289 cells treated with si-CDCA5 and olaparib in order to ascertain the part played by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in mediating the observed cellular effects. Both activators corrected the decline in cell viability caused by the combined treatment, according to CCK-8 tests ( P P 5 P P 5 P P P 5 P 5 P P P 5 CDCA5 knockdown combined with Olaparib suppresses tumor growth via autophagy and DNA damage through PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in vivo Using a xenograft mouse model, the anticancer effectiveness of CDCA5 knockdown combined with olaparib was further validated in vivo. P P 6 P 6 6 6 6 P P P 6 Discussion Ovarian cancer continues to be a significant clinical issue with a poor prognosis and limited treatment efficacy, especially in its advanced and recurring phases [ 1 2 7 With increased expression levels in such tissues and cell lines, CDCA5, a crucial regulator of cell cycle progression, has been corelated to the progress of ovarian cancer [ 10 26 27 10 26 27 Autophagy, an essential cellular mechanism that facilitates the degradation of damaged organelles and proteins, is intricately linked to cancer cell proliferation, drug resistance, and chemotherapy sensitivity [ 11 11 12 13 14 By degrading repair proteins and disrupting DNA repair pathways, autophagy has been demonstrated to exacerbate DNA damage [ 18 28 One well-known autophagy regulator that is commonly dysregulated in ovarian cancer is the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway [ 29 29 30 19 31 23 Findings in the present study support the therapeutic potential of CDCA5 as a novel target for combination therapy in BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer, in addition to the molecular insights. Although prior research has examined the distinct functions of either CDCA5 or olaparib in ovarian cancer, the combined effects of these two medications have not been documented. According to our analysis, CDCA5 silencing in conjunction with olaparib not only prevents tumor progression but also makes such BRCA1-mutated cells more susceptible to to the function of PARP inhibition. From a clinical translation perspective, CDCA5-targeted therapy holds promise but faces challenges. Currently, no specific small-molecule inhibitors of CDCA5 have entered clinical trials, but strategies to silence CDCA5 (e.g., siRNA or shRNA) could be delivered using lipid nanoparticles or antibody-drug conjugates to enhance tumor targeting and reduce off-target effects [ 32 33 34 To sum up, the study presents novel evidence that CDCA5 silencing, in conjunction with olaparib, causes autophagy and worsens DNA damage in such cells, which significantly inhibits tumor development. This combination treatment shows promise as a novel approach to overcome medication resistance and improve clinical outcomes in individuals with BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer by targeting CDCA5 and raising the cell susceptibility to PARP inhibition.

Furthermore, via altering the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, CDCA5 knockdown and the PARP inhibitor olaparib function in concert to elicit anticancer effects. These findings highlight CDCA5 as a promising therapeutic target and imply that a novel approach to improving treatment effectiveness and overcoming resistance in BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer may involve combining CDCA5 inhibition with PARP inhibition. To confirm the safety and effectiveness of this combination treatment, more preclinical and clinical research is necessary. Supplementary Information  Additional file 1.
