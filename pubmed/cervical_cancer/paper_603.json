Introduction Starch is a renewable and biodegradable plant resource. The processing of food, cosmetics, and feed extensively utilizes starch and its derived compounds. Corn starch accounts for a high proportion of the global starch market. Waxy maize starch (WMS) exhibits significantly different physical and chemical properties compared with ordinary corn starch, including paste stability, transparency, and retrogradation tendency [ 1 2 3 4 5 Debranching is a common technique for starch modification. Numerous novel qualities are possessed by debranched starch, including excellent hydrogel characteristics [ 6 7 8 9 MADBS represents a newly developed form of resistant starch, pioneered by our research team, with no existing studies evaluating its efficacy. The potential of its novel structure to impart superior or unique prebiotic functions remains uncertain, particularly in terms of modulating specific bacterial taxa such as Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus 2. Experimental Section 2.1. Fermentation Medium WMS and malate MADBS were prepared according to the previously published method [ 9 10 2 4 2 4 4 2 2 2 2.2. Collection of Human Fecal Samples This study included nine healthy adults aged between 23 and 43. All donors had a normal diet and had not taken any medications for the last four months before sample collection. Nine healthy adult donors provided fecal samples following a standardized protocol. Donors were instructed to collect fresh samples in sterile containers, which were immediately transported to the laboratory and processed to make the bacteria suspension within 1 h to minimize microbial community changes. Each sample (1.0 g) was resuspended separately in 10 mL PBS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0), and the fecal slurry was filtered through 200 mesh filter to remove debris. Samples from each donor were pooled and were injected into the fermentation bottle. The experiment complied with all the ethical requirements. Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Ethics Committee of the Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences (approval code: ZAASES [2024]01, and approval date: 25 November 2024). 2.3. In Vitro Fermentation The fecal suspensions were inoculated into YCFA, WMS, and MADBS media. In vitro fermentation was performed at 37 °C for 24 h. In addition, 8 mg/mL of WMS and MADBS was used for the in vitro fermentation procedure. The concentration was selected in in vitro experiments based on our previous dose-gradient studies with other prebiotics. This concentration represented the maximum tolerable dose. In the anaerobic chamber, 500 μL of freshly prepared fecal suspension inoculum was introduced into a 15 mL anaerobic bottle containing 5.0 mL of YCFA medium or control medium, respectively, using sterile disposable syringes. Fermentation was carried out at 37 °C for 24 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility. Throughout the fermentation process, oxygen was excluded, and the pH of the YCFA medium was maintained at 6.5. All fermentations were performed under static anaerobic conditions, with the anaerobic headspace maintained by pure nitrogen gas. 2.4. Determination of Gas Composition After a 24 h fermentation period, the butyl rubber stopper was punctured inside a biological safety cabinet using a sterile syringe needle. As described in the literature, the gas generated during fermentation inside the vial was then introduced into the gas analyzer (Empaer gas detector, Shenzhen, China), which could measure the content of five gases simultaneously through the principle and working of a sensor. The infrared detector was used to determine methane (CH 4 2 3 2 2 2.5. Short-Chain Fatty Acid (SCFA) Quantification A solution of crotonic acid (0.6464 g) in 2.5% ( w v The GC operating conditions were as follows: high-purity nitrogen carrier gas was maintained at a flow rate of 12 mL/min. The detector gas mixture comprised nitrogen (30 mL/min), hydrogen (40 mL/min), and air (400 mL/min). The temperature program initiated with a 70 °C isothermal hold for 30 s, followed by ramping to 190 °C, and subsequently increasing to 240 °C at 40 °C/min (5 min hold). The FID detector and vaporization chamber were maintained at 250 °C and 280 °C, respectively. 2.6. Analysis of Intestinal Flora Genomic DNA extracted from fecal samples (FastPure Stool DNA Isolation Kit, MJYH, Shanghai, China) was assessed for purity using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). The 16S rRNA gene was amplified with primer pairs 338F (5′-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GGACTACHVGGG- TWTCTAAT-3′). Purified amplicons were pooled in equimolar amounts, and paired-end sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq2000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the standard protocols by Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The raw sequencing reads were deposited into the sequence read archive database of National Center for Biotechnology Information. Processing of raw sequencing data involved de-multiplexing (in-house Perl script), quality filtering (fastp v0.19.6 [ 11 12 13 14 Selection of the representative read for each OTU was performed utilizing the QIIME ackage (version 1.9). With a confidence threshold of 0.7, OTUs were taxonomically annotated using the RDP Classifier and the SILVA database (v138) as a reference. The community structure of bacteria was analyzed at the genus and phylum levels based on the taxonomic information. Alpha diversity was calculated based on observed OTU, and the Chao index. Principal component analysis (PCA) and principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) were performed to compare the similarities and differences in microbial communities among the CK, WCS, and MADBS groups. Alpha diversity comparisons among the three groups were performed using between-group difference testing of the Chao1 index, analyzed by one-way ANOVA. R (version 3.3.1) was used for statistical analysis and graphing. 2.7. Animal Experiment Design A total of 30 C57BL/6 healthy male mice (8 weeks old) were purchased from Hangzhou Ziyuan Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China, and then randomly divided into three groups: a control group (CK), a WMS group receiving 40 mg per day, and a MADBS group receiving 40 mg per day. Each group contained 10 mice. The animals were randomly allocated to cages across a room to account for spatial variability. Each mouse was placed separately in a sterile animal chamber, maintaining the room temperature at approximately 20 °C and the relative humidity between 45% and 55%. The mice were fed individually in their own cages. All the groups were administered for 14 days and underwent the same experimental procedure with a regular diet. The fresh fecal samples were collected immediately after defecation to analyze intestinal flora. The mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation after being anesthetized with isoflurane. For the gut microbiota analysis, 5 mice in the CK group and 8 mice in the treatment group were included in the analysis. Due to the difficulty in dissolving WCS and MADBS, during the initial gavage procedure, 9 mice experienced pulmonary aspiration and died. Consequently, 5 mice from the CK group were reassigned to the treatment groups to compensate for the loss. The Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences’ Ethics Committee approved this research (No. 2024ZAASLA111). 2.8. Correlation Analysis of Metabolite Factors and Gut Microbiota Correlation heatmaps were generated based on correlation coefficients between the gut microbiota and both gases and SCFAs. The numerical matrix was presented through a heatmap. The color gradient in the heatmap reflects the data information in the two-dimensional matrix or table, with color intensity representing the magnitude of data values, thereby providing an intuitive visualization where numerical values are represented by defined color shades. The analysis was conducted using R software (version 3.3.1) with the pheatmap package (version 1.0.12). 2.9. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software (version 9.5). Statistical differences were determined by conducting either a paired t p p 3. Results 3.1. Effects of WMS and MADBS on SCFA Production WMS and MADBS in human fecal samples were fermented to produce SCFAs ( Figure 1 Supplementary Materials Table S1 Figure 1 3.2. Analysis of the Content of Gas Component After 24 h of in vitro human fecal fermentation, gas component analysis revealed that the CK group exhibited higher levels of CH 4 3 2 2 2 4 3 2 2 Figure 2 Supplementary Materials Table S2 3.3. Impact of WMS and MADBS on Human Gut Microbiota by In Vitro Fermentation To investigate the impact of WMS and MADBS on human gut microbiota structure, we analyzed the microbial composition of fecal samples using in vitro fermentation. The PCA plot shows microbial community profiles of a pooled fecal sample from nine healthy donors after 24 h of fermentation under three conditions (CK, WMS, MADBS). Each condition included three technical replicates, represented by the nine points (three points per condition). The microbial composition of WMS and MADBS groups deviated from the cluster of control according to the PCA analysis ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Relative abundance analysis at the genus level revealed that WMS stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus Megamonas Megasphaera Escherichia-Shigella Figure 3 Weisslla Lactobacillus Prevotella Fusobacterium Escherichia-Shigella Megamonas Microbial communities showing significant differences among the three groups were statistically analyzed. The 10 dominant genera are shown in Figure 3 Fusobacterium Escherichia-Shigella Raoultella Blautia Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium Megamonas Prevotella Lactobacillus Weisslla Prevotella Table 1 Supplementary Materials Table S3 The heatmap illustrates the distribution of the top dominant species in three groups, demonstrating the trends of species changes in the CK and treatment groups. The changes in abundance of different species were displayed using the gradient of color blocks, with the values corresponding to the color gradient. The dominant species in the MADBS group were Lactobacillus Weissella Lactococcus Klebsiella Faecalibacterium Alloprevotella Anaerostipes Roseburia Klebsiella Senegalimassilia Bilophila Desulfovibrio Allisonella Eggerthella Lachnospiraceae Figure 4 Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium Megamonas Megasphaera Collinsella Mitsuokella Catenibacterium Streptococcus Prevotella Lachnospiraceae Desulfovibrio Fusobacterium Bilophila Butyricimonas Roseburia, Hafnia-Obesumbacterium 3.4.

Analysis of Gut Microbiota in Mice The gut microbiota analysis of mice revealed that the WMS and MADBS groups differed from the CK group.

Discussion Debranched starch (DBS) is primarily composed of linear starch molecules formed by the debranching of WMS, while MADBS is produced through the esterification reaction between MA (malic acid) and the hydroxyl groups at the C2, C3, and C6 positions of the glucose units in DBS. MADBS exhibited a higher degree of substitution (DS) and a greater content of resistant starch (RS) [ 9 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 The decrease in SCFA production may be attributed to ineffective microbial fermentation of MADBS. One potential explanation is that MABDS is difficult to use effectively due to its complex structure and limited microbial metabolic capacity. Our data suggest that MADBS may suppress the proliferation of SCFA-producing microbial populations, leading to decreased SCFA production. The decrease in SCFAs in the MADBS group was associated with reduced relative abundance of Butyricimonas Clostridium Figure 4 Lactobacilli 22 23 24 Figure 2 Gas analysis revealed that the WMS and MADBS groups exhibited lower levels of CH 4 3 2 Figure 5 4 2 Bilophila Raoultella Escherichia-Shigella Lactobacillus Prevotella Alloprevotella, 2 Bilophila Desulfovibrio Figure 4 2 25 26 4 27 28 Given the crucial role of the gut microbiota in human health and disease, its composition and abundance are subject to dietary influence. Certain foods can promote the growth of beneficial gut microbes, thereby improving the intestinal environment [ 15 29 Bifidobacteria Lactobacillus Bifidobacteria 30 Escherichia-Shigella 31 The findings also demonstrated that the MADBS group exhibited a significantly higher abundance of Weissella Lactobacillus Prevotella Weissella 32 33 34 Prevotella 35 Prevotella 36 37 Prevotella Fusobacterium Escherichia-Shigella Megamonas Megamonas 38 Megamonas 39 Fusobacterium nucleatum 40 41 Fusobacterium varium 42 The effects of WMS and MADBS on the intestinal microbiota of mice were investigated in this study using mouse models. A species composition analysis of the mouse gut microbiota after WMS treatment revealed a significant rise in the population of Muribaculaceae Bifidobacterium Muribaculaceae 43 Muribaculaceae 44 45 46 Ileibacterium 47 Muribaculaceae Dubosiella Dubosiella newyorkensis 48 This study utilized an in vitro fecal fermentation model to explore the effects of WMS and MADBS on the adult gut microbiota, its metabolites, and the subsequent formation of SCFAs and gases. Notably, Liu et al. employed the Mucosal-Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME) to evaluate the colonic fermentation profiles of WMS [ 49 Bifidobacteriaceae 5. Conclusions WMS and MADBS significantly influence the richness and diversity of murine gut microbiota. Specifically, WMS treatment resulted in a higher relative abundance of Muribaculaceae Bifidobacterium Ileibacterium Muribaculaceae Dubosiella Bifidobacterium Lactobacillus Megamonas Megasphaera Weissella Lactobacillus Prevotella Escherichia-Shigella 4 3 2 These findings demonstrate that WMS and MADBS can effectively modulate the gut microbial ecosystem by enriching probiotics and suppressing potential pathogens while concurrently altering metabolic outputs. This suggests their potential as dietary interventions for gut microbiota regulation.
