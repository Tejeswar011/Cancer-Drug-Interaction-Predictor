Introduction Prostate cancer (PCa) ranks as the second most prevalent cancer, trailing only behind lung cancer in men [ 1 2 3 4 5 Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) boasts a rich and extensive history in cancer treatment, which has garnered significant interest in recent years. This interest is particularly evident in the exploration of how TCM can be integrated with modern medical practices [ 6 7 Cullen corylifolium Drynaria roosii Neolitsea cassia Poria cocos Paeonia lactiflora Paeonia × suffruticosa Prunus persica 8 9 10 11 High-throughput sequencing based high-throughput screening (HTS 2 12 13 2 14 15 16 17 18 This study aims to systematically investigate the inhibitory effects of MGFD on human PCa cells and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Initially, to evaluate the regulatory effects of MGFD on PCa cells, related cellular experiments were conducted. Subsequently, HTS 2 2. Results 2.1. MGFD Inhibits the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of PCa Cells The cell viability of MGFD-extract-treated DU145 and PC3 cells was measured. The 50% inhibitory concentration value for DU145 and PC3 cells were 118.2 μg/mL and 104.1 μg/mL, respectively ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 2.2. Construction of 270 Gene Expression Profiles from MGFD-Perturbed Prostate Cancer Cells Through HTS 2 Through the application of the HTS 2 Table S1 2 Figure S1 Figure S2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Table S2 Figure S3 2.3. Buguzhi and Guizhi Show More DEGs than Those of Other Herbs in MGFD Buguzhi and Guizhi exhibited a greater number of DEGs than other herbs in MGFD (100 μg/mL). The expression profiles of genes revealed that the DU145 cell line showed the greatest quantity of DEGs for Buguzhi, comprising 161 upregulated and 117 downregulated genes. Chishao had the lowest number of DEGs, with 33 genes, including 16 upregulated and 17 downregulated genes. Other herbs showed varying numbers of DEGs, including Guizhi (165), Gusuibu (69), Mudanpi (141), Fuling (74), and Taoren (54) ( Figure 3 Table S3 Figure 3 Figure S4 Cluster analysis of the DEGs was conducted to explore the relevance of each herb in the MGFD. The results showed that the seven herbs of MGFD could be categorized into three main groups: Buguzhi and Guizhi in group 1; Gusuibu and Fuling in group 2; and Mudanpi, Chishao, and Taoren in group 3. ( Figure 3 2.4. Investigation of Effect of Each Herb in MGFD on Gene Sets The impact of each herb in MGFD on tumors was analyzed using a Sankey network, integrating the pathway-related biological functions revealed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) based on hallmark gene sets ( Figure 4 Table S4 UpSet plots were used to visually present the enriched gene sets of the seven herbs across different cell lines, facilitating comparison of their similarities and differences ( Figure S5 Figure 4 Figure 4 2.5. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway Network Enrichment Analysis Identified Three Hub Pathways KEGG enrichment analysis was performed for each of the seven herbs in MGFD, and the Herb-KEGG interaction network was established. Topology analysis revealed the fifteen pathways exhibiting the highest degree scores across each cell line, as illustrated in Figure 5 Tables S5 and S6 Figure 5 Figure 5 Table S7 The biological functions of the DEGs in the MGFD were further elucidated through Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. The DEGs in both cell lines were primarily involved in the cellular response to chemical stress/external stimuli, apoptotic signaling pathway regulation, cell cycle, and wound healing ( Figure 5 Table S8 2.6. Active Component-Target Network Construction and Its Enrichment Analysis Through Network Pharmacology Initially, 79 active components associated with the MGFD were extracted from the databases. These components were selected based on screening conditions such as OB ≥ 30% and DL ≥ 0.18. Subsequently, SwissTargetPrediction identified the drug targets associated with these active components, resulting in 691 drug targets after eliminating redundant targets ( Table S9 Table S10 Figure 6 Figure 6 To illustrate the relationship between active components and potential therapeutic targets, an active-target network for MGFD was created with the help of Cytoscape. This network comprised 84 PCa-associated targets and 79 active components ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 2.7. Genetic Alterations and Survival Analysis of These Therapeutic Targets in PCa Patients To delve deeper into the molecular signatures associated with the 84 therapeutic targets among various cohorts of PCa patients, analyses of genetic alterations and survival were conducted utilizing cBioPortal. The findings revealed that genetic alterations were observed in roughly 50% to 90% of PCa patients across the six different datasets. Gene alterations are more frequent in metastatic PCa than in nonmetastatic PCa. Notably, 84 therapeutic targets primarily exhibited mutations in non-metastatic PCa, whereas in metastatic PCa, they mainly showed multiple alterations and amplifications ( Figure 8 Figure 8 2.8. Disease-Free Survival Analysis of These Four Key Targets in PCa Patients The gene expression profiles from the HTS 2 Figure 9 p Figure 9 2.9. Disclosing Bioactive Components of MGFD Against Key Targets To validate previous research findings, molecular docking was employed to evaluate the selected bioactive components and their corresponding key targets. The binding energies obtained from the docking of these bioactive compounds and key targets are presented in Table 1 Figure 10 3. Discussion The global healthcare system is facing a significant challenge in effectively treating PCa owing to its rising incidence associated with an aging population. Despite the approval of various novel drugs in recent years, the mortality rate associated with PCa remains high [ 25 26 27 11 28 In this research, we performed phenotypic experiments to show that MGFD hinders the growth and invasion of DU145 and PC3 cells. Notably, the large-scale gene expression profiles generated through the HTS 2 MGFD inhibited the growth of PCa cells mainly through three pathways: FoxO signaling pathway, cellular senescence, and TNF signaling pathway. The FoxO signaling pathway is essential for numerous cellular function regulations, including apoptosis, control of the cell cycle, and responses to oxidative stress [ 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 By combining transcriptional analysis with network pharmacology, we identified four key targets: AKT1, CASP8, CDK1, and CCND1. AKT1 is a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates specific residues of FOXO transcription factors. This mechanism causes the movement of FOXO from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, which in turn reduces its ability to activate transcription. As a result, cancer cell survival and invasion are promoted by downregulating the genes responsible for FOXO-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest [ 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 The findings from molecular docking suggested that the primary bioactive compounds of MGFD, which may have the ability to inhibit PCa cells, encompass baicalein, quercetin, and 5-[[5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-furyl] methylene] barbituric acid. Baicalein and quercetin are members of the flavonoid family and demonstrate a diverse array of biological functions [ 46 47 48 49 TCM is characterized by multiple pathways, targets, and components for disease treatment, leading to synergistic effects [ 50 51 2 However, several limitations remain in this study. First, the lack of in vivo experimental validation restricts a comprehensive assessment of MGFD’s antitumor efficacy within the complex physiological environment. Second, this study primarily relied on the HTS 2 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Preparation of MGFD and UPLC-MS/MS Analysis The MGFD consists of Buguzhi, Gusuibu, Guizhi, Fuling, Chishao, Mudanpi, and Taoren at a weight ratio of 1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ( Table 2 High-resolution qualitative analysis of the constituents in MGFD was performed using the hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer (UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS) system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Prior to analysis, the UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS system underwent strict calibration to ensure accuracy. Mass error in the generated mass spectrometry data was expressed in parts per million (ppm). The identified compounds exhibited an absolute mass error of less than 5 ppm, indicating high reliability of the identification results. Subsequently, the mass spectra were matched against the mzCloud online database and the in-house traditional Chinese medicine component database (OTCML) for confirmation. This process enabled the identification of key components in MGFD and validated the authenticity and reliability of the compound herbal materials. Total ion current is shown in Figure S6A,B Table S11 Table S12 4.2. Cell Culture Human PC3 and DU145 cells were from CELLCOOK (Guangzhou, China) and BOSTER (Wuhan, China), respectively. PC3 cells, linked to bone metastasis in PCa, were grown in F12K medium (BasalMedia, Shanghai, China) enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, GeminiBio, West Sacramento, CA, USA), along with 100 U/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL of streptomycin (HyClone™, Logan, UT, USA). Meanwhile, DU145 cells, which are associated with brain metastasis, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, CA, USA) that also contained 10% FBS (GeminiBio, West Sacramento, CA, USA), as well as 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (HyClone™, Logan, UT, USA). The cells were kept under conditions of 37 °C and 5% CO 2 4.3. Cell Counting Kit-8 Assay The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8, MedChemExpress, Shanghai, China) was utilized to evaluate the viability of cells. PC3 and DU145 cell lines were uniformly distributed in 96-well plates (Corning, NY, USA), seeded at 1 × 10 4 ® 4.4. Wound Healing Assay PC3 and DU145 cell lines were placed in a 96-well plate (1 × 10 4 ® 4.5. Transwell Migration and Invasion Assay PC3 and DU145 cells were seeded onto polycarbonate filter membranes (6.5 mm in diameter, 8 μm pore size) in the upper transwell chambers (5 × 10 4 4.6. HTS 2 HTS 2 2 2 In the process of sample manipulation, PC3 and DU145 cells were cultured in 384-well plates (2 × 10 3 2 In the course of data processing, all reads were aligned to probe sequences and adjusted in relation to the expression levels of 18 stable housekeeping genes [ 52 2 2 Differential expression analysis was conducted using the DESeq2 R package (version 1.42.1) [ 53 p 54 4.7. GO and KEGG Enrichment Analysis The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), along with Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses, can uncover alterations in biological pathways and functions resulting from the DEGs. The R packages ClusterProfiler (version 3.18.1), DOSE (version 3.16.0), and enrichplot (version 1.10.2) were applied. To visualize the KEGG networks, CytoScape version 3.9.0 was used, and the topological analysis of these networks was conducted with the CytoNCA package. 4.8. Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis The STRING database ( https://cn.string-db.org/ 55 4.9. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was employed to assess how each herb influences different gene sets. This approach utilized a list of DEGs in each herb and gene set. The genes were matched to the ranked list, and subsequently, the running sum was calculated [ 56 4.10. Acquisition of Active Components and Targets of MGFD The chemical constituents of the MGFD were obtained from three distinct databases: Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database ( https://old.tcmsp-e.com/tcmsp.php 57 https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/databasecommons/database/id/437 58 http://www.organchem.csdb.cn/scdb/default.asp 59 https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 60 http://swisstargetprediction.ch/ 61 4.11.

Statistical Analysis A statistical examination of the experimental data was conducted three times utilizing Student's t p p p 4.16. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) Assay Total RNA was isolated from cells using the Cell Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), and subsequently reverse transcribed into cDNA with the cDNA Synthesis Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed on a Bio-Rad CFX Duet Fluorescent Quantitative PCR System using the ChamQ SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The thermal cycling protocol consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 59 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Relative expression levels of target genes were determined using the 2 −ΔΔCt 5. Conclusions Our research revealed that MGFD effectively hinders the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human PCa cells mainly by influencing the FoxO signaling pathway, promoting cellular senescence, and affecting the TNF signaling pathway. Key targets of MGFD in the treatment of PCa include AKT1, CASP8, CDK1, and CCND1. The primary potential bioactive compounds identified through molecular docking that contribute to the inhibition of PCa cells are baicalein, quercetin, and 5-[[5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-furyl] methylene] barbituric acid. The results emphasize MGFD's potential as an effective adjuvant in treating PCa ( Figure 11 Acknowledgments We sincerely thank Y.C., L.H., C.Z., Xue Tan, Tianli Pei, Yuqin Tang, Yue Gao, Pan Qin, Xianwen Zhang, Chao Hu, Yile Liao, Yue Ding, Jun Xie, Jinghong Deng, of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine for their support and help during the experiments.
