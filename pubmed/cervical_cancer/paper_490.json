Patients with BM have a poor prognosis. At present, there is no satisfactory treatment and no standard effective treatment. In recent years, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and surgical treatment have emerged as a promising treatment for recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer (CC). Case We report a 39-year-old CC patient whose cervical biopsy pathology showed adenocarcinoma with stage IIIC1r, and so underwent radical radiotherapy and chemotherapy 7 years ago. She was under a palliative enterostomy 4 years ago after intestinal perforation due to multiple recurrence of pelvic tumor. To our surprise, postoperative histopathology was squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, ASC was confirmed. The postoperative efficacy of intravenous chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy was partial response (PR), and the efficacy of immunomaintenance therapy was progressive disease (PD). While she had gone through the recurrence of intestinal leakage 3 years ago, Pelvic exenteration (PE) was performed (postoperative histopathology squamous cell carcinoma), the postoperative effect was complete response (CR), and the patient selected regular reexamination. Isolated BM focus was developed in August 2024, and radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy were refused after surgical treatment (postoperative histopathology adenocarcinoma). The progression-free survival (PFS) after BM is nearly one year. At present, the patient’s reexamination showed no obvious abnormality. Conclusion We report a case of ASC, whose at the initial treatment, the cervical lesions were mainly adenocarcinoma. However, pelvic metastatic lesion was mainly squamous carcinoma and underwent chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy combined with PE. The histopathology form of BM is adenocarcinoma. The surgical treatment has achieved remarkable curative effect and survival benefit.The choice of treatment is often based on the number of metastases in the patient’s clinical state, tumor size, and metastases in other organs.

Incomplete regression of tumor after RT is the most important prognostic factor for local failure. 11 12 13 14 13 15 16 Clinical experience in the treatment of ASC with recurrence and metastasis after radiotherapy is insufficient. Here, we present a case of a patient initially diagnosed as cervical adenocarcinoma as FIGO2021 stage IIIC1r, who had poor response to initial chemoradiotherapy. At pelvic recurrence, palliative surgery (confirmation histologically was ASC), chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and PE were given to achieve R0. R0, that is, the tumor is completely resected, refers to the situation where no cancer cells can be found at the resection margin under the microscope, and no cancer cells remain either with the naked eye or under the microscope. The lesion has been completely resected. Isolated lesion BM was found, and good clinical benefit was obtained after surgical treatment. Case Report The patient has no family history of CC, was not on any medicines and has not undergone cervical screening. Therefore, she is not sure whether she has cervical preneoplastic lesions. Seven years ago, she was 32-year-old with postcoital bleeding and gynecological examination indicates cervical masses, human papillomaviruses (HPV) and cervical biopsy pathology. The results show that HPV is positive for the 18 high-risk subtype. Moreover, the biopsy pathological result was adenocarcinoma with pelvic MRI suggested enlargement of left pelvic lymph nodes, and metastasis was considered, so the stage for she was IIIC1r (Timeline illustrated in Figure 1 Figure 1A Figure 1 Timeline of diagnose and treatment of the patient. ( A B C D Four years ago (Nov, 2020), due to “abdominal pain”, the patient’s abdominal CT examination revealed perforation of the sigmoid colon. After palliative “colectomy” and colostomy, postoperative histopathology indicated that low-medium differentiated squamous cell carcinoma was seen in the whole layer of the colon wall, and mucinous adenocarcinoma nodules were found in the mesentery. Combined with the medical history and immunohistochemical results, it was more likely to come from the cervix. The patient was diagnosed with a first recurrence of CC (PFS: 28m) and had a corrected clinical diagnosis of ASC ( Supplementary Figure 1 Figure 2A B Figure 2C Supplementary Figure 2 Figure 2C Figure 1B Figure 2 Imaging data of the patient before PE. ( A B C In Jul 2024 the patient had intermittent convulsions without obvious causes, accompanied by dizziness and headache. In Aug 2024, the 18F-FDG PET/CT ( Figure 3A Figure 3B Figure 3C Figure 1C Supplementary Figure 3 Figure 3 Imaging data of the patient BM preoperative. ( A B C The complicated medical history of the patient was not only reflected in the fact that she had undergone surgery for PE and BM metastases but also because the pathological results were different each time. The pathological is adenocarcinoma in the initial treatment and adenosquamous carcinoma in the first recurrence under palliative “colectomy” ( Supplementary Figure 1 Supplementary Figure 2 Supplementary Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 4A–J Figure 4K L Figure 4M–P Figure 4B Figure 4I Figure 4E Figure 4F Figure 4D Figure 4J Figure 4M Figure 4M Figure 4M Figure 4O Figure 4P Supplementary Figure 4A Supplementary Figure 4B Figure 4 Histopathological examination of the patient. ( A–J A B C D E F G H I J K L K M–P N O P Although the patient underwent two major surgeries in a short period of time, her Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG) physical status was 1–2 points when reviewed in January 2025, the patient could walk, and the head and abdominal CT scans showed no abnormalities. Discussion After lung, colon and breast cancer in women, CC has the fourth highest incidence globally, 1 17 18 7 8 19 1 20 20 3 9 10 21 The technique of PE was proposed by Alexander Brunschwig in 1948 as a palliative treatment for CC patients with residual or recurrent disease after radiotherapy. 22 23 7 8 24 25 ICIs offer a new treatment option with an acceptable toxicity profile although the survival benefit is variable, immunotherapy has been applied to CC and has achieved certain results. 9 10 26 10 26 26 NCT 03830866 27 Another study analyzing the role of bevacizumab in CC showed that when included in the treatment regimen, the risk of progression or death was reduced by nearly 40%, 28 NCT04697628 28 28 In our study, a woman diagnosed with cervical adenocarcinoma at stage IIIC1r a year ago was given. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the efficacy was PR. Four years ago, she underwent palliative surgery for intestinal perforation and was diagnosed with a first recurrence of CC (PFS: 28m) and had a clear clinical diagnosis of ASC. Continue to be given Six courses of intravenous chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. Yet the efficacy was evaluated as PR after 4 courses of treatment. Despite continued Immunomaintherapy, enterovaginal leakage still occurred, and abdominal CT indicated pelvic metastasis, so PE was given. Although the diagnosis was flawed, our treatment of this patient represents the latest advances in the treatment of advanced and relapsing CC. 7 8 10 Figure 2C 13 15 16 Although BM of CC are not common, patients with metastatic lesions may present with some identifiable symptom patterns, including elevated intracranial pressure, headache, nausea, vomiting, epileptic seizures and limb weakness. 12 29 30 31 In this study, we report a rare case of multiple metastatic ASC. It is worth noting that when the patient was initially treated, the local cervical lesions were mainly adenocarcinoma, so that it was misdiagnosed as cervical adenocarcinoma, and the pelvic recurrence was mainly squamous carcinoma. However, when brain metastases occur, adenocarcinoma is dominant. The patient had poor response to chemotherapy and immunotherapy after pelvic metastasis, and the efficacy was evaluated as PR, suggesting a poor prognosis. The patient’s quality of life after PE surgery is facing multi-dimensional challenges in terms of physiology, psychology and society, but it is not “impossible to improve”. 25 Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with recurrent and metastatic ASC with brain metastases after PE. In this patient, pelvic metastases combined with enterovaginal leakage threatened the urinary system and important pelvic neurovascular structures. Brain metastases may threaten the life of patients at any time. After MDT, the patient experienced PE and resection of cerebral hemisphere lesions. The patient’s complex medical history presented a number of contraindications for surgical treatment, and efforts by the MDT team ultimately made her a candidate for surgical resection. We hope that our case can provide a reference for the prognosis assessment and treatment of patients with similar manifestations. Finally, this case emphasizes the importance of long-term and close follow-up for patients with CC. Timely detection of metastatic foci and taking active intervention measures may help prolong the survival period of patients and improve their quality of life. More clinical and basic research is needed in the future to further reveal the metastasis mechanism of CC and provide a basis for formulating more effective diagnosis and treatment strategies.
