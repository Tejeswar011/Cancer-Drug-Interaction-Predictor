Introduction There have been a limited number of studies conducted to determine the pattern of relapse and survival in patients after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for esophageal cancer. Aim To evaluate the survival and recurrence patterns in esophageal cancer patients with a pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Material and methods This retrospective study was performed on 159 esophageal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. A checklist of demographic and clinicopathological variables was filled. Then, survival and recurrence patterns in esophageal cancer patients with complete and near complete pathologic responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were evaluated. Results Among 159 of 1117 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 147 patients had a complete pathological response and 12 had a near complete pathological response. In this study variables included age, type of tumor and tumor distance from the incisors, which showed no significant difference, and among them, only sex and addiction were associated with the results. The overall survival and 1 year and 3 years disease-free survival were 59.1 ±2.5%, 89.4 ±2.7%, 62.8 ±5.7% respectively. Conclusions Almost all patients with complete pathological responses had well-differentiated cells and those with near complete responses had moderately differentiated cells; the most common type of recurrence was observed in the systemic type of disease and the most common sites were the lungs and liver. Women and people with no history of addiction showed better responses to treatment and had higher levels of survival. Wprowadzenie Istnieje ograniczona liczba badań nad mechanizmem nawrotów i przeżyciem pacjentów poddanych chemioterapii neoadiuwantowej i leczeniu chirurgicznemu raka przełyku. Cel Ocena przeżycia i mechanizmów nawrotów u chorych na raka przełyku z patologiczną odpowiedzią na chemioterapię neoadiuwantową. Materiał i metody Retrospektywne badanie przeprowadzono u 159 pacjentów z rakiem przełyku leczonych chemioterapią neoadiuwantową. Opracowano listę kontrolną zmiennych demograficznych i kliniczno-patologicznych. Następnie poddano ocenie przeżycie oraz mechanizmy nawrotów u pacjentów z rakiem przełyku z całkowitą i niemal całkowitą odpowiedzią patologiczną na chemioterapię neoadiuwantową. Wyniki Spośród 159 z 1117 pacjentów, którzy spełnili kryteria włączenia, u 147 odnotowano całkowitą, a u 12 niemal całkowitą odpowiedź patologiczną. W przypadku takich analizowanych zmiennych, jak wiek pacjentów, typ guza i jego odległość od siekaczy, nie stwierdzono istotnych różnic. Jedynie płeć pacjenta oraz uzależnienie w wywiadzie wykazywały zależność z uzyskanymi wynikami. Przeżycie całkowite oraz roczne i trzyletnie przeżycie wolne od choroby wyniosły odpowiednio 59,1 ±2,5%, 89,4 ±2,7% oraz 62,8 ±5,7%. Wnioski Stwierdzono, że u prawie wszystkich pacjentów z całkowitą odpowiedzią patologiczną występował wysoki stopień, a u chorych z niemal całkowitą odpowiedzią – umiarkowany stopień zróżnicowania komórek. Najczęstszym rodzajem nawrotu była choroba uogólniona, obejmująca głównie płuca i wątrobę. U kobiet oraz u pacjentów bez uzależnienia w wywiadzie wykazano lepszą odpowiedź na leczenie i dłuższy okres przeżycia. esophageal cancer survival recurrence pattern neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy rak przełyku przeżycie mechanizm nawrotów chemioradioterapia neoadiuwantowa pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Esophageal cancer is one of the most fatal malignancies worldwide. In 2005, about 497,700 new cases of the disease were reported, which will increase about 140% by 2025 [ 1 2 3 4 More than 90% of esophageal cancers include squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma and they are associated with major factors such as histology, geographical location, sex and ethnicity. SCC is the most common in north of China, Turkey and Iran as well as southern states of Russia and other Asian and African countries [ 5 1 4 5 The 5-year survival rate with surgical treatment alone is about 10% to 20% [ 6 7 4 7 1 Many recurrences in esophageal cancer after neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery occur at distant locations from the surgical site. The patient survival period after recurrence, regardless of the type of pathological response, is short. Few patients with a complete pathological response experienced recurrence, and if there was a distant recurrence, it happened later than in patients with incomplete pathological responses [ 8 A few studies have been conducted to determine the recurrence and survival patterns after esophageal cancer treatment with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery [ 7 Aim Our aim was to determine recurrence and survival patterns in patients with complete and near complete pathologic responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in esophageal cancer patients. Material and methods In a retrospective cohort study, patients with esophageal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were evaluated in Imam Reza Hospital and Omid Hospital, two tertiary-care teaching centers, affiliated with Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in 2012–2013. The sampling method was purposive. One hundred eighty-one patients with complete or near complete pathological responses were enrolled in the study. Twenty-two patients were excluded due to lack of hospitalization data, and the 159 remaining patients constituted the study population. All information about age and sex variables, tumor distance from the incisors, tumor location, tumor type, and its gradient were entered in the study checklist. The inclusion criteria for this study were patients with esophageal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and then surgery, had a complete or near complete pathologic response (pathologic complete response: neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy consists of: 1) chemotherapy (60 mg/m 2 2 The term of complete response means: no cancer cell seen in tissue samples removed during surgery or biopsy after treatment. The term of near complete response means: small cancer cell seen in muscle layer in tissue sample removed during surgery. Exclusion criteria were having incomplete files, age below 18, and non-standard doses of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Determination of the sample size was done using the Poisson method so that all eligible individuals in the desired period of time were selected as samples. All data were entered in SPSS (version 16). According to the available records, at least 150 eligible samples were considered sufficient for this study. The description of the data was done using central indicators and dispersion, and tables and statistical charts. Comparison of survival in patients was done by performing survival analysis (overall survival: the length of time from the date of diagnosis of cancer that patients are still alive). At first, the comparison between the groups was done using the chi-square method for quantitative variables and the Mann-Whitney nonparametric test was used for qualitative variables. Then, to determine the overall survival and disease-free survival in the presence of other variables, the Cox proportional risk model was used and the log rank and Kaplan Meier tests were performed for survival analysis. The p In this study, the information in the patient records was used and no intervention was performed for the patients. However, the study was registered at the University Ethics Committee. Information about each patient was recorded using the code assigned to the patient, and access to information was only available to project implementers to provide the most complete safety and patient information protection. This study was conducted on May 20, 2012 at the Faculty/Regional Municipal Organizational Ethics Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences entitled “Determination of Survival Rate and Recurrence Pattern in Patients with Esophageal Cancer with Complete Pathological Response to Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy”, No. 931327, code 8799P. Results The total number of cases reviewed was 1117, of which 159 met the inclusion criteria; 83 (52.2%) were men and 76 (47.8%) were women. The mean age was 58.6 ±20.19 years and most of the studied population (124 people) were Persian (78.0%). All the women who participated were housewives. Among the men 48.2% were framers and 25.3% were laborers. Body mass index was 21.44 ±4.40.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy should also be monitored in patients with squamous cell carcinoma, since it seems to increase the risk of mortality, especially after surgery [ 2 A study assessing the rate and pattern of post-neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy recurrence in patients with esophageal cancers found that a neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimen had a positive effect on the result of the treatment and recurrence pattern. These findings are, however, influenced by the complete pathological response and the complete removal of the micrometastases in the CRT process; analyzing 204 patients, of whom 75 patients underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and 129 patients underwent surgery alone, a pathological response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was observed in 52 (69%) patients, of whom 19 (25%) had complete responses. The 3- and 5-year survival rates in neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy were 53%, 42%, 24% and 18% compared to surgery alone. The disease-free survival and 3- and 5-year overall survival rates in complete response were 79% for all four, while for non-responders they were 26%, 0%, 37% and 28% respectively [ 6 A study reported that although neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy leads to a better pathological response rate compared to chemotherapy, this does not guarantee long-term survival, and chemotherapy alone may be the preferred route of treatment due to its accelerating effect on removal of the tumor and reducing mortality and morbidity during and after surgery and increasing survival in patients with esophageal cancers. Comorbid therapy was performed on 64 patients and chemotherapy was performed on 58 patients, and the complete pathological response was observed in 11 patients with chemoradiotherapy and 2 patients with chemotherapy, and no difference was observed in the recurrence pattern between the two groups. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates in chemoradiotherapy were 76%, 46%, 41%, and in chemotherapy they were 70%, 49%, and 31% respectively [ 7 One study found that esophagogastrectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy may lead to lower mortality. Patients with a complete pathological response showed a higher long-term survival rate compared to those with near complete or relatively complete pathologic responses. However, these researchers have suggested further studies to determine the complete pathological response. In this study, 132 of 162 patients underwent esophagogastrectomy and a complete pathological response was obtained in 42 (26%) patients and a near complete pathological response was obtained in 27 (17%) patients and a relative complete pathological response was obtained in 88 (54%) and 5 (3%) patients were unresectably reported. The overall 5-year survival, the complete pathological response, near complete and relatively complete pathological responses were 34%, 55%, 27%, and 27% respectively [ 8 It was reported in a 2014 study that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with three-incision esophagectomy is a safe method and does not increase post-surgical mortality. The surgical outcomes were compared to 92 patients in the two groups who did not receive the first neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with 114 patients and the second group who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Overall mortality in the first group was 44.7% and in the second group was 55.4%, and the complications of surgery did not show any difference between the two groups [ 10 et al. 11 Some authors conducted a study on the pattern of failure of treatment and recurrence after neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery in patients with esophageal cancers and reported that a small number of patients had trouble in their abdominal para-aortic glands or their lymph nodes in the first recurrence of the disease, and it is unlikely that targeting the lymphatic area with radiotherapy can improve clinical outcomes [ 12 Localized control and disease-free survival and 2-year overall survival in 155 patients in whom the primary location of the tumor was 18% in the upper and middle part of the esophagus, 32% in the lower esophagus and 50% in the esophageal and gastric junction (79% adenocarcinoma and 21% SCC) were 86%, 36% and 48% respectively [ 12 The authors of the study concluded that preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with esophageal cancers reduced locoregional recurrence and peritoneal carcinomatosis, and recurrence occurred only in 5% of patient during radiation. From 422 patients between 2001 and 2008 (of whom 418 were available) and most of them had a histology of adenocarcinoma (75%), 374 patients underwent resection, with 86% undergoing surgery and 92% undergoing chemoradiotherapy and surgery. After a follow-up of at least 24 months, the overall rate of recurrence in surgery was 58% vs. 35%. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy therapy reduced local recurrence from 34% to 14%, and peritoneal carcinomatosis from 14% to 4% [ 13 Some authors in a study conducted a study on 128 patients who randomly underwent surgery alone and 128 others undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and fluorouracil, and then surgery, concluded that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy significantly improved overall survival compared to patients undergoing surgery alone, although their subsequent evaluations showed the positive effects of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in squamous cell carcinoma tumors [ 14 According to Kermani et al 15 et al., 16 In this study, we evaluated total survival and disease-free survival variables in patients with esophageal cancers undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy with complete or near complete pathological responses. Other variables such as age, sex, type of tumor, degree of differentiation, the distances from incisors, tolerance or intolerance of endoscope, BMI, and using drugs were also analyzed. Conclusions Our aim was to evaluate the survival and recurrence patterns in esophageal cancer patients with a pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. In our study, the one-year survival rate was 59.1 ±2.5, 89.4 ±2.71 and the 3-year survival rate was 62.8 ±5.7% reliable competition with other study. However, further studies are needed for more accurate result in decision making. It is noted that overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with a complete pathological response are clearly better than in other groups; the most common recurrences were systemic and occurred in the lungs and the liver, and patient mortality was associated with recurrence of the disease.
