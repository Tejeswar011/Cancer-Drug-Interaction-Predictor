This study systematically evaluated the global burden of low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) among individuals aged 20–65 from 1990 to 2021, utilizing data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database. We analyzed incidence, prevalence, years lived with disability (YLDs), and age-standardized rates across 204 countries and regions, stratified by socio-demographic index (SDI). Key findings indicate a slight decline in LBP metrics but a mild increase in NP trends, with higher growth rates observed in females. Socioeconomic status significantly influenced these patterns, with developed countries showing lower YLDs increasing rate. The study highlights the need for gender-specific and region-tailored public health strategies, particularly focusing on women in lower SDI countries. These findings underscore the importance of targeted interventions to mitigate the growing burden of LBP and NP in an aging workforce increasingly engaged in office work. low back pain neck pain global burden database occupational health BAPC analysis The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Occupational Health and Safety Introduction Neck pain and low back pain are among the most prevalent musculoskeletal disorders in the working-age population worldwide, undermining quality of life and workforce productivity ( 1 2 3 4 5–7 The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework offers standardized, multi-source data to explore such heterogeneity ( 8 9 1 10 11 12 13 14 To bridge this gap, we drew on GBD 2021 data to quantify the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) attributable to neck pain and low back pain among adults aged 20–65 years across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. Unlike prior studies that focus on specific occupational groups or regions, our study provides a global perspective across socioeconomic and gender strata, offering actionable insights for policymakers. Worldwide estimates were disaggregated by SDI quintile, sex, and GBD region; Joinpoint regression detected temporal inflection points; a Bayesian age–period–cohort model projected trends to 2036 ( 15 Therefore, this study aims to systematically quantify the incidence, prevalence, and YLDs of LBP and NP among adults aged 20–65 years across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021, examine temporal trends and SDI-stratified sex differences, and project future burdens to inform occupational-health policy. Methods Research design and data sources This ecological study is based on data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD 2021), which systematically analyzes the prevalence, incidence, and disability burden of low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) among working-age adults (aged 20–65) across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021. The GBD 2021 incorporates epidemiological data from population-based surveys, civil registration systems, hospital records, and published literature, using standardized protocols for data harmonization to ensure comparability across regions ( 16 2 Case definition and data extraction GBD 2021 defines LBP and NP as chronic pain conditions (with a duration of ≥3 months accompanied by functional disability) diagnosed based on symptoms and clinical assessment ( 2 17 Data processing and age standardization The GBD 2021 employs DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to internally validate and correct for biases across heterogeneous data sources. Age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100,000 population were calculated using the GBD 2021 standard population structure, with uncertainty intervals (UIs) generated through 1,000 posterior samples ( 8 This approach ensures robust estimation of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP), providing reliable insights specifically for the working-age demographic across the globe. Statistical analysis The estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) of ASRs from 1990 to 2021 were calculated. Joinpoint regression analyses were performed with the Joinpoint Regression Program (version 4.9.1.0; National Cancer Institute, United States). The maximum number of joinpoints was restricted to five (< 6), permitting up to six linear segments, and the optimal model was selected by Monte-Carlo permutation tests with an overall significance level of p 18 19 1 0 ΔY = ∑ a ( P a , t 1 − P a , t 0 ) r a ¯ + ∑ a P a ¯ ( r a , t 1 − r a , t 0 )  P a , t  r a , t a t To assess socioeconomic disparities in YLDs, the slope inequality index (SII) and concentration index (CI) were calculated. SII represents the absolute difference in YLD rates between the highest and lowest SDI quintiles, while CI measures distribution inequality, with negative values indicating a heavier burden in countries with higher SDI scores. A Bayesian age–period–cohort (BAPC) model with a Poisson likelihood was implemented via the BAPC and INLA packages; age, period and cohort effects were specified as second-order random walks with penalized-complexity priors. Posterior medians and 95% credible intervals were obtained using integrated nested Laplace approximation, and the fitted model was used to project YLD counts and age-standardized rates from 2022 to 2036 ( 20 Software and ethics Data analysis was conducted using R (version 4.3.1) and Stata (version 17.0). The study utilized publicly available de-identified data, thus was exempt from institutional ethics review ( 21 Results Global burden and trends of low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) As of 2021, low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) remain leading causes of disability among individuals aged 20 to 65 globally. In 2021, there were 181.6 million new cases of LBP (age-standardized incidence rate: 4048.17 per 100,000), with 428.5 million prevalent cases (age-standardized prevalence: 9554.2 per 100,000), resulting in 48.84 million years lived with disability (YLDs) (age-standardized YLD rate: 1088.92 per 100,000). On the other hand, NP had 32.56 million new cases (incidence rate: 726.02 per 100,000), with 159 million prevalent cases (prevalence: 3359.13 per 100,000), contributing to 15.91 million YLDs (YLD rate: 354.62 per 100,000). From 1990 to 2021, LBP showed slight decreases in incidence (estimated annual percentage change [EAPC] = −0.05%), prevalence (EAPC = −0.06%), and YLDs (EAPC = −0.06%); conversely, NP experienced minor increases in incidence (EAPC = +0.12%), prevalence (EAPC = + 0.11%), and YLDs (EAPC = +0.18%) ( Tables 1 2 Table 1 Incidence, prevalence, YLDs, and age-standardized YLD rates of working-age low back pain in 2021, with EAPC from 1990 to 2021, globally and by GBD region.

Regarding NP, from 1990 to 2021, there was a slight decrease in incidence, prevalence, and number of YLDs. Similar to NP, LBP exhibited a comparable trend. After age standardization, the overall trend for LBP remained on a decline. However, individuals over 65 showed significantly higher rates of incidence, prevalence, and YLDs for LBP, indicating that after adjusting for population proportions and changes, older adults are more susceptible to LBP ( Figures 1A B Figures 1C D Figure 1 Global proportion of incident cases, prevalent cases, and YLDs (number) for neck pain and low back pain among individuals aged 20–65 (A,B) (C,D) Nine donut charts and six stacked area graphs depict data on low back pain and neck pain across different years and age groups. Charts labeled A show prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for low back pain in 1990 and 2021. Charts labeled B depict the same metrics for neck pain. The graphs labeled C illustrate age-standardized rates for low back pain, while those labeled D show similar data for neck pain from 1990 to 2020. Data is categorized into age groups: 0–20, 20–65, and above 65. Overall, People over 65 have higher incidence rates for both conditions. Individuals aged 20 to 65 account for the majority of LBP and NP cases, and prevention within the working-age population (aged 20–65) is crucial for control the NP and LBP, making this demographic a focal point for subsequent epidemiological analysis. Age-stratified trends in incidence, prevalence, and YLDs Joinpoint regression analysis ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Joinpoint regression analysis of neck pain (NP) and low back pain (LBP) by age group, 1990–2021 (A–F) p The image contains a series of line charts labeled A to F, showing trends in incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for low back pain and neck pain across different age groups. Each panel includes three specific age categories: over sixty-five, twenty to sixty-four, and zero to nineteen. Charts for low back pain (A, C, E) generally show a decline, while those for neck pain (B, D, F) depict more variable trends. Data is categorized by gender: male, female, and overall. All charts span from 1990 to 2019. In contrast, NP incidence rates among individuals aged ≥65 and those aged 20–65 experienced a rapid increase from 1990 to 1995, followed by a sharp decline until 2005, after which they began to rise again. For the 0–20 age group, the incidence remained generally stable, without a noticeable decrease between 1990 and 1995. Trends in NP prevalence and YLDs closely matched those of incidence. This indicates that since 2005, there has been a resurgence in NP cases, which warrants attention from health departments worldwide. Global heatmap of NP and LBP in working age adults We analyzed the global distribution of low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) among the working-age population in countries worldwide for the years 1990 and 2021. In 1990, North America faced more severe LBP issues, while in 2021, certain African countries saw a notable rise in LBP among the working-age population. Regarding neck pain, Africa had significant problems in 1990, whereas in 2021, high levels of NP were observed in parts of the Americas, Australia, and Asia ( Supplementary Figures 1–3 Between 1990 and 2021, the incidence of LBP in the working-age population increased slowly or even decreased in North America and Australia. In contrast, South America, Africa, and parts of Europe experienced a faster increase, making these regions particularly problematic. For neck pain, the global distribution was more dispersed, with some countries in Asia and Africa showing a rapid upward trend ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Heatmap of estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) distribution for incidence, prevalence, and YLDs of neck pain and low back pain among individuals aged 20–65 in 204 countries and regions globally from 1990 to 2021. Global maps showing the distribution of Estimated Annual Percentage Change (EAPC) for low back pain and neck pain. Panels A and B illustrate incidence rates, while C and D display prevalence rates. Panels E and F present Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) for both conditions. Color gradients indicate varying levels of EAPC, with geographic focus areas highlighted in smaller inset maps for regions including the Caribbean, Persian Gulf, Balkan Peninsula, Southeast Asia, Western Asia, Eastern Africa, and Northern Europe. Gender and SDI differences in work-related pain EAPC According to the EAPC (estimated annual percentage change) bar chart analysis across different regions, we observed an increasing trend in the incidence of low back pain (LBP) in middle-income, lower-middle-income, and low-income countries, with this increase predominantly seen in the female population. In contrast, for middle-income and middle-SDI (Socio-demographic Index) countries, there was a slight decrease in LBP incidence among males ( Figures 4A C Figure 4 Average annual percentage change in age-standardized rates of low back pain (A–C) (D–F) Six bar charts show estimated annual percentage changes in age-standardised rates of incidence, prevalence, and Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) across different socio-demographic indexes. Panels A, B, and C (top row) illustrate changes for both sexes combined, females, and males respectively, with mostly negative changes for incidence. Panels D, E, and F (bottom row) show positive changes for global and various socio-demographic indexes, focusing on prevalence and YLDs. Each grouping displays differences by sex and socio-demographic stratification. Regarding neck pain (NP), from a global epidemiological perspective, its incidence is on the rise. The growth rate is slowest in high-SDI countries and relatively higher in low-SDI countries. Notably, across all SDI levels, the growth rate of NP incidence in females is faster than in males. In fact, in high-SDI countries, the growth rate for males is negative ( Figures 4D F Population dynamics, aging effects, and epidemiological factors Trend decomposition analysis has shed light on the multiple factors contributing to the growth of low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP). For LBP, population growth and aging have positively contributed to the increase in the global number of cases, with demographic factors being the primary driving force while epidemiological factors have somewhat mitigated this growth. Middle SDI countries have made the largest contribution to the global increase in LBP ( Figure 5A Figure 5B Figure 5 Trend decomposition analysis of Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) for neck pain and low back pain among individuals aged 20–65 from 1990 to 2021. YLDs, years lived with disability. The x-axis shows the absolute contribution to the change in total YLDs (in years) from 1990 to 2021. Four bar charts show changes in years lived with disability (YLDs) from 1990 to 2021. Chart A compares changes by socio-demographic index (SDI), chart B by gender, chart C by SDI focusing on gains, and chart D by gender focusing on gains. Each chart breaks down changes by aging (blue), epidemiological change (orange), and population growth (yellow). Black dots indicate net change. Regarding NP, demographic factors are similarly the main driver pushing the global increase in case numbers, followed by aging factors. Similar to LBP, the impact of epidemiological factors on global changes in NP is relatively minor ( Figure 5C Figure 5D Health inequality and future projections Inequality index analysis reveals that as the socioeconomic level of a country improves, the incidence of low back pain (LBP) shows an increasing trend, indicating a close association between higher socioeconomic status and worse health outcomes in LBP. However, the trend for neck pain (NP) is more complex, and its relationship with the SDI is not significant ( Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 6 Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Concentration Index (CI) for years lived with disability (YLDs) due to low back pain (A,B) (C,D) Panel A shows a scatter plot of crude YLD rates by SDI rank, comparing 1990 and 2021, with a positive trend line. Panel B displays a concentration curve of YLDs, showing indices for 1990 and 2021. Panel C presents a similar scatter plot with a lower YLD rate range. Panel D illustrates a concentration curve with minimal change in concentration index from 1990 to 2021. Size of points represents population. Figure 7 Predictions of Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) for low back pain (A) (B) Graph A displays projected Bayesian Age–Period–Cohort (BAPC) YLDs rates for low back pain from 1990 to 2030. Rates start around 1200 per 100,000, decreasing slightly before diverging in projections post-2020. Graph B shows similar projections for neck pain, with rates starting near 350 per 100,000, fluctuating minimally before diverging after 2020. Both graphs feature shaded regions indicating increasing uncertainty over time. Discussion Our study systematically evaluated the global burden of low back pain (LBP) and neck pain (NP) among working-age adults (aged 20 to 65) from 1990 to 2021. It revealed significant disparities in these health issues across regions, genders, and socioeconomic strata, highlighting the increasing burden and inequality driven by population aging. Over the past three decades, while the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for low back pain (LBP) have shown a slight decline among the global working-age population (aged 20 to 65), the corresponding metrics for neck pain (NP) have exhibited a mild upward trend ( 1 22 23 24 25 26 27 Reducing the burden of LBP and NP calls for interventions that reflect gender, regional, and socioeconomic realities. Policymakers can focus on three linked actions: (i) set low-cost ergonomic standards that workplaces can adopt even in low-SDI areas; (ii) widen subsidies for basic pain-management services so cost does not add to existing inequalities; and (iii) add gender-sensitive measures to national musculoskeletal-health programs to address the higher burden in women. At the same time, global and national health bodies should improve surveillance, paying close attention to women and to the needs of low- and middle-income countries. Tailoring efforts to local context and gender differences will make public-health strategies more effective and help ease the worldwide burden of LBP and NP. While this study utilized the standard methods of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD), several limitations should be noted. First, in low SDI regions, particularly where diagnostic infrastructure is limited, the burden of neck pain (NP) may be underestimated ( 28 29 8 Our study has several limitations. First, the observed “higher burden in high-SDI settings” may partly reflect systematic underestimation in low-SDI countries due to incomplete primary care and surveillance (limited diagnostic access, insufficient pain assessment and follow-up, underreporting), introducing measurement bias in cross-SDI comparisons. Second, we relied on country–year aggregates from the GBD and conducted analyses at the global and SDI-stratified levels rather than at individual country or subnational levels, which limits our ability to capture within-group heterogeneity related to climate zones, health-system capacity, and occupational structure. Third, BAPC projections are not well suited to detecting structural breaks caused by policy changes, shifts in diagnostic criteria, or disruptive events (e.g., pandemics, economic shocks, rapid diffusion of digital health), and any systematic error in the inputs can propagate into the forecasts. Prospective, population-based cohort studies on LBP and NP remain scarce—most available evidence is cross-sectional or limited to single occupations ( 30 31 Conclusion Our findings show that, although global YLDs from low-back and neck pain have declined slightly, the burden continues to rise among women and in low-income countries. This disparity highlights the pivotal role of socioeconomic and gender factors in musculoskeletal health. Policymaking should therefore priorities these high-burden groups, emphasize low-cost ergonomic solutions and protections for female workers, and embed equity-focused principles into occupational-health planning to curb further increases in LBP and NP.  1 https://ec.europsa.eu/eurostat/  2 https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2021 Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary material Ethics statement Ethical approval was not required for the study involving humans in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.
