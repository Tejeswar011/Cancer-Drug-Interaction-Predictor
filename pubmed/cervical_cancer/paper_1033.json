The patient presented after 3 days of severe hiccups associated with vomiting and oral intake intolerance. SIADH was diagnosed by hyponatremia (initial 128 millimoles/liter (mmol/L), nadir 119 mmol/L; normal range 136–146 mmol/L) and urine studies; this was initially attributed to sertraline, but a 48‐h medication hold did not improve sodium and caused withdrawal. An upper gastrointestinal (GI) study demonstrated mesenteroaxial gastric malrotation with hiatal hernia; these were non‐operative. Hyponatremia was corrected with 3% sodium, fluid restriction, and urea; hiccups continued despite sodium correction to 138 mmol/L. Various treatments of hiccups including chlorpromazine, gabapentin, baclofen, metoclopramide, and antacids were trialed, but ultimately hiccups persisted for 11 days. Hiccups ceased following IV lorazepam administration, and sodium normalized thereafter. The patient was eventually able to discontinue all hyponatremia interventions post‐discharge with continued normal sodium (138–142 mmol/L) upon 2 months of follow‐up, and hiccups have remained in remission. Although other case reports have described hyponatremia causing hiccups whereby correcting the hyponatremia treated the hiccups, this is the first case demonstrating the reverse causal relationship. The anatomic findings of unusual GI anatomy (mesenteroaxial gastric malrotation with hiatal hernia) were assessed to be potential contributing factors to the refractory hiccups. The case also highlights the need to avoid anchoring to other common causes of SIADH, and supports a trial of lorazepam in refractory, severe hiccups.  case report hiccups hyponatremia SIADH pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  L. Matlen Case of Severe Hiccups Causing SIADH Clinical Case Reports 13 10 2025 e71048 10.1002/ccr3.71048  Funding:  Summary  Severe hiccups can induce the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, and intravenous lorazepam may be effective in refractory cases. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should not be discontinued if the temporal association with hyponatremia is inconsistent. 1 Introduction Hiccups are caused by myoclonic contractions of the diaphragm, comprised of a reflex arc which includes the phrenic and vagus nerves. Hiccups lasting > 48 h may indicate underlying pathology, with the most common etiologies being structural, vascular, and inflammatory, although the differential is broad. Some structural etiologies include those affecting the phrenic or vagus nerve, gastric irritants, and the medulla (demyelinating disease including neuromyelitis optica, vascular) [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 Case History/Examination The patient is a 36‐year‐old with anxiety, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, vasovagal syncope, and previously untreated gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) who presented with 48 h of spontaneous onset, severe, persistent hiccups causing significant discomfort and associated with nausea, vomiting, and intolerance of oral intake. Hiccups were described as clusters of five to seven repetitive, forceful diaphragmatic contractions occurring every 5–10 s, and these persisted during sleep. There were occasional periods of 1–3 h of quiescence approximately once per 24 h. The patient was alert and oriented, although uncomfortable, with frequent, loud hiccups, and had an otherwise unremarkable neurologic exam and a non‐tender abdomen. 3 Differential Diagnosis, Investigations, and Treatment The patient was assessed upon initial presentation for suspected dehydration and provided a 1‐L bolus of lactated ringers (LR). Basic laboratory testing revealed hypokalemia (K + + − 5 6 4 Summary of Investigations An electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest X‐ray (CXR) were normal. Head computed tomography (CT) and later brain MRI + cervical spine MRI were unremarkable. CT neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a mild–moderate hiatal hernia, gaseous distension of the stomach and transverse colon, and elevated left hemi‐diaphragm. An upper gastrointestinal showed mesenteroaxial gastric malrotation “findings may be congenital in nature,” and no evidence of bowel obstruction. Sodium levels were trended starting hospital admission and through 2 months of follow‐up. The initial sodium was 128 mmol/L; nadir was 119 mmol/L at 36 h. The sodium corrected to normal for a period of time by symptom day #7 and persistently by symptom day #11 (Figure 1 1 FIGURE 1 Sodium trends. TABLE 1 Initial laboratory studies.

This was followed by seven additional days of fluid‐restriction, salt tabs, and eventually urea, after which sodium normalized (with variability) to 138 mmol/L by symptom day #7 and ranged 138–142 mmol/L after discharge and by 2‐month follow‐up. There was some fluctuation of sodium values in the latter portion of the hospitalization despite stable urea and fluid restriction while the patient remained hiccupping, but values stabilized after hiccups stopped. The patient stopped salt tabs upon switching to urea and stopped fluid restriction at discharge. Urea was continued prophylactically until 2‐month follow‐up; after cessation at that time, sodium remained normal. Sertraline was considered as a possible cause of SIADH, but this factor was ruled out after resuming sertraline within 48 h of cessation, without negative effect on the sodium. Treatment with chlorpromazine was not tolerated, nor was the effect sustained throughout the drug's duration of action. The altered mental status correlated with both hyponatremia and chlorpromazine but was ultimately attributed to chlorpromazine because this resolved 24 h after the dose. Further, mental status normalized when the sodium was at its nadir (119 mmol/L). Gabapentin (up to 400 mg three times per day (TID)), baclofen (up to 10 mg TID), metoclopramide (up to 15 mg TID), omeprazole (up to 40 mg two times per day (BID)), and famotidine (up to 20 mg BID) were added simultaneously, and thus it is not possible to separate the efficacy of an individual component; hiccups lessened in intensity but remained as frequent as onset throughout the hospitalization. Vomiting had improved significantly during the hospitalization and ceased by the sixth day of symptoms. Administration of 1 mg IV lorazepam on symptom day #11 (hospital day #9) was correlated with the resolution of hiccups and the patient was discharged the following day. Stomach malrotation, hiatal hernia, and GERD were likely risk factors for hiccups but were assessed by the surgeon to be non‐operative. The patient was discharged on indefinite gabapentin, baclofen, omeprazole, famotidine, home sertraline, and brief metoclopramide, and continued urea until 2 months after discharge, with continued suppression of hiccups and normalized sodium. 6 Discussion In the presenting case and in contrast to other case reports [ 2 3 4 2 FIGURE 2 Timeline of hiccups, sodium, and treatments. The reflex arc for hiccups involves afferents from the phrenic, vagus, and sympathetic nerves to the upper spinal cord and medulla, reticular formation, and hypothalamus—centrally mediated by dopaminergic and GABA‐ergic (gamma‐aminobutyric acid) neurotransmitters. The efferent branch is composed of the phrenic nerve, in addition to the accessory nerve to intercostal muscles, with subsequent glottic closure by the recurrent laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve [ 1 7 Many medications used in the treatment of hiccups affect the GABA pathway, not limited to gabapentin and baclofen [ 8 8 1 Limitations are several. In this patient, the initial etiology of hiccups remains unknown but is suspected to be multifactorial, such as related to the patient's abnormal stomach anatomy, untreated GERD, or other undetermined factors; a firm cause was not determined, and the patient seems to remain at risk for future recurrence. It is possible there may have been a bi‐directional relationship between hyponatremia perpetuating hiccups. Another significant limitation is the role of polypharmacy in treating the hiccups; the patient has started and uptitrated several traditional hiccup medications, and thus the independent role of lorazepam is not completely certain. It is important not to anchor to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as the cause of SIADH when there is data to the contrary. The patient's hyponatremia was acute, but the sertraline was a long‐term medication at a stable dose since 1 year prior. The patient developed significant withdrawal when the medication was held. The patient had described their experience with sertraline as “life changing” in the care of underlying mental health comorbidities and quality of life, and for this reason, the medication was re‐instated despite some etiologic uncertainty at the time of SIADH diagnosis. Although rare, it is important to recognize the relationship between persistent hiccups and SIADH; while other case reports have cited hyponatremia (including SIADH) as a cause of hiccups, this case seems to demonstrate the reverse causal relationship. In the case of sudden onset refractory hiccups, consideration may be given to a trial of IV lorazepam, which successfully and completely terminated this patient's severe hiccups.
