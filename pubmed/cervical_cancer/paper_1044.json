There are only a few case reports of chondrosarcoma in the temporomandibular joint region. This report describes two cases of chondrosarcoma of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in a 27-year-old man and a 35-year-old woman. In both cases signs of temporal bone resorption were noticed, and in the first case tumor had intracranial spread. In both cases the tumor was resected in a single block with peritumoral tissues. The aim of this paper is to emphasize the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulty in this pathology.
