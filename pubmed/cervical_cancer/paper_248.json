Background Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) frequently presents with lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM), a critical determinant of postoperative recurrence. While surgery remains the cornerstone of MTC treatment, the indications for lateral lymph node dissection (LLND) remain contentious. This study aimed to develop and validate a predictive nomogram for assessing LLNM risk in patients with MTC. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 87 treatment-naïve MTC patients who underwent primary surgical resection at our institution. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for LLNM. A nomogram was constructed and internally validated, with its clinical utility evaluated through discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analyses. Results Univariate analysis identified multifocality, intrathyroidal lymphovascular invasion (IT-LVI), extrathyroidal extension (ETE), central lymph node metastasis (CLNM), maximum tumor diameter (MTD), serum calcitonin (Ctn), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as significantly associated with LLNM (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed ETE (OR = 14.37; 95% CI: 2.11–100.24; P = 0.007), CLNM (OR = 4.97; 95% CI: 1.06–23.26; P = 0.042), and natural log-transformed Ctn (Ln_Ctn) (OR = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.49–4.99; P<0.001) as independent predictors. The resulting nomogram demonstrated excellent discriminative ability (AUC = 0.941), good calibration, and strong clinical utility. Conclusion We developed a novel nomogram incorporating ETE, CLNM, and Ln_Ctn to accurately estimate LLNM probability in MTC patients. This predictive model significantly improves risk stratification, provides valuable guidance for surgical decision-making regarding LLND, and supports personalized surgical planning. medullary thyroid carcinoma lateral lymph node dissection lateral lymph node metastasis nomogram risk stratification The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Incomplete lymphadenectomy increases recurrence risk, while overtreatment elevates complications such as recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and permanent hypoparathyroidism ( 12 13 Despite ongoing research into MTC’s molecular characteristics and the emergence of targeted therapies, surgical resection remains the primary curative approach. Yet, international consensus on LLNM predictors is lacking. A meta-analysis of 26 studies found significant heterogeneity in reported risk factors for LLNM, highlighting the need for more consistent and validated tools ( 14 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Patients and data collection This retrospective study included 87 consecutive patients with pathologically confirmed MTC who underwent initial thyroid surgery at Ningbo No. 2 Hospital between 2016 and 2024. All enrolled MTC patients underwent central and lateral lymph node dissection (LND). Therapeutic LND was performed for patients with radiologically or cytologically confirmed nodal metastasis, while prophylactic LND was conducted for those without preoperative evidence of metastasis. Notably, both approaches followed identical anatomical dissection boundaries. The study aimed to analyze clinical and pathological features to assess risk factors for LLNM. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) histopathological confirmation of MTC after surgery; (2) complete preoperative clinical and laboratory data; (3) availability of thyroid color Doppler ultrasound (US) and neck computed tomography (CT) imaging; (4) No prior treatment for thyroid malignancy; (5) underwent total thyroidectomy. Clinical data were extracted from the hospital’s electronic medical record system and the Ningbo Resident Health Big Data Platform. Collected variables included: (1) demographic and clinical characteristics (preoperative assessment): gender, age, body mass index (BMI); (2) tumor-related features: maximum tumor diameter (MTD, preoperative imaging by US/CT), extrathyroidal extension (ETE, preoperative imaging by US/CT); (3) Serological markers (preoperative laboratory testing): serum Ctn, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA); (4) Pathological findings (postoperative histopathology): intrathyroidal lymphovascular invasion (IT-LVI), CLNM, and LLNM. 2.2 Construction and validation of the prediction model Risk factors associated with LLNM were first screened through univariate logistic regression analysis. Variables with statistical significance were then included in multivariate logistic regression models to identify independent predictors, adjusting for potential confounding factors. Based on the multivariate results, a predictive nomogram was constructed to estimate the probability of LLNM. Internal validation was performed using 1,000 bootstrap resamples. Calibration of the model was assessed via calibration plots. Discrimination was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Clinical utility was assessed through decision curve analysis (DCA), which estimated net benefit across a range of threshold probabilities. 2.3 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS version 27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R version 4.4.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Univariate analyses employed: χ² tests for categorical variables; independent t-tests for normally-distributed continuous variables; and Mann-Whitney U tests for non-normally distributed variables. Variables demonstrating statistical significance (P<0.05) in univariate analysis were entered into multivariate logistic regression models, with outcomes reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A two-sided P-value <0.05 defined statistical significance. Forest plots and ROC curves were generated using GraphPad Prism version 10.1.2 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Nomogram construction, waterfall plots, calibration plots, and DCA were all performed in R, with internal validation conducted through 1,000 bootstrap replicates. To evaluate predictive performance, we conducted ROC curve analysis using DeLong’s method to calculate the AUC with its 95% confidence interval. The optimal cutoff was determined by maximizing Youden’s index (sensitivity + specificity - 1), with the corresponding sensitivity and specificity values reported. For the nomogram, no single optimal cutoff exists; instead, we used the 50% predicted probability and its corresponding score as a clinical reference point. Additionally, model calibration was assessed using the Brier score, while clinical utility was evaluated through decision curve analysis (DCA). 3 Results This retrospective analysis included 87 consecutive patients with MTC, among whom 27 (31.0%) had pathologically confirmed LLNM. 3.1 Analysis of risk factors for LLNM To identify risk factors associated with LLNM, patients were categorized into LLNM-positive (n = 27) and LLNM-negative (n = 60) groups. Univariate analysis revealed that multifocality (P = 0.004), IT-LVI (P < 0.001), ETE (P < 0.001), CLNM (P < 0.001), MTD (P < 0.001), Ctn (P < 0.001), and CEA (P < 0.001) were significantly associated with LLNM (  Table 1  Figure 1 Table 1 Univariate analysis of the clinical and pathological factors associated with LLNM.

The plot includes confidence intervals along a logarithmic scale. 3.2 Development and validation of the predictive nomogram Based on the independent predictors identified in the multivariate analysis, a nomogram was developed to estimate the probability of LLNM in MTC patients (  Figure 2 Figure 2 Nomogram for predicting the risk of LLNM in MTC. Nomogram featuring scales labeled Points, Ln_Ctn, ETE, CLNM, Total Points, and Probability. Each scale has numbered divisions. Probability ranges from 0.05 to 0.95. Total Points range from 0 to 160. The nomogram’s discriminative ability was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The model demonstrated excellent performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.941 (95% CI: 0.881–1.000), yielding a sensitivity of 81.5% and specificity of 96.7% (  Figure 3  Figure 4 Figure 3 ROC curves comparing the predictive performance of the nomogram versus three independent risk factors.

Despite its low incidence, MTC demonstrates a marked propensity for early cervical lymph node metastasis, leading many clinicians to recommend extensive surgical resection including total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection and often lateral compartment clearance. While achieving optimal locoregional control, such comprehensive resections carry significant morbidity risks: recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (voice impairment), permanent hypoparathyroidism (chronic hypocalcemia), and cervical sensory disturbances — all substantially impacting quality of life. Importantly, since MTC metastases lack radioiodine avidity, complete surgical excision constitutes the sole potentially curative approach for metastatic disease ( 15 16 In this study, we identified ETE, CLNM, and serum Ctn levels as independent predictors of LLNM. These findings are consistent with previous literature ( 17 20 21 24 Ctn, synthesized from procalcitonin, remains the most sensitive biochemical marker for MTC diagnosis ( 25 26 27 28 29 1 8 30 10 31 33 ETE was a particularly strong predictor of LLNM in our model. ETE reflects advanced local invasiveness, indicating tumor penetration through the thyroid capsule - a critical anatomical barrier against metastatic spread. Scopsi et al.’s retrospective cohort study of MTC patients established ETE as a significant prognostic factor for both locoregional recurrence and poor clinical outcomes ( 34 14 35 CLNM serves as a crucial bridge in the metastatic progression of thyroid carcinoma to lateral neck compartments. Although skip metastases (defined as lateral compartment nodal involvement without CLNM) observed in a subset of thyroid carcinoma patients, most metastases progress centrifugally from central to lateral compartments following anatomical lymphatic drainage pathways ( 36 37 38 39 Nomograms offer an intuitive and individualized approach to risk prediction, particularly in oncology, where complex and heterogeneous variables interact ( 40 The proposed risk-stratified surgical approach — where patients with higher nomogram scores might benefit from lateral neck dissection while those with lower scores could potentially undergo central compartment dissection alone — represents a hypothesis-generating framework rather than definitive clinical guidance. This tool may eventually help balance oncologic control against surgical morbidity, but its current value lies primarily in highlighting the need for better preoperative risk stratification in MTC management. Importantly, several limitations warrant consideration: (1) potential referral bias at our tertiary center, (2) variability in preoperative imaging interpretation, (3) absence of molecular or radiomic markers in the current model, and (4) lack of external validation. Future multicenter studies with standardized imaging protocols and incorporation of emerging biomarkers are needed to validate these preliminary findings before clinical implementation. 5 Conclusion This study identified ETE, CLNM, and serum Ctn levels as independent predictors of LLNM in patients with MTC. Based on these variables, we developed a novel nomogram that demonstrated high discriminative accuracy and clinical utility. By enabling personalized risk stratification, this tool may support more precise surgical decision-making — maximizing oncologic control while minimizing unnecessary morbidity. Prospective multicenter validation is warranted to confirm its generalizability and facilitate its integration into clinical practice.
