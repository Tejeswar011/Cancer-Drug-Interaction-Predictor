Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) are essential for epithelial renewal and barrier maintenance, yet chemotherapy impairs ISC proliferation and function, delaying mucosal repair. We hypothesized that Wumei Pills (WMP) could protect against chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis by modulating gut microbiota - particularly Lactobacillus reuteri L. reuteri AIM To characterize these changes and the safety of WMP via METHODS In this study, we established a 5-FU induced intestinal mucositis mouse model, to explore the protective effect of WMP regulating L. reuteri RESULTS We found that intestinal flora is an important mechanism causing chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis, but WMP and live L. reuteri L. reuteri L. reuteri L. reuteri L. reuteri CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that WMP regulating L. reuteri L. reuteri Wumei Pills Lactobacillus reuteri Intestinal stem cells Leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 Wingless-type/β-catenin pathway pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes  Core Tip: Lactobacillus reuteri Lactobacillus reuteri INTRODUCTION Continuously exposed to gut microbiota, the intestinal barrier is vital for mucosal homeostasis. This stability relies on effective defense mechanisms against chemical and microbial threats[ 1 2 3 4 5 Chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis (CIM) is a common adverse reaction in the course of anti-tumor therapy, characterized by disruption of intestinal environmental homeostasis such as flora disturbance and intestinal mucosal barrier integrity impairment. Some scholars suggested that the key to maintaining intestinal barrier homeostasis was ISCs proliferation and differentiation[ 6 7 8 9 10 Lactobacillus rhamnosus 11 Lactobacillus plantarum 12 . “Regulating, is harmonizing” is an important rule of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to adjust yin-yang and maintain the homeostasis. Our research group clinically prescribed Wumei Pills (WMP), a classic prescription for co-treatment of cold and heat, for the treatment of 50 patients with chemotherapeutic intestinal catarrhal diarrhea, and found that WMP can significantly reduce the incidence of CIM diarrhea and reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines and intestinal mucosal barrier related factors, with a total effective rate of 88%[ 13 14 Lactobacillus Lactobacillus reuteri L. reuteri  L. reuteri 15 16 14 L. reuteri L. reuteri via L. reuteri L. reuteri In this study, we detected the protective effects of WMP and L. reuteri L. reuteri L. reuteri MATERIALS AND METHODS Animals and bacteria strains C57BL/6 mice (4 weeks old, male, 18 ± 2 g, specific pathogen-free) were purchased from Weitong Lihua Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. [Production license: SYXK(Su) 2023-0077, China]. Mice were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions (12 hours light/12 hours dark cycle, 45%-55% relative humidity, and temperature of 26-28 °C) with free access to food and clean water. The study protocols were approved by the Animal Experimental Ethics Committee of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (Approval No. 202409A097) and carried out on the basis of the animal ethics standards of the Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee. The animal certificate number is 20170005027187. All reasonable efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. The L. reuteri 8 Materials WMP (Wu Mei: 24 g, Xi Xin: 9 g, Dang Gui: 6 g, Fu Zi: 9 g, Hua Jiao: 6 g, Huang Bo: 9 g, Gui Zhi: 9 g, Huang Lian: 24 g, Ren Shen: 15 g, and Gan Jiang: 15 g) was purchased from the Chinese Pharmacy of Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Nanjing, China). 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was obtained from Shanghai Yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd. (CAS: 51-21-8, Shanghai, China). Vancomycin hydrochloride (1 g, CAS: 1404-93-9), metronidazole (25 g, CAS: 1404-93-9), neomyein sulfate (10 g, CAS: 1405-10-3) and ampicillin, sodium salt (1 g, CAS: 69-52-3) were obtained from Solarbio (Beijing, China). Antibiotic mixture (ABX) solution: Suspension with 0.5 g/L vancomycin hydrochloride, 1.0 g/L ampicillin, 1.0 g/L neomyein sulfate and 1.0 g/L metronidazole concentrations prepared with ultra-pure water. Mouse experiments After 7 days of adaptive feeding, the C57BL/6 mice were divided randomly into 7 groups ( n 14 14 L. reuteri 8 L. reuteri L. reuteri th via 1 Figure 1  The flow chart of mouse experiment. L. reuteri Lactobacillus reuteri Assessment of mucositis and sample collection Indicators of disease severity, including body weight, food intake, and diarrhea severity, were evaluated daily for the assessment of mucositis. Diarrhea severity was classified into five grades according to stool consistency: (1) 0: Normal; (2) 1: Slightly wet; (3) 2: Moderate wet; (4) 3: Loose; and (5) 4: Watery stool[ 17 Cytokines and lipopolysaccharides detection The serum supernatants were stored at -20 °C until use for cytokine analysis. Cytokine analysis was performed on thawed samples with interleukin (IL)-1β, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α ELISA kits (Nanjing Lapuda Biotechnology Co., Ltd, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

The intestinal mucosal injury and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed under light microscope. The histopathological score was calculated based on previous studies[ 18 Intestinal permeability The toxic effects of chemotherapy may weaken the intestinal epithelial barrier, allowing the contents of the lumen to enter the bloodstream through the paracellular space. The animals began fasting at 9 pm. on the first day and were denied water for 12 hours. On day 2, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (50 mg/mL) was administered orally according to the animal’s body weight (0.1 mL/10 g). After 3 hours, blood was removed from the orbit and serum was isolated. Serum fluorescence (480 nm excitation wavelength, 520 nm emission wavelength) was measured by enzyme-labeler, and FITC-glucan standard was used to prepare the standard curve of FITC leakage in serum. Immunofluorescence assay The jejunum sections measuring 2 cm in length were collected from different groups of mice and fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then embedded in the optimal cutting temperature compound. Jejunum slices were permeated and incubated overnight with anti-mouse proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody (1:50, Abcam, United Kingdom). ISC staining, tissue sections were fixed with paraformaldehyde for 1 hour, infiltrated with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes, and incubated in 5% BSA for 2 hours. It was then incubated overnight with the primary antibody (anti-rabbit Lgr5 antibody, 1:100, Abcam, United Kingdom) at 4 °C. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes with goat anti-rabbit antibodies coupled with Alexa Fluor 594 (1:250, Abcam, United Kingdom) or Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200, Abcam, United Kingdom). Fluorescence images were collected for further qualitative and quantitative analysis. Immunohistochemistry assay The paraffin sections were dewaxed with xylene and absolute ethanol, washed with PBS (pH = 7.4), and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin. Then, the paraffin sections were incubated with an anti-Wnt3 antibody (1:100), anti-β-catenin antibody (1:100) overnight at -4 °C and incubated with an anti-rabbit secondary antibody the next day. The slides were stained with 3,3-diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. The sections were observed with a light microscope. Statistical analysis Results are expressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance, defined as P t RESULTS ISC maintenance and function critically depend on the gut microbiota First, to determine the role of intestinal microbiota in ISC regulation, we kept 5-FU mice in PGF conditions with ABX solution for 5 consecutive days. Compared with the 5-FU group, we observed that PGF mice had less diarrhea, less intestinal permeability and less reduction in the number of crypt depth (CD) and more increase in the number of villus height (VH). The H&E staining fragment showed that 5-FU caused intestinal epithelial injury of varying degrees. The epithelial injury of jejunal tissue is the most obvious. No histological abnormalities were observed in the control group, while obvious histological changes occurred in the model mice, including inflammatory cell infiltration, large ulcers, glandular atrophy, and shortening of jejunal epithelial villi. The injury of the colonic mucosa was relatively mild, manifested as a small amount of inflammatory cell infiltration and villi shortening. The ELISA results showed that the expression of inflammatory cytokines, especially LPS increased. However, it was not obvious in PGF mice, suggesting that intestinal flora played an important role in maintaining the repair and function of ISCs (Figures 2 3A 3B Figure 2  Effects of Wumei Pills and Lactobacillus reuteri a P vs b P vs c P vs d P vs e P vs L. reuteri Lactobacillus reuteri Figure 3  Effect of Wumei Pills and Lactobacillus reuteri Lactobacillus reuteri L. reuteri L. reuteri L. reuteri a P c P L. reuteri Lactobacillus reuteri Confirmation of the protective effect of WMP and L. reuteri against CIM in mice Then, to verify colonization of L. reuteri 8 L. reuteri L. reuteri 3C L. reuteri L. reuteri L. reuteri 2G 3A 3B L. reuteri L. reuteri 2A B L. reuteri WMP and L. reuteri attenuates intestinal epithelial damage in CIM mice To assess the impact of WMP and L. reuteri 4 P L. reuteri L. reuteri Figure 4  Concentration of dextran measured by mean fluorescence intensity of fluorescein isothiocyanate in serum. c P L. reuteri Lactobacillus reuteri WMP and L. reuteri attenuates intestinal epithelial damage in CIM mice by promoting epithelial cell proliferation Cell proliferation and apoptosis promote intestinal epithelial cell renewal, maintaining epithelial barrier integrity.

Originating from the Treatise on Exogenous Febrile Disease, WMP comprises ten herbs: Wu Mei, Dang Gui, Xi Xin, Gui Zhi, Fu Zi, Huang Bo, Hua Jiao, Ren Shen, Gan Jiang, and Huang Lian. Master of TCM Zhong-Ying Zhou and our previous clinical studies both demonstrated the efficacy of WMP in treating chemotherapy-induced diarrhea/mucositis[ 13 19 L. reuteri 14 Lactobacillus 20 21 L. reuteri 22 23 24 L. reuteri L. reuteri VH and CD are key indicators to evaluate the absorption effect of nutrients in small intestine[ 23 24 25 L. reuteri L. reuteri L. reuteri L. reuteri Intestinal barrier is an important defense mechanism that maintains intestinal homeostasis by preventing pathogens, toxins and antigens from entering mucosal tissues[ 26 27 14 L. reuteri L. reuteri The production of diverse epithelial cells by ISCs is indispensable for sustaining the intestinal epithelial barrier.
