However, its intracellular redox behavior is known to vary depending on both concentration and oxidative context.

Introduction Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) is a water-soluble analog of vitamin E (α-tocopherol), the most biologically active and abundant form of tocopherol in humans. Figure 1 While α-tocopherol is a major lipid-soluble antioxidant in biological membranes, neutralizing lipid peroxyl radicals and inhibiting peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids [ 1 2 3 This enhanced solubility facilitates its use in aqueous biological systems, where α-tocopherol is less effective, and has led to its widespread use as a reference antioxidant in various a-cellular assays (e.g., ABTS, ORAC, FRAP) [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 In lipid environments, however, its reactivity is more limited, primarily relying on hydrogen atom transfer and adduct formation mechanisms. Radical scavenging of species like ˙OCH 3 2 8 Figure 1 9 Trolox has demonstrated a range of beneficial cellular effects, often surpassing α-tocopherol in protective efficacy in various cell types, including human myocytes, hepatocytes, and erythrocytes [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 Despite its widely recognized antioxidant properties, Trolox can also exhibit prooxidant activity under specific conditions, particularly in the presence of transition metals or when cellular antioxidant systems are depleted. In such environments, Trolox may participate in redox cycling and metal chelation, promoting ROS generation rather than scavenging [ 16 17 18 2 3 18 Our previous study [ 3 In the present study, we build upon our previous findings by examining the intracellular antioxidant and prooxidant effects of Trolox in two cellular models, HeLa cells and 3T3 cells, exposed to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 2 2 Hydrogen peroxide was selected due to its role as a physiological prooxidant, since it is naturally produced by enzymes such as NADPH oxidases [ 19 20 2 2 19 21 2 2 22 2 2 23 24 25 26 27 28 For this study, we selected 3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells as complementary models to investigate the antioxidant and prooxidant activity of Trolox. 3T3 cells, derived from non-transformed mouse fibroblasts, represent a healthy, low-ROS environment ideal for assessing Trolox’s antioxidant effects under physiological conditions [ 29 In contrast, HeLa cells, originating from human cervical cancer, are known for their high basal oxidative stress [ 30 3 The approach in this study based on two cell types enables a comparative analysis of Trolox’s redox behavior in normal versus cancer-like cellular contexts. By extending the investigation to stress conditions and shorter exposure times, this study wants to provide new insights into the dynamic antioxidant/prooxidant role of Trolox within a biologically relevant timeframe and context. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically and comparatively evaluate the concentration-dependent switch in Trolox activity under acute oxidative stress conditions using a short-term exposure model. By integrating two complementary cell lines and physiologically relevant H 2 2 2. Results 2.1. Effect of TROLOX on Intracellular Basal ROS Production in Hela Cells and 3T3 Cells After 1 h Incubation It is known that 3T3 fibroblasts represent a low-ROS cellular model, whereas HeLa cells are characterized by high basal oxidative stress [ 29 30 4 ® 2 Figure S1 To assess the effect of TROLOX on intracellular basal ROS production in Hela cells and 3T3 cells under short-term exposure conditions, both HeLa cells and 3T3 cells were treated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of Trolox (2–160 µM) and subsequently loaded with the cell-permeable, ROS-sensitive probe CM-H 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 2 Figure 2 2.2. H 2 2 In order to preliminarily set up intracellular prooxidant conditions in both HeLa cells and 3T3 cells for application in the Trolox exposure experiments, the cells were exposed to H 2 2 2 Figure 3 2 2 2 2 Figure 3 2 2 2 2 Figure S1 (see Supplementary Material) For each H 2 2 Figure 3 The AUC values obtained for each H 2 2 Figure 3 Figure 3 2 2 2 2 2 31 32 2.3. Effect of Trolox on Intracellular ROS in HeLa Cells and 3T3 Cells Under H 2 2 When either HeLa cells or 3T3 cells were preincubated with Trolox for 1 h at different concentrations and then exposed to H 2 2 Figure 4 Figure 5 In HeLa cells, none of the fluorescence time courses, except for the one corresponding to cells preincubated with 160 µM Trolox, showed increased fluorescence values compared to the curve with H 2 2 Figure 4 2 In 3T3 cells only the concentrations of 2 and 5 µM Trolox showed decreased fluorescence values compared to the curve with H 2 2 Figure 5 2 2 Figure 5 Figure 5 The spectrofluorimetric response of both cell types was quantified as the AUC of the time course curves for all the Trolox concentrations used ( Figure 6 2 2 Figure 6 Figure 6 2 2 Figure 6 2.4. Comparison with Previous Studies The results obtained in this study were compared with literature data as reported in Table 1 3 2 2 33 34 34 2 3 3. Discussion The present study provides new insights into the concentration dependence of the dual antioxidant/prooxidant behavior of Trolox in HeLa cells and 3T3 cells, contributing to clarifying its biphasic behavior under short-term (1 h) exposure both under baseline conditions (no oxidant added) and under prooxidant conditions (H 2 2 Prooxidant conditions were experimentally designed as exposing the cells to 300 µM H 2 2 2 2 22 2 2 2 2 22 26 27 28 2 2 The ROS-sensitive intracellular probe used for this study was CM-H 2 33 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 − − 2 2 30 29 31 36 37 38 39 40 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 The results of this study on the two cell models support the concept that the intracellular redox activity of Trolox is not only concentration-dependent but also modulated by the specific intracellular oxidative environment. Indeed, consistent differences between the two models in either basal or oxidative stress conditions were observed. Under basal conditions, 3T3 fibroblasts, representative of a non-transformed, low-ROS cellular environment [ 29 2 30 31 To explain the mechanisms underlying the different behaviors observed in the two cell types, we must consider that high intracellular ROS concentrations can promote the oxidation of Trolox into phenoxyl radicals—especially under conditions of elevated oxidative stress. It is known that Trolox undergoes rapid one-electron oxidation by various ROS [ 9 41 42 43 41 42 44 41 45 9 46 2 2 2 2 2 2 Also in this case, the different responses between the two cell types could reflect differences in their redox status. It is known that in HeLa cells exposure to H 2 2 47 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Overall, this is one of the few studies to compare side-by-side a cancer cell line (HeLa) with high basal ROS [ 30 29 3 33 2 2 34 2 3 16 18 34 42 While earlier studies have predominantly described Trolox prooxidant behavior in the context of transition metal-catalyzed redox reactions [ 16 18 34 42 Since Trolox is a water-soluble analog of α-tocopherol, it is important to contextualize its observed dual antioxidant/prooxidant behavior by comparing it with that of α-tocopherol, the natural lipophilic form of vitamin E. Both compounds share the redox-active chromanol ring, which is central to their antioxidant activity through hydrogen atom donation and radical scavenging [ 48 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 54 55 Overall, our findings, although based on the use of a single fluorescent probe (CM-H 2 4.

The cell-permeant probe 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-20,70-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H 2 HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). 4.2. Assessment of Trolox Intracellular Antioxidant/Prooxidant Activity in HeLa Cells and 3T3 Cells The intracellular antioxidant/prooxidant activity of Trolox was assessed in HeLa cells and 3T3 cells charged with the ROS-sensitive probe, 5-(and-6-)-chloromethyl-20,70-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, and acetyl ester (CM-H 2 3 31 HeLa cells and 3T3 cells were cultured as a monolayer in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing 4500 mg/L glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 40 IU/mL penicillin G, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin, under a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 4 ® For the assessment of the intracellular effect of Trolox under baseline conditions, HeLa cells and 3T3 cells were first incubated with increasing concentrations of Trolox (ranging from 2 to 160 µM) for 1 h. Then, they were washed three times, charged with the cell-permeant fluorescent probe CM-H 2 2 For the assessment of the intracellular effect of Trolox under H 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4.3. Visualization of HeLa Cells by Confocal Microscopy HeLa cells were plated at a density of 1 × 10 4 2 4.4. Visualization of 3T3 Cells by Widefield Fluorescence Microscopy T3 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 10 4 ® 2 4.5. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M. For multiple comparisons, analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison post-test, as specified in the captions of figures. The GraphPad Prism (version 10) software was used for all the analyses and graphing. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the dual redox behavior of Trolox by demonstrating that both its antioxidant and prooxidant effects can manifest within a short exposure period (1 h) and that they are highly dependent on cell type and oxidative context. Through the comparative analysis of the responses observed in the two cell models, the study demonstrated that the same concentrations of Trolox can produce varying effects depending on the cell type and the oxidative intracellular environment, offering a more subtle understanding of the multifaceted aspects of antioxidant supplementation. These results emphasize that antioxidant supplementation cannot be considered always beneficial and must be contextualized based on dose, exposure time, and cellular redox characteristics. Based on our findings, several directions emerge for future research, including mechanistic studies on phenoxyl radical formation and fate and exploration of redox adaptability across cell types for the selection of antioxidant treatments based on cellular redox phenotypes.
