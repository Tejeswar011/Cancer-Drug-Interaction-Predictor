Patients have limited treatment options and have worse survival globally 1 3 4 5 6 8 Fatty acid (FA) metabolism is important for energy production and storage. Many biological processes, including cell proliferation and the generation of signaling molecules, depend on fatty acids. Recently, more attention has been given to its pivotal role in cancer 9 11 12 13 14 15 16 20 21 22 23 In this research, we first characterized the status of fatty acid metabolism genes (FAMGs) in GBM and established a robust Fatty Acid Metabolism Prognostic Signature (FAMS) by integrating multiple machine learning survival algorithms. We validated the feasibility of FAMS in both training and validation cohorts from different data platforms and classified all GBM patients into high- and low-risk groups. Additionally, we explored the underlying relationships between FAMS and biological function and immune cell infiltration in the TME. Our analysis highlights the importance of the FAMS in predicting the prognosis and response to treatment in patients with GBM. Materials and Methods Data collection and processing RNA-seq data, somatic mutation and copy number variation (CNV) data, and corresponding meta-information for the TCGA-GBM cohort 24 25 26 https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ https://www.gtexportal.org/home/datasets 27 28 29 http://www.cgga.org.cn/index.jsp GSE16011 30 GSE13041 31 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo We retained all GBM patients whose overall survival (OS) data for further analysis. The raw read counts from the TCGA and CGGA cohorts were converted to transcripts per kilobase million (TPM) and further log2 transformed. The raw microarray data were background adjusted and normalized via the robust multiarray averaging (RMA) algorithm 32 33 To collect the FAMGs, we obtained gene sets related to fatty acid metabolism from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, v111.1) 34 35 36 Genetic alterations and differential expression analysis of FAMGs in glioblastoma The top genes with the highest mutation frequency are shown by oncoplot. The frequency of CNVs in FMGs was subsequently assessed, and the most significant findings were represented using a bidirectional lollipop chart for visualization. KEGG enrichment analysis was conducted using the R package “ClusterProfiler” (v4.12.6) 37 38 Consensus clustering of FAMGs Utilizing the RNA expression of the differentially expressed FAMGs, we performed consensus clustering using the “ConsensusClusterPlus” (v1.68.0) R package 39 40 41 Calculation of FAMS by machine learning To establish an FAMGs-based prognostic signature, we first screened the prognostic FAMGs by univariate Cox regression analysis and integrated 10 machine learning algorithms to construct a prediction model. Finally, all combinations of these algorithms were performed using the ten-fold cross-validation method in TCGA-GBM mRNA-seq data 24 26 28 29 GSE16011 30 GSE13041 31 42 The median value of the FAMS was used to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups; the prognostic and predictive role of the FAMS were explored on the basis of this situation. Survival analyses were then performed for these two groups across all GBM patients or those receiving treatment. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was carried out to assess the independence of FAMS from other clinical factors. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) To fully describe the functional differences between different groups, we used GSEA 35 43 44 Immune infiltration analysis To characterize the immune response process, we employed the tracking tumor immune phenotype (TIP) webserver 45 46 47 The relative abundance of 28 immune cell types was also calculated by ssGSEA in each patient in the TCGA-GBM cohort with immune cell markers 48 50 Statistical analysis All the data were processed and statistically analyzed using R (v4.4.0) software. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis was conducted with the 'survminer' (v0.4.9) and 'survival' (v3.5-5) R packages 51 53 54 p Results Genetic variant landscape and expression of FAMGs in GBM A total of 332 FAMGs were curated from the KEGG, MSigDB, and Reactome databases ( Table S1 IDH1 1 1 PRKAG2 TBXAS1 CROT MDH2 PON1 PON2 PON3 ECHS1 UROS FFAR4 SCD 1 We examined the expression levels of these FAMGs in both glioblastoma and normal brain tissue. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed a clear distinction between normal tissue and glioblastoma tissue on the basis of the expression patterns of FAMGs (Figure 1 1 1 Consensus clustering of FAMGs in glioblastoma To underscore the clinical relevance of the FAMGs, we performed a consensus clustering analysis based on the differentially expressed FAMGs. The CDF curves and PAC statistics indicated that the patients could be divided into two FAMG patterns, named as cluster 1 and cluster 2 (Figure 2 Table S2 IDH MGMT CD274 PDCD1 CTLA4 TNFRSF18 TNFSF9 TIGIT, LAG 2 Figure S1 p p 2 Furthermore, to gain insights into the molecular characteristics underlying this distinction, we identified 1024 genes that were differentially expressed between the clusters ( Figure S1 Figure S2 Establishment and validation of the fatty acid metabolism prognostic signature In light of the significant influence of FAMGs on the clinical outcomes and tumor environment of GBM patients, a FAMGs based prognostic signature was pursued to gain deeper insights into the underlying complexities of GBM. Through univariate Cox regression analysis, we initially identified prognosis-associated FAMGs among the differentially expressed FAMGs (Figure 3 GSE16011 GSE13041 Figure S3 G0S2 LDHA ACOT7 ADH1C ADH1A APEX1 CBR1 NBN CD1D GPX2 3 Table S3 All patients in each dataset were assigned to one of two groups on the basis of the median FAMS. Patients in the high-risk group exhibited significantly shorter OS durations than those in the low FAMS group across the training cohort (Figure 3 p 3 Figure S3 Figure S3 FAMS model predicts prognosis and treatment response in independent GBM dataset To confirm the prognostic significance of the FAMS, we analyzed the discrepancies in OS stratified by IDH mutation status and treatment type. Considering the IDH status, the patients with high FAMS had the worst outcome among the IDH-wild-type patients. Patients with low FAMS and IDH mutation had better survival (Figure 4 4 Figure S4 4 4 Figure S4 Figure S4 Functional characterization between the high- and low-FMAS groups Given the excellent performance in predicting survival, we next aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms related to FAMS. Utilizing various functional annotation gene sets, we used GSEA to comprehensively screen and characterize the biological functions involved in the two FAMS groups. Through enrichment analysis, we found that multiple pathways related to immune responses, cell proliferation, fatty acid transport, and cell chemotaxis migration were enriched in the high FAMS score group, whereas the main biological functions involved in the low FAMS score group of patients were Mitotic, DNA damage repair, and homologous recombination (Figure 5 5 5 5 5 Association of FAMS with the immune program and environment Owing to the enrichment of immune response-related functions in the high FAMS group, we analyzed the representative steps involved in the cancer immune cycle, including the release of antigens, cancer antigen presentation, priming and activation, immune cell recruitment and infiltration, recognition of cancer cells and killing of cancer cells, and found that immune cell recruitment and cancer cell killing may be more pronounced in the high FAMS group in the TCGA RNA-seq dataset (Figure 6 46 47 6 Next, we quantified immune cell infiltration in the TCGA-RNA dataset and explored the relationship between FAMS and immune infiltration. The results showed that compared with the low FAMS group, the high FAMS group had greater proportions of CD8+ T cell, natural killer T cell, and macrophages (Figure 6 R p R p R p 6 FOXP3 CTLA4 CD163 PDCD1, 6 Genomic comparison between the high- and low-FMAS groups We compared the somatic mutation profiles of patients in the high-FAMS group and low-FAMS group, and the gene with the highest mutation frequency in the high-FAMS group was PTEN TP53 7 PTEN EGFR TP53 ATRX IDH1 7 p < 0.05 7 CCNE1 GPX4 CDKN2D APEX1 FOXA1 NFKBIA VEGFA 7 p < 0.001 7 7 7 Discussion Tumors in the brain may progress more rapidly because of their specific physiological location and environment 55 56 24 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 Figure S5 In this study, we analyzed the copy number variation, expression levels, and related functional background of FAMGs. The FAMGs with high copy number deletions are related mainly to fatty acid biosynthesis; and elongation, and the genes with high amplification are involved in arachidonic acid metabolism and the adipocytokine signaling pathway. Using the gene expression profiles, patients from the TCGA GBM RNA-seq dataset were stratified into two distinct molecular groups. Cluster 1 expressed higher levels of immune checkpoint genes and had greater immune cell abundance, whereas Cluster 2 was associated with a more favorable prognosis. DEGs between the two groups were identified. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that the genes whose expression was high in Cluster 1 might participate in biological processes and pathways related to the immune response. These findings may indicate that the expression patterns of FAMGs are potentially related to the tumor microenvironment of GBM, which may result in different survival outcomes and immune response states. On the basis of the differential expression of FAMGs and their association with prognosis, we constructed a prognostic signature, referred to as FAMS, to predict patient survival and prognosis. All patients were divided into high- and low-FAMS groups on the basis of the FAMS values, which demonstrated disparate survival trends and biological characteristics. The patients in the high FAMS group exhibited consistently shorter OS, DSS, and PFI across multiple datasets from different data platforms. In addition, fatty acid metabolism has been reported to be associated with resistance to radiotherapy in tumors 64 67 G0S2 68 69 ACOT7 70 71 72 A number of studies have indicated that immunotherapy may benefit patients with glioblastoma; nevertheless, owing to the lack of understanding of the tumor environment and immune processes, a considerable proportion of patients derive only minimal benefit from immunotherapy 73 74 45 In summary, we developed a prognostic signature derived from FAMGs. This model can serve as an independent prognostic factor to predict the outcomes of GBM patients. Nonetheless, a key limitation of our study is the absence of validation in a prospective cohort; and the lack of functional validation for the genes incorporated in FAMS. In addition, clinical and molecular information in the public data was limited, so there may be some potential associations with FAMS that were not observed in this study. Conclusions Within the confines of this study, we systematically explored the multiomics landscape of fatty acid metabolism genes (FAMGs) in glioblastoma and meticulously devised a robust prognostic signature by integrating FAMGs. In addition, this research elucidates the potential relationships between prognostic models and mutation patterns, the tumor microenvironment, and biological functions. Consequently, this signature has the potential to serve as a robust and promising tool to improve personalized risk stratification and therapeutic implications for glioblastoma patients.
