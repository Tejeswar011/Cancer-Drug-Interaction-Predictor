Resveratrol (RES), a natural polyphenolic compound, has attracted widespread attention due to its potent anticancer properties. Long non-coding (lnc)RNAs serve crucial regulatory roles in OC pathogenesis. However, the mechanism underlying the RES-mediated inhibition of OC cell proliferation through lncRNA regulation is not fully understood. The present study aimed to assess the role of lncRNAs in RES-mediated inhibition of OC cell growth. The A2780 OC cell line was used as the experimental model to establish control and RES-treated groups. The effect of RES on OC cell migration was also evaluated. Differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) were identified after RES treatment. lncRNA-mRNA regulatory networks of tumor-related pathways were constructed and functionally assessed using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR, proliferation assays, and knockdown and overexpression of hub lncRNAs. The results demonstrated that RES significantly inhibited OC cell migration. Moreover, 721 DELs were identified after RES treatment and were predominantly enriched in the p53 signaling pathway and cell cycle regulation associated with tumorigenesis.

They can interact with DNA and transcription factors to regulate the transcription initiation, elongation and termination of genes ( 5 6 7 8 10 ZEB1 AS1 hepatocellular carcinoma upregulated lncRNA metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 MALAT1 11 12 ITG)B8-AS1 ITGB3 ITGA3 13 HOX transcript antisense RNA 14 MALAT1 15 toll like receptor 8 TLR8)-AS1 TLR8 16 maternally expressed 3 EGFR 17 Homeobox D-AS1 4 Resveratrol (RES), a polyphenolic phytonutrient with several biological properties, has shown promising anticancer potential in preclinical studies, exerting cytotoxic effects and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells ( 18 19 MALAT1 small nucleolar RNA host gene (SNHG)16 20 21 The present study aimed to assess the key biological processes and signaling pathways regulated by RES in OC cells using A2780 cell line as a model. Changes in lncRNA expression profiles after RES treatment were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing technology, screening five highly responsive RES hub genes, and constructing lncRNA-mRNA interaction networks. The findings of the present study could deepen the understanding of the molecular mechanism of RES against OC, provide potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of OC, and lay a theoretical foundation for the development of novel targeted therapeutic strategies based on lncRNA regulation. Materials and methods Cell culture and RES treatment The human A2780 OC cell line [cat. no. iCell-h004, Mirror Qidian (Shanghai) Cell Technology Co., Ltd.] was cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (all Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 50 21 Mycoplasma RNA sequencing and expression of lncRNAs A2780 cells were treated with or without 75 µM RES for 24 h, and TRIzol™ (Invitrogen™; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) were used to isolate total RNA from cells. RNA quality was quantified using RNase-free agarose gel electrophoresis using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). After eliminating ribosomal RNAs from total RNA, the samples were diluted in fragmentation buffer before reverse transcription of the mRNA/non-coding RNA transcripts with random primers using the VAHTS Universal V6 RNA-seq Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China, Cat no. NR604). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed at 25°C for 10 min, 42°C for 15 min, and 70°C for 15 min; second-strand cDNA synthesis was then performed at 16°C for 30 min, 65°C for 15 min. The cDNA fragments were purified using the QiaQuick PCR extraction kit (cat no. 28104, Qiagen, Inc.) and subsequently ligated to an Illumina sequencing adapter (Illumina, Inc.), to construct cDNA libraries. After digestion, PCR products were amplified and the library concentration was measured using the DNA 1000 assay kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.), with quantification and pooling performed using the ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The libraries, with a loading concentration of 3 ng/µl, were then sequenced by Guangzhou Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co., Ltd. using the HiSeq 2500 Sequencing System (Illumina, Inc.) with a paired-end 150 bp sequencing strategy. Raw sequence reads were screened using fastp (version 0.18.0) to eliminate low-quality bases and adapter sequences, and high-quality clean reads were obtained ( 22 23 24 26 27 29 30 31 Bioinformatics analysis RNAplex (version 0.2) and the Vienna RNA package were used to predict the complementary relationships between antisense lncRNAs and mRNA ( 32 cis 33 cis 33 cis trans 33 http://www.geneontology.org/ lncRNA-mRNA association analysis Based on the results of KEGG enrichment analysis, combined with published evidence supporting the anticancer mechanism pathways, including the p53 signaling pathway, oocyte meiosis and cell cycle pathways, differentially expressed lncRNAs (DELs) and mRNAs and in these pathways were screened for co-expression analysis ( 34 36 Validation of DELs and mRNAs using RT-quantitative (qPCR) RT-qPCR was performed to assess DELs and mRNA expression. Total RNA was extracted using the Ultrapure RNA kit (DNase I, Cat no. CW0597S, Jiangsu Cowin Biotech Co., Ltd). cDNA was synthesized using Easyscript one-step gDNA removal and cDNA synthesis supermix (Cat no. AE-311, TransGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) with incubation at 42°C for 1 h. Specific primers were designed for RT-qPCR assays in a 20 µl reaction ( Table SI −ΔΔCq GAPDH 37 Cell transfection pcDNA3.1- SNHG15-203 SNHG15-203 Table SII Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay Following transfection, cell proliferation was assessed using a CCK-8 kit (Biosharp Life Sciences). Briefly, the CCK-8 reagent was added to the treated cells cultured in a 96-well plate. After incubation for 48 h, the optical density of each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (NanJing DeTie Laboratory Equipment Co., Ltd.). Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Transwell assay Cell migration was assessed using Transwell chambers (Corning, Inc.) with a pore size of 8 µm. A total of 2×10 5 Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism statistical software (version 8.0; Dotmatics) was used for experimental data processing. For comparisons between two groups, an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test was used if the data were normally distributed and had equal variances; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test was applied. For comparisons among multiple groups, one-way analysis of variance was used for parametric data, followed by Tukey's HSD test for multiple comparisons; otherwise, the Kruskal-Wallis H-test was used, followed by Dunn's test for post hoc pairwise comparisons. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used for correlation analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean of ≥3 independent experimental repeats. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Results Effect of RES on the migration of OC cells The effects of RES treatment on the migration of the OC cell line, A2780, were assessed. Transwell assays revealed that cells in the control group had a strong migration ability. The number of cells passing through the membrane was high, and numerous cells were observed on the lower surface of the membrane in the field of view ( Fig. 1 RES treatment alters the lncRNA expression profile of OC cells To evaluate the potential mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of RES on the proliferation of OC cells, lncRNA-sequencing analysis was performed on the OC cell line A2780 in the control and RES-treated groups. Novel lncRNAs were first identified and categorized into the following five groups based on their positions in the genome: 32,988 sense lncRNAs, 10,687 antisense lncRNAs, 7,316 intronic lncRNAs, 4,552 bidirectional lncRNAs and 35,927 intergenic lncRNAs ( Fig. 2A Fig. 2B Fig. 2C Fig. 2D H19-203 vacuole membrane protein 1 VMP1)-217 enolase 1 ENO1)-210, SNHG15-203 SNHG1-266 Table SIII SNHG15-203 Feature distribution comparison of lncRNAs and mRNAs Previously, mRNA sequencing in the RES-treated OC cell line A2780 revealed significant changes in mRNA expression in RES-treated cells and clarified its key role in cell proliferation and immunomodulation. Based on this, the potential roles of lncRNAs and their synergistic regulation of mRNAs were further explored. Compared with mRNAs, both annotated and novel lncRNAs exhibited fewer exons, shorter lengths and lower coding potentials ( Fig. 3A-C Fig. 3D Fig. 3E Fig. 3F Target gene prediction and functional enrichment analysis of lncRNAs To further assess the potential function of lncRNAs in the inhibition of OC cell proliferation by RES, the complementary binding relationship between lncRNAs and mRNAs was analyzed and the potential function of lncRNAs was inferred based on the functions of known mRNAs. The DELs were first predicted for cis trans cis Fig. 4A cis Fig. 4B Fig. 4C trans Fig. 4D trans Fig. 4E and F Furthermore, certain genes were revealed to be involved in multiple important biological functions ( Fig. 4A-F cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A CDKN1A SQSTM MYC CDK1 H2AC7, H2AC20 H2AC18 CDKN1A, SQSTM1 lncRNA-mRNA networks A total of five mRNAs associated with the p53 signaling pathway, oocyte meiosis, cellular senescence, cell cycle and their associated lncRNAs were selected and lncRNA-mRNA regulatory networks were constructed using Cytoscape. The results revealed that CDKN1A SQSTM1 H2AC7, H2AC20 H2AC18 Fig. 5 Table SIV CDKN1A SQSTM1 lnc-SQSTM1-206 MSTRG.5444.1 MSTRG.22456.2 MSTRG.3858.2 H2AC7 H2AC20 SNHG15-203 and cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase 1–212 H2AC18, H2AC2 MSTRG.7008.104 Validation of expression levels of lncRNAs and genes To verify the accuracy of the data, five lncRNAs ( ENO1-210, SNHG1-266, SNHG15-203, VMP1-217 H19-203 ENO1-210, SNHG1-266 SNHG15-203 VMP1-217 H19-203 Fig. 6A Table SIII The expression levels of key mRNAs associated with the lncRNAs were further evaluated.

Currently, surgery combined with chemotherapy is the mainstream treatment for OC. Although initial responses to therapy are often encouraging, there is a high recurrence rate, leading to a poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the progression mechanisms of OC and develop novel therapeutic strategies. The natural product RES has been reported to have complex anticancer activities ( 38 34 36 39 40 By combining the functional pathways and effect of RES on the mRNA expression profile from a previous study ( 21 CDKN1A SQSTM1 H2AC7, H2AC20 H2AC18 CDKN1A-SQSTM1 CDKN1A-SQSTM1 lnc-MAP3K13-7:1 CDKN1A 41 ZEB1 CDKN1A 42 RUN and SH3 domain containing 1-AS1 CDKN1A, Kruppel-like factor transcription factor 2 MSTO2P enhancer of zeste homolog 2- CDKN1A 43 44 MSTO2P MNX1-AS1 MNX1-AS1 CDKN1A 45 prostate cancer-associated transcript 1 CDKN1A 46 CDKN1A SQSTM1 47 48 Although the roles of CDKN1A SQSTM1 49 H2AC7 H2AC20 50 52 H2AC7-H2AC20-H2AC18 H2AC7 53 H2AC20 Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis H2AC18 54 55 56 H2AC7, H2AC20, H2AC18 57 lnc-SNHG15-203 lnc-SNHG15-203 in vitro lnc-SNHG15-203 H2AC7 H2AC20 lnc-SNHG15-203 H2AC7 H2AC20 H2AC7 H2AC20 Furthermore, the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) results suggest that DELs may be important in the inhibition of A2780 cell proliferation by RES by regulating its target genes, and participating in cell proliferation, senescence and apoptosis-related signaling pathways. By analyzing the expression profiles of lncRNAs, specific lncRNAs that were upregulated or downregulated in OC were identified. These lncRNAs, including SNHG15-203 However, the present study has certain limitations. First, the in vitro in vivo in vitro in vivo lnc-SNHG15-203 H2AC7 H2AC20 in vivo In summary, the present study comprehensively assessed the role of RES in inhibiting OC cell proliferation by regulating lncRNAs using RNA-seq. The expression profiles of lncRNAs involved in RES-mediated inhibition of OC cell proliferation were systematically identified. These DELs were associated with several important signaling pathways. Subsequently, the lncRNA-mRNA regulatory networks were constructed. In addition, the results demonstrated that lnc-SNHG15-203 H2AC7 Supplementary Material Supporting Data Acknowledgements Not applicable.
