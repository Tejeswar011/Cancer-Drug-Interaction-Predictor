In a sheep model of bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection, PD-L1 expression was correlated with BLV proviral load, and TIM-3 expression was upregulated in multiple T-cell subsets. Moreover, TIM-3 blockade, alone or combined with PD-L1 inhibition, enhanced T-cell activation and cytokine production, while PD-L1 blockade alone had limited effects. These findings demonstrate that TIM-3 plays a role in T-cell dysfunction in sheep and support the use of sheep as a model for evaluating immunotherapies targeting immunoinhibitory molecules in BLV infection and other chronic infectious diseases. Abstract Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infects B cells in ruminants and causes lymphoma after an extended latency period. Previous studies have demonstrated T-cell exhaustion through the upregulation of immunoinhibitory molecules, including programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3), in BLV-infected cattle. However, studying T-cell exhaustion across all BLV infection stages remains challenging due to the virus’s prolonged latency in cattle. Sheep provide a valuable model, as they develop lymphoma more rapidly than cattle. This study examined PD-L1 and TIM-3 expression kinetics and T-cell function in BLV-infected sheep. During persistent infection, PD-L1 expression was correlated with BLV proviral load.

Introduction Exposure to chronic infections and malignant tumors frequently leads to T-cell exhaustion, characterized by the development of functionally impaired T cells [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6 11 6 11 6 11 + + 12 10 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 While immunotherapies targeting immunoinhibitory molecules have demonstrated promising efficacy and durable clinical benefits in cancer treatment [ 11 20 21 22 23 24 25 In veterinary medicine, bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection is a major cause of immunosuppression in cattle [ 26 27 27 27 28 29 30 31 32 Our previous studies have demonstrated that BLV infection leads to the upregulation of immunoinhibitory molecules PD-1, PD-L1, and TIM-3, and that blocking these molecules can restore T-cell function both in vitro and in vivo [ 33 34 35 Sheep provide an effective experimental model for studying various chronic bovine infections, including BLV infection [ 36 37 38 39 36 39 40 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Blood Sample Collection and Experimental BLV Infection in Sheep Heparinized peripheral blood samples were collected from ten BLV-uninfected healthy sheep (Crossbreed) housed at a private farm in Japan. Informed consent for the use of blood samples for this study was obtained from an animal owner. Experimental BLV infection in sheep was conducted at the Research Farm of the Field Science Center, Faculty of Agriculture, Iwate University. Seven sheep (Friesland or Crossbreed, one to four months old) were intraperitoneally inoculated with 3.0 × 10 7 All animal experiments were approved by the Iwate University Animal Care and Use Committee (approval number A202112, approval date 19 February 2021). All procedures in this study were in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines [ 41 2.2. Cell Isolation Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized blood samples using Percoll density gradient centrifugation (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) containing 0.5 mg/mL disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Kumamoto, Japan) and were then resuspended in PBS. PBMCs were used immediately for analysis or stored at −80 °C until needed. 2.3. Nucleic Acid Extraction and Proviral Load Measurement Total DNA was extracted from isolated PBMCs using the Quick-DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration and purity were measured using a NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). BLV proviral loads were quantified using a BLV Detection Kit targeting the BLV tax 2.4. Flow Cytometric Analysis of PD-L1 and TIM-3 Expression PD-L1 expression on IgM + + + + For PD-L1 staining, cells were incubated with anti-bovine PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (6C11-3A11; rat IgG2a [ 42 For TIM-3 staining, cells were incubated with anti-bovine TIM-3 mAb (1D3; mouse IgG1 [ 43 2.5. T-Cell Marker and Cytokine Production Analysis PBMCs (1 × 10 6 44 43 2 For T-cell marker analysis, cultured PBMCs were collected and incubated in blocking buffer as described above. Cells were then washed and stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-ovine CD4 mAb (17D; Washington State University Monoclonal Antibody Center), peridinin-chlorophyll-protein/cyanine5.5 (PerCP/Cy5.5)-conjugated anti-bovine CD8 mAb (CC63; Bio-Rad), PE-conjugated anti-bovine CD25 mAb (CACT116A; VMRD), Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-bovine CD69 mAb (KTSN7A; Washington State University Monoclonal Antibody Center), and Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C for 20 min. The 17D, CACT116A, and KTSN7A mAbs were pre-labeled with Zenon Mouse IgG1 Labeling Kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The CC63 mAb was conjugated with PerCP/Cy5.5 using the Lightning-Link Conjugation Kit (Abcam). For intracellular cytokine detection, cultured PBMCs were collected and incubated in blocking buffer as described above. Cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-ovine CD4 mAb (17D; Washington State University Monoclonal Antibody Center), PerCP/Cy5.5-conjugated anti-bovine CD8 mAb (CC63; Bio-Rad), and Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 780 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 4 °C for 20 min. After surface staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized using Fixation Buffer and Intracellular Staining Perm Wash Buffer (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were then stained with PE-conjugated anti-bovine interferon gamma (IFN-γ) mAb (CC302; Bio-Rad) and biotin-conjugated anti-bovine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mAb (CC328; Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for 20 min. Cells were then washed and incubated with PE/Cy7-conjugated streptavidin (BioLegend) at 4 °C for 20 min. The 17D and CC63 mAbs were conjugated as described above. Stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. 2.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 10.1.1 for macOS (GraphPad Software, Boston, MA, USA). The Mann–Whitney U test was used for PD-L1 and TIM-3 expression analysis. The Friedman test followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test was used for T-cell marker and cytokine expression analysis by flow cytometry. Statistical significance was defined as p 3.

Discussion Over the past decade, immunotherapy has attracted increasing attention for its potential to treat both cancer and chronic infectious diseases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become a cornerstone of cancer immunotherapy, complementing conventional treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. ICIs have demonstrated high response rates, particularly when used in combination regimes [ 47 48 49 24 In parallel with cancer immunotherapy, we have also explored the use of ICIs to treat chronic infectious diseases in livestock [ 40 42 35 Previous studies in cattle reported increased PD-L1 expression on IgM + 33 + 10 50 51 52 53 TIM-3 inhibition enhanced expression of activation markers (CD25 and CD69) and cytokine production (IFN-γ and TNF-α) in both CD4 + + 40 Furthermore, the marked upregulation of TIM-3 in γδTCR + 16 45 46 In cattle, several studies have confirmed that PD-1 and TIM-3 synergistically induce T cell exhaustion during BLV infection, and the combination inhibition could enhance the antiviral effects against BLV in vitro [ 35 43 34 34 54 Despite this limitation, using sheep as an experimental model offers significant advantages. Compared to cattle, sheep exhibit faster disease progression and enable higher experimental throughput, reducing both time and cost when studying chronic infectious diseases. Our findings provide valuable translational data that bridge the gap between the natural bovine host and the experimental sheep model. These insights may guide future development of ICI-based immunotherapies for BLV infection and potentially other chronic diseases across different species. 5. Conclusions During experimental BLV infection in sheep, PD-L1 and TIM-3 expression levels are upregulated in B cells and T cells, respectively. Functional assays revealed that TIM-3 blockade, alone or with PD-L1 blockade, enhanced T-cell activation and cytokine production, while PD-L1 inhibition had minimal effect. These findings underscore the central role of TIM-3 in T cell exhaustion and support the use of sheep as an experimental model for studying immunoinhibitory molecules throughout the infection stages and for assessing immunotherapies for BLV infection and other chronic diseases.
