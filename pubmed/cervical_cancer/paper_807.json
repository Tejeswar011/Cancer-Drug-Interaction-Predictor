Using bioinformatics tools, such as CCLE, GEO, TCGA-MMRF, Kaplan–Meier plotter, enrichment and CIBERSORT analyses, we systematically characterized the expression levels, impact on survival and biological significance of PRDXs in MM. Bone marrow aspiration and clinical data were subsequently collected from MM patients to validate the findings related to PRDX2 from the databases. Finally, PRDX2 silencing in vitro modulated cell proliferation, immune infiltration and ferroptosis susceptibility. Compared with those in normal plasma cells, the expression levels of PRDX2/4/5/6 were significantly increased in myeloma cells. Furthermore, in relapsed MM cells, PRDX1/2/3/6 expression was significantly upregulated compared with that at baseline. Notably, PRDX2 was found to be highly expressed and associated with poor tumor characteristics, potentially contributing to disease progression and correlating with unfavourable prognosis. PRDX-related genes participate in various biological functions, influence metabolic pathways and may regulate ferroptosis and immune-related pathways in myeloma cells. This study is the first comprehensive analysis of the potential diagnostic and prognostic impact of the PRDXs family in MM, highlighting their significant associations with ferroptosis and the immune microenvironment. These findings provide a strong experimental and theoretical foundation for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting ferroptosis and immunotherapy in MM.

In this study, various online analysis tools and a series of experiments were used to investigate the role of PRDXs in MM. In addition, the coexpression network of the PRDXs was analysed before potential biological functions and signaling pathways associated with these genes were identified. Finally, their correlation with tumor microenvironment (TME) components was explored. The flowchart of this study illustrated in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 The schematic illustration of PRDXs in MM. Materials and methods Bioinformatics analysis of gene expression and clinical data The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) ( https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for the RNA sequencing data from the GSE2658 GSE5900 http://kmplot.com/analysis/ P 1 Enrichment analysis The PRDX network and its associated genes were then constructed using STRING ( https://cn.string-db.org/ https://cytoscape.org/ 25 https://cytoscape.org/ 26 27 GSE24080 28 www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp P Ferroptosis-related genes and CIBERSORT analyses The relationships between PRDX expression and ferroptosis-related genes were analysed in the GSE24080 29 GSE276561 P Collection of clinical specimens Bone marrow aspirates were collected from 28 MM patients who were treated at the Department of Hematology at the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, while 18 aspirates from patients without hematologic malignancies served as controls. Furthermore, clinical data from MM patients were also collected. All experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and ethical approval for the bone marrow collection was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Lanzhou University, with informed consent also provided by all participants prior to the study. Cell culture and establishment of cell lines Human MM cell lines (RPMI-8226, MM1.S, AMO1, and U-266), purchased from Procell Life Science and Technology (Wuhan, China), were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Haoyang Huake, HY1640, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ABW, AB-FBS-0050S, Germany). PRDX2-knockdown lentiviral vectors were generated by GeneChem Gene (Shanghai, China), while a lentiviral vector without shRNA fragments (or containing unrelated RNA fragments) served as the control (shNC). ShPRDX2-1: 5'-CCTCTTTATCATCGATGGCAA-3', shPRDX2-2: 5'-AGATGAGGGCATTGCCTAC-3'. Cell transfection was performed when the cell culture reached approximately 70% confluence. The experimental procedure involved seeding 5 × 10 5 Total RNA isolation and quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) We used the Steadypure Quick RNA Extraction Kit (AG, AG21022, China) for RNA isolation, followed by cDNA synthesis using 5× SweScript ALL-in-one SuperMix for qPCR (Servicebio, G3337-1, China) and gDNA Remover (Servicebio, G3337-2, China). Subsequently, qRT-PCR analysis was performed using 2× SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Servicebio, G3321, China). GAPDH was used as an internal reference. All samples were run in triplicate, and the mean values were used for quantitative analyses. The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2 Western blotting (WB) RIPA buffer (Solarbio, R0010, China) and PMSF 100 mM (Solarbio, P0100-01, China) were combined with protease inhibitors to extract proteins. The protein lysates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, IPVH00010, Italy). After the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk for 2 h, they were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following specific primary antibodies. Finally, the membranes were exposed after treatment with secondary antibodies using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Kit (Biosharp, BL520B, China). Images were captured with a Tanon 5200 Multi image processing system and quantified with Image Processing and Analysis in Jave (ImageJ) software version 1.54 program ( https://imagej.net/ij/download.html Detection of cell proliferation by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay A total of 5000 cells were seeded into each well of 96-well plates, with 100 μL of medium per well. Four experimental groups (RPMI-8226: shPRDX2, shNC; AMO1: shPRDX2, shNC) were then established, each with five replicate wells. After 0, 24, 48 and 72 h, 10 μL of CCK-8 reagent was added, followed by a 2.5-h incubation before the OD values were recorded at 450 nm via a microplate reader. For each group, the highest and lowest OD values were excluded, and the average OD value of the remaining three wells was calculated. Transwell assay To evaluate the migration and invasion capabilities of MM cells, Transwell chambers (8 μm pore size; Corning, 3397, USA) were pre-coated without or with Matrigel (Corning, 356,234, USA). Transfected MM cells were collected and resuspended in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium. A total of 1 × 10 5 Flow cytometry Whole blood staining was performed within 24 h of blood collection, using one million cells per tube. The following fluorescently labelled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were added to the tubes and used at the concentrations given in the instructions: anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD45-PerCP, anti-CD8-PE and anti-CD4-APC, anti-CD19-APC, anti-CD16 + CD56-PE, anti-CD4-FITC, anti-CD25-APC, anti-CD127-PE (all from BD Pharmingen, USA). The percentages of immune cells (Tregs, total T cells, CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, NK cells, and total B cells) were evaluated by flow cytometry. The serum levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IFN-α, and IL-17A were assayed via the Cytokine Detection Kit (JIANGXI CELLGENE BIOTECH, China). The experiments were performed on a BD FACSCanto™ II (Becton Dickinson) flow cytometer. ROS, glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and ferrous ion detection The ROS Assay Kit (S0033S) and MDA Assay Kit (S0131S) were purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology, while the GSH assay Kit (A006-2–1) was obtained from Nanjing JianCheng Biotechnology Research Institute. Moreover, the Ferrous Ion Content Assay Kit (BC5415) was supplied by Beijing Solarbio Science and Technology. DCFH-DA was loaded into the cells, which were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The residual reagent was then washed off with PBS, after which the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, IX53, Japan). Furthermore, the cells were lysed via ultrasonication, and the resulting supernatant was collected. The reagents were then sequentially added to 96-well plates according to the kit instructions before the absorbance values were recorded at 405 nm, 530 nm and 593 nm using a microplate reader, with three replicates per group. Statistical analysis Two-group comparisons were subsequently performed via the two-tailed unpaired T P Results Expression levels, diagnostic and prognostic value of PRDXs in MM as determined from the analysis of different databases PRDX expression in MM cell lines and patients at different stages of disease progression was analysed. For this purpose, the mRNA levels of PRDXs in various solid and hematological tumors were retrieved from the CCLE database. Overall, it was found that PRDX2 and PRDX5 were relatively highly expressed in MM, suggesting their potential roles in MM pathogenesis (Fig. 2 1 GSE19784 GSE5900 2 GSE68891 P 2 2 GSE6477 GSE31161 2 Fig. 2 Expression, prognostic and diagnostic value of PRDXs in multiple myeloma.

It is regulated by oxidative stress, iron overload and lipid metabolism, with MDA being a byproduct of lipid peroxidation. We investigated key indicators of ferroptosis by interfering with PRDX2 expression to determine the role of PRDX2 in ferroptosis. The ROS, GSH, MDA, and Ferrous Ion Content Assay Kits were used to investigate the role of PRDX2 in ferroptosis. DCFH-DA staining first demonstrated that PRDX2 could regulate ROS levels in RPMI-8226 and AMO1 cells ( P P 5 P P 5 More importantly, the mRNA levels of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), which are ferroptosis-related genes, were significantly elevated in patients (n = 28) compared with normal individuals (n = 18), suggesting an inhibitory effect on ferroptosis in MM ( P P 5 P 5 Ferrostatin-1 negated the protective effect of PRDX2 knockdown on RSL3-induced ferroptosis Cell proliferation was assessed using the CCK-8 assay in shNC or shPRDX2 groups after inducing ferroptosis with RSL3, a GPX4 inhibitor and a ferroptosis inducer. The shPRDX2 group exhibited a lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) compared to the shNC group, suggesting that PRDX2 downregulation enhanced the cytotoxic effects of RSL3 on MM cells (Fig. 6 6 6 2 6 6 Fig. 6 PRDX2 enhanced the resistance to ferroptosis in MM cells. ( A B C D E–H I 6 Discussion MM is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous malignancy. While some patients achieve effective remission during the early stages of the disease 33 35 36 37 38 39 40 The results, derived from a relatively large cohort of participants, revealed increased PRDX2/4/5/6 in NDMM patients as well as relatively higher PRDX1/2/3/6 in RRMM patients, thus suggesting their potential involvement in MM development. Leveraging on a substantial dataset of MM samples with detailed clinical information, this study revealed that certain members of the PRDX family may contribute to relapse and adverse clinical outcomes. Demasi et al. 41 31 32 Ferroptosis is blocked by metal ion chelation, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and scavenging of free radicals but not by apoptosis inhibitors or necroptosis inhibitors 42 43 44 45 46 In fact, various studies have suggested that ferroptosis could indeed play a critical role in MM. Since MM cells are particularly sensitive to iron overload, promoting the efficacy of bortezomib and carfilzomib through MM cell death via ferroptosis has been shown 47 48 49 50 Evidence suggests that immune cells with diverse immunosuppressive phenotypes contribute to the formation of the tumor immune microenvironment, thereby promoting immune escape and facilitating myeloma progression 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 The most common assay is the PRDX2 antibody. Furthermore, mass spectrometry (MS) represents an accurate qualitative and quantitative method for PRDX2 identification, with MALDI-TOF allowing the precise molecular weight to be determined. For instance, Manta et al. 59 60 61 62 63 Drug resistance in MM may involve intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms 64 65 66 51 The current findings provided valuable insights into the significance of PRDX2 as a potential biomarker in ferroptosis and the immune microenvironment regulation. However, this study has several limitations. Firstly, most analyzed data were derived from publicly available databases. Owing to the diversity of data sources, some inconsistencies were noted across datasets, and thus additional experimental validation would be needed to confirm these results. Secondly, the limited retrospective clinical sample size and variables cannot exclude the possibility of biased results, and a larger number of clinical samples would be needed to assess PRDXs expression in CD138 + MM cells for robust conclusions. Thirdly, further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms linking PRDXs to ferroptosis and the immune microenvironment, which will be the focus of our future work. Finally, further experiments are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of PRDX2 inhibitors in preclinical models and to assess their synergistic anti-tumor effects and capacity to overcome drug resistance when combined with proteasome inhibitors and immunotherapy. Conclusions This study provides comprehensive evidence on PRDXs expression and their potential as biological and prognostic biomarkers in MM, positioning their as novel therapeutic targets for inducing non-programmed cell death and overcoming the tumor immune microenvironment challenges. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between PRDX2 and poor clinical outcomes. Notably, significant relationships among PRDX2, ferroptosis and immune cell infiltration were identified. Overall, PRDX2 exerts a pivotal dual role in maintaining redox homeostasis and reshaping the TME, thereby positioning it as a highly attractive therapeutic target to counteract resistance and enhance clinical outcomes.
