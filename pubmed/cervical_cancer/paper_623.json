Introduction Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the leading gynecological oncological disease by incidence in Western countries [ 1 2 3 4 5 Objective This study aimed to investigate the association between microsatellite instability (MSI) and histologically confirmed myometrial infiltration in patients with low-grade endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EC) and no radiological evidence of extra-uterine spread. Specifically, we sought to determine whether the presence of MSI correlates with a higher risk of myometrial invasion in tumors typically classified as low risk. Furthermore, a sub-analysis was performed to explore the relationship between the molecular mechanisms underlying MSI, namely the specific gene alterations causing loss of mismatch repair function, and the extent of myometrial infiltration. This approach aimed to clarify whether different patterns of MMR deficiency have distinct impacts on tumor invasiveness, thus contributing to a more refined risk stratification even in clinically indolent cases. 2. Material and Methods 2.1. Ethical or Institutional Review Board Approval This study was conducted in two university clinics where all patients treated must sign a dedicated consent for anonymous data processing. The research methods were established a priori and authorized through evaluation by the Ethics Committee Università degli Studi della Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli”-Azienda ospedaliera Universitaria “Luigi Vanvitelli”-AORN “Ospedale dei Colli”, Campania 2 (IRB 30661/2022 of 31 March 2022). 2.2. Study Design In January 2025, we conducted a retrospective observational multicenter cohort study with secondary data from the clinical database, selecting a total of 144 patients with EC who underwent primary staging surgery at the gynecologic oncology unit of the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy and the unit of obstetrics and gynecology, “Santa Maria della Misericordia” University Hospital, Udine, Italy. The research methods were established a priori. This study is a retrospective case-control analysis of women affected by low-grade endometrial endometrioid cancer, with clinical absence of extrauterine dissemination. This study used the STROBE statement for observational studies [ 6 This study’s primary outcome was to assess the difference in the prevalence of myometrial infiltration in MSI and microsatellite stability (MSS) ECs confined to the uterus. We also conducted a sub-analysis for the type of heterodimer leading the MSI. 2.3. Setting Between August 2022 and October 2024, all patients treated for EC at the gynecologic oncology unit of the University of Campania “Luigi Vanvitelli” Naples, Italy, and the unit of obstetrics and gynecology, “Santa Maria della Misericordia” University Hospital, Udine, Italy, who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. All included patients had low-grade EC (Grading 1 or 2), endometrioid histotype without p53 mutations. All patients included had a total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with bilateral pelvic node mapping (by sentinel lymph node SLN or systematic lymphadenectomy) and underwent a preoperative MRI with no evidence of extra-uterus dissemination in the 30 days previous to surgery, revised by two independent blinded expert radiologists. Patients were stratified based on the molecular profile in MSI and MSS. A sub-stratification was performed based on the loss of function of the heterodimers involved in MSI: MLH1/PMS2 heterodimer, MSH2/MSH6, or both. No follow-up was needed for the desired data. 2.4. Participants The inclusion criteria to be enrolled were as follows: (1) diagnosis of endometrial endometrioid cancer G1 or G2; (2) complete anatomopathological information obtainable; (3) complete molecular profile for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6; (4) have undergone surgical treatment with hysterectomy and at least bilateral SLN (5) for clinical stage I endometrial cancer; (6) underwent MRI within 30 days before surgery with no suspected extrauterine infiltration, confirmed by two blinded different expert radiologists. The exclusion criteria were patients with partial molecular profiling, patients with imaging suspected of advanced disease (lymph node positivity, peritoneal or parenchymal metastasis), patients with mutation of p53, patients with positive lymph nodes, and patients with an additional synchronous oncological diagnosis or within the previous 3 years. Data were compared between patients with microsatellite stability (MSS) and microsatellite instability (MSI). 2.5. Variables The variables examined were body mass index (BMI) as a continuous variable in kg/m 2 7 2.6. Laboratory Mismatch repair (MMR) protein status was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the following antibodies: MLH1 (clone M1, Ventana), PMS2 (clone EPR3947, Cell Marque), MSH2 (clone G219-1129, Cell Marque), and MSH6 (clone 44, Ventana). Nuclear staining of tumor cells with intensity comparable to that of internal controls (intestinal mucosa, stromal and lymphoid cells, appendix) was interpreted as retained expression, consistent with microsatellite stability (MSS, MMRp). Given that MLH1/PMS2 and MSH2/MSH6 act as heterodimeric complexes, evaluation was performed in two steps. PMS2 and MSH6 were examined first; if either protein showed loss of staining, the corresponding partner (MLH1 or MSH2) was subsequently analyzed to distinguish between isolated and concomitant loss. Tumors were classified as microsatellite instable (MSI) or MMR deficient (MMRd) if loss of nuclear expression was observed for at least one of the four proteins. MMR proteins act as functional heterodimers (MLH1/PMS2 and MSH2/MSH6), and the loss of one partner invariably determines dysfunction of the entire complex. For this reason, we evaluated heterodimers rather than single proteins. We also collected histopathological data on myometrial infiltration, grading, and histotype, and LVSI was expressed as a semiquantitative evaluation [ 7 2.7. Statistic Analysis The sample was analyzed according to the microsatellite stability status, expressed as MSS or MSI. Previously, all variables were analyzed using histograms and compared with parametric distributions and non-parametric distributions. The nominal variables were expressed as absolute frequency and percentages and compared using Fisher’s exact [ 8 9 10 The null hypothesis of our study was that there was no difference in the prevalence of myometrial infiltration between patients with MSS or MSI (H0: p1 = p2; H1: p1 − p2 ≠ 0 two-sided). The secondary outcome was the prevalence of myometrial infiltration in the different expressions of the MLH1/PMS2 and MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer groups. The weights of the individual values on the dichotomous dependent variable were calculated as a logistic regression [ 11 12 Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), obtained from univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, were graphically represented using forest plots. Each plot displayed the estimated effect size of each covariate on the presence of myometrial infiltration, with a visual emphasis on the magnitude and precision of the associations. The forest plot for the multivariate model was constructed using log-transformed ORs and diamond shapes to represent point estimates and confidence intervals. This study did not employ matching between cases and controls; all eligible patients meeting the inclusion criteria were consecutively enrolled and analyzed according to their microsatellite status. To determine whether the sample was adequate to detect a statistically significant difference in myometrial infiltration risk between the MSI and MSS groups, an “a posteriori power analysis” based on the Chi-square test for independent proportions was performed. With a significance level α = 0.05 and a true difference in the incidence of myometrial infiltration between the two groups (96% vs. 98%), the resulting statistical power (1 − β) was 65%, indicating a suboptimal probability of detecting a true association. The statistical significance level was set at 0.05. No formal sensitivity analysis was performed, as the dataset had no missing values for primary outcomes and all included patients met uniform inclusion criteria with complete molecular and histopathological data. All statistical investigations were performed using R software and R Studio vers. 2023.12.1 + 402. 2.8. Risk of Bias To reduce the risk of selection and information bias, we adopted several methodological safeguards. All included patients met strict predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria to ensure population homogeneity. Imaging evaluations were independently reviewed by two blinded expert radiologists, with discordances resolved by consensus. Likewise, histopathological assessments, including grading, LVSI, and myometrial infiltration, were performed independently by two specialized gynecological pathologists. In case of disagreement, a third senior pathologist was consulted. Molecular characterization of mismatch repair proteins (MMRs) was standardized across centers using validated immunohistochemical protocols. No matching between cases and controls was applied, but consecutive inclusion minimized selection bias. Multivariate regression studies were conducted with a combination of all variables present to minimize confounders. The individual models thus obtained were compared using adjusted R2 and Bayesian information criteria (BIC). The best model was chosen based on the lowest expressed value of BIC data analysis, conducted first by CR and then by blinding by SR, unaware of this study’s objective. No missing data were present in the outcomes of interest. 3. Results Our retrospective observational cohort study, conducted at our institutions between August 2022 and October 2024, selected 217 patients and examined the MMRPs of 144 patients undergoing surgery for clinical stage I low-grade endometrial cancer, with no evidence at MRI of myometrial infiltration. The sample was stratified according to microsatellite stability: 118 MSS vs. 26 MSI. Further, patients with MSI were stratified on the basis of heterodimers involved in loss of function: 17 Loss of MLH1/PMS2, 7 Loss of MSH2/MSH6, and 2 with loss of both. The causes of inclusion and exclusion are shown in Figure 1 3.1. Population Characteristics No statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding age, BMI, ethnicity, tumor dimension, or LVSI status were found between MSI and MSS. The grading distribution was the only statistically significant difference between the two groups (G2 47% MSS vs. 81% MSI, p Table 1 The same sample difference was also preserved in stratification according to the heterodimer involved in MSI. The group with loss of function of MLH1/PMS2 showed the highest prevalence of G2 (88%). The sub-analysis data are summarized in Table 2 3.2. Outcome This study’s main outcome was assessing the distribution of myometrial infiltration in low-grade EC MSS and MSI. The MSI and MSS patient groups showed a non-significant overlapping percentage of myometrial infiltration (98% vs. 96%; p p Table 3 3.3. Sub-Analysis for Heterodimer The same analysis was conducted by stratifying the sample according to the loss of function of individual heterodimers. The prevalence of myometrial infiltration was higher in case of loss of function of MLH1/PMS2 heterodimer, compared with loss of function of MSH2/MSH6, although without reaching statistical significance (100% vs. 86%; p p Table 4 3.4. Logit Regression To test the correlation between the type of loss of function and myometrial infiltration, we constructed a logit regression model, with the dependent variable the presence or absence of myometrial infiltration. The MLH1/PMS2 group failed to show a statistically significant positive correlation, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.02 (estimate 0.017, std. error 0.037; 95% CI 0.95–1.10; p p Table 5 To limit the confounders, we also constructed multivariate regression models for each possible variable. Based on the lowest BIC, the best multivariate analysis model combined grading and LVSI status as confounders. In this case, the loss of MSH2/MSH6 maintained the negative association with myometrial infiltration (OR 0.88, estimate −0.124, std. error 0.052; 95% CI 0.80–0.98; p p Table 6 The results of the multivariate logistic regression model assessing the association between MMR heterodimer loss and myometrial infiltration are visually summarized in Figure 2 4. Discussion 4.1. Interpretation of Results The results of our study show no different incidence of myometrial infiltration in an absolute sense between patients with low grade EC (MSS and MSI). However, in patients with MSI, the risk of deep myometrial infiltration (≥50% of myometrial thickness) is higher. When the sample is stratified by type of loss of function that determines MSI status, the heterodimer MLH1/PMS2 loss is more likely to involve deep infiltration. This finding is also supported by the evidence that in the case of the loss of both heterodimers, the risk is increased compared with the loss of MSH2/MSH6 alone. Logistic regression models, however, do not show a strong correlation between the loss of function of this heterodimer and myometrial infiltration. However, in contrast, loss of function of the MSH2/MSH6 heterodimer shows a protective value against myometrial infiltration in a context of MSI. This feature is also confirmed in light of the weight exerted by the grading and involvement of LVIS. It should be emphasized that patients with clinical suspicion of uterine-confined tumors represent the population under investigation. Therefore, our study emphasizes how microsatellite instability favors tumor progression even in this category of patients, who are always considered “slow-moving” [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 4.2. Clinical Implications The information about MS status, as demonstrated in our study, even in the presence of “clinically reassuring” diseases such as confined uterine disease and low-grade endometrioid histotypes, adds valuable information to the therapeutic planning of these patients. The greater likelihood of these patients presenting with myometrial infiltration can influence the therapeutic and staging approach. Finally, recent insights into the molecular profile of endometrial carcinomas have opened new horizons to better characterize the prognostic impact of the different presentations of this tumor [ 3 19 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 4.3. Comparison with the Literature Our findings align with the existing literature emphasizing the prognostic significance of microsatellite instability (MSI) in endometrial carcinoma. Studies by Stelloo et al. [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 16 17 37 38 4.4. Strenght and Limitations The limitation of our study is its retrospective nature, which increases the possibility of inclusion bias. On the contrary, however, the strict inclusion criteria and having limited the enrolment to only patients with low-grade carcinoma and in the absence of clinic suspicion of extra-uterine disease helps to give a fair correlation with the effect exerted by microsatellite instability in the progression of this pathology. Another limitation of our study is the absence of an a priori sample size calculation. Although we performed a post hoc power analysis to assess the ability of our sample to detect significant differences between groups, this approach is methodologically weaker. It does not substitute a formal pre-study justification of sample size. Nevertheless, this study is methodologically robust, with well-defined and rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria. Furthermore, the measures adopted to reduce bias enhanced the reliability of the findings, providing strong statistical support. Further prospective studies and validation of patients’ DNA to confirm the molecular status will be necessary to clarify doubts. Moreover, no formal sensitivity analysis was performed, as the dataset had no missing values for primary outcomes and all included patients met uniform inclusion criteria with complete molecular and histopathological data. A further limitation of our study is the relatively small number of patients with MSI (n = 26), which reduces the generalizability of our findings and underlines the need for validation in larger prospective cohorts. Given the sample size and the homogeneity of the population, we deemed the risk of substantial bias from unmeasured confounding to be limited. However, we acknowledge that further sensitivity analyses in larger cohorts may strengthen the robustness of our findings. Finally, a further limitation is the absence of prognostic data, given the proximity to the enrolment period. Future follow-ups on the sample will also make deducing any differences in prognostic terms possible. 4.5. Future Prospectives Future studies should aim to validate these findings in larger prospective cohorts, ideally incorporating long-term oncologic and reproductive outcomes. In particular, assessing the prognostic significance of MSI and specific MMR heterodimer loss in relation to recurrence and survival would help establish their role as independent biomarkers. Moreover, integrating MSI status with imaging and molecular classifiers, such as ProMisE or TCGA-based models, may enhance preoperative risk stratification. Finally, prospective trials evaluating the safety and outcomes of fertility-sparing treatment in MSI-positive patients, even in the clinical absence of myometrial infiltration, could help define more precise selection criteria for conservative management in young women. 5. Conclusions In low-grade endometrial carcinomas, clinically confined to the uterine body, MSI, based on the loss of function of MLH1/PMS2, increases the likelihood of myometrial infiltration. Our results suggest that MSI, particularly with MLH1/PMS2 loss, may be associated with a higher likelihood of deep myometrial infiltration. These findings should be considered hypothesis-generating and require confirmation in larger prospective studies. Future studies will be necessary to assess the prognostic weight of these findings.
