Introduction The vulvar microbiome is adjacent to that of the skin and the vagina and connects microbiomes present on a stratified epithelial barrier to that of a mucosal barrier. Yet, the characterization of the microbiome in the vulvar region of the body is understudied, although dysbiosis in the microbiome of the skin or vagina have been linked to impairments in women’s health. Methods To better understand the role of the vulvar microbiome during healthy aging or during presentation of vulvar diseases, we analyzed the vulvar microbiome by shotgun metagenomic sequencing on composition at species level and for functional capacity. This was performed in a large population enrolled in the Vulvar Microbiome Leiden Cohort (VMLC), including a total of 58 healthy women in a broad age range (22–82 years). Moreover, we analyzed vulvar microbiome derived from 9 participants presenting a vulvar disease, including vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS; N N Results Compositional analyses showed a skin-, vagina-, or multispecies mixture- dominant bacterial signature, which revealed differences in the alpha diversity and functional capacity of the microbiome.

Continuous and versatile interactions take place within the microbiome or bidirectionally between the microbiome and the host. These interactions shape the composition and functionality of the microbiome. Moreover, various aspects in the physiology of the human host can influence the microbiota. Niche-specific microbiomes can be identified based on the nature of the epithelial tissue, for example the skin ( Byrd et al., 2018 Ma et al., 2012 Alkema et al., 2021 Verstraelen et al., 2022 White et al., 2011 Chng et al., 2016 Shanahan et al., 2021 Byrd et al., 2018 Saheb Kashaf et al., 2022 Ma et al., 2012 Lebeer et al., 2023 Norenhag et al., 2024 The vulvar microenvironment is a highly complex system inhabited by niche-specific communities of bacteria and other micro-organisms ( Larsen and Monif, 2001 Nardini et al., 2016 Pybus and Onderdonk, 1999 Joos et al., 2024 The role of the vulvar microbiome in health and disease is scarcely studied. Only a few studies have been published until now, which often lack analytical sensitivity to determine microbiota composition at species level ( Pagan et al., 2021 2023 Ma et al., 2024 Pyle et al., 2024 Amabebe and Anumba, 2018 Our aim was to investigate the vulvar microbiome at species level using shotgun metagenomic sequencing for compositional and functional profiles. Using shotgun metagenomics, species-level taxonomic resolution and functional insights can be obtained, which are main advantages as compared to traditional 16S rRNA gene sequencing approaches ( Ranjan et al., 2016 Wensel et al., 2022 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Cohort description The samples collected in the vulvar microbiome aging cohort (TNO; n n Pagan et al. (2023) 2.2 Sample collection vulvar swabs Vulvar swabs were collected by one trained gynecologist to minimize sampling variation during collection. Samples were anonymously collected non-invasively at one time point during routine gynecological visits following verbal consent. According to the ethical standards described in the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (in Dutch: Wet Medisch-Wetenschappelijk onderzoek met mensen, WMO) this study is classified as non-WMO research in The Netherlands ( CCMO, 2019 Scott et al., 2020 2.3 DNA isolation Each well of a 96-deep-well plate containing 50 μL microbiome sample was supplemented with 500 μL washed zirconium beads (0.1 mm; BioSpec products, Bartlesville, USA) in Milli-Q water and 800 μL CD1 solution from the DNeasy 96 Powersoil Pro QIAcube HT Kit (Qiagen). The plate was sealed and homogenized 4 min. Subsequently, the plates were centrifuged at 3000 × g g 2.4 Vulvar swab sequencing analyses Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of samples in the TNO cohort was performed according to protocols provided by Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, USA) also previously described ( Wiese et al., 2024 Pagan et al. (2023) Beghini et al., 2021 Cutibacterium Staphylococcus Grice and Segre, 2011 Townsend and Kalan, 2023 Gardnerella Lactobacillus, Prevotella Atopobium Finegoldia Ureaplasma Moosa et al., 2020 Dubé-Zinatelli et al., 2024 2.5 Statistical analysis Taxonomic and functional count tables derived from shotgun metagenomic data were obtained using MetaPhlAn and HUMAnN and subsequently imported as phyloseq objects ( McMurdie and Holmes, 2013 Oksanen et al., 2019 Love et al., 2014 Ritchie et al., 2015 p Wickham and Sievert, 2009 3 Results 3.1 Taxonomic profiling on species level of the healthy vulvar microbiome To determine the composition of the vulvar microbiome in healthy women, vulvar swabs were collected, extracted, and analyzed with shotgun metagenomic sequencing. This was performed in the Vulvar Microbiome Leiden Cohort (VMLC), which is a combination of samples collected in this study (referred as TNO) and samples collected in the study of Pagan et al. (2023) Supplementary Table 1 To merge both cohorts into a combined dataset, all sequencing data was analyzed in the same pipeline, followed by an unsupervised cohort comparative analysis ( Supplementary Figure 1A Supplementary Figure 1B The composition of the healthy vulvar microbiome was investigated by the relative abundance in the vulvar microbiome ( Figure 1A Staphylococcus epidermidis Finegoldia magna Peptoniphilus harei Prevotella timonensis Cutibaterium acnes Figure 1B FIGURE 1 Taxonomic profiling of the vulvar microbiome in healthy women.

Chart A shows relative abundance across age groups in quadrants Q1 to Q4, with various colored blocks indicating different taxa. Chart B displays a boxplot of relative abundance percentages for each taxon, highlighting variation and outliers. Taxa are labeled with a color legend on the right. 3.2 Vulvar microbiome can present a skin or vaginal dominant signature in healthy women The vulvar microbiome forms a unique interface by bridging the skin microbiome with the vaginal mucosal microbiome. Therefore, we further investigated the influence of both microbiomes on that found in the vulvar ecosystem. To do so, we indicated bacteria which are mainly found in the skin ( Grice and Segre, 2011 Townsend and Kalan, 2023 Moosa et al., 2020 Dubé-Zinatelli et al., 2024 Figure 2A C. acnes S. epidermidis G. vaginalis F. magna L. iners Supplementary Table 2 Supplementary Figure 2A Supplementary Figure 2B Supplementary Figures 2C–E FIGURE 2 Classification of the vulvar microbiome based on ecological signatures. (A) (B) X n Bar charts display the relative abundance of microbial species across other, skin, and vagina samples, with species color-coded by category. A heatmap below illustrates expression differences, with blue, red, and gray blocks indicating skin versus vagina, skin versus other, and vagina versus other comparisons. Subsequently, we investigated whether the signatures affect the functional capacity of the microbiome composition, we analyzed the genetic material for encoding functional enzymes, revealing substantial differences between vulvar and vaginal dominant signatures ( Figure 2B 3.3 The composition of the vulvar microbiome in relation to aging Vulvar microbiome composition in different age groups was examined by comparing the vulvar microbiomes in women. Based on the age of participants included in the VMLC, quartiles were categorized, which were compared for Shannon diversity ( Figure 3A Figure 3B Figure 3C Figure 3D Lactobacillus FIGURE 3 Compositional and functional analysis of healthy vulvar microbiome per age group. (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) n Boxplots and scatter plots represent alpha diversity and principal component analysis respectively. Heatmaps display species abundance and enzyme activity differences. A volcano plot illustrates differential expression with notable up- and down-regulated entities highlighted. Furthermore, we explored the functional capacity of the vulvar microbiomes in different aging groups to elucidate the functional differences at younger and older age. The majority of enzymes were not significantly different, however specific groups of enzymes exhibited variations were different due to aging ( Figure 3E Figure 3F 3.4 Compositional alteration in the vulvar microbiome associated with high-grade intraepithelial lesions and vulvar lichen sclerosus To evaluate if the vulvar microbiome was altered in vulvar diseases, a comparison of the vulvar microbiome in healthy conditions to that of individuals with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or individuals with vulvar lichen sclerosus (LS) was performed. In HSIL, the pathogenesis in the majority of cases is linked to human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated lesions, although there are HPV-independent lesions which have a distinct risk for disease progression ( Thuijs et al., 2024 Singh and Ghatage, 2020 Figure 4A Figure 4B Figure 4C Figure 4D Figure 4E e.g. Staphylococcus hominis Micrococcus luteus Moraxella osloensis Corynebacterium simulans Figure 4F Figure 4G N FIGURE 4 Compositional and functional variations of the vulvar microbiome in health and disease.

Panel D displays abundance and log2 fold change for specific bacterial groups. Panel F contains a volcano plot with significance annotations. Panel G is a heatmap indicating enzyme abundance and log2 fold change between LS and Healthy groups. 4 Discussion In this study, we present the characterization of the vulvar microbiome in a cohort of 67 individuals on species level taxonomy and functional profiling with shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We showed that the vulvar microbiome can be categorized as skin-, vagina-, or multispecies mixture- dominant bacterial signature, based on species predominantly present in the microbiome of the respective tissues. The effect of aging appeared minor, though there were a few species (e.g., Lactobacillus Our findings are in line with the observations of previous analyses ( Pagan et al., 2021 Brown et al., 2007 Costello et al., 2009 Shiraishi et al., 2011 Miyamoto et al., 2013 Jayaram et al., 2014 Hickey et al., 2015 Vongsa et al., 2019 Bruning et al., 2020 Murina et al., 2020 Chattopadhyay et al., 2021 Pagan et al., 2021 Lactobacillus Corynebacterium Staphylococcus Prevotella Gill et al., 2023 The intrinsic factor of aging has been explored in our cohort, as aging is a key factor impacting the composition of the microbiome. The onset of menopause and alterations in hormones such as a decrease in estrogen levels have been reported to affect microbiome composition in the vagina ( Park et al., 2023 Peters et al., 2022 Lactobacilli Lactobacillus Greenbaum et al., 2019 Walsh et al., 2019 In vulvar diseases, the microbiome has been sparsely studied. An exploratory study was performed by Pyle et al. (2024) Pyle et al. (2024) Pyle et al., 2024 Feng et al., 2013 Quesada-Vázquez et al., 2023 Mitra et al. (2015) Limitations of this study included a smaller sample size within each subgroup of women with a vulvar disease and the sampling was conducted at a single time point. Moreover, potential confounders that can affect the composition and functional capacity of the vulvar microbiome should be evaluated in meta-analyses and in future cohort studies, to cover more in-depth biological variations (e.g., hormonal status, hormonal dynamics, and lifestyle) and technical variations (e.g., sampling techniques, sequencing methods, and bioinformatical analyses). These limitations, especially on the cohort size, utilization of a single DAA tool (DESeq2), and potential contribution of background microbe detection, accentuate the exploratory nature of this project, which should be aimed to overcome in future studies. To better understand dynamics within the vulvar microbiome or the role of the vulvar microbiome during onset and progression of diseases, larger cohorts and more sampling time points are needed. Furthermore, to assign a skin- or vagina- dominant signature, we selected a limited number of species associated with these tissues, thereby partially omitting species with a natural low abundance level. Another limitation is that an inter-kingdom analysis was not performed, also covering relative abundance of the vulvar virome, mycobiome, parasitome, and archaeome. An inter-kingdom analysis would enhance our understanding of the vulvar ecosystem in healthy and diseased states. In conclusion, by performing shotgun metagenomic sequencing, we were able to unravel novel insights in the composition and functional capacity of the vulvar microbiome, enhancing our understanding of its role in women’s health and disease. We identified variations in microbial taxa and functional capacities associated with age and disease, classifying the vulvar microbiome at the individual level into skin-, vagina-, or multispecies mixture- dominant bacterial signatures, each with distinct functional capabilities. Further research is urgently needed to elucidate how these variations impact women’s overall health.
