What this study addss ○ LGBTQ+ clinical and cultural competency can be measured when clinician identity is not available to study LGBTQ+ patient experiences. ○ LGBTQ+ patient experiences vary widely. One third (34%) of LGBTQ+ patients reported affirming care, 60% reported neutral care, and 6% reported discriminatory care. ○ LGBTQ+ affirming patterns of patient experiences were associated with the highest levels of preventive services such as influenza vaccination, colorectal cancer screening, and HIV testing. 1 Introduction Healthcare‐based discrimination erodes trust, reduces engagement with health systems, and remains an acute challenge for LGBTQ+ (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning) populations [ 1 2 3 4 5 Meanwhile, LGBTQ+ midlife and older adults experience substantial health and healthcare inequities [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Strong patient‐clinician therapeutic relationships help patients make better decisions about what type of preventive services to receive [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 To date, no studies have tested the relationship of LGBTQ+ patient and clinician identity concordance. This research question remains challenging as no large‐scale datasets assess both patient and clinician sexual orientation or gender identity [ 25 26 27 28 What are your pronouns? Are you partnered? How does your partner identify?) Have you had opportunities to counsel and manage patients who may be good candidates for HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP)?) Using data from the Aging with Pride study ( n 29 Using baseline data from the longitudinal LGBTQ+ Social Network, Aging, and Policy Study (Q‐SNAPS), researchers found that older LGBTQ+ adults who reported that their clinician was LGBTQ+ affirming were more likely to receive recommended vaccinations, HIV testing, and colorectal cancer screening, were more likely to report better management of their chronic mental health conditions, and to report better understanding and belief in “ undetectable = untransmittable 28 30 The objectives of this study are to (1) identify patterns (latent classes) of LGBTQ+ patient experiences using seven indicators of clinical and cultural competency, (2) identify sociodemographic characteristics associated with patterns of care, and (3) assess the relationship between LGBTQ+ patient experiences and receipt of influenza vaccinations, colorectal cancer screenings, and HIV testing. 2 Methods 2.1 Data and Eligibility This observational cohort study followed STROBE reporting guidelines and used longitudinal data from Q‐SNAPS, a longitudinal study of LGBTQ+ adults aged 50–76 years living in Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and North Carolina. Wave I data ( n n 2.2 Measures 2.2.1 Clinical and Cultural Competence Measure Wave 2 of Q‐SNAPS included a 7‐item patient‐reported measure of their providers' clinical and cultural competence, or lack thereof, for working with LGBTQ+ patients. This measure was developed as part of a community‐engaged research drawing on interviews and cross‐sectional survey data from a single large city [ 31 Participants were asked “ Thinking about the time since the last survey [Wave I], about how often did you experience each of the following? Always Often Sometimes Rarely Never Not applicable, I did not have any healthcare appointments since the last survey I prefer not to answer I did not have any healthcare appointments since the last survey I prefer not to answer Always Often, Sometimes Rarely Never 32 S1 2.2.2 Preventive Service Outcome Measures We leveraged Q‐SNAPS' longitudinal panel design to link Wave I and Wave II using a unique participant identification key to assess receipt of preventive services. At Wave I, respondents were asked “ Have you ever had any of the following preventive care screenings or tests? Which of these tests or screenings have you had in the last 3 years? 2.3 Statistical Analysis We used latent class analysis, which provides a data‐driven approach for fitting observable characteristics (indicators) into indirectly measured (latent) sub‐groups. We used seven indicator variables to identify potential latent classes of LGBTQ+ patient experiences. Rather than measuring binary indicators of LGBTQ+ healthcare experiences (affirming or non‐affirming), we hypothesize that a subset of respondents experiences more complex patterns of experience (e.g., both explicitly affirming and discriminatory experiences with their clinician in a single visit or neither explicitly affirming or discriminatory experiences with their clinician). Identifying the appropriate number of latent classes relies on multiple statistical and theoretical approaches. One approach is to use statistical measures of goodness of fit such as Akaike information criterion (AIC) or Bayesian information criterion (BIC), both of which assess how well a statistical model fits the observed data as well as the proposed complexity of the model (increasing number of classes). A second type of statistical measure of goodness of fit is the Lo–Mendell–Rubin likelihood ratio test, which systematically tests whether the null hypothesis that a model of k k 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 After identifying the best fitting model, respondents are assigned to the class with the highest posterior probability. We then test the distribution of patient sociodemographic characteristics and class membership using Pearson's chi‐squared test. Lastly, we estimate the unadjusted marginal effects for each latent class on the receipt of preventive services using logistic regression to assess whether and how latent class assignment is associated with the receipt of recommended preventive healthcare. All analyses were conducted using Stata v17.0. This study was deemed non‐human subjects research by the Vanderbilt University Institutional Review Board. 3 Results 3.1 Goodness of Fit of Latent Class Models We first assessed goodness of fit using the AIC and BIC values and likelihood ratio test. Taken together, the 3‐class model has the best performance for the data. Using a 3‐class model, respondents were assigned to the class with the highest posterior probability, with 34% of the sample assigned to the Affirming class, 60% to the Neutral class, and 6% to the Discriminatory class.

Regarding negative healthcare experiences, 3% of the combined sample reported being asked invasive questions about their LGBTQ+ identity; 5% reported being told to seek care elsewhere; and 8% reported having to teach their clinician about LGBTQ+ people to get adequate care.

Table 3 p p p p 4 Discussion The present study used latent class analysis to describe patterns of LGBTQ+ patient experiences among a cohort of LGBTQ+ adults aged 50–76 years in the southern United States. In the overall sample, 34% of respondents reported LGBTQ+ friendly materials offered in the clinic, and 61% reported inclusive language in person and on paperwork. Regarding negative healthcare experiences, 3% of patients reported being asked invasive questions about their LGBTQ+ identity, 5% reported being told to seek care elsewhere, and 8% reported having to teach their clinician about appropriate care for LGBTQ+ people. Healthcare experiences within the sample varied widely, and latent class analysis results suggest that patients had three distinct patterns of LGBTQ+ patient experiences: (1) 34% of the sample had affirming care marked by high rates of positive experiences and low rates of negative experiences; (2) 60% of the sample had neutral care with low rates of positive and negative experiences; and (3) 6% of the sample had discriminatory care with low rates of positive experiences and high rates of negative experiences. In the absence of explicitly affirming care, LGBTQ+ patients reporting neutral or discriminatory care reported lower rates of 1 or more US Preventive Task Force recommended preventive services. By sample construction (at least one healthcare appointment since Wave I) the transgender and gender diverse respondents and respondents living with HIV likely represent patients who have successfully identified and established a therapeutic alliance with an affirming provider. Respondents living in Georgia and North Carolina were more likely to report affirming patterns of patient experiences, which may reflect institution‐level predictors of access to affirming care with more healthcare infrastructure. Drawing on supplemental data from the Human Rights Campaign's Healthcare Equality Index, we find that 11 health systems in Georgia and 32 in North Carolina were rated as top performers or leaders in LGBTQ+ health equity, compared to 5 in Tennessee and 4 in Alabama (See Table S1 Class membership significantly predicted unique differences in suboptimal receipt of preventive services. Compared to respondents with affirming care, respondents with neutral care were less likely to report lifetime or recent HIV testing. One explanation of this finding is that patients with neutral care include a larger share of cisgender women who may be missed by historical recommendations for HIV testing, which have historically focused on gay and bisexual men. The US Preventive Task Force recommends that all adolescents and adults aged 15–65 years be screened for HIV at least once, regardless of sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Outside of this age range, populations at higher risk for HIV infection (including adults older than 65) should continue to be screened. Key risk factors include condomless anal intercourse, condomless vaginal intercourse with 1 or more partners whose HIV status is unknown, and individuals who recently had sex with a partner who has recently been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection. Low prevalence of lifetime and recent HIV testing is of high concern, given that 19% of new HIV diagnoses occur among heterosexual contacts among females [ 40 41 Compared to respondents with affirming care, respondents with discriminatory care were less likely to have recently received a flu vaccination or a colorectal cancer screening. Interventions that reduce disparities in the receipt of preventive services in minoritized populations, including LGBTQ+ populations, reduce the overall strain on health and social resources (e.g., healthcare expenditures and short term disability) for the general population. When clinicians discriminate against LGBTQ+ people, not only do LGBTQ+ people avoid receiving preventive services (e.g., colorectal cancer screening) but society bears the burden of costly preventable disease (e.g., colorectal cancer). This study is subject to several limitations. Patient‐centered reports of clinical and cultural competence were assessed only during the period between Wave I and Wave II. This lookback period may not fully capture the relationship between lifetime experiences of healthcare discrimination, affirming patient–clinician relationships, and preventive service outcomes. Patients who experience severe discrimination prior to Wave I may have avoided care during the period between Wave I and Wave II, thus being ineligible for the present study. A second limitation is that the study sample is from the southern US and may not be representative of healthcare experiences of LGBTQ+ adults in other US regions. Despite this limitation, Q‐SNAPS remains the best data source available to address the proposed research question, given that it is the largest sample of LGBTQ+ adults in midlife and older age in the US with detailed information about clinical and cultural competency. Receipt of preventive services is self‐reported and may be subject to recall bias, leading to underestimates of actual receipt. However, the potential of recall bias for HIV testing and colorectal cancer screening is low due to the invasive nature (e.g., blood draw, colonoscopy) of these procedures. Receipt of HIV testing may be underreported as testing no longer requires consent and may be included with other labs conducted during routine primary care visits. Lastly, our measure of provider LGBTQ+ competency has not been previously validated. Existing validated measures of LGBTQ+ competency focus on pre‐licensure nursing curriculum [ 42 43 Our results underscore the benefits of affirming healthcare experiences for LGBTQ+ patients, including timely receipt of preventive services. Using a large, multi‐state sample of LGBTQ+ patients, we find that the minority of clinicians (5%) told LGBTQ+ patients to seek care elsewhere. Ongoing litigation asks whether or not clinicians can legally invoke conscientious objections to refuse care to LGBTQ+ patients if doing so constitutes a conflict of their religious or closely held beliefs [ 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 At the department level, clinical leaders should engage in conversations about barriers and facilitators of adopting LGBTQ+ competencies. For example, the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data in electronic health records is technologically feasible (fields can be added), but requests require buy‐in from administrators and clinicians. Large gaps remain in the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity information within electronic health records, posing a challenge to achieving LGBTQ+ health equity [ 53 At the institutional level, health system leaders should engage in systematic and sustained efforts to champion LGBTQ+ health equity. One framework for doing so is participation in the Human Rights Campaign's Healthcare Equality Index (HEI). The HEI is a structured toolkit for health systems to self‐assess the equity implications of policies and practices towards LGBTQ+ patients and staff. Sample performance goals of aligning policies and practices to advance LGBTQ+ health equity might include: “A re same‐sex partners who are not legally married permitted equal visitation rights as opposite‐sex partners? Does at least one health plan offered cover gender affirming healthcare services? 54 The Health Resources and Services Administration and the Joint Commission endorse efforts to monitor and address LGBTQ+ health disparities through the collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data [ 55 27 56 5 Conclusion We used latent class analysis to identify variation in LGBTQ+ patient experiences. Most patients reported neutral experiences, a small portion of LGBTQ+ patients reported explicitly discriminatory experiences, and approximately one‐third of patients reported that their clinician had LGBTQ+ affirming practices. In the absence of these explicitly affirming practices, LGBTQ+ patients were less likely to receive recommended preventive services such as lifetime HIV testing, a recent HIV test, flu vaccination, and recent colorectal cancer screening. Multi‐level approaches to increase access to LGBTQ+ affirming care are needed to advance LGBTQ+ population health equity. Conflicts of Interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
