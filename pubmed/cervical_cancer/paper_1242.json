Introduction According to GLOBOCAN, approximately 100,471 new cases of malignant tumors were reported in Romania in 2022, with the most common sites being the colorectum, breast, and lungs [ 1 2 In terms of histology, lung malignancies are divided based on the cells of origin into two major categories: non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC is an umbrella term that comprises a wide range of histological subtypes including lung adenocarcinoma (ADK), squamous-cell carcinoma (SQC), and large-cell carcinoma, each one with unique microscopic and molecular characteristics. In recent years, the incidence of ADK exceeded that of SQC, becoming the most frequent histologic subtype in industrialized countries [ 3 4 Despite recent technological advances in diagnostic procedures and treatments, most patients have a poor prognosis, especially because up to 75% of LC patients present with advanced stages at the time of diagnosis [ 5 On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic [ 6 In Romania, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the southwestern region of the country on 26 February 2020 [ 6 6 Although the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis of various solid tumors has been widely investigated, there are limited data in the literature specifically addressing the effects that pandemic-related delays in patients care had on new LC diagnosis. The aim of our study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on the number of newly diagnosed LC cases at a university hospital in Romania. Additionally, the study offers a comprehensive overview of the epidemiological trends and demographic features of patients diagnosed with LC based on small biopsy specimens within our institution. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Data Collection We performed a 5-year retrospective study including all lung biopsy specimens analyzed in the Pathology Department, Mureș County Clinical Hospital, Târgu Mureș, Romania, between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2022. The target population was divided into two cohorts based on the day when the Romanian government declared COVID-19 an emergency and implemented lockdown restrictions [ 6 Pre-COVID 19 cohort (1 January 2018–15 March 2020); COVID-19 cohort (16 March 2020–31 December 2022). Inclusion criteria were (1) a histopathological diagnosis consistent with a neoplastic lesion of the lung, herein including benign, premalignant, and malignant lesions, with malignant lesions accounting for the great majority of cases (LC), and (2) sufficient diagnostic material available on the biopsy specimen to enable a conclusive diagnosis. Lung biopsy cases that were inadequate (insufficient tissue sample or extensive necrosis) or corresponding to inflammatory lung lesions or reactive conditions were excluded from the analysis. All small lung biopsy specimens that fulfilled the adequacy criteria were included in the analysis. Patients were identified using their individual laboratory registration number. Demographic (age, gender) and pathological data were retrieved from institutional databases and pathological reports. The criteria of the STROBE checklist for observational studies were used in drafting the manuscript. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Mureș County Clinical Hospital, Târgu-Mureș (letter of approval no. 13/14.01.2023), and by the Ethics Committee of George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science, and Technology (letter of approval no. 2086/15.02.2023). Informed consent was obtained from all of the patients included in this study. 2.2. Pathological Data The histopathological diagnosis of various lung neoplasms was established based on their characteristic morphological features and immunohistochemical profiles, in accordance with the 2021 WHO Classification of Thoracic Tumors diagnostic criteria [ 7 LC histology was defined in accordance with the 2021 World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Thoracic Tumors [ 7 SCC ADK SCLC Our study included only histopathological data since information regarding molecular pathology (genetic mutations) were not available. 2.3. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using Epi Info version 7.2.0.1, GraphPad Prism version 10.5.0, and Microsoft Excel version 16.93. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the population groups. All data collected in the study were labeled as categorical variables (sex, histological subtype, grade of dysplasia) or quantitative variables (age, year). Nominal variables were summarized as counts and frequencies. The distributed continuous variables were expressed as mean +/− standard deviation (SD). The normal distribution of continuous variables was assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. The frequencies of the nominal and categorical variables were compared using the Chi-squared test, and subsequently, risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. We analyzed the data in a comparative way between two periods: pre-COVID-19 (1 January 2018–15 March 2020) and during the COVID-19 pandemic (16 March 2020–31 December 2022). To compare the change in distribution between the two cohorts, the Z test was applied. To assess associations, simple logistic regression models were fitted. The likelihood ratio test (LRT) was used to evaluate statistical significance. Odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were reported. Model fit was assessed using Tjur’s R squared. The analysis of the temporal trend variations of lung tumors (LTs) was performed using JOINPOINT version 5.3.0 software. We used annually collected LT incidence data for each gender and age category, which were age-adjusted based on population rates provided by the Romanian National Institute of Statistics. Subsequently, the software calculated the annual percentage change (APC) with 95% confidence intervals in order to identify significant trend variations. We categorized changes in quantitative variables as follows: mild (+/− 0–33.33%), moderate (+/− 33.34–66.66%), and marked (+/− 66.67–100%). The level of statistical significance was set at p p 3. Results 3.1. Patients’ Characteristics Out of the 1155 lung biopsy specimens registered in our department throughout the 5-year time frame (2018–2022), 750 (64.93%) cases fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were further considered in the analysis; 63.73% of cases ( n n Figure 1 The distribution of cases by gender, age, and histopathological diagnosis in the pre-COVID-19 versus COVID-19 period is illustrated in Table 1 Among the patients registered in the pre-COVID-19 group, the majority ( n n Table 1 n n Gender distribution revealed a similar pattern over the pandemic period (in the COVID-19 cohort), with men accounting for most of the cases ( n n n With regard to the male-to-female (M/F) ratio, the number of females remained relatively constant over the two study periods ( n n p p Table 1 3.2.

Discussion Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed cancer care and diagnosis and left a lasting impact on the global healthcare landscape. Romania, like every other country, had limited access to in-person care during the pandemic years, which affected patients’ ability to obtain proper and rapid cancer diagnosis [ 8 9 LC is a major public health concern that seriously threatens the health of the global population, particularly because it is oligosymptomatic until advanced stages [ 10 11 12 13 14 This current study focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic period on the time trend prevalence of pulmonary neoplasms in small biopsy specimens in a university hospital in Romania (Mures County Clinical Hospital), with special emphasis on the diagnosis of LC. Furthermore, we investigated the potential links between gender, age, and histologic subtypes, particularly NSCLC (SQC and ADK), SCLC, and lung metastases. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to investigate the clinico-pathological characteristics of LC in a Romanian cohort, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic period. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on new cancer diagnoses has been widespread and well documented across the globe. During the study period, we observed a downward trend in LC diagnoses, with a marked impact during the pandemic years. The greatest fluctuation in this trend occurred during the COVID-19 period (from 16 March 2020 to December 2022). Our findings indicate that disruptions in cancer care for Romanian patients due to pandemic-related restrictions led to a significant 72% decline in the diagnosis of new lung neoplasms during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, following this initial reduction, new diagnoses displayed an increase by 51% in the second pandemic year and by 83% in the third pandemic year, respectively. Similarly, research conducted in Italy, Canada, and the United States reported relevant decreases in LC incidence in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic (−48% in Italy; −34.7% in Canada; −75% in the United States) [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 Romania’s healthcare infrastructure (limited preventive medicine and restricted accessibility in underdeveloped regions), combined with insufficient logistic and strategic interventions (fewer screening programs), created major vulnerabilities. These factors, together with widespread public mistrust during the lockdown period, likely contributed to the pronounced decline in LC diagnoses observed during the pandemic. In contrast, other European countries with well-established and efficient patient–clinician communication strategies (like telemedicine and multiprofessional community health centers) [ 22 23 24 25 The decline in cancer diagnoses can be attributed to multiple factors, involving both patients and the healthcare system. Fear of contracting COVID-19 has limited patients’ access to medical services and decreased their willingness to report symptoms [ 26 27 28 29 Regarding histologic subtypes, SQC remains the most frequent subtype in our region, in line with previous studies across the country [ 30 31 3 5 32 33 We also explored how the incidence trends of different histologic subtypes of lung neoplasms have evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic. In line with the existing literature, we observed a reduction in new cases of SCLC, SQC, and ADK [ 9 29 p p Some possible explanations for the observed increase in NSCLC NOS cases during the pandemic period include the small size of biopsy samples (less than 1 mm), which often restricts immunohistochemistry panels to four or five markers (TTF1, CK7, p40, CK AE1/AE3, and CD56). The absence of molecular profiling may also have contributed to the rise in NSCLC NOS diagnoses. In addition, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related lung disease and sampling difficulties caused by infection prevention measures may have resulted in inadequate biopsy material and increased diagnostic uncertainty among pathologists. On the other hand, the sharp decline in lung metastases may be attributed to reduced screening programs and delays in diagnostic workups during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially resulting in more advanced stages of different types of solid tumors in the future. However, this hypothesis requires further investigation in future studies. In 2020, lung neoplasm cases declined in both sexes but this was more pronounced among males, resulting in a relative increase in female cases. This shift revealed a significant trend ( p 33 34 29 12 35 Several studies have reported associations between histological subtypes of LC and patients’ sex. These studies found that the SQC histology is more likely to appear in males while ADK tends to occur more frequently in females [ 35 36 37 p 33 38 Lung metastases are widely recognized for their poor prognosis in cancer patients. Chen et al. found that patients with synchronous lung metastasis were typically older males who had more advanced T- and N-stages at the time of diagnosis [ 39 40 p LC is typically diagnosed in adulthood, with our data showing that most cases occur in individuals over 50 years of age (94.1%). From these data, the highest number of patients fell within the 61–70 age range (43% of men and 40.1% of women). The average age at the time of diagnosis remained consistent before and during the pandemic years (pre-COVID-19: 65.51 ± 9.42 years; COVID-19: 65.59 ± 9.41 years). In a similar manner, at a global level, LC is being diagnosed in individuals over 60 years of age, with an average age at diagnosis of 70 years [ 38 30 31 Carcinogenesis represents a multistage process that requires a sequential accumulation of DNA alterations within cells as a result of exposure to intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors [ 41 42 Several limitations of our study should be acknowledged. This was a single-center study with a moderate sample size, relying solely on small tissue samples (excluding cytology, resection specimens, and inadequate biopsy samples (with extensive necrosis, insufficient tissue sample, inflammatory lung lesions, or reactive conditions)). Moreover, potential bias might have arisen from a higher-than-usual rate of inadequate biopsies, largely attributable to the learning curve of newly trained pulmonologists and the predominance of necrotic, nonviable tissue that precluded definitive diagnosis. Additionally, we did not incorporate molecular profiling (e.g., BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, MET, or NTRK), survival status, or tumor stage data into our analysis, so we could not directly evaluate the prognostic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different histologic and molecular subtypes of LC in our region. However, we have highlighted this as a priority for future research. 5. Conclusions Our data reveal that SQC remains the most frequent histologic subtype of LC diagnosed from biopsy specimens in our region. In our study group, most patients diagnosed with LC were men older than 60 years old. Nevertheless, recent years have seen a shift towards a relative increase in the number of cases among women, as a result of a sharp decline in male cases. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic impact on the Romanian healthcare system, causing delays in the diagnosis and treatment of oncologic patients, including those with LC. Following the implementation of lockdown restrictions in March 2020, new LC diagnoses dropped by 72% in the first year of the pandemic, then nearly doubled in the subsequent year. The long-term impact of this global event on LC patient outcomes remains to be seen and requires further confirmation through larger prospective studies.
