This study aimed to examine the association between social health and sexual self-care among women visiting comprehensive health service centers affiliated with Mashhad University of Medical Sciences. Methods In this descriptive-analytical study, 312 women were selected via multistage cluster sampling. Data were collected using Keyes et al.’s (2004) Social Well-being Questionnaire and Yazdani et al.’s (2023) Sexual Self-Care Questionnaire, followed by correlation analyses in SPSS-27. Results No significant correlation was observed between the overall scores of social health and sexual self-care ( P P P P P Conclusion The findings underscore the influence of distinct social health dimensions on women’s sexual self-care, particularly in mitigating risks related to cancer, STIs, and unintended pregnancy. These insights offer a foundation for integrated public health strategies and advocate for policy initiatives that incorporate social and health dimensions into sexual health promotion programs.

Mashhad is characterized by its diverse socioeconomic demographics and conservative societal norms, which influence women’s health-seeking behaviors. The study population consisted of women visiting comprehensive health service centers affiliated with Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (MUMS), a leading institution in public health research and services in northeastern Iran. In this study, after obtaining ethical approval and the necessary official permissions, the researchers approached eligible women at the selected comprehensive health service centers in coordination with the center administrators. The study objectives were clearly explained to the participants, and written informed consent was obtained. The questionnaires were administered in person in a private and secure environment and were completed through self-reporting. A trained researcher was present to clarify any questions the participants might have without influencing their responses. Confidentiality of all participant information was strictly maintained throughout the study. Sampling strategy and participants A multistage cluster random sampling approach was employed to ensure representativeness (shape 1). The sample size was determined using G*Power 3.1, assuming a small effect size ( r 1  Fig. 1 Sampling flow diagram (Source: Authors' own illustrations) Inclusion criteria included Eligible participants were:  - Aged 15–45 years. - Married and cohabiting with their spouse. - Non-pregnant and non-lactating. - Without a diagnosis of breast or uterine cancer. Exclusion criteria included:  - Unwillingness to continue participation. - Incomplete questionnaire responses. Data collection instruments 1- Sexual Self-Care Questionnaire (Yazdani et al., 2023), a 40-item tool assessing four domains:  - STD and genital infection prevention (14 items; score range: 14–70). - Cancer prevention (7 items; score range: 7–35). - Unwanted pregnancy prevention (6 items; score range: 6–30). - Sexual health promotion (13 items; score range: 13–65). Responses were recorded on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly disagree to 5 = Strongly agree), with a total score range of 40–200.Validity and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.94) were confirmed in Yazdani’s study. The Cronbach’s alpha value in the present study was) α = 0.83(.sample items for each of the subscales of the questionnaire is given below.  Subscale Sample Item STI Prevention “I use protection (e.g., condoms) during sexual intercourse.” Cancer Prevention “I perform regular breast self-examinations.” Unwanted Pregnancy Prevention “I discuss contraceptive methods with my partner.” Sexual Health Promotion “I seek medical advice when experiencing unusual genital symptoms.” 2- Keyes’ Social Well-being Questionnaire (2004), a 20-item instrument evaluating five dimensions: Social Integration, Social Acceptance, Social Participation, Social Actualization, Social Cohesion. Responses were also measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The scale’s validity and reliability were confirmed by Ahrari (2013). The Cronbach’s alpha value in the present study was (α = 0.80(.sample items for each of the subscales of the questionnaire is given below.  Subscale Sample Item Social Integration “I feel like a valued member of my community.” Social Acceptance “I believe most people are trustworthy.” Social Cohesion “My community collaborates well to address problems.” Social Actualization Society is progressing toward better conditions for all people.” Social Participation “I actively contribute to social groups or events in my neighborhood.” Data analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS-27. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) summarized participant characteristics, to examine the predictive role of social health dimensions on sexual self-care, multiple regression analysis was conducted. while Pearson’s correlation assessed relationships between social health dimensions and sexual self-care. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Ethical considerations The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (Code: IR.MUMS.FHMPM.REC.1403.187). Participants provided informed consent, and confidentiality was maintained throughout data collection and analysis. Results This cross-sectional study included 314 women recruited from comprehensive health centers in Mashhad, Iran. The mean age of participants was 34.56 ± 6.07 years, while their spouses averaged 38.43 ± 6.19 years. The mean marital duration was 11.56 ± 5.78 years, reflecting a stable, long-term partnership demographic.

Discussion This study explored the relationship between social health and sexual self-care among women in Mashhad, Iran. While overall social health did not significantly correlate with total sexual self-care, key sub-dimensions of social health (social cohesion, acceptance, participation, and actualization) were significantly associated with specific aspects of sexual self-care, including STD prevention, cancer prevention, and unwanted pregnancy prevention. Social cohesion and acceptance in STD prevention Social acceptance and social cohesion, as two core components of social health, facilitate sexual self-care by establishing normative, supportive, and educational frameworks. In societies where these characteristics are more evident, individuals are motivated to adhere to principles of sexual health (such as fidelity, STD prevention, and respect for relational boundaries) not merely due to fear of ostracism, but because of their sense of belonging and mutual responsibility. The positive correlation between social cohesion and STD prevention supports Keyes’ (1998) model, which posits that individuals embedded in cohesive communities are more likely to engage in health-protective behaviors due to shared norms and mutual accountability [ 21 22 23 24 Social participation and cancer prevention The significant association between social participation and cancer prevention can be explained through social capital theory [ 25 26 27 28 29 The significant association between social participation and cancer prevention can be explained through health psychology theories. Participation enhances access to health information [ 29 27 30 31 Social actualization and empowerment in sexual health Social actualization—reflecting optimism about societal progress—correlated with cancer prevention and unwanted pregnancy prevention, resonating with empowerment theories [ 27 30 31 32 Individuals who believe they can influence life outcomes and who perceive societal progress are more likely to engage in self-care behaviors [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 36 Sexual health-promoting behaviors—particularly multidimensional sexual self-care—are socially constructed and sustained through interpersonal and broader societal relational frameworks [ 38 39 40 25 The findings can be theoretically explained through positive role-enhancement models in societies such as Iran, discussions surrounding sexual issues are considered taboo due to prevailing cultural norms and societal values. As a result, open and comfortable expression on such topics—particularly in social and cultural contexts—is often limited or discouraged. Furthermore, religious beliefs, along with related legal and ethical considerations, can significantly influence both individual sexual experiences and the broader societal understanding of sexuality. Therefore, the study results indicate that key dimensions of social health - cohesion, participation, and acceptance - significantly influence women’s sexual self-care behaviors. Accordingly, we recommend the following practical interventions for Sexual Self-Care Promotion Community-based interventions Train respected female community leaders (e.g., teachers, midwives) to deliver stigma-free STI education in group settings (e.g., women’s health circles). - Couples’ Workshops Mosque Partnerships Development of educational podcasts/short videos on domestic platforms Partnership with female religious leaders to: - Deliver sermons linking self-care to Islamic values of wellness.  Provider Training Programs: Mandatory sensitivity training for clinicians on: Non-judgmental sexual history taking Trauma-informed care approaches Cultural competency in conservative contexts Certification programs for sexual health counselors at primary care centers Strengths and limitations The key strengths and methodological limitations of this study are presented separately in the following sentences: Strengths Culturally contextualized insights This study addresses a critical gap in sexual health research by examining social health dimensions in Iran, a conservative setting where such topics are often stigmatized. The findings provide valuable insights for designing culturally sensitive interventions. Robust sampling strategy The use of multistage cluster sampling across diverse health centers in Mashhad enhances the representativeness of the sample, strengthening the generalizability of results to urban women in similar socio-religious contexts. Validated instruments The study employs psychometrically validated tools (Keyes' Social Well-being Questionnaire and Yazdani’s Sexual Self-Care Questionnaire), adapted and tested for reliability in the target population (Cronbach’s α = 0.80–0.94), ensuring measurement accuracy. Multidimensional analysis By dissecting social health into distinct dimensions (e.g., cohesion, acceptance), the study reveals nuanced associations with specific self-care behaviors (e.g., STI prevention), offering actionable levers for targeted public health programs. Policy-relevant recommendations The practical interventions proposed—such as community-based education and provider training—are grounded in empirical data and align with WHO’s call for integrating social determinants into sexual health initiatives. Limitations Cross-sectional design The study’s design precludes causal inferences. Longitudinal research is needed to establish temporal relationships between social health and sexual self-care behaviors. Sampling constraints Participants were recruited from health centers affiliated with a university, potentially excluding marginalized groups (e.g., rural populations, unmarried women) due to cultural and institutional barriers. Future studies should expand recruitment to non-clinical settings. Self-report bias Social desirability bias may have influenced responses, particularly for sensitive topics like sexual health. Triangulation with qualitative methods (e.g., interviews) could mitigate this limitation. Instrument applicability While the Keyes scale was validated in Persian, its Western origins may not fully capture culturally specific facets of social health in Iran. Developing indigenous tools could improve conceptual alignment. Unmeasured confounders Key variables (e.g., reproductive history, religiosity) were not assessed, which might influence sexual self-care. Future work should incorporate these factors to refine predictive models. Conclusion Women’s sexual self-care is intricately linked to contextual social factors, particularly acceptance and participation. While holistic social health may not directly predict sexual self-care, targeted social empowerment initiatives—such as strengthening community networks and fostering inclusive health policies could enhance women’s engagement in preventive behaviors. These findings underscore the need for multilevel interventions that integrate social determinants into sexual health promotion strategies, aligning with global efforts to achieve gender-equitable health outcomes.
