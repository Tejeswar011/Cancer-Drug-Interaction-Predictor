Noninvasive imaging like immuno-positron emission tomography (PET) offers the potential for visualizing immune dynamics within glioblastoma, potentially aiding in patient selection and treatment monitoring. This systematic review evaluates immuno-PET tracers currently under investigation for the noninvasive visualization of the immune environment in glioblastoma. Methods A literature search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science up to March 2025, using keywords related to glioblastoma, immuno-PET, immune compartments, and specific tracers. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on the development, characterization, or application of immuno-PET tracers targeting immune cells or immune checkpoint molecules in glioblastoma. Results Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria, exploring tracers targeting immune checkpoints and immune cell populations. Full-length antibodies demonstrated higher tumor specificity and retention compared to smaller fragments but showed longer circulation times. Peptide-based tracers and affibodies offered improved pharmacokinetics with rapid clearance and lower nonspecific uptake but encountered hurdles in ensuring adequate tumor targeting and retention. Advancements included dual-modal tracers combining PET and near-infrared fluorescence imaging for enhanced diagnostic and intraoperative applications. Conclusions Significant progress has been made in developing immuno-PET tracers for noninvasive visualization of immune reactions in glioblastoma. Challenges persist in clinical translation due to issues like blood–brain barrier permeability and safety profiles. Continued research and clinical evaluations are essential to harness the potential of immuno-PET in improving glioblastoma diagnosis, assessment of treatment response, and guiding personalized immunotherapy strategies, ultimately aiming to enhance patient outcomes. brain tumors glioma immuno-PET immunotherapy immune imaging German Research Foundation 10.13039/501100001659 Research Training Group 2375 331065168 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Key Points Immune environment imaging may guide personalized immunotherapy in glioblastoma. Current PET tracers address nonoverlapping aspects of tumor–immune interactions. Imaging of distinct immune targets may enhance patient risk stratification. Importance of the Study Significant progress has been made in developing immuno-PET tracers for noninvasive visualization of immune reactions in glioblastoma. Overall, the breadth of immuno-PET tracers now being investigated—ranging from PD-L1-directed agents to those targeting CD8, CD4, or CD11b—addresses critical, nonoverlapping aspects of tumor–immune interactions. By merging advanced tracer design with improved blood–brain-barrier-disrupting technologies, noninvasive imaging of distinct immune targets may enhance nuanced patient risk stratification and selection. In addition, immune compartment visualization with PET imaging may guide treatment response evaluation and help to adapt personalized immunotherapeutic regimens to maximize efficacy in this complex and refractory disease. Glioblastoma is the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, known for its rapid growth, high invasiveness, and dismal prognosis, with median overall survival times remaining below two years despite the implementation of aggressive multimodal treatment, including maximal safe surgical resection and radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with alkylating agents. 1 2 3 4 5 6–9 6–8 10–12 13 Taken together, this underscores the necessity for a deeper understanding of immune compartment dynamics within the glioblastoma tumor microenvironment. Establishing techniques for noninvasive visualization of the immune environment in glioblastoma is crucial for developing effective immunotherapies, selecting suitable patient populations for these therapeutic regimens and thereby enhancing patient outcomes. Noninvasive imaging modalities, particularly positron emission tomography (PET), have the potential to elucidate the complex interplay between immune cells and glioblastoma cells. Immuno-PET leverages radiolabeled antibodies, antibody fragments, and peptides to target specific immune markers, thereby enabling the real-time quantitative assessment of target expression levels, immune cell infiltration, activation, and distribution within tumors. A series of PET tracers is currently under development, each designed to visualize distinct aspects of target expression, immune environment, and response in glioblastoma. Moreover, advancements in tracer design, including the development of dually functionalized agents that combine PET imaging with near-infrared fluorescence capabilities, are enhancing the specificity and utility of immuno-PET in both diagnostic and intraoperative settings. 14 15 This systematic review aims to evaluate the immuno-PET tracers currently under investigation for the noninvasive visualization of the immune environment of glioblastoma. By categorizing tracers based on their molecular targets, structural formats, and functional capabilities, strengths, and limitations of each approach are reviewed, highlighting advancements in tracer design and delivery. Furthermore, it explores the translational potential of these tracers in clinical settings, discusses how improved visualization of immune compartments can aid patient selection, assess treatment responses, and ultimately contribute to the development of more effective, personalized immunotherapeutic strategies for patients with glioblastoma. Methods Search Strategy A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies relevant to the noninvasive visualization of immune status and reactions in glioblastoma PET tracers. The following electronic databases were systematically searched from inception until March 2025: PubMed and Web of Science. The search strategy employed a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and keyword phrases related to glioblastoma, immuno-PET, immune compartments, and specific tracers. The primary search terms included “glioblastoma,” “glioma,” “PET,” “immune-PET,” “immuno-PET,” “immune compartments,” “imaging,” combinations thereof and specific tracer names identified in preliminary screenings. Boolean operators (AND, OR) were used to refine the search results. Additionally, reference lists of relevant articles were hand-searched to identify any supplementary studies not captured in the initial database search. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Studies were included in the systematic review if they met the following criteria: Population: Preclinical (animal models) and clinical studies involving subjects with glioma/glioblastoma. Intervention: Utilization of PET tracers designed to visualize immune compartments or immune responses within glioblastoma. Outcomes: Studies reporting on the development, characterization, or application of immuno-PET tracers targeting immune cells (eg, T-cells) or immune checkpoint molecules (eg, PD-1, PD-L1) in the context of glioblastoma. Study Design: Experimental studies, including both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models, as well as clinical trials. Studies were excluded if any of the following criteria were met: Non-English Language: Articles not published in English. Study Type: Reviews, editorials, commentaries, case reports, and conference abstracts. Population: Studies focusing on cancers other than glioblastoma. Intervention: Use of imaging modalities other than PET/CT or PET/MRI or tracers not specifically targeting immune compartments. Outcomes: Studies not reporting relevant imaging outcomes or lacking sufficient data on tracer performance in immune visualization. Study Selection All articles retrieved from the initial search were exported into reference management software (EndNote), and duplicates were removed. Subsequently, titles and abstracts of the remaining articles were screened to assess their eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies that potentially met the criteria or had unclear relevance were subjected to full-text review. A PRISMA flow diagram was constructed to illustrate the study selection process, including the number of articles identified, screened, eligible, and included in the review, along with reasons for exclusion at each stage. Data Synthesis Given the heterogeneity of the included studies in terms of imaging agents, cancer types, study designs, and outcome measures, a meta-analysis was not feasible. Instead, a narrative synthesis approach was adopted. The extracted data were organized thematically based on molecular targets of the tracers. Results Literature Selection A comprehensive search yielded ten studies that met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review, encompassing both preclinical and clinical investigations of immuno-PET tracers for the noninvasive visualization of immune reactions in glioblastoma. These studies collectively explored a series of tracers targeting distinct immune compartments, including programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), CD69, CD8, and TIGIT, utilizing diverse molecular formats such as full-length antibodies, antibody fragments, affibodies, peptides, and dual-modal conjugates. Visualizing Immune Target Expression on Tumor Cells PD-L1 targeting tracers. —Recent advancements in molecular imaging have focused on improving the noninvasive visualization of PD-L1 in glioblastoma. PD-L1 is a critical immune checkpoint implicated in antitumor immune responses. High PD-L1 expression is associated with greater aggressiveness and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells and tumors with mesenchymal features seem to have increased PD-L1 levels and higher percentages of tumor-associated macrophages. 16 15 17–21 Figure 1 Figure 1.

While affibody molecules like 18 PD-L1 18 Visualizing Target Expression on Tumor-Infiltrating Immune Cells While the studies mentioned above focus on visualization of an immune checkpoint present on tumor cells, it is also possible to image immune cells such as effector T-cells infiltrating tumor tissues. As these cells are key players in antitumor immune responses and tumor eradication, visualizing the infiltration of these cells into the tumor may be very valuable for therapeutic assessment. CD8 targeting. —Cytotoxic CD8-positive T-cells play an essential role in antitumor immune responses through the release of effector molecules including cytokines, perforin, and granzyme B. 22 23 24 25–27 In brain tumors, Nagle et al. developed a 64 28 Gallegos et al. evaluated [ 89 29 89 Figure 2 89 89 Figure 2.

CD4 targeting. —Compared to CD8-positive T-cells, the contribution of specific CD4-positive T-cell subsets in antitumor immune responses has not been characterized in detail so far. 30–32 33 34 35 36 37 38 Nagle et al. evaluated the humanized anti-CD4 minibody, [ 64 30 64 64 CD11b targeting. —Glioblastomas are known to be heavily infiltrated by tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs). 39 40 Nigam et al. evaluated a 89 40 CD69 targeting. —CD69, a C-type lection protein, is one of the cell surface proteins expressed earliest by activated lymphocytes. 41 42 18 43 18 In addition, the potential of CD69 as a biomarker of ICI response in patients with glioblastoma was assessed.

While many studies have focused on different tracer formats—full-length antibodies, minibodies, peptides, affibodies—to quantify targets such as PD-L1, CD8, or CD69, the underlying rationale for imaging these varied immune pathways and cell types is also critical. noninvasive visualization of targets like PD-L1 (present on tumor and immune cells), CD4/CD8 (on T-cell subsets), CD11b (on myeloid-lineage cells), CD69 (on early activated T-cells), and OX40 or TIGIT (as co-stimulatory/co-inhibitory checkpoint molecules) provides a window into multiple facets of the glioma immune reaction, offering richer insights than tumor-centered imaging alone. Rationale for Imaging Different Immune Targets Imaging immune checkpoints such as PD-L1 or TIGIT is particularly useful for determining whether and when tumors rely on these inhibitory pathways to evade cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. By contrast, visualizing effector T-cells themselves via CD8 or even CD4 can directly show the presence, distribution, and infiltration of these critical antitumor populations. In this context, imaging CD8-positive T-cells can help clinicians predict which glioblastomas are likely to respond to CD8-focused immunotherapeutics, while simultaneously ensuring that T-cell infiltration is robust enough to warrant treatments like immune checkpoint inhibitors. Visualizing CD4-positive T-cells, including helper and Treg populations, delivers complementary information about the broader immune landscape. As regulatory T-cells and helper T-cells exert profound effects on tumor immunity and therapy outcomes, noninvasive quantification of these subsets could enable early assessment of immune-mediated resistance or synergy with combination treatments. Similarly, tracers like anti-CD11b enable the localization and quantification of TAMCs, which are a substantial immunosuppressive force in the glioblastoma microenvironment. Monitoring these cells noninvasively could inform interventions targeting myeloid-derived cells, a strategy that may enhance or modulate T-cell-centered therapies in patients. Additionally, imaging of early activation markers such as CD69 or co-stimulatory molecules such as OX40 can capture dynamic facets of the T-cell activation cycle and help tailor immunotherapy schedules. In essence, each immune marker addresses a different question: Do tumors overexpress inhibitory ligands like PD-L1? Are T-cells present and abundant (CD4/CD8)? Are myeloid cells dominating (CD11b)? Are T-cells fully activated (CD69/OX40)? Molecular Format Considerations The reviewed studies underscore how full-length antibodies often provide high tumor retention and specific binding at the cost of longer circulation times, potentially higher off-target accumulation, and concerns regarding radiation dose. In parallel, smaller formats—including minibodies, affibodies, peptides—exhibit desirable pharmacokinetics, faster clearance, and enable earlier imaging time points, though they may exhibit shorter tumor retention or reduced affinity. For imaging complex immune processes, these differences matter significantly: short-lived tracers may capture acute immune changes (eg, transient expression of activation markers), whereas longer-lived antibodies can accumulate over time and highlight sustained immunological phenomena such as persistent checkpoint expression or myeloid infiltration. Enhancing Delivery to the Brain Even optimized formats face limitations in assessing the typically heterogeneous blood–brain barrier integrity and accessing infiltrative tumor regions that are often protected by an intact blood–tumor barrier. Studies deploying focused ultrasound to disrupt these barriers, as showcased in a subset of articles, suggest that precisely timed barrier disruption can increase tracer uptake within glioblastoma tissue. This strategy can broaden the scope of immune markers imaged, as previously suboptimally distributed tracers (eg, large IgGs) may now enter tumor regions more effectively. Future Directions Future investigations should expand beyond single-target imaging. Given that immune compromise in glioblastoma involves multiple cell populations—cytotoxic T-cells, helper T-cells, Tregs, tumor-associated macrophages, and others—parallel or multiplexed imaging of these various compartments could generate more comprehensive data. Such approaches could guide combination immunotherapies targeting different arms of the immune system (eg, checkpoint blockade plus macrophage depletion), revealing synergy or antagonism. In addition, systematically assessing how tracer binding changes over time throughout disease progression is crucial to accurately capture shifts in target expression and immune infiltration. Additionally, clinical trials evaluating these tracers in patients must consider safety profiles, scaling of tracer doses, and regulatory pathways. Verifying how well immuno-PET correlates with histopathological measurements of the same immune populations in resected samples will be key for validation. Finally, dual or even triple tracer protocols (eg, PD-L1 combined with CD8 or CD4 imaging) could offer more nuanced insight into the interactions among different immune pathways, potentially leading to improved patient stratification and treatment guidance. Conclusion Overall, the breadth of immuno-PET tracers now being investigated—ranging from PD-L1-directed agents to those targeting CD8, CD4, or CD11b—addresses critical, nonoverlapping aspects of tumor–immune interactions. By merging advanced tracer design with improved BBB-disrupting technologies, noninvasive imaging of distinct immune targets may enhance more nuanced patient risk stratification, the assessment of treatment response, and help to adapt personalized immunotherapeutic regimens to maximize efficacy in this complex and refractory disease.
