Thus, this study aims to construct a stable and effective mouse model of TPN and EN for relevant studies. Material and methods The animal study was approved by the Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (IACUC Issue No. WDRM-20020401A). Animals ICR male specific-pathogen-free mice, aged 8 weeks and weighing 22–25 g, were provided by the Animal Experimental Center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University. The mice were housed under controlled humidity, temperature, and lighting conditions. They were allowed to acclimate for 5 days before experimentation and then randomly allocated to receive either EN via enteral nutritional suspension (TPF; N N Surgery The mice were anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane and oxygen (1%−3% concentration used, 5% concentration during the induction period). Under aseptic conditions, a laparotomy was performed through a lower midline incision measuring 3 cm. The abdominal wall was retracted with tissue holding forceps, and the right lower abdomen was explored; the cecum was lifted to the incision. The cecal tract was clamped with two separate hemostatic forceps, and the tract was cut short between the hemostatic forceps and ligated separately. Approximately 1 cm from the end of the cecum, the cecum was compressed with hemostatic forceps. The cecum was transected 0.2 cm from the distal end after ligation with a silk thread along the pressed area, and the severed end was disinfected. TPN model The protocol was based on previous studies, with some modifications ( 13 15 The right cervical region was disinfected, and a vertical median incision was made approximately 1 cm above the clavicle. The incision measured approximately 1 cm in length. The right submandibular gland was identified, and the lateral tissue of the submandibular gland was bluntly separated. The right jugular vein was then identified and carefully isolated. Three 4-0 silk sutures were placed under the jugular vein and marked as No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, respectively, starting from the proximal end ( Figure 1a Figure 1b Figure 1 Placement and fixation of central venous catheters. The right jugular vein was identified and skeletally isolated. Three 4-0 silk wires were wrapped under the jugular vein and marked as No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, respectively, starting from the proximal end (a) (b) Two-panel image showing surgical exposure in a small animal model. Panel (a) shows numbered regions of tissue with a surgical clamp holding it. Panel (b) shows the same view with sutures visible, indicating further progression in the surgical procedure. Both panels reveal incised and manipulated tissue areas, likely for research or experimental purposes. Fixed catheter: a section of fine suture was threaded into the distal end of the catheter, and then the other end of the fine suture was threaded subcutaneously from the neck of the mouse to the back and then to the tail. The catheter was pulled through the tail to ensure there were no wrinkles. The mouse's tail was fixed onto the foam pad or the iron sheet. The fine suture was withdrawn, and the syringe was connected to the catheter in order to draw blood smoothly. Incision handling The incision was sutured in two layers—the tendon of the platysma myroides layer and the skin—using 4-0 silk thread, and the area was then cleaned with 75% ethanol. Postoperative care The mice were placed in clean mouse cages and kept warm on a 37 °C warming table. The jugular vein catheter was connected to a multichannel infusion pump delivering intravenous injection of TPN at a rate of 0.167 ml/h ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Mode chart of the total parenteral nutrition (TPN) device in mice. The catheter was threaded subcutaneously from the neck of the mouse along the back to the tail, where the tail was fixed onto the pallet. The mice were then placed into clean cages, and the catheter was connected to a multichannel micro-pump for TPN.

EN model After anesthesia, the abdominal cavity was entered layer by layer through a median incision in the upper abdomen, and the mouse stomach was identified using atraumatic forceps, and a ~0.3 cm stoma was made on the side of the greater curvature of the stomach near the pylorus. A medical silicone tube (Silastic 60-011-05) was inserted and gently advanced about 2 cm into the upper duodenum. After confirming the absence of slippage, a purse-string suture was made at the gastrostomy. Then the silicone tube was reinforced with an additional suture on the abdominal wall muscle. Parenteral and enteral nutrition All mice were maintained for 7 days after surgery. Mice assigned to the TPN group receive a continuous infusion of TPN solution, starting at 0.25 ml/h (first day of infusion, 6 ml/day) and thereafter increasing to 0.3 ml/h (second and third days of infusion, 7.2 ml/day), then 0.32 ml/h (fourth through seventh days of infusion, 7.7 ml/day). Enteral nutrition suspension (TPF) was administered via gastrostomy catheter ( 16 Dosage information The dose in TPN was determined based on nutritional requirements, including protein (provided as an amino acid solution, 4 kcal/g) and non-protein calorie-providing macronutrients such as carbohydrates (supplied as glucose, 3.4 kcal/g) and lipids (supplied as a lipid emulsion, ≈10 kcal/g). The total calories provided by the TPN solution were calculated by summing the calories from non-protein and protein sources. Mice in the TPN group received an isocaloric solution (150 kcal/100 ml; Table 1 Table 1 TPN formulation.  Nutrient source  Amount per 100 ml Amino acids (Aminoven 15%, Fresenius Kabi) 32 ml (4.8 g protein) Glucose (70%) 44.5 ml (31.2 g sugar) Lipids (Intralipid 20%, Fresenius Kabi) 12 ml (2.4 g fat) Trace elements (Addaven, Fresenius Kabi) 0.5 ml Multivitamins (Addamel, Fresenius Kabi) 0.1 ml Euthanasia and dissection All animals were euthanized using 20% CO 2 Sample analysis Tissue samples were fixed in formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to assess intestinal histology. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) were performed on intestinal tissues fixed in 10% formalin. The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) abundance was assessed by immunofluorescence (IF), lysozyme, ZO-1, and occludin were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Evaluation and semi-quantitative analysis of IHC detection were conducted using ImageJ software. The average gray value (staining intensity) of positive cells and the percentage of positive area (staining area) were jointly used as the measurement indicators of IHC, and finally, four scores were given: high positive (3+), positive (2+), low positive (1+), and negative (0). Goblet cell counts were assessed using Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 25.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The data all show a normal distribution. Statistical analyses were performed as follows: the experiment was repeated at least three times, and the experimental data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD), with comparisons between two groups using Student's t P Results General description The weight of the mice was recorded before the start of the study and after the mice were euthanized. In the TPN group, the weights at the beginning and end of the study were 23.9 ± 1.7 g and 24.1 ± 1.6 g, respectively. In the EN group, the corresponding values were 24.0 ± 1.9 g and 24.5 ± 1.6 g ( P TPN leads to intestinal villus atrophy The intestinal tissue was stained with HE, and the height of intestinal villi was measured. The results demonstrated that the height of intestinal villi in the TPN group was significantly reduced compared to the EN group ( P Figure 3 Figure 3 Representative image of harvested intestine from enteral nutrition (EN) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) mice. The height of the intestinal villi was measured. TPN leads to intestinal villus atrophy.

Panels a and b represent the EN group with scale bars of one hundred millimeters and fifty millimeters, respectively. Panels c and d depict the TPN group, with the same scale bars. Additionally, a bar graph (e) illustrates villus height comparisons between EN and TPN groups, showing significantly higher measurements in the EN group. TPN reduces intestinal proliferation The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) abundance was assessed by immunofluorescence (IF). It was found that the abundance of PCNA was significantly lower in the TPN group compared to the EN group ( P Figure 4 Figure 4 Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunofluorescence staining was performed to measure IEC proliferation. TPN leads to diminished proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). Proliferation index was calculated as the ratio of PCNA-positive cell number to total cell number in each crypt; EN group (a, b) (a) (b) (c, d), (c) (d) (e) P Immunofluorescence images labeled “PCNA” depict stained samples, with panels a and b from the TPN group showing magnifications at 100 mm and 50 mm scale bars. Panels c and d from the EN group have similar scale bar measurements. A bar chart labeled “e” compares PCNA+ cell numbers between the EN and TPN groups, showing significantly higher values in the EN group (P < 0.001). TPN causes a decrease in the number of intestinal goblet cells After glycogen PAS staining, the cells were observed under light microscopy. The cells stained with red glycogen could be seen as goblet cells under high magnification. Three regions were chosen randomly to calculate the number of goblet cells and compared. The results showed that the number of goblet cells in the TPN group was significantly lower than in the EN group ( P Figure 5 Figure 5 PAS was performed to measure the number of intestinal goblet cells. TPN causes a decrease in the number of intestinal goblet cells.

A bar graph labeled e displays significantly higher PAS+ cell counts in the EN group compared to the TPN group, with asterisks indicating statistical significance. TPN causes a decreased function of intestinal Paneth cells Under light microscopy, there was no significant difference in the number of Paneth cells between the two groups. The Lysozyme+ cells in the EN group had more intensely stained granules, which were immune complexes of lysozyme proteins, while the mice in the TPN group had fewer granules and were significantly lighter in color than the control group ( P Figure 6 Figure 6 Lysozyme immunohistochemical was performed to measure the function of intestinal Paneth cells.

A bar graph labeled e compares the lysozyme IHC score between EN and TPN groups, indicating a higher score for EN, with statistical significance noted by an asterisk. TPN disrupts tight junctions between intestinal epithelia The epithelial tight junction (TJ) complex serves as a key structure of intestinal EBF, which keeps the intestinal epithelial cells tightly bound to each other and forms a selectively permeable membrane ( 10 17 18 19 Figures 7 8 Figure 7 Occludin immunohistochemical was performed to measure the intestinal epithelial tight junction (TJ).

Discussion and future directions The intestinal epithelium is characterized by rapid renewal, with IECs undergoing complete renewal every 4–5 days ( 20 21 17 22 Table 2 Table 2 Expression of PCNA, lysozyme+, ZO-1, occludin, and PAS+ between the EN group and TPN group.

The origin of the infection is likely to be related to intestinal flora displacement due to postoperative intestinal barrier damage. After the completion of the modeling process, we demonstrated that TPN may cause a reduction of small intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and impaired intestinal barrier function when compared with EN. Therefore, this study provides a complete, reliable, and optimized mouse model of the effects of TPN and EN on intestinal mucosal barrier function. Conclusion In this study, we focused on the mold-making process and detailing methodology, using mice to study the effects of TPN and EN on intestinal barrier function. The results presented a high success rate in model establishment and consistent experimental outcomes, largely due to the practical advantages of mice, including their availability and ease of handling. Therefore, using mice as animal models for TPN and EN research is worth promoting in future studies exploring the impact of TPN on intestinal barrier function.
