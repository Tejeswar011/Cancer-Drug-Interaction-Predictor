They express multiple calcium buffering proteins. Extracellular calcium is essential for recycling of synaptic‐like vesicles (SLVs) in the terminals and for the stretch‐evoked inward calcium current of the receptor potential. Conversely, removal of calcium from the extracellular medium abolishes stretch‐evoked action potentials (APs). However, the calcium channel(s) involved and mechanism(s) of action are unknown. This study begins identifying the channels involved and their actions.

However, the channels and mechanism(s) of action involved are unclear. Here we explore a range of options for what role(s) calcium might play. The primary endings of mammalian muscle spindles and their Ia axons form the afferent part of the monosynaptic motor reflex, being identified as afferent end‐organs in the 19th century (Ruffini, 1898 1894 1976 1978 1990 1990 1992 1995 1998 2004 2000 2002 Although removal of extracellular calcium in the continued presence of sodium has no effect on the receptor potential, action potential (AP) firing is quickly abolished if extracellular calcium is removed or is replaced with cobalt to block calcium channels (Bewick et al., 2005 1991 2005 2021 2005 1988 1999 1996 v 2002 VGCCs have three major families: high‐voltage activated (HVA) dihydropyridine‐sensitive (L‐type, Ca v v v 1 https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/ v 2002 2007 2005 v 2007 2004 v 2004 v 2002 v 2006 1985 2023 2015 ex vivo TABLE 1 Nomenclature of voltage‐gated calcium channels (VGCC), calcium‐activated potassium channels (K Ca Non‐IUPHAR IUPHAR Toxins/ligands used in this study a Voltage‐gated calcium channels L‐type Ca v Nifedipine, TaiCatoxin P/Q‐type Ca v ω‐agatoxin‐IVA (s), ω‐conotoxin‐MVIIC N‐type Ca v ω‐conotoxin‐GVIA (s), ω‐conotoxin‐MVIIC Calcium‐activated potassium channels BK K Ca Iberiotoxin (s), charybdotoxin, NS1619 (s, ag)  SK1 SK2 SK3  K Ca K Ca K Ca Apamin, TaiCatoxin IK K Ca TRAM‐34 (s), charybdotoxin Transient receptor potential channels All TRPs 2‐APB TRPV1 Capsaicin (s, ag) TRPV2 Tranilast (s), 2‐APB (ag) TRPV3 Carvacrol (s, ag) TRPV4 RN1734 (s), GSK1016790A (s, ag)  a https://www.guidetopharmacology.org/ John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. In addition to SLV recycling, other targets for intracellular calcium are calcium‐activated potassium channels. There are at least two potassium permeabilities contributing to the sensory terminal receptor potential. One is sensitive and the other insensitive to tetraethylammonium (TEA) (Hunt et al., 1978 Ca Ca 2006 2003 1998 2004 2000 1991 2008 Ca 2005 Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca 2003 1998 Ca Ca 2024 Ca Here we present physiological and pharmacological evidence for several different major roles for calcium in muscle spindles, which would correlate with the need for extensive calcium buffering. These include Ca v Ca Ca Ca v Ca v 2 METHODS 2.1 Ethical approval Experiments were performed in compliance with Experimental Physiology ex vivo 2 2.2 Animals and dissection Adult Sprague–Dawley rats (75 male for electrophysiology, 4 female for FM1‐43 labelling; 250–480 g) were used. Specific numbers for each experimental group are given when each result is presented. Fourth lumbrical nerve–muscle preparations from both hind paws and saphenous nerves from the hind legs were dissected, cleaned and mounted in silicone rubber‐lined (Sylgard, Dow Corning, Stade, Germany) culture dishes under constantly carbogenated (95% O 2 2 3 2 4 2 1956 2.3 Drug preparation Final concentrations of VGCC blockers ω‐agatoxin‐IVA (P/Q‐type; Sigma‐Aldrich, Gillingham, UK), ω‐conotoxin‐MVIIC (N‐ and P‐type), and ω‐conotoxin‐GVIA (N‐type; Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan), K Ca 2.4 Electrophysiology Nerve–muscle preparations were maintained and electrophysiological recordings of stretch‐evoked responses were performed as detailed previously (Bewick et al., 2005 2010 2009 2005 2016 The purely sensory composition of the saphenous nerve and its great length made it a suitable subject for compound action potential (CAP) measurements, which tested the drugs for nerve conduction block. While it does not contain muscle spindle afferents, it is a preparation suitable for testing for generalised effects on sensory neuron AP amplitude and conduction. The maximum available length of the rat saphenous nerve was excised and placed under carbogenated Liley's saline. Stimulation was applied at one end with a suction electrode, then the CAP was recorded en passant 2010 2.5 FM1‐43 labelling Sensory terminal labelling of rat lumbrical muscle spindles with FM1‐43, to study SLV endo‐ and exocytosis, was performed as previously described (Bewick et al., 2005 2 2 2.6 Data analysis Experiments and data analysis were not undertaken under blinded conditions. 2.6.1 Electrophysiology For Figures 1 2 3 2005 2016 2010 4 5 2016 https://github.com/cgiuraniuc/Spindle-Firing-Analysis.git 1 2 3 t P FIGURE 1 Ca v v n n n P n P n P FIGURE 2 Ca v n P P Ca n P P P FIGURE 3 K Ca n P n P n P n P n P FIGURE 4 Broad‐spectrum TRP antagonist and TRPV1–V3 ligands block stretch‐evoked firing.

They were imported into Photoshop CS2 (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA), to enable a pair of maximal intensity white marker dots to be added for subsequent line‐scan analysis using Fiji ( https://imagej.net/software/fiji/ 2c 3 RESULTS 3.1 Voltage‐gated Ca 2+ Given that sensory terminals rely on the release of glutamate from SLVs to maintain their stretch‐sensitivity, and that vesicle recycling at synapses typically is regulated by VGCCs, we first investigated the importance of the HVA Ca 2+ v v v 1 3.2 N‐ and P/Q‐type VGCC blocker increases spindle afferent firing To determine if Ca v v 1994 n P 1 P 3.3 N‐type VGCC blocker has no effect on spindle afferent firing To determine if it is the Ca v 1986 1987 1994 1 n P v 3.4 Selective P/Q‐type VGCC blockers greatly increase afferent firing We therefore next tested directly for the role of Ca v 1993 1 1994 n P P P 1 v 3.5 P/Q‐type voltage‐gated Ca 2+ One possible reason for increased stretch‐evoked firing with Ca v 2005 1d 3.6 L‐type VGCC blocker has a biphasic effect on firing Uncovering a role for Ca v v n P 2a 2002 P P 2a 3.7 Taicatoxin (L‐type and SK2 blocker) increases stretch‐evoked firing Given these mixed effects with nifedipine, as another test for the involvement of L‐type VGCC, taicatoxin was applied. This blocks L‐type VGCCs (Possani et al., 1992 Ca 1997 n P 2b n P 3.8 L‐type calcium channels regulate SLV recycling To determine if L‐type channels might be a source of calcium to modulate SLV recycling, we examined the effects of low concentration nifedipine (10 µM) on FM1‐43 internalisation (Figure 2c t P Overall, therefore, L‐ and P/Q‐type VGCCs negatively regulate firing, with P/Q‐type being the most powerful. Conversely, L‐type VGCCs, but not P/Q‐type channels, regulate at least some aspects of SLV recycling (FM1‐43 uptake). The enhanced firing implies calcium might be opening K Ca 3.9 K Ca VGCCs are commonly co‐expressed with K Ca 2006 2003 1998 2004 Ca 2014 Ca If firing regulation involves K Ca 3a Ca n P Ca Ca n P To differentiate between BK and IK channels, the effects of TRAM 34, a selective K Ca Ca n P Hottentotta tamulus Buthus tamulus 1992 n P P 2013 These data indicate that members of all three channel families (BK, IK and SK) are functionally important. As an additional test of this model we asked if an agonist of these channels decreased firing. NS1619, which is a specific and irreversible activator of K Ca n P 3a n 3b Thus, overall, these observations indicate VGCC blockade, at least initially, consistently increased stretch‐evoked firing. The possible mechanisms for the later inhibition due to blocking L‐type channels by nifedipine will be considered in the Discussion. Thus, in general, inhibiting VGCCs does not explain the blockade of firing in the absence of calcium. We therefore investigated whether blocking another, more likely mechanosensitive, Ca‐permeant channel candidate family might inhibit firing. These were the TRP channels, for which a range of selective pharmacological tools exist. 3.10 TRPV4 channel inhibition inhibits stretch‐evoked afferent firing TRPs are non‐selective cation channels, and due to a significant permeability to calcium, are often involved in calcium signalling (Zhang et al., 2023 2002 n P 4a 2005 1990 n 2010 2018 1997 4c n P 2020 2006 n P 4d 1991 The final TRP receptor investigated was TRPV4, a well‐established candidate mechanosensory channel (Gualdani et al., 2020 50 2009 n P P 5a 50 2008 n P 5b The potency and specificity of these TRPV4 ligands, together with the substantive responses to them, indicate TRPV4 is a strong candidate stretch‐sensitive calcium channel in muscle spindles. 3.11 TRPV4 regulates SLV recycling Since calcium‐dependent release of glutamate enhances firing, we next examined if TRPV4 might regulate SLV recycling. RN1734 substantially decreased FM1‐43 internalisation (Figure 2c n n t P 4 DISCUSSION Given the powerful effects of extracellular calcium removal, and the substantial number of calcium buffering proteins within the sensory terminal, this study investigated the role(s) of calcium in muscle spindle sensory terminal function. While the immunofluorescence, immunohistochemical and FM1‐43 uptake studies here and previously give very precise localisation of the various calcium buffering proteins, K Ca 2017 1980 4.1 Calcium buffering and known calcium‐dependent processes The presence of at least six different calcium‐buffering proteins, which importantly include parvalbumin, often simply regarded as a peripheral mechanosensory neuron marker, indicates that regulation of intracellular calcium levels is of vital importance. One function likely to require calcium buffering in the sensory terminals is SLV recycling. Although spindle sensory terminals are not synaptic, their SLVs are part of an autogenic sensory regulatory system. Given this situation, another factor that must be borne in mind when interpreting the outcomes of the present experiments is that blocking calcium influx may stop SLV exocytosis of glutamate, thereby preventing activation of the terminal glutamate receptor (GluK2; Thompson et al., 2024 2005 4.1.1 P/Q‐type calcium channels Two different VGCCs were found to regulate muscle spindle stretch‐evoked firing: Ca v v v v v v 2005 1992 1993 v v v 4.1.2 L‐type calcium channels The observations in the present study confirmed that Ca v 2002 2002 Ca 2014 1993 2019 The mechanism of the later inhibitory action of nifedipine is less clear, but some clues may come from considering the increased FM1‐43 labelling with 10 µM nifedipine. First, this indicates L‐type channels can regulate SLV recycling, although which aspect (the uptake into [endocytosis] or release from [exocytosis] the terminals) is unclear initially. Our previous experiments show blocking all calcium channels with cobalt entirely blocks labelling of the sensory terminals (Bewick et al., 2005 In contrast to the complexities of responses to nifedipine, taicatoxin produced a much simpler outcome of sustained increase of hold‐phase firing at any concentration. The increase exceeded that of nifedipine. Given the foregoing discussion, and that taicatoxin is also an SK channel antagonist, the even higher excitation with this toxin could result from the additive effects of increased stiffness of the intrafusal fibres at the spindle poles plus sensory terminal depolarisation from the block of SK channels present in the terminals and the preterminal axon. The toxin's rather greater potency at SK channels (1–10 nM) than at L‐type channels (10–500 nM) suggests the latter action at SK channels is likely to predominate. This seems to be the case even at 300 nM, as no corresponding inhibition is seen, unlike high concentrations of nifedipine. Overall, therefore, the evidence suggests L‐type calcium channels are expressed on the sensory terminals themselves, selectively regulating SLV exocytosis and the SK channel‐induced hyperpolarisation. However, this hypothesis clearly needs further study. 4.1.3 N‐type calcium channels Among the other HVA VGCCs, although Ca v 1998 2009 2001 4.1.4 Calcium‐activated potassium channels Macromolecular complexes of VGCCs and K Ca 2006 2003 1998 1999 2007 Blockers for any of the K Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca 2014 Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca Ca v Ca Ca 2003 2008 2008 v v Ca Ca Ca 2003 1992 1985 2007 2006 2005 1993 4.2 TRP channels Another goal for this study was to test if TRP channels might conduct the stretch‐sensitive calcium current of the receptor potential, and serve a potential role in SLV recycling. We found strong evidence that TRP channels, particularly the most widely posited mechanosensory TRP channel TRPV4 (Zhang et al., 2023 1978 What is also unclear is how TRPV4 so powerfully regulates the stretch‐evoked response of the muscle spindle afferents. Since removal of external calcium, in the continued presence of sodium, has no effect on the receptor potential (Hunt et al., 1978 2005 2009 2010 2017 4.3 Summary These multiple calcium signals presumably underlie, at least in large part, the complexity and control of the generation of the receptor potential (RP) and its encoding in the afferent output, and are summarised in Figure 6 FIGURE 6 Summary diagram of proposed calcium signalling, relative to other key channels currently thought to be acting in mechanosensory terminals.
