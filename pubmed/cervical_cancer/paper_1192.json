Introduction Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera), an injectable hormonal contraceptive administrated every 3 months, has been associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition (reviewed in [ 1 2 3 4 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 We previously conducted a longitudinal study by collecting vaginal, endocervical, and rectal swabs as well as cervical cytobrush and blood from 39 women at baseline (visit 1, V1), 1 month (visit 2, V2), and 3 months (visit 3, V3) after Depo-Provera, and analyzed immune cells by flow cytometry and immune mediators by multiplex assays and ELISA [ 11 12 + 11 + + 12 13 14 12 12 12 12 The effects of Depo-Provera on the levels of immune mediators in the FRT have not been consistent in cross-sectional studies [ 2 15 16 17 While the changes in immune milieu in response to Depo-Provera administration have been studied extensively, the effect of cervicovaginal secretions from women pre- and post-Depo-Provera administration on HIV infectivity ex vivo has not been determined. In this study, we used cervicovaginal and rectal secretions from women pre and post Depo-Provera administration, which were collected in our previous study [ 12 JR-FL 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Subjects and Sample Collection The study (Pro20140000011) was approved by Rutgers, New Jersey Medical School (NJMS) Institutional Review Board (date approved: 30 October 2024). The Helsinki Declaration has been followed and written informed consent were obtained from the subjects for this study. Women who met the eligibility criteria were recruited at Rutgers, NJMS clinics located in Newark, New Jersey, as described in our previous study [ 11 12 12 2.2. HIV Infectivity Assay The effect of mucosal secretions on HIV infectivity was assessed in a single-cycle infection assay as described previously [ 18 JR-FL 2.3. Statistical Analysis Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used to compare differences in HIV infectivity between study visits. Spearman’s rank-order correlation for the endocervical samples was used for correlation analysis of changes in HIV infectivity (e.g., the value at V2 or V3 was subtracted by the value at V1), and changes in cytokine levels in samples pre vs. post Depo-Provera treatment (V2-1V1, V3-V1). Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.2 (GraphPad Software, Inc.\nSan Diego, CA, USA); p 3. Results and Discussions Vaginal, endocervical, and rectal secretions from swabs and cytobrush supernatants from women before (visit 1, V1), one month following (visit 2, V2), and three months following (visit 3, V3) Depo-Provera injection were collected [ 12 19 20 Among samples from different compartments, endocervical secretions from women after Depo-Provera treatment promoted HIV infectivity compared to pre-treatment samples ( Figure 1 The effect of rectal secretions on HIV infectivity was not significantly affected by Depo-Provera treatment (V1: median 191.3%, IQR 112.7–327.9%; V2: median 203.5%, IQR 119.1–295.5%; V3: median 236.2%, IQR 97.4–362%). Supernatants from cytobrush at V2 or V3 increased HIV infectivity compared to samples at V1 (V1: median 45.1%, IQR 23.9–94.8%; V2: median 77.3%, IQR 33.2–121.2%; V3: median 67%, IQR 27.9–119.6%), although the increase did not reach significance. The less pronounced Depo-Provera-induced HIV enhancement in the cytobrush supernatants may be due to cytobrush samples that were more diluted (3 mL) compared to samples from swabs (0.7 mL). Because endocervical secretions from women with Depo-Provera promoted HIV infectivity ex vivo compared to samples at V1 (pre-treatment), we determined whether the changes in HIV promoting activity after Depo-Provera treatment could be associated with changes in endocervical immune mediators that were determined in our previous study [ 12 p r p r p r Table 1 p r p r p r IL-17 is critical for maintaining mucosal immunity against viral infection but can also promote HIV infection and pathogenesis [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 RANTES can inhibit HIV entry via CCR5 [ 31 32 + + 12 + We observed a significant difference in HIV infectivity between vaginal samples from V2 (one month) and V3 (three months), but not between V2 or V3 compared to V1. The absence of difference compared to V1 may be due to the lack of defining specific stages of menstrual cycles, which strongly influences vaginal tissues at the baseline. Depo-Provera treatment appeared to reduce the variability of HIV infectivity among vaginal samples at V2 compared to samples at V1, likely reflecting its early effects (one month) of Depo-Provera on the vaginal mucosa. Similarly, increased variation at V3 compared to V2 may be due to the reduced levels of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) at V3. The degree of HIV infectivity was increased at V3, coinciding with the time subjects were due for their second Depo-Provera injection. In our previous report, epidermal growth factor (EGF) was the only mediator showing significant changes in the vaginal samples, increasing from V2 (median 26, IQR 16.17–64.15 pg/mL) and V3 (median 67.69, IQR 28.55–153.28 pg/mL) [ 12 33 Similarly, HIV infectivity differed between endocervical samples from V2 and V3. In our previous report, the cytokines that changed significantly between these visits were IL-7 (V2: median, 18.875, IQR, 12.03-20.65 pg/mL; V3: median, 13.07, IQR, 9.57–16.87 pg/mL) and RANTES (V2: median, 17.062, IQR, 8.41–35.16 pg/mL; V3: median 3.487, IQR 1.19–6.3 pg/mL) [ 12 34 35 36 + 37 + 38 39 + 40 41 Taken together, it remains to be determined whether these cytokines have direct effects on viral entry or serve as markers for increased HIV risk. These markers together with HIV infectivity may be used as markers to predict HIV risk. Further biochemical studies are required to identify HIV promoting factors in secretions from Depo-Provera-treated women or HIV inhibitory factors from women before Depo-Provera injection. In addition to its immunomodulatory function, Depo-Provera influences the epithelium at the FRT [ 42 43 44 45 46 47 42 43 21 48 45 Depo-Provera increases cervical mucin thickness within 1–3 days of treatment, thereby reducing sperm penetration [ 44 49 50 Inflammatory milieu has been thought to contribute to increased HIV transmission at the FRT. Indeed, our previous study showed that chlamydia-infected women have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines at the cervicovaginal mucosa than women after receiving antibiotic treatment, and endocervical secretions from chlamydia-infected women enhanced HIV infectivity ex vivo compared to samples from women post-treatment [ 18 12 The limitation of this study includes the absence of white subjects, as Black and Hispanic women were more receptive to using Depo-Provera at our clinics. Additionally, we did not define specific stages of menstrual cycles, which significantly influence vaginal tissues at V1. This may explain the lack of differences in HIV infectivity between Depo-Provera synchronized V2 or V3 compared with V1, which included participants at varying stages of menstrual cycles. Measuring the MPA levels in subjects at V2 and V3 could strengthen the analysis. It is possible that short-term Depo-Provera use promotes acute inflammation and the recruitment of target cells, whereas long-term use may sustain a chronic inflammatory environment, cause cumulative structural damage, and weaken the mucosal barrier. Therefore, analyzing samples from women with prolonged Depo-Provera use, increasing the sample size, and accounting for ethnicity and genetic factors may provide better insights into the effects of Depo-Provera on the FRT and their implications for HIV transmission. 4. Conclusions In our 3-month longitudinal study, endocervical secretions from women after Depo-Provera treatment increased HIV infectivity ex vivo. Future investigations into the mechanisms by which Depo-Provera modulates and promotes HIV infectivity ex vivo will provide insights relevant to developing strategies to prevent HIV spread.

Vaginal, endocervical, and rectal secretions from swabs, and supernatants from the cytobrush were incubated with serum-free HIV-luc (JR-FL) for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, samples were used directly to infect HeLa-CD4-CCR5 cells for 2 h at 37 °C. Following infection, cells were washed to remove unattached virus, and the level of HIV infection was determined 2 days later by luciferase assay. Luciferase values were normalized to virus incubated with PBS alone (untreated virus). Each dot represents an individual donor (median, IQR). A Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used for analysis. p ns viruses-17-01283-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Association of changes in immune mediators with changes ex vivo HIV infectivity in endocervical secretions. * p p  Endocervical V2-V1 Endocervical V3-V1 Spearman r p Spearman r p  MCP-1 0.1374 0.4771 0.1038 0.6064  G-CSF 0.1281 0.5160 − 0.6625  TNF  α 0.0443 0.8163 0.0974 0.6358  IL-6 − 0.2597 0.1038 0.6064  IL-1  β − 0.8429 0.2666 0.1755  IL-10 − 0.6076 0.0147 0.9422  GM-CSF 0.0825 0.6646 0.2705 0.1724  IL-2 0.3222 0.0721 0.1441 0.4734  MIP-1  α − 0.2236 0.0385 0.8489  MIP-1  β 0.0407 0.8309 0.1392 0.4887  IL-17  0.3833  0.0160 * − 0.7808  IL-8 − 0.6258 − 0.372  IL-15 0.1577 0.4052 − 0.7279  IL-12p40 0.3449 0.0620 − 0.9422  VEGF  0.5164  0.0035 * 0.2387 0.2304  RANTES   − 0.6374  0.0003 *   − 0.4797  0.0131 *  IP-10 0.1722 0.3545 0.1221 0.544  IL-4  0.1278  0.0493 * 0.1868 0.3508  IL-7   − 0.3768  0.0439 * − 0.9193  EOTAXIN 0.2355 0.2188 − 0.8966  IFN  γ 0.0742 0.7187 0.0006 0.9976  TNF  β 0.0109 0.9544 − 0.5874  IL-5 − 0.545 − 0.5269  IFN  α 2 − 0.7534 − 0.6322  IL-12p70 0.119 0.532 − 0.1538  IL-13 0.1862 0.3245 0.2885 0.1444  IL-1  α 0.2176 0.1833  0.3803  0.0500 *  EGF − 0.6342 − 0.2715 ",
