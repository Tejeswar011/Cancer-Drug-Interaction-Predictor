Aim This mixed-methods study was conducted to determine the sexual life experiences of women having gynecological cancer treatment. Methods The study was carried out between February and June 2024 in the gynecologic oncology department of a city hospital with 14 women who were not in the period of menopause, diagnosed with cancer for the first time, and were sexually active. A personal information form, the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R), and a semi-structured interview form were used as data collection tools. The analysis of qualitative data was carried out using conventional content analysis. Results The mean age of the women was 38.21 ± 4.40 and the mean FSDS-R score was 18.71 ± 7.18. It was observed that gynecological cancer diagnosis and treatment negatively affected daily living activities, emotional states, body image, and sexual lives of women. The experiences of the participants were grouped into four main and ten sub-themes. The main themes are: “Feelings related to cancer diagnosis”, “The effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment on life”, “The effects of cancer on body image/perception of femininity”, “Sexual life”. Conclusion This study highlights the profound impact of gynecological cancer and its treatment on women’s sexual health and overall quality of life. Women face multidimensional challenges encompassing emotional, physical, relational and sexual domains. These findings underline the importance of incorporating comprehensive psychosocial care including sexual counseling into the standard management of gynecological cancer.

In2020, these cancers accounted for approximately 7.29%of all new cancer cases globally, with over 1.3 million womendiagnosed [ 1 2 3 5 2 2 3 6 7 8 Sexuality remains a deeply taboo subject in many cultures despite its clinical and psychosocial importance. In Türkiye specifically, patriarchal norms and conservative religious values reduce women’s sexuality to marital duty rather than personal fulfillment, suppressing open discussions about sexual health [ 9 12 10 11 13 However, research indicates that women want to receive information about sexuality from all healthcare providers, including oncology nurses, and have open discussions on the matter [ 9 14 15 17 18 Methods Study design This study was designed as a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis techniques. The aim was to explore the sexual life experiences of women undergoing treatment for gynecological cancer in depth. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was employed. In this design, quantitative and qualitative data were collected simultaneously but analyzed separately, and the results were later integrated to provide a comprehensive understanding of the research problem. The qualitative part of this study employed a traditional content analysis approach, emphasizing an in-depth examination of both the topic itself and its broader context. This methodology allows for the exploration of both explicit, descriptive content and implicit, interpretive elements [ 18 Participants Data for the study were collected using purposeful sampling between February and June 2024. The study included 14 women who were treated for gynecological cancers in the gynecologic oncology department of a city hospital. Participants were aged above 18, diagnosed with gynecological cancer for the first time (without recurrence or metastasis), sexually active (either married or having a sexual partner), not in the menopausal stage, did not use psychotropic medications, and did not have any diagnoses that could negatively impact their psychological and/or sexual health. Data collection The research data were collected through face to face using the and “Female sexual distress scale-revised” and “Semi-structured interview form”. Female sexual distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) The scale developed by Derogatis et al. (2008) evaluates different aspects of distress related to sexual activity in women [ 19 20 20 Semi-structured interview form The interview guide was designed to include a total of 19 questions, comprising 15 questions focused on gathering socio-demographic and gynecological characteristics (date of cancer diagnosis, treatment applied, stage and type of cancer etc.), along with five open-ended questions to examine the effect of gynecological cancer diagnosis and treatment on sexual life experiences of women (Table 1 Table 1 Interview guide Interview guide questions How did the gynecological cancer diagnosis make you feel as a woman? How did the gynecological cancer diagnosis affect your body image? How did the gynecological cancer diagnosis affect your relationship with your spouse/partner? How did the diagnosis of gynecological cancer affect your sexual life? To increase the depth of the questions; please tell me more about this, can you give an example? At the end of each interview, participants were given the opportunity to share any additional thoughts or experiences related to their sexual life. Before the data collection phase, a pilot study was conducted with two women diagnosed with gynecological cancer to evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the interview questions. Feedback from these participants was used to refine and finalize the semi-structured interview guide. At the outset of the study, two members of the research team met with potential participants who met the inclusion criteria and were visiting the hospital’s oncology school. The interviews were held in a private meeting room. Care was taken to conduct the interviews in a quiet and private environment. Before starting the interviews, all ethical issues such as informed consent, aim of the study, voluntary participation, and confidentiality of information were fully explained to the participants and they were asked to sign the written consent form. The participants were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time and that this would not affect the treatment they were receiving from the hospital. Each interview lasting approximately 45 min. Data collection continued until thematic saturation was achieved, which occurred when no significant new insights emerged, and the themes began to repeat across interviews. After completing the interviews, the written notes from the two researchers were compared and consolidated to ensure accuracy. The finalized transcripts were then emailed to the participants for their review and approval, ensuring the authenticity and reliability of the data. Data analysis The analysis of the quantitative data of the study was performed using IBM SPSS 20 statistical software as numbers, percentages, and mean, while the analysis of the qualitative data was carried out using conventional content analysis. The qualitative data analysis was conducted using conventional content analysis, guided by a codebook approach to thematic analysis as outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006) [ 21 21 22 Research team and reflexivity Our research team consisted of two academic nurses (PhD A.Ö and PhD Z.A) specialized in women’s health and diseases. All researchers have received qualitative research training and have relevant studies on the subject. Interviews were conducted by two researchers. The researchers’ identities as female healthcare professionals specializing in women’s health influenced both the data collection and interpretation processes. Being women themselves allowed them to establish trust and rapport more easily with participants, particularly on sensitive topics such as sexuality, which are often stigmatized and difficult to discuss openly in the Turkish cultural context. Their professional background as nurses also helped them create a non-judgmental, empathetic, and safe space during interviews, encouraging participants to share personal experiences. Trustworthiness In this study, the trustworthiness of the data was assessed using Lincoln and Guba’s (1986) four criteria: credibility, confirmability, dependability, and transferability [ 23 Results The mean age of the participants was 38.21 ± 4.40 years. All participants were married, with a mean marriage duration of 18.21 ± 7.23 years. It was found that 42.9% of the women were primary school graduates, and only one woman was employed, though she had to quit her job during treatment. Additionally, 64.2% reported that their income was less than their expenses. Among the participants, the most common cancer types were ovarian (6 cases) and cervical (6 cases). It was also found that eight women received chemotherapy, while six women received chemotherapy, and radiotherapy (Table 2  Table 2 Distribution of the cancer-related data of women Number Age Cancer Type Stage Diagnosis time Treatment Type 1 38 Ovary Stage 3 4 months Chemotherapy 2 41 Uterine Stage 3 7 months Chemotherapy 3 34 Cervix Stage 1 6 months Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy 4 39 Cervix Stage 2 6 months Chemotherapy 5 41 Cervix Stage 3 5 months Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy 6 28 Endometrium Stage 2 3 months Chemotherapy 7 42 Ovary Stage 4 1 year Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy 8 30 Cervix Stage 1 9 months Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy 9 40 Ovary Stage 4 6 months Chemotherapy 10 40 Ovary Stage 3 8 months Chemotherapy 11 41 Endometrium Stage 4 6 months Chemotherapy 12 40 Ovary Stage 4 6 months Chemotherapy 13 39 Cervix Stage 4 9 months Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy 14 42 Cervix Stage 4 10 months Radiotherapy + Chemotherapy The mean FSDS-R score of the participants was 18.71 ± 7.18. It was observed that half of the participants had mean scores above the cut-off value (> 11.5 points) and had sexuality-related distress. The answer distributions to the questions in the scale are presented in Fig. 1 I am stressed about sex I have regrets about sexuality 1  Fig. 1 Distribution of answers to the female sexual distress scale-revised questions The experiences of women receiving gynecological cancer treatment were categorized into; “Feelings related to cancer diagnosis”, “The effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment on life”, “The effects of cancer on body image/perception of femininity”, “Sexual life” (Table 3  Table 3 Themes, sub-themes and codes Main themes Sub-themes Codes Feelings related to cancer diagnosis Negative Fear/Sadness/Anxiety Surprise/Denial Positive Standing strong Acceptance (God/religious belief) The belief that she would recover Effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment on life Physical and psychological effects Weakness/fatigue (Difficulty walking, inability to stand) Feeling depressed/sleepy (inability to get out of bed) Nausea Effects on daily life Inability to take care of the children Inability to do housework Effects on social life Not seeing anyone/restricting the social life Hiding cancer diagnosis Effects of cancer on body image/perception of femininity Effects on body image Self-dislike Loss of hair/eyebrows Coping with negative body image Use of hat/shawl/hijab Shaving beforehand because she does not want to see hair loss Dyeing eyebrows Sexual life Sexual intourse Pain/postcoital bleeding Decrease in sexual frequency/sexual desire Difficulty in maintaining sexual intercourse Sexual perspective/perception Not prioritizing Fear of being harmed Doctor’s recommendation after radiotherapy (part of treatment, obligation) Spousal relationship Fear of harming spouse/being harmed by spouse Understanding and support Responsibilities towards spouse and feelings of guilt Themes Feelings related to cancer diagnosis The theme of feelings related to cancer diagnosis was structured with five codes under the sub-themes of negative and positive feelings. It was found that all the women expressed at least one negative feeling regarding their diagnosis, with the most frequently experienced negative feelings were fear (such as fear of death, fear of leaving children behind), sadness, anxiety, surprise, denial. Some of the women diagnosed with cancer expressed the negative feelings triggered by their diagnosis the following statements: one woman said, “I felt very bad when I first found out. I was surprised. I couldn’t accept it for a long time.” “When I first found out I was demoralized.” “I felt like the bottom fell out of my my world… I was afraid to leave my 21-year-old daughter with autism alone ” It was also observed that the women tried to cope with the situation by relying on positive feelings such as standing strong, acceptance (God/religious belief), and the belief that they would recover, to adapt themselves to the situation. One woman expressed her religious belief by saying, “When I first learned about it I accepted it as a disease from God I immediately went to the hospital and got information to get treatment.” “My husband was diagnosed with leukemia and received treatment in 2006. He survived. When I first learned about it I was so scared I could not believe it but my husband set an example. I believed that I would get better.” The effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment on life The theme of effects of cancer diagnosis and treatment on life was structured with seven codes under three subthemes: physical and psychological effects, effects on daily life, and effects on social life. All women shared the view that the physical effects were most intense and frequent, particularly in the first week after chemotherapy. The most commonly reported physical and psychological effects were weakness/fatigue (difficulty walking, inability to stand), feelings of depressed/sleepy (inability to get out of bed). One woman described the physical difficulties she experienced, saying, “… I experienced nausea-vomiting weakness fatigue and all the side effects after chemotherapy I just lay down all the time. I could barely meet my own needs.” I don’t want to do anything.” It was observed that the negative physical effects of the treatment negatively affected women’s ability to fulfill their daily routines. The sub-theme of “effects on daily life” was categorized “inability to take care of the children” and “inability to do housework” codes. The sub-theme of “effects on social life” was categorized “not seeing anyone/restricting social life” and “hiding cancer diagnosis” codes. Women did not want people to pity them because they had cancer. One of the participants expressed these feelings as follows: “I always isolated myself. Because I didn’t want anyone to pity me… that’s why I didn’t tell my relatives. They still don’t know that I have cancer.” The effects of cancer on body image/perception of femininity The effects of cancer on body image/perception of femininity were structured with five codes under the sub-themes of effect on body image and coping with negative body image. It was observed that the diagnosis and treatment of gynecologic cancer had negative effects on the body image and perception of femininity of all participants, women did not like themselves and therefore used various coping ways. One woman expressed her opinion as follows: \"My hair and eyebrows fell out. I don’t feel beautiful.” “I had long blonde hair and when it first started falling out I was sad and scared. My husband and I decided to cut it off completely… When I felt that people outside were looking at me with pity because my eyebrows were falling out I started dyeing them.” “The loss of my hair wore me out. It was long until my back. I didn’t want anyone to see me bald so I always wore a shawl and a hat.” Sexual life This theme was structured under three sub-themes: “sexual intercourse”, “sexual perspective/perception” and “spousal relationship”. One woman shared her feelings about sexual intercourse as follows: “It negatively affected our sexual Life. We would do it 3–4 times a month. We haven’t had intercourse in 4 months. I don’t want to because of my illness…There is a decrease in desire and frequency.” “It had a negative impact. We would do it 2–3 times a week. Bleeding occurred during intercourse 1 month ago. This situation scared us. Even though the doctor said there would be no problem in intercourse we do not do it because we are afraid.” “I experience pain. I try because my husband wants me to but I have a hard time.” (W6 28). The second major effect of cancer diagnosis and treatment on sexual life was determined to be the differences in the perspective and perception of sexuality. It was observed that most women did not prioritize sexuality due to their cancer diagnosis and treatment. They avoided sexual activity out of fear of harm. One woman explained the impact on her perception of sexuality, saying, “I feel like I am being harmed and want to protect myself. I am not happy with this situation. “…I am afraid that if my husband doesn’t pay attention to his hygiene and he could get infected. I have been feeling guilty for two years. After all he is a man.” “…My radiotherapy doctor said that sex at least once a week would be good for my treatment. At first I was afraid and hesitant. But after the doctor explained it to me I did not have any problems…” The fear of harm was not only felt by the women but also by their husbands, who feared causing harm through sexual intercourse. As a result, the husbands were often reluctant to engage in sexual activity, showing an understanding and supportive attitude toward their wives. Women expressed the sense of responsibility and guilt they felt towards their husbands. This was reflected in the sub-theme of spousal relationships. One woman described her husband’s perspective, saying, “ I feel good but my wife is afraid something will happen to me. She’s afraid the disease will infect me I want to make my husband happy too. We didn’t have any issues with sexuality before the treatment but now I feel a little guilty and avoid it. My husband has always supported me both materially and emotionally. He’s my only supporter. I’ve always felt his support…” Discussion This study showed that gynecological cancer diagnosis and treatment negatively affects many aspects of women’s lives. The study revealed that being diagnosed with cancer causes emotional changes, mostly negative, in women. Moreover, it revealed the negative effects of cancer treatments on daily, social, and sexual lives of women due to the changes they cause in the body and their negative physical effects. Sexuality is an integral part of a good quality of life. Despite the problems experienced, sexuality it is often ignored in women with gynecological cancer [ 24 25 Being diagnosed with cancer is traumatic and causes many negative emotional changes [ 26 25 27 Cancer diagnosis and treatment bring along many physical complaints [ 27 28 29 25 30 Although gynecological cancer diagnosis and treatment varies according to racial and/or ethnic groups, it is an event that negatively affects and harms body image perception of women for all societies [ 31 32 25 25 13 27 Gynecological cancer diagnosis and treatment affects sexual lives of women in many aspects, such as a decrease in the desire/frequency of sexual intercourse, pain during intercourse, and the inability to maintain intercourse [ 24 25 9 25 13 24 25 32 It is known that cancer diagnosis and treatment cause changes in the perspective on sexuality and spouse relationships, recovering from cancer is prioritized, and sexual health is in a secondary position [ 24 25 24 25 13 25 25 Limitations This study has several limitations. First, it was conducted in a single hospital with a relatively small sample size, which limits the generalizability of the FSDS-R quantitative findings. However, it is important to note that qualitative research does not aim for statistical generalization but rather for transferability. This requires a detailed description of participants so that findings can be meaningfully applied to similar contexts or populations. In this sense, the limited sample size does not undermine the qualitative insights but restricts the generalizability of the quantitative scale results. Second, the study focused exclusively on non-menopausal women. Since gynecological cancers and their treatments may affect women differently based on age and menopausal status, future research should include older and menopausal women to capture a broader range of experiences. Another limitation is the absence of participants with vulvar and vaginal cancers, which, although less common, may present distinct challenges. Despite these considerations, this study offers valuable in-depth insights into the sexual life experiences of women undergoing gynecological cancer treatment and identifies critical areas for future research and clinical practice. Conclusion It was observed that many aspects of life such as physical, spiritual, social, sexual, spousal relationship, and body image perception were affected in women who survived after gynecological cancer diagnosis and treatment. It was found that many aspects of sexual health were negatively affected, and sexuality problems continued as a survival problem. Cancer diagnosis causes women to experience a lot of negative emotions and creates fear of death. Cancer treatments vary depending on the type and duration, cause disturbing physical complaints for women, and changes that occur during treatment negatively affect body image perception of women. Women take precautions to prevent the feeling of discomfort caused by the possibility of others seeing what is visible. Decrease in sexual desire, avoiding having sexual intercourse due to fear of being harmed, feeling guilty towards the partner due to bleeding during intercourse and not being able to maintain the intercourse, putting sexuality on the backburner with the thought that the priority is cancer treatment, and experiencing sexuality as a duty towards the partner and as an obligation as part of the treatment were identified as the most striking themes and codes. Despite such a wide impact, it was observed that information about the effects of cancer and its treatment on sexual life was given to only four of the women. Sexuality is an important component of quality of life. Nurses and healthcare professionals should be trained to initiate structured conversations on sexual health using scripted assessment tools during routine oncology visits. This approach could help normalize these discussions, identify unmet needs, and offer tailored counseling or referral services. Additionally, psychoeducational programs should be developed to support both patients and their partners in navigating changes in intimacy, self-image, and communication. Considering the paradox identified in the study women’s perception of spousal support coexisting with guilt and a sense of obligation interventions must consider the cultural and familial structures unique to Türkiye. In traditional Turkish society, strong gender role expectations and deeply rooted beliefs about female sexual duty may reinforce women’s internalized guilt, even when spousal support is present. Therefore, couple-based interventions that address mutual expectations, normalize post-treatment changes, and encourage open communication may be particularly beneficial. Future longitudinal research is also needed to track changes in sexual health and intimacy throughout and after cancer treatment, which will inform tailored interventions and policy.
