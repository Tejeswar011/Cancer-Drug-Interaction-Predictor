In addition, the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of FXR-regulated HVEM were characterized. The clinical implications of the immunosuppressive FXR/HVEM axis were evaluated in a cohort of patients with NSCLC. The therapeutic potential of anti-BTLA immunotherapy, as well as the corresponding changes of TME, in the FXR hi lo Results HVEM is positively correlated with FXR but is inversely correlated with PD-L1 in NSCLC. First, to determine whether FXR correlates with HVEM expression in NSCLC, we examined clinical NSCLC samples and analyzed public datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Nuclear staining of FXR and membrane staining of HVEM were scored in respect to their subcellular locations in tumor cells ( 19 25 Figure 1, A and B hi lo 2 hi hi lo Figure 1C Figure 1D NR1H4 TNFRSF14 Supplemental Figure 1A https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.190716DS1 NR1H4 TNFRSF14 Supplemental Figure 1 To date, IHC-based detection of PD-L1 on tumor cells is the best predictive marker for anti–PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in treating NSCLC ( 26 hi lo hi Figure 1, E and F Figure 1G lo hi lo hi lo lo Figure 1, H and I hi lo lo/– FXR upregulates HVEM expression in NSCLC cells. Next, we explored whether the correlation between the levels of FXR and HVEM in patients with NSCLC implies a positive regulation. The functional relevance of FXR antagonists was determined in NSCLC cells. The results show that 3 antagonists of FXR, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), 16-dehydropregnenolone (DHP), and Z-guggulsterone (Z-GS), could inhibit HVEM surface and mRNA expression in A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 2, A–D Supplemental Figure 2 27 29 Figure 2, E–G Supplemental Figure 2 Figure 2, H and I 30 Moreover, the expression of HVEM in FXR-overexpressed or -silenced NSCLC cells was determined. The results indicate that stable overexpression of FXR led to an increased surface and mRNA expression of HVEM in A549 cells, which could be reversed by the treatment of either UDCA, DHP, or Z-GS ( Figure 3, A–F Supplemental Figure 3 Figure 3, G–I Collectively, these findings suggest that FXR upregulates HVEM expression in NSCLC cells.

Only s.c. tumor-bearing models with LLC cells were employed. Orthotopic transplantation models of diverse murine NSCLC tumors should be adopted. Moreover, since sex may be a biological variable that affects immunological responses to tumor antigens, establishment of in vivo studies to include more male and female mice will strengthen the conclusions of this study in the future. In summary, the present study shows that HVEM was positively correlated with FXR and preferentially expressed in FXR hi lo hi lo lo/– Methods Sex as a biological variable. This study included male and female individual clinical samples. Similar findings were found for both sexes. Sex was not considered as a biological variable. For in vivo studies, only female mice were used based on practical considerations, such as immunity, aggressiveness, and welfare. Cell lines. Human NSCLC A549 and H1975 cells as well as mouse LLC cells were all purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in DMEM or RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The above cells were confirmed to be free of Mycoplasma Patient samples. From February 2015 to December 2020, primary NSCLC tumors were consecutively obtained from Asian Chinese patients who underwent surgery at the Department of Thoracic Surgery in Shandong Provincial Hospital (Jinan, China). Here were the inclusion criteria we followed: (a) complete resection with curative intent and (b) pathologically confirmed NSCLC by 2 independent pathologists. The exclusion criteria were: (a) neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy treatment and (b) medical history of other malignant tumors. The survival data were collected through medical records or telephone interviews. Finally, a total of 178 NSCLC samples were enrolled and made as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. Peripheral whole blood samples were collected from patients newly diagnosed with NSCLC between October 2020 and April 2021 in Shandong Provincial Hospital. IHC analysis. The FFPE NSCLC samples and mouse LLC tumors were stained with IHC as described previously ( 30 NR1H4 TNFRSF14 TNFRSF14 The results of IHC staining were scored independently and blindly by 2 skilled pathologists, and a final consensus was reached. Negative (score, 0), weak (score, 1), moderate (score, 2) and intense (score, 3) represent tumor cell staining intensity, respectively. 0% (score, 0), 1% to 25% (score, 1), 26% to 50% (score, 2), 51% to 75% (score, 3), and 76% to 100% (score, 4) represent the percentage of positive cells. The final IHC score was the multiplication result of intensity score and percentage score. In human NSCLC tissues, the levels of FXR, PD-L1, and HVEM were all categorized as low expression (score, 0–4) or high expression (score, 6–12), respectively, in accordance with our previous study ( 54 + 54 Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell proliferation was measured using the CCK-8 assay. In brief, cells were incubated with CCK-8 solution (10 μL/well; CK04; Dojindo Molecular Technologies) in the dark at 37°C for 2 hours. The absorbance (OD) was measured at 490 nm using a Thermo Fisher Multiskan FC microplate reader. Cell cycle analysis. Cells were harvested and fixed with 70% ice-cold ethanol. Then, the fixed cells were resuspended in propidium iodide/RNase staining buffer (550825; BD Pharmingen) for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze the cell cycle distributions. Western blotting. Western blotting was carried out according to our preliminary publication ( 15 TNFRSF14 NR1H4 NR1H4 qPCR analysis. qPCR was conducted in accordance with our previous study ( 30 Lentiviral constructs and cell infection.
