In autoimmune diseases, extracellular ATP acts as a potent pro-inflammatory signal by activating the purinergic receptor P2X7, which is expressed on both mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) and T cells—key drivers of pathological processes. While it is well established that P2X7 mediates ATP-dependent immune activation, its cell-specific contributions to innate versus adaptive immunity in autoimmune conditions remain unclear, especially in autoimmune uveitis. Here we used the experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) mouse model to delineate the cellular mechanisms underlying P2X7’s role in autoimmune responses. Using a combination of multiple cell-specific conditional models and transcriptomic approaches, we showed a pivotal role forP2X7 expressed by MPs in orchestrating T-cell mediated autoimmune responses. P2X7 deficiency in MPs decreased disease severity. Additionally, cell-specific transcriptomic analyses, including single-cell analyses, revealed that P2X7 exerted distinct modulatory effects across monocyte-derived macrophages (MdM) versus microglia. In MdM, lack of P2X7 was associated with reduced expression of genes related to the inflammasome, phagocytosis pathways, and components of the complement system, leading to a marked decrease in pathogenic Th17 cell frequency in the retina. In microglia, P2X7 deficiency instead particularly impacted an IFN-responsive microglial subset that is normally characteristic of EAU. By specifically deleting P2X7 in microglia, we demonstrate its role in driving pathogenic processes in this cell population. These findings suggest that inhibition of P2X7 could be a promising therapeutic strategy in autoimmune neuroinflammatory disorders.

Highlights  P2X7 expressed on MPs, rather than on CD4 + Lack of P2X7 expression by MPs not only down-regulated phagocytosis and inflammasome pathways but also complement components. P2X7 indirectly influences Th17 polarization through its expression in MPs. P2X7-deficiency in MPs reduced the frequency of the IFN-responsive microglial subset during EAU.

While this sterile inflammation promotes tissue repair, it can also contribute to the development of inflammatory diseases including cancer, autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases [ 1 P2X7 is a potent activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the cleavage of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 and the release of the mature forms by mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) [ 2 3 4 5 6 10 10 12 2 13 14 2 10 15 Nevertheless, the function of P2X7 in the context of autoimmune diseases involving innate and adaptive immune cells remains poorly understood. P2X7 expression is frequently elevated in autoimmune diseases, and its inhibition has generally been associated with beneficial outcomes [ 15 16 17 18 Systemic or organ-specific autoimmune diseases are caused by dysregulation of the immune system leading to the activation of autoreactive lymphocytes. The mechanisms by which autoreactive T cells trigger pathology have been characterized in various autoimmune models. The disease is first initiated by activation of CD4 + 19 Among autoimmune diseases, non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is a group of inflammatory intraocular diseases which can be debilitating and lead to blindness [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 19 Materials and method Animals Both female and male mice aged 8 to 12 weeks were used for this project. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Janvier Laboratories.

Mice received daily intraperitoneal injections of tamoxifen (100 mg/kg) for 5 consecutive days. Induction of EAU For active induction of EAU, mice were immunized subcutaneously with 200 µg of IRBP 651−670 Mycobacterium tuberculosis Bordetella pertussis 31 For adoptive transfer, donor mice were immunized as described above. 10 days after immunization, spleens and lymph nodes were collected and mechanically dissociated. Cell suspensions were cultured for 72 h in RPMI 1640 supplemented with fetal bovine serum 10%, gentamycin (50 µg/mL) and 2-mercaptoethanol (50 µM) in the presence of IRBP 651−670 7 Clinical signs of EAU were assessed daily by fundus examination on a scale of 0–5 based on the extent of inflammation, as described in supplementary Fig. 6 32 Samples were collected 12 days after active EAU induction and 6 days after passive EAU, corresponding to the disease peak in our experimental models. Flow cytometry Mice were euthanized by CO 2 For intracellular labeling of IFN-γ and IL-17 A, cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in RPMI with the cell stimulation and protein transport inhibitor cocktails (ebioscience™). After surface staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with fixation/permeabilization buffer (Invitrogen) and stained with antibodies against IFN-γ (REA638) and IL-17 A (REA660). Acquisition was performed on a Celesta SORP cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed with FlowJo 10.8. Cell culture Microglia were isolated with Percoll separation as previously described [ 33 containing the enzyme Liberase TL at 1.6 Wünsch unit/mL and DNAse1 at 0.5 mg/mL (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After washing, the brain homogenate was centrifuged in a 25/75% Percoll gradient (GE Healthcare). Microglia were recovered from the 25/75% Percoll interphase. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were isolated using a quick peritoneal lavage method with PBS. Cells were washed and seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/well in 96-well plates. Then, cells were stimulated directly for microglia or after 24 h for peritoneal MPs, with LPS 40 ng/mL (E. coli 0127:B8, Sigma) for 3 h, followed by ATP 5mM (Sigma-Aldrich) 30 min at 37 °C 5% CO 2 Fluorescence activated cell-sorting Preparation of cell suspensions from individual mouse retinas and lymph nodes was performed as described for flow cytometry. Retinal and lymph node cells were labelled with the following antibodies: anti-CD45, anti-CD11b, anti-CD11c and anti-Ly6G (Miltenyi)(Supplemental Table 1 + + neg + + + Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing For bulk RNA sequencing: The SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Takara) was used to generate cDNA from 3 ng of total RNA. RNAseq libraries were prepared from cDNA using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on a Novaseq 6000 sequencer (Illumina). Fastq files obtained from the sequencing were aligned using STAR (v2.7.9a) against the mouse reference genome from Ensemble Mouse v106 (2022/06/21), with option “--quantMode GeneCounts” to extract the raw counts for each gene, and all count files were concatenated into a single file. The sequencing depth ranged between 28 and 47 million aligned reads. A sample file was created with the sample data including the conditions (P2X7 lox cre lox lox cre lox We performed the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using the Broad Institute application ( https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/index.jsp 34 https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html For single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq): The barcoded cDNAs were prepared from sorted cells using a 10x genomics chromium and were used to construct the indexed scRNA sequencing libraries according to Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Library v3.1 and dual Index Kit TT according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 sequencer. The Fastq files were processed using Cellranger v6.1.2 with default options (alignment, count). The resulting expression matrices were merged and analyzed with Seurat v4 (merge, QC filtering, normalization, PCA, clustering, UMAP/tSNE). The resulting Seurat object was used to create a H5AD file that was used as input for cellxgene for visualization and data exploration. Further analyses were performed in cellxgene using the cellxgene_VIP plugin (differential analysis, various visualizations, etc.). Processing scripts are available on demand. Genes interaction analysis was performed using STRING consortium [ 35 Statistical analysis Sample sizes for our experiments were determined according to our previous studies. Graph Pad Prism 10 (GraphPad Software) was used for data analysis and graphic representation. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Differences between two groups were analyzed using an unpaired Mann-Whitney test and differences between multiple groups were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA.

P2X7-deficiency in resident microglial cells and infiltrating MdMs reduces the severity of EAU Since P2X7 expression on lymphocytes does not seem to play a major role in EAU development, and given that its activation in macrophages induces a pro-inflammatory response, we hypothesize that P2X7 primarily influences EAU pathogenesis through its expression on resident microglia and infiltrating MdMs. Thus, we investigated the role of P2X7 expressed in innate immune cells during EAU.

P2X7 in microglia is involved in the pathogenic processes during EAU Although P2X7 expression in MdMs plays an important role in uveitis through promoting Th17 T cell populations and other mechanisms, microglia have been reported to also play an important role in the development of EAU [ 54 55 We used Cx3cr1 creER lox lox creER lox 8 creER lox lox 8 lox creER lox creER lox lox creER lox 8 creER lox lox + med lox creER lox + high ox creER lox + neg lox creER lox 8 8  Fig. 8 P2X7 deficiency on resident microglia is sufficient to reduce the severity of EAU ( A lox creER lox 651−670 B lox cre lox n lox n creER lox p C + med + high lox creER lox D lox n creER lox n + med p + high p + neg p + + p E n lox n creER lox Overall, these data suggested that P2X7 expressed specifically by microglia also significantly contributes to the development of EAU. Discussion In this study, we analyzed the role of P2X7-expressing immune cell types in the development of EAU. We showed a pivotal role of P2X7-expressing MPs in the control of autoimmune neuroinflammation. We demonstrated that the absence of P2X7 in these cells leads to a down-regulation of the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules, including the NLRP3 inflammasome and complement elements. While the suppression of P2X7 on T cells had no detectable effect on the disease, MP P2X7 indirectly shaped the phenotype of Th17 cells. In addition, the lack of P2X7 in MPs significantly altered the subpopulation of IFN-responsive microglia that had a detrimental impact on the progression of EAU. Together, our data support a model in which P2X7 activation on MPs controls the phenotype of autoreactive T-cells, in addition to promoting pro-inflammatory processes within the P2X7-expressing MPs (Supplemental Fig. 8). In agreement with previous studies [ 39 56 1 11 15 + 2 3 43 + 2 + 1 Importantly, our work highlights a major role of P2X7-expressing MPs, both MdMs and microglia, in the development of EAU. We showed that lack of P2X7 in MPs generally decreased the severity of the clinical signs of EAU and diminished immune cell infiltration in the retina. Transcriptomic analysis of MPs in the EAU retina revealed that the lack of P2X7 in this cell type down-regulated genes belonging to the phagocytosis and inflammatory pathways. While phagocytosis serves as an essential mechanism for retinal homeostasis under physiological conditions, MP activation can transform this process into a pathological one, resulting in aberrant engulfment of viable photoreceptors and subsequent retinal degeneration [ 57 58 Non-infectious uveitis is characterized by elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, particularly CD4 + 23 59 23 59 60 5 9 42 61 62 In addition, the P2X7-dependent inflammasome pathway triggers the release of IL1β and IL18 [ 2 6 6 45 46 63 6 6 Our results show that lack of P2X7 in MPs reduced the expression of components of the complement-system, in particular the C4b isoform and C3 (Fig. 5 7 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 7 In EAU microglia exhibit properties of antigen presenting cells [ 54 55 + 7 48 49 7 51 4 52 71 72 creER lox 8 Together, our findings demonstrate that P2X7 expression in both microglial cells and MdMs promotes auto-immune uveitis. The loss of P2X7 expression in MPs may reduce TNFα production, impair phagocytic activity (MdM), and attenuate IL1β release (MdM) - a cytokine known to be critical for the polarization of pathogenic Th17 cells. Importantly, these pathways have been implicated in both autoimmune and autoinflammatory processes, which are key contributors to the pathogenesis of non-infectious uveitis [ 20 26 In conclusion, our comprehensive cell-specific analysis of P2X7 functions in EAU has revealed a pivotal role for P2X7 expression in MPs, orchestrating both innate and adaptive immune responses in autoimmune neuroinflammation.
