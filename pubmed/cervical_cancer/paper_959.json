Introduction Head and neck cancers (HNC) are one of the common cancers globally, with an age-standardised incidence of 5.8% [ 1 2 3 2 3 4 Despite the good prognosis, a majority of patients relapse within 5 years of treatment. Amongst HPV-positive patients, around 25% relapse by 5 years. A large recurrence pattern study amongst HNCs from Michigan ( n 5 6 Treatment of recurrent HNC is challenging. Isolated locoregional recurrence may be managed with surgery or reirradiation [ 7 8 8 9 p 6 10 11 12 We present a case of an elderly gentleman diagnosed with HPV-negative carcinoma of the base of the tongue (cT2N0M0 previously treated with radical radiation) with synchronous neck node recurrence and lung metastases after a disease-free interval of 4 years. We successfully treated the neck node recurrence with reirradiation to 66 Gy and the lung with SBRT 34 Gy in a single fraction. The patient has completed a 2-year follow-up with a complete response at both sites. This case exemplifies that selective radical radiotherapy treatment is effective in oligometastatic cancers in an elderly patient, offering efficient disease control, warding off the need for systemic therapy. 2. Case Summary A 73-year-old gentleman presented with left neck swelling for 2–3 weeks. He was treated with definitive radiotherapy 3 years back for HPV-negative carcinoma of the base of the tongue cT2N0M0 to a dose of 66 Gy in 30 fractions with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). On local examination, a 2 × 3 cm left Level II lymph node was palpable, which was hard in consistency, partly mobile, and the skin was not pinchable. A thorough oral cavity examination did not show any evidence of growth. A positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) was done, suggesting a 4 × 4 × 3.2 cm left cervical node with vessel involvement and skin involvement with a standardised uptake value (SUV) max of 9.15 ( Figure 1 He was treated for the neck node using VMAT to a dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions over 6.5 weeks with curative intent. He underwent a radiotherapy planning computed tomography (CT) scan in a supine position with a head and neck thermoplastic mould. The gross tumour volume (GTV) included the left cervical lymph node, and the high-risk clinical target volume (CTV) included the GTV + 3 mm margin around it. The planned dose was 66 Gy in 33 fractions for GTV (EQD2 119.1 Gy) and 54 Gy in 33 fractions to high-risk CTV ( Figure 2 Table 1 13 The lung nodule was treated using the SBRT technique with a dose of 34 Gy in a single fraction. He underwent a radiotherapy planning CT scan in a supine position with a thoracic thermoplastic mould using the automated breath coordinator (ABC) technique in deep inspiratory breath hold (DIBH). The GTV included the lung lesion, and a 5 mm planning target volume (PTV) was generated. The planned dose was 34 Gy in one fraction ( Figure 3 Table 2 14 Follow-up: Patient was followed up weekly whilst receiving radiation. He developed Grade I dermatitis, Grade I xerostomia and Grade I dysphagia during the course of treatment. He tolerated the treatment well. At 3 months, there was a complete clinical response, and PET-CT showed a complete response in the neck node and lung with no new metastases. Patient has completed 2 years of follow-up with a sustained complete response in the neck node. Patient is doing well and is able to carry out his daily activities with minimal difficulty, with only Grade I xerostomia and Grade I lung radiological changes on scans. The PET-CT showed a complete response at both sites in 1 year. He remained on a 3-month follow-up. At 2 years, he presented with left neck erythema, pain and fever. The PET-CT was suggestive of an abscess in the neck with no metastasis in the lung ( Figure 4 3. Discussion Locoregional recurrences are common and can affect as many as 24%–50% of patients. Haring et al. show that patients with HPV-positive disease were more likely to have distant metastases to the lung. In contrast, patients with HPV-negative disease were more likely to have locoregional recurrence [ 6 15 8 8 Reirradiation requires meticulous planning and consideration of the prior radiation doses with strict constraints for the spinal cord, carotid, bone and mucosa. A dreaded and often lethal complication of reirradiation for HNC and/or HNC therapy is carotid blowout syndrome, in which the carotid artery or one of its major branches ruptures. Known risk factors of carotid blowout syndrome are tumour invasion of the carotid arteries, infection, surgery and high cumulative doses of radiotherapy. Another side effect that can cause considerable suffering for the patient is osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Hence, careful selection is the key. Apart from ORN and carotid artery blowout, another long-term toxicity of head and neck reirradiation is soft tissue necrosis. It is a severe late complication resulting from cumulative radiation-induced vascular damage and impaired tissue healing. It presents as progressive ulceration, fibrosis and tissue breakdown. It is often accompanied by pain, infection and fistula formation. Bots et al. reported long-term disease control and late radiation toxicity for patients reirradiated to a dose of 45 Gy for HNC [ 16 Table 3 17 SBRT is a commonly employed technique to treat unresectable patients with early stage nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). GORTEC 2014-04 Phase 2 study assesses survival without definitive quality of life deterioration of omitting upfront chemotherapy in oligometastatic patients with HNSCC using SABR alone [ 18 18 19 20 9 9 RTOG 0915 was a randomised Phase II trial of SBRT for unresectable peripheral early stage NSCLC patients that compared 34 Gy in a single fraction to 48 Gy in four fractions, with 1-year primary endpoint being Grade 3 or higher toxicities. The single-fraction schedule showed a lower rate of toxicities for comparable primary tumour control [ 13 21 One of the limitations was that we treated the lung lesion without biopsy. It is often difficult to obtain a biopsy for a lung primary, especially in elderly patients. Koh et al. showed no difference in outcome for early stage lung cancer patients treated with SBRT, irrespective of biopsy confirmed or radiologically detected [ 22 23 n 24 25 4. Conclusion Radical intent can be considered in oligometastatic cancers. Reirradiation is a treatment option for patients with recurrent HNCs. Single-fraction SBRT is a recommended dosing schedule for lung primaries and metastases. 5. Patient Perspective I noticed a neck swelling, and we went to the ENT department. I expected it to be a cold infection. However, when the doctor asked to get the fine needle biopsy done, it was evident that the cancer was back. However, we as a family still hoped to see better results. The result confirmed the return of cancer, and the PET-CT confirmed that it is extending not only to the skin tissue but also to a second lesion in the right lung. This is kind of a shock to us. Further discussion with the oncologists confirmed that the node is extending to the skin, and surgery is not an option for the neck. So there were two options to go with: radiation and chemotherapy or only radiation. After discussing with the family, we decided that the quality of life is more important than extending years. So putting myself through the chemo with its side effects is not worth the risk. We decided to go with the radiation. We were aware of the radiation to the neck, but the radiation to the lung lesion was new to us. It was a bit difficult for me to go through the radiation to the lung. It was a single-time process. The neck radiation was much smoother. We had taken the preferred slot to visit the hospital, and it was easy to manage. This time around, I had fewer symptoms and was able to take food without much difficulty. Postradiation and the follow-up visits are not too tiresome, and we are now getting used to them. The recent PET scan was clean, too, and we hope this will remain so for a long time.
