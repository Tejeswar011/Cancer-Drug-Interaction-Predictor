Background Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are emerging as promising cell-free therapeutic agents due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. However, the lack of standardized protocols and dose optimization strategies has limited their clinical translation. While procedures for the isolation, expansion, and therapeutic use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been standardized, there remains a lack of standardized protocols for the isolation and purification of EVs and exosomes (Exos). Methods This review Comprehensive statistical summary global clinical trials involving MSC-EVs and Exos registered between 2014 and 2024, with a particular focus on dose-effect relationships and administration routes. Data were collected from ClinicalTrials.gov Results Intravenous infusion and aerosolized inhalation were identified as the predominant administration methods, especially in trials targeting respiratory diseases. Notably, dose-effect results revealed that nebulization therapy achieved therapeutic effects at doses around 108 particles, significantly lower than those required for intravenous routes. This suggests a relatively narrow and route-dependent effective dose window. However, large variations in EVs characterization, dose units, and outcome measures were observed across trials, underscoring the lack of harmonized reporting standards. Conclusion This review highlights dose-response as a critical but underappreciated gap in current MSC-EVs clinical research. The findings emphasize the urgent need for standardized dosing frameworks, potency assays, and harmonized clinical protocols to advance the safe and effective translation of MSC-EVs therapies. The analysis underscores the need for standardized protocols, global collaboration, and a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying MSC-EVs and Exos therapies to advance clinical applications and ensure safety and efficacy. mesenchymal stem cells extracellular vesicles exosomes nebulization lung diseases COVID-19 clinical trials The authors declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Following cell culture, extracellular vesicles are isolated from conditioned media using techniques such as differential centrifugation, ultracentrifugation. Characterization is performed using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), flow cytometry, and electron microscopy to confirm size, concentration, and surface markers. Therapeutically, MSC-EVs have shown promising applications in diverse organ systems, including the brain (neuroprotection), lungs (inflammatory injury and ARDS), liver (fibrosis and regeneration), pancreas (diabetes and pancreatitis), joints (arthritis and cartilage repair), intestines (inflammatory bowel disease), reproductive system (endometrial repair), skin (wound healing), and eyes (corneal regeneration), highlighting their broad regenerative and immunomodulatory potential. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Retrieving clinical trial databases Data were collected from the institutional databases of the Cochrane Register of Studies, ClinicalTrials.gov The data were downloaded into CSV files and included the following items: registration number, trial title, recruitment status, sponsor, clinical stage, country of origin, and registration date. Additional information, such as disease targets, cell sources, routes of administration, and doses, was manually extracted from the trial registration records when it could not be directly matched and downloaded from the databases. Due to incomplete data in many categories, a different number of trials may be included in each parameter analyzed. Duplicate clinical trials were identified and eliminated based on registration numbers before entering the subsequent analysis process ( Table 1 TABLE 1 Database search results (search date: 2024-2-17). Database Search query Search results Cochrane Register of Studies (“Mesenchymal Stem Cells” OR “MSCs” OR “Mesenchymal Stem Cell”) AND (“Extracellular Vesicles” OR “EVs”) AND (“Exosomes” OR “Exos”) 110  ClinicalTrials.gov (“Mesenchymal Stem Cells” OR “MSCs” OR “Mesenchymal Stem Cell”) AND (“Extracellular Vesicles” OR “EVs”) AND (“Exosomes” OR “Exos”) 61 Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (“Mesenchymal Stem Cells” OR “MSCs” OR “Mesenchymal Stem Cell”) AND (“Extracellular Vesicles” OR “EVs”) AND (“Exosomes” OR “Exos”) 16 2.2 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical trials The inclusion criteria for clinical trials in the search results are: Clinical studies that have completed full registration. Studies using MSC-derived EVs or Exos as the main intervention method. Projects that meet the international ethical and scientific quality standards for clinical trials (Good Clinical Practice, GCP). The exclusion criteria for clinical trials are: Repeated clinical trials. Projects with withdrawn registration status. Projects with supplementary terms registration type. Projects that do not use MSC-derived EVs or Exos as the main ingredients of the intervention drug. Projects that have not undergone full registration or ethical review to obtain clinical trial qualifications. The screening process is illustrated in Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Clinical trial screening flow chart. Flowchart illustrating the extraction and processing of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord. Cells undergo tangential flow filtration and ultracentrifuge to produce MSC-extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs), which are depicted as potentially benefiting the brain, lung, liver, pancreas, joints, intestine, uterus and ovaries, skin, and eye. 2.3 Screening and confirmation of clinical trials The clinical trial research data collection was conducted by two trained researchers. After retrieving all clinical trials, two independent researchers screened the included trials based on the duplicate data and the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Controversial clinical trial research was referred to a third trained researcher for resolution. This process ensured the final determination of the clinical trial projects included in this systematic visualization analysis. 2.4 Information extraction Three independent researchers evaluated all clinical trial titles and research statuses. Controversial parts were resolved through communication and discussion among the three researchers. The extraction of relevant information from the final included clinical trial studies encompassed: clinical trial registration number, study start year, country and unit, study type, study phase, study design, route of administration, disease and injury type, source of exosomes or extracellular vesicles, drug dosage description or treatment regimen, publication of study results and Study URL. The latest dataset is generated in the Supplementary Appendix Tables 1 2 2.5 Comprehensive evaluation of visual analysis results and dose-effect reporting Power BI 2.1 software was used to generate datasets based on the research detailed in Supplementary Appendix Tables 1 2 Clinical trials with reported results were identified, and these results were not limited to publication in registration databases, journal literature, journal news, or open access sources. Clinical trials were further categorized according to the route of administration and the type of injury or disease. For clinical trial studies that published application doses and results, the main components, doses, frequency of administration, and effects of the intervention drugs were statistically analyzed. Due to differences in the unit modes of MSC-EVs or MSC-Exos dose calculations, a unified standard was adopted wherever possible.

Additional information about the disease, source of MSCs, route of administration, and dose was manually extracted from the trial registration data, as it could not be directly matched and downloaded from the databases. In many cases, complete data for all these categories were not found, but data were collected whenever possible, resulting in different numbers of trials included in each parameter analyzed. Screening Process: A total of 187 clinical trials were retrieved. After eliminating 39 duplicate trials and excluding 38 trials through preliminary screening of titles and abstracts, the research data of 90 clinical trials were evaluated against the inclusion criteria. Finally, 66 clinical trials were included in the analysis. The screening process is illustrated in Figure 2 Figure 1 Supplementary Appendix Table 1 Supplementary Appendix Table 2 FIGURE 2 Summary of the sources, isolation methods, and organ-specific applications of mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles. Flowchart of clinical trial selection process. From 187 records searched across three registries, 148 were initially screened. Duplications excluded 39 trials. Another 38 trials were excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria. An additional 24 trials were excluded due to various issues, leaving 90 trials for evaluation. Finally, 66 trials were included in the quantitative analysis. 3.2 Overview of clinical trial datasets The registration of clinical trials related to MSC-EVs and MSC-Exos has been ongoing from April 2014 to the present. The dataset included in this study covers a span of ten years. The distribution of countries/regions involved in these studies shows that China ranks first with 30 studies, followed by Iran and the United States, each with 12 studies, indicating high research activity. Other countries such as Turkey, Brazil, Germany, and the Russian Federation each have 2 studies, while Singapore, Egypt, Indonesia, Thailand, Italy, Greece, and Israel have only 1 study each, as shown in Figures 3 4 Figure 5 FIGURE 3 Number of countries and projects conducting relevant clinical trials worldwide. World map highlighting countries based on the number of studies. Russia, Brazil, and Greece are marked for one study each in green. Iran and the United States are highlighted in yellow for twelve studies. China is in red for twenty-five studies. Countries like Germany, Italy, Turkey, Israel, Egypt, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, and others are labeled. Each color represents a different number of studies conducted. FIGURE 4 Clinical trials in different countries. Bar chart showing COVID-19 vaccine development stages across various countries. China leads with twenty-five vaccines, predominantly in Phase 2 and preclinical. Iran and the United States have twelve each, mostly in Phase 1. Other countries have fewer, ranging from two to one vaccine in various phases. Color coding indicates study phases from preclinical to Phase 3. FIGURE 5 Trends in newly registered clinical trials on MSC-EVs and MSC-Exos at different stages each year. Stacked bar chart showing the number of studies by phase from 2014 to 2024. Each bar represents a year, with colors indicating different phases: N/A, Phase 1, Phase 1/Phase 2, Phase 2, Phase 2/Phase 3, Phase 3, and Preclinical Phase. The highest number of studies is in 2020 with 18, and the lowest in 2014, 2017, and 2018 with 1 study each. 3.3 Analysis of MSCs tissue origin in clinical trial datasets We made extensive efforts to collect the sources of MSCs from study titles, abstracts, designs, and intervention methods in the registration database through the MSC-EVs and MSC-Exos related clinical trial datasets. Despite supplementing missing sources in the records, there were still 22 studies that did not clearly mention the tissue sources of the MSCs used. The clearly stated tissue sources in the dataset include: Umbilical cord, Bone marrow, Adipose tissue, Placenta, Wharton’s jelly, Pluripotent stem cells, Tumor stroma. Among these, umbilical cord (14 studies, 29.55%), bone marrow (13 studies, 29.55%), and adipose tissue (10 studies, 22.73%) are the most common sources, with all three having conducted phase III clinical trials ( Figure 6 FIGURE 6 Application of MSCs from different tissues in clinical trials. Bar chart showing study phases for different medical conditions. N/A has the highest total of 22 studies, followed by BM and UC with 13 each, and AD with 10. Other conditions like Placental, Pancreatic cancer, and Wharton Jelly have 4 or fewer studies. Study phases are color-coded, with Phase 1 in dark red and Preclinical Phase in purple. 3.4 Clinical trial dataset disease and injury application analysis Our dataset examined the specificity of diseases in clinical trials, revealing a significant focus on pulmonary disease (26 studies) and a high number of COVID-19-related clinical trials (23 studies). Additionally, skin, eye, anorectal, bone, and joint diseases have also been widely studied. The most common drug administration methods for lung diseases are: intravenous infusion (15 studies), aerosolization (12 studies). Statistics on the sources of MSCs used in different disease types show that in the treatment of lung diseases, MSC-EVs and MSC-Exos derived from bone marrow (BM) and umbilical cord (UC) tissues are significant research hotspots ( Figures 7 8 FIGURE 7 Clinical trials of MSC-EVs and MSC-Exos in different diseases and injuries. Bar chart showing the number of clinical studies for various medical conditions, categorized by study phase. Lungs have the highest count at twenty-six, mostly in Phase 1. Conditions like skin, anorectum, and bones and joints follow. Study phases range from N/A to Preclinical, indicated by different colors in the legend. FIGURE 8 Distribution of MSCs from different tissues in different disease types in clinical trials. Stacked bar chart showing the number of occurrences related to mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) sources for different organs and conditions. Lungs have the highest count at 26, with various sources like AD, BM, and N/A. Other categories include skin, eyes, anorectum, bones and joints, each with varying counts and MSC sources. The legend identifies MSC sources by color. 3.5 Drug administration route analysis of clinical trial datasets The main routes of administration for clinical studies of MSC-EVs and MSC-Exos are intravenous infusion, nebulization, and local administration. The dataset includes the following: intravenous injection (24 studies), local administration (15 studies), nebulization (13 studies). Analysis of the distribution of clinical trial research stages reveals that intravenous infusion and nebulization cover the widest range of clinical trial stages. Both methods have advanced to clinical phase III trials, indicating that intravenous infusion and nebulization are at the forefront of clinical research and are relatively mature methods (see Figure 9 FIGURE 9 Administration of MSC-EVs and MSC-Exos in different disease types. Bar chart showing the distribution of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) sources across different categories. Categories include “IV,” “Local,” “Nebulized,” and others. Colors represent sources such as AD, BM, and more, with “IV” having the highest count of twenty-two. 4 Dose-effect analysis of clinical trial datasets Given the wide range of doses, we attempted to confirm whether there is an optimal dose range for MSC-EVs and MSC-Exos. We screened out six clinical trials with reported results and included them in the final dose-effect comprehensive analysis. The statistical data focused on dose, frequency of administration, administration method, and statistical descriptions and indicators of the effects in the reported results. After integrating the relevant data, Table 2 The results indicated that the disease specificity of clinical trials with relevant results was predominantly lung disease. However, due to differences in the unit mode of MSC-EVs or MSC-Exos in dose calculation-some studies used microgram weight, some calculated by the number of particles, and others stated the number of MSCs used for extraction-a unified standard was adopted as much as possible. The effect indicators were statistically summarized and comprehensively evaluated based on tolerability, safety, adverse events, and dose-effect trends. The 6 clinical trials included in the dose-effect analysis were divided according to the route of administration: Nebulized inhalation: 3 studies, Intravenous infusions: 2 studies. Intravenous infusion of MSCs combined with nebulized inhalation of MSC-EVs: 1 study. Nebulized Inhalation Dose Tolerance and Efficacy: In the study on healthy subjects’ tolerability ( NCT04313647 13 8 NCT04276987 14 8 NCT04491240 15 10 Intravenous Infusion and Combined Administration: In a study involving the simultaneous application of intravenous infusion of MSCs and aerosol inhalation of EVs (IRCT20200217046526N2) ( 16 17 NCT04493242 18 19 Based on the above results, the analysis focused on individual trials reporting at least one effective dose or one less effective dose. The results showed that compared to nebulized inhalation, the intravenous infusion route required a higher dose to reach the effective range. Under the dose intervention conditions, there was a dose-effect trend, suggesting that doses lower or higher than the minimum effective dose (MED) were not ideal. This indicates a relatively narrow optimal effective dose range in the dose-effect relationship. 5 Discussion 5.1 Current clinical landscape and research priorities This study retrieved data from three major databases, identifying 187 global clinical trials involving MSC-derived EVs and Exos. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 66 relevant trials were included, resulting in two research datasets (see Supplementary Appendix Tables 1 2 5.2 Dose–effect relationships and administration-specific considerations Clinical trials with reported results predominantly focus on lung disease, displaying differences in effective dose magnitudes associated with intravenous infusion and aerosol inhalation, as well as a range of minimum effective doses (MEDs) in clinical applications. This dynamic and rapidly evolving field, particularly concerning lung diseases and COVID-19, has significant implications for reducing long-term costs, increasing the reporting of clinical trial results (including negative results), minimizing unnecessary trial duplications, and avoiding ineffective doses. In-depth exploration of these findings reveals potential challenges and future directions. The rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic in exploring MSC-EVs and Exos for therapeutic purposes is both timely and crucial ( 20 21 22 24 The diversity of MSCs sources, particularly umbilical cord, bone marrow, and adipose tissue, highlights the need for a broader understanding of tissue-source specificity and its therapeutic implications ( 25 9 26 28 The dose-effect relationship of MSC-EVs and MSC-Exos is vital for optimizing therapeutic outcomes, ensuring safety, and minimizing adverse effects. This relationship is influenced by multiple factors, including the nature of the disease, route of administration, and patient-specific variables. Determining the optimal dose range is critical to maximizing therapeutic effects while minimizing potential risks. Experimental results indicate that the nature of the disease being treated plays a crucial role in determining the appropriate dose. Diseases localized to specific areas, such as wounds or lung diseases, may respond better to lower doses delivered directly to the affected area. In contrast, systemic diseases may require higher doses or targeted delivery strategies to achieve the desired therapeutic effect ( 29 For lung diseases, aerosolization can deliver treatment directly to the lungs, potentially requiring lower doses compared to systemic administration routes such as intravenous infusion. This direct delivery can enhance local therapeutic effects while reducing systemic exposure and potential side effects ( 28 30 32 5.3 Translational barriers, regulatory challenges, and future directions Regulatory and ethical considerations—such as donor variability, batch-to-batch consistency, and long-term safety—are central to the clinical adoption of MSC-EVs and MSC-Exos. Promoting global collaboration and open data sharing can accelerate progress by pooling resources, expertise, and datasets, thereby avoiding duplication and facilitating faster translation into patient benefit. However, commercialization introduces additional challenges, including scaling up production, maintaining product quality, ensuring affordability, and securing equitable access. While commercial cell banks may mitigate some logistical issues, they also raise concerns regarding proprietary technologies, cost structures, and fair distribution. Despite growing therapeutic promise, MSC-EVs translation remains constrained by persistent methodological, regulatory, and commercial barriers. Unlike conventional biologics or cell-based therapies, MSC-EVs lack standardized definitions for product identity, dosing units, and potency metrics—undermining reproducibility and delaying regulatory approval. Manufacturing heterogeneity, arising from differences in tissue source, donor characteristics, culture conditions, and isolation methods, further contributes to batch inconsistency. The absence of validated potency assays and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) data limits quality control and leaves uncertainties regarding biodistribution, clearance, and optimal dosing schedules. Cross-trial comparisons are hampered by inconsistent dose reporting (e.g., particle counts, protein content, volume) and reliance on unvalidated surrogate endpoints such as CRP or IL-6. To date, no MSC-EVs product has been approved by the FDA, EMA, or comparable authorities, reflecting a fragmented global regulatory framework for EV classification, GMP compliance, and clinical evaluation. Compounding these issues is the uncontrolled proliferation of unregulated “exosome therapies” outside formal clinical frameworks, posing substantial risks to patient safety and eroding scientific credibility. Addressing these concerns requires internationally harmonized manufacturing, characterization, and reporting protocols; consensus-driven nomenclature (e.g., per MISEV guidelines); validated clinical endpoints; and regulatory convergence. Designing clinical trials with standardized dosing metrics, robust dose–response evaluation, and comprehensive adverse event reporting will be critical to defining optimal therapeutic windows across diseases and administration routes. Ultimately, advancing MSC-EVs from experimental tools to evidence-based therapeutics will demand coordinated efforts from academia, industry, and regulatory agencies to establish rigorous standards, protect patient safety, and uphold scientific integrity. As the field evolves, integration of precision medicine approaches and patient-centered strategies will be pivotal to fully realizing the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs in clinical practice.
