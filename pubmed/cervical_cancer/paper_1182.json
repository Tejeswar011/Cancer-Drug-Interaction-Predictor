These include the human papilloma virus (HPV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi sarcoma human herpes virus 2/human herpes virus 8 (KSHHV/HHV8), hepatitis B virus, (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Merkel cell polyoma virus (McPyV), and the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). These viruses cause malignancies ranging from carcinomas, sarcomas, lymphomas, to leukemias. This review aims to study the effects and efficacy of vaccines against these viruses and the cancers they cause in their prevention and treatment. Methods: The literature in the past 30 years was searched employing Scopus and Google Scholar using the keywords “oncogenic viruses, HPV, EBV, KSHHV, HHV8, Polyoma virus, HTLV-1, COVID-19, carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, leukemia, anti-virus vaccines”. Results: Prophylactic vaccines against the HPV and HBV are highly effective in preventing and reducing the incidence of uterine cervical and hepatocellular carcinomas. Prophylactic vaccines against other oncogenic viruses have been less successful, though efficacious in some experimental animals. Therapeutic vaccines are still mostly under evaluation and development. Conclusions: Identification of oncogenic viruses has rendered anti-viral vaccines conspicuous tools for preventing and treating cancers they cause. Many endeavors for the development of such vaccines have been met with limited success, apart from the very effective anti-HPV and anti-HBV vaccines in universal vaccination programs. With the development of new vaccine technologies, it is hoped that effective vaccines against other oncogenic viruses will be developed in the future. oncogenic viruses vaccines prevention therapy This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Cancers attributed to infections account for 13–15% (about 2.2 million cases) of all human cancers, with viruses accounting for more than 60% of infection-attributed cancers in 2018 [ 1 2 3 4 5 Table 1 6 7 8 9 6 10 6 11 12 6 7 6 7 10 11 12 11 12 13 14 2. Vaccine Technologies and Platforms The goal of vaccination is to induce an immunological response to insulting agents [ 15 16 15 16 2.1. Anti-Viral Vaccines 2.1.1. Protein Platform Whole Inactivated (Killed) Vaccines This involves the inactivation/killing of whole viruses by chemical or physical means or both [ 15 17 16 17 15 17 Live Attenuated Vaccines Viruses are attenuated through serial passaging under suboptimal conditions or temperatures and using genetic engineering methods that increase replication fidelity or codon de-optimization. These methods select mutations that disable their viral pathogenic capacities [ 15 17 18 19 20 15 17 21 22 15 17 23 Virus-like Particle (VLP) Vaccines VLPs are macromolecular assemblies of viral structural components, meant to imitate the morphology and protein structure of the virus. VLPs are bio-manufactured after transfection of bacterial, yeast, insect, plant, or mammalian cells with one or more genetic constructs of the virus, resulting in self-assembly into incomplete viral protein particles [ 24 25 26 Synthetic Peptide Vaccines (SPVs) SPVs contain immunodominant viral peptides that require extensive in vitro screening and modeling to discover. SVPs are synthesized using fragment condensation or solid-phase synthesis. These small peptides are mixed with or conjugated to carefully chosen adjuvants to avoid peptide denaturation and to enhance uptake by APCs. SPVs are safe and cause focused epitope-specific immune responses, though epitope restriction reduces response breadth and may result in escape variants of the virus [ 15 17 2.1.2. Nucleic Acid Platforms (NAPs) NAPs use selected nucleic acid sequences to generate viral proteins and antigens that are not disease-causing, with production of potent host immune responses [ 15 17 15 17 Bacterial and Viral Vectored Vaccines These vaccines utilize non-pathogenic or attenuated pathogenic bacteria and viruses as carriers of nucleic acid sequences of the target pathogenic virus. Bacterial vectored vaccines are suitable for mucosal administration. Though there is a risk of infection by the bacterial vector in the immunocompromised, the risk is much mitigated by identification and deletion of bacterial virulence genes with genetic engineering. Viral vectors retain infectivity and express the encoded target antigen. Replication incompetent vectors do not cause productive infection and are safe and easy to manufacture. Examples of bacterial vectors are non-pathogenic Lactobacillus sp. and attenuated Yersinia pestis. Some viral vector examples are vesicular stomatitis virus, vaccinia, adenovirus, poxvirus, and Newcastle disease virus [ 15 17 27 28 29 Synthetic DNA Vaccines (SDNAVs) SDNAVs are large, polyanionic, and nuclease sensitive and require special methods of delivery to recipients, including the more commonly used electroporation and nanoparticle systems [ 15 30 31 mRNA-Based Vaccines (mRNAVs) The drawbacks are RNA short half-life and reduced protein translation, aggravated by the recipient’s inflammatory response, which are circumvented by loading the mRNA into liposomes [ 15 17 32 33 34 15 35 15 36 32 37 2.2. Anti-Cancer Vaccines (ACVs) ACVs are therapeutic vaccines developed against established cancers, including virus-induced cancers. As for anti-viral vaccines, the aim of ACVs is to elicit potent immunity, mostly cellular immunity, against cancer cell antigens that are exogenously or endogenously introduced. ACVs may also augment host immunity or induce changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The former requires cancer antigens for presentation to DC, helper and cytotoxic T-cells, and other cellular constituents of the TME. Another concern of ACVs is the possible development of intrinsic tumor resistance to the vaccine due to cancer cell genomic instability with alteration in expression and processing of tumor antigens [ 16 38 39 16 40 16 41 42 2.2.1. ACV Technologies and Platforms Tumor Antigens The quality of tumor antigens is at the center stage of ACVs for robust effectiveness and efficacy. There are two commonly used categories of antigens. (a) Neoantigens Neoantigens are mutated tumor antigens produced through non-synonymous somatic and frameshift mutations and in coding regions, human endogenous retroviruses, post-translational protein phosphorylation, citrullination, and glycosylation [ 16 43 44 45 46 16 47 (b) Shared antigens These ACVs utilize several shared tumor-associated antigens, usually applicable to tumors with low TMB [ 16 48 49 ACV Platforms These include direct antigen administration using neoantigens, RNA, and synthetic long peptides. They could be administered intramuscularly, intravenously, by antigen delivery through loaded DCs or non-cellular particles, nanoparticles, lipoplexes, amphophilic systems, liposomes, or polyethy-eneimine silica microrods [ 16 50 51 52 In Situ Vaccines (ISVs) ISVs are antigen-agnostic and not targeted at any individual tumor antigen. They aim to enhance endogenous anti-tumor responses by affecting the TME or causing anti-tumor effects at distal sites in addition to the local site of treatment by abscopal effect [ 16 40 16 40 53 54 40 55 56 57 58 Combined Vaccination This strategy may be employed in advanced cancers as part of a multiphasic approach (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and vaccination) [ 16 2.3. Adjuvants Adjuvants are substances that enhance vaccine immunogenicity. While inactivated vaccines contain adjuvants introduced during vaccine production, most modern vaccines contain small components of the target proteins/antigens and may require additional adjuvants. Adjuvants range from aluminum salts, emulsions, liposomes, nanoparticles, to VLPs. Adjuvants target innate immune cells and activate pattern recognition signaling pathways [ 59 60 61 55 59 60 61 3. The Oncogenic Viruses, Attributed Tumors and Vaccines Viruses may cause cancer by acting as oncogenes, activating host oncogenes, creating host genomic instability, inhibiting host tumor suppressor genes and proteins, interfering with cellular signaling pathways, increasing cell proliferation, resisting cell apoptosis, affecting DNA repair, contributing to tumor evasion through genetic or epigenetic mechanisms, and causing chronic inflammation [ 2 3 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 1 2 3 6 7 3.1. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) 3.1.1. Virology and Oncogenesis The HPV is a non-enveloped DNA virus with a double-stranded genome containing about 8000 base pairs. The genome is enclosed in an icosahedral capsid made up of the structural proteins L1 and L2, which are encoded by the late region of the HPV genome. Non-structural proteins E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, and E7 are encoded by the early region, and E6 and E7 are most essential for oncogenesis. The HPV belongs to the family Papillomaviridae, in which more than 400 HPV genotypes have been identified and categorized into the five genera: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Mu, and Nu. The Alpha HPVs contribute most to oncogenesis. HPV genotypes are classified according to their oncogenic potential into high-risk (hrHPV) or low-risk (lrHPV). The hrHPV are 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68. HPV16 and 18 are responsible for more than 70% of global cervical cancer cases [ 4 5 62 63 The prototype of HPV oncogenesis is uterine cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in women in 2020 [ 62 63 FH1T KLF5 LINC00392 MACROD2. MACROD2 PAR1 HPV integration disrupts the E2 open-reading frame, causing loss of E1/E2 interaction for initiating viral replication, dysfunctional E2 regulation of the viral early promoter, and overexpression of oncoproteins E6 and E7. The integration percentage increases with disease progression from CIN to cervical cancer. Overexpression of E6 and E7 further promotes HPV integration in the journey to cancer development [ 1 2 3 4 5 62 ERBB3 HER3 CASP8 HLA-A SHKBP1 TGFBR2 63 64 62 65 62 66 62 66 62 67 68 PIK3A 69 70 3.1.2. HPV-Associated Cancers About 91% of HPV-associated cancers in women are cervical cancers, which is the most common HPV-associated cancer subsequent to persistent infection in 5–15% of affected women [ 62 63 60 61 62 63 61 63 HPV-associated cervical cancers include adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). SCC is classified histologically as non-keratinizing, keratinizing, basaloid, condylomatous, papillary, or rarely lymphoepithelioma-like [ 71 Figure 1 71 72 1 3 6 1 73 3.1.3. Vaccines These include prophylactic vaccines for disease prevention and therapeutic vaccines to treat established cancers. Prophylactic Vaccines (PVs) PVs against HPV were first licensed in 2006. Currently, there are six licensed recombinant DNA PVs, manufactured based on purified L1 structural protein. The proteins produced from HPV type-specific empty shells or VLPs are potent immunogens bearing no pathogenic or infectious potential. They are fortified with adjuvants, and all are against HPV16 and 18. The vaccines are bivalent (HPV16 and 18), quadrivalent (HPV6,11,16,18), and nonavalent (HPV6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58) [ 1 74 75 Table 2 1 1 12 74 75 1 Therapeutic Vaccines (TVs) TVs are based on mechanisms discussed under Section 2.2 76 77 62 76 3.1.4. Viral Coinfections While HPV is the primary causative oncovirus and can cause cancer as a soloist on its own, coinfections with HIV and EBV, which aggravate the incidence and severity of the cancer caused, may act as duets or trios. HPV and HIV The incidence of HPV-associated anal, cervical, and oropharyngeal cancer is 80, 22, and 6 times higher in HIV-infected compared to HIV-uninfected subjects [ 78 79 80 81 82 81 83 84 81 80 85 86 HPV and EBV Coinfection with EBV has been documented in HPV-associated CIN and cervical cancers [ 87 88 89 90 91 89 90 88 89 90 1 3 62 3 90 91 HPV, HIV, and EBV Coinfections of the three viruses are observed in HPV-associated cancers [ 88 92 93 3.2. Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) 3.2.1. Virology and Oncogenesis EBV is a ubiquitous gamma herpes enveloped double-stranded DNA virus also known as human herpes virus 4 (HHV4). It infects over 90% of the world’s human population and spreads by oral secretions. Most infections occur during early childhood and are asymptomatic. Development of infectious mononucleosis is rare, though more frequent in well-developed countries [ 7 13 94 7 94 94 95 7 96 7 There are three patterns of latency with differential expression of six nuclear proteins (EBNA1, 2, 3A, 3B, 3C, and leader protein EBNA-LP), three latent membrane proteins (LMP1, 2A, and 2B), BART mRNA, and EBER 1 and 2 (EBV small non-coding non-adenylated RNA). Restricted EBV products expression is present in latency 1 (EBNA1, EBERs, and BARTs) and latency 2 (LMP1, LMP2, EBNA1, EBERs, and BARTs). Latency 1 is observed in Burkitt’s lymphoma. Latency 2 expression is present in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), gastric cancer (GC), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and NK/T-cell lymphoma (NK/TL). Latency 3 expresses the full repertoire of EBV products and is observed in lymphoproliferative diseases associated with immunodeficiency. Among the latency proteins, LMP1 is the major transforming protein mimicking constitutive CD40 receptor signaling, causing cell proliferation. Other EBV proteins interact with signaling pathways, cause c-myc MHC-II 7 8 94 95 97 98 99 100 3 7 8 9 99 100 101 Apart from latency products, EBV lytic products also contribute to oncogenesis [ 60 94 96 99 100 101 BZL1 BRLF1 BALF5 BART BHRF1-2 3 97 99 102 103 104 Ig 105 3.2.2. EBV-Associated Cancers Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) NPC is a rare cancer worldwide but shows high prevalence in southern China, south-east Asia, among Inuit populations in Alaska and Canada, and some populations in northern Africa (Algeria, Tunisia) [ 106 107 106 Figure 2 106 108 109 MDS-EV11 TNFRSF19 CDKN2A CDKN2B TERTICLPTM1L CDKN2A TGFBR2 104 110 111 Gastric Cancer (GC) EBV-associated GC accounts for <10% of GC worldwide, depending on the region and detection methodology [ 112 113 114 115 116 112 112 116 115 EBV-positive GC is one of the molecular GC subtypes proposed by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network. It displays PIK3CA ARID1A CD274 PD-L1 112 113 114 115 116 There is a predilection for the proximal stomach or gastric stump and the male sex. The prognosis of EBV-associated GC is better than the non-EBV-associated counterparts. Treatment is surgical resection in the early stage, and advanced-stage GC may require DNA methylation inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, EBNA1 inhibitors, and EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell infusion [ 112 117 Lymphoepithelial Carcinoma of the Lung (LEC) LEC is classified as a poorly differentiated SCC in the WHO Classification [ 118 118 119 120 Figure 2 120 Thymus Epithelial Tumors (TETs) TETs encompass thymomas and thymic carcinomas. Despite isolated reports of EBV association in thymomas, the involvement of EBV in thymomas remains controversial [ 121 122 123 121 122 124 124 124 125 123 124 Burkitt’s Lymphoma (BL) The role of EBV in BL has recently been elucidated. The defining molecular event in BL is the juxtaposition of the myc IGH IGL IGK myc 126 myc 97 102 EBV is associated with almost 100% of BL in endemic areas (sub-Saharan Africa, Malawi, Uganda, Cameroon) but shows much lower association (20%) in other areas (sporadic BL) or immunodeficiency-associated BL [ 127 TCF3 ID3 128 129 99 130 131 132 BL is characterized histologically by invasive sheets of immunophenotypically B lymphoma cells with squared off cytoplasmic borders, round nuclei, fine clumped chromatin, brisk mitotic activity, often with interspersed tangible body histiocytes to impart the characteristic “starry sky” appearance ( Figure 3 126 133 126 133 134 Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) HL is classified into classic HL (CHL) and nodular lymphocyte predominant HL (NLPHL). The neoplastic cells in CHL are the Hodgkin and Reed–Sternberg (HRS) cells, while those in NLPHL are germinal center-derived B-cells known as LP (lymphocyte predominant) cells [ 135 IGH 104 136 135 135 Figure 3 135 Extranodal NK/T-Cell Lymphoma (ENNKTL) Most (60–90%) ENNKTL are derived from NK cells, and the remaining 10–40% from T-cells [ 7 137 TCR TCR Figure 4 7 133 137 myc 7 133 137 7 133 138 7 133 139 EBV+ Nodal T- and NK-Cell Lymphoma (NTNKL) EBV plays a major etiologic role in EBV+ NTNKL [ 7 139 7 140 Systemic EBV+ T-Cell Lymphoma of Childhood (SEBVTCLC) There is a strong EBV etiologic association related to an undefined genetic defect in the host immune response to EBV [ 141 7 7 7 Aggressive NK Cell Leukemia (ANKL) ANKLs are rare and almost always EBV-associated. About 20 cases of EBV-negative ANKL have been reported [ 7 142 7 EBV+ Inflammatory Follicular Dendritic Cell Sarcoma (IFDCS) EBV+ IFDCS is rare, with only about 80 reported cases, and is distinct from EBV-negative FDCS. It affects predominantly the spleen and liver, though GIT and upper aerodigestive tract cases have been reported [ 143 144 145 143 144 145 Other EBV-Associated Lymphoproliferative Diseases (LPDs) These include EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (MCU), lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LyG), EBV-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL), and plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). These conditions are pathogenetically related to immunodeficiency and dysfunction (IDD). In EBV+ DLBL, which affects mostly the elderly, IDD may be due to immunosenescence, which may also account for IDD in LyG. In EBV+ MCU, IDD may be inborn or acquired. IDD in PBL is acquired (as in HIV infection or immunosuppressive therapy) or related to immunosenescence. IDD causes an abnormal host response to EBV. EBV+ MCU affects the mucosal and cutaneous tissue only, while LyG affects the lungs predominantly. Both MCU and LyG show invasion by polymorphous atypical lymphoid cells with frequent angioinvasion and necrosis (in high-grade LyG). EBV+ DLBL may be nodal or extranodal with polymorphic or monomorphic lymphoid infiltrates dominated by blastic cells exhibiting the activated B-cell immunophenotype (IRF4/MUM1+). EBV+ MCU may regress spontaneously after correction of IDD. The prognosis of LyG and EBV+ DLBL is variable. PBL is prognostically poor [ 146 147 148 149 3.2.3. EBV Vaccines Considering the multitude of cancers etiologically and pathogenetically related to EBV infection, prevention of EBV infection is theoretically effective in preventing a multitude of EBV-related cancers [ 13 Prophylactic Vaccine EBV infects primarily B-cells and epithelial cells. The envelope proteins gH/gL, gB (the core fusion machinery), and gp350 bind to CD21 on the B-cell surface, followed by cell entry. Entry of EBV into epithelial cells involves binding of EBV BMRF2 to epithelial cell integrins, followed by gH/gL and gB binding. To prevent EBV infection, these envelope proteins pose obvious targets for vaccine development [ 13 91 96 150 13 96 150 151 150 150 150 152 99 150 153 154 7 13 155 156 Therapeutic Vaccine A Phase 1 trial for a peptide vaccine against LMP2 and a Phase 2 trial for a viral vectored vaccine against EBNA1/LMP2 for NPC have been completed. There is also an ongoing mRNA vaccine trial for NPC [ 154 Table 3 3.2.4. Viral Coinfections EBV and HPV The interplay of this coinfection in uterine cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and SCC has been discussed under Section 3.1.4 Coinfection of EBV and Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpes Virus (KSHV) This will be discussed in the following sections. EBV and HIV HIV coinfection dampens the host immune response against EBV, thus aggravating the cancer severity and incidence. EBV+ BL and HL occur more frequently in HIV co-infected subjects. The inflammatory microenvironment and the HIV antigens promote the growth of EBV-associated lymphoma cells. This repertoire induces increased mutation rate and myc 91 99 3.3. Kaposi Sarcoma-Associated Herpes Virus (KSHV) 3.3.1. Virology and Oncogenesis KSHV, also known as human herpes virus 8 (HHV8), was identified as herpes-like DNA sequences in HIV-associated Kaposi sarcoma [ 157 158 159 158 160 99 158 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 158 160 171 172 173 174 3 163 171 172 173 3.3.2. KSHV-Associated Cancers The non-neoplastic KSHV-associated MCCD and KSHV-positive germinotropic lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) [ 156 Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) KS is a vascular neoplasm of intermediate malignant potential and behavior, varying from indolent to locally aggressive. It is named after Moritz Kaposi, who first described the disease as “idiopathic multiple pigmented sarcoma of the skin” in 1872 [ 175 159 Lymph nodes may be primarily involved or secondarily involved when draining a nearby KS. The early lesion occurs in the nodal capsule, with extension along fibrous trabeculae of the lymph node. The early lesion is subtle and difficult to recognize. In the tumoral stage, there are interlacing fascicles of deceptively bland-looking mitotically inactive spindle cells forming a sieve-like pattern with erythrocyte-filled vascular spaces. The tumor cells express an endothelial cell immunophenotype. The diagnostic marker is LANA detectable by immunohistochemistry [ 158 160 Figure 5 171 There is at present no curative treatment for KS [ 164 163 164 172 Primary Effusion Lymphoma (PEL) PEL is a large B-cell lymphoma presenting as lymphomatous effusions and rarely as body cavity-related tumor masses. Most are HIV-positive with frequent EBV coinfection [ 99 165 166 167 176 177 166 167 168 169 170 167 169 170 KSHV-Positive Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBL) KSHV+ DLBL are rare and occur in a backdrop of severe immunodeficiency involving lymph nodes and/or spleen with possible extranodal and peripheral blood dissemination. It affects mostly HIV+ men aged 30–40 years. There is infiltration by sheets of blastic B-cells positive for LANA. It is extremely aggressive with a poor prognosis [ 178 3.3.3. KSHV Vaccines KSHV vaccines target KSHV structural glycoproteins that are important for host cell attachment, fusion, and entry. These are K8.1, gB, gH, gL, gM, and gN [ 14 179 14 180 181 182 14 14 14 180 181 3.3.4. Viral Coinfections KSHV and HIV This is a common occurrence in KS, KSHK+ PEL, and DLBL, as discussed above. KSHV and EBV This may be observed in PEL, where the outcome may be better [ 170 176 183 184 KSHV, HIV, and EBV This may occur in KSHV+ DLBL, where EBV occurs in 80% of cases. Coinfection with EBV in HIV+ KS of the conjunctiva has also been reported [ 185 3.4. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 3.4.1. Virology and Role in Oncogenesis HIV is an RNA retrovirus belonging to the subgroup lentivirus [ 186 187 188 186 186 187 186 187 187 HIV has not been identified to cause a specific cancer. The role of HIV in oncogenesis is mostly through immune dysfunction, persistent immune activation, and chronic inflammation caused by the infection. Coinfection with HIV and other oncogenic viruses positively contributes to cancer development [ 82 99 189 190 82 190 3.4.2. HIV Vaccines Identification of the various viral proteins and their roles in host cell infection has spawned much research in HIV vaccine development. More than 20 candidate vaccines developed against the proteins gp120, gp160, multimeric gp120, and V3 peptide have been tried in human subjects, including prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines [ 187 191 3.4.3. Viral Coinfections Coinfection of HIV with the oncogenic viruses HPV, EBV, and KSHV results in increased incidence and severity of the cancers caused, as discussed above. The role of HIV coinfection in oncogenesis induced by the hepatitis viruses B and C will be discussed below. 3.5. Hepatitis Viruses 3.5.1. Virology and Oncogenesis Hepatitis B (HBV) HBV is a partial double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Hepadnaviridae family. There are eight genotypes A to H. It consists of one complete coding minus (−) strand and one incomplete non-coding plus (+) strand. There is encapsulation by a lipoprotein membrane constituted by three hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg): large, middle, and small forms. The nucleocapsid is composed of the hepatitis B core protein (HBc), viral polymerase (pol), and the viral genome DNA. Entry into the host cell entails low specificity binding between HBsAg and heparin sulfate proteoglycans on the hepatocytic surface, followed by high-affinity interaction between the HBV envelope and sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide receptor on hepatocytes, endocytosis of the virion, and release of relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) into the hepatocytic cytoplasm. rcDNA is converted into covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which encodes for RNA and is then translated to produce structural and non-structural viral proteins. Persistence and stability of cccDNA are key to HBV chronic infection. cccDNA also transcribes to pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), which is reverse transcribed to double-stranded linear DNA (dlsDNA). The latter is responsible for the integration of the viral genome into host DNA, which is important for hepatocytic damage and carcinogenesis. While viral integration was believed to be random, there is recent evidence that host cancer-associated gene segments may be favored sites for integration. These are fragile chromosomal sites containing HBV preferred CpG islands. These sites are TERT KMT2B CCNE1 PAK3 CCND1 FGF19 TERT 192 193 194 195 192 193 194 195 195 HBV is a class I carcinogen and a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [ 196 192 197 Hepatitis C (HCV) HCV is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. It consists of the structural proteins E1 and E2, and non-structural proteins P7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. There is extraordinary genetic diversity with seven genotypes and more than 80 subtypes [ 198 199 200 200 199 201 202 199 3.5.2. Hepatitis Virus—Associated Cancers HBV and BCV are major causes of HCC. Other cancers that can be caused by HCV will not be covered in this section. HCC accounts for 75–85% of primary liver cancers, being the 6th most common cancer and the 4th leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. It is more common in Africa, China, and Southeast Asia [ 203 204 205 205 Figure 5 205 206 205 3.5.3. Hepatitis Virus Vaccines HBV Several Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved multimeric particulate anti-HBV vaccines are available. These are prophylactic neutralizing recombinant vaccines developed against the HBsAg, specifically against the major hydrophilic region (MHR) containing all three forms of HBsAg. They provide protection against all HBV genotypes (A to H). However, alterations of residues within the MHR can result in replication of the mutated virus, which would evade protection by the vaccines [ 207 208 Table 2 11 196 209 210 211 212 213 HCV Despite knowledge and understanding of the structural envelope, non-structural, and core proteins of the virus, no approved effective anti-HCV vaccines are available to date. This may be related to a lack of high replication of HCV in non-human primate cell lines, which impairs the development of live attenuated vaccines, the great virus genetic diversity and subtype variability, poor understanding of the host immune response to HCV, and difficulty in recruiting study cohorts due to social, psychological, and marginalization issues [ 198 214 198 214 215 201 3.5.4. Viral Coinfections HBV and HIV or HCV and HIV Apart from HIV-induced immunodeficiency causing decreased clearance of HBV or HCV from the liver, HIV may contribute to oncogenesis through increased liver damage, inflammation, and fibrosis. HIV infection results in elevated levels of circulating lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the portal and systemic circulation. LPS activates hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and Kupffer cells (KFCs), thus inducing oxidative damage, proinflammatory cytokine release, and fibrosis. HIV can directly infect HSCs and KFCs, leading to similar pro-oncogenic results. In HIV/HCV coinfected individuals, HCC occurs at a younger age, with the risk of HCC development being increased by 11% each year compared to HIV-negative individuals [ 82 188 216 217 HBV and HCV Coinfections of HBV and HCV increase the risk of HCC compared to the mono-infections. The coinfections cause greater progression to advanced chronic liver disease and HCC. This may be related to long chronic disease duration, high levels of liver fibrosis, and carbohydrate intolerance [ 218 219 220 HBV, HCV, and HIV Coinfections of HBV, HCV, and HIV carry higher risks of HCC development compared to HBV or HCV mono-infections. The triple infection, however, carries a lower rate of HCC compared to coinfections with HCV and HIV [ 221 3.6. The Merkel Cell Polyoma Virus (McPyV) 3.6.1. Virology and Oncogenesis The McPyV is the only oncogenic virus among the 14 human polyomaviruses. It was discovered in 2008 [ 222 223 224 225 223 224 223 224 226 223 224 225 223 225 226 223 225 226 3.6.2. The McPyV-Associated Cancers The major McPyV-associated cancer is Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC), though other malignancies, including skin SCC, basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and cutaneous B- and T-cell lymphomas have also been related to McPyV [ 224 226 224 226 226 227 228 224 228 224 227 228 224 225 226 227 228 3.6.3. McPyV Vaccines Despite knowledge of the McPyV capsid structural proteins V1, V2, and V3 and the oncoproteins Lt and sT, no effective approved anti-McPyV vaccine has become available [ 229 230 229 230 231 232 233 229 229 230 231 232 233 230 3.6.4. Viral Coinfections Coinfection with HIV interplays with McPyV in oncogenesis. The incidence of MCC in HIV infected individuals is 13 times higher than in the general population [ 227 234 235 227 234 235 3.7. The Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type-1 (HTLV-1)/Human T-lymphotropic Virus 3.7.1. Virology and Oncogenesis HTLV-1 is a retrovirus belonging to the family Retroviridiae and genus Deltaretrovirus [ 236 237 238 239 240 241 236 237 238 239 240 241 240 236 240 236 237 238 239 240 236 237 238 239 Oncogenesis is related to two factors: duration of infection and a high proviral load (PVL). PVL is the percentage of peripheral blood mononuclear cells infected by HTLV-1. The infected cell clones pass through many mitotic events, especially associated with a long infection duration, and become plagued with replication errors and mutations. Some of these replicative errors are deleterious and lead to oncogenesis [ 240 PRKBB PLCGL1 VAV CARD11 IRF4 GATA3 IKZF2 CCR4 CCR7 GPR183 237 240 240 The HTLV-1 regulatory proteins Tax and NZB contribute by causing genomic instability and conferring survival or proliferative advantage to the infected clones. Tax expression is, however, frequently lost in 50% of Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) clones and may thus be contributory only in the early stages of oncogenesis. HBZ, on the other hand, is retained in all ATL clones and may be a good target for vaccine development [ 240 3.7.2. HTLV-1-Associated Cancer HTLV-1 is prevalent in Japan, Africa, the Caribbean islands, and Central and South America [ 239 239 241 239 239 242 240 3.7.3. HTLV-1 Vaccine Despite tremendous efforts to develop an effective vaccine, through employing multiple platforms and targeting structural and non-structural proteins of the virus, no effective vaccines have become available [ 241 243 239 240 241 3.8. SARS-CoV-2 Virus 3.8.1. Virology and Possible Oncogenetic Mechanisms The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a coronavirus belonging to the genus Betacoronvirus. It was responsible for the pandemic COVID-19 (coronavirus infectious disease 2019) and caused infections of hundreds of millions and a death toll of millions of people [ 244 245 244 245 246 247 244 245 244 245 246 248 6 7 249 246 247 248 250 251 252 253 254 250 251 255 256 257 3.8.2. Vaccines The surprise and rapid onset of the COVID-19 pandemic triggered accelerated development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines [ 17 23 258 4. Developing New Vaccines 4.1. Defining Endpoints for Clinical Vaccine Trials Vaccine trials, like all clinical trials, are conducted in the sequence of preclinical, Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 studies. Each trial aims to evaluate the candidate vaccine for its safety/tolerability and immunogenicity, with increasing numbers of enrolled human subjects in Phases 1, 2, 3, and 4 trials. Vaccines successful in Phase 3 trials may be licensed by regulatory agencies. Several endpoints of the trials need to be defined: safety endpoints (SEs), immunogenicity endpoints (IEs), and primary endpoints (PEs). SEs range from common side effects to rare adverse events. IEs may include humoral and/or cellular immune response parameters, analyzed separately or with multiplicity adjustment. PEs are particularly problematic for the evaluation of therapeutic vaccines, as oncovirus-attributed cancers develop after long latency infections requiring long-term follow-up of study subjects, rendering the trials difficult and impractical. Setting cancer development as a primary endpoint is also potentially unethical. Surrogate endpoints may be adopted to circumvent these issues, but may pose a problem of their validity in predicting cancer development and progression [ 259 4.2. Clinical Vaccine Trials, Difficulties and Prospects Despite the accumulated body of knowledge in virology and the mechanisms of virus-attributed cancers, the development of vaccines against many oncoviruses remains disappointing. Apart from the effective approved prophylactic vaccines against HPV and HBV, which have been adopted in universal vaccination programs in many parts of the world with promising results in prevention of the infections and attributed cancers, effective prophylactic vaccines for other oncoviruses and therapeutic vaccines development for human subjects remain disenchanting. This may be related to various factors. Some viruses display multiple strains with genetic diversity [ 198 214 62 191 192 193 194 195 191 14 99 173 198 205 214 201 259 260 Table 3 5. Conclusions Oncogenic viruses are responsible for 13–15% of human cancers [ 1 2 3 4 5 Acknowledgments The author thanks JL Qi, Pathology, First Affiliated Hospital, and Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China, for supplying images of ENNKTL in Figure 4 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Conflicts of Interest The author declares no conflicts of interest.
