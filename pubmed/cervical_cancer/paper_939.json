We aimed to test the hypothesis that cervical motion tenderness (or parametropathy) may serve as a diagnostic tool for CPPS. Methods We examined the prevalence of parametropathy in patients with and without chronic pelvic pain by analyzing consecutive vaginal examinations in 155 women ≥ 18 years. Patients with malignant pelvic tumors, acute inflammatory disease, abnormal bleeding, genital atrophy, or pregnancy were excluded. Results from repeat examinations were also excluded. Parametropathy was defined as tenderness at three different points (left, middle, and right vaginal fornix) on bimanual examination, expressed by the patient on a three-digit scale: Pain index 0, absent; 1, slight tenderness; 2, remarkable tenderness. A pain index (PI) of 2 at one or more sites was considered positive. Results We included 155 first examinations, 125 for preventive screening (control group), and 30 examinations from patients with lower abdominal pain for ≥ 6 months. Parametropathy with a PI ≥ 2 in ≥ 1 site was found in 96.7% of the pain group, and in 7.2% of the control group ( p p Conclusions Parametropathy, defined as cervical motion tenderness, is a positive sign of chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The cervical motion test to detect parametropathy can be used both as a screening tool and to confirm suspected chronic pelvic pain syndrome. We suggest including this easy-to-perform clinical test in every gynecological examination. By doing so, chronic pelvic pain syndrome will no longer be a diagnosis of exclusion.

Chronic pelvic pain syndrome is an unresolved burden for many women. It has a high prevalence and poses a significant financial strain on healthcare systems. This prospective observational study investigated the prevalence of cervical motion tenderness (parametropathy) as part of a gynecological examination and its diagnostic value (sensitivity and specificity) in chronic pelvic pain.  What was learned from this study? Testing for parametropathy in bimanual gynecological examination has a high diagnostic value for the chronic pelvic pain syndrome. The test will expand the clinical examination in two ways: (a) in a screening setting, it will detect patients with a chronic pelvic pain syndrome with a high sensitivity; (b) in the absence of signs of acute inflammatory disease, this test will confirm chronic pelvic pain with a high specificity. This simple clinical test should be incorporated into every gynecological examination. Introduction CPPS as a Diagnosis of Exclusion Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) in women is defined as lower abdominal pain of unclear origin lasting for more than 6 months [ 1 2 3 1 4 6 4 6 7 8 9 10 13 Gynecological causes such as endometriosis and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) are well-documented contributors to CPP. Endometriosis is defined by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, leading to cyclic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and infertility [ 35 19 20 Musculoskeletal disorders, particularly pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD), also contribute significantly to CPP. PFD includes myofascial pain syndromes, muscle hypertonicity, and trigger points within the levator ani and obturator internus muscles [ 14 16 Some researchers have identified increased tension and tenderness of the pelvic floor muscles in patients with CPP, thus giving rise to the alternative term myofascial pelvic pain 14 18 pelvic congestion syndrome 8 19 20 1 A taxonomy based on “absence of any other disease” is unsatisfactory because it may encompass distinct, unrelated disorders. It is therefore necessary to identify a positive diagnostic sign to define the disease more precisely. A non-invasive screening tool would enable the investigation of disease covariates and thus help determine the need for further screening with invasive measures, thereby laying the foundation for the development of improved therapeutic strategies. In this study, we introduce the term “parametropathy” as a clinical sign, rather than a disease entity, defined as tenderness in the parametrium elicited during bimanual gynecological examination. It was first described by H. Martius and later by his coworkers [ 10 13 1 3 7 8 21 22 23 22 24 26 In chronic pain disorders without acute symptoms, the prevalence of cervical motion tenderness has not yet been described. This sign is also distinct from gynecologic pathologies such as endometriosis and PCS, and from musculoskeletal conditions like PFD. The identification of such a sign may facilitate the recognition of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) as a diagnosable condition rather than one of exclusion. Aim of the Study We aimed to investigate the prevalence of paracervical tenderness (parametropathy, PMP) in both healthy and unhealthy cohorts. To our knowledge, there is no current data on the prevalence of paracervical tenderness in women suffering from CPP or in a healthy female population. Here, we present the results of our prospective data collection from women with and without pelvic symptoms. Ultimately, our goal is to assess the diagnostic value of cervical motion tenderness (parametropathy) during clinical examinations. If parametropathy is found to be strongly correlated with CPP, it will enhance the diagnosis of CPP, moving beyond its current status as merely a diagnosis of exclusion. The PMP sign will facilitate the screening and confirmation of CPPS, leading to the development of better therapeutic strategies for CPPS based on this new taxonomy. Materials and Methods Patients Cohort Examinations were performed between July 2018 and December 2020 in 205 consecutive non-pregnant female patients ≥ 18 years attending an OB/GYN and chronic pain clinic in Karlsruhe, Germany. All patients were examined by the same gynecologist with many years of experience in treating chronic genital pain disorders in women. The cohort consisted of two distinct groups: a group of patients with chronic pelvic pain, and a control group of individuals examined for preventive reasons. Inclusion criteria were admittance for preventive care without medical conditions or complaints, and patients complaining of lower abdominal pain lasting ≥ 6 months. The data evaluation was conducted independently from treatment and did not influence medical procedures. Exclusion criteria Examinations Patients 1 Fig. 1 Patient selection according to the STARD criteria [ 36 Gynecological Examination Physical examination was performed according to standard operation procedures of the clinic involving inspection of vulva, vagina, and uterine cervix with a speculum, swab smear for bedside microbiology and hormonal cell analysis, bimanual palpation of the pelvic organs, and transvaginal ultrasound. All women had a workup to exclude organic or severe mental disease and other causes of CPPS. Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and age were taken from the patient’s records or measured during the first examination. Determining Paracervical Motion Tenderness A cervical motion test was performed during bimanual palpation to determine the paracervical (parauterine) tenderness (parametropathy, PMP), as expressed by the patient on a standardized scale (see Sect. “ Pain Measurement Scale 2 Fig. 2 Bimanual motion test of the paracervical region to examine cervical motion tenderness (parametropathy). The figure demonstrates the motion to the right side of the patient, testing for left side parametropathy (PMP) We want to emphasize that the tenderness level as reported by the patient is not identical to the examiner’s findings of “ligamental tension”. Tenderness is a more valid measure than the estimation of the paracervical tension by the examiner, as shown in investigations of other body areas comparing patients’ expression with the examiner’s findings. For instance, in the examination of neck reflex points (NRPs), palpation findings were not reproducible [ 27 28 30 In the second step, during transvaginal ultrasound examination, sagittal pressure was performed with the vaginal probe at three sites: left paracervical, median (towards the cervix), and right paracervical, see Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Ultrasound probe pressure on the paracervical region to examine adnexal tenderness (parametropathy). The test was performed at three sites: left, right, and posterior vaginal fornix. The figure shows the example of left-side pressure to test for left-side parametropathy (PMP) Pain Measurement Scale Paracervical tenderness upon cervical motion or pressure from a vaginal probe was reported by the patient on a three-level scale with the pain index: absent (pain index, PI = 0), or mild (PI = 1), or remarkable (painful, PI = 2) tenderness. This three-level scale was introduced and evaluated by Brandt [ 31 28 30 and Statistical Analysis All analyses were done using statistical software R version ≥ 4.2.0. (R-Foundation for Statist. Computing, Vienna, Austria). Demographic variables of the patients were described as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables, and as means and standard deviations, or median and range, respectively, for continuous variables. Differences between subgroups were evaluated for categorical variables by chi-squared tests, whereas for continuous variables, t To examine reliability between localizations, hands, or procedures, Cohen’s kappa was used together with corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The diagnostic value of the proposed procedure was evaluated by values of sensitivity and specificity. As a result of the exploratory character of the study, no missing data was imputed, and p p Statement of Ethics Compliance This study was approved by the Heidelberg University Ethics Committee (approval no. S-487/2011 on September 6, 2011). The authors confirm that the study was performed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1964, and its later amendments.

Results Patients In this prospective observational study, 185 patients with their first examination were included in the evaluation; 155 of them visited a doctor for a preventive examination (annual Pap smear), or other preventive reasons such as contraceptive controls, whereas 30 women sought medical advice for chronic pelvic pain (CPP) for ≥ 6 months.

Preventive: Patients without medical conditions or complaints, CPP: Patients with chronic lower abdominal pain of ≥ 6 months Left Side Predominance of Parametropathy In the early 1940s, CPPS was denominated “pelvipathia spastica sinistra” by H. Martius [ 10 2 4 Prevalence of Parametropathy on Vaginal Ultrasound Probe Pressure Testing paracervical tenderness is also possible using the US probe to apply sagittal pressure. This finding is also called “adnexal tenderness” [ 22 32 3 Table 3 Reliability for parametropathy between manual palpation and ultrasound probe pressure Kappa κ bimanual vs. US Right parametrium Center Left parametrium Control group 0.915 (CI 0.843–0.988) 0.944 (CI 0.882–1.006) 0.929 (CI 0.868–0.990) CPP group 0.942 (CI 0.831–1.053) 0.942 (CI 0.829–1.054) 1.000 Bimanual CI CPP US Best Cutoff for Parametropathy in CPPS and Diagnostic Value of the Test We compared the diagnostic value, i.e., the specificity and sensitivity of a positive finding of parametropathy (PMP) in the CPP and the control group. To define the best diagnostic value, sensitivity and specificity were calculated for different cutoffs. A simple way to describe the PMP findings is to count the examination findings with the highest value, independent of which site (left/center/right) the sign was found. This value is unambiguous, because the distinction between the ordinal values 1 and 2 does not play a role in scoring. The results are displayed in Table 4 Table 4 Diagnostic values of different minimum scores in gynecological bimanual, and ultrasound probe pressure examination for cervical tenderness (parametropathy, PMP) Tenderness 1 × 1 2 × 1 3 × 1 1 × 2 2 × 2 3 × 2 Palpation sensitivity 100.0% 93.3% 60.0% 96.7%* 76.7% 13.3% Palpation specificity 76.0% 86.4% 95.2% 92.8%* 96.0% 99.2% US sensitivity 90.0% 86.7% 53.3% 86.7% 63.3% 13.3% US specificity 75.2% 84.8% 96.0% 92.0% 94.4% 99.2% Palpation: manual cervical motion to detect parametropathy. US: ultrasound probe pressure. “≥ 1 × 1” means: at least one site with a pain index (PI) of 1 was found. “3 × 2” means: all six sites were painful with a PI = 2 *The best combination of sensitivity and specificity was achieved using the cutoff “≥ 1 × 2” in bimanual palpation (i.e., at least one paracervical site with a tenderness PI = 2) The best diagnostic value (the combination of highest sensitivity and highest specificity) was found for tenderness of ≥ 1 × 2 on manual palpation, see Fig. 5 4 Fig. 5 Diagnostic value of cervical tenderness found on bimanual palpation. The best diagnostic value (sensitivity 96.7% and specificity 92.8%) is found using the criteria “≥ 1 × 2”, i.e., pain index of 2, marked pain, in at least one of the sites, marked with an asterisk Analysis of False Positive and False Negative Findings For the cutoff “≥ 1 × 2” (i.e., at least one site with PI = 2) which demonstrated the best sensitivity and specificity combination, we found 9/125 false positive cases in the control group and 1/30 false negative case in the CPP group. Why did patients have a positive PMP in the preventive (control) group (Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Sensitivity and specificity of cervical motion tenderness (parametropathy) upon cervical motion test of all three sites. The figure demonstrates the results with a cutoff of “PI ≥ 1 × 2”, i.e., at least one site with a pain index of 2. Pain index range is 0, 1, or 2 Second, what was the nature of the one negative PMP result in a patient of the CPP group (Fig. 6 Discussion Principal Findings: Parametropathy and CPPS CPPS is defined as “chronic pelvic pain in females of more than 6 months without an obvious origin,” i.e., the absence of any other disease. However, this definition is unsatisfactory because it is a diagnosis of exclusion. We therefore aimed to find a positive sign to define the disease. Parametropathy was a good candidate for such a positive sign of CPPS. The term “parametropathy” was first described first by H. Martius in 1942 [ 10 11 13 synonym Clinical Implications Our findings support the role of parametropathy, defined as cervical motion tenderness in the paracervical region, as a potentially valuable clinical sign in the evaluation of CPPS. For potential causes of CPP, such as endometriosis and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS), the standard diagnostic pathways typically require imaging or laparoscopy [ 1 8 35 Results in the Context of What Is Known Until now, the prevalence of this sign in chronic pelvic pain is still not established. In this study we present a prospective data collection of paracervical tenderness in patients with a history of CPP compared to a population of patients without complaints in preventative care examinations. We found a high diagnostic value (sensitivity and specificity) for parametropathy in patients with chronic pelvic pain. Therefore, screening for PMP can become a non-invasive screening tool to estimate the need for further invasive measures, which will allow a more exact definition of CPPS. This is important for the taxonomy and allows one to investigate covariates of the disease, which yields a base to search for better therapy strategies. Differentiating Parametropathy from Other Causes of CPP It is essential to differentiate parametropathy from other overlapping sources of CPP, such as musculoskeletal and urological disorders. Myofascial pelvic pain and pelvic floor dysfunction—present in up to 22% of women with CPP—are often underdiagnosed but respond to specialized physical therapy and trigger point release [ 14 16 5 6 Our study excluded individuals with acute inflammation, atrophy, and malignancy, but not with benign conditions such as ovarian cysts or fibroids. This supports the specificity of paracervical tenderness for CPPS. However, future studies are needed to correlate PMP findings with laparoscopic, musculoskeletal, and urological diagnostics to assess overlap and improve specificity. Tenderness or Tension? The expression of tenderness or pain given by a patient may look like a subjective and uncertain measure. However, the use of a three-level scale in the context of an all-day clinical situation allows for a quick estimation of pain and tenderness. In this context, the three-level scale obviously is superior to a 10-digit scale of pain [ 31 33 29 Manual Palpation or Ultrasound? Exerting pressure with US probe pressure is not available in all cases, because an US examination may not be applicable in all gynecological examinations. However, the good agreement between bimanual palpation and US probe findings underlines the clinical meaning of bimanual palpation results, so that an extra probe pressure test by US is not necessary for the diagnosis of CPPS. Left Side Predominance of Parametropathy In his first description of CPP, H. Martius reported on a left side predominance of cervical tenderness [ 10 parametropathia spastica sinistra 11 13 2 Calculating the Diagnostic Value of Parametropathy for CPP Examination To establish a good screening test, it is important to also avoid under- and overdiagnosis. Screening for “the tenderness cutoff “≥ 1 × 2” resulted in a low rate of false positive findings of only 7–8% in healthy women, e.g., in preventive care examinations. At the same time, only approximately 3% of women with CPP will be overseen (high sensitivity). The use of cutoffs higher than “≥ 1 × 2” misses 29–90% of women with CPP, while lower cutoffs, such as “≥ 1 × 1”, declare up to 60% of a healthy population as having CPPS, i.e., as false positives. Using the “≥ 1 × 2” cutoff offers the combination of highest specificity and highest sensitivity. With this cutoff, most of the false positive results in the control group could be explained by underlying causes not identified until now, such as genital atrophy in climax praecox, or a history of recurrent pain episodes. Clinical Implications Possible Neurophysiological Mechanisms to Explain the Symptoms The high prevalence of paracervical tissue changes in women suffering from long-standing lower abdominal pain raises the question of a possible common cause. There is increasing evidence for peripheral nerve sensitization in patients with CPP [ 34 34 Diagnostic Value of Parametropathy This straightforward test, which assesses three potential tender sites using a simple three-level scale (“no tenderness,” “mild tenderness,” and “painful,” scored as 0, 1, and 2, respectively), requires only an additional minute of examination time without adding any further costs, and provides valuable and comprehensive information on chronic pelvic pain. Using PMP examination in patients with CPPS also allows short-term and long-term therapy control of any measures performed in these patients. We suggest using the term “parametropathy” (PMP) for this specific sign of cervical tenderness in CPPS in the future. We did not exclude patients with ovarian cysts and fibroids. These benign tumors did not seem to induce CPPS. In none of the cases (all > 25 ml volume) was paracervical tenderness found. Thus, the diagnostic value of the PMP testing is not impaired by these pathologies causing anatomical changes. Do analgesic drugs influence the rate of negative PMP results in the control group? The use of analgesics in the control group is significantly lower than in the CPP group (5% vs. 23%), which argues against the potential concealing effect of analgesics on paracervical pathology. With the PMP test performed by bimanual palpation using the cutoff described here, only approximately 3% of the CPP cases will be overlooked (false negative), and only 7–8% in an asymptomatic female population will be false positively described as CPPS using the three criteria displayed in Fig. 7 Fig. 7 The Heidelberg Diagnostic Criteria of Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome. Parametropathy is defined as cervical motion tenderness upon bimanual gynecological examination at three sites (left, center, and right parametrium), on a scale of 0 (no tenderness), 1 (slight tenderness), and 2 (tenderness, pain) Consequently, diagnosis of CPPS will become more secure, confounders can be better defined, and new therapy strategies addressing the paracervical pathology can be developed. We therefore suggest including the examination of paracervical tenderness as part of every gynecological examination, in preventive care, as well as in CPP and endometriosis workup. Research Implications Further research is needed to evaluate the interobserver reliability (reproducibility) of the PMP test. Additionally, its reproducibility in cases of acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) has not yet been established. This clinical test could serve as a basis for refining the diagnostic criteria for PID. In the context of CPPS, this simple screening tool provides a more precise indication for further diagnostic measures, including invasive procedures such as laparoscopy. Investigating these cases would help correlate PMP findings with intra-abdominal pathology. Further studies based on this novel clinical sign including potential confounders have the potential to refine the currently ambiguous definition of CPPS, identify associated covariates, and pave the way for new neurophysiological-based therapeutic strategies for women suffering from this severe and debilitating condition. Limitations and Strengths Monocenter and single-examiner design Exclusion bias of genital atrophy Exclusion bias of patients with hysterectomy No correlates with invasive diagnostic findings Hidden rate of endometriosis 35 The simple, non-invasive PMP test described in this study may help identify patients who require further evaluation for endometriosis. A positive PMP result could serve as a justification for additional diagnostic measures, including invasive procedures such as a porphyria workup or laparoscopy. Implementing this approach may enhance the detection of affected patients in both groups, leading to more timely and accurate diagnoses. Strengths of the study By recognizing parametropathy as a distinct clinical sign, clinicians may be empowered to diagnose CPPS with greater confidence, triage patients more effectively, and tailor therapies on the basis of neurophysiological or structural contributors to pain [ 34 Conclusion We found a high correlation between paracervical tenderness and CPPS. We conclude that this clinical sign is a good candidate for a positive diagnosis of CPPS. We suggest introducing the term “parametropathy” for paracervical tenderness not as a diagnosis but as a sensitive and specific sign of CPPS. Clinical application: We suggest including the paracervical tenderness examination in every gynecological examination, in a screening situation, as well as in a CPP workup. CPPS will then no longer be a diagnosis of exclusion. Axel Gerhardt and Manuel Feisst contributed equally to the publication.
