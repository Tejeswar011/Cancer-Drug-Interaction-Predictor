(A) (B) (C) Article highlights The study emphasizes the successful use of exosome encapsulation to enhance the delivery of temozolomide (TMZ) and quercetin (Qct) across the blood–brain barrier (BBB), improving drug stability for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) therapy. Encapsulating TMZ and Qct within exosomes (TMZ-Qct-Exo) showed significantly greater potential in reducing GBM cell viability compared with their unencapsulated counterparts, suggesting an effective approach against TMZ resistance. The introduction of folic acid-conjugated exosomes (TMZ-Qct-Exo-FA) enhanced the targeting of GBM cells, leading to better cellular uptake and improved therapeutic outcomes marked by greater apoptosis and increased caspase-3 levels. The combined treatment effectively inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, vital for tumor growth and survival, thereby boosting the anti-tumor effects of the TMZ-Qct-Exo-FA treatment. In vivo The findings highlight that exosome-mediated drug delivery could serve as a promising strategy to circumvent resistance mechanisms commonly associated with TMZ in GBM treatment. The research indicates that combining exosome technology with conventional chemotherapy could pave the way for new therapeutic modalities in the treatment of aggressive brain tumors like GBM. The use of folic acid as a targeting moiety suggests an innovative approach to enhance specificity in drug delivery systems directed at tumor cells. These results underscore the need for further clinical studies to explore the full potential of exosome-mediated delivery systems in enhancing the effectiveness of existing cancer therapies.
