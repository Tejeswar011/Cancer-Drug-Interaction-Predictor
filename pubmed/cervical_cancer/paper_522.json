AIM To evaluate the cardiorenal protective potential of crude ethanol extract (CEE) of green cardamom ( Elettaria cardamomum METHODS Rats were fed a high-fat diet to induce dyslipidemia and subsequently administered cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg) to induce CRS. CEE was administered orally to CRS rats at low (100 mg/kg) and high (200 mg/kg) doses for one month. Oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, cardiovascular disease markers, cardiac indices, and renal function (in plasma and urine) were assessed. The antioxidant activity and phenolic compound profile of CEE were evaluated. Additionally, the potential interactions of CEE phenolics with components of the Hippo signaling pathway (mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1, large tumor suppressor kinase 1, Yes-associated protein, and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) were investigated using molecular docking. RESULTS Cisplatin administration combined with a high-fat diet effectively induced CRS, as evidenced by elevated oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired cardiorenal parameters. Treatment with CEE at both doses improved these parameters, with the high dose demonstrating greater efficacy. CEE exhibited significant DPPH radical scavenging activity. Rosmarinic acid and gallic acid were identified as the major phenolic constituents. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities of rosmarinic acid and rutin with targets in the Hippo signaling pathway. CONCLUSION These findings demonstrate the cardioprotective and renoprotective potential of CEE as a phenolic-rich dietary supplement. CEE mitigated inflammation and oxidative stress, key contributors to CRS pathogenesis. Furthermore, molecular docking suggests that the phenolic compounds in CEE may exert protective effects by modulating the Hippo signaling pathway. Overall, CEE shows promise as a natural therapeutic agent for the prevention and/or management of cardiorenal syndrome.

The global burden of these metabolic disorders is expected to continue rising, with projections indicating that by 2050 they will contribute to the highest number of deaths worldwide[ 1 2 The Western diet, often used as a model of an unbalanced diet, plays a central role in elevating the incidence of these diseases by promoting chronic inflammation and oxidative stress[ 3 4 5 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death globally and often coexists with metabolic disorders such as diabetes and kidney disease[ 4 6 7 8 Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent for several cancers, including lung, bladder, and cervical cancers. However, its clinical application is limited by its significant toxicity to normal tissues, particularly the kidneys[ 9 6 10 The American Heart Association defines the coexistence of cardiovascular and kidney disease as cardiorenal syndrome (CRS), which is classified into stages ranging from 0 to 4, based on severity and progression[ 11 1 12 Incorporating dietary supplements or functional foods into daily nutrition may aid in preventing or managing diet-related chronic diseases and their associated complications, due to the presence of bioactive compounds such as phenolic compounds. These compounds exert various biological effects, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antidiabetic, nephroprotective (including reduction of kidney stone formation and protection against nephrotoxicity), and cardioprotective activities[ 1 7 8 Herbs and spices, which are inherently linked to human diets, have been extensively studied for their health benefits. Spices have a long history in traditional medicine due to their rich content of bioactive constituents[ 13 Elettaria cardamomum 14 15 Cardamom contains a variety of compounds, including essential oils, terpenes ( e.g. e.g. e.g. 16 17 Recent studies have identified the Hippo signaling pathway as a promising therapeutic target for treating cardiac and renal diseases[ 18 19 19 19 Most animal studies focus on single models of diet-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes, CVD, or kidney injury in isolation. In contrast, the present study aims to establish a rat model that combines two diet-related chronic conditions within the same animal. This was achieved by feeding rats a high-fat diet to induce dyslipidemia and cardiovascular complications, followed by intraperitoneal administration of cisplatin to induce kidney injury, ultimately leading to the development of CRS. This study investigates the protective potential of crude ethanol extract (CEE) of cardamom in this CRS model. The antioxidant activity and phenolic compound profile of CEE were evaluated. Furthermore, molecular docking was employed to assess the interactions between CEE phenolic compounds and components of the Hippo signaling pathway (MST1, LATS1, YAP, and TAZ). MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant materials Green cardamom pods ( Elettaria cardamomum Animals Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 156 and 180 g were used in this study. The animals were obtained from the animal facility at the National Research Centre (NRC), Cairo, Egypt. Each rat was housed individually in a stainless-steel metabolic cage, with ad libitum Preparation of cardamom ethanol extract Dried cardamom powder was subjected to ultrasound-assisted extraction using ethanol as a green solvent. The resulting extract was concentrated by evaporating the solvent under reduced pressure at a temperature not exceeding 40 °C. The concentrated extract was stored in a deep freezer until use. For oral administration to rats, the ethanol extract was dissolved in water. Phytochemical screening and antioxidant activity of cardamom extract Total phenolic content in the CEE was determined using the Folin–Ciocalteu method[ 20 et al 7 et al 21 Diets Two dietary regimens were administered during the study. Rats in the cardiorenal syndrome model group were fed a high-fat diet based on the formulation by Mohamed et al 22 23 Induction of cardiorenal syndrome in rats The study included four groups of six rats each. Groups 1 and 2 served as the normal control (fed a balanced diet) and the cardiorenal syndrome control (fed a high-fat diet), respectively. Groups 3 and 4 were fed a high-fat diet and received daily oral doses of cardamom extract at 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg body weight, respectively. On day 25, all groups except the normal control received a single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (Mayne Pharmaceuticals, Warwickshire, United Kingdom) at 7.5 mg/kg body weight[ 24 Five days after cisplatin administration, 24-hour urine samples were collected for the measurement of creatinine, urea, and total protein. Creatinine clearance was calculated as follows: Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = [Urine creatinine (mg/dL) × 24-hour urine volume (mL)]/[Plasma creatinine (mg/dL) × 1440]. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected from all rats after overnight fasting in heparinized tubes for the evaluation of plasma lipid profile parameters, including triglycerides, total cholesterol (T-Ch), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-Ch), using colorimetric kits. Oxidized LDL levels were measured using an ELISA kit (Catalogue #SL0554Ra, Sunlong ® Plasma levels of cardiac markers lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)[ 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 ® This study was conducted under internal project No. 13050203 and approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the NRC (Approval No. 13050203), in accordance with NIH guidelines. Molecular docking of cardamom ethanol extract The structures of MST1, LATS1, YAP, and TAZ were retrieved from the UniProt database. Protein preparation was performed using AutoDock Tools 1.5.7, which included the addition of hydrogen atoms, removal of water molecules, and assignment of partial charges. The major phytochemicals identified in the cardamom ethanol extract were obtained from the PubChem database and subjected to energy minimization using Avogadro (version 1.2.0) with the MMFF94 force field. Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock Vina, and docking interactions were visualized using BIOVIA Discovery Studio, version 2020[ 7 Statistical analysis Data is expressed as mean ± SE. Statistical comparisons between groups were made using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Duncan’s post hoc test. The value of P RESULTS Bioactive compounds and antioxidant potential of cardamom extract The total phenolic content in the cardamom ethanol extract (CEE) was 50.94 ± 0.754 mg GAE/g. Antioxidant activity, measured by the DPPH assay, was 26.55 ± 0.438 mg TE/g. HPLC analysis identified 16 phenolic compounds in the extract (Table 1 Table 1 HPLC of cardamom crude ethanol extract phenolic compounds profile (µg/g)  Phenolic compounds  Conc. µg/g Gallic acid 207.79 Chlorogenic acid 120.01 Methyl gallate 59.79 Caffeic acid 191.36 Syringic acid 190.25 Rutin 125.14 Ellagic acid 12.13 Coumaric acid 190.42 Vanillin 58.03 Ferulic acid 65.67 Naringenin 71.84 Rosmarinic acid 655.69 Quercetin 76.86 Cinnamic acid 75.27 Hesperetin 71.57 Effect of cardamom extract on dyslipidemia and cardiac enzymes Rats in the CRS control group—fed a high-fat diet and injected intraperitoneally with cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg BW)—exhibited significantly elevated levels of total cholesterol (162.29 ± 2.54), triglycerides (109.00 ± 2.02), LDL-C (97.00 ± 2.88), and oxidized-LDL (59.91 ± 2.20), along with a marked reduction in HDL-C (25.43 ± 0.37) (Table 2 1 2 Figure 1  Coronary risk and cardioprotective index of different experimental groups. n Figure 2  Creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase as heart function indices in all experimental groups. n Table 2 Effect of cardamom extract on plasma lipid profile  Parameters  Normal control  Cardiorenal control  Low-dose cardamom extract  High-dose cardamom extract T-Ch (mg/dL) 68.70 a 162.29 b 113.14 b , d 83.29 a , d , f TG (mg/dL) 77.43 a 109.00 b 92.57 b , d 82.86 d , e HDL-Ch (mg/dL) 42.86 a 25.43 b 36.14 b , d 41.71 b , d , f LDL-Ch (mg/dL) 20.29 a 97.00 b 58.00 b , d 40.71 b , d , f Oxidized LDL (pg/mL) 24.68 a 59.91 b 36.28 b , c 30.67 a , d , e a  P b  P vs c  P d  P P vs e  P f  P P vs n Oral administration of cardamom extract at both low (100 mg/kg BW) and high (200 mg/kg BW) doses resulted in dose-dependent improvements in lipid profiles, CRI, CPI, and cardiac enzyme levels. The high dose showed greater efficacy. Effect on renal function parameters CRS control rats demonstrated significant increases in plasma creatinine, urea, BUN, and BUN/creatinine ratio, along with significant reductions in plasma total protein and albumin levels (Table 3 Table 3 Effect of cardamom extract on renal biochemical parameter in plasma and urine of rats   Normal control  Cardiorenal control  Low-dose cardamom extract  High-dose cardamom extract Plasma Creatinine (mg/dL) 0.59 a 1.44 b 0.98 b , d 0.77 a , d , f Urea (mg/dL) 32.92 a 159.22 b 89.79 b , d 64.51 b , d , f Albumin (g/dL) 3.91 a 2.53 b 3.03 b , d 3.70 d , f BUN (mg/dL) 15.38 a 74.36 b 41.93 c 30.13 d BUN/creatinine ratio 26.17 a 52.13 b 43.00 b , d 39.15 b , d , f Total protein (g/dL) 7.73 a 5.31 b 6.30 b , d 7.19 a , d , f Urine Creatinine (mg/dL) 37.78 a 52.71 b 46.14 b , c 40.71 d , e Urea (mg/dL) 657.77 a 984.63 b 823.57 b , d 697.86 a , d , f Protein (mg/dL) 41.94 a 67.29 b 62.57 b , d 50.00 b , d , f Creatinine clerance (ml/min) 1.24 a 0.48 b 0.75 b , d 0.97 b , d , f a  P b  P vs c  P d  P P vs e  P f  P P vs n Treatment with cardamom extract significantly improved these renal function markers in both plasma and urine. These findings suggest that cardamom extract may mitigate cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Effect on oxidative stress and inflammation Markers of oxidative stress, including MDA, were significantly elevated in plasma and tissues (heart and kidneys) of the CRS control group, while catalase activity was significantly reduced (Figure 3 4 Figure 3  Effect of cardamom extract administration on malondialdehyde and catalase in plasma, heart, and kidney tissues. n Figure 4  Effect of cardamom extract administration on plasma inflammatory markers in different groups. n Administration of cardamom extract at both doses significantly attenuated oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in a dose-dependent manner.

Molecular docking: Hippo signaling pathway The molecular docking study examined interactions between phenolic compounds in cardamom extract and four proteins of the Hippo signaling pathway: MST1, LATS1, YAP, and TAZ.

Rutin exhibited the strongest binding to LATS1, YAP, and TAZ, while both rutin and ellagic acid showed the highest affinities for MST1. Moderate binding was observed for quercetin, naringenin, and rosmarinic acid; syringic acid and vanillin showed the weakest interactions. 3D and 2D interaction maps for rutin (highest binding affinity) and rosmarinic acid (most abundant compound) are presented in Figures 5 6 7 8 Figure 5  3D and 2D interactions between each compound with large tumor suppressor kinase 1.

DISCUSSION Unhealthy dietary patterns, such as the Western diet, combined with a sedentary lifestyle, are major contributors to the global burden of cardiovascular and kidney diseases[ 1 33 11 CRS encompasses a complex, reciprocal interaction between cardiac and renal dysfunction, manifesting in both acute and chronic forms[ 34 High caloric intake from the high-fat diet contributed to dysregulated lipid metabolism, as evidenced by altered lipid profiles. Similar findings have been reported by Rodríguez-Correa et al 35 et al 36 36 37 38 40 Inflammatory biomarkers—CRP, TNF-α, and IL-6—were also markedly elevated, underscoring their central role in the pathophysiology of CRS[ 33 41 42 43 Cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, a known model for acute kidney injury, was corroborated by the observed increases in plasma urea, creatinine, urinary protein levels, and reductions in total protein, albumin, and creatinine clearance—strong indicators of glomerular damage[ 37 44 45 10 46 Oral administration of CEE at both low and high doses significantly improved all CRS-associated biochemical markers. The extract ameliorated dyslipidemia, normalized cardiac enzyme levels, improved both coronary risk and cardioprotective indices, and restored kidney function markers in both plasma and urine. Moreover, CEE effectively reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators, indicating strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The in vitro in vivo 1 7 8 47 Phenolic compounds mitigate oxidative stress by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thus preventing LDL oxidation, atherosclerosis, and subsequent vascular damage. Oxidative stress also drives DNA damage, a common factor in chronic kidney and cardiovascular diseases[ 48 43 49 49 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 The molecular docking component of this study further explored potential mechanistic pathways by evaluating the interaction of CEE-derived phenolic compounds with the Hippo signaling pathway—a regulatory cascade involved in organ development, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and fibrosis[ 18 19 59 60 61 19 62 Molecular docking results indicated strong binding affinities between rosmarinic acid and rutin with all four Hippo pathway proteins. These interactions suggest that CEE may exert its therapeutic effects, at least in part, via 62 Limitations of the study This study has some limitations. First, the molecular docking findings, while informative, are predictive in nature and do not confirm in vivo CONCLUSION The results of this study provide compelling evidence for the cardioprotective and reno-protective effects of CEE as a natural dietary supplement rich in phenolic compounds. CEE effectively mitigated inflammation and oxidative stress—key drivers of cardiorenal syndrome—and improved lipid and kidney function profiles in a rat CRS model. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis suggests that the extract’s bioactive compounds may exert protective effects through modulation of the Hippo signaling pathway. These findings highlight the potential of CEE as a promising natural therapeutic candidate for the prevention or management of cardiorenal syndrome.
