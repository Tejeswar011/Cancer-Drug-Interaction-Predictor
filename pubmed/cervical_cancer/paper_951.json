The World Health Organization reports that cervical cancer accounts for over 300,000 deaths each year among women. The primary cause of cervical cancer is infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly high-risk types such as HPV-16 and HPV-18, which play a significant role in its development ( 1 2 3 This case report details the clinical journey of a 55-year-old postmenopausal woman who experienced vaginal bleeding after sexual intercourse and was eventually diagnosed with stage IIB cervical squamous cell carcinoma. This case is particularly noteworthy due to the occurrence of isolated splenic metastasis following standard treatment, a relatively rare event in cervical cancer cases. The report emphasizes the importance of a thorough differential diagnostic approach in clinical practice and highlights the need for careful monitoring and management of potential metastases during treatment. By analyzing this case, we aim to provide a reference for diagnosing and managing similar clinical situations in the future and to enhance the understanding of the metastatic pathways associated with cervical cancer. Case presentation On June 20, 2022, a 55-year-old postmenopausal woman experienced vaginal bleeding after intercourse. The bleeding was light and appeared as bright red spotting. It persisted for 2 months. The patient reported no vaginal discharge, anal fullness, lower abdominal pain, or lumbosacral discomfort. There were no symptoms of dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, urgency, or constipation. No swelling or pain was observed in the lower limbs. Additionally, the patient had no chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis. The patient also reported no fatigue or weight loss. No family history of tumors was noted. During her initial gynecological examination, the external genitalia appeared normal, and the vagina was patent. However, the cervix showed nodularity, measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter. The left parametrium was noted to be shortened and thickened, while the right side exhibited good elasticity. The uterus was anteverted and of normal size, with no masses palpated in the adnexa. A cervical biopsy confirmed the presence of moderately differentiated HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma located at the 6 and 12 o’clock positions, along with a diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL; Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN) III) within the cervical canal. The immunohistochemical analysis showed P40(+), P53(+,10%), P16(+), Her-2(−), Ki-67(+,60%), and CK5/6(+). Based on the gynecological examination and cervical biopsy results, the preliminary diagnosis was cervical squamous cell carcinoma stage IIB (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) 2018). The pathology was clear, and no differential diagnosis was needed. Subsequent pelvic enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a soft tissue mass in the cervix measuring approximately 4.1 × 3.4 × 5.0 cm, with unclear parametric spaces, suggesting that it involved the vaginal fornix and extended into the uterine body. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan indicated cervical thickening with increased metabolic activity, recording a maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) of 12.6 and measuring approximately 3.5 × 3.0 × 4.4 cm, affecting the lower segment of the uterine body. Tumor biomarkers were elevated, with cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) at 22.80 U/mL (reference range, 0–16.0 U/mL), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) at 41.46 U/mL (reference range, 0–34.0 U/mL), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) at 4.60 ng/mL (reference range, 0–1.50 ng/mL), and cytokeratin 19 fragment at 5.92 ng/mL (reference range, 0–2.08 ng/mL). On July 1, 2022, the patient underwent robotic-assisted surgery, which involved dissecting the para-aortic lymph nodes, releasing intestinal adhesions, and marking lymph nodes. Postoperative pathology confirmed that there was no cancer metastasis in the para-aortic lymph nodes, with all seven sampled nodes showing no signs of cancer. From July 12 to August 25, 2022, the patient received fixed-field intensity-modulated radiotherapy, totaling 50.4 Gy delivered in 28 fractions of 1.8 Gy each. This treatment targeted the uterus, cervix, bilateral adnexa, bilateral parametrium, part of the vagina, and surrounding pelvic lymphatic drainage areas. Alongside this, the patient was administered five weekly doses of cisplatin on July 13, July 20, July 27, August 4, and August 28, 2022, with each dose being 40 mg/m². Additionally, the patient completed six sessions of painless three-dimensional brachytherapy on August 5, August 12, August 19, August 26, September 2, and September 7, 2022, with each session delivering 5.5 Gy using one tube with two spheres. As a result, the total cumulative dose from both external irradiation and brachytherapy reached 93.2 Gy. After treatment, no vaginal bleeding recurred in the patient. The primary side effects experienced during the chemoradiotherapy included nausea, vomiting, and grade III bone marrow suppression; however, these symptoms improved with symptomatic treatment. A follow-up MRI conducted on September 20, 2022, revealed a mass-like soft tissue signal in the cervix, primarily located on the posterior wall, with dimensions of approximately 2.3 × 2.0 × 2.5 cm. The results from the cervical ThinPrep Cytology Test (TCT) showed no intraepithelial lesions or malignant cells, categorizing the findings as negative for intraepithelial lesions or malignancy (NILM). Additionally, testing for HPV type 16 returned positive, and the SCC level was noted to be elevated at 1.90 ng/mL. A cervical biopsy revealed inflammatory necrotic tissue alongside chronic inflammation of the mucosal lining. These findings led to an assessment of the therapeutic response as partial remission (PR). The patient is currently undergoing regular follow-up examinations, which have shown no signs of disease progression or recurrence.

The cyotokeratin 19 fragment starts at 2.16 ng/mL, peaks at 12.47 ng/mL in May 2024, and drops to 2.1 ng/mL. The squamous cell carcinoma antigen starts at 0.7 ng/mL, peaks at 2.5 ng/mL in May 2024, then decreases to 0.6 ng/mL. Figure 2 Changes in splenic lesions on MRI during the follow-up period.

Panel B, C, and D have red arrows highlighting specific areas on the scans, which are of different orientations or contrasts. Panel A shows a standard view without annotations. In May 2024, the patient reported intermittent dull pain in the left upper abdomen. The pain worsened during inhalation and persisted for 1 month. The pain was non-referred. Initially rated as 4 on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the patient received oral lofentanil sustained-release tablets (2 tablets every 12 hours) for management. After treatment, the pain score had decreased to 1. Upon physical examination, the abdomen was found to be soft, with no tenderness, muscle rigidity, or rebound tenderness, and the spleen was not palpable. An MRI conducted on May 6, 2024, revealed that an isolated signal lesion in the spleen had increased in size to 4.6 × 4.0 cm, characterized by multiple septations and enhancement, which raised concerns about potential metastasis (  Figure 2D  Figure 3 Figure 3 The PET/CT images acquired in May 2024. A patchy hypodense lesion was observed within the spleen, with ill-defined borders and a size measuring approximately 4.4 × 3.5 cm. The periphery of the lesion exhibits annularly elevated metabolic activity, with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of approximately 10.0. PET and CT scan images display various views of the abdominal area, with highlighted areas circled in red. The top row shows PET scans with SUV measurements, and the bottom row shows corresponding CT and fused PET/CT images. The red circles likely indicate areas of interest or abnormality. A multidisciplinary team of specialists recommended a splenectomy followed by postoperative anti-tumor therapies for the patient. On May 17, 2024, the patient underwent a laparoscopic total splenectomy. During the procedure, an enlarged spleen was observed, measuring 10.0 × 8.0 × 4.0 cm. The cut surface of the spleen revealed a grayish-white mass approximately 5.0 × 4.5 × 4.0 cm, which had a moderate consistency and exhibited necrotic areas. This mass was well-demarcated from the surrounding tissues and was located approximately 1.5 cm from the splenic hilum, close to the capsule. Post-surgical pathological analysis of both the spleen and tumor specimens confirmed the presence of metastatic cancer, with morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics consistent with squamous cell carcinoma metastasis, and clear margins were observed (  Figure 4 NCOR1 PIK3CA U2AF1 PLXNA1 Figure 4 Pathological features following splenectomy.

The patient refused immunotherapy. The patient subsequently received a treatment regimen consisting of paclitaxel (145 mg/m 2  Figure 5 Figure 5 Timeline diagram of patient diagnosis and treatment. This figure illustrates the process of the patient from initial treatment to recurrence and post-recurrence treatment, including time, diagnosis, important examination and test results, treatment plan, and evaluation of treatment outcomes. Timeline detailing cancer diagnosis and treatment for a 55-year-old woman from June 2022 to August 2024. Key events include the initial diagnosis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma, various therapies such as para-aortic lymphadenectomy and radiotherapy with cisplatin, assessments indicating partial remission, and the discovery of a splenic lesion diagnosed as metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. Treatments included splenectomy, genetic testing, and chemotherapy. As of August 2024, the disease condition is stable. Discussion Interestingly, the spleen is an unusual site for metastasis from cervical cancer, with only a few cases reported in the literature ( 4 Research has shown that cervical cancer typically spreads through lymphatic and blood routes. The lymphatic spread mainly affects the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes, while hematogenous metastasis usually occurs in the later stages of the disease. Studies have also revealed that cervical cancer cells can enter the bloodstream, resulting in metastasis to various organs, including the lungs, liver, and bones ( 5 Primary splenic tumors are extremely rare, and isolated splenic metastases from solid tumors are found in approximately 1% of autopsy cases ( 6 Recent studies have indicated that the spleen, a key part of the immune system, may have a complex role in tumor metastasis. Several factors could contribute to this process: first, the unique structure of splenic blood sinuses can trap tumor cells, allowing cervical cancer cells in the bloodstream to enhance their retention and growth in the spleen through interactions with vascular endothelial cells ( 5 7 8 The occurrence of splenic metastasis in patients with cervical cancer is relatively rare, with the first documented case reported by Brufman et al. in 1977 ( 9  Table 1 4 6 8 30 1 20 Table 1 A literature review on cases of cervical cancer with splenic metastasis.

According to literature reports, the median survival time for patients with splenic oligometastasis from cervical cancer ranges from 5 to 30 months (15.86 ± 7.95 months) ( 23 4 8 4 31 Common imaging techniques used in this context include ultrasound, CT, and MRI ( 5 32 4 5 8 4 4 8 Individuals with splenic metastasis from cervical cancer often show non-specific changes in blood tests, such as anemia, low white blood cell counts, and reduced platelet counts, which suggest impaired splenic function ( 5 33 4 33 2 4 34 35 The most reliable method to diagnose spleen metastasis is organ biopsy. In cervical cancer, spleen metastasis is closely associated with the aggressive behavior of tumor cells. In recent years, genetic testing and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) analysis have garnered significant attention in metastatic cervical cancer research. Studies have indicated that patients with spleen metastasis exhibit significantly elevated PD-L1 expression levels. This elevation may result from tumor cells suppressing T-cell activity to evade immune surveillance ( 4 Genetic evaluations have identified four clinically significant mutations: NCOR1 PIK3CA U2AF1 PLXNA1 NCOR1 NCOR1 36 PIK3CA 34 37 38 PIK3CA U2AF1 39 40 PLXNA1 41 Cervical cancer management requires a collaborative approach that brings together a multidisciplinary team, particularly in cases where splenic metastasis is present. This multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) framework leverages the expertise of professionals from various fields, such as gynecological oncology, radiation oncology, medical oncology, imaging, and pathology, to create tailored therapeutic strategies for each patient. Research has indicated that this coordinated effort significantly improves treatment effectiveness and increases survival rates for those affected by the disease ( 42 Oligometastatic cervical cancer is defined by the presence of a limited number of metastatic lesions, typically no more than five. Importantly, there should be no local–regional recurrence, meaning that the tumor does not involve the uterus, cervix, upper third of the vagina, or pelvic wall ( 43 44 Although splenic metastasis from cervical cancer is rare, surgical resection may offer a potentially curative option if the patient’s health is stable and the tumor is limited to the spleen, as supported by a documented case ( 44 4 8 In recent years, the exploration of tumor biomarkers has greatly advanced the field of targeted therapies. Targeted agents, such as anti- VEGF 45 47 48 Conclusion This case highlights the complex pathological mechanisms and treatment responses seen in patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma, underscoring the vital role of early detection and monitoring of tumor metastasis in clinical practice. Recent advancements in medical technologies, especially in imaging and biomarker identification, have opened new avenues for the early detection and evaluation of splenic metastasis in cervical cancer. Future research should focus on several important areas: first, clarifying the mechanisms behind splenic metastasis and exploring how tumor cells survive and proliferate within the spleen. Second, a deeper analysis is needed to understand how the splenic microenvironment influences the behavior of cervical cancer cells, particularly in terms of immune evasion and their ability to metastasize. Furthermore, clinical trials should aim to enhance follow-up care for patients with splenic metastasis by evaluating the effectiveness of different treatment regimens in prolonging survival. These efforts will equip clinicians with more practical treatment guidelines for managing cervical cancer patients facing splenic metastasis. Therefore, the study of splenic metastasis remains a crucial area for ongoing investigation. In summary, the exploration of splenic metastasis in cervical cancer offers important theoretical insights and practical implications for clinical practice. This research encourages the merging of clinical applications with foundational studies through collaborative efforts across various disciplines. Future research should focus on identifying prognostic indicators and biomarkers linked to splenic metastasis in cervical cancer, with the goal of developing more accurate predictive tools for clinical application.
