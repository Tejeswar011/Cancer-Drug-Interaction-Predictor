However, one such cancer, oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), has increased in recent years due to a second etiological cause of OPC that is increasing worldwide—oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Both oral HPV prevalence and HPV-associated OPC incidence is higher among men than women 1 2 3 4 Unlike other HPV-associated cancers there is no reliably detected precursor lesion for HPV-associated OPC, thus inhibiting prevention via screening. However, it is known that 90% of HPV-associated OPC is caused by HPV type 16 and that persistence of HPV infection of an oncogenic type (types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) is the obligate precursor to HPV-associated OPC 5 6 7 8 9 6 7 Results Oral oncogenic HPV infection clearance There were 589 men identified as having a prevalent (HPV detected at the first study visit) or incident (HPV acquired during the follow-up period) oral HPV infection in The HIM Study (112 men with multiple infections detected) with a median follow-up time of 44.8 months. Among those men, there were 739 oncogenic oral HPV infections (HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68) of which 533 were incident and 206 were prevalent. Among the incident oncogenic infections, 78% were transient and 6.6% persisted more than 24 months. In contrast, 47.1% of prevalent oncogenic infections were transient and 24.3% persisted more than 24 months. When considering HPV16 alone, 14.1% and 21.6% of incident and prevalent infections, respectively, persisted more than 24 months (Table 1 Table 1 Persistence of incident and prevalent oral oncogenic HPV infections a Overall Transient b 6 months c 12 months c 18 months c 24 months c >24 months c Any HPV Incident 1205 923 (76.6%) 66 (5.5%) 58 (4.8%) 37 (3.1%) 19 (1.6%) 102 (8.5%) Prevalent 663 286 (43.1%) 52 (7.8%) 65 (9.8%) 26 (3.9%) 27 (4.1%) 207 (31.2%) Oncogenic Incident 533 416 (78.0%) 30 (5.6%) 27 (5.1%) 19 (3.6%) 6 (1.1%) 35 (6.6%) Prevalent 206 97 (47.1%) 22 (10.7%) 21 (10.2%) 10 (4.9%) 6 (2.9%) 50 (24.3%) 16 Incident 99 73 (73.7%) 3 (3.0%) 6 (6.1%) 2 (2.0%) 1 (1.0%) 14 (14.1%) Prevalent 51 26 (51.0%) 4 (7.8%) 5 (9.8%) 3 (5.9%) 2 (3.9%) 11 (21.6%) 18 Incident 38 31 (81.6%) 1 (2.6%) 1 (2.6%) 3 (7.9%) 1 (2.6%) 1 (2.6%) Prevalent 14 10 (71.4%) 0 0 0 0 4 (28.6%) 31 Incident 29 23 (79.3%) 2 (6.9%) 2 (6.9%) 1 (3.4%) 0 1 (3.4%) Prevalent 10 6 (60.0%) 0 1 (10.0%) 0 0 3 (30.0%) 33 Incident 13 11 (84.6%) 1 (7.7%) 1 (7.7%) 0 0 0 Prevalent 5 1 (20.0%) 2 (40.0%) 0 0 0 2 (40.0%) 35 Incident 30 17 (56.7%) 4 (13.3%) 3 (10.0%) 1 (3.3%) 0 5 (16.7%) Prevalent 8 3 (37.5%) 1 (12.5%) 2 (25.0%) 1 (12.5%) 0 1 (12.5%) 39 Incident 24 16 (66.7%) 4 (16.7%) 1 (4.2%) 0 0 3 (12.5%) Prevalent 22 6 (27.3%) 2 (9.1%) 4 (18.2%) 1 (4.5%) 1 (4.5%) 8 (36.4%) 45 Incident 16 12 (75.0%) 0 1 (6.3%) 1 (6.3%) 1 (6.3%) 1 (6.3%) Prevalent 8 2 (25.0%) 3 (37.5%) 2 (25.0%) 0 0 1 (12.5%) 51 Incident 58 44 (75.9%) 2 (3.4%) 4 (6.9%) 4 (6.9%) 1 (1.7%) 3 (5.2%) Prevalent 32 14 (43.8%) 4 (12.5%) 4 (12.5%) 1 (3.1%) 1 (3.1%) 8 (25.0%) 52 Incident 136 124 (91.2%) 6 (4.4%) 2 (1.5%) 1 (0.7%) 0 3 (2.2%) Prevalent 23 14 (60.9%) 2 (8.7%) 2 (8.7%) 1 (4.3%) 1 (4.3%) 3 (13.0%) 56 Incident 39 28 (71.8%) 2 (5.1%) 4 (10.3%) 3 (7.7%) 1 (2.6%) 1 (2.6%) Prevalent 17 7 (41.2%) 3 (17.6%) 0 1 (5.9%) 1 (5.9%) 5 (29.4%) 58 Incident 10 5 (50.0%) 1 (10.0%) 1 (10.0%) 1 (10.0%) 0 2 (20.0%) Prevalent 7 5 (71.4%) 0 0 1 (14.3%) 0 1 (14.3%) 59 Incident 25 18 (72.0%) 3 (12.0%) 1 (4.0%) 2 (8.0%) 1 (4.0%) 0 Prevalent 7 1 (14.3%) 1 (14.3%) 1 (14.3%) 1 (14.3%) 0 3 (42.9%) 68 Incident 16 14 (87.5%) 1 (6.3%) 0 0 0 1 (6.3%) Prevalent 2 2 (100.0%) 0 0 0 0 0 Untypable d Incident 381 276 (72.4%) 20 (5.2%) 19 (5.0%) 11 (2.9%) 7 (1.8%) 48 (12.6%) Prevalent 341 134 (39.3%) 19 (5.6%) 36 (10.6%) 11 (3.2%) 18 (5.3%) 123 (36.1%) a b c d Probability of clearing an oral oncogenic HPV infection was significantly different for incident infections compared to prevalently detected infections (log-rank test test p 1A p 1B Fig. 1 Clearance of incident vs. prevalent oral oncogenic HPV infections identified in the HIM Study.

A B C D Factors associated with clearance of an oral oncogenic HPV infection Clearance was investigated among 403 men with an incident infection of which 97 (24%) persisted at least 6 months; and separately among 186 men with a prevalent oral oncogenic HPV infection of which 103 (55%) persisted at least 6 months. Incident infections A lower proportion of Black men (13%) and men of other race (29%) had an infection that persisted at least 6 months compared to 50% of White men. Men who reported more lifetime female (33%) and male sexual partners (43%) had an infection that persisted at least 6 months compared to those reporting 0–2 female partners (2%) or 0 male partners (23%), respectivley. In both crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models for oral HPV clearance of an incident infection, no factors were significantly associated with clearance of an incident oral oncogenic HPV infection, though lifetime number of female sexual partners was marginally associated (aHR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.53–1.04) (Table 2 1 1 Table. 2 Factors associated with clearance among 403 men with an incident oral oncogenic HPV infection Variable Level Transient Infection ( n Persisted ≥6months ( n Unadjusted HR (95% CI) aHR a Country United States ( n 104 (78.8%) 28 (21.2%) REF Brazil ( n 107 (73.8%) 38 (26.2%) 1.01 (0.79–1.29) Mexico ( n 91 (72.2%) 35 (27.8%) 0.88 (0.68–1.13) Age b 17–30 ( n 97 (78.9%) 26 (21.1%) REF 31–41 ( n 100 (75.2%) 33 (24.8%) 0.95 (0.74–1.22) >42 ( n 105 (71.4%) 42 (28.6%) 0.89 (0.69–1.15) Race* Black ( n 53 (86.9%) 8 (13.1%) REF White ( n 145 (48.5%) 48 (49.0%) 0.86 (0.62–1.19) Other ( n c 101 (70.6%) 42 (29.4%) 0.77 (0.57–1.06) Ethnicity Hispanic ( n 137 (74.5%) 47 (25.5%) REF Non-Hispanic ( n 158 (75.2%) 52 (24.8%) 1.10 (0.89–1.35) Marital status b Single/Never married ( n 120 (77.9%) 34 (22.1%) REF Married/Cohabiting ( n 152 (77.6%) 44 (22.4%) 0.94 (0.75–1.17) Divorced/Separated/Widowed ( n 31 (62.0%) 19 (38.0%) 0.86 (0.62–1.20) Education (years) ≤12 ( n 120 (77.9%) 34 (22.1%) REF 13–15 ( n 87 (71.3%) 35 (28.7%) 1.04 (0.81–1.33) ≥16 ( n 93 (74.4%) 32 (25.6%) 0.90 (0.70–1.16) Smoking status b Never smoked ( n 126 (78.8%) 34 (21.3%) REF Ever smoked ( n 100 (74.6%) 34 (25.4%) 0.90 (0.71–1.15) Current smoker ( n 77 (72.6%) 29 (27.4%) 0.98 (0.76–1.27) Alcohol intake (# drinks per month) 0 ( n 56 (70.9%) 23 (29.1%) REF 1–30 ( n 130 (76.5%) 40 (23.5%) 1.08 (0.82–1.44) ≥31 ( n 106 (36.3%) 37 (37.0%) 1.15 (0.86–1.53) Lifetime number of female sexual partners categories* 0–2 ( n 39 (79.6%) 10 (20.4%) REF REF 3–11 ( n 128 (80.5%) 31 (19.5%) 0.95 (0.68–1.32) 0.95 (0.68–1.32) ≥12 ( n 110 (67.5%) 53 (32.5%) 0.74 (0.53–1.04) 0.74 (0.53–1.04) Lifetime number of male sexual partners categories* 0 ( n 247 (77.7%) 71 (22.3%) REF 1–2 ( n 25 (78.1%) 7 (21.9%) 1.15 (0.78–1.69) ≥3 ( n 25 (56.8%) 19 (43.2%) 0.98 (0.70–1.36) New female sex partners in the past 6 months b 0 ( n 177 (77.6%) 51 (22.4%) REF 1 ( n 69 (79.3%) 18 (20.7%) 1.01 (0.78–1.30) ≥2 ( n 49 (67.1%) 24 (32.9%) 0.92 (0.70–1.22) New male sex partners in the past 6 months b 0 ( n 281 (76.4%) 87 (23.6%) REF 1 ( n 11 (78.6%) 3 (21.4%) 105 (0.59–1.87) ≥2 ( n 10 (58.8%) 7 (41.2%) 1.12 (0.68–1.85) Frequency of oral sex given in the past 6 months b None ( n 85 (84.2%) 16 (15.8%) REF 1–6 times ( n 77 (73.3%) 28 (26.7%) 0.94 (0.71–1.25) ≥7 times ( n 129 (73.3%) 47 (26.7%) 0.95 (0.73–1.23) Ever had gingivitis No ( n 263 (74.7%) 89 (25.3%) REF Yes ( n 27 (71.1%) 11 (28.9%) 0.99 (0.69–1.41) Number of teeth extracted due to oral disease 0 ( n 186 (74.1%) 65 (25.9%) REF ≥1 ( n 103 (74.6%) 35 (25.4%) 1.00 (0.81–1.25) * P a b c Prevalent infections Among prevalent oral oncogenic HPV infections, a higher proportion of older men (age 17–27 years) (70%) had an infection that persisted at least 6 months compared to mid-age (28–38 years) (55%) and younger age (>39 years) (43%) men.

Oral HPV infections detected as prevalent, with an unknown infection history, were less likely to clear compared to infections newly acquired during the study follow-up, confirming they should be investigated separately. Among prevalent infections, older age and increased frequency of oral sex were significantly associated with lower likelihood of clearing an infection and timepoint persistenct of ≥6- and ≥12-months. Among incident infections, men with a larger number of lifetime female partners were less likely to clear their infection (aHR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.53–1.04) though this did not reach statistical significance. Men reporting other race, non-Hispanics, current smokers, and men reporting a larger number of male or female sexual partners had increased risk of an incident infection persisting ≥6 months. Similar results were observed for factors associated with persistence of oral HPV 16 infection. We separately investigated and observed differences in probability of clearance of an oncogenic oral HPV infection among incident and prevalent infections (median duration of 0 and 6 months, respectively; and 20 and 24 months, respectively among men who persisted 6 months or more). In the same HIM Study cohort, 6–8 months for genital HPV infections was observed and decreasing with increasing age 10 11 12 12 10 12 9 12 Overall, higher levels of sexual activity was a key factor associated with lower likelihood of oral oncogenic HPV clearance across both infections types. This was pronounced when persistence was assessed at key timepoints (≥6- and ≥12-month persistence) for both infection types. While previous studies both in The HIM Study 9 13 14 15 16 17 Unexpectedly, smoking was not associated with clearance of oral HPV. Although, among incident infections, smoking was significantly associated with persistence of ≥6-months, but not ≥12-months suggesting smoking may have an impact on short-term persistence. This is unlike results from studies of HPV at other anatomic sites 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 A recent study concluded little benefit of vaccination in men beyond 26 years of age 27 9 While our study has several strengths due to the prospective cohort study design and long-term follow-up of over 3000 men, there are limitations to note. This was a comprehensive investigation of factors associated with oral HPV persistence and as such only a few self-reported factors representative of each risk category assessed at baseline (i.e. demographics, substance use, sexual behavioral, and oral health) were included in the models. With self-report there is an inherent risk of reporting and recall bias. To minimize bias, surveys were self-administered via computer in a private room and the same questions asked throughout follow-up. The oral gargles are collected every 6 months, thus the precise date of infection acquisition and clearance are unknown—a common limitation of longitudinal cohort studies. The methods for defining clearance of an oral HPV infection used in this study are consistent with those of others studies 12 28 29 10 25 This study evaluates the clearance and investigate the factors associated with clearance of an oral oncogenic HPV infection in a prospective study of healthy men from the US, Brazil, and Mexico. With follow-up of up to 8 years and oral HPV testing at six month intervals, it represents one of the largest and most comprehensive evaluations of oral HPV natural history to date. We observed differences in clearance and risk factors for incident versus prevalent infections which is an important consideration as more studies investigate and draw conclusions on oral HPV natural history. We found no factors to be significantly associated with the ability to clear a newly acquired infection. Whereas among prevalent infections, older age and more oral sex was independently significantly associated with clearance. Further study is clearly needed to disentangle host demographic and behavioral factors, as well as immune response and viral factors at play with oral HPV persistence to address the increasing incidence of HPV-related OPC in men. Method Study population Participants for this study were recruited under the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) Study previously described 9 30 Data pertaining to sociodemographics, sexual history, alcohol/tobacco use, and oral health were collected at each study visit via computer-assisted self-interview. Collection of an oral gargle began in 2007 and continued to be collected at each study visit. The current study was restricted to the HIM Study Oral Sub-cohort which included 3137 men with at least two oral gargle specimens collected throughout follow-up. From this group we included men who had an oral oncogenic HPV infection detected at their first oral gargle collection (baseline) and men who acquired an new oral oncogenic HPV infection during follow-up. Prevalent oral oncogenic HPV was detected among 186 men and incident onocogenic oral infections were detected among 403 men. Sample collection and HPV testing Collection and processing of oral gargle specimens for HPV testing has previously been described 31 10 32 33 10 34 Study definitions This study included oral HPV infections detected at baseline (“prevalent”) and newly acquired throughout follow-up (“incident”). The history of prevalent infections prior to study enrollment is unknown. Due to this and prior findings from D’Souza et al. 12 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses specifically investigated oral HPV infection of an oncogenic type. Probability of clearing of an oral oncogenic HPV infection was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method with log-rank test test. Type-specific HPV infection was the analytical unit (i.e. it is possible to have more infections than participants due to multiple infections) in order to understand clearance of the infection itself and because some participants had multiple infections with different time to clearance. First, to confirm differences by infection type, KM curves were generated comparing prevalent vs. incident infections. Subsequent investigations were investigated in each infection type separately by age tertiles, country of resident and smoking. Due to a high proportion of transient infections, investigations both including and excluding transient infections were conducted to better estimate probability of clearance among the non-transient infections. Among both types of infection and separately among HPV16 infections only, differences in sociodemographic and behavioral factors were investigated among participants whose oral oncogenic HPV infection persisted 6 months or longer vs those whose did not persist (transient infections) using Chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. To investigate the participant-level factors (sociodemogaraphics and behavioral patterns) associated with clearance of a prevalent or incident infection, Cox proportional hazards models were used among incident and prevalent infections separately. Both unadjusted, crude models and adjusted models using backwards selection ( p Persistence of >6 months is utilized as the endpoint in study inverventions for primary oral HPV prevention 6 7 p Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary Supplementary information  Supplementary Information Reporting Summary Transparent Peer Review file Publisher’s note Supplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41467-025-62963-9.
