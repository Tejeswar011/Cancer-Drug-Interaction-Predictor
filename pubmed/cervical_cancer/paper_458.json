Due to the aggressive clinical presentation and radiological appearance, there is diagnostic difficulty in differentiating invasive fungal sinusitis from a malignant process. This is even more challenging in oncological patients who have undergone previous head and neck radiotherapy, due to possibility of a recurrence of primary malignancy and radiation-induced neoplasms. We report a rare case of invasive fungal sinusitis mimicking a malignancy in a post-radiotherapy patient. Our patient was a 68-year-old male, 25-years post-radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. He presented with a 3-month history of purulent sputum and right facial paraesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an irregular destructive enhancing mass of the greater wing of right sphenoid and pterygoid bone with extensive extension into nearby structures. In view of extensive local and bony invasion, and a history of radiotherapy, initial suspicions were that of primary malignancy, specifically radiation-induced sarcoma, and recurrence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. He underwent transpterygoid biopsy of the lesion, and histopathology demonstrated Aspergillus Keywords Aspergillosis Fungal sinusitis Radiotherapy Carcinoma Sarcoma pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2024 ",
