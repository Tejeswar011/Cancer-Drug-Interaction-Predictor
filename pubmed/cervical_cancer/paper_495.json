Obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction is a precursor to severe disease, and we and others have shown that arteries embedded in VAT, but not subcutaneous adipose tissue, exhibit robust endothelial dysfunction. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity, we recently linked VAT from obese mice to the impairment of endothelial Kir2.1, a critical regulator of endothelial function. However, the mechanism by which VAT impairs Kir2.1 is unclear. As Kir2.1 impairment is dependent on endothelial CD36, we hypothesized that lipolytic VAT induces Kir2.1 impairment through fatty acids (FA). To test this, we first treated endothelial cells with palmitic acid (PA) to determine whether the addition of exogenous FAs recapitulated our original finding of Kir2.1 dysfunction when challenged with VAT. PA inhibited Kir2.1 assessed via whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology, an effect that was dependent on endothelial CD36. To determine whether inhibiting VAT lipolysis prevents Kir2.1 dysfunction in the presence of VAT in obese mice and humans, VAT was pretreated with small molecule inhibitors of adipose triglyceride lipase prior to incubating endothelial cells with adipose tissue. This approach also prevented VAT-induced impairment of endothelial Kir2.1 suggesting that VAT-derived FAs may play a role. Furthermore, inhibition of lipolysis in the VAT of obese mice and humans significantly reduced endothelial FA uptake, similar to that observed when CD36 was downregulated. These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between VAT and endothelial Kir2.1 impairment and place VAT-derived FAs as potential paracrine mediators. NEW AND NOTEWORTHY These findings advance our understanding of the role of VAT in mediating endothelial cell dysfunction by highlighting the impact of adipose lipolysis and FAs on Kir2.1 channels in obesity. The present findings, generated from a mouse model of diet-induced obesity and adipose tissue from humans with obesity, suggest that VAT-derived FA may promote endothelial Kir2.1 dysfunction, perhaps following elevated FA uptake, as an underlying mechanism governing obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction.

Animals All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Delaware under protocol #1372–2023. Nine-week-old C57BL/6J WT mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (WT stock no. 000664) and housed in the same room under 12 hour light-dark cycles at the University of Delaware Life Sciences Research Facility animal vivarium. Mice were housed five mice per cage which contained Bed-o-Cob Enrich-n’Nest 6 16 19 16 27 Human studies Human studies were conducted with prior approval from the Institutional Review Board of the Christian Care Health System (CCHS) in collaboration with surgeons in the Christian Care Bariatric Surgery Program (Christiana Care Corporation Approval no. 42036). Studies involving human participants were performed in accordance with the guidelines stated in the Declaration of Helsinki. Participants recruited for this study provided written informed consent prior to the date of the planned bariatric surgery. Subjects ( n 28 29 Cell culture Human adipose microvascular endothelial cells (HAMECs) were maintained under standard culture conditions using an endothelial cell medium and supplements (ScienCell). Low-passage cells between P2-P4 were used in all experiments. Cells were seeded at ~ 80% confluency and allowed to form a monolayer prior to en bloc treatment with adipose tissue (5 mg/ml) from lean or obese mice or humans with obesity, as previously described [ 19 Patch clamp electrophysiology After treating the cells with PA, they were washed 2x with RT PBS. Following adipose tissue treatment, the tissue was discarded, and cells were washed 2x with RT PBS. HAMECs were then non-enzymatically dissociated using Versene (Gibco), resuspended in bath solution, and stored on ice. A whole-cell voltage clamp was performed on the HAMECs using thick-walled borosilicate glass pipettes (Sutter Instrument) with resistances of 3–5 MΩ after fire polishing. Currents were recorded in a high 60 mM K + + + Immunocytochemistry Following adipose tissue treatment, cells were washed 2x with RT PBS and then fixed at room temperature without permeabilization for 15 min using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. After fixation, heat-mediated epitope retrieval was performed at 95°C for 5 min in antigen retrieval buffer (Tris-EDTA, pH 9.0). The samples were removed from the heat for 5 min, and the process was repeated twice. Antigen retrieval buffer was aspirated, and the cells were blocked for one hour at RT using 5% BSA in PBS on a slow rocker. Following blocking, cells were washed twice with PBS for 10 min.

Concentrated stock solutions dissolved in DMSO (Sigma) were serially diluted in culture media before treating the adipose tissue with the desired working concentration. The 6:1 PA:BSA conjugate was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Cat. No. 29558) and diluted in endothelial cell medium to a final concentration of 250 μM. A vehicle control stock was prepared at 0.8 mM BSA and 150 mM NaCl and diluted to final concentrations of 40 μM BSA and 7.5 mM NaCl. The bath solution for whole-cell patch clamp experiments contained (80 mM) 80 NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl 2 2 2 2 Statistical analyses Sample sizes in the present study are in line with our recent observations using similar outcome approaches [ 19 p Results Inhibition of lipolysis in VAT from obese mice and humans prevents VAT-mediated impairment of endothelial Kir2.1 function Our recent study revealed that VAT from obese mice inhibits endothelial Kir2.1 function in a CD36-dependent manner, suggesting the VAT/CD36/Kir2.1 axis is a potential contributor to obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction [ 19 12–14 19 23 25 26 15 16 19 27 19 + 21 27 + Figure 1(A) Figure 1(A,B) Figure 1(C,D) Figure 1.

Discussion Visceral obesity is now recognized as a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with the accumulation of abdominal VAT being strongly correlated with disease progression [ 1–4 34 19 23 27 In the present study, we further probed the role of VAT in mediating the impairment of endothelial Kir2.1 by assessing the role of VAT as a potential paracrine tissue with a focus on VAT-derived FAs. Our hypothesis that the inhibition of lipolysis in VAT from obese mice and human subjects prevents Kir2.1 impairment is based on the following lines of evidence: first, the release of FAs from VAT is a major contributor to insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease [ 7 12–14 15 19 25 26 Potential role of VAT-derived FAs in impairing Kir2.1 function We recently showed that VAT from obese mice did not influence total Kir2.1 or CD36 expression in endothelial cells, as assessed by western blotting [ 19 The role of FAs in governing endothelial dysfunction has been well investigated in previous studies, pointing to the induction of oxidative stress as a major mechanism [ 15 35–37 16 27 38 39 40 27 41 While FAs and ROS have a clear link to endothelial dysfunction, Kir2.1 channels are also well known to be sensitive to the lipid milieu with distinct lipids that positively regulate channel function (e.g. PIP2) and others inhibiting the channel (e.g. cholesterol) [ 42–44 25 26 42 45–47 Determining whether one or more of these mechanisms underlie VAT- and FA-induced impairment of Kir2.1 represents a significant step forward in revealing suitable targets to prevent Kir2.1 impairment and, therefore, endothelial dysfunction in obesity. Furthermore, recent findings suggest that Kir2.1 regulation by lipids may be cell type-dependent in the vasculature [ 48 Therapeutic implications of deciphering a putative VAT/FA/CD36/Kir2.1 axis in obesity The breakdown of triglycerides that ultimately results in free FAs is a multienzyme process, the rate limiting step of which is the ATGL-mediated separation of the initial FA from glycerol. Previous efforts by Mayer et al. (2013) and Grabner et al. (2022) to identify suitable inhibitors of lipolysis resulted in two distinct small-molecule inhibitors separately catered to mouse (i.e. Atglistatin) and human (i.e. NG-497) ATGL [ 32 33 Elevated FA mobilization from adipose triglyceride stores in obesity is an established contributor to insulin resistance with links to adipose tissue inflammation as a driving factor [ 49 50 51–53 21 22 16 27–29 44 44 Limitations and other considerations The present in vitro study sheds light on a novel VAT/FA/CD36/Kir2.1 axis in obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction, although we have yet to establish a concrete role for this axis in vivo. Obesity is a complex, multifactorial metabolic condition, and many variables may play a role. An important point to note in this study is that despite inhibiting ATGL and presumably blunting FA release from VAT as previously shown [ 32 54 55 Our findings also indicate that a decrease in Kir2.1 function, as opposed to a decrease in channel expression, underlies VAT-induced impairment of Kir2.1. However, while the whole-cell patch clamp technique is the standard approach to assess Kir channel function in cells because it allows for easy comparison of large inwardly rectifying currents, it does not directly inform on channel open probability. Assessing Kir2.1 function in relevant single channel configurations (e.g. inside-out, outside-out patches) in endothelial cells and expression systems would directly address if VAT and FAs decrease the open probability of the channel. Such studies, specifically in the inside-out configuration, would also determine if VAT-derived FAs have the capacity to directly and acutely inhibit Kir2.1 through binding intracellular residues, an effect that would support the dependence on CD36-mediated FA internalization in intact cells. However, it should also be noted that the influence of VAT-derived FAs on other ion channels and signaling mediators could serve as complementary or even parallel paths to endothelial dysfunction. Other major endothelial ion channels, including Piezo1 and select members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of channels (e.g. TRPM2/4) have each been shown to be modulated by saturated FAs in ways that could promote endothelial dysfunction. Similar to endothelial Kir2.1 channels, activation of Piezo1 channels, which were shown to be inhibited by FAs [ 56 57 58 2+ 59 60 While the human data revealed a robust influence on endothelial Kir2.1 function and FA uptake, data from only four subjects with obesity are presented. This small sample size does not yet allow for stratifying the data based on demographic/clinical values or differences in medication, analyses that will certainly expand our understanding of obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction in this population. Finally, while SAT serves as an appropriate within-subject control for the effects of VAT on endothelial cell function, lean “healthy” controls were not available in human studies because of the source of biopsy collection (i.e. bariatric surgery). Therefore, in the absence of adipose from individuals without obesity, interpretation of our findings solely using this source of human adipose tissue has limited generalizability as we cannot yet confirm that VAT from lean individuals has no effect on endothelial Kir2.1 and endothelial FA uptake. Future translational studies that include non-obese individuals undergoing surgeries that afford access to relevant adipose tissue (e.g. hernia repair) may offer increased rigor when evaluating the role of VAT in obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction. However, caution should be exercised when considering this population as lean and/or “healthy” controls. Conclusions Our findings advance our understanding of the role of VAT in mediating endothelial cell dysfunction and highlight the impact of lipolysis and FAs on Kir2.1 channels in obesity. The present findings, generated from a mouse model of diet-induced obesity and adipose tissue from humans with obesity, suggest that VAT-derived FAs promote endothelial Kir2.1 dysfunction perhaps following elevated FA uptake as an underlying mechanism governing obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction. Future studies should further investigate the potential VAT/FA/CD36/Kir2.1 axis in the context of obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction.
