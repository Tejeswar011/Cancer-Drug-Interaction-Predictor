Introduction AML is a heterogenous hematological malignancy characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid progenitor blast cells. Although most patients initially achieve remission following chemotherapy, 75% of patients relapse and succumb to the disease within 5 years of diagnosis [ 1 2 3 RNA modifications are dynamic and reversible processes that have been shown to play an important regulatory role in cellular homeostasis [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 METTL3 METTL14 WTAP HAKAI CBLL1 10 YTHDF1/2/3 YTHDC1/2 IGF2BP1/2/3 HNRNPC HNRNPG HNRNPA2B1 FTO ALKBH9 ALKBH5 11 A number of studies have demonstrated the dysregulation of m6A-associated genes in AML leukemogenesis.

While most studies are based on adult AML data, reports from pediatric populations are rare. Further, the expression profiling and clinical correlation of multiple markers of m6A-associated genes in pediatric patient samples have not been reported so far. Our present study investigated the expression levels of various readers, writers, and erasers in pediatric AML patients. Additionally, we categorized the patients via the molecular subtyping of common mutations such as NPM1 FLT3 AML-1::ETO CBFB::MYH11 PML::RARA YTHDF1/2 METTL3/14 2. Methodology 2.1. Study Population Fifty-seven newly diagnosed pediatric AML patients (age ≤ 12 years) and twenty-three age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Cases were confirmed based on morphology, immunophenotyping, and cytogenetic analysis. Patients were treated with standard chemotherapy followed at our institute based on a modified UK MRC 15 protocol with cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide (ADE) for 2 courses followed by high-dose cytarabine for 2 courses [ 20 2.2. DNA and RNA Isolation Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from the patient’s blood samples when the patient was diagnosed (before starting the therapy) followed by DNA and RNA isolation using a DNA and RNA blood kit (Qiagen Co., Ltd., Hilden, Germany), respectively, as per the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA and DNA were quantified using NanoQuant (Tecan Inc, Tecan, Zürich, Switzerland). cDNA synthesis from RNA was performed using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, New York, NY, USA). 2.3. Molecular Subtyping Molecular subtyping was performed using the TRUPCR Acute Leukemia Panel Kit (3B Black Bio India Ltd., Bhopal, India) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Expression Level Measurement of m6A-Associated Genes cDNAs from the patient samples and age-matched healthy controls were subjected to RT-qPCR by using PowerUP SYBR green PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) using a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR System (QuantStudio 5, Applied Biosystems, TFS, Singapore). The expression profiles of METTL3 METTL14 WTAP YTHDF1 YTHDF2 FTO ALKBH5 Table S1 GAPDH −ΔΔCt 21 −ΔΔCt 2.5. Statistical Analysis Continuous variables were expressed as mean/median with range or interquartile range (IQR) for follow-up and categorical variables as ratio/proportion. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were performed to check the association between the categorical variables. Survival curves were calculated using the Kaplan–Meier curve and log-rank tests. Spearman R correlation was performed to check the correlation between expression and subtypes. The data analysis was carried out using SPSS v25.0 and GraphPad prism 8.0.2 software. A p 3. Results 3.1. Clinical Characteristics of Pediatric AML Patients at Diagnosis A total of fifty-seven patients with de novo AML were enrolled in the study. The study cohort consisted of 41 males and 16 females with a median age of 7 years (range 1 to 12 years). The median WBC count at diagnosis was 33,800/µL (range 300–690,000/µL). Out of the 47 patients, 11 had a blast count of ≤50% (range 23–50%) while 36 patients had a blast count of >50% (range 52–98%). Based on morphology, 3 patients were classified as subtype M0, 12 as M1 and M2 each, 3 as M3, 12 as M4, 7 as M5, and 3 patients as M7 subtype. Five patients remained unclassified. Out of 46 patients, 36 patients achieved morphological remission post-course 1 of induction therapy while 10 were given additional induction therapy to achieve remission. Further, six patients did not achieve complete remission at the end of induction therapy. The median follow-up was 8 months (IQR: 14 months). The details of various clinical and hematological parameters are listed in Table 1 3.2.

Molecular Subtyping of Pediatric AML Patients for Common Mutations and Fusions Further, we wanted to see if the expression of m6A-associated genes differs in the various molecular subtypes known and is related to disease prognosis in AML. Therefore, we performed the molecular subtyping of the patients and correlated the expression of m6A-associated genes among different subtypes. Out of 57 patients, 39 patients showed at least one of the fusion or mutation tested while 18 patients did not show any common abnormality tested in the study.

Differential Expression of m6A-Associated Genes in Different Subtypes in Pediatric AML Patients To examine the correlation of m6A genes with common fusions and mutations in AML, we analyzed the expression data with molecular subtypes of patients.

Discussion AML is a heterogeneous disease having a higher mortality rate as compared to other leukemias in children like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Due to the low rate of DNA mutations compared to other forms of leukemia, AML presents a special challenge in developing new targets of therapy. This is evident by the fact that treatment options for AML have been limited for decades while great advancements have been made in therapies for most blood cancer types [ 22 23 Our cohort of pediatric patients had a median age of 7 years with a predominance of male patients which is consistent with the literature [ 24 25 METTL3 METTL14 YTHDF1 YTHDF2 FTO METTL3 METTL14 25 26 METTL3 6 METTL3 METTL14 13 METTL3 METTL14 METTL3 METTL14 METTL14 METTL3 METTL3 27 YTHDF1 YTHDF2 28 29 30 31 YTHDF1 YTHDF2 YTHDF2 + YTHDF2 16 YTHDF1 28 YTHDF2 29 YTHDF1 YTHDF1 YTHDF1 YTHDF2 YTHDF1/2 YTHDF1 YTHDF1 YTHDF2 One of the most interesting genes involved in m6A modification is FTO FTO FTO 19 30 FTO 19 FTO NPM1 31 FTO ALKBH5 ALKBH5 ALKBH5 FTO FTO FTO FTO PML::RARA FLT3-ITD NPM1 19 32 FTO AML1::ETO AML1::ETO FTO FTO FTO AML1::ETO YTHDF2 AML1::ETO 33 FTO AML1::ETO FTO FTO AML1-ETO 19 FTO Further, upon examining the correlation of expression of m6A modifiers with common genetic alterations in AML, interestingly, we noted that FLT3-ITD METTL3 METTL14 YTHDF1 YTHDF2 FLT3-ITD FLT3 FTO FLT3-ITD NPM1 19 FLT3-ITD FTO protein ALKBH5 Figure 3 FTO FLT-ITD 34 35 36 37 FTO 38 5. Conclusions M6A regulators are important key players in AML pathogenesis, and our data provide valuable input from pediatric AML patients. Expression profiling of m6A genes is an imperative base for further studies on identifying pathways of regulation and molecular mechanisms for their role in cancer progression. Our data validated on patients are a significant contribution to m6A pathway research. Future studies on larger cohorts and functional validation will provide factual data that could be utilized in novel therapeutic interventions that are the need of the hour in AML management.

Values are plotted as median with range. Figure 2 Frequency of cases (in percent) across various gene fusions and mutations tested in pediatric AML patients (n = 57). Figure 3 Case distribution on the basis of m6A-associated gene overexpression, across different molecular subtypes in AML patients. Figure 4 Presence of different fusions and mutations commonly present in AML in cases with overexpression of METTL3/14 YTHDF1/2 Figure 5 Correlation matrix of molecular subtypes and m6A gene expression in pediatric AML patients (n = 57). The gradient of blue and red colors represents positive and negative correlation, respectively, based on the Spearman correlation rank score.
