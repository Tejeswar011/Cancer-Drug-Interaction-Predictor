The effect of local radiotherapy on the survival of recurrent or metastatic ESCC patients is unclear. This work is aimed to investigate the efficacy of local radiotherapy in combination with immunotherapy-based systemic therapy. Methods In this retrospective observational study, data were collected from recurrent or metastatic ESCC patients treated at the Radiotherapy Department of Jiangsu Province Hospital between March 2019 and December 2022. This study enrolled a total of 73 patients with recurrent or metastatic ESCC. The overall survival (OS) of all patients and OS stratified by different treatment patterns were analyzed. Prognostic factors influencing OS were examined using uni- and multi-variate Cox tests. Results The median OS of the study population was 21.4 (95%CI: 13.7–29.1) months. The median OS of patients who received radiotherapy in additional to systemic therapy was 31.5 (13.5–49.5) months, while the patients who received systemic therapy alone had a significantly shorter median OS of 10.7 (95%CI: 8.0-13.4) months. OS was also significantly different among patients receiving different cycles of immunotherapy. The median OS of patients after 1–6 cycles of immunotherapy was 14.6 (95%CI: 11.3–18.0) months, that after 7–12 cycles was 21.1 (95%CI: 0-43.8) months, and that after more than 12 cycle was 52.1 (25.6–78.6) months. Conclusions In the first-line therapy of recurrent or metastatic ESCC based on immunotherapy, the addition of local radiotherapy significantly improves patient survival. As the number of immunotherapy cycles increases, the survival benefits become more pronounced.

The highest regional incidence occurs in East Asian males and females, partially due to a significant burden in China [ 1 2 3 The effect of local radiotherapy on the survival of advanced esophageal carcinoma patients is unclear, but an increasing body of research suggests that aggressive treatment targeting the primary and metastatic lesions in advanced esophageal cancer may be associated with survival benefits [ 4 7 8 9 Materials and methods Patients An observational cohort study was conducted to examine local radiotherapy in treating recurrent or metastatic ESCC and assess its impact on overall survival (OS). The institutional review board of Jiangsu Province Hospital approved this study and waived the need for informed consent (2022-SR-746). Research involving human research participants have been performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Data were collected from recurrent or metastatic ESCC patients treated at the Radiotherapy Department of the Hospital between March 2019 and December 2022. We analyzed the recurrent or metastatic ESCC patients who underwent first-line treatment in our department. The inclusion criteria were: (1) pathologically confirmed ESCC, (2) recurrent or first-diagnosed metastatic ESCC, and (3) first-line treatment with immunotherapy-based systemic therapy. Exclusion criteria included: (1) history of multiple metastases, and (2) history of other malignant tumors. Metastatic lesions were identified with diagnostic computed tomography (CT) or 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. Some lesions required magnetic resonance imaging due to liver, bone or brain metastasis. The treatment plan must be confirmed by at least two physicians and approved by the chief physician. Patient cohorts and variables The patient cohort was defined as those receiving systemic therapy alone, or combined local radiotherapy and systemic therapy. Systemic therapy included immunotherapy (PD-1 inhibitors), chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or their combinations. Local radiotherapy mainly referred to radiation therapy for primary esophageal lesions or recurrent metastatic lesions. The prescribed dose fractionation was decided by the treating physician and adjusted as per the largest diameter and location of the tumor. The prescribed dose for radiotherapy was 40–60 Gy, delivered in fractions of 1.8–2 Gy, once daily, five times a week. Outcomes The primary outcomes were OS and its prognostic factors. OS referred to the time interval from the first identification of recurrent or metastatic esophageal cancer to death or the last follow-up. Prognostic factors of OS were examined with a multivariate Cox proportion hazard model, and the results were reported as hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical analysis Parametric data were statistically elaborated as mean and standard deviation (SD) and examined via Student’s t-test. Non-parametric data were expressed in median. Statistical analysis was performed on SPSS. OS was determined from Kaplan-Meier curves. Uni- and multi-variate Cox proportion hazard equations included prognostic factors for OS based on a systematic review of OS prognostic indices in patients with recurrent metastatic esophageal cancer, including age, gender, history of esophageal radical surgery, number and location of metastatic lesions, systemic therapeutic regimens, number of immunotherapy cycles, and whether combined with local radiotherapy. Two-sided p Results Patient recruitment A total of 385 recurrent or metastatic ESCC patients were screened from March 2019 to December 2022. Among them, 236 patients who received second-line or higher treatments for advanced ESCC, and 76 patients who did not receive immunotherapy were excluded. Finally, 73 ESCC patients were eligible and included.

However, different systemic treatment regimens based on immunotherapy are not significantly associated with improved OS. As for different cycles of immunotherapy, the OS of patients is extended as the number of cycles increases. Multivariate Cox analysis reveals no significant association between the location or number of metastatic lesions and OS. As several clinical studies confirm the efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors + chemotherapy in the first-line therapy of advanced esophageal cancer, treatment regimens based on immunotherapy for this cancer are being established [ 2 3 10 11 12 15 6 16 This study has two notable issues. First, OS is not significantly different among patients receiving different immunotherapy-based systemic regimens. The reason is that this study only involves patients receiving first-line treatment regimens, shortcomings of which may be compensated for by patients in subsequent second- or third-line treatments. Second, OS does not significantly differ among patients with different sites and numbers of metastases, possibly because significant differences cannot be observed due to the small number of included cases. There are many limitations. First, it is retrospective, which may introduce selection bias. This study is a retrospective analysis conducted within the radiation oncology department. The enrolled patient population may have included a higher proportion of individuals with local symptoms (such as dysphagia or vascular compression). When determining eligibility for local therapy, the number of metastases was a relatively important consideration. We tended to select patients with fewer metastatic lesions to receive local treatment. These factors may have introduced selection bias that could potentially affect the results. Second, only ESCC patients were included, which may not be generalizable to the population with esophageal adenocarcinoma. The follow-up time was short, the sample size was small, and the data were collected from a single center. Thus, multicenter, large-sample prospective trials are called for to clarify the efficacy of local radiotherapy and immunotherapy in advanced recurrent metastatic esophageal cancer. Conclusions Local radiotherapy can improve the efficacy of first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic ESCC based on immunotherapy.
