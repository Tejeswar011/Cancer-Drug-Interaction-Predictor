NETs and interleukin (IL)‐17 constitute a feed‐forward loop that promotes immunopathological development of inflammation. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the dynamic distribution of NETs and their colocalization with IL‐17 during the progression of apical periodontitis in established mouse models. Apical periodontitis was induced in mice by exposing the pulp of the mandibular first molars, with mandibles harvested on day 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 after pulp exposure. Micro‐CT and high‐resolution X‐ray scanning showed progressive increases in both the area and volume of periapical lesions from day 0 to day 28. Osteoclasts in the periapical lesions were identified using tartrate‐resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining, with their numbers peaking on day 21. Immunofluorescence staining was performed for citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3), myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil elastase (NE), and IL‐17 to localize NETs and their colocalization with IL‐17 in lesions. NETs, which were visible on day 7 and increased gradually until day 21, primarily located in inflammatory infiltration areas of the periapical tissue. Additionally, western blot analysis showed increased CitH3 expression in periapical lesions on day 21 after pulp exposure, further confirming the presence of NETs. Both RT‐qPCR and enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed increased IL‐17 expression in periapical lesions. The colocalization of CitH3, the major component of NETs and IL‐17 peaked on day 21 after pulp exposure. Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated that IL‐17 promoted NETs formation under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐simulated inflammatory conditions. Our findings indicated that NETs expression changed dynamically and suggested a feedback loop between NETs and IL‐17 during the development of apical periodontitis in mouse models.

Introduction Apical periodontitis is a common oral inflammatory disease characterized by both microbial infection of the dental pulp and the resulting host immune response, leading to inflammation and bone destruction in the periapical tissue [ 1 2 3 5 6 NETs are web‐like extracellular structures composed of decondensed chromatin decorated with cytosolic and granular proteins, representing a novel mode of neutrophil‐mediated immunity [ 7 8 7 9 12 13 Accumulating evidence from human and animal studies demonstrates that IL‐17, a pro‐inflammatory cytokine, is present in apical periodontitis and likely contributes to periapical bone destruction [ 3 5 14 15 10 12 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals A total of 30 C57BL/6J male mice aged 7–8 weeks and weighing about 20 g were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Hubei Province, China. All mice were housed in a specific pathogen free (SPF) facility under a 12 h light/dark cycle, with ad libitum access to standard rodent chow diet. Pulp exposure procedures were performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia (50 mg/kg), and all handling was conducted by trained personnel using gentle techniques to minimize stress. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of Wuhan University, China (Approval Number WP20210535). 2.2. Induction of Apical Periodontitis and Sample Preparation The mouse model of apical periodontitis was established as previously described [ 16 n 2.3. High‐Resolution X‐Ray Imaging and Micro‐CT Analysis High‐resolution X‐ray images were taken through DXS PRO (Bruker Corporation, USA) and analyzed using Bruker Molecular Imaging software to observe bone density of periapical lesions in mice as previously described [ 16 16 2.4. Histological Examination Sequential paraffin sections that clearly showed the distal root apex of the mandibular first molar, as well as, the central part of the pulp and root canal, were selected for staining and morphometric analysis of the periapical lesion area and volume. After deparaffinization, sections were rehydrated and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). One of every four sections was observed under light and fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany). 2.5. Tartrate‐Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP) Histochemical Staining TRAP staining was performed using a commercial kit (Sigma, USA; catalog number 387A) according to the manufacturer’s protocol to identify osteoclasts. Deparaffinized and rehydrated sections were sequentially incubated in Naphthol AS‐BI phosphate solution, freshly prepared Fast Garnet GBC solution for 1 h at 37°C, then stained with hematoxylin. Substrate‐negative controls were processed identically but without Naphthol AS‐BI phosphate. Multinuclear (≥ 3 nuclei) cells exhibiting dark red/purple cytoplasmic staining were defined as osteoclasts. For quantification, TRAP‐positive cells were counted in three randomly selected periapical areas per distal root under 40 × objective magnification [ 16 2.6. Immunofluorescence Labeling The following experimental steps were followed for all paraffin sections; dewaxing in xylene, passing through a gradient ethanol solution into water, followed by incubation with pepsin (Maixin, China; catalog number DIG‐3009) for 30 min at 37°C. The sections were then incubated with 2.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 37°C to block the endogenous peroxidase activity. Without washing, the sections were incubated with anti citrullinated histone H3 (CitH3) rabbit antibody (Abcam, UK; catalog number ab5103; 1:200), myeloperoxidase (MPO) goat antibody (R&D Systems, USA; catalog number AF3667; 1:100), IL‐17 mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA; catalog number sc‐374218; 1:50), or neutrophil elastase (NE) rabbit antibody (EPITOMICS, China; catalog number 5953‐S, 1:100) at 4°C overnight. After washing the sections thoroughly, they were incubated with donkey anti‐goat IgG (Dylight 488‐conjugated, Abbkine, China; catalog number A24231), goat anti‐mouse IgG (Dylight 488‐conjugated, Abbkine, China; catalog number A23210) or goat anti‐rabbit IgG (Dylight 594‐conjugated, Abbkine, China; catalog number A23420) at 37°C for 60 min in darkness. Subsequently, the sections were infiltrated with mounting medium containing DAPI (Zhongshan, China; catalog number ZLI‐9600) and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany). Negative controls were incubated with nonimmune bovine serum as the primary antibody. All images were taken under identical exposure settings. Quantification of immunofluorescence labeling was performed as previously described [ 17 18 2.7. Western Blot Analysis The mandibular first molars, along with a section of bone, were homogenized in ice‐cold RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, China; catalog number P0013B) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (MedChemExpress, USA; catalog number HY‐K0010, HY‐K0021). The homogenate was centrifuged (12,000 × g 2.8. RNA Extraction and RT‐qPCR Analysis The mandibular first molars, along with a section of bone, were triturated in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA; catalog number. 15596026). cDNA was then synthesized using the reverse transcription reaction kit (Vazyme, China; catalog number R223‐01). Gene expression was quantitated using SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, China; catalog number Q312‐02) and the mouse primers on a CFX384PCR system (Roche, Germany). All primer sequences were shown in Table 1 Table 1 The primers used in this study.

Enzyme‐Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Periapical tissue from the mandibular first molars along with surrounding bone, were carefully excised and weighed. The samples were then homogenized in 300 μL ice‐cold PBS, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail. After centrifugation (12,000 × g 2.10. Mouse Neutrophil Isolation Neutrophils were extracted following the manufacturer’s guidelines (TBD Science, China; catalog number TBD2013NM). Briefly, neutrophils were collected from femurs and tibias of 8‐week‐old C57BL/6J mice, and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (Gibco, USA; catalog number 11965092) supplemented with 10% heat‐inactivated FBS (Sigma, USA; catalog number F2442). The cells were treated with 100 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma, USA; catalog number LPS25), with or without 10 ng/mL IL‐17 (MedChemExpress, USA; catalog number HY‐ P73174 2.11. Cellular Immunofluorescence Staining Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X‐100 for 15 min. The cells were washed with PBS, blocked with goat serum for 1 h at 37°C, and subsequently incubated overnight at 4°C with a mixture of two primary antibodies: CitH3 antibody (Abcam, UK; catalog number ab5103; 1:200) and MPO antibody (R&D Systems, USA; catalog number AF3667; 1:100). The cells were stained with secondary fluorescent antibodies, mounted with DAPI, and then observed using a confocal microscope (Olympus SpinSR, Japan). All images were taken under identical exposure settings. Mean fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ software. 2.12. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). All data were analyzed using the Shapiro–Wilk test to confirm that they followed a normal distribution. Significant differences between the two groups were analyzed using an unpaired two‐sided Student’s t p 3. Results 3.1.

Discussion Apical periodontitis is a prevalent inflammatory disease, affecting at least half of the worldwide adult population [ 20 21 Neutrophils serve as the first line of defense against bacterial invasion from infected root canal in necrotic and exudative periapical lesions and are thought to be an important source of inflammatory mediators that interact dynamically with chronic immune cells to promote the remission or persistence of chronic inflammation [ 7 7 13 22 13 IL‐17, a classic proinflammatory cytokine present in periapical lesions, promotes neutrophil infiltration and contributes to periapical bone destruction [ 14 15 23 12 10 11 23 In summary, our findings suggest a potential feedback loop between NETs and IL‐17 that promotes inflammatory progression and bone destruction in apical periodontitis. Treatment with DNase I, a NETs inhibitor, can inhibit NETs formation and the progression of apical periodontitis in mice [ 13 5. Conclusion NETs were distributed in the inflammatory lesions of mice with apical periodontitis and changed dynamically with increasing pulp exposure time. In addition, NETs significantly correlated with IL‐17 expression and IL‐17 promoted NETs formation in the presence of LPS in vitro. Our findings highlight the critical involvement of NETs and IL‐17 in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis and present a novel perspective on the underlying mechanisms and potential targeted therapies of inflammatory osteolytic diseases.
