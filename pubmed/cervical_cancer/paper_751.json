A total of 106 metabolites were identified (table S2).

Adult p.P158A-NAMPT mutant mice had no motor function deficits compared to WT mice (fig. S10, A to E). In metabolic health study, adult mutant mice also exhibited similar rectal body temperature reduction during cold exposure, glucose tolerance, and insulin resistance to age-matched WT mice (fig. S10, F to H). Thus, our results from the mouse model demonstrated that p.P158A mutation in NAMPT was associated with the reduction in bioenergetics and the impaired excitability and glutamatergic synaptic output within the motor cortex and to the spinal cord. MN degeneration and gliosis in p.P158A-NAMPT mutant mice Lower MNs in the spinal cord innervate muscle fibers, control motor function, and degenerate in MN disease. At this end, we conducted immunostaining of lumbar 3 to 5 (L3-5) spinal cords with antibodies against choline acetyl transferase (ChAT), NeuN, and MAP2 to examine MN degeneration of aged mutant and WT mice ( Fig. 8 16 56 Fig. 8, E and F Fig. 8, G to I Fig. 8. p.P158A-NAMPT mutant mice exhibit MN degeneration and gliosis in the spinal cord.

Gene therapy holds the promise of durable, sometimes permanent, results, by replacing or editing faulty genes. On the other hand, small-molecule medicine has the advantage of flexible use but often requires life-long intervention. In our current study, we demonstrated the efficacy of NMN and P7C3 in restoring cellular bioenergetics and function of P-FBs.

Library preparation for the WES was performed on the siblings’ DNA samples with the SureSelectXT Human All Exon v5 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Subsequently, a paired-end index sequencing (2 × 100) was performed on the HiSeq 1500 sequencer (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) to obtain 87,232,798 reads for the male sibling (93.2% of target bases were covered at a minimum of 20×, whereas 97.7% had coverage of a minimum of 10×; mean depth of 92×) and 102,246,504 reads for the female sibling (94.1% of target bases were covered at a minimum of 20×, whereas 98% had coverage of a minimum of 10×; mean depth of 101×). The obtained raw data were processed with the pipeline described previously. Sequencing of genomic DNA from FBs Genomic DNA from control and patient FBs were extracted, and the DNA fragments containing NAMPT were amplified using PCR with primers 5′-TCTGGAATGCACAGCAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGCTATCCATCTGTCCATCC-3′ (reverse) followed by digestion with HpyCH4V restriction enzyme. The fragments of 432 base pairs (bp) from control and 362 bp from patient were purified for Sanger DNA sequencing using the reverse primer in PCR.

The PCR amplification for mutagenesis was essentially the same as that for the subcloning as described above, except for a longer extension time of 7.5 min at 72°C. After agarose gel confirmation of the PCR products, 1 μl of the Dpn I digested PCR product was transformed into the NEB 5αF competent cells. The miniprepared DNA plasmids were digested with Xba I to confirm the DNA before sequencing. The p.P158A mutation in the DNA construct was confirmed by Sanger DNA sequencing. Recombinant hNAMPT protein expression and purification pET28a-hNAMPT (WT) and pET28a-p.P158A-hNAMPT plasmids were individually transformed into BL21(DE3) chemically competent cells (catalog no. CMC0014-4X40UL, Sigma-Aldrich) and then plated onto kanamycin agar plate. Individual colonies were picked up and grew overnight in 2 ml of LB with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) in 5-ml culture tubes. In the morning, the prewarmed LB (100 ml) was inoculated with the overnight culture, incubated at 37°C for 3 hours, and followed by isopropyl-β- d g g Enzymatic activity and PTS assays of recombinant WT and p.P158A mutant NAMPT proteins The enzymatic activities of WT and p.P158A mutant NAMPT proteins were determined by one-step reaction method using NAMPT activity assay kit (catalog no. ab221819, Abcam) in the presence of different concentrations of the substrate NAM while the other substrates PRPP (0.5 mM) and ATP (1 mM) were present in reaction mixtures. Optical density (OD) at 450 nm was recorded using SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices) with the kinetic mode at 30°C for 120 min with readings every 5 min. The reaction velocity ( V V max K m V PTS assay was conducted similarly to the published studies ( 19 20 Fig. 2J dF dT T m Fig. 2K −1 A26209 Culture and biochemical assays of patient and control FBs The human FBs were isolated from skin donated by patient (the proband; P-FBs) and healthy individuals LD and LH, namely, C-FBs (LD) and C-FBs (LH) of Caucasians of Polish origin. Donors have given informed and written consent for their samples to be used for research. The skin samples were digested by dispase to eliminate keratinocytes and then cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (no collagenase digestion) in a 5% CO 2 For NAMPT activity assay, FBs were cultured in 75-ml flasks. Upon at least 90% confluence, culture medium was removed, and FBs were washed with fresh cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for one time.

Cells were quickly scraped with a cell scraper, transferred into tubes, vortexed thoroughly for 30 s, and kept in −80°C until use. Methanol and water should be LC-MS grade. LC-MS metabolomics Targeted and steady-state metabolomic analyses were collectively done at one time for accurate measurement as in our previous studies ( 47 95 Shotgun lipidomic analysis of lipids from FBs Shotgun lipidomics were performed as described previously ( 34 36 96 RNA-seq and analysis RNA sequencing RNA-seq of FBs was conducted by Novogene (Houston, CA, USA). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (catalog no. 15596026, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Cells were washed with 1× PBS for 5 min before collecting them using a cell scraper. Cells were then centrifuged at 12,500 g 95 Fixed pellets were rinsed with 100 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.35) (Sigma-Aldrich) and 130 mM sucrose. Secondary fixation was performed using 1% osmium tetroxide (Ted Pella, Inc., CA, USA) in 2-mercaptoethanol buffer using a PELCO BioWave (Ted Pella, Inc.) operated at 100 W for 1 min. Specimens were next incubated at 4°C for 1 hour and then rinsed with cacodylate buffer and further with distilled water. En bloc staining was performed using 1% aqueous uranyl acetate and incubated at 4°C overnight and then rinsed with distilled water. Using the PELCO BioWave, a graded dehydration series (per exchange, 100 W for 40 s) was performed using ethanol and transitioned into acetone, and dehydrated specimens were then infiltrated with EPON resin (250 W for 3 min) and polymerized at 60°C overnight. Sections were cut to a thickness of 75 nm using an ultramicrotome (Ultracut UCT, Leica Microsystems, Germany) and a diamond knife (DiATOME, PA, USA). Images were acquired with a JEM-1400 TEM (JEOL, MA, USA) at 80 kV on a Gatan UltraScan 1000 charge-coupled device (CCD) (Gatan, Inc., CA, USA). Mitochondria were analyzed using ImageJ [National Institutes of Health (NIH)]. Area, perimeter, Feret’s diameter, major axis, minor axis, and shape descriptors (circularity, roundness, solidity, and aspect ratio) were assessed. Feret’s diameter is the longest distance between two points along the outlined area and is also called caliper distance. Major axis and minor axis length are determined from the Fit Ellipse selection. Circularity is a score from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect circle and decreases as the shape becomes more rod-like. Roundness equals (4 × area)/[π × (major axis) 2 DHE staining To determine the effect of the p.P158A mutation in NAMPT on oxidative stress in FBs, we evaluated the ROS of FBs using DHE staining ( 104 F cum Mice All procedures in the following were performed according to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the University of Missouri Animal Care Quality Assurance Committee (protocol number 57121).

Glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test For the glucose tolerance test, mice were fasted overnight (16 hours), and blood glucose was measured with a glucometer (Contour next EZ glucose meter) from a drop of blood obtained from tail vein puncture. After fasting blood glucose was measured, mice were administered glucose solution [3 g/kg body weight (BW)] via intraperitoneal injection, and blood glucose levels were assessed 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 hours afterward.
