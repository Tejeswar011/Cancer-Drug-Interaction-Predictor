Introduction BC is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women and remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in this population [ 1 2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 13 15 16 17 18 19 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Patient Inclusion Criteria This multicenter, retrospective real-world cohort was conducted at three oncology centers and included patients treated between January 2010 and June 2024. Eligible participants were female adults (≥18 years) with de novo or recurrent metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who initiated first-line systemic anti-HER2-based therapy. HER2 positivity was defined as immunohistochemistry (IHC) 3+ or IHC 2+ with confirmed amplification by silver in situ hybridization (SISH). HR status (ER/PR) had to be documented; both HR-positive and HR-negative patients were eligible. The exposure of interest was baseline BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/height (m 2 Exclusion criteria were age <18 years; non-metastatic (early-stage) disease; ECOG-PS > 2 at first-line treatment start; unknown or non-amplified HER2 status; no documented height and/or weight within the allowed BMI window; any prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease before the index first-line regimen; follow-up <12 months among survivors (patients who died earlier were retained); or concurrent active second malignancy (except adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ cervical carcinoma). 2.2. Data Collection, Study Variables, and Outcome Definitions Clinical, pathological, and treatment-related data were obtained from institutional electronic medical records and archived patient files. Collected variables included demographic characteristics (age, sex), comorbidities, ECOG performance status, BMI, tumor localization (categorized as right, left, or bilateral), disease presentation (de novo or recurrent), histological type and grade, estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), Ki-67 status, and HER2 expression (defined as IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ with SISH-confirmed amplification). Information regarding metastatic sites and the number of metastatic lesions was also recorded. First-line treatment details included the type of regimen, treatment-related toxicities, and discontinuation if applicable. According to WHO classification, patients were divided into two BMI categories: <30 kg/m 2 2 The primary endpoints of the study were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). OS was defined as the time from the diagnosis of metastatic disease to death from any cause. PFS was defined as the time from the initiation of first-line treatment to the date of radiologically confirmed disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Radiological progression was considered an event for PFS, even if the patient continued on the same treatment following local interventions such as radiotherapy or surgery. 2.3. Ethical Considerations Access to patient data was restricted to the physicians involved in data analysis and manuscript preparation, in accordance with institutional confidentiality policies. The study was conducted in line with institutional and international ethical standards, including the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Istanbul University-Cerrahpaşa, Cerrahpaşa Faculty of Medicine (approval no: 2025/179, dated 5 March 2025). 2.4. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The distribution of continuous variables was evaluated through the Shapiro–Wilk test, as well as by inspecting Q–Q plots and histograms. Continuous data were expressed as either mean ± standard deviation or median with minimum and maximum values, depending on distribution. Categorical variables were presented as counts and percentages. For group comparisons, the independent samples t-test or the Mann–Whitney U test was used for continuous variables, depending on normality, while the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test were used for categorical variables, as appropriate. Survival outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method, with group comparisons assessed by the Log-Rank test. To determine prognostic factors, both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were applied. A two-sided p 3. Results 3.1.

Progression-Free Survival Outcome In the overall cohort, the median PFS was 24.0 months (95% CI: 17.5–30.5). The median PFS was 30.0 months (95% CI: 17.1–42.9) in patients with BMI < 30 kg/m 2 2 p Figure 1 In the univariate analysis, recurrent disease, bone-only metastasis, the presence of brain metastases and higher Ki-67 index were significantly associated with PFS. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, four variables remained independent predictors of PFS. Patients with recurrent disease had significantly shorter PFS compared to those with de novo presentation (HR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.46–3.55; p p p p Table 2 When we evaluated subgroups based on hormone receptor status, BMI appeared to have a differential impact on PFS.

Overall Survival Outcome In the overall cohort, the median OS was 110 months (95% CI: not reached).

Discussion In this multicenter real-world study including 169 patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer treated with trastuzumab-based therapies, the prognostic impact of BMI was evaluated. While a higher BMI (≥30 kg/m 2 2 2 The “obesity paradox,” which refers to the association between higher BMI and improved overall survival, has been described in several cancer types [ 20 21 22 23 2 17 14 13 16 24 15 Lohmann and colleagues evaluated HER2-positive breast cancer by stratifying patients according to HR status. Their analysis revealed no statistically significant prognostic differences between HR-positive and HR-negative subgroups in terms of BMI-related outcomes [ 14 25 2 26 27 In conclusion, obesity may exert a dual and complex role in cancer progression and outcomes. On one hand, excess BMI may offer a protective buffer against cancer-associated cachexia, potentially contributing to improved overall survival in certain patients [ 20 21 14 28 29 30 31 32 33 Building on this framework, we investigated whether baseline BMI is independently associated with outcomes. At this point, the novelty of our work lies in its focus on a real-world, multicenter cohort of metastatic HER2-positive disease, explicitly evaluating HR-specific effects and testing whether any BMI outcome signal persists after multivariable adjustment for clinical factors. Our findings suggest that the prognostic impact of obesity in breast cancer may vary across molecular subtypes. In the metastatic setting, our study may contribute by providing evidence that BMI alone may be insufficient as an independent prognostic marker once these factors are accounted for. Taken together, these results may help refine the field’s understanding of the “obesity paradox” and suggest that future work could integrate molecular subtype, body composition measures beyond BMI (e.g., visceral adiposity, sarcopenia), and longitudinal weight trajectories when evaluating adiposity–outcome relationships. This study has several limitations. Its retrospective design restricts causal interpretations. BMI was assessed only at the time of metastatic diagnosis, without accounting for changes during treatment. Additionally, lack of data on body composition (such as fat and muscle distribution) limited a more detailed evaluation of adiposity. The relatively small sample size in some subgroups may have reduced statistical power, and variability in treatment regimens could have influenced survival outcomes. 5. Conclusions This real-world multicenter study suggests that BMI is not an independent prognostic factor in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer overall. However, in the HR-positive subgroup, higher BMI may be associated with worse survival outcomes. These findings highlight the complex interplay between obesity and tumor biology, emphasizing the need for further prospective research that incorporates body composition analysis and molecular subtype stratification.
