Methods This retrospective cohort study included 651 pregnant women with sonographically confirmed uterine fibroids. Participants were stratified into three groups based on the maximum diameter of the largest fibroid: <5 cm, 5–10 cm, and > 10 cm. Outcomes assessed included preterm birth, PPROM, malpresentation, caesarean delivery, postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), fetal growth restriction (FGR), NICU admission, miscarriage, surgical outcomes such as operative time and blood loss, and a composite adverse perinatal outcome (CAPO). Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify variables independently associated with CAPO. Results Adverse events rose stepwise with fibroid size. Preterm birth occurred in 12.3%, 24.1% and 36.1% of the size groups ( p p p p p p p Conclusion Fibroid diameter emerged as a key determinant of obstetric and neonatal risk. Lesions > 5 cm, particularly > 10 cm, were associated with markedly increased rates of maternal haemorrhage, preterm birth, and neonatal morbidity. Such pregnancies should be managed as high-risk, with enhanced antenatal surveillance and individualized delivery planning.

Intramural nodules embedded in the myometrium can alter uterine contractility; subserosal tumours exert mass effects, whereas submucosal lesions distort the endometrial cavity and most strongly impair implantation [ 6 7 4 8 Despite these associations, evidence remains inconsistent owing to heterogeneous study designs, incomplete adjustment for confounders and frequent reliance on clinically detected rather than systematically imaged fibroids. Uncertainty persists about which fibroid sub-groups truly drive adverse outcomes and how best to counsel or surveil affected pregnancies. By analysing retrospectively collected obstetric data in women with sonographically identified fibroids stratified by size, number and location, the current study seeks to clarify these unresolved questions and provide clinically actionable risk estimates for modern obstetric practice. Prior studies suggest that fibroid size, more than number or location, influences obstetric risk. We therefore stratified patients into < 5 cm, 5–10 cm, and > 10 cm groups based on commonly cited clinical thresholds. We hypothesized that larger fibroids, particularly > 10 cm, would be associated with increased maternal and neonatal complications. Our objective is to generate clinically actionable risk estimates that refine counselling and management of pregnancies complicated by uterine fibroids. Materials and methods This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Ankara Etlik City Hospital and included 651 pregnant women whose uterine fibroids were identified during routine first-trimester ultrasound screening; participants were stratified into three groups based on the largest fibroid diameter: <5 cm, 5–10 cm, and > 10 cm. A total of 651 pregnancies satisfied the inclusion criteria. For the primary analysis, participants were grouped according to the maximum diameter of the largest leiomyoma: 387 women had fibroids measuring < 5 cm, 220 women had fibroids measuring 5–10 cm, and 44 women had fibroids exceeding 10 cm. Secondary analyses further stratified cases by the number of fibroids (single versus ≥ 2 nodules), by anatomical site (corporal versus cervical), and by topographic type (intramural, subserosal, or combined). Exclusion criteria included multiple pregnancies, chronic systemic diseases, hypertensive pregnancy complications, infections or sepsis during pregnancy, maternal malignancy, immunodeficiency syndromes, uterine anomalies (e.g., congenital Müllerian malformations), and incomplete medical records. The study period covered the period from 01/12/2022 to 01/12/2024 and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki with ethics committee approval of the Ankara Etlik City Hospital Ethics Committee (approval number: AESH-BADEK–2025 − 0258). Transvaginal and/or transabdominal ultrasound examinations were performed by fellowship-trained sonographers using high-resolution machines. The size (maximal diameter in centimeters), number, anatomical site, and topographic type of each fibroid were recorded at the initial scan. For group allocation, the largest recorded diameter during pregnancy was used. The principal endpoints of the study were five obstetric events: preterm delivery, defined as birth occurring before 37 + 0 gestational weeks; premature pre-labour rupture of membranes (PPROM); malpresentation at delivery, encompassing breech, transverse, or oblique lie documented at the onset of labour or immediately before caesarean section; postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), operationalised as an estimated blood loss of ≥ 1000 mL or the requirement for blood transfusion; and caesarean delivery, whether performed electively or after labour onset. Secondary endpoints captured a broader spectrum of maternal and neonatal morbidity. These included fetal growth restriction (FGR), placenta praevia, placental abruption, operative metrics such as total surgical time and intra-operative blood loss, utilisation of a Bakri balloon for uterine tamponade, and the need for maternal intensive-care admission. Neonatal well-being was summarised in a composite adverse perinatal outcome (CAPO) that integrated any of the following: prematurity, a 5-minute Apgar score < 7, admission to the neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU), clinically significant respiratory morbidity, or culture-proven neonatal sepsis. All outcome definitions conformed to current guidelines issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Data on potential confounders were extracted retrospectively from the hospital’s electronic medical record system. Maternal variables comprised age, height, pre-pregnancy weight, body-mass index (BMI), parity, mode of conception (spontaneous versus assisted reproduction), and history of prior myomectomy. Intrapartum details—including anaesthetic modality, estimated blood loss, and operative duration—were abstracted from operative and delivery notes. Sonographic characteristics of each fibroid (size, number, anatomical site, and topographic type) were recorded at first-trimester screening and verified against intra-operative findings in cases where intrapartum myomectomy was performed, ensuring internal consistency of imaging and surgical data. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 30.0 software. The normal distribution of continuous variables was evaluated by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and variables with normal distribution were presented as mean ± standard deviation, and variables without normal distribution were presented as median (interquartile range). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni test were used to determine the differences between groups for continuous variables with normal distribution, and the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for variables without normal distribution. Pearson chi-square and Fisher’s exact test were used for categorical variables. To assess whether fibroid size independently predicted adverse outcomes after adjusting for potential confounders, multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. CAPO was used as the dependent variable. Independent variables included fibroid size category (< 5 cm, 5–10 cm, > 10 cm), maternal age, parity, gravida, BMI, IVF, and history of prior myomectomy. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and associated p-values were reported. Statistical significance was defined as p Results A total of 651 pregnancies with sonographically confirmed uterine fibroids met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 101 pregnancies (14.5%) ended in misscarriage, leaving 550 ongoing pregnancies for obstetric outcome analysis. Among the 550 continuing pregnancies, 318 women (57.8%) had a largest fibroid diameter < 5 cm, 194 (35.2%) had fibroids measuring 5–10 cm, and 38 (7.0.%) had fibroids > 10 cm.

Compared to fibroids < 5 cm, lesions measuring 5–10 cm and > 10 cm were associated with significantly increased CAPO risk (aOR: 1.84 and 3.78, respectively). Other covariates, including maternal age, parity, gravida, BMI, IVF use, and prior myomectomy, were not statistically significant.

Statistically significant results are shown in bold ( p Discussion Our retrospective cohort of 651 fibroid-affected pregnancies is one of the largest single-center studies to evaluate obstetric outcomes by fibroid size. The major finding is a clear size-dependent impact of uterine fibroids on pregnancy course and outcome. Women harboring large fibroids (> 10 cm) had substantially higher risks of adverse outcomes notably preterm birth, malpresentation, cesarean delivery, and PPH compared to those with smaller fibroids. In our cohort, nearly one in three women with fibroids > 10 cm delivered before 37 weeks’ gestation, and almost half had a non-cephalic fetal presentation at term (compared to 13.3% with fibroids < 5 cm). The caesarean section rate rose to 92.1% in the > 10 cm group versus 56.6% in the < 5 cm group, reflecting both elective pre-labor decisions and intrapartum complications. Perhaps most striking, PPH occurred in nearly one-third of women with > 10 cm fibroids, a marked increase over those with small fibroids. Neonatal outcomes were also impacted: larger fibroids were associated with lower median birthweight, more neonatal intensive care unit admissions, and higher rates of respiratory complications in the newborn. In contrast, we observed that small fibroids (< 5 cm) – which comprised the majority of cases – were not associated with significant increases in adverse outcomes. These findings underscore the clinical significance of fibroid burden in pregnancy: fibroid size emerges as a key determinant of risk, and pregnancies complicated by large fibroids should be recognized as high-risk and managed accordingly. Large or strategically situated uterine fibroids trigger a cascade of interconnected pathophysiological processes that plausibly explain the spectrum of complications we and others have observed. Mechanically, bulky intramural, cervical or lower-segment myomas distort the uterine cavity, limiting fetal rotation and descent, which increases breech or transverse lie and, consequently, caesarean delivery; submucosal nodules that protrude into the endometrial cavity further reduce space for implantation, heightening miscarriage risk and early pregnancy bleeding as well as provoking abnormal placentation and regional uteroplacental hypoperfusion that can manifest clinically as fetal growth restriction [ 9 10 11 9 12 13 Our results are broadly consistent with recent international studies. Prior large-scale analyses have likewise found that pregnant women with fibroids face elevated obstetric risks. A multicenter study from China by Zhao et al. involving approximately 112,000 births reported that the presence of uterine fibroids independently increased the odds of breech presentation (adjusted OR = 1.3), cesarean delivery (OR = 1.8), and postpartum hemorrhage (OR = 1.2). Importantly, that study noted the effect of fibroid size: PPH rates rose significantly as fibroid diameter increased, mirroring our finding of a three-fold jump in PPH from the smallest to the largest fibroid group [ 14 15 Fibroid-associated preterm birth has been a consistent finding across studies. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis (18 studies, > 276,000 pregnancies) confirmed that women with fibroids have higher odds of delivering preterm (RR = 1.4 for < 37 weeks) and that this relative risk increases for earlier gestational ages (e.g. RR > 2 for extreme prematurity < 28 weeks) [ 16 17 14 One of the most debated topics has been fibroids’ influence on miscarriage. Submucosal fibroids have long been thought to raise miscarriage risk via cavity distortion [ 18 19 ) 20 Few large studies reported detailed neonatal morbidity, but available data indicate some impact of fibroids on neonatal health, largely secondary to prematurity. In Choudhary et al.’s cohort, one in five infants required NICU care [ 1 21 22 23 Previous international reports have yielded modest but non-trivial elevations in placenta-centered morbidity among women with fibroids. In the 24-study meta-analysis by Li et al., the pooled placenta previa rate was 2.48% in fibroid pregnancies versus 0.98% in controls—a nearly three-fold excess risk (RR = 2.99, 95% CI 2.06–4.35) [ 8 4 p 14 24 In our cohort, FGR displayed a clear size-gradient rising from ≈ 4% in pregnancies with fibroids < 5 cm to 16.7% when the dominant lesion exceeded 10 cm. This pattern is biologically plausible: large intramural masses may compete for uteroplacental perfusion and mechanically compress the placental bed, thereby curtailing fetal growth. International data are mixed but broadly support a size- or burden-dependent effect. The 24-study meta-analysis by Li et al. reported that fibroids increased the odds of low-birth-weight infants by ~ 30% and identified lesions ≥ 5 cm as the principal driver of that excess risk [ 8 17 22 4 Broad evidence syntheses affirm that fibroids modestly increase the risk of various adverse outcomes. A recent comprehensive meta-analysis by Li et al. confirmed that pregnancies with fibroids have higher odds of preterm birth, cesarean delivery, placental complications, PROM/PPROM, PPH, and neonatal complications such as low birth weight [ 8 23 1 12 22 Our findings underscore the necessity of individualized antenatal care pathways in pregnancies complicated by fibroids exceeding 5 cm in diameter. For such patients, intensified surveillance during the third trimester—including serial sonographic assessments of fetal growth and fibroid morphology—should be considered standard practice. In cases involving fibroids > 10 cm, multidisciplinary delivery planning is advised, ideally within tertiary care centers equipped with immediate access to blood products and anesthesia teams experienced in managing complex obstetric hemorrhage. Elective delivery, typically via cesarean section between 37 and 38 weeks, may be warranted depending on fibroid location, distortion of uterine architecture, and obstetric history. Integration of these findings into clinical protocols may facilitate earlier identification of high-risk scenarios and improve maternal–fetal outcomes. This study’s chief strengths are its systematic first-trimester ultrasonography—which captured both asymptomatic leiomyomas and early-pregnancy losses—its large sample size, and the uniform institutional protocol used to record detailed intra-operative metrics and neonatal endpoints. Stratifying tumours into < 5 cm, 5–10 cm and > 10 cm categories allowed us to demonstrate a clear, dose-responsive escalation of risk that “any-fibroid” studies often overlook, while the single-centre setting minimised measurement heterogeneity. This study has several limitations. First, fibroid number, type, and location were recorded but not incorporated into the multivariate models, limiting our ability to assess their independent contribution to outcomes. Second, the absence of an internal fibroid-free control group necessitated reliance on external population data for baseline risk comparisons, which may introduce bias due to differing study populations. Third, rare events such as placenta previa and abruption yielded low case numbers, restricting statistical power to detect meaningful associations. Finally, the lack of serial imaging during pregnancy prevented evaluation of interval growth or degeneration, which may influence clinical course. Several limitations warrant acknowledgement. The retrospective, tertiary-referral design may have introduced selection bias and limits external validity; an internal fibroid-free control arm was unavailable, so absolute risk differences were derived from external benchmarks. Rare outcomes such as placenta previa and abruption generated few events, restricting statistical power, and the absence of serial imaging meant interval growth or degeneration—potential modifiers of risk—could not be assessed. Future work should include prospective, multicentre cohorts that use 3-D ultrasound or MRI to quantify fibroid–placenta proximity, as well as randomised or rigorously matched studies evaluating pre-pregnancy myomectomy and emerging minimally invasive therapies (e.g., focused ultrasound). Long-term neonatal follow-up will also be essential to determine whether fibroid-related prematurity confers lasting health or developmental burdens.Formun Altı. Conclusion This large, size-stratified cohort makes one fact unmistakably clear, uterine fibroid burden—especially lesions > 5 cm—reclassifies an otherwise routine pregnancy into a high-risk condition. As fibroid diameter grew from < 5 cm to > 10 cm, we observed stepwise surges in preterm birth, malpresentation, caesarean delivery, postpartum haemorrhage, and fetal growth restriction, while placenta-centred complications remained rare unless the lesion encroached on the implantation zone. Early, meticulous ultrasound mapping of fibroid size and location therefore transforms prenatal care: it identifies women who need intensified surveillance, blood-bank–ready delivery planning and, in select cases, proactive surgical or medical intervention before conception. In short, measuring the myoma rather than merely noting its presence delivers the actionable intelligence obstetric teams need to protect both mother and child.
