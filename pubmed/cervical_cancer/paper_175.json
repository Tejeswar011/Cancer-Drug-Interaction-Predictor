Cytosolic pH (pHc) is one of the most essential intracellular microenvironments profoundly affecting charges, conformations and therefore functions of macromolecules.

Edited by Qi-Qun Tang Virtually, the charge and conformation of all macromolecules harboring acidic or basic moieties are influenced by surrounding pH ( 1 2 + 3 4 5 6 7 Most chemical reactions happen inside the cell or at the cell membrane, and as compared with pHe, pHc is even more dynamically regulated and tightly correlated with biological functions of a cell ( 3 8 9 10 11 12 13 Monitoring pHc in specific cell types under basal conditions, physiological activities, or disease states is the first step to study pHc physiology and pathophysiology. Several methods have been developed for monitoring pHc in cells ( 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 14 17 16 18 19 21 22 in vivo in vivo 23 24 25 26 We have reported that Smad5 is a pHc sensor, which can actively respond to pHc changes through nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Two acidic amino acid clusters and one basic amino acid cluster in the MH1 domain of Smad5 are responsible for this pHc sensing. Increasing in pHc leads to immediate nuclear export of Smad5, while decreasing in pHc slows down its nuclear export and ends up with Smad5 rapid nuclear accumulation ( 27 28 29 in vitro in vivo. Here, we validated that the ratio of Smad5 nucleocytoplasmic distribution is a general indicator of pHc in different cell types. We constructed a mouse model to report pHc in all types of somatic cells in vivo Results Nucleocytoplasmic ratio of eGFP-Smad5 ectopically expressed in cultured cells is a valid indicator of pHc As a pHc sensor, Smad5 responds to pHc changes through nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Meanwhile, Smad5 is one of the downstream signaling molecules of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) superfamily ( 30 31 Fig. 1 A B via Fig. S1 A–D Fig. 1 A B Figure 1 Establishing of the mathematic model between eGFP-Smad5 nucleocytoplasmic ratio and pHc A and B A B C and D versus C D E black circles red circles versus F and G F G H black circles red circles I and J versus I J K versus 2 3 2 We next asked whether the nucleocytoplasmic ratio of eGFP-Smad5 could serve as a valid and stable indicator for pHc. To this end, eGFP-Smad5 expressed HEK293FT cells and HeLa cells were incubated with BCECF, a cell-permeant and dual-excitation ratiometric pH indicator. Cells were then incubated in buffers in a wide range of pH (pH 6.0, pH 6.4, pH 6.8, pH 7.2, pH 7.6, and pH 8.0) with protonophore Nigericin to equilibrate the pHc to the pHe of the buffer ( 24 32 490/440 Fig. 1 C D Fig. 1 E Based on the standard curve generated, we studied pHc by calculating BCECF fluorescence ratio in both HEK293FT cells and HeLa cells under variable pHe buffering conditions in the absence of the protonophore Nigericin. In both cell types, pHc increased or decreased in the same direction as of the pHe changes ( Fig. 1 F H Fig. 1 I J Fig. S1 E F 2 3 Fig. 1 K Fig. 1 H Constructing eGFP-Smad5 transgenic mice for in vivo To study pHc in different cell types in vivo Fig. 2 A Fig. S2 A Fig. S2 B Fig. 2 B C Fig. 2 D E Fig. S2 C D Fig. S2 E F Fig. S2 G H 33 Fig. S2 I Fig. S2 J L in vivo Figure 2 Generation of pHc reporter mice A top middle panel bottom panel B C p p t D E t F green blue G G p t H G p t I J K J p t Reporter mice were immediately cardiac perfused with 37 °C prewarmed 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) after anesthesia. According to the nucleocytoplasmic ratios of eGFP-Smad5, the calculated pHc in spleen, liver and muscle cells highly coincided with their homogenate pH ( Fig. S3 A C Fig. 2 F H in vivo 22 34 35 Fig. 2 I Fig. 2 J K in vivo in vivo Mapping pHc in major cell types in reporter mice under baseline conditions To study pHc of major cell types, three male reporter mice with 6 to 8 weeks of age were immediately cardiac perfused with 37 °C PFA after anesthesia. Cell types in different tissues were immunolabeled with antibodies targeting GFP and featured proteins, and nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33,258. In most cases, β-catenin was labeled to mark the membrane boundary of a cell. Nucleocytoplasmic ratios of eGFP-Smad5 and pHc were therefore measured in individual cell types. We measured pHc in 14 major cell types of eight tissues in total and obtained pHc with a range of 6.45 to 7.51 in all the cell types tested ( Fig. 3 A O i.e. + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + Fig. 3 A O Fig. S4–S10 Figure 3 Mapping pHc of major cell types in pHc reporter mice.

In the same tissue, different cell types showed phenotype-specific characteristics even they were distributed in the same local area ( Fig. 3 B D F H J N 36 37 38 via Characterization of pHc-stable and pHc-sensitive cell types upon acute systemic acidification and alkalization challenges The normal blood pH is between 7.35 and 7.45, and acidemia and alkalemia are pathophysiological states that appeared in many severe acute or chronic diseases ( 39 40 Fig. 4 A B Fig. 4 C Fig. 4 D Fig. 4 E Fig. S11 Fig. 4 F Fig. S12 Fig. 4 G Fig. S13 Fig. 4 H Fig. S14 Figure 4 pHc changes upon acute systemic acidification and alkalization challenges A B p t C p p p p t D t E–H p p p t Cell type-specific pHc changes in type 2 diabetes mellitus Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) belong to the most prevalent metabolic disorders, which always lead to long-lasting systemic acidification. To examine the pHc in pHc-sensitive cells in T2DM, reporter mice at 6 weeks of age were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks ( 41 42 43 Fig. 5 A Fig. 5 B Fig. 5 C Fig. 5 D E Fig. 5 F G Fig. 5 H Figure 5 Aberrant pHc in pHc-sensitive cell types in type 2 diabetes mellitus A p t B p t C p t D p p p p t E D p t F p p p p t G F p t H p t I p p t J p p t K p t L t M p t pHc in most pHc-sensitive cell types, except for that in type 2 alveolar cells in the lung, showed an acidification phenotype in T2DM, coinciding with the acidified systemic pH ( Fig. 5 I L Fig. S15–S18 44 45 46 Although pHc-stable cells showed refractory pHc changes during acute systemic acidification or alkalization, mucous neck cells in the stomach and gastrocnemius muscle cells showed pHc alkalization in T2DM, deviating from the acidified systemic pH ( Fig. 5 M Fig. S17–S21 Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment show cell type-specific pHc changes Tumor microenvironment (TME) contains a variety of infiltrating immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells, contributing substantially to tumor immunology ( 47 48 49 + − Fig. 6 A C i.e. + + + + + Fig. 6 A E + + + + 12 In vitro 50 51 via 52 53 54 Figure 6 pHc of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.

Some cell types are resistant to environmental pH changes, and they maintain a stable pHc at either acidic or basic environmental pH. This indicates that maintaining pHc at an appropriate range might be crucial for executing normal physiological functions of these cells, such as mucous and acid secretion in neck cells or parietal cells, contraction of skeletal muscle cells, and electrical transmission in ganglion cells ( 37 38 57 58 3 4 pHc of α cells, β cells, and acinar cells in the pancreas, as well as that of hepatocytes and Kupffer cells in the liver, are prominently sensitive to acute environmental pH changes and systemic pH abnormalities caused by HFD-induced T2DM. The pHc fluctuations to systemic pH changes readily point to putative metabolic implications of pHc abnormality in these cell types. In pHc-sensitive cells, cells might accommodate their behaviors to variable systemic pH changes, and abnormality of this environmental pH sensing and responding might be related to disease onset and progression of metabolic diseases ( 46 59 60 33 61 62 vs. Oral sodium bicarbonate or intravenous drip has been used in the treatment of a wide spectrum of diseases ( 33 63 64 33 Our study encompasses some limitations, which may serve as directions for future investigation. We have mapped pHc of major cell types in mice under healthy and diseased conditions. Apparently, there is a large amount of work remaining in order to dissect out the underlying mechanisms governing pHc maintenance and sensing, downstream cellular adaptations upon pHc changes, and pathophysiological implications under the circumstance of pHc misregulation in disease states. Experimental procedures Animal studies All animal experiments were approved by the Laboratory Animal Research Center, Tongji University. All procedures involving animals were carried out in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee, Tongji University (approval number: 2020YANYUSHEN093). Mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J background and housed on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Cell culture and generation of stable cell lines HEK293FT and HeLa cells were regularly cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (Corning) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ExCell Bio) in 5% CO 2 65 Mycoplasma Measurement of pHc in cultured cells pHc in cultured cells was measured with the 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) probe as previously described ( 24 66 2 2 2 2 2 Generation of pHc reporter transgenic mice The CAG promoter-eGFP-Smad5 expression cassette flanked by 5′ and 3′ Rosa26 locus homologous arms was constructed in the pTight vector ( 27 Table S1 Western blotting analysis Western blot analysis of protein expression was carried out as previously described ( 27 Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation HEK293FT cells and HeLa cells with stable expression of eGFP-Smad5 were cultured in 10 cm dish for 48 h. Cells were washed twice with buffer B with a pH of 6.0, 6.4, 6.8, 7.2, 7.6, or 8.0, and then incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in the absence of a CO 2 g Immunohistochemistry pHc reporter mice were quickly anesthetized with avertin (600 mg/kg) and immediately perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) prewarmed at 37 °C. Tissues were removed and postfixed in the same fixative for 2 to 4 h at room temperature, which were then replaced with 20% and 30% sucrose overnight. Tissues were fast-frozen in cryo-embedding compound and cut into 16-μm sections. Sections were subjected to antigen retrieval followed by blocking (0.4% Triton X-100, 10% donkey serum) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were applied in staining buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 5% donkey serum) with overnight incubation at 4  °C. The next day, sections were washed and incubated in secondary antibodies (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were counterstained with DNA dye bisbenzimide (Hoechst 33,258) and mounted with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, Birmingham, USA). The antibodies used were GFP (1:500, chicken IgY, Aves, GFP-1020), β-catenin (1:300, rabbit IgG, Abcam, ab32572), β-catenin (1:300, mouse IgG, BD, 610,154), Rpe65 (1:300, rabbit IgG, Abcam, ab231782), Ager (1:300, rabbit IgG, Abcam, ab216329), Rbpms (1:100, rabbit IgG, Proteintech, 10073-1-AP), Sftpc (1:500, rabbit IgG, Proteintech, 10074-1-AP), Hopx (1:200, mouse IgG, Santa Cruz, sc-398703), Alb (1:300, rabbit IgG, GeneTex, GTX102419), F4/80 (1:500, rabbit IgG, Abclonal, A23788), H + + + + Cell-line-derived xenograft model 2.5 × 10 5 Measurement of pHc in vivo After immunofluorescence staining, images were captured using a Leica TCS SP8 (Leica Microsystems) confocal laser-scanning microscope. Confocal planes were scanned every 0.8 μm with 4 to 6 scans. Cell boundary was characterized by staining of plasma membrane conjugated β-catenin or cytoplasm, predominantly distributed cell type-specific proteins, and the nucleus was counterstained with Hoechst 33,258. The fluorescence intensity of eGFP-Smad5 in the nucleus and cytoplasm was calculated using ImageJ software, and the nucleocytoplasmic ratio of eGFP-Smad5 was calculated. pHc of each individual cell was calculated based on the following mathematical model: y = 8.20631 − 1.28918x + 0.35457x 2 3 Magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) experiment was carried out as previously described ( 22 34 2 2 2 2 A A C I D = M Z ( 3.50 p . p . m . ) × ( M Z ( 6.0 p . p . m . ) − M Z ( 2.75 p . p . m . ) ) M Z ( 2.75 p . p . m . ) × ( M Z ( 6.0 p . p . m . ) − M Z ( 3.50 p . p . m . ) ) The resulting relation obtained by liver tissue homogenate pH buffer calibration described in equation (pH = 57.843 × AACID 3 2 in vivo Liver pHc measurement with BCECF probe After tail vein injection of 200 μl BCECF-AM (25 μM) for 40 min, mice were quickly anesthetized with avertin, and a drip of 50 μl of BCECF-AM (50 μM) was applied on the surface of the liver. After 10 min of incubation, the liver was rinsed three times with prewarmed physiological saline, and BCECF fluorescence was measured with a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8) at two excitation wavelengths (405 nm and 488 nm), both collected at a collection window of 520 to 540 nm. For systemic acidification, after tail vein injection of BCECF-AM, mice were i.p. injected with 15% lactic acid (10 μl per g body weight). The ratio of 488 nm/405 nm was calculated using ImageJ software. Rotarod test Mice were trained for three sequential days on the rotarod. Each daily practice session consisted of placing the subject on the rotarod at a slow rotational speed (5 rpm) for 10 min. During testing on day 4, mice were placed on an accelerating rotarod from 5.0 to 40.0 rpm for 40 s. The latency to fall was measured. Measurement of homogenate pH Measurement of homogenate pH was carried out as previously described ( 67 2 GTT and ITT assays For the glucose tolerance test (GTT), mice fasted for 16 h were i.p. injected with 1 g glucose per kg body weight. Blood glucose was measured at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after glucose challenge with a Roche glucometer. An insulin tolerance test (ITT) was performed following a 6-hour fast. Mice were i.p. injected with 0.75 U per kg body weight of recombinant human insulin prepared in sterile PBS. Tail tip blood was then collected at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min to measure glucose levels. Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± SD.
