Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the leading sources of cancer mortality worldwide. An initial response to chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine (GEM) alone or in combination with other chemotherapies, is often followed by emergent resistance, underscoring the urgent need for targeted therapies. PDAC cells are highly addicted to oncogenic K-RAS mutations for their growth, progression, immunosuppression, and drug resistance, but mutant K-RAS in PDAC is still challenging to target. A N-glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin (TM), is a potent killer of PDAC cells. However, the free TM is very toxic in clinical settings. We developed a pH/hypoxia-responsive iRGD-tagged biodegradable nano-encapsulated TM ( NP NP in vitro G12D G12D NP Graphical abstract Tunicamycin is a nucleoside antibiotic that inhibits N-glycosylation, effectively targeting cancer cells. However, its clinical use is hampered by off-target toxicity. Our research demonstrates that nanoencapsulation can reduce this toxicity and improve targeted therapy for PDAC. This breakthrough studies will attract global interest in tunicamycin nanoencapsulation for therapies.

Currently, PDAC is the 3 rd nd 1 , 2 American Cancer Society: Cancer Facts & Figures 2024 and Hirhberg Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research) 3 , 4 3 5 Thus, the standard treatment for PDAC consists of surgical resection (if possible), chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and radiation therapy. Principally, two or several treatment approaches can be combined. Regrettably, the outcome of these treatment options failed to improve overall survival (OS) effectively. 6 1 , 7 6 , 8 Nearly 95% of PDAC patients are harboring oncogenic K-RAS mutations (mK-Ras), and K-RAS G12D 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 11 , 13 CCN1, a matricellular glycoprotein and a member of the cellular communication network (CCN) family growth factor, is overexpressed in human PDAC with mK-RAS and found to promote tumor progression via integrin α V 3 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 Tunicamycin (TM) is one of the potent nucleoside antibiotics and an inhibitor of aberrant glycosylation in various cancer cells.

The heterogeneity remains a barrier for therapies, as it promotes drug resistance. 64 , 65 , 66 66 in vitro NP Desmoplasia, a universal pathobiological feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is a significant barrier to therapies. 67 53 , 67 in vitro NP Although TM is considered a potent antitumor drug, the major weakness, as we discussed in the preceding sections, is that TM is not cell-type specific, causing toxicity following TM therapy. Thus, TM research in clinical settings has declined. To overcome the limitation, the drug delivery methods have been modified in this study by using pH and hypoxic responsive nanoparticles that only released the drugs in low pH or the hypoxic zone, which is prevalent in PDAC and other aggressive cancers. 23 , 26 NP 61 In summary, our studies have demonstrated the potential of targeted encapsulated TM to overcome the toxicity of free TM, leading to a significant reduction in PDAC xenograft tumor growth and an increase in mouse survivability. Our in vitro G12D NP G12D Limitations of the study The research demonstrating the pH-responsive targetability of TM nanoencapsulation to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells represents a significant advancement in drug discovery for pancreatic cancer. However, the conclusions drawn from these studies are based solely on a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model. To validate this hypothesis, it is essential to utilize additional models, such as organoids and orthotopic models. Furthermore, assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics (PK), both alone and in combination with other drugs, is crucial for clinical applications. Future studies that incorporate multiple models and parameters will enhance our understanding of drug-drug interactions and their molecular functions. Materials and methods Regents and antibodies All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and anhydrous solvents were obtained from VWR and Millipore. The drug information (Tunicamycin, TM) and targets were obtained from Drugbank version 5.1.12; the Drugbank accession number is DB13172 as a small molecule. TM (CAS No. 11089-65-9 and PO # 654380) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. For in vitro Cell culture The human pancreatic cancer cell lines, Panc-1, Mia-PaCa-2, BxPC-3, Capan-1, and AsPC-1, were procured from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

In brief, water, TrueGel3D, FAST-DEXTRAN, and the TrueGel3D RGD integrin adhesion peptides were mixed thoroughly. The mixture was incubated for 5 min to allow the RGD peptide to attach to the maleimide groups of the FAST-DEXTRAN polymer.
