Macrophages are immune cells capable of exerting both pro-tumor and anti-tumor effects. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) comprise a heterogeneous group of macrophages originating from monocytes and resident tissue macrophages. Their phenotypes and functions vary depending on factors such as tumor type, location, and stage. TAMs can promote tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, immunosuppression, and drug resistance, or they can facilitate antigen presentation and immune activation, thereby contributing to tumor elimination. As such, TAMs are potential targets for cancer therapy, and various pharmacological strategies and clinic-approved drugs have been suggested to modulate their activity, recruitment, and depletion. However, the complexity and diversity of TAMs present significant challenges to understanding their roles and designing effective drug interventions. This review summarizes the current knowledge of TAMs, and drug development for TAMs as anti-tumor therapy targets, emphasizing the importance of single-cell omics technologies for characterizing TAM heterogeneity and identifying therapeutic opportunities. Additionally, it presents the latest clinical trials focused on TAM-targeted therapies and drugs. Collectively, this review discusses the therapeutic opportunities and challenges of TAM-targeted drug therapies and offers future perspectives and directions for advancing our understanding and manipulation of TAMs in drug development.

Among the various cellular components within TME, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a heterogeneous group of immune cells, play essential but diverse roles in cancer development and therapy resistance 1 , 2 3 4 , 5 Fig. 1 6 Fig. 1 Figure 1 The dual roles of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tumor development. TAMs play a dual role in tumor development. On one hand, TAMs can promote tumor progression by advancing immunosuppression, promoting tumor angiogenesis, and facilitating the proliferation, survival, and metastasis of tumor cells. On the other hand, TAMs can also suppress cancer progression through the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, induction of antigen presentation and T-cell activation, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Figure 1 Given their pivotal roles in modulating tumor behavior, targeting TAMs for cancer therapy has garnered significant attention 2 , 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 , 14 15 γ γ α α β β 16 , 17 18 However, this M1/M2 classification is overly simplistic and does not fully capture the complexity of TAMs, which exhibit significant heterogeneity 19 20 , 21 21 22 23 24 25 Here, we will explore the latest advances in the understanding of TAMs, particularly through the lens of single-cell omics technologies, and summarize the clinical approaches to targeting TAMs in cancer treatment. We propose that a better understanding of TAM diversity and plasticity within cancer will enable the development of more effective and personalized anti-cancer therapies. 2 The complex roles of TAMs in tumor development TAMs play a dual role in cancer development and are a critical focus in cancer research. Developing strategies to modulate their function or deplete their populations within the TME is promising 26 2.1 Regulation of TAM polarization in the tumor microenvironment TAMs exhibit remarkable plasticity, with their polarization influenced by a variety of cytokines, signaling pathways, and factors within the TME. A key regulator of TAM polarization is colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and its receptor (CSF-1R) 27 28 , 29 30 31 Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that metabolic reprogramming plays a pivotal role in TAM polarization and impacts their immune functions in the TME 32 33 34 , 35 2.2 The cancer-promoting roles of TAMs 2.2.1 Advancing immunosuppression 2.2.1.1 Inhibition of CD8 + TAMs are generally believed to exhibit an M2-like phenotype, which plays a key role in the inhibition of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, also known as CD8 + Fig. 2 + + 36 37 38 + 39 + + + 40 , 41 + 42 , 43 Figure 2 The roles of TAMs in promoting cancer progression.

These cells inhibit various immune cells, including CD8 + 49 , 50 51 52 , 53 Fig. 2 2.2.1.3 Induction of metabolic interference TAMs also affect the functional capacity of T cells through metabolic interference. They deplete essential amino acids such as l l + 54 , 55 55 , 56 + 34 44 2.2.2 Promoting tumor angiogenesis 2.2.2.1 Secreting pro-angiogenic factors TAMs secrete several pro-angiogenic factors, including VEGF, IL-1 β 57 58 VEGF VEGF 59 60 , 61 Fig. 2 Notably, a specific subset of TAMs, TEK receptor tyrosine kinase-expressing monocytes (TEMs), plays a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis. TEMs are recruited into tumors by angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), a ligand for TEK receptor tyrosine kinase (Tie2) in endothelial cells, and are instrumental in the formation of tumor blood vessels 62 63 , 64 65 , 66 2.2.2.2 Inducing differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells TAMs also promote the differentiation of endothelial progenitor cells into mature endothelial cells, which are crucial for the formation of new blood vessels. IL-6 and IL-10, secreted by TAMs, activate the JAK–STAT3 signaling pathway in these progenitor cells, promoting VEGF release and tumor angiogenesis 67 2.2.2.3 Remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) TAMs further promote tumor angiogenesis by secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). These molecules facilitate the degradation of basement membranes and the ECM, which are essential for remodeling the pre-existing vasculature and enabling the formation of new tumor vessels 68 , 69 Fig. 2 2.2.3 Promoting proliferation, survival, and metastasis of tumor cells TAMs directly promote tumor cell malignant phenotypes through multiple mechanisms. First, TAMs secrete high levels of growth factors, like epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor, which bind with the respective receptors on cancer cells, promoting cell proliferation 70 , 71 72 73 74 75 76 α α 77 , 78 79 , 80 In terms of metastasis, TAMs promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of tumor cells via β 81 82 83 84 69 , 85 2.3 The cancer-suppressing roles of TAMs TAMs can also contribute to cancer suppression under certain conditions. This anti-tumor role is primarily exhibited when TAMs adopt an M1-like phenotype. 2.3.1 Production of pro-inflammatory cytokines M1-like TAMs secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN- γ α + 86 87 , 88 10 89 90 91 92 d d l γ α 93 2.3.2 Induction of antigen presentation and T-cell activation M1-like TAMs can act as antigen-presenting cells by processing and presenting tumor antigens, thereby priming T cells to recognize and target tumor cells 94 95 96 2.3.3 Production of ROS and RNS ROS and RNS have dual and opposite roles in tumor progression. As mentioned before, TAMs generate ROS or RNS, contribute to DNA damage and genomic instability of tumor cells, which induces tumor clone selection, but also have cytotoxic effects on tumor cells 97 , 98 99 100 101 2.4 The identification of distinct TAM subpopulations and functional roles via single-cell sequencing While the dual roles of TAMs in promoting and suppressing tumor progression are well recognized, emerging evidence suggests that TAMs encompass a wider diversity of subpopulations with distinct functions and characteristics beyond the traditional M1/M2 polarization model 19 scRNA-seq, an innovative technique, allows the analysis of gene profiles at the resolution of individual cells 102 103 , 104 105 106 , 107 108 , 109 hi lo lo hi lo + lo 110 high high 111 Through the combined use of scRNA-seq, CyTOF and other single-cell omics, several major categories of TAMs have been identified, including immunoregulatory TAMs, inflammatory cytokine-enriched TAMs, interferon-primed TAMs, pro-angiogenic TAMs, and lipid-associated TAMs 21 Fig. 4 112 SPP1 21 , 113 Figure 4 Single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals TAM heterogeneity.

Tumor cells secrete CXCL12 (also known as stromal cell-derived factor 1, or SDF-1), which binds to CXCR4 on monocytes. This signaling promotes the recruitment of monocytes into the TME and facilitates their transformation into immunosuppressive TAMs 197 , 198 199 3.3 Targeting and druggable strategies by TAM reprogramming Stimulatory signals from tumor cells, immune cells, and stromal cells can shift TAMs from anti-tumor to pro-tumor 154 , 173 , 200 One common treatment strategy is to use chemotherapy drugs to selectively reprogram TAMs 201 , 202 173 , 203 α 204 Additionally, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have shown potential for reprogramming TAMs by activating the TLR signaling pathway. This activation upregulates the expression of M1-related genes, like CD86 CD80 CD40 205 206 207 208 , 209 210 Tie2 inhibitors may also have the potential to target TAMs 211 212 , 213 214 215 , 216 Chimeric Antigen Receptor Macrophage (CAR-M) therapy is another innovative strategy. CAR-M therapy involves genetically modifying macrophages to recognize and attack cancer cells. Preclinical studies have shown the superior efficacy of CAR-M in solid tumors, and two CAR-M therapies have been approved for clinical trials 217 , 218 NCT04660929 217 , 219 NCT03608618 220 + 221 ζ ζ 222 These findings suggest that TAM reprogramming, through various therapeutic strategies, holds great promise for enhancing anti-tumor immunity and improving clinical outcomes for cancer patients. 3.4 Therapeutic strategies for modulating TAM-driven phagocytosis Cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47), a protein overexpressed on tumor cells, binds with SIRPα on macrophages and sends the “don't eat me” signal to macropahges 223 224 225 α 226 α 227 , 228 Another study showed that the MHC I component β 229 230 229 Moreover, CD24 is highly expressed in tumors and binds to Siglec10 in macrophages, also inhibiting phagocytosis 231 , 232 + 233 in vivo 231 3.5 Advancing TAM-targeted therapies via single-cell sequencing scRNA-seq provides valuable insights into TAM subpopulations, revealing their dynamic changes and heterogeneity. Therefore, this technology can guide the development of drugs targeting specific TAM subgroups, potentially altering their behavior or abundance to enhance the anti-tumor response. A key pro-tumoral role of TAMs is to suppress the immune system and promote tumor immune evasion 173 , 234 , 235 TREM2 129 , 130 Trem2 + 130 NCT 04691375 134 MARCO + 236 , 237 141 143 , 238 141 , 144 , 239 Additionally, pro-angiogenic TAMs are prevalent in most solid tumors and play a critical role in stimulating angiogenesis, making them potential therapeutic targets. To date, anti-angiogenic therapies in cancer focus on the inhibition of the VEGF–VEGFR signal 240 88 , 241 via 60 , 242 243 BI836880 244 123 , 245 246 247 248 There are also other novel strategies for targeting TAMs based on the utility of scRNA-seq. TREM1, a proinflammatory molecular expressed on monocytes and macrophages, is another potential anti-tumor target 249 , 250 249 251 , 252 252 46 Collectively, advancements in understanding TAM biology, particularly through scRNA-seq, have opened new avenues for targeting TAM-mediated immunosuppression, angiogenesis, etc. These insights have led to the development of novel therapeutic agents that are being tested in preclinical and clinical settings (summarized in Table 1 Table 1 Preclinical agents and clinical trials for targeting TAMs. Table 1 Target Cancer type Drug Combinational therapy Phases Result a Clinical trial ID b Inhibition of TAM recruitment CCL2/CCR2 Prostate cancer Carlumab NA II Stable disease: 1 patient (>6 months), 14 patients (34%, ≥3 months) mOS: 10.2 months NTC00992186 Advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer CCX872B+ NA Ib ORR: 30%–37% NCT02345408 CCR5 Triple-negative breast cancer Leronlimab Carboplatin Ib/II Confirmed partial response: 20% (2/10 patients) NCT03838367 CXCL12 Chronic lymphocytic leukemia NOX-A12 Bendamustine + Rituximab IIa ORR:86% (24/28 patients) mPFS: 15.4 months NCT01486797 GM-CSF Ovarian cancer GM-CSF GM-CSF+ II PFS: 11.3 vs P vs P a NCT02978222 Breast cancer GM-CSF+ GM-CSF+ IIb 25.7-Mo DFS: 83.8% vs P vs P NCT01570036 CSF-1R Metastatic breast cancer (mBC) or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) LY3022855 NA I Stable disease: 5 mBC patients (23%, lasting 82–302 days) and 3 mCRPC patients (25%, lasting 50–124 days) NCT02265536 Tenosynovial giant cell tumor Vimseltinib NA III ORR: 40% (33/83 patients) vs P NCT05059262 Tenosynovial giant cell tumor Vimseltinib NA II ORR: 72% NCT03069469 Tenosynovial giant cell tumor Pexidartinib NA II ORR: 39% (24/61 patients) vs P NCT02371369 Advanced solid tumors Surufatinib NA I ORR: 11.7% (9/77 patients) NCT02133157 Reprogramming of TAMs TLR7 Advanced liver cancers RO7119929 NA I Complete response: 1 patient (6%) NCT04338685 TLR8 Squamous cell cancer of the head and neck Motolimod (VTX-2337) Cetuximab Ib ORR: 15% (2/13 patients) NCT01334177 TLR3 PD-1-resistant advanced melanoma BO-112 Pembrolizumab II ORR: 25% NCT04570332 TLR7/8 Advanced solid tumors Resiquimod Pembrolizumab+ I/II 22 treatment-related adverse events were grade 1 or 2 NCT04799054 TLR9 Advanced melanoma CMP-001 Pembrolizumab Ib ORR: 23.5% (23/98 patients) vs NCT02680184 CAR Ovarian cancer or malignant peritoneal mesothelioma MCY-M11 NA I Treated in dose level (DL) escalating cohorts NCT03608618 STAT3 Advanced solid tumors OPB-31121 NA I Stable disease: 8 patients NCT00657176 Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma OPB-31121 NA I Recommended dose for OPB-31121: 200 mg NCT01406574 Hematologic malignancies OPB-51602 NA I Recommended dose for OPB-51602: 4 mg NCT01423903 Glioma or melanoma WP1066 NA I PFS:2.3 months (95% CI: 1.7 months-NA months) NCT01904123 Restoration of the phagocytosis in TAMs CD47 Untreated higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes Magrolimab Azacitidine Ib ORR:75%, CRR: 33% NCT03248479 Advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma AK117 Cadonilimab + XELOX II ORR: 75% (6 patients) NCT05235542 Higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome IMM01 Azacitidine II ORR: 64.7% NCT05140811 Anti-PD-1 failed classical Hodgkin lymphoma IMM01 Tislelizumab II ORR: 65.6% (21/32 patients) NCT05833984 Refractory microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer Evorpacept (ALX-148) Pembrolizumab + Cetuximab II ORR: 6.3% (1 patient) NCT05167409 Acute myeloid leukemia AK117 Azacitidine Ib/II Clinical trial for acute myeloid leukemia patients (ongoing) NCT04980885 Advanced solid tumors STI-6643 NA I Clinical trial for advanced solid tumors patients (ongoing) NCT04900519 a mOS, median overall survival; ORR, objective response rate; mPFS, median progression-free survival; PFS, progression-free survival; HR, hazard ratio; 15.2-Mo OS, 15.2-month overall survival rate; 25.7-Mo DFS, 25.7-month disease-free survival; DFS, disease-free survival; DCR, disease control rate; CRR, complete response rate; OS, overall survival. b Data from ClinicalTrials.gov 3.6 Current challenges and obstacles in the application of TAM-targeted strategies Despite the promising potential of targeting TAMs in cancer immunotherapy, several clinical trials have revealed significant challenges that warrant further investigation. For example, Pexidartinib, as we mentioned before, has been approved for treating TGCT, and is being tested in breast cancer and other malignancies. However, in a Phase 2 trial for glioblastoma, Pexidartinib was discontinued due to limited efficacy 253 192 1) Safety concerns. As demonstrated in the Carlumab trial for prostate cancer, targeting CCL2 may lead to off-target effects, highlighting the risks associated with modulating the immune system. This suggests that precision targeting of specific TAM subpopulations, such as SPP1 + C1q + 2) Therapeutic resistance. Like other immunotherapies, TAM-targeting strategies are susceptible to resistance mechanisms. Tumor plasticity, as evidenced by the failure of the Cabiralizumab/nivolumab combination, presents a significant challenge. Tumors can adapt by recruiting compensatory myeloid cells, thereby limiting the efficacy of TAM-targeted therapies. 3) Delivery methods: The experience with Pexidartinib underscores the difficulty in effectively delivering TAM-targeting agents to the tumor microenvironment. Despite success in treating other cancers, its failure in glioblastoma highlights the significant biological barriers that must be overcome to ensure efficient drug delivery. These challenges illustrate the need for continued research to optimize TAM-targeted therapies and address key issues related to safety, resistance, and drug delivery. 4 Conclusion and perspectives The field of TAM-targeted therapies is rapidly evolving, with the integration of emerging technologies and innovative strategies. Here, we summarize the latest knowledge regarding TAM heterogeneity and functions, introduce the advantage of scRNA-seq in uncovering TAM heterogeneity, and discuss the implications for developing effective anti-cancer drugs targeting TAMs. TAMs are not a homogeneous population, exhibiting variations in phenotype and function based on their tumor location and cancer stage. This heterogeneity complicates the development of universal TAM-targeting therapies 14 , 254 254 255 , 256 257 , 258 As scRNA-seq technology advances, we will gain a deeper insight into the diversity and functionality of TAMs. TAMs are progressively emerging as potential targets for cancer therapy, promising significant breakthroughs in cancer treatment. However, we must also recognize the dual roles that TAMs play in tumor development, as they both promote tumor angiogenesis and modulate immune responses, suppressing tumor growth. scRNA-seq technology enables us to comprehensively grasp the molecular characteristics and functions of different TAM subpopulations and to design various drugs targeting TAMs. This translational journey from scRNA sequencing to drug discovery not only enhances the precision and effectiveness of targeted therapy but also contributes to the advancement of personalized medicine, providing more suitable treatment strategies for specific patient groups. Additionally, emerging technologies such as scATAC-seq, scChIP-seq, CyTOF, and spatial transcriptomics are also poised to find extensive applications in TAM research 259 , 260 In the future, there will be a growing focus on the combination of therapeutic strategies targeting TAMs to enhance the efficacy of cancer treatment. Ongoing clinical trials and preliminary research have already demonstrated the potential application prospects of therapies targeting TAMs in cancer treatment. With further research and clinical experiments, we can anticipate the entry of more anti-cancer drugs targeting TAMs into clinical practice, offering new treatment options for cancer patients.
