It primarily affects males and has a high prevalence in Asia. Risk factors include hepatitis B and C, liver cirrhosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and alcohol consumption. Late-stage diagnosis results in a poor survival rate of approximately 20%, underscoring the need for early detection methods to improve the survival rates. This study aimed to identify prognostic biomarkers for HCC through bioinformatic analysis of microarray datasets, providing insights into potential therapeutic targets. Methods We analyzed five microarray datasets, comprising 402 HCC samples and 121 control samples. To identify relevant biological pathways, we conducted differential gene expression, Gene Ontology (GO), and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses. We identified hub genes and quantitatively assessed transcription factors and microRNAs targeting these genes. Additionally, molecular docking and dynamic simulations (100 ns) were used to identify potential drug candidates capable of inhibiting the activity of differentially expressed hub genes. Results Our bioinformatic approach identified several promising HCC biomarkers. Among these, CDK1/CKS2 was identified as a key therapeutic target, with a regulatory role in HCC pathogenesis, suggesting its potential for further investigation. Digoxin (DB00390) has been highlighted as a potential repurposed drug candidate because of its favorable drug-likeness and stability, as confirmed by virtual screening, ADMET analysis, molecular docking study and dynamic simulations. Conclusion This study enhances our understanding of HCC biology and offers new insights into drug interactions. It presents several promising biomarkers for the early diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Further investigation into CDK1/CKS2 as a therapeutic target and the role of the identified biomarkers could contribute to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for HCC. differential gene identification PPI network biomarkers docking molecular dynamics simulation The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

We obtained five datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and performed differential gene expression analysis to identify common biomarkers between diseased and control samples. To further our investigation, we employed various bioinformatics tools for Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses, hub gene identification, and survival analysis. Additionally, we conducted a quantitative assessment of transcription factors (TFs) and miRNAs targeting the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We also performed virtual screening and selected potential drug candidates based on ADMET analysis and found Digoxin (DB00390) as an inhibitor of CDK1.

Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID ( DAVID Functional Annotation Tools ncifcrf.gov 2.4 Construction of PPI network and hub gene selection The protein-protein interaction network of the common up-and downregulated gene set was generated in the Integrated Interactions Database ( IID utoronto.ca https://cytoscape.org/ 2.5 Identification of transcription factors (TF) associated the DEGs The TF2DNA database ( https://www.fiserlab.org/tf2dna_db/ Homo sapiens 2.6 Identification of miRNA targets The miRWalk database ( http://mirwalk.umm.uni-heidelberg.de/ 2.7 Survival analysis and validation of hub genes GEPIA ( http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/ 2.8 Virtual screening and molecular docking The necessary PDB file (PDB ID: 6GU7) was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. This file contains the crystalized structure of CDK1, CDK1 regulatory subunit 2 and the co-crystallized molecule AZD-5438 ( Wood et al., 2019 Byth et al., 2009 Zhang et al., 2019 Gan et al., 2023 http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/ 2.9 ADMET analysis Properties, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity, were tested for the selected molecules to determine their competence as drug molecules. ADMET analysis was performed using the ADMETlab 3.0 web server ( Fu et al., 2024 Banerjee et al., 2024 Pires et al., 2015 2.10 Molecular dynamics simulation Necessary molecular dynamics simulations were performed to concretize the results of the molecular docking study. MD simulations were performed using Gromacs 2019 software and the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) API on NVIDIA graphics processors. CDK1/CKS2 and CDK1/CKS2-Digoxin complex derived from molecular docking were imported into the gromacs and converted from *.pdb to *.gro format. Gromacs works with proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, with predefined force field parameters available in the software itself. However, these required force field parameters are not available for the ligands in Gromacs. So, a third-party server, “Ligand parameter generator” or “Ligpargen” ( Jorgensen and Tirado-Rives, 2005 Dodda et al., 2017a Dodda et al., 2017b Akharume and Adedeji, 2023 Piana et al., 2012 Richmond, 1984 Kumari et al., 2014 3 Results 3.1 Common set of genes differentially expressed across the datasets Differential gene expression analysis was performed on five datasets ( GSE41804 GSE45267 GSE62232 GSE112790 GSE121248 Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Venn diagrams of differential gene expression analysis across five microarray datasets. Common up and downregulated genes are circled in red. Two Venn diagrams compare datasets GSE41804 GSE45267 GSE62232 GSE121248 GSE112790 3.2 DEG enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways From the GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis in DAVID, 18 GO terms and one pathway were enriched by the upregulated genes, whereas 54 GO terms and 9 KEGG pathways were enriched by the downregulated genes. The GO terms were Biological Process (BP), Cellular Components (CC), and Molecular Functions (MF). The results are shown in Supplementary Table S1 . 3.3 PPI network revealed hub genes The PPI network of both up-and downregulated genes constructed in the Integrated Interactions Database (IID) was analyzed in Cytoscape using the plugin Cytohubba (EPC algorithm). We obtained the top 10 nodes among the upregulated and downregulated genes, as scored by Cytohubba. Since CDK1 and ESR1 in the up-and downregulated networks were the highest ranked, they were predicted to be hub genes. 3.4 Transcription factors (TF) targeting the top DEGs The TFs of the top five upregulated and downregulated genes were identified using the TF2DNA database. The upregulated genes, NEK2, CDK1, SULT1C2, RRM2, and ANLN, were regulated by 22, 76, 7, 42, and 40 TFs, respectively. Similarly, the downregulated genes, ESR1, LIFR, CXCL12, ADRA1A, and IGF2, were regulated by 113, 30, 36, 11, and 136 TFs, respectively. The results are presented in Supplementary Table S2 3.6 Top DEGs targeted by miRNA The top five upregulated and downregulated genes were subjected to analysis in the miRWalk database to identify miRNAs that participate in the post-transcriptional modification of these genes. The upregulated genes NEK2, CDK1, SULT1C2, RRM2, and ANLN were targeted by 12, 14, 10, 8, and 7 miRNAs, respectively. Similarly, the downregulated genes, ESR1, LIFR, CXCL12, ADRA1A, and IGF2 were targeted by 58, 36, 36, 32, and 31 miRNAs, respectively. The results are presented in Supplementary Table S3 3.7 Patient survivability affected due to hub gene expression The top five upregulated and downregulated genes were analyzed for their association with overall and disease-free survival in LIHC using the TCGA-LIHC cohort, which was divided into high and low expression groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the upregulated genes NEK2, CDK1, SULT1C2, RRM2, and ANLN showed that the CDK1 high-expression group had significantly poorer OS and DFS than the low-expression group and all other upregulated gene groups ( Figure 2 Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Overall survival and Disease free survival of the top 5 up and downregulated genes in HCC. Nine survival analysis graphs depict overall and disease-free survival over 120 months. Each graph compares survival rates of high and low expression groups for different genes (NEK2, CDK1, RRM2, SULT1C2, ANLN). Red lines represent high expression, and blue lines represent low expression. Annotations include Logrank p-values, hazard ratios, and sample sizes. Each graph's x-axis shows time in months, and the y-axis shows percent survival. Nine Kaplan-Meier survival plots show overall and disease-free survival rates by months for different gene expression groups: ESR1, IGF2, LIFR, CXCL12, and ADRA1A. Red lines represent high expression groups, blue lines represent low expression groups. Logrank p-values, hazard ratios, and sample sizes are included for each plot. The expression levels of the upregulated and downregulated genes in LIHC-affected and normal TCGA cohort data were also evaluated using GEPIA ( Figure 3 FIGURE 3 Expression level of the up and downregulated genes in log 2 Boxplots showing expression levels of eight genes (CDK1, NEK2, RRM2, SULT1C2, ANLN, ESR1, IGF2, and LIFR) in tumor (red) versus normal (gray) liver samples. Each plot includes individual data points, median lines, and whiskers indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles. Significance is indicated with an asterisk. The sample size is 369 tumor and 50 normal samples for each gene. 3.8 Properties of drug molecules identified by ADMET analysis ADMET analysis provides insight into various properties of drug molecules, such as absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity ( Tables 1 5 Zhao et al., 2021 TABLE 1 Absorption properties of the drug candidates.

Higher VDss values (>−0.45) suggest that the drug is distributed in the tissue ( Han et al., 2019 Pires et al., 2015 Drugs are typically metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2C1, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 ( Ogu and Maxa, 2000 Jindal et al., 2019 The CL plasma Horde and Gupta, 2024 1/2 While assessing toxicity, it was found that except DB00390, all the other drugs exhibited some levels of carcinogenicity. None of the drugs caused eye corrosion, and only DB00872 caused eye irritation. However, all drugs displayed some levels of skin sensitization, Mutagenicity, and Hepatotoxicity. DB00390 alone showed no drug-induced neurotoxicity. The lethal Dose 50 (LD50) parameter was used to show the amount of drug needed to be lethal to 50% of the test subjects. This value was calculated in mg/kg units. DB00390 and DB00511 are safe for oral administration ( Gadaleta et al., 2019 All the drugs were screened to estimate their drug-likeness based on their physicochemical characteristics ( Table 6 2 Alsfouk et al., 2024 Yusof and Segall, 2013 Zhou et al., 2023 TABLE 6 Physicochemical properties to determine drug-likeness.

Hydrophobicity varies from +3 (brown) to −3 (blue). Molecular structures are shown in eight panels labeled with codes: DB00390, DB00511, DB00696, DB00872, DB01396, DB09102, DB11581, and AZD-5438 with CDK1/CKS2 receptor. Each structure is displayed with vivid blue, white, and beige coloring, indicating hydrophobicity levels. Moreover, a comparative study with a well known molecule (AZD-5438) was performed through successive molecular interactions to establish repurposed drug DB00390 as a potential inhibitor of CDK1/CKS2. While AZD-5438 showed nearly half affinity towards the CDK1/CKS2 complex compared to DB00390, the RMSD value of AZD-5438 was slightly less than DB00390. Furthermore, Ligplus analysis showed that the number of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with CDK1/CKS2 dropped drastically ( Figure 5 FIGURE 5 Hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds of DB00390, DB00511, DB00696, DB00872, DB01396, DB09102, DB11581 and AZD-5438 with CDK1/CKS2 receptor (Ligplot analysis).

The top graph plots frequency against donor-acceptor distance in nanometers, peaking near 0.3 nanometers. The bottom graph shows frequency relative to hydrogen-donor-acceptor angles in degrees, with fluctuations peaking around 10 degrees. 4 Discussion Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most challenging cancers to treat owing to its late diagnosis and complex characteristics. It often affects males more than females. Numerous studies have focused on bioinformatic analyses to identify biomarkers for HCC. In our study, we conducted a differential gene expression analysis across five microarray datasets, identifying 19 upregulated and 64 downregulated genes that were commonly observed in all datasets. These commonly upregulated and downregulated genes were then subjected to GO and pathway enrichment analyses. The number of significant GO terms and KEGG pathways enriched with the upregulated genes was significantly lower than that of their downregulated counterparts. Following this, we constructed a PPI network for the up-and downregulated gene sets of HCC and identified key hub genes through analysis of each of the gene sets. We selected CDK1 and ESR1 as hub genes for our analysis. From the differentially expressed gene sets, we selected the top five upregulated (CDK1, NEK2, RRM2, SULT1C2, and ANLN) and downregulated genes (ESR1, IGF2, LIFR, CXCL12, and ADRA1A) for our studies related to gene-miRNA and TF gene targets, including patient survival analysis. We found that these genes including CDK1 and ESR1 were targets of a large number of TFs and miRNAs. In addition, CDK1 and ESR1 showed significant and poor OS and DFS in patients with HCC, and they were validated to be upregulated and downregulated in patients with HCC. KEGG/GO enrichment analysis showed that various pathways can potentially be influenced by the upregulation of CDK1 gene, e.g., mitochondrial ATP synthesis coupled electron transport, G2/M transition of mitosis, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, etc. Dituri et al. (2022) Xiao et al., 2019 Liu et al., 2021 The gene ESR1 encodes a transcription factor that is located in the chromosomal region chromosomal region 6q25.1 ( Tsiambas et al., 2011 Hu et al., 2022 Cheng et al., 2022 Wang et al., 2021 Zhang Y. et al., 2022 CDK1 is a member of the serine-threonine protein kinase family, which is important during transitions from the G1/S or G2/M phase of the cell cycle ( Enserink and Kolodner, 2010 Zhang et al., 2015 Zou et al., 2020 Wang et al., 2018 We propose that CDK1 and ESR1, identified as upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively, could serve as potential biomarkers for HCC. However, we focused exclusively on the upregulated gene CDK1 as a candidate for molecular docking and dynamics simulations, hypothesizing that a suitable drug could effectively inhibit CDK1 protein. In cancer, downregulated genes - particularly tumor suppressors-are typically not targeted for inhibition; rather, therapeutic strategies aim to restore or enhance their expression and function. In some contexts, increasing the activity of such genes may involve inhibiting their negative regulators instead. ESR1 (estrogen receptor 1) exhibits tumor-suppressive behavior in liver cancer, where its downregulation is associated with disease progression ( Hishida et al., 2013 O’Brien et al., 2021 Fuentes and Silveyra, 2019 Other bioinformatic studies on HCC have identified CDK1 and ESR1 as potential hub genes ( Table 8 Zhang et al.

These parameters were instrumental in ranking the selected drugs for further docking and simulation studies, ultimately guiding the prediction of potential candidates. Key assessments include the PAMPA assay, which measures drug permeability and passive diffusion across an artificial membrane ( Di et al., 2003 Wu et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2019 In addition to these parameters, plasma protein binding (PPB) plays a crucial role in drug distribution after administration. This aspect assesses how compounds interact with plasma proteins like serum albumin and glycoproteins, significantly affecting their bioavailability and therapeutic effectiveness ( Li et al., 2022 Cheng et al., 2012 Daneman and Prat, 2015 Choi et al., 2020 Building on a comprehensive study of the chemical drug-likeness of selected drugs, molecular docking studies present additional challenges, particularly in determining the necessary flexibility of the receptor backbone. This flexibility is crucial for accurately predicting the interactions of ligands with their targets. Although several methods exist to address this issue, they often fall short with certain types of molecules ( Meng et al., 2011 Martí-Renom et al., 2000 Sievers et al., 2011 Remmert et al., 2012 Supplementary Figures S1, S2 Supplementary Table S4 Supplementary Figure S3 Gunasekaran and Nussinov, 2007 Based on comprehensive ADMET analysis and docking studies, we identified Digoxin (DB00390) as the most promising candidate for further investigation. Digoxin has demonstrated anticancer activity against various human cancers. In the BALB/c nude mouse xenograft model, it inhibits lung cancer by inhibiting both DNA DSB and SSB repairs ( Wang et al., 2020 Gan et al., 2020 Eskiocak et al., 2016 Menger et al., 2013 Frankel et al., 2017 Huang et al., 2018 Kangra et al., 2025 To learn more about Digoxin - CDK1 interaction, we performed subsequent simulations and evaluated the stability of the drug-receptor complex. Molecular dynamics simulations provide a detailed understanding of the receptor-ligand complex stability by examining various parameters, including RMSD, root mean square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (RoG), solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), MM-PBSA and various characteristics of the generated Hydrogen bonds between the protein and ligand. The study was carefully designed to address specific questions, ensure robust simulation setups, and thoroughly analyze the results ( Hollingsworth and Dror, 2018 In this study, we emphasize several aspects that contribute to the novelty and potential translational value of our findings. First, the integration of multiple, well-curated datasets enabled a robust and comprehensive analysis, strengthening the reliability of the identified candidate genes ( Table 8 Okada et al., 2016 in silico in vivo Lu et al., 2025 in-vivo ex-vivo Kurzeder et al., 2025 in silico 5 Conclusion In conclusion, identifying reliable biomarkers is crucial for early diagnosis, prognosis, and effective treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). By analyzing five microarray datasets, we identified 19 upregulated and 64 downregulated genes associated with HCC. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that downregulated genes play a significant role in HCC pathology. Notably, CDK1/CKS2 and ESR1 emerged as hub genes that correlated with poor overall and disease-free survival in patients, underscoring their potential as biomarkers for HCC. We further investigated CDK1/CKS2 using molecular docking and dynamic simulations to explore its therapeutic potential. Additionally, our study identifies Digoxin (DB00390) as a promising repurposed drug candidate to overcome the limitations of existing drugs. Overall, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of HCC biology and drug interactions, paving the way for improved therapeutic strategies.
