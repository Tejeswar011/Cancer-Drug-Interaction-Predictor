This study examines the policy discourse surrounding the implementation of a nationwide HPV vaccination program in Ghana, analyzes stakeholders’ perspectives on programmatic promotion, and assesses the extent of institutional prioritization. Methods Eight key informant interviews were thematically analyzed using NVivo; and a cross-sectional online survey of 215 participants was descriptively analyzed using SPSS. Results Thematic analysis of interviews revealed core policy challenges: weak prioritization, inadequate resource allocation, and policy framings that lacked discourse on the right to health. Survey data demonstrated marked improvement in HPV awareness (76.6%) and substantial interest in vaccination (64.2%), suggesting a shifting public health landscape influenced by media engagement and growing health literacy. Conclusion Findings underscore insufficient prioritization stalled the institutionalization of a national cervical cancer prevention strategy creating a critical implementation gap. However, the relatively late average age of sexual debut offers a strategic window for effective HPV vaccine delivery. Importantly, the convergence of increased public awareness, heightened receptivity to vaccination, and the availability of external funding mechanisms, such as support from Gavi, presents a timely and actionable opportunity for policy advancement. This study highlights the imperative for renewed governmental commitment to cervical cancer prevention, emphasizing the imperative to operationalize HPV vaccination as a core component of Ghana’s public health infrastructure. cervical cancer vaccination priority setting HPV resource allocation Ghana Dahdaleh Institute for Global Health Research (DIGHR) pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes typesetter ts10 cover-date January-December 2025 Introduction Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer among women between the ages of 15 and 44 in Ghana.  1 2 3  2 2 3 4 5 6 9 10 11  12 (p. 1) 13 15 This study addresses the following questions: (1) what issues have stakeholders focused on as they have sought to bring policy attention to the HPV vaccination program in Ghana? (2) What are current levels of public knowledge of the role of HPV vaccination in cervical cancer prevention and receptivity to vaccine uptake? The study aims to make valuable contributions to the ongoing efforts to establish a successful vaccination program in Ghana and identify opportunities to improve HPV vaccination strategies, informed by stakeholder perspectives and public awareness. Agenda Setting and HPV Vaccination in Ghana This study draws on agenda setting as a heuristic underpinning within the policy process literature. Agenda setting is the process by which policy topics gain or lose the attention of policymakers.  16 17 18  17 19 20  21  22  23 24 25 26 27  28  29  30 (p. 2)  31  30 32 34 single-dose ®  35  36 Methods and Materials Data were collected using a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative semi-structured interviews and quantitative surveys. Key informant interviews (KIIs) elicit policy and system-level barriers and delivery insights from those shaping or executing HPV vaccination, while survey questions administered quantifies knowledge, attitudes, and intentions in the general population with acceptable precision. This pairing is consistent with Ghana-based HPV studies that combine qualitative insights with quantitative measures of awareness and acceptance in communities. 37 38 Supplemental File 1 39 40 41 42 The study methodology followed the COREQ 32-item checklist for qualitative research  43  44 Ethical approval was obtained on November 12, 2021, from the Human Participants Review Sub-Committee, York University’s Ethics Review Board, Office of Research Ethics (Certificate #: STU 2021-137). Key information interviews were conducted from January 5 th th st th Results Interviews Eight interviews were conducted overall; two interviews were conducted in person. One interview conducted via Zoom, was audio and video recorded with the informant’s permission that was transcribed using rev.com, crosschecked for omissions, transcription errors and manually corrected. Five anonymized key informants completed the interview questions and returned their responses by email. Empirical studies show that core themes in focused, relatively homogeneous domains typically stabilize within 6-12 interviews; we monitored for saturation and observed no novel codes after interview 7, supporting adequacy at n = 8. 45 46 Supplemental File 2 Survey The survey received 215 responses. Of these, 14 were excluded from respondents who resided outside of Ghana. A total of 201 survey responses were deemed valid, with 64 (31.8%) from male and 137 (68.2%) from female respondents, and the data were statistically analyzed using IBM Statistical software for Social Sciences (SPSS) (version 28.0). With n = 201, a conservative single-proportion precision calculation at 95% confidence (Cochran formula with P = .50) yields a half-width margin of error ≈ ±6.9%, which is acceptable for descriptive estimates of HPV vaccine awareness, attitudes, and intentions. 47 48 -value Supplemental File 3 Table 1 Table 1.

Key informant (GH-001-PHY) claimed that “…The health workers themselves are not even aware about it [ie, HPV and cervical cancer , health workers This deficit in awareness notwithstanding, it is crucial to note that an increasing number of Ghanaians are becoming aware of HPV infections and cervical cancer. This is important for overall cervical cancer awareness, as evident in our findings compared with existing literature. Still, stakeholders continue to encourage further information dissemination. According to a key informant from a women’s advocacy group, “…information [ie, on HPV and cervical cancer The same key informant further noted that; “… in order to educate women, people with specific religious (eg, religious leaders) or political beliefs, and people living in urban communities, with the goal to increase knowledge and trust in vaccines, targeted programs such as community outreach and media campaigns [ must be developed Eighty-one percent of survey respondents are aware of HPV, learning about it through various sources, especially schools. However, most respondents (71.1%) were of the view that government effort to educate the public on cervical cancer is inadequate. The relationship between respondent interest in government commitment to cervical cancer prevention and public education is strong ( Phi (φc) = 0.515 -value >.05 Policymaking To emphasize the need to address cervical cancer, a physician key informant stressed that, “Cervical cancer and HPV vaccination should be prioritised just as breast cancer is done in Ghana” (GH-002-PHY). The view of the key informant was that Ghana is not deficient in policymaking; however, the problem lies in implementation of the stated policies, “We [ie, Ghana In similar response to the role of policymakers and their influence in HPV vaccination in Ghana, a Women’s advocacy group key informant, explained that, “The Ghana Health Service (GHS) and some health-related civil society organizations have the power to influence HPV vaccination in Ghana. The development of a “National Strategy for Cancer Control and prevention policy” by the GHS and ability to influence public education in Ghana, is a great stride.” (GH-001-WGP) The same key informant however asserted that, “much is expected to be done [ by the government Priority Setting and Resource Allocation A physician key informant asserted that when it comes to government attention to cervical cancer prevention, “[T]here is no effective cervical cancer prevention program in Ghana” and continued that, “The policy on control of cervical cancer expired in 2016 [ referring to the NSCC Another physician key informant noted that, “We [ i.e., Ghana referring to HPV vaccination The survey findings indicate varying perspectives on the government’s prioritization of women’s health, 78 (38.8%) are of the view government prioritize it, 60 (29.9%) disagree, and 63 (31.3%) are unsure. A strong relationship exists between women’s health prioritization and government’s commitment to cervical cancer prevention ( Phi (φc) = 0.666 -value = .01 Right to Health None of the sociodemographic factors (age, gender, highest education level, employment) had a statistically significant relationship to right to health (P -value >.05) -value = .00 Discussion In elucidating stakeholders’ perspectives regarding the potential to develop and implement a nationwide HPV vaccination program in Ghana, key informants emphasized the need to enhance awareness, prioritize cancer prevention, and allocate resources for effective policy development and implementation. As the only existing policy document (NSCC) outlining a plan for cervical cancer control expired in 2016, no policy currently guides prevention and control strategies. This situation is not uncommon in Africa. For example, only 35 of 54 African countries have a policy on primary cervical cancer prevention, including HPV vaccination  49 (p. 2) In 2020, Ghana’s literacy rate (for those 15 years and above) was 80%,  50  41 (p. 899)  51 (p. 711) Awareness of HPV, HPV vaccination, and cervical cancer has been historically low in Ghana for the past decade. Healthcare workers, 37 38 52 53  41  54  55  56 The actions or inactions of policy actors (which could activate structural modifiers such as a plan), expose multiple dimensions of sociostructural power dynamics wherein the more powerful and well-resourced prevail with undesirable health inequity. Public education enables the positioning of individuals’ health decisions. The drawback to this enablement is the detrimental action or inaction of dominant policy actors who possess significant resources to influence policy outcomes. Public education to promote population health knowledge remains a predominantly governmental decision guided by sociostructural underpinnings. The intersection of education and governmental action or inaction particularly within the realms of the “politics of prevention” 57 58 17 27 In Ghana, prioritization of disease prevention and governmental resource allocation is dependent on how the disease is framed.  29 (p. 55)  29 (p. 54) 59 60 61 62 29 63  64 (p. 175) 65 67  63 (p. 10)  68 (p. 30)  63 (p. 5) 68 69 In Ghana, social mobilization for cervical cancer prevention (eg, HPV vaccination) is low or nearly non-existent.  51 (p. 711)  70 (p. 3) While the government remains the central actor in public policymaking, pressure to intensify the visibility of a public issue can equally come from organized interest groups who can garner political will. 63 70 71  72 (p. 175)  73 (p. 377)  72 (p. 82)  7 Policy Implications To advance Gavi’s commitment to accelerating HPV vaccination and averting preventable cervical cancer deaths, it is imperative that governments of Gavi-eligible countries collaborate with relevant stakeholders to establish and sustain national HPV vaccination programs, allocating resources to fortify weak health systems. Ghana has well-established policy and programmatic responses for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), but evidence reveals a lack of practical attention and political will to address cervical cancer despite its cost-effectiveness. 74 77  64 (p. 175) Future Work Characterizing the various actors within Ghana’s policy networks who shape cervical cancer prevention or health-promoting programs would further support analysis of cervical cancer prevention policy in Ghana. Systematically mapping out the policy actors and the process through which policies are developed - including the representation of various stakeholder groups in policy prioritization - would enhance understanding of the policymaking process. Such analysis may reveal potential levers for policy change, particularly by highlighting opportunities to strengthen the inclusion and influence of relevant stakeholders. Strengths and Limitations The study includes input from a range of relevant experts and a general survey of individuals with diverse backgrounds including in academia, women’s advocacy organizations, physicians, media, HPV researchers, and a section of the general public. This diversity provided comprehensive perspectives for context and understanding of the delay in nationwide HPV vaccine program. Limitations of the study are that key informant interviews were conducted from 05 January 2022 to 05 April 2022, and survey responses were received from 21 December 2021 to 15 March 2022. The limited timespan to collect data may have impacted opportunities to interview more stakeholders, even though 8 key informants provide thematic stability. The mixed methods approach that involves triangulation of data sources compensate for this shortcoming. Together, the samples are statistically sufficient and provide both depth (qualitative saturation) and breadth (quantitative precision) and aligned with established methodological standards for HPV vaccination implementation research. Conclusion In assessing a context of high incidence of cervical cancer, coupled with low public disease awareness and low governmental priority for cervical cancer prevention in Ghana, key informant perspectives shed light on these challenges and how governance processes could potentially alleviate them. The analysis found that awareness of HPV, the HPV vaccine, and cervical cancer, though still low, is gaining momentum, in contrast to previous studies that reflected persistently low awareness, this is expected to gradually increase particularly among literate populations, as the less literate catch up. The increased awareness may support policy entrepreneurs and societal groups to advocate for prioritization of cervical cancer prevention and control. The survey findings show a high level of vaccine confidence among respondents, suggesting that HPV vaccine uptake in Ghana promises to be high once a nationwide HPV vaccine program is implemented. Given the health intervention reports, draft policies, and health insurance schemes in place, Ghana is not deficient in policy or program design. A fundamental policy issue the study highlights is that policy implementation in Ghana is inhibited by low priority setting and inadequate resource allocation. The support Gavi offers for HPV vaccine programs, that the Ghanaian government may leverage creates a window of opportunity; especially as the costs of an HPV vaccine program are lower than those of not offering a program given its preventive effects.
