This study aimed to analyse the national liver cancer policies and programs in China. Methods This study applied a documentary research method using the systematic READ approach. Six national official websites and one public policy database were searched. The document analysis was based on the WHO Health System's Six Building Blocks and the WHO's four modules of cancer control (prevention, early detection, diagnosis and treatment, and palliative care). Results A total of 74 liver cancer-related policies and 8 programs published from 1 January 1984 to 31 March 2025 were included in this study. The analysis revealed that liver cancer management in China mainly focused on Medical products and Technologies Service Delivery Conclusions China’s liver cancer control mainly focused heavily on prevention, diagnosis and treatment modules with special focus on medical products and technology, as well as service delivery. Currently, less attention has been given to the detection and palliative care of survivors. The control of liver cancer in China still requires further strengthening of the health system for implementation. Considering the continual increase in the burden of liver cancer, it is imperative for future efforts to develop a comprehensive national liver cancer strategy.

The findings were expected to serve as valuable points of reference for China and international policymaking on advancing the development of national strategies for liver cancer control and strengthening health system for liver cancer management. Methods Study design This study applied a documentary research method by following a systematic procedure of READ approach [ 27 27 Data source The official websites of relevant government departments and professional organizations (including (1) the State Council of the People’s Republic of China; (2) the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China; (3) the National Medical Products Administration; (4) the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention; (5) the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine; and (6) the National Healthcare Security Administration were searched for relevant information, reference publications, and databases describing national initiatives for liver cancer control. In addition, the search process was broadened to include target policies through a public document database Beidafabao www.pkulaw.com/law Search strategy The search terms used in this study were a combination of the following terms in Chinese and English: gan (liver) OR ganai (liver cancer) OR ai (cancer) OR zhongliu (carcinoma); liver OR liver cancer OR cancer OR carcinoma.

Document type Other types of documents: working documents, region-specific documents, specific clinical or pharmaceutical guidelines, policy responses or interpretations 3. Scope Focus on a specific region, not national document 3. Validity of the document Invalidated documents Data screening and extraction Two authors conducted the document search independently. Duplicates were then removed from the initial search records. The screening of the documents was discussed between these two authors, and any discrepancies were confirmed by another author. For policy documents that met the criteria for this study, information was extracted, including: (1) background policy information such as the name of the policy document, year of issuance, issuing unit, and type of document; (2) information related to liver cancer prevention and control such as priority policies, government strategy, planning, program, projects that related to liver cancer prevention and control. Regarding the time of release, the policy documents for liver cancer control in China were further grouped into five periods: the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP) and earlier (1984–2005), the 11th FYP period (2006–2010), the 12th FYP n period (2011–2015), the 13th FYP period (2016–2020), and the 14th FYP period (2021-present). A FYP is a medium-term blueprint for the Chinese government to manage the economy and guide national development [ 32 Data analysis Two analytical frameworks were applied to the process of analysing policy information. The WHO Health System Six Building Blocks is widely used in health policy and health system research in a systemic thinking approach [ 33 34 35 36 28 31 1 Fig. 1 Combined theoretical framework Results Characterstics of included policy documents A total of 980 records were retrieved from the policy search. After screening by title and context, 74 policies were included in this study [ 37 110 2 Fig. 2 PRISMA flow diagram The number of liver cancer policy documents in China has gradually increased over the years, but the number of policies within each FYP is relatively stable (see Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Trends of the release of policy documents on liver cancer in China Included policy documents can be divided into three levels: high-level and strategic planning policies (including medical and non-medical national planning policies), cancer control related policies (including documents related to cancer and liver cancer), and hepatitis prevention and control related policies (see Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Leading polices and policy cross-referencing National liver cancer policy mapping Under the WHO six building blocks framework, the included policy document covered each block (shown in Fig. 5 Medical products & Technology Service delivery Service delivery Medical products & technology, Health financing Fig. 5 Number of policy documents mapped against the combined WHO six building blocks and WHO cancer control model 74 policy papers concerning liver cancer prevention and control were released during various periods. In the overall situation of the health system, the number of policies in the WHO six building blocks during the 13th FYP period was relatively high, showing a trend of increasing year by year in the number of policies. Within the WHO four modules of cancer control, the most common policies focused on Diagnosis & Treatment Prevention Early detection Palliative care For Prevention 28 For Early detection 29 98 98 For Diagnosis & Treatment 30 94 108 81 108 Palliative care 31 44 73 Content analysis of initiatives in liver cancer control policy The top ten most frequent policy keywords of included documents were hepatitis B, liver cancer, diagnostic and treatment approaches, early diagnosis and treatment, vaccination, viral hepatitis, prevention, screening, health insurance, and disease awareness. We then aligned policy initiative examples with the four modules of cancer control, as detailed in Tables 2 3 4 5 Table 2 Prevention: identified primary strategies for liver cancer prevention and control with a focus on viral hepatitis prevention and control WHO six building blocks Examples of policy initiatives Service delivery Continuing promotion of viral hepatitis vaccination and integration of hepatitis B into the national immunization program [ 39 47 50 69 105 Health information Establish and improve a hepatitis C prevention and control information system based on the hepatitis C epidemic situation, population infection status and characteristics, disease outcomes, etc. [ 92 99 Health workforce Enhancing the training of viral hepatitis healthcare professionals: for instance, between 2010 and 2012, 10,000 physicians specializing in relevant fields from 1,000 county hospitals in 15 high hepatitis B incidence provinces will receive training on standardized diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepatitis B [ 53 43 Health financing Multi-channel funding: promoting diverse and tailored health management service packages by social entities and investigating commercial health insurance as a financing or partnership avenue [ 95 Medical products and technology Promoting research and development of combined multivalent and genetically engineered vaccines [ 43 92 Leadership and governance Viral hepatitis prevention and control plans have been updated and released at different time stages, including the national hepatitis B prevention and control plan [ 99 92 Table 3 Early detection: identified prevention and control strategies for key populations with liver cancer WHO six building blocks Examples of policy initiatives Service delivery Strengthening public health services, screening and early detection of chronic diseases, and early diagnosis and treatment of key cancers in high-prevalence areas [ 72 95 Health information systems Establishing an authoritative platform for spreading popular scientific information and coordinating professional organizations to gather and publish essential information and knowledge on cancer prevention and treatment.

For example, the Quality Control Indicators for Standardized Diagnosis and Treatment of Liver Cancer in China (2022 Edition) were released to better promote the quality control of standardized diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer [ 100 Health information systems Establishing a comprehensive information management system. Enhance tumor registration and reporting, implement quality control standards, and improve reporting efficiency and quality. By 2030, ensure full coverage of tumor registration in all counties and districts, establish no less than 1,145 national tumor registries, and conduct high-precision tumor registration to collect crucial information [ 105 73 Health workforce Strengthening cancer disciplines and improving treatment in resource-limited areas by sharing expertise and technology. Innovate diagnosis and treatment models based on traditional Chinese medicine while training professionals in this field [ 105 Health financing Encourage social capital investment in cancer prevention and treatment, promote a diversified funding mechanism, and unite efforts to support and ensure progress in cancer care [ 105 Medical products and technology Promote research on hepatitis B and liver cancer treatments [ 76 105 Exploring and innovating cancer diagnosis and treatment modes in line with Chinese medicine theories, and cultivate cancer Chinese medicine, prevention and treatment professionals [ 84 Leadership and governance The policy focuses on standardizing liver cancer care in medical institutions to boost the five-year survival rate by 15% [ 94 100 Table 5 Palliative care: focusing on the health of people with advanced liver cancer WHO six building blocks Examples of policy initiatives Service delivery Promote palliative care, standardize palliative care plans, and improve the quality of life of patients with advanced cancer [ 44 73 Health information systems Medical institutions like the National Cancer Center and regional medical centers focusing on oncology need to enhance cooperation to improve the cancer prevention and control network [ 105 Health workforce Include cancer palliative treatment and pain relief programs in teaching.

Per the 2022 Chinese Liver Cancer Screening Guidelines, individuals at high risk include: (1) those with cirrhosis of any etiology (including alcoholic liver disease, and metabolic associated fatty liver disease), and (2) chronic HBV/HCV carriers aged ≥ 40 years [ 98 98 Policies on diagnosis and treatment focused on enhancing the diagnostic and therapeutic capacities of medical institutions and establishing standards for hepatocellular carcinoma. Notably, there was less information regarding health financing in the documents examined. Additionally, palliative care had fewer associated policies, which emphasized patient support and pain relief for those with cancer without specific liver cancer. National programs of liver disease In addition, this study examined liver disease and liver cancer prevention and control programs in China, as detailed in Table 6 111 118 Table 6 National program for prevention and control of liver disease or liver cancer Time Program Name Liver Cancer Control Content Liver Cancer Prevention and Control Related Content 2008–2020 Major Scientific and Technological Program for the Prevention and Control of Major Infectious Diseases, including AIDS and Viral Hepatitis 114 Prevention Viral hepatitis vaccination to reduce hepatitis b prevalence rates 2008–2020 Major Scientific and Technological Program for the Development of New Drugs 117 Diagnosis and treatment Promoting the development of drug discovery systems and enhancing the accessibility and availability of oncology medications 2016 “Demonstration Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Hepatitis B in Pregnancy” 115 Prevention Establishing hepatitis B control demonstration bases to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B 2017 China Quality Liver Disease Medical Resources County Support Initiative 118 Prevention, Diagnosis and treatment Enhancing Liver Disease Diagnosis and Treatment Standards in Medical Institutions 2017–2019 \"Fight Hepatitis B: Green Home—Health Education Program for Chronic Hepatitis B Patients\" 111 Prevention Guide hepatitis B patients and their families to understand and adhere to standardized treatment to improve outcomes and quality of life 2018 China's Clinical Cure Project for Chronic Hepatitis B (Everest project) 112 Prevention Enhancing liver disease diagnosis and treatment standards in medical institutions 2022 China’s Study on Reducing the Incidence of Liver Cancer in Hepatitis B Patients (Oasis project) 113 Prevention, Diagnosis and treatment Improving the treatment of hepatitis b-associated hepatocellular carcinoma 2021 Early Screening for People at Risk of Liver Cancer- the Ganlin Programme 116 Prevention Increasing the level of cancer awareness, consultation rates, and early detection rates of liver cancer among high-risk groups in China In terms of liver cancer prevention, some projects have done a lot of work on the prevention of viral hepatitis. For example, the Green Home Project 111 The Everest Project 112 Oasis Project 113 Major Scientific and Technological Program for the Prevention and Control of Major Infectious Diseases, including AIDS and Viral Hepatitis 114 115 For early detection of liver cancer, the Ganlin Project 116 For treatment of liver cancer, the Major Scientific and Technological Program for the Development of New Drugs, 117 118 Discussion To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide an overview of national-level policies for controlling liver cancer in China. Over the past 40 years, 74 documents on liver cancer policy have been published. The focus has been on prevention and diagnosis and treatment, while there is a lack of documents mentioned about early detection and palliative care for liver cancer control. From the perspectives of health system responses, service delivery, medical products and technologies are the two major areas mentioned in most policy documents. Viral hepatitis prevention forms the cornerstone of China's liver cancer prevention. Since 1984, China has consistently prioritized the control of viral hepatitis and has incorporated the prevention of bacterial and viral infections linked to cancer development into its national cancer program [ 105 119 119 120 121 Global Health Sector Strategies on HIV, viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) 2022–2030 (GHSS) 122 123 124 In the Early detection 125 126 127 128 Especially, the rising non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) related liver cancer in China indicates a new demand for the early detection of liver cancer. It is estimated that about 38% NAFLD or NASH patients will directly progress to liver cancer without liver cirrhosis stage [ 129 130 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 As for the Diagnosis &Treatment 94 141 142 143 144 Notably, the policies also focus on promoting the role of traditional Chinese medicine in cancer treatment in China [ 108 145 106 146 147 148 This study found that national policies for liver cancer control focused on Medical products & Technologies Service delivery Medical Products & Technologies, 115 109 However, the supply of antiviral hepatitis drugs was not ideal. A cross-sectional study showed that the availability of anti-hepatitis B drugs in Jiangsu Province, China was less than 30%, the affordability rate for urban residents was 23%, and the affordability rate for rural residents was 0% [ 149 150 151 152 Besides, for Service delivery 145 Regarding Health financing 153 153 154 154 155 Evaluation of the national cancer control plan and its implementing programs will help improve policy effectiveness. In 2002, the WHO released national cancer control programs, which provided a framework for developing cancer control policies [ 156 14 Furthermore, various tools could be integrated to support development and evaluation of a national liver cancer prevention and control policy. Examples for reference include the National Cancer Control Programs Core Capacity Self-Assessment Tool of WHO [ 157 158 159 160 Limitations This study has several limitations. First, the policy documents included in this study were as of 31 March 2025, and the analysis of the documents for the 14th FYP period is incomplete. Second, data were collected from publicly searchable databases and media sources, so unpublished policies may not have been retrieved. Third, this research policy search only included documents related to “liver”in the search policy documents and did not include national non-communicable diseases and other policies, which was a relatively macro-level analysis. Fourth, this study was limited to policy text analysis and did not quantitatively evaluate the pre- and post-implementation effects of liver cancer policies. Future research and exploration of liver cancer control policies in China should focus on ongoing tracking of policy developments, comparative analysis of implementation outcomes, and the heterogeneity of regional effects. Conclusions This study provides an in-depth analysis of China's national policies for the prevention and control of liver cancer, highlighting a 40-year effort with 74 relevant policy documents focusing more on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment through strengthening service delivery and medical products but less on detection and palliative care. Future efforts should prioritize the development of a holistic national liver cancer strategy based on a dynamic evaluation of the health system. Supplementary Information  Additional file 1.
