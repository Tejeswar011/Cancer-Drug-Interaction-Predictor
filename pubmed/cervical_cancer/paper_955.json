Introduction To overcome the limitations of lifelong hormone replacement therapy for post-operative hypothyroidism, we propose autologous thyroid transplantation into the Cell Pouch™ (CP), an implantable and retrievable medical device that supports vascularization and a homeostatic environment for cell grafting. The CP is currently in clinical trials for islet transplantation in type-1 diabetes, demonstrating its capacity to support long-term graft viability. Here, we apply the CP for thyroid tissue transplantation, leveraging the natural gland’s regulatory capabilities to benefit patients unresponsive to hormone therapy. Building on previous research validating CP’s support for human thyroid grafts in a mouse model, this study evaluates its therapeutic potential in a rat model mimicking clinical thyroidectomy and autologous transplantation. Methods We used 24 Lewis rats to assess the CP’s safety and efficacy. After a five-week post-implantation vascularization period, thyroidectomy was performed in 15 rats, and their glands were transplanted into the CP. A non-transplant group (n=4) underwent thyroidectomy only, and a control group (n=5) received no interventions. Hormone levels (total T3, free T4, TSH) were monitored weekly for 22 weeks. Histology and scintigraphy at endpoint evaluated graft function. Results and Conclusion Rats with thyroid grafts in the CP restored fT4 and T3 to baseline by weeks 4 and 7, respectively. Explantation reversed this effect. Histological analysis showed well-differentiated follicles with minimal inflammation. Scintigraphy confirmed graft viability. No adverse effects were observed in hematological, liver, or kidney parameters. These findings demonstrate that CP-enabled thyroid transplantation restores function post-thyroidectomy and is safely retrievable, with no residual thyroid tissue, marking a significant safety advancement. thyroid transplantation post-surgery hypothyroidism triiodothyronine tetraiodothyronine thyroid stimulating hormone The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Thyroid Endocrinology Introduction Hypothyroidism, characterized by insufficient production of thyroid hormones, is a common outcome following total and near-total thyroidectomies. These surgeries are typically performed to address conditions such as thyroid cancer, goiter, or refractory hyperthyroidism ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 Autologous (auto) transplantation of the healthy portions of the excised thyroid gland has been explored as a potential solution for restoring physiological thyroid function. This concept has been under consideration for over a century ( 7 8 2 9 11 12 19 In response to these challenges, our research investigates a novel approach using a pre-vascularized Cell Pouch device for thyroid tissue transplantation. The Cell Pouch is a subcutaneously implantable, retrievable, and scalable medical device designed to provide a well-vascularized tissue environment for the transplant, thereby promoting graft survival and function ( 20 21 NCT01652911 NCT03513939 Our team previously demonstrated the effectiveness of Cell Pouch in maintaining human thyroid tissue viability and functionality over a three-month period using a euthyroid immunocompromised mouse model ( 22 Materials and methods Animals and study design This study was approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board, McMaster University (AUP # 22-05-18), in accordance with the national guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Twenty-four ( 24  Table 1 Table 1 Animals’ group assignment and specification. Animal Groups Number of rats Cell Pouch™ Implant Thyroidectomy Transplant Group 1 (Thyrox+Tx)* 15 Yes Yes Yes Group 2 (Thyrox) 4 Yes Yes No Group 3 (control) 5 Yes No No *Thyrox, thyroidectomized; Tx, transplanted with autologous thyroid tissue. All rats were implanted with the Cell Pouch device. After 5 weeks, the thyroid glands of animals in groups 1 (Thyrox+Tx) and 2 (Thyrox) were surgically removed. The excised glands were immediately autotransplanted into the vascularized Cell Pouch device in group 1 rats. Group 2 rats did not receive the transplants. Animals in group 3 (Control) were sex- and age-matched, had neither the thyroidectomy nor the transplantation and served as controls for blood hormone levels. As shown in  Figure 1 Figure 1 Overview of the experimental design. Lewis rats (n=24) were assigned to three groups: Group 1 (Thyrox+Tx, n=15) underwent thyroidectomy followed by autotransplantation into a subcutaneously implanted Cell Pouch; Group 2 (Thyrox, n=4) had thyroidectomy without transplantation; Group 3 served as the untreated control (n=5). Thyroid hormone levels were assessed weekly. The Cell Pouch was explanted at specified intervals for necropsy and histology, with thyroid scintigraphy performed at week 25. Flowchart detailing an experiment with Lewis rats divided intothree groups. All rats have a Cell Pouch device implanted subcutaneously. Group 1 (n=15) and Group 2 (n=4) undergo necropsy and histology assessments at different intervals,with Group 1 and one rat from Group 3 undergoing Thyroid Scintigraphy Imaging. Group 3 (n=5) serves as thecontrol, with weekly checks of body weight and serum thyroid hormones. Surgical procedures Cell pouch™ implantation One Single-Channel Mini-Cell Pouch™ device was surgically inserted into the subcutaneous space of the abdominal region in rats five weeks before the total thyroidectomy/transplantation procedure. The pre-implantation period allowed the formation of a vascularized tissue chamber within the device scaffold. The surgical procedure was carried out on isoflurane-anesthetized animals under sterile conditions, involving placing the device into a pre-established subcutaneous pocket, followed by fixation to the underlying rectus abdominus muscle. A representative image of a rat with the Cell Pouch implanted subcutaneously in the abdominal region is shown in  Supplementary Figure 1 Total thyroidectomy and transplantation The rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine hydrochloride (75 mg/kg) and xylazine hydrochloride (6 mg/kg). For thyroidectomy, an 8 cm longitudinal incision into the skin and platysma muscle was made along the cranial-caudal midline of the ventral cervical region. Using a binocular microscope, a blunt dissection was performed to separate the sternocleidomastoid and sternohyoid muscles, exposing the trachea. The pair of parathyroid glands was identified on the cranial lateral pole of each thyroid gland lobe, dissected away from the thyroid gland and implanted into the pocket made in the sternohyoid musculature. The isthmus of the thyroid gland was elevated and incised, while both lobes of the thyroid gland were excised, preserving the laryngeal nerves and vasculature. Thyroid tissues were placed in sterile saline within a petri dish, and the surgical wound was closed with metal staples. For transplantation, the Cell Pouch™ opening zone was accessed through a 1 cm transverse incision in the abdominal skin. The Cell Pouch™ plug was removed, and both excised thyroid lobes, cut into 2mm pieces, were inserted into the empty chamber of the device. The opening of the Cell Pouch™ was then sutured closed, as well as the skin incision. Animals were given post-operative analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.02 mg/kg and carprofen, 5 mg/kg, both subcutaneous) and recovered. Thyroid hormones, hematology, and biochemistry measurements In accordance with the approved Animal Use Protocol, we collected 0.7 mL of blood from the tail artery every week for 22 weeks, starting one week prior to total thyroidectomy and transplantation. Isolated sera were stored at -80°C until they were used for the in-house measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (fT4) and total triiodothyronine (T3) levels. Rat TSH ELISA kit (ALPCO, Cat # 55-TSHRT-E01) with an analytical measuring range of 0.1 to 80 ng/mL, rat fT4 competitive ELISA kit (Antibodies-Online, Cat # ABIN6966896) with an analytical measuring range of 1.563 to 100 pg/mL and rat T3 competitive ELISA kit (Antibodies-Online, Cat # ABIN6970859) with an analytical measuring range of 0.156 to 10 ng/mL were used. Serum samples were also shipped to Antech ® ® Scintigraphy imaging Imaging was performed for representative rats 25 weeks post-thyroidectomy and transplantation in the STTARR Facility, University Health Network, Toronto. Rats were injected intravenously with 0.5 mCi of 99m ® Histopathology At 20 weeks post-transplantation, the Cell Pouch™ devices were explanted from the animals in survival surgeries, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated and embedded in paraffin blocks. Five-micron-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Sequential sections were used for immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical staining to detect the following markers: TG (anti-thyroglobulin antibody, AbCam, Cat # ab156008, 1/100 dilution), thyroid peroxidase (TPO, anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody, AbCam, Cat #ab278525, 1/100 dilution), von-Willebrand Factor (vWF, anti-WF, DAKO Agilent, Cat #A008202-2, 1/1400 dilution), and Ki67 (anti-Ki67 antibody, AbCam, Cat #ab16667, 1/50 dilution). The Click-iT™ Plus TUNEL Assay Kit for In Situ C10619 Statistical analysis The average fold change of the thyroid hormone levels was compared to the animal’s pre-transplant (baseline) levels. A Mann-Whitney non-parametric U-test was used to compare hormone levels between the control and transplanted animals at the 20-week post-transplant timepoint. The non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test was used to compare serum hematological and biochemical values between the baseline and 20 weeks post-transplantation. p<0.05 Results Kinetics of thyroid hormones in thyroidectomized and transplanted animals Serum thyroid hormone levels were assessed at two initial time points (baseline), i.e  Figure 1  Figure 2A  Figure 2B Figure 2 Thyroid hormone profiles Over Time and at Endpoint.

The right panel bar graphs compare Control and Thyrox + Tx groups at week 20 post-thyroidectomy, showing a significant TSH increase but no significant difference in fT4 and T3 levels. Histopathological evaluation of thyroid transplants At weeks 9 and 20 post-transplantation, Cell Pouch devices retrieved from the Thyrox+Tx rats, along with thyroid glands harvested with the trachea of naïve control rats, were histologically assessed and compared (  Figure 3  Figures 3A–C  Figures 3B-b1  Figures 3B-c1 C-a4  Figures 3B-c2, C-a5  Figures 3C-b1 Figure 3 Histological and immunohistochemical analysis of native and transplanted thyroid tissue.

Panels include H&E, DAPI with TG and TPO, and markers for cell apoptosis and proliferation (Ki67). The sections have labels and scale bars for size reference, demonstrating different structures and staining patterns, with some panels including negative controls. Scintigraphy findings Scintigraphy assessments were conducted 25 weeks after thyroidectomy and transplantation procedures on a subset of four randomly selected rats (refer to  Figure 1  Figure 4  Table 2 99m 4 Figure 4 Whole-body scintigraphy comparing isotope uptake. The control shows typical thyroid uptake (red arrow) and no uptake in the Cell Pouch (device only, white arrow) implant site. In Thyrox+Tx subjects, reduced or absent uptake in the thyroid bed indicates total thyroidectomy or residual lobe function, respectively. Significant uptake in the Cell Pouch area (white arrows) is evident, which ceases after the pouch’s removal (explant), signifying the graft’s confinement to the device. “X” and “Y” mark the epigastric and bladder, known for high technetium uptake, respectively.

Hematological and biochemical safety analysis To assess the safety profile of our proposed strategy, we performed a comprehensive evaluation on all subjects in group 1 (Thyrox+Tx, n=15). This included a detailed analysis of hematological and serum biochemical parameters, such as complete blood cell counts, hemoglobin levels, and liver and kidney function tests. Baseline measurements were established one week before the initiation of Thyrox+Tx, with follow-up assessments conducted at the conclusion of the study, 20 weeks post-treatment. Serum calcium levels were checked at baseline and one week post-thyroidectomy as an indicator of the function of reimplanted parathyroid glands. Our analysis revealed no statistically significant changes in the hematological parameters, calcium levels, and liver function tests (including bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and alanine transaminase) from baseline to study end. However, we observed a notable but non-pathological increase in the serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, although these values remained within normal limits (  Supplementary Figure 2 Discussion People treated for endocrine deficiencies, including hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, and diabetes mellitus, currently rely on daily replacement therapies. These treatments, however, are inherently limited due to the absence of a natural autoregulatory system, often leading to suboptimal outcomes and discord between the therapy and the patient’s real-time physiological needs. Moreover, factors such as complex dosing schedules, side effects, and the challenges of daily life integration can diminish patient compliance, undermining the therapy’s effectiveness. This highlights the urgent need for innovative cell therapy approaches ( 23 Daily L-T4 therapy is a widely available and low-cost standard of care for patients with hypothyroidism (including post-thyroidectomy). Despite this, up to 10% of these patients report persistent clinical symptoms ( 24 25 26 6 26 27 28 29 29 The growing voice of patient advocacy groups, found through simple internet searches, highlights the widespread recognition and concern over this issue within the hypothyroid community. These groups advocate for greater attention to the qualitative aspects of hypothyroidism treatment, emphasizing that the current metrics of success, primarily based on normalizing TSH hormone levels, may not adequately capture the full spectrum of patient well-being and quality of life. Adding to the complexity, some patients who continue to experience hypothyroid symptoms while on L-T4 report symptom improvement when switched to desiccated thyroid extract (DTE), a traditional treatment derived from pig thyroid glands ( 30 31 versus 8 22  Figure 4 32 In the current study, we aimed to perform total thyroidectomies for a better evaluation of the thyroid autograft without the possible interference of thyroid remnants. However, it was observed that 5 out of the 15 rats that underwent thyroidectomy (approximately 33%) retained thyroid tissue remnants, evidenced by scintigraphy imaging (  Figure 4  Table 2 33 Our results showed that restoration of fT4 and T3 was accompanied by a remarkable decrease in TSH levels, indicating the activation of the thyroid-pituitary axis’s negative feedback mechanism. Nevertheless, in euthyroid animals, TSH levels remained somewhat elevated throughout the 20-week duration of the study, as depicted in  Figure 2 16 17 34 35 Advances in stem cell biology and the differentiation of stem cells into endocrine cells, including functional thyrocytes ( 36 In summary, our study provides compelling evidence that thyroid autotransplantation into the Cell Pouch device following thyroidectomy is effective in restoring thyroid hormone levels. These findings justify further exploration of this concept in clinical trials. Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Drs.
