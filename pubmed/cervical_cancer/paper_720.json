Introduction Acute leukemia (AL) is the most common malignancy in children [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Patients This single-center retrospective study reviewed the medical records of patients admitted to the Department of Pediatrics at National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) between January 2011 and December 2015. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the NCGM (approval number: NCGM-G-002526-00) and was conducted in accordance with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was not required, as only fully anonymized data were used. An information leaflet was posted in the hospital to inform patients and their guardians about the general use of clinical data for research purposes. We selected a total of 67 patients under the age of 18 who underwent FDG-PET/CT in the study period. A total of 28 patients (6 AL and 22 ID individuals) out of 67 were considered eligible for the analysis after the exclusion of cases presenting the following: (1) pediatric cancers without AL ( n n n 2.2. FDG PET/CT Scanning FDG-PET/CT images were obtained using Biograph mCT (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) and Discovery PET/CT 600 (General Electric Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). The patients were instructed to fast for at least six hours, and the blood glucose level was monitored using a glucometer (Asetsense Duo, HORIBA MEDICAL, Kyoto, Japan) prior to injection. Approximately 60 min after the intravenous injection of 18F-FDG according to the guideline [ 10 2.3. Evaluation of FDG-PET/CT Imaging The evaluation of FDG-PET/CT imaging, based on maximum intensity projection (MIP) images, was performed in 11 body areas per patient (i.e., vertebrae, pelvic bone, humerus (proximal, mid, and distal), forearm (proximal, mid, and distal), and femur (proximal, mid, and distal)). We measured the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV max) in the bone marrow of the 11 areas in order to make a quantitative comparison between the two groups. We also evaluated the visual score (VS), which classifies the degree of FDG accumulation compared with the liver into 4 grades (0: no accumulation; 1: lower accumulation; 2: equivalent accumulation; 3: greater accumulation) ( Figure 1 Figure 1 11 2.4. Statistics PASS 11 was used for determining the power of the study based on the sample size. The power was 0.85, assuming a level of significance of 0.05; the logarithms of the VS and odds ratio were 0.5, and we considered 6 cases and 22 controls. R version 4.2.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria) and Python 3.10 (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA) were used for statistical analyses. We compared the blood tests and the data (SUV max, VS, and SS) for each bone marrow area between the AL and ID groups by using the Mann–Whitney U-test. All p p 3. Results The clinical characteristics of the blood tests between the AL and ID groups are shown in Table 1 Table S1 MIP images of all 28 patients—6 with AL and 22 with ID—are presented for evaluation in Figure 2 Figure 3 Table S2 Figure 4 Figure 5 Table S3 Figure 6 4. Discussion In this study, we demonstrated that our scoring system based on FDG-PET/CT findings is useful in differentiating AL from IDs in children. We found that the SUV max, the VS, and the SS were significantly higher in the bone marrow of patients with AL compared with those with IDs, despite the presence of inflammation according to blood tests. Notably, the VS in the mid-diaphyseal region of the extremities was particularly useful in distinguishing AL from IDs. These results suggest that increased FDG uptake in the mid-portions of the humerus and the femur, along with widespread bone marrow involvement, represents a characteristic FDG-PET/CT finding in pediatric acute leukemia. Our study also showed clear differences in bone marrow FDG uptake between the AL and ID groups on PET/CT. It is well known that high FDG accumulation in bone marrow in AL reflects increased number and metabolic activity of leukemic cells [ 5 7 8 9 We further demonstrated that FDG-PET/CT in pediatric AL reveals both high intensity and wide distribution of FDG uptake in bone marrow, as evaluated using the VS and the SS. In all 11 defined bone marrow regions per patient, the SUV max, the VS, and the SS were consistently higher in the AL group than in the ID group. The authors of previous studies have reported high FDG uptake in the vertebrae, pelvic bones, and other skeletal sites in AL and have suggested that AL should be considered in the differential diagnosis when diffuse marrow uptake is present [ 5 11 12 13 14 Our findings are consistent with those reported by Zhang et al., who analyzed FDG-PET/CT in 134 adult patients with diffusely increased bone marrow uptake. They found that intense FDG accumulation in the humerus and femur was significantly associated with bone marrow malignant infiltration (BMI) and identified humeral uptake over two-thirds and a high femoral SUV max as independent predictors of malignancy, obtaining an AUC of 0.918 when combining these metrics with age and neutrophil count [ 15 Our study also showed that FDG accumulation in the proximal and distal parts of the extremities tended to be higher than in the mid-portions in both groups. We speculate that this result may reflect physiological FDG accumulation in red marrow and growth plate cartilage. Previous studies have shown physiological FDG uptake in bone marrow and related structures on PET/CT [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 We developed a scoring system for differentiating AL from IDs based on FDG-PET/CT findings. Among the evaluated metrics—SUV max, VS, and the combination VS + SS—the latter showed the highest diagnostic performance according to ROC analysis, with a cutoff of 20, a sensitivity of 1.00, a specificity of 0.91, and an AUC of 0.985. We also evaluated a simplified version using the VS of the mid-diaphysis of humerus and femur combined with the SS, which achieved better diagnostic performance (cutoff, 4; sensitivity, 1.00; specificity, 1.00; AUC, 1.00). These results indicate that the simplified model may offer a practical alternative for clinical use. To our knowledge, no authors have previously used visual assessment alone to differentiate AL from IDs in pediatric patients. Our visual scoring system offers a simple, re-producible, and pediatric-specific tool that may help clinicians diagnose pediatric AL more accurately and noninvasively. This study has several limitations. First, it was retrospective in design, with an inherent risk of selection bias and incomplete data. Second, the control group included children with infectious diseases rather than healthy individuals; however, performing FDG-PET/CT in healthy children without clinical indication is ethically unacceptable. Inflammatory or autoimmune diseases have also been shown to elevate bone marrow FDG uptake [ 7 8 9 14 5. Conclusions FDG-PET/CT in children with AL demonstrated high FDG accumulation in bone marrow across the body. A simple scoring system assessing FDG uptake in the mid-diaphyseal regions of the extremities and the extent of bone marrow involvement proved as useful in distinguishing AL from IDs as using the SUV max. FDG-PET/CT-based visual scoring may provide supportive information alongside conventional diagnostics in pediatric acute leukemia.
