Although mycoplasmas are generally identified as commensals, their contributions to gynecological cancers, mainly CC, is increasingly recognized. This study investigates the association between CC and genital mycoplasma infections, highlighting the interactions with human papillomavirus (HPV) and their impact on cellular and immune mechanisms. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of databases through June 2024. Association strength was determined using pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Six case-control studies involving 319 cervical cancer patients and 447 controls were included. Results Pooled results showed that genital mycoplasmas were associated with a significantly increased risk of CC (OR = 1.64; 95% CI 1.25–2.14).

This is particularly seen in gynecological malignancies including cervical, ovarian, and endometrial cancers [ 15 22 23 24 22 25 26 27 It is well established that genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, including multiple sexual partners, smoking, obesity, high parity, menopausal status, and co-infection with other STIs, increase the risk of CC development [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 Growing evidence suggests that HPV-affected cervical epithelium may become more susceptible to mycoplasma infections, or mycoplasma-infected epithelial cells may become more susceptible to infection with HR-HPV types, leading to high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and CC [ 28 36 Understanding the role of genital mycoplasmas in cervical cancer development is critical for advancing prevention strategies and therapeutic interventions. Based on the biological plausibility of Mycoplasma-HPV synergy and the clinical need to identify modifying and contributing cofactors, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluate the association between genital Mycoplasma infections and susceptibility to cervical cancer. Methodology Literature search approach for the study A thorough literature review was conducted to explore studies investigating the relationship between genital mycoplasmas and CC, with a focus on cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control study designs. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We searched various electronic databases, including Embase, Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, covering their inception through June 2024 (Fig. 1 Mycoplasma Ureaplasma Ureaplasma urealyticum M. hominis M. penetrans M. genitalium Ureaplasma parvum Fig. 1 PRISMA flow chart with identification, screening and inclusion of study selection process Systematic study selection and data extraction Two independent reviewers evaluated titles and abstracts using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The studies were eligible if they were original, peer-reviewed research articles published in English and examined the relationship between genital mycoplasmas and gynecological cancers. Acceptable study designs included cross-sectional, cohort, or case-control formats. Studies were excluded if they involved animal research, genomic analyses, in vitro experiments, conference proceedings, guidelines from professional societies, letters to the editor, editorials, or if they did not provide adequate data to evaluate the associations of interest. Any reviewer disagreements were resolved through consensus or by consulting a third researcher. The final selection process is illustrated in a PRISMA flow diagram. Data synthesis and statistical analysis Data from relevant studies included the primary author’s name, year of publication, country of study, sample size, cancer type investigated, details on genital mycoplasma infections, and the documented frequencies and associations reported. The quality of these studies was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal guidelines [ 37 Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.4.1 and RStudio version 2023.09.01. The associations between M. genitalium M. hominis U. parvum U. urealyticum P Assessment of journal quality The credibility of the included studies was assessed comprehensively through a review of publication venues, utilizing the most recent Journal Citation Reports (JCR) impact factors and quartile classifications (Q1-Q4). Journals were categorized based on their standing within relevant disciplines (Microbiology, Oncology, Gynecology & Obstetrics). Studies published in journals without JCR metrics were evaluated using alternative indexing criteria, including Scopus CiteScore and journal database indexing criteria to establish academic standing. Results Study selection and characteristics A total of 1390 records were identified through database searches. After the abstract screening, we excluded 1365 records due to irrelevant content. After duplicate removal and screening, 12 primarily case-control and cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria for qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis and were thus included. These studies investigated the association of various genital mycoplasma species with CC. The specimens used to detect Mycoplasma varied, and both PCR and culture-based assays were used (Table 1 n n n n n 1 Table 1 Summary of eligible studies included in the meta-analysis Study Country Mycoplasma assay Case/control Species Myco only OR (95%CI) Myco + + OR * Disi (2023) 1 China RT PCR 1175/NA Uu 61 NA 42 1.28 [0.73–2.26] Up 355 239 1.81 [1.21–2.70] Mg 4 4 NA Mh 17 10 0.67 [0.24–1.85] Tantengco (2022) 2 Philippine RT PCR 28/16 U 7 1.53 [0.26–8.93] 5 NS M. 3 NA 3 Klein (2020) 1 Tanzania PCR 16 s metagenomic sequencing 1060/NA U 545 NA 262 NA Mg 24 210 Mh 360 10 2.1[NC] Alotaibi (2020) 1 Saudi Arabia PCR 55/NA U. 7 NA NA NA NA Mh 2 Jary (2021) 1 Mali RT-PCR 144/NA Uu 144 NA 36 NA Up 144 57 Mg 144 11 Mh 144 33 Adamopoulou (2021) 2 Greece PCR and culture 62/120 U 27 3.25[1.66–6.38] 22 NS NA Mh 35 17.6 [2.76 −110.64] 6 Amorim (2017) 2 Brazil QPCR 62/70 Uu 8 1.47[0.36–5.98] NS NA NA Up 49 Katarzyna (2015) 1 Poland PCR 130/NA U 26 NA NA NA NA Mh 5 Xiaolei (2013) 2 China FQ-PCR 113/120 Uu 71 2.211[NC] 109 NA Rodrigues (2011) 1 Brazil PCR 50/NA U 10 NA NA NA NA NA Mg 1 Mh 7 Biernat-Sudolska (2011) 2 Poland PCR and culture 49/82 Uu 5 NA 1 NA Up 5 1 Mg 0 0 Mh 0 0 Ekiel (2009) 2 Poland PCR and culture 5/39 Up 2 NA 7 NA Uu 0 1 Myco Mycoplasma, HPV OR OR* 95%CI NA NS NC M spp Mycoplasma U spp Ureaplasma Up Ureaplasma parvum, Uu Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mh Mycoplasma hominis, MgMycoplasma genitalium 1 2 Cervical Cancer risk The pooled analysis demonstrated that genital mycoplasma infections were significantly associated with an increased risk of CC (OR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.42–2.14; P 1 2 M. hominis 13 16 21 38 42 M. genitalium 16 40 41 43 Mycoplasma 44 Assessment of study heterogeneity Heterogeneity assessment revealed differential patterns across our analytical approaches.

This study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between genital mycoplasma infections and CC susceptibility, thereby providing insights into the pathogenic role of these microorganisms in cervical carcinogenesis. It is worth noting that our findings reveal statistical associations rather than causal relationships. The cross-sectional and case-control study designs of the included studies limit our ability to determine whether Mycoplasma infections precede and thus contribute to CC development, or they represent opportunistic infections in already compromised cervical tissue. Our findings demonstrate a significant statistical association between genital mycoplasmas, particularly Ureaplasmas U. urealyticum U. parvum The pooled analysis revealed that women infected with genital mycoplasmas had a higher risk of developing CC compared to controls (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.42–2.14). Notably, U. urealyticum U. urealyticum 16 49 50 51 U. parvum ureaplasma Mycoplasma 16 49 50 A significant differential cervical bacterium between women with normal cervical cytology and those with pre-cancerous lesions has been reported for Tanzanian women, with a high M. genitalium 21 M. hominis Ureaplasma 52 54 M. hominis The exact mechanisms by which mycoplasmas influence cervical cancer development remain unclear. However, chronic infections from synergistic mycoplasma-HPV interactions appear critical for cervical cancer pathogenesis [ 38 51 55 56 57 51 58 59 60 Recent metagenomic investigations have confirmed the complex interplay between cervical microbiome composition and the development of cancer. Utilizing advanced sequencing methodologies, large-scale studies demonstrated that CC patients display unique microbiome profiles, associated with increased microbial diversity in select microbial populations, specifically enriched anaerobic bacteria and mycoplasmas [ 61 62 63 Given the moderate heterogeneity among the included studies, our suggestion that mycoplasma-HPV co-infection is more frequent among CC cases should be interpreted cautiously. The subgroup analyses also identified heterogeneity, particularly for U. parvum 26 27 U. urealyticum U. parvum By exploring the abnormal cervical cytology, it was shown that individuals with a U. urealyticum 16 64 M. genitalium 58 U. parvum 51 55 Mechanistically, mycoplasma infection may enhance CC by creating an environment conducive to HPV persistence, providing optimal conditions for infecting epithelial cells in the face of disrupted cellular repair mechanisms and immune surveillance. Mycoplasma infection has also been shown to compromise the cellular mucosal barrier [ 65 38 51 66 U. urealyticum M. hominis. U. urealyticum M. hominis In conclusion, this study further confirms that genital mycoplasma infections, in particular, U. urealyticum U. parvum Conclusion Women with CC had significantly higher odds of genital mycoplasma colonization, which supports the hypothesis that these infections are associated with increased cervical cancer risk, though causality cannot be established from observational data. Our findings suggest that screening for Mycoplasma infections in high-risk populations may be warranted, though clinical recommendations must await prospective studies demonstrating that Mycoplasma treatment reduces cervical cancer incidence. Future studies should focus on prospective cohort studies to establish temporal relationships, mechanistic studies to assess biological causation, and prospective trials aimed at determining if Mycoplasma treatment reduces cervical cancer risk.
