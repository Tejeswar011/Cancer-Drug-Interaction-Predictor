Defects in ENS development could lead to a broad range of disorders, including Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR), which is characterized by missing nerve cells in the distal segment of the colon. Here, we identify EMB Methods We first examined EMB expression in human and mouse intestines using scRNA-seq data and immunofluorescence staining. To investigate its role in ENS development, we constructed Emb EMB Results In zebrafish, loss of emb Emb emb EMB Conclusions EMB is required for ENS development by regulating the proliferation and migration of the ENCCs. Mechanistically, EMB recruits PP2A to the cell membrane, reducing cytoplasmic dephosphorylation activity and promoting the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway.

All procedures were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal guardians. Experiments involving zebrafish and mice were approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of Huazhong Agricultural University (Ethical approval number: HZAUMO-2017-048). The key techniques and animals used in this manuscript were summarized below. Mouse husbandry and euthanasia All mice used in this study were maintained under Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) conditions within a controlled environment facility. Standard husbandry conditions included a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C, relative humidity of 50-60%, and a 12-h light/dark cycle. Animals had ad libitum access to standard laboratory rodent chow and water, and their health was monitored daily throughout the study period. Euthanasia was performed using ethically approved methods: mice were first rendered unconscious by carbon dioxide (CO₂) inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation to ensure death. All procedures were conducted in strict accordance with institutional policies and national regulations governing the ethical use of laboratory animals. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence of human and mouse colon Colon tissues were obtained from children without gastrointestinal diseases due to traffic accidents. For immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded colon tissues were sectioned at 5 μm and baked at 60 °C for 24 h. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene, rehydrated through graded ethanol (100%-70%), and subjected to antigen retrieval with citrate buffer (1 ×, G1202, Servicebio, China), followed by treatment with 3% H 2 2 For immunofluorescence in both human and mouse tissues, colon sections from E13.5d mouse embryos and the aforementioned pediatric samples were prepared. The primary antibodies used were EMB (ab127692, Abcam, UK) and Tuj1 (ab78078, Abcam, UK). The corresponding secondary antibody combinations included either Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 647) (ab150075, Abcam, UK) with Goat Anti-Mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 488) (ab150113, Abcam, UK), or Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 488) (ab150077, Abcam, UK) with Goat Anti-Mouse IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor® 647) (ab150115, Abcam, UK), in order to visualize EMB expression in neurons. Single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets and analysis In our exploration of the functional roles of EMB https://simmonslab.shinyapps.io/FetalAtlasDataPortal/ 41 43 EMB 44 Zebrafish housing/breeding The AB-strain zebrafish were maintained according to standard procedures. Embryos and larvae were raised in E3 medium at 28 ℃ in an illuminated incubator within a 14:10 light/dark cycle. 0.003% N-phenylthiourea was added to E3 medium to inhibit melanization. Maintenance of adult zebrafish was performed in a recirculating system at 28 °C. Morpholino knockdown of emb ret Morpholino knockdown of emb ret 45 (splice blocker) ret ret (translation blocker) emb emb The maximum dose of each MO that produced no apparent malformations was selected for injection at the one-cell stage of zebrafish embryos. Embryos were injected with 5 ng MO, and knockdown efficiency was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot, as detailed in the supplementary materials. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing in zebrafish To generate emb 46 emb emb + / emb +/- emb -/- 46 Whole-mount in situ hybridization Zebrafish embryos were collected and processed for whole-mount ISH as previously described [ 47 crestin Forward: 5’- GAGAAGCCCTCATCAGAGAGTTTG -3’, Reverse: 5’- TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGTTGCTTGTCAGGCAGAATCAGG -3’. A T7 promoter was added to the reverse primer. The ISH probe was then generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. Whole-mount immunofluorescence staining in zebrafish Whole-mount immunofluorescent staining was performed using the anti-HuC/D antibody (A-21271, Invitrogen, USA) or anti-p-Histone H3 antibody (9701S, Cell Signaling Technology, USA). Embryos were fixed overnight in 4% PFA and rinsed three times with PBS. Following a 1 h block at room temperature in 2% goat serum and 2 mg/mL BSA (in PBS), samples were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After two 10 min washes in PBS, embryos were treated with secondary antibodies (Goat anti-Mouse IgG Alexa Fluor™ 488, A-11001, Invitrogen; or Goat anti-Rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor™ 555, A-21428, Invitrogen; 1:1000 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Confocal images were acquired using an LSM 800 microscope (Zeiss, Germany), and fluorescence intensity or labeled cell counts were quantified with ImageJ (v1.8.0). Zebrafish intestinal transit assay As reported previously [ 48 F13081 E10521 48 50 RNA sequencing of the zebrafish larval intestine For intestinal tissue isolation, 5 dpf zebrafish larvae were anesthetized in 200 mg/L tricaine ( E10521 51 2 p 52 53 PI3K/AKT agonist PI3K agonist 740-Y-P (HY-P0175, MedChemExpress, USA) and AKT agonist SC79 (HY-18749, MedChemExpress, USA) were used to activate the PI3K signaling cascade. For zebrafish exposure, drug concentrations for 740-Y-P (5 μg/mL) and SC79 (1 μg/mL) were chosen as the maximal concentrations at which no obvious malformations or mortality were observed in zebrafish embryos after incubation. The embryos were then incubated with the presence of 740-Y-P or SC79 until 5 dpf. For N-2a cells, the agonists were added to the culture medium (740-Y-P, 30 μM and SC79, 0.4 μg/mL).

The sequencing primer sequence was Emb Emb +/- Emb +/+ Emb -/- Immunofluorescence staining of embryonic mouse colon Whole embryos at E12.5, E14.5, and E16.5 were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin and sectioned for staining. Immunofluorescence staining of the sections were performed as previously described to track the development of ENS by using Tuj1 (ab78078, Abcam, UK). Colons from neonatal mice at 1, 2, or 6 weeks of age were dissected, rolled, and processed through fixation, embedding, and sectioning. Antibody Tuj1 (ab78078, Abcam, UK) was used to label enteric neurons. Embryonic gut tissues were isolated from the hindgut of E13.5d mouse. At this developmental stage, ENCCs migrate between the cecal region and the distal end of the hindgut [ 17 NTR 17 54 55 21 56 RNA sequencing in dissociated ENCCs E14.5d fetal guts were dissected out and the ENCCs were isolated [ 57 17 58 59 2 p 52 53 BrdU assay of ENCCs Newborn mice at the day 2 were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU (B5002, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in the amount of 50 μg/g. After 2 h of incubation, 0.5 cm colon tissue (0.5 cm from the anus) was harvested, fixed in 10% formalin for 24 h, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections were prepared, and BrdU detection and immunofluorescence staining were then performed on cross-sections using an anti-BrdU antibody (66,241-1-lg, Proteintech, USA) and the secondary antibody CoraLite594-conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse lgG(H + L) (SA00013-3, Proteintech, USA).

A total of 200 μL of a single-cell suspension (1 × 10 5 ENCC migration assay in explant guts For the in vitro ENCC migration assay, E11.5d mouse guts from stomach to ileocecal junction were dissected and placed on a culture dish coated with 2.5% low melting agarose gel. Cutting end at the cecum was transferred to the 0.45 μm filter membrane (MCE, USA; Millipore, USA), and the proximal end was secured to the agarose bed with needles. The explant was maintained in culture with DMEM/F-12, 10% FBS, antibiotics and 100 ng/mL GDNF [ 60 Time lapse imaging of ENCC migration in vivo For time lapse imaging, the Sox10-tdTomato + 17 61 Emb 62 63 Cultivation of intestinal epithelial organoids (IEOs) and intestinal mesenchymal cells (IMCs) Mice aged from E13.5d to E18.5d were prepared for the cultivation of IEOs and IMCs. The first 30% of the proximal portion of small intestine were isolated. The digestion solution for IEOs is Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent (100-0485, STEMCELL, Canada); the culture medium for IEOs is prepared as follows: Advanced DMEM/F12 (12,634,010, Gibco, USA), Glutamax (1 × , 35,050,061, Gibco, USA), Hepes (0.01 M, 15,630,080, Gibco, USA), Pen/Strep (0.2 U/mL, 15,140,122, Gibco, USA), N2 supplement (1 × , 17,502,048, Gibco, USA), B27 supplement (1 × , 17,504,044, Gibco, USA), N-acetylcysteine (1.25 mM, 38,520-57-9, Sigma, USA), EGF (0.05 µg/mL, AF-100-15, PeproTech, USA), R-spondin1 (500 ng/mL, 315-32-20UG, Peprotech, USA) and Noggin (100 ng/mL, 250-38-20UG, Peprotech, USA). After digestion, resuspend the cells in Matrigel. Once the Matrigel has solidified, add the culture medium for IEOs. Subsequently, incubate the plate at 37 °C for cultivation in a cell incubator. Replace the culture medium for IEOs every 2 days and continue cultivation until day 6 for subsequent experiments [ 64 To cultivate IMCs, the remaining 70% segment of small intestine and colon tissue was utilized. This tissue was placed in a dish with IMC digestion solution containing Dispase II (2 mg/mL, D4693, Sigma, USA), collagenase IV (0.5 mg/mL, 40510ES60, Yeasen, China), DNase I (5 mg/mL, D4527-10KU, Sigma, USA) and DMEM basic culture medium (8,122,483, Gibco, USA). Tissue was digested in a 37 °C incubator with gentle pipetting every 8 min, repeated 2-3 times. Subsequently, the obtained cells were resuspended in DMEM medium and cultured. After 24 h, non-adherent cells were removed, leaving behind adherent cells with a fibroblast-like appearance. Cultivation continued until day 6 [ 65 Co-culture of fetal mouse IEOs, IMCs, and ENCCs To prepare the induction medium, retinoic acid (302-79-4, 2 μM, MedChemExpress, USA) was added to the IEO culture medium [ 66 Immunofluorescence staining of IEOs and IMCs Utilizing the Four-color multiple immunofluorescence Kit (RC0086-34RM, Recordbio Biological Technology, China), which operates on tyramide signal amplification (TSA) technology, following the manufacturer’s instructions.

Whole-mount staining of N-2a and 293T cells Cells grown on coverslips (N-2a and 293T) were collected. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using anti-EMB (ab127692, Abcam, UK) and anti-PPP2CA (A6702, abclonal, USA) to examine the colocalization of EMB and PPP2CA. Colocalization was quantified using ImageJ software (ver.1.8.0) [ 67 HSCR cohort and sample collection Patients with HSCR and healthy controls were recruited from Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology. The discovery cohort consisted of 107 unrelated HSCR patients and 120 ethnically matched healthy controls without a personal or family history of HSCR or other congenital intestinal diseases. The replication cohort included an additional 107 unrelated HSCR patients, with population-level controls derived from the gnomAD East Asian (gnomAD-EAS) database (n = 8,624). For combined analyses, a total of 214 HSCR patients were compared against both the 120 local healthy controls and the gnomAD-EAS dataset. Inclusion criteria were: (1) patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for HSCR, confirmed by postoperative pathological examination showing the absence of enteric ganglion cells; (2) no confirmed cases of HSCR in the patient’s direct or collateral relatives. Exclusion criteria included cases with incomplete or unclear clinical information. Clinical details, including sex, HSCR subtype, and associated congenital malformations, were systematically recorded (Additional file 1: Dataset S3) [ 49 46 Identify rare variants of EMB For Sanger sequencing, primers targeting all nine exons of EMB EMB 68 69 68 EMB 70 Statistics All statistical data presented in bar graphs are shown as mean ± s.e.m.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the ENS development have not been fully understood. Here, in an effort to screen for novel genes involved in ENS development, we identified EMB EMB EMB EMB Embigin plays a critical role in embryonic development. Talvi et al. reported that embigin is highly expressed in the developing gut at E8.5d and E13.5d, indicating its involvement in early gastrointestinal development [ 40 EMB + / EMB + /- EMB -/- 40 It has been well established that the GDNF/RET signaling is critical for many aspects of the ENS development, including the proliferation, maturation, migration and survival of the ENCCs [ 8 74 75 Emb Emb Emb 36 37 76 PP2A is an essential and ubiquitously expressed serine threonine phosphatase, which regulates many critical cellular processes by dephosphorylating its targets, including the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade [ 77 Emb 78 The identification of significantly enriched rare EMB variants in HSCR patients, particularly the functional impairment demonstrated for variants like c.877 + 2 T > G, R238S, S93C, and A12V in the rescue assays, provides compelling evidence that EMB is a susceptibility gene for HSCR. However, several aspects warrant careful consideration. The effect size appears modest, with variants found in a small subset of patients (primarily S-HSCR in the discovery cohort), and the near absence of variants in controls suggests low population frequency but not necessarily high penetrance. This pattern positions EMB rare variants likely as low-to-moderate penetrance risk factors within the complex polygenic landscape of HSCR, rather than highly penetrant Mendelian causes like RET. The restriction of identified variants to S-HSCR patients in the discovery cohort, while requiring validation in larger studies, might suggest EMB dysfunction predisposes to less extensive aganglionosis. Future investigations should explore potential oligogenic interactions between EMB variants and mutations in established HSCR genes (e.g., RET, EDNRB) and assess their impact in larger, diverse patient cohorts, including those with L-HSCR and TCA. Conclusions In summary, we show that EMB is involved in ENS development by regulating the proliferation and migration of ENCCs. Mechanistically, EMB recruits PP2A to the cell membrane, thereby reducing the dephosphorylation activity in the cytoplasm, promoting the activation of PI3K signaling pathway.
