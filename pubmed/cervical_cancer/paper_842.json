Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) remains crucial in the preoperative diagnosis of thyroid nodules ( 10 11 12 13 Determining the malignancy of thyroid nodules is becoming increasingly dependent on molecular pathological techniques ( 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 DNA methylation catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) is one of the important epigenetic modifications controlling gene expression and maintaining genome structure. Alterations of DNA methylation are early molecular changes in human cancers and play an important role in tumorigenesis. As has been reported, the DNA methylation biomarkers offer early detection capability as epigenetic changes precede histopathological alterations, high specificity for tumor subtyping, and increasingly cost-effective analysis with standardized protocols ( 23 24 25 26 To establish reliable methylation signatures overcoming FNAB’s technical barriers, this study utilized surgically resected FFPE tissues, which provide both definitive histopathological classification and sufficient DNA for the development of robust biomarkers. Here, we intended to discover and validate the abnormal DNA methylation alterations in TC compared to BTN in the Chinese population. Combining the genome-wide screening assay of Methylation 850K BeadChip array and RNA-Sequencing, we discovered TC associated differential methylation in the FABP3 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study design and population The studies were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Nanjing Medical University. Informed consent was obtained from each recruited participant. In the discovery study, we collected 32 fresh-frozen tissue samples from 17 BTN subjects and 15 TC cases at the Affiliated Huai’an Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University from 2019 to 2020. Two independent studies were conducted on 890 FFPE tissue samples for validation. Validation Ⅰ: 222 TC patients and 221 age- and gender-matched BTN subjects were collected from the Affiliated Huai’an Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University and the Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine from 2013 to 2023. In the BTN group, 78.70% (174/221) were female, with a median (interquartile range, IQR) age of 53.00 (45.50 - 60.00) years; while in the TC group, 72.10% (160/222) were female, with a median (IQR) age of 50.00 (41.75 - 58.00) years. Validation Ⅱ: a total of 256 TC cases and 191 age- and gender-matched BTN subjects were collected from the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University from 2017 to 2022. The median (IQR) age of BTN subjects and TC cases was 49.00 (35.00 - 55.00) and 50.00 (38.00 - 57.00) years old, and the proportions of females were 77.50% (148/191) and 77.30% (198/256), respectively.

In the discovery study and two independent validations, the inclusion criteria for malignant nodules were as follows: (1) no distant metastases or other co-occurring cancers, (2) before any related treatment, and (3) complete clinical records. BTN patients were matched to TC cases by age, gender, and the year of diagnosis. Histopathological diagnosis was performed by two qualified pathologists in all cases, and the clinical TNM stage of each malignant case was determined according to the 8th edition American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging System ( 27 2.2 EquationsIllumina methylation EPIC 850K BeadChip array and RNA-sequencing The study design and flow chart were shown in  Figure 1 Figure 1 Study design and flow chart. The 32 fresh-frozen tissue samples in the discovery study were subjected to Illumina Methylation EPIC 850K BeadChip array and RNA-Sequencing. In the discovery study, there was a good correlation between DNA methylation and mRNA expression of FABP3 Flowchart illustrating a study design. Discovery involves 17 BTN subjects and 15 TC cases with fresh-frozen tissues. Two processes: 1) Illumina Methylation EPIC 850K beadchip array with criteria of Delt beta greater or equal to 0.25, P less than 0.001, no related SNPs, and in promoter/exon; 2) RNA-Sequencing with criteria of FC greater or equal to 1.5 and P less than 0.05. Results identify CpG_7/cg18368411 within TSS200 of FABP3 gene, correlating DNA methylation and FABP3 mRNA expression. Validations: I with 221 BTN and 222 TC cases, II with 191 BTN and 256 TC cases, using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were analyzed at single nucleotide resolution by the Illumina Methylation EPIC 850K BeadChip array. Probes that meet the following criteria were considered differentially methylated: (1) methylation difference between BTN and TC groups (|delta-beta|) ≥ 0.25, (2) P st P 2.3 Gene set enrichment analysis GSEA was performed using the clusterProfiler R package (v4.4.4) on transcriptomic DEGs ranked by log2FoldChange. Gene IDs were converted to Entrez IDs via org.Hs.eg.db, with BH-adjusted P 2.4 Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue samples using FastPure FFPE DNA Isolation Kit (DC105, Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The isolated DNA was further bisulfite converted by EZ - 96 DNA Methylation Gold Kit (D5007, Zymo Research, Orange, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After bisulfite treatment, all non-methylated cytosine (C) bases in CpG sites were converted to uracil (U), whereas all methylated (C) bases remained unchanged. The CpG methylation levels of FFPE tissue samples were then determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as described by Yang et al. and Yin et al.

Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square test were used to compare the differences between TC and BTN groups. Spearman correlation was used to determine the relationship between variables. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), adjusted for age, gender, TSH, FT3, and FT4 levels. In addition, subgroup analyses were stratified by gender adjusted for age, TSH, FT3, and FT4.
