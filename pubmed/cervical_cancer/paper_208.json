This study examined the prevalence and associated risk factors for oral HPV and EBV co-infection among sexually active individuals in Nigeria. Methods This was a secondary analysis of oral samples of some selected participants in the Sexual Behaviour and HPV Infection in Nigerians in Ibadan (SHINI) study. Stored oral samples were analysed for detection of EBV DNA using real-time PCR detection and quantification kits. The socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and sexual behaviours, and biological characteristics, including the HPV genotype results, were retrieved from the SHINI study data. The association between oral HPV and EBV co-infection and selected participants’ characteristics were examined with chi-square or Fisher exact tests. Unadjusted logistic regression and multivariable hierarchical logistic regressions were performed to identify the significant risk factors with HPV and EBV co-infection. Statistical significance was set at p Results In total, 104 oral samples were analysed. The prevalence of oral HPV and EBV co-infection was 26.9%. Half (50%) of these participants were positive for EBV, and 45.2% were positive for oral HPV only. Nearly all participants with oral HPV and EBV co-infection were females (96.4%). Sex ( p p p p Conclusion There is high prevalence of oral HPV and EBV co-infection in males and females in Nigeria, with HIV status identified as a significant risk factor. Targeted public health measures, such as HPV vaccination programs especially in high-risk groups are recommended to reduce the burden of oral HPV and EBV co-infection.

Among these, HPV-16 and HPV-18 are notably associated with the development of several cancers, such as cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal malignancies [ 9 10 The pathogenesis of HPV-related oral cancers primarily involves the integration of viral DNA into the host genome, leading to dysregulation of cellular processes such as cell cycle control and apoptosis [ 11 3 Emerging evidence suggests that HPV and EBV may synergistically contribute to the development of oral cancers through several mechanisms [ 12 14 14 The synergy between HPV and EBV in oral carcinogenesis poses significant challenges for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies [ 15 16 The interplay between HPV and EBV represents a multifaceted relationship that could potentially influence the aetiopathogenesis of oral cancers [ 17 Methods Study design This was a secondary analysis of archived oral samples from the SHINI study. SHINI was a cross-sectional study conducted in Ibadan between 2016 and 2018 [ 18 FSWs are key population that are at higher risk of having sexually transmitted infections (STIs)-including HPV infections compared to FGP and they often lack access to preventive healthcare. The inclusion of FSWs in this study was to ensure a wider coverage on the burden of HPV infections among sexually active females in Ibadan. All male participants were selected from the general population within the selected LGAs, and none engaged in commercial sex work. Study area Ibadan, the capital city of Oyo State, Nigeria, serves as an ideal study area for investigating the prevalence, clinical significance, and molecular epidemiology of HPV and EBV infection in the general population. Situated in the south-western region of Nigeria, Ibadan is the largest city in the country by geographical area and one of the most populous urban centres in West Africa. Several factors make Ibadan an excellent study area for HPV and EBV research. Ibadan serves as a microcosm of Nigeria’s diverse epidemiological landscape, encompassing urban, peri-urban, and rural communities with varying levels of healthcare access, education, and awareness. Investigating HPV and EBV infection across different geographical settings within Ibadan allows for the identification of spatial patterns and determinants of viral transmission and disease progression. Brief overview of SHINI participants enrolment and sample analysis A two-stage sampling procedure was used for males and FGP recruitment. The identification codes from the 2006 National Population Commission Census Enumeration Areas (EAs) were first used to randomly select four EAs from the residential communities of Moniya and Mokola, as well as one EA from Sasa. These residential communities were chosen because of their high population and diversity in social class and ethnicity. A unique identifying number was assigned to each household in the selected EAs, and a list of males and females who met the study’s age requirements was compiled. The household listing data from each Study Site served as the sampling frame and were stratified into two age categories: 18 to 24 years for young adults and 25 to 45 years for older adults. A systematic random sampling of eligible household members from the sampling frame was conducted in the second stage until the study’s target sample size was reached. The research assistants visited the selected participants in each household and provided them with an information brochure in either English or a local language, along with a detailed explanation of the study’s objectives. Male and female participants who gave their consent were invited separately to the clinic to take part in the research. A short messaging service (SMS) reminder was sent on the morning of the clinic appointment, and prospective participants were contacted 72 and 24 h before the day of the clinic. At the clinic, a gender-matched research assistant reviewed the study’s objectives once again and provided a copy of the information pamphlet to support the discussion. Participants provided written or witnessed informed consent and authorized the collection of biological samples for testing of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and HPV. After signing the informed consent, participants were interviewed face-to-face in their preferred language, either English or the local language. Data on participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and sexual behaviours, and biological characteristics were collected. The sampling of FSWs began with mapping of brothels in the selected LGAs by trained field workers. After, a list of eligible participants was compiled and each one of them was assigned a unique number after speaking with their manager or head of the FSWs. Eligible FSWs were randomly selected from brothels with more than ten eligible participants for this study. During visits to each brothel, female research assistants distributed information leaflets, and this was corroborated with further explanation by the research assistant to each of the participants. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and sexual behaviours, and biological characteristics were collected through in-person interviews and sample collection, which took place in each participant’s bedroom. A detailed description of the SHINI study design, site selection, and sample collection procedures for both males and females at the oral, cervical, anal, vulvar, and penile anatomical sites, as well as the storage and transportation of samples, has been previously published [ 19 21 SHINI study HPV DNA genotyping and HIV testing Biological samples for HPV genotyping were sent to the Catalan Institute of Oncology in Spain. The genotyping was conducted using the Anyplex™ II HPV28 assay (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea). DNA was extracted from cervical, vulvar, anal, and penile dry swabs using the Maxwell 16 Buccal Swab LEV DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI, USA). The dry swabs were briefly eluted in 300 µL of lysis buffer and 30 µL of proteinase K, then incubated at 56 °C for 20 min and spun for two minutes at maximum speed. The kit manufacturer’s instructions were followed to extract DNA from the eluted samples. Further, the Maxwell ® 20 The rapid diagnostic test used for HIV screening followed the Federal Ministry of Health’s National Guidelines for HIV Prevention, Treatment, and Care in Nigeria [ 22 Participants and samples selection for EBV analysis A total of 941 participants were recruited for the SHINI study, of whom 625 were females (including 315 sex workers), and 316 were males. Each participant was identified using a participant ID that comprised the sex and study community. The list of all participant IDs was generated and placed in the computer program database. The computer program was used to randomly select 104 participants using stratified sampling to include the three-study population to minimise selection bias. Specifically, 44 FGP, 38 FSWs, and 22 males were randomly selected from the SHINI study. The oral samples of the randomly selected participants were retrieved from storage at minus 80 degrees Celsius and analysed for EBV detection. The socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and sexual behaviours, and biological characteristics, including the results of HPV genotype, were also retrieved from the SHINI data storage for the selected participant (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Participants and sample selection flow chart EBV DNA detection Detection, quantification of EBV DNA copy number, and genotyping were carried out using a real-time PCR kit. The assay utilized outer primers and probes targeting the LMP1 gene within the BamHI W region of the EBV genome. This region is critical for encoding proteins involved in viral latency and cellular transformation [ 23 24 25 26 1  Table 1 Summary of primers used for EBV DNA detection S/ N Primer name Sequence 1 LMP1 (Latent Membrane Protein 1) Forward Primer: 5’-GACTCTTAGTGTTGTGGTCAGTTC-3’ 2 LMP1 (Latent Membrane Protein 1) Reverse Primer: 5’-GGAGATGGCTGACACTGTTATT-3’ 3 Probe TGGTTCAGGTCCATCTGTCCACATTARMA Statistical analysis The socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle and sexual behaviours, and biological characteristics were summarized using frequency and percentage. A bar plot was used for the graphical representation of the prevalence of oral HPV and EBV co-infection. The association between oral HPV and EBV co-infection and participants’ characteristics was examined using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Unadjusted and multivariable hierarchical logistic regression analyses were performed to identify significant risk factors for oral HPV and EBV co-infection. The detection of oral HPV and EBV co-infection was used as the primary outcome variable, while socio-demographic, lifestyle and sexual behaviour, and biological characteristics were used as the explanatory variables. The socio-demographic, lifestyle and sexual behaviour, and biological characteristics were entered into multivariable hierarchical logistic regression in order. The crude odds ratios (cOR) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR), along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were reported for the unadjusted logistic regression and multivariable hierarchical logistic regression, respectively. Data were analysed using STATA version 15.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, 2019), with statistical significance defined as p Results Of the 104 participants randomly selected, 44 (42.3%) were FGP and 38 (36.5%) were FSWs, while 22 (21%) were males. Majority of the participants, (49.0%), were aged 25–34 years, and 52 (50%) were Yoruba ethnicity. Eighty-nine (85.6%) participants had never Smoked, 55 (52.9%) never consumed alcohol and 82 (78.8%) had no history of taking illicit drugs. Only 18 (17.3%) and 34 (32.7%) of participants had history of ever given or received oral sex from a sexual partner, respectively (Table 2 2  Table 2 Descriptive statistics of selected participants’ sociodemographic, behavioural, and biological characteristics Variables Frequency Percentage (%) Socio-demographic characteristics Sex FSWs 38 36.5 FGP 44 42.3 Male 22 21.2 Age group 18–24 years 27 25.9 25–34 Years 51 49.0 35–45 Years 26 25.0 Ethnicity Yoruba 52 50.0 Hausa/Fulani 7 6.7 Igbo 15 14.4 Others 30 28.9 Religion Christianity 66 63.5 Islam 38 36.5 Education Primary school or less 15 14.4 Secondary 67 64.4 Tertiary 22 21.2 Occupation No current paid job 24 23.1 Semi-Skilled 45 43.3 Skilled 35 33.7 Monthly Income No income 7 6.7 1–10,000 N (1–28USD) 28 26.9 10,001–20,000 N (> 28–56USD) 26 25.0 > 20,000 N (> 56USD) 43 41.4 Marital status Single 33 31.7 Married 52 50.0 Divorced/Separated/Widowed 19 18.3 Lifestyle and sexual characteristics Ever smoked Tobacco No 89 85.6 Yes 15 14.4 Ever drank alcoholic No 55 52.9 Yes 49 47.1 Ever taken any illicit drugs No 82 78.8 Yes 22 21.2 Multiple sexual partners No 55 55.0 Yes 45 45.0 Condom use during penile-vaginal sex No 46 44.2 Yes 58 55.8 Ever gave oral sex No 86 82.7 Yes 18 17.3 Ever received oral sex No 70 67.3 Yes 34 32.7 Biological characteristics Anal HPV infection No 40 40.4 Yes 59 59.6 Genital HPV infection No 21 20.2 Yes 83 79.8 HIV Status Positive 15 14.4 Negative 89 85.6 Overall, the prevalence of oral HPV and EBV infections was 45.2% and 50.0%, respectively.

characteristics in model 2 (Table 5 p p Discussion This study provides the first published information on the prevalence of HPV and EBV co-infection in the oral cavity in the general population in Nigeria. The study showed that nearly half of the participants were positive for oral HPV and EBV infections respectively, and a little over a quarter had oral HPV and EBV co-infections. The prevalence of oral HPV among the sampled participants was notably higher than what was reported in earlier studies [ 20 27 28 29 30 32 Although data on the prevalence of EBV DNA in the general population is lacking in Nigeria, this study showed that EBV may be common in the general population. The prevalence of HPV and EBV co-infection is lower compared to the 40.4% reported in a similar study conducted among the general population in Qatar [ 33 4 5 34 35 The most common HPV genotypes in oral HPV and EBV co-infection were HPV 35 and HPV 51. This finding aligns with the established relationship between EBV infection and high-risk HPV genotypes, including HPV-16, −18, −31, −35, −45, −51, and − 58 [ 5 36 We observed that oral HPV and EBV are not dependently associated. The presence of either of HPV or EBV infections do not automatically indicate the presence of the other virus, suggesting that natural competition between HPV and EBV might not occur in the oral cavity. The observation of a higher prevalence of oral EBV among those negative for oral HPV, compared to a lower prevalence of oral EBV among those positive for oral HPV might suggest that EBV infection maybe more prevalent irrespective of associated co-infection with oral HPV. EBV is associated with nearly 1.5% of human cancers, including tumours of both lymphatic and epithelial origin [ 25 37 There was a significant association between any HPV in the anal and genital anatomic sites and the risk of oral HPV and EBV co-infection. All participants who had any HPV in their genital anatomic sites (cervix or vulva for females and penis for males) also had oral HPV and EBV co-infection. The association between genital HPV infection and oral HPV infection has been attributed to the practice of oral sex [ 38 39 40 42 43 Although oral sex has been widely recognized as a significant mode of transmission for both oral HPV and EBV, our findings showed a higher prevalence of oral HPV and EBV co-infection among participants who reported never engaged in oral sex. Specifically, 60.7% of those who had never received oral sex and 75.0% of those who had never given oral sex had oral HPV and EBV co-infection. This suggests that, in addition to oral-genital contact, other non-sexual or indirect modes of oral HPV and EBV transmission such as open-mouth kissing or French kissing [ 44 45 Another key finding of this study is the sex differences in the prevalence of oral HPV and EBV co-infection. The prevalence of oral HPV and EBV co-infection was significantly higher among FGP and FSWs than males. Male participants had lower odds of having oral HPV and EBV co-infection compared to females (FGP and FSWs) when lifestyle and sexual characteristics were adjusted with socio-demographic characteristics. This pattern contrasts with the sex differences observed in oral HPV [ 46 50 51 This study showed that HIV status is a significant associated factor for detecting oral HPV and EBV co-infection. Previous studies had showed a higher likelihood of oral HPV [ 52 54 55 56 Several studies reported on different factors associated with oral HPV and EBV infections. Lifestyle and sexual characteristics such as alcohol consumption, smoking, multiple sexual partners, and the practice of oral sex were associated with oral HPV [ 49 57 58 59 4 Although there is a significant prevalence of oral HPV and EBV coinfections among participants, however, the absence of cytologic examination limits our ability to directly correlate these infections with precancerous or malignant outcomes. The sample size, and cross-sectional secondary analyses of archival samples are other potential limitations that could have affected the statistical power and generalizability. Despite these, our study provides insights into the prevalence of oral HPV and EBV infection only, as well as co-infections among sexually active population of males and females in Nigeria. Furthermore, this study provides baseline findings on the burden and potential risk of cancers associated with HPV and EBV. Conclusions In conclusion, this study showed that over a quarter of sexually active males and females in the general population had oral HPV and EBV co-infection. The study also demonstrated that the risk of co-infection is higher among people living with HIV. This strong association may suggest a need for targeted public health measures that will promote preventive strategies such as HPV vaccination, lifestyle modification, and screening among at-risk populations. We recommend future research that will elucidate the natural history and mechanism of oral HPV and EBV co-infection in the development of oral and oropharyngeal associated cancers, particularly in resource constrained settings such as Nigeria.
