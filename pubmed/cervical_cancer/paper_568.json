This pilot study aimed to investigate differential DNAm patterns in preterm children with and without prenatal TSE using reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to interrogate a wider array of sites than in more common approaches, namely microarrays. Buccal swabs were collected from 16 two-year-old children (7 with TSE, 9 without), and DNAm was quantified at over 1.3 million CpG sites. To identify differential DNAm, univariable analyses were first performed and followed by Bayesian beta-binomial hierarchical regression models for sequence count data including adjustment for potential confounders. False Discovery Rate correction was used to account for multiple comparisons.

Introduction Prenatal tobacco smoke exposure (TSE) is associated with many adverse consequences in childhood and adulthood which include abnormalities affecting neurodevelopment, immune function, and the respiratory and cardiovascular systems [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 7 8 9 10 Prior studies indicate that prenatal TSE is associated with several differentially methylated CpGs in newborns [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 10 19 Previous DNAm studies have used techniques such as epigenome-wide DNA methylation analyses (EWAS), whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), or microarrays such as the Illumina 450 K array or the MethylationEPIC array [ 8 11 12 13 16 17 20 21 22 23 24 25 23 26 27 28 29 30 23 2. Methods 2.1. Study Participants This study included data from a subsample (n = 16) of child participants from CINEPS, a parent study that prospectively enrolled and collected data and samples from 395 very preterm infants born at ≤32 weeks gestational age (GA) from September 2016 to November 2019. Enrollment occurred at five level III/IV academic or community Ohio-area newborn intensive care units in Cincinnati and Dayton, Ohio, USA. Infants were excluded if they had known chromosomal or congenital anomalies that affected the central nervous system, cyanotic heart disease, or if they were hospitalized and received mechanical ventilation with greater than 50% supplemental oxygen at 45 weeks postmenstrual age. The Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Institutional Review Board approved the study. The other hospitals’ review boards approved the study based on an established reliance agreement. Written informed consent was provided by the caregivers of all infants. We selected a convenience sample of children who had buccal swabs collected at two years corrected age (n = 35). Of those, we selected children who had maternal self-reports of tobacco use during pregnancy (n = 7 with prenatal TSE, n = 59 with no prenatal TSE). The selected children were then matched based on child demographics (sex, race, ethnicity), and gestational age (22–28 weeks or 29–32 weeks). The seven children with prenatal TSE were matched on sex and gestational age at birth with children who did not have prenatal TSE (n = 9). Thus, 16 total children were included in the analysis. 2.2. Buccal Swab Collection Buccal swabs are well-tolerated and easy to collect in children [ 31 32 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 2.3. Maternal and Child Assessments Enrolled mothers provided information on their child’s demographics (i.e., race, ethnicity), mothers’ age, household income, education, and employment status. Each child’s gestational age, birth weight, and Apgar scores were obtained from their electronic medical record. Mothers were asked if they smoked combustible cigarettes during their pregnancy (yes/no) and children whose mothers reported “yes” were considered to have had prenatal TSE. 2.4. DNA Core Protocol RRBS libraries were prepared with the Zymo-Seq RRBS Library Kit (Irvine, CA, USA) using the suggested protocol [ 40 2.5. RRBS Processing The methodology included quality control procedures and filtering criteria related to coverage. The total number of CpG sites interrogated was 1,340,955. The preparation of RRBS data involved several key steps to ensure high-quality and reliable results [ 41 2.6. Statistical Analysis We examined the association between prenatal TSE and DNAm intensity at each CpG site. Univariable analyses were performed because this was a matched cohort study. These analyses were followed by multivariable models to improve the precision of model estimates, conditioning on the potential confounding factors including race, precise gestational age, and child sex. The epigenome-wide analyses were conducted using the R package (version R4.1.1) Dispersion Shrinkage for Sequencing data (DSS, version 2.42.0) [ 42 43 44 45 46 p The analysis workflow focused on identifying differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs). For each of the CpG sites, the difference in DNAm was calculated as the difference in group mean methylation, interpreted as percent methylation. Annotation of DMCs was performed using CHIPseeker packages, providing insights into the genomic context of the methylation changes. We also used the UCSC genome browser (hg38) to map genomic features associated with significant CpG sites [ 47 3. Results 3.1. Participant Characteristics Participant characteristics are shown in Table 1 Table 1 3.2. Differentially Methylated CpG Sites In the univariable model, prenatal TSE was significantly associated with DNAm intensity at 4 CpG sites ( Table 2 p p 4. Discussion DNAm is a major epigenetic mechanism involved in gene regulation [ 48 20 21 22 CALN1 49 TBL1XR1 50 LINGO1 51 Concerning the hypomethylation observed in CALN1, 52 53 54 55 CALN1 55 CALN1 56 CALN1 49 52 CALN1 57 We also observed hypomethylation of TBL1XR1 TBL1XR1 50 58 TBL1XR1 59 60 TBL1XR1 61 62 We observed hypermethylation of LINGO1 51 LINGO1 63 64 LINGO1 51 LINGO1 65 Although research on the CINEPS cohort has not evaluated if DNAm patterns are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes, examination of the full CINEPS cohort indicates that prenatal TSE is directly associated with diffuse white matter abnormality, decreased brain tissue volumes, and high global brain abnormality scores [ 66 67 Limitations While this exploratory pilot study is unique in that we used RRBS to assess epigenetic changes due to prenatal TSE in children born preterm, this study had several limitations. The sample size was small and thus not powered to detect small effects. Nevertheless, even with this small sample size, we identified CpG sites through RRBS that differ from prior work with standard microarray chips. In addition, our sample was matched on factors that could confound the observed associations (e.g., race, gestational age). Thus, the study methods using RRBS and our results provide an important formative basis for future, larger studies to examine our findings. These studies should consider the use of RRBS to compare DNAm patterns in large cohorts of children with and without TSE that are carefully matched on sociodemographic characteristics and birth histories. RRBS should be considered in the future as it is a cost- and time-effective sequencing method that has been used to successfully identify and provide preliminary insights into DNAm patterns in smaller pilot studies [ 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 66 5. Conclusions In this novel pilot study of children born preterm, we used RRBS to analyze DNAm patterns associated with prenatal TSE. Using RRBS, we identified four CpG sites that showed differential methylation patterns which have not been previously reported. Given the advantages of using RRBS and the wide range of conditions associated with the CpG sites we found, these findings should be further investigated in large prospective cohorts to add to the literature about potential mechanisms and consequences of prenatal TSE.
