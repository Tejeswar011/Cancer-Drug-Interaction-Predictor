We report one case in China of a couple simultaneously infected with the monkeypox. Both spouses developed genital skin lesions successively and the female partner had widespread skin lesions all over her body, while the male partner is HIV-positive, had a history of homosexual behavior before the onset of symptoms.

She had no significant medical history before this. The patient began experiencing headaches with recurrent fever 5 days ago on August 14, 2023, with a temperature as high as 38.3°C. Accompanied by painful papules and vesicles on the external genital and perianal skin, later spreading to the trunk and limbs, including the head, hands, and face, etc. ( Figure Figure The systemic skin manifestation during monkeypox infection in a young woman in Yunnan, China before treatment (A, B, and C) and after treatment (D). Figure Li. Monkeypox virus infection in a 23-year-old woman with a genital rash and global skin lesions: evidence for spouse-to-spouse transmission. AJOG Glob Rep 2025. The patient reported having engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse with her spouse one week (August 7, 2023) prior to the onset of her symptoms. The patient's spouse is a bisexual individual who was diagnosed as HIV positive in 2019, age at diagnosis was 21 years, and has been consistently receiving antiviral treatment with good immunovirological control. He admitted to having had unprotected extramarital sex with a male partner on July 17, 2023. Subsequently, on August 11, 2023, he developed itching red papules and vesicles on the foreskin of the penis, with white edges, and no rash was observed in other areas. Since then, he has not exhibited skin lesions in other areas or other systemic signs or symptoms. Unfortunately, we were not able to capture a photograph of his lesions. As of August 25, 2023, both the throat swab and whole blood monkeypox virus tests have yielded negative results, while the foreskin vesicular fluid tested positive (with a CT value of 31.95). Both of them deny having a recent history of traveling abroad. After admission, the patient received symptomatic supportive treatment. The fever and sore throat symptoms improved, the vesicles and ulcers on the external genitalia and perianal lesions resolved, and the vesicular lesions on the body gradually reduced in size and formed scabs ( figure Up to this point, it estimates that more than 99% of monkeypox infection cases have been in males, but it can also affect other populations, including children, the elderly, and females. 1 2 3 Currently, there is limited data on the transmission routes and clinical characteristics of the monkeypox virus in females. Cases of monkeypox virus infection have been reported in females between the ages of 18 and 71, all of whom exhibited varying degrees of genital lesions, including painful vulvar and intravaginal lesions, pruritic genital rash, or ulcerating vulvar lesions. 4 5 6 7 8 4 , 6 It is estimated that 28-47% of individuals diagnosed with monkeypox infection are co-infected with HIV. 9 10 11 Similar to our case, most current studies of monkeypox cases have incomplete screening for STIs, leading to significant bias in the understanding of the clinical spectrum of the disease. For example, not routinely testing for Mycoplasma genitalium may underestimate its contribution to proctitis – studies have shown that it can be detected in about 15-30% of persistent proctitis that does not respond to standard treatment. 12 10 12 13 CRediT authorship contribution statement Wen-Shuang Li: Rong-Jing Dong: Shui-Tao Yi: Ru-Qin Zhang: Rui-Xia Chen: Yan-Jie Ning: Dian-Jiang Xiao: References 1 Rodriguez-Morales A.J.
