This study explored the roles and mechanism of SUZ12 in OTSCC progression. Methods SUZ12 protein levels in OTSCC tissues and cell lines were determined using immunohistochemistry assay and Western blot analysis. SUZ12 was overexpressed or silenced through transfection of Overexpression plasmids or small interfering RNA targeting SUZ12 were transfected into CAL27 and SCC9 cells to achieve SUZ12 overexpression or knockdown. Subsequently, cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Vimentin) were determined. Zinc finger protein 582 (ZNF582) promoter methylation was detected using the methylation-specific PCR assay. Then, the effects of ZNF582 on CAL27 cell behaviors were also evaluated using gain/loss function experiments. Moreover, rescue experiments were conducted to investigate the role of the SUZ12/ZNF582 axis in regulating CAL27 cell progression. Additionally, SUZ12-silenced CAL27 cells were subcutaneously injected into the posterior flank of mice, followed by tumor growth detection within a 28 day period. Results SUZ12 protein was significantly upregulated in OTSCC tissues and cell lines. SUZ12 overexpression augmented proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in both CAL27 and SCC9 cells, while SUZ12 knockdown showed the opposite results. SUZ12 inhibited ZNF582 expression by promoting DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)-mediated ZNF582 promoter methylation. Moreover, ZNF582 knockdown promoted OTSCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT, while ZNF582 overexpression led to the opposite results. Rescue experiments demonstrated that ZNF582 knockdown abrogated SUZ12 knockdown-mediated inhibition of CAL27 cell malignant progression. Besides, SUZ12 knockdown suppressed xenograft tumor growth of OTSCC in nude mice. Conclusion SUZ12 knockdown inhibits the proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in OTSCC cells by inhibiting DNMT1-mediated ZNF582 promoter methylation, thereby suppressing tumor growth in vivo.

Increasing evidence has revealed the upregulation of SUZ12 in malignancies including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [ 13 14 15 16 17 13 18 19 14 20 Zinc finger protein 582 (ZNF582) has recently emerged as a tumor suppressor gene across multiple cancer types [ 21 22 21 22 23 24 25 This study validated that SUZ12 was significantly upregulated in OTSCC tissues and cell lines. The functional roles and underlying mechanisms of SUZ12/ZNF582 axis in regulating OTSCC progression were further explored. This study aims to provide critical insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic pathogenesis in OTSCC.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and streptomycin-penicillin solution at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 Cell transfection Overexpression plasmids (pcDNA-SUZ12 and pcDNA-ZNF582) and small interfering RNAs (si-SUZ12 and si-ZNF582) were provided by RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). Empty vector and non-targeting scrambled siRNA were used as controls. Lipofectamine 3000 Reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher, USA) was employed in cell transfection according to the manufacture’s instructions. Briefly, transfection complexes were formed by diluting Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (10 µL) and plasmids (10 µL) separately in 250 µL Opti-MEM. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, the solutions were mixed and incubated for a further 20 min. The complexes were then added to 70–80% confluent cells in a 6-well plate and cultured for 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 Western blot assay Total proteins in OTSCC cells and clinical tissue samples were isolated using RIPA solution. Specifically, cells cultured in 6-well plates were lysed by incubation with ice-cold RIPA buffer for 20 min on ice. The resulting lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to collect the protein supernatant. Following separation on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. Protein bands were subsequently blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against SUZ12 (1:1000, Abcam, ab12073), ZNF582 (1:1000, Biorbyt, orb452454), E-cadherin (1:1000, Abcam, ab76055), N-cadherin (1:5000, Abcam, ab76011), Vimentin (1:1000, Abcam, ab92547), and GAPDH (1:2500, Abcam, ab9485). After subsequent incubation with the secondary antibody (1:2000, Abcam, ab6721) for 1 h at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solution was utilized to visualize the protein signal. protein levels were analyzed with ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, USA) and normalized with GAPDH. RT-qPCR Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol solution (Invitrogen, USA). RNA concentration was determined using NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher, USA). PrimeScript RT reagent (Takara, Dalian, China) was utilized to synthesize the complementary DNA (cDNA) with the following temperature condictions: 37 °C for 15 min and 85 °C for 5 min. RT-qPCR was performed with SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara, Dalian, China) on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (ABS, CA, USA). The 25 µL reaction mixture contained 12.5 µL of SYBR Premix Ex Taq II, 1 µL each of forward and reverse primers, 2 µL of cDNA, and 8.5 µL of dd H 2 −ΔΔCT Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay CAL27 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1 × 10 4 2 Transwell migration and invasion assay Transwell chamber (8 μm pore size, Corning, NY, USA) was used to assess cell migration (without Matrigel) and invasion (with precoated Matrigel). CAL27 cells (5 × 10 4 Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay The potential interacting proteins of SUZ12 were predicted using the Genemania tool ( https://genemania.org/ Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay CAL27 cells were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and quenched with 125 mM glycine for 5 min. Cell lysates were then obtained by using the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) lysis solution, followed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C. Next, the supernatant was collected and sonicated on ice with several pulses to obtain 200–1000 bp chromatin fragments. Sheared chromatin (500 µg) were next incubated with anti-DNMT1 antibody or IgG control coupled to ChIP-grade protein G magnetic beads at 4 °C overnight. Finally, the obtained fragments were eluted from beads and analyzed using RT-qPCR. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) The CpG island in the ZNF582 promoter was predicted by the MethPrimer platform ( http://www.urogene.org/cgi-bin/methprimer/methprimer.cgi Animal xenograft assay BALB/c nude mice were obtained from the animal experimental center of China Pharmaceutical University, and the animals were maintained under standard conditions (22–25 °C, 50–60% Humidity, 12 h light/dark cycle) with free access to food and water. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Eastern Theater General Hospital (Approval number: 2022DZGKJDWLS-0095). Mice were randomly divided into two groups using the random number table method: scramble group and si-SUZ12 group ( n 7 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay Tumors were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned at 4 µm thickness. Sections were subsequently deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through a graded ethanol series. Then, sections were pretreated with sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) in a microwave oven, and then incubated with 3% H 2 2 Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining Tumor tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned into 4 μm thick slices. The slices were then dewaxed in xylene for 10 min, dehydrated in an ethanol gradient, and stained in with hematoxylin and eosin solution (Solarbio, Beijing, China). Briefly, sections were stained with hematoxylin for 5 min, differentiated in 1% acid ethanol for 3 s, blued in 0.2% ammonia water, and counterstained with 0.5% eosin for 2 min. Subsequently, sections were dehydrated in ethanol gradients, cleared in xylene, and mounted with neutral balsam. The pathological details were observed under a light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical analysis The experimental results from triplicate experiments were presented as the mean ± standard error of mean (SEM). The cell sample size for cell experiments was 6, and for animal experiments was 8. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 22.0. Student’s t-test was used to compare two groups, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey-Kramer correction was used to determine differences among multiple groups. P Results SUZ12 is significantly upregulated in OTSCC tissues and cell lines The protein levels of SUZ12 in tumor tissues and matched adjacent tissues from OTSCC patients were detected using Western blot analysis and IHC assay. We observed that SUZ12 was significantly upregulated in OTSCC tissue samples (Fig. 1 1 P 1 1  Fig. 1 SUZ12 is conspicuously upregulated in OTSCC tissues and cell lines.

It was demonstrated that si-SUZ12 transfection markedly augmented ZNF582 level, while si-ZNF582 transfection inhibited ZNF582 expression (Fig. 6 6 6 6 6  Fig. 6 ZNF582 knockdown reversed the effects of SUZ12 knockdown on OTSCC cell progression.

CAL27 cells transfected with scramble or si-SUZ12 were injected subcutaneously into mice ( n A B C D E F G H I N *P Discussion OTSCC is characterized by early lymph node metastasis, poor prognosis and low survival rate [ 26 27 This study reveals the oncogenic role of SUZ12 in OTSCC, aligning with its established roles in other malignancies, such as NSCLC, gastric cancer, and glioblastoma. SUZ12 was previously found to be aberrantly upregulated in primary OTSCC, and which was significantly correlated with cervical node metastasis in OTSCC [ 20 28 28 24 25 Accumulating evidence has illustrates that the significant downregulation of ZNF582 in multiple cancers is closely related to ZNF582 promoter hypermethylation [ 21 23 24 29 30 25 There are some potential limitations in our study. First, the restricted sample size of OTSCC patients may impact the generalizability and robustness of our findings. We intend to expand clinical cohorts to enhance the reliability of our findings and collect sufficient long-term follow-up data to investigate the prognostic value of SUZ12 in OTSCC. Second, while in vitro cell culture model is valuable for mechanistic exploration, it cannot fully recapitulate the complexity of human tumor microenvironments or systemic biological interactions. Translation to clinical applications requires validation in large animal models that closely recapitulate human physiology. Third, additional molecular mechanisms likely contribute to SUZ12-mediated OTSCC progression. Subsequent studies will explore complementary pathways and regulatory networks. Taken together, our study reveals that SUZ12 is significantly upregulated in OTSCC and shows correlation with lymph node metastasis. SUZ12 silencing restrained OTSCC cell proliferation, invasion and EMT, and reduced xenograft tumor growth. Mechanistically, SUZ12 reduced ZNF582 expression through promoting DNMT1-mediated ZNF582 promoter methylation in OSTCC cells. Our findings elucidate novel molecular mechanisms underlying OTSCC metastasis and identify SUZ12 overexpression and ZNF582 hypermethylation as promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets for aggressive OTSCC.
