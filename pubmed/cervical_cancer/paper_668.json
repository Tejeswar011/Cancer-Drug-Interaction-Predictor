Introduction According to the latest estimates of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), there were nearly 20 million new cancer cases and 9.7 million cancer deaths in 2022 [ 1 2 3 4 The JCHAIN 5 6 JCHAIN 7 8 9 10 JCHAIN 6 Given that the above studies were tightly confined to a single cancer, our study explored the role of the JCHAIN JCHAIN JCHAIN JCHAIN JCHAIN JCHAIN 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Acquisition and Processing Gene expression data for 33 malignancies, as well as clinical data, were gathered from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database ( https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ GSE10780 GSE109169 GSE134359 GSE29044 GSE50428 GSE53752 GSE54002 GSE61304 GSE65194 GSE76250 GSE139038 GSE45827 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ 2.2.

Cell Transfection The JCHAIN ® 2.11. CCK-8 Experiment The MCF-7 cells with more than 70% apposition rate, trypsin digestion, centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min, take the precipitate and dilute the concentration to 1000–2000 cells per 1 mL, take a 96-well plate, add 200 μL of cell suspension to each well, incubate in the incubator for 24 h, and add l0 μL of CCK-8 in each well at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively. In each well, add a solution (BMU106-CN, Abbkine, Wuhan, China) and incubate for 4 h before measuring absorbance at 450 nm using an enzyme marker (30050303, TECAN, Männedorf, Switzerland). 2.12. Cell Scratching Assay Cells were inoculated into 24-well plates, and when the wall-adherence rate of adherent cells reached 70–80%, the cells were scored by scratching experiments using a 200 μL tip and scratched 3 times, and photographed with an inverted fluorescence microscope at 0 h. Subsequently, the cells were cultured in an incubator for 24 h and 48 h, and observed and photographed, respectively, and the cell mobility was calculated by ImageJ (1.53e, Bethesda, MD, USA) using a scratch width Calculation formula: (0 h width − 24 h width)/0 h width × 100%. 2.13. Experiments in Colony Generation Cells were inoculated into 6-well plates (4000/well) and cultured for 1–2 weeks. After colony generation, supernatant was removed, 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde was added to each well for 15 min of fixation, paraformaldehyde was removed, 1 mL of crystal violet solution was added to each well for 15 min of staining, the cells were washed with PBS until the purple colour did not appear on the PBS, air dried, and photographed. 2.14. Western Blot MCF-7 breast cancer cells were lysed with RIPA buffer, and then the total protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Shanghai, China). Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). It was blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at room temperature. Diluted primary antibodies were then added and overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed and incubated with the corresponding peroxidase (HRP-conjugated) secondary antibody (1:5000) for 1 h. The signals were detected with an ECL detection kit (Applygen Technologies Inc, Beijing, China) and imaged in a chemiluminescence metre (ChemiDoc XRS+, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). β- actin was used as an endogenous control. The following primary antibodies were used: STAT4 (1:1000, item number A4523), p-JAK3 (1:1000, item number AF8160), JAK3 (1:2000, item number AF0008), JCHAIN (1:1000, item number ab269855), IL-2 (1:5000, item number 83558-5RR), β- actin (1:100,000, stock number 81115-1-RR), where β-actin and IL-2 were from Proteintech Group, Inc. (Wuhan, China), STAT4 and JCHAIN were from ABclonal Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China) and abcam (Shanghai, China), respectively, and p-JAK3 and JAK3 from Affinity Biosciences (Jiangsu, China). 2.15. Transwell Test Transwell chambers (BIOFIL) were used for the Transwell assay. The matrix gel was spread on the upper layer of the Transwell chambers by diluting the matrix gel with serum-free medium (100 uL of matrix gel was added to 800 uL of medium), mixing, and solidifying in the incubator for 2–4 h. The culture was changed to blood-free medium one day in advance and the cells were starved for 12 h. Afterwards, the cells were detached from the dishes with trypsin and the cell suspension (2.5 × 10 5 2 2.16.

RT-PCR Tissue samples from breast cancer patients were provided by Shanxi Cancer Hospital, and the study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Shanxi Cancer Hospital (approval number: KY2023163). All participants signed an informed consent form. Total RNA was extracted from the tissues by using the TransZol UP kit (ET111, TrnasGen Biotech, Beijing, China). cDNA synthesis was performed using the TransScript ® ® 2.18.

Methylation Analysis of the JCHAIN in Pan-Cancer To understand its transcriptional regulation in these cancers, we thoroughly examined two regulatory mechanisms: promoter DNA methylation and RNA methylation alterations including N1-methyladenosine (m1A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and N6-methyladenosine (m6A). Analysis of promoter DNA methylation performed through the UALCAN site revealed that, compared to normal tissues, the JCHAIN Figure 5 Figure S2A JCHAIN Figure S3A–C JCHAIN JCHAIN 3.5.
