It concerns women at any age, but in pre‐menarchal and postmenopausal periods, it is more frequent [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 7 7 11 12 13 2 2 14 15 16 Indeed, with a wavelength of 10 600 nm, this kind of laser can cause superficial microablative effects in soft tissues and can also provide a pulsed beam that shields tissues from potential overheating damage. Partial delivery of the laser beam to the tissue results in tiny patches (150–200 μm) that alternate between treated and untreated tissue [ 17 18 The randomized controlled trial by Burkett et al. [ 19 2 In the randomized clinical trial conducted by Salgado et al. [ 20 2 2 Based on this research, the current study aims to evaluate the performance of CO 2 2 Material and Methods 2.1 Study Population This retrospective study enrolled 85 women affected by VLS, after failure of local corticosteroid therapy, at the Sedes Sapientiae Institute of Turin in the period between January 2014 and April 2023. Information was collected using an electronic database regarding VLS severity and clinical features, demographic data, medical history, previous treatments, current therapies, and presence of comorbidities. The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated at 1 month follow‐up (T1) and at 6 months follow‐up (T2) from the last treatment session. Eligibility criteria were: clinical diagnosis of VLS, negative cervical smear in the 12 months before the study, previous medical treatment failure, and signing of an informed consent. Among the exclusion criteria were: Women with less than 18 years of age; the presence of infection, lesion, or abscess of the genital tract; squamous cell carcinoma; pregnancy or breastfeeding; active urinary infection; vulvar and/or vaginal neoplasia; use of systemic or topical drugs during the study period or in the 2 months prior to the study period; contraindications to the use of laser (such as bacterial, fungal, or active viral infections); alcohol or drug addiction; decompensated psychiatric disorders; unsigned informed consent; or vulvar disease with unclear diagnosis. Most (94%) of enrolled patients were postmenopausal and had symptoms of vulvo‐vaginal atrophy in addition to those of VLS. 2.2 Study Protocol Patients were treated with three sessions of fractional CO 2 Laser settings are reported in Table 1 TABLE 1 Laser therapy parameters. Genital area Probe Parameters Vaginal canal Endo  PulseShape: DP Power: 40 W Dwell time: 1000 μs Spacing: 1000 μm Stack: 3 Vaginal introitus Vulvar  PulseShape: DP Power: 10–40 W Dwell time: 1000 μs Spacing: 1000 μm Stack: 1–2 Vulva (also clitoris and perianal area) Vulvar  PulseShape: DP Power: 10–40 W Dwell time: 1000 μs Spacing: 1000 μm Stack: 1–2 Every patient was assessed for vulvo‐vaginal and vaginal health at baseline (pre‐treatment), at 1 month from the last treatment session (T1), and 6 months from the last treatment session (T2). The Vulvar Health Index (VuHI) score and the Vaginal Health Index (VHI) score were used. Moreover, patients assessed the severity of their symptoms (superficial dyspareunia and vulvar dryness) using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), a 10‐point scale going from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (maximum symptoms). A flowchart of the treatment is illustrated in Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Treatment flowchart. In detail, the Vulvar Health Index (VuHI) consists of eight measures: Labia minora, labia majora, urethra, clitoris, vaginal introitus and elasticity, bother, color and pain, and other elements (such as petechiae and ulcerations). Each parameter goes from 0 to 3. The vulva is deemed atrophic if the overall score is greater than 8 or if the sum for any one of the categories is 3 [ 21 On the other hand, the Vaginal Health Index score (VHI) consists of five measures: Elasticity, fluid volume, pH, epithelial integrity, and moisture. Each parameter is graded from 1 to 5. If the total score is < 15, the vagina is considered atrophic [ 22 Moreover, patients were asked by a trained interviewer to assess the severity of their symptoms (superficial dyspareunia and vulvar dryness) using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), a 10‐point scale going from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (maximum symptoms) [ 23 2.3 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS program version 25.0 (IBM). Initially, the entire sample was subjected to a descriptive analysis, wherein means, interquartile ranges, standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages for categorical variables were reported. Tables were used to show the trends of the mean values of the VAS, VHI, and VuHI scales, which were employed to evaluate the sample. The outcome's variables examined were: Visual Analogical Scale score in the two items “superficial dyspareunia” and “vulvar dryness”; Vulvar Health Index (VuHI) score and Vaginal Health Index (VHI) score. A p T 3 Results 3.1 Study Population A total of 85 females were enrolled. At baseline, the mean age was 63.7 ± 7.8 years (range, 50–92 years). Most subjects had deliveries (95%), and these were mostly vaginal (54%). Most subjects were postmenopausal (94%). Five patients (6%) had a previous diagnosis of breast cancer. Among declared symptoms, the most common was vaginal dryness (56%), followed by dyspareunia ( n 2 TABLE 2 Characteristics of the study population.

No side effects were observed. 4 Discussion VLS is a chronic inflammatory illness that is often underdiagnosed and challenging to treat. Currently, the first‐line therapy involves topical corticosteroids. However, these have limitations due to potential long‐term side effects and often poor response, as VLS frequently presents as resistant to medical therapies [ 24 New horizons in regenerative therapy for VLS are being explored such as laser, vulvar lipofilling, and platelet‐rich plasma injection. Laser therapy in the gynecological field has shown significant results, particularly in women with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) [ 25 Consequently, vulvar laser therapy has been considered a treatment option in recent studies. Although current research is limited and conducted on small sample sizes, fractional CO 2 26 27 28 29 30 Especially in steroid‐resistant cases, promising results seem to come from regenerative therapies, including CO 2 25 Concerning the mechanism of action of CO 2 26 27 28 29 30 2 31 2 In our study after 3 sessions of treatment with laser, the color, moisture, and elasticity of the mucosa and skin improved considerably, and nearly all women reported that the laser treatment was well tolerated and enhanced their QoL. The effect of the laser on vulvar health was evaluated, measured by objective (VuHI scale) and subjective instruments, using validated scales (VAS scale for superficial dyspareunia and vulvar dryness). Both the VuHI score and the VAS scale showed significant improvement in the assessed parameters at 1 and at 6 months after the laser treatment was completed. A significant result was also obtained with laser treatment at the vaginal level for GSM symptoms, which was evaluated by the VHI score. Specifically, for the VuHI, the eight measures regarding the labia minora, labia majora, urethra, clitoris, vaginal introitus, elasticity, bother and pain, color, and other elements (such as petechiae and ulcerations) of the vulvovaginal area showed a significant ( p When compared to baseline, the VHI evaluation's five metrics—elasticity, fluid secretion, pH, epithelial mucosa, and vaginal region moisture—showed a significant ( p Finally, VAS scores significantly ( p Our study showed that laser therapy may be a promising therapeutic alternative for VLS patients refractory to medical therapies, leading to improvement in vulvar health objectively assessed and in VLS‐related symptoms subjectively assessed by validated instruments. Our results are in line with Filippini et al. [ 32 2 Significant improvement in symptoms assessed by the subjective VAS scale was also highlighted by the study of Pagano et al. [ 25 2 The efficacy of CO 2 33 2 Additionally, the findings of Villalba et colleagues [ 34 2 Overall, in accordance with the literature's findings, our study showed that treating recalcitrant VLS with fractionated CO 2 In our opinion, this regenerative technique should be implemented, given the excellent results and the limited therapeutic alternatives currently available. 4.1 Study Limitation Within the limitations of this study, there is a lack of younger patients in the study population. It would be more complete and more interesting to understand if the treatment we used is as efficient as it was in older women. Other biases are the absence of a non‐randomized design, a control group, the lack of long‐term follow‐up, and most importantly, the potential to produce a placebo effect, even though the number of patients treated was representative.
