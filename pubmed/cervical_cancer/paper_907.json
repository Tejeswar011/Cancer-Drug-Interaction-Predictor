Several family members (e.g., TMEM16A/ANO1) have already progressed into first‑in‑human trials or pre‑market diagnostic kits, underscoring the druggability of the TMEM class. Among them, TMEM98 is a multifaceted protein implicated in pivotal processes like cell growth, migration, adhesion, and intracellular signaling. TMEM98 has recently been shown to be involved in major oncogenic pathways like Wnt/β-catenin and AKT/GSK3β, and interacts with transcription factors like MYRF and NF90. Clinically, aberrant TMEM98 expression (e.g., high expression detected in 67.8% of hepatocellular carcinoma specimens, which was associated with early tumor recurrence and poorer overall and disease-free survival) correlates significantly with prognosis, tumor aggressiveness, chemoresistance, and responsiveness to therapy, making it a promising candidate for biomarker-driven personalized oncology. Such findings highlight TMEM98’s role in tumor initiation as well as tumor progression. This review integrates current information on TMEM98’s functional roles in various malignancies, ranging from lung, gastric, hepatic, ovarian, to head and neck cancer. We further discuss implications of TMEM98 gene mutations, its regulation by non-coding RNA, and its prospective role as a marker and therapeutic target within the translational pipeline. By correlating outcomes of functional assays and clinical cohorts, our goal is to reveal the TMEM98-centered regulation landscape and identify its oncological relevance.

Normally present in many tissues, it becomes dysregulated in several solid tumours. In gastric cancer, TMEM98 over-expression correlates with poor survival by stabilising its own mRNA and driving proliferation and invasion [ 3 4 5 3 6 9 3 8 6 10 5 11 12 This paper fills that void by presenting an integrated overview of TMEM98 functional dynamics in cancer, revealing its mechanistic functions, signal transduction pathway involvement, tissue-specific expression patterns, and therapeutic or diagnostic utility potential. We also indicate directions for research and translational application of TMEM98 in cancer diagnosis and treatment. In the pages that follow, we first position TMEM98 within the broader TMEM family, then outline its gene features and regulation, survey its cancer-specific roles, dissect the key signalling axes it modulates, and close with translational prospects and open questions. TMEM protein family Structural characteristics TMEM proteins are = versatile membrane sentinels, including 272 members [ 13 2 14 13 15 14 16 2 17 18 Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy and structural prediction technologies have revealed the 3D structures of several TMEMs. TMEM175 looks like a potassium channel yet picks ions its way [ 13 19 23 13 24 32 33 36 Topological diversity among TMEMs has been verified through both predictive and experimental methods. For example, TMEM30B [ 18 35 37 40 18 35 41 43 18 35 36 44 45 35 36 6 46 Biological functions Despite their conserved architecture, TMEM proteins display wide-ranging biological functionalities. They choreograph ion flow, metabolism, mechanics, and immunity [ 13 20 21 22 47 49 13 50 53 13 54 56 57 60 57 58 60 61 13 59 62 66 17 67 73 74 76 77 2 78 79 80 83 18 77 78 80 84 85 16 TMEMs in cancer Aberrant TMEM expression has been observed in various malignancies, often correlating with diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic parameters. TMEM201, for example, is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it drives cell proliferation and migration, and may serve as a biomarker of high-risk disease [ 86 45 78 80 86 87 88 TMEMs in other disorders TMEM proteins also play critical roles beyond cancer, particularly in neurological and metabolic disorders. TMEM175, a lysosomal potassium channel, mutates in Parkinson’s disease, upsetting pH and stalling α-synuclein clearance; some Chinese early-onset cases even carry combined TMEM175/TMEM163 variants [ 20 23 13 51 56 89 90 15 13 13 59 62 66 17 Molecular characteristics and functional mechanisms of TMEM98 Structure, localization, and expression profile The human TMEM98 gene, mapped to chromosome 17q11.2, encodes a conserved type II single-pass transmembrane protein composed of 226 amino acids (Fig. 1 10 91  Fig. 1 Structures of TMEM98. ( a b c d Subcellular mapping places TMEM98 at the plasma membrane, Golgi, and recycling endosomes, with a fraction secreted in exosomes [ 8 91 Regulatory molecular mechanisms TMEM98 exerts its biological effects not only through protein-level functions but also via its mRNA, which has been shown to participate in post-transcriptional regulation. In gastric cancer cells, TMEM98 mRNA harbors a specific 3′-UTR motif that binds to the NF90 protein, stabilizing NF90 and enhancing tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness [ 3 8 Of particular interest, TMEM98 forms a complex with the transcription factor MYRF, inhibiting its self-cleavage activation process. MYRF is an endoplasmic reticulum-anchored membrane transcription factor whose function depends on autoproteolysis that releases its N-terminal domain for nuclear translocation. TMEM98 binding interferes with this process, thereby modulating MYRF activity and impacting retinal development and ocular stability [ 6 10 Furthermore, TMEM98 is a central target within microRNA (miRNA) regulatory networks. For example, miR-29c-5p and miR-219-5p directly bind to the 3′-UTR of TMEM98, downregulating its expression and affecting cellular processes such as migration and wound healing in head and neck cancers and keratinocytes [ 92 93 Functional roles of TMEM98 in cancer Non-Small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) In NSCLC, TMEM98 is significantly upregulated in tumor tissues. Silencing TMEM98 via siRNA markedly inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and migration [ 94 94 1 2 94  Table 1 Functional roles of TMEM98 in cancer Tumor type Pathway Key proteins Biological role of TMEM98 Experimental Clinical Significance References Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Extracellular matrix degradation& cytoskeletal remodeling MMP-2, MMP-9, RhoC, MTA1 Promotes proliferation, invasion, and migration A549 cell, H460 cell Diagnostic and prognostic potential, Pharmacological target [ 85 Gastric cancer NF90-mediated post- transcriptional regulation (“non-coding mRNA” action) TMEM98 3’- UTR (8-nt site), NF90 Promotes proliferation via NF90 loop MKN-45 cell, SGC-7901 cell Self-reinforcing oncogenic loop [ 81 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) AKT/p53 chemoresistance axis AKT, p53, TACE response Promotes progression and chemoresistance MHCC97L cell, PLC cell, Hep3B cell, Nude mice Diagnostic and prognostic potential, Pharmacological target [ 86 87 Ovarian cancer Apoptosis & DNA-damage response Caspase-3, BaI-2, PARP (inverse correlation) Suppresses growth and angiogenesis SKOV 3 cell, IOSE 80 cell, Nude mice Diagnostic potential and therapeutic target [ 88 Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) miRNA- mediated repression miR-29c-5p→TMEM98 Promotes proliferation, silenced by miR-29c-5p FaDu cell, HSC-3 cell, Nude mice Therapeutic target [ 83 HER2 positive breast cancer - HER2, TMEM98 expression profile Marker function; not yet defined Machine learning approach Subtype-specific marker [ 89  Fig. 2 TMEM98-associated signaling pathways across various human cancers reveal its context-dependent roles in tumor biology. ( a b c d e f Gastric cancer In gastric cancer, TMEM98 exhibits an atypical regulatory pattern: its mRNA levels are significantly elevated and correlate with poor prognosis, while protein expression remains unchanged. Notably, TMEM98 mRNA directly binds to NF90, stabilizing its expression and enhancing tumor cell proliferation and invasion [ 3 2 1 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) TMEM98 has been implicated in chemoresistance in HCC. It is highly expressed in HCC tissues and is significantly associated with tumor stage, recurrence rate, overall survival, and response to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) [ 7 7 95 1 2 Ovarian cancer Contrary to its role in other cancers, TMEM98 expression is downregulated in ovarian cancer [ 96 96 2 96 1 8 97 98 98 Head and neck tumors and breast cancer In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), miR-29c-5p targets TMEM98 to suppress tumor cell proliferation and migration; mechanistic studies show that miR-29c-5p overexpression decreases TMEM98-driven cyclin-D1 and vimentin levels, arrests cells in G2/M, and reduces xenograft growth [ 92 99 1 2 TMEM98-Associated signaling pathways in cancer The diverse biological functions of TMEM98 in cancer are primarily mediated through its interaction with multiple critical signaling networks. Acting through protein-protein interactions, post-transcriptional mechanisms, and pathway modulation, TMEM98 serves as an integrative signaling hub. It plays regulatory roles in the Wnt/β-catenin and AKT/GSK3β pathways, influences MYRF activity, and participates in both NF90-mediated feedback loops and microRNA-driven regulatory circuits (Fig. 3  Fig. 3 TMEM98-Associated Signaling Pathways. ( a b c d e Suppression of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling linked to stemness and metastasis The Wnt/β-catenin axis not only drives bulk-tumor proliferation but is a linchpin for cancer-stem-cell (CSC) maintenance, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and distant colonization. TMEM98 functions as a negative modulator of this cascade by targeting FRAT2, a protein that normally enhances β-catenin stability through GSK3β inhibition. By reducing FRAT2 levels, TMEM98 diminishes β-catenin accumulation and transcriptional activity in the nucleus, thereby introducing a negative feedback mechanism that curbs Wnt signaling overactivation [ 8 3 Sustained β-catenin signaling is a hallmark of self-renewing tumor-initiating cells in gastric, colorectal, and lung cancers; pharmacologic or genetic β-catenin blockade depletes tumorsphere formation and ALDH hi + 100 101 8 102 94 Activator of the AKT/GSK3β/Cyclin D1 pathway TMEM98 contributes to cell proliferation by activating the AKT pathway. Its expression is upregulated in response to PDGF-BB stimulation in both tumor cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). This upregulation enhances Akt phosphorylation; phospho-Akt then inhibits GSK-3β via Ser9 phosphorylation, allowing Cyclin D1 to accumulate and accelerate cell-cycle progression. TMEM98 knockdown has been shown to significantly reduce proliferation and migration in both cell types [ 5 95 3 Post-Transcriptional feedback via NF90 In gastric cancer, TMEM98 engages in a non-coding RNA–protein feedback loop. Its mRNA binds directly to NF90 through a conserved sequence in its terminal exon. This interaction stabilizes NF90 protein levels, which in turn enhance the expression and stability of TMEM98 mRNA, forming a self-reinforcing feedback loop [ 3 3 Regulation of MYRF cleavage MYRF is a membrane-bound transcription factor whose activity depends on autoproteolytic cleavage in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The cleaved N-terminal fragment enters the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. TMEM98 interacts with the C-terminal region of MYRF, inhibiting its cleavage and nuclear translocation. Loss of TMEM98 results in uncontrolled MYRF activation, leading to ocular phenotypes such as axial elongation and nanophthalmos [ 6 10 3 MicroRNA regulatory networks TMEM98 is also embedded within extensive microRNA (miRNA) networks. For example, miR-219-5p is upregulated under hypoxic conditions and downregulates TMEM98 by binding to its 3′-UTR, thereby impairing keratinocyte wound healing [ 93 92 103 3 Clinical applications and translational potential of TMEM98 Tumor diagnosis and molecular subtyping TMEM98 is heterogeneously expressed across malignancies: it is up-regulated in NSCLC, gastric, liver, and head-and-neck cancers, yet down-regulated in ovarian tumors. Its expression levels are closely associated with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and overall survival, underscoring its prognostic value [ 3 7 94 99 104 103 Therapeutic target and broader clinical utility TMEM98 has demonstrated substantial therapeutic potential due to its central role in key oncogenic pathways. Gene silencing via siRNA significantly suppresses tumor growth, invasiveness, and chemoresistance in various cancer models, including NSCLC, gastric, liver, and head and neck cancers [ 3 7 92 94 6 10 Clinically, TMEM98 expression serves as a prognostic biomarker. In HCC, its elevated expression is associated with reduced survival and resistance to transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) [ 7 96 Beyond oncology, the clinical relevance extends to systemic disorders including nanophthalmos and developmental conditions mediated via MYRF interactions [ 10 105 Summary and future directions TMEM98 has revealed itself as a multifaceted transmembrane protein of great interest in tumorigenesis as well as in larger physiological regulation. TMEM98 is centrally involved in modulating various signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, AKT/GSK3β, NF90, and MYRF, influencing critical cellular behaviors like proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and treatment responsiveness. Interestingly, its regulation extends beyond protein to include mRNA interaction and microRNA-mediated control, which underlines its intricate and multi-tiered role in disease pathophysiology. Notably, current findings underscore TMEM98’s context-dependent dual roles as either a tumor suppressor or a tumor promoter. Despite significant advances, many areas remain unexplored and deserve further exploration. There is still a long way to go before TMEM98 becomes a viable clinical target. Based on our thorough literature review, we found no ongoing clinical trials or direct therapeutic approaches currently targeting TMEM98. This underlines a clear gap between basic research and clinical translation. We believe it is crucial to explore more deeply how different isoforms of TMEM98 function, as well as how its untranslated regions might regulate its behavior. Extension of the TMEM98 investigation into other tumor varieties and non-cancerous diseases will be crucial to completely chart its pathophysiological significance. In particular, the determination of functional roles of TMEM98 isoforms and untranslated regions might uncover unforeseen levels of regulation. In addition, its possible role in the immune environment, particularly in modulating tumor–immune interactions, remains to be studied systematically. For therapeutic exploitation of TMEM98, the development of specific delivery systems, e.g., RNA interference platforms or CRISPR gene editing systems, will be mandated for clinical application. High-resolution structural studies, multi-omic CRISPR screens, and single-cell spatial profiling should be coupled with organoid and conditional in vivo models to capture tissue-restricted phenotypes. Translationally, the field must optimise tumour-targeted siRNA, antisense or base-editing platforms, incorporate TMEM98 isoforms into multiplex diagnostic assays, and evaluate combinatorial strategies that pair TMEM98 inhibition with pathway-targeted drugs and immune-checkpoint blockade. In short, TMEM98 is an attractive intersection of cancer and systems biology, connecting basic molecular mechanisms to clinical implications. Its widening functional landscape places it as not only a disease-specific effector but also as an integrative biomarker for precision medicine.
