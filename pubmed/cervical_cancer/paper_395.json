Introduction Retrosternal goiters are thyroid enlargements that extend into the mediastinum and may compress adjacent structures. Although uncommon, residual thyroid tissue after total thyroidectomy can remain asymptomatic for years and present later with serious complications such as superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. Case presentation A 51-year-old woman presented with progressive facial swelling, neck vein distension, and dyspnea. She had undergone total thyroidectomy 20 years prior for multinodular goiter. Physical examination revealed facial plethora and a positive Pemberton's sign. CT imaging demonstrated a large heterogeneous mediastinal mass compressing the SVC and deviating the trachea, consistent with a retrosternal goiter. The mass was excised through a cervical approach. Histopathology confirmed benign nodular thyroid tissue. The patient had full resolution of symptoms postoperatively. Discussion This case highlights a rare but significant delayed complication of thyroidectomy. Despite previous total thyroidectomy, remnant or ectopic thyroid tissue can persist and enlarge silently over decades. Clinical clues such as Pemberton's sign are essential in recognizing thoracic inlet obstruction. Imaging confirms diagnosis and aids surgical planning. While SVC syndrome is often associated with malignancy, benign causes like substernal goiter must remain in the differential, especially in patients with thyroid surgery history. Conclusion Forgotten retrosternal goiters may present decades after thyroidectomy with life-threatening complications like SVC syndrome. Awareness of this entity, combined with careful clinical assessment and imaging, is critical to timely diagnosis and effective, minimally invasive surgical management. Highlights • First clinical manifestation of a forgotten retrosternal goiter as superior vena cava syndrome two decades after total thyroidectomy • Demonstrates the diagnostic value of Pemberton’s sign, an underutilized but effective clinical tool, in prompting imaging and identifying thoracic inlet obstruction. • Successfully managed through a cervical approach despite significant mediastinal extension, avoiding the morbidity of sternotomy and showcasing a less invasive surgical strategy. • Emphasizes the importance of considering benign etiologies in cases of SVC syndrome, especially in patients with a history of thyroid surgery, to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary aggressive interventions.

Superior vena cava syndrome occurs when blood flow through this vein is obstructed [ 1 2 3 4 Retrosternal goiter has been defined in various ways, but it is commonly described as a thyroid enlargement that extends into the mediastinum through the thoracic inlet. It represents a significant clinical entity in thyroid surgery, accounting for approximately 0.2–45 % of all thyroidectomies [ 5 6 7 Forgotten goiter refers to residual thyroid tissue discovered after total thyroidectomy, and is considered extremely rare disease. It was first described in the mid-20th century, Reports in the literature describe latency periods ranging from a few years to over 25 years, Many substernal goiters required sternotomy; however, advances in imaging and surgical techniques since the 1980s have enabled most to be removed through a cervical approach [ 8 This case is significant because it sheds light on an extremely rare and delayed complication of thyroidectomy—forgotten retrosternal goiter presenting as superior vena cava syndrome after two decades. By documenting this unusual presentation and its successful management, our goal is to raise clinical awareness about the potential for remnant thyroid tissue to cause life-threatening symptoms long after surgery. This report emphasizes the importance of thorough clinical evaluation, including physical signs like Pemberton's sign, and advocates for considering benign causes in the differential diagnosis of mediastinal masses.We highlighted the challenges encountered in managing this unique case as per the SCARE 202 Guidelines [ 9 2 Case presentation A 51-year-old woman presented to the hospital with progressive facial swelling, distended neck veins, and shortness of breath, symptoms that had developed gradually over several weeks. She reported no recent weight loss, fever, or hoarseness. Her medical history was notable for a total thyroidectomy performed 20 years earlier for a multinodular goiter, with no known history of thyroid malignancy. The initial thyroidectomy had been performed via a low cervical incision without sternotomy. At that time, the indication was a symptomatic multinodular goiter causing compressive neck symptoms and hyperthyroidism. The patient was subsequently placed on lifelong levothyroxine replacement and remained clinically stable with annual thyroid function testing. She remained asymptomatic until the recent onset of SVC syndrome. On physical examination, the patient was alert and hemodynamically stable. There was facial plethora and visible venous distension over the neck. Pemberton's sign was positive, with facial congestion occurring upon raising both arms above the head. No palpable neck mass was detected. Preoperative thyroid function tests were performed and showed values within the normal range under levothyroxine therapy. A non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was performed. Imaging revealed a large, lobulated, heterogeneous soft tissue mass extending into the superior mediastinum, consistent with a retrosternal (diving) goiter. The mass caused tracheal deviation to the right and effacement of the superior vena cava contour, suggestive of extrinsic compression. No pleural effusion, pulmonary consolidation, or mediastinal lymphadenopathy was identified ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 The substernal goiter.

Fig. 1 The patient underwent surgical excision of the mediastinal mass through a cervical approach. Intraoperatively, a large substernal goiter was identified extending into the superior mediastinum. The mass was carefully dissected and removed without complication. Gross pathological examination showed a thyroidectomy specimen measuring 9 × 7 × 4 cm and weighing 115.5 g ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 The specimen. figure legend: Gross specimen of the excised substernal goiter measuring 9 × 7 × 4 cm and weighing 115.5 g. Fig. 2 The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient's facial swelling and venous distension resolved shortly after surgery. She was discharged in stable condition and remained asymptomatic at follow-up. 3 Discussion It is highly uncommon for patients to present nearly two decades after an apparently complete thyroidectomy with symptoms attributable to residual thyroid tissue. Cases like this are rare, but they serve as an important reminder: a “total” thyroidectomy doesn't always mean every bit of thyroid tissue is gone. Sometimes, tiny remnants or even ectopic thyroid tissue can remain hidden, especially in the mediastinum, and slowly grow over the years—even in patients with normal TSH levels. In our case, the mediastinal mass was continuous with a thin remnant of cervical thyroid tissue, strongly supporting the diagnosis of a forgotten retrosternal goiter rather than an ectopic thyroid. Although prior operative documentation from the thyroidectomy two decades ago was limited, the continuity between the mediastinal mass and cervical tissue, coupled with the benign histopathology, confirms that this represents a remnant thyroid enlargement rather than an ectopic focus. In this case, the patient gradually developed symptoms that pointed toward superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome—facial swelling, shortness of breath, and visibly distended neck veins. In our case, despite the presence of mediastinal thyroid tissue, the patient remained clinically euthyroid on standard replacement therapy, suggesting that the residual goiter had no functional activity. These signs can easily be overlooked or attributed to other causes, particularly when there's no obvious neck mass. Most of us are trained to think of malignancies like lung cancer or lymphoma when we see SVC syndrome, since those are far more common and often more urgent. But benign causes, like a substernal goiter, should stay on the differential—especially when there's a history of thyroid surgery [ 10 A key factor that contributed to the diagnosis in this case was a thorough physical examination. Pemberton's sign—raising the patient's arms and watching for facial flushing or cyanosis—is an old-school clinical test that's often forgotten. In this case, it provided an essential clinical clue. A positive Pemberton's sign pointed to thoracic inlet obstruction and prompted timely imaging, helping avoid further delays in diagnosis [ 11 12 The CT scan made the picture clear. It showed a large, heterogeneous mass in the superior mediastinum compressing the SVC and shifting the trachea. What confirmed its thyroid origin was its continuity with a sliver of residual thyroid tissue in the neck. That connection was essential—not only for making the right diagnosis but also for guiding the surgical approach [ 13 Even though the goiter extended well into the chest, the surgical team was able to remove it entirely through a cervical incision. Avoiding a sternotomy conferred significant benefits, including reduced surgical trauma and a shorter recovery period. With the right imaging and experienced hands, many large substernal goiters can be managed safely and effectively without opening the chest [ 14 15 Ensuring the completeness of thyroidectomy, particularly in cases with retrosternal extension, remains a critical surgical challenge. Comprehensive preoperative evaluation with high-resolution imaging, including CT and occasionally intraoperative ultrasound, is essential to delineate the full extent of thyroid tissue and guide operative planning. During surgery, meticulous capsular dissection combined with careful exploration of the thoracic inlet can minimize the likelihood of leaving behind remnants or missing ectopic thyroid tissue. Intraoperative vigilance, including the use of frozen section analysis in select cases, may further reduce the risk of incomplete resection. Finally, given that even a “total” thyroidectomy may not guarantee complete removal, long-term surveillance—through clinical follow-up, thyroid function monitoring, and, when indicated, imaging—plays a vital role in detecting delayed recurrence or persistence before the development of compressive symptoms. The final pathology brought welcome news: benign nodular emphasizes with no evidence of cancer. Although malignancies are the predominant cause of SVC syndrome, several benign conditions have been reported, including fibrosing mediastinitis, mediastinal infections, vascular thrombosis, and benign intrathoracic tumors. This underscores an important takeaway—not all mediastinal masses causing SVC syndrome are malignant. A careful, thorough workup can prevent unnecessary interventions and reduce patient anxiety [ 16 This case underscores several important clinical insights. First, even after a “total” thyroidectomy, tiny bits of tissue can be left behind and cause problems years later. Second, subtle clinical signs—like Pemberton's sign—still have value, especially when combined with a good patient history and targeted imaging. And third, thoughtful planning and collaboration between specialties can lead to less invasive, safer, and more effective care. In the end, this case is a reminder that medicine isn't always straightforward. Being open to the unexpected, paying attention to small details, and using both clinical skills and modern tools can make all the difference in patient outcomes. 4 Conclusion This case exemplifies the unpredictability of post-thyroidectomy outcomes, highlighting the potential for residual thyroid tissue to undergo silent growth over decades. The late presentation as superior vena cava syndrome emphasizes the need for vigilance in long-term follow-up, particularly in patients with a history of thyroid surgery. Effective diagnosis hinged on recognizing subtle clinical signs and leveraging imaging to differentiate benign from malignant causes. The successful management through a cervical approach reinforces the role of careful surgical planning in optimizing patient recovery while minimizing procedural invasiveness.
