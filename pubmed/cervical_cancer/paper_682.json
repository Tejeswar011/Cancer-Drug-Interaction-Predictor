When disrupted, they can lead to increased mutation rate and contribute to the cancerogenesis. On the other hand, cancer cells that bear mutations in genes involved in DNA repair are more prone to DNA damaging insults which opens opportunities for treatments involving synthetic lethality. microRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate expression by binding to gene transcripts and inducing mRNA degradation or inhibition of translation. Here, we review the miRNA-mediated dysregulation of genes involved in DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair pathways in ovarian cancer (OvCa), one of the deadliest female malignancy. We also discuss miRNAs, which affect response to OvCa therapy by regulating PARP1 (Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1), a central gene of the OvCa synthetic lethality treatments. Finally, we address the limitations of miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers and potential targets for therapeutic interventions. Abstract Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is one of the most life-threatening female malignancies that affects 300,000 women annually worldwide. Impaired mechanisms of DNA repair are the leading cause of mutations underlying the OvCa development. microRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate the expression of genes by binding to their transcripts and inducing mRNA degradation or inhibition of translation. Here, we review the miRNA-mediated dysregulation of genes involved in DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair pathways in OvCa. Apparently, miRNAs are capable of targeting the crucial mediators of DDR (e.g., miR-203a-3p targeting ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated)), homologous repair (such as BRCA1 targeted by miR-9, miR-1255b, miR-193b, and miR-148b), non-homologous end joining (with RNF8 being regulated by miR-214), nucleotide excision repair (involving DDB2 targeted by miR-328-3p), or translesion DNA synthesis (involving RAD18, participating also in homologous repair and targeted by miR-379-5p). We also discuss miRNAs (such as miR-519a-3p, let-7e, miR-216b), which affect responses to OvCa therapy by targeting PARP1 (Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1). Finally, we also discuss why, despite the identification of multiple miRNAs capable of regulating DNA repair genes, as well as those involved in the response to therapy, no miRNA-based drugs have been approved for OvCa treatment in clinics. microRNA ovarian cancer DNA repair PARP1 olaparib BRCA1/2 This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is among the deadliest malignancies, affecting over 300,000 women annually worldwide and resulting in more than 200,000 deaths each year [ 1 2 3 4 1 2 The most critical non-modifiable risk factors for ovarian cancer are germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. While fewer than 1% of individuals in the general population carry these mutations, their prevalence among women diagnosed with high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is approximately 20–25%. BRCA1/2 mutations are estimated to account for approximately 25% of all OvCa cases. In contrast, modifiable risk factors—such as obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity—are thought to contribute to approximately 10% of cases. Among modifiable protective factors, breastfeeding has been associated with a reduced risk, potentially preventing 4–5% of OvCa cases [ 1 2 2 At the molecular level, OvCa is characterised by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in DNA repair processes. The most common molecular aberrations underlying OvCa development are germline mutations in genes responsible for homologous recombination, a key DNA repair mechanism. In particular, BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are associated with an estimated 61% and 24% lifetime risk, respectively, of developing OvCa—especially high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) [ 1 1 The critical role of DNA repair in ovarian cancer (OvCa) is underscored by the clinical success of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, particularly in patients with BRCA-mutated tumours. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, have demonstrated a high initial response rate of approximately 80% in this patient population [ 2 5 6 7 2 Human cells express approximately 2600 microRNAs (miRNAs), which are predicted to regulate over 60% of the protein-coding genes [ 8 8 The global interest in RNA-based therapeutics has grown significantly, particularly following the success of RNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. This momentum has extended to miRNA-targeting strategies. Although an increasing number of clinical trials are investigating miRNA-based therapeutics, none have yet received regulatory approval from the FDA or EMA [ 9 In this review, we focus on miRNAs that regulate DNA repair pathways in ovarian cancer, as these molecules hold considerable promise as clinically relevant diagnostic and predictive biomarkers, as well as potential therapeutic targets. 2. DNA Repair Mechanisms in OvCa: Role of miRNAs Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is characterised by alterations in all major DNA damage repair (DDR) mechanisms. These include direct reversal repair (DR), mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), and double-strand break (DSB) repair via both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In addition, DNA damage response (DDR)-associated processes, such as chromatin remodelling, checkpoint signalling, and the TP53 pathway, are frequently disrupted in OvCa cells ( Figure 1 10 11 The DDR encompasses a network of pathways that detect DNA lesions, activate checkpoint signalling cascades to arrest the cell cycle, mediate repair of damaged DNA, and activate senescence or cell death. It involves proteins that act as sensors of DNA damage, transducers of intracellular signals, and effectors that execute DNA repair. DDR activation enables the recruitment of repair pathways tailored to the type of lesion. Traditionally, DDR is described in the context of cell response to SSBs and DSBs that are resolved by single-strand break repair (SSBR) or DSB repair (DSBR) mechanisms, including classical NHEJ, alternative NHEJ, and single-strand annealing (SSA) [ 12 2.1. miRNAs Targeting Transcripts of DNA Repair-Related Genes: Roles in OvCa Tumorigenesis Dysregulated expression of miRNAs targeting genes involved in DNA repair may directly contribute to ovarian cancer (OvCa) tumorigenesis ( Table 1 ATM (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated), a serine/threonine protein kinase, plays a central role in the DNA damage response (DDR), especially in the response to double-strand breaks (DSBs). ATM-mediated phosphorylation of key DSB repair proteins facilitates their interaction and promotes the assembly of large multiprotein repair complexes [ 69 23 Another key DDR gene is CHEK2 (Checkpoint Kinase 2), encoding a serine/threonine kinase, which is a downstream target of ATM. Upon phosphorylation by ATM, CHEK2 activates multiple substrates, including those involved in cell cycle arrest. This, in turn, allows time for DNA repair prior to progression through the cell cycle. Owing to its role in inhibiting uncontrolled proliferation and supporting genomic stability, CHEK2 is considered a tumour suppressor. In osteosarcoma and breast cancer cells, CHEK2 is targeted by several miRNAs, including miR-191 [ 26 28 27 70 30 71 SNP34091 59 60 58 72 34 46 52 40 45 52 57 TP53 40 41 MBD4 (Methyl-CpG Binding Domain Protein 4, also known as MED1) is a mismatch-specific DNA N-glycosylase involved in base excision repair (BER). It acts as a thymine and uracil glycosylase, specifically repairing G:T mismatches that arise from the spontaneous deamination of 5′-methylcytosine (5mC). Germline mutations in MBD4 are associated with a multi-tumour predisposition syndrome, which includes ovarian granulosa cell tumours [ 73 13 14 FEN1 (Flap Structure-Specific Endonuclease 1) is involved in both DNA replication and repair. It plays a critical role in the rapid repair of SSBs [ 74 75 16 17 76 77 OvCa tumours also aberrantly overexpress miR-210, a well-known oncogenic miRNA that promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumour growth. In breast cancer, miR-210 has been shown to target RAD52, a key mediator of HR and SSA [ 19 64 65 78 79 DDB2 (Damage-Specific DNA Binding Protein 2) is a crucial component of the UV-DDB complex, which recognises DNA lesions induced by ultraviolet light and recruits nucleotide excision repair (NER) machinery [ 80 81 82 82 83 83 84 85 86 87 88 2.2. miRNAs Targeting Transcripts of DNA Repair-Related Genes: Roles in OvCa Therapy and Chemoresistance Multiple in vitro and preclinical in vivo studies have demonstrated that miRNAs associated with DNA repair play a significant role in modulating OvCa response to therapeutic interventions, contributing to both chemotherapy resistance and sensitivity ( Table 2 8 2.2.1. miRNAs Targeting PARP1 PARP1 (Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1) encodes a poly(ADP-ribosyl)transferase that catalyses the post-translational modification of proteins involved in DNA repair. During the PARP1-mediated reaction, an ADP-D-ribosyl group is transferred from NAD + PARP1 has emerged as a central therapeutic target in OvCa, particularly in patients harbouring BRCA mutations. In the context of DNA repair, PARP1 detects and binds to SSBs, triggering its auto-PARylation. This modification facilitates the recruitment of key DNA repair proteins, including XRCC1 (a scaffold protein), DNA polymerase β (Polβ), and DNA ligase III (LigIII), thereby enabling the efficient repair of DNA lesions [ 132 133 134 PARP1 is considered an oncogenic protein in ovarian cancer. Elevated PARP1 expression is associated with poor patient survival and contributes to increased cell viability, migration, invasion, and tube formation in OvCa cells. Notably, PARP1 is directly targeted by miR-519a-3p, whose expression is downregulated in OvCa tumours. This reduction facilitates upregulation of PARP1, thereby enhancing its oncogenic functions [ 15 135 90 91 111 Section 4 2.2.2. miRNAs Targeting Other Genes Involved in DNA Repair The most critical genetically determined risk factors for ovarian cancer (OvCa) are germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, which result in dysfunction of DNA repair mechanisms. BRCA1 (BRCA1 DNA Repair Associated, also known as Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Protein) and BRCA2 (BRCA2 DNA Repair Associated, or Breast Cancer Type 2 Susceptibility Protein) encode proteins that function as E3 ubiquitin ligases. These proteins interact with and recruit multiple components of the homologous recombination (HR) and Fanconi anaemia pathways, supporting DNA end resection and protecting nascent DNA strands during repair [ 136 137 138 139 120 63 140 141 142 142 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 93 93 miR-211 targets several DNA repair genes, including POLH, a specialised TLS DNA polymerase involved in UV-induced lesion bypass, TDP1, a tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase that is an end processor implicated in SSBR and DSBR, ATRX, a chromatin remodeler, MRPS11, a mitochondrial ribosomal protein, and ERCC6L2, an NHEJ helicase in human embryonic kidney cells. Higher miR-211 levels allow for better prediction of response in OvCa patients to platinum compounds [ 89 miR-506-3p targets RAD51, a DNA recombinase essential for homologous recombination (HR), where it promotes strand invasion and exchange between homologous DNA sequences [ 79 143 128 144 129 Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1) are the key components of the DNA damage response (DDR). They play essential roles in sensing SSBs and coordinating cell cycle arrest to facilitate repair. Several studies have demonstrated that inhibition of ATR and CHEK1 can synergize with PARP1 inhibition, yielding enhanced therapeutic effects in preclinical OvCa models [ 145 146 92 147 Interestingly, several miRNAs are implicated in modulating chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, although the specific gene targets mediating these effects remain largely unidentified. One such example is miR-125a-3p. Combined treatment of ovarian cancer (OvCa) cells with olaparib and cisplatin has been shown to increase miR-125a-3p expression. Overexpression of miR-125a-3p in OvCa cells leads to elevated levels of DNA damage, as indicated by increased accumulation of γ-H2AX, a phosphorylated form of histone H2AX that is rapidly induced in response to DNA damage, particularly double-strand breaks (DSBs) [ 102 102 ERCC2 (ERCC Excision Repair 2, TFIIH Core Complex Helicase Subunit) is an ATP-dependent 5′–3′ DNA helicase involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Expression of miR-770-5p is reduced in OvCa tumours resistant to chemotherapy, and low miR-770-5p levels correlate with poor patient survival. Overexpression of miR-770-5p enhances cisplatin sensitivity in OvCa cells. These effects are mediated by ERCC2, a direct target of miR-770-5p, as demonstrated by ERCC2 silencing. The latter replicated the increased cisplatin sensitivity observed with miR-770-5p overexpression. Furthermore, either increased miR-770-5p expression or decreased ERCC2 levels impaired the repair of DNA damage induced by cisplatin treatment [ 103 Cisplatin resistance in OvCa is also modulated by several miRNAs that regulate the expression of genes involved in the MMR pathway. miR-590-5p has been shown to directly target and downregulate MSH2 (MutS Homolog 2), a core component of the MMR system. MSH2 forms heterodimers with MSH6 or MSH3 to generate complexes that recognise mismatched DNA, bend the DNA helix, and recruit downstream repair factors [ 148 105 22 106 107 107 Paclitaxel resistance in OvCa might be mediated by miRNAs targeting DNA repair genes, including miR-630 that targets RAD18 and PANCG in liver cancer cells, miR-194-5p targeting MDM2, and miR-185 targeting ATR in renal cancer cells [ 99 115 119 A number of other miRNAs that are dysregulated in OvCa have been shown to target DNA repair genes in other cancer types. For example, miR-449a has been reported to target EME1 and downregulate BRCA2 and RAD51 in breast cancer ( Table 2 Table 1 3. miRNAs Regulated by Proteins Involved in DNA Damage Repair miRNAs not only regulate the expression of genes involved in DNA repair signalling pathways, but their own expression can also be modulated by DNA repair-related genes. DDX1 is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase that facilitates the unwinding of RNA–RNA and RNA–DNA duplexes. Intriguingly, DDX1 has been identified as a regulator of miRNA expression following DNA damage in OvCa cells. Specifically, DDX1 facilitates the recruitment of primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) to Drosha, the catalytic subunit of the Microprocessor complex responsible for the nuclear cleavage of pri-miRNAs into precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). As a result, DDX1 promotes the maturation and expression of multiple miRNAs, particularly members of the miR-200 family, which are known to regulate epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Upon DNA damage, DDX1 is phosphorylated by ATM kinase and recruited to sites of DNA lesions. In OvCa, the expression of miR-200 family members is reduced, and DDX1 functions as a tumour suppressor by promoting miR-200 expression and thereby inhibiting EMT, invasion, and metastasis [ 24 149 150 4. Limitations and Challenges The promising results of in vitro and preclinical studies demonstrating the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of miRNAs have prompted numerous clinical trials investigating their efficacy in the detection and treatment of both cancerous and non-cancerous diseases. At the time of writing this review, a search of ClinicalTrials.gov using the terms ‘ovarian cancer’ and ‘microRNA’ yielded 22 results ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=Ovarian%20Cancer&term=microRNA 8 151 8 151 151 152 The perspectives of miRNAs as diagnostic tools are much more promising. Although no miRNA-based diagnostic tools have yet been approved specifically for OvCa diagnosis or monitoring, several clinically validated and/or commercially available miRNA-based tests are already implemented in hospital settings. One notable example is GASTROClear™, which has been approved by the Singapore Health Sciences Authority and received the FDA Breakthrough Device Designation in the United States. This test employs qPCR-based analysis of 12 circulating blood miRNAs for the early detection of gastric cancer in high-risk individuals ( https://mirxes.com/mirxes-receives-fdas-breakthrough-device-designation-for-gastroclear-to-advance-blood-based-cancer-early-detection Other miRNA-based diagnostic assays still await regulatory approval. These include the hepato-miR ® https://www.tamirna.com/hepatomir-kit-ce-ivd/ https://www.mirnascientific.com As with all biomarkers, the clinical utility of circulating miRNAs depends on several critical factors. These include miRNA stability, specificity, and the standardisation of analytical workflows. miRNAs detectable in biofluids, such as serum, plasma, urine, or saliva, exhibit remarkable stability, largely attributed to their encapsulation within extracellular vesicles (e.g., exosomes) or their association with stabilising proteins, such as Argonaute 2 (Ago2). miRNAs are generally considered highly stable molecules; for instance, deep-frozen miRNAs can remain intact for up to two years. Nevertheless, some studies have raised concerns regarding the impact of repeated freeze–thaw cycles on miRNA integrity in serum samples [ 153 Technical challenges in miRNA biomarker analysis primarily stem from the lack of standardisation across all procedural steps, including biofluid collection, sample storage, RNA isolation, and quantification methods. These inconsistencies can significantly affect the reproducibility and reliability of miRNA measurements [ 153 154 5. Conclusions Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is one of the tumour types most strongly associated with dysfunction in DNA repair pathways. This association is particularly evident in hereditary OvCa cases, which frequently result from germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. miRNAs constitute a critical component of the molecular landscape of OvCa, contributing to tumour initiation, progression, and resistance to therapy. At least some of these effects are mediated through direct regulation of DNA repair genes, which serve as validated miRNA targets—for example, miR-203a-3p targeting ATM and miR-519a-3p targeting PARP1. The number of miRNAs involved in DNA repair dysfunction in OvCa may be substantially higher, pending experimental validation of predicted interactions—such as miR-196a with MBD4, or miR-191 and miR-182-5p with CHEK2. Similarly, the mechanistic targets of miRNAs that have been shown to influence DNA damage but lack confirmed gene targets—such as miR-125a-3p—should be systematically identified. Crucially, the functional relevance of miRNA–target interactions must be examined in both in vitro and in vivo models to determine their true impact on the efficacy of DNA repair processes. In conclusion, miRNAs that regulate DNA repair genes represent promising candidates for future clinical applications in OvCa, both as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers and as therapeutic targets. However, further research is essential to develop safe, effective, and targeted miRNA-based therapeutics or biomarkers tailored specifically to the complex biology of ovarian cancer.
