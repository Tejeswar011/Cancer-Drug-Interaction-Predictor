Highlights • NTM infections are rising globally, with increasing pulmonary and extrapulmonary cases. • Molecular techniques like DNA probes and gene sequencing enable precise NTM identification. • NTM transmission through water systems and aerosol inhalation remains a significant risk. Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are emerging pathogens responsible for a growing spectrum of diseases, particularly in individuals with underlying lung disorders or immune suppression. Once considered primarily environmental saprophytes, NTM are now recognized as important causes of pulmonary, cutaneous, lymphatic, and disseminated infections. With more than 200 species identified and regional variations in prevalence, their diagnosis and management present significant clinical and microbiological challenges. The lack of standardized reporting systems and overlapping features with tuberculosis complicate epidemiological understanding and case identification. This review provides an updated and integrated overview of NTM-associated diseases, emphasizing diagnostic advancements, environmental sources, mechanisms of transmission, host immunity, genetic susceptibility, and therapeutic options. Special attention is given to molecular diagnostic techniques, species-level identification strategies, and the role of gene sequencing in differentiating NTM species. We also highlight the limitations of conventional methods, discuss antimicrobial resistance mechanisms, and summarize current treatment guidelines. By synthesizing current knowledge across microbiology, clinical medicine, and public health, this review aims to support a multidisciplinary approach to NTM diagnosis and management and address the pressing need for increased awareness, better surveillance, and targeted research on this under-recognized group of pathogens.

The annual rate of NTM infections and diseases has risen by approximately 4.0 % and 4.1 % per 100,000 persons per year, respectively, with notable increases in infections caused by the MAC and MABC. Table 2 18 Table 2 Recent epidemiological estimates of nontuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) in general and high-risk populations. Table 2 Region/Population Measurement Value United States (general population) Pulmonary NTM disease prevalence 13.9 per 100,000 (2013 data) Germany (2009–2014) Pulmonary NTM disease prevalence 3.3 per 100,000 Japan (2001–2009) Pulmonary NTM disease incidence 10.1 per 100,000 Republic of Korea (age-adjusted, 2016) NTM infection prevalence 33.3 per 100,000 Australia (2000) NTM pulmonary disease prevalence 0.56 per 100,000 Queensland, Australia (2005) NTM pulmonary disease prevalence 3.2 per 100,000 New Zealand (2004) NTM pulmonary disease prevalence 1.17 per 100,000 Adults with non-CF bronchiectasis Global NTM prevalence ≈ 10 %–14 % CF patients, USA (2010–2019) NTM pulmonary infection prevalence 58 per 1,000 persons tested; ↑3.5 % per year Abbreviations Contextualize trends and key findings  • Growing burden • Geographic disparities • Comorbidity risk group • Cystic fibrosis (CF) 19 20 21 4 NTM in the environment NTMs are globally distributed and widely present in the environment. Their survival and persistence are supported by several physiological traits—most notably cell surface hydrophobicity, which facilitates surface attachment, aerosolization via air bubbles, and resistance to antimicrobials. Additional survival mechanisms include biofilm formation, association with amoebae, and chlorine resistance, all of which contribute to their persistence in water distribution systems. 22 23 24 25 26 , 27 Geographic variation in NTM distribution is significant—California and Hawaii are hotspots for pulmonary NTM disease in the USA. An environmental study in Hawaii found NTMs in 27 % of samples, primarily species of clinical concern such as M. chimaera, M. chelonae M. abscessus 28 , 29 5 Mechanism of transmission The presence of NTM in natural and constructed drinking water distribution systems has been extensively documented. Consequently, aerosol inhalation from urban or personal water systems is believed to be a significant route of acquisition. 30 , 31 32 27 , 33 , 34 M. abscessus massiliense 2 M. kansasii 34 35 36 28 , 29 6 Pathogenesis and virulence factors The capacity of a microbe to bind fibronectin may promote its colonization of the host by facilitating its attachment to the extracellular matrix in areas of epithelial damage. The process of fibronectin attachment is facilitated by a protein known as fibronectin attachment protein (FAP), which is necessary for the efficient attachment and invasion of epithelial cells by M. avium paratuberculosis M. avium 37 38 39 38 , 40 It is well established that the virulence of NTM can vary significantly between different species. For instance, the MAC has been observed to demonstrate a higher degree of pathogenicity in comparison to M. avium 31 M. tuberculosis 37 , 41 , 42 7 Risk factors Risk factors for human infection include Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), α−1-antitrypsin deficiency, CF, heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and immunodeficiency due to HIV infection. 42 IFNGR1, IFNGR2, IL12RB1, IL12B, STAT1 43 SLC11A1 (NRAMP1) NRAMP1 M. bovis 26 , 31 , 42 , 44 45 46 7.1 Climatic conditions Recent research has advanced our understanding of environmental risks related to NTM, showing how climate and environmental factors influence their distribution. Studies from the University of Colorado reveal specific pH and temperature conditions favor different NTM species, which can be predictive of their presence and virulence. Community science initiatives in high-incidence areas like Hawaii have facilitated broader sampling in natural and indoor environments, highlighting the need to explore potential NTM exposure sources in built settings, such as plumbing and aerosols. 47 , 48 The incidence of NTM is rising globally, with notable increases in Canada and the USA. linked to factors like trace metals in municipal water supplies, which may enhance mycobacterial metabolism and human susceptibility. Additionally, environmental minerals like calcium and molybdenum have been associated with higher pulmonary NTM infection risks. 49 M. avium 48 50 A 2020 Queensland study (2001–2016) found a nearly 2.3-fold increase in NTM incidence (from 11.1 to 25.9 per 100,000), with strong correlations to temperature and rainfall variations—though effects varied by species and region. 51 50 52 53 7.2 Host immunity and genetic susceptibility In immunocompetent individuals, NTM are often regarded as commensal bacteria and considered to be unlikely pathogens. Several studies have highlighted the role of genetic susceptibility, particularly mutations in the CFTR CFTR 54 55 56 57 M. tuberculosis 30 , 58 STAT1 The efficacy of the BCG vaccine in preventing tuberculosis varies significantly among different regions, ranging from 0 % to 89 %. Some have posited that populations with lower BCG vaccine efficacy may exhibit a higher prevalence of cross-reactive NTM. Notably, in certain countries, such as northern and eastern Europe, where the BCG vaccination program has been discontinued, there has been an observed increase in NTM lymphadenitis among children. However, there is a paucity of research addressing the prevalence of NTM infections in the context of the BCG vaccination program, highlighting the need for further investigation to elucidate the role of the BCG vaccination in the epidemiology of NTM infections. 58 59 60 8 Nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases For many years, it was thought that NTM were implicated in human disease only as saprophytic contaminants in tuberculous lesions. However, recent advancements in the field have led to the recognition of several species as facultative parasites capable of inducing chronic granulomatous diseases that can be pathologically indistinguishable from tuberculosis. These infections, however, remain challenging to identify due to the complexity of distinguishing the causative bacteria from M. tuberculosis 61 , 62 The global impact of NTM diseases is not well understood, primarily because most NTM infections do not require mandatory reporting, except for specific cases like M. chimaera M. ulcerans 63 While NTMs were initially detected in the late 19th century, their role as significant human pathogens gained broader acknowledgment only in the late 1950s. 36 64 Diseases in humans caused by NTM are categorized into four main clinical types: chronic lung disease, lymphadenitis, skin infections, and widespread disseminated disease. 1 65 , 66 67 8.1 Localized cutaneous lesions The injection of organisms into superficial abrasions and puncture wounds can result in the formation of localized nodular or ulcerative lesions. The organisms most commonly implicated are M. marinum M. ulcerans M. haemophilum M. chelonae and M. fortuitum. 68 8.2 Lymphadenitis NTM-related lymphadenitis occurs most commonly in children under the age of five and typically presents as a unilateral, chronic, and self-limiting cervical lymph node enlargement. The most frequently involved site is the submandibular lymph nodes, which account for approximately 87 % of cases. 69 M. scrofulaceum, M. kansasii M. fortuitum 38 70 8.3 Disseminated disease The development of granulomatous disease, characterized by the presence of one or multiple foci, has been observed in virtually any system or organ. In cases where cellular immunity is compromised, the dissemination of the infection can occur with a rapidity comparable to that observed in miliary tuberculosis. The majority of these cases have been attributed to the MAC and M. chelonae + 3 30 , 71 8.4 Pulmonary disease Among the four principal clinical manifestations of NTM infections, pulmonary disease (NTM‑PD) is the most common and clinically significant form. 72 M. kansasii M. xenopi 73 , 74 M. scrofulaceum, M. chelonae, M. szulgai M. malmoense 75 76 , 77 8.5 Clinical manifestations of NTM pulmonary disease Pulmonary NTM disease presents in several distinct clinical-radiologic patterns, with the two most recognized being the nodular–bronchiectatic and fibrocavitary forms. The nodular–bronchiectatic form appears predominantly in postmenopausal women without prior lung disease—often referred to as “Lady Windermere syndrome”—and is typified by chronic cough with sputum, occasional hemoptysis, and fatigue. Characteristic imaging on high-resolution CT includes centrilobular nodules and multifocal bronchiectasis localized to the middle lobe and lingula. 76 Other less common presentations include solitary pulmonary nodules resembling malignancy, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (“hot tub lung”), and disseminated infection in immunocompromised hosts. 78 79 80 38 These criteria provide a practical framework for confirming NTM lung disease and distinguishing infection from colonization. 9 Diagnosis of NTM infections 9.1 Laboratory and radiologic detection For the detection of NTM, staining and culture methods are primary laboratory techniques. Acid-fast staining methods, such as Ziehl-Neelsen or fluorochrome (auramine) staining, are used to identify acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in clinical samples. AFB staining cannot distinguish between M. tuberculosis 38 , 81 Radiologically, imaging typically reveals nodular-bronchiectatic or fibrocavitary patterns. For diagnosing NTM-PD, sputum samples are usually sufficient for the fibrocavitary form, but BAL culture is more sensitive for the nodular bronchiectatic form. Microbiologically, culturing mycobacteria in both liquid and solid media at 37°C enhances diagnostic sensitivity, and obtaining at least three respiratory samples is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. In nodular bronchiectatic disease, where bacterial load is generally lower, studies have shown that BAL culture sensitivity exceeds that of sputum culture. 81 82 83 Table 3 84 , 85 Table 3 Diagnostic methods and criteria for NTM-PD. Table 3 Method Advantages Limitations Clinical + Imaging Symptoms (cough, weight loss, haemoptysis) + HRCT showing nodules, cavities, bronchiectasis help select patients for testing. Findings are nonspecific; overlap with TB, cancer; requires microbiological confirmation. AFB Smear (Microscopy) Rapid, low-cost; suggests organism burden (higher smear positivity correlates with worse outcomes). Low sensitivity; cannot differentiate NTM vs. M. tuberculosis Culture (Solid/Liquid media) Gold standard; allows species ID & DST; enables multiple sampling (≥ 2 sputa or 1 BAL). Slow growth—weeks for results; requires multiple specimens; risk of contamination. Histology from Biopsy Provides granulomatous confirmation; helpful if culture negative but pathology positive. Invasive; requires specialized procedure; may miss organisms; culture still needed. Molecular methods (PCR, Gene sequencing: 16S rRNA, hsp65, rpoB High specificity; rapid species/subspecies ID; macrolide-resistance detection in M. abscessus High cost; limited available probes (commercial kits may miss rare species); moderate sensitivity direct from samples. MALDI-TOF MS Fast and cost-effective once available; good species-level ID in culture. Dependent on quality of spectrum database; may misidentify closely related species. Culture-free PCR/sequencing Rapid detection (∼days); direct from specimens; avoids slow culture. Limited sensitivity (29 %–76 % detection vs. culture); restricted to common species. Abbreviations Because NTMs are ubiquitous in the environment and can contaminate clinical specimens from non-sterile sites, the diagnosis of NTM infection can be challenging. Contamination can occur before, during, and even after specimen collection. For example, collected sputum samples may be contaminated if rinsed in the mouth with tap water prior to expectoration. Contamination of the fibrotic bronchoscope suction channel with M. chelonae 86 , 87 9.2 Molecular identification of NTM species Correct species identification is very important because NTM species differ in their clinical relevance. The limitations of conventional methods in the identification of mycobacteria have led to the development of molecular techniques that have the advantage of being rapid, sensitive, and specific. Molecular techniques—particularly gene sequencing and line probe assays—have now replaced traditional biochemical methods based on mycolic acid analysis as the preferred strategy for NTM identification. 41 5 , 88 M. kansasii M. gordonae hsp65 rpoB 89 90 91 rpoB, hsp65 16S rRNA 92 93 94 The widespread use of these methods has also led to the discovery of new species and the taxonomic reclassification of others, increasing the number of NTM species. 4 , 88 , 95 , 96 M. tuberculosis 97 Table 4 Table 4 Summary of different molecular techniques for NTM analysis. 7 Table 4 Method Description Key Features Repetitive sequences involving NTM Utilizes insertion sequences (e.g., IS1245, IS1311) for molecular typing, highlighting genomic diversity among NTM strains. Distinct IS types relevant to MAC strains; useful for epidemiological studies and differentiating specific strains like M. avium paratuberculosis Trinucleotide repeat sequence (TRS) Found within mycobacterial genomes and aids in genotyping via PGRS-RFLP methods for species differentiation. Improves resolution in genotyping; occurs within PE and PPE gene families; supports comparative strain analysis. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) ERIC sequences introduce variability for ERIC-PCR typing across mycobacterial species, enhancing insights into genetic diversity. Characteristics include imperfect palindromic sequences; strengthens molecular epidemiology and phylogenetic understanding. Multilocus variable number of tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) Examines tandem repeat regions in the NTM genome, supporting strain differentiation and phylogenetic analysis. Utilizes MPTR and ETR sequences; high discriminatory capacity; well-suited for various NTM species. Repetitive element palindromic PCR (Rep-PCR) Creates strain-specific DNA profiles using an arbitrary primer, effective for strain analysis despite reproducibility issues. Matches or exceeds pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) power for species prone to fragmentation; can be used for genotyping. Genome Analysis Involves comprehensive analysis of an organism's complete genome, offering insights into genetic variations. Provides detailed strain characteristics and evolutionary links; highlights regulatory elements. PFGE Employs restriction enzyme digestion for DNA fragment pattern generation, useful for typing slow-growing NTM species. High repeatability and exceptional separation capacity, suited for epidemiological studies despite high costs and long processing times. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) Similar to Rep-PCR, this technique generates strain-specific profiles with limitations in reproducibility. Effective for strain analysis; rivals PFGE's discriminatory powers, though reliability issues exist. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) Utilizes dual restriction enzymes to distinguish closely related mycobacterial species. Offers refined tools for differentiation, particularly for closely related species like M. hemophilum Large sequence polymorphism (LSP) Acts as a molecular marker for mycobacterial genetic diversity, employing targeted PCR and microarray technology. Generates genomic insights but requires significant DNA amounts and targeting optimization for various NTM subtypes. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) Provides precise mycobacterial species identification and insights into evolutionary paths and virulence genes. Facilitates identification of new species and outbreak mapping with high accuracy; predicts virulence-related genes. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) Advances in high-throughput sequencing aiding in NTM detection and genetic analysis. Rapid and efficient, bypasses traditional culture limitations while detecting novel species. Targeted next-generation sequencing (tNGS) Focuses on specific genes for identifying virulence and resistance factors crucial for treatment strategies. More cost-effective and faster than WGS, though may overlook variants outside targeted areas. Macrolide and rifampin resistance Resistance primarily results from genetic mutations in 23S rRNA and the rpoB erm M. abscessus Clinical applications of molecular techniques Advances in detection and genotyping of NTM species enable understanding of antimicrobial resistance patterns. Techniques include MLVA, Rep-PCR, WGS, and NGS for accurate species identification and tailored treatment strategies. Revolutionizing NTM classification and phylogeny Molecular techniques like 16S rRNA Integration of genomic methods allows for precise species classification and valuable phylogenetic insights. Integration of advanced diagnosis technologies Technologies like MALDI-TOF MS improve NTM identification while facing challenges in complex samples. MALDI-TOF MS is rapid for pure cultures. Abbreviations M. avium Simultaneously, advances in molecular diagnostics are revolutionizing the clinical management of NTM infections. A recent multicenter study evaluating 115 clinical samples found that metagenomic next-generation sequencing demonstrated 44.3 % sensitivity, targeted NGS 42.6 %, and multiplex PCR 36.5 %; when combined, these methods achieved a sensitivity of 54.8 %, with approximately 80 % concordance at the species level and 45 % at the subspecies level. 98 Further, a 2024 review emphasized the clinical value of rapid molecular platforms, including targeted NGS, metagenomic next-generation sequencing, and nanopore sequencing, in identifying NTM species and subspecies directly from respiratory specimens within days. These technologies not only expedite diagnosis but also allow for early initiation of targeted therapy—particularly crucial in managing inducible macrolide resistance linked to erm rrl M. abscessus 7 As such, integrating advanced molecular diagnostics into clinical workflows holds strong potential to improve treatment outcomes and reduce diagnostic delays. 10 Disease management 10.1 Infection control and preventive approaches Diagnostic delays and the complexity of identifying the causative species add another layer of difficulty, as accurate subspecies differentiation is critical for tailoring effective regimens. Moreover, erroneous diagnoses may result in therapeutic interventions that are ineffective for NTM infections. 88 30 99 lpqY, sugA, subB, sugC Rv2946c Rv2582 Rv3417c Rv0982 100 10.2 Management of antimicrobial-resistant NTM NTM, particularly RGM such as the M. abscessus erm bla Mab 101 , 102 103 erm rrl rrs 84 M. abscessus 104 The 2020 ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA guideline emphasizes that early initiation of combination therapy with at least three antibiotics, such as amikacin, cefoxitin, or tigecycline, and avoidance of monotherapy, particularly with macrolides, is critical to reducing the risk of inducible resistance. 84 M. abscessus 105 106 Table 5 84 , 101 , 107 Table 5 Resistance management and treatment regimens for RGM. Table 5 Strategy/Drug Class Regimens & Rationale Macrolide-Based Therapy Azithromycin or clarithromycin + IV amikacin + imipenem/cefoxitin + oral agents (clofazimine, linezolid, tigecycline).

Imipenem/Cefoxitin Core part of empiric therapy for M. abscessus/bolletii Tigecycline/Eravacycline/Omadacycline IV tigecycline used despite gastrointestinal side effects; novel tetracyclines show promising in vitro Oxazolidinones Linezolid added in refractory cases; some resistance (∼15 %–39 %) reported. Resistance mechanisms erm bla Mab Genotypic testing–guided therapy Testing for erm rrl rrs High levels of antimicrobial resistance in NTM limit treatment options and complicate infection management. The complex structure of cell walls and characteristics such as biofilm formation are responsible for the intrinsic resistance in NTM. Generally, mycobacteria employ several mechanisms to achieve antimicrobial resistance, including: (1) Barrier Mechanisms: Limiting drug uptake through reduced cell wall permeability or reverse drug transport via the expression of efflux transporters. (2) Degradation or inactivation of enzymes: Utilization of enzymes that degrade or inactivate drugs. (3) Modification of pathways involved in drug activation or metabolism: Alterations in pathways responsible for drug activation or metabolism. (4) Drug target modification or amplification: Changes in the drug target or an increase in the number of drug targets. 108 , 109 Table 6 110 , 111 Table 6 Drug resistance in NTM.

Abbreviations M. avium 11 Treatment Authoritative guidelines, including the ATS/IDSA statement (2007) ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA clinical practice guideline (2020) British Thoracic Society guideline (2017) M. abscessus 38 , 84 , 112 Treatment of NTM infections is challenging due to the diversity of NTM species, their antibiotic susceptibilities, and the complexity of clinical manifestations. 67 113 114 , 115 38 84 , 112 Healthcare providers should be aware of the prevalence of NTM species in their areas to guide diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. It is essential to differentiate between actual infection and cases of laboratory contamination or colonization. The choice to begin treatment should be personalized, taking into account factors like symptom intensity, imaging results, and microbiological findings. The 2020 ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA guideline advises starting treatment promptly, rather than just monitoring, for patients with NTM infections confirmed by positive sputum tests for AFB or those with cavitary lung disease. 84 Treatment plans usually consist of a combination of three to four antibiotics, given either daily or thrice weekly, based on disease severity and patient tolerance. For MAC pulmonary disease, a typical regimen includes rifampicin (or rifabutin for HIV-positive patients to prevent drug interactions), ethambutol, and a macrolide such as azithromycin or clarithromycin. Treatment generally continues for at least 12 months after sputum culture conversion. Due to the complexity and potential adverse effects of long-term antibiotic therapy, ensuring patient adherence can be challenging. Therefore, treatment strategies should be customized to individual patient requirements, and healthcare providers are advised to consult with specialists experienced in managing complex NTM infections. 2 , 84 Table 7 Table 7 Comparison of 2007 vs. 2020 guidelines for NTM-PD management. 38 , 84 Table 7 Aspect 2007 ATS/IDSA Guideline 2020 ATS/ERS/ESCMID/IDSA Guideline Geographical Scope US-based, single-society guideline.

Abbreviations 11.1 Treatment of NTM pulmonary disease The treatment of diseases caused by NTM is challenging due to their slow growth, intrinsic antibiotic resistance, and species diversity. Treatment strategies rely heavily on observational studies, clinical experience, and guideline recommendations. 38 , 116 111 11.1.1 M. avium complex treatment Standard therapy includes a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin), rifampin, and ethambutol, particularly effective in nodular‑bronchiectatic disease caused by macrolide‑susceptible strains, achieving culture conversion rates up to 82 %, though relapse occurs in approximately 48 %.

Tedizolid (a newer oxazolidinone) exhibits enhanced in vitro potency compared to linezolid and has been reported to have a more favorable tolerability profile. Nevertheless, clinical experience with tedizolid remains extremely limited, with only a single published case documenting successful therapeutic use to date. 73 , 127 M. abscessus 120 M. abscessus 128 , 129 130 11.1.4 Immunotherapy and adjunctive treatments (1) Administration of IFN‑γ, particularly in immunocompromised hosts, has shown mixed results across trials.(2) GM‑CSF therapy has benefited CF patients with M. abscessus 73 , 131 , 132 11.2 Treatment of extrapulmonary NTM diseases The treatment of extrapulmonary NTM diseases, such as skin, lymph node, bone, joint, or disseminated infections, varies based on the mycobacterial species, infection site, and patient condition, often differing from pulmonary disease management. For skin and soft tissue infections caused by RGM (e.g., M. chelonae, M. fortuitum 133 M. marinum, M. kansasii + 3 M. kansasii M. scrofulaceum 38 , 133 12 Conclusion NTM are widely distributed in the environment, surrounding humans, and avoiding contact with them is practically impossible. NTM are emerging pathogens that can affect both immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals. Diseases caused by NTM, particularly pulmonary infections, are increasing worldwide. The most common causative agents of pulmonary infections include: M. avium M. kansasii M. abscessus 16S rRNA, hsp65, rpoB CRediT authorship contribution statement Mehdi Roshdi Maleki: Seyyed Reza Moaddab: Informed consent Not applicable.
