Introduction As of 2022 according to the Global Cancer Observatory, prostate cancer has more than 1.4 million cases and almost 400,000 deaths worldwide, being the cancer with the fourth highest incidence and eighth highest mortality rate [ 1 2 3 4 Bladder cancer, as of 2022 and according to GLOBOCAN, has the 9th highest worldwide cancer incidence, with over 600,000 new cases, and is particularly incident in men, where it occupies the 6th place [ 5 6 One method from which new cancer therapies could be derived is drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning or drug reprofiling, an emerging strategy focused on finding new therapeutic applications for existing drugs rather than starting from scratch. This approach offers several advantages, including cost-effectiveness and faster clinical translation, as repurposed drugs have already undergone safety assessments in humans [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Efavirenz, originally developed by DuPont Pharmaceuticals, is a first-generation benzoxazinone non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) that is used to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection or stop HIV from spreading ( Figure 1 ® ® 14 15 16 17 18 19 Etravirine (ETV), marketed as Intelence ® Figure 2 20 21 22 This study aimed to evaluate the potential repurposing of the antiretroviral drugs EFV and ETV as anti-cancer agents against two different cancer types: prostate cancer (PC-3 cell line) and bladder cancer (UM-UC-5 cell line). Among NNRTIs, EFV and ETV were selected for this study based on their superior anti-cancer profiles compared to other drugs in the class. Comparative in vitro studies have demonstrated that EFV exhibits a markedly higher cytotoxic effect against cancer cells than other NNRTIs, with the 50% effective cytotoxic concentration (EC50) of EFV being approximately eight times lower than that of other NNRTIs, like NVP, in pancreatic cancer cell lines (EFV: 31.5 μmol/L vs. NVP: 239 μmol/L) [ 23 24 50 22 The primary objective was to assess the cytotoxic effects of EFV and ETV, individually and in combination, on cancer cell viability across a range of concentrations and exposure times. To further characterize the anti-cancer potential of these compounds, we examined their impact on cell migration using wound healing assays and on long-term proliferative capacity using clonogenic assays. Finally, to evaluate their biosafety, the effects of EFV, ETV, and their combination were tested in non-cancerous MRC-5 human fibroblasts to assess selective cytotoxicity. 2. Results 2.1. Viability—PC-3 EFV and ETV were tested in PC-3 metastatic prostate cancer cells at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 µM for three time periods (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h). Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 4 2.2. Viability—UM-UC-5 EFV and ETV were tested in UM-UC-5 bladder cancer cells at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 µM for three time periods (24 h, 48 h, and 72 h), and the results can be seen in Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 6 In controls and at lower drug concentrations (0.01–1 µM), cells maintained their typical epithelial morphology, forming dense monolayers with cell–cell junctions throughout the 72 h period. At higher EFV concentrations (10–100 µM), morphological alterations became evident. By 24 h, cells treated with 50 and 100 µM showed signs of cytotoxic stress, including cell rounding, loss of adherence, and reduced monolayer integrity. These effects intensified at 48 h and 72 h, with widespread detachment and cellular debris indicating extensive cell death. At intermediate concentrations (10–25 µM), moderate changes such as partial monolayer disruption and reduced cell density were apparent by 72 h ( Figure 7 Figure 8 The calculated IC 50 Table 1 50 50 In UM-UC-5 cells, EFV also demonstrated a time-dependent reduction in IC 50 2.3. Combination Studies Combination studies of EFV and ETV, at the same concentrations, were performed in both cell lines for all three time points, and the results of cell viability and morphology can be seen in Figure 9 Figure 10 Figure 11 In PC-3 cells, at 48 h, the combination of EFV and ETV at 50 µM showed significant improvements compared to both single agents, as indicated by the presence of asterisks for both EFV and ETV at that dose. In contrast, at 25 µM, although the combination was significantly better than EFV alone, it was not significantly better than ETV, indicating that the observed decrease might primarily reflect the effect of ETV rather than a true synergistic interaction. Similar patterns were observed at other time points, with clearer combination effects emerging at later stages (48 h and 72 h) ( Figure 9 Figure 10 In UM-UC-5 cells, only at 48 h did combinations show synergy in comparison with single treatments, for both 10 and 25 µM, while at higher concentrations, the effect was almost all due to EFV ( Figure 9 Figure 11 Overall, these results suggest that while both cell lines benefit from combination treatment, UM-UC-5 cells exhibit greater sensitivity and more consistent enhancement of cytotoxicity with EFV and ETV combined, particularly at later time points. This highlights a potential therapeutic advantage of combination therapy in bladder cancer cells. 2.4. Wound Healing Assays The effect of EFV and ETV, alone or in combination, on cell motility was assessed using a wound healing assay, for concentrations of 10 and 25 µM for 24, 48, and 72 h. These concentrations were chosen since these were the concentrations at which, generally, a cytotoxic impact started in both cell lines and around some of the IC 50 Figure 12 Figure 13 Figure 14 In PC-3 cells ( Figure 12 Figure 13 Figure 12 Figure 13 In UM-UC-5 cells ( Figure 12 Figure 12 Figure 14 These results suggest that ETV has, generally, a stronger effect on cancer cell motility than EFV. There was also a synergistic anti-migratory effect of EFV and ETV, especially in UM-UC-5 cell lines, particularly evident at higher concentrations, although at 10 µM of each drug, this effect is already quite evident. The combination therapy markedly impairs cell migration more effectively than either drug alone, supporting its potential utility in anti-metastatic strategies for prostate and bladder cancer. 2.5. Clonogenic Assays To evaluate the capacity of EFV and ETV, alone and in combination, to interfere with the proliferation of PC-3 and UM-UC-5 cells, a clonogenic assay was performed. Cells were exposed to both drugs at 10 and 25 µM, identical concentrations to the migration assays, for 48 h. As shown in Figure 15 In UM-UC-5 cells, the overall inhibitory trend was similar, though less pronounced. While neither concentration of EFV significantly reduced colony numbers, only ETV at 25 µM led to a marked and statistically significant decrease in clonogenicity. The combination showed similar results to ETV alone, indicating that only ETV is exerting anti-proliferative effects in these cells. However, variability in response at lower doses and the relatively modest reduction in colony formation at 10 µM suggest a more selective or concentration-dependent sensitivity in this bladder cancer cell line. These findings indicate that both EFV and ETV can impair the long-term proliferative potential of cancer cells, with ETV displaying greater potency, particularly in PC-3 cells. In these cells, the combination therapy exerts even stronger effects, resulting in the complete disappearance of colonies at 25 µM combination. The strong effect at higher concentrations highlights its therapeutic potential, although further work at lower doses may help define a safer and more selective dosing range. 2.6. Safety Assays—MRC-5 Cells To evaluate the biosafety of these drugs, we conducted an MTT cell viability assay using human fetal lung fibroblast cells (MRC-5), for our longest time point (72 h) and various concentrations (10, 25, and 50 µM). MRC-5 cells are a widely used, well-characterized human lung fibroblast line that retains a normal diploid karyotype and shares several critical properties with primary human mesenchymal cells. They are frequently used in toxicity and biocompatibility studies to represent non-cancerous, healthy human cells, providing a robust and reproducible model for assessing off-target cytotoxicity [ 25 26 Figure 16 Figure 17 EFV is well tolerated, with no significant reduction in cell viability observed at any of the tested concentrations. In fact, slight increases in viability were observed, suggesting a minimal effect on non-cancerous fibroblasts. ETV treatment resulted in a modest, concentration-dependent reduction in MRC-5 cell viability, with statistical significance achieved at all concentrations tested. However, it is important to note that these effects were observed following prolonged exposure (72 h), a duration that exceeds clinical plasma half-lives of both of these drugs, which are 35–50 h for EFV [ 27 28 50 The combination of EFV and ETV also led to a moderate reduction in viability under the same long exposure conditions, with viability levels comparable to those seen with ETV alone. These results indicate a likely contribution from ETV as the primary driver of cytotoxicity in the combination, while EFV appears to have a minimal impact on fibroblast survival. The morphological images from Figure 17 Taken together, these data suggest that EFV is well tolerated by normal human fibroblasts even at high concentrations, while ETV may induce mild to moderate cytotoxicity at elevated doses over prolonged exposure. They also indicate that for dosage, we could focus on decreasing ETV concentrations while increasing EFV’s, which could lead to a similar effect but with less pronounced cytotoxicity for healthy cells. 3. Discussion Prostate and bladder cancer are both urinary tract cancers and can be related due to their proximity. Notably, bladder cancer frequently emerges as a secondary cancer after radiation therapy for prostate cancer [ 29 30 Additionally, studies have indicated a reciprocal relationship between these two cancers, with higher incidences of prostate cancer observed in patients with bladder cancer and vice versa [ 31 32 This study demonstrates that both EFV and ETV exert significant cytotoxic effects on PC-3 and UM-UC-5 cancer cells, with varying degrees of potency, time dependence, and selectivity. ETV consistently outperformed EFV in reducing cell viability in PC-3 prostate cancer cells, showing a lower IC 50 EFV has been of great interest in drug repurposing for cancer, having shown effects in several cancers, such as triple-negative breast cancer and pancreatic cancer [ 23 24 33 50 One target that is associated with EFV and can be found both in prostate and bladder cancer is the human long-interspersed nuclear elements-1 (LINE-1) [ 24 34 35 36 37 38 39 The ETV results in UM-UC-5 bladder cancer had previously been reported, and a discussion of the possible pathways can be found in that article from our research group [ 22 40 41 42 43 44 43 50 For ETV, the standard therapeutic dose is 200 mg twice daily. At this dosing regimen, the mean reported steady-state C max 45 50 max 46 50 50 Generally, while standard dosing of ETV and EFV may not achieve the levels reported in this study systemically, the findings open promising avenues for optimizing ETV and EFV use as repurposed therapeutics in oncology. Combination treatment showed enhanced cytotoxicity in both cell lines, though the nature of the interaction differed. In PC-3 cells, synergy was more evident at higher concentrations and longer exposure times. In UM-UC-5 cells, however, lower concentrations of the combination already resulted in significant viability loss, implying greater sensitivity and potential for more effective combination regimens in bladder cancer. This effective combination could be because of similar effects in the cell cycle inhibition of these two drugs [ 38 43 Cell migration is essential for metastasis, where cancer cells detach from the primary tumor, invade nearby tissues, and enter the bloodstream. Because of this, it is important to study whether, beyond their cytotoxic effect, our repurposed drugs have the capability of inhibiting the motility of our cancer cell lines [ 47 Clonogenic assays are pivotal in cancer therapy development as they measure a cell’s ability to survive and proliferate long-term after treatment, providing critical insights into therapeutic efficacy and resistance mechanisms [ 48 The ability of ETV to significantly impair migration and clonogenicity in bladder cancer cells, particularly UM UC 5, might suggest interference with mechanisms central to the metastatic phenotype, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Recent studies have identified prohibitin (PHB) as a key regulator of EMT and metastasis in bladder cancer through stabilization of β-catenin, thereby enhancing Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This promotes increased migration, invasion, and metastatic potential in vivo and in vitro [ 49 50 The strengths of these two drugs appear to differ in UM-UC-5 cells, where EFV has a stronger immediate cytotoxic effect, while ETV ends up causing a more durable effect on proliferation and migration. These different phenotypes might be explained by variations in the drugs’ mechanisms of action. As previously mentioned, EFV has been shown to act through rapid induction of DNA damage, nuclear lamina fragmentation, and activation of p53 (via phosphorylation), which leads to relatively quick apoptotic responses in cancer cells [ 33 38 39 24 22 40 41 43 44 Safety profiling in normal MRC-5 fibroblast cells showed that EFV is well tolerated at cytotoxic doses used in cancer cells. ETV, while somewhat more toxic, still maintained acceptable viability (>60%) even at 50 µM, suggesting a reasonable therapeutic index. The combination mirrored ETV’s safety profile, indicating its effect largely drives any observed toxicity. This suggests that for a treatment method, the dosages of ETV would need to be carefully examined. Perhaps compensating for lower concentrations of ETV with higher concentrations of EFV, which has been shown to be non-toxic, could be a potential approach. Taken together, these findings provide several important directions for future research. First, mechanistic studies are needed to dissect how EFV and ETV exert their cytotoxic and anti-migratory effects, particularly regarding their influence on pathways such as p53, LINE-1, AGR2, and EMT regulators. In vivo validation of EFV and ETV efficacy using tumor models will be critical to confirm therapeutic potential and evaluate safety profiles. Additionally, optimizing drug delivery, such as through tumor-targeted formulations or by developing combination strategies, may enhance efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Finally, expanding the evaluation of EFV and ETV across diverse bladder and prostate cancer models could identify subtype-specific responses and potential biomarkers predictive of treatment sensitivity. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture EFV and ETV toxicity were assessed using the human metastatic prostate cancer cell line PC-3, the human bladder cancer cell line UM-UC-5, and the human fetal lung fibroblast cell line MRC-5. These cell lines were donated by the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), and the drugs were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). All materials were acquired from Millipore Sigma (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), and the cells were kept in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 4.2. Drug Treatment EFV and ETV cytotoxicity, alone or in combination, in cancer lines was assessed using concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μM following 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation. These concentrations span a broad range of concentrations and enable us to acquire IC 50 4.3. Morphological Analysis During the drug incubation period, cell morphology was observed using a Leica DMI 6000B microscope fitted with a Leica DFC350 FX camera (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Image analysis was subsequently performed with Leica LAS X software (v3.7.4; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). 4.4. MTT Assay Drug toxicity was assessed using the MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide) colorimetric assay. At the end of the treatment period, 100 μL of MTT solution (0.5 mg/mL in PBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was added to each well. Following a two-hour incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 4.5. Wound Healing Assay A wound-healing assay was conducted to assess cell motility. Silicone ibidi inserts were placed in a 12-well plate to create a defined gap between cell layers. PC-3 (3 × 10 5 5 2 4.6. Clonogenic Assay PC-3 and UM-UC-5 cells were seeded at a density of 100 cells per well in standard 6-well plates, with three technical replicates per condition. Once cells reached approximately 80% confluence, they were incubated overnight and subsequently treated with or without EFV and ETV (10 and 25 µM, alone and in combination) for 48 h. Following drug exposure, the medium was replaced with fresh, drug-free complete medium, and cultures were maintained for an additional 12 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 v v 4.7. Statistical Analysis All data are presented as mean ± SEM, and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical analysis between experimental drug groups and the negative control was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. For comparison of combination treatments with individual drug effects at corresponding concentrations, a two-way ANOVA was applied. A significance threshold of p 50 5. Conclusions This study highlights the potential of the antiretroviral drugs efavirenz (EFV) and etravirine (ETV) as repurposed anti-cancer agents against prostate and bladder cancer cell lines. Both compounds demonstrated notable cytotoxicity in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, with ETV showing greater potency in PC-3 cells and EFV exhibiting more consistent effects in UM-UC-5 cells. Combination treatments revealed additive or synergistic effects, particularly in bladder cancer cells, enhancing cytotoxicity and impairing cell migration more effectively than either agent alone. Importantly, EFV showed a favorable biosafety profile in non-cancerous MRC-5 fibroblasts, while ETV induced only moderate cytotoxicity at higher concentrations and longer exposures. These results suggest that EFV and ETV hold promise as selective therapeutic options for urinary tract cancers, warranting further investigation in in vivo models and mechanistic studies to validate their clinical relevance and optimize dosing strategies.
