To assess whether there is consistency between the intrinsic dependencies observed in vitro and in vivo, we performed a comparative analysis between the NSG mouse model (in vivo) and the in vitro samples. This approach allowed us to identify genes critical for the growth of the MOC1-esc1 cell line either in vitro, In vivo, or in both conditions. While some genes required for in vitro growth were also important In vivo, we observed differences, indicating that certain genes play a more prominent role in the In vivo context (Supplementary Fig. 1G 2 H2-T23 Ptpn2 Adar 1C–E 2A 16 18 Asf1a 1F 19 Uchl5 Nfrkb, Tfpt Taf4 Taf6 Taf8 Sap18 Arid4a Suds3 Ep300 Ing5 Crebbp Bap1 Jade2 Cul5, Rnf2 1F To further validate candidates from the In vivo CRISPR screen, top targets from these complexes were used to construct a validation pool library (Supplementary Data 3 1G Ptpn2 Jmjd1c 1H 2B Nfrkb Bap1, Uchl5 1H 2B NFRKB mediates recruitment of UCHL5 to the INO80 complex, a nucleosome remodeling complex, and inhibits UCHL5 by blocking the ubiquitin-binding site and by disrupting the enzyme active site.

Immunodeficient NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice were bred on-site at the Broad Institute. All mice were housed in the Broad Institute’s animal facility, adhering to the institute’s animal care and use guidelines. Tumor challenges were carried out in age-matched mice under protocol number 0110-08-16-1, approved by the Broad Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Experiments were terminated when tumors reached a maximum allowable size of 2 cm in the largest dimension, showed ulceration, or if mice exhibited signs of distress as defined by the institutional animal care guidelines. Animal studies using the 4MOSC1 tumor model were conducted at Moores Cancer Center, San Diego, under protocol ASP # S15195 Mice were monitored at least once daily for general health, tumor growth, and behavior throughout the study. Tumor dimensions (length and width) were measured with digital calipers, and volumes were calculated using the formula: volume = (length × width²) / 2. Disease progression was primarily assessed by tumor size, rate of growth, and the presence of ulceration. Humane endpoint criteria included ≥15% body weight loss, persistent hunched posture, ruffled fur, reduced mobility or activity, labored breathing, or failure to access food/water. Mice meeting any humane endpoint criteria were euthanized immediately via CO₂ inhalation followed by cervical dislocation, in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Broad Institute and the Moores Cancer Center. Murine cell lines Mouse oral squamous cell carcinoma models, including MOC1-esc1 and MOC2, were maintained in IMDM/Hams-F12 (2:1) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin, 5 ng/mL EGF (Millipore), 40 ng/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma Aldrich), and 5 mg/mL insulin (Sigma Aldrich). 4MOSC1 cells were cultured in Defined Ketatinocyte-SFM medium supplemented with EGF Recombinant Mouse Protein (5 ng/ml), Cholera Toxin (50 pM) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. All Cell lines were routinely tested for Mycoplasma and underwent short tandem repeat cell line authentication within 6 months of use. Murine oral squamous cell carcinoma lines (MOC1-esc1 and MOC2) were propagated in a 2:1 mixture of IMDM and Ham’s F-12 containing 5% heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin–streptomycin (100 U/mL), EGF (5 ng/mL; Millipore), hydrocortisone (40 ng/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), and insulin (5 μg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich). The 4MOSC1 line was maintained in Defined Keratinocyte-SFM supplemented with recombinant mouse EGF (5 ng/mL), cholera toxin (50 pM), and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Mycoplasma testing was performed on a routine schedule, and STR profiling confirmed cell identity within six months prior to use. In vivo chromatin regulator CRISPR screen in the MOC1-esc1 model A lentiviral CRISPR library containing 7806 sgRNAs targeting 936 genes (6 sgRNAs per gene) plus non-targeting controls 9 For in vivo screening, 4 × 10⁶ MOC1-esc1 cells per tumor were prepared in a 1:1 mixture of growth factor–reduced Matrigel (Corning) and Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) and implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of 40 NSG and 80 WT mice, providing ~250× coverage per sgRNA. Of the WT group, 40 mice were treated intraperitoneally with 100 µg anti–PD-1 and 100 µg anti–CTLA-4 antibodies on days 9, 12, and 15 after tumor inoculation. Parallel in vitro cultures were maintained with >1000× sgRNA coverage for the duration of the screen. 18 days after implantation, tumors and in vitro pools were collected. Tumors were finely minced, pooled by equal tissue mass (five tumors per pool), and digested with proteinase K. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAGEN Blood Maxi Kit. The sgRNA cassettes were PCR-amplified and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform. Guide count data were normalized by z-score prior to comparison between groups. sgRNA enrichment or depletion was assessed, and statistically significant hits were identified using the STARS algorithm 104 Generation and validation of gene deficient cell lines MOC1-esc1, MOC2, and 4MOSC1 CRISPR knockout cell lines were generated by sequential lentiviral transductions. First, cells were infected with a Cas9-expressing vector (pSCAR_Cas9-hygromycin_GFP, Addgene 162075) and selected with hygromycin for 1–2 weeks. Cas9-expressing populations were then transduced with pSCAR_sgRNA_1 (pXPR_060, Addgene 162076) carrying a single guide RNA, followed by puromycin selection for 1–2 weeks. To remove immunogenic sequences present in the Cas9 and sgRNA constructs, the resulting lines were transduced with IDLV-Cre lentivirus 15 CRISPR sgRNA sequences Gene name and sequence are as follows: Control sgRNA 1 GCGAGGTATTCGGCTCCGCG; control sgRNA 2 GCTTTCACGGAGGTTCGACG; control sgRNA 3 ATGTTGCAGTTCGGCTCGAT; control sgRNA 4 ACGTGTAAGGCGAACGCCTT; control sgRNA 5 ATTGTTCGACCGTCTACGGG; Cd47 Uchl5 Uchl5 Bap1 Nfrkb Col17a1 Col17a1 In vivo tumor challenge and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatments In the mouse MOC model tumor challenge experiments, either 2 × 10 6 5 6 + In vivo tumor growth competition assays For in vivo competition assays, equal numbers of the indicated cell lines (1:1 ratio) were mixed and cultured for one passage before subcutaneous implantation of 2 × 10⁶ cells into NSG and WT mice. The same mixed cell populations were also maintained in parallel in vitro cultures for the duration of the assay. Immunotherapy treatments were administered to mice as described elsewhere in the text. Fifteen to eighteen days after implantation, tumors and corresponding in vitro samples were collected. Tumor tissues were finely minced and digested using Proteinase K with Buffer ATL (QIAGEN), and genomic DNA was purified using the QIAGEN Blood Maxi Kit. For each sample, 1–10 μg of genomic DNA was used as input for PCR amplification of the sgRNA cassettes, employing P5 and P7 primers according to protocols provided at https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gpp/public/resources/protocols Flow cytometry Adherent cell lines were detached using Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%, Gibco) and subsequently rinsed with MACS buffer (PBS  +  2% FBS +  5 mM EDTA). For cell surface staining, cells were exposed to fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for 15 to 30 minutes at 4 °C, followed by two washes with MACS buffer. Samples were then analyzed using a Beckman Coulter CytoFLEX flow cytometer and FlowJo software (FlowJo). Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes by flow cytometry For the MOC1-esc1 model, mice received subcutaneous injections of 2 × 10⁶ CRISPR–Cas9 engineered MOC1-esc1 cells. Tumors were excised on day 15, weighed, and cut into small fragments before enzymatic dissociation using the Miltenyi tumor dissociation kit and the gentleMACS Dissociator (program m-TDK-1). Cell suspensions were filtered through 70-μm strainers, blocked with anti-mouse CD16/32 (BioLegend), and incubated on ice for 15–30 minutes with the specified surface antibodies. To exclude dead cells, LIVE/DEAD™ Fixable Near-IR dye (1:5000; Invitrogen) was included during surface staining. After washing, cells were fixed using the Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (eBiosciences), blocked with mouse and rat serum, and subsequently stained with intracellular antibodies. For quantification, Spherotech AccuCount Rainbow particles were added to samples before flow cytometric acquisition. Data were collected on an LSR Fortessa using single-color compensation and fluorescence-minus-one controls to define gates, and analyzed in FlowJo. Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using Student’s t-tests. Antibodies used at 1:100 dilution for flow cytometry: CD45 (Biolegend, 30-F11), TCRβ (Biolegend, H57-597), CD8α (Biolegend, QA17A07), CD4(Biolegend, GK1.5), NK1.1 (Biolegend, S17016D), CD19 (Biolegend, 1D3/CD19), Perforin (Biolegend, S16009A), Foxp3 (Biolegend, FJK-16s), CD11b (Biolegend, M1/70), MHCII (Biolegend, AF6-120.1), F4_80 (Biolegend, BM8), Gr.1 (Biolegend, RB6-8C5), CD163 (Biolegend, S15049I), CD64 (Biolegend, X54-5/7.1), Ter119 (Biolegend, TER-119), CD90.2 (Biolegend, 53-2.1) In the 4MOSC1 tumor experiments, either control or Uchl5 Primary CD8 + Primary murine CD8⁺ T cells were obtained from spleens of C57BL/6 mice. Spleens were mechanically dissociated, passed through a cell strainer, and treated with ACK lysing buffer to remove red blood cells. After washing with MACS buffer, CD8⁺ T cells were purified using the mouse CD8⁺ T Cell Isolation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified cells were seeded onto plates coated with purified NA/LE hamster anti-mouse CD3ε (1 µg/mL; BD Pharmingen, clone 145-2C11) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (GlutaMAX supplemented) containing 10% FBS, antibiotics (50 U/mL penicillin and 50 µg/mL streptomycin), 1× MEM non-essential amino acids, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol. The medium was supplemented with recombinant human IL-2 (PeproTech) and purified NA/LE hamster anti-mouse CD28 (2 µg/mL; BD Pharmingen). After 24 h of activation, cells were maintained in recombinant human IL-2 (100 U/mL) and expanded in plates or flasks, with medium refreshed every 24–48 h for 5–7 days before downstream assays. Lymphocyte depletion To investigate the involvement of specific subsets of immune effector cells in mice, we utilized depletion methods targeting CD8 + OT-1 T cell culture and in vivo CD8 + OT-1 CD8 + + Uchl5 + + RNA sequencing The control and Uchl5-deficient MOC1-esc1 cell line was treated with either DMSO or 10 ng/ml IFNγ for 24 h. Single-cell suspensions from cells cultured in a monolayer were homogenized in the RNA lysis buffer. RNA was extracted from homogenized samples using the RNA Miniprep Plus Kit in accordance with the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. For collected MOC1-esc1 tumors grown in vivo, tumors were collected on day 15, weighed, mechanically diced, digested with a tumor dissociation kit (Miltenyi) and a gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi) using the m-TDK-1 program. After filtering through a 70-μm strainer, tumor cells were isolated using the mouse tumor cell isolation kit from Miltenyi Biotec according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was extracted from cell pellets using the Qiagen RNA Miniprep Plus Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina-barcoded libraries for RNA sequencing were generated utilizing the Takara SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 following the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequent sequencing was executed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. Data underwent quality trimming using the Trimmomatic pipeline, with specified parameters: LEADING:15, TRAILING:15, SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15, MINLEN:16. Pre-and post-trimming quality control was done using FastQC (v0.11.7). Subsequently, data were aligned to the mouse reference genome mm10 using Kallisto (v0.46.0). HTSeq was utilized for mapping aligned reads to genes and generating a gene count matrix. PCA was used to assess sample quality and replicate concordance.

Cells were grouped into UCHL5 high (score > 0) and low (score ≤ 0) expression categories. The log fold change (LFC) in mean expression was calculated between the groups for each gene. P-values were determined using Welch’s t-test and adjusted for multiple hypothesis testing with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. -log10(adjusted p-value) values were calculated, with infinite values replaced by the maximum finite value plus one. Genes were sorted by -log10(adjusted p-value), directionalized by the sign of the LFC, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 106 43 Clinical sample collection and pathologic assessment of stromal desmoplasia Tumor samples used for stromal desmoplasia analysis were obtained from a previously published clinical study of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy in HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients ( NCT02296684 Western blot and antibodies After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were detached from the culture plate utilizing Cell lifter (VWR International LLC) in ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were then acquired through centrifugation at 300 x g at 4 °C for 5 minutes, followed by lysis in the RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) on ice for 20-30 min. Post-lysis, the cell lysates underwent centrifugation at > 13,000 x g Immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence MOC1-esc1 tumors were fully fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for a duration of 24 h, followed by an overnight permeabilization step in 70% ethanol. After fixation, the tissues were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and affixed onto slides for subsequent staining using mouse COL17A1 antibody (Abcam, Ab186415 Ectopic gene expression Full-length mouse UCHL5 construct was generated via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using plasmids pcDNA3.1-mUchl5 obtained from Genscript as templates. These fragments were subsequently cloned into the pDONR211 vector (Thermo-Fisher) using BP Clonase II, and then transferred to the pLX-311 expression vector (Thermo-Fisher) utilizing LR Clonase II gateway technology for gene expression. A flag tag was appended to the 3′-end of UCHL5. The same procedure was applied to mouse Col17a1. Lentiviral infection was employed to deliver the expression vectors to MOC1-esc1 cells, which were subsequently harvested for western analyses.
