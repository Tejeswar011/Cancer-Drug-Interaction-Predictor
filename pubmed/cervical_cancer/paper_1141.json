This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/345980-a-case-of-warthin-like-variant-of-papillary-thyroid-cancer Warthin-like variant of papillary thyroid cancer (WLPTC) is a rare subtype of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Its symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis are comparable to those of the classic type of PTC. However, certain aggressive PTC variants may mimic WLPTC, making accurate diagnosis essential since management and follow-up can differ. Here, we report a case of a 64-year-old man who was diagnosed with WLPTC. He initially presented to the hospital with worsening blurry vision of the right eye over a few days. During evaluation, an incidental right neck mass was detected, and fine-needle aspiration was performed. The pathology revealed thyroid carcinoma. The patient subsequently underwent total thyroidectomy with modified neck dissection, and histological analysis identified WLPTC. Postoperatively, he received radioactive iodine therapy and thyroid hormone therapy. His follow-up visits showed a favorable outcome two years later. This case highlights the importance of identifying WLPTC, as accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring appropriate clinical management and follow-up for patients. benign and malignant thyroid nodule braf v600e mutations head and neck mass papillary carcinoma of thyroid thyroid carcinoma warthin-like variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most prevalent type of thyroid carcinoma, and it has several different variants [ 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 WLPTC primarily affects women and is most often diagnosed in younger individuals, typically between 30 and 50 years of age [ 3 3 7 7 Case presentation A 64-year-old man without prior history of thyroid disease presented to the emergency room with worsening blurry vision in his right eye over several days. He underwent extensive evaluations during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture results were negative for infectious, neoplastic, or autoimmune causes. MRI of the orbits showed atypical optic neuritis, which resolved after five days of intravenous steroid therapy. MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine was also performed. His cervical MRI with and without contrast showed an incidental 2.5 cm right neck mass, likely an enlarged level II/III lymph node compressing the right internal jugular vein. Thyroid ultrasound showed the right lobe measured 4.49 cm × 1.4 cm × 1.76 cm. A right superior hypoechoic solid nodule measuring 1.11 cm × 0.61 cm × 0.85 cm was identified, causing anterior bulging of the capsule and demonstrating internal punctate microcalcifications. This nodule had a smooth margin and was classified as TI-RADS level 5 (TR5) [ 8 The right thyroid nodule was not biopsied; therefore, no mutation study was performed. However, he underwent fine-needle aspiration of the right level III lymph node, and the pathology showed metastatic carcinoma consistent with thyroid origin. The patient subsequently underwent total thyroidectomy with modified radical neck dissection. Surgical pathology confirmed a 0.8 cm Warthin-like subtype papillary thyroid carcinoma in the right thyroid lobe (Figures 1 2 Figure 1 H&E stain, 200X. Warthin-like papillary thyroid carcinoma (WLPTC) showing papillary lining of neoplastic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm (black arrows) and abundant lymphoid stroma (red arrows), resembling Warthin tumors of the salivary gland. Figure 2 H&E stain, 400X. High-power view showing neoplastic oncocytic cells with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) nuclear features, including nuclear clearing, pseudoinclusions (red arrow), grooves, and nuclear overlap, within a lymphoplasmacytic-rich fibrovascular stroma (black arrow). There was evidence of lymphatic invasion. No thyroid carcinoma was identified in the left lobe. Papillary thyroid carcinoma was present in one of eleven lymph nodes at levels III and IV of the right neck, with a tumor deposit measuring 2.8 cm in maximum dimension. Papillary thyroid carcinoma was also present in one of two lymph nodes at level II of the right neck, with a tumor deposit measuring 4 mm. No extranodal extension was identified in the metastatic lymph nodes. The patient was treated with iodine-131 ablation and suppressive thyroxine therapy. The two-year outcomes were favorable. Discussion WLPTC is a rare oncocytic variant of PTC, predominantly affecting women [ 3 3 9 10 There are no specific clinical or radiological findings for diagnosing WLPTC. Fine-needle aspiration is required if a painless neck mass is found on ultrasound [ 3 3 3 11 5 11 7 11 The differential diagnosis of WLPTC includes Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Hürthle cell neoplasm, classical subtype PTC arising in a thyroiditis background, tall cell subtype, and oncocytic subtype of PTC [ 3 7 7 7 Immunohistochemically, the BRAFV600E mutation is the most common mutation and may play a role in the pathogenesis of classic PTC [ 12 3 Treatment typically involves surgery (lobectomy or total thyroidectomy), with possible neck dissection depending on the tumor’s extent [ 13 13 14 Conclusions WLPTC is a rare and often indolent variant of PTC, requiring careful histopathological evaluation for accurate diagnosis. Its distinctive features, such as the dense lymphocytic infiltrate in papillary cores, help distinguish it from more aggressive PTC subtypes like the tall cell variant. Although treatment usually involves surgery and possible adjuvant therapies, WLPTC generally follows a favorable clinical course, emphasizing the importance of correct diagnosis for optimal management.
