Introduction In the modern age, cancer is still one of the most pressing issues in medicine, which means new and effective treatments must be developed. Despite major progress in the development of anticancer drugs over the past fifty years, cancer remains a major cause of death around the World [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 A significant number of bioactive compounds have purine as part of their chemical composition, making it the most widespread nitrogen-containing heterocyclic nucleus [ 13 14 Mycobacterium tuberculosis 15 i i 2 16 17 18 19 Figure 1 The trifluoromethyl (CF 3 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 3 3 3 Recently, the potential benefits of theophylline-type molecules on anticancer treatments took the attention of the researchers [ 29 30 31 32 Molecular docking method contributes to drug discovery research by identification and optimization of drug candidates and provides useful insight into the molecular interaction of certain biological processes [ 33 34 35 36 Staphylococcus aureus Enterococcus faecalis Candida albicans Pseudomonas aeruginosa Escherichia coli 37 38 39 Staphylococcus aureus 40 Based on the above, we considered it expedient to carry out the synthesis of N(7) substituted theophyllines containing trifluoromethyl and trifluoromethoxy benzyl groups. The structure of synthesized compounds was confirmed by various spectroscopic techniques such as 1 13 19 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.

Evaluation of Anticancer Activity and Selectivity Index The anticancer potential of substituted theophylline derivatives was investigated using human lung carcinoma (A549, CCL-185) and cervical cancer (HeLa, CCL-2) cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). To evaluate the selectivity of the tested compounds, cytotoxicity was also assessed in a healthy human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B, ATCC CRL-9609). Cells were maintained in DMEM (Euroclone S.p.A., Pero, Italy supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (1%, Capricorn Scientific GmbH, Ebsdorfergrund, Germany at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 1a 1e To evaluate cell viability, the MTT colorimetric assay was employed. Upon reaching logarithmic growth, A549, HeLa and BEAS-2B cells were seeded at a density of 7000 cells per well in 96-well microplates and allowed to attach for 24 h. Following this, cells were treated with different concentrations of the compounds and incubated for 48 h. After treatment, 100 µL of fresh medium and 20 µL of MTT reagent (5 mg/mL, Bio Basic Inc., Markham, ON, Canada) were added to each well, and cells were incubated for an additional 3 h. The resulting formazan crystals were solubilized with DMSO. Cell viability was calculated as the percentage of absorbance relative to untreated controls, and IC 50 The percentage of inhibition was calculated based on the reduction in metabolic activity of the cells following compound treatment, as assessed by the MTT assay. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader. The inhibition (%) was calculated using the following formula: Inhibition A sample A blank A sample A blank To assess the tumor selectivity of the tested theophylline derivatives, the selectivity index (SI) was calculated for each compound. SI is defined as the ratio of the IC 50 50 50 SI = [IC 50 50 SI value greater than 2 is generally considered indicative of preferential cytotoxicity toward cancer cells and is widely used as a benchmark for tumor selectivity in anticancer drug discovery. 2.4. Gene Expression Analysis by RT-qPCR To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of the most potent compound ( 1a 1a 50 RT-qPCR reactions (LightCycler® 480 Instrument II (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) were carried out using SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and gene-specific primers targeting pro-apoptotic genes (CASP3, CASP8, CASP9, BAX, BAK1, PUMA, NOXA, CYCS), anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2, BCL-XL, MCL1), cell cycle/stress-related genes (TP53, CDKN1A/p21, GADD45A, ATF4), and the reference gene GAPDH. The primer sequences used for each gene are presented in the Supplementary File (Figure S66) All reactions were conducted in triplicate, and negative controls (no-template controls, NTC) were included in each run. Relative gene expression levels were analyzed using the 2 −ΔΔCt 2.5. Quantification of Apoptosis-Related Proteins by ELISA To validate the gene expression changes observed in the RT-qPCR analysis at the protein level, ELISA assays were conducted to measure the protein levels in A549 and HeLa cells. Cells were treated with compound 1a at its IC 50 g Total protein concentration in the cell lysates was determined spectrophotometrically using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Protein concentrations were standardized to equal amounts across all samples prior to ELISA analysis. Commercially available Human ELISA Kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were used to quantify Caspase-3, BAX, BCL-2, and Cytochrome C levels, and all assays were performed according to the manufacturers’ protocols. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. All experiments were conducted in triplicate. The results were normalized to the control group (control = 1) and expressed as fold change relative to untreated controls. 2.6. Determination of Antimicrobial Activity The antibacterial activities of the compounds were determined using the broth microdilution method, as per the advice of international standards [ 53 54 1a 1e Staphylococcus aureus Enterococcus faecalis Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa Candida albicans Candida albicans 2.7.

Molecular Docking Molecular docking computationally predicts the orientations or binding modes of a molecule to a target macromolecule. This method contributes to drug discovery research by identification and optimization of drug candidates and can be used to predict the three-dimensional structure of protein–ligand complexes which experimentally are not available [ 55 56 Angiogenesis refers to the development and renewal of new vessels from pre-existing vessels. Physiological angiogenesis which has strongly occurred till adolescence, continues very slowly in adults during wound healing, menstrual cycles, and pregnancy. On the other hand, pathological angiogenesis can emerge in such inflammation, diabetic retinopathy, atherosclerosis, and tumor formation. One of the main regulators of angiogenesis is Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) [ 57 58 59 60 61 62 1a 1e Supplementary Materials File Figures S22, S23, S25, S27, and S29 Table 2 1b 3 1b 1e 1c 1d 1a Table 2 1b Figure 2 Supplementary Materials File Figures S21, S24, S26, and S28 Cytochrome 450 (CYPs) is an enzyme superfamily involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics such as drugs, industrial chemicals, pesticides. Many macromolecules such as steroids, prostaglandins, and fatty acids are physiological substrates of these Cytochrome 450-type enzymes [ 63 64 65 66 67 1a 1e Supplementary Materials File Figures S31, S33, S35, S37, and S39 Table 2 1e 1e 3 1e 1c 1b 1a 1d Table 2 1e Figure 3 Supplementary Materials File Figures S30, S32, S34, S36, and S38 Estrogen receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, are specialized cell surface proteins. Estrogen hormones bind to these receptors to exert their physiological effects. In this way, the differentiation and maintenance of nervous, skeletal, cardiovascular, and reproductive tissues are regulated. Since many breast cancer tumors have estrogen receptors, the growth of these tumors is supported by estrogen. Therefore, modulation of these receptors can be used as a treatment procedure in breast cancer cells. A similar treatment procedure is also used in the treatment of some osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases [ 68 69 70 71 1a 1e Supplementary Materials File Figures S40, S41, S43, S45, S46, and S47 Table 2 1b 1b 1a 1e 1d 1c Table 2 1b Figure 4 Supplementary Materials File Figures S39, S42, S44, and S46 DNA gyrase is a Type II topoisomerase and affects DNA replication and maintenance of bacteria. This enzyme both introduces negative supercoils into DNA and relieves positive supercoils from the replication fork. Since it is crucial for the survival of bacteria, some antibacterial agents such as fluoroquinolones and aminocoumarins try to breach the action mechanism of this enzyme [ 72 73 74 Mollugo oppositifolia 2 75 1a 1e Supplementary Materials File Figures S48, S50, S52, S54, and S56 Table 2 1a 1a 1a 1e 1b 1c 1d Table 2 1a Figure 5 Supplementary Materials File Figures S49, S51, S53, and S55 Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus 76 77 78 79 1a 1e Supplementary Materials File Figures S58, S59, S61, S63, and S65 1b 1b 3 1b 1c 1d 1a 1e Table 2 1b Figure 6 Supplementary Materials File Figures S57, S60, S62, and S64 3.3. Anticancer Activity and Selectivity of Substituted Theophylline Derivatives Theophylline derivatives have garnered attention in recent years due to their potential therapeutic efficacy against various cancer cell lines. This study investigates the anticancer properties and selectivity profiles of compounds 1a 1e To evaluate the cytotoxic potential of the compounds in a dose-dependent manner, MTT assays were performed following 48-h incubation periods at concentrations ranging from 3.125 μM to 100 μM. IC 50 Table 3 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 50 Figure 7 50 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 50 Figure 8 Selectivity index (SI) analyses were performed by comparing cytotoxic effects on non-tumorigenic BEAS-2B cells. All tested compounds demonstrated substantially lower cytotoxicity in BEAS-2B cells compared to A549 and HeLa cancer cells, reflected by high SI values (>4). Notably, compound 1a displayed the highest tumor selectivity, with SI values of 8.06 ± 0.03 and 9.26 ± 0.01 for A549 and HeLa cells, respectively ( Table 3 Figure 9 The presence of fluorine atoms or fluorine-containing groups within the molecular structures contributed to their biological activity due to advantages in size, electronegativity, and metabolic stability. Specifically, fluorine substitution modulates lipophilicity, enhancing cellular absorption and transportation. Compounds 1a 1b 1c 3 1d 3 3 1c 1e 80 1a 3.4.

Conclusions In conclusion, five novel theophylline derivatives bearing CF 3 3 1 13 19 Experimental validation via in vitro studies further substantiated the anticancer potential of these derivatives, with compounds 1a 1b 1c 50 1a 81 Detailed mechanistic studies employing RT-qPCR and ELISA provided compelling evidence that apoptosis induction is the fundamental mechanism underlying the anticancer activity observed with compound 1a 82 1a 83 Antimicrobial activity assessments indicated limited antibacterial efficacy, with MIC values generally exceeding 1000 µg/mL, suggesting that the primary biomedical relevance of these derivatives lies in their anticancer properties. However, modest antibiofilm activities observed warrant further optimization and exploration of structure–activity relationships to enhance efficacy. Molecular docking studies provided critical insights into their interaction potential with pivotal biological targets such as VEGFR-2, Cytochrome P450, estrogen receptor, DNA Gyrase, and SarA. Specifically, compound 1b 1e 1a In future research, exploring additional biological targets and diverse substituents on the theophylline framework could substantially enhance anticancer potency, selectivity, and overall therapeutic efficacy.
