Its function hinges on two phases: (1) the glymphatic influx phase, during which CSF moves from the subarachnoid space into the brain parenchyma via periarterial spaces penetrating the cortical surface, and (2) the glymphatic clearance phase, during which CSF-ISF mixtures carrying neurotoxic waste (e.g., β-amyloid, phosphorylated tau) exit via perivenous pathways 12 16 17 19 11 20 21 10 11 21 23 Given the pivotal role of the glymphatic system in TBI pathology, the exploration of potential therapeutic strategies is necessary. Emerging evidence suggests that the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS), traditionally recognized for cardiovascular regulation, plays a pivotal role in neurological pathologies 24 26 27 29 30 35 36 Technological limitations have hindered real-time assessment of glymphatic system dynamics. Conventional imaging modalities lack the spatiotemporal resolution to capture rapid fluid transport or parenchymal clearance. Recent advances in near-infrared II (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging (1,000-1,700 nm) overcome these barriers, offering deep-tissue penetration, high resolution, and minimal autofluorescence 37 40 Materials and Methods Animals All C57BL/6 male mice, aged 8-10 weeks, were purchased from Jilin Qianhe Model Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Their weights were maintained between 23 and 25 g. The mice were housed under a standard 12 h light/dark cycle in specific pathogen-free conditions, with controlled temperature (23 ± 1.5 °C) and humidity (50 ± 10%). They had unrestricted access to bedding, nesting materials, food, and water. All mouse experiments were conducted in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of Jilin University and approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the First Hospital of Jilin University (Scheme No.: 20240624-12). Mice were randomly allocated to different experimental groups, and individuals blinded to the group assignments performed experiments and data collection. TBI The closed-head TBI model was established using a modified weight drop device based on previously described methodologies 41 42 Drug administration and experimental design C21 (HY-100113, MedChemExpress), a highly specific AT2R receptor agonist, was dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Mice received intraperitoneal injection of C21 (0.03 mg/kg) or PBS 1 h after TBI, followed by two additional doses at 24 and 48 h post-injury. The selected dosage was determined according to previously established optimal efficacy parameters for stroke treatment 43 Behavioral tests Behavioral assessments included the modified neurological severity score (mNSS), rotarod test, novel object recognition (NOR) test, open field test (OFT) and Morris water maze (MWM) test (methodological details in Supplementary Information Synthesis of probes BSA@IR-780, IR-808, and IR-808Ac were synthesized following previously methods 40 44 Construction of the NIR-II fluorescence imaging system For detailed NIR-II imaging setup procedures, refer to relevant classical literature 45 46 Intracisternal tracer infusions Under ISO anesthesia, mice were fixed in a stereotactic frame. BSA@IR-780 was dissolved in artificial CSF at a concentration of 300 μM. After surgically exposing the cisterna magna (CM), a PE10 tube filled with BSA@IR-780 was inserted into the CM using a 30-gauge needle bridge. The inserted PE10 tube was first sealed with 3M vetbond tissue adhesive and reinforced with dental cement. Subsequently, dexmedetomidine (DEX) was dissolved in PBS and injected intraperitoneally (0.2 mg/kg). After 5 min, a syringe pump (Harvard Instruments) was used to deliver 7 μL of BSA@IR-780 at a rate of 1 μL/min. A heating pad was used to maintain the body temperature at 36.5-37 °C. Visualization of BSA@IR-780 influx into brain The influx of BSA@IR-780 into the mouse brain was monitored using an NIR-II fluorescence imaging system we had constructed. The brain was focused on the field view of ~2.8 × 2.3 cm². The distribution was monitored for 30 min with an interval of 5 min. After allowing the NIR-II tracer to circulate for 30 min, the brain was collected and the tracer distribution on the dorsal and ventral brain surfaces was imaged. The imaging conditions were 10 ms, 1200 nm long-pass filter, and 65 mW/cm 2 The brain was then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 h. Coronal slices (100-μm thick) were prepared using a vibratome. A total of twelve slices were collected at 300 μm intervals, starting 1.6 mm anterior to bregma, to calculate the mean total tracer influx for the entire brain. The slices were imaged using a scanning imaging system (Azurespot). Visualization of the BSA@IR-780 drainage into superficial CLNs Mouse hair was shaved prior to imaging to expose the neck skin. Infusions were performed with mice in a prone position. After completing intracisternal infusion of BSA@IR-780, mice were placed supine for superficial CLNs imaging. The first image was acquired 10 min post-infusion start, with tracer movement monitored for 60 min at 5-min intervals. Imaging parameters: 10-ms exposure, 1200 nm long-pass filter, 65 mW/cm² power density. Intra-parenchymal injections To evaluate the clearance capacity of parenchymal metabolites, 2 μL of the NIR-II probe IR-808Ac (50 μM, dissolved in artificial CSF) or IR-808 (2.5 μM, dissolved in artificial CSF) was injected into the cerebral cortex of mice using stereotaxic technique. Mice were anesthetized with 4% ISO for 1 min, followed by maintenance with 1% ISO. The skull was exposed, and the periosteum was removed. A 33-gauge stainless-steel cannula (Hamilton) was inserted into the cerebral cortex at the following stereotactic coordinates: 2.00 mm posterior, 1.50 mm lateral to the bregma, and 2.00 mm below the brain surface. After 5 min of intubation, the injection was administered at 0.2 μL/min. After the injection, the needle was removed following a 5-min rest period, and NIR-II imaging of the mouse brain was conducted immediately. FITC-labeled β-amyloid (1-42) (P2000022-FITC, PLLABS) was dissolved in artificial CSF at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. A 2-μL volume of the solution was injected into the brain parenchyma of mice using the same technique. The mice were then returned to their cages and allowed to move freely for 4 h. Subsequently, mice were anesthetized with chloral hydrate and perfused with cold PBS. The brains were harvested and fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C for 24 h, sectioned into 100-μm thick slices, and the residual β-amyloid on the slices was observed under a confocal microscope (FV3000, Olympus). Visualization of NIR-II probes clearance from brain Using our custom NIR-II fluorescence imaging system, we monitored IR-808Ac clearance from the mouse brain within a field of view of ~2.8 × 2.3 cm². Immediately after injecting IR-808Ac into the parenchyma, we performed the initial NIR-II brain imaging. Mice were then returned to their cages without activity restrictions, with two additional imaging sessions conducted at 1-h intervals. All in vivo The percentage of IR-808Ac cleared from the mouse brain was calculated as clearance efficiency using the following formula: Clearance efficiency (%) = [(initial fluorescence intensity - current fluorescence intensity) / initial fluorescence intensity] × 100 Then, the brain was collected. Both dorsal and ventral surfaces were imaged (dorsal: 10 ms, 1200 nm long-pass filter, 65 mW/cm²; ventral: 100 ms, 1200 nm long-pass filter, 65 mW/cm²) to assess the residual tracer. Brains were then fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h. Using a vibratome, we prepared 100-μm-thick coronal slices. Six slices, collected at 300-μm intervals starting 0.8 mm posterior to bregma, were imaged using an Azurespot scanning system. After intraparenchymal injection of IR-808, the tracer was cleared into the peripheral circulation. IR-808 accumulation in the femoral vein was monitored using our NIR-II fluorescence imaging system within a field of view of ~2.8 × 2.3 cm². Prior to imaging, the mouse leg was shaved to expose the skin. Immediately following IR-808 injection, the mouse was positioned supine for imaging of the leg vasculature. Continuous monitoring was performed for 60 min at 5-min intervals under the following imaging parameters: 100 ms exposure, 1200 nm long-pass filter, and 65 mW/cm² power density. Immunofluorescence Mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused with cold PBS. Their brains were removed and fixed in 4% PFA at 4 °C overnight, then dehydrated in 15% and 30% sucrose solutions. After dehydration, the brains were immersed in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Torrance, California, USA) and sectioned into 30-μm slices using a cryostat microtome (CM1950, Leica Biosystems, Nurock, Germany). The tissue sections were washed with PBS and sealed with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature for 1.5 h. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies, followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature with secondary antibodies. The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-AQP4 (1:500, CL488-16473, Proteintech), hamster (Armenian) anti-CD31 (1:400, MAB1398Z, Merck), chicken anti-GFAP (1:500, PA1-10004, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and rabbit anti-Iba1 (1:500, AB178846 AQP4 polarization evaluation To assess AQP4 polarization after TBI, we employed an established area-based method 23 47 As an alternative approach, we quantified AQP4 polarization using immunofluorescence signals for AQP4 and the vascular marker CD31, following previous researches 48 50 AQP4 polarization = perivascular peak intensity / average baseline intensity Measurement of CBF CBF was measured using a laser Doppler blood flow meter. Briefly, after anesthetizing the mice as described earlier, a midline scalp incision was made to expose the skull. The CBF of both hemispheres was then recorded using a laser speckle imager. Measurement of mean arterial pressure (MAP) MedLab non-invasive blood pressure analysis system (NJKEWBIO, Nanjing, China) was used to measure the MAP of mice. Place the mouse on a 37-39°C heating platform or in a thermostatic chamber for 5-10 min to promote tail vasodilation and enhance signal clarity. Gently restrain the mouse in a specialized holder, ensuring natural tail extension through the tail cuff sensor. Maintain unobstructed respiration by avoiding thoracic compression. Clean the tail with alcohol swabs to remove debris, then position the tail cuff approximately 1-2 cm from the tail base. Adjust cuff tension to achieve effective blood flow occlusion without tissue compression. Initialize the system and perform baseline calibration as per software instructions. The automated protocol initiates with cuff inflation to 150 mmHg (surpassing typical systolic pressure). Gradual deflation (2-3 mmHg/s) enables detection of hemodynamic parameters: systolic blood pressure (SBP) corresponds to the pulse wave reappearance point, while diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is identified at complete blood flow restoration. Conduct triplicate measurements, discarding outliers before calculating mean values. Derive MAP using the standard formula: MAP = DBP + 1/3(SBP - DBP) Heart rate and respiratory rate monitoring The methods for measuring heart rate and respiratory rate in mice were consistent with those described in previous studies 40 RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) Total RNA was extracted from the cortical tissue using TRIzol® Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Magen). RNA samples were detected based on the A260/A280 absorbance ratio with a Nanodrop ND-2000 system (Thermo Scientific, USA), and the RIN of RNA was determined by an Agilent Bioanalyzer 4150 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Only qualified samples will be used for library construction. Paired-end libraries were prepared using ABclonal mRNA-seq Lib Prep Kit (ABclonal, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA was purified from 1 μg total RNA using oligo (dT) magnetic beads followed by fragmentation carried out using divalent cations at elevated temperatures in ABclonal First Strand Synthesis Reaction Buffer. Subsequently, first-strand cDNAs were synthesized with random hexamer primers and Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H) using mRNA fragments as templates, followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis using DNA polymerase I, RNAseH, buffer, and dNTPs. The synthesized double stranded cDNA fragments were then adapter-ligated for preparation of the paired-end library. Adaptor-ligated cDNA was used for PCR amplification. PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system) and library quality was assessed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 4150 system. Finally, sequencing was performed with an Illumina Novaseq 6000/MGISEQ-T7 instrument. The data generated from Illumina/BGI platform were used for bioinformatics analysis. Western blot Mice were perfused with cold PBS, and their brains were extracted. Tissue samples were collected from near the cerebral cortex around the injury site. Total proteins were extracted from each group using protease and phosphatase inhibitors (P1260, Beijing, China) and loaded onto 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were then transferred on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes using a wet electrotransfer device (Bio-Rad). The PVDF membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific primary antibodies, including: rabbit anti-pERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) (1:3000, 28733-1-AP, Proteintech), rabbit anti-ERK1/2 (1:3000, A4782, ABclonal), mouse anti-Tau5 (1:2000, MA5-12808, Thermo Fisher Scientific), rabbit anti-pTau-Thr205 (1:2000, AP0168, ABclonal), rabbit anti-pTau-Ser396 (1:2000, 9632T, Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit anti-pTau-Ser404 (1:2000, 44-758G, Thermo Fisher Scientific). After incubation, the membranes were washed thrice. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and protein bands were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (MilliporeSigma). Statistical analysis All image analyses were performed using ImageJ, and statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism 8. Data in all graphs are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), with individual data points and lines representing values from each mouse. Comparisons between two groups were performed using Student's t-test, whereas one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test was applied for comparisons across three or more groups. Two-way ANOVA was employed to analyze interactions between continuous variables. For datasets violating assumptions of normality or homogeneity of variances, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare medians across three groups, followed by Dunn's test for multiple comparisons. Statistical significance was defined as *p* < 0.05. Results AT2R activation improved neurological recovery after TBI To investigate the impact of AT2R activation on neurological recovery after TBI, we performed behavioral tests assessing motor and cognitive functions (Figure 1 1 1 1 1 1 AT2R activation enhanced glymphatic influx in acute TBI mice The restoration of glymphatic transport following TBI plays a critical role in neurological recovery 10 Figure S1 2 19 51 Figure S2 2 Following 30 minutes of in vivo ex vivo in vivo 2 2 2 After injection of BSA@IR-780, we used NIR-II imaging to quantitatively assess its drainage into the superficial CLNs (Figure 2 2 AT2R activation promoted glymphatic clearance in acute TBI mice To assess the effect of AT2R activation on glymphatic clearance in mice 3 days post-TBI, we first evaluated the parenchymal clearance of IR-808Ac (Figure 3 Figure S3 3 44 19 51 Figure S4 3 These findings were further validated using ex vivo 3 3 3 3 3 We further utilized IR-808 to assess glymphatic clearance (Figure 3 3 44 52 in vivo 3 3 AT2R activation restored AQP4 polarization and CBF in acute TBI mice Decreased AQP4 polarization is a key mechanism underlying glymphatic system dysfunction after TBI 11 4 4 Under pathological conditions, the glymphatic system modulates microglial activation in the perilesional cortex 53 54 4 supplementary methods 4 4 The regulation of the glymphatic system involves dynamic interactions between blood pressure and CBF 55 58 59 4 4 Figure S5 AT2R activation inhibited neuroinflammatory responses in acute TBI mice RNA-seq analysis of the perilesional cortex at 3 days post-TBI revealed a dynamic immune modulation induced by C21 treatment (Figure 5 Figure S6 Figure S7 5 Figure S8 Figure S8 5 5 5 In addition, RNA-seq analysis revealed that the AT2R signaling pathway involves the ERK1/2, a key regulator of brain injury and repair 60 Figure S9 Figure S10 AT2R activation suppressed β-amyloid and phosphorylated tau accumulation in chronic TBI mice TBI-induced impairment of the glymphatic system persists in the chronic phase 10 6 ex vivo 6 Figure S11 The accumulation of β-amyloid and phosphorylated tau following TBI has been identified as a direct contributor to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases 61 62 6 6 6 6 Discussion This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of C21 in regulating glymphatic system function following TBI. Leveraging the unique physicochemical properties of NIR-II probes, we developed a multimodal NIR-II imaging platform to visualize both glymphatic influx and glymphatic clearance, enabling real-time dynamic monitoring of glymphatic transport in vivo 7 TBI impairs the function of glymphatic system through mechanical impact and neuroinflammatory pathways, manifesting as reduced AQP4 polarization and obstructed CSF-ISF circulation. These disruptions lead to diminished clearance of metabolic waste and neurotoxic proteins (e.g., β-amyloid, phosphorylated tau), ultimately contributing to neurological dysfunction 11 21 63 64 30 31 33 To investigate the AT2R modulation of post-TBI glymphatic influx, we first employed NIR-II imaging to track the CSF-mediated transport dynamics of BSA@IR-780 from the subarachnoid space to the brain parenchyma. The whole-brain macroscopic visualization capability of NIR-II imaging enabled precise mapping of tracer influx through the PVS across cortical surfaces. Our analyses revealed that TBI substantially compromises glymphatic influx, manifesting as a significantly delayed tracer influx. Crucially, C21-mediated AT2R activation effectively restored the influx of BSA@IR-780 and increased its flow speed in the PVS. NIR-II imaging was also employed to non-invasively monitor the drainage of BSA@IR-780 into the superficial CLNs. The results confirmed that AT2R activation enhances drainage into superficial CLNs. This dynamic macroscopic imaging approach provides clearer visualization of glymphatic transport impairment induced by TBI, while highlighting the protective effects of AT2R activation in restoring glymphatic drainage function post-TBI. In addition, this study introduced an innovative approach using NIR-II probes to monitor the dynamic parenchymal clearance process in real-time, including albumin-escaping IR-808Ac capable of direct and real-time visualization of solute clearance in the brain parenchyma, and albumin-seeking IR-808 designed to track the dynamic of clearance solute from the brain into the blood circulation. This method provides a more precise and less invasive evaluation of glymphatic clearance in mice. Our results showed that the increased clearance efficiency of IR-808Ac in the brain parenchyma and the elevated fluorescence intensity of IR-808 in the femoral vein clearly indicated that AT2R activation enhanced glymphatic clearance following TBI. This innovative approach advances our understanding of the glymphatic clearance mechanism and highlights the therapeutic potential of AT2R activation in mitigating TBI-induced impairment of glymphatic clearance function. Studies have established that TBI triggers diffuse reactive astrogliosis, culminating in hypertrophic glial scarring. This process disrupts perivascular AQP4 polarization and spatial distribution, representing a primary pathophysiological mechanism underlying post-TBI glymphatic system impairment 20 33 65 Blood pressure regulation is crucial following TBI, as hemodynamic instability may disrupt cerebral arterial pulsations and subsequently impair the glymphatic system function 58 66 67 59 68 The neuroinflammatory response following TBI involves complex interactions with glymphatic dysfunction. Post-TBI inflammatory factors impair AQP4 polarization, which exacerbating glymphatic transport impairment and amplifying neuroinflammation 11 69 70 60 71 73 Evidence indicates that TBI induces persistent glymphatic system impairment in murine models, with functional deficits persisting up to 6 months post-injury 10 21 Conclusion In this study, we employed NIR-II imaging to dynamically visualize glymphatic transport in mice, showing that C21-mediated AT2R activation enhanced glymphatic influx and promoted glymphatic clearance in TBI mice. Mechanistically, AT2R activation restored AQP4 polarization and simultaneously suppressed reactive astrogliosis, microglial activation, and neuroinflammatory responses. Furthermore, AT2R activation enhanced β-amyloid clearance efficiency and reduced phosphorylated tau accumulation, thereby contributing to improved post-traumatic neurological recovery. Collectively, these findings establish the critical role of AT2R in restoring post-TBI glymphatic function and identify it as a promising therapeutic target for TBI.
