Background Sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, has demonstrated efficacy in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study aimed to investigate the effects of sitagliptin on gut microbial composition and gut barrier integrity in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of T2DM. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups ( n Result Alpha index metrics, including observed feature number and Shannon index, were significantly decreased in the T2DM group compared to the ND group. Sitagliptin treatment led to a significant restoration of these indices. Principal coordinate analysis based on Bray-Curtis distances revealed distinct clustering between the ND and T2DM groups, with sitagliptin shifting the microbial profile of diabetic rats toward that of healthy controls. Sitagliptin treatment increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Clostridium_IV Romboutsia Alloprevotella Parasutterella Conclusion Sitagliptin effectively ameliorates gut microbial dysbiosis and restores intestinal barrier function in STZ-induced T2DM rats.

One of the key mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of T2DM is dysfunction of the intestinal barrier, which leads to increased gut permeability ( Kelly et al., 2015 Cani et al., 2007 Wu et al., 2020 Canfora et al., 2019 Régnier et al., 2021 Sitagliptin, a well-established dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, is widely prescribed for the treatment of T2DM. Its primary mechanism of action involves inhibiting DPP-4 activity to prevent the degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone secreted by intestinal L-cells ( Bodnaruc et al., 2016 Ross and Ekoé, 2010 Ning et al., 2020 Yasuda et al., 2024 2016 Liao et al., 2019 Yan et al., 2016 Zhang et al., 2019 The gut microbiome, comprising trillions of microorganisms and thousands of diverse species, functions as a complex and dynamic ecosystem. Microbial members interact through the exchange of metabolites, signaling molecules, and genetic material, engaging in intricate ecological networks that influence host physiology ( Li et al., 2020 Layeghifard et al., 2017 Cao et al., 2022 Chen et al., 2020 Li et al., 2020 Sun et al., 2023 Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that sitagliptin may ameliorate T2DM not only through systemic glucose regulation but also by modulating the gut microbiome and improving intestinal barrier integrity. To validate this hypothesis, we assessed tight junction protein expression and goblet cell abundance, which are established markers of gut barrier health, in parallel with gut microbial community profiling. This study aims to provide new insights into the broader biological effects of sitagliptin, particularly its influence on gut microbial ecology and gut integrity during the progression of T2DM. Material and methods Establishment of the diabetic rat model Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats aged 6 to 8 weeks, weighing 110 ± 20 g, were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Chongqing Medical University. Animals were acclimated for 1 week under controlled environmental conditions: a 12-h light/dark cycle, relative humidity of 45 ± 10%, and temperature of 21 ± 2 °C. During this period, rats had ad libitum access to water and a standard laboratory chow diet (10% calories from fat). Following acclimatization, rats were randomly assigned to a control group (ND) or a high-fat diet (HFD) group. The ND group received a standard laboratory chow diet (10% fat, 20% protein, and 70% carbohydrates), while the HFD group received a high-fat diet (45% fat, 20% protein, and 35% carbohydrates; Medicine Ltd., Jiangshu, China) for 12 weeks. At the end of the dietary intervention, rats in the HFD group received an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 30 mg/kg; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO) dissolved in 0.1 mol/L citrate buffer (pH 4.5), while the ND group received an equal volume of citrate buffer. After 72 h following STZ injection, random blood glucose levels were measured from tail vein blood using a glucometer. The T2DM model was successfully replicated in rats with random blood glucose levels exceeding 16.7 mmol/L, according to previous report ( Tawulie et al., 2023 Of the 16 rats subjected to HFD+STZ treatment, 12 met the criteria for diabetes and were subsequently randomized into two groups: vehicle-treated T2DM (T2DM, n n n n Yan et al., 2016 All animal protocols were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Animal Center of Chongqing Medical University and conducted in accordance with the institutional Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Fasting blood glucose and body weight measurement Fasting blood glucose was measured using a Bayer Contour TS glucometer and test strips (Bayer, Hamburg, Germany). Body weight was recorded post-treatment for all rats. Fecal DNA extraction, sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis Microbial DNA was extracted from fecal samples using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol. The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were amplified using primer 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′) and 806R (5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′). PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, pooled in equal concentrations and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq platform using a paired-end read mode. Sequencing quality was assessed using FastQC, and high-quality reads were processed using Mothur ( Schloss et al., 2009 Quast et al., 2013 Edgar et al., 2011 Wang et al., 2007 Douglas et al., 2020 Wen et al., 2022 Quantification of short-chain fatty acids in fecal samples Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Standard stock solution A was prepared by dissolving eight SCFAs (acetic, butyric, hexanoic, isobutyric, isohexanoic, isovaleric, propionic, and valeric acids) in HPLC-grade n n For sample preparation, 25 mg of feces was homogenized with 500 μL of 0.5% phosphoric acid solution at 50 Hz, followed by ultrasonication and centrifugation (13,000 g, 4 °C, 15 min). The supernatant (200 μL) was extracted with n Analysis was performed using an Agilent 8890B GC system coupled with a 5977B/7000D MS and equipped with an HP-FFAP capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The oven temperature was programmed to increase from 80 °C to 120 °C at 40 °C/min, then to 200 °C at 5 °C/min, and held at 220 °C for 3 min. Data acquisition and compound quantification were performed using MassHunter software. Quality control samples were run every 5–10 samples to ensure system consistency. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis Colons were harvested, rinsed with PBS, fixed overnight in 4% formaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 4 μm thickness were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Alcian blue-periodic acid–Schiff (AB-PAS) stain to visualize goblet cells, which were stained blue. Goblet cell density was quantified as the number of goblet cells per intestinal villus. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a modified streptavidin–HRP method (CoWin Century Biotechnology, China). Briefly, paraffin sections were deparaffinized, endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using 0.3% H 2 2 Western blotting analysis Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Equal amounts of total protein (20 μg per lane) were separated by 8–10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. After transfer, the membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-ZO-1 (1:1000, ab276131, Abcam), anti-Claudin (1:1000, ab307692, Abcam), anti-IL-1β (1:1000, TA384520M, Origene), anti-IL-6 (1:1000, TA384528S, Origene), anti-NF-κB (1:2000, TA890002M, Origene), and anti-β-actin (1:1000, PMK081M/S, Bioprimacy). After washing with TBST, membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.

Reversal of SCFAs in response to sitagliptin treatment Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified via GC-MS, including acetic, butyric, hexanoic, isobutyric, isohexanoic, isovaleric, propanoic, and valeric acids. The T2DM group exhibited significantly lower levels of butyric, hexanoic, isobutyric, isohexanoic, and isovaleric acids compared to the ND group ( Figure 4c Sitagliptin improves intestinal barrier integrity To investigate the effects of sitagliptin on intestinal barrier integrity, histological and western blot analyses were performed on colonic tissues. PAS-Alcian blue staining revealed an increased number of mucus-secreting goblet cells in the T2DM-Sit group compared to the T2DM group ( Figure 5a Figure 5 Sitagliptin enhances gut barrier integrity in diabetic rats.

Panel (c) presents Western blot analyses for Claudin-1, ZO-1, IL-1β, IL-6, NF-κB, and β-actin, highlighting differences across the groups. Panel (d) displays bar graphs comparing protein normalization to β-actin, with significant p-values annotated. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to assess the expression of tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Claudin-1. Compared with the ND group, the T2DM group showed a significant reduction in ZO-1- and Claudin-1-positive cells. Notably, sitagliptin treatment markedly restored ZO-1 expression, whereas Claudin-1 levels increased without significance ( Figure 5b Figures 5c d In addition, western blot analysis revealed that proinflammatory markers NF-κB, IL-1β, and IL-6 were significantly elevated in the T2DM group but were markedly suppressed following sitagliptin treatment ( Figures 5c d Discussion Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that T2DM is associated with impaired gut barrier function and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Sitagliptin, one of the most commonly prescribed medications for T2DM, has been extensively studied for its glycemic regulatory effects. In our study, sitagliptin administration significantly reduced blood glucose levels in diabetic rats although not to normoglycemic levels, consistent with previous findings ( Yan et al., 2016 The gut barrier plays a crucial role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis by acting as a selective filter, degrading pathogens and antigens, preventing microbial adhesion and colonization, and initiating appropriate immune responses. Tight junctions, composed of transmembrane proteins such as claudins and cytoplasmic scaffolding proteins like ZO-1, are essential for the regulation of intestinal permeability ( Chelakkot et al., 2018 Murugesan et al., 2025 Yasuda et al., 2024 The gut microbiota is an integral component of the intestinal barrier and plays a pivotal role in the maturation of mucosal barrier function, immune system development, nutrient absorption, and energy metabolism. In this study, we investigated the impact of sitagliptin on the intestinal microbiota of diabetic rats using 16S rRNA gene sequencing targeting the V3–V4 region. Diabetic rats exhibited significantly reduced alpha microbial diversity compared to the normal diet (ND) group, a finding consistent with previous reports ( Yan et al., 2016 Liao et al., 2019 Yan et al., 2016 Consistent with previous studies ( Liao et al., 2019 Yan et al., 2016 Alloprevotella Parasutterella Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Ruminococcus, Clostridium_IV, Romboutsia Lactobacillus Alloprevotella Parasutterella Alloprevotella Pinna et al., 2021 Parasutterella Fernandez-Quintela et al., 2023 Lactobacillus Yan et al., 2016 Fernandez-Quintela et al., 2023 Lactobacillus TNF- Wang et al., 2018 Yan et al., 2019 Ruminococcus Yan et al., 2016 Cunningham et al., 2021 Streptococcus thermophilus Gao et al., 2019 Lactobacillus acidophilu S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus Tiderencel et al., 2020 Romboutsia Chen et al., 2021 Salamone et al., 2021 Martin-Gallausiaux et al., 2021 Arora and Tremaroli, 2021 Lactobacillus Ruminococcus Fusco et al., 2023 Parada Venegas et al., 2019 Peng et al., 2009 At the functional level, several metabolic functional pathways, such as PRPP-PWY, PENTOSE-P-PWY, PANTO-PWY, PANTOSYN-PWY, SER-GLYSYN-PWY, PWY-7456, and GLYCOCAT-PWY, showed significant alterations between the ND and T2DM groups. Sitagliptin treatment effectively reversed these changes. Notably, PENTOSE-P-PWY and SER-GLYSYN-PWY have been previously linked to metabolic syndrome and T2DM ( Li et al., 2023 Ge et al., 2020 Moreover, analysis of gut microbial network parameters revealed significant alterations in the gut microbial community structure of T2DM rats, characterized by reduced connectivity and disrupted modular organization. These changes suggest a loss of microbial ecosystem stability commonly observed in metabolic disorders. Notably, sitagliptin treatment restored network complexity and increased interactions, which may contribute to improved gut barrier function and reduced systemic inflammation. These findings align with emerging evidence that microbial network integrity plays a critical role in host metabolic homeostasis ( Huang et al., 2023 Interestingly, sitagliptin administration in ND rats (ND-Sit group) led to a significant reduction in the number of observed features and a downward trend in the Shannon index compared to the untreated ND group. One possible explanation is that DPP-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin can influence host–microbiota interactions by modulating incretin levels, gut hormone secretion, and intestinal motility, which in turn could affect microbial diversity. Previous studies have shown that GLP-1, which is upregulated by DPP-4 inhibition, may impact gut barrier function and microbial ecology even in healthy subjects ( Zhang et al., 2019 Zeng et al., 2024 While our findings demonstrate that sitagliptin modulates gut microbial composition and improves intestinal barrier integrity, the underlying molecular or cellular mechanisms contributing to these extra-glycemic effects remain largely unclear. Sitagliptin is known to inhibit DPP-4, an enzyme expressed not only in plasma but also in intestinal epithelial and immune cells, suggesting potential local effects within the gut ( Yan et al., 2016 Zhang et al., 2019 Zeng et al., 2024 Despite these promising findings, several limitations should be acknowledged. This study employed 16S rRNA gene sequencing with functional predictions based on PICRUSt2, which, while informative, require validation through direct metabolomic and metatranscriptomic analyses, and metagenomic sequencing for a deeper exploration of microbial functions and interactions at species or strain levels. The observed effects in the rodent model also warrant confirmation in human cohorts and mechanistic exploration using germ-free or transgenic animal models. To more comprehensively evaluate the protective effects of sitagliptin on gut epithelial integrity, future studies should incorporate direct permeability assays such as the FITC-dextran test. Moreover, the lack of measurements of key inflammatory markers (e.g., serum LPS) and circulating GLP-1 levels limits the interpretation of systemic inflammation and GLP-1–mediated mechanisms. The sitagliptin intervention period was limited to 12 weeks, and it remains unclear whether the observed benefits on gut microbiota and barrier function are sustained long-term. Future studies with prolonged treatment durations and comparative interventions, such as metformin, will be necessary to clarify the durability and specificity of these effects. In summary, this study provides novel evidence that sitagliptin not only improves glycemic control but also exerts restorative effects on gut microbiota composition, diversity, and function, as well as intestinal barrier integrity in a T2DM rat model. These findings highlight the potential of sitagliptin as a therapeutic agent with multifaceted benefits, underscoring the critical role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis and treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
