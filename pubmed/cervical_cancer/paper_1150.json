A total of 83 samples were collected, consisting of 30 cloacal swabs and 53 environmental samples: soil (n = 6), drinking water (n = 7), feed (n = 8), cage swabs (n = 10), feeding trough swabs (n = 6), ventilator swabs (n = 6), water dispenser swabs (n = 6), and workers' hand swabs (n = 4). All specimens were transported to the laboratory on ice. A questionnaire survey was carried out to assess the use of antibiotics on the farm. The antibiotics administered to the farm do not necessarily reflect those used for this batch of chickens. The antibiotics utilized on the farm included amoxicillin, tetracycline, tylosin, enrofloxacin, lincomycin, florfenicol, and doxycycline, which were regularly incorporated into the feed and drinking water for disease treatment purposes. Sample processing and bacterial isolation Water samples (600 mL) were filtered through 0.45 μm membranes. Feed (5 g) and soil (5 g) were homogenized in 45 mL LB broth. Swabs and pre-processed samples were enriched in LB broth supplemented with 2 μg/mL meropenem and incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking (180 rpm). After enrichment, 100 μL of each sample was plated on MacConkey agar containing 2 μg/mL meropenem and incubated at 36±1°C for 18–24 h. Distinct colonies were purified and identified by PCR amplification. The 16S rRNA and blaNDM genes of the strains were amplified and sequenced. bla Antibiotic susceptibility testing The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the bla NDM-13 E. coli E. coli Whole genome sequencing and assembly Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted according to the instruction manual of the NucleoBond® HMW DNA kit (MN NucleoBond, Germany, 740160.20), and the purity and concentration of genomic DNA were determined via Qubit4.0 (Thermo, Q33226 Bioinformatics analysis The acquired resistance genes, SNP, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) were analyzed using ResFinder 4.7.2, CSIPhylogeny, and MLST 2.0 ( https://www.genomic.epidemiology.org/services/ Conjugation experiment Isolates containing the bla NDM-13 E.coli Stability of plasmid and growth rate determination The plasmid stability of transconjugants was determined by a passaging experiment as a previous study. Three single clones of transconjugants were inoculated into 2 mL antibiotic-free LB broth. Following overnight incubation, the culture was diluted at a ratio of 1:1000 into 2 mL of antibiotic-free LB broth. Dilution and serial passage were performed every 24 h for 15 consecutive days. Bacterial enumeration was performed by inoculating samples onto MacConkey agar plates as well as MacConkey agar plates containing 2 μg/mL of meropenem.The growth rate of the transconjugant was determined as previously described. Growth curves were determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer.
