Summary Background Endometriosis and uterine fibroids are estrogen-dependent gynecological disorders with an increasing burden to women’s health worldwide. Despite overlapping symptoms and long-term consequences, the magnitude of their co-occurrence remains unclear. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus up to July 21st, 2025, for studies reporting data on fibroids occurrence in patients with and without endometriosis. Effect estimates (adjusted or, if unavailable, crude) were pooled using random-effects models. Age and body mass index (BMI) were explored in uni- and multivariate meta-regressions. Subgroup analyses considered study design, data source, geographic location, parity, age and study quality. Sensitivity analysis included only asymptomatic controls without endometriosis. Study quality and certainty of evidence were assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidelines, respectively. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024614711). Findings 4351 articles were identified, of which 23 met eligibility criteria, including 3,109,231 patients (118,716 with endometriosis and 2,990,515 controls). Endometriosis was associated with higher odds of fibroids (pooled OR 2.91; 95% CI, 1.78–4.75). BMI influenced estimates (p < 0.01). Between-group differences in data source (p < 0.01) and study quality (p = 0.03) were observed. Parity showed a trend effect: OR 1.56 (95% CI: 0.53–4.59) for studies with >50% nulliparous women, 4.52 (95% CI: 2.53–8.10) for those with >50% multiparous, 5.23 (95% CI, 2.09–13.04) for studies with >95% multiparous women. In sensitivity analysis with only asymptomatic controls (n = 3,103,146), the OR increased to 7.01 (95% CI: 4.72–10.41). Interpretation This first meta-analysis on the co-occurrence of endometriosis and fibroids shows that women with endometriosis have a three-to tenfold higher odds of fibroids compared with controls. Clinical awareness of this association is crucial to optimize both patient management and short- and long-term women’s health outcomes.

Despite overlapping symptoms and potential long-term consequences, the extent of their co-occurrence remains unclear, and no prior meta-analysis had addressed this association. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Scopus from inception to July 21st, 2025, for studies reporting fibroid occurrence in women with and without endometriosis, using controlled vocabulary and free-text terms for both conditions. Effect estimates were pooled with random-effects models, and meta-regression explored the influence of age and body mass index. Prespecified subgroup analyses accounted for study design, data source, geographic location, parity, age, and study quality. Study quality and certainty of evidence were assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and the GRADE framework. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024614711). Added value of this study This first meta-analysis on endometriosis and fibroids, encompassing 23 studies and over three million women, found nearly threefold higher odds of fibroids in those with endometriosis. The association was consistent across sensitivity analyses, stronger in high-quality studies, in populations with more multiparous women, and when compared with asymptomatic controls from the general population. Body mass index was positively associated with effect size, while age had minimal influence except in analyses restricted to asymptomatic controls. Despite high heterogeneity and low certainty of evidence, the consistent direction and magnitude across diverse settings strengthen the epidemiological link between these conditions. Implications of all the available evidence Women with endometriosis face an increased risk of fibroids compared to controls without endometriosis. Given their overlapping symptoms and the possibility that co-occurrence may reduce treatment effectiveness for endometriosis, heightened clinical awareness is essential to improve diagnostic accuracy, optimize management, and enhance patient satisfaction. Introduction Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent disease affecting 5–10% of women of reproductive age 1 2 Years of research on endometriosis increasingly highlight that fully understanding its pathogenesis, symptoms, and long-term outcomes requires accounting for concomitant factors and comorbidities that significantly shape individual prognosis. 3 4 , 5 6 , 7 8 9 10 Among uterine diseases, uterine fibroids (also known as leiomyomas) are the most prevalent benign uterine tumors, affecting up to 25% of women and representing a major contributor to gynecological morbidity. 11 12 Emerging evidence suggests that women with fibroids have a significantly higher occurrence of gynecological and systemic comorbidities, particularly endometriosis and, in some cases, infertility. 13 14 This meta-analysis aims to provide a comprehensive quantitative assessment of the association between uterine fibroids and endometriosis. By determining whether the presence of endometriosis significantly increases the likelihood of uterine fibroids, we seek to refine an integrated clinical approach that could enhance early detection of co-occurring disease and optimize long-term health outcomes for millions of endometriosis-affected women worldwide. Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) and the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. 15 , 16 17 Search strategy and information sources Two reviewers (A.F. and L.S.) searched the literature up to July 21st, 2025, using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. Disagreements were resolved by consultation with a third reviewer (N.S.). The search algorithm incorporated terms relevant to endometriosis and uterine fibroids. The full search strategy is provided in the Supplementary Material 1 The literature search was conducted without restrictions on publication year or geographic location. Only peer-reviewed, full-text manuscripts written in English were assessed for eligibility. Bibliographies of relevant studies were reviewed to identify any relevant publication not retrieved in the initial search. Eligibility criteria and study selection Studies were included if they provided adjusted or crude estimates of the occurrence of uterine fibroids in patients with and without endometriosis, or if such estimates could be calculated from the reported data. Exclusion criteria were: i) descriptive studies (case reports, case series) or those without original data (reviews, abstracts, editorials, comments); ii) in vitro or animal studies; iii) studies in which all patients with endometriosis had fibroids, precluding the estimation of true co-occurrence rates and meaningful comparisons with controls; iv) studies where fibroid occurrence could not be distinguished from other uterine conditions (e.g., adenomyosis). Data extraction The following data were collected and tabulated: i) first author and year of publication; ii) country, study design, and data source; iii) sample size, and number of cases and controls; iv) characteristics of the study population, categorized as: a) women undergoing surgery for gynecological conditions, b) women presenting with gynecological symptoms, or c) women attending outpatient clinics for routine check-ups without gynecological symptoms or concerns; v) number of women with uterine fibroids in both case and control groups; vi) baseline characteristics of the study population, including age, body mass index (BMI), parity, infertility status, and other available variables. Quality assessment and certainty of the evidence The quality of the included studies was assessed by three reviewers (A.F., C.F. and B.M.) using the Newcastle–Ottawa scale (NOS), 18 19 20 The certainty of the evidence was graded according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines 21 Data analysis Adjusted odds ratios (adjORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted whenever available. If adjORs were not reported, raw data on the occurrence of uterine fibroids in women with and without endometriosis were extracted from the original studies and organized into 2 × 2 contingency tables, from which crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated. The standard errors (SEs) of both adjORs and ORs were computed accordingly. All effect estimates and SEs were subsequently pooled using a random-effects (RE) meta-analysis model, with between-study variance (τ 2 Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the Q test 22 2 23 2 24 The potential impact of publication bias and small-study effects on pooled estimates was assessed through visual inspection of funnel plot asymmetry and quantified using Egger’s linear regression test 25 26 A meta-regression analysis was performed using mean age and mean BMI reported in each individual study as covariates, both in univariate and multivariate models. When means were available only for subgroups, the overall study mean was estimated using the method described by Arian et al. 27 28 All statistical analyses were conducted using R (version 4.5.1; R Core Team, 2025, 29 Sensitivity and subgroups analyses The main analysis included all eligible studies. A secondary analysis was restricted to studies enrolling asymptomatic controls without endometriosis, representative of the general population. For both the main and secondary analyses, the same set of sensitivity and subgroup analyses was applied. As sensitivity analyses, a leave-one-out meta-analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the pooled estimates. Furthermore, since age is a well-established confounder in epidemiological associations in women’s health, 30 Predefined subgroup analyses were also conducted to explore the potential influence of methodological and clinical confounders on the pooled estimates. Differences between subgroups were assessed using the Q test, with statistical significance defined as p < 0.05. Studies were categorized according to the following criteria: (1) study design: case-control, cohort, or cross-sectional; (2) data source: hospital records (clinical extracted from the medical records of one or a few hospitals, or limited multicenter studies), large-scale databases (data from national surveys, large prospective cohorts, population biobanks, or national clinical/administrative registries), or interviews (primary data collected via participant questionnaires or interviews, with clinical confirmation from hospital records or subsequent diagnoses); (3) geographic location: Asia, Asia Minor, Australia, Europe or North America; (4) parity distribution: studies were classified as mostly nulliparous if >50% of participants were nulliparous, or mostly multiparous if >50% of participants were multiparous; (5) age: studies were classified as mean age ≤35 years if the mean age of the population was ≤35 years or if >50% of participants were aged ≤ 35; or as mean age >35 years if the mean age was >35 years or if >50% of participants were over 35; and (6) study quality: good, fair, or poor (based on NOS score). Estimates of population parity were based on the reported prevalence of nulliparous and parous women in each study. In studies exclusively enrolling infertile women, or only women with at least one prior delivery, nulliparity and parity were assumed to be 100% and 0%, respectively. When only the median number of births was reported, a median of 0 was interpreted as indicating that ≥50% of participants were nulliparous, while a median ≥1 was interpreted as <50% nulliparous. For multiparity, a stepwise subgrouping strategy was applied: first, studies were classified as mostly multiparous if >50% of participants were multiparous; then, a more restrictive subgroup was defined as those with >95% multiparous participants, to allow for effect modification analysis and to improve internal validity through greater population homogeneity. The >95% threshold was used to reflect practical dominance of the exposure. Studies without parity data were excluded from parity-based analyses. For age, groups were based on the mean age reported or derived from study data. The cut-off of 35 years was chosen based on clinical rationale (given the increased prevalence of gynecological conditions such as fibroids after age 35 31 Role of funding source This study was funded by Italian Ministry of Health—Current research IRCCS.

Primary analysis: occurrence of uterine fibroids in endometriosis vs. controls Studies overview A total of 23 studies were included, encompassing 3,109,231women (118,716 with endometriosis and 2,990,515 controls). Twelve were cohort studies (3,095,312 women), 32 , 33 , 35 , 36 , 40 , 43 , 45 , 48 , 50 , 51 , 53 , 54 34 , 39 , 46 , 47 37 , 38 , 41 , 42 , 44 , 49 , 52 32 33 34 35 , 38 , 39 , 46 , 47 , 49 50 51 36 , 40 , 43 , 45 , 48 , 52 53 54 37 , 41 , 42 , 44 38 , 40 , 44 , 48 41 , 42 32 , 43 , 50 34 , 39 , 46 , 47 , 49 , 51 , 54 33 , 35 36 37 , 45 , 52 , 53 32 , 34 , 37 , 38 , 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 , 50 , 51 , 53 34 , 46 , 48 , 50 , 51 32 , 37 , 38 , 40 41 42 43 44 45 , 47 , 53 40 41 42 , 44 , 45 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 , 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 32 , 34 , 39 40 41 42 , 45 46 47 , 50 33 , 35 36 37 38 , 44 , 48 , 49 , 51 52 53 Main results and certainty of the evidence The pooled OR of uterine fibroids in women with endometriosis compared to those without was 2.91 (95% CI: 1.78–4.75; I 2 Fig. 2 Supplementary Table S2 Fig. 2 Forest plot of all included studies. Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of this association ( Supplementary Fig. S1 32 33 34 35 36 37 , 40 , 41 , 45 46 47 48 , 50 , 51 , 54 34 35 36 , 46 , 47 Supplementary Figs. S2–S4 Meta-regression analyses showed no significant effect of age on the association between endometriosis and fibroids in either the primary or sensitivity analyses. Conversely, BMI was consistently associated with effect estimates, both in univariate and multivariate models (coefficient at multivariate analysis = 0.33; 95% CI: 0.21–0.45; p < 0.01; Table 3 Subgroup analyses Subgroup analyses are summarized in Table 2 Supplementary Figs. S5–S17 Statistically significant differences between subgroups were observed for data source (p < 0.01) and study quality (p = 0.03). In particular, studies based on hospital records showed the lowest association between endometriosis and fibroids (OR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.69–1.51), whereas large-scale database studies reported substantially higher estimates (OR 6.26; 95% CI: 3.92–9.98), followed by interview-based studies (OR 9.85; 95% CI: 4.64–20.87). Regarding study quality, good-quality studies yielded the strongest association (OR 3.75; 95% CI: 1.96–7.16), followed by fair-quality studies (OR 1.89; 95% CI: 1.18–3.03) and poor-quality studies, which showed a lower and non-significant estimate (OR 1.19; 95% CI: 0.68–2.09). In contrast, no statistically significant differences were observed between subgroups defined by study design (p = 0.17) and geographic region (p = 0.08). Nevertheless, differences in effect sizes were noted across these categories. The association between endometriosis and fibroids was higher in cross-sectional studies (OR 3.79; 95% CI:1.28–11.19) and cohort studies (OR 3.12; 95% CI: 1.62–6.04), compared to case-control designs (OR 1.43; 95% CI: 0.73–2.81). Geographically, studies from Asia Minor showed the highest estimate (OR 10.06; 95% CI: 2.62–38.60), followed by Asia (OR 4.30; 95% CI: 1.06–17.48), North America (OR 3.74; 95% CI: 1.71–8.22), and Australia (OR 3.35; 95% CI: 0.96–11.66), while European studies reported the lowest estimate (OR 1.25; 95% CI: 0.56–2.80). A trend toward progressively stronger associations was observed with increasing prevalence of multiparity, although between-group differences did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09). Compared to studies with mostly nulliparous populations (OR 1.56; 95% CI: 0.53–4.59), the association was stronger in those where more than 50% of women were multiparous (OR 4.52; 95% CI: 2.53–8.10), and reached its highest value in studies where over 95% of participants were multiparous (OR 5.23; 95% CI: 2.09–13.04). Finally, stratification by age showed similar estimates in populations with a mean age ≤35 years (OR 2.68; 95% CI: 1.52–4.71) and >35 years (OR 2.58; 95% CI: 1.09–6.11; p = p = 0.94). Sensitivity analysis: occurrence of uterine fibroids in endometriosis vs. asymptomatic controls Studies overview A total of 12 studies compared women with endometriosis to asymptomatic controls, 36 , 37 , 40 41 42 43 44 45 , 48 , 52 53 54 Supplementary Table S3 Of the 12 included studies, seven were cohort studies (3,091,737women) 36 , 40 , 43 , 45 , 48 , 53 , 54 37 , 41 , 42 , 44 , 52 40 , 44 , 48 41 , 42 43 54 36 , 37 , 45 , 52 , 53 48 37 , 40 41 42 43 44 45 , 53 40 41 42 , 44 , 45 Main results and certainty of the evidence In the analysis restricted to studies comparing women with endometriosis to asymptomatic controls, the pooled odds ratio for the co-occurrence of uterine fibroids was markedly higher than in the primary analysis (OR 7.01; 95% CI: 4.72–10.41; I 2 Fig. 3 Supplementary Table S2 Fig. 3 Forest plot of studies included in the sensitivity analysis of asymptomatic controls. Leave-one-out sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of this association ( Supplementary Fig. S18 36 , 37 , 40 , 41 , 45 , 48 , 54 2 Supplementary Figs. S19 and S20 Subgroup analyses Subgroup analyses are summarized in Table 2 Supplementary Figs. S21–S33 Significant differences between subgroups were observed for geographic region (p < 0.01) and study quality (p < 0.01). The highest estimates were observed in studies from Asia Minor (OR 10.06; 95% CI: 2.62–38.60), Australia (OR 6.03; 95% CI: 2.98–12.2), and Asia (OR 7.56; 95% CI: 3.05–19.18). Good-quality studies showed the strongest association between endometriosis and fibroids (OR 7.72; 95% CI: 5.26–11.33) compared to fair-quality studies (OR 2.68; 95% CI: 2.52–2.86). Subgroup differences were not statistically significant for study design (p = 0.61), data source (p = 0.32), parity (p = 0.31), or age (p = 0.52). However, consistently elevated estimates were observed across all the subgroups, including both cohort and cross-sectional designs, different parity categories, and populations with younger and older mean ages, suggesting robustness of the association across diverse contexts. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence supporting an epidemiological association between endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Across a total population of 3,109,231 women (118,716 with endometriosis and 2,990,515 controls), the pooled OR for the presence of fibroids in women with endometriosis was 2.91 (95% CI: 1.78–4.75) This association remained robust in sensitivity analyses, including those restricted to studies with age-balanced groups or age-adjusted estimates. Meta-regression found no significant effect of age, while BMI showed a consistent positive association with effect size (p < 0.01). Subgroup analyses revealed significantly stronger associations in high-quality studies and a trend toward higher estimates in studies with increasing proportions of multiparous women. Although the trend did not reach statistical significance, the association was weakest in studies with mostly nulliparous women and progressively increased in those with >50% and >95% multiparous participants. A sensitivity analysis restricted to studies comparing women with endometriosis to asymptomatic controls showed a markedly stronger association (OR = 7.01; 95% CI: 4.72–10.41). This result was consistent across subgroup analyses and stronger in high-quality studies. In meta-regression analysis age significantly modified the association (p < 0.01). Despite the consistent direction of the association across analyses, statistical heterogeneity remained high, and the overall certainty of the evidence was rated as low, likely due to residual clinical and methodological variability across studies. As a result, while the observed association appears robust, its magnitude may not be fully generalizable across all populations and settings. The finding that uterine fibroids occur 3 to 10 times more frequently in women with endometriosis compared to controls is supported by epidemiological, biological, and clinical considerations. First, endometriosis and uterine fibroids share common pathogenic mechanisms, particularly involving hormonal influences. Hyperestrogenism plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, both in the establishment and maintenance of lesions. 9 11 55 56 57 58 59 , 60 Supportive evidence also comes from genetic studies. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on endometriosis have demonstrated significant genetic correlations between endometriosis and traits indicative of increased exposure to menstruation and hormones, such as excessive or irregular menstruation, shorter menstrual cycles, earlier menarche, and uterine fibroids. 61 62 Clinically, symptoms arising from uterine pathology overlap significantly between endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Our sensitivity analysis showed a stronger association when women with endometriosis were compared to asymptomatic controls from the general population undergoing routine check-ups. This likely reflects the impact of control group selection on the observed association. When controls are asymptomatic and at lower baseline risk for fibroids, the contrast with endometriosis cases is more pronounced, resulting in a stronger association. In contrast, studies using hospital-based controls often include women evaluated for symptoms such as infertility or heavy menstrual bleeding—conditions that are independently associated with fibroids, and in some cases, also with endometriosis. This clinical overlap may reduce the contrast between cases and controls, potentially attenuating the observed effect estimates. Notably, the prevalence of endometriosis in hospital-based studies was markedly elevated, averaging approximately 32%, which is not reflective of its actual prevalence in the general population. 1 This issue has both methodological and clinical implications. In general outpatient settings, fibroids are more likely to go undetected compared to specialist centers that manage endometriosis, where patients typically present with complex or severe symptoms requiring thorough diagnostic work-up. In such settings, recognizing the potential co-occurrence of fibroids and endometriosis is essential to ensure accurate evaluation and appropriate clinical management. Although fibroids are asymptomatic in some patients, approximately 30% of women experience significant symptoms, including severe pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, non-cyclic pelvic pain, infertility, abnormal uterine bleeding, heavy menstrual bleeding, fatigue, dyspareunia, and bladder or bowel dysfunction. 63 64 65 66 67 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis providing a quantitative estimate of the burden of uterine fibroids in women with endometriosis. A major strength of this study is the large sample size (over 3 million patients), enabling robust estimates of effect. Additionally, we performed a sensitivity analysis restricted to studies where controls without endometriosis were asymptomatic women representative of an outpatient setting. This methodological approach aimed to reduce misclassification bias (due to undiagnosed endometriosis in symptomatic controls) and to minimize potential outcome detection bias, as fibroids might be overdiagnosed in women undergoing evaluation or surgery for gynecological symptoms. Indeed, the retrospective design and specific characteristics of healthcare systems in many studies included in our meta-analysis may introduce selection bias, especially considering that most of these studies were conducted in referral centres predominantly visited by patients experiencing uterine diseases and pelvic pain. 68 However, several limitations must be considered. First, significant heterogeneity was observed across studies (I 2 69 Endometriosis and uterine fibroids are among the most prevalent gynecological disorders, both of which can significantly impact women’s quality of life and reproductive health. This meta-analysis suggests a co-occurrence between endometriosis and uterine fibroids, possibly reflecting shared pathophysiological mechanisms, particularly those related to estrogen signaling. Given the significant overlap of core symptoms, such as pelvic pain and infertility, recognizing and addressing the presence of fibroids in women with endometriosis is essential. Treating one condition without identifying the other may result in inadequate symptom relief, persisting infertility, or the need for additional medical or surgical interventions. 69 Although malignant transformation is rare for both conditions, they have been linked to increased mortality risk from gynecological cancers, potentially mediated by shared risk factors such as infertility and nulliparity. 70 , 71 72 While further research is necessary to fully elucidate the biological foundations underlying the coexistence of endometriosis and uterine fibroids, clinical awareness of this association is critical for optimizing patient management and improving both short- and long-term health outcomes.
