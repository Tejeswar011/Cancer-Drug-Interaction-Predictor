Diagnosis is often delayed due to nonspecific symptoms, contributing to challenges in treatment and management. We present a case of a 75-year-old female with epistaxis and nasal blockage, ultimately diagnosed with amelanotic sinonasal melanoma. Despite diagnostic difficulties exacerbated by profuse bleeding during biopsy attempts, a comprehensive approach involving clinical evaluation, imaging, and histopathology led to a definitive diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry played a crucial role in confirming the diagnosis, ruling out differential diagnoses such as olfactory neuroblastoma and lymphoma. Surgical excision, despite intraoperative bleeding, was successful, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to the tumor’s advanced stage. The case underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and personalized treatment strategies, considering the tumor’s molecular characteristics for improved outcomes in managing this rare malignancy.
