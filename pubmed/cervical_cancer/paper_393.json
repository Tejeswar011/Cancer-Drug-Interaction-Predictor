We aimed to explore potential risk factors for the delay in seeking medical care among breast cancer patients by constructing a highly effective machine learning (ML) prediction model. Methods A cross-sectional methodology was utilized, and the demographic and clinical characteristics of 540 patients with breast cancer in Sichuan Cancer Hospital from July 2022 to June 2023 were collected to develop a model. Feature selection was performed using a Lasso algorithm, and six ML algorithms, including XGB, LR, RF, CNB, SVM and KNN, were applied for model construction. The k-fold cross-validation method was used for internal verification. And ROC curves, calibration curves, DCA and external validation were used for model evaluation. The SHAP method was used to interpret the model visualization. Results A comprehensive analysis was conducted in a cohort of 540 patients diagnosed with breast cancer, of whom 212 patients (39.26%) experienced a delay. The Lasso algorithm selected eight variables that were most suitable for model construction. The RF model demonstrated superior performance compared to the other five prediction models. The AUC values in the training set ROC, validation set ROC, and external verification ROC curves were 1.00, 0.86, and 0.76, respectively in RF model. The results of the calibration curves indicated that the calibration curves of the RF models closely resembled the ideal curves. The DCA curves exhibited a net clinical benefit in comparison to treatment for or treatment for none for all models, with the exception of CNB. Conclusions The machine learning algorithm utilized in this study effectively generated a prediction model for delays in seeking medical care for patients with breast cancer. The best RF model’s remarkable predictive power, exhibiting a good discrimination and calibration.

However, breast cancer treatment is characterized by lengthy cycles, high medical expenses, and adverse effects, including the psychological impact of surgery on women’s body image and the side effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy [ 2 3 Patta M et al. [ 4 5 6 Recently, some researchers have adopted traditional logistic regression to construct a prediction model for delays in seeking medical care of breast cancer. Emerging machine learning (ML) approaches have demonstrated superior predictive performance through enhanced accuracy and robust modeling capabilities [ 7 9 5 10 Therefore, this study systematically investigated the influencing factors of delay in seeking medical care among breast cancer patients from the aspects of sociodemographic, environmental, and clinical variables. and developed a predictive machine learning model that incorporated the independent effects and interactions of these factors to assess the risk of delayed medical consultations for breast cancer patients in the Chinese population. This model can be utilized by individual physicians and patients to evaluate the risk and make targeted decisions regarding delayed breast cancer screening. Simultaneously, health care systems can employ this model to identify high-risk patients, enabling the implementation of additional interventions at the population level. Materials and methods Study design A cross-sectional methodology was utilized in this study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Sichuan Cancer Hospital (approval number: SCCHEC-02-2022-086). All participants signed informed consent forms and were asked to complete the structured questionnaires independently after giving their consent. Patients A total of 540 patients with breast cancer in Sichuan Cancer Hospital in China from July 2022 to June 2023 were recruited for model construction. Additionally, 150 breast cancer patients from the same hospital during a different time period (July to August 2023) were selected as the study subjects for external validation of the model. The inclusion criteria included (a) aged over 18 years; (b) having pathologically diagnosed breast cancer; (c) having normal linguistic and comprehension abilities; and (d) consenting to participate in this study. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) a history of mental illness or cognitive disorders; (b) other comorbid cancers; and (c) relapsed breast cancer. Data collection We collected 35 independent variables, encompassing sociodemographic, environmental and clinical factors. Sociodemographic characteristics We designed a sociodemographic characteristics questionnaire based on a literature review to collect the participants’ sociodemographic information, including age, alcohol consumption, smoking status, ethnicity, religion, marital status, employment, family history of any cancer, family history of breast cancer, number of family members, hospital choice, hospital that confirmed breast cancer, place of residence, education level, monthly income (RMB), distance from the hospital, household situation, channels for acquiring health knowledge, preferred solution for breast discomfort, barriers and reasons for delaying seeking medical care, health care worker status, physical examination status, understanding of breast diseases, comorbidities, and medical payment method. Clinical characteristics Additionally, we designed a clinical characteristics questionnaire reflecting medical treatment-seeking behavior, including clinical stage, first detected symptoms, method of symptom discovery, when the symptoms were first discovered, and when the patient sought medical treatment for the first time. Anxiety Anxiety was evaluated using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GADS-7), which consisted of 7 items [ 11 Depression Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9), which consisted of 9 items [ 12 Family support Family support was evaluated using the Family Support Scale (FSS), which consisted of 15 items [ 13 Medical coping mode The medical coping mode was assessed using the Medical Coping Mode Questionnaire (MCMQ), which consisted of 20 items across three dimensions: confrontation, avoidance, and acceptance resignation [ 14 Health hardiness The RHHI-24 was developed based on the Health-Related Hardiness Scale (HRHS), and consisted of 24 items and four dimensions, including health values(reflect the study subjects’ level of concern regarding their health status), internal health locus of control, external health locus of control, and perceived health competence [ 15 Outcome The primary outcome variable was delay in seeking medical care, which was defined as a delay in diagnosis (referred to as patient delay) if the duration between the patient’s initial observation of suspicious symptoms and their first visit to a medical institution exceeds 3 months [ 3 Statistic analysis Establishment of predictive models In the present study, all statistical analyses were carried out using R version 3.6 and Python version 3.7. Continuous variables were described as means [standard deviations (SDs)] or medians [25th, 75th percentiles], while categorical variables were expressed as numbers (percentages). T tests, Mann‒Whitney U tests, and Chi-square tests were used to identify variables displaying significant differences between the non-delayed group and the delayed group. Additionally, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis was conducted for dimension reduction to identify the most appropriate predictors for building the machine learning model [ 16 Evaluation of predictive models The six models were evaluated based on three aspects: discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness, with the best model selected for predictive analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to obtain the area under the curve (AUC) value, which reflects the model’s predictive efficiency [ 17 16 18 Model interpretation The shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method was used to interpret the model visualization to measure the importance of eigenvalues, ranking the importance of each predictor according to its corresponding SHAP value [ 19 Results Patient characteristics The comparison of the demographic and clinical characteristics observed in the training set and the verification set was provided in supplementary 1. Predictors variables selection based on Lasso We employed the Lasso algorithm to identify features relevant for classifying the 12 variables that exhibited significant differences (Table 1 1 Table 1

The training set was used to create and train the machine learning models. After adjusting for parameters and comparing algorithms, the extreme gradient boosting (XGB), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), CNB, support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) models were established, and the average AUC values were greater than 0.80(Table 2 2 3 4 5 6 Table 2 Evaluation of the six model Model Training Validation AUC ACC SN SP AUC ACC SN SP XGBoost 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 0.85 0.82 0.82 0.84 KNN 0.92 0.82 0.84 0.85 0.82 0.77 0.75 0.81 RF 1.00 0.99 1.00 0.99 0.87 0.79 0.77 0.86 LR 0.83 0.78 0.82 0.77 0.82 0.77 0.82 0.78 SVM 0.84 0.82 0.71 0.89 0.83 0.81 0.76 0.87 CNB 0.80 0.79 0.71 0.85 0.80 0.79 0.75 0.85 RF XGBoost LR SVM CNB KNN AUC ACC SN SP  Fig. 2 ROC curves for the training set of the six models Fig. 3 ROC curves for the validation set of the six models Fig. 4 Calibration plots of the six models Fig. 5 DCA curves of the six models Fig. 6 A B C D Model external validation The ROC curve analysis yielded An AUC value of 0.76 for the external validation set, suggesting a strong alignment between the predicted and actual probabilities. Furthermore, the extrapolative nature of the predictive model was evident (Fig. 6 Model explanation The SHAP summary plot of feature importance results demonstrated the hierarchical ranking of the eight risk factors associated with delays in seeking medical attention in terms of their influence as distance from the hospital, physical examination status, hospital choice, health value, monthly income (RMB), education level, religion, and medical payment method (Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Bar plot of the feature importance. ( A B Discussion In this study, we developed and evaluated six machine learning predictive models (RF, LR, XGB, KNN, SVM, and CNB) for delays in seeking medical care among breast cancer patients. Among these models, the RF model demonstrated the highest prediction performance, with an effective AUC value (Table 2 20 This study demonstrated that the prevalence of patient delay was 39.3%, which was similar to those reported in previous studies [ 8 The Fig. 7 21 22 23 24 Our study found that physical examination status was the second most significant predictor of delays in seeking medical care among patients with breast cancer. In this study, 34.81%(188/540) of the patients had not undergone Any physical examination, and among those who had never undergone a physical examination, 55.85%(105/188) experienced delays in seeking medical care. A study noted that in the physical examination of malignant tumors in healthy people [ 25 Educational level and health values were also indicators affecting medical-seeking behavior. Other studies have indicated that education level is also associated with delayed presentation, which reported findings similar to our study [ 2 24 26 The preferred solution for breast discomfort was also correlated with patient delay in this study, which is consistent with the findings of Ren et al. [ 27 The medical payment method was an important predicted indicator affecting seeking medical care in our study. The lack of health insurance and limited access to medical services contribute to patients’ delay in seeking necessary medical attention. Rauscher et al. [ 21 22 Our study identified that religion Religious belief serves as a potential contributing factor to patient delay in seeking medical care. In this study, the proportion of breast cancer patients with religious beliefs experiencing delays in seeking medical care was as high as 81.25%, which was closely related to the research setting of this study. This study was conducted in a tertiary first-class oncology specialized hospital in Sichuan, which treated a majority of cancer patients from the Sichuan region. Sichuan had a very unique geographical location, and the majority of the population with religious beliefs was Tibetan. Tibetans mostly resided in remote plateau areas where medical resources were limited, and the overall educational level among the Tibetan people tended to be relatively low. Ma et al. [ 28 Limitations Although the model developed in this study demonstrated excellent discrimination ability, calibration, and clinical effectiveness, there are several limitations. First, the data was derived from self-reports obtained through questionnaires, which may have introduced bias. Second, this study included data from only a single center, and the sample size was small, which may have led to distribution bias and may not be ideal for validating datasets in model development. Therefore, it is essential to obtain multicenter clinical data to provide more reliable theoretical guidance for clinical practice. Additionally, it is necessary to update the prediction model and enhance its performance. Conclusions The machine learning algorithm utilized in this study effectively generated a prediction model for delays in seeking medical care for patients with breast cancer.
