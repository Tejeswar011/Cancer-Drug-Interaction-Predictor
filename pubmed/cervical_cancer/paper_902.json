Mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy) and ferroptosis have emerged as promising avenues in cancer research. This study aimed to identify mitophagy- and ferroptosis-related genes (MiFeRGs) in LUAD and develop a prognostic risk model based on these genes. Methods Integration of transcriptomic data from the TCGA dataset with MiFeRG databases was performed. Subsequently, differentially expressed MiFeRGs were identified. A prognostic risk model was developed using univariate, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Survival analysis, immune infiltration assessment, and GSEA analysis were conducted to evaluate the prognostic value and potential mechanisms of MiFeRGs in LUAD. Expression levels and functions of prognostic MiFeRGs were further validated in cells. Results A total of 136 differentially expressed MiFeRGs were identified, with enrichment in signaling pathways associated with cancer progression. Seven MiFeRGs (ARPC1A, AURKA, BRD2, HNRNPL, METTL3, NR4A1, and TRPM2) were selected for the prognostic risk model. The model showed wide applicability across various clinical parameters. Furthermore, the PPI network revealed potential associations between MiFeRGs and TCR-related genes, with hub MiFeRG AURKA and TCR-related gene AKT1 having the highest degree values. The levels of AURKA were upregulated in the LUAD cell line and tumor tissues. Moreover, AURKA was associated with mTORC1 activation. Conclusion The identified MiFeRGs and the developed prognostic risk model provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying LUAD progression and offer potential prognostic and therapeutic implications for clinical management.

Increasing research suggests it as a potential approach for cancer treatment [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 In this study, we developed a prognostic model based on mitophagy- and ferroptosis-related genes (MiFeRGs) using public datasets. By analyzing gene expression data from large patient cohorts in the TCGA database, we sought to identify gene signatures associated with prognosis and evaluate their predictive value in stratifying patients into high- and low-risk groups. This study aimed to identify novel targets for improving prognostic accuracy and facilitating personalized treatment approaches for LUAD patients. Methods Data download and preprocessing RNA sequencing data and clinical data of patients with LUAD were downloaded from the TCGA database ( https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov https://www.genecards.org http://www.zhounan.org/ferrdb/current Identification of differentially expressed MiFeRGs Firstly, using the Limma package in R, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the normal and tumor samples were identified, with p https://jvenn.toulouse.inra.fr/app/example.html Development and evaluation of prognostic risk model To identify prognosis-related MiFeRGs from the initially identified MiFeRGs, a stepwise selection strategy was employed. First, univariate Cox regression analysis was performed using SPSS to evaluate the association between each gene’s expression and overall survival (OS) in TCGA-LUAD cohort. Genes with p To evaluate the predictive performance, LUAD patients in the TCGA database were categorized into low-risk or high-risk groups based on the optimal truncation value of risk scores. The risk score of each patient was calculated as “Risk score = EXP RNA1 RNA1 RNA2 RNA2 RNAi RNAi RNAi RNAi Functional enrichment analysis Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed to explore the biological functions of MiFeRGs using R packages clusterProfiler and org.Hs.eg.db. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) analysis was performed through R packages GSEABase and GSVA to compare different KEGG pathways between two different risk groups. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to screen hub prognostic MiFeRG-related pathways using the GSVA package. h.all.v2023.2.Hs.symbols served as a reference gene set, and the results were visualized using ggplot2. TME analysis Immune cell infiltration was analyzed using the CIBERSORT algorithm of the IBOR package in R. To assess the T cell exhaustion, T cell receptor (TCR)-related genes were searched from the ImmPort ( https://www.dev.immport.org/home Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network The interactions among TCR-related genes and their interactions with the hub prognostic MiFeRGs were visualized through the PPI networks. The STRING database ( http://stringdb.org Cell culture Human lung normal epithelial cell line BEAS-2B (#CELL-C0496, Daucell Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China) and human LUAD cell lines A549 (#CL-0016, Pricella Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China), H1975 (#CL-0298, Pricella), and NCI-H2009 (#CL-0762, Pricella) were cultured in RPMI medium 1640, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and quantified with the NanoDrop 8000 spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher, CA, USA). cDNA synthesis was performed using the FastKing gDNA Dispelling RT SuperMix (TIANGEN, Beijing, China). For qRT-PCR analysis, a CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) was employed with gene-specific primers, while GAPDH served as the reference gene. The qRT-PCR reaction utilized One-Step SYBR Green Master Mix (ThermoFisher) under cycling conditions of 30 s at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 3 s at 95°C and 20 s at 60°C.

Cell transfections were performed using Lipofectamine™ 3000 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The transfection efficiency was assessed by qRT-PCR and Western blot 48 h post-transfection. Western blotting Total cellular proteins were extracted using RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit. Equal amounts of protein (20 µg) were separated via SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes (Beyotime). After blocking with 5% non-fat milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies against the ARPC1A (1:1500, #17538-1-AP, Proteintech, Wuhan, China), AURKA (1:1000, #EM1706-71, Huabio, Hangzhou, China), BRD2 (1:1000, #ET7109-07, Huabio), HNRNPL (1:1000, # HA500115 HA500437 Colony formation assay Transfected cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 500 cells per well and cultured for 14 days. Colonies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Colonies were counted under a light microscope. Wound healing assay Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and grown to nearly 90% confluence. A linear scratch was created using a sterile 200-µL pipette tip. Cells were washed with PBS to remove debris and cultured in serum-free medium. Images were captured at 0 and 24 h post-scratch using a microscope. Transwell invasion assay Cell invasive ability was assessed using Transwell chambers with 8-µm pore size inserts pre-coated with Matrigel. Briefly, 5 × 10⁴ transfected cells suspended in 200 µL serum-free medium were seeded into the upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with 600 µL RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. After incubation at 37°C for 24 h, non-invading cells on the upper surface of the membrane were gently removed. Cells that had invaded through the Matrigel to the lower surface were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 0.1% crystal violet, and counted under a light microscope. Statistical analysis R software version 4.0.3, SPSS Statistics, and GraphPad Prism version 8.0.2 (GraphPad, CA, USA) were applied for statistical analyses. Student t-test was used to compare the differences between the two groups, and an ANOVA test was applied to compare differences among at least three groups. The survival rate of different MiFeRG expression groups was compared by K-M curves with the log-rank test. The Pearson method was used for correlation analysis. Statistical significance was set as p Results Identification and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed MiFeRGs in LUAD The distribution of disease and normal samples from TCGA-LUAD was shown in Fig. 1 1 1  Fig. 1 Identification of differentially expressed MiFeRGs in lung cancer. A B C Moreover, the functions of 136 MiFeRGs were analyzed. In biological progress (BP) terms, these genes were mainly enriched in response to chemical, response to stress, and cellular protein metabolic process (Fig. 2 2 2 2  Fig. 2 Functional enrichment analysis of MiFeRGs. A-C A B C D Establishment and evaluation of a seven-MiFeRG prognostic risk model To screen genes associated with the survival of patients with LUAD, univariate Cox regression analysis was performed on 136 MiFeRGs. As shown in Figs. 3 p p 3  Fig. 3 Establishment and evaluation of prognostic risk model. A B C D E To further evaluate the predictive performance of this model, patients were categorized into low-risk or high-risk groups based on the optimal truncation value. Overall survival in the low-risk group was significantly higher than that in the high-risk group ( p 3 3 Furthermore, the relevance of risk score with clinical parameters was analyzed, such as age, gender, TNM stages, and pathological stage. No significant difference was observed in these characteristics ( p 4  Fig. 4 Relevance of risk score with clinical parameters. A-F A B C D E F Clinical value of seven prognostic MiFeRGs in LUAD Subsequently, to further explore the association of seven MiFeRGs’ expression with survival rate, survival analysis was performed. Except for NR4A1, the other six genes were all upregulated in the high-risk group ( p 5 5  Fig. 5 Survival analysis of seven prognostic MiFeRGs in lung cancer. A B-H B C D E F G H Moreover, GSEA analysis was used to acquire the pathways related to the seven prognostic MiFeRGs. The enriched pathways included PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, mTORC1 signaling, IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling, inflammatory response, interferon α response, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and TGF β signaling (Fig. 6  Fig. 6 Prognostic MiFeRG-related pathways. A-G A B C D E F G TME analysis TME plays an important role in multiple interactions between tumor cells and the immune system. To find out the role of TME in different risk groups, we analyzed the KEGG pathways based on the transcriptome data of LUAD individuals in the TCGA database using GSVA. As shown in Fig. 7 7  Fig. 7 GSVA and immune cell infiltration analysis. A B Due to the significant reduction of memory T cells, we speculated that T cell exhaustion might occur due to prolonged inflammation. Therefore, TCR-related gene expression levels were further explored between two risk groups. Figure 8 8 p 8  Fig. 8 Exploration of T cell exhaustion. A B C Expressional and functional validation of seven hub prognostic MiFeRGs in LUAD cells To validate the above analytical findings, we further conducted cell-based experiments. First, we compared the expression levels of seven key MiFeRGs between normal human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and three LUAD cell lines (A549, H1975, and NCI-H2009). As shown in Fig. 9 p  Fig. 9 Expression levels of seven hub prognostic genes in LUAD cells. A B p p To further investigate the functional roles of these hub genes in LUAD progression, we manipulated their expression levels for functional validation. In A549 cells, AURKA, BRD2, and TRPM2 were knocked down, while NR4A1 was overexpressed, with satisfactory transfection efficiency (Figure S1A-D). Considering that ARPC1A, HNRNPL, and METTL3 were highly expressed in LUAD but associated with favorable prognosis, we performed bidirectional validation by silencing these genes in A549 cells and overexpressing them in H1975 cells, with efficient transfection confirmed (Figure S2A-F). Functional assays demonstrated that knockdown of AURKA, BRD2, and TRPM2 or overexpression of NR4A1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of A549 cells ( p 10 p 11  Fig. 10 Effects of AURKA, BRD2, TRPM2, and NR4A1 on proliferation, migration, and invasion in LUAD cells. A B C D E F p  Fig. 11 Effects of ARPC1A, HNRNPL, and METTL3 on proliferation, migration, and invasion in LUAD cells. A-B A B C-D C D E-F E F Discussion In this study, we identified and analyzed differentially expressed MiFeRGs in LUAD using data from the TCGA database. A prognostic risk model was established based on seven selected MiFeRGs (ARPC1A, AURKA, BRD2, HNRNPL, METTL3, NR4A1, and TRPM2) and evaluated its predictive performance. Additionally, we explored the prognostic significance of these genes and their association with immune cell infiltration and T-cell exhaustion to provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and personalized treatment strategies for LUAD patients. Cancer cells require more iron than normal cells, and imbalances in iron metabolism can increase the risk of cancer and promote tumor growth [ 19 20 17 21 22 23 24 25 26 The seven hub prognostic genes identified in our study (AURKA, BRD2, TRPM2, NR4A1, ARPC1A, HNRNPL, and METTL3) are closely associated with the occurrence and progression of LUAD. Increased AURKA expression has been linked to poor prognosis in various cancers [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 GSVA analysis further explored the potential pathways associated with these hub genes and found significant enrichment of the immune-inflammatory pathway IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling. The JAK-STAT3 pathway mediates anti-apoptotic and angiogenesis functions in the TME and is associated with immunosuppressive functions [ 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 T cell exhaustion is an immune dysregulation phenomenon observed in cancer and is considered a resistant pathway to cellular immunotherapy [ 51 52 53 54 55 56 There are several limitations in this study. First, although we performed comprehensive bioinformatics analyses and partial experimental validation, the specific molecular mechanisms require further in vitro and in vivo investigations. Second, while the prognostic risk model demonstrated robust predictive performance across multiple clinical subgroups, its generalizability and applicability need to be validated in larger independent cohorts to confirm its clinical utility. Conclusion In summary, this analysis elucidates the significance of MiFeRGs in LUAD progression and prognosis. The developed prognostic risk model, based on 7 MiFeRGs, demonstrates promise predictive performance. Furthermore, insights into immune infiltration, TCR-related genes, and pathway analysis shed light on the intricate interplay between tumor microenvironment and therapeutic responses. These findings contribute to our understanding of LUAD pathogenesis and offer potential therapeutic targets for precision medicine approaches. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.
