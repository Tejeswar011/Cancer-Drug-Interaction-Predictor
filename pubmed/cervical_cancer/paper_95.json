Summary Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is characterized by the development of fluid-filled kidney cysts and relentless progression to renal failure. Current treatments have adverse effects and limited efficacy, enhancing the need for improved therapeutics. Here, we provide a proof of concept for the use of dimeric immunoglobulin A (IgA) (dIgA) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to target epithelial-enclosed cysts, by exploiting their ability to transcytose via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor highly expressed on renal cyst-lining cells. We engineered an antagonistic dIgA mAb against the cell mesenchymal-epithelial transition (cMET) receptor, a driver of cyst progression, and demonstrated its specific binding and inhibition of cMET in vitro In vivo Graphical abstract Highlights • Dimeric IgA accumulated specifically in renal cysts at therapeutic concentrations • cMET-dIgA treatment slowed cyst growth and improved kidney function in PKD mice • Potent dIgA targeting identified cMET as a key pro-survival factor in PKD cysts • dIgA offers a versatile platform to repurpose validated mAbs for mucosal diseases Current PKD therapies are limited by poor efficacy and off-target toxicity. Schimmel et al. show that recombinant dimeric IgAs can reach kidney cyst lumens and engage molecular targets to slow disease progression. This approach minimizes side effects and enables repurposing of validated IgG sequences for efficient delivery across epithelial barriers.

The purpose of dIgA in nature is to cross epithelial barriers for excretion into external secretions as a first line of defense against pathogens. 9 5 , 9 , 10 11 8 2 , 8 , 12 13 14 pIgR can only transcytose dIgA unidirectionally into cyst lumens. 9 15 , 16 17 , 18 8 In this study we investigate whether the progression of PKD can be affected by utilizing an antagonistic dIgA mAb against a luminal target protein. As the target, we chose the cell mesenchymal-epithelial transition (cMET) protein, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) which has previously been implicated as a possible driver of cyst progression in PKD mouse models. 19 , 20 19 , 20 21 1 20 We used the IgG variable domain of a previously described human/mouse-cross-reactive, inhibitory cMET antibody 22 in vitro In vivo Results Engineering, expression, and purification of stable dIgA recombinant antibodies To produce the recombinant dIgA molecule used in this study, antigen-binding variable chain region sequences from a previously described function-blocking cMET IgG antibody 22 1 Figures 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 in vivo Figures 1 Figure 1 Recombinant engineering and high-yield production of human dimeric IgA1 monoclonal antibodies (A and B) Recombinant cloning utilized (A) amino acid sequences of the human IgA1 antigen-binding (Fab) domains shown in light red (heavy chain) or purple (light chain), in frame with the IgA1 constant domain sequences shown in dark red or purple to produce (B) recombinant human dimeric IgA mAbs. (C) Various molar ratios of heavy (H), light (L), and joining (J) chain were transiently transfected in 293F cells. Cell pellets were lysed in SDS and run on a reducing immunoblot to confirm individual chain molecular weights. Cell supernatants were run on a nonreducing immunblot to visualize dimer formation.

Transcytosis assays were performed in transwell systems using the renal epithelial Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line, which stably expresses pIgR, to determine if the recombinant dIgA molecule can be properly trafficked across an epithelial barrier. When the cMET-dIgA was applied to the basolateral side of these polarized cells, it was transported to the apical (luminal) compartment. After 24 h, significant accumulation of the antibody was observed in the apical chamber ( Figure 2 Figure 2 25 2+ Figure 2 cMET-dIgA renal cyst targeting in an adult PKD rat model We previously characterized pIgR expression and dIgA renal targeting in juvenile and adult PKD mouse models. 8 Cy/+ 26 , 27 , 28 Figure 3 8 , 14 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 cMET-dIgA traffics to PKD Han rat cysts and downregulates cMET signaling in cyst-lining cells (A and B) Untreated PKD Han:SPRD adult male rats upregulate pIgR expression compared to WT as seen in (A) immunoblot of whole kidney lysates, n n (C) Immunoprecipitation of CF using nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-nickel (Ni) ion resin followed by immunoblot specific for human IgA1 revealed secretory IgA (sIgA) recovery.

Discussion We have developed a strategy to combine the exquisite molecular target specificity of mAbs with a method to deliver mAbs specifically to renal cysts in PKD. 5 , 8 The limited use of IgA mAbs to date has focused mainly on the heightened ability of IgA antibodies, compared to IgGs, to bind FcαRI in humans and to activate an immune response via opsonization of cancer cells or pathogens. 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 15 , 41 35 16 , 42 38 , 39 , 43 44 45 15 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 15 , 51 While concurrent production and testing of our anti-cMET mAb in IgG format was not practical at this early stage in drug development, a direct head-to-head comparison of each isotype’s ability to inhibit disease progression while minimizing extra-renal side effects would be of interest in future research. Our lab previously reported that parentally administered IgG was unable to target to CF in multiple mouse models of PKD. 8 52 53 53 , 54 52 , 55 56 48 The intracellular regulation of cMET has been surprisingly under-studied in PKD even though its intricate role is well characterized in cancer metastasis. 57 , 58 59 60 , 61 31 , 62 31 , 63 63 , 64 , 65 5 , 32 , 66 One limitation in employing a model such as the Bpk line for this study is the potential variation in renal pIgR expression, as well as dIgA target protein expression, throughout early mouse development and among different tubule types. It is possible that the effect of cMET-dIgA was dampened in these juvenile mice as protein expression levels vary and cyst size changes rapidly during the 1-week treatment window. Variability was also seen in the progression of disease severity in the early-onset tamoxifen-inducible Pkd1 model, potentially affecting efficacy studies as well. Nevertheless, the conclusions from this study were strengthened by the validation of the technique in multiple PKD models. Pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in the Sprague-Dawley Han rat model proved beneficial to investigate dIgA renal trafficking at a stage of cystogenesis where cyst growth has essentially plateaued. This time point minimized confounding parameters that occur in earlier development and cystogenesis. Conversely, the rapid-onset Bpk model allowed for short-term efficacy studies that spanned multiple stages of PKD. Results from the tamoxifen-inducible Pkd1 mouse studies support those from the Bpk studies but demonstrate therapeutic potential in a model orthologous to human PKD. Until now, the investigation of PKD therapeutics has focused on SM inhibitors against numerous kinases, G protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, and transcription factors. 5 , 66 67 , 68 Important pharmacokinetic aspects of dIgA-based therapy, such as minimum required dosing frequency and concentration, must still be optimized following this study. Because our cMET-dIgA successfully accumulated in renal CF over multiple days, it is likely that less frequent dosing will be sufficient than the regimen tested here. Infrequent dosing would be extremely beneficial for a human PKD therapeutic considering patients may need to continue treatment over decades. Based on this study, testing of dIgA mAbs in larger preclinical studies as well as future clinical studies is justified in order to define these parameters further. Bispecific dIgA antibodies may also be explored as an opportunity to expand this mechanism by taking advantage of the four separate antigen-binding domains on dIgA that could be utilized to simultaneously target a wide range of proteins. In conclusion, the data shown here illustrate preclinical proof of therapeutic efficacy for specifically targeting cyst-luminal proteins with recombinant dIgA mAbs. The findings may facilitate further investigations into the development antibody-based therapeutics for PKD and potentially other indications that involve epithelial-enclosed compartments. Limitations of the study  • Tubule-specific pIgR expression across kidney segments or disease stages may influence delivery to cyst lumen and may cause treatment to be more or less effective in certain cyst populations. • The volume of CF obtained varied widely between individual mice due to technical limitations inherent to current collection methods. The variability in body weight between litters at the developmental stages used in this study also impacted CF recovery volumes. This limited the ability to precisely extrapolate long-term dosing requirements.

Fractions containing pure dIgA were pooled together and dialyzed into PBS, pH 7.4. In vitro Specific target binding of the cMET-dIgA was verified in CHO cells grown on poly L-lysine-coated coverslips, transiently transfected with one of the following plasmids: pT3-EF1aH human cMET 70 71 Transcytosis assays The ability of the cMET-dIgA to cross epithelial barriers was measured using transcytosis assay protocols adapted from previous literature. 69 , 72 , 73 69 In vivo cMET-dIgA was prepared in PBS, pH 7.4 and sterile filtered with a 0.22μm syringe filter. The vehicle (PBS, pH 7.4) was prepared and injected in the same manner as the mAb. For all studies, approximately equal numbers of animals from each litter were treated via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection with PBS vehicle and dIgA, allowing for analysis of reliable litter-mate controls. Single injection studies 10 week old Han rats were i.p. injected with 1mg cMET-dIgA or vehicle and euthanized 24 h post-injection. Bpk mice were i.p. injected with 20mg/kg cMET-dIgA or vehicle and analyzed at varied lengths of time post-injection; all were euthanized no later than postnatal day 14. (For example, a pup that was analyzed “3 days post-injection” would have received a single cMET-dIgA injection on postnatal day 11.)

BUN was analyzed with 5 μL serum per mouse using the QuantiChrom Urea Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, cat# DIUR-100). Purified creatinine and urea were used as standards in each assays and their optical densities were read at 492nm and 520nm, respectively. Quantification and statistical analysis Statistics Researchers performing quantification were blinded and provided animal ID numbers without knowledge of specific treatments. Statistical analyses were performed using Mann-Whitney unpaired one-tailed t-test using Prism9 (GraphPad) software. A p Histology quantification Cystic area Full kidney sections were created from 40× stitched images, and cysts were counted using the analyze particle feature in FIJI (ImageJ). Images were modified with the threshold function, and the total white space was counted and divided by the total kidney area to determine the cystic area. Manual determination of inclusive areas was used to exclude artifacts from tissue sectioning. Fibrosis Sirius red-stained sections were imaged at 20× magnification for quantification. Ten images from cortical regions were taken from each kidney. Using Photoshop (Adobe), a grid was placed over each image, and intersections with Sirius red stain were counted as positive, with intersections overlaid on negative space or outside of tissue excluded from the total number of potential intersections. Immunofluorescent staining Stained sections were imaged at 20–40× magnification for quantification. Ten images from cortical regions (unless otherwise specified) were taken from each kidney. Cell number was determined with DAPI positive images using FIJI (ImageJ) to automate cell counting. Signal-positive cells were quantified either through an automated Cell Profiler pipeline, or manually counted and classified by location as interstitial (existing outside of tubules and cysts), tubular (existing in cyst-lining cells or healthy epithelial cells), or luminal (inside cyst lumen). The number of positive cells from all ten images was divided by the total number of cells counted to obtain the percentage of signal-positive cells. References 1 Bergmann C. Guay-Woodford L.M.
