Technology-based tools provide innovative, resource-efficient alternatives to traditional approaches, delivering PA interventions. Objective This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a smartphone app (WExercise) in promoting PA among cancer survivors. Methods This study was an assessor-blind, 2-arm randomized controlled trial. The intervention group used WExercise, which consisted of automated weekly lessons developed based on the multi-process action control (M-PAC) framework. The control group received written PA recommendations. Ninety-eight physically inactive cancer survivors who had completed curative treatment were recruited from an oncology clinic and the community. Outcomes included exercise behavior (primary), exercise capacity, quality of life, and M-PAC constructs. Results The majority (81/98, 82.7%) of participants remained in the study. The proportion of participants completing at least 75% of lessons was 69.44%. For exercise behavior, mixed findings were identified: the intervention group had a significantly greater increase in self-reported moderate-to-vigorous PA compared to the control group at postintervention (mean difference in change 89.02 minutes, 95% CI 34.87-143.16) and 3 months postintervention (mean difference in change 49.37 minutes, 95% CI 8.63-90.10; group × time interaction; P P Conclusion WExercise demonstrated a significant effect on increasing self-reported PA, but this was not corroborated with ActiGraph-measured PA. The application may be a useful addition for clinicians aiming to promote physical activity in people with cancer.

Physical activity (PA) has emerged as a safe and recommended intervention to address these challenges [ 1 1 2 1 3 4 To promote PA among cancer survivors, technology-based interventions offer novel alternatives to traditional approaches, with benefits such as scalability and resource-efficient implementation. The technology-based PA promotion interventions examined in cancer survivors were categorized as mobile-based interventions (eg, wearable devices and mobile phone apps), web-based interventions (eg, self-monitoring platforms and workshops), and those involving a combination of both mobile-based and web-based interventions [ 5 6 5 7 8 9 5 5 8 The most frequently used theories in PA promotion trials in cancer survivors were social cognitive theory (building on attitudes and self-efficacy to foster intentions as a means to affect behavior) and the transtheoretical model (initiating healthy behavior changes through a series of progressive stages), which have shown promise in enhancing both PA and dietary habits among cancer survivors [ 10-12 13-15 The multi-process action control (M-PAC) framework builds on traditional behavior change theories and extends beyond them by focusing not only on determinants of PA intention formation, but also on constructs that bridge the intention-to-behavior gap [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 In view of this research gap, a smartphone app named WExercise was developed on the basis of M-PAC to promote PA among cancer survivors. It comprised weekly lessons delivered primarily through text, images, and video-based content aimed at promoting PA. The app underwent a rigorous iterative development process and was tested for usability [ 23 Methods Study Design This was an assessor-blinded 2-arm RCT comparing WExercise against self-directed PA education, conducted between November 1, 2022, and May 31, 2024. Reporting in this study followed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines. Participants Participants were eligible if they were ≥18 years of age, ≥12 months postcompletion of primary treatment with curative intent, had no metastasis nor recurrence, were not meeting the recommended PA guideline (<150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or <75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week), had access to a smart device, could read Chinese and communicate in Cantonese or Putonghua, and were cleared by a nurse for unsupervised exercise using a risk screening tool [ 24 Sample size calculation was based on a previous study of an M-PAC–based exercise telephone counseling intervention for hematologic cancer survivors [ 20 Procedures Recruitment took place in the outpatient clinic of a major public hospital in Hong Kong and in community support groups. Potential participants were given a brochure about the study and screened for eligibility before providing written informed consent. After providing written consent, participants were randomly assigned to the WExercise or control group (1:1). Randomization was performed using block randomization with a random block size of 4 or 6. An independent statistician generated the randomization list using a computer and kept a secure copy of the randomization code assignments. The group assignment was sealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The research assistants responsible for data collection and entering the data were blinded to the group allocation. Control Group Participants of both groups were provided to increase their aerobic exercise levels to 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week. Participants in the control group received a 1-page written information sheet regarding PA for cancer survivors [ 1 25 Intervention Group Participants in the intervention group were additionally provided with individualized access to the WExercise app, which had 12 lessons, including 10 automated weekly lessons aimed at promoting PA and 2 additional lessons on introduction and safety precautions in the first week. The app, developed using an app design platform (Pathverse [ 26 The weekly lessons were designed to develop reflective, regulatory, and reflexive processes of cancer survivors to achieve a behavioral pattern of action control to engage in PA, based on the M-PAC framework and the adoption of different behavior change techniques. The structure of lessons was as follows: (1) lessons 1-3: initiating and ongoing reflective processes (instrumental attitude, perceived capability, affective attitude, and perceived opportunity), which are the key to forming intention and beginning the translation of intention into behavior; (2) lessons 4-8: behavioral regulation through action and coping planning, self-monitoring, self-regulating alternative activities, emotion regulation, and building a supportive social and physical environment; and (3) lessons 9-10: forming habits and identity (reflexive processes) for sustaining action control [ 1 23 Safety Precautions At study entry, participants were screened by a trained nurse for contraindications to exercise based on a risk screening tool covering hematologic, musculoskeletal, systemic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurologic conditions [ 24 Data Collection Data were collected face-to-face by trained research assistants on university campuses for both groups at baseline (T0), postintervention (10 weeks later; T1), and 12 weeks postintervention (22 weeks later; T2). Primary Outcome PA behavior was operationalized as time spent in MVPA measured in both objective and self-reported ways. For objective measurement, participants were asked to wear an ActiGraph GT3X (an accelerometer that measures intensity-specific PA) on their nondominant wrist for 7 consecutive days at T0, T1, and T2. Data were collected using a 30 Hz frequency, converted to 60-second epochs, and processed using ActiLife 6.13.4 software (ActiGraph LLC). The criterion for data inclusion was at least 10 hours of wear time on at least 3 days [ 27 28 29 Secondary Outcomes Exercise capacity was measured by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), which is a cost-effective measure that is well correlated with peak oxygen uptake (the gold standard measure) and is highly reproducible. The 6MWT was implemented according to American Thoracic Society guidelines [ 30 Cancer-specific QoL was measured using the 30-item European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ–C30) [ 31 The M-PAC constructs were administered using a composite questionnaire [ 32 33-41 Demographic characteristics and disease information were collected using an investigator-designed background questionnaire at T0. Data Analysis All statistical analyses were conducted in SPSS statistical software (version 28; IBM Corp). A 5% level of significance was used. Between-group differences in background characteristics and frequency of adverse events were assessed by a chi-square test or an independent t 42 d Ethical Considerations Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of The University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster HKU/HA Results Participant Characteristics A total of 98 participants were recruited into the study, of whom 81 (82.7%) completed the study (36 in the intervention group and 45 in the control group; Figure 1 Table 1 Multimedia Appendix 1 Figure 1.

Per-protocol analysis was performed on the data of intervention group participants who had high compliance and completed all measurements (n=25), as well as control group participants who completed all measurements (n=45). The baseline characteristics were comparable between the 2 study groups ( Multimedia Appendix 3 MultimediaAppendices 4 5 Discussion Principal Findings To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effectiveness of a smartphone app, iteratively developed based on the M-PAC framework, WExercise, to promote PA among cancer survivors. For PA, mixed findings were identified, with self-reported MVPA showing a significant effect but ActiGraph-measured MVPA showing a nonsignificant effect. The app was also effective for increasing cancer survivors’ exercise capacity, but not their QoL. In terms of M-PAC constructs, the intervention group reported significant improvement in affective attitude toward PA, behavioral regulation for PA, habit of PA, and PA identity, while the control group improved only in behavioral regulation and PA identity; however, the change in between-group difference over time did not reach statistical significance. Our study supported a significant effect on self-reported PA but not objectively measured PA. This discrepancy may be explained in several ways. First, the improvement in self-reported PA may be an overestimation caused by social desirability response bias. Second, activities of higher intensities are easier to recall due to feelings of tiredness, increasing the tendency to overreport. It is also possible that participants misinterpreted light-intensity activities as MVPA. Third, participants may have engaged in activities involving no vertical acceleration, such as cycling and upper-body movement, which might not be recorded efficiently using an ActiGraph [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 The M-PAC framework is a behavior change framework emphasizing action control, which differs from traditional behavior change theories that focus more on building intention rather than translating it into behavioral enactment [ 10 19 50 20 20 51 d 5 52 d 53 d 54 5 52 53 5 52 53 53 Our study also extends previous research by secondary outcome analyses examining the changes in the M-PAC constructs, providing clues to how the intervention worked. While the nonsignificant group × time interaction in the M-PAC constructs may be explained by a lack of power, the within-group changes are worthwhile to explore. Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in regulation and identity, which may be explained by the fact that participants in both groups learned to regulate their PA behavior (eg, scheduling PA) after knowing about the recommended exercise guidelines and categorizing themselves as exercisers by enrolling in our study. Improvement in affect and habit was only reported in the intervention group with nonsignificant but small-to-medium-sized effects, but not in the control group, which may be triggered by the content of the app related to strategies to enhance the pleasure and enjoyment of PA and the use of prompts and cues to enact and maintain PA behavior. The lack of change in the other 2 constructs, perceived capability and perceived opportunity, highlights the need to strengthen the intervention on these aspects to enhance the ability and access to exercise, such as by including options for attending in-person or remotely delivered exercise sessions in conjunction with the app. Approximately 70% of participants in our study completed more than 75% of lessons via the app. This appears to be comparable to a previous mobile health feasibility study promoting health behavior change among childhood cancer survivors, in which 57% of participants completed all 10 app-based education modules [ 55 23 Implications Health care providers could recommend the WExercise app to inactive or insufficiently active cancer survivors who have no contraindications to unsupervised exercise, given its benefit in promoting self-reported PA and exercise capacity. To address the identified areas of improvement regarding app features and user interactivity, future iterations of the application should incorporate advanced features such as personalized feedback and incentives. Other novel functionalities should also be brainstormed to further differentiate the app from generic fitness trackers and enhance user engagement. Future studies may explore the feasibility and effectiveness of adding a few sessions of in-person PA training to the app intervention to maximize cost-effectiveness, as well as using customized behavior change techniques in the app to account for individual differences to better promote behavior change. In addition, future research should systematically investigate the potential factors causing incongruence between self-reported and objectively measured PA and explore strategies to enhance compliance with ActiGraph wearing to improve accuracy (eg, regular check-ins and rewear for missing days). Alternative self-reported measures and activity monitors of MVPA with higher agreement could be considered for use in future trials. Strengths and Limitations Our study demonstrates several strengths. First, the WExercise app is uniquely driven by the M-PAC framework, addressing the intention-to-behavior gap by focusing on both intention formation and actionable strategies for behavior change. Second, the app was developed through a rigorous iterative process to ensure usability before the main trial. However, this study also has several limitations. First, most participants were educated and female, and they were recruited from one study site, limiting the generalizability of the findings. Second, the lack of participant blinding may have affected participant behavior and outcome reporting, introducing a risk of bias. Third, self-selection bias may have affected the findings because participants who signed up for the study may already have been motivated to be physically active, potentially overestimating the effectiveness of the app. Fourth, participants were sent reminders for missing classes, which may differ from routine practice and impact adherence in real-world settings. Conclusions WExercise, a smartphone app, demonstrated significant benefits in increasing self-reported PA and exercise capacity at postintervention and 12 weeks postintervention, but not in ActiGraph-measured PA, M-PAC constructs, or QoL among cancer survivors. The app may be useful to promote PA in this population.
