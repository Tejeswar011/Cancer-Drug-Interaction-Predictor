OTUDs are a key subfamily of the ovarian tumor protease (OTU) family, with important DUB activities, and include mainly OTUD1, OTUD2, OTUD3, OTUD4, OTUD5, OTUD6A, and OTUD6B. In recent years, research on OTUD proteins has been gradually emphasized, and their aberrant expression has demonstrated significant research value in many diseases, such as cancer, immune abnormalities, neurological disorders, and embryonic developmental abnormalities. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of OTUD proteins and their use as therapeutic targets for diseases is of great value. This article focuses on the role of individual OTUD proteins in cancer progression and antiviral response. Importantly, in the context of cancer, we elaborate on their deubiquitinated protein targets and summarize the signaling mechanisms by which they promote or inhibit cancer progression. In the future, targeting OTUD proteins may become a therapeutic direction for cancer, and this review may be useful for research related to OTUD proteins and cancer. At present, there is a lack of research on targeted inhibitors or activators of OTUDs.

Due to the presence of seven lysine residues (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, and Lys63) and one methionine residue in the Ub, each of these residues can serve as an acceptor site for the next Ub [ 2 4 1 5 6 7 8 2 Members of the OTUDs Subfamily of Deubiquitinating Enzymes Protein ubiquitination is a highly conserved reversible post-translational modification process. The E1/E2/E3 axis attaches Ub chains to proteins, initiating the UPS. In contrast, DUBs can specifically remove Ub chains from proteins and block the UPS [ 8 8 4 8 10 The OTUs family is the second largest superfamily of DUBs, containing 17 OTU members, and it is subdivided into four subfamilies: the otubains subfamily (OTUB1 and OTUB2), the OTUD subfamily (OTUD1, OTUD2, OTUD3, OTUD4, OTUD5, OTUD6A, OTUD6B, and ALG13), the A20-like OTUs subfamily (A20, OTUD7A, OTUD7B, TRABID, and VCPIP1), and the OTULIN subfamily (OTULIN and FAM105A) [ 10 10 10 11 3 New Frontiers of OTUD Proteins in Cancer Progression 3.1 OTUD1 OTUD1, or DUBA7, consists of 481 amino acids, including the OTU structural and C-terminal UIM structural domains [ 10 11 12 13 14 During cancer progression, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) sequentially activates SMAD2/3 and SMAD4 through activation of TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI), and SMAD4 enters the nucleus and promotes the expression of oncogenes, leading to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [ 15 16 17 18 18 Apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is normally mainly confined to mitochondria and promotes cell survival by stabilizing the normal structure of mitochondria by maintaining the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) process [ 19 20 21 22 22 22 22 22 In addition, OTUD1 was also significantly under-expressed in renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) tissues, and low OTUD1 expression was associated with shorter disease-free survival and poor prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in ccRCC patients [ 23 24 23 23 25 Iron is an essential element for cell growth and proliferation, and while intracellular iron accumulation promotes cancer cell proliferation and metastasis, it also predisposes cancer cells to ferroptosis [ 26 27 27 28 29 30 31 30 30 The accumulation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in the nucleus has been associated with cancer, and OTUD1 has been identified as a DUB that cleaves the K63-type polyUb chain of YAP and as a negative regulator of the nuclear translocation and activity of YAP [ 32 33 36 33 35 36 However, it has also been suggested that OTUD1 may be an oncogene in some cancers. Analysis of the TCGA database showed that high OTUD1 expression was associated with worse overall survival in patients and may be an unfavorable prognostic factor for hepatocellular and ovarian cancers as well as specific subtypes of breast and cervical cancers [ 37 22 37 38 38 Fig. 1 Figure 1 The role of OTUD1 in the pathogenesis of related cancers OTUD1 first prevents the degradation of SMAD7 by cleaving its K48-type poly Ub chain and then promotes the formation of SMAD7/Smurf2 complex by cleaving its K33-type poly Ub chain, thus antagonizing the TGF-β/TβRI/SMAD signaling pathway, ultimately inhibiting EMT and cancer stem cell properties in breast cancer. OTUD1 cleaves the K27-type and K63-type poly-Ub chains of AIF on K244, which leads to mitochondrial structural disruption and impairment of the OXPHOS process and ultimately induce ESCC cell death. Alternatively, OTUD1 indirectly promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of the K48-type polyUb chain of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1 by stabilizing DDB1 and DCAF10, which increases the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane and promotes the release of cytochrome C and AIF, which is followed by the activation of the caspase-dependent apoptosis process through the cytochrome C. In contrast, cleavage of AIF by OTUD1 at the K63-type polyUb chain on K255 encourages the entry of AIF into the nucleus and strongly binds chromosomal DNA, thereby inducing parthanatos. OTUD1 prevents the degradation of PTEN protein by cleaving the K48-type poly Ub chain of PTEN protein. The stabilized PTEN inhibited the proliferation of ccRCC cells by suppressing the PI3K/AKT and TNF-alpha/NF-kB signaling pathways, and at the same time, enhanced the sensitivity of cancer cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). OTUD1 cleaves the K48-type and K63-type polyUb chains of IREB2 protein, and stabilized IREB2 protein increases intracellular iron concentration through activation of transferrin receptor (TFRC), and the accumulation of excess iron leads to the continuous production of ROS, which ultimately induces ferroptosis in cancer cells. OTUD1 enhances the host’s T cell-mediated antitumor immune response by promoting damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release. OTUD1 inactivates the SOX9/SPP1 axis by blocking the nuclear translocation and activity of YAP1, which ultimately reverses erlotinib resistance in NSCLC cells. OTUD1 may inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells by deubiquitinating and stabilizing the tumor suppressors KLF4 and FHL1. OTUD1 may induce PDAC resistance to gemcitabine and promote cell growth by deubiquitinating and stabilizing Nrf2 and YAP proteins. 3.2 OTUD2 OTUD2, also known as YOD1 or DUBA8, consists of 348 amino acids, including the N-terminal UBX structural domain, the central OTU structural domain, and the C-terminal ZNF structural domain [ 10 39 40 41 42 In recent years, the role of OTUD2 in cancer has also been increasingly emphasized, and it may become a prognostic biomarker for cancer. OTUD2 has achieved some research results in NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, and their oncogene [ 34 43 34 43 44 46 47 Currently, the link between OTUD2 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression seems to be debated. Kim et al.’s research team found that the expression level of OTUD2 in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues was significantly higher than that in adjacent normal tissues and was strongly and positively correlated with the expression level of YAP [ 48 48 49 48 + + 50 Fig. 2 Figure 2 The role of OTUD2 in the pathogenesis of HCC OTUD2 promotes LATS1/2 ubiquitination and degradation by enhancing the stability of ITCH (an E3 ligase), which induces the entry of YAP/TAZ into the nucleus, enhances hepatocyte proliferation, and induces hepatomegaly. M2-type macrophage-derived EVs target and inhibit OTUD2 by secreting miR-21-5p, which leads to activation of the YAP/β-catenin pathway and subsequent CD8 + + 3.3 OTUD3 OTUD3 is an acetylation-dependent deubiquitinating enzyme consisting of 398 amino acids, mainly including the OTU and UBA structural domains, which are highly conserved in eukaryotic evolution [ 10 51 52 Relevant evidence suggests that OTUD3 is strongly associated with the progression of several human cancers. Studies have confirmed that the OTUD3/PTEN axis inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting the transduction of the PI3K/AKT pathway [ 53 54 55 55 56 58 ′ 59 60 61 61 61 Fig. 3 Figure 3 The role of OTUD3 in the pathogenesis of related cancers On the contrary, a related study reported that OTUD3 may act as an oncogene in HCC and lung cancer. OTUD3 was significantly overexpressed in HCC tissues compared with paracancerous tissues and was associated with larger tumor volume, more vascular infiltration, intrahepatic metastasis, worse TNM stage, and lower overall survival [ 62 in vivo in vitro 62 57 63 57 63 Fig. 3 OTUD3/PTEN axis inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting the transduction of the PI3K/AKT pathway. The OTUD3/P53 axis inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation and enhanced chemosensitivity. OTUD3 directly interacts with ZFP36 and stabilizes the ZFP36 protein by cleaving the K48-type polyUb chain, which subsequently promotes the degradation of VEGF-C mRNA to inhibit lymphatic metastasis. OTUD3 promotes lung cancer growth and metastasis by deubiquitinating and stabilizing the glucose regulatory protein GRP78. OTUD3 promotes HCC growth and invasion through deubiquitination and stabilization of ACTN4 protein. 3.4 OTUD4 OTUD4 is a deubiquitinating enzyme with high sensitivity to K48-type polyUb chains, consisting of 1113 amino acids, and is involved in various physiological and pathological processes [ 10 10 64 Studies have shown that as a tumor suppressor, OTUD4 expression is significantly down-regulated in various solid tumors, and low OTUD4 expression is a predictive molecule for poor prognosis [ 65 65 66 67 67 68 Fig. 4 64 Figure 4 The role of OTUD4 in the pathogenesis of related cancers OTUD4 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasive ability of breast, liver, and lung cancer cells by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting the AKT signaling pathway. The DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 induces hypermethylation of the promoter of MEG3 and inhibits its expression, which then promotes the growth of breast cancer cells through the regulation of the miR-494-3p/OTUD4 axis. OTUD4 can enhance the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to radiotherapy by inhibiting the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway of DNA DSBs. OTUD4 enhances the radiosensitization of NPC cells by initiating a GSDME-dependent pyroptosis pathway. 3.5 OTUD5 OTUD5, also known as DUBA, consists of 571 amino acids and is about 60 kD, mainly consisting of the OTU structural and UIM structural domains at the C-terminus [ 10 69 69 70 Knockdown of OTUD5 has been reported to significantly promote the proliferation of HCC cells (Huh7 and Hep3B), and reduced levels of OTUD5 are associated with a highly invasive phenotype and poor clinical outcome and may play an oncogene role in a variety of solid tumors [ 71 71 71 72 73 72 73 In contrast, the knockdown of OTUD5 resulted in the loss of activity of PDCD5 and p53 proteins, promoting proliferation, metastasis, drug resistance, and apoptosis resistance in NSCLC cells [ 74 75 76 77 However, some related studies have reported that OTUD5 acts as an oncogene in bladder cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Hou et al. found that OTUD5 was overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues or cell lines and that OTUD5 knockdown or overexpression inhibited and promoted cell proliferation in bladder cancer, respectively [ 78 78 78 79 Fig. 5 Figure 5 The role of OTUD5 in the pathogenesis of related cancers OTUD5 inhibits TRIM25 activity by cleaving the K63-type polyUb chain, thereby suppressing TRIM25 enrichment on the PML promoter, which in turn promotes PML transcription and inhibits HCC and NSCLC progression. OTUD5 inhibits the proliferation, invasion, and migration of NSCLC cells by deubiquitinating and stabilizing PDCD5/p53 axis and PTEN proteins. OTUD5 reduces the level of AKT phosphorylation activation through deubiquitination to increase the sensitivity of cervical cancer to radiotherapy. OTUD5 promotes bladder cancer progression by adjusting the RNF186/sestrin2/mTOR pathway. OTUD5 enhances the metastatic potential of TNBC by inducing M2-type macrophage polarization by promoting the nuclear translocation activity of YAP protein. 3.6 OTUD6A In recent years, several studies have confirmed the involvement of OTUD6A in the malignant progression of colorectal, prostate, breast, and gastric cancers as an oncogene. Aurora kinase A (Aurora-A) is a serine/threonine kinase that is overexpressed in various human cancers, and inhibitors targeting Aurora kinase are under clinical investigation [ 80 81 82 83 84 85 84 85 86 87 Fig. 6 Figure 6 The role of OTUD6A in the pathogenesis of related cancers OTUD6A drives mitosis and cell cycle by activating Aurora-A/PLK1/CKS2 signaling axis. OTUD6A can increase the stability and promote the expression of Drp1 protein through ubiquitination, which promotes the onset of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission, and enhances the proliferation and colony formation of cancer cells. OTUD6A promotes the proliferation of prostate cancer cells by deubiquitinating and stabilizing the Brg1 and AR proteins. OTUD6A promotes prostate carcinogenesis by deubiquitinating and stabilizing the c-Myc protein. In breast cancer, OTUD6A increases the stability of TopBP1 by cleaving the K48-type polyUb chain, thereby initiating the DDR pathway, leading to tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. OTUD6A cleaves the K48-type polyUb chain of nucleolin and the K63-type polyUb chain of caspase 7, which enhanced the cell cycle progression and induced cell proliferation in breast cancer MCF7 cells. 3.7 OTUD6B In vitro 88 89 89 88 In contrast, OTUD6B may be a tumor suppressor factor in HCC and ccRCC. The von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor (pVHL) protein is a tumor suppressor that promotes the degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-α (HIF-α) [ 90 91 92 90 92 94 95 95 95 96 94 Fig. 7 Figure 7 The role of OTUD6B in the pathogenesis of related cancers In the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, HIF-1α promotes angiogenesis and tumor invasion and directly promotes OTUD6B transcription. In turn, OTUD6B prevents the degradation of pVHL protein by maintaining the stability of the pVHL-CBC ligase complex, which in turn inhibits the activation of the HIF-1α signaling axis and ultimately inhibits the migration and metastasis of HCC cells. OTUD6B inhibited ccRCC migration by regulating pVHL/HIF-2α. 4 Role of OTUD Proteins in the Antiviral Response In the face of viral infection, an inadequate antiviral response can lead to chronic illness, while an overactive response can lead to the development of inflammatory and even autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the host must have mechanisms to regulate the antiviral response to maintain immune homeostasis tightly. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) mainly include retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytosolic DNA sensors, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), whose activation is the first line of defense for initiating the innate immune response [ 97 98 99 100 101 4.1 Role of OTUDs Proteins in Innate Anti-RNA Virus Responses Several studies have shown that OTUD proteins are mainly involved in the regulatory process of suppressing RNA virus-induced innate immune responses. RNA viruses have been reported to promote the expression of DNA damage-inducible transcript 3, which supports the expression of OTUD1 through activation of the NF-κB axis. Then OTUD1 further inhibits RNA virus-induced type I interferon (IFN-I) production but does not affect DNA-STING signaling, which may be a possible host mechanism for preventing an overly anti-RNA viral response as a mechanism for the host to avoid excessive anti-RNA virus responses [ 102 101 103 103 104 39 52 97 52 97 52 52 105 106 107 108 108 Fig. 8 Figure 8 The role of OTUDs proteins in the antiviral response RNA vrius recruits MAVS by actives the RIG-I and MDA5. cGAS responds to DNA virus stimulation by recruiting the STING protein. Next, activated MAVS and STING further recruit and activate TRAF protein, promoting type I and proinflammatory cytokines by activating the downstream key transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, and NF-κB. IFN and proinflammatory cytokine synthesis induce an anti-DNA/RNA virus response. 4.2 Role of OTUDs Proteins in Innate Anti-DNA Viral Responses Currently, there are fewer studies on OTUD proteins and innate anti-DNA viral responses, with only OTUD3 and OTUD5. Whether enhancing or inhibiting, most enzymes that regulate the antiviral response usually respond to DNA and RNA viral infections in the same way, showing little to no opposing effects. Earlier, we mentioned that OTUD3 can inhibit the anti-RNA virus response. In addition, OTUD3 is also able to inhibit cGAS degradation by removing the K48-type polyUb chain to which the cGAS protein is attached, thereby initiating the anti-DNA virus response [ 97 52 109 Fig. 8 5 Summary and Outlook In recent years, DUBs have gradually emerged as emerging targets in therapeutic studies of cancer and immune diseases. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the roles of seven DUBs with OTU structural domains in cancer progression and antiviral immune responses, including OTUD1, OTUD2, OTUD3, OTUD4, OTUD5, OTUD6A, and OTUD6B. OTUD proteins affect the degradation of substrate proteins and cellular transport processes by cleaving different types of Ub chains. It affects tumor cells’ signal transduction, cell proliferation, invasion, and drug-resistance behaviors. Interestingly, we found that OTUD proteins play opposing roles in different tissue types of human cancers. Since different cancer tissue types may have widely differing tumor microenvironments, the same OTUD proteins may play different cancer regulatory roles with tissue specificity, which may explain the occurrence of this phenomenon. Therefore, each cancer should examine such genes to determine whether they play a tumor-suppressive or tumor-promoting role. Currently, studies of corresponding OTUDs targeting inhibitors or activators are lacking, and more in vivo in vitro Not applicable.
