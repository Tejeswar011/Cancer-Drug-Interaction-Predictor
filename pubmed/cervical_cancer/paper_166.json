Adenomyosis is a common gynecological disease characterized by the invasion of endometrial glands and stroma into the myometrium of uterus, the pathological mechanism of which remains unclear yet. Disturbed lipid metabolism extensively affects abnormal cell proliferation and invasion in various diseases. However, the lipidome signature of human myometrium, which could be crucial in the development of adenomyosis, remains unknown. In this study, we generated the first lipidome profiling of human myometrium using a high-coverage and quantitative lipidomics approach based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with triple quadrupole (QqQ)-mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 317 lipid species were successfully quantified in the myometrial tissues from women with ( n n Graphical abstract Image 1 Highlights • Integrated lipidome profiling of human myometrium was obtained for the first time. • Multiple lipid alternations were found in the myometrium of women with adenomyosis. • The combination of five lipids accurately distinguished adenomyosis from the controls. • Spatial heterogeneity of the five lipid markers were further revealed by MS imaging.

On this basis, the lipidome changes in the myometrium of patients with adenomyosis were comprehensively investigated, revealing dysregulated lipid pathway and potential lipid markers that could identify whether the myometrium invaded by adenomyosis. Subsequently, DESI-MSI was employed to further elucidate the spatial distribution characteristics of these lipid markers in the adenomyosis lesions and surrounding myometrial tissues. The current study may provide a lipid-centric biological insight that is important for clarifying the pathophysiology, as well as identifying potential biomarkers of adenomyosis. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Participants and sample collection The cross-sectional study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH; Beijing, China) (Approval No.: ZS-2025) in June 2019. A total of 103 female patients who underwent hysterectomy at the general gynecological center of PUMCH from July 2019 to December 2022 were enrolled and divided into two groups. The study group included 38 patients with histologically confirmed adenomyosis, whereas the control group comprised 65 patients without adenomyosis who had undergone hysterectomy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia III ( n n 22 23 24 28 Table 1 P Table 1 Table 1 Clinical characteristics of subjects recruited in this study.

Dichloromethane (DCM) and methyl tert Table S1 2.3 Sample preparation For lipidomics analysis, the total crude lipids were extracted as follows. After adding 400 μL of water, 20 mg of the myometrial tissue sample was vortexed for 60 s, homogenized at 45 Hz for 4 min, and sonicated for 5 min in an ice-water bath. The homogenization and sonication cycles were repeated three times. Then, 150 μL of homogenate was mixed with 50 μL of water, and 480 μL of extract solution (MTBE:methanol = 5:1, v v 2 v v v For DESI-MSI analysis and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, the frozen tissues that contained the adenomyotic foci were cut into 10-μm thick slices utilizing NX70 cryostat microtome (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) at −20 °C. Afterwards, the slices were thaw-mounted on Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and stored at −80 °C until DESI-MSI analysis. The slices were dried for 2 h before the MSI experiments were conducted. 2.4 Lipidomics analysis The quantitation of all targeted lipids in human myometrial samples were conducted by UPLC-QqQ-MS.

Although the above lipid makers profoundly altered in normal myometrium between the two groups, their distribution among the adenomyosis lesion and the adjacent surrounding myometrium remains unknown. DESI-MSI was then utilized to explore whether these lipid markers exhibited heterogeneous distributions within the uterus. Histological examination using H&E staining revealed the presence of adenomyotic foci, characterized by ectopic endometrial glands and stroma, scattered in the myometrium in patients diagnosed with adenomyosis ( Fig. 6 Table 2 Fig. S3 Fig. 6 Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and desorption electrospray ionization ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) of the five lipid markers in myometrium of adenomyosis patient.

A diagnostic model combining five lipid species presented robust performance with an AUC above 0.9 in distinguishing the myometrium of patients with adenomyosis from that of control subjects. Furthermore, DESI-MS anlysis displayed the metabolic heterogeneity of these lipid markers across the ectopic endometrium and adjacent myometrium. Lipid phosphorylation has been known to play an important role in regulating the membrane localization of proteins [ 31 32 33 34 Cers, the central intermediates of sphingolipid metabolism, are critically involved in immune system function and affect the migration of various cell lines [ 35 36 37 2+ 38 2 2α 39 40 High levels of FFAs, particularly saturated FFAs, can activate inflammatory responses via a variety of mechanisms [ 41 42 43 [44] [45] [46] 47 de novo 48 Fig. 1 Fig. S1 The etiology of adenomyosis is thought to be multifactorial, and to date, there is no sole theory that can explain the overall pathogenesis of adenomyosis. For an ideal framework of pathological study, it is perhaps more profitable to conduct a navigational scan of all, if possible, distributing factors related to this disease. Fortunately, the global development of omics technology has assisted in obtaining a conclusion that is closer to the full truth. As a continuation of our metabolomics study on adenomyosis [ 22 At present, there is still an unmet need to further clarify the pathogenesis of adenomyosis so that novel diagnostic methods or therapies can be developed. There are several novel findings in these lipidome data that warrant subsequent research, such as the quantitative abnormalities of Cers and FFAs in the myometrium of patients with adenomyosis. These lipid disorders collectively indicate inflammatory and immune disorders, which have also been mentioned in some previous studies on adenomyosis [ 49 50 Our study suggests that lipids could be potential indicators for discriminating myometrial tissues from patients with or without adenomyosis. Since targeted lipid species could be conveniently tested by shotgun or MSI approaches, lipid markers showed potential as alternatives in the histological diagnosis or rapid intraoperative diagnosis of adenomyosis, for which the diagnostic certainty should be further validated in independent cohorts and multiple centers. Based on the present research, it is necessary to investigate the lipidome characteristics of patients with adenomyosis in different samples (such as endometrium and serum) and different populations. Additionally, the MS-based imaging technique employed in this study has demonstrated its efficacy in elucidating the spatial distribution of specific lipid molecules within the uterus affected by adenomyosis. In the near future, we intend to enhance this imaging method by expanding the mass range and improving its spatial resolution. This will be complemented by unbiased screening strategies to further identify differentially expressed lipid species and systematically explore the correlations among their spatial distributions. One advantage of this study is the integrative profiling of myometrial samples using a high-coverage lipidomics approach and ambient MSI, which yielded quantitative, reproducible, and visualized results, allowing the expansion of this research to other subjects and other populations. Another strength of the present study lies in the novelty of the determined tissues, which are adjacent to lesional sites and should be more responsive to the metabolic changes associated with adenomyosis. One limitation of the study was that although we investigated the lipid phenotypes of the myometrium in patients with and without adenomyosis, it is unclear whether lipid dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of adenomyosis or is only a byproduct of disease progression. Moreover, further studies are needed to elucidate whether the present findings are applicable in early adenomyosis, considering that most patients who undergo hysterectomy have severe adenomyosis. In addition, further studies in larger cohorts are required to validate our findings. 5 Conclusions In this study, we present the inaugural integrated lipidome profiling of human myometrium, accomplished through the combined application of high-coverage targeted lipidomics and ambient MSI. This strategy enabled us to furnish comprehensive and visual evidences of disordered lipid metabolism in the myometrium from women diagnosed with adenomyosis. These lipid aberrations implicated various metabolic pathways and highlighted processes such as inflammation, cell migration, and immune dysregulation in the context of adenomyosis. Furthermore, a panel comprising five specific lipid species demonstrated high efficacy in distinguishing myometrial tissues from women with and without adenomyosis. Distinct visualization of these lipid markers using DESI-MSI further revealed their heterogeneous metabolic characteristics within adenomyotic lesions and adjacent myometrial tissues. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of adenomyosis and provide valuable insights into the development of biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for managing this condition.
