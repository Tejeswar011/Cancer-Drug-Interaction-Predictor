Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, ranking fourth in incidence and fifth in mortality. In 2022, 1,142,286 new CRC cases were diagnosed globally, and projections estimate that by 2040, this number will rise to 1,916,781 [ 1 2 3 4 Chronic inflammation has emerged as a key driver in CRC development and progression. Immune cells infiltrating the tumor microenvironment (TME) release numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), which amplify local inflammation [ 5 6 7 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 7 11 14 Interestingly, growing evidence points to the role of metabolic dysregulation and adipokines in modulating the inflammatory TME and influencing cancer progression. One such molecule is retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), a serum transporter of retinol secreted primarily by the liver and adipocytes [ 15 16 17 17 18 19 20 21 15 16 22 19 19 21 23 24 25 In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression patterns and potential clinical significance of IL-6 and RBP4 in colorectal cancer. The initial phase involved the immunohistochemical analysis of IL-6 and RBP4 expression in CRC tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Protein expression levels were evaluated based on our own immunohistochemical data, while associations with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival (OS) were systematically analyzed. To broaden our understanding, bioinformatic analyses were conducted using publicly available transcriptomic datasets to assess IL-6- and RBP4-related transcriptional landscapes and their potential regulatory networks. Functional enrichment and pathway analyses were performed to identify biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components associated with IL-6 and RBP4 expression. By integrating experimental and bioinformatic approaches, this study aims to define the prognostic value of IL-6 and RBP4 expression in CRC and to provide novel insights into their roles in colorectal tumorigenesis and potential as therapeutic targets. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patients and Tissue Material This study was conducted on tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples collected from patients undergoing colectomy in 2015–2021 at the Department of Surgery of Dr. J. Biziel from the University Hospital No. 2 in Bydgoszcz. Patients diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma were included in this investigation, while the exclusion criteria were as follows: hereditary colorectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy before resection, and reoperation due to recurrent cancer. The study group included 118 patients (47 females, 71 males) with an average age of 68 years at operation (median 68, range 27–89). Herein, pathologic TNM stage is based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition. Histologically normal tissues adjacent to the tumor were available for 42 cases, and these constituted the control group. Clinical follow-up data, including patient survival status, were collected from hospital records. OS was defined as the time from surgery until the last recorded follow-up or death. The end date for survival analysis was set at 25 March 2025. This study was carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved by the Nicolaus Copernicus University Ethics Committee (no. 454/2021; date of approval: 14/09/2021). 2.2. Tissue Microarrays and Immunohistochemical Staining Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed on tissue microarrays according to the previously described protocol by Antosik et al. IL-6 and RBP4 proteins were stained in BenchMark ® 26 2.3. Evaluation of Immunohistochemical Staining The protein expression was assessed at 20× objective magnification in a blinded manner by two independent researchers, including a senior pathologist (DG) (inter-observer agreement: IL-6, κ = 0.760; RBP4, κ = 0.781), using the DP600 scanner (Roche Diagnostics/Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, AZ, USA). Immunohistochemical expression was evaluated using the H-score system, which combines staining intensity (scored 0–3) and the percentage of positively stained cells. The final score ranged from 0 to 300. For analytical purposes, protein expression was dichotomized into low (negative) and high (positive) categories based on discriminatory cut-off values determined using the Evaluate Cutpoints software (R version 4.4.2) [ 27 Gene expression data were obtained from the UCSC Xena platform in the form of RSEM expected counts and subsequently normalized using the DESeq2 package. The initial RNA-seq transcriptomic data were aligned with the STAR aligner and quantified via RSEM. To ensure reliability of the clinicopathological correlations, only patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma and complete clinicopathological information (age, gender, pT, pN, pM, and TNM stage) were included in the analysis, while cases with missing or undefined clinical data were excluded. The final study cohort comprised 350 CRC cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Expression analyses of IL- RBP4 http://xena.ucsc.edu IL-6 RBP4 To identify genes with positive correlation to IL-6 RBP4 https://www.cbioportal.org https://reactome.org https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html Protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed for the top IL-6- and RBP4-associated genes using the STRING database ( https://string-db.org https://david.ncifcrf.gov 2.4. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses and visualizations were performed using GraphPad Prism (version 8.0; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and RStudio (version 1.3.1093). The Shapiro–Wilk test was applied to assess the normality of continuous variables. Based on the distribution of the data, appropriate parametric or non-parametric statistical tests were selected. Comparisons of IL-6 and RBP4 expression levels between tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumorous tissues were conducted using the Mann–Whitney U test. The relationships between categorized IL-6 and RBP4 expression and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, depending on the expected cell counts. Overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, and differences between survival curves were evaluated with the log-rank test. All p p 3. Results 3.1. Immunoexpression of IL-6 and RBP4 in Tumor and Normal Adjacent Tissue and Its Clinicopathological Associations in Our Cohort Cytoplasmic expression of IL-6 was observed in CRC tissues. The staining pattern was characterized by diffuse, non-uniform cytoplasmic labeling of tumor cells, with areas of more intense staining, particularly at the invasive front. Additionally, IL-6 expression was noted in stromal immune cells, including macrophages, within the tumor microenvironment. In adjacent non-cancerous tissues, cytoplasmic IL-6 expression was also detected but at markedly lower levels. Representative images illustrating IL-6 immunohistochemical staining in tumor and adjacent tissues are presented in Figure 1 p Figure 2 Cytoplasmic expression of RBP4 was demonstrated in CRC tissues. The cytoplasmic staining pattern was characterized by ubiquitous, diffuse labeling of tumor cells, although with variable intensity across the tumor tissue. Additionally, RBP4 expression was observed in macrophages present within the tumor microenvironment. In the control group, consisting of adjacent non-cancerous tissues, cytoplasmic RBP4 expression was also detected.

Discussion Colorectal cancer is a major public health concern due to its high rate of occurrence and the fact that its symptoms are often non-specific, making diagnosis challenging [ 2 3 4 10 11 12 18 19 21 24 28 29 30 31 IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been shown to induce acute phase responses, act as a maturation factor for B lymphocytes, participate in T lymphocyte differentiation, and activate natural killer (NK) cells [ 6 7 7 11 8 9 9 10 9 12 The present study demonstrated that the expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the tumor tissue was significantly higher than in the adjacent tissue. In both tumor and adjacent tissue, the sites of highest IL-6 expression were cancer cells and inflammatory cells infiltrating the tumor, but to a lesser extent, expression also appeared in fibroblasts in the lining. This finding aligns with most reports on IL-6 expression [ 8 9 10 11 14 30 31 32 33 34 In our study, a statistically significant association was observed between IL-6 expression and patient age, with higher expression levels noted in individuals over 65 years. This finding aligns with the concept of “inflammaging”, which refers to age-related chronic low-grade inflammation and has been widely associated with increased circulating IL-6 levels. Although previous reports have demonstrated a general trend of elevated IL-6 with advancing age, the relationship is not universally consistent and may be influenced by factors such as comorbidities, gender, or immune status. Our findings support the hypothesis that aging contributes to a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment, which may in turn influence cancer progression [ 35 31 10 36 32 32 9 33 32 10 11 37 30 2 38 In our Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, a significant association was observed between IL-6 expression and overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients with high IL-6 expression exhibited shorter survival times compared to those with low expression, both at the protein and mRNA levels. Similarly, Olsen et al. (2015) reported that elevated IL-6 transcript levels in colon carcinoma tissues were significantly associated with poorer overall survival [ 38 11 14 RBP4 is a retinol-binding protein secreted by adipocytes that has been shown to transport retinol to extrahepatic tissue [ 15 16 17 16 17 39 19 17 18 19 17 40 39 41 21 23 16 25 16 The study revealed that RBP4 expression levels were higher in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. A strong cytoplasmic staining pattern was observed in tumor cells, as well as in the epithelial cells of normal colon tissue. Notably, during the evaluation of RBP4 in colorectal cancer patients, positively stained macrophages were also observed within the tumor microenvironment. This observation adds an additional layer to our understanding of RBP4 distribution and aligns with previous reports highlighting the role of RBP4 in various malignancies [ 15 17 18 19 29 39 42 18 RBP4 43 RBP4 43 Our study demonstrated that high RBP4 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues was significantly associated with pT status, lymph node metastasis, and advanced clinical stage according to the TNM classification. Additionally, these findings were corroborated by in silico analysis, which revealed a significant association between RBP4 expression and lymph node involvement, distant metastases, and TNM staging. The association between RBP4 and tumor size suggests that RBP4 may promote tumor growth, as also described in ovarian cancer, where RBP4 enhances migration and proliferation by activating RhoA/Rock1 and ERK pathways and upregulating MMP2 and MMP9 [ 17 28 41 15 16 18 44 20 Furthermore, the significant correlation between RBP4 expression and obesity-related measures in our study supports the well-established role of RBP4 as an adipokine reflecting adipose tissue mass and visceral fat distribution [ 25 17 28 16 17 19 23 24 19 16 19 41 Our Kaplan–Meier survival analysis in the TCGA cohort revealed a trend suggesting an association between RBP4 expression levels and overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). In our own patient cohort, individuals with elevated RBP4 expression demonstrated a shorter survival time compared to those with lower expression levels of this protein. It was reflected in the other reports demonstrating that enhanced RBP4 correlates with unfavorable prognosis in gastric carcinoma [ 20 28 45 41 17 In the subsequent findings of our study, we demonstrated that the genes IL11 SOCS3 IL-6 IL-6/STAT3 46 47 IL-6 HNF1B IL17RE HNF1B 48 IL17RE IL17 49 IL-6 CXCL8 IL-6/IL-8 ERBB2 IL-6– IL-6 50 Within the set of genes correlated with RBP4 COLEC11 CL-11 CL-11 51 52 CDIPT RBP4 RBP4 RBP4 RBP4 5. Conclusions This study provides comprehensive insights into the role of IL-6 and RBP4 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Both proteins were found to be significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous mucosa. Elevated IL-6 expression was associated with older age and obesity-related parameters, while RBP4 overexpression correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, advanced TNM stage, and markers of obesity, such as increased BMI and waist circumference. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis demonstrated that high expression of IL-6 and RBP4 tended to associate with shorter overall survival, supporting their potential prognostic relevance. In silico analyses confirmed the transcriptional upregulation of IL6 and RBP4 in CRC and revealed distinct molecular pathways—immune/inflammatory signaling for IL-6 and developmental signaling for RBP4—highlighting their possible contributions to tumor biology. Taken together, our findings suggest that IL-6 and RBP4 may function as biomarkers of poor prognosis and may represent potential therapeutic targets, particularly in CRC cases linked to inflammation and obesity. Further research is warranted to explore their mechanistic roles and validate their clinical utility in larger, independent cohorts.
