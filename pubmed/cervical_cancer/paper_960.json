All patients with immune-tolerant CHB conformed to the following inclusion criteria: aged between 29 and 47 years and HBsAg >1 × 10 4 Table 1 Table 1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics of Patients With Immune-tolerant CHB and HDs Variables Patients with CHB (n = 199) HDs (n = 165) Age, years 37.45 ± 8.86 36.79 ± 10.11 Male gender 103 (51.76%) 87 (52.73%) ALT, IU/mL 20.13 ± 7.23 17.52 ± 6.96 AST, IU/mL 20.01 ± 5.06 17.82 ± 4.57 HBsAg, ng/mL >1×10 4 Negative NOTE: Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean for variables in normal distribution, and median (interquartile range) in non-normally distributed variables.

Animals and Reagents Male C57BL/6J mice (5- to 6-weeks old) were obtained from Charles River Laboratories. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)8-HBV1.2 vectors containing 1.2-fold HBV genomes were presented by Professor Chen Peizhe from the Institute of Clinical Medicine at Taiwan University and Academician of the Central Research Institute of Taiwan. Se-Met was purchased from MedChemExpress. Lip-1 was purchased from Psaitong. HBV Mouse Model An HBV mouse model was generated through hydrodynamic injection of a volume of saline (equivalent to 10% body weight) containing 8 μg pAAV/HBV1.2 plasmid or the empty vector. At 5 weeks postinjection, serum HBsAg was detected, and mice with HBsAg levels >500 ng/mL (1000 ng/mL = 1.14 IU/mL) were defined as HBV carrier mice. Human CD8 + PBMCs were isolated from blood by density gradient cell separation. CD8 + MHC Tetramer Staining PBMCs from patients with CHB or sorted CD8 + 7 Flow Cytometry For the analysis of cell surface markers, single-cell suspensions were blocked with rat serum for 30 minutes and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies at 4°C for 1 hour. For analysis of intracellular IFN-γ and TNF-α, PBMC or liver-infiltrating lymphocytes were stimulated with 30 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Beyotime) and 1 μg/mL ionomycin (Beyotime) in the presence of IL-2 (100 U/mL) and brefeldin A (BFA; 5 μg/mL; BioLegend) for 4 hours at 37°C. After blocking with rat serum and staining with antibodies targeting membrane-expressing molecules, cells were fixed by 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized by the Permeabilization buffer (Yeasen), and stained with antibodies. Data were collected using BD FACSCelesta system (BD Biosciences) and analyzed with FlowJo software (FlowJo, LLC).

Lipid Peroxidation and Lipid Accumulation Measurement We used a lipid peroxidation sensor BODIPY581/591 undecanoic acid (Invitrogen) to evaluate the level of ferroptosis in the cells. The sensor changes its fluorescence from PE to FITC upon peroxidation by lipid ROS in cells, thus enabling radiometric measurement of lipid peroxidation. Experiments were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were incubated in a humidified chamber at 37°C with 5% CO 2 Cellular Iron Staining A working solution of 1 μM FerroOrange fluorescent probe (DOJINDO), prepared in serum-free medium, was then added to the cells. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a dark environment for 30 minutes. Finally, the cells were observed, and images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope and examined by FCM. Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos assay A working solution of 200 nM Mito-Tracker Red CMXRos (Beyotime), prepared in serum-free medium, was then added to the cells. The cells were incubated at 37°C in a dark environment for 30 minutes. The cells were examined by FCM. Hoechst (Beyotime) staining solution was used to stain nucleus for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT). The cells were observed, and images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay We applied the Malondialdehyde Assay Kit (DOJINDO) to determine the level of MDA. According to the manufacturer’s protocol, we prepared the serum from HDs and patients with CHB and a specific reagent provided by the kit. We then performed a water bath, cooled the sample, and centrifuged it at 3500 rpm. Sample absorbance was quantified at 532 nm using a microplate reader (Synergy2, Biotek) accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol, and data analysis was performed based on the obtained measurements. TGF-β1 levels in the serum of HDs and patients with CHB were detected by TGF-β1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Multi-sciences) after acid treatment to activate latent TGF-β1 (total TGF-β1) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. The absorbance of TGF-β1 was determined at 450 and 570 nm, and data analysis was performed based on the obtained measurements. The levels of free PA in human serum and mouse serum were quantified using respective PA ELISA kits (Biotopped). Sample absorbance was quantified in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol, and data analysis was performed based on the obtained measurements. ELISA kits for HBsAg (Autobio) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Detection of Cell Death Using Propidium Iodide CD8 + + Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Experiment Primary CD8 + 6 + + Preparation of Palmitate and Oleate Esters One hundred mM palmitic acid and oleic acid solution was prepared with 0.1M NaOH solution, shaken and dissolved in 70°C water baths, and then dissolved with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (FFA free) to prepare a 5 mM reserve solution. Removal of Cell Supernatant Lipids To remove the lipids, the supernatants were treated with gas-phase silicon dioxide. The silicon dioxide was mixed with the cell supernatant and stirred at 37°C for 60 minutes, and the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes to remove the sediment and obtain the lipid-free supernatant. Immunohistochemistry HBcAg in liver tissue was stained with anti-HBcAg monoclonal antibody (Gene Tech) and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Gene Tech). The percentage of HBcAg-positive area in liver sections was quantified; quantification was performed using ImageJ software (v1.8.0, National Institutes of Health). HBV DNA Detection Serum HBV DNA was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using an HBV DNA kit (DAAN Gene, Guangzhou, China). Intrahepatic HBV genomic DNA was extracted using a gDNA kit. RT-qPCR for HBV DNA was performed on a LightCycler 96 system (Roche) using UltraSYBR reagent (CW Biotech). RNA Extraction and RT-qPCR Total RNA was extracted using TRIzon reagent (CWBIO) and then used to synthesize cDNA using HiFiScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (CWBIO). RT-qPCR was performed using the UltraSYBR one-step RT-qPCR kit (CWBIO), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
