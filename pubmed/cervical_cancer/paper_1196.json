Introduction Many of today’s global challenges relate to health and well-being, environmental pollution and biodiversity loss. It is particularly fascinating that plants from a botanic genus could intersect with all of these areas. From over 300 species in the genus Iris 1 2 3 4 5 Iris 6 2 7 8 9 10 Iris 11 12 There is a lack of recent work that is sufficiently comprehensive to touch on all current knowledge on this genus and reflect on its important implications. Therefore, this work invites an overview of the genus Iris, Iris Iris The aim of this work was to provide an updated and integrative review of the genus Iris examining the classical literature on the genus’s botany, cultivation and applications; assessing the phytochemical diversity and pharmacological potential, with emphasis on the most impactful applications; identifying trends and challenges in novel uses to outline future directions. 2.

In the Middle East, iris plants were depicted by artisans in famous Zarrinfam pottery from the Safavid era (XVI to XVIIIth centuries), often accompanying the poppy in a complex symbolism [ 19 Several Iris 26 Iris 17 3. Botany 3.1. General Overview At the time of writing, 313 recognized species are listed under the genus Iris 1 27 11 28 Iris 11 28 29 Its morphological and histo-anatomical aspects are key pharmacognostic features, essential for the correct identification and quality control of Iris 6 I. pallida Figure 1 3.2.

A recent study demonstrated that inoculation of I. tectorum Rhizophagus irregularis 37 I. tectorum 38 39 Irises present modified underground organs that store nutrients to ensure the perennity of the plants. Geophytic organs include rhizomes, tuberous roots and bulbs [ 28 Iris I. bucharica I. reticulata I. xiphium 40 11 I. florentina I. pallida 41 I. germanica I. pseudacorus 14 14 42 Figure 3 Iris 11 Figure 2 Iris, I. hexagona I. pseudacorus 43 44 I. pumila I. pumila 45 Iris 3.2.2.

While pollen morphology has been used in the phylogeny of Iridaceae, infrasubgeneric studies in Iris 62 I. tuberosa 27 29 I. foetidissima I. ruthenica I. unguicularis I. pseudacorus 27 28 Botanic characterization is important for identifying and classifying species, as well as for providing the required diagnostic pharmacognostic features for their safe use. Hence, this is a fundamental basis of knowledge for scientific research on this genus from both theoretical and practical perspectives. In addition, certain physiological aspects remain relevant in terms of the ecology of species, as well as for their cultivation and conservation. 4. Classification and Insights into Species 4.1. Classification of Irises Two main approaches are used to classify irises. The first is the current scientific classification, grouping them according to their morphology and phylogenetic relationships into subgenera, sections and series, which is important for botanists and breeders alike. The second is horticultural classification, which places irises into groups according to ornamental phenotypes and their purpose in garden settings, a more important approach for gardeners and the general public. However, the two approaches are not entirely separate, as the horticultural classification relies somewhat on the botanic classification.

Status of Iris Species Diversity studies and conservation measures (in situ and ex situ alike) are needed for this genus. The current trend of Iris 69 I. pseudacorus 74 Iris 75 With increasing anthropogenic activities, intensification of the geographic fragmentation of modern landscapes and extending agricultural land, gradual habitat reductions are placing unprecedented pressure on Iris Iris 76 77 78 I. bismarckiana 79 I. atrofusca 80 Iris Today, botanical gardens and seed banks act as extremely important living repositories of the collections they curate and provide the most significant support for the ex situ conservation of plant species [ 81 Iris 82 Iris 5. Cultivation 5.1. Cultivation History It cannot be ascertained with clarity when these plants became cultivated. As ancient sources mention their use, we can be sure of their familiarity, but it is not always entirely clear how these were sourced. One can speculate, as was the case for many useful plants, that, for practical reasons, people found it advantageous to have them in proximity [ 83 84 85 Early evidence suggests that during the time of Thutmosis III, iris plants were brought to Egypt from the Near East to be grown in pharaoh gardens, a fact supported by the flowers engraved on temple walls at Karnak [ 20 Oncocyclus Iris 86 I. albicans I. florentina I. trojana I. cypriana I. germanica I. junonia 14 14 23 I. germanica I. florentina 17 I. pallida 87 I. germanica I. pallida 11 In recent centuries, irises have been cultivated almost everywhere. The United States of America became a place for the extraordinary development of many ornamental cultivars known today thanks to the dedicated contribution of famous hybridizers such as Schreiner and many more who followed [ 65 The successful cultivation of these plants depends on ornamental and medicinal applications, among others. Hence, the optimization of methods across the technological chain and the adequate management of intervening factors that impact quality represent current research foci. 5.2.

Field Crops: Industrial Irises Field crops are established for industrial purposes (orris and other medicinal important species). The orris industry relies on the cultivation of certain iris species for their rhizomes: I. florentina I. germanica I. pallida 41 98 108 Iris 2 5 5 98 In Italy, with a long tradition of cultivating these plants, irises were grown as an intercrop in vineyards and olive orchards and established on narrow and steep plots of land for which mechanization is unsuitable. In these conditions, all work is usually performed by hand. Rhizome segments are planted in September at a distance of 30 cm between plants in furrows and 7–8 cm deep. In the summer of the third year, the plants are dug up entirely, and rhizomes are sold to the extraction companies as whole rhizomes, peeled or sliced [ 108 I. germanica I. pallida I. pallida; 8 108 5.5.2. Irises in the Landscape: Ornamentals Irises are an emblematic presence in the landscape of Southern Europe, where they grow in dry places such as calcareous hills and coastal slopes [ 17 114 115 Iris 17 The interest in irises from a gardening perspective remains extremely high, considered the “aristocrats” of gardens [ 115 116 114 117 I. ensata, I. pseudacorus I. sibirica I. pallida I. gracilipes 11 115 118 115 5.5.3.

Pharmacological and Immunomodulatory Potential The pharmacological and immunomodulatory effects of iris extract and compounds, as systemic biological responses, are often screened and studied in vitro on cell models or in vivo on model lab animals. Therapeutic or pharmacokinetic observations are important for moving forward in deploying effective plant-derived drugs. Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, cytotoxic and antiproliferative activities are of particular interest. One study showed that irigenin isolated from the underground plant part of I. confusa 50 180 I. florentina I. albicans 191 A rhizome extract of I. pseudaorus 50 192 I. lactea 193 I. tenuifolia 50 145 I. barnumiae 194 7.3. Remediation Applications and Outcomes The use of plants as main components in the mitigation of pollution is increasingly popular. The green technology of phytoremediation particularly focuses on the remediation of metals and metalloids [ 195 Iris I. ensata I. germanica I. halophila I. lactea I. latifolia I. pseudacorus I. sibirica I. tectorum I. wilsonii 10 I. pseudacorus 196 I. tectorum 197 37 I. pseudacorus 198 Heavy metals are not the only pollutants of current concern.

The Past, Present Future and Interconnections Between Domains There is an undeniable continuity in the knowledge and use of Iris Figure 5 Many species studied for the bioactivity of their compounds are recognized in traditional medicinal systems, while the orris industry has relied on the same species since ancient times. This positions the Iris In retrospect of the examined literature, one can summarize that the iris flower remains a strong and recognized symbol. Its cultivation retains a long-standing tradition in Europe, especially in Italy, and holds strong cultural importance. On every continent where Iris Species cultivated with well-known technology ( I. florentina I. germanica, I. pallida I. pseudacorus One may notice a change in the trend in the recent literature on this botanic genus. The older literature focused on a few species in regard to their industrial (orris), medicinal, or ornamental potential. However, recent research indicates a shift in interest that extends into biodiversity conservation and the discovery of new bioactive compounds. There is also a noticeable interest in phytoremediation and the use of Iris Iris A possible hindrance to fully benefiting from this potential resides in what is unknown regarding scaling up the cultivation of these lesser-known Iris Given that the recent literature brings evidence of new application niches for wild irises, such as unexplored microbiomes and phytochemistry, it is necessary to consider that biodiversity conservation can also support this as-yet-undiscovered potential for future applications. Wild Iris optimizing cultivation technologies to enhance the phytochemicals of interest and feasibility of Iris perfecting phytoremediation systems and preparing them for scaling-up; breeding ornamental irises able to withstand stresses, pests and diseases for low-maintenance green spaces; devising cultivation technologies for newly identified useful species; pharmacognostic standardization for more species for safe pharmaceutical use; biodiversity conservation of declining wild populations and genetic studies (genetic diversity mapping of the existing wild populations and establishing ex situ collections); effective management approaches for invasive irises. 9.
