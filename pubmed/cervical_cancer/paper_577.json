Introduction Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne Alphavirus Togaviridae 1 2 The virus was first isolated from the serum of an infected patient in Tanzania in 1952 [ 3 4 5 CHIKV infects various cell types, including dendritic cells, macrophages, synovial fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and myocytes. In humans, it infects osteoblasts, contributing to joint pathology and erosive disease in individuals with chronic arthritis [ 6 7 Berberine is a natural isoquinoline alkaloid ( Figure 1 Berberis vulgaris Coptis chinensis Hydrastis canadensis Coptidis rhizoma Xanthorhiza simplicissima Phellodendron amurense Chelidonium majus 8 9 10 11 12 13 Togaviridae 11 14 10 Emodin is a naturally occurring anthraquinone derivative ( Figure 1 15 16 17 18 19 20 However, both compounds have certain limitations, such as toxicity, poor aqueous solubility, low absorption, and limited bioavailability [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 24 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 Owing to their charge neutrality and superhydrophilic nature, zwitterionic polymers have recently been established as materials for constructing stealth nanoparticles [ 35 36 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Synthesis of Liposomes Lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Croda International Plc., Princeton, NJ, USA). Berberine chloride and emodin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and dissolved in 100% acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and used to prepare berberine-containing liposomes (LB) and emodin-containing liposomes (LE) using the lipid film hydration method ( Figure 1 In the first step, DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), DOPC (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), and cholesterol were dissolved in 10 mL of a 4:1 ethanol-to-chloroform solution and placed in an ultrasonic bath (Ecosonics, Indaiatuba, Brazil) for 15 min. Subsequently, berberine (2.68 mM) or emodin (3.70 mM) was added to the lipid solution and sonicated for 5 min. The solution was transferred to a round-bottom flask and coupled to a rotary evaporator (Büchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland) operated in a water bath at 50 °C to gradually evaporate the solvent and form a thin, homogeneous lipid film on the inner surface of the flask. In the second step, the film was placed in a desiccator (Qualividros, Passos, Brazil) for 1 h and hydrated with 10 mL of filtered ultrapure water. The flask was kept in a water bath at 50 °C and rotated at 120 rpm in a rotary evaporator (without vacuum) for 30 min. The resulting liposomal solution was transferred to a beaker and sonicated in a high-performance ultrasonic processor under the following conditions: two cycles of 2 min at 50 W. Liposomes without any incorporated compounds (EL) were also prepared using the same approach and used as controls. All liposomes were filtered through a 0.22 μm PTFE membrane (Millipore, MA, USA) and stored at 4 °C. 2.2. Liposome Characterization The samples were diluted 1:100 in ultrapure water and filtered through a 0.22 μm PTFE membrane. The hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index (PDI) of the liposomes were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) at 25 °C with a scattering angle of 173° (Zetasizer Nano ZS; Malvern PCS Instruments, Malvem, UK). The zeta potential (ζ) values were determined by electrophoretic mobility measurements performed at 25 °C. 2.3. Drug Content (DC) and Encapsulation Efficiency (EE) The concentrations of berberine and emodin in the liposomes were determined using standard calibration curves in acetonitrile. The liposomal sample (150 μL) was mixed with 150 μL of DMSO, sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min, and diluted to 2 mL with acetonitrile. UV–Vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). DC was determined by measuring the absorbance at 438 nm for berberine and 435 nm for emodin. EE was calculated using Equation (1) [ 37 g 38 39 (1) ( E E  %  =  C T − C F C T h × 100 ) C T F Th 2.4. Accelerated Stability and Shelf-Life Measurements Accelerated stability studies were performed using a LUMiSizer ® 40 2.5. Cell Lines Baby hamster kidney fibroblast cells (BHK-21, ATCC CCL-10) and human hepatocellular carcinoma epithelial cells (Huh7) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Cultilab, Campinas, SP, Brazil) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cultilab, Campinas, SP, Brazil) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). The cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 BHK-21 cells continuously expressing the non-cytotoxic subgenomic replicon CHIKV NCT (BHK-CHIKV NCT) [ 41 2 2.6. Liposome Cytotoxicity The amount of ATP in the culture is directly proportional to the number of viable cells, allowing for the estimation of cell number. The cytotoxicity of LB, LE, and EL liposomes in BHK-21 and Huh7 cells was analyzed using the CellTiter-Glo ® 4 ® 2.7. Confocal Microscopy Analysis of the Uptake of the Proposed Liposomes in BHK-21 and Huh7 Cell Lines To analyze liposome uptake in BHK-21 and Huh7 cells, liposomes containing emodin and chloroaluminum phthalocyanine (ClAlPc; Figure 1 Cellular internalization of emodin, berberine, and phthalocyanine was analyzed using confocal microscopy. For this, 10 5 ® 2.8. Virus CHIKV-NLuc is a recombinant virus derived from the CHIKV isolate LR2006OPY1, which belongs to the ECSA genotype and expresses a nanoluciferase reporter for antiviral assays. In the infectious plasmid, the cDNA of CHIKV-NLuc was controlled by the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter [ 42 To produce CHIKV-NLuc, 10 5 43 Viral titers were determined using a plaque assay based on a well-established protocol [ 43 5 2.9. Liposome Dose-Dependence Assay To analyze the dose dependence of CHIKV infection inhibition, BHK-21 and Huh7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 10 4 50 50 50 50 2.10. Investigation of the Effect of Liposomes on the Direct Inactivation of Extracellular Viral Particles (Virucidal Activity) To assess the virucidal effect of liposomes, CHIKV-Luc at an amount corresponding to an MOI of 5 was mixed with LB, LE, or EL and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The inoculum was then added to BHK-21 and Huh7 cells, which had been seeded in white 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) at a density of 10 4 2.11. Time-of-Addition Assay BHK-21 and Huh7 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10 4 2.12. Analysis of Inhibition of Viral RNA Replication BHK-21-CHIKV-NCT cells, which harbor CHIKV replicons expressing a puromycin resistance marker (Pac), Renilla 41 4 Renilla 2.13. Analysis of CHIKV Protein Expression by Western Blotting To evaluate the expression of CHIKV proteins, 10 6 Equal amounts of total protein (15 µg) per sample were denatured by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) loading buffer and then separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel. Proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with PBS containing 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal antibodies against CHIKV nsP2 or nsP3 (in-house, diluted 1:2000) and the CHIKV capsid (in-house, diluted 1:1000). Rabbit monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1:1000; 13E5; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) was used as a loading control. Following overnight incubation, the membranes were washed thrice with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. They were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted 1:2000; #31460; Thermo Scientific™, Waltham, MA, USA). Protein bands were detected using an ECL substrate and visualized using a ChemiDoc imaging system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The intensities of the bands were quantified using Image Lab software v 4.1 (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and normalized to the β-actin levels. 2.14. dsRNA Intercalation Assay A migration retardation assay adapted from Krawczyk et al. [ 44 2.15. Statistical Analysis All experiments were conducted in triplicate with three (cytotoxicity) or four (antiviral activity) technical replicates. CC 50 50 p 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Analysis of Particle Size, Polydispersity (PDI), and Zeta Potential of LB and LE Zeta potential, which reflects the surface charge of liposomes, and particle size are crucial parameters for liposome kinetic behavior and cellular uptake. All data was collected weekly over 90 days of storage at 4 °C. The average values of size, PDI, and zeta potential are presented in Table 1 Figure 2 Figure 1 It is important to note that the zeta potential observed in our study falls within the range of moderate colloidal stabilities [ 45 Generally, phospholipids such as DSPC, DOPE, and DOPC enhance bilayer stability, aid in preventing drug leakage, and play a key role in membrane fusion for cellular uptake. Cholesterol content significantly influences bilayer membrane fluidity and permeability. It not only enhances vesicle bilayer aggregation but also effectively fills gaps between phospholipids by facilitating hydroxyl head group interactions with the aqueous phase of the phospholipid membrane [ 46 47 Although the lipids used in liposome formulations are zwitterionic, the observed negative charge is consistent with the arrangement of the functional groups on the liposomal surface. This negative zeta potential may contribute to nanoparticle stability by increasing interparticle repulsion, thereby preventing aggregation [ 48 49 50 51 Both LB and LE demonstrated encapsulation efficiencies (EEs) greater than 90%, indicating a high loading capacity, a crucial characteristic for effective drug delivery systems. This high EE is likely due to the condensing effect of cholesterol, which reduces membrane permeability and enhances the retention of the encapsulated agents [ 52 53 53 54 53 54 3.2. Accelerated Stability and Shelf Life of Liposomes The accelerated stability of liposomes was assessed using the LUMiSizer ® Figure 2 55 All samples exhibited an instability index below 0.05 ( Figure 2 56 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Based on the accelerated stability analysis data, the estimated shelf life of both the empty and loaded liposomes was approximately six months. This also suggests that storage at 4 °C is the optimal condition to prevent creaming and sedimentation while maintaining functional integrity over extended periods, which is an important consideration for potential pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. These results corroborate previous studies reporting that liposomal systems exhibit long shelf life and high stability, with variations depending on the lipid composition and nature of the encapsulated active agents [ 55 57 58 3.3. Liposome Cytotoxicity Liposomes containing phospholipids with short acyl chains, such as DMPC and DLPC, have been shown to destabilize cell membranes and reduce cell viability. In contrast, Bonechi et al. (2018) reported that liposomes composed of DOPE and DOPC did not exhibit cytotoxicity at any tested concentration [ 54 59 60 Cytotoxicity analyses of LB, LE, and EL were performed in BHK-21 and Huh7 cells. The viability of cells treated with LB and LE remained above 80% at concentrations of ≤10 µM. Cells treated with EL exhibited viability greater than 80% at concentrations ≤ 20 µM. These values were similar for both cell lines and remained consistent when the treatment duration was extended from 16 h to 48 h ( Figure S1 3.4. Liposomes Uptake by BHK-21 and Huh7 Cells To investigate the cellular localization of berberine and emodin, liposomes containing berberine, ClAlPc, emodin, and ClAlPc were prepared. To investigate the cellular localization of liposomes containing these compounds, we used particles containing ClAlPc. ClAlPc ( Figure 1 61 59 61 62 Berberine and emodin are chromophores ( Figure 1 Figure 3 62 59 63 These results are consistent with reports of berberine fluorescence in HepG2 cells after 24 h of incubation at varying concentrations [ 64 65 66 63 65 Emodin cytoplasmic fluorescence was detected at all evaluated time points in both cell lines incubated with LE. However, the signal was also weak, likely due to emodin photobleaching upon exposure to UV or visible light ( Figure 3 67 68 69 70 3.5. LE and LB Inhibit CHIKV Replication in a Dose-Dependent Manner A dose-dependent assay demonstrated that LB inhibited CHIKV replication in a dose-dependent manner in both BHK-21 and Huh7 cells. In BHK-21 cells, EC 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 Figure 4 An ideal therapeutic compound should exhibit a relatively high cytotoxic concentration and a very low effective concentration. A compound or drug with an SI ≥ 10 is generally considered to have promising potential for further investigation [ 71 11 72 3.6. LB and LE Lack Virucidal Activity To evaluate the virucidal activities of LB and LE, CHIKV-NLuc was incubated with the compounds for 1 h and then used to infect BHK-21 and Huh7 cells. Treatment with EGCG, used as a positive control, significantly reduced the infectivity of CHIKV-NLuc particles compared with the vehicle control in BHK-21 ( p p Figure 5 11 72 Orthoflavivirus 48 3.7. Time-of-Addition Assays Using Berberin, Emodin, LB, and LE Time-of-addition experiments were performed to determine the stage (s) at which the compounds suppressed CHIKV replication. Liposomes containing berberine (5 µM) or emodin (10 µM), as well as the free forms of these compounds, were administered either 2 or 1 h before infection, simultaneously with infection, at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 h post-infection (hpi). EGCG (50 µM) was used as a positive control. Liposomal berberine inhibited approximately 70% of CHIKV infection in BHK-21 cells ( p p p p Figure 6 p p p p Figure 6 p p p CHIKV entry into host cells is mediated by transmembrane glycoproteins E1 and E2, which form trimeric heterodimers that bind to host cell attachment factors and receptors, including the adhesion molecule Mxra8 [ 73 74 75 20 Simultaneous application of the virus and compounds revealed that liposomes containing berberine or emodin significantly inhibited CHIKV infection compared to empty liposomes in both BHK-21 and Huh7 cells ( p p Figure 6 p One potential mechanism by which berberine and emodin inhibit CHIKV entry is by inhibiting endosomal fusion. Within endosomes, acidic pH triggers fusion between the viral envelope glycoprotein E1 and the endosomal membrane. Thus, an acidic environment is essential for internalization and fusion in CHIKV and other viruses such as ASFV [ 75 76 75 77 78 Liposomal formulations of berberine and emodin indeed significantly inhibited CHIKV replication when administered at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hpi compared to empty liposomes ( p p p p p p p p p Figure 6 p Berberine has been shown to inhibit post-entry stages of Alphavirus Orthoflavivirus 11 72 74 79 76 72 80 Although several studies have reported the antiviral activity of emodin against viruses such as the hepatitis B virus, enterovirus 71, and dengue virus [ 19 81 82 Alphavirus 3.8. Antiviral Effects of LB and LE on CHIKV RNA Replication For Alphaviruses 83 84 72 84 Renilla 41 To analyze their effect on CHIKV RNA replication, BHK-CHIKV-NCT cells were treated with compounds for 48 h. Cytotoxicity assessment revealed that these cells tolerated treatment with LB and LE at 5 µM. At this concentration, both berberine- and emodin-containing liposomes significantly inhibited CHIKV RNA replication relative to the empty liposomes, confirming that LB and LE interfere with post-entry stages of the viral infection cycle ( p p p Figure 7 p These findings are consistent with the results of the time-of-addition assays ( Figure 6 85 3.9. Analysis of CHIKV nsP2, nsP3 and Capsid Protein Expression The impact of the compounds on CHIKV protein expression in BHK-21 and Huh7 cells was analyzed using western blotting. Compared to treatment with empty liposomes, treatment with LB and LE significantly reduced nsP2 and nsP3 expression in both cell lines ( p Figure 8 p p p p p Figure 8 86 87 Alphavirus 88 89 90 91 One possible mechanism for the reduced levels of mature nsP2 is interference with nsP2-mediated cleavage of the P1234 polyprotein. This also impairs the formation of functional RCs, thereby suppressing RNA replication ( Figure 7 Alphavirus CHIKV nsP3 comprises three functional domains: a macrodomain (MD), which is involved in ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis; a conserved Alphavirus 92 92 92 CHIKV capsid protein expression was also significantly inhibited by both LB and LE compared to EL ( p p p Figure 8 p p p The Alphavirus 93 94 94 95 Figure 7 3.10. Liposome Containing Berberine or Emodin Do Not Intercalate with Double-Stranded RNA (dsRNA) To further investigate the mechanism underlying the anti-CHIKV activity of liposomes containing berberine or emodin, we assessed their ability to intercalate into dsRNA. A 350 bp dsRNA fragment corresponding to a truncated 3′ untranslated region of CHIKV was generated via in vitro transcription and strand annealing. This dsRNA was incubated with liposomes containing 5 µM berberine or 10 µM emodin, their respective free forms at equivalent concentrations, or doxorubicin, a known dsRNA intercalator. The gel retardation assay revealed that neither liposome-encapsulated berberine nor emodin, nor their free forms, exhibited intercalation into dsRNA, in contrast to the positive control, doxorubicin ( Figure 9 4. Conclusions Liposomes containing berberine or emodin inhibit chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection in cell culture and are more effective than the free forms of these compounds. The results of this study demonstrate that liposomal encapsulation of natural compounds can enhance their antiviral activity against CHIKV. Encapsulation in liposomal systems not only improves the bioavailability of these compounds but also enables a more targeted and efficient antiviral response. The compounds act at multiple stages of CHIKV infection, including post-entry phases, and are also effective in prophylactic treatment. These findings highlight the promising role of nanotechnology in developing innovative antiviral therapies, particularly for arboviruses for which no specific treatments are currently available. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms and to validate the in vivo efficacy of these liposomal formulations.
