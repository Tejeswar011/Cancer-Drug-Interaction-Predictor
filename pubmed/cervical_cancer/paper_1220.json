MDR arises through multiple mechanisms, including overexpression of efflux transporters, alterations in apoptotic pathways, and tumour microenvironment-mediated resistance. The application of nanotechnology offers a potential solution to the aforementioned challenges by facilitating the enhancement of drug solubility, stability, bioavailability, and tumour-specific delivery. Additionally, it facilitates the co-loading of agents, thereby enabling the attainment of synergistic effects. Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are naturally occurring aluminosilicate nanocarriers with unique dual-surface chemistry, allowing hydrophobic drug encapsulation in the positively charged lumen and functionalisation of the negatively charged outer surface with targeting ligands or MDR modulators. This architecture supports dual-delivery strategies, enabling simultaneous administration of phytocannabinoids and chemotherapeutics or efflux pump inhibitors to enhance intracellular retention and cytotoxicity in resistant tumour cells. HNTs offer additional advantages over conventional nanocarriers, including mechanical and chemical stability and low production cost. Phytocannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG) show multitarget anticancer activity in lung cancer models, including apoptosis induction, proliferation inhibition, and oxidative stress modulation. However, poor solubility, instability, and extensive first-pass metabolism have limited their clinical use. Encapsulation in HNTs can overcome these barriers, protect against degradation, and enable controlled, tumour-targeted release. This review examined the therapeutic potential of HNT-based phytocannabinoid delivery systems in the treatment of lung cancer, with an emphasis on improving therapeutic selectivity, which represents a promising direction for more effective and patient-friendly treatments for lung cancer. lung cancer nanocarriers halloysite nanotubes phytocannabinoids targeted drug delivery Ministry of Science and Higher Education SKN.D130.25.003 Wroclaw Medical University SUBZD.131.25.089 This research was funded by Ministry of Science and Higher Education: SKN.D130.25.003.

Introduction Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, accounting for over 1.8 million deaths each year, approximately 18% of all cancer-related deaths [ 1 2.5 2 3 4 The therapeutic approach to lung cancer is determined by its histological subtype and stage of progression. There are two major subtypes: non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which constitutes the majority of cases and allows for broader treatment options, and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which exhibits aggressive clinical behaviour and a poorer prognosis. NSCLC can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy. In contrast, SCLC is predominantly treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which often has limited efficacy and results in a poor prognosis. Significant advances have been made in recent years through the implementation of molecularly targeted therapies such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), and B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors: programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). These advances have significantly improved patient survival and quality of life [ 5 6 7 8 9 Nevertheless, the effectiveness of current oncological therapies is increasingly being hindered by the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR). This phenomenon often involves ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters, such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) and multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs), which actively expel chemotherapeutic agents from cancer cells, thereby reducing their intracellular concentrations and therapeutic efficacy [ 9 10 ® 11 Recent studies have shown that fluorofenidone (AKF-PD) significantly inhibits NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion, suppresses MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling, and reverses EMT. Importantly, AKF-PD enhances the antitumour efficacy of cisplatin while simultaneously mitigating cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. The combination of AKF-PD with cisplatin produced stronger inhibition of tumour cell growth and migration compared to either agent alone, both in NSCLC and in other cancer cell types [ 12 These mechanisms contribute to overcoming drug resistance and improving therapeutic outcomes. Furthermore, the systemic toxicity associated with conventional treatments limits the use of higher drug doses and represents a significant source of adverse effects. The development of clinical resistance and the poor selectivity of anticancer drugs highlights the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies that are more effective and less harmful to healthy tissues [ 13 14 Replacing or complementing conventional chemotherapeutic agents with phytomedicine-derived compounds, such as phytocannabinoids, is a promising strategy for overcoming certain resistance mechanisms. Cannabinoids have been shown to modulate multiple oncogenic and survival pathways, induce apoptosis, and promote oxidative stress in cancer cells, This could potentially overcome drug resistance when used as a single treatment [ 15 Furthermore, oxidative stress—defined as an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant defence system—plays a dual role in lung cancer. Chronic oxidative stress contributes to DNA damage, genomic instability, and tumour progression, while controlled induction of ROS can trigger apoptosis and inhibit tumour growth. This dual nature makes oxidative stress both a pathogenic driver and a therapeutic target, particularly in approaches combining ROS modulation with targeted delivery systems. One of the most promising avenues for anticancer treatment is nanomedicine, which uses nanocarriers to deliver therapeutic agents to specific sites. This approach increases the accumulation of active compounds within tumour sites while reducing exposure to healthy tissues, thereby minimising adverse effects. Nanocarriers such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, or clay-based nanotubes can be functionalised for active targeting and controlled release, improving pharmacokinetics and helping to overcome multidrug resistance. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current knowledge on the application of nanotechnology in the treatment of lung cancer, with particular focus on the therapeutic potential of phytocannabinoids and their integration into nanocarrier-based systems. The potential synergies between phytocannabinoids and natural nanocarriers, such as halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), may provide a new therapeutic approach to managing this deadly disease. 2. Oxidative Stress in Lung Cancer Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and the capacity of antioxidant defence systems to neutralise them. Although low to moderate levels of ROS and RNS are necessary for physiological processes such as cell signalling, gene regulation, and the defence of the host, excessive or sustained ROS production can damage cellular components, including lipids, proteins, and DNA, and it can ultimately contribute to the development of cancer [ 16 17 The lungs are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage due to their constant exposure to endogenous oxidants and exogenous sources such as air pollutants, cigarette smoke, respirable particulate matter (PM 2.5 10 17 Oxidative stress is closely linked to chronic pulmonary inflammation, which is a recognised driver of lung cancer development. Inflammatory cells, particularly macrophages and neutrophils, produce large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) via enzymatic systems such as NADPH oxidase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). This creates a highly oxidative microenvironment that can induce oxidative DNA lesions such as 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and promote genomic instability and malignant transformation [ 18 Crucially, cancer cells can adapt to elevated ROS levels by increasing the activity of endogenous antioxidant systems, such as glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and the thioredoxin (Trx) system. This adaptive shift enables tumour cells to tolerate oxidative stress and exploit ROS for pro-survival signalling and metastasis. Therapeutic strategies that disrupt this redox balance by either increasing ROS beyond the toxic threshold or inhibiting antioxidant defences have shown promise in preclinical models [ 18 19 Given its dual role in tumour biology—contributing to both cancer initiation and progression, while also serving as a potential therapeutic target—oxidative stress represents a critical mechanistic link between environmental risk factors and lung cancer pathogenesis. Targeting ROS-mediated pathways offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention, particularly through strategies that modulate redox balance. This includes the use of phytochemicals, such as cannabinoids, which can influence oxidative status by either inducing ROS-dependent cancer cell death or mitigating oxidative damage in non-malignant tissues. This could be particularly effective when phytochemicals are delivered via nanocarrier systems. Understanding the relationship between oxidative stress and the pathogenesis of lung cancer provides a foundation for designing targeted therapeutic strategies. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems can be engineered to enhance ROS generation selectively within tumour tissues or deliver antioxidant agents to protect healthy lung tissue. In this context, phytocannabinoids are an attractive option as they can modulate redox balance. 3. Nanocarriers in Anti-Cancer Therapies In recent years, a wide array of nanocarrier systems have been developed in the field of translational medicine, particularly in oncology. Among the most widely studied are lipid-based nanocarriers, including liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), both characterised by a spherical architecture formed by a phospholipid bilayer. A major advantage of these carriers lies in their ability to prolong the presence of therapeutics in systemic circulation through PEGylation, while simultaneously reducing drug-associated toxicity. Notable examples include liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil ® ® 20 21 22 22 Polymeric micelles are another important class of nanocarriers. These amphiphilic structures consist of a hydrophobic core for encapsulating poorly water-soluble drugs and a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) shell for ensuring colloidal stability and prolonged circulation. One example is Genexol-PM (micellar paclitaxel), currently under clinical investigation [ 21 22 ® 21 23 Inorganic nanocarriers, including gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs, e.g., Ferumoxide), have emerged as key components in theranostic applications. For instance, AuNPs conjugated with transferrin facilitate the transport of drugs across the blood–brain barrier, whereas SPIOs serve both as drug delivery platforms and as contrast agents in MRI imaging [ 21 Carbon-based nanostructures, such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and quantum dots (QDs), are notable for their high surface area and photothermal properties. Despite their promising diagnostic and therapeutic potential, their clinical translation is hindered by toxicity concerns [ 23 In recent developments, sophisticated multistage and organelle-targeting nanocarriers have been engineered to respond to tumour-specific microenvironmental cues, such as pH or reactive oxygen species (ROS). This enables the spatial and temporal control of drug release. Examples include pH-responsive gold–DNA nanoclusters and chondroitin-based nanomicelles designed to target the Golgi apparatus [ 24 Nanocarrier-Based Delivery Systems for Lung Cancer Treatment The development of novel therapeutic strategies has underscored the importance of nanocarriers in lung cancer treatment. While some systems are actively targeted through ligand functionalisation to enhance tumour specificity, others, such as non-targeted polymeric nanoparticles or liposomes, contribute by enabling controlled drug release, improving pharmacokinetics, and reducing systemic toxicity. Particularly significant are polymeric nanoparticles made from biocompatible materials such as polylactic acid (PLA), poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), and chitosan. These materials enable controlled drug release and are well-suited for targeted drug delivery. Polymeric nanoparticles are employed in both gene therapy and chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through active receptor-mediated targeting, via receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), transferrin, or integrins, as well as passive targeting via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This approach has been exemplified by PLGA-siRNA systems used in experimental therapies against NSCLC [ 25 Lipid-based nanocarriers, such as liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), enhance drug bioavailability and reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy through active targeting (e.g., EGFR, transferrin receptors) and passive EPR accumulation. Liposomal doxorubicin and oxaliplatin are currently under investigation for NSCLC [ 26 25 Metal-based nanoparticles, such as those composed of gold or silver, are increasingly utilised for their unique optical and photothermal properties. These nanoparticles are actively targeted via surface ligand conjugation and are primarily investigated for photothermal therapy to complement standard lung cancer treatments [ 27 Modern strategies also incorporate hybrid organic–inorganic nanocarriers, which combine the properties of metallic and polymeric systems synergistically. These hybrid platforms allow multimodal therapeutic targeting (e.g., via integrins and EGFR) and simultaneous chemo- and photothermal therapy. This enhances tumour penetration and therapeutic efficacy. Current clinical applications predominantly focus on these combinatorial therapeutic modalities [ 28 Another promising approach involves biomimetic nanocarriers, which are nanoparticles coated with membranes derived from cancer or immune cells. This phenomenon refers to the ability of membrane-coated nanoparticles to preferentially bind to cancer cells of the same type as their membrane origin, thereby enhancing selective accumulation in tumour tissue. In addition, these carriers can support immunomodulation, offering a route toward more personalised treatment regimens for lung cancer. However, challenges such as standardisation of production and potential immunogenicity remain key limitations to their applicability in practice [ 22 Furthermore, active investigations are underway into tumour microenvironment (TME)-responsive nanocarriers. These systems have been engineered to respond to pathological stimuli present within the tumours, such as reduced pH, hypoxia, or elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Enabling condition-specific drug release by TME-targeted nanocarriers has been shown to improve the precision and efficacy of therapy, supporting both immunotherapy and chemotherapy interventions [ 29 Table 1 4. Biomedical Applications of Halloysite Nanotubes in Targeted Drug Delivery The variety of nanocarrier strategies currently being investigated indicates the broad therapeutic potential of nanomedicine in the field of oncology. Alongside the substantial research conducted on lipid-, polymer-, and metal-based nanoparticles, there has been a growing focus on systems based on natural minerals. Among these, halloysite—a naturally occurring aluminosilicate with a nanotubular structure—has emerged as a promising candidate due to its abundance, high specific surface area, low toxicity, and strong drug-encapsulation capabilities. These properties place HNTs as cost-effective and efficient nanocarriers for anticancer applications. 4.1. Characteristics of Halloysite Nanotubes (HNTs) Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are naturally occurring aluminosilicate minerals with the general chemical formula Al 2 4 2 5 2 Figure 1 30 In their native form, HNTs have a high specific surface area ranging from 50 to 70 m 2 31 32 33 34 2 3 31 31 32 4.2. Applications of HNTs as Anticancer Drug Carriers A promising approach to the use of HNTs as anticancer drug carriers involves hybrid formulations using HNTs in combination with copper oxide and curcumin (CHC). In vitro studies have demonstrated their cytotoxic activity against the melanoma (HMVII) cell line, as well as liver (HepG2) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines. After 24 h, the system showed an IC 50 35 Equally promising are HNTs functionalised with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), synthesised via green methods. Green synthesis is an environmentally friendly approach to nanoparticle fabrication that uses plant extracts or other biological agents as natural reducing and stabilising compounds. This green–functionalised system demonstrated strong cytotoxicity against Jurkat T-cell leukaemia cells (IC 50 36 50 37 In the context of multidrug resistance (MDR), such targeted, stimulus-responsive delivery is particularly important, as it increases the accumulation of drugs within tumour cells that overexpress efflux pumps (e.g., P-gp, MRP1), while minimising systemic exposure and off-target effects. By releasing the drug within acidic tumour microenvironments or intracellular compartments such as endosomes and lysosomes, HNT-based systems can bypass drug efflux mechanisms and maintain cytotoxic concentrations at the target site. Systems that employ transferrin and PEG can increase tumour retention and penetration, as well as prolong circulation time, and enhance cytotoxic effects in vivo in mice relative to free DOX [ 38 39 HNTs can also be combined with bioactive carriers such as chitosan to improve stability and achieve pH-controlled release. In this dual-nanocarrier system, HNTs provide structural support and loading capacity, while chitosan improves responsiveness to acidic environments. The HNT–chitosan–khellin complex showed enhanced drug release at pH 5.5, indicating its suitability for applications requiring selective activation in acidic environments [ 40 Various HNT functionalisation strategies, such as surface chemical modifications, conjugation with targeting ligands, cytotoxic loading, and carrier support (e.g., chitosan, PEG, CuO), enable the versatile use of these nanocarriers in cancer therapy. Compared to other drug delivery systems, HNTs offer the advantages of smaller size, high chemical stability, and broad functionalisation potential, making them highly attractive for future clinical applications. 4.3. Biocompatibility and Toxicity of Halloysite Nanotubes The biological safety of HNTs is critical for their use in biomedical applications, particularly in targeted therapies and drug delivery systems. Available data suggest that HNTs are highly biocompatible across a wide concentration range and biological models. However, toxicity may vary depending on dose, exposure time, and chemical composition. Studies using mouse macrophages (Raw 264.7) showed no cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 250 µg/mL [ 41 42 43 41 44 45 42 5. Phytocannabinoids In recent years, cannabis has attracted increasing attention as a supportive therapy for cancer patients. The dried flowers and oils of Cannabis sativa 46 47 Figure 2 Over 120 phytocannabinoids have been identified, including non-psychoactive ones such as cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), and cannabichromene (CBC). These phytocannabinoids exhibit anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and neuroprotective properties but do not have the psychoactive effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) [ 48 49 Cannabis sativa 50 51 52 53 54 Interacting with the endocannabinoid system’s CB1 and CB2 receptors modulates other signalling pathways that regulate survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. Preclinical studies, including cellular and animal models, suggest that phytocannabinoids and their derivatives can inhibit tumour progression by modulating the tumour microenvironment, regulating the cell cycle, and inducing cell death [ 48 55 56 57 Despite our growing understanding of the pharmacokinetics and mechanisms of action of CBD, further research on lesser-known cannabinoids such as CBG and CBC is crucial to fully evaluate their therapeutic potential and safety [ 58 5.1. Therapeutic Applications of Phytocannabinoids in Lung Cancer Phytocannabinoids exhibit promising antitumour properties and are being investigated intensively as a potential treatment for lung cancer. Preclinical studies (using cell lines and animal models) have demonstrated their effects on proliferation, autophagy, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and cancer cell migration [ 59 60 61 59 60 61 60 62 63 64 Figure 3 65 66 67 68 Importantly, beyond their receptor-mediated effects, phytocannabinoids may contribute to overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR) by targeting tumour metabolic reprogramming, a hallmark of cancer that supports survival and progression. Cancer cells often rely on aerobic glycolysis, de novo lipid biosynthesis, and glutamine-dependent anaplerosis—processes that are tightly regulated by signalling pathways such as ROS, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), and the tumour suppressor protein p53. Phytocannabinoids have been shown to modulate these pathways, thereby disrupting the metabolic adaptability of tumour cells and sensitising them to therapeutic stress. This can limit the availability of critical nutrients and energy for resistant cancer cells, potentially restoring their susceptibility to treatment. This suggests that phytocannabinoids alone, without concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy, might suppress tumour growth by regulating energy metabolism and oncogenic signalling in combination, offering a complementary or alternative strategy to conventional drugs [ 15 Clinical reports suggest that the use of cannabinoid-based products improve the quality of life of lung cancer patients by reducing pain, improving appetite, and alleviating nausea [ 62 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 In order to capitalise on the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids in oncology, clinical applications must rely on pharmacologically characterised preparations and validated delivery devices. Ensuring such controlled conditions will allow cannabis-based therapies to be recognised as safe and effective for lung cancer patients. 5.2. Advances in Nanocarrier Systems for Cannabinoid Delivery Phytocannabinoids exhibit multifaceted biological activity, including cytotoxic, antiproliferative, pro-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory effects. This makes them promising candidates for anticancer therapy. However, their clinical application is currently limited by their poor pharmacokinetics, including low water solubility, variable bioavailability, short half-life, first-pass hepatic metabolism, and psychoactive effects in the case of THC [ 27 Encapsulation in nanocarriers can increase solubility and maintain high local concentrations at the site of administration. When administered to the lungs (the preferred method for treating lung cancer), the carriers enable the drug to be deposited deep within the lungs, allowing it to be rapidly absorbed by the epithelium and bypassing first-pass metabolism in the liver. Preclinical studies have shown that such strategies can significantly improve pharmacokinetic parameters: for example, elastic proteinoid nanoparticles increased the bioavailability of orally administered CBD by 135–170% and extended the plasma half-life from minutes to hours in rats [ 76 77 Nanoformulations such as liposomes, lipid nanoparticles, polymeric nanoparticles, emulsions, and hybrid systems improve cannabinoid solubility. They can also enable controlled, targeted delivery to tumour tissues [ 26 27 78 78 79 80 80 81 82 83 71 84 Despite the availability of encouraging preclinical data, there is still limited clinical evidence regarding nanocarrier-based cannabinoid therapy. To date, most studies have been conducted in vitro or on animal models. Therefore, although the improvements in pharmacokinetics observed in preclinical and early clinical studies are promising, further translational research and large-scale clinical trials are needed to confirm whether these enhancements can consistently be achieved in the treatment of cancer patients [ 85 6. Discussion and Perspectives: Positioning HNT-Based Phytocannabinoid Systems in Lung Cancer Therapy Nanotechnology has emerged as a transformative approach in oncology, enabling the development of targeted drug delivery systems that improve the therapeutic index and minimise systemic toxicity. In the treatment of lung cancer, where conventional chemotherapies such as taxanes and platinum derivatives are often limited by resistance mechanisms and side effects, the integration of advanced nanocarrier platforms offers a promising way forward for more effective and less harmful therapies. This review focuses on the intersection of two complementary fields: natural clay nanotubes (specifically halloysite nanotubes—HNTs) and phytocannabinoids. This novel yet under-explored strategy could be used to manage lung cancer. 6.1. The Comparative Advantages of Halloysite Nanotubes (HNTs) over Established Nanocarriers HNTs possess a distinctive combination of structural and chemical characteristics that make them uniquely suited to delivering hydrophobic and chemically sensitive agents, such as phytocannabinoids. Their naturally occurring tubular morphology provides a high aspect ratio and dual-surface chemistry, with a positively charged, alumina-rich inner lumen and a negatively charged, silica-rich outer surface [ 30 In addition, HNTs exhibit superior physicochemical stability. Unlike liposomes, which are susceptible to lipid oxidation, aggregation and premature drug leakage during storage—even when refrigerated—HNTs maintain their structural integrity over extended periods and are resistant to both chemical and enzymatic degradation in physiological environments. The synthesis of polymeric nanoparticles often involves complex multi-step processes using organic solvents, which leads to high production costs, scalability challenges and the potential generation of toxic by-products. In contrast, HNTs are inexpensive, naturally abundant, and can be processed without hazardous solvents, facilitating cost-effective, large-scale production. HNTs can tolerate standard sterilisation procedures, such as autoclaving and gamma irradiation, without compromising the stability of their cargo. This is a significant advantage for clinical manufacturing. Their outer surface can be easily modified with targeting ligands, such as antibodies, peptides, or small molecules, to improve selective accumulation in malignant tissues. These attributes collectively establish HNTs as a robust, versatile, and economically viable nanocarrier platform, offering clear advantages over other nanotechnologies for applications requiring targeted, stable and scalable drug delivery solutions. 6.2. Limitations of Other Nanotechnologies and How HNTs Address These Limitations Despite their widespread use, other nanocarrier systems have limitations that can restrict their clinical application. For example, although liposomes are effective at enhancing the bioavailability of hydrophobic agents, they have a short shelf life and are sensitive to temperature and pH fluctuations [ 86 6.3. Safety and Immunogenicity Several in vitro and in vivo studies have supported the biocompatibility of HNTs, reporting minimal activation of the complement cascade, low cytokine induction, and negligible cytotoxicity towards non-malignant cells at therapeutically relevant doses. Biodistribution studies reveal primary accumulation in the liver and spleen following intravenous administration, with gradual clearance over time [ 41 42 6.4. Clinical Translation Potential The pathway from concept to clinic for HNT/phytocannabinoid systems requires coordinated formulation optimisation, preclinical validation, and regulatory-compliant manufacturing. The first step is to achieve high encapsulation efficiency and predictable release under physiological and tumour-mimicking conditions. This should be followed by the selection of targeting ligands that are matched to biomarkers that are prevalent in specific lung cancer subtypes, such as the overexpressed CB2 receptor or EGFR variants. Lung cancer models should then be used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, tumour uptake, and therapeutic efficacy of the system, both as a monotherapy and in combination with reduced doses of standard chemotherapeutics. Comprehensive safety profiling, including repeated-dose toxicity, immunotoxicity, genotoxicity, and clearance, must be performed in parallel. Manufacturing processes must meet Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards to ensure consistency of batches, control of ligand density, and an endotoxin-free status. Although no HNT-based phytocannabinoid formulation has yet entered clinical trials, there is sufficient preclinical evidence for the individual components to justify targeted investment in translational development. 6.5. Concluding Perspective Combining the structural advantages of HNTs with the multifaceted therapeutic potential of phytocannabinoids provides a logical and creative approach to treating lung cancer. Overcoming the limitations of conventional nanocarriers and addressing the pharmacokinetic and delivery challenges of phytocannabinoids could enable HNT-based systems to improve therapeutic outcomes, reduce systemic toxicity and enhance patients’ quality of life. Future research should focus on optimising formulation parameters, validating efficacy in relevant preclinical models and establishing a robust safety profile, in order to support clinical translation. This convergence of two promising fields not only represents an unexplored research opportunity, but also a potential step forward in developing more effective, targeted, and patient-centred lung cancer therapy strategies. To date, nanotechnology research has revealed the significant potential of targeted drug delivery systems to minimise systemic toxicity in oncology, including in the treatment of lung cancer. In this context, two distinct areas of research—natural nanomaterials, such as halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), and phytocannabinoids, which have been documented to have anticancer activity—represent a logical yet currently unexplored integration point for a novel class of therapeutic systems. HNTs, with their natural tubular morphology, biocompatibility, and modifiability, have demonstrated considerable versatility as carriers of anticancer and anti-inflammatory agents. Utilising these materials to encapsulate salicylic acid, curcumin, and cisplatin has laid the groundwork for developing sustained-release systems characterised by high chemical stability. To date, no studies have been found on the direct encapsulation of phytocannabinoids within halloysite structures. However, findings from the encapsulation of essential oils, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids suggest that halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) are well-suited to such a process, from both physicochemical and pharmacological perspectives. Figure 4 Combining the anticancer potential of cannabinoids with the controlled delivery capacity of HNTs opens up new possibilities for intelligent therapeutic systems in the treatment of lung cancer. HNTs could act both as passive carriers, protecting cannabinoids from degradation, and as active targeting tools through appropriate surface functionalisation. Systems responsive to tumour microenvironment cues (e.g., pH, metalloproteinase activity) could minimise side effects further and enhance treatment efficacy. Therefore, there is a clear need for in-depth research, including the development of effective methods for incorporating cannabinoids into HNTs, assessing their stability in biological systems, and assessing their antitumour efficacy in in vitro and in vivo lung cancer models. Toxicological, pharmacokinetic, and immunological analyses will be necessary to assess the translational potential of these systems for clinical applications. In conclusion, combining cannabinoids with halloysite nanotubes is a logical and rational approach that builds on current trends in personalised oncology, but one that is underutilised. This approach could improve the efficacy of anti-cancer treatments and contribute to the development of safer, more sustainable lung cancer treatment methods.
