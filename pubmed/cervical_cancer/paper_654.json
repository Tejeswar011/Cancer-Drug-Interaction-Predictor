Unlike conventional homogeneous hydrogels, these heterogeneous systems exhibit structural and functional asymmetry, endowing them with remarkable adaptability to dynamic environmental stimuli. Their inherent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and unique “adhesion–antiadhesion” duality have demonstrated exceptional potential in biomedical applications ranging from advanced wound healing and internal tissue adhesion prevention to cardiac tissue regeneration. Furthermore, “hydrophilic–hydrophobic” Janus configurations, synergistically integrated with tunable conductivity and stimuli-responsiveness, showcase the great potential in emerging domains, including wearable biosensing, high-efficiency desalination, and humidity regulation systems. This review systematically examines contemporary synthesis strategies for Janus hydrogels using various technologies, including layer-by-layer, self-assembly, and one-pot methods. We elucidate the properties and applications of Janus hydrogels in biomedicine, environmental engineering, and soft robotics, and we emphasize recent developments in this field while projecting future trajectories and challenges.

Introduction Janus hydrogels, named after the two-faced Roman deity Janus [ 1 2 Constrained by structural and functional homogeneity, traditional single-component hydrogels struggle to meet the multifunctional demands of advanced applications. For instance, internal biomedical adhesives require simultaneous robust tissue adhesion and postoperative anti-adhesion capabilities to prevent fibrotic complications [ 3 4 5 Exploring Janus hydrogels has opened new avenues in material science, particularly in biomedical applications and environmental sustainability. Scheme 1 6 7 8 9 Furthermore, the versatility of Janus hydrogels extends to their potential use in innovative materials. By integrating stimuli-responsive components, these hydrogels can alter their properties in response to environmental triggers, such as pH, temperature, or light [ 10 11 12 In conclusion, the advancements in Janus hydrogels represent a significant leap in materials science, with implications that span multiple fields. The unique properties of these hydrogels enable innovative solutions to complex problems in medicine and environmental science. As research progresses, it is essential to continue exploring their potential through comprehensive reviews, fostering collaboration among disciplines, and prioritizing sustainability in material development. The journey of Janus hydrogels is far from over, and their future holds promise for addressing some of the most pressing challenges of our time. While existing reviews on Janus hydrogels predominantly emphasize advancements in biomedical applications, others have examined their utility within specialized domains such as postoperative anti-adhesion barriers or battery devices [ 13 14 15 16 17 Table 1 2. Types of Janus Hydrogels Janus hydrogels are a unique class of materials characterized by their anisotropic structures, which exhibit distinct properties on different sides or layers. These hydrogels are broadly categorized into two main types: double-layer Janus hydrogels and multilayer Janus hydrogels. The classification is based on the complexity and arrangement of their structural layers. In this section, we will introduce these two types of Janus hydrogels. 2.1. Double Layer Double-layer Janus hydrogels, characterized by two distinct layers with tailored chemical, physical, or mechanical properties, have emerged as versatile platforms for multifunctional applications. Their structural simplicity enables precise control over layer-specific functionalities while maintaining fabrication feasibility. Recent advances highlight diverse fabrication approaches and performance optimizations. For instance, Kai Ren et al. developed a PSAP/DXP@AgNPs double-layer hydrogel, where the Poly( N, N N,N 36 Figure 1 37 Figure 1 38 Figure 1 39 39 2.2. Multilayers Multilayer Janus hydrogels, composed of more than two layers, offer enhanced functionality and versatility. Their stratified architectures enable precise control over gradient properties (for example, stiffness, porosity, or chemical composition), making them ideal for applications requiring biomimetic interfaces or multifunctional integration. Peng et al. prepared three layers of tissue patches with asymmetric adhesion properties, the bottom layer is crosslinked by methacrylate gelatin with poly(acrylic acid)-co-poly(methacrylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimine) (p(AA-co-NHSMA)) polymer through hydrogen bonding, which can firmly adhere to the bleeding tissue and promote coagulation, the thin polylactic acid as the middle layer can increase the tensile strength of the patch by 132%, and the top layer is zwitterionic polymer coating as an anti-fouling layer to prevent postoperative tissue adhesion ( Figure 2 40 Figure 2 32 41 2 42 3. Design of Janus Hydrogels Janus hydrogels, renowned for their anisotropic structures and multifunctionality, are designed using various methods, each offering unique advantages in fabrication, control, and application. These methods can be broadly classified into several categories: layer-by-layer, one-pot, self-assembly, electrospinning, and external factor-induced techniques. Each design method offers distinct advantages, allowing researchers to tailor Janus hydrogels for specific applications in biomedicine, engineering, and beyond. In this section, we mainly introduce the design method of hydrogels. 3.1. Layer-by-Layer Method The Layer-by-Layer (LBL) method involves sequentially depositing different layers of materials to create a Janus structure. This approach enables precise control over the thickness and composition of each layer, making it suitable for applications that require well-defined interfaces, such as drug delivery systems or tissue engineering scaffolds. Castleberry et al. utilized LBL technology to combine self-assembled nanoscale coatings with RNAi, thereby protecting siRNA from degradation and continuously releasing it directly into the wound, thereby achieving rapid healing of chronic wounds [ 43 Figure 3 44 3.2. One-Pot Method The one-pot method, in contrast, simplifies the fabrication process by forming Janus hydrogels in a single step, often through phase separation or polymerization. This method is efficient and scalable, but may offer less control over layer boundaries compared to LBL. There are also methods, such as the stepwise synthesis or casting method, which can prepare Janus hydrogels with different adhesion properties. However, these methods involve multiple steps and complex operations, and thus cannot meet the requirements of simplicity, efficiency, economy, and environmental friendliness [ 45 45 46 Figure 4 47 2 2 48 3.3. Self-Assembly Method The self-assembly method utilizes the inherent characteristics of molecules or polymers to form Janus structures autonomously. This approach is particularly beneficial for fabricating intricate, hierarchical architectures with minimal external influence. Amphiphilic molecules possess the ability to self-organize into fibrous configurations. Sami Nummelin and colleagues synthesized amphiphilic Janus dendrimer macromolecules that generated self-assembled hydrogels at a remarkably low mass fraction (0.2 wt%) [ 49 50 51 52 53 3.4. Electrospinning Electrospinning is another approach that produces fibers with Janus characteristics by applying an electric field to a polymer solution. This method is promising for preparing waterproof and breathable membranes to replace those lacking porous structures and expensive membranes [ 54 Figure 3 55 56 57 58 3.5. External Factor-Induced Method The combination of two or more layers is usually unstable, with an obvious bonding problem, resulting in structural damage to Janus and affecting the integrity and function of the hydrogel. This problem can be solved using the method induced by external factors to obtain the gradient structure without an obvious interface [ 59 3 4 3 4 3 4 Figure 3 60 3 4 Figure 3 61 62 block block Figure 3 63 Figure 3 64 65 Figure 3 ( A 43 B 63 C 60 D 55 E 64 F 66 3.6. Others In addition to the above methods, there are other techniques to prepare Janus hydrogels, such as unilateral dipping, cyclic freeze–thaw, and 3D printing. A combination of chemical and physical crosslinking mechanisms for preparing Janus hydrogel is straightforward and requires no specialized equipment. For example, An et al. placed a layer of non-crosslinked gelatin in a Petri dish and then poured a gelatin/dopamine/nano-clay (GPC) hydrogel solution on top [ 67 68 69 + 70 71 72 Figure 3 38 66 Figure 4 73 Figure 4 74 Table 2 Figure 4 ( A 47 B 73 C 74 4. Desired Properties of JANUS Hydrogels The accelerated advancement of Janus hydrogels over the past ten years can be attributed primarily to the inadequacy of conventional homogeneous materials in fulfilling the demands of specific application contexts. For instance, numerous biomedical materials require enhanced capabilities to effectively respond to the intricate and dynamic physiological environments beyond the fundamental functionalities of wound adhesion and postoperative tissue protection. The unique property of Janus hydrogels is their two-sided structure, which allows them to exhibit different functions on each side. This dual function not only enables customized responses to various stimuli but also enhances their versatility in applications ranging from drug delivery systems to tissue-engineered stents. In this section, we focus on the different properties of hydrogels. 4.1. Efficient Drug Delivery Janus hydrogel excels in drug delivery due to its unique asymmetric structure, enabling controlled and sustained release. Its dual-faced composition enables tailored interactions with various drugs, thereby enhancing encapsulation efficiency and targeted delivery. This adaptability ensures optimal therapeutic outcomes with minimized side effects. Synovial fluid and tear fluid have special viscoelastic rheological properties. When there is no external pressure, they behave as viscous liquid, and, when pressure is applied, they mainly behave as elastic and prevent friction. Viscoelasticity as the Janus property provides an important guarantee for biological liquids to play their physiological functions; for example, artificial tear liposome drug delivery system can be used to relieve dry eye [ 75 76 Figure 5 77 Figure 5 78 79 Figure 5 80 4.2. Biofluid Transport Capability Janus hydrogels exhibit exceptional liquid transport properties attributed to their asymmetric architecture, which establishes distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. This structural duality facilitates directional fluid migration through wettability gradients, rendering them particularly effective for applications demanding precise liquid control and optimized fluid management. In clinical wound care scenarios, conventional hydrophilic hydrogel dressings often encounter limitations due to their inability to effectively discharge absorbed exudate. The retention of wound fluids impedes continuous drainage, elevates infection risks, and delays the healing process—a critical challenge in chronic wound management. Innovative fabrication strategies have been developed to engineer Janus-structured wound dressings with anisotropic wettability to address this limitation. Zhang et al. employed layered microfluidic spinning technology to construct Janus textiles with spatially differentiated surface properties. The resultant wettability gradient enables the active pumping of wound exudate from the hydrophobic to the hydrophobic surface, effectively maintaining optimal moisture balance while preserving wound breathability [ 81 82 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 83 Figure 6 Figure 6 83 4.3. Mechanical Performance Hydrogels have high water content, but their mechanical properties are often poor, which limits their application range. The multi-reactivity of Janus nanoparticles (JNs) can effectively improve the mechanical properties of multi-network hydrogels. Hou et al. grafted quaternary ammonium salt on one side of the nanoparticles and an amino group on the spherical side, and the R 3 + 2 84 3 + 2 44 4.4. Antibacterial Properties Infection is the leading cause of delayed postoperative repair and wound healing, which brings both physical and mental harm to patients and increases the economic burden. Huang et al. used an extrusion 3D printer to develop a Janus piezoelectric patch. The top layer of the patch is poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) loaded with piezoelectric nanocomposite material, which plays a sonodynamic antibacterial effect, and the bottom layer is methacrylate gelatin (GelMA) loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can accelerate wound healing ( Figure 7 66 85 Escherichia coli E. coli Staphylococcus aureus S. aurues Figure 7 86 4.5. Self-Adhesive Properties and Antifouling Properties Janus hydrogel exhibits exceptional self-adhesion and antifouling properties. Its asymmetric structure combines adhesive and non-adhesive faces, enabling strong bonding to various surfaces while resisting the accumulation of unwanted material. This dual functionality ensures reliable performance in diverse environments, making it ideal for applications requiring durable, contamination-resistant interfaces. A representative performance demonstration can be found in ophthalmology, where poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) hydrogels are widely used as artificial corneas but face challenges such as poor epithelialization and intraocular deposit formation due to their bio-inertness and relatively smooth surface. In order to solve the problem of poor corneal epithelialization in PHEMA. An effective strategy is to utilize the fact that PHEMA has many exposed hydroxyl groups on the surface, which can be used as the reaction site to modify PHEMA to obtain hydrogels with both anti-fouling and adhesion properties. For example, Han et al. developed a Janus PHEMA film by grafting poly(2-methacryloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide groups on both sides of PHEMA, respectively, with anti-fouling properties on one side and cell adhesion properties on the other side, which is expected to be applied in the field of ophthalmology [ 74 87 Figure 8 Figure 8 88 Figure 8 72 89 90 91 4.6. Conductive Properties Biomaterials with conductive properties can be widely used in various smart devices, such as human health monitoring. Zhang et al. developed a stretchable and highly sensitive porous conductive Janus hydrogel, which is expected to be used in intelligent monitoring devices as a high-performance strain sensor due to its controllable Janus porous structure [ 92 93 93 94 95 96 4.7. Biocompatibility Janus hydrogel exhibits excellent biocompatibility, rendering it suitable for various medical applications. Its asymmetric structure minimizes adverse reactions, while its hydrophilic and hydrophobic components support cell growth and tissue integration. This compatibility ensures safe interaction with biological systems, enhancing its potential for use in the biomedical field. Chen et al. prepared a hydrogel–Janus nanofiber scaffold (NFS) that demonstrated excellent biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo [ 44 40 4.8. Others In the clinical field of orthopaedics, most implants are made of metal; however, the internal liquid environment can corrode the implants, leading to further infection and rejection, and posing a threat to human health. Jian et al. employed one-step electrodeposition to develop a chitosan coating with a smooth and rough asymmetrical structure, which can reduce the corrosion rate of commonly used orthopaedic grafts, such as titanium and stainless steel, and has excellent application prospects in the field of implant corrosion resistance due to its simple preparation [ 97 98 5. Janus Hydrogel Applications Janus hydrogels are advanced materials characterized by their asymmetric architecture and multifunctional capabilities, demonstrating significant applicability across various fields in recent years. These hydrogels are utilized in drug delivery mechanisms, tissue engineering, and wound management in the biomedical arena due to their superior biocompatibility and regulated drug release profiles. The unique asymmetric design facilitates targeted drug administration, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes while mitigating adverse effects. In environmental science, Janus hydrogels play critical roles in water purification and ecological restoration, including the adsorption of heavy metal ions and organic contaminants. Their distinctive surface characteristics render them exceptionally effective for pollutant separation and degradation. In seawater desalination efforts, the asymmetric wettability of Janus hydrogels facilitates efficient water evaporation and salt separation, offering innovative solutions to freshwater scarcity challenges. Furthermore, these hydrogels exhibit significant utility in braking systems and wearable technologies. Their rapid responsiveness to external stimuli, such as temperature fluctuations, pH variations, and light exposure, makes them ideal candidates for soft robotics and micro-mechanical apparatus braking materials. In smart wearables, Janus hydrogels can be harnessed to create flexible sensors capable of real-time monitoring of physiological parameters (for example, heart rate, body temperature), thus providing crucial technological support for health management. The versatility and intelligent design of Janus hydrogels indicate extensive prospects for application across diverse fields. This section will elucidate the multifaceted applications of Janus hydrogels in various disciplines ( Scheme 2 5.1. Wound Healing The dressing applied to the skin wound should not only protect against infection from the external environment but also retain moisture at the wound site to optimize therapeutic outcomes. Janus hydrogel shows dual functionalities, presenting significant potential in dermatological applications. An et al. used initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) technology to coat a polyester film with a fluoropolymer film, featuring a hydrophilic carboxyl group on one side. The methacrylate gelatin, coated with growth factor, was fixed to the hydrophilic surface. The resulting Janus hydrogel exhibited good antibacterial, waterproof, and breathable properties, comparable to those of commercially available film dressings like Tegaderm, in promoting wound healing ( Figure 9 99 44 100 101 Figure 9 25 5.2. Internal Bioadhesion Traditional tissue adhesives, including surgical sutures and staples, often struggle to perform effectively in dynamic and humid internal environments, such as blood and interstitial fluid, or in the cyclical nature of cardiovascular activity [ 102 Figure 10 21 Figure 10 103 104 105 105 5.3. Gastric Perforation Repair The most common cause of gastric perforation is peptic ulcers, which can also be caused by ruptured stomach cancer and surgical procedures, and can lead to toxic shock in patients, which is life-threatening [ 106 107 22 22 108 5.4. Wearable Devices and Sensors Traditional hydrogel sensors are inconvenient to use due to the need for additional tape fixation. The strong adhesion properties of polyampholyte hydrogels can solve this problem [ 109 110 73 76 111 112 5.5. Postoperative Tumor Prevention Surgical resection is the most commonly used method for the treatment of bone tumors and malignant melanoma, but preventing postoperative recurrence and promoting postoperative tissue repair has always been an urgent clinical problem. Huang et al. designed a core–shell hydrogel bone scaffold that can release melatonin programmed. The shell was GelMA loaded with high melatonin, which is responsible for releasing high melatonin quickly in the early stage and removing residual tumor cells; the core was HAMA and F127A loaded with low melatonin concentration, which was responsible for releasing low melatonin concentration in the later stage and promoting bone repair [ 113 113 114 114 5.6. Rapid Bleeding Control Uncontrolled bleeding caused by accidents, surgeries, and diseases is one of the major causes of death. Traditional materials, such as tourniquets and gauze, are often difficult to adapt to incompressible and irregular wounds, frequently failing to achieve the desired results. Yu et al. crosslinked part of calcium ions with carboxylated chitosan (CCS), made CaCO 3 115 3 Figure 11 40 116 Figure 11 116 5.7. Cardiac Tissue Repair Myocardial infarction is a significant threat to human life and health, and many medical materials used for heart repair may cause secondary damage to the myocardium. Compared to abdominal wall and gastric perforation repair, cardiac tissue is more complex and challenging. Myocardial infarction is accompanied by the production of a large number of reactive oxygen species, which leads to further inflammation, necrosis, and fibrosis, hindering cardiac repair and regeneration. Some Janus binders have asymmetric adhesion properties, which can prevent postoperative tissue adhesion problems. However, due to the lack of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, mechanical, and electrical conductivity properties, it is difficult to achieve the function of cardiac repair. He et al. developed a Janus CPAMC/PCA cardiac patch with excellent electrical conductivity, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, biocompatible, and mechanical properties [ 39 5.8. Articular Cartilage Regeneration On one side of the articular cartilage is a soft layer that is highly hydrated to protect against sliding friction, and on the other side is a calcified area that tightly connects the cartilage to the bone. The lack of a Janus structural and functional substitute makes it challenging to apply to cartilage transplantation. Luo et al. designed a Janus hydrogel using sodium hyaluronate, chitosan, PVA, and hybrid hydroxyapatite, which exhibited a friction coefficient as low as 0.024 and showed potential for bone integration, making it a promising candidate for use as a cartilage substitute in tissue engineering [ 117 5.9. Soft Actuators Actuators are utilized in a wide range of applications, including microrobotics, healthcare, and drug delivery. However, developing intelligent actuators with fast response capabilities is still challenging. Li et al. developed a double-layer Janus actuator composed of a thermal dual-network hydrogel and elastomer, which exhibited high interface toughness and controllable shape deformation, providing a new idea for designing and applying soft electronic devices [ 118 119 120 N 121 5.10. Biomarker Detection Janus hydrogels exhibit excellent performance in biomarker detection due to their asymmetric double-sided structure. One side is highly enriched with target molecules, and the other side realizes signal conversion, significantly improving detection sensitivity and selectivity. Its multifunctional interface is compatible with various detection modes (such as electrochemical and optical) and is suitable for high-precision analysis of proteins, nucleic acids, and other markers, providing an efficient and portable new platform for early disease diagnosis and real-time monitoring. MicroRNAs, as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis, can be used to monitor a variety of diseases. However, due to the low concentrations and short lengths of microRNAs, the commonly used detection techniques have several problems, including complexity, time consumption, and high cost. Lim Jaewoo et al. developed a Janus hydrogel using a signal amplification strategy for fuel-assisted DNA cascades, achieving high sensitivity that promises to be a new technology for early cancer detection and prognostic monitoring [ 122 5.11. Personal Moisture Management Moisture management is one of the most vital criteria for evaluating functional textiles. Excessive sweat produced by the skin can cause uncomfortable sensations, such as feeling sticky and cold. Cotton fabrics have the ability to absorb sweat but cannot achieve efficient delivery of sweat, resulting in water accumulation. Dai et al. have developed a textile with both hydrophobic (polyester, PE) and superhydrophobic (nitrocellulose, NC) asymmetrically porous structures through laser drilling, maintaining the water absorption and air permeability of traditional fabrics, with a directional water transport capacity of up to 1246%, preventing the stickiness and cold caused by excessive sweat ( Figure 12 123 42 Figure 12 124 125 5.12. Smart Textile Fabrication With the change in extreme environments, people expect to adjust the temperature of the human body through clothing, and smart textiles with thermal regulation performance are a future development trend. Most of the radiation-cooled textile materials reported in the study cannot be intelligently adjusted to the appropriate temperature in response to temperature changes [ 126 127 5.13. Cosmetics Production The commonly used masks are non-woven fabrics and other materials soaked in essence. As an effective cosmetic applied to the face, the development of a spray-on paper removal mask to replace traditional masks has significant environmental benefits. Cai et al. encapsulated the bioactive substance nicotinamide with a whitening effect by the amphiphilic copolymer composed of the hydrophilic material (poly (ethylene glycol), PEG) and the hydrophobic material (poly (ethylene glycol), PLGA), and synthesized the Janus film that can be formed in situ [ 128 5.14. Solar Desalination (Solar Water Evaporation) Water scarcity poses a serious threat to human life. As a low-cost, low-energy, environmentally friendly, and sustainable freshwater production technology, solar-driven interface evaporation is a promising solution to the problem of water scarcity [ 129 130 N N 131 −2 −1 132 133 5.15. Solar Thermal Desorption Appropriate air humidity is very important for human health and machine maintenance. We typically use ventilation, heating, and condensation to achieve dehumidification, but these methods have the disadvantages of low efficiency and high energy consumption. Some hygroscopic materials, such as activated carbon and silica gel, have poor dehumidification stability and reusability. Chen et al. developed an environmentally friendly Janus-type hygroscopic hydrogel by freeze-drying and spraying lithium chloride, cellulose nanofibrils, and graphene oxide-based photothermal composites (GMC) [ 134 −2 5.16. Supercapacitors Janus hydrogel exhibits exceptional potential in supercapacitors due to its dual-functional asymmetric architecture. The conductive layer, such as polymers/graphene, enables rapid electron transfer, while the porous hydrophilic phase facilitates efficient ion diffusion. This synergy enhances energy/power density and cyclic stability. Its mechanical flexibility further supports integration into wearable electronics, offering sustainable, high-capacity energy storage solutions. Zhang et al. prepared a Janus electrode with dual conduction/pseudo-capacitance function based on Polypyrrole (PPy)-modified graphene oxide (rGO), and demonstrated the ultra-high specific capacitance of 1380 mF cm −2 −2 135 −1 −1 136 5.17. Human–Machine Interfaces Flexible wearable devices can overcome the incompatibility between traditional rigid devices and tissues, serving as a better bridge for the human–machine interface, monitoring physiological signals, and aiding in disease diagnosis. Wei et al. prepared a Janus hydrogel by using gallic acid-modified fish skin gelatin as the bottom layer and pig skin gelatin/glycerin as the top layer through sol–gel hot “welding” to form a double layer interface, which has asymmetric adhesion properties and is expected to be applied to the human–machine interface to achieve accurate measurement [ 137 5.18. Others In the field of tendon repair, Janus hydrogels have demonstrated significant advantages due to their unique asymmetric structure and multi-functional integration capabilities. Ouyang et al. successfully constructed a Janus hydrogel with temperature-adjustable properties through a one-step method [ 138 139 140 67 19 23 6. Future Outlook Although Janus hydrogels have achieved considerable progress, their broad application in biomedical, environmental science, and healthcare remains challenging. Current preparation techniques are generally more complex than conventional hydrogel cross-linking methods, often requiring high-precision instruments, strict operational procedures, and highly controlled environmental conditions. These factors increase production costs and severely limit the scalability of large-scale fabrication. Moreover, most existing methods struggle to achieve precise control over macroscopic structural features, such as interface clarity, layer thickness ratio, and geometric morphology. For instance, strategies based on external fields (for example, magnetic or centrifugal fields) are challenging to scale up and cannot meet the demands of efficient and uniform mass production. Stepwise polymerization processes are prone to interlayer molecular diffusion, leading to blurred functional regions. Additionally, bilayer structures produced by these methods often exhibit weak interfacial bonding, making them susceptible to delamination, which further restricts the practical utility of Janus hydrogels. There is also a general lack of systematic evaluation regarding the long-term stability and durability of the interfaces. The interlayer connections in Janus hydrogels typically rely on physical interactions (such as hydrogen bonding, chain entanglements) or weak chemical bonds. Under prolonged use or cyclic mechanical loading, especially in environments involving swelling/shrinking or non-uniform stress, these interfaces are at risk of peeling or slippage. Furthermore, existing preparation methods remain inadequate for handling complex-shaped substrates and large-scale expansion, and their environmental adaptability (for example, under extreme temperatures or pH conditions) requires further validation. Balancing the asymmetric properties on both sides of a Janus structure presents another significant challenge, as it is often difficult to optimize two opposing properties simultaneously. Future advances may rely on integrated multi-technology strategies, such as combining microfluidics with 3D printing, to achieve precise design and controllable fabrication of Janus structures across micro-to-macro scales. This would enable the customization of material systems with specific shapes, compositional gradients, and functional distributions. In applications with stringent optical requirements, such as contact lenses and artificial corneas, Janus hydrogels must provide dual functionality while maintaining high transparency. This demands even stricter control over microstructure and surface morphology. Although promising for preventing postoperative adhesions, challenges remain in achieving strong wet-tissue adhesion, matching the dynamic mechanical properties of organs, and enabling controllable detachment behavior. To advance clinical translation, priority should be given to the use of degradable natural raw materials with well-controlled degradation rates. The characteristic asymmetric properties of Janus hydrogels (for example, “hydrophilic–hydrophobic” and “adhesive–nonadhesive”) have demonstrated great potential in various fields, including wound dressings, anti-adhesion barriers, gastrointestinal and cardiac repair, hemostatic materials, antifouling coatings, and desalination. Nevertheless, the field is still in its early stages, requiring further expansion of application diversity and exploration of new functional paradigms. Inspired by nature, the development of intelligent Janus systems capable of responding to multiple external stimuli (for example, light, enzymes, electric fields, temperature) and performing coordinated actions such as deformation, drug release, and signal output will provide a key material platform for next-generation adaptive soft robots and precision medical devices. Another promising direction involves constructing Janus hydrogels with multiple asymmetric functions and intelligently tunable properties tailored to specific scenarios. For example, integrating sensing, actuation, drug delivery, and energy conversion into a single device could enable “perception–feedback–action” loops for applications such as smart wound dressings within closed-loop diagnostic and therapeutic systems. The design and application of Janus hydrogels represent a highly interdisciplinary research topic that integrates knowledge and methodologies from biology, medicine, physics, engineering, and computer science. Therefore, exploring synergies between Janus hydrogels and emerging advanced technologies will be a crucial direction for future research. 7.
