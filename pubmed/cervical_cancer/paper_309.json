Purpose: To report a rare case of uveal melanoma (UM) and Von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) syndrome in a patient who underwent whole exome sequencing (WES) to identify the possible genetic cause of the disease. Methods: A 54-year-old patient was referred to the eye clinic at the Rassoul Akram Hospital in 2016 due to complaints of blurry vision. In addition to UM, he later developed retinal capillary hemangioblastomas in his eye and a central nervous system hemangioblastoma. Proband had a family history of prostate cancer, breast cancer, skin cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia. After analyzing the Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of the VHL genes, no mutations were found, leading to the decision to perform WES. Results: WES disclosed a heterozygous known pathogenic nonsense variant : FCGR1A Conclusions: Our examination indicated that FCGR1A FCGR1A Central nervous system hemangioblastoma Retinal capillary hemangioblastoma Uveal melanoma Whole exome sequencing This work is supported by the Deputy for Research of the Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) and IUMS Eye Research Center, Tehran, Iran. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes I NTRODUCTION Von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) disease is a rare condition that is a dominant autosomal trait that predisposes individuals to malignant and benign tumors. The most common VHL tumors are retinal capillary hemangioblastomas (RCH) and central nervous system hemangioblastomas (CHB), clear cell renal carcinomas, pheochromocytomas (PCC), pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), and other multiple tumors or cysts of the kidney, liver, pancreas (PC), and epididymis. 1 2 3 4 Uveal melanoma (UM) is a relatively rare but deadly intraocular malignancy in adults. More than 92% of UMs contain oncogenic mutations in the alpha subunit of GNAQ GNA11 5 6 BAP1 7 8 A patient with the coexistence of both UM and VHL diseases is presented here, which are still considered to be very rare and can lead to diagnostic difficulties and impact therapeutic choices. C ASE EPORT A 54-year-old man was referred with posterior choroidal malignant melanoma of the left eye in July 2016. His pulse rate and blood pressure during the first examination were 95/min and 14/90 mmHg, and he has been followed every 2 months since then. Informed consent was obtained from the parents or guardians of all patients who participated in the study. In indirect ophthalmoscopy of the fundus, B-scan and A-scan [ Figure 1a Figure 1b Figure 1 (a) B-scan and A-scan in the initial visit showing a tumor with the size of 12 mm × 11 mm × 9.5 mm showing with high initial echo with low internal reflectivity. (b) ultrasound microscopy shows a maximum thickness of 11.99 mm Fundoscopy revealed bilateral RCH in both eyes, including multiple RCH. The diagnosis of RCHs in both eyes was supported by fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) findings [ Figure 2 Figure 2 Fluorescein angiography clearly shows multiple retinal capillary hemangioblastoma without dilation of feeder vessels In both eyes, RCH lesions smaller than 4.5 mm in diameter were treated with laser photocoagulation. For larger anterior lesions, cryotherapy was done, and complete total resection was accomplished for brain lesions. To ensure stability during the follow-up period, optical coherence tomography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, MRI, and FFA were utilized. No recurrences were reported and both globes of the patients were conserved. To exclude VHL disease, family members underwent ophthalmoscopic examination and systemic screening tests. The diagnostic criteria for VHL were considered when a first-degree relative exhibited one of the VHL-related manifestations or when a patient with no known family history of VHL presented with two such manifestations. These VHL-related manifestations included retinal capillary RCH, cerebellar or spinal cord hemangioblastoma, PCC, PNET, or an endolymphatic sac tumor. 9 Figure 3 Figure 3 Pedigree of the affected family. Color symbols represent the patients. The proband is indicated with arrows. The proband is indicated by arrowhead. Proband II-1 showed the retinal capillary hemangioblastomas, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, and uveal melanoma phenotypes. I-2 and I-3 had breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively, and died. I-5 also was affected by skin cancer. Proband’s niece (III-3) had acute myeloid leukemia and died. A positive sign (+) denotes those individuals for which variants were examined. RCH: Retinal capillary hemangioblastomas, CHB: Central nervous system hemangioblastoma, AML: Acute myeloid leukemia, BC: Breast cancer, SKCM: Skin cancer, UM: Uveal melanoma, PC: Pancreas We investigated VHL mutations in a case with UM and VHL. All three exons of the VHL gene were amplified using PCR and then sequenced using Sanger sequencing (Bioneer, South Korea) for investigation of variants and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used to investigate copy number variants, but no variants were found in the VHL gene. Finally, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES). The experimental protocol for this study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Iran University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, Iran, with the approval number of IR.IUMS.REC.1396.32903. All of the patient’s clinical information and medical histories were collected at the Rassoul Akram Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Our previous study provides a complete description of the methodologies employed [ Figure 4 9 Figure 4 Schematic workflow of whole exome sequencing. Following the Sequencing Run, the initial Row Data Processing involves the NGS read quality, alignment, and duplicate removal of sequencing data. GATK was used for Indels realignment, base calibration, variant calling, and filtering. Annotation of called variants provides the essential information required for downstream analysis and interpretation. Commonly used tools were SnpEff and ANNOVAR.

We revealed the possible role of FCGR1A The proband’s mother has not shown signs of the disease, which may be due to some phenotype variations, that could be related to factors such as modifier genes, reduced penetrance, variable expression, and environmental effects. The proband’s offspring carry a mutated gene that could lead to symptoms in the future. They should regularly screen for the occurrence of similar symptoms in the family. In recent studies, there have been several rare cases of co-occurring diseases, such as VHL syndrome and type II granular corneal dystrophy, due to mutations in the TGFBI 9 et al ATP7B 10 It is well recognized in the literature that FCGR1A (CD64) is a 72-kDa membrane glycoprotein with CD32 and CD16 receptors encodes a protein that plays an important role in the inherent and adaptive immune response. This protein is a high-affinity fc gamma receptor. FCGR1A 11 12 13 CD64 is rarely expressed in neutrophils (PMN) in normal conditions. When the body becomes infected, the expression of CD64 at the level of neutrophils can rapidly increase under the stimulation of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-12, interferon-γ, and the stimulating agent of the granulocyte colony. 14 15 FCGR1A is responsible for transcriptional misregulation and has a strong correlation with epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Moreover, RCH development is influenced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 25 26 27 28 29 30 Notably, one study has indicated that FCGR1A is a predictive marker for the diagnosis of leukemia. 31 32 In a recent study, Xu and Guo also tested FCGR1A expression levels in 33 different types of cancer using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis. According to their report, FCGR1A is strongly expressed in various types of cancer, including BC, PC, SKCM, and AML. In addition, they reported that FCGR1A was also significantly associated with cervical and endocrine cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, renal RCC carcinoma, and SKCM ( P 33 Another study by Ono et al FCGR1A 34 We conclude that this potential co-occurrence should be more taken into account when analyzing undefined or rare diseases in families during clinical and genetic evaluation. In the future, FCGR1A Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms. In the form, the patient has given his consent for his images and other clinical information to be reported in the journal. The patient understands that his name and initials will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal his identity, but anonymity cannot be guaranteed.
