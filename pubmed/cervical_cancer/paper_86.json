Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the prevalent tumors worldwide, posing a global healthcare threat. The existing treatment options for large HCC have poor therapeutic effects and are prone to drug resistance. Spatially fractionated radiation therapy (SFRT) is a highly precise radiotherapy technique that delivers a concentrated high dose of radiation to a well-defined tumor target while minimizing radiation exposure to the surrounding normal tissues. SFRT specially delivers a non-uniform radiation dose to the target area instead of a homogeneous dose throughout the tumor volume. This steep dose gradient within the targeted tumor could increase the immune-rich infiltrate within the tumor, thus enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Case report A 22-year-old man was diagnosed with large HCC, classified as Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C. The patient received first-line systemic treatment with bevacizumab and atezolizumab, followed by locoregional therapy with hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). The tumor rapidly grew over the next 2 months. Subsequently, the patient underwent SFRT combined with anti-PD1/CTLA4 (anti-programmed death 1/anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4) immunotherapy and anti-angiogenesis treatment. SFRT was administered using volumetric modulated arc therapy, delivering 26.68 Gy in two fractions every other day to the high-dose spheres and 8 Gy in two fractions to the targeted tumor. The tumor regressed nearly 40% over 2 months after the treatment, without significant treatment-related side effects (grade 3 or 4 acute and subacute toxicities) observed during the subsequent follow-up exams. Conclusion SFRT combined with immunotherapy is a promising strategy for large HCC.

The patient reported progressive right lower quadrant abdominal pain beginning in July 2024. The laboratory test results showed positive hepatitis B surface antigen, elevated hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, and a markedly increased serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP; 1,042,455.50 ng/ml), as well as abnormal prothrombin (>300,000.00 mAU/ml). A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) performed in mid-July 2024 revealed maximum axial dimensions of 12.8 cm × 7.0 cm (  Figure 1A Figure 1 Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging.

Treatment The patient received initial treatment, from July to August 2024, with two cycles of bevacizumab (15 mg kg −1 −1  Figure 1B Imaging indicated disease progression. Lattice SFRT followed by dual immunotherapy and targeted therapy were recommended to the patient after multidisciplinary review. The patient underwent a planning CT scan with contrast when a 4D-CT and an end-exhale breath-hold image were acquired. All visually identifiable gross disease was included in the gross tumor volume (GTV) (GTV_2000). A 0.5-cm isotropic expansion was used to create the planning target volume (PTV_2000), which was planned to receive 2,000 cGy in five fractions (EDQ2 ≈ 23.3 Gy). A total of 14 “spheres” with a diameter of 1.5 cm were delineated and regularly placed inside the GTV to create the lattice vertices inside the PTV, providing inhomogeneity within the tumor. Among them, 12 were nearly intact, while the remaining two were only minimally present. Their center-to-center distance and the successive axial planes of the spheres were 6.0 cm and 3.0 cm, respectively. The volume of these spheres was defined as PTV_6670 and was dosed at 1,334 cGy per fraction, with a total of five fractions (EQD2 ≈ 129.7 Gy) (  Figures 1D–G 3 3 In addition, any PTV_6670 vertices located within 1.5 cm of the organs at risk (OARs) were completely removed to limit the dose to normal tissue given any uncertainties at the time of treatment. The planning directives adhered to OAR constraints consistent with the five-fraction SBRT guidelines published in the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 101 ( 16  Table 1 Table 1 Total dose constraints over the entire treatment course (five fractions) for selected critical organs at risk.

Upon finalization of the lattice SBRT contouring and treatment planning through the MONACO treatment planning system (version 6.0), the integrity and the deliverability of the plan were rigorously assessed in accordance with the standard clinical SBRT QA protocol, which involved reviews by both physicians and physicists. The patient reported good tolerance of the treatment without significant adverse effects related to radiation. Subsequently, the patient received sequential dual immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy, which included cadonilimab (500 mg/day, intravenous infusion) and lenvatinib (8 mg/day, orally) for six cycles after SFRT, from September 26 to April 3, 2025. During this treatment course, the patient underwent transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with yttrium-90 (Y90) on January 16, 2025. Imaging re-evaluation on March 7, 2025, demonstrated that some of the intrahepatic lesions had enlarged (maximum axial dimensions of 12 cm × 7 cm) and increased significantly in number, indicating disease progression. Given the patient’s concomitant hepatic decompensation (Child–Pugh class B), intensive systemic therapy was not recommended. Accordingly, the regimen was modified to two cycles of regorafenib combined with cadonilimab from April to May 2025. The key time points of the patient’s treatment course are summarized in  Figure 2 Figure 2 Treatment timeline of the patient with advanced bulky hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Timeline depicting treatment and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from July 2024 to July 2025. It shows varying HCC sizes and medications administered, including RALOX-HAIC, SFRT, cadonilimab, Lenvatinib, yttrium-90, and Regorafenib, leading up to the patient's death. Outcomes AFP and abnormal prothrombin (PIVKA-II) are critical biomarkers in HCC, aiding in the diagnosis, monitoring the treatment response, and predicting prognosis due to their strong correlation with tumor burden and biological aggressiveness. The serum levels of AFP and PIVKA-II decreased rapidly within 2 months after SFRT (  Figures 1H, I  Figure 1C Discussion This case describes the adaptive management of advanced HCC in a young patient and the potential of the combination of salvage SFRT and immunotherapy in reversing tumor progression. The SFRT was designed to enable dose escalation within the GTV while limiting the dose to the surrounding OARs. We did not expect late significant side effects since the dose constraints were followed using an EQD2 dose summation despite the short follow-up. In the landmark IMbrave150 trial, the combination therapy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab delivered an overall response rate (ORR) of 29.8% and a 5.8-month survival benefit over sorafenib in patients with unresectable HCC ( 17 It has been proven that radiotherapy can achieve radiation-mediated immune activation through pro-inflammatory cytokines and the engagement of the innate and adaptive immunity for immunogenic tumors ( 18 20 21 22 23 However, both conventional and ablative radiation regimens homogeneously target the tumor with an additional margin, which leads to the decrease of the majority of circulating naive T cells at critical points of cross-presentation, as well as increasing toxicity to the surrounding normal organs ( 24 SFRT, a novel radiation technique, could limit the ablative doses to tumor sub-volumes, resulting in a highly heterogeneous dose deposition within the tumor. This peak-and-valley distribution of SFRT might increase the immune-rich infiltrate within the targeted tumor, leading to enhanced antigen presentation and activated T cells ( 7 25 29 It is worth noting that the combination of PD1–PDL1 inhibitors and CTLA4 inhibitors remains in the mainstream of HCC immunotherapy clinical trials. Mechanistically, PD1–PDL1 inhibition augments the antitumor activity of effector T cells, while CTLA4 inhibition can increase the infiltration of CD4 + + 30 31 In this reported case, the patient was finally administered 2,668 cGy in two fractions to PTV_6670 and 800 cGy in two fractions to PTV_2000. This fractionation scheme was determined based on the following considerations. Firstly, the uninvolved hepatic parenchyma of the patient was only 504.5 cc, and the blood test showed that the patient had abnormal liver function (AST > 10*ULN) prior to and during the course of radiotherapy. Secondly, the precision of CBCT is unsatisfactory for abdominal organs. Thirdly, the optimal SFRT dose for triggering systemic immune effects has not yet been established. Finally, our center had a relatively limited experience in the design and delivery of SFRT regimens for complex hepatic lesions, particularly in patients with compromised liver function. Thus, reducing the fraction and the dose of SFRT could be a reasonable and safe option for patients. Using MRI to guide lattice SBRT might be a promising treatment option for patients with abdominal disease. It should be noted that we recommended that the patient complete the subsequent SFRT after observing its encouraging efficacy in December. The patient declined this therapeutic regimen and opted instead for segmental TARE with Y90. It has been reported in the literature that SBRT following TARE appeared to be effective and have acceptable tolerability ( 32 This case initially adopts the SFRT technique to treat bulky HCC. Although SFRT combined with immunotherapy has shown potential for the treatment of large HCC, there is a lack of prospective multicenter clinical trials. The SFRT technology and dosimetric parameters remain diverse, and consensus on the dose prescription and technology management is required. The optimal timing and sequencing of the combination of SFRT and immunotherapy is not yet clear. Specific biomarkers for SFRT combination immunotherapy need to be further explored. Conclusion Overall, SFRT combined with immunotherapy is a promising approach for the treatment of large HCC. Nevertheless, further research is required to optimize treatment regimens, reduce adverse effects, and determine the optimum combination modality.
