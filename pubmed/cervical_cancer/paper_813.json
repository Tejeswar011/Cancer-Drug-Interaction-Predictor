Monitoring the kinetics of acetaldehyde using rodent models of alcohol misuse is essential for understanding and managing ethanol‐associated diseases. However, quantitation of acetaldehyde in biological specimens after alcohol consumption has been challenging due to its high volatility, relatively low concentrations, and strong reactivity toward biochemical molecules. It was necessary to develop and establish an accurate and high‐throughput method to quantitate acetaldehyde and ethanol. Methods Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in positive chemical ionization mode coupled with a 111‐vial headspace autosampler was employed to quantitate acetaldehyde and ethanol using 2 4 2 5 Results The method was validated and applied to quantitate acetaldehyde and ethanol in blood and tissues from multiple mouse studies on ethanol metabolism. Acetaldehyde and ethanol were well‐resolved from chromatographic interferences with linear ranges of 6.25–800 μM for acetaldehyde and 1.25–160 mM for ethanol. Both regression coefficients for calibration curves were >0.999. The within‐ and between‐run precisions for ethanol in plasma, whole blood, and serum were all <5.0%, and for acetaldehyde in plasma and serum were <9.0%, while in whole blood it was 19.2%. Sample throughput was on the order of 60 samples per 15 h daily, with a maximum of 111 per batch. Conclusions Despite some limitations, this validated method proved to be specific, accurate, and reproducible for high‐throughput quantitation of acetaldehyde and ethanol in rodent plasma, whole blood, serum, and visceral organs. Applying state‐of‐the‐art technologies and the Direct PCA Procedure, this validated method for quantifying acetaldehyde and ethanol in biological specimens was accurate, reproducible, and high throughput. It has been applied in multiple mouse studies, yielding consistent and sensitive results. Utilizing this analytical method in versatile genetically modified mouse models of alcohol misuse could facilitate important research on ethanol metabolism, supporting the idea that acetaldehyde might play a critical, previously unreported role in ethanol‐related physiologies and pathologies. direct PCA procedure plasma selected ion monitoring serum whole blood National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 10.13039/100000027 AA000368 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:25.09.2025  Lin Y.‐H.

All animal procedures followed the National Institutes of Health animal care and welfare guidelines. Animals were housed in the NIH animal facility under conventional conditions with a 12‐h light/dark cycle at a room temperature of 22°C and humidity maintained at 55%. After weaning, animals were placed on the NIH Chow diet, and diet and water were provided ad libitum. Wild‐type (WT) C57BL/6NCr mice were obtained from Charles River (Raleigh, NC) and bred in‐house. Global acetaldehyde dehydrogenase II knockout ( Aldh2 2002 2001 2015 2023 1977 2017 1972 2024 Ethanol gavage and sample collection Adult animals fasted overnight (5 pm am 2013 g 2024 g Chemicals All chemicals were of analytical reagent grade unless otherwise indicated in the text and screened for chromatographic interference by GC/MS analysis. U.S.P. 200 proof anhydrous ethyl alcohol used for administering to animals was obtained from the Warner‐Graham Company (Cockeysville, MD). Acetaldehyde‐ 2 4 2 2 6 2 2 5 2 6 2 5 The perchloric acid solution of 0.6 N, referred to as PCA0.6 N, was diluted from the purchased perchloric acid using chilled water, aliquoted, and stored at 4°C. Stock solutions of analytical standards were prepared in bulk, aliquoted, and stored at 4°C. The working solution containing internal standards, S0102, was prepared freshly by diluting known amounts of internal standard stock solutions 100‐fold in PCA0.6 N. Additionally, low‐density polyethylene terephthalate (PET) materials were excluded from the study, and the use of high‐density PET materials was limited. Newly introduced materials, such as vials and tips, were screened for acetaldehyde signals before being applied to the assay. Sample processing The sample processing procedure was referred to as the “Direct PCA Procedure.” In brief, one aliquot of solution S0102 containing PCA0.6 N and internal standards was added to one aliquot of each biospecimen and vortexed, and a portion of the supernatant after centrifugation was transferred for data acquisition in the headspace GC/MS. Perchloric acid, an oxidizing and reducing agent, was applied to denature proteins and disrupt enzyme activities based on previously reported procedures (Eriksson et al., 1977a 1977b 1982 2016 2021 1980 Liquid tissues Aliquots of frozen liquid samples (25–50 μL each) in 1.5‐mL Eppendorf tubes were thawed over ice, and to each was added 250 μL of solution S0102 containing 2 5 2 4 g Solid tissues An aliquot of frozen solid sample, approximately 15–40 mg in weight, was transferred or split from the quick‐frozen tissues during collection over a glass surface chilled by dry ice and placed into a prechilled 2.0 mL reinforced Precellys® homogenization tubes (Bertin Technologies, France) containing ceramic beads (0.4 mm each), then mixed with chilled 250 μL of solution S0102, capped, and vortexed briefly. The processed samples were kept in the ice while the remaining samples were processed. Next, 24 or fewer samples were homogenized simultaneously at 4°C using a Precellys® Evolution 24‐homogenizer coupled with a dry ice‐filled Cryolys Evolution (Bertin Technologies, France). Samples were homogenized at 5800 rpm for 25 sec twice with an intermittent pause of 20 sec and then centrifuged at 13,000 g 2024 2025 2025 A preset sequence‐guided data acquisition by GC/MS commenced after the samples were loaded onto the headspace autosampler platform. The complete method for data acquisition by headspace GC/MS is presented in the Data [Link] [Link] Instrumentation Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, headspace autosampler An Agilent 8890B GC/5977B MS system coupled with a 111‐vial 7697A headspace autosampler (Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Santa Clara, CA) was employed to quantitate acetaldehyde and ethanol using the stable isotope dilution and selected ion monitoring techniques. Prepared samples stored in 20‐mL headspace glass vials were introduced to the GC/MS through the headspace autosampler. The headspace oven temperature was set at 60°C with a loop temperature of 70°C and a transfer line temperature of 75°C. The vial was loaded and equilibrated in the autosampler, of which 1 mL of each sample in the headspace was injected into the customized GC coupled to the single quadrupole MS. The GC oven temperature was programmed to increase from 32 to 60°C at a rate of 50°C/min and then continued to 70°C at a rate of 100°C/min with a hold for 1.5 min. This was followed by a postrun of 1.5 min at 220°C. The final oven temperature rested at 100°C after each sequence was finished. The GC inlet was set at 250°C with a split ratio of 200:1 and a constant total flow of 216 mL/min for the carrier gas, helium. A fused‐silica, DB‐Select 624 ultra inert capillary column (Agilent 122‐0334 UI, 30 m × 0.25 mm ID × 1.4 μm film thickness) was used to separate the analytes of interest and introduce them into the MS. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive chemical ionization mode to detect the signal abundances of protonated ions for each analyte using methane as the reaction gas. The MS temperatures were set at 250°C for the MS ion source, 150°C for the quadrupole, and 250°C for the MSD transfer line. Data acquisition Agilent MassHunter Data Acquisition (online), version 10.0, was used to acquire the signal abundances of acetaldehyde and ethanol, along with their internal standards. Each sample run took an average of 15 min, and the daily run‐throughput routinely reached 60 samples per batch in 15 hr, with a maximum capacity of 111 for a single batch. The selected molecular ions (M +1 m z m z 2 4 m z m z 2 5 m z 1 3 FIGURE 1 Demonstration of ion chromatograms of mass‐over‐charges for acetaldehyde and ethanol and their internal standards from one mouse serum sample. The ion chromatograms were plotted with the retention time of each ion as the x y m z m z 2 4 m z m z 2 5 Calculation and data report The concentration of each analyte was determined by comparing the integrated area under the peak of the individual analyte to that of its internal standard, using the corresponding calibration curve. The responses acquired by GC/MS were analyzed batch by batch using an independent offline computer system. Agilent MassHunter Quantitative Analysis (version 10.2) coupled with Agile 2 Integrator was employed to automatically integrate the signal peaks of the selected ions, to calculate the concentrations of the analytes by batch, and to generate a result report for acetaldehyde and ethanol concentrations in biological samples. Manual integration was applied to correct and integrate the peaks of analytes that were misidentified by the auto‐integrator. Additionally, Excel for Microsoft 365 was used to conduct statistical analysis. A two‐sided, pairwise Student's t p Method validation The method was validated partially to be consistent with Shah's report (Shah et al., 2000 2018 Linearity The linearity of the method was evaluated using a calibration curve for each analyte with mouse plasma as the matrix. The calibration curves were constructed by systematically diluting known concentrations of acetaldehyde and ethanol standard solutions and adding known amounts of internal standards. The series of ethanol concentrations was 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 mM along with 0.5 μmol of internal standard, while the series of acetaldehyde concentrations was 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 μM along with 5 nmol of internal standard. The peak area ratio of ion abundance of the analyte to its internal standard was plotted against the ratio of the added amount of analyte to that of its internal standard. An R 2 Recovery The recovery was assessed at various concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde in a blank serum matrix from mice without prior exposure to ethanol. A mixture of nonlabeled acetaldehyde and ethanol standard solutions was prepared at various concentrations and mixed into 25 μL of mouse serum at 4.0, 20.0, 40.0, and 80.0 mM for ethanol, and 40, 200, 400, and 800 μM for acetaldehyde, respectively. The prepared samples were incubated on ice for 15 min and then treated the same as liquid samples, as described in the Method section. Precision, LOQ LOD Precision was expressed as a CV of ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations in plasma, whole blood, and serum determined from repeated measurements of sample replicates. Plasma, whole blood, or serum was collected at 45 min from Aldh2 The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was examined in Levels 1 and 2 of ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations in the corresponding calibration curve in mouse plasma as the matrix. The limit of detection (LOD) was examined in the diluted ethanol and acetaldehyde solutions of Level 1 in the calibration curves in mouse plasma. Method applications This method was applied to compare ethanol and acetaldehyde concentrations in three forms of blood samples: plasma, whole blood, and serum from the same animal. Adult WT or Aldh2 Additionally, the method has been applied to determine acetaldehyde and ethanol concentrations in serum, whole blood, liver, brain, and other visceral organs and tissues in multiple studies on ethanol metabolism in our laboratory since 2020.

Key factors in developing this method included the selection of stable isotope‐labeled internal standards, mass‐selected detection for all analytes, the selection of a GC capillary column, and procedural optimization. The internal standard for ethanol, a mixture of andryous 2 5 2 6 m z 2 5 Various polarities of GC capillary columns were examined to optimize the resolutions and sensitivities of analytes and to minimize column bleed. Three columns, HP‐5MS UI (Agilent 19091S‐433UI‐Key; low polarity; 30 m × 0.250 mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness), DB‐Select 624 UI (medium polarity), and DB‐WAX UI (Agilent 122‐7032UI; high polarity; 30 m × 0.250 mm ID × 0.25 μm), were examined. The medium polarity column 624 UI was selected for its optimal signal resolution between ethanol and acetaldehyde, as well as for the lowest column bleed that contributed to overall baseline noise. The factors influencing the chromatographic baseline for acetaldehyde are discussed below, along with the limitations of this method. Interferences of acetaldehyde Two main sources contributing to the rise of background noise at m z  GC One main source interfering with the acetaldehyde signal was unidentified compounds released from the stationary phase components of the GC capillary column, especially at a GC oven temperature of 80°C or higher. This column bleed caused additional irregular baselines for m z m z To minimize the baseline noise for m z Plastic consumables emission The other source of interference was introduced by PET‐made laboratory consumables. We observed that the low‐density PET‐made materials, such as containers, persistently emitted small or large amounts of acetaldehyde into the solutions. This caused a significant amount of acetaldehyde in blank control samples. For example, distilled water stored in such containers presented acetaldehyde at various concentrations, depending on the duration of the water stored in the containers (data not presented). This observation agreed with the reports in the food industry (Mutsuga et al., 2006 2020 Several approaches were applied to reduce the use of plastic materials in acetaldehyde measurement. The low‐density PET materials were eliminated from the method and replaced with glassware, Teflon‐lined, or Teflon‐made materials. The high‐density PET materials were restrained to those of necessity, such as quantitative tips for micro volumes, Eppendorf® tubes, and homogenization tubes. Any newly introduced materials were screened for background noise before being used in the experiment. If possible, leave the materials open to the air or heat them to remove the acetaldehyde, as Gee and Chaikoff reported (Gee & Chaikoff, 1926 Nonspecific enzymatic conversion Nonspecific enzymatic production of acetaldehyde from ethanol was observed in our studies when samples were processed at room temperature (data not presented). However, controlling experimental temperatures at 4°C or lower, such as quickly freezing samples on dry ice or in liquid nitrogen, storing them at −80°C, and processing them during chemical analysis at 4°C or lower minimized this artifact to between below the limit of detection and 5 μM when ethanol (160 mM) was added to the plasma matrix ( n 1977a 2 4 2 5 2 4 1980 On the other hand, we also examined the effect of thiourea on nonspecific enzymatic conversion. Thiourea was commonly used to prevent the nonspecific enzymatic conversion of acetaldehyde from ethanol in previous reports (Eriksson et al., 1977a 1980 1977 2016 Aldh S3 2021 Whole blood, plasma, and serum Whole blood, plasma, and serum are the most accessible biospecimens in animal studies and clinical trials. Our results indicated that any of the three biospecimens could be applied to determine acetaldehyde concentrations in the circulation with some variation. In mice given either 2 or 4 g of ethanol per kg BW, acetaldehyde concentrations were consistently the highest in whole blood, followed by plasma and serum in both WT and Aldh2 1973 Aldh 1977b 1987 1997 1992 2009 1992 2006 2007 1987 1992 However, analyzing acetaldehyde in whole blood needed extra attention compared to plasma and serum. Coagulated blood was not suitable for acetaldehyde assay, and acetaldehyde concentrations in whole blood showed a greater coefficient of variation than those of plasma and serum (Table 2 Quality control Quality control at each procedure was necessary to achieve accurate results, including but not limited to training researchers professionally, maintaining consistent internal standard concentrations, collecting and preparing samples at 4°C or lower, maintaining the instrument at optimal conditions, and monitoring intralaboratory results. The intralaboratory reference samples could be prepared from Aldh2 Limitations There are several constraints of the current method. First, the selected GC capillary column was not optimal for the measurement, though it yielded the least column bleed and best resolution of analytes among the three different polarity columns. The chromatographic baseline for m z m z m z Second, the instrument sensitivity decreased in our older headspace GC/MS system in recent years for unknown reasons. The system occasionally failed to achieve the required methane flow rate of 20%, which probably lowered the instrument sensitivity. A combination of the moisture built up and the presence of perchloric acid in the prepared samples might contribute partially to it. However, the perchloric acid of 0.6 N solution has been widely applied to precipitate protein in ethanol and acetaldehyde measurement (Eriksson et al., 1982 2016 The next issue was that the instrumental integrator, Agile 2, exhibited inconsistency in automatically integrating peaks below LOQ. Monitoring integration accuracy and manually integrating peaks were necessary to ensure accurate results. These obstacles increased personal biases, slowed down reporting results, reduced assay turnover rates, and increased the labor costs. Further improvements are needed in integrating instrumental data. The other issue was that the signal abundance of m z Finally, the cost of using this method was relatively high if the sample flow was low. In addition to the initial investment in personnel, laboratory space, and instruments, costs associated with operations included, but were not limited to, instrument preventive maintenance by professionals, wear and tear on the instruments, staff training, and consumables. SUMMARY With the limitations stated, this validated headspace GC/MS‐positive chemical ionization analysis proved that the quantitation of acetaldehyde and ethanol in rodent specimens was highly specific, accurate, reproducible, and high–throughput.
