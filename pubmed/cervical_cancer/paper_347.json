However, the mechanism and clinical potential of Higd-1a in colorectal cancer remains to be further studied. This study investigated the potential of antitumor mechanism and clinical potential of Higd-1a in progression in colorectal cancer. We found that overexpression of Higd-1a in HCT-8 cancer cells suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. Higd-1a overexpression induced cle-caspase-3 and cle-caspase-9 and reduced Bcl-2 expressions, while p-AKT, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 levels were significantly increased after downregulating Higd-1a in HCT-8 cancer cells. Ruxolitinib co-treatment completely enhanced the anticancer effect induced by inhibiting JAK2/AKT/STAT3 pathway in HCT-8 cells that downregulated Higd-1a. The expression rate in high Higd-1a expression group in stage I–II was considerably greater than that in stage III–IV, and Higd-1a expression and T stage were independent factors affecting the survival time of colorectal cancer. Higd-1a overexpression suppressed tumor growth in vivo and the molecular mechanisms may relate activation of apoptosis-related proteins and suppression JAK2/AKT/STAT3 pathway, and Higd-1a expression is helpful to evaluate the prognosis of colorectal cancer.

As a subunit of cytochrome C oxidase, it can catalyze the reduction of oxygen to water and plays an important role in the assembly of respiratory complex 1 2 3 4 5 6 The function of Higd-1a is mainly focused on mitochondrial metabolic pathways and oxidative phosphorylation, so the research of Higd-1a is mainly focused on metabolic diseases 1 7 9 10 7 8 2 9 11 12 Our previous studies had shown that Higd-1a was underexpressed in colorectal cancer cells and its overexpression weakened the proliferation, migration, and aggressiveness and increased apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells in vitro 13 Results Upregulation of Higd-1a suppresses tumor growth in vivo Firstly, the regulatory effect of Higd-1a overexpression on HCT-8 cells in nude mice with subcutaneously implanted tumors was verified. We injected HCT-8 cells transfected in control group (Ctrl) and Higd-1a overexpression group (Higd-1a OE) subcutaneously into nude mice (Fig. 1 1 1 1 1  Fig. 1 Higd-1a overexpression suppresses tumor growth in vivo.

( A B C D P Downregulation of Higd-1a mediated JAK2/AKT/STAT3 pathway In order to further explored Higd-1a mediated potential anti-tumor mechanism, we screened multiple potential signaling pathways that had been reported to regulate the progression of colorectal cancer. Interestingly, the Western blotting results indicated that protein levels of p-AKT, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in the downregulating Higd-1a group in HCT-8 cells were significantly increased in comparison with the control group (Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Downregulation of Higd-1a inhibited JAK2/AKT/STAT3 pathway. ( A B C D P P JAK2/AKT/STAT3 pathway is involved in Higd-1a mediated colorectal cancer progression To further validate the involvement of JAK2/AKT/STAT3 signaling in Higd-1a mediated colorectal cancer progression, janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib was applied. Interestingly, the results showed that treatment with ruxolitinib effectively reversed the decreasing Higd-1a-induced increase in cell proliferation in HCT-8 cells (Fig. 4 4 4 4  Fig. 4 JAK2/AKT/STAT3 pathway is involved in Higd-1a mediated colorectal cancer progression. After Higd-1a was knocked down in HCT-8 cells, then the cells were treatment with ruxolitinib. ( A B C D E F G P The associations between clinicopathological features and Higd-1a expression Then, we compared Higd-1a expression with the clinicopathological features of patients with colorectal cancer. The results showed that in high Higd-1a expression group, the expression rate in stage I–II was 62.26%, which was considerably greater than that in stage III–IV(34.7%). However, the high Higd-1a expression were not significantly associated with gender, age, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, nerve invasion, vascular cancer embolus (Table 1  Table 1 Analysis of associations between patient clinicopathological features and Higd-1a expression.

Cox regression model of single factor analysis and multiple-factor analysis both showed that there was significant association between the T stage/ Higd-1a level and prognosis of colorectal cancer, suggesting that Higd-1a expression( p p 2  Table 2 COX analysis of factors influencing overall survival (OS) in patients with colorectal cancer.

Our findings revealed that upregulation of Higd-1a significantly increased colorectal cancer tumor growth in vivo. Subsequent investigations in vitro revealed that this anticancer effect was primarily achieved by activation of apoptosis-related proteins and suppression JAK2/AKT/STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, our study demonstrated that Higd-1a level could be used as an independent risk factor to evaluate the prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Nowadays colorectal cancer is considered as the third most common cancer in the world. Hepatic metastases often already happen earlier before colon cancer is diagnosed because of its dormant clinical symptoms 14 14 15 16 17 18 13 Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death accompanied by the activation of endogenous apoptosis-related proteins 19 Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) is an intracellular signal transduction pathway that is widely expressed in cells. It is involved in cellular immune regulation, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis 20 21 22 23 24 25 Moreover, the expression rate in high Higd-1a expression group in stage I–II was 62.26% was considerably greater than that in stage III–IV. The detection of Higd-1a combined with postoperative pathological staging can help improve the clinical evaluation of tumors. Since TNM stage is directly related to the overall survival of tumor patients, the expression level of Higd-1a has statistical significance in different postoperative clinical stages, suggesting that the expression level of this gene is somewhat correlated with the overall survival. However, there was no significant correlation between other common clinicopathological factors (age, gender, lymph node metastasis, nerve invasion, vascular cancer embolus and depth of tumor invasion, etc.). In univariate and multivariate analysis, Higd-1a expression and T stage were an independent factor affecting the survival time of colorectal cancer, and patients with high Higd-1a expression had better prognosis. The results of our study indicate that the expression of Higd-1a in colorectal cancer tissues is significantly different in patients with different clinical stages, which has certain reference value for predicting the prognosis of colorectal cancer. In conclusion, upregulation of Higd-1a suppresses tumor growth in vivo, further investigation of the molecular mechanisms revealed that activation of apoptosis-related proteins and suppression JAK2/AKT/STAT3 pathway-related anticancer potential. Our results suggest that Higd-1a level could be used as a potential predictive biomarker to help identify novel prognosis targets for colorectal cancer. Methods Clinical sample collection A total of 125 tissue specimens stored in liquid nitrogen tanks at the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University were obtained from fresh tumors. All patients underwent radical resection of colorectal cancer and had complete pathological data and survival data. The clinical case data and follow-up data of these 125 patients were collected, including gender, age, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, nerve invasion, vascular cancer embolus and TNM staging. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University (LS2019050) and informed consent was taken from all the patients. Cell lines and culture The colorectal cancer cell lines used in this study, HCT-8 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, 20110 USA). HCT-8 was cultured in McCoy’s 5 A Medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), RPMI-1640 Medium with 10% horse serum and Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium with 10% FBS, respectively. The culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. as previously described 13 Higd-1a silencing and overexpression in HCT-8 cells The vector pCDH-EF1α-MCS-T2A-puro was purchased from Antihela BioTech (Xiamen, Fujian, China) for the preparation of the plasmid encoding the Higd-1a protein (Gene ID: 25,994) and named Higd-1a OE. 1.2 × 10 6 6 13 Nude mice subcutaneous tumor formation experiment 12 male BALB/c nude mice aged 4–6 weeks and weighing 18–20 g each from the Laboratory Animal Center, Jiangnan University, and the animal experiments were done in the animal Laboratory of Jiangnan University. In order to study the effects of Higd-1a on the development of nude mice, 12 mice were bred and raised in two groups. Each set of cells was trypsin-digested, centrifuged, counted, resuspended at a density of 4 × 10 6 Tissue staining Tumor specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently embedded in paraffin for immunohistochemical analysis. The sections, with a thickness of 5 μm, were stained using antibodies targeting Ki-67. Proteins were detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and diaminobenzidine (DAB). Apoptosis levels in the frozen tumor tissue sections were detected using immunofluorescence. Cell proliferation assay HCT-8 cells with knockdown of Higd-1a (3 × 10 3 50 Cell apoptosis analysis HCT-8 cells with knockdown of Higd-1a (2 × 10 5 13 Cell cycle assay HCT-8 cells with knockdown of Higd-1a (2 × 10 5 13 Western blot analysis Tumor tissues and cells were lysed to obtain lysates. Protein levels in the lysates were quantified using Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The blots were blocked for 1.5 h using a 5% nonfat milk/TBST solution. The PVDF membranes were treated with primary antibodies and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The proteins were detected using HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies and an ECL substrate (Bio-Rad). Protein levels were quantified using Images J software (version 1.38e). Values were normalized to those of the respective controls, as previously described 13 Statistical analysis SPSS 23.0 statistical software was used to analyze the differences between two groups throguh Mann-Whitney test and Student’s t-test (unpaired) for nonparametric and parametric data, respectively. Survival analysis was carried out by KaplanMeier method and survival curve was drawn. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using COX quadrat models. hazardratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to assess the association between Higd-1a expression level and the risk of death in patients with colorectal cancer.
