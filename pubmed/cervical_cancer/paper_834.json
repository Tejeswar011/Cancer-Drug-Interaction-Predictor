The HIBD model was constructed by Rice-Vannucci method, and the change in miR-126-3p was detected. The target genes of miR-126-3p were obtained by database (miRWalk, TargetScan, miRTarbase and miRDB) analysis. The targeting relationship between miR-126-3p and low density lipoprotein receptor related protein (LRP6) was explored based on a dual luciferase assay. miR-126-3p over- and lowexpressed, LRP6 overexpressed and protein kinase C (PKC) pathway agonist phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were injected into the brains of neonatal rats. The pathological changes in cerebral tissue and neuronal survival were observed by pathological staining. The neurological function was evaluated by foot fault test and wire suspension test. The levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were tested by an ELISA kit. The levels of miR-126-3p, LRP6 and PKC/ERK pathway proteins were tested by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Knockdown of miR-126-3p can aggravate inflammation, brain tissue pathology and neurological impairment in HIBD, while miR-126-3p overexpression can improve it. miR-126-3p can target down-regulate LRP6. miR-126-3p can improve HIBD by down-regulating LRP6 expression and activating the PKC/ERK signaling pathway. miR-126-3p can target down-regulate LRP6 by activating the PKC/ERK signaling pathway to inhibit inflammation in HIBD rats, reduce brain tissue pathology and neurological damage, and improve HIBD. miR-126-3p LPR6 PKC/ERK pathway Hypoxic-ischemic brain damage pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) is a brain nerve dysfunction attributed to asphyxia and cerebral blood flow changes caused by various factors during the perinatal period [ 1 2 4 5 6 7 8 MicroRNA (miRNA) is a non-coding small RNA that regulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The length is usually between 18–24 nucleotides. It can control gene activity, mainly by associating with downstream target gene mRNA to block its translation or degradation of mRNA, thereby inhibiting protein expression [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 The protein kinase C (PKC)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is crucial for regulating the cerebral nervous system, which is related to neurodevelopmental disorders and perinatal learning and memory disorders [ 17 18 19 20 21 Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-126-3p and the PKC/ERK pathway are associated with HIBD pathogenesis. This research investigated the impact of miR-126-3p on HIBD through HIBD rat model, screened the target genes and potential regulatory pathways of miR-126-3p, and analyzed the impact of this pathway on neuroinflammation and neurological function in order to provide new ideas and a theoretical basis for future molecular targeted therapy of HIBD based on miR-126-3p. Methods Animal grouping and processing A total of 128 7-day-old healthy Sprague-Dawley (SD) neonatal rats, weighing (12±2) g, male or female, were provided by Spyford Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Rats were fed under normal conditions (temperature 20–24 °C, relative humidity 50–70 %, light and dark 12/12 h). This experiment was approved by Puren Hospital affiliated with the Wuhan University of Science and Technology Animal Ethics Committee. All rats were randomly divided into sham operation (Sham) group, HIBD model (HI) group, miR-126-3p inhibitors negative control + HIBD (i-NC+HI) group, miR-126-3p inhibitors + HIBD (i+HI) group, miR-126-3p mimics negative control + HIBD (m-NC+HI) group, miR-126-3p mimics + HIBD (m+HI) group, miR-126-3p mimics negative control + recombinant low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) mimics negative control + HIBD (m-NC+OE-NC+HI) group, miR-126-3p mimics + LRP6 mimics negative control + HIBD (m+OE-NC+HI) group, miR-126-3p mimics + LRP6 mimics + HIBD (m+OE-LRP6+HI) group and miR-126-3p mimics + LRP6 mimics + PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) + HIBD (m+OE-LRP6+PMA+HI) group, 8 rats in each group. According to the 4 time points of 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after hypoxic-ischemic, 8 rats were randomly selected from the Sham group and the HI group at each time point for the study. The rats were sedated through inhalation of 2–3 % isoflurane. The head of the rats was fixed with a stereotactic syringe (EZ Scientific, Yizejia Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China), and the skull was exposed after disinfecting the skin of the head. According to the stereotactic map of the rats [ 22 23 2 2 Table 1 Bioinformatics analysis The potential genes of miR-126-3p were obtained by TargetScan ( https://www.targetscan.org/vert_80/ http://mirtarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/index.html http://www.mirdb.org/ http://129.206.7.150/ Double luciferase assay The 3′-UTR fragment of the potential binding site of miR-126-3p and LRP6 was cloned into the plasmid vector for transformation. Plasmids with miR-126-3p and LRP6 binding sites were designed on wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) sites. Following Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) kit, plasmid 200 ng and 30 nM miR-126-3p mimics or mimics NC were extracted and co-transfected at 37 °C for 24 h. The fluorescence intensity was tested using a dual luciferase detection system (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA). Nerve injury assessment After 14 days of injury, neurological impairment was evaluated. Following the method of Horiquini et al 24 et al 25 ELISA assay Interleukin-6 (IL-6, SEKR-0005), interleukin-1β (IL-1β, SEKR-0002), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α, SEKR-0009) ELISA kits were obtained from Solarbio (Beijing, China). After the experiment, the rat brain tissue was fully homogenized on ice, and the supernatant was gathered. IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α were tested following the operation steps. HE staining The rat brain tissue was taken, fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and then the tissue specimen was cut into 4 μm thick sections. The sections were stained with hematoxylin (C0107, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 15 min, differentiated in 1 % acidic alcohol for 30 s, rinsed with running water, and then stained with 0.5 % eosin (G1100, Solarbio) for 3 min. Then the slices were dehydrated by alcohol gradient dehydration and xylene transparent treatment, neutral gum (G8590, Solarbio) sealing, and the morphology of cerebral cortex and hippocampal C1 region neurons were observed under a microscope. Nissl staining Nissl bodies were stained by Nissl staining kit (G1434, Solarbio). The sections of brain tissue were stained with methylene blue for 10 min, and placed in differentiation medium for 1 min, treated with ammonium molybdate solution for 3 min, washing with distilled water to prevent decolorization, and mounting with neutral gum (G8590, Solarbio). The number and morphological changes of Nissl bodies in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal C1 region were observed under a microscope. Fluoro Jade C staining Fluoro Jade C (FJC) kit (TR-100-FJT, Biosensis, US) was used to detect the degeneration of hippocampal neurons. After routine dewaxing and hydration, the paraffin sections of brain tissue were immersed in potassium permanganate solution for 10 min, then stained in FJC solution for 10 min, rinsed with distilled water, dehydrated with anhydrous ethanol, transparentized with xylene for 5 min, and sealed with neutral gum. The changes in the number of degenerative neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal C1 region were observed under a microscope. Immunofluorescence The brain sections of each group were dewaxed with xylene, hydrated, and antigen repaired. The sections were blocked with 5 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5 % Triton-X100 mixed solution for 2 h. Rabbit anti-neuronal nuclei (NeuN, ab177487, 1:1000, Abcam) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with fluorescent secondary antibody goat anti-rat IgG (GB21302, 1:500, Servicebio, Wuhan, China) for 2 h. The tablet (S2110, Solarbio) was sealed, and fluorescence images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, VS200, Shinjuku, Tokyo) to observe the survival of neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal C1 region. TUNEL staining The apoptosis in cerebral cortex and hippocampus was tested by Tunel kit (C1091, Beyotime). The sections were permeabilized with 20 μg/ml protease K solution without deoxyribonuclease (DNase) for 30 min. Apoptotic cells were labeled with 50 μl Tunel solution and incubated in dark for 60 min. 4′,6-DiAmidino-2-PhenylIndole (DAPI) staining solution was employed to stain the nucleus for 5 min. The sections were sealed by an anti-fluorescence quenching solution, and Tunel positive in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal C1 region was observed by a fluorescence microscope. qRT-PCR RNA was abstracted by TransZol Up (ET111-01-V2, TRANS, Beijing, China), and then AMV reverse transcriptase (2621, TAKARA, Tokyo, Japan) was supplied for reverse transcription to obtain cDNA. Then TB Green FAST qPCR (CN830S, TAKARA) was used for the PCR reaction. The relative level of mRNA was computed by the 2 −ΔΔCt The primer sequences: miR-126-3p: F: 5′-TCTTCTGTGGGTGGACACTG-3′; R: 5′-CTTCAT-CTTCACCTTGTGGA-3′; LRP6: F: 5′-CTGAATGCT-GACAACAGGACCTG-3′; R: 5′-GACGTTCCGAAG-GCTGTGGATA-3′; U6: F: 5′-CTCGCTTCGGC-AGCACAT-3′; R: 5′-TTTGCGTGTCATCCTTGCG-3′; GAPDH: F: 5′-CATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGACTG-3′; R: 5′-ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAG-3′. Western blot After the brain tissue was collected, the samples were fully lysed by RIPA lysis buffer. The protein concentration was tested using BCA kit (PC0020, Solarbio). All samples were detached by electrophoresis, and the protein was then transferred to the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (YA1700, Solarbio). The membranes were incubated with 5 % skimmed milk powder (LP0033B, Solarbio) for 2 h, and LRP6 (ab134146, 1:1000, Abcam), PKC (ab181558, 1:2000, Abcam), p-PKC (ab109539, 1:1000, Abcam), ERK1/2 (ab184699, 1:10000, Abcam), p-ERK1/2 (ab201015, 1:1000, Abcam) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, TA-08, 1:1000, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) incubated them at 4 °C for one night. On the next day, the membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST) buffer (T1082, Solarbio) and incubated with secondary antibody (1:20000) for 1 h. After 5 times washed with TBST buffer, enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, PE0010, Solarbio) reagent was used to react for 2–3 min, and then automatic chemiluminescence imaging system was used for imaging. Statistical analysis Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times, and all data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis and image drawing were performed using GraphPad 9.0. Student’s t P Results The hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) model of neonatal rats was constructed, and miR-126-3p was lowered in HIBD rats Neuronal apoptosis, neuronal dysfunction and structural abnormalities are important pathological processes of HIBD [ 26 Fig. 1A Fig. 1B Fig. 1C Knockdown of miR-126-3p increases the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) and aggravates HIBD in neonatal rats To explore the function of miR-126-3p in HIBD, we injected miR-126-3p inhibitors into the brain by stereotactic injection. We first detected its knockdown efficiency, and it was declined ( Fig. 2A 27 Fig. 2B–D Fig. 2E–G Fig. 2H–J Fig. 2K–M Fig. 2N–P Fig. 2Q–R Fig. 2S Overexpression of miR-126-3p reduces the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines in neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) and alleviates HIBD in neonatal rats Next, we overexpressed miR-126-3p, and detected the overexpression efficiency, and it was effectively highly expressed ( Fig. 3A Fig. 3B–D Fig. 3E–G Fig. 3H–J Fig. 3K–M Fig. 3N–P Fig. 3Q–R Fig. 3S miR-126-3p can target low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) and down-regulate LRP6 expression Bioinformatics showed that the potential target of miR-126-3p was LRP6, and there were potential combining sites. The binding sequence was shown in Fig. 4A Fig. 4B–C Fig. 4D Fig. 4E–F Low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) overexpression attenuated the phenomenon that miR-126-3p overexpression reduced hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) in neonatal rats We further explored whether miR-126-3p can target LRP6 to affect HIBD. We first verified the efficiency of LRP6 overexpression, and LRP6 protein was effectively overexpressed ( Fig. 5A Fig. 5B–D Fig. 5E–G Fig. 5H–J Fig. 5K–M Fig. 5N–P Fig. 5Q–R Fig. 5S miR-126-3p inhibits hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) in neonatal rats by targeting low density lipoprotein receptor related protein 6 (LRP6) through the PKC/ERK pathway To verify whether miR-126-3p can affect HIBD through PKC/ERK signaling pathway, the experiment was divided into HIBD model (m-NC+OE-NC+HI) group, miR-126-3p overexpression (m+OE-NC+HI) group, miR-126-3p overexpression + LRP6 overexpression (m+OE-LRP6+HI) group, miR-126-3p overexpression + LRP6 overexpression + PKC activator PMA (m+OE-LRP6+PMA+HI) group. p-PKC and p-ERK1/2 protein were markedly enhanced after miR-126-3p overexpression, indicating that overexpressed miR-126-3p can activate the PKC/ERK pathway, and miR-126-3p can adjust the PKC/ERK signaling pathway; when both miR-126-3p and LRP6 were overexpressed, p-PKC and p-ERK1/2 protein up-regulation was weakened, but there were significantly elevated after the application of PMA on this basis ( Fig. 6A To confirm the effect of PKC/ERK signaling pathway on HIBD, we found that compared with m+OE-LRP6+HI group, the contents of inflammatory factors in m+OE-LRP6+PMA+HI group were notably reduced ( Fig. 6B–D Fig. 6E–G Fig.6H–J Fig. 6K–M Fig. 6N–P Fig. 6Q–R Fig. 6S Discussion HIBD caused by hypoxia and disruption of cerebral blood supply is a factor in neonatal death [ 4 28 16 29 30 The neurons after modeling were swollen and disordered, and the morphology of Nissl bodies was irregular, suggesting that the HIBD model was successfully created. miR-126-3p was notably diminished in HIBD, suggesting the potential protective effect of miR-126-3p in HIBD. miR-126 is strongly expressed in vascular-rich tissues [ 31 32 33 29 34 35 36 In this study, the potential target of miR-126-3p was LRP6 by bioinformatics, and further found that there was a potential combining site between them, so miR-126-3p could target LRP6. LRP6 levels were significantly enhanced in HIBD but declined notably after miR-126-3p overexpression, which further proved that miR-126-3p binds to LRP6, indicating that miR-126-3p targeted down-regulates LRP6. LRP6 belongs to the low density lipoprotein receptor superfamily [ 37 38 39 40 PKC is composed of the phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine kinase family, which is triggered with the second messenger diacylglycerol in a Ca 2+ 41 42 43 44 45 47 48 Conclusions This article reveals the mechanism of miR-126-3p in HIBD of neonatal rats. miR-126-3p can inhibit pro-inflammatory factors, increase the survival rate and number of neurons, increase the rate of forelimb and hindlimb fault, reduce apoptosis and forelimb strength, and protect brain tissue and nerve function. It is confirmed that miR-126-3p has a protective impact on HIBD in neonatal rats and activates the PKC/ERK signaling pathway by down-regulating LRP6. This study provides a reliable reference for the screening of targeted therapy for HIBD, and miR-126-3p is a potential target for HIBD research and may play a key role in HIBD treatment. However, there are still some limitations, and the effectiveness of miR-126-3p in clinical application needs to be further evaluated in the future. The use of miR-126-3p for therapeutic or clinical purposes may face many challenges and controversies, including the specificity of its targets, specific mechanisms, doses, etc., which require further research. The expression level of miR-126-3p and its target factor in clinical patients and their predictive value for disease severity and prognosis need to be further explored. The subsequent development of clinical drugs that affect the expression of miR-126-3p may be a new research point.
