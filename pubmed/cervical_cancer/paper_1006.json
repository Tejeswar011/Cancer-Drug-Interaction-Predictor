However, the role of TLSs in shaping antitumor immunity in HPV-induced cervical cancer (CESC) remains unclear. Therefore, we analyzed the density, composition, and prognostic impact of TLSs in patients with CESC as well as patients with HNSCC. Methods Multiplex immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and spatial transcriptomics were used to analyze TLS density and composition in HNSCC and CESC tissue sections with respect to patient prognosis. The spatial approach was supplemented by flow cytometry-based analysis of the polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell (PMN-MDSC) phenotype in freshly resected primary tumor tissues. Results Although both indications were associated with HPV infection, we confirmed a positive correlation between TLS density and improved overall survival only in patients with HNSCC. The TLS composition differed markedly between HNSCC and CESC samples, with a shift toward high regulatory T cell (Treg) and PMN-MDSC abundance in CESC samples. The highest Treg and PMN-MDSC levels were observed in patients with CESC who died of the disease. CESC-infiltrating PMN-MDSCs showed high arginase 1 expression, which correlated with diminished T-cell receptor (TCR)ζ chain expression in CESC-infiltrating T cells. Additionally, the high number of PMN-MDSCs in TLSs was associated with the absence of HPV-specific T cells in CESC. Conclusions Unlike in HNSCC, the composition of TLSs, rather than their quantity, was associated with the overall survival of patients with CESC. High numbers of Tregs and PMN-MDSCs infiltrating immature TLSs prevail in patients with CESC who succumbed to the disease and seem to affect tumor-specific immune responses.

However, the role of TLS in the cervical cancer (CESC) microenvironment has not yet been adequately elucidated. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS Compared with that in HNSCC, TLSs in CESC tissues were not associated with the overall survival of patients and showed significantly higher regulatory T cell (Treg) and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell (PMN-MDSC) densities, particularly in patients who died from the disease. CESC-infiltrating PMN-MDSC showed high expression of arginase 1, which correlated with diminished T-cell receptor ζ expression in CESC-infiltrating T cells. Importantly, high PMN-MDSC levels in CESC-derived TLSs were associated with the absence of HPV-specific CD8 + HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY High Treg and PMN-MDSC levels in TLSs should be considered potential predictive biomarkers for the responsiveness of patients with high-risk CESC to both standard-of-care and immunotherapy protocols. Background High tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte densities have been associated with good patient response to both standard-of-care protocols and immunotherapy for various solid tumors, 1 3 4 7 8 High intratumoral TLS densities generally correlate with improved clinical outcomes in different malignancies, including HNSCC. 7 9 1 3 10 11 Depending on their cellular composition and organization level, TLSs are observed in different maturation and activity states. 12 13 + 814 16 In this study, we confirmed the association between high TLS densities and improved overall survival (OS) in patients with HPV-associated HNSCC, but not with CESC. The TLS composition differed markedly between HNSCC and CESC samples, with an abundance of Tregs and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) in TLSs from CESC tissues. High densities of regulatory cells infiltrating the TLSs were mainly observed in patients who succumbed to the disease, indicating diminished TLS functionality, but not numbers, in patients with high-risk CESC. Moreover, CESC-infiltrating PMN-MDSC showed high expression of arginase 1 (Arg1), which correlated with diminished T cell receptor (TCR)ζ expression on CESC-infiltrating T cells. Interestingly, high TLS density was associated with the presence of HPV-specific T cells in the TME of patients with HNSCC, but not with CESC. However, no fully mature TLSs were present in patients with CESCs lacking detectable HPV-specific T cells in the TME. Moreover, immature TLSs in these patients were infiltrated with high numbers of PMN-MDSCs, indicating an important impact of PMN-MDSCs on the functional capacity and/or maturation of TLSs.

An experienced pathologist reviewed and classified the pathological staging of HNSCC and CESC according to the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer and the 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging classification, respectively. All procedures performed in this study adhered to the ethical standards of the Institutional and National Research Committees and the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. HPV detection Immunohistochemical analysis in HNSCC samples Antibodies against p16INK4a (Purified Mouse Anti-Human p16, Clone G175-405, BD Pharmingen, dilution 1:100) and the CINtec Histology Kit (Roche) were used. The staining intensity and proportion of stained cells were evaluated. Samples positive for p16 expression showed more than 70% positive cells and revealed nuclear and/or cytoplasmic staining. PCR HPV DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues using a MagCore Genomic DNA FFPE One-Step Kit (RBC Bioscience) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. HPV DNA was detected and genotyped by qualitative real-time PCR using the AmoyDx Human Papillomavirus Genotyping Detection Kit (Amoy Diagnostics). The test was designed for the specific amplification of the L1 gene in HPV DNA to detect and genotype 19 high-risk and 2 low-risk HPV strains (HPV 6 and 11). The sensitivity of the test is 100 HPV DNA copies per reaction. An internal control was used in the assay to test the sample quality and the presence of inhibiting factors. Immunohistochemistry FFPE sections were deparaffinized and subjected to antigen retrieval. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with BLOXALL (Vector Laboratories) and unspecific binding was blocked by 2.5% horse serum (Vector Laboratories). The sections were stained with primary antibodies against CD20 (1:400, MO755, Agilent), CD23 (1:50, 16 702 Abcam) PNAd (1:100, 120801, BioLegend), and Ki67 (1:100, Ab16667, Abcam), followed by the manifestation of enzymatic activity and staining with hematoxylin or Nuclear Fast Red (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired using a PhenoImager scanner (Akoya). Immunofluorescence Deparaffinized 2 µm FFPE sections were subjected to antigen retrieval and subsequently stained with Treg FixVUE Panel (Ultivue), where Tregs were defined as CD4 + + + − + + + − + Immune cell quantification and scoring of tertiary lymphoid structures The stained slides were stripped and re-stained with CD20 and CD23 to identify the TLSs. Following image acquisition, the slides were analyzed using HALO software (Indica Labs).

Samples were cut into fine pieces and digested with 1 mg/mL collagenase D (Roche) and 0.05 mg/mL DNase I (Roche) in RPMI 1640 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min at 37°C under a gentle rocking motion. The samples were further processed by passing through a 100 µm nylon cell strainer (BD Biosciences) and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Lonza). Single-cell suspensions were immediately stained for flow cytometry. Flow cytometry Freshly isolated single-cell suspensions were blocked with Human TruStain FcX (BioLegend), and stained in PBS+brilliant stain buffer (BD Horizon) using a panel of fluorescently labeled primary antibodies and a viability marker ( online supplemental table S2 Suppression assay Neutrophils were isolated from whole blood using the EasySep Direct Human Neutrophil Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies). Isolated neutrophils were labeled with anti-Lox1-PE mAb (BD Biosciences), and Lox1 + 5 Interferon-γ detection Cell culture supernatants were harvested after 4 days of T cells and PMN-MDSCs co-cultivation and stored at −20°C until used. Interferon (IFN)-γ was detected in the cell culture supernatants diluted 1:3 to 1:9 using a human IFN-γ ELISA kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Detection of HPV-specific T cells The detection of HPV16 E6/E7-specific T cells in HNSCC was performed as previously described. 17 5 The detection of HPV16/18 E6/E7-specific T cells in CESC was performed as previously described. 18 Xenium in situ For the Xenium analysis, 5 µm FFPE sections of two CESC and two HNSCC samples were placed on Xenium slides. Following deparaffinization and permeabilization, messenger RNA was targeted using a pre-designed Human Immuno-Oncology panel (380 genes) and an add-on custom panel (37 genes, listed in online supplemental table S3 Xenium in situ data analysis Raw image processing, segmentation, and raw count matrix generation were performed using onboard pipelines on a Xenium machine. The resulting matrices were read into a SpatialFeatureExperiment object (V.1.8.4) and processed using the Voyager package (V.1.8.1). Applied cell filtering criteria were >10% negative probe presence, <20 captured transcripts, and a minimum of five neighboring cells within 20 µm. Additional filtering was performed on the low nucleus-to-cell area distribution to remove out-of-focus cells. After filtration, the cells were log-normalized using the size factor of the cell area. AUCell (V.1.28.0) was used to identify TLS by the enrichment of a gene signature (CD3E, CXCL13, MS4A1, FCER2, and CR2). AUCell enrichment was subsequently performed on non-TLS cells using the top 20 marker genes for gated cancer cells to obtain a tumor-specific enrichment score. Stroma was defined as tissue located proximal to the identified tumor regions within the non-TLS compartment. Quality control and annotation of tissue niches are shown in online supplemental figure S3 Statistical analysis Data processing and statistical analyses were performed using R (V.4.4.2 R Core Team 2025). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the TLS densities and flow cytometry data between the indications. For other analyses, the data were winsorized using Tukey’s IQR for each indication (HNSCC and CESC) or indication and status (Remission and Exitus). Owing to the skewed distribution and small sample size of the Exitus group, bootstrap two-sample Wald statistics were used.

( A, B + – A + – B C, D C D As the number of TLSs in CESC samples with or without detectable HPV-specific T cells was comparable, we analyzed the abundance of suppressive cells, namely Tregs and PMN-MDSCs, in CESC-derived TLSs. Surprisingly, the Treg levels were not significantly different between samples with and without detectable HPV-specific T cells ( figure 6C 2 figure 6D In situ transcriptomics revealed that high expression of Treg and exhaustion-associated genes is associated with TLSs in the CESC sample To further characterize the TLS composition, we used Xenium in situ (10x Genomics) spatial transcriptomics analysis to compare representative TLS-rich HNSCC (n=2) and CESC (n=2) samples. TLSs were defined by MS4A1, CD3E, CXCL13, CR2, and FCER2 expression ( figure 7A figure 7B,C figure 7A,D Figure 7 Xenium in situ spatial transcriptomics analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and cervical cancer (CESC) samples.

Immature CESC-derived TLSs were infiltrated by high numbers of Tregs and activated Arg1-producing PMN-MDSCs, particularly in patients who succumbed to the disease. The proportion of PMN-MDSCs negatively correlated with TCRζ expression on the tumor-infiltrating T cells and the lack of HPV-specific T cells in CESC. Our findings suggest that in patients with high-risk CESC, the presence of PMN-MDSCs and Tregs within immature TLSs may impair local immune responses and hinder TLS maturation into functional germinal center-containing structures.
