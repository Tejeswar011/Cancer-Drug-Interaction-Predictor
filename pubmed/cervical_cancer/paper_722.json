Despite early-phase trials showing a limited response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), emerging evidence reveals a biologically diverse tumor immune microenvironment, with implications for the efficacy of immunotherapies. Preclinical studies highlight paradoxical associations between immune infiltration and prognosis, as well as genomic drivers—including KRAS, MYC, PI3KCA, TP53, PTEN, and ARID1A—that shape immune evasion and checkpoint ligand expression. Clinically, ICI monotherapy yields modest benefit, while combination regimens—particularly dual checkpoint blockade and targeted co-inhibition—offer improved outcomes. Biomarkers such as PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1%, ARID1A mutations, elevated tumor mutational burden, and PIK3CA alterations emerge as promising predictors of therapeutic response.

Introduction Ovarian cancer (OC) ranks as the eighth-most-common malignancy among women worldwide, representing a major global health concern. In 2020, there were an estimated 313,959 newly diagnosed cases, accounting for 1.6% of all cancers, and 207,252 deaths, making up 2.1% of cancer-related mortality among women [ 1 Within this spectrum, ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) is recognized as a rare and distinct histological subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), comprising approximately 10% of all OC cases. Characterized by unique morphological and molecular traits, OCCC exhibits a distinct clinical course compared to other EOC subtypes. A notable feature of OCCC is its geographic and ethnic variation in incidence, with significantly higher prevalence reported in East and Southeast Asian populations, ranging from 10% to 30%, compared to 5% to 12% in Western countries [ 2 3 4 5 Compared with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC)—the most common and aggressive ovarian cancer subtype—OCCC exhibits distinctive clinical characteristics. These include a younger median age at diagnosis, frequent association with endometriosis, lower response rates to chemotherapy, and specific molecular alterations [ 6 7 Most cases of OCCC are diagnosed at an early stage and are associated with relatively favorable survival outcomes. Conversely, advanced-stage OCCC presents a significant therapeutic challenge. These tumors frequently demonstrate intrinsic resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, a cornerstone of EOC treatment, which contributes to poor prognosis and limited treatment options in this setting [ 8 In light of OCCC’s chemoresistant profile and the limited efficacy of standard therapeutic regimens—particularly in advanced-stage disease—novel strategies are urgently needed. Growing evidence underscores the role of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in shaping OCCC’s behavior and therapeutic response. Recent studies have revealed immunogenic features, including AT-rich interaction domain-containing protein 1A (ARID1A) mutations, programmed death-ligand (PD-L1) expression, and CD8 + 9 10 9 10 2. PD-L1 Expression in Clear Cell Ovarian Carcinoma PD-L1 is a transmembrane protein that plays a pivotal role in tumor immune evasion. By binding to its receptor PD-1 on activated T cells, PD-L1 transmits inhibitory signals that suppress T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity. This interaction contributes to the establishment of an immunosuppressive TIME, allowing malignant cells to escape immune surveillance. Elevated PD-L1 expression has been observed across various cancer types, including non-small cell lung carcinoma, cervical cancer, melanoma, as well as OCCC. It is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to conventional therapies [ 11 12 13 14 15 To gain a deeper understanding of immune cell infiltration and checkpoint dynamics in OCCC, a multiplex immunohistochemistry analysis was conducted in Canada on 162 tumor specimens. Antibodies were sourced from Biocare Medical (Pacheco, CA, USA) and distributed by Inter Medico (Markham, ON, Canada). This comprehensive profiling quantified various immune populations—including pan-T (CD3 + + + − + + + + + + + + 16 Further evidence from a retrospective analysis of 125 cases in Japan reinforced the prognostic relevance of PD-L1. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed PD-L1 positivity in 86.4% of patients’ evaluation (antibody clone E1L3N, cut-off 5%), with expression significantly associated with diminished chemotherapy response and reduced progression-free (PFS) and OS. Notably, PD-L1 retained independent prognostic value after adjusting for clinical covariates and showed no association with TIL density or mismatch repair MMR status, supporting its role as a standalone biomarker [ 17 Additional insights emerged from a Chinese cohort of 152 OCCC patients, where paired analyses across primary, recurrent, and metastatic lesions illuminated the dynamic nature of PD-L1 expression using the 22C3 pharmDx assay. Positivity rates were varied by scoring system—22.4% with tumor proportion score (TPS, cut-off 1%) and 38.8% with combined positive score (CPS), with 21.7% surpassing a high-expression threshold (CPS ≥ 10). Crucially, PD-L1 expression was sustained or elevated in recurrent lesions and associated with platinum resistance and aggressive clinicopathological features, including advanced FIGO stage and distant metastasis. These findings support PD-L1 as both a prognostic and predictive biomarker, especially with CPS scoring. Recurrent and metastatic lesions proved suitable for PD-L1 assessment, while lymphatic metastases were deemed unreliable [ 18 Exploring spatial immune architecture, comparative evaluation of tumor and adjacent nonneoplastic tissues in 18 OCCC Chinese patients revealed divergent immune marker distribution. For the determination of PD-L1, (1:500, Servicebio, GB11339) was used; positivity was considered with CPS ≥ 1. While PD-1 and PD-L1 lacked prognostic relevance in either compartment, CD8 + 2 + 19 Finally, an integrated clinicopathologic analysis of 76 OCCC cases in Taiwan examined interactions among PD-L1 expression, CD8 + + + + + 20 Complementing these findings, a separate retrospective investigation spanning 46 paraffin-embedded specimens of pure ovarian and uterine CCCs assessed PD-1-associated TILs, PD-L1 positivity, and CPS alongside clinical staging, endometriosis history, and survival data. For PD-L1 staining, Ventana SP263 rabbit monoclonal antibody was used; positivity of PD-L1 was considered for CPS ≥ 1. Most cases presented at FIGO stage I/II (63.0%) [ 21 + p p p 21 Recent studies have begun to shed light on the immunogenomic interplay between MMR deficiency and PD-L1 expression in OCCC. In one immunohistochemical analysis involving 28 cases in Iran, researchers examined PD-L1 expression both within tumor cells and the surrounding peritumoral inflammatory infiltrate, alongside MMR status determined through MSH6 and PMS2 markers. PD-L1 positivity (evaluated using Rabbit Anti-Human Monoclonal Antibody (clone SBC-992, Sina Biotech and defined as expression above 1% in tumor cells and over 5% in inflammatory cells)) was detected in 57.15% and 39.28% of cases, respectively. Of the four OCCC samples with MMR deficiency, three also expressed PD-L1, suggesting a possible link between defective DNA repair and a more immunogenic tumor profile. One case showed strong PD-L1 positivity (>50%) in tumor cells, along with complete loss of MSH6 and MSH2 expression [ 22 Emerging evidence points toward the existence of a biologically distinct subset of OCCCs that exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI). Unlike the broader OCCC population—typically resistant to conventional chemotherapy—MSI-positive tumors appear markedly more immunogenic. A study performed in the USA on 30 OCCC has shown these tumors to be densely infiltrated by CD8 and PD-1 positive T cells, alongside consistent PD-L1 expression (evaluated with E1L3N clone, the positivity was defined as greater than or equal to 5% of tumor cells with PD-L1 positivity) across both neoplastic and immune compartments. This sets them apart not only from microsatellite-stable OCCC but also from HGSOCs, which generally display a less-activated immune profile [ 23 23 Figure 1 3. Genes and Pathways Related to Tumor Immune Microenvironment Activation of oncogenes, such as MYC, RAS, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, including TP53, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and ARID1A, contributes to TIME. These genetic alterations modulate immune cell infiltration and function by affecting cytokine signaling, antigen presentation, and interferon (IFN) pathways [ 24 3.1. KRAS and MYC Oncogenic KRAS plays a pivotal role in immune evasion by driving the upregulation of key immune checkpoint ligands, notably PD-L1 and CD47, on the surface of tumor cells. This molecular profile is associated with the upregulation of exhaustion markers—PD-1, Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated Protein 4 (CTLA-4), and TIM-3—on T cells, ultimately impairing their cytotoxic function and promoting immune evasion by the tumor [ 25 + + 25 25 + 25 26 27 28 29 30 Figure 2 3.2. PI3K Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation orchestrates key intracellular signaling events that regulate immune cell survival, metabolism, and differentiation. In immune contexts, PI3K signaling—particularly via the Akt/mTOR axis—enhances the stability and suppressive function of Tregs by promoting Foxp3 expression and metabolic regulations [ 31 32 33 31 33 32 33 34 35 The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade is frequently hyperactivated in OCCC, driving tumor cell survival, unchecked proliferation, and extensive metabolic reprogramming by regulating lipogenesis and glucose metabolism [ 36 37 38 39 40 40 41 Figure 3 3.3. P53 The tumor suppressor gene TP53, commonly referred to as p53, plays a pivotal role in safeguarding genome integrity by regulating DNA replication stress and coordinating DNA repair mechanisms [ 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 + + + 50 50 50 50 51 51 51 51 51 52 52 HGSOC is characterized by an exceptionally high frequency of TP53 mutations, present in over 95% of cases [ 53 53 54 Regarding OCCC, TP53 55 56 57 58 57 59 60 61 61 Figure 4 3.4. PTEN Somatic loss or inactivation of PTEN leads to aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which governs cellular proliferation, survival, and metabolic processes [ 24 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 In preclinical models of various cancer types, loss of PTEN leads to the accumulation of immunoregulatory cells—including MDSCs, Tregs, and M2-polarized macrophages—which collectively inhibit cytotoxic immune activity [ 70 70 70 70 71 + VEGFA PIK3CA PIK3CB 71 71 Regarding OCCC, approximately 40% of these tumors harbor mutations or deletions affecting the PTEN 72 73 74 + 75 + p + p p p p p + + p 75 + p 76 + 75 76 p 76 Figure 5 3.5. ARID1A ARID1A, encoded by the ARID1A 77 Within the cBAF complex, DNA binding is mediated through either ARID1A or its mutually exclusive paralog ARID1B [ 78 79 79 ARID1A mutations are present in approximately 30–57% of OCCC, typically manifesting as nonsense or frameshift deletions that produce truncated, non-functional protein products [ 80 81 82 83 + p p 83 + Beyond surface markers, ARID1A-mutated tumors exhibit baseline immune activation, characterized by enrichment of CXCL13 + + + 84 84 84 Spatial and immunophenotypic characterization of OCCC biopsies from 45 patients (early vs. advanced FIGO stages) further underscores the complexity of the TIME [ 85 + + + + 85 Figure 6 4. Natural Killer Cell Impairment NK cell dysfunction was characterized in patients with chemoresistant OCCC. Analysis of NK cells from peripheral blood (PB) and peritoneal fluid (PF) showed that PF-derived NK cells had significantly reduced degranulation when co-cultured with autologous tumor cells (ATCs) [ 86 + 86 5. Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma ICIs have revolutionized the treatment landscape for multiple solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, bladder cancer, endometrial and cervical cancers, and renal cell carcinoma. Despite compelling preclinical data advocating their use in EOC, early-phase trials have largely underperformed [ 11 87 88 Among the pivotal investigations, the JAVELIN Ovarian 200 trial—a randomized, three-arm phase III study—evaluated avelumab as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) versus PLD alone in platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory EOC. Seventy-three patients with OCCC were included [ 89 Complementing these findings, the PEACOCC trial—a multicenter, single-arm phase II study—assessed pembrolizumab monotherapy in advanced clear cell gynecological cancers (CCGCs), predominantly of ovarian origin (85%) [ 90 In contrast, the MOCCA phase II trial compared durvalumab to the physician’s choice of chemotherapy in recurrent OCCC [ 91 p p Dual checkpoint blockade strategies are increasingly explored. A randomized phase II study evaluated nivolumab (anti–PD–1) alone versus its combination with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA–4) in relapsed CCGCs [ 92 Further evidence of durable benefit emerged from the SWOG S1609 DART trial evaluating nivolumab and ipilimumab in rare CCGCs [ 93 The MoST-CIRCUIT trial [ 94 Combination Between ICI and Other Target Therapies Given the limited monotherapy efficacy of ICIs in OCCC, multiple trials have pivoted toward combination strategies. The INOVA trial assessed sintilimab (PD-1 inhibitor) combined with bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) in patients with relapsed or persistent OCCC. Among 37 evaluable patients, the ORR was 40.5%, with five complete responses. Median PFS and OS were 6.9 months (95% CI: 5.3–8.1) and 28.2 months (95% CI: 23.8–NR), respectively [ 95 Building on immune–metabolic synergy, NRG-GY016 investigated pembrolizumab with epacadostat (IDO1 inhibitor) in 14 patients with OCCC [ 96 96 The LARA study offered compelling evidence for the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib (a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor) in recurrent CCGC. Of 25 evaluable patients, 44.0% achieved confirmed responses within 24 weeks (95% CI: 24.4–65.1), and median PFS reached 23.4 weeks (95% CI: 4.4–42.4) [ 97 Ongoing trials continue to refine these strategies. The DOVE/APGOT-OV7/ENGOT-ov80 study is a randomized phase II trial comparing dostarlimab ± bevacizumab with single-agent chemotherapy [ 98 NCT05600998 9 Table 1 6. Discussion The preclinical evidence delineates a multifaceted and immunologically paradoxical TIME in OCCC, where elevated infiltration by cytotoxic and Th cells paradoxically correlates with poorer prognosis, likely due to concurrent mechanisms of immune evasion such as MHC-I downregulation and regulatory cell accumulation [ 16 20 16 17 18 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 50 51 52 70 83 25 26 27 28 29 30 36 37 38 39 40 70 76 + 83 84 85 50 51 52 61 86 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 76 83 84 85 91 92 93 94 7. Conclusions In summary, OCCC presents a biologically distinct and therapeutically challenging landscape—characterized by an immunologically active yet functionally suppressed TIME. While conventional checkpoint inhibition shows limited benefit, emerging data highlight the value of combinatorial strategies and biomarker-driven approaches in unlocking durable immune responses. Harnessing genomic insights and refining patient selection will be key to transforming immunotherapy from an exploratory option into a validated standard within this rare and aggressive subtype.
