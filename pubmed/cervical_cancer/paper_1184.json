Introduction Cutaneous melanoma represents 1.7% of malignancies diagnosed worldwide, its annual incidence steadily rising from 20 to 23.5 new cases per 100,000 people during the decade 2012–2022 [ 1 2 3 4 1 1 1 2 3 4 Melanoma derives from melanocytes, melanin-pigmented cells located in the dermis, meant to absorb harmful ultraviolet radiation [ 5 6 5 6 7 7 8 7 8 8 9 Indeed, melanocytes may develop mutations that make them able to overmultiply, escape immune surveillance, and translocate to other departments of the host’s tissues, while inactivating crucial cell death pathways [ 5 6 7 8 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 13 Nevertheless, not all melanomas harbor BRAF V600 targetable mutations. In this case, immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors offers a highly effective therapeutic strategy, widely applied since the introduction of ipilimumab in 2011 [ 15 16 15 16 17 Meanwhile, more immune checkpoint inhibitors are emerging. Ten-year follow-up trial data have now also become available for the anti-PD-1 agent pembrolizumab, showing overall survival rates of 34% among metastatic melanoma patients [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 However, resistance eventually develops, as malignant melanocytes find ways to escape the host’s immune system, adjusting intracellular pathways, altering expressed antigens, and interfering with antigen presentation and cytokine signaling [ 26 27 28 29 30 28 29 30 It now seems possible that the above-mentioned shortcomings of the established immunotherapy regimens might be resolved by personalized mRNA vaccines, regarded as the upcoming breakthrough in melanoma treatment [ 31 31 32 33 31 32 33 2. Opening a New Era in Melanoma It cannot be doubted that the findings of the small yet substantial KEYNOTE-942 trial opened a new era in the treatment of melanoma [ 34 35 34 35 The study achieved its primary endpoint, as V940 addition was found to significantly reduce disease recurrence by 44%, according to the most recent update [ 9 10 34 35 34 35 The exciting findings mentioned above [ 34 35 36 36 37 Given the effectiveness of the pembrolizumab/mRNA vaccine combination in the adjuvant setting, oncologists are now wondering if it can improve outcomes in patients with metastatic disease. The upcoming multicenter V940-012/INTerpath-012 trial [ 38 The safety and tolerability of the personalized mRNA-4157 vaccine had been initially assessed in the context of a phase I study, KEYNOTE-603 ( NCT03313778 39 40 41 40 40 At the moment, there are nine active trials assessing the efficacy of mRNA-4157, with about six of them still being open to recruitment [ 42 Table 1 42 Still, clinical trial data regarding personalized mRNA vaccination remain scarce [ 39 40 41 42 43 41 3. Mechanism of Action Personalized mRNA vaccines are designed to inform the immune system of the host about the characteristic proteins expressed by melanoma or any other tumor cells, so that the former can successfully identify and destroy the latter [ 32 32 33 Vaccine mRNA-4157, being assessed in multiple trials at the moment, as already described above, might be considered as a personalized vaccine prototype [ 32 33 39 40 41 42 43 44 32 33 39 40 41 42 43 44 44 39 40 41 42 43 44 Figure 1 Once the vaccine is administered to the host, it is incorporated by the antigen-presenting cells, and it is translated into tumor proteins and exposed on the antigen-presenting cell surface, thus becoming available to lymphocytes [ 43 44 45 Figure 2 Figure 2 45 46 All in all, the vaccine and classic immunotherapy combination aspires to a stronger, but also more intelligent, cellular immunity against tumor cells [ 32 33 39 40 41 42 43 44 39 40 41 42 43 44 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 4. Old Ideas Under a New Light: Targeting the Dendritic Cell The dendritic cell (DC) is regarded as the ultimate professional antigen-presenting cell; it could be argued that it orchestrates the whole immune reaction cycle [ 47 48 49 50 The inherent asset of dendritic cells, making them particularly efficient in antigen presentation, is that they have both MHC class I and II, which mediate interaction with both CD8+ positive, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and CD4+-expressing helper T lymphocytes, respectively [ 51 52 53 23 24 54 55 As mentioned above, translocation is another powerful asset of DCs [ 54 55 56 56 57 The ability of DCs to move within the skin and lymph nodes of melanoma patients has been successfully captured in vivo as early as 2005 [ 27 58 The idea of targeting a cell that is fundamental to the immune reaction is not new [ 59 60 61 Second, the attempt to, in ex vivo, process the host’s monocytes, in order to inject them back into the patient as fully equipped DCs after incubation with growth factors and tumor proteins, did not prove to be particularly efficient [ 62 63 Lastly, in a more modern version, human DCs have been transfected ex vivo with cancer mRNA, so that, when returned to the patient, they would have incorporated the algorithm for producing cancer antigens and would be exposed to effector lymphocytes [ 64 Regardless of their solid physiological and immunological background, all the above ideas did not show fruitful results, whilst being impractical and impossible to perform outside specialized centers [ 60 61 62 63 64 32 33 34 Table 2 65 5. Dissecting the Footprints of Cancer: Individualized Neoantigen Treatment (INT) mRNA vaccines, such as V940, may be more accurately referred to as individualized neoadjuvant treatment (INT) [ 66 67 68 69 The V940 vaccine administered in KEYNOTE-942 and V940-001 trials, as mentioned above, is predicted to encode for up to 34 neoantigens [ 34 35 36 1. NGS of both neoplastic tissue and peripheral blood specimens of the patient: NGS has revolutionized cancer genomics during the last decades [ 70 71 72 2. Selection of the most immunogenic neoantigens: The characteristic cancer neoantigens can be evaluated for their potential to form stable connections with HLA proteins and TCRs, in order to reassure optimal antigen presentation and T lymphocyte activation, respectively. Antigen structure and binding potential might be evaluated by mass spectrometry or in vitro interaction with HLA proteins [ 73 74 75 3. Ex vivo mRNA synthesis: An mRNA sequence encoding for the selected, highly immunogenic, both tumor and patient specific neoantigens, is generated ex vivo. The mRNA molecule, once in the host’s system, will be internalized by DCs, mediating expression of the targeted neoantigens DCs surface, i.e., neoantigen presentation [ 74 75 4. Stabilization of the neoantigen encoding mRNA: mRNA can be encapsulated as cargo inside lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), protecting it from changes in temperature, pH, and lytic enzymes [ 76 77 In this same context, the Masterkey-265 [ 78 78 In that light, innovation of the novel mRNA vaccines consists of two elements [ 32 33 6. Next Generation Packaging: The Nanoparticles Safe mRNA delivery has been proven to be a challenging task for a multitude of reasons. First, as a single-strand molecule, lacking the powerful hydrogen bonds between base pairs that confer DNA its unbreakable structure, it is extremely vulnerable to temperature, humidity, and pH fluctuations, and is prone to be degraded by the widely spread RNAases [ 79 80 81 82 83 84 In previous experiments, scientists have attempted to bind protamine or lipid molecules to the mRNA as a stabilizer [ 81 82 83 84 81 82 83 84 Moreover, nanoparticles have been found to enhance endocytosis by dendritic cells as well. According to in vitro experiments, transfection of dendritic cell cultures by mRNA contained in lipid particles is more effective compared to alternative vectors, while nanoparticles with a higher concentration of lipids mediate higher rates of dendritic cell transfection [ 81 82 83 84 There is one major setback, nonetheless: once endocytosed, the mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticle still has to survive the endosome to lysosome fusion, a phenomenon described as endosomal escape [ 84 85 86 84 85 86 84 There are two notable theories about how lysosomal escape might occur, both indicating the importance of the structure and electric charge of the assessed LNP vectors [ 85 86 87 84 84 81 82 83 84 85 86 mRNA vaccines, enclosed in LNP vectors, were first introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, making effective vaccination feasible for a large group of people [ 88 86 87 Another remarkable aspect of LNP vectors is their potential ability to trigger inflammation [ 88 88 89 87 Notably, administration of LNP vectors containing cationic lipids in mice is associated with neutrophil infiltration of the injected sites, which would even lead to massive parenchymal lung inflammation when the LNPs were administered intranasally. In addition, systemic release of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin [IL]-1β and IL-6 was also observed [ 89 90 In another interesting experiment [ 91 91 91 In a more recent study, it has been found that the very endosomal escape, which is required for the mRNA antigen encoding sequence to make it to the ribosomal units and be translated into proteins, may induce endosomal membrane damage, creating pores that allow the entrance of proteins called galectins. Galectins are normally located in the cytosol, but once they have entered the endosome, they become attached to sugars of the inner endosomal membrane, initiating an inflammatory reaction [ 92 92 The inflammatory and immune-enhancing effects of LNPs remain to be thoroughly investigated in preclinical and translational studies, in order to optimize their use against cancer in humans. Understanding how LNPs may mediate local and systemic inflammation should allow scientists to develop more effective, but also more tolerable, mRNA vaccines, which will be more accurately tailored to the human immune system [ 90 91 92 7. Proof of Concept: How mRNA Vaccination Affects Host Immunity The LNP-packed mRNA individualized vaccines aspire to transfect DCs, turning them into intelligent agents of hosts’ immune systems. Clinical trial data suggest that their administration is of clinical benefit in real patients. Is there any evidence regarding the actual interplay between the vaccine, immune system, and cancer cells? Analysis of a subgroup of patients with metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer receiving the personalized V940 vaccine, in the context of KEYNOTE-603 phase I trial [ 39 40 41 41 Even more impressively, V940 administration seemed to initiate an expansion in surface HLA types of antigen-presenting cells of the patients [ 41 32 33 8. Future Prospects and Points Requiring Further Clarification Nevertheless, the KEYNOTE-603 [ 41 Figure 3 According to the latest data, V940 treatment does not seem to increase the rate of severe or immune-related adverse events, nor has it been found that it leads more patients to discontinue treatment [ 32 33 Another problem consists of the hierarchy by which INT is going to be included in the therapeutic algorithm. Will it be employed in an adjuvant setting exclusively or is it going to become an essential part of first-line treatment against metastatic melanoma? In any setting, treatment selection criteria, in order for physicians to choose between immunotherapy plus INT and established immune checkpoint combinations, should also be discussed [ 93 Furthermore, INT promises to optimize the quality and intensity of the hosts’ immune system to detect and destroy cancer. Regardless, neoantigens keep changing as a result of endless mutations taking place within the cancer genome; thus, maybe a neoantigen sequence encoded by a vaccine, based on a certain tumor specimen, may not be able to represent the whole genetic evolution of cancer within the human body [ 94 95 96 Furthermore, although neoantigens can now be recognized by NGS technology and potent computational systems, there is no consensus on how neoantigen selection should be performed, or on standardized tools serving this purpose [ 97 98 97 98 99 99 100 100 101 101 102 As described above, the development of universal mRNA vaccines may provide an effective alternative to individualized neoantigen vaccines (see Table 3 NCT04526899 65 65 Financing production and large-scale distribution of mRNA vaccines, especially ones encoding for individualized neoantigens, is another important concern. Even mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, intended to protect the global population against a pandemic, were not always accessible to residents in middle- and lower-income countries [ 103 104 31 105 In addition, producing a totally individualized medication, unique to each patient and their neoplasm, all while being a tremendous scientific achievement, means that only small batches can be produced at a time [ 105 106 31 105 106 9. Critical Appraisal of Clinical Trials Involving mRNA Vaccines As clinical trials are progressing, clinical outcomes regarding mRNA vaccines are becoming more abundant. Nonetheless, it is still early to assess the effectiveness, safety, and impact of mRNA vaccines. For example, it cannot be doubted that the Keynote-942 findings are of extremely significant importance; however, it draws its assumptions from a small patient sample of 157 patients [ 34 35 36 34 35 36 Another concern is about the initial large-scale testing of the individualized mRNA vaccines in the adjuvant setting, where especially prolonged follow up is necessary in order to assess treatment benefit. Also, it could be argued that, when employed in the adjuvant setting, any novel treatment agent cannot prove its actual activity against neoplastic cells, as no objective responses can be seen. The ability of the mRNA-4157 vaccine to induce objective tumor shrinkage is to be assessed in the V940-012 trial [ 38 65 Last but not least, employing mRNA-4157 in the adjuvant setting makes it impossible to use a single-agent vaccine arm, as it would be unethical for the patients not to receive the approved immunotherapy [ 34 35 36 65 10. Conclusions mRNA vaccines, encoding for individual, tumor- and patient-specific neoantigens, are already revolutionizing melanoma oncology. More studies are needed to thoroughly investigate actual patient benefit, as well as to dissect their mechanism of action, in order to and optimize their performance. Nonetheless, they represent a cutting-edge treatment, which has undeniably set a pathway for a perfectly tailored cancer treatment, eventually combining scientific and technological advances of several past decades.

Malignant cells exhibit multiple neoantigens, resulting from various genetic and epigenetic alterations (1a). Normal cells share a common, repetitive variety of normal antigens (1b). DNA from cancer tissue and blood samples for each patient is analyzed by Next-Generation Sequencing. Once cancer (2a) and normal cell DNA (2b) are sequenced, the resulting data sets are further examined in parallel by computational systems (3). Highly immunogenic neoantigens are selected, and an mRNA sequence encoding for them is created ex vivo (4) and enclosed in Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for protection and stability (5). In this form (6), the individualized mRNA vaccine, encoding for significant tumor-specific neoantigens, may be stored, transferred, and administered to the patient. Each such individualized vaccine is uniquely designed for only one patient. Figure 2 Schematic representation of how mRNA neoantigen vaccines enhance immunity against cancer cells. Once the LNP-enclosed mRNA molecule is endocytosed by the dendritic cells (1), an endosome is formed (2). The endosome may fuse with a lysosome (3), forming an endolysosome that has to be disrupted in order for the encoding mRNA to be released intact into the cytoplasm (endosomal escape, 4). mRNA is then translated by ribosomes (5) into neoantigens representing the phenotypic profile of cancer cells (6). Neoantigens may then be linked to MHCs, class I (7a) and II (7b), eventually being exposed to both cytotoxic CD8+ and helper CD4+ T-lymphocytes, respectively. Figure 3 Future challenges regarding cancer mRNA individualized vaccines in melanoma and/or other solid malignancies. Future research might focus on three main categories: (1) Methods of assessment and in vivo monitoring of the actual effect of mRNA neoantigen vaccines on antigen presentation and subsequent cytotoxic immune response. (2) Establishment of patient selection criteria, so that treatment is administered to patients most likely to benefit, with good tolerance. (3) Planning a therapeutic algorithm containing individualized vaccines, among other available strategies in the adjuvant and metastatic treatment setting. vaccines-13-00986-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Active studies involving mRNA-4157 vaccine.
