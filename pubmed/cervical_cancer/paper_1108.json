Patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LA-ESCC) typically have a poor prognosis, and concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the primary treatment modality. However, elderly patients often exhibit lower completion rates of concurrent chemoradiotherapy due to multiple comorbidities and reduced treatment tolerance, which directly affects their prognosis. Although apatinib combined with radiotherapy has demonstrated synergistic potential in treating certain solid tumors, its efficacy in elderly patients with LA-ESCC remains unclear. This case report involves an elderly patient with unresectable LA-ESCC who was treated with apatinib combined with intensity-modulated radiation therapy, The patient had comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes, and declined chemotherapy. We implemented a treatment regimen consisting of intensity-modulated radiation therapy combined with low-dose apatinib. After nine sessions of radiotherapy, the patient’s dysphagia significantly improved, and follow-up computed tomography revealed marked tumor shrinkage. As of July 2024, the patient has achieved a progression-free survival of 71 months without experiencing severe (Grade III/IV) adverse reactions. Therefore, apatinib combined with radiotherapy suggests potential benefits as a concurrent treatment option for elderly patients with unresectable LA-ESCC. esophageal squamous cell carcinoma apatinib intensity-modulated radiation therapy elderly patients unresectable case report The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Gastrointestinal Cancers: Gastric and Esophageal Cancers 1 Introduction Esophageal cancer (EC) is a highly aggressive and fatal disease, ranking seventh in incidence and sixth in cancer mortality worldwide. Squamous cell carcinoma is the predominant histological type of esophageal carcinoma with its incidence being associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, and malnutrition ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 2 Case description In September 2018, an 81-year-old male presented with progressive dysphagia lasting more than 50 days. Throughout the course of the disease, he experienced no chest pain, nausea, vomiting, black stool, or hematemesis, but his symptoms progressively worsened. The patient sought treatment at our hospital after undergoing gastroscopy at a local hospital, suspecting EC. He was admitted for a physical examination with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0 and moderate nutritional status. No superficial lymph nodes were palpated, and no abnormalities were found during the heart, lung, and abdominal examinations. Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) performed on September 10, 2018, revealed uneven thickening of the cervical to upper thoracic esophageal wall, with a maximum thickness of approximately 2.4 cm (  Figure 1A  Figure 1B  Figure 1C 12  Figure 2 13 14  Figures 1D-F  Figures 1G-I  Figures 1J-L  Figure 3 Figure 1 CT images during treatment.

Radiotherapy is the primary treatment modality for this patient population ( 4 15 16 17 18 19 20 11 21 22 11 21 22 Patients with unresectable LA-ESCC may experience greater survival benefits from concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) compared to other treatment regimens ( 15 15 23 9 24 25 26 27 In elderly patients, tumors often exhibit slower growth, characterized by increased extracellular matrix, reduced angiogenesis, and altered vessel morphology ( 28 25 29 26 27 26 27 Notably, a substantial proportion of TEF cases are secondary to EC ( 30 31 32 33 Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to the patient for agreeing to share the information.
