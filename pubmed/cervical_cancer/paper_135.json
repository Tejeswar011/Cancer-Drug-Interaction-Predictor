Background Hip fractures attributable to falls (HFAF) represent one of the life-threatening conditions in older adults. This study aims to analyze trends and geographical distribution characteristics of HFAF in older adults from 1990 to 2021. Methods Key indicators including incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database. Spatiotemporal trends in disease burden were systematically described using methods including Joinpoint regression analysis, age-period-cohort analysis, inequality analysis, and frontier analysis. Decomposition analysis was used to explore key factors underlying fluctuations in HFAF burden in older adults. Finally, the ARIMA model was employed to project disease burden over the next 15 years. Result Globally, from 1990 to 2021, age-standardized prevalence (ASPR) and incidence (ASIR) of HFAF in older adults increased, whereas age-standardized YLDs (ASYR) decreased. Disease burden was greater in regions with higher socioeconomic status. Gender-based analysis showed that disease burden was greater among older women than among older men. Over time, cross-country inequalities widened. Frontier analysis identified that countries such as Belgium and Switzerland have substantial potential to improve disease control. Decomposition analysis identified population growth as the primary driver of the rising global burden. Projections indicated that case numbers will continue to rise by 2036, but age-standardized rates will decline. Conclusion This study indicates that the global disease burden of HFAF in older adults increased from 1990 to 2021 and is projected to continue rising through 2036. Reductions in ASYR suggest that current treatment measures are effective. falls hip fractures global burden of disease prediction older adults The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Data released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021 indicate that falls are the second leading cause of unintentional injury-related deaths worldwide. Annually, 37.3 million severe falls requiring medical attention occur globally, resulting in approximately 684,000 deaths ( 1 2 n 3 4 5 6 Hip fractures are one of the most threatening of the serious consequences of falls in the older adults ( 7 8 9 10 11 13 In recent years, the academic community has conducted several regional studies on HFAF in older adults. For instance, between 1990 and 2019, the age-standardized incidence rate of HFAF decreased among women in Central European countries, whereas it increased among men ( 14 15 The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington (USA) with participation from multiple countries and regions worldwide, is a comprehensive epidemiological survey project ( 16 17 19 2 Methods and data 2.1 Data source The GBD 2021 provides disease burden data for 369 diseases and injuries across 204 countries and territories ( 16 https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/ Supplementary Figure S1 2.2 Definitions The Socio-demographic Index (SDI) is an evaluation metric developed by GBD Collaborators, based on national/territorial rankings of per capita income, average educational attainment, and total fertility rate. It measures the socio-demographic development level of individual countries or territories, with values ranging from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a higher level of socio-demographic development. Using SDI, GBD Collaborators categorized 204 countries/territories worldwide into five SDI regions: Low SDI (<0.466), Low-middle SDI (0.466–0.619), Middle SDI (0.620–0.712), High-middle SDI (0.713–0.810), and High SDI (>0.810) ( 20 A g e - s t a n d a r d i z e d  =  ∑ i = 1 A a i w i ∑ i = 1 A w i  × 100 , 000 a i th w i th A 21 2.3 Descriptive analysis This section primarily describes the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), and age-standardized YLD rate (ASYR) of HFAF in older adults in 2021, across the globe, five SDI regions, 21 GBD regions, and 204 countries. The estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was also calculated to analyze trends in the disease burden of HFAF in older adults from 1990 to 2021. The EAPC is derived by fitting a regression model to the natural logarithm of the rate, with time as the variable. Specifically, the natural logarithm of each observed value is fitted to a straight line, and the EAPC is calculated using the slope of this line, with the specific formula as follows: y  =  α + β x + ε E A P C ( % )  =  100 × ( e x p ( β ) - 1 ) Where x represents the year, y represents the natural logarithm of the age-standardized rate, α represents the intercept, β represents the slope, and ε represents the random error ( 22 23 2.4 Joinpoint regression analysis Further, Joinpoint regression analysis was used to analyze trends in the ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR of HFAF in older adults globally. The annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) were calculated to analyze changes across multiple stages. A positive AAPC indicates an annual increase in disease burden, whereas a negative AAPC indicates an annual decrease; an AAPC of 0 indicates a monotonic trend. The maximum number of joinpoints selected was 5 ( 24 A P C  =  [ e x p ( β ) - 1 ] × 100 A A P C  =  [ e x p  ( ∑ w i b i ∑ w i ) - 1 ] × 100 b i i 2.5 Decomposition analysis Das Gupta's decomposition analysis method was used to explore the relative impacts of three factors—aging, population growth, and epidemiological changes—on changes in the disease burden of HFAF in older adults from 1990 to 2021. The sum of the contribution rates of these three factors within the same region equals 100% ( 25 2.6 Cross-country inequality analysis The slope index of inequality (SII) and health inequality concentration index (CI) were used to assess the unequal distribution of the burden of HFAF in older adults across countries. The SII directly measures the absolute burden difference between extreme SDI groups: a positive value indicates a greater disease burden in high-SDI countries, a negative value indicates a greater burden in low-SDI countries, and its absolute value is positively correlated with the degree of inequality. The concentration index is calculated using Lorenz curve plots (ranging from −1 to 1); a negative value indicates that the health burden is concentrated in low-SDI countries, and the absolute value reflects the degree of inequity in social stratification. These two indicators form a comprehensive evaluation system covering absolute difference and relative distribution ( 26 2.7 Age-period-cohort analysis The Poisson-based age-period-cohort model was used to explore the effects of age, period, and birth cohort on HFAF in older adults. This model is currently widely applied in demography, epidemiology, sociology, and other fields ( 27 Supplementary Table S1 28 2.8 Frontier analysis After clarifying the current situation, trends, and influencing factors, frontier analysis was used to evaluate the optimization potential of the disease burden of HFAF in older adults. An SDI-based optimal practice boundary was used to calculate the “effective difference” between the observed value of each country/region and the theoretical optimal value. The distance between each country/region's representative point and the boundary is termed the “effective difference,” indicating the gap between the observed disease burden of HFAF in older adults and the minimum achievable burden for a country/region given its SDI. This indicator reflects the potential reduction in the disease burden of such fractures achievable through optimized resource allocation under specific sociodemographic conditions ( 29 2.9 Forecasting analysis The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to predict future trends of the disease burden of HFAF in older adults from 2022 to 2036. The model is denoted as ARIMA (p, d, q), where p is the autoregressive order, d is the number of differences, and q is the moving average order. The optimal model was selected based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) value: models were searched according to the provided constraint order, and the optimal one was determined. The Ljung-Box test for white noise was used to examine residual serial correlation. This model has been applied in numerous disease prediction studies ( 30 31 3 Results 3.1 Increased global disease burden of HFAF in older adults Globally, from 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of HFAF in older adults increased from 847.64 per 100,000 population (95% UI: 559.84, 1,222.97) to 930.73 per 100,000 (95% UI: 624.14, 1,317.39), representing a total increase of 9.8% over 32 years (EAPC = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.32; Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR in 1990 and 2021, and EAPC from 1990 to 2021 at the global level and different regions.

evaluate the segmented trends of ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR of HFAF in older adults ( Figure 1 Supplementary Table S2 Figure 1 The jointpoint regression analysis of hip fractures attributable to falls in older adults from 1990 to 2021. Three graphs display age-standardized rates from 1990 to 2021, with trends for both sexes, females, and males. The first graph shows incidence rates, the second shows prevalence rates, and the third shows YLD (Years Lived with Disability) rates. Each graph includes joinpoints and average percentage change (APC) data in the legend. 3.2 Diverse disease burden of HFAF in older adults across regions and countries At the SDI regional level, 2021 data showed a striking gradient in disease burden: High SDI regions had the highest ASIR (1,469.17 per 100,000; 95% UI: 1,013.83, 2,039.11), which was 3.2 times higher than that of Low SDI regions (464.74 per 100,000; 95% UI: 293.86, 693.83). A similar pattern was observed for ASPR: High SDI regions (3,421.55 per 100,000; 95% UI: 2,759.5, 4,210.12) had a 4.9-fold higher rate than Low SDI regions (693.26 per 100,000; 95% UI: 526.32, 905.06). High SDI regions had the highest ASYR [236.3 (95% UI: 154.2, 339.97)] of HFAF in older adults. From 1990 to 2021, the Middle SDI region exhibited the fastest growth in ASIR (EAPC = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.42) and ASPR (EAPC = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.26, 1.61), whereas High-middle SDI regions had the largest ASYR decrease (EAPC = −1.04, 95% CI: −1.15, −0.93; Figure 2 Table 1 Figure 2 The ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR of hip fractures attributable to falls in older adults globally, across the 5 SDI regions, and 21 GBD regions in 2021, as well as the EAPC of ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR from 1990 to 2021. ASIR, Age-standardized incidence rate; ASPR, Age-standardized prevalence rate; ASYR, Age-standardized years lived with disability rate; EAPC, Estimated annual percentage change. Six bar charts illustrate changes in the disease burden of HFAF across different regions from 1990 to 2021. Each chart is categorized by geographic location and gender (female, male): the x-axis displays geographic location, while the y-axis shows numerical changes within each chart. At the GBD regional level, in 2021, Australasia had the highest ASIR [2,358.9 (95% UI: 1,676.77, 3,151.75)], ASPR [4,725.35 (95% UI: 3,901.08, 5,685.83)], and ASYR [338.62 (95% UI: 225.18, 484.8)] of HFAF in older adults. From 1990 to 2021, ASIR showed the largest increase in North Africa and the Middle East [EAPC = 2.19 (95% CI: 2.05, 2.34)] and the largest decrease in Central Europe [EAPC = −1.11 (95% CI: −1.2, −1.03)]. ASPR showed the largest increase in North Africa and the Middle East [EAPC = 2.2 (95% CI: 2.04, 2.37)] and the largest decrease in Southern Sub-Saharan Africa [EAPC = −1.01 (95% CI: −1.2, −0.83)]. ASYR showed the largest increase in Australasia [EAPC = 1.68 (95% CI: 1.51, 1.84)] and the largest decrease in Central Europe [EAPC = −2.44 (95% CI: −2.55, −2.33)] ( Figure 2 Table 1 At the country level, in 2021, Andorra had the highest ASIR [3,379.92 (95% UI: 2,334.7, 4,603.8)] and ASPR [7,136.9 (95% UI: 5,919.09, 8,514.99)], while Greenland had the highest ASYR [545.42 (95% UI: 368.68, 760.05)]. ASIR showed the largest increase in Turkey [EAPC = 4.4 (95% CI: 4.02, 4.78)] and the largest decrease in Czechia [EAPC = −2.77 (95% CI: −2.94, −2.59)]. ASPR showed the largest increase in Turkey [EAPC = 4.24 (95% CI: 3.88, 4.61)] and the largest decrease in Hungary (EAPC = −2.15 (95% CI: −2.35, −1.96)].

ASIR, Age-standardized incidence rate; ASPR, Age-standardized prevalence rate; ASYR, Age-standardized years lived with disability rate; EAPC, Estimated annual percentage change. Six world maps illustrate variations in the HFAF disease burden across 204 countries and regions. Each map employs color coding to distinguish different data intervals, with highlighted areas indicating focal regions. The left-hand maps present ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR values per 100,000 population, while the right-hand maps display EAPC trends for ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR. Data range interpretations are guided by corresponding color legend explanations. 3.3 Disease burden of HFAF in older adults by gender Significant differences were observed in the age and gender distribution of HFAF in older adults globally. Age group analysis revealed that the 80–84 years group had the highest number of prevalent cases, incident cases, and YLDs. Gender-based analysis showed that females had higher numbers of prevalent cases, incident cases, and YLDs than males across all age groups. Over the past 30 years, the number of prevalent cases, incident cases, and YLDs has continued to increase in both females and males, with females consistently having higher numbers than males in any given year ( Figure 4 Figure 4 The prevalence, incidence, and YLDs of hip fractures attributable to falls in older adults, stratified by age and gender.

The bar charts on the left display numbers for incidence, prevalence, and YLDs, with red representing females and blue males. The graphs on the right show corresponding rates and numbers over age groups, with different colored lines for each sex. 3.3.1 The global disease burden of HFAF in older women and older men From 1990 to 2021, the global disease burden of HFAF in older females showed an increasing trend. ASIR increased from 1,060.70 cases per 100,000 population (95% UI: 699.29, 1,533.1) to 1,129.07 cases per 100,000 population (95% UI: 754.2, 1,607.57), with an EAPC of 0.19 (95% CI: 0.15, 0.23).

In general, ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR were positively correlated with SDI. Specifically, ASIR and ASPR remained stable when SDI was between 0 and 0.65 but increased continuously with SDI once SDI exceeded 0.65. ASYR showed a non-linear S-shaped relationship with SDI: it decreased with increasing SDI when SDI was below 0.4 or above 0.6, but was positively correlated with SDI when SDI was between 0.4 and 0.6 ( Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 5 The ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR of hip fractures attributable to falls in older adults in 21 GBD regions by the SDI.

The top left plot shows age-standardized incidence rates, the top right plot shows age-standardized prevalence rates, and the bottom left plot shows age-standardized Years Lived with Disability (YLD) rates. Each plot uses different symbols and colors to represent different global regions. A black line indicates a general trend across the SDI spectrum. A legend details the symbols and colors for each region and time period. Figure 6 The ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR of hip fractures attributable to falls in older adults in 204 countries by the SDI.

Three scatter plots show age-standardized rates per 100,000 population against the Socio-Demographic Index. The left plot depicts incidence rates, the middle shows prevalence rates, and the right illustrates YLD (Years Lived with Disability) rates. Each plot displays a positive correlation, with a noticeable increase in rates as the Socio-Demographic Index rises. Various countries are labeled in different colors. 3.5 Age-period-cohort analysis Local drift, calculated using the age-period-cohort model, represents the AAPC of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs across age groups. Incidence and prevalence increased continuously in all age groups, with the most significant increase in the 95+ years age group (local drift coefficients: 1.089 for incidence and 1.347 for prevalence). For HFAF, older males (incidence = 2.217, prevalence = 2.598) and older females (incidence = 1.016, prevalence = 1.274) also showed the most significant increases in the 95+ years age group. YLDs showed increasing trends in the 85–89 years, 90–94 years, and 95+ years age groups, with the largest local drift coefficient (1.038) in the 95+ years group. YLDs showed decreasing trends in other age groups, with the largest local drift coefficient (−0.994) in the 55–59 years group. Among older males, YLDs of HFAF showed increasing trends in the 75–79 years, 80–84 years, 85–89 years, 90–94 years, and 95+ years age groups, with the largest local drift coefficient (1.237) in the 95+ years group; YLDs showed decreasing trends in other age groups, with the largest local drift coefficient (−1.145) in the 55–59 years group. Among older females, YLDs showed increasing trends in the 90–94 years and 95+ years age groups, with the largest local drift coefficient (0.975) in the 95+ years group; YLDs showed decreasing trends in other age groups, with the largest local drift coefficient (−0.925) in the 55–59 years group ( Figure 7 Supplementary Tables S6–S8 Figure 7 The impacts of age effect, period effect, and cohort effect on the prevalence, incidence, and YLDs of hip fractures attributable to falls in older adults. YLDs, Years lived with disability. Twelve-panel chart visualizing annual changes and rates in incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) by age, period, and birth cohort. Each panel compares data for both genders, females, and males indicated by blue, yellow, and light blue lines respectively. The top row shows annual changes with increased trends, the middle row depicts age-specific rates rising with age, and the bottom two rows illustrate period and cohort-relative ratios over time, with dashed horizontal lines marking reference levels. Shaded areas indicate confidence intervals. Age effects revealed significant differences in prevalence across age groups: the incidence, prevalence, and YLDs of HFAF in older adults increased with age, indicating a higher risk in older individuals. Period effect analysis showed a gradual increase in prevalence and incidence from 1990 to 2021. YLDs of HFAF in older males fluctuated significantly, showing a trend of initial increase, followed by decrease, and then re-increase, while YLDs in older females decreased continuously. Overall, fall-related YLDs in older adults decreased over time. Cohort effect analysis indicated that later-born cohorts had a higher relative risk of prevalence and incidence of HFAF in older adults. However, the cohort effect on YLDs showed a trend of initial increase followed by decrease, which may be influenced by medical policies for hip fracture treatment and care in different periods. Later-born cohorts had a lower relative risk of YLDs. These findings highlight the complex interactions of age, period, and birth cohort in influencing the prevalence, incidence, and YLDs of HFAF in older adults ( Figure 7 Supplementary Tables S6–S8 3.6 Decomposition analysis Decomposition analysis was performed to further explore the impacts of aging, population growth, and epidemiological changes on prevalence, incidence, and YLDs. Globally, population growth was the primary factor influencing prevalence, incidence, and YLDs from 1990 to 2021. Over the past 30 years, incidence increased by 8,209,555.97, with population growth contributing 6,159,109.56 (75.02%), aging contributing 1,335,309.80 (16.27%), and epidemiological changes contributing only 715,136.61 (8.71%). Prevalence increased by 16,454,176.50, with population growth contributing 12,111,087.83 (73.61%), aging contributing 2,346,846.37 (14.26%), and epidemiological changes contributing 1,996,242.30 (12.13%). YLDs increased by 1,280,180.85, with population growth contributing 1,219,855.27 (95.29%), aging contributing 206,419.05 (16.12%), and epidemiological changes contributing −146,093.47 (−11.41%) ( Figure 8 Supplementary Table S9 Figure 8 Supplementary Table S9 Figure 8 Decomposition analysis of changes in the prevalence, incidence, and YLDs of hip fractures attributable to falls in older adults globally from 1990 to 2021.YLDs, Years lived with disability.

Each chart shows contributions by aging (blue), epidemiological change (yellow), and population (gray). Black dots indicate specific values for each sex category. 3.7 Cross-country inequalities analysis Analysis of 204 countries and regions revealed significant differences in the burden of HFAF in older adults associated with SDI, with the burden concentrated primarily in high-SDI regions. Over time, inequalities in ASIR and ASPR increased, while inequalities in ASYR decreased ( Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 Cross-country inequality analysis of the ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR of hip fractures attributable to falls in older adults in 1990 and 2021.

Top row charts illustrate crude incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability rates against relative rank by Socio-Demographic Index (SDI), with scatterplots indicating population size through bubble size and color. Bottom row charts depict cumulative fractions of incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability, with lines for concentration indices. Blue and red represent years 1990 and 2021, respectively. Data suggests increasing rates and shifting population distribution over time. 3.8 Frontier analysis To better understand the potential for improving the burden of HFAF in older adults based on national SDI, frontier analysis was performed using ASIR, ASPR, ASYR, and SDI. For ASIR, the top 15 countries with the largest effective differences were Andorra, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Australia, Croatia, France, Finland, Greenland, Canada, Cyprus, Slovenia, New Zealand, and Sweden. In low-SDI regions, the five countries with the smallest effective differences were Somalia, Afghanistan, Madagascar, Bangladesh, and Yemen. In high-SDI regions, the top five countries with the largest effective differences were Andorra, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland ( Figure 10 Figure 10 Frontier analysis for hip fractures attributable to falls in older adults in 204 countries in 2021. The optimal practice frontier is delimited by a solid black line, with countries/regions represented as points and the top 15 countries with the largest efficiency gaps labeled. Low-SDI regions and countries/regions with smaller efficiency gaps are labeled in blue font, while high-SDI countries/regions with efficiency gaps disproportionately large for their development levels are labeled in red font.

In high-SDI regions, the top five countries with the largest effective differences were Andorra, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, and the Netherlands ( Figure 10 3.9 Forecasting analysis In selecting the optimal model type and parameters, the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to compare the goodness-of-fit of different models, with the model with the smallest criterion value selected. After model establishment, the Ljung-Box test for white noise was used to examine residual serial correlation ( Supplementary Table S10 Figure 11 Supplementary Tables S11–S13 Supplementary Figures S4 S5 Figure 11 Prediction of the disease burden trend of hip fractures attributable to falls in older adults from 2022 to 2036. The six line charts display health indicators from 1990 to 2036, presenting both actual and projected data. The top three charts show incidence rates, prevalence rates, and years lived with disability (YLDs), all of which rose sharply around 2021. The bottom row presents age-standardized rates for the same indicators. Incidence and prevalence rates continue to climb, while YLD rates show a declining trend. Projected data is shaded in light purple and begins appearing after 2021, indicating future projections. 4 Discussion Using the latest data from the GBD 2021 database, the global and regional epidemiological characteristics of HFAF in older adults were systematically summarized, revealing an overall increasing trend in disease burden from 1990 to 2021. Through regional analysis, Socio-demographic Index (SDI) analysis, inequality analysis, and frontier analysis, significant disparities across geographic and SDI regions were identified: compared to 1990, regions with higher SDI levels in 2021 exhibited a heavier disease burden. Furthermore, health inequalities between high-SDI and low-SDI regions gradually widened. Decomposition analysis subsequently revealed that population growth was the primary driver of the increase in HFAF in older adults. Additionally, projections indicate that the number of prevalent cases, incident cases, and YLDs of HFAF in older adults will continue to rise over the next 15 years, while ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR will decline. This reflects the combined effects of substantial growth in the older adults and advancements in public health. These results align with an Italian study highlighting the dominant role of population aging in the hip fracture burden and validate the theory that “demographic transition is the core driver of older adults health issues” ( 32 The distribution of HFAF in older adults is highly uneven across regions. In terms of regional distribution, ASIR, ASPR, and ASYR in high-SDI regions (e.g., Australasia, High SDI regions) were significantly higher than in low-SDI regions. A survey of six hospitals in China found that 74.5% of patients with HFAF were from economically developed urban areas, while only 25.5% were from less developed rural areas ( 33 34 13 In terms of population characteristics, disease burden was higher in females than males across all age groups, consistent with female physiological characteristics such as increased osteoporosis risk due to declining postmenopausal estrogen levels and faster muscle strength deterioration ( 35 36 37 6 38 Results from the age-period-cohort analysis showed that, in terms of age effects, the incidence, prevalence, and YLDs of HFAF in older adults increased significantly with age, consistent with the objective law of physiological deterioration in the older adults ( 35 36 39 40 41 Health inequality analysis showed that disease burden is concentrated in high-SDI regions, with widening absolute inequalities in ASIR and ASPR, consistent with the global uneven distribution of health resources ( 42 43 44 45 Previous studies have primarily relied on GBD 2019 data, which only covers up to 2019, and thus cannot reflect changes in disease burden following the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2021. Additionally, no studies have specifically analyzed the impact of falls on hip fractures in the older adults. This study is based on the latest GBD 2021 database, extending data analysis to 2021, and provides the most up-to-date and comprehensive global, regional, and national burden assessment of hip fractures caused by falls among the older adults to date. We specifically focused on the “fall” mechanism and older adults. Falls are the leading cause of hip fractures in the older adults, and this focus allows our findings to directly address the important public health issue of fall prevention in the older adults. The methods employed, such as age-period-cohort analysis and decomposition analysis, also offer methodological references for similar disease burden studies. At the public health policy level, clarifying the increasing trend of global disease burden and identifying population growth as the main driver provides data support for countries to formulate prevention and control strategies. The high disease burden and optimization potential in high-SDI regions suggest the need to strengthen preventive measures, while rapid growth in low-SDI regions highlights the importance of improving medical resource accessibility, aiding in the optimization of global medical resource allocation. The study also revealed population characteristics such as the 80–84 years peak age and higher female burden, providing a basis for precise clinical interventions (e.g., enhancing osteoporosis screening and fall prevention in older women). Additionally, clarifying the high mortality and economic costs of hip fractures emphasizes the importance of early surgery and comprehensive rehabilitation, which can promote improvements in clinical diagnosis and treatment standards. Our study unveils several critical avenues for future research. First, the alarming rise in incidence rates within Middle SDI regions demands urgent, localized investigation. Future studies should employ individual-level data in these regions to identify modifiable risk factors that are driving this epidemic, as these factors may differ from those in high-income countries. Second, the concerning increase in ASYR among older males, in stark contrast to the decrease seen in females, points to a significant gender gap in post-fracture care. Prospective cohort studies are needed to compare recovery pathways, rehabilitation adherence, and comorbidity profiles between men and women to explain this disparity and develop gender-tailored intervention protocols. Finally, our frontier analysis identified specific high-SDI countries with a substantial “efficiency gap” between their current burden and the theoretical minimum achievable given their resources. Future implementation science research should focus on these countries to identify the health policy, clinical practice, or socioeconomic barriers that prevent them from achieving optimal outcomes, serving as a model for other nations. However, this study has several limitations. First, GBD data relies on statistical models and literature synthesis rather than direct clinical diagnoses, which may result in underdiagnosis in low-SDI regions not being fully corrected. For example, some sub-Saharan African regions lack standardized diagnostic tools, potentially leading to severe underestimation of disease burden. Second, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HFAF in older adults was not included in the analysis. The popularization of telemedicine during the pandemic may have temporarily improved diagnosis and treatment rates in high-SDI countries, but low-SDI regions may have experienced inaccurate 2020–2021 data due to low internet penetration. Finally, each statistical analysis model has inherent limitations: Joinpoint regression analysis relies on a preset number of inflection points to explain trends, while the ARIMA model assumes stable data trends and cannot account for future sudden factors such as pandemics, policy adjustments, or drug development. 5 Conclusion This study highlights the intensifying global challenge of HFAF in older adults. With rising incidence, prevalence, and widening socioeconomic disparities, these factors are placing enormous pressure on medical resources and socioeconomic systems worldwide. Analyses show that the global burden of HFAF in older adults increased significantly from 1990 to 2021, with inequalities worsening at an accelerated rate in regions with weak health systems due to scattered medical resources and lagging diagnostic capabilities. Specifically, high-SDI regions need to strengthen preventive measures, while low-SDI regions need to improve medical accessibility—findings with important implications for optimizing global medical resource allocation and precise interventions. The gender disparity in HFAF in older adults underscores the need to strengthen osteoporosis prevention in postmenopausal older women. The reduction in YLDs indicates that current hip fracture treatments and care measures are effective. With medical technology development, the disease burden of HFAF in older adults can be reduced through both prevention and treatment. Overall, this study provides systematic epidemiological evidence in the field of HFAF in older adults, emphasizing the importance of global collaborative prevention and control. It is hoped that these findings will promote in-depth academic research and public health practice innovation, ultimately improving the health status of older populations.
