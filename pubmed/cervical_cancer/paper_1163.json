While ropivacaine demonstrates anti-neuroinflammatory effects through NF-κB pathway suppression, its mechanistic link to analgesia remains unclear. This study investigates ropivacaine’s neuromodulatory role in neuroinflammatory responses during pain progression, specifically targeting NF-κB signaling. Our findings reveal how ropivacaine alleviates neuropathic pain by inhibiting this pathway, offering critical insights into its therapeutic potential via neuroinflammatory modulation. The spared nerve injury (SNI) model was established in rats according to standardized protocols. Ropivacaine was administered intrathecally daily for 7 days after SNI surgery. Behavioral Assessment: Paw Withdrawal Mechanical Threshold (PWMT) was quantified using von Frey filaments at preoperative baseline and postoperative days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14. Tissue Processing: L4–L6 spinal cord tissues were processed for (1) immunofluorescence analysis of microglial activation marker Iba-1, (2), quantitative real-time PCR to determine mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and (3) western blotting to evaluate NF-κB signaling pathway activation. Consecutive daily intrathecal injections of ropivacaine for 7 days resulted in sustained alleviation of mechanical allodynia in the treatment group, persisting for at least 14 days post-surgery despite treatment cessation. It suppressed neuroinflammation by downregulating TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 mRNA levels and reducing Iba-1 expression. These effects were mechanistically linked to inhibition of the TRAF2/PI3K/Akt/NF-κB pathway, evidenced by decreased phosphorylation of key signaling components. Ropivacaine alleviates neuropathic pain by suppressing the TRAF2/PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling cascade, linking its anti-neuroinflammatory effects to sustained analgesia. This novel mechanism clarifies its pharmacodynamic basis and provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies against neuroinflammation-driven pain disorders.

Commonly prescribed agents (anticonvulsants, antidepressants) frequently induce adverse neurological and cardiovascular complications including dizziness, somnolence, severe cephalalgia, and hypertension, substantially compromising treatment adherence and clinical efficacy 15 16 17 To address this knowledge gap, we employed a rat peripheral nerve injury model to investigate ropivacaine-NF-κB signaling interactions systematically. Our findings are anticipated to elucidate the neuroimmunological mechanisms underlying ropivacaine-mediated pain alleviation, thereby providing novel therapeutic insights for optimizing neuropathic pain management protocols. Materials and methods Animals and ethics statement Forty male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (6–8 weeks old, weighing 210–250 g) were obtained from Jinan Pengyue Experimental Animal Breeding Co., Ltd. The animals were maintained under controlled environmental conditions with temperature regulated at 22 ± 0.5 °C, relative humidity of 60% ± 5%, and a standardized 12-hour light/dark cycle. All subjects were provided ad libitum access to food and water throughout the experimental period. The design, conduct, and reporting of this study were performed in strict accordance with the ARRIVE 2.0 guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments). The study protocol received formal approval from the ethics committee of Qingdao Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Qingdao Hiser Hospital) (Approval No. 2022HC10LS007), with strict adherence to the ethical guidelines for experimental animals established by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Grouping and model Animal Grouping and Surgical Procedures: Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups ( n Intrathecal Catheterization: PE-10 polyethylene catheters (14 cm length) were pre-treated by wrapping 4 − 0 silk sutures at 7.5 cm from the distal end to mark insertion depth, sterilized in 75% ethanol for 15 min, and rinsed with sterile saline. Rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with 40 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium and secured in a stereotaxic frame. Following cervical disinfection, a 2–3 cm midline incision was made to expose the atlanto-occipital membrane. With the head flexed 30° ventrally, the membrane was punctured using an ophthalmic needle. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) efflux confirmed successful dural penetration, whereupon the catheter was advanced intrathecally until CSF reflux was observed. The catheter was secured by suturing deep and superficial cervical muscles, with the external orifice sealed for subsequent drug administration. SNI Model Establishment (1 Week Post-catheterization): Under pentobarbital anesthesia (40 mg/kg i.p.), the sciatic nerve and its branches (sural, common peroneal, and tibial nerves) were exposed. The common peroneal and tibial nerves were tightly ligated at their trifurcation and transected distal to the ligature, with 3–5 mm of nerve tissue excised. The sural nerve remained intact. Sham controls underwent nerve exposure without ligation. Postoperative penicillin (40,000 U/day) was administered for 3 days to prevent infection. Drug Administration: From postoperative day 1, the SNI + Ropi group received daily intrathecal injections of 0.5% ropivacaine (0.12 µl/100 g), while the SNI + NS group received equivalent volumes of normal saline, both continuing for 7 consecutive days. Threshold testing of paw withdrawal response to mechanical stimulation All experimental time points were designated as Day 0 (preoperative baseline) followed by postoperative days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14 for behavioral assessments. Prior to testing, animals were acclimated to the experimental environment for 30 min. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds were determined using calibrated Von Frey filaments (0.2–25 g range) through the up-down method as described by Chaplan et al. 18 Immunofluorescence staining technique Following anesthesia, rats underwent transcardial perfusion with 300 mL of 0.9% saline followed by 250 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde. The L4–L6 spinal cord segment was isolated for subsequent processing. After overnight post-fixation at 4 °C, tissues were cryoprotected in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 30% sucrose at 4 °C. Transverse spinal cord Sect. (20 μm thickness) were prepared using a LEICA CM1900 UV cryostat. Primary antibodies for immunofluorescence included: Iba-1 (1:400; rabbit polyclonal; ABclonal).Imaging was performed using a Sony digital camera (E3ISPM) with consistent 20× magnification. Fluorescence intensity quantification was conducted using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health) after background subtraction. For Iba-1 analysis, three randomly selected L5 spinal cord sections per animal were imaged, focusing on the dorsal horn regions. Intensity values were acquired and calculated using the ImageJ computer-assisted imaging analysis system. Western blot (WB) Spinal cord segments L4–L6 were used for subsequent experiments. Protein quantification was performed using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China). For each sample, 20 µg of protein was loaded per lane and separated on 10% or 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels before electrophoretic transfer onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes.Membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies: TRAF2 (1:10,000), Akt (1:5000), p-Akt (1:1000), IκBα (1:1000), p-IκBα (1:1000), p65 (1:5000), p-p65 (1:5000), and β-actin (1:10,000)—all rabbit polyclonal antibodies from ABclonal (Wuhan, China). Following primary antibody incubation, membranes were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000, ABclonal). Protein signals were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, IL, USA). To normalize protein loading and transfer efficiency, β-actin (1:10,000, ABclonal) was used as an internal reference. Quantitative analysis of band intensity was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Spinal cord segments L4-L6 were used for subsequent experiments. Total RNA was extracted using the AFTSpin Tissue/Cell Fast RNA Extraction Kit for Animal (ABclonal), followed by cDNA synthesis with the ABScript III RT Master Mix (ABclonal). qRT-PCR analysis was performed on the Mx3000P SYBR Green system using 2 × SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (ABclonal). The primer sequences were as follows: GAPDH (Forward: 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTCAACGGATTTGGC-3′; Reverse: 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′); TNF-α (Forward: 5′-TACTGAACTTCGGGGTGATTGGTCC-3′; Reverse: 5′-CAGCCTTGTCCCTTGAAGAGAACC-3′); IL-1β (Forward: 5′-CCTTGTGCAAGTGTCTGAAGC-3′; Reverse: 5′-CCCAAGTCAAGGGCTTGGAA-3′); IL-6 (Forward: 5′-CCAAGAGGTGAGTGCTTCCC-3′; Reverse: 5′-CTGTTGTTCAGACTCTCTCCCT-3′). Data were expressed as relative Ct values, with relative expression levels calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Behavioral assessments were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for intergroup comparisons at identical time points. Comparisons of fluorescence intensity, WB data, and qRT-PCR results were conducted using Student’s t test. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The SNI model was successfully constructed The spared nerve injury (SNI) model was surgically induced via selective ligation and transection of the tibial and common peroneal nerves while preserving the sural nerve. Mechanical withdrawal thresholds of the ipsilateral hindpaw were quantitatively assessed using von Frey filaments at baseline (preoperative day) and postoperative days 1, 3, 7, 10, and 14. Compared with the Sham group, the SNI group exhibited significant mechanical hypersensitivity from postoperative day, with sustained allodynic responses persisting through day 14 (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Changes in 50% PWMT across experimental groups.

Comparative analysis revealed that the SNI + Ropi group exhibited significant attenuation of mechanical allodynia induced by SNI compared to the SNI + NS group (Fig. 2 3  Fig. 2 Changes in 50% PWMT across experimental groups.

Quantitative analysis revealed marked microglial proliferation and activation in SNI group compared to Sham controls, accompanied by significantly elevated mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 (Fig. 4 5  Fig. 4 Following behavioral testing on day 14 post-surgery, rat spinal cord tissues were collected for: A B n p  Fig. 5 Following behavioral testing on day 14 post-surgery, rat spinal cord tissues were collected for: A B n p Ropivacaine alleviates SNI-induced neuroinflammation by suppressing NF-κB activation The experimental results demonstrated that ropivacaine effectively attenuated SNI-induced neuropathic pain and concurrently inhibited SNI-triggered neuroinflammatory responses. We hypothesized that this effect might be associated with suppression of NF-κB activation, as prior evidence indicates ropivacaine’s ability to inhibit TNF-α-stimulated NF-κB activation in cellular models 17 To validate this mechanism, we further investigated whether ropivacaine’s anti-neuroinflammatory action involves modulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. Previous studies established that TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2) is preferentially activated by transmembrane TNF-α, leading to recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to intracellular TRAF-binding domains. Subsequent TRAF2 activation stimulates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) cascade, thereby inducing IκB phosphorylation and subsequent NF-κB nuclear translocation 19 Quantitative analysis of protein expression in ipsilateral spinal cord tissue revealed significant upregulation of TRAF2, phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), phosphorylated IκBα (p-IκBα), and phosphorylated p65 (p-p65) in SNI-operated rats compared to sham controls. Given that p-IκBα degradation and p-p65 nuclear translocation are canonical hallmarks of NF-κB pathway activation 11 6  Fig. 6 Following behavioral testing on day 14 post-surgery, rat spinal cord tissues were collected for Western blot (WB) analysis. A B C n p # p Discussion The analgesic efficacy of ropivacaine in neuropathic pain management has been well-documented 16 20 21 22 23 Our findings demonstrated that a single intrathecal injection of ropivacaine provides rapid analgesic effects. Research indicates that ropivacaine exerts its analgesic properties through reversible inhibition of sodium ion influx in nerve fibers, thereby blocking action potential propagation 24 Previous studies have established that neural tissue injury triggers continuous infiltration of immune cells (including neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes) into damaged regions. These activated immune cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that bind to cytokine/chemokine receptors on nociceptors, thereby initiating pain signaling. While acute inflammation serves to eliminate pathogens and promote tissue repair, unresolved inflammatory processes contribute to chronic pain development 25 26 Furthermore, we investigated microglial activation in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn. As resident immune cells of the CNS, microglia undergo morphological changes (hypertrophy and amoeboid transformation) and proliferate following peripheral nerve injury, with increased expression of the microglial marker Iba-1 being strongly associated with neuropathic pain pathogenesis 27 The activation of the NF-κB pathway in microglia promotes the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines required for the development of hyperalgesia in the spinal dorsal horn following neural injury 8 13 28 In this study, ropivacaine attenuated SNI-induced upregulation of p65, IκBα, and phosphorylated p65 protein levels, consistent with existing evidence that ropivacaine suppresses NF-κB activation during neuropathic pain progression. Furthermore, Exploration of upstream signaling pathways revealed that ropivacaine inhibited SNI-triggered activation of the TRAF2/PI3K/Akt cascade. Coupled with the observed suppression of p-IκBα and p-p65 (Fig. 6 This study has several important limitations. First, the absence of an NF-κB pathway inhibitor control group precludes direct evidence for ropivacaine’s therapeutic efficacy in neuropathic pain through NF-κB suppression, as our findings only established a correlative rather than causative relationship between these mechanisms. Second, the use of a single concentration and dosage of ropivacaine limits the ability to determine its optimal therapeutic concentration and dosage range, particularly regarding NF-κB pathway inhibition in neuropathic pain management. Therefore, further studies are warranted to validate the critical role of ropivacaine-mediated NF-κB suppression in attenuating neuropathic pain, particularly to establish the causal relationship between NF-κB pathway inhibition and pain relief. This would further clarify its mechanistic significance in neuroinflammatory modulation and therapeutic interventions. Conclusion In summary, through the establishment of a rat model of nerve injury, we demonstrated that continuous intrathecal administration of ropivacaine produces sustained analgesic effects against neuropathic pain by suppressing neuroinflammation. The study revealed that ropivacaine significantly inhibits the activation of the TRAF2/PI3K/Akt/NF-κB signaling pathway induced by neural damage, while concurrently reducing microglial activation and downregulating the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine in the spinal dorsal horn. This research provides the first experimental evidence delineating the relationship between ropivacaine and NF-κB signaling in the context of neuropathic pain, offering novel mechanistic insights to support its clinical application for alleviating neuropathic pain through anti-inflammatory pathways.
