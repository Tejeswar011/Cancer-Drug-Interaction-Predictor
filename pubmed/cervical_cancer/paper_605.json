HPV-related cancers cause a heavy burden globally, with disparities across different cancers. We aimed to present an up-to-date global view of the patterns and incidence trends among HPV-related cancers. Methods: We collected data on HPV-related cancers from the GLOBOCAN 2022 database and the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents plus Compendium. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rate (ASIR and ASMR) were calculated to estimate the cancer burden. Spearman’s correlation tests were used to evaluate the associations with the Human Development Index (HDI). Joinpoint regression was conducted to evaluate the incidence trends in ASIR. Results: In 2022, 1,505,394 HPV-related cancer cases and 755,303 deaths were newly estimated worldwide, corresponding to an overall ASIR and ASMR of 20.9 and 10.2 per 100,000 people, respectively. Africa had the highest ASIR and ASMR compared with Asia, accounting for the most new cases and deaths. The primary cause was cervical cancer (ASIR 14.1 per 100,000 people); however, HNC exhibited the largest number of cases (685,204 cases). The total rates of HPV-related cancers were 1.3 times higher for ASIR and nearly three times higher for ASMR in low-HDI countries than in very high-HDI countries. A decreasing trend was observed for the ASIR of cervical cancer in most studied countries, compared to the increasing trends in HNC in females and anal cancer in both sexes. Conclusions: The global burden and trends of HPV-related cancers vary significantly among different cancer types according to region and sex. Particularly, cervical, HNC, and anal cancers should attract global attention. However, specific cancer types contributing to the heaviest burden should be identified at the country level to adjust resource allocation and improve access to quality health services. human papillomavirus cancer incidence burden global trend Wuxi Health Commission BJ2023097 FZXK2021010 P202314 The work was supported by grants from the Wuxi Health Commission (BJ2023097, FZXK2021010, P202314). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide [ 1 1 2 3 Cervical cancer is the second-leading cause of death among women with specific cancers [ 4 5 4 6 7 8 9 Penile cancer is usually neglected in males because of its low incidence. The incidence of penile cancer exhibits significant regional variations, with higher rates in developing countries (2.6–6.8 per 100,000 people) compared to Western developed countries (0.3 per 100,000 people) [ 10 11 12 13 HNC represents a large group of cancers, among which the oral cavity (including lips) is the most common, accounting for more than 40% of cases [ 14 15 16 Over the past few decades, tremendous changes have occurred in the global economy, society, population, and disease risk factors, leading to significant variations in the incidence and mortality rates of different types of HPV-associated cancers. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive and systematic analyses on the burden of these cancers as a cluster. We sought to estimate the global burden of HPV-associated cancers by describing the geographical disparities in incidence and mortality in 185 countries by 2022 and elucidating the incidence trends in 26 countries with eligible registered data. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Sources and Population In this population-based study, we collected updated incidence and mortality data from the GLOBOCAN 2022 database [ https://gco.iarc.who.int/en Data for the incidence trends of HPV-associated cancers in available countries from 1978 to 2017 were obtained from the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) plus. The CI5 series database includes data from cancer registries worldwide, covering a wide range of geographical locations, and specifically updates the data published in CI5 volumes, offering the latest incidence rates for selected populations. The CI5 plus database encompasses a set of comparable high-quality data on the annual incidence rates of specific cancers for 135 selected populations from 111 cancer registries, spanning the longest available timeframe up to 2017, covering all cancers and 28 significant types. The original database contains cancer cases classified by registry, sex, cancer site, 5-year age group (from 0–4, 5–9, continuing in that order to 85+ years), and person-years at risk, which can be used to calculate the ASIR. To ensure representativeness, countries were eligible for HPV-associated cancer incidence trend analysis where cancer registries covered at least 2 million inhabitants. Finally, 26 countries were included in this study. 2.2. Statistical Analysis The ASIR was calculated as per 100,000 population based on the World Standard Population first proposed by Segi (1960), using the following formula [ 17 d i i y i i w i i (1) ASIR  ( ASMR )  =  ∑ i d i w i / y i We used locally weighted regression to plot smoothed fitting curves to present the incidence trends in selected countries according to sex and cancer site. Joinpoint regression was conducted to evaluate the HPV-associated cancer incidence trends by dividing the long-term ASIR trend line into several segments at special joinpoints, each described by a continuous linear function, using the joinpoint regression program (version 5.2.0). The annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) with their corresponding 95% CIs were calculated using the joinpoint regression model to evaluate the long-term and recent period trends in HPV-associated cancer incidence in selected countries. Long-term trend refers to the longest period of HPV-associated cancer incidence data retrieved from the CI5 Plus database from 1978 to 2017. The latest 15-year period (2003–2017) was designated as the short-term trend. Spearman’s correlation tests were used to evaluate the associations between the ASIR or ASMR and the Human Development Index (HDI). All data analyses and plots were conducted using R software (version 4.3.3). 3. Results According to the estimation from the GLOBOCAN 2022, a total of 1,505,394 HPV-associated cancer cases were newly diagnosed worldwide (582,666 males and 922,728 females), representing 7.5% of all cancer cases in 2022 and having a global ASIR of 20.9 (12.5 in males and 19.0 in females) per 100,000 people ( Table S1 Figure 1 In Africa, the high incidence burden of HPV-associated cancers was mainly driven by cervical cancer, with the highest ASIR of 26.4 per 100,000 people, far higher than other cancers (˂3.5; Table S1 Globally, 755,303 people died from HPV-associated cancers in 2022 (288,540 males and 466,763 females), representing 7.8% of all cancer deaths in 2022 and corresponding to a global ASMR of 10.2 (6.1 in males and 9.2 in females) per 100,000 people ( Table S2 Figure 1 Table S2 The total ASIR of HPV-associated cancers was 1.3 times higher in countries with low HDI than countries with very high HDI (25.2 vs. 19.1 per 100,000 people; ρ = −0.308, p p Figure 2 Figure 3 Table S3 p p p p p p p p p Long-term incidence trends of HPV-associated subtype cancers are shown in Figure 4 Figure 5 Table S4 Figure 6 4. Discuss To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use high-quality population-based data to provide an up-to-date global view of the patterns and incidence trends of HPV-associated cancers. In 2022, the incidence cases and deaths of HPV-associated cancers accounted for 7.5% and 7.8% of all cancers worldwide. The results showed that Africa has the heaviest burden of HPV-associated cancers because it has the highest ASIR and ASMR. However, India and China were jointly responsible for over 50% of estimated new cases and 40% of deaths, owing to their large national populations. The overall burden was primarily caused by cervical cancer, which had the highest ASIR in 148 countries and the highest ASMR in 149 countries. The HNC group had the highest number of cancer cases. The higher ASIR and ASMR of HPV-associated cancers had significant correlations with the increasing HDI, which indicated that these identified disparities suggested uneven allocations of socioeconomic resources, diverse degrees of risk factor control, and unequal access to healthcare services across countries. Our study revealed that the total number of HNC cases exceeded that of cervical cancer and that HNC is the predominant HPV-associated cancer type in North America and Oceania. Tobacco and alcohol consumption are widely acknowledged as the main contributors to HNC worldwide [ 12 18 19 20 21 The incidence of cervical cancer has decreased worldwide and the highest ASIRs mainly occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), especially in Africa, following the results of another global analysis [ 22 23 24 25 We found that penile cancer and anal cancer together accounted for 6% of all HPV-associated cancer cases worldwide, and the ASIR increased in some studied countries. Although they are relatively rare in the general population, PLHIV and MSM are disproportionately affected by these two types of cancers, especially HIV-positive MSM [ 11 26 13 27 28 More anogenital cancers and HNC are being found to be associated with HPV infection, suggesting that HPV is playing an increasingly significant role in the development of these cancers in both sexes [ 18 1 29 30 31 32 This study had some limitations. First, while the GLOBOCAN database provides valuable insights into global cancer statistics, it has certain weaknesses that should be acknowledged and considered because of various biases, including underreporting, misclassification, and selection. Noticeably, there is potential room to improve the data availability and quality across LMICs owing to their incomplete or inaccurate registration systems. Second, although only countries with cancer registries covering at least 2 million inhabitants were eligible for incidence trends analysis, the representativeness is still insufficient for entire countries with large populations such as India and China. Especially within the same country, owing to racial and cultural differences, there are also significant variations in incidence rates [ 33 5. Conclusions HPV-associated cancers pose a significant global burden, with variations in cancer subtypes affecting different countries. The burden of cervical cancer remained the highest, while the burden of HNC and anal cancer showed an upward trend. All countries still need to invest more resources to continue expanding the coverage of HPV vaccine programs through promoting “gender-neutral” HPV immunization in both sexes, along with recommending screening for cervical and anal cancers among at-risk populations. Effectively mobilizing, coordinating, and allocating resources to facilitate the equitable distribution of health resources across different HDI regions, especially in LMICs, is crucial for the globally synchronized prevention of HPV-associated cancers.
