Background As of the present moment, Jordan is yet to incorporate cervical cancer screening in its cancer control program nor advocates for vaccines. This paper aims to examines the perceptions and attitudes of medical students towards HPV and its vaccine. Methods We conducted a cross-examination of HPV knowledge and vaccine uptake among medical students across the period between January and March 2024. Participants completed a questionnaire developed and validated by the existing literature. The questionnaire was composed of 4 domains pertaining to sociodemographic, knowledge of HPV, knowledge of HPV vaccine, and attitudes. Medical students were conveniently sampled from Jordan’s six public medical schools. Predictors to self-vaccinate, recommending vaccination to friends/family, and recommending vaccination to patients were examined using a binary logistic regression model. All analyses were conducted on R version (4.3.3). Results A total of 473 medical students were included in the final analysis. On a scale of 12 and 8, mean HPV and vaccine knowledge scores were 5.4 ± 3.1 and 2.9 ± 1.9, respectively. Knowledge of HPV and its vaccine were significantly higher among females, students in their clinical years, and those with self-perceived understanding of HPV (all p <0.05). Intention to self-vaccinate against HPV was predicted by higher HPV and vaccine knowledge scores. Male participants were significantly less likely to self-vaccinate compared to females (OR: 0.61; 95%CI: 0.40 – 0.91). Similarly, higher HPV and vaccine knowledge scores were associated a higher likelihood to recommend the vaccine to family or patients. On the other hand, male participants were significantly less likely to recommend the vaccine to patients compared to their female counterparts (OR: 0.62; 95%CI: 0.40 – 0.95). Conclusion The study implies that the overall awareness and attitudes regarding HPV and its vaccine is alarmingly poor among medical students. Moreover, there exists a gender difference in the knowledge and attitudes favoring females. Concerned policy makers and institutions should strive to improve vaccine awareness and uptake through informational, behavioral, and environmental interventions. Moreover, medical students should be well equipped to tackle HPV vaccine hesitancy through curricular reforms, targeted training, and increased exposure to public vaccine promotional efforts. human papilloma virus Jordan medical education knowledge vaccine Karolinska Institutet 10.13039/501100004047 The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

These include financial restraints, poor infrastructure, competition with other vaccines, and general lack of awareness ( Abdelaziz et al., 2025 Sallam et al., 2022 While exact numbers on HPV infections and HPV-associated cancers in Jordan are currently unavailable, one study of 650 cases referred from gynecology clinics found HPV in 25.7% of native Jordanians’ samples ( Annab et al., 2025 HPV Information Centre CDC, 2025 Currently, Jordan lacks a national screening program for cervical cancer nor includes HPV as part of its national immunization policy. Moreover, this is complicated by the lack of reliable data and updates on the prevalence of HPV across the kingdom ( Mahafzah et al., 2008 Qaqish et al., 2023 Methods Study settings Medical education in Jordan has evolved in the last 50 years with the establishment of several medical schools and teaching hospitals around the country. Currently in Jordan, there are approximately 10,000 medical students, with 1500 graduates per year ( Sarhan et al., 2025 Study design A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between January and March 2024. This design was selected to provide a snapshot of the current awareness and attitudes towards HPV because it is practical and cost-effectiveness for establishing baseline data on HPV knowledge and vaccine uptake. Measurement tool The questionnaire for this study (  Supplementary 1 Khalil et al., 2023 Nesser and Ayodele, 2023 Qaqish et al., 2023 Albayat et al., 2024 The domains and items comprising the HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge scores were examined for content validity and reliability. Results from the expert committee assessment revealed a Scale – Content Validity Index for the HPV and HPV vaccine knowledge scales of 0.831 and 0.764, respectively. After ensuring content validity, the questionnaire was pilot tested on 20 medical students for confirm clarity, understandability, relevance, and reliability prior to initiating data collection. Cronbach’s α values for the HPV knowledge and HPV vaccine knowledge domains were 0.756 and 0.692, respectively. The final tool was comprised of 4 domains pertaining to sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge regarding HPV infection and vaccine, attitudes towards HPV infection and vaccine. The sociodemographic domain included among others questions about sex, age, country of origin, marital status, as well as the level of study and the university attended by each participant. The 2 nd rd Sample size and data collection Given the descriptive nature of our study and the logistical challenges of surveying medical students with demanding schedules, convenience sampling provided a practical and cost-effective solution. However, we acknowledge that convenience sampling may introduce some limitations, and we discussed these in a subsection of the discussion. A minimum of 384 responses was determined using Cochran’s formula (N = (Z 2 2 The data was collected using an Arabic self-administered online survey, which was placed on Google Forms and disseminated through the official WhatsApp, Facebook, and Microsoft Teams groups for all six medical schools included in the study. The inclusion criteria were: Full-time registered undergraduate medical students aged 18 years and above from all six public medical schools in Jordan. We targeted medical students from both the basic years (1 st rd th th Ethical considerations This study was approved by Institutional Review Boards (IRB) of the Hashemite University (No. 22/7/2021/2022) and the University of Jordan (No.446/2024/2025). All the participants provided a written consent prior to participating in this study. The researchers adhered to strict ethical guidelines and ensured the anonymity of all participants. Statistical analysis Data was imported in and analyzed using R (version 4.3.3). Continuous variables were summarized as mean and standard deviation, while categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. Associations between categorical variables were assessed using the chi-squared test. Mean differences (MD) in continuous variables were assessed using the independent sample-t test. Predictors to self-vaccinate, recommending vaccination to friends/family, and recommending vaccination to patients were examined using a binary logistic regression model. Each predictor variable was expressed using odds ratios (OR) and their associated 95% confidence interval (95%CI). Figures were produced using GraphPrism 8.3.4. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Characteristics of the included sample A total of 473 medical students were included in the final analysis with a male-to-female ratio of 0.76-to-1.00 (43.3%-to-56.7%). The majority of participating medical students were single (97.5%), of Jordanian origin (91.1%), and studying at the basic medical sciences level (64.5%). While 53.5 were older than 20 years, 46.5% were younger than 20 years of age. In terms of sampled medical schools, most participants were recruited from the Hashemite University (68.7%), University of Jordan (13.1%), and Yarmouk University (9.7%). The other participants were recruited from Al-Balqa’ Applied University (5.1%), Jordan University of Science and Technology (3.0%), and Mutah University (0.4%). When asked about their sources on HPV-related knowledge, medical education (56.4%), self-reading (23.3%), and social media (12.9%) were the most common.

Of all included participants, only 27.5% believed that HPV is common in Jordan, 35.7% being neutral, and 36.8% disagreeing. In terms of infection susceptibility, 68.7% of students believe that HPV could affect both males and females, while 15.6% and 2.3% stated that it can only affect females or males, respectively. Moreover, 58.6% of participants recognized that HPV could be asymptomatic and 54.8% knew that sexual intercourse is not the only medium for virus transmission. Among the latter, skin-to-skin transmission was recognized by 45.0%, skin-to-mucosa transmission by 56.1%, mother-to-fetus transmission by 48.6%, transmission through contaminated medical equipment by 49.1%, transmission through contaminated water by 20.1%, and transmission through self-inoculation by 36.6%. When asked about the most important risk of HPV in females, cancer (52.6%) was most perceived compared to genital warts (18.8%) or skin warts (6.6%). On the other hand, when asked about the most important risk of HPV in males, 38.3% noted genital warts, 14.4% reported skin warts, and only 13.5% considered cancer. In terms of HPV treatment, 55.8% of participants believed that it can be cured compared to 30.0% neutral participants and 14.2% denying such possibility. Finally, only 27.9% of participants correctly recognized that cervical cytology should be conducted once every three years.  Table 2 Table 2 Responses to items pertaining to knowledge of HPV.

Participants in their clinical years had significantly higher knowledge scores compared to their counterparts in basic years (MD: -2.92; 95%CI: -3.45 – -2.38). Similarly, female participants had significantly higher knowledge scores than their male counterparts (MD: 1.07; 95%CI: 0.51 – 1.64). Finally, participants with perceived familiarity of HPV had higher knowledge scores compared to their counterparts (MD: -3.84; 95%CI: -4.37 – -3.31). There were no significant differences in knowledge scores in terms of nationality or marital status (p = 0.142 and 0.753, respectively). Knowledge of HPV vaccine Among included participants, 49.0% noted a self-perceived familiarity with HPV vaccine, 30.9% did not, while 20.1% were neutral. The majority of participants did not know if the vaccine is protective for persons infected with HPV, while 35.9% responded that it isn’t. About 27.7% believed that individuals with HPV-related genital warts are indicated to take the vaccine. Similarly, only 25.2% believe that there exist indications for vaccinating young males. While 41.9% recognized the most optimal time for HPV vaccination, 33.6% were neutral, 15.6% reported “after marriage/sexual activity”, and 8.9% recommended vaccination of children under the age of 8 years. In terms of vaccine dosage, an optimal dose of three was recognized as the most optimal by 55.4% of participants. The majority of participants believed that persons between the ages of 14 to 45 should be vaccinated against HPV-related disease (56.9%). Nonetheless, only 16.9% were able to recognize the estimated percentage of prevented cervical cancers by the vaccine at 90%. Similarly, only 31.3% of participants knew that the HPV vaccine is available in Jordan.  Table 3 Table 3 Responses to items pertaining to knowledge of HPV vaccine.

Participants in their clinical years had significantly higher vaccine knowledge scores compared to their counterparts in basic years (MD: -1.45; 95%CI: -1.79 – -1.12). Similarly, female participants had significantly higher vaccine knowledge scores than their male counterparts (MD: 0.34; 95%CI: 0.01 – 0.68). Finally, participants with perceived familiarity of HPV had higher vaccine knowledge scores compared to their counterparts (MD: -1.62; 95%CI: -1.92 – -1.31). There were no significant differences in vaccine knowledge scores in terms of nationality or marital status (p = 0.151 and 0.764, respectively). Attitudes towards HPV vaccination About 42.1% of participants believe that it should be obligatory to vaccinate against HPV while 24.7% disagreed with such notion. When asked about the possibility of self-vaccination, 39.3% would take the HPV vaccine if its available for free in Jordan. Among those that declined such possibility, being a virgin (56.7%), having no extra marital sex (45.2%), and not being a female (35.4%) were the most common reasons for rejecting the vaccine (  Figure 1 Figure 1 Most commonly reported barriers for self-vaccination against HPV. Bar chart illustrating reasons for hesitation towards HPVvaccination among the study participants. Categories include being a virgin, not having extramarital sex, not being female, doubting vaccine efficacy, doubting vaccine safety, and cost. Responses are divided into “Yes,” “No,” and “I don't know,” with percentage labelsfor each. Moreover, 56.7% would recommend the vaccine to a family member, while 59.4% would recommend it to patients. Among those that would not recommend the vaccine to a family member, doubts about the vaccine safety (23.9%) and efficacy (22.1%) were prevalent (  Figure 2 Figure 2 Most commonly reported barriers to recommending HPV vaccines to (A) (B) Bar graphs labeled A and B compare responses to the common barriers to recommending HPV vaccines to (A) friends and family and (B) patients. These barriers include Efficacy, Safety, and Cultural/Religious. In both graph A and graph B most responses were “I don't know,” followed by “No,” and lastly “Yes”. Predictors of intention to vaccinate Intention to self-vaccinate against HPV was predicted by higher HPV knowledge scores (OR: 1.12; 95%CI: 1.03 – 1.22) and higher vaccine knowledge scores (OR: 1.20; 95%CI: 1.06 – 1.36). Male participants were significantly less likely to self-vaccinate compared to females (OR: 0.61; 95%CI: 0.40 – 0.91). Similarly, participants with higher HPV knowledge scores (OR: 1.14; 95%CI: 1.05 – 1.23), higher HPV vaccine knowledge scores (OR: 1.26; 95%CI: 1.10 – 1.43), and are in their clinical studies (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.05 – 2.70) were more likely to recommend the HPV vaccine to their family. Conversely, single participants were less likely to recommend that vaccine to family (OR: 0.18; 95%CI: 0.03 – 0.93). Finally, participants with higher HPV knowledge scores (OR: 1.16; 95%CI: 1.07 – 1.26), higher HPV vaccine knowledge scores (OR: 1.29; 95%CI: 1.12 – 1.47), and are in their clinical studies (OR: 1.80; 95%CI: 1.10 – 2.95) were more likely to recommend the HPV vaccine to their patients. On the other hand, male participants were significantly less likely to recommend the vaccine to patients compared to their female counterparts (OR: 0.62; 95%CI: 0.40 – 0.95).

Discussion In this study, we demonstrated an alarming gap in HPV and vaccine knowledge among medical students. Only 72.3% were aware of the disease, while only 49.0% were aware of the vaccine. Significant knowledge gaps exist for epidemiology, treatment, transmission, and vaccination for HPV. Intention to self-vaccinate was lower than willingness to recommend the vaccine to family or patients. Factors associated with intention to vaccinate or recommending the vaccine were female gender, higher knowledge scores, and being in the clinical phase of undergraduate medical studies. These findings, while alarming, are parallel to the existing body of literature. Poor HPV awareness, vaccine knowledge, and subpar intention to vaccinate were documented among university students in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Iran, Morocco, Oman, Bahrain, and India ( Ghojazadeh et al., 2012 Rashid et al., 2016 Alshammari and Khan, 2022 Bencherit et al., 2022 El Mansouri et al., 2022 Yacouti et al., 2022 Alsanafi et al., 2023 Alghalyini et al., 2024 Cheema et al., 2024 Mehta et al., 2013 Farsi et al., 2021 Haddad et al., 2022 Abdelaziz et al., 2025 Abi Jaoude et al., 2018 Hamdi, 2017 On a more locally focused note, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is known for an extremely limited cancer screening and prevention program, which only pertains to breast cancer ( Al-Shamsi et al., 2022 Gamaoun, 2018 Murewanhema et al., 2024 Across the literature, females demonstrated significantly higher knowledge of HPV and its associated vaccine compared to males ( Rashid et al., 2016 Dai et al., 2022 Teeluck et al., 2022 Alghalyini et al., 2024 Chen et al., 2024 Al-Sabbagh et al., 2021 Oh et al., 2023 Rashid et al., 2016 There is a consistent trend throughout the literature for a higher intention to vaccinate among those with biological/medical backgrounds, university degrees, or have received dedicated sexual education courses ( Rashid et al., 2016 Dai et al., 2022 El Mansouri et al., 2022 Yacouti et al., 2022 Chen et al., 2024 Ajzen, 1991 Shah et al., 2021 Orji et al., 2025 Othman et al., 2022 Moreover, a number of studies throughout the MENA region documented the role of conspiracy theories in augmenting vaccine hesitancy/resistance. Embracing vaccine conspiracies and vaccine resistance was documented for the COVID-19 vaccine, influenza vaccine, and the HPV vaccine ( Knobel et al., 2022 Pertwee et al., 2022 Alsanafi et al., 2023 Alshehri and Sallam, 2023 Alsanafi et al., 2023 Jordan and so does many of the MENA countries require extensive efforts in promoting HPV knowledge and vaccine uptake. According to the Community Guide’s Data Abstraction (CGDA) framework, improving the status of HPV awareness and vaccine uptake must rely on through phases of evidence-based interventions: informational, behavioral, and environmental ( Cheema et al., 2024 Wang et al., 2021 Chen et al., 2024 Wang et al., 2021 Abdullahi et al., 2020 Rani et al., 2022 At the behavioral level, the patient-healthcare provider relationship must be revamped to further increase vaccine uptake and general knowledge through providing cues to action ( Al-Sabbagh et al., 2021 Al-Ani et al., 2024 Reno et al., 2019 At the level of medical students, policy makers and university administrations should revise and re-develop their existing curriculums. Medical students, which are considered future practitioners, should be well equipped to prevent HPV across both themselves and their future patients. The content, approach, and style of medical educational materials could be improved as to provide these students with the necessary evidence and theoretical basis for circumventing the disease ( Solis-Torres et al., 2024 Abdelaziz et al., 2025 Abdelaziz et al., 2025 In light of what’s above, our findings should be interpreted within the context of a number of limitations. These include the cross-sectional nature of study’s design, close-ended questionnaire, and due to logistics, inability of the questionnaire to account for all factors affecting HPV knowledge. Participants may also demonstrate social desirability bias or a neutral bias which might have distorted responses or compromised data accuracy. Additionally, due to the fact that this study is comprised of medical students only, its results cannot be generalized to other university students in non-medical fields or even other medical fields such as nursing or pharmacy. The use of convenience sampling and the over-representation of students from the Hashemite University may also limit the external validity of our findings to all medical students. Certain demographics of students may have been missed by the sampling strategy and since each Jordanian University represents a number of Jordanian prefectures, the over-representation of students from one university may produce results that may not be replicable in other Jordanian institutions. Finally, due to the different answer scales for some questions, the questionnaire was not subjected to an exploratory factor analysis to quantitatively measure its construct validity. Conclusion The study implies that the overall awareness and attitudes regarding HPV and its vaccine is alarmingly poor among medical students. Moreover, there exists a gender difference in the knowledge and attitudes favoring females. Our findings call for an urgent need for qualitative research to explore the barriers and facilitators to vaccination. This is necessary for designing multi-faceted, context sensitive, evidence-based interventions at the informational, behavioral, and environmental levels from all concerned authorities to improve knowledge of HPV among young adults and increase vaccine uptake.
