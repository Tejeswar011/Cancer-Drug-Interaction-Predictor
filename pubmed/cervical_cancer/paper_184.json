Despite growing attention, the etiology and underlying mechanisms of RCC remain incompletely understood. Epigenetic modifications, particularly DNA methylation, have emerged as critical regulators in various malignancies, including RCC. Sperm-associated antigen 6 (SPAG6), initially identified in human testicular tissue and considered a marker for testicular tumors, has been associated with the pathophysiology of several malignancies. This study aimed to elucidate the role of aberrant SPAG6 methylation in RCC progression. Methods We first analyzed SPAG6 expression and methylation patterns in RCC and adjacent normal tissues using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Epigenome-Wide Association Study (EWAS) databases. Clinical tissue specimens from Peking University First Hospital were then examined to explore the association between SPAG6 expression/methylation and the clinicopathological features of RCC patients. The correlation between SPAG6 expression and promoter methylation was further validated in RCC cell lines. Functional roles of SPAG6 in cell proliferation, invasion, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis were investigated through in vitro cellular assays and in vivo xenograft models. Finally, transcriptome sequencing was performed to explore the molecular mechanisms by which SPAG6 affects RCC development. Results SPAG6 expression was markedly downregulated in RCC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumorous counterparts, because of promoter CpG hypermethylation. SPAG6 expression was associated with tumor stage in RCC patients. Functional assays demonstrated that SPAG6 suppresses RCC cell proliferation, invasion, and cell cycle progression, while promoting apoptosis. Mechanistically, SPAG6 inhibited RCC progression by negatively regulating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Conclusions SPAG6 functions as a tumor suppressor in RCC, with its silencing driven by promoter hypermethylation. Through modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, SPAG6 plays a vital role in restraining RCC initiation and progression.

Introduction Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) constitutes between 3–5% of adult malignancies and represents over 90% of all renal tumors [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 The concept of epigenetics, first introduced by C. Waddington in 1942, refers to modifications in gene expression that occur without changes to the fundamental DNA sequence. Such mechanisms are essential for cellular differentiation and proliferation, and like genetic mutations, play critical roles in disease progression. Epigenetic regulation operates at multiple levels, ranging from direct DNA modifications to higher-order chromatin remodeling and diverse forms of RNA modification [ 9 11 7 12 13 14 15 Sperm-associated antigen 6 (SPAG6), initially identified in human testicular tissue, has been proposed as a marker for testicular tumors [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 24 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Bioinformatic analyses data were sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, accessed through the UALCAN portal ( http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/ http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/ https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ewas/datahub 2.2. Cell lines and cell culture Normal renal epithelial cell lines HK-2 and HEK293, along with RCC cell lines 786-O, ACHN, caki-1, and OSRC-2, were acquired from Peking University First Hospital. All these cell lines were cultured in DMEM (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (Gibco BRL), under standard humidified conditions at 37°C with 5% CO₂. To reduce the methylation level of RCC cells, these cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10⁵ cells/mL in 6-well plates. After 24 hours, RCC cells were treated with 2 μM 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 72 hours, with the drug-containing medium replaced daily. 2.3. Human RCC specimens Following the acquisition of informed consent from 60 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy at Peking University First Hospital, we collected sixty pairs of RCC tumor tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues. The cohort included 33 male and 27 female patients. Thirty-one patients were aged ≤60 years, and 29 were >60 years. Tumor staging revealed 12 cases of T1, 21 of T2, 23 of T3, and 4 of T4. Tumor sizes were ≤5 cm in 31 patients and >5 cm in 29 patients. Histological grading included 10 of G1, 22 of G2, 23 of G3, and 5 of G4 cases. All patient samples used in this study were collected with prior informed consent, and subsequent analyses and data collection were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and relevant institutional and national ethical guidelines. The Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital approved this study. 2.4. Cell viability assays Stable Caki-1 and OSRC-2 cell lines were inoculated into 96-well plates at a cellular density of 2,000 cells per well. Following cellular adhesion, 10 µL of the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Kumamoto, Japan) reagent was introduced into each well containing 100 µL of complete culture medium. Post a 1-hour incubation period under dark conditions, the optical density was quantified at a wavelength of 450 nm utilizing a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek, USA). Cellular viability was evaluated at time intervals of 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. 2.5. Colony formation assays Stable Caki-1 and OSRC-2 cell lines were plated at a density of 1,000 cells per well in 6-well culture plates and cultivated for a period of 10 days. The resultant colonies were subsequently immobilized with 4% paraformaldehyde for a duration of 10 minutes and subjected to staining with crystal violet for 30 minutes. Following a washing step, the colonies were visualized and enumerated using a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI4000B, Milton Keynes, UK). 2.6. Wound-healing assay Stable Caki-1 and OSRC-2 cell lines were inoculated into 6-well culture plates at a cellular density of 1 × 105 cells per well. Upon achieving greater than 90% cellular confluence, a vertical scratch wound was introduced at the center of each well using a sterile 1 mL pipette tip. The cells were subsequently rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and maintained in a serum-free medium. The progression of wound closure was observed and documented at 0, 24, and 48-hour intervals utilizing an inverted microscope (Leica DMI4000B). 2.7. Transwell migration assay The evaluation of cellular migration was conducted utilizing Transwell inserts with an 8-µm pore size (BD Sciences, Bedford, MA, USA) positioned within 24-well culture plates. A suspension of 4 × 104 cells in serum-free medium was introduced into the upper chamber, while the lower chamber was filled with 700 µL of medium enriched with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Following a 24-hour incubation period, non-migratory cells present on the upper membrane surface were meticulously removed using a cotton swab. Migrated cells adhering to the underside of the membrane were subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and subjected to crystal violet staining for 30 minutes. Visual documentation and quantification of the migrated cells were performed using a phase-contrast microscope (Leica DMI4000B). 2.8. qRT-PCR Total RNA was isolated utilizing the TRIzol reagent (Fisher Scientific, USA). Subsequent reverse transcription was executed with the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses were performed employing the KAPA SYBR Green FAST qPCR Kit (KAPA, Wilmington, MA, USA), adhering to the manufacturer’s protocols, and facilitated by the CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). GAPDH served as the endogenous control for normalization purposes. The quantification of relative gene expression levels was accomplished using the method, with normalization against GAPDH expression. The primer sequences utilized are detailed in S1 Table. 2.9. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was executed utilizing AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, USA). The thermal cycling protocol consisted of an initial denaturation phase at 95°C for 10 minutes, followed by 42 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 48°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds, culminating in a final extension step at 72°C for 5 minutes. For the quantitative assessment of SPAG6 methylation, bisulfite genomic sequencing (BGS) was performed. The resultant PCR amplicons were subsequently cloned into the pEASY-T5 zero-background vector, with six discrete clones arbitrarily chosen for sequencing (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The primer sequences employed for MSP and BGS are enumerated in S1 Table. 2.10. Stable cell lines plasmid constructs The SPAG6 overexpression plasmid was procured from Jikai Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Caki-1 and OSRC-2 cell lines were inoculated into 6-well culture plates and subsequently transfected with either an empty vector, serving as the control, or the SPAG6 overexpression plasmid, utilizing Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at a final DNA concentration of 4 µg. Following a 48-hour post-transfection period, puromycin was introduced to facilitate the selection of cells stably expressing SPAG6, which were then maintained in culture for an additional three days. 2.11. Cell cycle and cell apoptosis Cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were assessed by flow cytometry. For apoptosis analysis, SPAG6-overexpressing and control cells were harvested with EDTA-free trypsin, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with FITC-conjugated Annexin V (BD Pharmingen) and propidium iodide (PI) for 30 minutes at room temperature in the dark. For cell cycle analysis, cells were digested with trypsin, washed with PBS, and fixed overnight in 70% ice-cold ethanol. After washing twice with PBS, cells were stained with PI in the dark for 30 minutes. All flow cytometry data were collected using a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, USA). 2.12. Western blot Equal amounts of total protein (20 μg per lane) were separated via 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto 0.2 μm PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated sequentially with primary and secondary antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using the EasySee Western Blot Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) and detected with a chemiluminescent imaging system (Bio-Rad, CA, USA).antibodies used in this study are: SPAG6(1:1000 dilution ratio) (ab155653; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), total AKT (1:1000 dilution ratio) (4691; Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-AKT (1:1000 dilution ratio) (4060; Cell Signaling Technology), PI3K (1:1000 dilution ratio) (4257; Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-PI3K (1:1000 dilution ratio) (4228; Cell Signaling Technology), mTOR (1:1000 dilution ratio) (2983; Cell Signaling Technology), phospho-mTOR (1:1000 dilution ratio) (5536; Cell Signaling Technology), E-cadherin (1:1000 dilution ratio) (3195; Cell Signaling Technology), N-cadherin (1:5000 dilution ratio) (13116; Cell Signaling Technology), vimentin (1:1000 dilution ratio) (5741; Cell Signaling Technology)and GAPDH (1:1000 dilution ratio) (5174S; Cell Signaling Technology). The secondary antibodies were Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) (1:2000 dilution ratio) (ab205718; Abcam) and Goat Anti-Mouse IgG H&L (HRP) (1:2000 dilution ratio) (ab205719; Abcam). 2.13. In vivo experiment To investigate whether SPAG6 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, both subcutaneous xenograft and pulmonary metastasis mouse models were established. A total of 25 four-week-old male NDG mice (Biocytogen Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) were housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility at the Animal Experiment Center of Peking University First Hospital. For the tumorigenesis experiment, six mice per group (control and SPAG6 overexpression) were injected subcutaneously with 1.0 × 10⁷ OSRC-2 cells (transfected with either empty vector or SPAG6 overexpression vector) suspended in 150 μL serum-free medium containing 50% Matrigel. To ensure the welfare of the animals, after four weeks, all procedures were performed under anesthesia using, specific anesthetic, 2% isoflurane via inhalation with continuous monitoring of vital signs. Post-operative analgesia was provided using buprenorphine at 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours for 48 hours. Humane endpoints were strictly enforced, including tumor size, weight loss, or signs of distress. Animals were euthanized using 99% CO₂ inhalation at a flow rate of 12.2 L/min, followed by cervical dislocation to ensure death. In accordance with institutional guidelines and approved protocols for animal welfare, and primary tumors were excised and weighed for evaluation. To assess the anti-metastatic effect of SPAG6 in vivo, a lung metastasis model was constructed. Six mice per group received tail vein injections of 1.0 × 10⁶ OSRC-2 cells (empty vector or SPAG6 overexpression), suspended in 150 μL sterile PBS. After four weeks, in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging was performed to assess metastatic burden. All animal experiments in this study were approved by the institutional ethics committee and conducted in strict accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations governing the care and use of laboratory animals. All methods are reported by the ARRIVE guidelines. The Laboratory Animal Ethics Committee of Peking University First Hospital approved the animal studies in this study. 2.14. RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed by Novogene (Beijing, China). Total RNA integrity was assessed using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). For each sample, 3 μg of total RNA was used as input material for cDNA library construction. Library quality was verified on the Bioanalyzer 2100 system, and validated libraries were pooled according to effective concentration and target data volume for Illumina sequencing. Sequencing was conducted using the Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS) method. Fluorescently labeled dNTPs, DNA polymerase, and adaptor primers were added to the flow cell for cluster amplification. During synthesis, the incorporation of each labeled dNTP emits a distinct fluorescent signal, which is captured by the sequencer and translated into sequence reads using specialized software. The raw transcriptomic sequencing data have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database, as requested.

Continuous data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD), and categorical variables are expressed as counts and percentages. Statistical differences between experimental and control groups were assessed using Student’s t-test and Dunnett’s test. 3. Results 3.1. SPAG6 expression was downregulated in RCC and correlated with clinicopathological features and favorable prognosis Our findings align with emerging evidence of SPAG6’s tumor-suppressive role across malignancies [ 25 26 Fig 1A Fig 1B 1D Fig 1E 1F Fig 1G 10.1371/journal.pone.0333202.g001 Fig 1 SPAG6 Expression and Prognostic Significance in Renal Cell Carcinoma (A) The expression of SPAG6 in renal carcinoma from TCGA.

SPAG6 downregulation in RCC was mediated by promoter CpG methylation The observed inverse correlation between SPAG6 methylation and expression, coupled with transcriptional reactivation following 5-aza treatment, is characteristic of methylation-dependent gene repression [ 27 28 Fig 2A Fig 2B 2C Fig 2D Fig 2E 10.1371/journal.pone.0333202.g002 Fig 2 Epigenetic Regulation of SPAG6 via Promoter Methylation and Its Prognostic Relevance in RCC (A) The promoter methylation status of SPAG6 in renal carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Next, we observed the cohort of 60 RCC tissue samples, SPAG6 methylation exhibited a positive correlation with clinical tumor stage and pathological grade (S2 Table). Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) further confirmed that RCC cell lines exhibited higher SPAG6 methylation levels compared to normal renal cell lines ( Fig 3A Fig 3B Fig 3C Fig 3D 3F 10.1371/journal.pone.0333202.g003 Fig 3 SPAG6 Promoter Methylation in RCC Models and Functional Demethylation by 5-Aza-dC (F) The methylation level of SPAG6 in renal cancer cell lines and normal cell lines (G) The methylation level of SPAG6 in RCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues.

SPAG6 inhibited proliferation of RCC cells It was demonstrating that SPAG6-mediated suppression of RCC proliferation aligns with its emerging tumor-suppressive role across malignancies. Consistent with findings in hepatocellular carcinoma, [ 24 26 Fig 4A 4B Fig 4C 4D Fig 4E 4F 10.1371/journal.pone.0333202.g004 Fig 4 SPAG6 Overexpression Inhibits Proliferation in Renal Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines (A) The SPAG6 overexpression efficiency in RCC cell lines.

SPAG6 suppressed the invasion and migration of RCC cells The suppression of RCC cell invasion and migration by SPAG6 overexpression, accompanied by E-cadherin upregulation and N-cadherin/vimentin downregulation, aligns with its emerging role as an EMT regulator in solid tumors. Similar inhibition of metastasis by SPAG6 via EMT modulation has been documented in breast cancer [ 29 Fig 5A 5F Fig 5G 5H 10.1371/journal.pone.0333202.g005 Fig 5 SPAG6 Overexpression Suppresses Invasion and Migration in Renal Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines (A, B) The effect of SPAG6 on invasion in RCC cell lines, as determined by a wound healing assay.

SPAG6 induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in RCC cells To investigate the effect of SPAG6 on cell apoptosis, Flow cytometric analysis was conducted. The results revealed that SPAG6-overexpressing RCC cells displayed a significantly higher apoptotic rate compared to control cells ( Fig 6A 6B Fig 6C D 10.1371/journal.pone.0333202.g006 Fig 6 SPAG6 Overexpression Induces Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest in Renal Cell Carcinoma Cell Lines (A) The effect of SPAG6 on apoptosis in RCC cell lines, as determined by flow cytometric analyses.

SPAG6 could exert tumor-suppressive effects in vivo We established a subcutaneous xenograft model to evaluate the tumor-suppressive function of SPAG6 in vivo. OSRC-2 cells transfected with SPAG6 were subcutaneously injected into NDG mice, while OSRC-2 cells transfected with an empty vector served as the negative control. Four weeks later, tumors in the SPAG6 overexpression group were markedly smaller and lighter relative to the control group ( Fig 7A D Fig 7E 10.1371/journal.pone.0333202.g007 Fig 7 SPAG6 Overexpression Inhibits Tumor Progression and Metastatic Spread in RCC Xenografts (A, B) The volume and weight of tumours in NDG mice in the SPAG6 overexpressing group and control group (B) Tumor weight (C, D) The fluorescence intensity in the lungs of NDG mice injected with cells with SPAG6 overexpression and control cells.

SPAG6 suppressed tumor progression by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway Our data positioning SPAG6 as a novel inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade aligns with this pathway’s established role as a master regulator of RCC progression. The observed suppression of PI3K/AKT/mTOR phosphorylation upon SPAG6 overexpression mirrors the activity of canonical tumor suppressors [ 30 31 Fig 8A 8B Fig 8C 8D 10.1371/journal.pone.0333202.g008 Fig 8 SPAG6 Exerts Antitumor Effects by Suppressing the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Axis in Renal Cell Carcinoma (A) Transcriptome sequencing in renal cancer cell lines overexpressing SPAG6 (B) KEGG functional enrichment analyses of the differentially expressed genes.

Discussion SPAG6 has been implicated in various malignancies, though most studies to date have focused on its role in hematological cancers. Detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) is essential for the diagnosis and management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and SPAG6 has been identified as a prospective biomarker for detecting MRD in pediatric AML patients [ 32 24 26 33 19 Epigenetic dysregulation, including aberrant DNA methylation, is increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer. DNA methylation is one of the most thoroughly studied epigenetic mechanisms [ 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 Among oncogenic signaling cascades, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is one of the most frequently dysregulated across human cancers and plays a central role in tumor initiation and progression [ 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 47 50 51 52 Beyond its role in tumorigenesis and progression, aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway has been shown to impair tumor sensitivity to conventional therapies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In RCC, while surgical resection remains the primary treatment modality, systemic therapies play a critical role, particularly in advanced stages. However, RCC is notoriously resistant to traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway, as a primary modulator of angiogenesis, has been associated with the initiation and progression of RCC. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), target VEGF signaling and tumor angiogenesis and are widely used as first-line therapies for advanced clear cell RCC (ccRCC) [ 53 54 55 56 57 58 In conclusion, our study demonstrated the tumor-suppressive function of SPAG6 in RCC and revealed the epigenetic silencing via promoter methylation. We also discovered the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as a key downstream target through which SPAG6 exerts its inhibitory effects on RCC progression. The results revealed that SPAG6 presents significant potential as both a diagnostic and therapeutic target in RCC. Despite these insights, several important questions remain. Future studies should aim to identify the direct molecular targets of SPAG6 and clarify how these targets interface with the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. A deeper understanding of this regulatory network may further illuminate SPAG6’s role in RCC biology and contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. In addition, transcriptomic analysis of SPAG6-overexpressing RCC cells revealed differential expression of genes involved in DNA damage repair and other potentially relevant signaling pathways, offering promising avenues for further investigation.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters) Reviewer #1: Novel topic: The first systematic study on the epigenetic regulation mechanism of SPAG6 in RCC The research design system and methodology are solid, and the evidence chain is complete: starting with bioinformatics analysis of TCGA/EWAS databases, combining clinical samples, cell experiments, mouse models, and then transcriptome sequencing and functional enrichment analysis, multi-level data is integrated to ensure the scientific and credible nature of the conclusions. Comprehensive types of experiments, including CCK8, clone formation, scratch experiments Transwell、 Flow cytometry, Western blot, BGS, MSP, etc., with clear logic. In vivo experiments, it has been shown to have inhibitory effects on tumor growth and lung metastasis, enhancing clinical transferability. In depth mechanism: not only did we discover the anticancer effect of SPAG6, but we also elucidated its function by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway Clear clinical significance: providing new methylation markers for RCC diagnosis and potential targets for treatment Reviewer #2: The authors found that SPAG6 functions as a tumor suppressor in RCC, with its silencing driven by promoter hypermethylation. Through modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, SPAG6 plays a vital role in restraining RCC initiation and progression, the design and results are good. And I only had one concern, the images of western blot should be improved in Figure 5G and 8C. ********** 6.

Please provide additional information regarding the experiments involving animals and ensure you have included details on (methods of anesthesia and/or analgesia, and efforts to alleviate suffering.\" Reply: Respected Editor, we have revised the instructions and made changes in the manuscript. Hope it will be according to the editor's suggestion. The following is the changes made in the manuscript. 2.13 in vivo experiment To investigate whether SPAG6 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis in vivo, both subcutaneous xenograft and pulmonary metastasis mouse models were established. A total of 25 four-week-old male NDG mice (Biocytogen Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) were housed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility at the Animal Experiment Center of Peking University First Hospital. For the tumorigenesis experiment, six mice per group (control and SPAG6 overexpression) were injected subcutaneously with 1.0×10⁷ OSRC-2 cells (transfected with either empty vector or SPAG6 overexpression vector) suspended in 150 μL serum-free medium containing 50% Matrigel. To ensure the welfare of the animals, after four weeks, all procedures were performed under anesthesia using, specific anesthetic, 2% isoflurane via inhalation with continuous monitoring of vital signs. Post-operative analgesia was provided using buprenorphine at 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours for 48 hours. Humane endpoints were strictly enforced, including tumor size, weight loss, or signs of distress. Animals were euthanized using 99% CO₂ inhalation at a flow rate of 12.2 L/min, followed by cervical dislocation to ensure death. In accordance with institutional guidelines and approved protocols for animal welfare, and primary tumors were excised and weighed for evaluation. To assess the anti-metastatic effect of SPAG6 in vivo, a lung metastasis model was constructed. Six mice per group received tail vein injections of 1.0×10⁶ OSRC-2 cells (empty vector or SPAG6 overexpression), suspended in 150 μL sterile PBS. After four weeks, in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging was performed to assess metastatic burden.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters) Reviewer #1: Novel topic: The first systematic study on the epigenetic regulation mechanism of SPAG6 in RCC. The research design system and methodology are solid, and the evidence chain is complete: starting with bioinformatics analysis of TCGA/EWAS databases, combining clinical samples, cell experiments, mouse models, and then transcriptome sequencing and functional enrichment analysis, multi-level data is integrated to ensure the scientific and credible nature of the conclusions. Comprehensive types of experiments, including CCK8, clone formation, scratch experiments Transwell, Flow cytometry, Western blot, BGS, MSP, etc., with clear logic. In vivo experiments, it has been shown to have inhibitory effects on tumor growth and lung metastasis, enhancing clinical transferability. In depth mechanism: not only did we discover the anticancer effect of SPAG6, but we also elucidated its function by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Clear clinical significance: providing new methylation markers for RCC diagnosis and potential targets for treatment Reviewer #2: The authors found that SPAG6 functions as a tumor suppressor in RCC, with its silencing driven by promoter hypermethylation. Through modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, SPAG6 plays a vital role in restraining RCC initiation and progression, the design and results are good. And I only had one concern, the images of Western blot should be improved in Figure 5G and 8C. Respond: Respected Reviewer, as we have revised the western blot result and we have pasted the best ones and more significant results of the western blot. Also, we have included the full image of the Western blot in the supplementary file. Hopeful that after analysing the result, the reviewer will be convinced. ________________________________________ 6.
