According to far‐from‐equilibrium thermodynamics, an open system is far‐from‐equilibrium when its thermodynamic force varies non‐linearly with its thermodynamic flow. These two quantities can be calculated on muscles and therefore on the uterine muscle, using the Huxley formalism. The thermodynamic flow was greater in non‐pregnant compared to pregnant uterine muscle, while the thermodynamic force was equal in both cases. There was a linear relationship between these two quantities in pregnant uterine muscle, whereas a non‐linear relationship characterized the non‐pregnant state. Thus, the non‐pregnant uterine muscle worked far‐from‐equilibrium. The product of thermodynamic force and thermodynamic flow was the energy production rate (EPR). EPR was much greater in pregnant uterine muscle. The derivative with respect to time of EPR was called excess entropy production (EEP). EEP was positive in the pregnant state and negative in the non‐pregnant state. A first‐order nonlinear differential equation with one parameter demonstrated a bifurcation. These results showed that the non‐pregnant uterine muscle was a self‐organized far‐from‐equilibrium dissipative structure. bifurcation dissipative structure far‐from‐equilibrium self‐organization thermodynamics uterus pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:03.10.2025  Lecarpentier Y.

During pregnancy, the uterus adapts to a protective role, while acquiring a function of expulsion of the fetus necessary for childbirth. The uterus undergoes a progressive and long evolution until its final term, which is childbirth. At the end of pregnancy, the uterus prepares for childbirth with the occurrence of contractions that are more and more frequent, organized, and strong. Muscles are open systems and consequently are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Like all living systems, they operate out of equilibrium. They are maintained in a non‐equilibrium state by a constant flow of matter and energy, either in a near‐equilibrium stationary linear stationary regime or far‐from‐equilibrium (Lecarpentier et al., 2005 1979 1999 1999 1990 1957 1971 From a thermodynamic viewpoint, we do not know whether or not the pregnant woman's uterus changes its behavior relative to the thermodynamic equilibrium. Is the uterus close or far‐from‐equilibrium? Does it change its thermodynamic mode depending on whether the woman is pregnant or not pregnant? We will see that after childbirth, the uterus moves far away from equilibrium, undergoes a process of self‐organization, and becomes a dissipative structure (Glansdorff et al., 1974 1999 1979 1974 2023 1986 1974 1991 1999 2010 2020 1990 1953 1972 2012 1977 2013 2022 2024 2 METHODS 2.1 Ethics Statement This study was a human tissue study. Human biological samples were obtained from women who underwent either a caesarean or a hysterectomy outside of pregnancy in the gynecology‐obstetric department of the Grand Hôpital de l'Est Francilien in Meaux, France. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The Institutional Review Board‐The Comité des Personnes (CPP Ile de France XI, Afssaps: 2008‐A0039‐46) CPP: 08015)‐gave a favorable opinion. All patients gave oral and written informed consent with the Local Ethical Committee approval. 2.2 Mechanics of human uterus samples from caesarean and hysterectomy For women who had a caesarean ( n n 1 1 TABLE 1 Clinical signs of women.

Huxley's formalism The formalism of A. Huxley was treated in the Appendix A 1957 f 1 g 1 g 2 2+ A 2.4 Thermodynamic approach: Near or far‐from‐equilibrium Uterine muscles are living open systems exchanging energy and matter with the outside world. The first step was to determine whether the uterus was operating close to or far from equilibrium. It operated close to equilibrium when the thermodynamic force varied linearly with the thermodynamic flow. Conversely, it operated far from equilibrium when the thermodynamic force breached its linearity with the thermodynamic flow. Thermodynamic force (Eo/T) was a function of the myosin concentration (Eo = f 2 A 2.5 Self‐organization and criteria of stability or instability The occurrence of self‐organization imposes that the system was open and far‐from‐ equilibrium. The entropy production rate (EPR) was obtained by the following expression: (2) y = EPR = δ 2 S = 1 / T × Eo × v0 1957 1993 1994 1957 The stability condition for the thermodynamic system was given by the equation: (3) y ′ = ∂ δ 2 S ∂t = 1 / T × δEo × δv0 > 0 ∂ δ 2 S ∂t The system became unstable when equation 3 became negative. (1/T) δEo and δv0 were respectively the deviations of the thermodynamic force (Eo/T) and the thermodynamic flow (v0) from the stationary state. The system remained stable as long as the EEP was positive. When the deviation from the stationary state went beyond a certain critical value, the system reached an instability threshold. EEP could change its sign at a given value and then became negative and unstable. A transition to a self‐organized solution was able to occur. It was difficult to define a single criterion for the occurrence of self‐organization. The criterion based on the loss of thermodynamic stability (i.e., EEP <0) defined well the occurrence of self‐organization (Fox‐Rabinovich et al., 2018 2023 1974 1977 1979 2010 2.6 Determination of a one‐dimensional non‐linear equation with one parameter ψ We applied then a polynomial regression between y y y y 2 y f y y f y f y y f y In a thermodynamic system, dissipative structures occurred under several conditions. The system must be open, exchanging energy, matter and information with the exterior. The system must operate far‐from‐equilibrium and under a non‐linear regime. This was characterized by the non‐linearity between the thermodynamic force and the thermodynamic flow. The self‐organized system imposed a negative EEP. The system must be subjected to slight fluctuations. Dissipative structures disappeared if the exchange of energy and matter between the system and its environment 2.7 Statistical analysis Data were expressed as means ± standard deviations.

EEP became negative. This was a prerequisite for self‐organization to begin. A dissipative structure appeared in Hysterectomy and outside of pregnancy under the following conditions: (i) the uterus was an open system, which is the case for all living systems; it exchanged energy and matter with its environment; (ii) in Hysterectomy, it operated far‐from‐equilibrium and under a non‐linear regime, as attested by the non‐linearity between the thermodynamic flow and the thermodynamic force; (iii) it was subjected to slight fluctuations during this period. This modified the molecular properties of the myosin crossbridges and particularly the CB detachment rate constants. The unitary myosin CB force and the G curvature of the T‐V relationship depended on them and accounted for the thermodynamic results. 4 DISCUSSION 4.1 Conditions of formation of dissipative structures Schrödinger in his book “What is life” (Schrödinger, 1967 1974 1999 1979 1974 4.2 Experimental conditions The study was carried out on isolated uterine fragments and not on an entire uterus in situ. The muscles were studied under identical conditions: pH and composition of the Krebs–Henseleit solution. The uterine fragments were of the same shape and size in both groups. The temperature was the same. This decreases problems inherent in the complex spatial geometry of the uterus and in the fact that on the entire organ there are several layers (endometrium, myometrium). Caution should be exercised when interpreting the results, as the conditions under which the uterus evolved during caesarean and hysterectomy were so different. Metabolic, mechanical, and energetic conditions differed, and this must be taken into account. The T‐V curve is well known to have a thermodynamic significance: the higher G, the more economical the muscular system. The curvature G of the Hill hyperbolic relationship was related to the myosin isoform type. The higher the G, the slower the myosin isoform (Schwartz et al., 1981 1982 For applying statistical mechanics in living muscles, a description of the behavior of myosin molecular motors was needed and was provided by A. Huxley's equations (Huxley, 1957 1957 The theory applies equally well to sarcomeric skeletal muscles and to smooth muscles devoid of sarcomeres. Several authors have applied Huxley's formalism to different types of smooth muscles in swine carotid artery (Hai & Murphy, 1988 1999 2002 Z Z 1983 1989 1996 1994 1997 1998 1998 1994 1995 The low value of myosin ATPase activity in caesarean was associated with low values of thermodynamic flow and EPR. This was accompanied by a higher value of the Hill hyperbola curvature (G) and muscle efficiency. This behavior was consistent with that of a muscle that must ensure the birth of the newborn. The age of the women was complex to analyze because it was higher in hysterectomy than in caesarean. However, hysterectomy was performed in postmenopausal women as well as in women with normal reproductive activity. However, the EPR did not distinguish them and was always low. 4.3 Close to delivery, the uterus operated near equilibrium, and outside of pregnancy, the uterus became a far‐from‐equilibrium self‐organized dissipative structure During pregnancy, cellular processes take place to prepare the uterus to gradually acquire a muscle function specific to childbirth. Hormonal systems, in particular progesterone, play a determining role (Shynlova et al., 2023 2023 1970 1988 1992 1982 A hypothesis for self‐organization in the human uterus during labor has been hypothesized, but the far‐from‐equilibrium thermodynamic state of the uterus and the negative excess entropy production were considered (Banney et al., 2015 5 CONCLUSION The far‐from‐equilibrium thermodynamic analysis of the uterine behavior has made it possible to highlight a radically different functioning depending on whether it was examined at the time of childbirth or outside of pregnancy. In pregnancy and at the time of delivery, the uterine muscle was thermodynamically close to equilibrium with linearity between the thermodynamic flow and the thermodynamic force. Outside of a pregnancy, the uterus moved far‐from‐equilibrium, with a breakdown in the linearity between the thermodynamic force and flow. The uterus thus acquired a behavior of self‐organization and dissipative structure, linked to slight fluctuations acting on kinetics of myosin.

Contractile mechanics. Panel a: Tension and shortening length were represented as a function of time at five increasing load levels; Panel b: Hill hyperbolic Tension‐Velocity relationship with G curvature. A.2 THE ACTIN‐MYOSIN CROSSBRIDGE CYCLE It was composed of six different steps. Values of the CB rate constants for attachement (f1) and detachment (g1 and g2) depended on the stage of the woman, that is, non pregnant or pregnant about to give birth. They determined all the CB molecular parameters (catalytic constant, myosin Ca 2+ A2 FIGURE A2 The actin‐myosin crossbridge cycle. The crossbridge cycle. The CB cycle was composed of six different conformational steps, that is, three detached steps (D1, D2, and D3) and three attached steps (A1, A2, and A3). The myosin molecular motor was the muscle myosin (M). Transition A3 → D1 was the ATP binding step that induced CB detachment after ATP binding with the actin (A)‐muscle myosin (M) complex (A‐M). The rate constant for detachment was g 2 1 A.3 HUXLEY'S FORMALISM A.

The parameter l was the distance between successive actin sites with which any myosin site could combine with actin. According to in vivo conditions (l>>h), the values of h and l were h = 10 nm and l = 28.6 nm (close to the semi‐helicoidal turn of the actin filament).
