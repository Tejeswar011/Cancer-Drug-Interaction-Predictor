To perforate membranes, most PFPs transition from water-soluble monomers or oligomers into multimeric and often supramolecular complexes, a process achieved via substantial structural transition of the PFP. Although they share the general ability to perforate cellular or intracellular membranes, PFPs differ in their membrane-binding preferences, the structural and functional characteristics of the pores they form (such as pore size, pore structure and ability to trigger membrane rupture) and the cell death mechanism they induce or execute. Herein, we review the specific traits of all key human PFPs, including their membrane specificity, regulation of their activity and the structure of the membrane pores they form, followed by insights into the therapeutic potential of PFPs and harnessing their abilities for cancer therapy.

Generally, PFPs are characterized by their ability to switch from a water-soluble form to a membrane-associated form and to arrange into pores. By forming of non-specific transmembrane pores or disrupting membrane integrity, they allow uncontrolled flux of ions and molecules across the membrane, disrupting osmotic balance, cell stability, and cellular homeostasis, ultimately leading to cell lysis [ 1 PFTs initiate membrane permeabilization by binding to specific cell membrane components, such as cholesterol and sphingolipids, cell surface receptors (e.g. b2-integrin, chemokine receptors) or glycans [ 2 3 4 Clostridium perfringens 5 Bordetella pertussis 6 7 In mammals, instead of being virulence factors, PFPs function as immune effectors that lyse pathogens and damaged cells, or as intracellular mediators of cell death pathways [ 8 10 11 12 13 1 Table 1 Classification and functional characteristics of human pore-forming proteins (PFPs) Type of PFP Superfamily Tissue origin Type of cell death induced Type of pore formed Target cells References Extracellular Complement system PFPs: C6, C7, C8α/β, C9 MACPF Hepatocytes, secreted into the blood Necrosis β-barrel pore Microbes and damaged/aberrant host cells [ 19 PRF1 MACPF Cytotoxic lymphocytes; stored in lytic granules; secreted upon antigen recognition into immune synapse Apoptosis β-barrel pore Infected or aberrant host cells [ 20 Granulysin Saposin-like proteins Cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs and NK cells); stored in lytic granules, secreted upon antigen recognition into immune synapse Microptosis Carpet-like membrane disruption proposed Bacteria, protozoa, fungi and parasitic cells, possibly host cell mitochondria [ 21 Defensins Antimicrobial peptides, defensin family Mostly innate immune cells; also, epithelial barrier cells (e.g. Paneth cells, mucosal epithelial cells), secreted upon microbial antigen recognition Microbial cell lysis Carpet and/or barrel stave pore proposed Bacteria, fungi [ 22 Cathelicidin Cathelicidin family (cathelin domain proteins) Mostly innate immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages); epithelial barrier cells (e.g. mucosal epithelial cells, keratinocytes), secreted upon microbial antigen recognition Microbial cell lysis Carpet and/or barrel stave pore proposed Bacteria, fungi, viruses [ 23 Intracellular PRF2 MACPF Constitutively expressed in monocytic cells; inducible in barrier-forming cells (epithelial cells, fibroblasts) Microbial cell lysis β-barrel pore Bacteria within phagosomes [ 24 GSDMs Gasdermin Broad expression; activated in immune cells upon inflammasome activation Pyroptosis β-barrel pore Host plasma membrane and intracellular organelles [ 25 NINJ1 Ninjurin Various tissues; upregulated during inflammation Ferroptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, apoptosis Non-classical pore (membrane rupture) Host plasma membrane [ 26 MLKL HeLo domain proteins Expressed in various cell types Necroptosis Ion channel Host plasma membrane [ 27 In this context, the group of secreted PFPs include the PFPs of the complement system, defensins, cathelicidin, granulysin and PRF1. Complement proteins, defensins, cathelicidin and granulysin form pores in the membranes of invading pathogens [ 14 Intracellular PFPs, typically functioning as executioners of cell death pathways, include the classical apoptosis mediators, Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) and BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 (BAK) [ 15 16 17 18 11 The unique biological properties of PFPs, particularly their direct and potent cytotoxic activity against pathogens and abnormal hosts cells, makes them promising candidates for therapeutic development. For example, PFPs that target microbial pathogens hold substantial potential against multidrug resistant bacteria, while PFPs inducing host cell death can be developed into novel therapies to treat cancers unresponsive to conventional therapies. Although safe and targeted delivery of PFPs was a major challenge in the past, recent advances in nanotechnology and smart delivery systems now offer solutions to this barrier. This review summarizes these PFPs with a particular emphasis on their structural characteristics and mechanisms of action, followed by a discussion of their therapeutic potential against cancer to inspire further investigations into the intricate biology of PFPs. PFP: Pore-forming protein; PRF: Perforin; MACPF: Membrane attack complex/perforin domain; CTLs: Cytotoxic T lymphocytes; NK cells: Natural killer cells; GSDM: Gasdermin; NINJ1: Ninjurin-1; MLKL: Mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase. Secreted pore-forming proteins of the immune system Secreted PFPs are either produced by the liver and released into the periphery as inactive precursors, such as the complement system proteins, or produced by immune cells and deployed onto target cells through granule secretion. Complement system proteins The complement system is a component of the innate immune system. It consists of a network of soluble proteins, secreted by hepatocytes into the blood [ 28 29 30 31 The complement system can be activated through one of three routes: the classical pathway, the lectin-mediated pathway and the alternative pathway (for a comprehensive review of the activation and regulation of the complement system please refer to articles by Merle and colleagues [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 Perforin 1 The antibacterial perforin: Perforin 2 C6, C7, C8α, C8β and C9 all have a MACPF domain composed of a central, twisted β-sheet arranged in an anti-parallel fashion, surrounded by two groups of α-helices (CH1 and CH2, which are functionally equivalent to the transmembrane hairpin (TMH)-1 and -2 regions of PRF1 and 2). Importantly, the CH1 and CH2 regions within the MACPF domains of C6, C7, C8α, C8β differ notably from those of C9 in their hydrophilicity and length. For instance, the CH segments of C7 are less hydrophobic and shorter than of C9 (CH1: 44 amino acids (aa) vs 70, CH2: 47 aa vs 57, for C7 and C9, respectively), likely preventing C7 from fully spanning the membrane and explaining why C9 units form the staves of the transmembrane pore [ 36 39 40 The fully-formed pore has an asymmetrical, split-washer shape, consisting of three regions: an asymmetric stalk region (C5b8), a hinge region (C7, C8, and two C9), forming 4 staves of the barrel-stave pore not fully spanning the membrane, and a C9 oligomer (16–18 units) [ 38 37 41 34 34 37 Through the MAC pore, ions can pass, disrupting normal ion gradients and inducing cell lysis [ 42 43 44 45 46 To the best of our knowledge, the MAC does not possess any known or specific membrane-binding domain or target, enabling its assembly on a wide variety of membranes [ 34 47 48 49 Secondly, strong regulatory mechanisms are in place to mitigate accidental MAC activation on host cells. A key regulator of this is CD59, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored surface protein present on the surface of most somatic cells, especially red and white blood cells. It has been proposed that CD59 is activated by the impact of MAC pore formation on membrane mechanoproperties (rigidifying) [ 34 50 Pore-forming proteins released by effector immune cells The immune system employs diverse strategies to fight against infections while minimizing harm to healthy tissues. One such mechanism is the release of secretory vesicles or granules which contain cytotoxic proteins. For example, neutrophil granulocytes carry three distinct types of secretory granules, each with specialized cargo and function [ 51 + 52 51 53 In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of human PFPs within secretory and lytic granules, including PRF1, granulysin and the human AMPs, defensins and cathelicidin, highlighting their structural characteristics and mechanisms of membrane perforation in target cells. Perforin-1 LG are frequently characterized as “secretory lysosomes” due to their dual nature. While they are secretory granules (unlike lysosomes), they also have characteristics similar to lysosomes, such as an acidic luminal pH and a hydrolytic enzyme cargo, such as cathepsins. Additionally, the membrane of LGs contains LAMP1 (CD107a), a lysosome membrane marker, further illustrating their dual, lysosome-like and secretory characteristics [ 54 PFPs found in LGs include PRF1 and granulysin, stored together with 1) other cytotoxic proteins, such as granzymes (GZMs), 2) death ligands (Fas ligand (FasL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL)) and 3) proteins responsible for retaining PFPs and cytotoxic proteins in an inactive state, such as serglycin (SRGN) and calreticulin (CRT) [ 55 57 Activation of the antigen receptor initiates the formation of the immune synapse (IS), an extensive molecular complex enabling stable attachment of the immune cell to the target cell thus targeting the cytotoxic attack towards the target cell. In the immune cell, the cytoskeleton is rearranged forming microtubules that stabilize the IS and to guide LGs toward the IS. LGs are then transported to the IS. When at the IS, LGs dock at the plasma membrane and undergo priming, a process that prepares them for exocytosis. Then, the LGs fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing their content, including PFPs, into the cleft between the immune cell and the target cell [ 58 PRF1 is the best characterized PFP of LGs. It is a 70 kDa glycoprotein belonging to the of MACPF protein superfamily and expressed by cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. The protein has three conserved domains, starting with a MACPF domain at the amino terminus, followed by a middle, epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain and a Ca 2+ 59 PRF1 permeabilizes membranes of host (mammalian) cells. Membrane insertion is initiated by the C2 domain. Upon release from LGs into the immune synapse, the C2 domain binds Ca 2+ 60 59 59 61 The activity of PRF1 is tightly controlled to prevent permeabilization of the immune cell’s own membranes during intracellular trafficking and storage of PRF1. Firstly, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi vesicles are protected from PRF1-mediated perforation by PRF1’s C-terminal tail. The C-terminal tail facilitates a fast transportation of PRF1 from the ER to the Golgi, thus minimizing intracellular membrane damage [ 62 63 64 63 65 56 57 66 SRGN contains long, negatively charged chains of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which interact with the positively charged residues of PRF1 at acidic pH, maintaining PRF1 in an inactive state until secretion [ 57 67 68 69 70 71 Once PRF1 is secreted in the neutral pH and high-micromolar to millimolar Ca 2+ 2+ 72 73 74 75 76 PRF1 creates pores in the target cell membrane through a three-stage process, starting with membrane docking, followed by formation of the pre-pore intermediate state and finally the assembly of the mature pore [ 59 2+ 60 77 77 1 78 Fig. 1 Formation of membrane attack complex pores by the complement system and perforin-1. A. Stepwise assembly of the complement MAC (membrane attack complex). The C5 convertase (not shown) cleaves and thus releases the C5b complement component, which then covalently binds the membrane via its thioester domain. C5b then interacts with C6, the first complement component carrying a membrane attack complex and perforin domain (MACPF). The C5b-C6 complex recruits C7, which undergoes a conformational change extending and immersing its MACPF domain in the membrane. Recruitment is C7 is followed by attachment of the C8 complex and extension and insertion of the C8a and C8b MACPF domains into the lipid bilayer. The thus assembled C5b-C8 complex recruits the first C9 unit and nucleates the complement MAC complex by recruiting 16–18 C9 units, whose MACPF domains form a split-washer shaped pore with the attached C5b-C8 stalk region. B. Formation of the perforin-1 (PRF1) membrane pore. The MACPF domain of inactive PRF1 is enveloped by two alpha-helical TMH domains. Upon release from lytic granules, the C2 domain of PRF1 binds Calcium ions (4–5 Ca 2+ Importantly, target cells can protect themselves from PRF1 attack by launching a membrane-repair response. The influx of Ca 2 79 80 79 81 82 GZMs are a family of serine proteases, with five members identified in humans: A, B, H, K, and M. Each GZM targets specific substrates to induce cell death through distinct mechanisms. GZMA for instance, induces cell death through a caspase-independent pathway by cleaving NDUFS3 (NADH-Ubiquinone Oxidoreductase Core Subunit S3), a component of Complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, leading to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and oxidative stress [ 83 Gasdermins 84 3 2 85 86 Fig. 2 Schematic representation of cytotoxic mechanisms mediated by lytic granule pore-forming proteins. There are two distinct classes of lytic granules (LGs) based on their size, morphology, cargo, and function, namely single-core granules (SCGs) and multi-core granules (MCGs). Supramolecule attack particles (SMAPs) and exosomes accumulate in MCGs. Both types of granules are transported along microtubules to the immune synapse, where they undergo exocytosis to release their contents. Once released, perforin-1 (PRF1) is activated by the neutral extracellular pH and calcium ions (Ca 2+ As discussed earlier, immune cells employ a variety of protective mechanisms to prevent membrane damage and cell lysis during the intracellular trafficking of PRF1. Protective mechanisms continue to function after the release of PRF1, shielding the immune cells from PRF1 toxicity. For example, upon degranulation, cathepsin B, which is bound to the outer membrane surface of lymphocytes, may provide protection by cleaving and thus inactivating PRF1 [ 87 88 76 89 90 Granulysin: a dual-function immune effector Granulysin is another PFP of LGs. It belongs to the saposin-like protein family (SAPLIP) and it is composed of five α-helical bundles, stabilized by two intramolecular disulfide bonds [ 91 92 Mature granulysin (9 kDa) can interact with negatively charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in membranes via its positively charged surfaces. Moreover, its activity is inhibited by cholesterol, thus making bacterial, protozoal, fungal, and parasitic cell membranes its preferred targets [ 93 94 The 9 kDa granulysin is inactive inside LGs, due to the acidic luminal pH and high cholesterol content [ 21 95 93 96 98 21 While the molecular mechanism of granulysin pore formation is not completely resolved, it has been proposed that granulysin covers the microbial cell membrane in a carpet-like layer driven by electrostatic interactions. As granulysin clusters on the membrane’s surface, it interacts with the phospholipids leading to micelle formation thus removing lipids that generates gaps in the membrane [ 91 97 99 In addition to attacking microbes, granulysin has been reported to induce apoptotic cell death in host (mammalian) cells. It has been suggested that mitochondrial membranes, which are similar in composition to prokaryotic membranes, i.e. poor in cholesterol but rich in cardiolipin, may serve as targets for granulysin [ 21 100 102 95 Antimicrobial peptides AMPs are small proteins used by the innate immune system to kill bacteria, fungi and viruses. Additionally, AMPs modulate the immune response by attracting immune cells to infection sites and supporting wound healing. AMPs are produced across all biological phyla and as of 2024, the Antimicrobial Peptide Database has a record of 3146 natural AMPs [ 103 AMPs use a variety of mechanisms to kill microbes by membrane-permeabilization or immunomodulation [ 104 104 105 105 106 3 Fig. 3 Illustration of the main mechanisms of pore formation and membrane disruption by antimicrobial peptides (AMP). a) The barrel-stave model. The AMPs insert into the membrane, forming water-filled pores lined by an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) oligomer exposing a hydrophilic face towards the lumen and a hydrophobic face towards the lipid bilayer. b) The toroidal-pore model. AMPs form a toroidal pore where the wall of the pore incorporates both AMP and lipid components, bending the membrane into a continuous toroidal structure. c) The carpet model. AMPs accumulate and cover the membrane surface where they interact with membrane lipids. The AMPs disrupt membrane continuity by removing lipids from it after forming AMP-lipid micelles in a detergent-like manner without forming discrete pores. d) The aggregate model. AMPs form transient peptide-lipid complexes, allowing ion leakage, removal of lipid micelles and facilitating intracellular protein entry. Figure was generated with BioRender The toroidal-pore model is similar, but with both AMP peptides and lipids contributing to the pore. Here, interaction of the AMPs with the membrane forces the membrane to bend, which allows the AMPs to “cap” the lipids and form an AMP-lipid complex in the lipid bilayer which arranges into a toroidal pore (Fig. 3 In the carpet and aggregate models, instead of forming channels, AMPs accumulate on the membrane surface, parallel with the membrane surface [ 107 3 3 104 In humans, AMPs are produced by 1) innate immune cells and less frequently by 2) adaptive immune cells and 3) barrier forming cells, such as intestinal epithelial cells (Paneth cells and mucosal membrane cells). The main human AMPs are defensins, histatins, cathelicidin, dermcidin and hepcidin. While defensins, cathelicidin and dermcidin attack by disrupting microbial membranes, histatins and hepcidin act through other mechanisms, such as ion chelation, signaling, or enzyme inhibition. Below we discuss the mechanism of action of the main pore-forming AMPs. Defensins Human defensins are composed of around 30–40 amino acids and have a molecular weight of 3–5 kDa [ 108 109 110 110 Human defensins (HD) are classified into α- and β-forms based on the spacing between the six cysteine residues and the pattern of the disulfide bonds. The alpha defensin family have six members (human neutrophil defensin (HNP) 1–4, HD5 and HD6), while the β-defensin group has at least 8 members [ 111 112 114 The synthesis and release of defensins are regulated in a tissue-specific manner by microbial signals, developmental cues, cytokines and neuroendocrine signals. Human neutrophil defensins are produced constitutively by bone marrow precursor cells during specific stages of neutrophil differentiation, particularly in promyelocyte and early myelocyte stages. After synthesis, these defensins are stored in primary azurophil granules. During phagocytosis of microbes, the azurophil granules merge with the phagocytic vesicles, delivering high concentrations of defensins to kill the pathogens [ 110 115 Defensins are positively charged, which enables them to bind to negatively charged bacterial membrane components, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram-negative bacteria, polysaccharides and teichoic acids in Gram-positive bacteria and phosphatidylglycerol in the membranes of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria [ 116 117 2+ 2+ 118 119 120 22 121 116 122 Cathelicidin Cathelicidins, first identified in myeloid cells, are named so due to the presence of a conserved cathelin domain in their N-terminal pro-region, which has high similarity to the cathepsin L inhibitor of the same name. Over 30 members of the cathelicidin family have been identified so far in mammalian species, with a single cathelicidin expressed in humans (hCAP18) [ 123 124 125 126 127 Human cathelicidin is stored in an inactive state (also called: hCAP-18; where the N-terminal pro-region is connected to the C-terminal AMP) in granules of neutrophil granulocytes and released in this form upon neutrophil activation [ 128 119 129 130 131 132 133 In epithelial tissues, LL-37 exhibits moderate antimicrobial activity against a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including species from the Pseudomonas Escherichia Staphylococcus Enterococcus 134 135 136 137 138 139 139 140 Intracellular pore-forming proteins of the immune system Membrane integrity is central to a cell’s survival. They enable compartmentalization of processes, trafficking of molecules and establishment of a membrane potential. Sustained disruption of membrane integrity is thus incompatible with life and marks the point of no return in cell death processes [ 141 142 The best known and classical examples of intracellular pore-forming proteins are the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, Bax and Bak, known for their function of forming large, toroid pores in the mitochondrial outer membrane [ 143 144 c c 145 During the past decade it emerged that many RCD pathways culminate in the activation of intracellular PFPs. For example, necroptosis signaling leads to activation and pore formation by MLKL, while pyroptosis and NETosis concludes in the activation and membrane pore formation by gasdermins and NINJ1. The section below discusses the intracellular PFPs that function in mammalian organisms. The antibacterial perforin: Perforin-2 Perforin-2, coded by the MPEG1 gene, is an immune effector protein that exhibits dual antimicrobial function: it perforates bacterial membranes to lyse bacteria and it also activates proinflammatory signaling, thereby maximizing effectiveness [ 146 147 148 Unlike PRF1, PRF2 is a transmembrane protein and consists of a short signal peptide (SP), an ectodomain, and an endodomain. The SP directs PRF2 to the ER after which it is proteolytically removed. Within the ER membrane, the ectodomain is strategically oriented towards the luminal space, while the endodomain is exposed to the cytosolic face. The ectodomain contains the MACPF domain with two sets of TMH1 and TMH2 motifs, followed by an EGF domain, a multi-vesicular body-12 (MVB12)-associated b-prism (MABP) domain (also known as P2 domain or β-hairpin) and a C-terminal tail (CTT) or L-domain. The endodomain includes a single-pass transmembrane domain (TMD) followed by a short cytosolic sequence [ 24 149 Upon bacterial infection, PRF2 is transported to phagosomes to kill endocytosed bacteria. PRF2 may also localize to the cell surface where it facilitates the elimination of extracellular pathogens [ 10 146 10 Microbe phagocytosis, LPS and IFN-gamma signaling induces monoubiquitylation of conserved lysine-rich motifs in the cytosolic tail of PRF2 by the cullin ring ligase (CRL) and β-Transducin Repeat Containing Protein (βTrCP) complex, which triggers the transport of PRF2 to endosomal/phagosomal bodies. Once in the phagosome membrane, PRF2 assembles into ring-shaped pre-pores of ~ 12–13 nm, with the N terminal, MACPF domain being in the phagosome lumen. The pre-pore complexes may be detached from the phagosome membrane either by phagosome acidification or proteolytic cleavage. Once released, the pre-pore complexes bind to negatively charged lipids present in microbial membranes and the acidic pH induces the assembly of the pre-pores into mature pores to lyse bacteria [ 150 151 4 Fig. 4 Intracellular and extracellular pore-forming activity of perforins. (a) Perforin-1 (PRF1) is exocytosed by cytotoxic lymphocytes into the synaptic cleft along with cytotoxic molecules. PRF1 then creates pores in the plasma membrane of the targeted, abnormal (infected, damaged or aberrant) host cell causing cell lysis and delivery of other cytotoxic proteins, such as granzymes (GZMs) and granulysin directly through PRF1 pores or indirectly, via endocytosis of PRF1-perforated membrane segments with GZMs attached to it. (b) In contrast, perforin-2 (PRF2) primarily acts intracellularly. PRF2 is stored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a transmembrane protein and transported to phagosomes where it attacks engulfed microbes by perforating their membrane. Figure was generated with BioRender There are several mechanisms that preserve the host membrane form PRF2-induced damage. The neutral pH at the ER and Golgi act as a regulatory mechanism preventing activation until PRF2 reaches the phagosomes [ 151 24 Gasdermins Pyroptosis is a form of immunostimulatory RCD that typically occurs in macrophages upon pathogen infection. It is however not limited to immune cells; epithelial cells, endothelial cells and some other cell types can also undergo so-called sterile pyroptosis (pyroptosis induced by cellular stress and damage as opposed to pathogens and mediated by DAMPs), e.g. during mucosal barrier dysfunction in Crohn’s disease [ 152 153 154 GSDMs, a family of homologous PFPs, are regarded as the central executioners of pyroptosis with six known members in humans: GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDMD, GSDME, and PJVK [ 155 156 157 158 5 159 Fig. 5 Schematic illustration of the activation and mechanism of function of gasdermin proteins. (a) Full-length gasdermins (GSDMs) are intercellular proteins primarily localized in the cytosol, except for GSDMB, which binds to the membrane. When the inhibitory C-terminal domain is removed by proteolytic cleavage, releasing the N-terminal domain, which leads to plasma membrane rupture (PMR). (b) GSDMs predominantly target the plasma membrane, while some, including GSDMA, GSDMD, and GSDME, also target intracellular organelles. Figure was generated with BioRender In response to various exogenous pathogens and endogenous damage, GSDMs are proteolytically cleaved at the linker region by specific proteases, such as caspases, neutrophil elastase (ELANE), Streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB), or GZMA/B. For instance, microbial infections and internal danger signals induce the assembly of the canonical inflammasome complexes which activate pro-caspase-1. Activated caspase-1 then cleaves GSDMD at its middle linker, releasing the active, N-terminal fragment, which then permeabilizes the plasma membrane from the inside. GSDMD pores provide a route for the rapid release of alarmins/or DAMPs, such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), IL-18, IL-1β, DNA-binding histones, and HMGB1, which initiate inflammatory responses [ 160 161 162 163 In addition to caspases, GSDMD can also be cleaved by ELANE, a neutrophil-specific serine protease present in activated neutrophil granulocytes. Similar to macrophages, inflammasome activation in neutrophils leads to pro-caspase-1 activation and caspase-1-mediated processing of GSDMD. The resulting free amino-terminal subunit of GSDMD however, instead of the plasma membrane, targets the azurophilic granules of the neutrophil granulocytes to release the granule’s content into the cytosol. The released serine proteases, including ELANE then cleave other GSDMD molecules, leading to a feed-forward cascade of GSDMD processing finally culminating in plasma membrane permeabilization and NETosis, a neutrophil-specific cell death mechanism characterized by the release of DNA complexed with antimicrobial enzymes and AMPs (neutrophil extracellular traps, NETs) [ 164 166 SpeB is protease that cleaves GSDMA, which is predominantly expressed in the skin during Streptococcus pyogenes 167 168 Upon release from the autoinhibitory interaction with the C-terminal domain, positively charged and amphipathic regions of the NTD get exposed and interact with negatively charged lipids, such as cardiolipin, phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) and phosphatidylserine (PS), present in mitochondrial membranes and in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane of mammalian cells [ 17 169 170 After the free NTD inserts into the membrane, 26–34 NTD units oligomerize into a 20 nm diameter β-barrel pre-pore intermediate held together by lateral interactions between GSDM monomers. In these pre-pores, the N-terminal globular ends of the NTD units (heads) remain largely unchanged, while in the pore-forming segments undergo a radical conformational change, where they reorganize into two anti-parallel β-hairpins (fingers), long enough to transverse the lipid bilayer. The transmembrane β-hairpins are amphipathic, with the side facing the lipid bilayer being hydrophobic while the side facing the lumen of the pre-pore contains positively and negatively charged patches. The pre-pores are partially immersed in the membrane and the globular heads of the GSDM units stay above the membrane, are tilted, bending towards the β-hairpins. The transition from the pre-pore stage to the mature pore is facilitated by an approximately 38° rotation of the globular heads upward, away from the membrane and the β-hairpins. This rotation occurs during full insertion of the β-strands into the membrane, changing the shape of the protein to allow inter-monomer interactions and eliminate steric hindrances [ 171 The current model of GSDM pore formation described by Mulvihill and colleagues is somewhat different from the above model for human GSDMD pores. Time-lapse experiments demonstrated that the heights of the arc-, slit- and ring-shaped oligomers did not show a vertical collapse during pore formation, suggesting the absence of a pre-pore state [ 170 While the mechanism of pore-formation is comparable across family members, it is not true for the lipid binding affinities for GSDMs. This difference between individual GSDMs may explain the differential kinetics of GSDM proteins in binding to different membranes. For instance, the N-terminal fragment of GSDMA shows a strong preference for binding to cardiolipin and a weaker preference for PIPs, compared to GSDMD. Consequently, GSDMA exhibits a time-dependent subcellular localization pattern, with an initial localization to the mitochondria and a delayed redistribution or localization to the plasma membrane. In contrast, GSDMD rapidly targets both mitochondria and the plasma membrane [ 172 173 174 c 5 175 Generally, GSDM pores result in two distinct outcomes in mammalian cells, which are cell death on one hand, characterized by PMR and pyroptosis, and non-lethal functions on the other hand, that facilitate the rapid release of inflammatory factors [ 154 Ninjurin-1 To ensure that GSDM do not trigger unwanted cell death, mammalian cells employ two interacting mechanisms to restore membrane integrity: activation of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) system and the membrane repair system. The ESCRT system is a conserved membrane remodeling machinery that regulates the scission and repair of cellular membranes. For example, upon GSDMD pore formation, the influx of Ca 2 176 2 177 Ninjurin-1 The nerve injury-induced protein, or ninjurin protein family consists of two members in humans: NINJ1 and NINJ2. Of the two proteins, only NINJ1 has been identified as a membrane pore-forming protein. Originally discovered as a protein induced upon nerve injury, NINJ1 has since emerged as a multifunctional protein. NINJ1 is highly expressed in neuronal and Schwann cells, where it facilitates axonal growth and regeneration after peripheral nerve damage [ 178 180 179 11 181 Unlike other pore-forming proteins, NINJ1 constitutively localizes to the plasma membrane. Structurally, it consist of 4 alpha helices and an unstructured N terminal section, with helices-1 and -2 forming an N-terminal extracellular domain and α3 and α4 spanning the membrane [ 181 181 The best understood mechanism of NINJ1 activation is that of during pyroptosis where NINJ1 acts downstream of GSDMD [ 181 182 26 181 183 26 PMR facilitates the release of intracellular DAMPs such as HMGB1 [ 184 NINJ1’s role extends beyond pyroptosis, as it has been implicated in other forms of cell death, including ferroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis, although its contribution to these death programs is less understood [ 184 185 186 Mixed lineage kinase domain like pseudokinase MLKL is expressed across a wide range of vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish, highlighting its evolutionary significance. MLKL functions as the terminal executioner of necroptosis, a regulated form of cell death, which despite its controlled nature, exhibits morphological similarities to the accidental cell death of necrosis [ 187 188 Necroptosis can be induced by various stimuli, including death ligand cytokines, lipopolysaccharides and double-stranded DNA detected by Toll-like receptors, inflammatory cytokines activating their receptors (interferons, TNF), and cytosolic Z-DNA and Z-RNA (left-handed helical nucleic acids) detected by the cytosolic nucleic acid sensor, ZBP-1 (Z-DNA Binding Protein-1). Signaling from these diverse receptors converges on the activation of the serine/threonine kinase RIPK3 (receptor-interacting protein kinase-3). The prototypical necroptosis pathway, where the steps of the signal transduction pathway leading to RIPK3 activation and necroptotic cell death are best understood is the one initiated by the death ligand, TNF. When TNF binds to its death receptor, TNF-R1, the receptor triggers three main signaling pathways[ 189 The first pathway activates the transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF- ΚB). Upon activation, the membrane-bound TNF-R1 receptor recruits the adaptor proteins, receptor-interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1), TNF-R1-associated death domain protein (TRADD) and TNF receptor-associated factor-2 (TRAF2) to which the ubiquitin ligases cIAP1 and -2 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins 1 and 2) and linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) proteins bind, forming a high molecular weight protein complex, termed as Complex I. In the complex, cIAP1/2 and LUBAC polyubiquitylate RIPK1, TRADD, and TRAF2. NF-ΚB activating adaptor and kinase complexes (TA B1 The second signaling pathway initiated by TNF-R1 leads to apoptosis. This occurs when ubiquitylation fails to take place in Complex I, for example due to the absence or inhibition of cIAP1/2. In the absence of ubiquitylation, the adaptor proteins detach from the receptor. As they detach, TRADD and RIPK1 nucleate an alternative signaling complex in the cytosol, termed Complex II, by recruiting another adaptor protein, Fas-associated via death domain protein (FADD), which in turn recruits pro-caspase-8. Pro-caspase-8 becomes activated in Complex II via induced proximity (dimerization and/or polymerization), and initiates the apoptosis signaling cascade (Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Mechanism of mixed lineage kinase like pseudokinase membrane permeabilization during necroptosis. Activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNF-R1) by TNF initiates necroptotic signalling when the adaptor protein, receptor interacting protein kinase-1 (RIPK1) binds to the receptor, but does not get polyubiquitylated. This may happen if cellular apoptosis inhibitor proteins (cIAP)1/2 and/or the LUBAC ubiquitylating protein complexes do not bind to TNF-R1 (not shown), or de-ubiquitylating enzymes (e.g. A20) are recruited (not shown). Non-ubiquitylated RIPK1 is then released into the cytosol and binds several RIPK3 and MLKL units either as monomers or as inactive heerodimers. RIPK1 phosphorylates and thus activates RIPK3 in the complex, changing its kinase domain (KD) from its open, inactive conformation to the closed, active conformation. RIPK3 then phosphorylates MLKL in its pseudokinase domain (PSKD). Phosphorylated MLKL detaches from the necrosome and undergoes a structural transition. Its PSKD switches to the closed, active-like conformation that triggers the release of the brace region, which rearranges into an elongated helix. The elongated brace helices of 2 MLKL dimers then combine into a tetrameric coiled coil. Finally, the 4HB domains twist away from the brace region, undergo a conformational change that exposes a positively charged pocket and an amphipathic organization for sinking into the lipid bilayer. These MLKL units are trafficked to the cell membrane where they lead to membrane permeabilization. Figure was generated with BioRender The third, signaling pathway is necroptosis. It is activated when pro-caspase-8 activation is blocked in Complex II, for example by the viral caspase-8 inhibitor, vFLIP. In this scenario, RIPK1 in Complex II recruits another kinase, RIPK3, and the PFP, MLKL, forming a new protein complex, called the necrosome. RIPK3 oligomerizes in the necrosome and becomes autoactivated through cross-phosphorylation by adjacent RIPK3 units. MLKL is then phosphorylated by RIPK3 on threonine 357 and serine 358 (T357, S358) in its pseudokinase domain [ 190 191 192 27 193 194 The importance of the necroptotic cell death pathway is underscored by the fact that several pathogenic microbes produce necroptosis inhibitors (e.g. MLKL inhibitors) to evade host cell death, thereby enhancing their virulence [ 188 195 196 195 197 The conserved structural units of MLKL include three regions. The N-terminus contains a unique coiled coil, four-helix bundle (4HB) or HeLo domain which mediates lipid binding, followed by an intermediary two-helix “brace” region that facilitates MLKL oligomerization. Finally, the C-terminal segment contains a pseudokinase domain, which is essential for the regulation of MLKL activity [ 198 201 The activity of MLKL is controlled by phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated MLKL is inactive and present in the cytosol either as a monomer [ 202 203 194 204 6 203 During necroptosis signaling RIPK1 recruits RIPK3 units (possibly both monomers and RIPK3-MLKL dimers) to the necrosome. The joining RIPK3 units get aligned through their N-terminal RHIM (RIP homotypic interaction motif) domains. In this structure, RIPK3 can be phosphorylated on S227 by CK1 kinases also present in the necrosome, and on S232 and S369 by RIPK1. These phosphorylation events (S369, S232) facilitate the stable binding of RIPK3 to the necrosome. Additionally, adjacent RIPK3 units can cross-phosphorylate each other on residues T224 and S227, which triggers the recruitment and consequent phosphorylation of MLKL on T357 and S358 (or a subset of the T355, T357, S358 and S360 residues, [ 205 The structure of the phosphorylated, active human MLKL is incompletely understood. The current best model, supported by crystallographic and negative-stain electron microscopy, suggests that RIPK3-mediated phosphorylation pushes the MLKL pseudokinase domain to switch into a closed, active-like conformation, which in turn drives MLKL dimerization [ 205 199 205 206 207 The supramolecular structure of the MLKL oligomers at the membrane remains undefined, too [ 142 208 209 27 27 209 210 A more general hypothesis is that MLKL directly mediates the permeabilization of the plasma membrane either as a result of its partial insertion into the lipid bilayer [ 199 27 207 142 199 211 Similarly to GSDMs, MLKL cytotoxicity is counterbalanced via the membrane repair mechanisms mediated by the ESCRT-III secretory system and the endocytic membrane repair machinery [ 212 Therapeutic application of pore-forming proteins in cancers Most conventional anticancer therapies eliminate malignant cells through one of three mechanisms: inducing cell differentiation and thus pushing malignant cells into a non-proliferative, differentiated state; triggering cellular stress that renders cancer cells nonviable; or inhibiting upstream anti-apoptotic mediators such as growth factor receptors and signaling kinases to reduce apoptosis resistance and render tumor cells more sensitive to oncogenic and environmental stress (e.g. hypoxia). While these strategies can be effective, they are often associated with high non-specific toxicity, and cancer cells frequently evolve mechanisms to evade them. In contrast, the superior efficacy of therapeutic immune cells lies in the nature of the cytotoxic molecules they deploy. These molecules can directly activate the terminal, effector stages of regulated cell death (RCD) pathways, offering cancer cells little opportunity to develop resistance. Among the most potent of these cytotoxic agents are pore-forming proteins (PFPs). The ability of PFPs to directly perforate membranes and lyse cancer cells makes them compelling candidates for the development of novel and effective cancer therapies. Compared to conventional treatment modalities such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy, PFP-based approaches offer a unique advantage: potent, targeted elimination of malignant cells with reduced collateral damage to healthy tissues. In this context, nanotechnology offers a powerful tool for enhancing the therapeutic utility of PFPs. Smart, biocompatible nanoparticles can be engineered to precisely deliver extracellular-acting PFPs (e.g., PRF-1 and granulysin) directly to tumor sites or to regulate the expression and activation of intracellular PFPs (e.g., GSDMs and MLKL). The following section reviews recent advances in the therapeutic application of both secreted and intracellular PFPs, highlighting their translational potential in the context of cancer treatment. Perforin-1 Despite the potency of PFPs, not every interaction between cytotoxic lymphocytes and their targets results in cell death. For example, cancer cells can modify their membrane composition to resist PRF1-mediated lysis by altering their composition, such as increasing lipid order and membrane stiffness by increasing the cholesterol content or by expressing PS in the outer membrane leaflet to make the membrane surface negatively charged [ 213 214 215 −2 216 However, the challenges are not limited to the cancer cells’ membrane; they also arise from the insufficient activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes, leading to low concentrations of PRF1 released into the IS. To address this issue, Zhao and colleagues prepared CD63-functionalized nanocarriers based on zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) for the targeted delivery of PRF1 and GZMB into lysosomes of T cells. In a 4T1 mouse tumor xenograft assay, T cells loaded with nanocarrier-delivered PRF1 and GZMB released greater amounts of these cytotoxic effectors compared to non-loaded T cells, which enhanced tumor cell apoptosis [ 217 Despite these initial results, in vivo overexpression of PRF1 in immune cells poses a risk of systemic adverse effects. In light of this challenge, PRF1 expression was introduced into target cells directly, via a liposomal nanocarrier encapsulating a PRF1 expression vector driven by the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter, so PRF1 expression was restricted to the prostate cancer cells. Accordingly, elevated PRF1 levels were detectable in the tumor, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer [ 218 219 Granulysin As previously discussed, the 9-kDa processed form of granulysin is a cytotoxic effector molecule stored in the LGs of cytotoxic lymphocytes and has cytotoxic activity against both microbes and some tumor cells. Thus, its therapeutic potential for cancer therapy has been tested through various strategies. One notable approach involved intratumour injection of recombinant granulysin, in an in vivo model of multiple myeloma [ 220 The first strategy is the use of immunotoxins, which combine a cytotoxic agent, such as granulysin, with an antibody as a targeting moiety to achieve tumor-specific delivery. In this context, Ibáñez-Pérez and colleagues engineered a granulysin-based immunotoxin by fusing the granulysin gene to a targeting antibody fragment (MFE23) that specifically recognizes carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Their study systematically evaluated the efficacy of this granulysin-based immunotoxin, MFE23GRNLY, in HeLa-CEA tumor-bearing mice, providing the first proof-of-concept for its use in cancer therapy [ 221 222 223 The second approach to increase therapeutic efficacy of recombinant granulysin is the use of nanocarriers. Nanotechnology provides a wide variety of targeted and designable nanoplatforms that carry therapeutic agents, protect them from premature degradation, and deliver them to the desired location [ 224 225 226 227 Gasdermins GSDMs play a dual role in cancer therapy due to their inconsistent expression profiles in various cancers. For example, GSDMA, GSDMC, and GSDMD are underexpressed in esophageal and gastric cancers, while GSDMB is overexpressed and acts as an oncogene in these cancers [ 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 Therapeutic modalities such as anticancer drugs, photodynamic therapy (PDT), photothermal therapy (PTT), and RT can induce pyroptosis by cleaving GSDM proteins in tumor cells. For example, paclitaxel and cisplatin trigger pyroptosis via the caspase-3/GSDME pathway in A549 lung cancer cells [ 235 236 237 PDT is an emerging treatment that uses photosensitizers (PSs) to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light exposure. IR700DX-6T, a mitochondria-targeted PS, induces GSDME-dependent pyroptosis in colorectal cancer cells. Combined with decitabine (a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor) and anti-PD-1 antibodies, this approach reversed GSDME silencing and improved therapeutic efficacy [ 238 PDT combined with PTT offers a non-invasive strategy for inducing pyroptosis. For instance, when IR780, a photosensitizer was delivered via nanomicelles to CD320-overexpressing gastric cancer cells, upon near-infrared (NIR) light exposure mitochondrial ROS production increased, activating the NLRP3 inflammasome, caspase-1, and GSDMD, leading to pyroptosis and enhanced anti-tumor immunity [ 239 RT is another therapeutic approach capable of inducing pyroptosis in esophageal carcinoma cells through caspase-3/GSDME pathway [ 240 241 2 Table 2 The most recent strategies targeting GSDM expression GSDM Type of cancer Relative expression of GSDM Therapeutic approaches Outcome References GSDMD Colon cancer Decrease Restoring GSDMD expression Nanoplatform: Calcium carbonate nanoparticles functionalized with hyaluronic acid Cargo: Plasmid encoding full length GSDMD protein The prepared nanoplatform induces tumor-specific pyroptosis, promotes immune memory effects, and prevents tumor recurrence [ 242 GSDMB Breast cancer Increase Targeting intracellular GSDMB oncoprotein Nanoparticle: Hyaluronic acid nanocapsule Cargo: Anti-GSDMB antibody Anti-GSDMB nanotherapy effectively reduce tumor growth, metastatic behavior, and drug resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer cells [ 243 Breast cancer Melanoma Decrease Restoring GSDMB expression Nanoparticle: Cationic lipid nanoparticles termed as AA3-Dlin LNPs Cargo: Single-agent mRNA coding the N-terminus of GSDMB Nanoparticles effectively deliver the N-terminus of GSDMB to trigger the pyroptosis pathway without caspase cleavage in both models. The prepared platform provides strong immunity by reprogramming the TME from a cold to a hot state [ 244 GSDME Breast cancer Decrease Activation of GSDME using antagomir Treatment: Cetuximab and miR-155-5p antagomir The combination of cetuximab with the miR-155-5p antagomir effectively promoted pyroptosis in triple-negative breast cancer cells [ 245 Colon cancer Decrease Activation of GSDME Nanoplatform: Lipid‐coated PLGA nanoparticles Cargoes: GSDME expressing plasmid DNA with a heat‐inducible promoter HSP70 and a photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG) Alternative therapeutic approaches: Chemotherapy (Oxaliplatin) and photothermal therapy (PTT) The nanoplatform efficiently delivers therapeutic cargoes, and upon irradiation, ICG generates localized hyperthermia, further promoting GSDME expression. Concurrently, oxaliplatin activates caspase-3, triggering GSDME cleavage and inducing pyroptosis [ 246 Breast cancer Decrease Restoring GSDME expression Nanoplatform: Dual-layer polydopamine hybrid nanoplatform (DMP@P) Cargoes: and DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine (DCT) and mitoxantrone (MIT) Alternative therapeutic approach: PTT PDA absorbs near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, increasing Ca 2 [ 247 Melanoma Decrease Triggering endogenous GDSME expression Nanoplatform: Nano-CD (a polymer type) Cargoes: CRISPR/dCas9 Plasmid (for GSDME expression) and cisplatin Alternative therapeutic approach: Immune checkpoint blockade Nano-CD delivers both cargoes, leading to the synthesis of endogenous GSDME protein, which is subsequently cleaved by cisplatin-induced activated caspase-3. Nano-CD, in combination with a PD-1 antibody, provides strong immune memory, preventing relapse and lung metastasis in mouse melanoma models [ 248 Osteosarcoma Decrease Upregulation of GSDME protein levels Vector: LPAD contain ethanolamine (EA), ethylenediamine (ED) and poly (glycidyl methacrylate) Cargo: GSDME plasmid Alternative therapeutic approaches: Chemotherapy (Cisplatin) The proposed combination therapy induces the expression of GSDME, promoting pyroptosis and reshaping osteosarcoma microenvironment by transforming its cold into the favorable hot feature [ 249 MLKL Genetic and epigenetic changes in necroptosis pathways have been identified in many tumor types. For instance, diminished MLKL expression have been documented in ovarian- [ 250 251 252 253 254 256 In the first method, MLKL mRNA was delivered into melanoma and colon carcinoma tumors using electroporation, combined with the immune checkpoint inhibitor blocker, anti-PD1. This combination therapy resulted in a remarkable induction of neo-epitope-specific T cell responses, providing protection against the growth of both primary and distal tumors [ 256 254 255 Non-viral delivery systems, such as nanocarriers, have demonstrated significant potential for the co-delivery of genetic agents and therapeutic molecules to cancer cells. In this context, Sun and colleagues utilized liposomes for the simultaneous delivery of MLKL plasmid DNA, zVAD (a pan-caspase inhibitor peptide) and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) to induce necroptosis in colon cancer cells. This approach demonstrated a synergistic interaction between the gene therapy and the drugs, leading to RIPK3-dependent necroptosis in CT26 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice [ 257 + 258 259 260 Conclusions and future directions There are a wide variety of PFPs across all domains of life, sharing the common feature of inducing membrane damage. In this review, we classified human PFPs based on their functional properties, distinguishing between secreted PFPs that mediate non-autologous cell lysis and intracellular PFPs that act in a cell-autologous manner, permeabilizing the membranes of the cells from inside. Increased insights into the function and mechanism of action of PFPs reveal their complementary and specialized functions, ranging from target specificity and diverse biological functions to their interactions with specific types of cell death pathways. For instance, complement system proteins, granulysin and PRF2 target bacterial membranes, PRF1, NINJ-1 and MLKL disrupt the plasma membrane of host cells, while GSDMs can act on both plasma membranes and subcellular compartments. From a functional perspective, PRF1 facilitates the delivery of cytotoxic effectors and regulates ion fluxes, whereas GSDM and MLKL pores play a crucial role in the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and alarmins. Moreover, each PFP is associated with a specific subset of cell death mechanisms. For example, PRF1, through the delivery of GZMs, is involved in apoptosis, while granulysin plays a role in microptosis and GSDMs and MLKL are key triggers of pyroptosis and necroptosis, respectively. Extensive scientific evidence supports the crucial role and therapeutic potential of PFPs in a number of diseases, especially in cancer. The lytic activity and ability of PFPs to induce membrane distortion represent a promising area for future investigations to develop novel cancer therapies. However, the role of PFPs, particularly the intracellular ones, is often paradoxical, necessitating studies that assess their function in specific cancer types and different molecular pathways. Such investigations are critical to carefully evaluate and design precise therapeutic strategies aimed at re-expressing or knocking out these proteins. Additionally, cancer cells employ resistance mechanisms against PFPs, including the activation of repair pathways to inhibit membrane perforation and the expression of intracellular mediators to neutralize their function. In other cases, the TME suppresses cytotoxic lymphocytes, resulting weak cytotoxic attack where too little extracellular PFPs are released to kill the cancer cells. New investigations into the biological functions of PFPs are providing deeper insights into the crosstalk between different types of cell death, uncovering potential regulatory mechanisms and therapeutic implications, and offering new perspectives on potential treatment strategies. PANoptosis represents a novel and multifaced inflammatory PCD pathway driven by caspases and RIPKs that simultaneously integrates pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, forming a ‘death triangle’ 261 Despite these advances, several emerging questions remain and must be addressed to fully realize the therapeutic potential of PFPs. These include understanding how PFPs are regulated, identifying strategies for their selective targeting and characterizing the structural plasticity of PFPs that may influence their activity and specificity in different biological contexts. Addressing these challenges will be essential for refining PFP-based therapies and optimizing their application across various disease models.
