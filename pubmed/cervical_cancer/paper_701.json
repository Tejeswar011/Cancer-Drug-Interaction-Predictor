Tumors initially staged as T4a due to bone invasion were reclassified to T1–T3 based on size and depth of invasion. The overall rate of occult cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) was 20.2%. Bone invasion significantly increased occult CLNM risk in T1-sized tumors (OR 6.38, 95% CI: 1.48–27.42), but not in T2–T3 tumors. Moreover, bone invasion in T1–T2 tumors was not associated with worse survival. These findings suggest that the prognostic relevance of bone invasion is size-dependent. Routine upstaging to T4a may therefore overestimate risk in certain cases, and a more differentiated staging approach could support de-escalation of neck management in selected early-stage OSCC patients.

Introduction The oncological prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) varies according to individual histopathological risk profiles, which has important clinical and therapeutic implications. The primary classification system used is the TNM staging, with the T stage describing the local extent of the tumor based on size and depth of invasion (DOI) [ 1 2 In patients with clinically negative necks (cN0), the risk of occult cervical metastasis usually remains high with up to 40%, prompting the recommendation for some form of neck management [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 10 11 12 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design This retrospective, monocentric, observational cohort study was conducted at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Charité—Universitätsmedizin Berlin and was approved by the local ethics committee (reference number: EA2-077-20). Patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and a clinically negative neck (cN0) were identified from the institutional cancer registry. All included patients underwent primary surgical resection with negative margins (R0) between January 2010 and December 2024. All patients with evidence of bone invasion received segmental bone resection. Only pT4a OSCC cases classified based on the presence of bone invasion were included. Tumors staged as pT4a due to invasion of adjacent structures other than bone—such as deep muscles, the maxillary sinus, or skin—were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria included synchronous secondary carcinomas, different head and neck cancer locations such as oropharyngeal SCC or any prior history of head and neck cancer. Parameters assessed in this study included age, sex, tumor-specific characteristics including tumor location and histopathological risk factors, treatment modality, and follow-up events such as locoregional failure, distant metastasis, and mortality. All tumors were retrospectively restaged according to the current 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual [ 1 The primary endpoint of this study was the association between OSCC stratified by T-stage and tumor size as well as the presence of occult CLNM. Secondary endpoints included regional failure quantified by neck control rate (NCR), overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). 2.2. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were presented as absolute and relative frequencies for categorical variables, and as mean ± standard deviation (SD) for continuous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were employed to assess the association between epidemiological and histopathological risk factors and the presence of occult cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM), with results reported as odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Model selection for the logistic regression analyses was performed using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to identify the best-fitting models. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to estimate OS, RFS and NCR. OS was defined as the time from diagnosis to death from any cause; RFS as the time to locoregional recurrence, distant metastasis, or death; and NCR as the time to regional lymph node failure. Survival differences between groups were analyzed using the log-rank test. A p 3. Results 3.1. Patient Cohort Characteristics Overall, 642 patients could be included, of whom 117 (18.2%) were initially staged as pT4a. The baseline characteristics of both the overall cohort and the pT4a cohort with its size reclassification are shown in Table 1 Among the 642 patients included in the study, the majority ( n n 3.2. Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis The overall rate of occult metastasis in the cohort was 20.2%. When stratified by tumor stage, patients with pT4 tumors showed a notably higher rate of occult metastasis at 29.9%. Table 2 After adjustment for age, sex and histopathological risk factors, bone invasion in T1-sized tumors was significantly associated with occult CLNM (OR 6.38, 95% CI: 1.48–27.42). In contrast, for T2- and T3-sized tumors, the presence of bone invasion was not significantly associated with occult CLNM (T2: OR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.37–1.73 and T3: OR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.37–1.62). Table 3 Figure 1 3.3. Survival and Regional Failure The 3-year OS for the entire cohort was 76.7% (95% CI: 72.7–80.9), while the RFS was 63.8% (95% CI: 59.3–68.6). During follow-up, only 36 (5.6%) patients presented with regional lymph node failure. The 3-year NCR was 92.2% (95% CI: 89.5–94.9). Patients with pT1 tumors had the most favorable prognosis, with a 3-year OS of 85.6% (95% CI: 80.5–91.0), NCR of 93.8% (95% CI: 90.2–97.5), and RFS of 72.1% (95% CI: 65.7–79.2). In contrast, pT3 tumors were associated with significantly poorer outcomes, with a 3-year OS of 55.4% (95% CI: 40.0–76.7), NCR of 80.6% (95% CI: 62.3–100.0), and RFS of 26.7% (95% CI: 12.3–58.0). Both pT2 (3-year OS of 70.8% (95% CI: 63.0–79.6), NCR of 89.0% (95% CI: 83.4–95.0), and RFS of 58.6% (95% CI: 50.4–68.1)) and pT4a (3-year OS of 74.7% (95% CI: 66.1–84.4), NCR of 96.0% (95% CI: 92.1–99.9), and RFS of 65.9% (95% CI: 57.0–76.2)) stages showed intermediate survival. Among patients with small tumors (T1–2 sized), bone invasion was not significantly associated with lower survival outcomes (see Figure 2 4. Discussion In this study, we demonstrated that bone invasion appears to be associated with an increased risk of occult metastasis in OSCC, which according to size would be classified as pT1. However, this association was not present for pT2 or pT3 sized tumors, where bone invasion was not statistically significant different in regard to the prediction of occult CLNM or regional failure. To interpret these results, it is important to consider that only 9 patients with pT4a tumors could be classified to pT1 according to the tumor size. Therefore, these results need to be interpreted with care since they may underly sample size bias. In our pT-stage prediction model, pT2 tumors were even slightly stronger predictive than pT4a tumors, which is also reflective in the distribution of occult metastasis illustrated in Table 2 Beyond these findings, the literature reflects a heterogeneous landscape regarding the prognostic significance of bone invasion. For example, Bittar et al. suggested pT4a classification, PNI, and tumor thickness were predictive for occult CLNM, though their study methodology was limited and potentially biased due to incomplete statistical modeling and incomplete case stratification [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 One study assessing 323 OSCC patients stratified by tumor size and bone invasion status [ 19 Ebrahimi et al. further differentiated cortical versus medullary bone invasion [ 20 In our cohort, the lack of independent prognostic significance of bone invasion aligns with findings that question the uniform upstaging to T4a solely on the basis of bone infiltration. These results advocate for a more nuanced interpretation of pT4a classification in OSCC. In particular, they call for caution when assigning pT4a status in smaller tumors, as this may lead to overtreatment, especially in patients who might otherwise qualify for less invasive neck management such as SLNB. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to systematically evaluate bone invasion in the context of tumor size reclassification and its direct impact on occult CLNM. Notably, no prospective SLNB trials to date have provided specific evidence on small T4a tumors with bone invasion, leaving a critical gap in clinical guidance for this subgroup. Nevertheless, several limitations must be mentioned. First, the retrospective and monocentric nature of our study limits the generalizability of the results. In particular, the small number of reclassified T1-sized tumors with bone invasion warrants caution in overinterpreting these findings. Furthermore, bone invasion was treated as a binary variable without differentiation between cortical and medullary involvement, which may additionally underestimate its biological heterogeneity. On the other hand, the study benefits from a large, well-defined cohort and robust statistical modeling. 5. Conclusions While our study demonstrates that bone invasion is significantly associated with an increased risk of occult CLNM in OSCC tumors of T1 size, this association does not persist in tumors of T2 or T3 size, where bone invasion does not offer additional predictive value for occult metastasis or regional failure. These findings challenge the current uniform upstaging of all bone-invasive tumors to pT4a and suggest that the prognostic relevance of bone invasion may be size-dependent. While the pathological T classification outperformed tumor size alone in predictive modeling, it should not be applied as a strictly linear risk gradient. In smaller tumors, particularly those otherwise qualifying as early-stage disease, assigning pT4a status based solely on bone invasion may lead to overtreatment and unnecessary intensification of neck management. Therefore, these findings support a more differentiated approach to T4a OSCC and raise the potential for surgical de-escalation, such as SLNB, in carefully selected patients. However, prospective studies, including trials incorporating SLNB in small bone-invasive OSCCs, are needed to validate these implications and guide future directions.
