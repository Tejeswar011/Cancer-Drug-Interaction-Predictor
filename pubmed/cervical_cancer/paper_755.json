The objective of this study is to determine the correlation between inflammatory and oxidative stress markers with global DNA methylation after adjusting for personal, psychological, biochemical, anthropometric, and physiological variables in a non-representative sample of the Mexican population. An adult Mexican population was invited to participate and complete a questionnaire with personal and psychological variables. Additionally, anthropometric variables and blood pressure were measured in all the participants. Finally, general blood tests, global DNA methylation analysis, and measurements of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers were performed. A total of 157 participants were included, of which 83 (52.8%) were women, with a median age of 24 years and an age range of 18–58 years. In the comparison between sexes, men showed higher levels of global DNA methylation. In addition, men showed a higher number of correlations with this variable. The bivariate correlations showed low positive correlations of IL-8, IL-10, TNF-α, and 8-isoprostane with global DNA methylation in the total sample. In addition, BMI showed low negative and significant correlations with global DNA methylation in the total, women’s, and men’s samples, while blood pressure showed low negative correlations with global DNA methylation in the men’s sample. Men showed low negative correlations with personal and biochemical variables that were not found in the women’s group. In the multivariate analyses, the psychological variables (SOC-13 comprehensibility, perceived stress, and assertiveness) correlated negatively either in the total, or in men’s or women’s samples, and the daily intake of drugs correlated negatively with methylation in the women’s sample in the bivariate and multivariate analyses. In conclusion, global DNA methylation seems to be related to many variables, including the inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, and this relationship is different in each sex. global DNA methylation cytokines inflammation oxidative stress sex-specific Universidad de Guadalajara (University of Guadalajara), Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico PRO-SNI PIN-2024-IV This study was supported by funds of supporting research PRO-SNI and PIN-2024-IV, provided by the Universidad de Guadalajara (University of Guadalajara), Guadalajara Jalisco, Mexico. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Epigenetics refers to the processes that trigger and preserve inheritable gene expression patterns without modifying the DNA sequence itself [ 1 2 3 4 5 4 6 4 7 8 4 Alterations in global DNA methylation have been investigated in relation to various diseases and conditions. A large genome-wide DNA methylation study in three large population cohorts identified 5168 age-associated CpG sites that exhibited altered methylation patterns during aging. Among these sites, the majority (61%) showed demethylation in relation to age [ 9 9 10 11 12 13 14 Regarding studies searching for gene-specific methylation, a meta-analysis conducted on essential hypertension reported different methylation patterns of the studied genes. Some genes showed hypermethylation, whereas others showed hypomethylation, suggesting an aberrant epigenomic modulation of candidate genes involved in hemodynamics and homeostasis [ 15 16 17 18 18 17 19 However, the search for a correlation of these cytokines, along with oxidative stress markers, with global DNA methylation in a sample of the Mexican adult population, adjusted by personal, psychological, and anthropometric variables, has not been performed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the associations of a comprehensive set of personal, psychological, biochemical, anthropometric, and physiological variables, along with inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, with global DNA methylation and to evaluate these associations through multivariate analyses in the total sample and stratified by sex. 2. Subjects and Methods 2.1. Ethical Considerations and Study Population The study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Research and Ethics committee of the Health Sciences University Center (approval number CI-06123, approved on 25 September 2024). All participants provided informed consent. 2.2. Subjects The selection criteria were as follows: (a) age from 18 to 60 years, (b) not pregnant, (c) not genetically related to another participant of the study (i.e., siblings, cousins). The exclusion criterion was the absence of measurement of any variable. 2.3. Study Design: This Is an Observational, Cross-Sectional Study The variables of interest were measured at a single time point without any intervention or manipulation by the researchers. This design allows for the identification of associations between variables but does not establish causal relationships, as temporal sequencing cannot be determined. 2.4. Procedures The invitation was carried out through announcements shared via social media platforms (such as WhatsApp Platforms, Inc., Menlo Park, CA, USA) and printed brochures. University students and staff from the Health Sciences University Center were personally invited. The advertisement was circulated over a two-month period, coinciding with the study duration. The research team ensured that all participants met the inclusion criteria. Those who agreed to participate were scheduled to meet in a computer lab at the University of Guadalajara, where they signed an informed consent form and completed an electronic questionnaire (using Google Forms) that gathered personal information. Prior to completing the questionnaire, anthropometric measurements—including body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)—were taken. Additionally, systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure were measured on the left arm using an Omron upper-arm blood pressure monitor (model HEM-7320, Omron corporation, Kyoto, Japan). To ensure accuracy, the readings from this device were cross-validated against those obtained using a standard manual blood pressure cuff in both the first and last participants of the study. 2.4.1. Personal and Psychological Variables Personal Variables The personal and sociodemographic variables assessed included: sex, age, education level, employment status, having a romantic partner, parental status, socioeconomic level, daily time spent on physical activity, daily hours of free time, and frequency of illegal drug, alcohol, and tobacco use. The latter was evaluated using a five-point scale ranging from “never” to “four or more times per week”. The presence of 27 illnesses within the past six months was assessed through self-report: diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2), thyroid problems, allergies (asthma, conjunctivitis, etc.), high cholesterol, gastritis, colitis or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), migraine/tension headache, skin problems (acne, neurodermatitis), gastrointestinal infections, ulcer disease (gastric or intestinal ulcer), sinusitis, kidney disease (renal failure, kidney stones), anorexia/bulimia, depression requiring medication, anxiety requiring medication, heart attack/angina, rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, ankylosing spondylitis), heart failure, stroke or cerebral infarction, chronic infections (HIV, tuberculosis, long COVID, etc.), cancer (breast, cervical, prostate, skin), leukemia or lymphoma, advanced cancer (metastasis), varicose veins (venous insufficiency, varicose veins), liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, fatty liver), chronic lung disease, respiratory infections (including COVID), hemiplegia (paralysis), and any other chronic illness (requiring medication or continuous management). We additionally measured the number of different drugs taken daily as the variable “daily drug intake”. Psychological Variables To measure physical symptoms we used the Somatic Symptoms Scale-8 (SSS-8) [ 20 Supplementary File S1 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Lifestyle Scales Sleep satisfaction was assessed using the first item of the OVIEDO sleep questionnaire, with response options ranging from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 7 (very satisfied). Sleep quality was evaluated through the second component of the questionnaire, which comprises five items, each rated on a scale from 0 (poor quality) to 4 (excellent quality) [ 31 32 2.4.2. Biological Sample Collection Fasting blood samples were obtained by venipuncture in all participants during the early morning hours (the participants had fasted for at least 8 h) by personnel or the research team. After the samples were obtained, the biochemical analyses were performed. 2.4.3. Biochemical Variable Measurement Analysis of biochemical variables was performed on blood samples obtained from all participants to quantify the following biochemical parameters: (1) complete blood count test (including hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, leukocytes, and their subpopulations); (2) total cholesterol and triglycerides; and (3) blood chemistry (including glucose and urea). The measurements were performed with the electronic impedance variation method (HORIBA ABX Micros ES 60, Hematology Analyzer) for the blood count tests and colorimetry (H-100 Automated Clinical Chemistry Analyzer) for all biochemical tests. 2.4.4. Serum Levels of Inflammatory and Oxidative Stress Biomarker Analysis The quantitation of serum biomarkers levels was performed using the ELISA technique, following the manufacturer’s instructions for each assay. Serum samples were cryopreserved at −80 degrees Celsius until their processing. To quantify TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, 8-isoprostane, and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine, we used catalog numbers MBS175820, MBS763092, MBS021993, MBS263843, MBS764410, MBS3802509, and MBS267161, respectively. All kits were obtained from Mybiosource (Mybiosource, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). 2.4.5. DNA Extraction Genomic DNA was extracted from the leukocytes in peripheral blood samples using the modified Miller and CTAB/DTAB method. DNA concentration (absorbance at 260 nm) and purity (ratio of absorbance at 260 nm to absorbance at 280 nm) were measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA). DNA was diluted in Tris-EDTA buffer to a 100 ng/μL concentration. 2.4.6. Inmmunoquantification of Global DNA Methylation Global DNA methylation was assessed in 100 ng of leukocyte-derived DNA, in duplicate. Methylated cytosine (5-mC) was identified using specific capture and detection antibodies and subsequently quantified via a standard curve and a colorimetric method by measuring absorbance at 450 nm with a microplate spectrophotometer, Multisca TM TM 2.4.7. Statistical Analysis To describe the continuous variables, we used mean and standard deviations when the distribution was parametric and median and ranges when it was non-parametric. To describe categorical variables, we used frequencies and percentages. To compare socio-demographic variables between sexes, we used a chi-squared test for qualitative variables and Student’s t-test or the Mann–Whitney U test for quantitative ones (depending on whether the distribution was parametric or non-parametric, respectively). To determine the correlation of the global DNA methylation values with each personal, psychological, biochemical, anthropometric, and physiological variable, along with inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, we used the Pearson and Spearman correlation tests, depending on whether the distribution of the data was parametric or non-parametric, respectively. To identify the independent variables most strongly associated with the percentage of global DNA methylation, a multiple linear regression analysis was performed using the stepwise method. The dependent variable (global DNA methylation) was continuous and not normally distributed, while the independent variables included continuous, dichotomous, and ordinal types. The stepwise approach was chosen to build a model in which all retained predictors were statistically significant. Analyses were conducted on the full sample and stratified by sex. This method allowed for control of potential confounding effects and provided adjusted significance values for each variable included in the model. All analyses were performed with the software SPSS v.25, and a p 3. Results A total of 176 persons agreed to participate and were included in the study. Nineteen participants were excluded because they did not complete the measurements, therefore a total of one hundred and fifty-seven participants were finally included in the analyses. Detailed descriptive data of participants and comparison between the sexes are summarized in Table 1 p p p p p With respect to blood analyses, which included complete blood count and clinical chemistry, we observed that women had a significantly higher platelet count (236.5 vs. 209.4 (1 × 103/uL), p p p p p p p p Cronbach’s alpha coefficients for all scales and subscales exceeded 0.6, suggesting that the measures were sufficiently reliable for analytical purposes. In Table 2 In the overall multivariate analysis, global DNA methylation was positively associated with interleukin-8 (IL-8), free time, and male sex, while BMI, diastolic blood pressure, and assertiveness were negatively associated. In the female subsample, positive associations were observed with 8-isoprostane and SSS-8 scores, whereas BMI, daily drug intake, PSS-10 scores, SOC-13 comprehensibility, and smoking frequency showed negative associations. In the male subsample, IL-8, monthly income, and free time were positively associated with global DNA methylation, while SOC-13 comprehensibility, diastolic blood pressure, and having a romantic partner were negatively associated ( Table 3 The multivariate regression models demonstrated good explanatory power, with the following fit statistics: for the total sample, R = 0.555 and R 2 2 2 4. Discussion In the comparison of the studied variables between sexes, we observed that most variables were similar between them, with the exception of some variables that have shown significant differences between sexes in previous reports, including a higher number of illnesses and somatization in women when compared with men [ 33 34 35 33 36 37 38 39 40 With reference to the inflammatory markers, we observed that IL-6 showed higher levels in women than in men, and this finding is related to the higher levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein found in women compared to men in a sample of a healthy Mexican population [ 41 42 43 44 With respect to global DNA methylation levels, we observed that men exhibited higher levels of global DNA methylation, and these findings coincide with a previous report in which higher methylation levels were found in men [ 45 46 45 46 Regarding the bivariate correlations in the total sample and segmented by sex, we observed that men showed a higher number of significative correlations with global DNA methylation, among which some inflammatory and oxidative stress markers showed positive correlations with global DNA methylation, including TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-10. All of them also showed significative low positive correlations in the total sample in which the oxidative stress marker 8-isoprostane also showed a low positive correlation. When adjusting by the other variables in the multivariate analysis, we observed that IL-8 remained positively correlated in the total and men’s sample, while the oxidative stress biomarker 8-isoprostane showed a significative positive correlation in the multivariate analyses in the women’s sample. These findings coincide with both hypotheses, suggesting a link between inflammation and oxidative stress and global DNA methylation in both sexes but with slight differences. In line with these findings, the study of Lorente-Sorolla et al. [ 18 47 19 Other variables that showed significant correlations with global DNA methylation included: age, blood pressure, BMI, and daily drug intake. Most of these variables showed low negative and significative correlations with global DNA methylation, mainly in the total and men’s samples, while BMI and daily drug intake were the only variables significantly correlated in women in the bivariate and multivariate analysis. In this regard, it has been reported that age is associated with lower DNA methylation levels [ 9 11 48 In relation to blood pressure, we observed that SBP and DBP were negatively correlated with global DNA methylation in the total and men’s samples, and only DBP remained significantly correlated with global DNA methylation in the multivariate analyses of the total and men’s samples. These results coincide with a report showing a negative correlation between placental DNA methylation and maternal mean blood pressure in mothers without a family history of hypertension [ 14 The negative correlation between daily drug intake observed in the bivariate analyses (in both the total sample and the women’s subsample), as well as in the multivariate analysis for the women’s group, is consistent with a previous report [ 49 49 With respect to the correlations found between global DNA methylation and psychological and behavioral variables, we observed that free time showed low positive but significant correlations with global DNA methylation in the total and men’s samples in the bivariate and multivariate analyses. These results have not been previously reported and suggest that behavioral variables could modify global DNA methylation and gene expression and deserve further investigations. These correlations are in line with the observed correlations of positive and negative psychological variables in the multivariate analyses of the total, men’s, and women’s samples. Interestingly, these correlations were not observed in the bivariate analyses but emerged after adjusting for covariates in the multivariate models. Among the associated variables, the subscale of comprehensibility of the SOC-13 scale was negatively correlated with global DNA methylation in men’s and women’s multivariate analyses. In addition, the subscale of assertiveness of the TEIQue scale was negatively correlated with global DNA methylation in the multivariate analysis of the total sample. Finally, perceived stress was also negatively correlated with global DNA methylation in the multivariate analysis of the women’s sample. Although no previous studies investigating these specific correlations were found, the present results are consistent with reports linking DNA methylation to psychological variables. For instance, one study reported increased DNA methylation in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder compared to controls [ 50 51 Other variables associated with global DNA methylation, including somatization, having a romantic partner, and monthly income in the multivariate analyses of men’s and women’s samples, have not been previously researched and should be further investigated. However, the negative borderline correlation between global DNA methylation and smoking frequency in the multivariate analyses of the women’s sample is in line with a previous report showing lower DNA methylation levels in LINE-1 repeat elements in smokers and vapers [ 52 The main limitations of the study are the small sample size, which increases the random bias and diminishes the precision in the correlations found, particularly when multiple comparisons and multivariate analyses with many variables are performed. Therefore, the results should be considered with caution and can be an antecedent for further larger studies. In addition, the transversal nature of the study impedes us from determining potential causal relationships. However, the inclusion of a large number of variables diminishes the confusion bias by adjusting the confounding factors or covariables. In addition, the sex-segmented analyses permitted more specific associations related to sex. In conclusion, global DNA methylation was positively correlated with inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers and negatively correlated with a wide range of personal, psychological, anthropometric, and physiological variables. Many of these associations remained significant in the multivariate analysis. Among them, male sex, BMI, SBP, and DBP appeared to be the most relevant variables to control in association studies, as they are easy to measure and do not require extensive resources. Additionally, variables such as daily free time, perceived stress, and the SOC-13 subscale of comprehensibility may also influence these associations in analytical studies. Furthermore, the cytokines TNF-α, IL-8, and IL-10 and the oxidative stress marker 8-isoprostane showed weak but significant positive correlations with global DNA methylation and could represent important confounding factors to consider. Finally, our findings suggest that global DNA methylation is associated with inflammatory and oxidative stress processes, particularly in men. However, the direction of this causal relationship, as well as its connection to specific DNA regions and genes, should be further explored in larger, longitudinal studies incorporating both epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) and gene-specific analyses.
