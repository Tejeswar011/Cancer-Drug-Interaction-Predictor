The clinical efficacy of current standard‐of‐care treatments against brain tumors has been minimal, with no significant improvement over the past 30 years. Driven by the success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)‐T cells in the clinic for treating certain types of cancer, adoptive cell therapies have been of interest as a hopeful therapeutic modality for brain tumors. Clinical trials of GBM‐targeting cell therapies, including CAR‐T cells, have been initiated; however, none of them have been approved yet, and new challenges have emerged from the completed clinical trials. These issues are being addressed in ongoing clinical trials and recent preclinical research efforts. Herein, we present an overview of the clinical landscape of cell therapies against brain tumors. We analyze past and active 203 clinical trials focusing on cell therapies for brain tumors, discuss limitations for their clinical translation, and highlight emerging approaches to address these challenges. In addition, we review select preclinical studies that show promise to improve the therapeutic efficacy of therapeutic cells on brain tumors and discuss future prospects. brain tumors cell engineering cell therapy clinical challenges clinical trials glioblastoma multiforme immunotherapy Uehara Memorial Foundation and The New Pharmaceutical Technology and Engineering Foundation Sara Borell (CD20/00054) and the fellowship for “International Researchers Mobility” (MV22/00079) from Carlos III Health Institute, Spain National Institutes of Health 10.13039/100000002 R35GM150507 R21CA291723 Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences 10.13039/100007887 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  Fukuta T Shaha S da Silva‐Candal A Zhao Z Mitragotri S Cell therapies against brain tumors: Clinical development and emerging prospects Bioeng Transl Med 2025 10 5 e70018 10.1002/btm2.70018 Tatsuya Fukuta and Suyog Shaha have contributed equally to this study.  Translational Impact Statement The clinical efficacy of standard‐of‐care therapies for malignant brain tumors has been very limited and has remained unchanged for decades. The use of living cells as therapies has gained significant interest for overcoming challenges faced by conventional therapeutics. However, several challenges have emerged in clinical trials pursuing this approach, and efforts to address these challenges are ongoing. This article provides an overview of the landscape in clinical trials for cell therapies against malignant brain tumors, discusses pressing clinical challenges, and highlights promising preclinical approaches. 1 INTRODUCTION Although brain tumors account for only 1%–2% of all types of cancers, they are among the most deadly tumors.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7 Immunotherapies, such as tumor vaccines, oncolytic viruses, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and cell therapy, have emerged as promising new treatments for brain tumors.  8  9  10  11  12  13 Cell therapies have significant potential to tackle these issues since they possess unique advantages over other conventional therapeutic modalities. Living cells have intrinsic abilities to efficiently cross biological barriers, including the BBB, and target specific cell types by responding to both systemic and local physical, chemical, or biological stimuli.  14  15  16  17  18 1 1a 1b 1c clinicaltrials.gov FIGURE 1 Clinical landscape of cell therapies for treating brain tumors. (a) The increase in the number of published literature (Identified from PubMed database) and (b) clinical trials (Identified from ClinicalTrials.gov 2 THE ORIGINS AND EARLY DEVELOPMENTS OF CELLULAR THERAPIES FOR BRAIN TUMORS The emergence of cellular therapies has made a significant paradigm shift in brain tumor therapy. In this section, we review the early advances of cellular therapies for brain tumors, tracing their conceptual origins and the pivotal early efforts that have paved the way for current clinical advancements. One of the earliest and seminal cell therapy strategies for brain tumor treatment involved the application of lymphokine‐activated killer (LAK) cells. This earliest study with LAK cells in the treatment of malignant glioma was reported in April 1986.  19  20  21  21  22 8 11 4 6 The findings from early preclinical and clinical studies with LAK cells provided foundational insights that paved the way for subsequent cell therapy strategies for GBM. Following these findings, tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were identified as the next promising candidates for cell therapy. TILs demonstrated the potential for improved tumor targeting and enhanced eradication of tumor cells compared to LAKs.  23  24  25  26  27  28 Subsequent studies and clinical trials have expanded upon these findings, exploring diverse cell therapies to advance the field. Clinical trials have continued to investigate the tolerability, efficacy, and long‐term outcomes of cell therapies for brain cancers. New advances in cell engineering, genetic modification techniques, and personalized treatment approaches have driven ongoing developments in the field. The clinical trajectory of cell therapy for GBM has witnessed remarkable progress over the years. While challenges remain, the continuous improvement in clinical trials offers hope for improved treatment outcomes in GBM patients. The clinical landscape and emerging trends in cell therapies for brain tumors were analyzed and discussed in the next sections. 3 CLINICAL TRIAL ANALYSIS FOR CELLULAR THERAPIES FOR BRAIN TUMORS In this section, we categorized and discussed past and active clinical trials involving therapeutic cells for treating brain tumors. We searched clinical trials on the ClinicalTrials.gov 3.1 T cell The recent progress of T‐cell therapy against diverse tumor types, especially in hematological cancers, generates enthusiasm for investigating their application in patients with brain tumors.  29  30  31 1  32  17  33 2a 2b TABLE 1 Representative clinical trials for brain tumor therapies using T cells.

FIGURE 2 The current landscape of clinical trials using T cells for brain tumors. The distribution of trials based on (a) trial status, (b) trial phase, (c) delivery route, and (d) use of lymphodepletion is shown for 1990–2015, 2016–2024, and the overall period. The administration route of T cells is emerging as one of the key parameters in brain tumor treatment, especially with the challenges related to the unique BBB.  34 2c  29 NCT05459441 NCT04077866  35  36  37  38  35 Lymphodepletion conditioning is another critical component of clinical studies for adoptive T cell transfer therapies. All currently FDA‐approved T cell therapy products use lymphodepletion as a preparative conditioning regimen. This process depletes endogenous lymphocytes, creating a niche for T cell engraftment and enhancing the persistence of adoptive T cells, particularly after intravenous infusion. Additionally, the lymphodepletion regimen reduces tumor cells, leading to the release of soluble immunomodulatory factors and reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. These effects further improve T cell homing and long‐term survival, ultimately enhancing therapeutic efficacy.  39  40  41 2d  32  42 NCT00693095 NCT02664363  29 Antigen‐specific killing is a crucial targeting mechanism for T cell therapies (Figure 3a NCT00331526 NCT00807027  43 NCT00002572 NCT01144247  44 3a FIGURE 3 The current landscape of clinical trials using T cells regarding (a) use of specific targeting, (b) cell type, (c) use of gene editing, and (d) T cell donor type. The distribution of trials is shown for 1990–2015, 2016–2024, and the overall period, respectively. Several engineering strategies have emerged for generating T cells against brain tumor antigens (Figure 3b  45  46 NCT00003185 NCT01081223 NCT01290692 NCT03396575 NCT05685004  17  47 NCT03347097 To address the dearth of endogenous antigen‐specific T cells, genetic engineering has emerged as a promising strategy, with gene‐engineered CAR T cells leading the way in the development of brain tumors. 72.1% of T cell trials for brain tumors employ genetic engineering (Figure 3c  48 NCT01454596 NCT02209376  49 NCT03726515 Besides mutant EGFR, IL13Rα2 is another popular antigen candidate that is overexpressed on brain tumor cells compared to healthy brain tissue. Its expression increases more with the development of tumors. It was an early target for CAR T‐cell therapy in brain cancer ( NCT00730613 NCT00730613 NCT01082926  50  51 NCT02208362 NCT04510051 NCT04661384 NCT04003649 Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is another widely used target in CAR T cell therapy. HER2 is highly abundant in brain tumors with low levels in normal tissue, including healthy brain tissue.  52  53 NCT01109095  54 NCT03389230 NCT02442297 NCT03696030 NCT04903080 Another intriguing target that has gained attraction over recent years is the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) antigen present in brain tumors. Several studies found CMV antigen in human glioma while it is absent in normal tissues, including surrounding healthy brain tissue.  55 NCT02661282  56 NCT00990496 NCT00693095  57 NCT01205334 NCT01109095  58 While the above‐mentioned antigen targets show promising benefits in brain tumor treatment, the therapeutic effects have not been long‐lasting.  48  29  48 NCT04077866 NCT05835687 NCT04385173 NCT05366179 NCT05474378 NCT05241392 NCT03423992 NCT04099797 NCT04196413 NCT05298995 NCT05544526 NCT02617134 NCT04045847 NCT04214392 NCT05627323 NCT04270461 NCT04550663 NCT05131763 NCT05353530 NCT05577091 The preliminary reports suggest limited therapeutic impact in the clinical setting by targeting a single antigen.  38  49  59  60  61  62 NCT05168423 NCT05768880  63 In addition to genetically engineered CAR T cells, genetic modification of T cells with TCR has also moved to clinical trials for brain tumors. While current CAR T cells, which dominate the clinical landscape, are capable of recognizing only surface targets, TCR T cells open new avenues with the ability to recognize MHC complex‐bound peptides derived from intracellular proteins.  32 NCT02774291  64 NCT05478837  65 The use of γδT cells, which are emerging to be another interesting T‐cell type for cancer therapy, has moved into clinical investigation.  66  67  68  69  70 NCT05664243 NCT04165941 In addition to coming up with new strategies to engineer and source T cells, combination with other therapeutic modalities is also a prospective approach to improve the cold brain tumor environment and achieve adoptive T cell effective activity.  30  71  72 NCT03726515 NCT04003649 NCT03294954  30 NCT01454596 NCT00003185 NCT01326104 NCT01081223 NCT01290692 NCT03334305 NCT03396575 NCT04837547 NCT05685004 NCT00693095  57 91.3% of T cells employed in the clinical trials are autologous (Figure 3d  32 Clinical experience with adoptive T cells for brain tumors until now has provided valuable insights to help in shaping recent trials. Locoregional administration, inclusion of lymphodepletion in the dosing regimen, well‐defined multiple antigen targeting, genetic engineering of T cells, especially for CAR T production, and autologous cell sourcing are key aspects that are increasingly becoming popular in T cell clinical trial design. Initial indications warrant the need for the therapies to act simultaneously or in series through multiple pathways to overcome the different obstacles posed by brain tumors. It will also be critical for strategies that have already been found safe to be incorporated in future trial designs to shed more light on underlying resistance and their application for generating therapeutic responses. This information will enable a path forward with better designs of T cell regimens and combinations to overcome limitations for brain tumor treatment and translate promising T cell therapies for brain tumors. 3.2 Dendritic cells DCs are the main antigen‐presenting cells (APCs) involved in the crosstalk of the innate and adaptive immune systems to induce immune responses against tumors. Numerous preclinical studies revealed that treatment with DC vaccines induces tumor‐specific cytotoxic T‐cell responses in association with the infiltration of T cells into GBM tissue, which allows for the suppression of tumor growth, the extension of the survival rate, and long‐lasting antitumoral memory.  73 4 2 FIGURE 4 The clinical landscape of DC‐based clinical trials. A total of 79 clinical trials were identified and analyzed according to (a) trial phase, (b) trial status, (c) start year, (d) delivery route, (e) tumor conditions (GBM, metastasis, or other types of brain tumors), (f) use of combination strategies, and (g) donor type.

The details of the phase (Figure 4a 4b 4 4c For patients with brain tumors, 68% of the trials are performed by administration of DC vaccines through the intradermal route, while subcutaneous (7.1%) and intranodal (7.1%) are other preferred routes. Unsurprisingly, intravenous injections are the least favorable route for DC vaccines, owing to their mechanism of action involving entry into lymph nodes through the lymphatic system. In certain trials ( NCT04888611 NCT04388033 NCT00323115  74  75 NCT00323115  76 NCT04388033 NCT04888611 Ex vivo pretreatment of DCs is essential to induce a robust anti‐tumor immune response with a DC vaccine. Trials for patients with brain tumors employ three different methods. The most common method is the pretreatment of DCs with an autologous tumor antigen cocktail or lysate isolated from patients' tumor tissue during surgery or tumor cell lysate prepared by the primary culture of allogeneic tumor tissue. The most progressed active phase 3 trial utilizes autologous tumor antigen‐loaded DCs, a DC product named AV‐GBM‐1 ( NCT05100641  77 NCT00045968  78  79  80  81  82 NCT01326104 NCT03396575 NCT03334305 NCT04837547 NCT03548571  83  83 DC‐based brain tumor therapy is mostly applied to GBM among other brain tumor types, with only lesser applications in metastatic brain tumors (Figure 4e 4f NCT03879512  84 NCT03688178 Notably, all the DC‐based trials use autologous cells from patients' blood (Figure 4g  85  86 3.3 Natural killer ( NK Natural killer cells are the major innate lymphocytes that exert cytotoxic effects on tumor cells.

They are categorized by their differentiation lineages. For therapeutic application to brain tumors, neural stem cells (NSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and HSCs have been employed. At present, 9.9% of clinical trials for brain tumor therapy are occupied by stem cells (Figure 6 4 FIGURE 6 Landscape of stem cell‐based clinical trials.

Since NSCs have a high tropism for brain tumor cells with a remarkable ability to migrate deeply into tumor mass, they have been applied as delivery vehicles for several types of therapeutics, such as oncolytic viruses, enzymes, and cytokines, to treat brain cancer.  99  100 6 4 All six trials utilizing NSCs were phase 1 studies (100%) to evaluate safety and determine the optimal dosage of NSC products for future phase 2 studies. Interestingly, none of the trials employed autologous cell sources. Two trials utilized allogeneic NSCs, while the rest of the four trials used a cell line HB1.F3 NSCs. The immortalized NSC cell line is obtained from the fatal telencephalon of pregnant women at 15 weeks of gestation.  101 E. coli  102 A notable feature of the clinical trials using NSCs is that all trials employ modified NSCs. A trial intracranially injecting genetically modified HB.1F3 NSCs expressing CD found no dose‐limiting toxicity, and injected NSC cells could migrate to distant tumor areas.  103  103 NCT02015819 NCT02192359  104  105 Another notable approach with modified NSCs uses NSCs loading an oncolytic adenovirus. In a phase 1 trial, CRAd‐Survivin‐pk7 (CRAd‐S‐pk7), a conditional replication adenovirus that brings about selectivity to brain cancer cells via the tumor‐specific survivin promoter and fiber modification,  106 NCT03072134  107 NCT05139056 NCT03072134 3.4.2 Mesenchymal stem cells MSCs are harvested from several tissues, including bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose tissue, and placenta. Similar to the tumor tropism behavior of NSCs, many experimental studies have reported the brain tumor tropism and migration ability of MSCs in the orthotopic GBM models, independent of the injection routes.  108  109  110  108  111 6 4 Among the four trials, two trials are phase 1 studies (50%), and the remaining two trials are phase 1/2 (50%) for evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the MSC products. Although one trial does not specify the cellular source, the other three trials utilize allogeneic bone marrow‐derived (50%) or adipose‐derived MSCs (25%) as therapeutic cells. The tendency to utilize allogeneic cells reflects the trend of off‐the‐shelf manufacturing, which was seen both in other investigated MSC therapies for different diseases and recently approved MSC therapy (Alofisel) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).  32  112 Notably, three out of four trials (75%) utilize modified MSCs loaded with oncolytic viruses or the suicide gene. In an active phase 1 trial ( NCT03896568  113  114 NCT04758533  115 NCT04657315 A phase 1 trial with non‐modified MSCs is performed utilizing allogeneic adipose‐derived MSCs (AMSCs) in treating patients with recurrent GBM ( NCT05789394  108 3.4.3 Hematopoietic stem cells Hematopoietic stem cells are multipotent stem cells derived from mature blood cells of the myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages. HSCs can be obtained from mobilized peripheral blood, cord blood, and bone marrow. Other stem cell types are utilized for their anti‐tumor benefits against brain tumors, while HSCs, except for one trial, are mainly used as regenerative therapy to replace blood cells that are destroyed by previously administered chemotherapeutic drugs. Such rescue allows investigators to inject higher doses of chemotherapy to efficiently kill tumor cells. The process of HSC therapy consists of HSC collection, ex vivo purification, and cell engineering, followed by infusion into the patients to restore their hematopoietic function.  116 There was a total of 10 clinical trials employing HSCs (50% of stem cell‐based trials). The majority of trials (9 out of 10) utilize autologous HSCs. 60% of trials use genetically modified HSC products. Among them, three trials use P140K‐methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) gene‐modified CD34+ HSCs to avoid hematopoietic toxicity induced by combination therapy with temozolomide (TMZ) and O 6 6 NCT05052957 NCT01269424 NCT00669669  117 6 6 6 6  118 One trial utilizes autologous HSCs modified genetically with a specific lentiviral vector encoding for the human interferon (IFN)‐α2 gene ( NCT03866109  119 3.5 Monocyte Monocytes are one of the myeloid immune cells and the precursors of macrophages. Monocytes are known to cross the inflamed endothelial barrier, including the BBB, reach hypoxic regions of tumors, and finally differentiate into tumor‐associated macrophages (TAM) in the tumor tissues.  120  121  122 We could find one completed phase 1 trial utilizing lymphokine‐activated monocytes combined with bispecific antibodies for treating recurrent or refractory GBM patients ( NCT00005813  123  124 NCT04741984  125  126  127  128  129 4 LEARNING FROM CLINICAL TRIALS AND APPROACHES TO ADDRESS CLINICAL CHALLENGES According to our analysis discussed before, over 50% of all trials are still phase 1 studies, whereas several trials have progressed to phase 2 or later. Notably, a few trials utilizing T cells ( NCT05685004 NCT00807027 NCT05100641 NCT00045968 NCT03548571 NCT02496988 4.1 Selection of targeting antigens Approaches targeting tumor‐associated specific antigens have been employed in a lot of clinical trials utilizing CAR‐expressing T/NK cells and DC‐based cancer vaccines. With high inter‐patient and intra‐tumor heterogeneity observed in GBM tissues, the selection of the right target antigen has paramount importance. Since CARs only recognize cell surface proteins, elucidation of proper and specific antigens is an essential constraint for CAR‐engineered cell therapies. In clinical trials with CAR‐T cell therapies, EGFRvIII, HER2, and IL‐13Rα2 have often been targeted. However, EGFRvIII is known to be expressed in only approximately 30% of the patients, and its expression across different patients is heterogeneous.  130  53  131  59  132  132  133  134  135  134  136 NCT03548571 Targeting multiple antigens is emerging to be a hopeful strategy for addressing challenges related to tumor heterogeneity of GBM since identifying specific and homogenously expressed antigens has been extremely difficult. This approach is mainly investigated in T‐cell and DC‐based therapy. Regarding CAR‐T cell therapy, only a few phase 1 trials have utilized CAR‐T cells that target multiple antigens ( NCT05577091 NCT05868083 NCT05168423 NCT05577091 NCT05868083 NCT05168423  62 NCT03373097 NCT02414269 NCT04196413  137  138 NCT06186401  139 NCT06046040 NCT05373147 NCT05089266  140  141  142  143  144 Regarding DC‐based cancer vaccines, a lot of active clinical trials are exploring multi‐targeting approaches using autologous tumor antigens, total tumor RNA (TTRNA), and multiple tumor antigen peptides ( NCT04968366  145 4.2 Viable Route of administration The administration route of cell products varies depending on the cell types, with trials employing either intravenous or locoregional infusion approaches. To date, there is no approach for implanting a scaffold or depot loaded with cells for brain tumor treatment in clinical trials. Intravenous injection remains the most accessible method for injection. Intravenously injected immune cells have a better capability to enter the CNS by responding to biological cues compared to non‐living therapeutics. However, systemic infusion into the bloodstream faces significant challenges, such as inefficient migration across the BBB and blood‐CSF‐barrier, and limited infiltration through the dense tumor stroma, making this approach less effective for cell therapies targeting brain tumors.  146  147  59 NCT05459441 NCT04077866 DC vaccines utilize intradermal injection as a preferred administration route in clinical trials. However, one limitation of this route seen in melanoma patients is that intradermally administered DCs exhibit limited migration, with <5% of the injected cells reaching the drainage lymph nodes.  148 NCT04888611 NCT04388033 NCT00323115  149  75 4.3 Persistence of administered therapeutic cells The strongly immunosuppressive TME induces exhaustion of tumor‐infiltrating T and NK cells, resulting in a drastic reduction in their effector function, continuous inhibitory receptor expression, and lower production of effector cytokines (e.g., IFN‐γ, TNF‐α, IL‐2, and granzyme B).  150  151  152 NCT04003649 NCT03726515 NCT04254419  153 NCT03879512 NCT04201873 NCT04348747 NCT04888611 NCT02529072 NCT03879512 Another way that has been employed to avoid exhaustion of the therapeutic cells is a gene‐editing approach to knock out genes involved in T cell exhaustion. In one preclinical study utilizing the CRISPR‐Cas9 system, CAR T cells having resistance to checkpoint signaling were created by knocking out PD‐1, endogenous T‐cell receptor, and beta‐2 microglobulin. The intracranial infusion of the gene‐edited CAR T cells targeting EGFRVIII, but not intravenous infusion, prolonged survival of the GBM model mice compared with non‐edited CAR T cells.  154  155 NCT03399448  156 Gene editing is also employed for NK cells to avoid their dysfunction. Although a currently active phase 4 trial using cytokine‐induced killer (CIK) cells ( NCT02496988  157  158  92 NCT04991870  159  160 4.4 Safety of allogeneic off‐the‐shelf products Achieving off‐the‐shelf cellular products for brain tumors is key to overcoming the logistical challenges of deploying such therapies. Currently, all DC trials use autologous cells, similar to the clinically approved products, Provenge, CreaVax, and APCeden, although these products are not indicated for brain tumors. Patient's autologous cells are used in most T‐cell trials. However, such treatments with autologous cells have notable limitations. Since the cell products need to be generated using cells from each patient, the process is time‐consuming and resource‐intensive which poses the risk of manufacturing failures, especially in cases of multiple infusions. The difficulty in establishing standardized preparation methods also creates issues for regulatory approval of the product.  161  162  163  164  165  166 NCT05664243 NCT04165941  167  168  169  170  171  172  173 In contrast to T cell and DC approaches, allogeneic cell sources have been employed more prevalently in clinical trials using NK cells, creating a higher possibility of having off‐the‐shelf products. Since allogeneic NK cells derived from PBMCs of healthy donors possess greater anti‐tumor activity than exhausted NK cells derived from immune‐suppressed GBM patients, the use of allogeneic cell sources is considered advantageous in NK‐based GBM therapy.  174 NCT04489420 NCT04991870 NCT05588453 NCT03383978  175  175  176 5 SELECTED PRECLINICAL STUDIES, TECHNOLOGIES, AND OUTLOOK New approaches in the preclinical setting are emerging with the potential to address the challenges for clinical translation of brain tumor‐targeting cell therapies. We discuss some examples of these recent preclinical studies in this section. Schematic summaries of this section are presented in Figure 7 FIGURE 7 Schematic summaries of selected promising preclinical studies. (1) Universal CAR T cell engineering approach to develop a targeted cell therapy independent of endogenous antigen expression. Adapted with permission from Ren et al.  165  167  170  175 5.1 Genetic modification approaches Genetic engineering has been a primary strategy for cell modification to augment the anti‐tumor functions of therapeutic cells. Numerous innovative genetic engineering strategies have emerged in recent years to overcome challenges of cell therapies for brain tumors. One strategy involves designing CAR gene constructs with downstream supporting molecules such as cytokines, checkpoint inhibitors, and chemokines.  177  178  179  52  157  180  181  182 5.2 Administration method of therapeutic cells Clinical experience with cell therapies for brain tumors has shown that the delivery route is crucial to their success.  35  183  184  185  186 5.3  BBB Apart from modifying cells or using various routes of administration, many other approaches have been investigated to promote therapeutic cell infiltration into the brain. One promising strategy is to transiently elicit the BBB opening. Sabbagh et al.  187 +  187  188  189 NCT04614493 NCT04446416 NCT04528680 NCT05864534 5.4 Material‐based cell‐surface engineering Material‐based cell surface engineering is another promising approach for improving the therapeutic effect of cells. This approach offers several advantages, including enhancement of cell trafficking, targeted delivery of therapeutic molecules to desired tissues, and modulation of the immunophenotype of carrier cells. One promising approach in cell surface engineering for cancer immunotherapy is the use of disk‐shaped microparticles, termed “backpacks” which attach to the cell surface without being internalized due to their high aspect ratio.  190  191  191  192  193  34  129  194  195  196 6 CONCLUSIONS Clinical efficacy of the current standard therapy against brain tumors, particularly GBM, continues to show poor clinical efficacy. Despite being the standard for over 30 years, there has been little meaningful improvement in patient outcomes. Cells represent a promising therapeutic modality in transforming the challenging landscape of treating brain tumors. Our article discusses the history of adoptive cell transfer for brain tumor therapy, critically analyzes their clinical landscape, and identifies key challenges from past clinical experience. We also highlight recent promising preclinical studies to address such challenges. The number of clinical trials and preclinical studies for brain tumor treatment using cell therapies has been increasing, particularly following the clinical success of CAR‐T cell therapies. Several clinical challenges have emerged from clinical trials investigating various types of cell therapies against brain cancer, which include intricate tumor heterogeneity, poor delivery efficiency, and exhaustion of injected cells in the immunosuppressive TME. Significant efforts are being made to address these clinical challenges through the development of new genetic modifications, material‐based engineering approaches, and optimized locoregional delivery methods. Given the success of cell therapies in the clinic for other cancer types and the ongoing development in preclinical and clinical settings, cell therapy products are expected to become viable treatment options for brain tumor patients. Continued research and collaborations will be essential for refining these therapies and realizing their full potential in the fight against this devastating disease.
