Anti-Inflammatory Effects Inflammatory response is a central regulatory hub in the pathological processes of many diseases [ 13 14 15 16 Salmonella Salmonella A large number of studies have reported that AA can improve inflammation through multiple targets and pathways. Extensive research supports the core anti-inflammatory mechanism, which may lie in the activation or inhibition of upstream mechanisms, thereby regulating the expression of downstream factors and ultimately achieving a certain anti-inflammatory effect. In summary, AA primarily reduces the expression of downstream pro-inflammatory factors (TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-6) and inflammatory mediators (COX-2/iNOS) through mechanisms such as activating upstream antioxidants (Nrf2), inhibiting pro-inflammatory factors (NF-κB/NLRP3), and regulating metabolic pathways (PPARγ). The key anti-inflammatory mechanisms are summarized in Table 1 Studies on various types of inflammation have found that AA inhibits the release of inflammatory factors through multiple targets and pathways, with regulation of the NF-κB pathway being the most common pathway. At the same time, the anti-inflammatory effects of AA mostly stem from short-term cellular effects (such as apoptosis and proliferation) and the regulation of signaling pathways. Some studies have not involved animal experiments or the long-term efficacy of AA in chronic inflammation. Future research should explore the long-term efficacy of AA in chronic inflammation animal models and assess its impact on chronic inflammation biomarkers. Additionally, the potential for combining AA with other anti-inflammatory drugs should be explored. 2.2. Hepatoprotective Effects The liver is responsible for a variety of physiological activities in the body, including detoxification, antioxidant activity and immunomodulation [ 30 31 Degs1 32 33 4 34 35 2.3. Anti-Tumor Effects AA has remarkable anti-tumor activity, inhibiting a variety of cancers such as breast cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, etc., through a multi-pathway and multi-target approach. Tian et al. [ 36 −1 37 −1 38 −1 39 40 AA also showed significant inhibitory effects on drug-resistant cancer cells. It has been found [ 41 42 43 Signaling pathways and metabolic dysfunction play crucial roles in disease progression, particularly the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, which exerts key effects in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancer, and other cancers [ 44 45 46 47 Based on the antitumor effects of AA, some researchers have recently predicted the feasibility of AA in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), a primary brain tumor, based on a network pharmacology perspective [ 48 Current research findings indicate that the anti-tumor efficacy of AA is not reliant on a single target but rather involves modulating a range of key signaling pathways and their upstream and downstream molecules, thereby establishing a complex regulatory network to exert its anti-tumor effects. AA suppresses a range of downstream pro-metastatic and anti-apoptotic molecules (e.g., VEGF, MMPs, FAK, Cyclins, Bcl-2, MDR-transporters) by downregulating the expression of core signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/AKT/mTOR, ERK MAPK, TGF-β/Smad, Wnt/β-catenin, etc.) and upregulating the expression and activity of pro-apoptotic molecules (e.g., Bax/Bak, Caspases), which regulate the cell cycle and induce apoptosis. These upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms interact synergistically, forming a complex network that underpins the multi-target and multi-pathway anti-tumor effects of AA. In this manner, it exerts inhibitory effects on a range of malignant tumors, including breast, lung, ovarian, and nasopharyngeal cancers. However, current research still has certain limitations. First, studies on the antitumor effects of AA involve multiple models (in vivo/in vitro, cell/animal), resulting in a relatively wide range of effective doses for AA. Therefore, future research should focus on standardized models and dose–response relationships. In addition, AA’s antitumor effects involve multiple signaling pathways, but research on each pathway is relatively independent. The primary and secondary roles of each pathway, their relationships, and whether they have a coordinated effect require further study. The main mechanism of action is shown in Table 2 2.4. Hypoglycemic Effects AA has also shown some therapeutic potential in metabolic diseases in recent years. In a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model [ 57 58 −1 Impaired insulin secretion by pancreatic β-cells is a prominent feature of type II diabetes mellitus [ 59 60 61 −1 2.5. Neuroprotective Effects AA has been reported to be effective in improving neurological disorders caused by aluminum toxicity, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), epilepsy, and other disorders, and can also alleviate hippocampal neurodegeneration and memory deficits [ 62 63 64 65 66 67 23–25 23–25 68 Another study [ 69 −1 70 71 In summary, AA has demonstrated good neuroprotective effects in various models of neurological diseases. In addition, the mechanism of action of AA varies across different studies. Its core mechanism of action lies in effectively alleviating oxidative stress, improving mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibiting various forms of cell death. Therefore, it achieves neuroprotection through multi-target, multi-pathway synergy. Nevertheless, in order to successfully transition from the experimental stage to clinical application, it is still necessary to overcome the limitations of the model and clarify the pharmacokinetic characteristics and safety of AA in the human body. 2.6. Cardioprotective Effects AA has great potential in preventing cardiovascular diseases: it can improve doxorubicin-induced cardiac output abnormalities by blocking the release of cTnI from plasma, and it can also ameliorate oxidative damage by activating the AKT and Nrf2 signaling pathways to improve cardiac function [ 72 73 74 75 76 77 −1 −1 Aarti Tiwari [ 78 −1 −1 79 2.7. Antibacterial Effects AA has significant antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Research has found that AA can inhibit 19 different strains of Clostridium difficile to varying degrees at low concentrations (10–20 µg·mL −1 80 81 82 −1 Staphylococcus aureus AA can also interact with DNA or proteins formed by the mitotic spindle, affecting cell replication and interfering with cell division. It exhibits inhibitory activity against various Gram-negative bacteria (urinary tract pathogenic Escherichia coli Enterobacter cloacae Pseudomonas aeruginosa −1 83 Shigella 84 In addition to bacteria, AA also exhibits activity against fungi. Wang et al. [ 85 Candida albicans Candida albicans Candida albicans −1 −1 −1 −1 Candida albicans 85 2.8. Protective Effect on the Skin and Wound Healing Effect AA, as a natural product, is an effective therapeutic agent for wound healing [ 86 87 88 89 −1 90 C. asiatica The protective effect of AA is also reflected in its ability to counteract external damaging factors. For example, it can inhibit the generation of ROS and lipid peroxidation induced by ultraviolet A (UVA) rays, and downregulate the expression of MMPs and p53, thereby providing a certain degree of protection for the skin [ 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 The signaling pathways associated with the diverse pharmacological effects of AA are illustrated in Figure 2 3. Effect of Structural Modification of Asiatic Acid on Pharmacological Effects Currently, the research on the biological functions of AA and its potential mechanism of action is quite extensive, but due to the drawbacks of its poor water solubility and low oral bioavailability, the potential impact of some of the efficacy of AA has been limited to a certain extent. In recent years, the enhancement of their pharmacological properties through structural modification strategies has become a hot research topic. As demonstrated in the relevant literature, the structural modifications of AA are primarily concentrated at positions C-2, C-3, C-11, C-23, and C-28 [ 4 5 99 100 5 3.1. Improvement of Anti-Tumor Effect Structural modifications significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity and selectivity of AA significantly enhanced by structural modifications. Mei [ 101 99 Figure 3 50 50 50 102 50 103 6 Some researchers have found [ 104 50 105 3 Figure 4 50 50 106 107 4 50 Studies have found that substitution at the C-28 position enhances the antitumor activity of AA and that different substitutions affect the mode of action to varying degrees [ 108 5 50 50 109 110 6 7 50 6 7 Figure 5 50 111 112 50 50 8 Figure 5 112 7 3.2. Improvement of Hypoglycemic Effect Glycogen phosphorylase (GP) is usually associated with the development of type II diabetes mellitus [ 113 114 115 C. asiatica 116 50 50 117 3.3. Improvement of Neuroprotective Effect In recent years, significant progress has been made in harnessing the neuroprotective effects of AA and its derivatives. It was shown [ 118 −1 −1 100 3.4. Other Effects Periodontitis is a chronic bacterial infection that can lead to tooth loss [ 119 120 9 Figure 5 121 Table 3 Compound 6 7 8 9 The structural modifications of AA are mainly concentrated at the C-2, C-3, C-23, and C-28 sites, among which C-2, C-3, and C-23 are mainly modified through acetylation, which primarily affects the water solubility and stability of the derivatives. Structural modifications at the C-28 position (such as esterification, rhodamine B coupling, amidation, or sulfonylation) play a key role in enhancing pharmacological activity. Additionally, the size of the compound group introduced at the C-28 position also affects the pharmacological activity of the derivative. Structural modification of AA precisely regulates the water solubility of the molecule, significantly enhancing its pharmacological activity and bioavailability. However, the modified derivatives still pose certain toxicity risks and synthetic complexity issues. In the future, combining novel drug delivery systems could overcome existing bottlenecks and promote the clinical translation of AA derivatives. 4. Toxicity Assessment of Asiatic Acid Preclinical safety and toxicology evaluation, as a critical initial step in the drug development process for new molecules, not only provides a scientific basis for the preliminary screening of candidate compounds but also establishes an essential foundation for their subsequent advancement to the clinical trial stage. Currently, toxicological studies on AA are limited, primarily focusing on C. asiatica C. asiatica C. asiatica −1 −1 −1 C. asiatica 122 50 C. asiatica −1 123 −1 124 C. asiatica −1 −1 −1 125 C. asiatica Salmonella C. asiatica C. asiatica 126 −1 C. asiatica 127 −1 −1 128 50 6 Numerous experiments have demonstrated that C. asiatica C. asiatica 5. Advances in Novel Delivery Systems for Asiatic Acid In vivo and in vitro experiments have revealed that AA has significant efficacy in anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotection, but its low water solubility, rapid degradation, short half-life, low bioavailability, and difficulty in crossing the blood–brain barrier have limited its oral absorption and clinical application [ 129 5.1. Nanoparticles Nanoparticles are characterized by small particle size (10–1000 nm) and large specific surface area, which can improve drug bioavailability by improving solubility, permeability and prolonging the release time of the drug as well as its retention time in the intestinal tract [ 130 131 132 Zhang’s team [ 133 8 134 50 −1 −1 50 −1 −1 3 3 50 50 12 The above studies showed that delivering AA with nanoparticles as a carrier can effectively prolong its release time and retention time in vivo, overcome its shortcomings such as fast elimination and short half-life in vivo, and significantly improve the bioavailability of AA and enhance its pharmacological effects, to better exert its therapeutic efficacy. 5.2. Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN) SLNs are a new type of carrier system used instead of traditional colloidal carriers, in which drugs are encapsulated in a layer of solid lipids stabilized by surface active molecules, often designed to carry poorly water-soluble drugs to improve their bioavailability, with low toxicity, high biocompatibility, high stability and high encapsulation rate [ 135 136 137 Islamie et al. [ 138 −1 −1 139 50 50 In summary, SLN formulations can prolong the in vivo release time of lipophilic drug AA and endow it with certain targeting properties, thus effectively exerting its effects such as neuroprotection and treatment of glioma. 5.3. Liposomes Dubey [ 9 −1 −1 max −1 max 0–t −1 max −1 max 0–t −1 5.4. Nanostructured Lipid Carriers (NLCs) NLCs have attracted widespread attention as the second generation of lipid nanoparticles developed from SLNs. NLCs can overcome the deficiencies of lipophilic drugs and improving the bioavailability of insoluble drugs by increasing drug solubility and permeability, decreasing metabolism as well as inhibiting the exocytosis of p-glycoprotein [ 140 Halder [ 141 −1 max 0–t −1 −1 11 max −1 0–24h max −1 0–24h −1 142 In summary, AA-NLC formulations can improve AA solubility, prolong in vivo retention time, increase bioavailability, and enhance its targeting, thus enhancing the therapeutic effects of AA on diseases. 5.5. Exosomes The antitumor effects of AA have been extensively documented. The utilization of novel materials, such as nanoparticles and liposomes, to deliver AA and enhance its antitumor activity has also been supported by experimental data. However, the application of these synthetic materials may still pose certain therapeutic risks and toxic effects [ 143 144 145 50 −1 −1 −1 −1 5.6. Gel Formulations Gels are semi-solid preparations consisting of a drug and one or more gelling agents (also known as gelling agents or thickeners). Among them, hydrogels are crosslinked polymer chains with 3D network structure composed of hydrophilic polymers, which are characterized by high water content, soft structure, high biocompatibility, degradability, and porousness [ 146 147 10 148 −2 −1 149 82 −1 150 2+ Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus 2+ Transfersomes are an advanced drug delivery system based on liposomes modified for the treatment of psoriasis, eczema, and other skin diseases. On this basis, Abdul et al. [ 151 skin max −2 0–8 −2 skin max −2 0–8 −2 152 w w ® ® −2 −1 −2 −1 153 −2 −1 −2 −1 It can be seen that gel preparations can significantly enhance the skin permeability of AA, which can significantly help to improve the efficacy of skin diseases. At the same time, some gel preparations can also enhance the antimicrobial activity of AA, reducing the risk of bacterial infection in wounds and indirectly helping wound healing. The novel drug delivery system exhibits promising application prospects by substantially enhancing the bioavailability of AA, imparting drug targeting capabilities, extending the duration of drug action, achieving sustained and controlled release, and improving the retention time of the drug within the body. This fundamentally overcomes the limitations imposed by the physicochemical properties of AA, thereby enhancing its therapeutic efficacy. However, most of the current novel drug delivery systems rely on conventional technologies, and there is a gap in research on emerging specific carriers such as exosomes [ 154 155 156 ® In order to systematically summarize the recent progress in AA formulation research, this paper reviews various types of new formulations, such as nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, liposomes, nanostructured lipid carriers, exosomes, and gels ( Figure 6 Table 4 6. Clinical Transformation and Challenges The clinical translation of AA has long been limited by its physicochemical properties and complex pharmacological profile. In recent years, with the research progress of Chinese medicine theory, the pharmacological effects of AA and its mechanisms are becoming increasingly clear, and the emergence of AA derivatives and new dosage forms has shown good results in improving AA bioavailability, overcoming the limitations of poor water solubility and low bioavailability of AA, and providing solid data support for its wide application in clinical practice. However, the clinical translation of AA continues to encounter certain challenges, such as toxicity concerns, scalability limitations, and variable pharmacokinetics. The low water solubility of AA leads to its low oral bioavailability, which requires structural modification or a novel delivery method to improve the efficacy, but the current toxicological evaluation of AA and its derivatives is not sufficient, and the safety of the new dosage form using polymer materials is still to be considered, which hinders progression to the clinical trial stage, so there is no clinical study to report the safety and toxicity of AA yet. Secondly, AA’s current novel formulations such as nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, and nanoliposomes are complex to prepare and have disadvantages including difficulty in scale-up, biocompatibility concerns, low drug loading, storage instability [ 157 158 130 ® 159 160 7.
