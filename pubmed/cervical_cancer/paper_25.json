Therefore, the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma needs agents to be very effective while protecting healthy cells. Blueberry extract, rich in micronutrients, flavonoids, and bioactive compounds, may inhibit cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis without harming normal cells. Objectives This study investigates the efficacy of blueberry extract in combination with radiotherapy as a radiosensitizer on Raji cells, a model for highly invasive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Methods First, Raji cells were treated with blueberry extract alone and in combination with a single dose of 2 Gy radiotherapy. The effects of blueberry extract on inhibiting proliferation and induction of apoptosis in Raji cells were investigated by MTT assay, flow cytometry (Annexin-V-FITC), cell cycle analysis, and quantitative gene expression analysis of BAX BCL-2 XPA Results Treated cells with blueberry extract alone and in combination with radiotherapy showed reduced viability, increased induction of apoptosis and a higher proportion of cells in the SUB-G1 cell cycle phase was detected. Additionally, gene expression analysis indicated upregulation of the pro-apoptotic gene BAX BCL-2 XPA Conclusion The study suggests that blueberry extract stimulates apoptosis in Raji cells and could serve as an anti-cancer drug. Furthermore, the combination of this extract with radiotherapy could be used as a radiosensitizer.

In 2020, it was the 11th most common cancer and contributed to 2.6% of all cancer-related mortality [ 1 2 2 5 6 6 7 8 Although radiosensitizers are under development, current results do not fully meet clinical requirements, and concerns remain regarding potential damage to normal cells following radiotherapy when applied systemically [ 8 9 8 Nowadays, there is a growing tendency to use herbal medicines to treat various diseases because they are safe, non-toxic, and easily accessible [ 8 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 16 19 BAX) 2) 20 8 17 21 22 In this study, the Raji cell lines, known for its highly invasive nature among non-Hodgkin lymphomas, were utilized to examine the combined effect of blueberry extract and radiotherapy on increasing cancer cell sensitivity to radiation and promoting apoptosis. This research aims to offer a novel perspective on the anticancer and radiosensitizing properties of blueberry extract on Burkitt lymphoma cells. Materials and methods Materials Penicillin/streptomycin was obtained from Gibco in the USA. DMSO and MTT powder were also purchased from Sigma (Germany). Additionally, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was acquired from Gibco in the USA. Trypan blue dye was acquired from Merck (Germany). Cell culture The Raji cell lines (ATCC ® 23 Experimental treatment An X-ray linear accelerator was used to perform experimental irradiation (IR) at room temperature with a dose rate of 2.0 Gy/min. Blueberry extract, a gift from Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Iran, was used in in vitro experiments to pretreat cultures one hour before irradiation [ 8 17 22 Cell viability assay The IC50 level and cell viability were assessed using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) test. Following treatment with blueberry extract and radiation, 104 cells were seeded in 100 µL of culture media per well and quadruplicated across 96-well plates. The culture media were aspirated and replaced with 5 mg/mL MTT solution after 24, 48, and 72 h of incubation. The MTT solution was carefully removed and replaced with DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Germany) after an additional 4 h of incubation. The absorbance was then measured at a wavelength of 570 nm.

Raji cells were first cultivated using a full culture medium in each well of a 12-well plate at a density of 1 × 10 5 5 24 Raji cells treated with radiation and blueberry extract were harvested at a density of 1 × 10 5 25 Analysis of gene expression First, the cells were irradiated with a single 2 Gy dose for 24 and 48 h after being exposed to different doses of blueberry extract (0,600,700 and 800 µg/mL). After harvesting the cells, total RNA was extracted using the manufacturer’s technique using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). Then, using 2 µg of total RNA from each sample, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized according to the directions on the cDNA synthesis kit (Add Bio, Korea). RealQ Plus 2x Master Mix Green with High ROX (Ampliqon, Denmark) was employed to measure the BCL-2 BAX XPA) The StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR Detection System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was employed to carry out the assays (primer sequences shown in Table 1 β-actin 17 26 Table 1 Primer sequences for RT-qPCR Target gene Primer sequences (5’→3’) Product size BAX GGTCTTTTTCCGAGTGGCAGC (F) TGATCAGTTCCGGCACCTTGG (R) 131 BCL-2 CCTGTGGATGACTGAGTACCTGA (F) ACTGAGCAGAGTCTTCAGAGACA (R 145 XPA AGCAAAGGAAGTCCGACAGG (F) CACACGCTGCTTCTTACTGCTC (R) 99 β-actin CTGACGGCCAGGTCATCAC (F) CTGACGGCCAGGTCATCAC (R) 174 Data analysis Three-way and two-way analyses of variance (ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s test were performed to evaluate the significant differences between groups using Graph Pad Prism software 9.1.0 (San Diego, CA, USA). The results of p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The results were represented as mean ± SD of at least 3 determinations. Results and discussion Synergistic effect of blueberry extract and radiotherapy on the survival of Raji cells The MTT assay was utilized in this study to investigate the effects of combining blueberry extract with a single dose of 2 Gy radiation for 24, 48, and 72 h on the survival of Raji cells. Figure 1 Fig. 1 IC50 graphs (mean ± SE) for Raji cells treated with blueberry extract alone and in combination with radiotherapy.

The 72-hour time point was excluded because the MTT results showed that the IC50 obtained with radiotherapy was lower compared to treatment with the extract alone. Annexin-V-FITC flow cytometry was utilized to demonstrate that this extract induces apoptosis of Raji cancer cells both alone and in combination with radiotherapy. In comparison to the control group, the results demonstrated that all groups of Raji cells treated with various amounts of blueberry extract induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner during a period of 24 and 48 h ( P Additionally, the combined treatment (blueberry extract and radiotherapy) increased the apoptosis percentage in different groups compared to control cells. The rate improved significantly in cells treated with 800 µg/ml of BE and radiotherapy; after 48 h, it rose from 46.42% in control cells (only exposed to radiation) to 81.12% in the BE and radiotherapy-treated cells. This increase in apoptosis in cells treated with BE concurrently with RT, compared to cells that received only a 2 Gy dose of radiotherapy, demonstrates the radiosensitizer effect of this extract ( P 3 Fig. 3 Influence of blueberry extract on apoptosis induction in Raji cells with ( B D A C E P P P P P P P P P P P P n Blueberry extract and its components have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and apoptosis-inducing effects on cancer cells [ 15 25 27 25 15 17 Enhanced Sub-G1 Cell Population Arrest in Raji Cells in Response to Blueberry Extract with or without Radiotherapy Similar to the apoptotic stage, Raji cells were treated with BE at 600, 700, and 800 µg/ml concentrations for 24 and 48 h, with and without radiation therapy.

However, a number of cancer types are resistant to radiation due to factors like highly specialized DNA damage response mechanisms that allow for prompt damage detection and eventual repair. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of these pathways is required to overcome biological radioresistance [ 34 XPA XPB XPC XPD 35 36 XPA XPA XPA 37 38 XPA XPA XPA 26 XPA 37 39 XPA XPA/BAX BAX BCL-2 Conclusion In conclusion, both blueberry extract alone and in combination with radiotherapy showed an ability to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro. This is evidenced by its capacity to increase pro-apoptotic gene expression and reduce anti-apoptotic gene expression. These results emphasize the potential of plant compounds as effective agents for suppressing cancer cell growth and improving the radiosensitivity of cancer cells. This research revealed that the blueberry extract not only acts as a cancer cell growth inhibitor but also acts as a radiosensitizer in conjunction with radiotherapy, particularly in the context of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cells.
