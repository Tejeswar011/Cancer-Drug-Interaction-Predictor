The drug combination approach was performed using a combination index (CI), the Chou-Talalay method. The HeLa cells show the highest level of hTERT among the studied cell lines, and the second level was noted in the MCF-7 cells. Almost all used combinations in this line revealed a synergistic effect, with the lowest CI for BIBR1532 and cisplatin. Interestingly, the highest synergistic effect, compared to other combinations, was shown by BIBR1532 and doxorubicin in U118 MG cells. Additionally, the highest effect of TMPyP4, compared to all combinations, was noted in conjunction with cisplatin in HeLa cells. The most impactful results were achieved by combining inhibitors with drugs that interact directly with DNA strands. Moreover, the different hTERT levels influence the response to treatments. This underscores the need for in vitro optimization to maximize the synergistic interaction of compounds. Combining genome-based medicine and drug screening using personalized models may fulfill the promise of precision medicine for every cancer type.

According to the latest GLOBOCAN (Global Cancer Statistics), an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases and nearly 10.0 million deaths occurred worldwide in 2020 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 15 13 14 15 Telomerase targeting-based strategy The basic idea of the anticancer strategy is to use the most efficient and specific way to eliminate cancer cells. Consequently, targeting telomerase, supported by a combination with anticancer drugs, seems to provide a promising solution. This approach leads to disrupting telomere restoration and, thus, destabilization of the genome and induced susceptibility of cancer cells to a chemotherapeutic agent. Consequently, the drug concentrations used in therapy could be lower and, simultaneously, would show reduced adverse side effects with high efficacy. TMPyP4 and BIBR1532 are the compounds that show high potential in telomerase-targeting 16 1 17 18 16 19 20 21 22 19 Fig. 1 Chemical structure depiction of A B C D E https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov BIBR1532 is a non-nucleoside, non-peptide telomerase inhibitor (Fig. 1 23 24 25 27 Anticancer drugs Several types of chemotherapy drugs target different types of cancer 28 29 1 30 31 32 30 33 34 35 36 Furthermore, one of the most efficient chemotherapy medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is doxorubicin (DOX). It is used to treat several cancer types, including breast, lung, gastric, ovarian, thyroid, non-Hodgkin’s, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, sarcoma, and pediatric cancers. DOX is an anthracycline extracted from Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius 1 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 Another type of anticancer compound is paclitaxel (PACL), a diterpenoid pseudoalkaloid composed of two molecules: a taxane ring with a four-membered oxetane side ring at the C4 and C5 positions and a homochiral ester side chain at the C13 position (Fig. 1 45 46 47 48 49 50 53 54 55 56 Polytherapy with telomerase inhibitors Most mechanisms of action of the chemotherapeutic drugs are not selective to cancer, consequently affecting normal cells. Telomerase has emerged as a unique molecular target for cancer treatment. A substantial disadvantage is the time delay observed in telomere attrition. Therefore, telomerase inhibitors are not likely to be used in monotherapy as the first-line treatment. The standard chemotherapies are usually associated with tumor recurrences related to cancer heterogeneity and acquired resistance. This urgent need to develop novel approaches to fight resistant types can be fulfilled by multidrug combination treatment. In this setting, the telomerase inhibitors might prevent the regrowth of residual cancer cells. Accordingly, we used telomerase inhibitors TI (TMPyP4 and BIBR1532) in combination with three commonly used anticancer drugs (CIS, DOX, and PACL). The study’s main aim was to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy approach based on a combination of TI and anticancer drugs and investigate the in vitro pharmacodynamic interactions of those combinations in a broad range of human cancer cell lines. Materials and methods Cell culture This study used ten human cancer cell lines and one non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cell line. All cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA). The breast adenocarcinoma cell lines MCF-7 (ATCC® HTB-22™) and MDA-MB-231 (ATCC® HTB-26™) were maintained as a monolayer in a complete growing medium RPMI-1640 (Biowest, France), supplemented with 10% (v/v) of fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). The breast cancer cell line SK-BR-3 (ATCC® HTB-30™) and ovarian cancer cell line SK-OV-3 (ATCC® HTB-77™) were cultured in McCoy’s 5 A medium (Biowest, USA) with 10% (v/v) FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) addition. The human cervical carcinoma HeLa (ATCC® CCL-2TM) and the breast cancer cell line T-47D (ATCC® HTB-133™) were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% (v/v) FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) addition. The glioblastoma cell lines U-118 MG (ATCC® HTB-15™) and U-138 MG (ATCC® HTB-16™) were cultured in DMEM and Eagle`s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) with 10% (v/v) FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), respectively. The colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 (ATCC® HTB-37™) was maintained in EMEM (ATCC®, USA) with 1% (v/v) non-essential amino acids (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and 10% (v/v) FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) addition. The ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3 (ATCC® HTB-161™) was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Biowest, France) supplemented with insulin (10 µg/mL) and 20% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). The non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line MCF-12A (ATCC® CRL-10782™) was maintained in DMEM-F12 medium (Biowest, USA) supplemented with hydrocortisone (0.5 µg/mL), insulin (10.0 µg/mL), human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) (20.0 ng/mL), cholera toxin (0.1 µg/mL), and 5% (v/v) horse serum (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). All cell lines were grown to a confluence of 80% in 100 × 15 mm Falcon® Petri dishes (Corning, Poland) at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) of CO 2 Immunodetection The MCF-7, T-47D, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231, MCF-12A, Caco-2, OVCAR-3, SK-OV-3, U-118 MG, U-138 MG, and HeLa cells were seeded at a density of 7,5 × 10 5 12 https://www.uvp.com/products/bioimaging-systems/uvp-gel-compact/ Study compounds TMPyP4, 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(1-methylpyridinium-4-yl)porphyrin tetra(p-toluenesulfonate) was purchased from Abcam Biochemicals (Cambridge, UK). Doxorubicin hydrochloride, paclitaxel, and cisplatin were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, USA), and BIBR1532 from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, USA). All procedures and storage were performed with minimal exposure to light due to TMPyP4’s susceptibility to light. Cell viability assay The cytotoxicity of the studied compounds was assessed in six selected cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, HeLa, U-118 MG, OVCAR-3, MCF-12A) with a high level of hTERT (selection was based on WB results) using the MTT test. The assay was performed as previously described 16 3 https://www.microsoft.com/pl-pl/microsoft-365/excel Inhibitor-drug interaction Inhibitor-drug interaction was assessed in the mentioned cell lines using the MTT test. Briefly, 5 × 10 3 https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi Statistical analysis The obtained data were expressed as the mean ± SD of at least three experiments. Differences were assessed for statistical significance using repeated-measures ANOVA. All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism (version 10.2.1, GraphPad Software, USA; https://www.graphpad.com/ Results The evaluation of the constitutive level of the hTERT in a broad range of human cancer cell lines The first step of assessing the mode of action and efficacy of telomerase inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy drugs was establishing the constitutive level of the hTERT in the studied human cancer cell lines. As an experimental model, we used four breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T-47D, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231), two ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR-3, SK-OV-3), two glioblastoma cell lines (U-118 MG, U-138 MG), a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2), human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa), and non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cell line (MCF-12A), selected as the control to confirm the specificity of action. Based on Western blot analysis, we have chosen six cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, OVCAR-3, U-118 MG, HeLa, and MCF-12A) for further research (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Western blot analysis of the constitutive level of the hTERT in different human cancer cell lines. GAPDH was used as the loading standard (only one representative blot for each is shown) ( A B The assessment of the cytotoxic effect of studied drugs in six cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, OVCAR-3, U-118 MG, HeLa, and MCF-12A) with MTT assay The cytotoxic effect of two telomerase inhibitors, TMPyP4, BIBR1532, and three chemotherapeutic drugs, doxorubicin hydrochloride, cisplatin, and paclitaxel, was assessed after 24 h of treatment using an MTT assay. DOX was used in the 0.05–5 µM concentration range. The value of IC50 (the half-maximal inhibitory concentration) was reached only by HeLa cell lines, and it was 1 µM (Table 1 3 Table 1 In vitro cytotoxic activity (IC50) of doxorubicin or cisplatin after 24 h treatment.

The IC 50 value was estimated for OVCAR-3 (33.7 µM) and HeLa (31.9 µM) cell lines (Table 1 3 PACL was used in the 0.1–20 µM concentration range. The highest concentration used significantly reduced the viability of MCF-7 cells, causing a decrease of over 40% (Fig. 3 The cationic porphyrin TMPyP4, a G-quadruplex structure stabilizer, was used in the 1–50 µM concentration range. No significant effect on the viability of the tested cell lines was noted (Fig. 3 BIBR1532, a non-competitive telomerase inhibitor, was used in the 0.1–50 µM concentration range. Both breast cancer cell lines responded with a 10% decrease in cell viability throughout the concentration selection (Fig. 3 1 Investigating the efficacy of combination treatment and the sensitizing effects of telomerase inhibitors TMPyP4 and BIBR1532 on DOX, CIS, or PACL To investigate the in vitro pharmacodynamic interactions of combining telomere inhibitors TMPyP4 and BIBR1532 with DOX, CIS, and PACL, we used the Chou-Talalay method. This method for drug combination is based on the median-effect equation, which provides the theoretical basis for the combination index (CI) equation 57 58 The first part of the experiment was the 48 h incubation with a 20 µM concentration of the chosen telomerase inhibitor (TMPyP4 or BIBR1532). This step aimed to sensitize the cells to the chemotherapy drugs used in the following stage. The second part was a 24 h treatment with two concentrations of tested compounds: DOX (1 or 5 µM), CIS (10 or 20 µM), and PACL (5 or 10 µM). The concentration for TMPyP4 has been chosen based on our previous experiments showing that 20 µM TMPyP4 significantly diminished telomerase activity and expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-321 cell lines 16 27 Combination of TMPyP4 (20 µM) with DOX revealed the highest synergistic effect in MDA-MB-231 cells, with CI 0.44 (for combination with 1 µM DOX; p < 0.01) and 0.39 (for combination with 5 µM DOX; p < 0.01) (Fig. 4 2 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 4 2 2 4 4 4 4 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 Fig. 4 Dose–response matrices of proliferation inhibition after 48 h pre-treatment with TMPyP4 (20 µM) or BIBR1532 (20 µM), followed by 24 h combination treatment with TI and CIS (10 µM and 20 µM), DOX (1 µM and 5 µM), and PACL (5 µM and 10 µM), and single drug treatments in A B C D E F Table 2 Combination index (CI) and dose reduction index (DRI) after 48 h pre-treatment with TMPyP4 (20 µM) or BIBR1532 (20 µM) and 24 h combination treatment with TI and CIS (10 µM and 20 µM), DOX (1 µM and 5 µM), and PACL (5 µM and 10 µM) in HeLa, MCF-7, MCF-12A, MDA-MB-231, OVCAR-3, and U-118 MG cells.

Molecular specific, aka tumor-agnostic therapies, target specific genomic anomalies or molecular features regardless of histological origin. In this case, cancer therapies are approved for biomarkers rather than cancer types. Since most cancers result from the accumulation of multiple mutations, combination therapies are a more common approach than those based on single drug. They may consist of chemotherapy and immunotherapy, chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy, or immunotherapy plus targeted therapy, as well as a combination of two chemotherapeutic agents. The main goal of these configurations is to increase the efficacy of compounds, limit negative side effects (due to lower drug concentration applied), and prevent or overcome the development of resistance. However, the benefits gained from a drug combination approach, if not based on the presence of a specific genetic alteration, may not reveal synergistic effects. This can mean a\"loss of precision\"and, consequently, over-treatment of certain subgroups of patients. Oncology has changed dramatically with the advent of precision medicine, guided by the discovery of “treatable” gene mutations or immune targets assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) 59 60 62 12 16 63 64 66 A growing number of epidemiological and tumor genomic studies have identified an important role for telomere maintenance in cancer susceptibility, initiation, and prognosis. Telomere length has long been studied in relation to malignancies. Significantly, the relationship between telomere length and increased cancer risk varies in different types of tumors. Restoration of telomerase activity in cancer cells is essential for telomere maintenance and underlies the ability to divide continuously. Interestingly, telomere length in cancer cells is often shorter than in normal cells, most likely because cells divide rapidly at an early stage of tumor development, before telomerase expression and activity are restored 67 68 69 73 73 The most significant effect and the lowest IC compared to all combinations were noted for BIBR 1532 and DOX in U118 MG cells. BIBR1532 binds to hTERT at the non-catalytic site and inhibits telomerase activity in a non-competitive manner 74 75 76 27 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 On the other hand, we discovered that the highest synergistic effect of TMPyP4 was noted in HeLa cells in conjunction with CIS. This cervical cancer cell line shows the highest level of protein subunit hTERT among the ones studied in our project (Fig. 2 86 87 16 88 89 90 The results indicate that the different landscapes of tumor types may directly influence the response type in various combination treatments. This demonstrates the need for in vitro optimization to maximize drug cytotoxicity and synergistic compound interactions. Due to genome-based and individualized model-based drug screening, many common cancers will receive precision treatment options. A promising method to start personalized treatment is the use of liquid biopsy in the diagnostic process. Strategies include detecting and monitoring of circulating tumor cells, cell-free DNA, and extracellular vesicles. Liquid biopsy allows minimally invasive molecular characterization of tumors, patient stratification to therapy, and treatment effectiveness monitoring 91 92 93 Supplementary Information  Supplementary Information.
