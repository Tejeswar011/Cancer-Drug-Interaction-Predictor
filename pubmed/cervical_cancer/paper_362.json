We seek to highlight innovative diagnostic approaches, novel treatment modalities such as targeted agents and immunotherapies, key molecular pathways, and novel biomarkers. Through this work, we hope to improve patient stratification, enable earlier detection, and improve outcomes for the millions of patients worldwide fighting for survival against HNSCCs. Here, we present a multidisciplinary collection of 16 articles aimed at addressing various aspects of head and neck cancers. From biological mechanisms to innovative diagnostics, novel therapeutics, computational models, and rare clinical presentations, we hope to fully capture the mechanisms driving head and neck cancer behavior and the tools we have available to address it. We hope that this multifaceted collection will inspire further research and emphasize the importance of all disciplines of oncology, from the scientist's bench to the patient's bedside. Through collaboration, innovation, and inspiration, we hope that this Special Issue will further support scientific efforts to save lives and ease the suffering of patients with this persistent and destructive disease. Several original research articles in this collection focus on tumor biology and cellular behavior. Notably, Brach et al. ex vivo Warner et al. high high in vitro in vivo low low Khromov et al. Among the collection, several studies have focused on improving treatment selection and tailoring strategies for HNSCC. For example, Lee et al. Li et al. Lv et al. Wang and Wang Among the collection, there is a total of two comprehensive review articles that focus on tumor resistance and therapeutic response. Qin et al. de Lima-Souza et al. The collection from this special issue also consists of several studies that employed different approaches to improve precision diagnostics and prognostic modeling for head and neck cancer. For HNSCC, Li et al. Li et al. Gao et al. In this special issue, we also received four case reports that provided unique clinical insights that related to head and neck cancer. For instance, Yin and Gui Zhan and Sun Wu et al. Liu et al. . Together, these 16 contributions provide a panoramic view of current efforts to decode the biology and improve the clinical management of oral and head and neck cancers. From cutting-edge computational models to in-depth molecular analyses and rare clinical presentations, this collection underscores the importance of integrating basic, translational, and clinical research. We hope this Topic inspires further investigation, collaboration, and innovation in the fight against these complex diseases. We offer our sincerest thanks to all our authors, contributors, and reviewers for their hard work, time, and dedication to this special issue. Edited and Reviewed by: Ricardo D.
