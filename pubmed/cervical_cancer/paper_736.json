Introduction Spinal fusion is becoming an increasingly common operation to treat debilitating degenerative, infectious, neoplastic, and traumatic diseases of the spine [ 1 2 1 3 Several methodologies have been investigated to improve spinal fusion rates, including novel bone grafts composed of small molecules, biomaterials, and biologics such as recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). Historically, autologous iliac crest bone graft has been chosen for patients undergoing spinal fusion due to its cellular osteogenic and native osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties [ 4 5 ® 6 5 7 8 9 Metals have shown promise as osteoinductive and osteoconductive agents that stimulate bone formation with several biomimetic properties that mimic native human bone. Several trace metals are naturally incorporated into physiologic bone formation, such as sodium, magnesium, zinc, silicon, and strontium, and the similar electronegative properties of these metals may serve as an acceptable substitute in the osteogenic process for calcium [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 In spinal fusion procedures, metals, particularly titanium, are often used as interbody implants for their osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties. Porous tantalum has been investigated as a bone graft substitute due to its similar mechanical properties to cancellous bone. A systematic review by Hanc et al. (2015) observed low rates of implant failure and heterogeneous rates of fusion in clinical studies with this material [ 17 18 19 This systematic review seeks to investigate metals as potential synergistic biomaterials in composite bone grafts to induce osteogenesis in preclinical animal models of spinal fusion. We hypothesize that incorporation of metals into bone graft substitutes will promote greater fusion rates and bone quality both with and without the presence of auxiliary agents such as rhBMP-2 or autologous bone graft. We will also investigate adverse effects and toxicities associated with relevant metals incorporated in the investigated bone grafts. 2. Literature Review 2.1. Study Design and Search Strategy A systematic review of PubMed/MEDLINE was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) ( Figure 1 20 Appendix A 2.2. Eligibility Criteria Screened articles were included based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) basic science studies, (2) studies with an animal model of spinal fusion, and (3) studies investigating metal additives to bone graft material to promote spinal fusion. Studies were excluded based on the following exclusion criteria: (1) non-English studies, (2) abstracts and unpublished studies, (3) clinical studies, (4) reviews, (5) articles investigating non-spinal bone fusion, (6) articles investigating metal cages or meshes in the absence of bone grafts, (7) articles investigating bone grafts composed of solely ceramic and/or organic biomaterials, (8) animal models investigating adjunct medical pathologies in addition to spinal fusion, and (9) studies published before the year 2000. 2.3. Selection Process and Screening Search query and subsequent deduplication were performed by C.R. Articles were then independently screened by authors (C.R. and M.S.) for basic science studies investigating metal composite bone grafts in animal models of spinal fusion based on our aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Bibliographies of included articles were also screened for relevant articles. Screening was confirmed by one additional reviewer (N.S.). 2.4. Data Extraction and Data Outcomes Study design characteristics such as the animal model, bone graft materials, spine segment operated on, surgery type, and length of study were recorded for all included articles. Primary outcomes evaluated included fusion rate of experimental animals, bone volume percentage (BV%) of masses, and histologic analysis of fusion masses. In studies where multiple follow-up points were described, data points were taken from the latest postoperative follow-up. Successful fusion was defined by data extractors as continuous bridging of bone from caudal to cephalad ends of adjacent transverse processes (TPs). Secondary outcomes investigated included surgical adverse events and mortality, implant toxicity, and implant corrosion. Data that was only reported graphically was extracted using webplotdigitizer version 5.0 ( https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/ 2.5. Risk of Bias Assessment Risk of bias assessment was carried out independently by two reviewers (M.S. and V.H.) using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) Risk of Bias Tool [ 21 2.6. Statistical Analysis All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 10 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). Fisher’s exact testing was performed for comparison of fusion rates and adverse events across bone graft materials. Bone volume percentages of fusion masses were not compared across studies, and all comparisons reported for this outcome are extracted from comparisons already performed within each independent included study. Further, to assess the sensitivity and heterogeneity of our results, subgroup analysis regarding metal-only and metal bone grafts with additives was performed with respect to controls in the included studies. These subgroups were also further stratified to compare specific metals with adjunctive bioactive agents and specific metals without adjunctive bioactive agents. Studies lacking one or more investigated outcomes were excluded from all statistics involving that outcome. A p ® 3. Results 3.1. Baseline Characteristics of Included Studies After screening a total of 1554 articles, 15 articles were included in our review, comprising 507 total experimental animals. One study was published in two parts as two separate articles [ 22 23 23 Table 1 SYRCLE risk of bias assessment was performed on all included studies and is outlined in Table 2 3.2. Arthrodesis Rates Overall fusion rate for all animals among included studies was 82% or 268 of 326 animals that had fusion rate reported as an outcome. Fusion rate among animals treated with metal composite only bone grafts was 62%. Metal composite bone grafts with adjunct bioactive agents had a significantly greater fusion rate compared to metal composite grafts alone at 88% ( p p p Comparing specific metals in the investigated composite bone grafts, strontium bone grafts had the highest overall fusion rate at 100% (18/18 animals), compared to 89% (95/107 animals) with magnesium composite grafts, 76% (26/34 animals) with titanium composite grafts, 72% (21/29 animals) with silicon composite grafts, and 12.5% (⅛ animals) with tantalum composite grafts. Comparisons of fusion rates between metals showed significant differences between magnesium-containing grafts and silicon-containing grafts ( p p p p p p p 23 Among metal composite bone grafts that did not receive any adjunctive bioactive agents, strontium bone grafts had the highest fusion rate at 100% (18/18) animals compared to 85.7% (12/14) animals in titanium bone grafts, 37.5% (3/8 animals) in silicon bone grafts, 12.5% (1/8 animals) in magnesium bone grafts, and 0% (0/4 animals) in tantalum bone grafts Statistical comparison between metals in this group revealed significantly higher fusion rates with strontium compared to magnesium ( p p p p p Among metal composite bone grafts with adjunctive bioactive agents, magnesium bone grafts had the highest fusion rate at 94.9% (94/99 animals), followed by silicon bone grafts at 85.7% (18/21 animals), titanium bone grafts at 70% (14/20 animals), and tantalum bone grafts at 25% (1/4 animals). Magnesium-containing bone grafts with adjunctive bioactive agents also had significantly higher fusion rates than both titanium bone grafts with adjunctive bioactive agents ( p p p 3.3. Bone Quality of Formed Bone Masses BV%s were reported as outcomes in 9/15 of the included articles, and BV%s for titanium, magnesium, strontium, and silicon bone grafts with their comparator grafts are described in Figure 2 24 p 22 p 26 The effect of magnesium on the bone quality of fusion masses, denoted by BV%, was varied among the included studies. Investigation of a MgHA composite bone graft by Brodano et al. (2014) in a sheep model of PLF at 24 weeks follow-up demonstrated a BV% of 53.1 ± 5.6% that was lowered to 44.3 ± 3.3% when DBM was added to the graft, significantly lower than the 55.9 ± 4.7 BV% achieved by autograft in the same model ( p 28 35 BV% was reported as an outcome in two studies investigating strontium-containing bone grafts. A rat model of PLF by Salamanna et al. (2019) observed an average BV% of 37.8 (IQR: 36.4–39.0) and 37.8 (IQR: 35.4–40.2) for 5% SrHA and 10% SrHA, respectively, achieving similar BV%s to HA alone (38.3%) and HA treated with 7 mM (36.1%) and 28 mM (34.3%) alendronate [ 30 29 Lastly, silicon-containing composite bone grafts and their effect on BV% were described in two rabbit models of PLF, one by Cui et al. (2021) and one by Conway et al. (2021) [ 33 34 33 p p p p 34 Histologic analysis of fusion masses was performed in all of the included articles. Metal composite bone grafts were noted to stimulate deposition of osteoid on decorticated TPs in 12/15 included studies. Forms of bone identified noted on histology of fusion masses in these studies were mature cancellous and cortical bone in nine studies [ 23 26 28 29 30 32 33 34 31 25 24 25 26 29 33 24 25 25 34 35 25 3.4. Adverse Events and Toxicity A total of 15 adverse events were reported in 507 animal surgeries performed in our included studies. The adverse events occurred in the goat model by Sidhu et al. (2021) [ 24 25 23 32 33 23 27 36 23 27 28 36 4. Discussion To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic review investigating metal composite bone grafts in animal models of spinal fusion. We observed that metal composite bone grafts with auxiliary bioactive agents fused at similar rates compared to comparator bone grafts and significantly greater rates compared to bone grafts composed of metal composites alone. Bone grafts composed of strontium or magnesium were the most promising in promoting arthrodesis compared to the other investigated metals. Further, subgroup analysis also revealed that strontium-containing bone grafts achieved the highest arthrodesis rates among metal bone grafts that did not have adjunctive agents, and magnesium-containing bone grafts achieved the highest arthrodesis rates among metal bone grafts that did have adjunctive agents. Further, the addition of the investigated bioactive agents to most of the metal composite bone grafts described in our included studies was correlated with a significantly greater proportional growth of bone tissue compared to bone tissue formed by comparator or metal composite only bone grafts. Therefore, preclinical literature of spinal fusion molecules suggests promising evidence for metal composites as osteoinductive supplements to novel bone graft designs. 4.1. Strontium as Novel Osteoinductive Biomaterial The biological basis for the induction of bone formation with strontium is primarily through a dual mechanism of stimulating osteoblasts and inhibiting osteoclast-mediated bone resorption through the RANKL, osteoprotegrin, and calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) pathways [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 37 43 44 45 In vivo preclinical models of bone healing and formation have also used strontium in a variety of biomaterials to stimulate osteogenesis. Strontium-infused bioactive glasses have shown promise in promoting bone formation in various bone defect models. In these materials, strontium likely has a synergistic effect with the other osteoinductive metals present in the glass to reduce proinflammatory signaling while enhancing the material’s biomimetic compatibility [ 46 47 48 49 37 50 51 Strontium has also been used in several clinical applications to improve bone health. Strontium ranelate has been in clinical use since the early 2000 s for the treatment of osteoporosis and is thought to improve bone quality in osteoporosis. A ten-year longitudinal study described by Reginster et al. (2012) observed a sustained antifracture effect with preserved bone mineral density in osteoporotic patients taking strontium ranelate [ 52 53 54 4.2. The Role of Magnesium in Enhancing Osteogenesis in Bone Tissue Engineering Magnesium has also been implicated in several biologic pathways as a regulator of osteogenesis. In undifferentiated BMSCs, magnesium has been shown to enhance vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression through intracellular HIF-2α signaling to improve vascularization of new bone, and in osteoblastic BMSC precursors, VEGF expression is enhanced with simultaneous magnesium-induced expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC)-1α, a coactivator of VEGF transcription [ 55 56 57 58 59 Previous literature provides extensive in vivo and in vitro evidence supporting the osteogenic capabilities of magnesium as an adjunctive metal added to novel bone graft materials. A study investigating the role of nanomaterials in osteoblast maturation confirmed the promise of utilizing magnesium nanoparticles to promote bone regeneration, evidenced by their ability to enhance osteogenic differentiation through inflammatory response modulation to improve alkaline phosphatase activity, bone volume, and mineral density [ 60 61 35 62 62 63 64 4.3. Synergistic and Biomimetic Mechanisms of Metal-Induced Osteogenesis The bioactive agents discussed in this review have also been observed to synergistically act with metals to promote bone formation in non-spinal fusion preclinical studies. A potential weakness of metal-composite bone grafts is the absence of live, cellular osteogenic material or natural biomolecular osteoinductive components. Therefore, the addition of bioactive materials such as rhBMP-2, biopolymers, or stem cells may improve bone formation and quality achieved with novel metal-composite bone grafts as seen in this study. rhBMP-2 is currently the gold standard for clinically approved osteoinductive growth factors promoting spinal fusion and has exhibited significant efficacy in forming bone in several preclinical and large clinical studies [ 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 62 PLGA has also been shown in several in vivo and in vitro studies to improve the effective bioavailability of metal composite biomaterials through an increased resistance to corrosion, improved biocompatibility, and a controlled release profile of the encapsulated metal [ 72 73 74 75 76 The investigation into novel delivery methods of stem cells or donor iliac crest bone graft with metals may further enhance bone formation with metal bone grafts, due to their acellular content. Several metals, such as strontium, magnesium, copper, titanium, silver, and chromium, have shown good biocompatibility with mesenchymal stem cells while helping facilitate osteogenic differentiation of these cells, similar to the histologic findings observed in this review [ 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 Several other reviews have also examined the osteoinductive capabilities of metals outside of spinal fusion. A review by Li et al. (2021) [ 86 87 87 4.4. Limitations Although this systematic review was able to comprehensively evaluate metal composite bone grafts in preclinical models of spinal fusion, there are several inherent limitations present due to the nature of the animal models investigated and the translatability of the metal composite bone grafts and their materials. The study designs of the included articles introduced some inherent selection and performance bias due to the knowledge investigators had of the bone graft and surgical procedure each animal was receiving. However, this limitation is likely inherent to the different physical appearances of metal composite graft materials and the subject matter of the animal models investigated in this study. The designs of the spinal fusion models investigated in this study were also heterogeneous concerning the animal studied and the spinal level operated on, in addition to the various bone grafts described. Therefore, evaluation of the bone grafts was limited to the radiographic fusion rate on microCT and histologic bone quality rather than any motor, neurologic, or biomechanical benefits of the fusion due to the limited translatability of these parameters across animal studies or to humans. Further, to maximize the external validity of each study in our analysis, data from comparator groups were also extracted to demonstrate intra-model effectiveness of each graft relative to comparator grafts. Comparisons of bone quality between different metals were also not performed in any included study from the literature; therefore, it is difficult to extrapolate the relative osteoinductivity of the investigated metals to each other, rather than presenting the absolute effectiveness of each graft demonstrated by individual studies. Finally, variation in follow-up existed in our studies even after excluding a 52-week outlier. While this variation in follow-up could be a potential confounder for arthrodesis rates given that a longer follow-up could select for higher fusion rates, a follow-up timeline of 6 to 26 weeks is consistent with clinical follow-up in human patients. Further, the timeline for spinal fusion in animals is variable depending on the graft and animal, with most small animal models requiring 6–8 weeks for fusion, while larger animal models have reported up to twenty weeks for successful fusion with significant variability between studies [ 88 89 90 Future studies may seek to evaluate the osteoinductivity of different metals in a single model of spinal fusion or evaluate various bioactive agents in a single metal composite in a single model of spinal fusion. Further, these studies could be supplemented with in vitro data that propose a specific mechanism for the investigated graft beyond prior established mechanisms of osteoinductivity of the graft’s components. 5. Conclusions Metals show promise as osteoinductive and osteoconductive agents to stimulate spinal fusion as independent graft materials and additives to novel osteoinductive biomaterials. In particular, metal composite bone grafts combined with supplementary bioactive agents such as BMSCs or autograft have been shown to act synergistically to significantly improve fusion rates and bone quality compared to grafts composed of metals, autograft, or ceramics alone. Without adjunctive agents, strontium-containing bone grafts showed promise as independent osteoconductive materials, while magnesium-containing bone grafts had promising arthrodesis rates when combined with novel osteoinductive agents. The evidence for metal-related local or systemic toxicity or adverse events is limited in the literature describing metals incorporated in spinal fusion models. Future preclinical studies may serve to optimize specific metals or bioactive factors based on established osteoinductive mechanisms of action to maximize the arthrodesis rate achieved by these materials.
