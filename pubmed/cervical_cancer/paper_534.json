Highlights • Novel regulatory axis discovered: Dioscin suppresses bladder cancer progression by activating miR-195–5p to inhibit the FASN/SLC3A2 signaling axis. • Dual therapeutic/toxicity effects: While dioscin inhibits bladder cancer cell proliferation/migration in vitro in vivo • Multimodal cell death induction: Dioscin triggers apoptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis in bladder cancer cells, with gap junction communication being critical for its cytotoxic effects. • Critical safety concerns: Demonstrated cytotoxicity against normal urothelial (SV-HUC-1) and renal (MDCK) cells, alongside exacerbated bladder stone formation and elevated creatinine/uric acid levels in combined therapy. • Translational implication: The discovery of dosage-dependent duality in dioscin’s antitumor activity, urging mechanism-guided optimization to balance therapeutic potency and off-target organ damage. Emerging evidence highlights dioscin, a bioactive compound derived from Dioscoreaceae plants, as a promising antitumor agent, yet its regulatory mechanisms in bladder cancer and interaction with microRNAs remain unclear.

Background Bladder cancer is one of the most common urinary system tumors, characterized by high mortality and morbidity [ 9 8 16 22 33 27 19 17 26 2 Compounds that significantly upregulate miR-195 levels may be crucial for bladder cancer intervention. Consequently, we screened related compounds and found that dioscin and simvastatin significantly upregulate miR-195–5p expression. Dioscin induces demethylation of DAPK-1 and RASSF-1α genes via its antioxidant capacity, leading to apoptosis or inhibited cell viability in bladder cancer T24 cells [ 35 25 13 Cisplatin-based platinum-based chemotherapy remains the first-line treatment for advanced bladder cancer [ 30 11 Materials and methods Cell lines The study utilized the following cell lines from Shanghai Fuheng Biological Cell Bank: human bladder transitional cell carcinomas (5637, T24, EJ), canine renal epithelial cells (MDCK), and immortalized human ureteral epithelial cells (SV-HUC-1). BIU87 and BIU87-DDP cell lines were provided by Prof. Leli Zeng at The Seventh Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. All cell lines were maintained at passage numbers below 20 to preserve phenotypic stability and minimize genetic drift. Main reagents DMEM High Glucose Medium and South American fetal bovine serum (GIBCO); Penicillin-Streptomycin (10,000 U/mL) (GIBCO); Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific); miR-195–5p mimic, miR-195–5p negative control (NC), miR-195–5p inhibitor, and FASN siRNA (Guangzhou Ruibo Biology Co., Ltd.); MTS (a tetrazolium salt compound) Cell Proliferation and Toxicity Detection Kit (Shanghai Beibo Co., LTD); Cytotoxicity Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay Kit (DOJINDO); Matrigel (BD); Dioscin (Shanghai yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd; purity≥98 %); Cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich, purity≥98 %); Deferoxamine (MCE, purity≥99.7 %); Ferrostatin-1 (Shanghai yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd; purity≥98 %); N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (Beijing Solarbio Technology Co., LTD; purity≥99 %), Necrostatin-1 (Shanghai yuanye Bio-Technology Co., Ltd; purity≥99 %); Carbenoxolone disodium salt (Sigma-Aldrich, purity≥98 %). The quantitative reverse transcription kit containing gDNA (Takara) and TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Takara) were used for reverse transcription and PCR amplification, respectively. BCA Protein Concentration Determination Kit (Solarbio Co., LTD); Western blot antibodies included the anti-FASN (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:1000), anti-SLC3A2 (Cell Signaling Technology; 1:2000), and anti-GAPDH (Beyotime biotechnology AF1186; 1:1000). Cell transfection experiment Bladder cancer cells (T24, EJ, 5637) were cultured in RMPI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and cultured in a 37 °C, 5 % CO 2 RNA extraction and real-time PCR Using Hipure Total RNA Kits (Magen), we extracted total RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. After quantifying RNA concentration, reverse transcription was performed under the following conditions: 37 °C for 15 min, 85 °C for 5 s, followed by 4 °C hold. We prepared reaction mixtures on ice using TB Green® Premix Ex Taq™ II (TaKaRa) and cDNA templates. The Roche LightCycler 480 system quantified target gene expression levels with U6 as internal controls for miR-195–5p Relative expression was calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt Western blot After removing culture medium, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 80 μL RIPA buffer. Following scraping and sonication, lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm (4 °C, 20 min). After supernatant was collected, and protein quantification was performed with BCA reagent to prepare samples. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. After transfer, membranes were blocked with BSA and incubated with primary antibodies (FASN, SLC3A2, GAPDH; 1:1000 dilution) at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the primary antibodies were collected for reuse, and the membranes were washed with TBST (3 × 5 min), followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h with agitation. After final washes with TBST (3 × 10 min), an ECL substrate (1:1 mixture of solutions A and B) was applied, the images were captured using a fluorescence imager. Exposure times were optimized based on signal intensity. RNA-seq for 5637 cells For FASN knockdown experiments, 5637 cells were transfected with negative control or FASN-siRNA1 for 48 h ( n n Cell viability and LDH cytotoxicity detection After seeding 2000 cells per 100 μl in DMEM with 10 % FBS into each well of a 96-well plate, the cells were cultured in an incubator at 37 °C. After 24, 48, or 72 h, the original medium was replaced with a MTS-DMEM mixture (1:9) and incubated in the dark for 2 h. Then, the absorbance of each well was measured at 490 nm to assess the proliferation capacity of bladder cancer cells. LDH activity in damaged cells was measured using a commercial detection kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were seeded at a density of approximately 4000–5000 cells/well and incubated at 37 °C overnight. After 24 h treatment with various drug concentrations, 50 μl cell suspension from control and treatment groups was transferred to a new 96-well plate. Experiments were performed in triplicate. Prior to adding 50 μl stop solution, plates were shaken for 10 s. Then 100 μl freshly prepared reaction mixture was added to each well and incubated at 15–25 °C for up to 30 min. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using an ELISA plate reader. Cell migration ability detection The migration ability of cells was detected using a scratch test. When the cells reached 100 % confluence in the 6-well plate, they were scratched using a 200 μl pipette tip, and the bottom of the plate was marked with black lines to select the same field of vision for photography. After washing the cells three times with PBS to remove the shed cell masses, the cells were cultured in DMEM with 2 % FBS in the incubator. The same field of vision was photographed at 0 h, 24 h, and 48 h to compare the migration ability between the different experimental groups. Cell invasion assay by Transwell chamber Matrigel matrix was diluted 1:10 (v/v) in 1 % DMEM. 100 μl of diluted matrix was added to the upper chamber of Transwell and was evenly spread in the chamber, and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to solidify. Cells (2 × 10⁴/100 μl in 1 % FBS DMEM) were seeded in the upper chamber. After 600μl 10 % FBS DMEM was added to the 24-well plate below the chamber, the cell plate was placed in an incubator at 37 °C with 5 % CO₂. After 48 h incubation, non-invasive cells were removed by cotton swab scraping. Invaded cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde (600 μl, 30 min) and stained with 0.1 % crystal violet (600 μl, 30 min). Following three PBS washes, membranes were air-dried under a fume hood, and the cells were counted under a microscope and photographed. Animal experiments The animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The Guangdong Pharmaceutical University. Twenty-one female Sprague Dawley rats (weight: 180–220 g; age: 6–8 weeks) were obtained from ZhuHai Bestest Biotechnology Limited Company. The rats were allowed to acclimatize for one week in a specific-pathogen-free environment (temperature: 20–26 °C; relative humidity: 40–70 %; high-pressure disinfection equipment, purified water system, and a 12-hour light/dark cycle). All rats were adaptively fed for one week, and their health and behavior were monitored once every 2–3 days. To evaluate the effects of dioscin on a rat model of bladder carcinoma in situ, twenty-one 6–8 week old Sprague Dawley rats that had been adaptively fed for one week were randomly and equally divided into three groups: i) Control (solvent); ii) 6 mg/rat N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU); iii) 5 mg/kg dioscin + 6 mg/rat MNU. The dioscin for animal experiment was dissolved by alcohol. The rats received urethral injections of either solvent (group i) or MNU (groups ii and iii) every two weeks, for a total of six injections (3 months). For group iii, only MNU was injected for the first two injections. For the third and fourth injections, MNU and dioscin were administered simultaneously during bladder instillation without intervals, and the animals' reactions were observed. Due to the death of one rat after the third injection and two rats after the fourth injection, group iii received only MNU for the fifth and sixth injections; dioscin was not administered. Therefore, the administration of dioscin was from the third to fourth administrations, which can examine the potential role of dioscin intervention in the process of MNU-induced in situ bladder. One week after the sixth injection, the animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital, and blood, bladder, liver, and kidney tissues were collected. Death was confirmed by the absence of a heartbeat and muscle relaxation. After the tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned into 5 μm slices, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to observe structural changes in the bladder, kidney, and liver tissues of the rats after treatment. Blood biochemical indices were measured for each group.

(A) miR-195 expression was significantly increased in bladder cancer tissues compared to the normal tissues; (B-C) After transfection of miR-195–5p mimic and negative control (NC) in T24 and EJ cells, the relative expression of miR-195–5p mimic was significantly increased compared to the NC group ( n n n n p p Fig 1 The cell scratch assay results showed that upregulation of miR-195–5p inhibited the migration of bladder cancer T24 cells. Compared to the NC group, miR-195–5p mimic also inhibited the migration of T24 and EJ bladder cancer cells ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Screening compounds for miR-195–5p upregulation in bladder cancer cells Given the limited suitability of miR-195–5p as a direct drug target, we screened five compounds (sorafenib, sunitinib, usninic acid, dioscin and simvastatin) for their potential to upregulate miR-195–5p expression in EJ bladder cancer cells ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Effects of various compounds on bladder cancer cells. (A-E) Although the upregulation by sorafenib (10 μM) and sunitinib (10 μM) did not exihibit significantly, usnic acid (10 μM), dioscin (3 μM) and simvastatin (10 μM) markedly upregulated miR-195–5p expression in EJ bladder cancer cells ( n n n n n n n n n p p Fig 2 Dioscin’s influence on bladder cancer cell morphology and migration Dioscin significantly inhibited the migration of T24 or EJ bladder cancer cells ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Dioscin’s influence on bladder cancer cell morphology and migration.

Overexpressing miR-195–5p in EJ cells decreased FASN protein expression levels compared to the NC group ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Dioscin regulated the miR-195–5p/FASN in bladder cancer cells.

There is no significant effect of DFO (20 μM), Fer-1 (10 μM), NAC (20 μM), Nec (30 μM), and CBX (50 μM) on the T24 cells viability ( Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Dioscin's mechanism of action in bladder cancer cell death.

(A) Venn diagram showing 44 overlapping genes among dioscin-targeted DEGs, bladder cancer-related genes ( GSE3167 Fig. 10 Fig. 10 Fig 10 Discussion In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of FASN/SLC3A2-mediated poor prognosis in bladder cancer patients, thereby revealing the inhibitory effect of dioscin on FASN/SLC3A2 and cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer cells. Our findings indicate that miR-195 acts as a tumor suppressor in bladder cancer by targeting FASN, and this regulatory axis is pharmacologically modulated by dioscin. Additionally, the death of bladder cancer cells induced by dioscin could be partly blocked by inhibitors of ferroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis, suggesting its potential role in inducing PANoptosis, a coordinated cell death pathway integrating pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. However, dioscin exhibited significant cytotoxicity toward normal urothelial cells SV-HUC-1 and renal MDCK cells, and enhanced the induction of bladder cancer by MNU. Furthermore, dioscin combined with MNU can also significantly elevate serum creatinine, uric acid and ALT levels in rats, and cause bladder stones in some rats. Thus, dioscin exhibits a double-edged sword effect in bladder cancer, partly by regulating the miR-195–5p/FASN/SlC3A2 pathway and associated multiple cell death axes. Several plant compounds, such as curcumin, resveratrol, sulforaphane, vitamin E, parthenolide, dioscin, and triptolide, have shown potential inhibitory effects on bladder cancer by targeting multiple molecular pathways [ 4 18 32 35 in vivo Dioscin also promotes apoptosis in prostate cancer cells by increasing SHP1 phosphorylation and activating the MAPK signaling pathway [ 10 6 25 29 24 28 Previous studies have shown that NUP210, SPIRE2, SLC7A1, and DMTN can function as ceRNAs to regulate FASN expression by sponging miR-195 [ 20 26 1 5 34 21 12 23 Dioscin can affect melanoma development and anti-tumor drug sensitivity by affecting connexin 43-mediated gap junction [ 14 15 31 In conclusion, this study reveal the context-dependent dual functionality of dioscin: exhibiting tumor-suppressive effects through miR-195–5p/FASN/SLC3A2 pathway inhibition when administered alone, but paradoxically promoting cancer progression in combination with MNU. Furthermore, we proposes a novel therapeutic strategy targeting FASN/SLC3A2 pathway to overcome cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer by modulating fatty acid metabolism and inducing multiple cell death axes. However, further research is needed to clarify the relationship between dioscin’s toxic and therapeutic doses. Therefore, the optimal dosage, the dual effects of dioscin, its inhibitory impact on bladder cancer when used alone, and its synergistic effects with MNU in bladder cancer induction require further investigation.
