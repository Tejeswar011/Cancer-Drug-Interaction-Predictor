However, no pharmacological agents have been identified as effective against chronic toxoplasmosis. The existing therapeutic options are associated with significant adverse effects, high toxicity, and the potential emergence of drug-resistant strains due to widespread use 10 To date, vaccine studies have been conducted using various platforms, new antigens, various expression systems, and new adjuvants 11 13 14 15 ® 16 On the other hand, subunit vaccines developed by biotechnological approaches do not carry the risk of reversion to virulent forms and are easily produced such as recombinant protein vaccines against HBV, HPV or SARS-CoV-2 17 12 18 19 20 T. gondii T. gondii 21 23 T. gondii 24 25 Saccharomyces cerevisiae 11 14 26 27 Saccharomyces cerevisiae T. gondii Results In silico analysis of ROP6 protein In silico 1 E. coli 28 S. cerevisiae 29 30 1  Table 1 Physico-chemicals properties of full length ROP6 and designed ROP6 proteins.

Next, homogenized cells were lysed at 4 °C under 18.000 psi pressure using M-110 L microfluidic processor using H10Z Z-type chamber (Microfluidics, USA) and the lysed yeast cells were examined under a microscope. Then, the homogenate was centrifuged at 30.000×g for 30 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was passed through a 0.22 μm filter (Corning, USA). The filtered sample was purified with AKTA Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system, controlled by UNICORN™ software (Cytiva, USA), using 5 ml HiTrap Ni2 + Chelating HP column (Cytiva, USA) as previously described 51 SDS-PAGE and Western blot The purity of the rROP6 protein was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as previously described 51 2 2 Vaccination and challenge Female BALB/c mice aged 6–8 weeks were randomly divided into four groups containing twelve mice (12 mice/group). Mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally [(ketamine hydrochloride (Ketalar) 2 mg/kg (1 ml − 5 mg) + 2% xylazine (Alfazyne) 3 mg/kg (1 ml − 20 mg)] and vaccinated two times at 21 days interval through intraperitoneal (IP) route (Fig. 6 2 6 T. gondii T. gondii 6 52 53  Fig. 6 Vaccination schedule and experiments performed.

Then, cell suspensions were added in 96-well cell culture plates at 5 × 10 5 2 51 56 Flow cytometry To evaluate the percentage of CD4 + + + + + Cytokine ELISA Splenocyte cell culture supernatants collected at 72 h were analyzed for the presence of IL-4 and IFN-γ using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFischer Scientific, USA). Briefly, 100 µl/well of the splenocyte supernatants were added to each well of the plate and serially diluted mouse IL-4 and IFN-γ proteins provided by the kit were used to construct standard curves and were determined the concentration of each cytokine in the supernatants. The results were analyzed at 450 nm wavelength using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek EL×808, USA).
