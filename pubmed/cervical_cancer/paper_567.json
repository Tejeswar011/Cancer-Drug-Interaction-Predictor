Conventional molecular diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), require expensive instrumentation and well-equipped laboratories, which limits their applicability in low-resource or decentralized settings. To address this challenge, the aim of this study was to develop a prototype point-of-care (POC) diagnostic platform based on helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) integrated into a microfluidic device for the specific detection of HPV-16 and HPV-18. The proposed POC platform comprises a disposable poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) microfluidic device, a portable warming mat for isothermal amplification at 65 °C, and a compact electrophoresis chamber for fluorescence-based visualization using SYBR Safe dye, with an approximate total cost of $320 USD. Platform validation was performed on 33 samples, demonstrating amplification of target sequences in less than 60 min with only 20 µL of reaction volume, a limit of detection (LOD) of 15 copies (cp) per reaction, a sensitivity of 95.52%, and a specificity of 100%. This portable and scalable platform constitutes a cost-effective and reliable tool for the detection of HPV, supporting global health initiatives, including those driven by the World Health Organization (WHO), aimed at eliminating cervical cancer as a public health threat, as it can be implemented in decentralized or resource-limited settings.

Introduction The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus with a circular genome, classified within the Papillomaviridae 1 2 3 HPV is one of the leading causes of cervical cancer in women, accounting for approximately 660,000 new cases and 350,000 deaths worldwide in 2022 [ 4 Given its high prevalence and significant impact on global health, the World Health Organization (WHO) has launched the “90-70-90” Global Strategy to Eliminate Cervical Cancer, aiming to achieve elimination by 2030 [ 4 Vaccinate 90% of girls under 15 years of age. Ensure that 70% of women receive high-throughput screening in two rounds: the first before age 35 and the second before age 45. Provide appropriate treatment for 90% of women diagnosed with HPV infection, precancerous lesions, or invasive cervical cancer. To support the second and third pillars of this strategy, it is essential to implement accessible, accurate, efficient diagnostic and monitoring tools that provide rapid results. Current molecular diagnostic tests for HPV primarily target high-risk genotypes associated with the development of cervical cancer, including types 16 and 18. These genotypes are responsible for over 70% of cervical cancer cases. Detection is commonly carried out using end-point or quantitative PCR (qPCR) techniques [ 4 5 6 7 8 To overcome these limitations, point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests have emerged as viable alternatives, such as isothermal amplification assays. These tests operate at a constant temperature and enable the amplification of specific DNA sequences, delivering results in less than 60 min [ 9 10 11 12 13 9 10 11 Helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) is one of the notable isothermal amplification methods, which utilizes a DNA helicase (UvrD from Escherichia coli 14 14 15 14 16 17 18 19 9 20 21 22 23 24 25 E. coli Staphylococcus Listeria monocytogenes 26 27 28 29 30 31 In this context, the aim of this study was to develop a POC diagnostic platform based on HDA, integrated into a microfluidic device, for the specific detection of HPV genotypes 16 and 18. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethical Considerations Participants selected for the study were all over 18 years of age. Individuals with mental disabilities and allergies to the medications used in the treatment were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients for the collection, storage, and subsequent analysis of their samples. Sample analysis was performed anonymously to ensure participant confidentiality. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Universitario “Dr. José Eleuterio González”, Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León (Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico) under protocol number PA15-001. 2.2. Sample Collection and Processing Thirty cervical histological tissue samples from Mexican patients were collected between 2024 and 2025 at the Hospital Universitario “Dr. José Eleuterio González”. Genomic DNA was extracted from 25 mg of tissue using the NucleoSpin ® 2.3. Genotyping of DNA Samples The collected DNA samples were analyzed using the QuantStudio™ 3 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), employing the GeneProof HPV PCR kit (GeneProof, Brno-jih, Czech Republic). This kit allows the detection of high-risk HPV genotypes 16, 18 and 45 through genotype-specific fluorescent probes ( Table 1 In addition, three controls were included: one sample positive for low-risk HPV genotype 6 (sample 31, Table 1 Chlamydia trachomatis Table 1 Table 1 Supplementary Materials (Figure S1) 2.4. Standardization of the HDA Reaction Conditions The HDA was standardized to determine the optimal temperature and incubation time. A DNA pool (mixture of 20 samples) positive for HPV genotypes 16 and 18, extracted from cervical tissue samples, was used as a positive control. This DNA was kindly provided by the Department of Pathology at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León. Regarding the negative control, nuclease-free water was included instead of a DNA template to validate the absence of contamination or the obtaining of non-specific amplification products. The IsoAmp ® 4 Table 2 ® ® Reactions were incubated at temperatures ranging from 55 °C to 65 °C for 30 to 120 min using a SimpliAmp thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% agarose gel stained with SYBR Safe (1×) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), employing a DNA ladder from Promega (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) covering a size range of 100 to 1500 base pairs (bp). Additionally, the detection limit (LOD) was determined using a synthetic control corresponding to a purified plasmid containing sequences from HPV genotypes 16 and 18, provided by the Department of Pathology at the Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León. The plasmid concentration was measured using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer, and the copy number per microliter was calculated using the following formula: viral copy number (cp/μL) = (6.02 × 10 −2 −9 2.5. Design and Fabrication of the Microfluidic Device The design was created using AutoCAD 2024 (Autodesk Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) and manufactured using poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA); the components were laser-cut, assembled, and sealed with chloroform. The device measures 2 cm × 2 cm, as illustrated in Figure 1 Figure S2 2.6. Performance and Analysis of HDA Assays on the Microfluidic Platform The HDA reaction integrated into the microfluidic platform was performed in a total volume of 20 µL, consisting of the following components: 2 µL of 10X Hybridization Buffer II, 0.8 µL of MgSO 4 Table 2 ® ® Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure S3 Figure 1 Table 3 2.7. POC Platform The following elements were employed to carry out HPV amplification via HDA: (A) a microfluidic device, (B) a portable warming mat, and (C) a portable electrophoresis chamber. Figure 1 2.8. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab ® 3. Results 3.1. Standardization of Reaction Conditions To optimize the HDA assay for the detection of HPV genotypes 16 and 18, a temperature gradient from 55 °C to 65 °C was evaluated. A pooled DNA sample positive for HPV genotypes 16 and 18, obtained from cervical tissue, was used as the positive control. For the negative control, the amplification reaction was performed in the absence of template DNA. Reactions were prepared in 50 µL volumes using Eppendorf tubes and carried out according to the IsoAmp ® Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 To establish the optimal reaction time, HDA reactions with primers targeting HPV18 were incubated for 30–120 min. Amplification products were detectable within 30 min ( Figure 2 Figure 2 3.2. Detection of HPV Genotypes 16 and 18 Using the POC Platform Following the optimization of reaction conditions in microtubes, HDA was implemented on the 2 cm × 2 cm microfluidic device ( Figure 1 Figure 3 Figure 1 In parallel, the samples were stained with SYBR Safe to enable direct, on-chip visual detection of HPV genotypes 16 and 18. Under blue light, positive samples exhibited a green fluorescent signal, while negative samples displayed an orange signal. The results obtained by gel electrophoresis ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure S4 Table 1 Table 1 Figure S4 p Table 4 Figure S4 Chlamydia trachomatis Figure S4 Figure S4 4. Discussion Here, we report a prototype microfluidic platform integrating helicase-dependent amplification (HDA) for the simple, cost-effective detection of high-risk HPV genotypes 16 and 18 in a point-of-care (POC) setting. Test conditions were standardized using a pooled sample containing both genotypes, enabling biological heterogeneity and the inclusion of a broader range of variables. This strategy reduces operational costs and minimizes the number of individual tests required, while ensuring reliable platform performance [ 32 33 Among the findings of this POC platform is the obtaining of results around 60 min, with a LOD of 15 cp per reaction. Moreover, the platform demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.52% and a specificity of 100%, with only one false negative detected, likely due to target DNA degradation or the presence of inhibitors in the sample that interfered with isothermal amplification [ 34 Chlamydia trachomatis 9 24 35 36 Furthermore, this microfluidic platform allows the use of a significantly reduced reaction volume of 20 µL, unlike standard HDA assays that require reaction volumes of around 50 µL, and other isothermal POC systems that often exceed reaction volumes of 30 µL, thereby reducing the overall cost of reactions [ 15 37 38 39 40 The isothermal nature of the HDA enabled incubation using a portable warming mat, contributing to a user-friendly and cost-efficient setup. This simple POC platform allows for the incubation of more than 60 samples per hour, resulting in a processing capacity of several hundred samples per day. Notably, the performance of this platform is comparable to that of HPV detection systems currently recommended by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) WHO, which offer processing capacities ranging from 45 to 471 samples per day. Nevertheless, comparative studies using clinical samples are necessary to accurately evaluate its performance and operational feasibility [ 41 42 43 On the other hand, the use of SYBR Safe as a fluorescent marker enables rapid and straightforward interpretation of results. While the application of SYBR Safe in HDA assays has not been previously reported, a study by Yamket et al. (2023) demonstrated the use of SYBR Green following HDA to detect bacterial DNA in platelet samples [ 38 38 In this context, the platform stands out for its operational simplicity, without the need for multiple steps that complicate its use. Although there are innovative isothermal diagnostic systems, their implementation often involves extra procedural steps, for example, the system developed by Kundrod et al. (2023), which detects HPV genotypes 16 and 18 by isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) followed by detection using lateral flow strips [ 44 45 Another significant advantage of the developed platform is its low implementation cost, estimated at US $320.10 ( Table 2 8 8 46 47 Figure 4 Despite the multiple advantages demonstrated by this proof of concept, several areas of opportunity remain to be addressed. A key limitation is the need to increase the sample size for large-scale clinical validation of the platform, which is essential to establish its robustness and generalizability. In addition, isothermal amplification on the developed platform currently requires a prior DNA extraction step. To address this, the future integration of a rapid and user-friendly DNA lysis and extraction step directly onto the chip is planned. Likewise, additional work is required to standardize and evaluate alternative fluorescent or colorimetric dyes to identify the most suitable option that allows for real-time, naked-eye interpretation of results without the need for an electrophoresis chamber, thereby improving usability in field settings. Another option is the integration of an automated DNA extraction and signal reading system, which would reduce user dependency and increase the overall reliability of the platform. 5. Conclusions In this pilot study, we developed a POC platform based on isothermal HDA testing for the detection of HPV genotypes 16 and 18, achieving amplification of target DNA in 60 min, with a LOD of 15 cp per reaction. This work demonstrates that accessible, simple, and low-cost components can enable the development of practical and attractive diagnostic solutions. As a proof of concept, this platform represents a promising tool for future implementation in remote areas, where access to molecular diagnostics is often limited by high costs and infrastructure requirements. This platform costs approximately $320 USD, making it an ideal diagnostic test for the development of mobile laboratories using greenhouses and basic instrumentation. This approach will allow the establishment of functional molecular testing workspaces at a total cost of less than $2500 USD, with substantial test processing capacity, and can be applied to detect different pathogens.
