This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license ( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are becoming an increasingly common environmental pollutant. They have been detected in fruit, vegetables, drinking water, seafood, meat, dairy products, and cereals, with particularly high levels often being found in processed foods. The presence of MNPs varies significantly depending on the type of food, geographical region, method of food preparation, and packaging materials used. Of the three main routes of human exposure to MNPs, ingestion is the most important. This article provides a comprehensive review of food contamination by MNPs, including an assessment of the impact of various factors on the MNP abundance. For the first time, it also evaluates the differences in MNP intake among individuals following three typical European dietary patterns: the Mediterranean, Western, and lacto-ovo-vegetarian. The lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet was found to result in the highest MNP intake (69.1 × 10 6 6 microplastic and nanoplastic intake food contamination Europe nutrition models lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet western diet Mediterranean diet food pyramid This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction For many years, plastics have successfully displaced other materials, such as glass, paper, metals, cotton, wood, and even concrete, due to their durability, lower cost of production and transport, lower thermal conductivity, better barrier properties, and the unlimited range of shapes and colours they can be moulded into [ 1 2 3 The term ‘microplastic’ was first coined in 2004 by Thompson et al. [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 MNPs are ubiquitous environmental pollutants, found in products related to almost every sphere of life. Consequently, their concentration in the environment is constantly increasing [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 6 23 24 25 26 11 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 5 7 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 Section 7 According to analyses conducted in 2019 [ 49 50 Considering all of the above, as well as the differences in MNP content in food products and the differentiated consumption of various products depending on the country and consumer wealth, it is clear that the amount of plastic consumed by a given person will vary greatly and depend on many factors, including diet. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a completely new perspective on the problem of the presence of MNPs in food products, using the food pyramid and the differences between various European dietary patterns as a basis. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was conducted on the presence of MNPs in various food products typical of different European countries. Three dietary patterns were selected for use in assessing MNP intake with various diets. Attention was also paid to the sources of MNPs and activities that may increase or reduce human exposure to them. 2. Sources of MNPs in the Environment and Pathways of Contamination Plastic particles are present throughout the globe in all environments, regardless of latitude, climate, or human presence, posing a significant risk of exposure to all living organisms, including aquatic and terrestrial organisms, such as microorganisms, plants, animals, and humans [ 51 Figure 1 52 Plastic particles have been found in water, air, and soil. When the review mentions the presence of MNPs in water, this refers to any form of water and any type of reservoir or aquatic environment. This includes all the world’s seas and oceans [ 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 58 74 75 76 77 57 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 83 84 86 Plastic particles are present in the air, both indoors and outdoors, with higher levels of MNP contamination found in indoor air [ 16 90 91 21 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 20 98 100 101 23 26 102 103 104 105 63 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 The presence of plastic in the environment is possible because of its five main characteristics and properties: it is a synthetic material with a high polymer content, it is a solid particle, it measures less than 5 mm, it is insoluble in water, and it does not undergo complete degradation. Sources of MNPs can be classified as primary or secondary [ 114 115 Figure 1 Sources and routes of contamination of the environment by micro- and nanoplastics. Adapted from [ 20 23 26 78 94 101 102 114 116 117 118 119 Primary sources include the intentional industrial use of various types of plastic, which can enter the environment directly in the form of small particles, e.g., as a result of abrasion, weathering, or unintentional loss or spillage during the production, transport, use, maintenance, or recycling of products containing plastic or plastic pellets (mainly unintentionally) [ 114 35 87 88 120 114 The following sources have been identified as the main contributors to the release of MNPs into the environment ( Figure 1 Mechanical fragmentation of plastic products during normal, daily use or as a result of weathering, abrasion, and pouring of particular objects, especially when improperly recycled (synthetic shoe soles, toys, synthetic kitchen utensils, medical devices, infrastructure components, buildings, equipment, carpets, furniture) [ 99 121 122 123 124 Vehicle tyres due to abrasion while driving [ 97 116 125 Broken plastic fishing ropes and nets [ 126 Synthetic textiles—through abrasion and shedding of fibres during laundry washing and drying [ 127 128 Artificial turf [ 129 130 131 103 132 133 Cosmetic cleansers and other personal care products [ 87 88 120 Paints used for road marking (e.g., paint, thermoplastic, preformed polymer tape, and epoxy degraded due to weathering and abrasion by vehicles) [ 134 135 114 It should be highlighted that plastic items and their fragments, as well as microplastics and nanoplastics derived from them, accumulate in the environment primarily due to their high resistance to biodegradation. The time it takes for plastics to degrade depends on the polymer that makes up the plastic particles, the environment [ 136 52 136 52 137 138 Photodegradation (photocatalytic degradation, photooxidation)—under the influence of light (both visible and UV, usually from sunlight) in outdoor exposure conditions [ 139 140 141 142 Physical degradation—caused by mechanical action, for example, during cleaning, transport, laundry, drying, or by shear stress forces [ 83 120 143 144 145 Thermal degradation—under the influence of high temperatures, accelerated by the presence of oxygen (thermo-oxidative degradation) [ 14 121 146 147 148 Hydrolytic degradation—occurring in an aqueous environment, when ester or amide bonds undergo cleavage [ 14 149 150 Biodegradation and biodisintegration—the action of living organisms (usually microbes) resulting from the activity of their enzymes, which cause hydrolysis and chain cleavage, as well as fragmentation of larger particles into smaller ones [ 52 151 3. Entry Routes of MNPs into the Human Body It is recognised that MNPs can enter the human body via three key routes. These are inhalation, dermal penetration, and ingestion [ 115 3.1. Inhalation of Airborne Plastic Particles An important role is played here by both indoor breathing, where the air is polluted with particles originating, among other things, from clothing [ 152 153 90 154 97 16 20 155 156 104 105 132 157 158 159 118 160 161 76 162 163 92 164 Dris et al. [ 90 3 3 3 164 165 166 167 168 3.2. Dermal Penetration of Nanoplastic Particles Microplastic particles, and to an even greater extent NPs, can penetrate the skin during bathing and daily personal hygiene, either from water containing MNPs or from personal hygiene products and cosmetics, face masks, or dressings [ 88 169 170 171 172 33 167 173 174 175 176 177 170 178 3.3. Ingestion of MNPs Micro- and nanoplastic particles, independently of their size, can enter the human gastrointestinal tract and the body by direct ingestion or via trophic transfer. Direct ingestion mainly occurs when humans consume potable water containing MNPs, as well as various soft drinks, alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, or meals prepared using contaminated tap water. MNPs can also be swallowed accidentally from non-food sources during oral hygiene and tooth brushing from sources such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, orthodontic implants, and denture materials [ 88 179 180 181 182 18 19 61 183 184 17 82 185 186 187 188 189 190 184 191 192 144 193 194 149 195 196 195 197 198 65 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 Trophic transfer of MNPs occurs when aquatic organisms or food prepared from plant or animal raw materials that have ‘absorbed’ MNPs from the environment (water, air, soil) or from feed are consumed. The accumulation of MNPs in the tissues of aquatic organisms occurs as a result of the accidental ingestion of micro- or nanoplastic particles from polluted water reservoirs ( Figure 2 27 29 67 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 36 28 31 213 214 215 216 121 123 217 Of the three routes of human exposure to MNPs mentioned above, both inhalation and skin penetration depend on the size of the plastic particles, whereas ingestion applies to MNPs of all sizes. Moreover, the walls of the human digestive tract have a surface area of approximately 200 m 2 115 218 219 220 3 153 115 The growing awareness of the impact of environmental pollution, including the presence of micro- and nanoplastics in water, soil, air, and food, is reflected in the regulations implemented by the European Union. The infographic below ( Figure 3 4. Mechanisms of Food Contamination The degree of microplastic pollution in foodstuffs depends not only on the raw materials used, the farming techniques employed, and the fodder used to rear livestock, but also on the techniques and apparatus used to process and preserve the obtained raw materials and the materials used in production, particularly those used to package finished foodstuffs [ 2 14 147 14 147 195 148 221 4.1. Kitchen Accessories, Food Preparation, and Food Packaging as a Source of MNPs in Meals One of the most important pathways by which plastics penetrate food is, of course, through the trophic chain. Micro- and nanoplastic particles from the environment enter and accumulate in the tissues of plants and animals ( Figure 2 121 123 217 222 223 224 225 226 227 2 121 228 229 6 6 229 230 231 Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is the trade name for Teflon, which is often used to make non-stick pots and pans. When using these items, the Teflon surface of the cookware may be mechanically damaged, e.g., by scratching with sharp cutlery when stirring food, or it may degrade due to the normal process of thermal ageing [ 232 233 6 234 235 2 2 8 7 2 236 9 237 222 Analysis of kitchen bowls made from different types of plastic and used with hand mixers has shown that various amounts of microplastic particles are released through abrasion when mechanical or thermal stress is applied, depending on the material used for production (melamine, ABS, PP, LDPE, PS, and styrene-acrylonitrile (SAN)) [ 121 238 121 239 The release of MNPs from packaging into food is affected by the type of heat treatment used, as well as by large temperature changes. Storing packaged food at low temperatures (typically −21 °C in a freezer, 4 °C in a refrigerator) and then reheating it (approx. 40–50 °C) or exposing it to high temperatures of up to 250 °C during thermal food processing (e.g., boiling, baking, stewing, frying, reheating in a microwave oven, pasteurisation) may affect the integrity of the plastic used for the packaging and dishes involved in these activities. In a study by Hussain et al. [ 230 6 9 2 240 Shi et al. [ 198 7 3 241 3 242 3 3 243 244 12 3 According to Zhou’s study [ 245 149 10 9 4 4 196 246 247 248 6 It should be mentioned that the results from different studies may vary due to the various methods used to calculate the amount of particles. The most commonly used methods include scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman imaging, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), stereomicroscopy or fluorescence microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) [ 249 A particularly important role in the release of plastics into food is also played by items used for transporting and distributing food, as well as for serving food in restaurants and catering services. These items include food containers, trays, and packaging films made from LDPE, PP, EPS, or extruded polystyrene (XPS), which are used to distribute meat, cheese, salads, fruit, and ready-to-eat food. Other items include packaging for takeaway food and beverages containing PP, PS, PE, PET, or EPS; snack and sweet wrappers made from PP; PET bottles for water; cartons for soft drinks and fruit juices; and HDPE bottles for milk [ 11 13 151 225 250 221 251 252 Katsara et al. [ 253 2 254 255 3 256 257 Many consumers are certainly open to the idea that disposable plastic water bottles can be a source of MPs in the water they drink. However, only a few are aware that the same problem also applies to glass bottles [ 185 258 259 260 144 261 3 262 263 3 3 3 185 205 264 3 260 3 3 3 17 3 3 3 3 3 259 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 259 Bottled mineral water usually originates from sources that are protected from pollution, so the better quality of such water is expected. Moreover, water packaged in single-use containers must meet higher microbiological criteria than drinking water available from the tap. However, packaging it in plastic bottles (disposable or reusable) can result in an increased transfer of MNPs to the water, especially when the packaging is handled improperly (e.g., exposure to sunlight, high temperatures, or mechanical stress) or the plastic used for bottle production is thin or of poor quality, or when bottles are washed before filling. Ten brands of still or sparkling mineral water distributed in PET plastic bottles and purchased from different supermarkets in the province of Catania (Italy) were examined, and MP particles were detected in all of the samples [ 265 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 266 In light of all the above, kitchen equipment and accessories, as well as containers and films used for serving and storing food, can be considered significant sources of MNPs in food. However, it is worth remembering activities not entirely associated with meal preparation, such as washing and cleaning (washing countertops, appliances, and kitchenware). A dish sponge that is used every day to clean cookware and eating utensils can release particles from both the soft and hard layers, mainly Nylon 6 (PA6) and PET [ 267 2 268 Awareness of where MNPs come from in food and during which kitchen operations they are produced in the greatest quantities can help reduce the consumption of MNP particles with food. For human health reasons, it is also extremely important to use materials that are tested and approved for food contact, and to use them in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (such as ‘for use in an oven’, ‘suitable for microwave’, or ‘use only at temperatures below 71 °C’). 4.2. Plastics Particles Identified in Various Types of Food As previously mentioned, it has been estimated that the average person unintentionally ingests 39,000–52,000 MNPs per year, which corresponds to consuming up to 5 g of plastic per week [ 49 50 The types of polymers detected in food also depend on the type of the particles entering the raw materials from water, air, and soil; the production process used and its stages (e.g., filtration, homogenisation, washing, dilution, mixing, filling, capping); and the materials used for food packaging (or take-out containers) as well as kitchen accessories used for meal preparation. Depending on the thermoplastic resin used, there are six types of plastic materials that are most commonly used to make recyclable plastic packaging. These are polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (known as type 1); high-density polyethylene (HDPE) (type 2); polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (type 3); low-density polyethylene (LDPE) (type 4); polypropylene (PP) (type 5); and polystyrene (PS) (type 6). The last group (type 7) consists of multilayer plastics and other plastics that are not usually collected for recycling [ 269 11 13 Food guidelines across various nations emphasise the significance of maintaining adequate hydration, advocating that water should constitute the primary fluid component of our diet, with a recommended daily intake of up to 2.5 dm 3 270 200 The awareness of the importance of hydration for health leads many people, especially in highly developed countries, to always carry a bottle of drinking water with them. Water is sold in various types of packaging, ranging from glass bottles (rarely used by consumers due to their weight and fragility) to disposable bottles made of PET or recycled PET (rPET), as well as various types of reusable packaging made of metal or plastic (PE, PP, and PA) [ 17 266 260 17 266 271 272 Microplastic particles were also identified in other beverages. Packaged milk from different geographical regions contained various polymers, including PES, PET, PTFE, Nylon 6, PU, PP, PAM, PS, PE, EVA, and PVA, as well as polyethersulfone (PESU) and polysulfone (PSU) [ 273 274 275 276 186 277 278 149 279 259 194 The type of plastic identified in other food products mainly depended on the environmental pollution of soil in which the plants were grown and the animals were bred, or on the level of microplastic contamination in the sea and oceans, when related to fish and seafood. According to calculations made for adult Irish people, the simulated estimated daily intake of MNPs was 1.62 × 10 3 280 39 281 282 282 283 281 284 285 213 The main polymers identified in MPs isolated from Indian rice were PE, PET, PP, and PA [ 286 287 288 Tests on food of animal origin revealed the presence of PMMA in 68% of Dutch cows’ milk samples and polymers of polyvinyl chloride (PVC-P) in 16%, while PP and polymers of styrene (Styr-P) were not detected in any of the milk samples [ 289 290 When analysing studies on polymers detected in various milk samples, a clear difference in composition was observed between milk samples from different countries. Samples of pasteurised, packaged milk purchased from local markets and stores in India were found to contain PE, PP, and PAM [ 276 274 275 273 274 An analysis of commonly consumed protein-rich products in the USA, including both animal-based products such as shrimp, chicken breast and nuggets, sirloin steak, pork chops, and minced pollock, as well as alternative plant-based products such as vegetable nuggets, vegetable fish sticks, minced vegetable beef, and tofu, revealed the presence of PET/PES, PE, and PP [ 291 292 293 210 29 294 295 296 297 298 299 Donax trunculus 300 301 294 302 Some microplastic particles (identified as PE) were detected in eggs, and their level was higher in egg yolks than in egg whites, probably due to their lipophilic nature [ 303 A high number of microplastic particles, mainly smaller than 10 μm, were detected in four types of commercially available edible oil bottled in PET (olive oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, and coconut oil). The dominant polymers identified were poly(ethyl acrylate:St:acrylamide) and poly(ethylene:propylene); however, no PET microplastics were detected in the oils after incubation for 10 days at 40 °C [ 304 305 Four different polymers were identified in samples of honey produced in Turkey: PE (62%) and Nylon 6 (22.3%), followed by EVA and PP [ 306 307 308 308 309 310 Although salt and sugar are just the additives used in food, many people use them in large quantities that far exceed nutritional guidelines. The type of plastic polymers found in salt depends on its origin. Table salt can be produced from sea salt, so the amount and type of MNPs will be influenced by the geological location of origin, as well as subsequent stages of production (e.g., solar evaporation, crystallisation, packaging, and transport). Rock and well salts can also become contaminated during collection and drying. Refined salt can become polluted during mechanical treatment, while an unrefined type of salt is exposed to MNP contamination from the air on the surface of the crystallisers [ 311 188 216 312 313 314 216 315 It is worth noting that, in addition to the MNPs found in salt, sugar, and food seasonings, further polymer particles may be abraded onto food when mechanical grinders are used for salt or spice disruption. The chemical composition of these particles depends on the materials and mechanisms employed by the grinder manufacturer. Research from Poland [ 316 4.3. Plastic-Associated Chemicals and Other Contaminants It should be remembered that various contaminants can also enter the body alongside MNPs and negatively influence living organisms. These include additives used in the production of plastics, such as plasticisers (e.g., phthalates, bisphenol A), fillers, flame retardants, heat or light stabilisers, colourants, antioxidants, lubricants, and antistatic agents [ 15 317 35 40 41 318 319 317 320 321 321 322 323 317 324 325 326 135 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 321 348 317 331 349 350 Triclosan (2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxydiphenyl ether, TCS) is a chemical compound with antimicrobial activity that was often added to food storage containers and kitchen utensils. It has been shown that TCS can exert a negative impact on human health. Consequently, it has been removed from the list of authorised additives in some countries, e.g., the EU; however, many food containers containing TCS are still available through online sales platforms [ 351 5. Food Pyramid as a Graphical Representation of FDBG and Various Dietary Patterns The food pyramid was first introduced by the Swedes in 1974. Its creation was linked to high food prices and the person of Anna-Britt Agnsäter, who wanted to show the Swedish population how to eat healthily and reduce their fat intake. She first published her concept in the Vi magazine. Her pyramid had cheap and nutritious ‘basic products’ at the bottom, including milk, cheese, margarine, bread, potatoes, and cereals, followed by a large section of fruit and vegetables. At the top were ‘supplementary products’ such as meat, fish, and eggs, which were intended to provide nutrients that were insufficient in the basic products [ 352 353 Graphical representations of dietary recommendations for consumers are common. The pyramid, in particular, immediately shows what constitutes the basis of a diet, i.e., which foods should be consumed in the largest quantities and most frequently, while at the top of the triangle are foods that people should only consume occasionally. The pyramid concept has gained many supporters and has been adopted in other countries, where it has been adapted to local conditions, including climatic and geographical ones. Various food pyramids are currently in use in countries and regions such as Scandinavia, Sri Lanka, the United States, China, and Japan. Food pyramids and other forms of food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) have also been presented on the websites of various European and international institutions such as the WHO, the FAO, the USDA, the EFSA, and the EU [ 354 Almost every European country has its own dietary recommendations, which are often presented in a unique graphic format that continues to evolve as new knowledge about the diet’s impact on health becomes available [ 355 356 357 358 359 There are also food pyramids designed for specific population groups within a country, such as adults, children, the elderly, pregnant women, and people with certain conditions (e.g., the Crohn’s Disease Food Pyramid or the Cardiac Food Pyramid). The basic adult version of the pyramid differs from those for older people and children, of course. This is due to the specific nutritional needs of seniors and the challenges associated with children’s intensive growth and development, including physical challenges. Furthermore, given the limited access to animal protein in many parts of the world, and the growing awareness of the environmental and health benefits of replacing meat with plant-based products in other regions, versions of the food pyramid for vegetarians and vegans have also emerged. Depending on the cereals, fruits, and vegetables available in a given geographical region, different types of vegetarian diets can be identified, and therefore different pyramids can be created. When establishing a vegetarian food pyramid, it is important to bear in mind that, unlike meat, plants only occasionally contain complete proteins, i.e., proteins containing all the essential amino acids. Therefore, in order to obtain a complete protein profile, it is necessary to either consume a variety of protein-rich vegetarian products (known as complementary protein building) or include plant products containing all nine essential amino acids in the diet. Currently, the term ‘traditional vegetarian diet’ usually refers to the healthy, traditional, lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets practised in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. These are typically anchored on the Mediterranean diet pyramid, which is widely regarded as one of the healthiest. In recent years, Europe has experienced an increase in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and various cancers [ 360 361 According to the WHO, 25 of its European Region member states already have government-approved FBDGs, and eight countries are developing such guidelines [ 362 Supplementary Material 355 362 363 Western Europe (WE): Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom ( Table S1 Supplementary Material Nordic and Baltic countries (NBC): Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania ( Table S2 Central and Eastern Europe (CEE): Belarus, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, North Macedonia, Moldova, Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine ( Table S3 Southern Europe (SE): Albania, Andorra, Greece, Italy, Malta, Monaco, Portugal, Spain, Croatia, Montenegro, San Marino, and Turkey ( Table S4 6. Assessment of the MNP Intake Depending on Dietary Patterns It is obvious that the human diet must provide nutrients, primarily protein, fat, and carbohydrates, which are essential for survival and good health. These basic nutrients originate from completely different raw materials and foodstuffs, depending on dietary habits and geographical location, which means they provide different amounts of MNP particles. In many countries, especially poorer ones, fish caught by people themselves is the most important source of protein. The same applies to commercially available seafood [ 294 210 364 365 366 367 212 368 369 370 371 301 372 207 209 295 36 373 374 37 375 Vicia faba 38 228 276 290 291 Carbohydrates can be found in a wide variety of foods. Healthy sources include unprocessed or minimally processed whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and beans, while unhealthy sources include white bread, rice, pastries, sodas, and other highly processed or refined foods. The recommended intake for adults and children over 1 year old is about 130 g of carbohydrates per day, which should account for 45–65% of total calories [ 376 213 377 378 379 36 280 380 381 382 383 216 384 385 220 9 3 Fats in the human diet can come from animals (both land and aquatic species) or plant sources (extracted from oilseeds or found in edible fruits, seeds, and kernels). The first group includes butter, lard, and pork fat, as well as foods that are rich in fat, such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products (including various cheeses). Considered healthier, vegetable fats include olive oil, rapeseed oil, coconut oil, and palm oil. Other sources of plant lipids include walnuts, almonds, avocados, olives, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds. As mentioned earlier, fish, meat, milk, and dairy products can be contaminated with MPs [ 228 256 273 386 387 304 305 6.1. Methodology Used for the Assessment Based on the available data on nutritional recommendations in European countries mentioned in the previous chapter, food products can be divided into seven categories that are most commonly included in the food pyramid: (1) water; (2) grains (bread, rice, pasta, cereals) and potatoes; (3) vegetables and fruit, including juices; (4) milk and dairy products; (5) protein sources (meat, fish, eggs, legumes); (6) oils, fats, nuts, and seeds; and (7) culinary additives to food (salt, sugar, honey, spices). Due to significant differences in the recommendations formulated within the FBDGs between subregions and countries, it is impossible to estimate the amount of MNPs consumed by the European population. Moreover, significant differences in the amount of MNPs can be noted within one food category. For example, differences have been observed between fish/seafood and poultry, and between sweetened and unsweetened beverages. For the purposes of this review, therefore, three artificial ‘average food pyramids’ or dietary patterns were constructed in order to estimate MNPs consumption. All of these pyramids contain the items listed above, but—due to the aforementioned reasons—food products were categorised into 12 groups. Firstly, fruit was separated from vegetables, and potatoes were included in the latter category. Secondly, fish were considered separately from meat, which can include poultry and red meat, as well as highly processed meat, depending on the dietary pattern. In many FBDGs, red meat and processed meat are recommended to be replaced with legume seeds (e.g., beans, peas, chickpeas, lentils, and broad beans) and nuts. Therefore, we created a separate food group, number 6, for legumes and nuts. Moreover, water was added as a separate group, because adequate hydration is the basis of proper nutrition and a healthy lifestyle in all recommendations. However, depending on the dietary pattern adopted, this can be achieved by drinking pure tap water (the recommended option), as well as various types of bottled beverages, including sweetened ones. As the number of MNPs varies according to the type of water, average values for tap water and pure water packaged in plastic bottles (in a 1:1 ratio) were used in the calculations. For the Western diet only, bottled water and sweetened beverages (in a 1:1 ratio) were used as the fluids for hydration. Although all 12 food groups are mentioned in the tables presenting the dietary patterns, their proportions vary depending on the chosen diet. In some cases, the values equal zero when a particular food is not consumed (e.g., meat in a lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet). For the calculation, we generally used the relationship whereby 1 g of either sugar or protein provides 4 kcal of energy, whereas 1 g of fat provides 9 kcal. However, the average caloric values of individual product groups were estimated primarily based on available literature. In each pyramid (dietary pattern), we took a calorie requirement of 2000 kcal into account, but this was fulfilled with different proportions of food products. None of the proposed pyramids included alcohol, such as wine and beer, as the decision to consume or not consume alcohol is more an individual choice than a cultural or dietary one. The average number of MNPs in a given category of food was estimated based on the available literature. All available databases, platforms, and search engines were utilised in the search for publications and other relevant documents. These included, for example, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Academia, JSTOR, DOAJ, EBSCO, AGRICOLA, Embase, Archive.org, Science.gov, and Refseek. Searches were also conducted on the websites of institutions such as the WHO, FAO, and EFSA, as well as on the websites of individual journals and publishers (e.g., Oxford Academic Journals, Elsevier, Springer Link, RSC Journals, MDPI, ACS Journals, AIP Journals, APS Journals, SAGE Journals, De Gruyter, Taylor & Francis, and Wiley Online Library). As the most popular databases did not yield enough useful articles for estimation purposes, a manual search was conducted. This involved entering the desired detailed keywords, together with the names of particular European countries and different types of fruit, vegetables, cereals, seafood, and meat, into various databases. This search was conducted using various combinations of the following keywords: particle(s), microparticle(s), plastic, microplastic(s), nanoplastic(s), MP, MPs, NP, NPs, MNP, MNPs, microfragment(s), film(s), microfilm(s), fibre(s), microfibre(s), polymer(s), microbead(s), food, food products, foodstuff, processed food, ultra-processed food, refined food, food preparation, fast food, ready-to-eat products, consumption, ingestion, intake, level, concentration, number, amount, trophic transfer, trophic chain, food chain, storage, packaging, disposable, reusable, take-out, takeaway, container(s), box(es), bottle(s), dish(es), cap(s), teabag(s), capsule(s), contamination, pollution, water, tap water, treated water, potable water, drinkable water, juice, beer, wine, drink(s), beverage(s), mineral water, groundwater, coffee, tea, soft drink, cola, plant(s), edible parts, root, leaves, fruit(s), vegetable(s), avocados, olives, banana, berry, berries, apple, pear, orange, carrot, lettuce, broccoli, onion, tomato, cucumber, potato, tofu, nori, legume(s), soybean, soy, bean(s), peas, chickpeas, lentils, broad beans, corn, oats, barley, wheat, sorghum, rye, grains, whole grains, cereals, flour, bread, rice, pasta, pastries, salt, sugar, honey, seasonings, spices, French fries, animal(s), animal products, dairy, milk, cheese, yoghurt, egg(s), pork, turkey, chicken, poultry, meat, red meat, butter, lard, steak, beef, sausages, bacon, seafood, oysters, crabs, mussels, prawns, shrimp, squid, fish, sardine(s), sprat(s), bivalves, crustaceous, burgers, oil(s), fats, olive oil, rapeseed oil, coconut oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, oilseed, seed(s), kernels, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, nuts, walnuts, almonds. The main criteria for selecting literature sources to estimate MNP concentration in food and MNP intake were (a) access to the full text of the publication; (b) data available in English or Polish; (c) results relating to a European country (e.g., MNP intake in Europe, plant and animal raw materials and water originating from Europe); and (d) the publication provided the number of MNPs in particles/g or particles/cm 3 Table 1 Due to the enormous variation in the abundance of MNPs reported by various researchers, the arithmetic mean was used to estimate MNP intake. This was calculated using data from all available studies analysing food from a given group. For example, the MNP content in vegetables has been calculated based on the average number of MNPs reported in carrots, lettuce, broccoli, onions, tomatoes, and potatoes, whereas the MNP content in fruit was calculated based on the presence of these particles in apples and pears. The literature sources used in the estimation have also been listed in Table 1 Only one publication reporting on the MNP content of eggs was found. For the purposes of the calculations, it was assumed that the average egg weighed 55 g and the microplastic content present in 1 g of egg was then calculated. In order to calculate how many MNPs are consumed with food from group 9b (meat and ultra-processed food), depending on the dietary pattern used, two assumptions were made. (1) In the case of ‘take-out’ meals, representing processed solid food, data from a single publication [ 251 2 148 230 (2) As an example of processed liquid food, cold beverages, coffee, and tea, purchased in plastic cups for takeaway, have been chosen. In this case, again, the differences in the reported number of MNPs released into the beverage were enormous and depended on many factors. For the calculations, a publication that used a method most closely resembling the typical brewing of tea (i.e., 250 cm 3 397 9 149 Based on the assumptions above, the amount of MNPs in 1 g of food from group 9b was estimated using the following proportions: 1 portion of meat (200 g): 1 takeaway meal (400 g): 1 takeaway beverage (250 cm 3 Generally, the average concentration of MNPs in a given food group was adopted for the further part of our review ( Section 6.2 The analytical methods used also have a huge impact on the values obtained. Some of them are limited to testing microplastics only; others test microplastics and nanoplastics separately, and still others test all of these particles. Furthermore, specific methods have limitations regarding the size of particles that can be detected; some are capable of detecting particles as small as nanometres, while others can only detect particles measured in micrometres or millimetres. Moreover, studies present data in various units such as particles/individual, particles/g, particles/kg, particles/dm 3 6.2. MNP Intake According to Three Different Dietary Patterns in Europe The aim of this review was to estimate the effect of the adopted dietary pattern on the amount of MNPs consumption; therefore, the same average values (from Table 1 The pyramids that have been designed represent the three most important dietary patterns in Europe: Pattern 1—a Mediterranean diet, or more specifically, the healthy eating pyramid based on the Mediterranean diet ( Figure 4 362 Table 2 Pattern 2—an unhealthy, but unfortunately common in WE and SSE, Western diet pyramid ( Figure 5 Table 3 Pattern 3—a lacto-ovo-vegetarian pyramid ( Figure 6 Table 4 These diets not only contain different proportions of protein, fat, and carbohydrate sources but also different sources of these nutrients. Therefore, a diet that is beneficial to human health due to the nutrients it provides may be detrimental due to the MNPs contained in the raw materials and products used. In the healthy eating dietary pattern (Pattern 1), fish, seafood, legumes, and fresh dairy products are the main sources of protein, while carbohydrates and dietary fibre are provided by pasta, rice, and bread made from whole-grain cereals, together with vegetables and fruits. Extra-virgin olive oil and nuts provide healthy oils [ 403 3 Figure 4 Table 2 Figure 4 Food pyramid representing a healthy eating dietary pattern based on the Mediterranean diet.

The Western dietary pattern (Pattern 2) has been based on the SAD adapted to European conditions [ 408 409 Figure 5 Table 3 Moreover, people who follow this dietary pattern often replace water and fresh fruit with fruit juices, carbonated drinks, energy drinks, takeaway beverages, coffee, or tea. They also tend to eat large quantities of snacks and sweets. Taken together, these meals and beverages can constitute a significant source of MNPs, as well as sugar and calories in a diet.

The lacto-ovo-vegetarian dietary pattern (Pattern 3) excludes meat, fish, and rennet-derived cheeses, thus rendering legumes, nuts, milk, yoghurt, certain cheeses, and eggs the primary sources of protein ( Figure 6 Table 4 407 Figure 6 Food pyramid representing a lacto-ovo-vegetarian dietary pattern.

It is certainly important to note that people who are conscious of healthy eating usually prepare meals themselves. Therefore, the MNPs in their diet will come from the raw materials used to prepare the meals, as well as from the kitchen utensils and accessories used for cooking and serving. By contrast, the vast majority of MNPs in the diets of people who consume ready-made meals and takeaway food will be the result of these particles entering food from packaging (containers, cups) and disposable tableware/cutlery. Based on the assumption and calculations presented above, the average daily intake of MNPs from food has been estimated for three dietary patterns, each providing 2000 kcal ( Table 5 230 6 9 9 6 220 6 Although the Western diet is the least favourable for human health, the low consumption of fruit, vegetables, fish, and seafood means that, in terms of MNP count, this diet performs best (36.4 × 10 6 6 Considering the number of MNPs in the diet (37.5 × 10 6 6 284 Figure 7 As mentioned earlier, an increasing number of studies are attempting to determine dietary MNP intake [ 415 It is important to be aware of the presence of MNPs in various food categories and to know how to reduce their numbers, because micro- and nanoparticles of plastics can easily penetrate the digestive tract and enter various tissues, where they can have an adverse effect on the body. 7. Impact of MNPs on Human Health As described in previous chapters, micro- and nanoplastic particles can enter the human body from the environment, mainly through ingestion of food and drink, but also by inhalation or through skin penetration. MNPs then spread throughout the body, reaching different locations depending on their size. Particles of PE, PP, PVC, PA6, PA66, PET, PS, ABS, PMMA, and many others have been detected in various human secretions, body fluids, cells, organs, and tissues [ 416 417 418 419 420 421 420 422 423 424 168 219 425 426 427 428 429 430 431 432 430 433 431 434 435 436 430 437 387 420 438 439 440 429 441 442 429 443 429 444 445 446 447 448 449 Numerous studies have demonstrated a link between a variety of diseases and MNP pollution, which is associated with their presence in tissues, cells, or organs. This is because MNPs can foster reactions and processes that may harm the human body and promote the development of various diseases and pathologies. For example, MNPs (primarily PS) have been proven to promote oxidative stress [ 450 451 452 453 454 429 455 456 457 In animals, PS microparticles of a very small size have been proven to induce a significant increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ 450 458 451 410 458 459 460 461 462 463 464 465 466 462 467 461 42 465 38 468 452 455 447 469 470 469 471 472 472 473 474 475 476 44 473 470 473 477 478 448 470 473 479 469 472 Veillonella Alistipes Faecalibacterium 480 410 It has been reported that small MNPs may modulate the microbiota–gut–brain axis and thus affect physical and mental health [ 481 481 482 483 484 483 457 466 485 486 487 488 489 490 Chronic exposure to PS nanoparticles was found to significantly increase levels of reactive oxygen species, plasma glucose, and the accumulation of hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol in mice [ 491 492 493 494 445 429 443 495 496 Microplastic particles have been found to exert a cytotoxic effect, often involving mitochondrial and lysosomal damage, as well as changes in gene expression, inhibition of the electron transport chain, oxidative stress, protein denaturation, haemolysis, and many other effects [ 148 439 497 498 468 Caenorhabditis elegans 499 500 320 345 501 MNPs may affect fertility. Lu et al. have observed that MNPs induced apoptosis of spermatogenic cells in male mice via the p53 signalling pathway [ 43 502 503 504 505 506 Bearing all this in mind, it is crucial to have knowledge of the harmful effects of MNPs and how to minimise their presence in food and beverages. Implementing this knowledge in homes and food industry enterprises could help to reduce the prevalence of diseases in the future. However, the estimated decomposition time of plastic products (from approx. 450 to 1000 years) and the rapidly increasing amount of plastic items produced in recent decades clearly indicate that the number of micro- and nanoplastics generated from them into the environment will continue to grow for many years to come. This is true regardless of the measures taken. Even if, from today onwards, no plastic ended up in water or soil and all packaging was replaced with fully biodegradable materials, people should be aware that we would still suffer the long-term consequences of exposure to MNP particles for many decades to come. Specifically, these will be related to endocrine system disruption and the resulting problems with fertility or changes in metabolism. This will result in an increasing incidence of diabetes, obesity, various cancers, and problems with conceiving and maintaining pregnancy, as well as other health issues. 8. Recommendations for Food Producers and Consumers Considering the above-mentioned sources of MNPs and activities that increase the number of particles released into the environment, as well as their subsequent entry into the food chain, food products, and human bodies, the following easy-to-implement recommendations and long-term measures are presented below. They would reduce the release of MNPs and limit human exposure to these harmful particles. (1) In agriculture and horticulture, especially with regard to soils where food crops are grown, we should strive to move away from using plastic film for mulching and sewage sludge for fertilisation. We should also avoid covering fertilisers with plastic. (2) Vegetables and fruit should be thoroughly rinsed with tap water before consumption. (3) Whenever possible, one should avoid drinking bottled water and beverages (both in glass and plastic containers), replacing them with tap water, as well as coffee and tea brewed directly in a glass or ceramic cup. Using tea bags or coffee capsules and drinking from plastic takeaway cups should be limited to exceptional situations, such as travelling. (4) For cooking, baking, and frying, cookware that is suitable for high temperatures and has an undamaged non-stick coating should be used. (5) Wherever possible, plastic kitchen accessories such as cutting boards, spatulas, beaters, spoons, funnels, strainers, whisks, various bowls, kettles, blenders, and mixers should be replaced with glass, cast iron, metal, or wooden ones. (6) Ready meals and raw ingredients should only be heated or defrosted in containers designed for use at high temperatures, such as in a microwave oven. (7) When storing food at home, glass containers are preferable to plastic boxes and bags. (8) Where possible, it is better to prepare meals yourself than to use takeaways or so-called ‘box diets’, as these generate huge amounts of single-use plastic packaging. (9) Food producers should stop wrapping individual fruits and vegetables in plastic film or foil. (10) Retail chains offering fresh goods such as fruit, vegetables, and bread should reduce self-service in these departments to limit the use of individual packaging. Where this is not possible, they should replace plastic packaging with paper or fabric alternatives. (11) As soon as possible, countries and law-making institutions should introduce a simple system of paid collection of glass and plastic packaging (e.g., vending machines or collection points), with plastic packaging being collected based on the weight of the returned items, without the need to scan each individual item. This will encourage consumers to return plastic bottles to collection points instead of throwing them away, which will increase the recovery of this packaging from the market, facilitate its transport for recycling, and reduce environmental pollution. (12) Every manufacturer, particularly those of food products, should strive to abandon plastic packaging in favour of paper or glass. If these materials do not provide adequate protection for the product, they should replace non-degradable plastic packaging with biodegradable packaging (e.g., made of polyhydroxyalkanoates or polylactic acid) as soon as possible. (13) In everyday life, people should focus on buying good-quality clothes that will last as long as possible and thus reduce the number of clothes they own. It is also recommended that dishwashers and washing machines be used efficiently. Increasing the load capacity of washing machines and dishwashers, eliminating pre-washing, and shortening the rinsing cycle are effective ways to reduce the number of MNPs released into the water. (14) We recommend air-drying clothes instead of using tumble dryers, as these release large amounts of microplastics into the air. This will also help to keep your clothes in good condition for longer and reduce your energy consumption. (15) Parents and grandparents are advised to limit the number of plastic toys their children have, replacing them with healthier wooden toys and activities that promote children’s development, such as physical activity and family games, and play. 9. Conclusions The presence of MNPs in the human body is affected by more than just the environment people live in. What is eaten is also important, as are the methods used to prepare and distribute food, the quality of the raw materials used to produce meals, and the proportions in which particular food groups are consumed throughout the day. Even if assuming that individual food groups representing successive levels of the food pyramid contain identical amounts of MNPs, regardless of the diet followed, the different dietary patterns result in different amounts of MNPs being introduced into the body. When considering the number of MNP particles introduced into the body through food alone (estimated at 36.4 × 10 6 6 6 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules30183666/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.D. and K.P.; software, A.D.; writing—original draft preparation, A.D. and K.P.; writing—review and editing, A.D. and K.P.; visualization, A.D. and K.P.
