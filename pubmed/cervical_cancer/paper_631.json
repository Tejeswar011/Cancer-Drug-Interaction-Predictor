Introduction Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious worldwide burden with enormous economic costs [ 1 1 1 2 3 4 2 5 6 7 7 8 9 10 11 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Because of the increased risk of complications in individuals with DM and comorbidities, it is essential to investigate and improve preventive care strategies tailored to individual patient profiles. Recent work has applied advanced analytic methods such as clustering and machine learning to better characterize the heterogeneity of diabetes mellitus and its comorbidities. For example, deep embedding and clustering approaches in large cohorts have revealed distinct patient subgroups with differing disease trajectories and complication risks [ 19 20 21 2. Materials and Methods In this study the data used from The Austrian Health Information Survey (AT-HIS) were obtained after a written application from Statistik Austria. AT-HIS was part of the larger European Health Information Survey (EHIS) [ 22 n 8 2 2 Outcome measures included variables related to the vaccination status and to preventive medical examination. In the AT-HIS survey the question and the available answers were as follows “Last time of blood pressure measurement by a health care professional?”, “Last time of blood cholesterol measurements of a health care professional?”, “Last time of fecal occult blood test?”, “Last time of colonoscopy?”, “Last time of mammography (breast X-ray)?”, “Last time of cervical smear?”, “Last flu vaccination”—Available answer “Within the past 12 months”, “over 12 months ago”. Further questions concerning intact immunization status (tetanus, diphtheria, Polio, FSME, pneumococcus) were dichotomous. Statistical Analysis Descriptive results were reported as frequency and percentage for categorical variables. The different cohorts were compared using a chi 2 Supplementary Table S4 p 3.

Cluster 2 Reports Worse Immunization Status—Individual Comparison of Each Cluster Moreover, each cohort was compared to all the other cohorts individually (see Supplementary Materials Tables S1–S3 3.3. Association of Preventive Care/Immunization Status and Risk Clusters Further the association of immunization status and preventive care on the characteristics of the study cohorts were investigated (see Table 2 Figure 1 4. Discussion In summary the worst intact immunization was investigated in cluster 2, which were individuals with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity grade 2. Compared to the control group, individuals with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and grade 2 obesity were less likely to have complete tetanus and diphtheria immunization. Nevertheless, the rate of preventive care usage as fecal occult blood test or colonoscopy was higher in the risk clusters compared to the control cohort. When we examined individual comorbidities, some associations were observed. The cluster differences highlight meaningful patterns and might suggest that comorbidity clusters can help identify patient subgroups with different preventive care and immunization needs, supporting a personalized medicine approach. The rate of complicated courses of infectious diseases are claimed to be higher in diabetes mellitus patients compared to individuals without diabetes mellitus [ 23 23 24 25 26 27 11 28 29 30 31 32 33 33 33 34 35 36 37 36 36 38 2 38 39 40 41 42 43 Previous work could already report that the defined risk clusters have worse diabetes mellitus outcome [ 8 8 8 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 This study has some limitations. First, it relies on self-reported data, which may introduce recall bias or result in over- or underestimation of disease prevalence, healthcare utilization, and immunization rates. Second, the data do not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although it is reasonable to assume that most cases in our cohort represent type 2 diabetes, given its substantially higher global prevalence [ 51 52 Previous studies have indicated that certain groups, such as the elderly, adolescents, and individuals with lower socioeconomic status, are less likely to respond to health surveys in Austria. This non-response can lead to underrepresentation of these populations, potentially skewing the results [ 53 5. Conclusions The novel strength of this study lies in its focus on a diabetes mellitus cohort without comorbidities, compared to various diabetes mellitus cohorts with comorbidities, across a range of immunizations and preventive medical examinations. While numerous studies have examined influenza immunization, feet and eye examinations and primary care usage of diabetes mellitus individuals, few have systematically compared various immunization rates and preventive care measures simultaneously across subgroups defined by comorbidity status. By highlighting these differences, our study provides valuable insights that can inform more nuanced and individualized care strategies. Ultimately, this research supports the development of a more personalized treatment approach that better addresses the specific preventive care needs of both the general and more vulnerable DM populations.
