However, the inflammatory response to various stimuli may inadvertently damage healthy tissues. Acute inflammation is typically a short-term reaction to tissue damage that involves increased blood flow, temperature, swelling, and pain 15 16 16 17 17 19 20 In this study, we synthesized CXE-loaded NLCs (CXE-NLCs) and evaluated their colloidal stability, bioactivity, and anti-inflammatory effects. We hypothesized that the encapsulation of hydrophobic CXE with robust NLC could improve its miscibility in aqueous solutions, colloidal stability in the gastrointestinal tract, and bioaccessibility in physiological systems. The CXE-NLC was optimized by assessing its loading efficiency, particle size, dispersity, and zeta potential. Its morphological and thermal properties were also characterized. For oral delivery, we examined the gastrointestinal stability, in vitro release profiles, and apparent permeability coefficients of the bioactive compounds. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effects were validated by evaluating the expression levels of inflammatory markers based on paw size, ELISA, and western blotting. Materials and methods Materials Glyceryl tristearate, soybean oil, Tween 80, Span 80, and curcumin (≥ 65%) were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Xanthorrhizol (≥ 99.5%) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX, USA). Heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and streptomycin were purchased from Corning (Corning, NY, USA). All remaining reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Analytical grade solvents and reagents were used in the analysis. Preparation of standardized CXE Curcuma xanthorrhiza 5 1 S1 Preparation of CXE-loaded NLCs CXE-NLCs were prepared using high-shear homogenization and ultrasonication techniques. The NLCs were formulated with fixed amounts of glyceryl tristearate (GTS) as the solid lipid, soybean oil as the liquid lipid, and Tween 80 and Span 80 as the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfactants at 600, 240, 400, and 270 mg, respectively, to synthesize 100 mL of NLC. CXE was used at concentrations of 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 g per 100 mL of NLC, resulting in final concentrations of 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0% (w/v). Briefly, the oil phase was prepared by mixing GTS, soybean oil, Tween 80, Span 80, and CXE and heating to 90 °C while stirring. Once the lipids melted, 100 mL of distilled water heated to the same temperature (water phase) was added dropwise, and the solution was stirred at 450 rpm for 10 min. This pre-emulsion was then subjected to high-shear homogenization (HZ1; LABTron Co., South Korea) at 8,000 rpm for 5 min, followed by further dispersion using a probe sonicator (UP200S; Hielscher Ultrasonics GmbH, Germany) for an additional 5 min (amplitude power: 30%; work time: 4 s; rest time: 2 s). Finally, the CXE-NLCs were gradually cooled to 25 °C to allow crystallization of the solid lipid. Blank NLCs were synthesized without CXE using the same fabrication process. Physicochemical characterization of CXE-NLCs The particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential of the CXE-NLCs and blank NLC were determined through dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) using a particle size and zeta potential analyzer (ELS-2000ZS; Otsuka Electronics Co., Osaka, Japan). In order to obtain a fourier transformation infrared (FT-IR) spectra, CXE was lyophilized with hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), and blank-NLC and CXE-NLC were also lyophilized. The FT-IR spectra of CXE-HPMC, HPMC, GTS, blank-NLC, and CXE-NLC were obtained using a VERTEX 70 FT-IR spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) in the ranges of 4,000 ~ 400 cm-1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed on the CXE, blank NLC, and CXE-NLC using a thermal analyzer (SDT Q600; TA Instruments, DE, USA). The temperature range was 25–600 °C, with a heating rate of 20 °C/min under a nitrogen gas flow of 100 mL/min. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM; JSM-7001 F; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) was used to visualize the morphology of the CXE-NLCs. The CXE-NLCs were dried overnight on a silicon wafer and observed at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-F200; JEOL, JAPAN) was used to examine the crystalline structure of the CXE-NLCs at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The samples were diluted 20-fold and loaded onto a carbon/formvar copper grid (300 mesh; Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). The particle sizes in the SEM and TEM images were measured using ImageJ software (v1.8, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). The diameters of 50 particles were measured, and the average values and standard deviations were calculated. The colloidal stability of the CXE-NLC was evaluated at 4 °C for six weeks, with its particle size, PDI, and zeta potential monitored throughout. CXE loading efficiency and capacity The encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading capacity (LC) of CXE-NLCs were determined using the ultrafiltration-centrifugation technique as previously described with slight modifications 21 g EE (%) = [(Total weight of added ingredient – Weight of unentrapped ingredient) / Total weight of added ingredient] × 100. LC (%) = [(Total weight of added ingredient – Weight of unentrapped ingredient) / (Total weight of added ingredient – Weight of unentrapped ingredient + Weight of lipid phase in the nanoparticle formulation)] × 100.

SGF and SIF were prepared as previously described (Minekus et al., 2014), with slight modifications. SGF (pH 1.2) containing pepsin (2,000 U/mL) was prepared using 0.7% (v/v) hydrochloric acid and 0.2% (w/v) sodium chloride. SIF (pH 6.8) containing pancreatin (20% w/v) and 10 mM bile salt was prepared using 0.9% (w/v) sodium hydroxide and 6.8% (w/v) monobasic potassium phosphate. Subsequently, the CXE-NLCs were incubated in SGF and SIF at 37 °C for 2 h to simulate the digestive environment. The NLC particle size was determined using DLS before and after exposure to SGF and SIF. In vitro release profile of bioactive compounds The release pattern of CXE from the CXE-NLCs under simulated digestive conditions was assessed using a dialysis membrane (MWCO, 3,500 Da; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The membranes were filled with CXE-NLCs and an enzyme-free digestive medium. To prevent leakage, both ends of the membrane were securely tied and immersed in a mixture of enzyme-free SGF and SIF containing 50% ethanol (v/v) to maintain sink conditions. The CXE-NLC-filled membranes were then incubated at 37 °C and 90 rpm sequentially in SGF for 2 h and SIF for 6 h. Samples were collected at specific intervals throughout the incubation process, and the amount of CXE released from the CXE-NLCs was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity. In vivo experiments All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Gangneung-Wonju National University (approval number: GWNU-2018-20) and were conducted in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations, including the ARRIVE guidelines ( https://arriveguidelines.org/ 2 In vivo anti-inflammation effects The mice were housed under controlled conditions and provided with a standard laboratory diet and water for two weeks before commencing the experiment. Mice were randomly divided into eight groups ( n Protein expression analysis in physiological systems Mice were anesthetized with CO 2 g 2 2 ® Statistical analysis In vitro experiments were conducted three times, and the data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Group comparisons were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Scheffe and Dunnett T3 tests, using SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 24.0; IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). For the in vivo results, ANOVA was employed, and post-hoc analysis was performed using Duncan’s multiple range test at a significance level of p Results and discussion Synthesis of CXE-loaded NLC CXE-NLCs were synthesized using a precisely controlled approach to overcome the immiscibility of CXE in the aqueous phase. The carriers were formulated with edible lipids, including GTS, soybean oil, Tween 80, and Span 80. The types and ratios of the lipid components were carefully selected to meet the encapsulation efficiency and stability requirements. Due to the lipophilic nature of CXE, liquid lipid soybean oil is favorable for encapsulating significant amounts of CXE 22 23 S1 1 1  Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the fabrication process for CXE-NLC. ( A B C D Optimization of CXE-loaded NLC The EE, LC, hydrodynamic size, and PDI of the CXE-NLC were assessed. CXE-NLCs were successfully fabricated within a CXE concentration range of 0.0–4.0%, without inhomogeneity or phase separation. The formulations were labeled as blank NLC, CXE-NLC-0.3, CXE-NLC-0.5, CXE-NLC-1.0, CXE-NLC-2.0, and CXE-NLC-4.0, corresponding to their initial CXE concentrations (Fig. 2 2 24 25 2 26 2 E The intestinal permeability of the bioactive compounds (CXE) was determined using the apparent permeability coefficient (P app 27 app − 5 − 5 2 app 28  Fig. 2 Synthesis and characterization of CXE-NLCs at different initial CXE concentrations.

Colloidal stability was determined by incubating CXE-NLCs at 4 °C for 6 weeks and monitoring the agglomeration, hydrodynamic size, PDI, and zeta potential of the particles. CXE-NLC-0.5 showed a highly stable hydrodynamic size and PDI over 6 weeks (Fig. 3 S1 3 -1 3 2 -1 29 3 3 The morphological and structural properties of CXE-NLCs were further analyzed using SEM and TEM.

The in vitro release profiles of the CXE-NLCs in SGF and SIF without enzymes were evaluated using dialysis (Fig. 4 33 34  Fig. 4 Behavior of CXE-NLC under simulated in vitro gastrointestinal conditions.

( A 2 B n p Conclusion In summary, we successfully fabricated and optimized NLC loaded with plant derived extracts as potential orally delivered nanocarriers with anti-inflammatory effects. We validated the performance of this strategy, confirming its effectiveness, not only in physicochemical terms but also in biological functionality. The CXE concentration was optimized based on particle size, zeta potential, colloidal stability, EE, LC, and P app app This approach offers several advantages. (1) CXE-NLCs demonstrated excellent nanoencapsulation efficiency and hydrocolloidal stability, while effectively loading a complex hydrophobic plant derived extract and preserving the bioactivity of its diverse bioactive compounds, such as xanthorrhizol and curcumin. (2) These lipid-based nanoparticles displayed remarkable biostability and sustained-release profiles; they were specifically tailored for oral administration, maintained structural integrity, and controlled release under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. (3) The enhanced dispersity of CXE-NLCs led to improved anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, surpassing those observed with the administration of free CXE; this was likely due to increased oral delivery to target sites. Although these findings are promising, further studies are required to better characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior and immune cell responses of the CXE-NLCs. Additionally, future studies are required to explore other biological activities associated with specific symptoms and diseases, including cancer, and to systematically optimize NLC for various delivery routes beyond oral administration. Overall, this approach holds promise as a versatile oral delivery system to enhance the biological activities of plant derived extracts, making them valuable nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals.
