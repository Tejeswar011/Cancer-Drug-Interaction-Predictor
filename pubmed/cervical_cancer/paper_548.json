Plasmonic biosensors offer a promising non-invasive approach to detecting cancer cells in their early stages. In this study, we investigate an LSPR-based biosensor employing an innovative plasmonic metamaterial composed of an eight-ring supercell array for cancer detection. The proposed structure features eight ring-shaped cubic supercells, interconnected via a soft-cell interface. Analysis focused on three widely used metals in plasmonics: aluminium, silver, and gold. The evaluation was conducted using the three-dimensional finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. Leveraging the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects of the gold nanostructure, dual resonance peaks are achieved in the inductive-capacitive (LC) mode. The designed sensor operates effectively in the near-infrared region, covering the wavelength range of 1000–2100 nm. Sensitivity and figure of merit (FOM) for the first mode are measured at 604 (nm/RIU) and 14.72 (RIU −1 −1 Keywords Cancer biomarker Plasmonic metamaterials Plasmonic biosensor Subject terms Cancer Nanoscience and technology Optics and photonics pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Limited 2025 Introduction Cancer, with more than 200 different types, is the leading cause of death in the world (more than 1500 deaths per day) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 8 3 Traditional methods of cancer diagnosis are based on morphological and microscopic changes in cancer cells, which require a biopsy to detect the cancer 9 10 11 12 13 9 14 17 18 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Plasmonic biosensors are gaining popularity due to their potential impact on early cancer detection. In case of leukemia, detection of specific biomarkers such as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNA, protein antigens etc. in blood samples is important for early detection and disease management plasmonic biosensors can detect these biomarkers are at very low levels, facilitating early intervention and personalized treatment strategies 28 29 31 These sensors rely on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), whereby conduction electrons on metal nanoparticle surfaces vibrate in resonance with incident light. The result is an amplification of the electromagnetic field at the nanoparticle level, thereby making the sensor more sensitive to detect molecular interactions, including those involving cancer biomarkers. Sharp-edged NPs such as nanostars, nanorods, and also nanocubes stand out among all other particles. These particles have sharp tips and edges that act as “hot spots” where the intensity of the local electromagnetic field is greatly increased. Plasmonic nanostructures trapping electrons in free space have characteristics that cannot be found in bulk materials 32 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 41 In recent years, various plasmonic sensor architectures have been explored to harness the advantages of LSPR in practical detection platforms. For instance, metal–insulator–metal (MIM) sensors incorporating bowtie resonators have demonstrated highly tunable responses through strong coupling effects 42 43 44 37 In this paper, we investigate plasmonic metamaterials based on an octa-square split-ring-shaped supercell for the detection of cancer biomarkers. Unlike conventional split-ring resonators or coupled nano-ring arrays reported in previous studies, the proposed geometry integrates eight interconnected square-ring units that simultaneously support LC and plasmonic resonances. This dual-mode behavior enables stronger mode hybridization and broader spectral tunability compared to earlier designs. Moreover, the sharp corners and engineered nanogaps of the structure act as efficient field concentrators, generating intense localized hot spots that amplify refractive index sensitivity by at least one order of magnitude compared to smoother nanorings. The high structural symmetry of the supercell also reduces polarization dependence, ensuring more stable sensing signals. Together, these features provide a distinct improvement in sensitivity and FOM, highlighting the novelty of our approach. The sensor is designed on a SiO₂/Au substrate and evaluated for its potential to distinguish between various cancer types through refractive index contrasts between healthy and malignant cells. Collectively, these innovations distinguish the proposed architecture from previously reported SRR and nanoring structures, establishing its novelty and potential for high-performance biosensing. Materials and methods The increasing demand for label-free cancer detection methods has driven the development of plasmonic biosensors, particularly those utilizing LSPR to detect molecular changes with high accuracy. Researchers have explored various structures and designs for LSPR-based sensors. Given the critical importance of early and accurate cancer diagnosis in today’s era, there is a growing need for novel sensor structures that yield improved and reliable results. The proposed structure is depicted in Fig. 1 1 1 i To simulate SiO 2 45 46 1 r 1 2 3 2 1  Fig. 1 ( a b c  Table 1 Optimal values ​​of the proposed structure.

Understanding the behavior of diminutive quantum-sized particles remains a challenging endeavor. Their susceptibility to weak optical scattering and intricate interactions with metal–ligand interfaces continues to engage researchers in this field. However, in the case of quantum NPs, their electron bands undergo continuous discretization, resulting in a distinct plasmon resonance compared to larger NPs. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as LSPR. One notable effect of LSPR is that, at the plasmon resonance frequency, maximum absorption is exhibited by NPs in the context of LSPR. This absorption behavior is influenced by factors such as variations in the refractive index of the surrounding medium and serves as a fundamental basis for various measurement applications. The phenomenon becomes evident in the reflected spectrum, where the spectrum shows its minimum value at the resonance frequency 47 1 48 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$S{\\text{ensitivity}}=\\frac{{({\\lambda _2} - {\\lambda _1})}}{{({n_2} - {n_1})}}[nm/RIU]$$\\end{document} In the context of this study, Δn represents the refractive index change of the sensor layer, while Δλ corresponds to the wavelength shifts resulting from this refractive index change. Within the realm of biosensors, the FOM combines the sensitivity and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the resonance. It serves as a crucial metric for evaluating the intrinsic resolving power of metasurface-based optical biosensors, and it can be mathematically defined as: 2 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$FOM=\\frac{{S{\\text{ensitivity}}}}{{FWHM}}[RI{U^{ - 1}}]$$\\end{document} The spectral sharpness of each resonance can be quantified using the quality factor (Q), which reflects the ratio of the stored energy to the energy dissipated per cycle. In optical resonators, Q is directly related to the resonance wavelength λR and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the corresponding spectral dip. The quality factor is therefore expressed as: 3 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$Q=\\frac{{{\\lambda _R}}}{{FWHM}}$$\\end{document} The limit of detection (LOD) is a key performance metric in optical biosensing that indicates the minimum detectable refractive index change (Δn), which can still be reliably distinguished from noise. In other words, it represents the smallest shift in refractive index that the sensor is capable of identifying. The LOD is therefore an essential benchmark for evaluating the sensitivity and practical applicability of optical biosensors, especially in real biological detection scenarios. It is generally defined as follows 49 4 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$LOD=\\frac{{{\\lambda _R}}}{{20SQ}}$$\\end{document} The outcomes of this sensor design were acquired through simulations conducted using Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) by Lumerical software. In these analyses, a 3D FDTD simulation was employed, with the boundary condition in the z-direction set as a perfectly matched layer (PML) and periodic in the x and y-directions. Throughout all simulations, a mesh size of 2 nm was applied around the octa-cell supercell. The plane wave light was incident from the top of the sensor in the z-direction at varying wavelengths, and the reflective spectrum from the sensor was observed and analyzed. The structure we have introduced exhibits two distinct plasmonic modes. One of these modes is referred to as LC, while the other mode corresponds to plasmon resonance, occurring at the metal-insulator interface. LC resonant modes are commonly observed in split structures, where the nano-scale gaps serve as capacitors (C) and the remaining portions act as inductors (L), akin to an LC resonant circuit. The LC mode enables exceptionally high sensitivity. The primary objective of this research is to design a novel structure featuring LC resonant behavior. In addition to enhancing sensitivity, this structure manifests narrow spectral responses across various plasmon modes, thereby improving the FOM. Results and discussions In this section, we meticulously explore the optimal design of the structural dimensions and rigorously compare the results across various modifications. Our proposed structure elegantly reveals two distinct resonance modes, which are discernible in the reflection spectra. Our primary objective within this section is to precisely identify the optimal state by conducting a comprehensive analysis of simulation results and meticulously comparing them in the two distinct states. Additionally, a detailed investigation of local fields, surface charge distribution, and current density within the structure provides valuable insights into light interaction with nano-scale structure and gaps. The specific physical properties of a resonant mode observed in the spectrum curves are intricately determined by the complex local field distribution 50  Fig. 2 Electric field distribution at ( a b c d Figure 2 2 2 2 51  Fig. 3 Surface charge distribution (C/m²) at ( a b c d Figures 3 3 3 3 3 According to previous explanations, Figs. 3 2 3 The plasmon hybridization theory provides a rigorous framework for interpreting the origin of complex resonances in coupled metallic nanostructures. Analogous to molecular orbital theory, the individual plasmons supported by isolated components (e.g., the metallic and the split gap) interact and hybridize when placed in proximity. This coupling lifts the degeneracy of the original modes and results in the formation of new bonding (symmetric) and antibonding (antisymmetric) plasmonic states 51 3 Mode-1 exhibits a dipolar surface charge distribution and nearly linear surface currents along the metallic arms, which are indicative of an antibonding plasmonic dipole mode (bright mode) that couples efficiently to the incident field and radiates strongly, as illustrated in Fig. 3 3 3 It should be noted that although the biosensor operates in a uniform aqueous medium ( n 52 53 18 20 54  Fig. 4 ( a b c As shown in Fig. 4 4 4 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 55 56  Fig. 5 ( a b  Fig. 6 Reflectance spectra for ( a c b d To ensure the convergence of the FDTD simulations, we repeated the calculations with different mesh sizes of 2, 3, and 4 nm. Figure 5 5 It is imperative to emphasize that metamaterials within plasmonic structures featuring sharp edges exhibit pronounced sensitivity to the polarization of incident light. Consequently, investigating this phenomenon is of utmost importance. To gain insights into this issue, we systematically altered the polarization of the incident light interacting with the structure. The resulting reflected spectra are presented in Fig. 6 Figure 6 6 6 6 −1 −1 −1 −1  Fig. 7 Surface charge density (C/m²) distributions of Mode-2 under ( a b To further elucidate the origin of the observed differences between TE and TM polarizations, the surface charge distributions were analyzed, as discussed below.

This sweep involves the examination of all relevant parameters and scales associated with the structure depicted in Fig. 1 1 n r g 8 The consistent ratios were maintained when adjusting parameter values, given the structure’s sharp edges and the significance of accurate meshing. Specifically, these values were scaled by a factor of 2 to ensure that the simulation’s meshing remained unchanged. The obtained results exhibit high reliability. Figure 8 8 8 n 8 45 57 r Panels (e) and (f) in Fig. 8 8 −1 −1 As previously mentioned, a redshift in the reflectance spectrum wavelength is induced by an increase in the refractive index of the cancer solution sample. To illustrate this relationship, the refractive index of the solution was systematically raised from its initial value of 1.34, incrementing it in steps of 0.07. The resulting redshift values in the reflectane spectra were then observed, as depicted in Fig. 9 9 9 Cancer represents a dangerous condition marked by uncontrolled cell proliferation that disseminates throughout the body, resulting in harm to healthy tissues and ultimately leading to mortality. Timely detection significantly impacts cancer diagnosis and patient outcomes. In this context, a refractive index-based biosensor capable of discerning different tissue cell types by analyzing variations in tissue refractive indices is proposed. Specifically, an LSPR-based sensor for detecting cancer has been developed.

This study presents a novel, high-sensitivity refractive index biosensor with dual resonance modes, engineered to detect a broad range of cancers through an innovative plasmonic metamaterial composed of an eight-ring supercell array.Initial simulations considered three metals, Al, Ag, and Au. After optimazing Au was identified as the optimal candidate for achieving peak sensitivity in FDTD analysis. The proposed plasmonic sensor was tested under both TM and TE polarizations and exhibited suitable evaluation parameters in both polarizations. With the integration of gold nanostructures in modes 1 and 2, the sensor achieved high sensitivities of 604 (nm/RIU) and 1097.1 (nm/RIU), respectively. Additionally, the figure of merit (FOM) values for these modes were measured at 14.72 (RIU −1 −1 Publisher’s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
