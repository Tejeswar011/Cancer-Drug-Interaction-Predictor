The development of this protocol was based on our finding that ECP-treated splenocytes are a powerful therapeutic tool to treat inflammatory side effects of immune checkpoint inhibition, mainly colitis, in cancer patients. ECP describes the treatment of immune cells with 8-methoxypsoralen and UVA, thereby inducing apoptosis in these cells. In our preclinical model, we have established splenocytes as immune cell pool for ECP therapy and ECP was used as a therapy to treat immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced inflammatory side effects. 1 This protocol describes the steps to investigate the phagocytic uptake of syngeneic splenocytes by antigen presenting cells (APCs) using flow cytometry. The splenocytes were treated with ECP to induce apoptosis. To understand if ECP-treated splenocytes undergo apoptosis and if these apoptotic cells are engulfed by APCs, we have co-cultured ECP-treated splenocytes with bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) or bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). We use male and female C57BL/6N (CD45.2, Janvier Labs) and CD45.1 (Charles River) mice with an age of 7–10 weeks in the following protocol. The use of CD45.2 mice for the culture of BMDMs and BMDCs and the use of CD45.1 mice for splenocyte isolation enables us to discriminate between ECP-treated cells and APCs. In addition, staining of ECP-treated splenocytes with a fluorescent dye (CellTrace Violet, CTV) helps us to understand if these splenocytes are phagocytosed by APCs upon co-culture for 48 h. Upon staining of surface markers and intracellular proteins, we could understand if the phagocytic uptake of ECP-treated splenocytes renders the APCs towards a more inflammatory or more tolerogenic phenotype. The staining of CD45.1 marks ECP-treated splenocytes, whereas CD45.2 stains BMDMs and BMDCs (phagocytes). Before surface antibody staining, the Fc receptors are blocked using a purified anti-CD16/32 antibody to prevent unspecific antibody binding. In the presented protocol, we have focused the analysis of APC differentiation mainly on BMDMs, but any surface markers for BMDCs can be included into the analysis. Moreover, the PhosFlow analysis performed in this protocol only included phosphorylation of STAT6. Alternatively, staining for any other phosphorylated proteins can be incorporated if needed for analysis. The same accounts for intracellular proteins, which only included analysis of Arginase 1 in this protocol. Phosphorylation of STAT6 and expression for Arginase 1 indicate, together with surface expression of CD206 and CD301, the polarization of macrophages towards and immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype. Further, we describe a method to investigate gene expression in single cells by flow cytometry, using the PrimeFlow method. This method can be extended to analyze more transcripts; however, a limited number of fluorophores provided by the manufacturer 2 , 3 Institutional permissions Any experiments on live vertebrates or higher invertebrates must be performed in accordance with relevant institutional and national guidelines and regulations. Animal studies were carried out in compliance with relevant animal-use guidelines and ethical regulations. The protocol was approved by the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg, Germany (Protocol approval number: X-20/06K). C57BL/6 mice (CD45.2) were purchased either from Janvier Labs (France) or obtained from the local stock of the animal facility at University Medical Center Freiburg (Germany).

The analysis of phagocytosis of ECP-treated splenocytes by APCs upon co-culture is facilitated by fluorescence staining and the use of congenic mice. Specifically, wildtype C57BL/6 mice (CD45.2) are used for the culture of BMDMs and BMDCs. Congenic CD45.1 mice are used as donors for splenocytes, which undergo ECP treatment and CellTrace Violet staining. These are then co-cultured with BMDMs or BMDCs. The staining for CD45.1 and CD45.2 can discriminate between treated cells and phagocytes. If phagocytes become fluorescently labeled after co-culture, the phagocytes did engulf ECP-treated cells. Phagocytosis and tolerogenic polarization of APCs is analyzed after 48 h of co-culture. 9. Treatment of splenocytes with Extracorporeal Photopheresis. a.

Pause point: Note: Alternatives: Figure 2 Exemplary gating strategy to analyze phagocytosis of ECP-treated splenocytes and BMDM polarization This gating strategy shows the analysis of BMDMs. The first gate includes all cells (mainly viable BMDMs); small cells and debris can be excluded. BMDMs should form a uniform population. Next, the gate is set on single cells, followed by gating on viable cells. To further purify the population, the gate is set on CD45.2 + – Adipoq Expected outcomes The successful analysis of phagocytosis should result in CellTrace Violet-stained CD45.2 + + 1 Adipoq 1 Limitations This protocol was developed to specifically understand if ECP-treated splenocytes are phagocytosed by bone marrow-derived macrophages or bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. We had used splenocytes based on our preclinical in vivo 7 , 8 In addition, we only report the use of ECP for cell death induction in this protocol, but cell death could also be induced by pre-treating the splenocytes with chemotherapy. 1 The major limitation of this protocol is the need to use the PrimeFlow Kit for the analysis of target gene expression in single cells. We and others have verified that target gene expression can be efficiently analyzed after probe hybridization. 9 , 10 manufacturer’s instructions Troubleshooting Problem 1 The purity of BMDMs or BMDCs is low after 7 days of culture/differentiation. Potential solution The protocols described here should yield >90% purity of BMDMs and BMDCs after the 7 d differentiation. It is critical that the cytokines for BMDM and BMDC generation are added freshly into the culture medium and that the cytokines are prepared according to manufacturer’s instructions. The LOT-specific instructions for cytokine reconstitutions can be downloaded after the purchase of the product. When harvesting these cells, only scrape them off the plate and do not add trypsin to the cells. Problem 2 ECP-treated splenocytes are not stained with CellTrace Violet. Potential solution Proteins quench the staining with CellTrace Violet. It is therefore crucial that the cells are washed with PBS before staining and that the staining is done in PBS w/o any addition of protein. The steps need to be followed as outlined in this protocol. To make sure that CellTrace Violet staining was successful, an aliquot of the cells can be analyzed before setting up the co-culture with APCs. Problem 3 More than 30% of splenocytes are lost during CellTrace Violet staining. Potential solution During CellTrace Violet staining, it is commonly seen to lose up to 30% of the splenocytes. If more cells are lost during the staining process, the steps need to be optimized. Higher concentrations of CellTrace Violet or incubation times longer than what is given in the protocol can cause overstaining, cell death and loss of cells. Additionally, incubation times, temperatures and centrifugation steps should not be modified to ensure successful CellTrace Violet staining with minimal loss of cells. Problem 4 No staining is observed for CD45.1, CD45.2 and Arginase 1. Potential solution All targets used for staining in this protocol are generally well established and easy to stain with commercially available antibodies. If surface markers are found negative, it should be verified that the antibodies were added into the staining mix. CD45.1 is only found on a small percentage of the cells, as it marks ECP-treated splenocytes, which undergo apoptosis within 24 h after treatment. The staining for Arginase 1 is dependent on efficient permeabilization of the cells. Make sure to stick to the times for fixation and permeabilization to ensure efficient permeabilization of the cells for intracellular staining. The products and timing described in this protocol are sufficient for Arginase 1 staining. Substitutions with other products and changes of the protocol should be critically evaluated. IL-4 treated BMDMs (M2-like) can be used to assess the Arginase 1 staining efficacy. Problem 5 No staining is observed for pSTAT6. Potential solution The staining for pSTAT6 is established as described in this protocol. Reagents for fixation or permeabilization might be substituted, but the staining efficacy needs to be critically evaluated. Make sure that you stick to the temperatures and incubation times for pSTAT6 staining as described in this protocol. Problem 6 No staining is observed for Adipoq Potential solution The analysis of Adipoq manufacturer Problem 7 Cells do not undergo cell death after treatment with ECP. Potential solution Splenocytes treated with 8-MOP and UVA, which is ECP, undergo detectable cell death within 24 h after treatment. If cells do not undergo apoptosis, verify that UVA is applied correctly to the cells. The UVA chamber should be operated in a dose-controlled mode. The UVA sensor needs to be calibrated regularly. 8-MOP should not be kept in the dark to prevent loss of efficiency.
