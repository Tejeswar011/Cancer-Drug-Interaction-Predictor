Genital ulcers are one of the main manifestations of BD and can mimic sexually transmitted infections (STIs). It can be difficult to diagnose BD, particularly in patients who have immunological comorbidities such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). This case report highlights the importance of a comprehensive diagnostic approach for atypical vaginal ulcers in NHL patients. A 31-year-old woman with a history of NHL undergoing R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy regimen was referred with complaints of painful and purulent ulcers in the perianal and vaginal areas. Physical examination showed multiple well-circumscribed ulcers with purulent exudate. Laboratory examinations ruled out STIs, and pathergy test results were positive. Based on the history, clinical findings, and supporting examination results, the patient was diagnosed with genital ulcers due to BD with secondary infection. The diagnosis of genital ulcers in BD is based on clinical criteria and positive pathergy test results, after excluding differential diagnoses such as genital herpes, warts, and syphilis. A history of NHL and chemotherapy likely influenced this patient’s clinical presentation and immune response. Although positive herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 IgG serology suggested past infection, there was no evidence of acute infection, but HSV reactivation may have been a trigger or aggravating factor in BD lesions. Management included systemic and topical antibiotics to treat secondary infection and local treatments to reduce inflammation and promote healing. This case illustrates an atypical presentation of genital ulcers due to BD in a patient with NHL undergoing chemotherapy. To make the right diagnosis and treat this patient, a thorough diagnostic process involving the patient’s history, physical examination, laboratory work, and pathology testing was necessary. behçet’s disease genital ulcers immunological comorbidities multisystem inflammatory disease non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl) pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Behçet’s disease (BD), a type of vasculitis that affects tiny to large blood vessels, is a chronic inflammatory illness that affects many body systems [ 1 Streptococcus 1 1 1 2 Genital ulcers occur in 60-90% of patients with BD, as reported in various studies [ 1 3 4 5 This case report discusses a 31-year-old patient with NHL who presented with genital ulceration resembling a sexually transmitted disease, but was later diagnosed with BD. Given atypical genital lesions, this report emphasizes the significance of a thorough diagnostic approach, particularly for patients with intricate immunological comorbidities. Case presentation A 31-year-old woman was referred from the Tulip Integrated Cancer Installation Polyclinic to the Dermatology and Venereology Polyclinic of Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, with a chief complaint of painful wounds around the anus and vagina. The patient was diagnosed with NHL in January 2025. The patient had completed four cycles of chemotherapy, with the last cycle administered on April 24, 2025. About two weeks before being sent to the hospital, the patient reported experiencing constipation, resulting in frequent straining during bowel movements, which was then followed by bleeding from the anus area, followed by the appearance of sores in the mouth area that were painful. About a week later, the complaint developed into a painful wound in the anus and vagina area, accompanied by pus discharge. The patient tried treatment with gentamicin ointment, chloramphenicol, douching with povidone-iodine solution, and topical oil, without any improvement. On the day of the hospital examination, the patient was referred to the Dermatology and Venereology Polyclinic of Dr. Sardjito Hospital from the Tulip section with complaints in the genital area that persisted. The patient had never experienced similar complaints in the past. The patient was diagnosed with NHL in January 2025. She had undergone the R-CHOP chemotherapy regimen, consisting of a combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone, given every three weeks, and had undergone four cycles. There was no history of trauma or surgery. The patient was diagnosed with BD several weeks ago at the Tulip Clinic. A history of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, or drug and food allergies was denied. The patient denied any family history of allergies, history of malignancy, or similar complaints. Regarding personal hygiene and exposure history, the patient had been washing her face and bathing with Lifebuoy®, using gentamicin ointment, chloramphenicol, wiping with povidone-iodine solution, and applying topical oil. The patient was a housewife and married. Risk factors for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) included the patient having attained menarche at the age of 13 years. The patient had her first sexual intercourse at the age of 27 with her husband without using a condom. The total number of sexual partners to date was one person, namely, the husband. The last sexual intercourse was three weeks ago with her husband, and she used a condom. Her sexual orientation was heterosexual and limited to genital contact. The patient sometimes used condoms during sexual intercourse. She denied ever drinking alcohol, using injected drugs, piercing, or using tattoos, but the patient had received a blood transfusion. The patient’s husband also admitted that he had only had sexual intercourse with the patient and had never drunk alcohol, used injected drugs, piercings, tattoos, or received blood transfusions. On a physical examination, the patient was generally in a compos mentis state, and her vital signs were within normal ranges. There was enlargement of lymph nodes in the cervical area with clear boundaries and soft and mobile consistency, and no tenderness was found on palpation. There were no active verrucous lesions in other external genital areas (Figures 1 2 Figure 1 From the perineum to the vaginal vulva, lesions are seen in the form of shallow ulcers and multiple erosions with clear boundaries, accompanied by purulent exudate. Figure 2 Multiple ulcerative lesions with distinct borders are seen, accompanied by purulent exudate. For this patient, genital ulcers needed to be further evaluated to determine the underlying etiology. Several possible differential diagnoses that needed to be considered included BD, genital herpes, chancroid ulcers, and syphilis. On laboratory examination, the HIV examination showed non-reactive results (Table 1 Treponema 3 Table 1 Blood test findings.

The HSV-2 serology examination showed positive IgG anti-HSV-2 with a titer of 40.7 and negative IgM anti-HSV-2, indicating a long-standing infection without evidence of current acute infection. Examination of the lesion smear on the ulcer in the anus and vagina area with Gram stain showed polymorphonuclear cells with positive bacterial cocci. As the patient refused to undergo a speculum insertion due to severe pain in the vaginal area, specimens from the cervix could not be taken for examination. A diagnostic skin test called the pathergy test evaluates a patient’s heightened inflammatory reaction to mild trauma, such as a needle prick. If a papule (small bump) or pustule (pimple) forms at the prick site within 24 to 48 hours, the test is considered positive. The hypersensitivity of this test makes it a minor diagnostic criterion for BD. The results of the pathergy test in this patient showed a positive reaction, marked by the formation of papules measuring more than 2 mm within 48 hours after intradermal injection using a sterile needle (Figure 4 Figure 4 The patient’s pathergy test results indicating a positive reaction, as evidenced by the development of papules larger than 2 mm 48 hours following intradermal injection with a sterile needle. Based on the anamnesis, clinical findings on physical examination, and supporting examinations, the patient was diagnosed with genital ulcers, with the most likely etiology being BD, accompanied by secondary infection. The patient received systemic treatment for seven days, which included 100 mg of doxycycline twice a day. As part of local treatment, compresses with 0.9% NaCl solution were applied for 15 minutes twice daily, followed by topical antibiotic mupirocin to the ulcer area. The patient was also educated on maintaining the cleanliness of the genital and perianal regions to support the healing process and prevent recurrent infections. Discussion BD is a chronic, multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by mucosal ulceration in the oral and genital areas, cutaneous lesions, and other systemic manifestations such as uveitis, arthritis, central nervous system involvement, gastrointestinal tract involvement, and vascular involvement [ 1 1 In this case, the patient was a 31-year-old woman with a diagnosis of NHL who underwent the R-CHOP chemotherapy regimen. The patient presented with a chief complaint of painful and purulent ulcers in the perianal and vaginal areas, which were initially suspected to be sexually transmitted infections (STIs), given the clinical presentation that resembled ulcers caused by STIs. Diagnosing genital ulcers in BD is based on patient history, clinical features, and supporting examinations. From the anamnesis, the main complaint was a persistent painful wound in the area around the anus and vulvovaginal since two weeks before the examination. The complaint did not improve after using various topical ointments and antiseptic solutions. The patient had NHL and had undergone four cycles of chemotherapy with the R-CHOP regimen. There was no history of similar complaints before, and the patient had no history of risky sexual behavior. A dermatologist’s examination showed multiple ulcers with clear boundaries, purulent exudate in the perianal and perineum region, and tenderness and edema. Supporting examinations were performed to exclude differential diagnoses, including STIs. The results of HIV and Treponema The suggested differential diagnosis was HSV-2-induced vaginal herpes, which is the most common cause of painful recurrent genital ulcers. Herpes ulcers are generally multiple vesicles that quickly turn into shallow ulcers with uneven edges, are painful, and are often accompanied by inguinal lymphadenopathy [ 6 7 However, HSV-2 serology results showed positive IgG with a titer of 40.7 and negative IgM, indicating a past infection with no evidence of current acute infection. However, given that the patient had NHL and underwent chemotherapy, the compromised immune status could have caused HSV reactivation without a detectable IgM response [ 7 7 8 Research on the pathophysiology of BD has long focused on the role of viral infections, such as HSV. Research has indicated that HSV can be found in BD patients’ vaginal sores, saliva, and peripheral blood leukocytes [ 7 8 7 8 The subsequent differential diagnosis was a chancroid ulcer. Chancroid ulcers tend to be single or few, have irregular borders, a necrotic base, bleed easily, and usually do not leave scars [ 9 9 9 Haemophilus ducreyi 9 Another proposed differential diagnosis was a syphilitic ulcer. This type of ulcer is usually solitary, has a clear border, a clean base, is painless, and is not accompanied by purulent exudate [ 10 10 10 Treponema Treponema pallidum BD has no specific test that can definitively identify it. Information from clinically confirmed BD patients and controls who exhibited at least one significant symptom of BD or a BD-like disorder was collected and submitted to an international team. This team reviewed the BD criteria to establish internationally recognized guidelines. As a result, the ICBD criteria were developed [ 11 11 2 11 Table 2 International Criteria for Behçet’s Disease (ICBD). Reproduced from Marfatia et al. [ 11 Symptom Point Ocular lesion (recurrent) 2 Oral aphtosis (recurrent) 2 Genital aphtosis (recurrent) 2 Skin lesions (recurrent) 1 Central nervous system 1 Vascular manifestations 1 Positive pathergy test 1 Behcet’s disease score of ≥4 indicates Behcet’s disease In this case, the patient had multiple painful oral ulcers (2 points), multiple painful genital ulcers (2 points), and a positive pathergy test result (1 point), with a total score of 5 points. Hence, BD was established from the assessment criteria. Although there were no skin lesions such as erythema nodosum or papulopustular eruption, the combination of two typical mucosal manifestations and a positive pathergy test was strong enough to establish the diagnosis of BD. The signs of disease show the importance of considering the variation in clinical presentation of BD, which does not always involve the entire spectrum of symptoms. BD is uncommon in the general population, which is significant. However, in immunocompromised patients, like this patient with NHL who received chemotherapy, it can happen or recur [ 5 5 5 8 Management of genital ulcers in BD focuses on relieving pain, controlling local inflammation, accelerating lesion healing, and preventing recurrence [ 12 12 12 In this case, the therapy chosen combined topical and systemic treatments. The patient was given NaCl compresses, topical mupirocin to treat possible secondary infections, and oral doxycycline. Doxycycline was chosen not only for its antibacterial effect but also because it has a mild anti-inflammatory effect that can help reduce mucosal inflammation. In addition, its good safety profile makes it a rational choice for patients with immunocompromised status after chemotherapy [ 12 Conclusions This case confirms that BD can present with atypical genital ulcers in immunocompromised patients, such as those with NHL. A combination of typical symptoms, positive pathergy tests, and exclusion of differential diagnoses confirmed the diagnosis. HSV-2 infection may have been a trigger, but it was not the primary cause. Therapy was tailored to the patient’s immune status, emphasizing control of inflammation and prevention of secondary infections.
