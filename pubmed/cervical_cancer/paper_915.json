Despite advancements in surgical techniques, cesarean section is still associated with higher maternal morbidity and mortality compared to vaginal delivery. Adverse maternal outcomes following cesarean section includes hemorrhage, infections, hysterectomy, uterine rupture, and pronged hospital stay. However, studies on maternal health outcomes following cesarean section are yet well studied in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess poor maternal health outcomes and associated factors among women who delivered by cesarean section in public hospitals of Gamo, Gofa and South Omo Zones in Southern Ethiopia. Methods and materials An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 354 women who delivered by cesarean section between March 1 and April 30, 2022, at public hospitals in the Gamo, Gofa and South Omo Zones. Participants were selected using systematic random sampling method. Data were collected though interviewer-administered questionnaires and chart reviews using Open Data Kit (ODK) tools. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with poor maternal health outcomes. A P Results The prevalence of poor maternal outcome was 19.5% [95% CI: 15.67–23.97). A hematocrit level of < 30% (AOR = 3.17; 95% CI: 1.28, 7.86), being referred from other institutions AOR = 3.00; 95% CI: 1.36, 6.62), and presence of medical illness (AOR = 2.87; 95% CI: 1.20, 6.79) were associated with increases odds of poor maternal outcomes. Moreover, delivering in primary hospitals (AOR = 5.11; 95% CI: 2.28, 11.47), having no ANC follow-up (AOR = 4.04; 95% CI: 1.42, 11.46) and undergoing surgery under general anesthesia (AOR = 5.16; 95% CI: 2.03, 12.06) were also independently associated with poor maternal health outcomes. Conclusion Magnitude of poor maternal outcomes following cesarean section in the study area was found to be high. Implementing blood loss controlling techniques during and after cesarean birth, along with adequate screening, early diagnosis, and management of non-communicable disease during antenatal care could significantly improve maternal health outcomes.

Currently Cesarean deliveries (CD) have become more common as advances in anesthetic and other procedures have improved the outcome and safety of the procedure, it has increased considerably in both developed and developing countries in recent years. Each year, an estimated 22.9 million cesarean sections are conducted worldwide, primarily to preserve the mother’s or the infant’s life [ 1 2 3 4 Despite the fact that CS is a life-saving medical technique with measures to reduce unfavorable birth outcomes, regulating various postoperative neonatal and maternal complications is difficult due to patient safety, long hospital stays, high costs, and psychological stress [ 5 6 Cesarean section is a significant surgery that has both immediate and long-term maternal and perinatal risks, despite the fact that it is a life-saving technique [ 7 5 8 9 Long-term complications of CS include pelvic adhesions, small bowel obstruction, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, chronic pain, sexual dysfunction, subfertility, urinary and fecal incontinence, and pelvic organ prolapse [ 10 11 12 In low and middle-income countries, maternal mortality is the most common cause of maternal death with postpartum hemorrhage being the most common cause after CD [ 13 14 15 16 Associating factors such as antenatal care status, severe blood loss, anesthetic route, the mother’s medical state, and others may influence maternal complications [ 17 3 15 Scaling up surgery, obstetrics, and anesthetic capacity is necessary to reduce maternal mortality to achieve Sustainable Development Goal [ 18 In Ethiopia despite of increasing rate of CS, reports about maternal health outcome of CS are limited. There is limited research on maternal health outcomes after CS in this study area, with existing studies focused on single facilities. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the maternal health outcomes and associated factors among women who delivered by Cesarean Section in public hospitals of Gamo, Gofa and South Omo Zones Southern Ethiopia, 2022. On the other hand, addressing poor maternal outcomes after cesarean delivery is a critical public health priority in Ethiopia [ 3 4 Methods and materials Study setting and period The study was conducted in three Zones of Southern Ethiopia namely; Gamo, Gofa and South Omo Zone from March 1, 2022–April 30, 2022. Gamo, Gofa and South Omo Zones are located 455, 461 and 563 km respectively from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Based on the 2017 population projection value conducted by the Central Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, the total population of Gamo-Gofa Zone is 1,901,953, of whom 981,845 women and South Omo Zone 675,333 of whom 50% were females [ 19 Study participants Women who gave birth by CS at public hospitals in Gamo, Gofa and South Omo Zones of Southern Ethiopia were considered as the source populations. The study populations comprised women who delivered by CS at the selected public hospitals within these zones during the study period. All mothers who underwent CS in the selected hospitals during the study period were included. Women who are unable to respond after cesarean delivery during study period were excluded from the study. Sample size determination and sampling procedure The minimum sample required for this study was determined for all objectives; the sample size for the first objective was calculated using a single proportion formula. Considering the following assumption: anticipated proportion of poor maternal outcome (p) was 30.1% [ 15 Sample sizes were proportionally allocated based on CS volume at each hospital: Arba Minch General Hospital (100), Jinka General Hospital ( n n n n n Data collection tool The questionnaire was initially prepared in English and translated to the Amharic language, and then translated back to English by the expert to check the consistency. Data was collected using standardized and pretested questionnaires by interviewing women and record review of mothers who underwent interviews by using checklist. The data collection tool was adapted from similar studies conducted previously [ 14 15 20 22 Data collectors and data collection procedure The data was collected by seven BSc midwives and supervised by three public health (MPH) professionals who were trained in ODK (Open Data Kit) software, methods of data collection and understood the objective of the study. Data collectors were fluent in the local languages spoken in the catchment areas. Data collection was carried out by using ODK collect android application software version 2.3 every day after round by identifying women who were to be discharged but before starting any process of discharge. The mothers were encouraged to feel freely and, confidentiality of their responses was assured and that no information was shared with anybody without the investigator. After this, women who were wishing to participate signed the written informed consent document and were interviewed in private setting. Study variables Dependent variables Poor maternal health outcome of cesarean section Independent variables Socio demographic factors Age, marital status, educational status of mother, educational status of husband, occupation of mother, religion, residence and distance of health facility. Obstetrics and medical factors Gravidity, parity, gestational age, gestation, duration of labor, obstetrics complications, medical illness, status of labor, indications for CS, status of membrane, prophylaxis antibiotics, inter pregnancy interval, onset of labor, use of parthograph, Induction/augmentation of labor, referral status, ANC follow up. Surgical factors Type of anesthesia, type of cesarean delivery, type of uterine incision, surgeon qualification and surgery time. Operational definition and measurement Poor maternal outcomes Either maternal mortality occurred or one/more intra/post-operation complications, prolonged hospital stay after CS (hospital stay lasting more than 7 days), blood transfusion, mother referred to another facility after cesarean section. On the other hand women without any maternal complications are categorized in good maternal outcome [ 20 Intra/post-operative complications Includes Hemorrhage, Infections, per partum hysterectomy, adjacent internal organ injury, admission to ICU, thromboembolic event, Amniotic fluid embolism, reoperation, wound hematoma, anesthetic complication and others [ 23 Data quality assurance Data collectors and supervisors were trained for two days to become familiar with all types of data. A pretest was done to 5% of the sample size at Karat Primary Hospital. After we conducted the pre-test, we modified language clarity of the data collection tool. To minimize bias, an interview was conducted in an area with adequate confidentiality and privacy. The supervisors checked completed questionnaires for key contents before uploading them from the Android mobile phone to the ODK toolbox server to ensure data quality. The principal investigator also checked the sent files from each data collector on a regular basis for consistency and completeness. Data process and analysis The ODK server data was downloaded as an excel file and then imported into SPSS V.25 for cleaning, variable transformation, and analysis. A descriptive analysis was done to describe the pertinent characteristics of the study participants. During the analysis, all independent variables which have a significant association in bivariate analysis with a P P p Results Socio-demographic characteristics A total of 354 women participated in this study, yielding a response rate of 99.4%. Among the participants, 273 (77.1%) were within the age group of 23–30 years, with a mean age of 26.76 years (SD ± 5.01). More than half 185(52.3%) of the respondents were urban residents and 327(92.4%) were married. One-fifth, 71(20.1%), could not read or write, and 183(51.7%) were housewives.

A preoperative hematocrit value of under 30% increase the odds of poor maternal outcome by three-fold (AOR = 3.17; 95% CI: 1.28, 7.86) as compared to participants with a hematocrit value of 30% and above. The odds of poor maternal outcome were 3 times (AOR = 3.00; 95% CI: 1.36, 6.62) higher among mothers referred from other health facilities as compared to their counterparts. In mothers who had medical illness in current pregnancy, the risk of developing poor maternal outcome is increased by 2.87 times (AOR = 2.87; 95% CI: 1.20, 6.79) than those who had no medical illness. Cesarean delivery in primary hospitals had 5.11 times (AOR = 5.11; 95% CI: 2.28, 11.47) more complications than in General hospitals. Mothers who had no ANC follow up were 4.04 times (AOR = 4.04; 95% CI: 1.42, 11.46) more likely to have poor maternal outcomes than their counterparts and odds of poor maternal outcome is increased by 5.16 times (AOR = 5.16; 95% CI: 2.03, 12.06) in mothers whose operation done under general anesthesia compared to spinal anesthesia (Table 6  Table 6 Bivariate and multivariable analyses of independent variables with poor maternal outcome of women who delivered by Cesarean Sect. 2022 ( n Variables Maternal Health Outcome COR (95%CI) AOR (95%CI) P Good N Poor N Educational status of mother No formal education 45(63.4) 26(36.6) 1 1 1 Primary school 68(78.2) 19(21.8) 0.48(0.24,0.97) 0.79(0.27,2.31) 0.675 Secondary school 87(86.1) 14(13.9) 0.28(0.13,0.58) 0.48(0.14,1.61) 0.237 Diploma and above 85(89.5) 10(10.5) 0.20(0.09,0.46) 0.46(0.12,1.70) 0.242 Residence Urban 154(83.2) 31(16.8) 1 1 1 Rural 131(77.5) 38(22.5) 1.44(0.85,2.44) 2.38(0.97,5.81) 0.056 ANC follow up Yes 270(83.3) 54(16.7) 1 1 1 No 15(50) 15(50) 5(2.30,10.83) 4.03(1.42,11.46)  0.009 * Gestational Age Term 248(81.6) 56(18.4) 1 1 1 Preterm 16(64) 9(36) 1.11(1.04,5.92) 1.22(0.34,4.33) 0.759 Post term 21(84) 4(16) 0.84(0.28,2.55) 0.56(0.10,3.10) 0.512 Medical illness occurred during current pregnancy Yes 30(60) 20(40) 3.46(1.82,6.60) 2.87(1.21,6.79)  0.017 * No 255(83.9) 49(16.1) 1 1 1 Obstetrics complications occurred during current pregnancy Yes 71(72.4) 27(27.6) 1.94(1.11,3.37) 1.23(0.54,2.80) 0.625 No 214(83.6) 42(16.4) 1 1 1 Type of facility Primary 85(68) 40(32) 3.24(0.93,2.77) 5.11(2.28,11.47)  < 0.001 * General 200(87.3) 29(12.7) 1 1 1 Referral status Yes 111(69.4) 49(30.6) 3.84(2.17,6.80) 3.00(1.36,6.62)  0.007 * No 174(89.7) 20(10.3) 1 1 1 Prophylaxis antibiotic Given 273(80.8) 65(19.2) 1 1 1 Not given 12(75) 4(25) 1.40(0.44,4.48) 2.51(0.60,10.41) 0.204 Status of labor Induced 20(62.5) 12(37.5) 4.45(1.60,9.48) 2.33(0.58,9.46) 0.234 Spontaneous 161(79.7) 41(20.3) 1.65(0.88,3.10) 1.94(0.33,2.71) 0.776 Not in labor 104(86.7) 16(13.3) 1 1 1 Parity Primiparous 98(84.5) 18(15.5) 1 1 1 Multiparous 151(42.7) 33(9.3) 2.72(0.58,2.06) 1.13(0.49,2.61) 0.767 Grand multiparous 36(66.7) 18(33.3) 3.67(1.72,7.81) 1.90(0.62,5.74) 0.258 Number of gestation Singleton 272(81.9) 60(18.1) 1 1 1 Twin 13(59) 9(41) 3.14(1.28,7.68) 2.95(0.80,10.88) 0.104 Duration of membrane ruptured Intact 128(83.7) 25(16.3) 1 1 1 < 4 h 39(86.7) 6(13.3) 0.79(0.30,2.06) 0.96(0.28,3.26) 0.952 4–12 h 96(80) 24(20) 1.28(0.69,2.38) 2.62(0.60,11.36) 0.199 > 12 h 22(61.1) 14(38.9) 3.26(1.47,7.21) 1.12(0.31,4.04) 0.859 Preoperative hct level < 30% 28(52.8) 25(47.2) 5.21(2.78,9.76 3.17(1.28,7.86)  0.013 * >=30% 257(85.4) 44(14.6) 1 1 1 Type of CS done Emergency 212(77.1) 63(22.9) 3.61(1.5,8.70) 1.94(0.52,7.29) 0.324 Elective 73(92.4) 6(7.6) 1 1 1 Type of anesthesia given Spinal 254(84.4) 47(15.6) 1 1 1 General 31(58.5) 22(41.5) 3.83(2.04,7.19) 5.16(2.04,12.06)  0.001 * AOR CI COR P Discussion In this study, the overall poor maternal outcome was 19.5% with 95% CI (15.67%−23.97%). This is consistent with the study done in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia, (19.3%) [ 14 24 25 26 Our study result was also higher than studies conducted in Sokoto, North Western Nigeria(13.3%) [ 27 28 26 However, this finding is much lower than findings in Southern Ethiopia, Arba Minch (38.2%) [ 23 15 29 17 30 The most common poor maternal outcomes found after CD in this study was intra/postoperative complication (hemorrhage-10.2%, surgical site infection, uterine atony, re-operation, hysterectomy, ICU admission and others), post-operative blood transfusion, 10.2% with 95% CI (7.41%−13.8%) and prolonged hospital stay, 7.9% with 95% CI (5.51%−11.23%). The observed prevalence of hemorrhage aligns with findings from studies in Turkey (8.4%) [ 30 31 14 15 17 This study showed that mothers with a medical illness during pregnancy had a threefold increased risk of poor maternal outcomes. This finding is consistent with studies conducted in East Gojam [ 32 33 34 35 In the current study, mothers who had no ANC follow up were 4 times more likely to have poor maternal outcomes than their counterparts. This is in line with studies done in Ayder specialized Hospital [ 20 15 36 The study also showed that the odds of poor maternal outcome is increased by 3 times in those who are referred from health centers and other hospitals. This is similar with the studies in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia [ 14 15 This study revealed that in mothers whose preoperative hematocrit level below 30% were 3 times more likely to have poor maternal outcome than their counterparts. This result is congruent with study done in East Gojam [ 32 37 38 In this study, it was observed that mothers for whom operations were done under general anesthesia were 4.6 times more likely to have poor maternal outcome compared to mothers for whom operations were done under spinal anesthesia. This finding is also in line with a study done in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia [ 14 15 39 The result of this study further revealed that CD in primary hospital had five-fold more complications than in General hospitals. However, other studies conducted in a single facility. This is due to variation in the level of facility and human resource, material supply, case flow, the clinician technical skill and quality of standardized care differences between primary and general hospitals. This indicates most of primary hospitals were not well-equipped to provide the services. The clinical importance could be minimizing secondary complications, saving lives and baseline for other studies. Conclusion and recommendations The magnitude of poor maternal outcome following CS at the study area was high. This study identified that mothers referred from other health facility, those mothers who did not follow ANC for the recent pregnancy, those mothers who had medical illness in current pregnancy, mothers who gave CS birth in Primary Hospitals and use of general anesthesia during the procedure as important factors of poor maternal outcome in which health interventions should target them. Regional and zonal health administrations should equip primary health care facilities and provide on-the-job training in Basic Emergency obstetrics and Newborn Care (BEmONC) in order to provide qualified obstetrics care, improve CS services. Health care providers including community health workers should educate reproductive-age women about the benefits of early initiation of ANC follow-up. Strengthening Antenatal Care and risk assessment, optimizing surgical procedures and postoperative care, early referral and proper way of monitoring labor by using partograph will satisfy concerns for maternal health safety. Further mixed-method research is needed to better understand the specific factors contributing to poor outcomes and to inform targeted interventions.
