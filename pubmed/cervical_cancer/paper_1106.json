The biogenic amine 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), derived from tryptophan (Trp), has been reported to promote tumor growth, but its role in NSCLC metastasis has not been fully elucitated. In this study, fecal metabolomic profiling revealed significant enrichment of Trp metabolism and serotonergic synapse pathways in patients with NSCLC metastasis. Notably, the levels of 5-HT in peripheral blood showed a positive correlation with fecal Trp concentrations in NSCLC patients. Functional experiments demonstrated that 5-HT promoted NSCLC cell migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastasis by inhibiting the expression of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide G (SNRPG). RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) further identified cyclin-dependent kinase 14 (CDK14) as a critical downstream target of SNRPG. SNRPG downregulated CDK14 expression, thereby restraining malignant phenotypes in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, SNRPG negatively regulated the protein levels of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) by directly binding to it. Loss of SNRPG led to WT1 accumulation, which in turn bound to the CDK14 promoter and activated transcription, ultimately driving NSCLC metastasis. These findings collectively suggest that the 5-HT/SNRPG/WT1/CDK14 axis plays a pivotal role in promoting NSCLC metastasis and highlight 5-HT and SNRPG as potential therapeutic targets for NSCLC metastasis.

Mechanistically, 5-HT inhibited SNRPG expression, thereby deregulating the negative regulation of SNRPG on WT1 protein. Subsequently, accumulated WT1 transcriptionally activated CDK14, mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This cascade promoted NSCLC cell migration and invasion, thereby enhancing metastasis. These findings highlight the critical role of the 5-HT/SNRPG axis in NSCLC metastasis and suggest its potential as a prognostic biomarker for patients with NSCLC. Results Patients with NSCLC exhibiting high expression of 5-HT have a poor prognosis Fecal specimens from NSCLC patients were divided into two groups: the metastatic group (M group; n = 11) and the non-metastatic group (N group; n = 21). Untargeted metabolomic profiling using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight (LC-QTOF) identified 991 metabolites across both positive and negative ionization modes. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) effectively distinguished the M and N groups, revealing significant metabolic differences (R 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 Lactobacillaceae Bacteroidaceae Lachnospiraceae Enterobacteriaceae 18 19 20 25 Fig. 1 Patients with NSCLC exhibiting high expression of 5-HT have a poor prognosis. ( a b c d e f g h i P To further explore the role of 5-HT in NSCLC, peripheral blood serum samples from 96 patients with NSCLC and 56 healthy individuals were assessed using ELISA. Peripheral blood 5-HT levels were significantly higher in patients with NSCLC than in healthy individuals ( P 1 P P P 1 P 1 5-HT promotes migration and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro H1299 cells were treated with varying concentrations and time gradients of 5-HT. The proliferative effect was found to be both time- and dose-dependent, peaking at 72 h and 20 μM (Fig. S2). Although supra-physiological, this concentration was selected based on optimal in vitro responses and previous studies on 5-HT, allowing for the observation of cellular reactions that may occur under pathological conditions or in microenvironments with elevated local 5-HT concentrations. Migration and invasion assays were conducted after treating H1299 and A549 cells with 5-HT to explore its potential in promoting NSCLC metastasis. The results revealed a morphological transition in cells treated with 5-HT, from polygonal or cobblestone-like shapes to elongated spindle-shaped or fusiform forms compared to the PBS group (Fig. 2 vitro 2 2 Fig. 2. 5-HT promotes migration and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro. ( a b c b c d e d e P 5-HT promotes migration and invasion of NSCLC cells by downregulating SNRPG RNA-seq analysis of 5-HT-treated H1299 cells identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) potentially mediating migration and invasion in NSCLC cells (Table S2). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted spliceosome pathways as significant (Fig. 3 3 via 3 3 3 3 3 Fig. 3. 5-HT promotes migration and invasion of NSCLC cells by downregulating SNRPG. ( a b c d e f g f g h i P P Additionally, Western blot analysis showed that 20 μM 5-HT treatment for 72 h suppressed SNRPG expression and promoted EMT in BEAS-2B cells, a normal lung epithelial cell line. Silencing SNRPG in BEAS-2B cells also promoted the EMT process (Fig. S3i). These results suggest that the 5-HT/SNRPG regulatory axis influences the epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity of both normal lung epithelial cells and NSCLC cells, providing insights into the early molecular events in NSCLC progression. 5-HT promotes NSCLC metastasis by downregulating SNRPG in vivo To evaluate the in vivo effects of altering SNRPG expression and modulating 5-HT levels, a stable SNRPG overexpression cell line was established in H1299-Luc cells (Fig. S4a). A mouse lung metastasis model was then created by intravenously injecting H1299 cells (NC) and H1299 cells overexpressing SNRPG (SNRPG_OE). After establishing xenograft mouse lung metastases, the mice were administered intraperitoneal injections of PBS or 5-HT every other day for a total of 10 injections and were monitored in real-time using in vivo imaging. After euthanasia, lung and liver tissues were harvested (Fig. 4 4 4 4 4 4 . Fig. 4. 5-HT promotes NSCLC metastasis by downregulating SNRPG in vivo. ( a b c d P P SNRPG inhibits NSCLC metastasis by downregulating CDK14 The mechanism by which SNRPG inhibits NSCLC metastasis was further explored. RNA-seq analysis of H1299 cells with SNRPG silencing identified key downstream effectors. Comparative analysis revealed significant transcriptional misregulation in cancer-related pathways (Fig. 5 26 5 5 5 5 Fig. 5 SNRPG inhibits NSCLC metastasis by downregulating CDK14. ( a b c d e f e f g h i j P P P Rescue experiments confirmed that SNRPG inhibits NSCLC cell migration and invasion through CDK14 downregulation. Co-silencing SNRPG and CDK14 significantly reduced migration and invasion compared to the siSNRPG group (Figs. 5 5 5 SNRPG negatively regulates WT1 to suppress CDK14 transcription and inhibits NSCLC cell migration and invasion To elucidate the mechanism by which SNRPG regulates CDK14 expression, Co-IP was performed in A549 cells, but no direct interaction between SNRPG and CDK14 was detected (Fig. S6a), implying that SNRPG may affect the function of CDK14 through indirect regulation. The CDK14 promoter sequence was retrieved from the UCSC database, and potential transcription factors were predicted using the PROMO and JASPAR databases ( http://jaspar.genereg.net/ 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 Fig. 6 SNRPG negatively regulates WT1 to suppress CDK14 transcription and inhibits NSCLC cell migration and invasion. ( a b c d e f g h i j k l P P These findings indicate that SNRPG negatively regulates the protein level of WT1 through directly binding to WT1, thereby weakening the transcriptional activation effect on the CDK14 promoter, and ultimately inhibiting the migration, invasion, EMT and metastasis of NSCLC cells. These results reveal the regulatory mechanism of the SNRPG/WT1/CDK14 axis in NSCLC metastasis, highlighting the value as potential therapeutic targets in NSCLC. Discussion Approximately 90% of deaths in patients with NSCLC result from tumor metastasis worldwide [ 27 28 29 30 Clostridium ramosum 31 −/− 32 −/− +/- 33 5-HT is linked to tumor initiation, progression, and prognosis. It serves as a sensitive marker for liver metastasis in colorectal cancer [ 34 via 35 via 36 37 38 However, a key limitation of this study is the inability to establish causality between elevated 5-HT levels and NSCLC metastasis. While elevated 5-HT levels were observed in metastatic patients, the cross-sectional design cannot confirm whether these levels precede metastasis or result from it. Future prospective longitudinal studies tracking 5-HT levels from diagnosis through disease progression are needed to clarify this relationship. Interventional studies targeting the 5-HT pathway could provide further evidence of causality. Additionally, the small sample size limits the statistical power, and larger, more homogeneous cohorts are required to confirm these findings and explore the role of peripheral 5-HT in cancer progression. To elucidate the downstream regulatory mechanism through which 5-HT promotes NSCLC metastasis, RNA-seq was performed on NSCLC cells exposed to 5-HT, implicating SNRPG as a potential effector. Located on chromosome 2p13.3, SNRPG is a core component of uridine-rich snRNP complexes, serving as a precursor to spliceosomes [ 16 39 16 40 41 To clarify the mechanism by which SNRPG inhibits the metastasis of NSCLC, we conducted RNA-seq analysis on SNRPG knockdown cells. Integrating KEGG pathway enrichment with experimental verification, we identified CDK14 as a key target. CDK14, also known as PFTK1, is a member of the cell division cycle 2-related protein kinase family and plays a pivotal role in regulating the cell cycle during proliferation [ 42 26 43 26 Based on the screening of transcription factors and functional validation, our study revealed that WT1 was the core transcription factor by which SNRPG regulated the expression of CDK14. WT1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that is upregulated in various tumors, including lung cancer [ 44 47 48 49 50 52 This study has several limitations. Our in vivo experiments only used the SNRPG overexpression model and lacked knockdown model validation. Future research should include stable knockdown or knockout of SNRPG in animal models to confirm the anti-cancer function and therapeutic potential. Additionally, the absence of comparisons with other cancers or non-cancer diseases limits our ability to determine whether elevated fecal Trp and peripheral blood 5-HT were specific biomarkers for NSCLC metastasis. Future studies should include diverse patient cohorts across different cancer types and stages, as well as individuals with inflammatory or metabolic disorders, to assess the specificity and sensitivity of these potential biomarkers. While correlations between fecal Trp, peripheral blood 5-HT, and NSCLC metastasis are observed, further experiments, including fecal microbiota transplantation or metagenomic analysis, are needed to directly identify that gut microbiota promotes 5-HT production via In conclusion, we demonstrate that gut microbiota may regulate 5-HT biosynthesis through Trp metabolism. Elevated 5-HT significantly inhibits the expression of SNRPG and deregulates its negative regulation of WT1 protein. Accumulated WT1 transcriptionally activates CDK14, driving the EMT process and accelerating NSCLC metastasis (Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Illustration of the potential mechanisms by which 5-HT induces NSCLC metastasis. In NSCLC patients, gut microbiota may promote Trp metabolism to generate 5-HT. 5-HT suppresses SNRPG expression, thereby releasing the inhibition of WT1 protein. Subsequent WT1 activation stimulates CDK14 transcription, promoting EMT, and enhances metastatic capabilities of NSCLC cells—including migration, invasion, and distant dissemination Materials and methods Patients Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University (No. 2023–132). A total of 152 participants were enrolled from December 2022 to May 2023, comprising 56 healthy individuals and 96 patients with NSCLC. Metabolomics analysis was conducted on 32 patients with NSCLC, while ELISA testing was performed on all participants. Demographic data and criteria are provided in Tables S4, S5, and Supplementary materials and methods. Fecal and blood sample collection from cancer individuals Fecal and blood samples were collected prior to the first treatment. Stool samples were preserved in 2-ml cryovials, transported in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C. Blood samples were drawn into centrifuge tubes, allowed to clot and separate at 37 °C for 1 h, and then subjected to two rounds of centrifugation at 3000 rpm and 12,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The resulting supernatant was collected as serum and stored at − 80 °C. Untargeted metabolomic profiling This work was supported by Biomarker Technologies (Beijing, China). High-resolution mass spectrometry was performed using the Waters Xevo G2-XS QTOF mass spectrometer, which collects both primary and secondary mass spectrometry data in MSe mode under the control of MassLynx V4.2 acquisition software. In each data acquisition cycle, dual-channel data were collected at low and high collision energies simultaneously. The low collision energy was set to 2 V, and the high collision energy range was 10–40 V, with a scanning frequency of 0.2 s per mass spectrum. The ESI ion source parameters were as follows: Capillary voltage: 2000 V (positive ion mode) or −1500 V (negative ion mode); cone voltage: 30 V; ion source temperature: 150 °C; desolvent gas temperature: 500 °C; backflush gas flow rate: 50 L/h; desolventizing gas flow rate: 800 L/h. Detailed experimental procedures are provided in Supplementary materials and methods. RNA sequencing analysis This work was supported by Biomarker Technologies (Beijing, China). Total RNA from cell samples was extracted using the TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, California, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and purity were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). RNA integrity was evaluated with the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Sequencing libraries were constructed using the Hieff NGS Ultima Dual-mode mRNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Yeasen Biotechnology, Shanghai, China), in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Index codes were added to attribute sequences to specific samples. PCR amplification was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, universal PCR primers, and index (X) primers. Following PCR, products were purified using the AMPure XP system, and library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq6000 platform (PE150 sequencing platform, Origin of San Diego), generating 150 bp paired-end reads as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Raw reads were processed using a bioinformatics pipeline tool on the BMKCloud online platform ( www.biocloud.net Lentivirus expressing transduction NC and SNRPG overexpression lentiviral vectors (SNRPG_OE) were purchased from Genechem (Shanghai, China). The lentiviral generation system employed a second-generation approach, with a plasmid to packaging vector to envelope ratio of 30:16:12, as specified by the manufacturer. The 293T cell Line was used as the interim cell Line. Lentiviral particle collection details can be found in Supplementary materials and methods. The viral titer was 2× 10 9 Animal experiments Female NYG mice (4–6 weeks old) were purchased from Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Liaoning, China), with an average initial body weight of 20.3 ± 2.5 g. The mice were housed in a barrier system and fed irradiated purified feed. They were randomly divided into four groups: NC + PBS, NC + 5-HT, SNRPG_OE + PBS, and SNRPG_OE + 5-HT, with 5 mice per group. A mouse lung metastasis model was established via 4 via 53 AEE23068 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Paraffin sections (3 μm thick) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated in a 3% H 2 2 54 Luciferase reporter assay 293T, A549, and H1299 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with pGL4-basic (empty vector), pGL4-CDK14 (WT1-binding wild-type CDK14 promoter), or pGL4-mCDK14 (mutant promoter), along with the phRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid as an internal control. After 48 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were analyzed for both Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities, and the data were normalized to Firefly/Renilla relative light unit (RLU) ratios. Three biological replicates were performed to assess the WT1-mediated transcriptional regulation of CDK14. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Cells were harvested and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (v/v) at room temperature for 10 min. Following cross-linking, the cells were resuspended in cell lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and centrifuged to remove the supernatant and isolate the nuclei. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 10 min. Chromatin was sheared by sonication into fragments, and fragment size was verified by electrophoresis using a small aliquot of the sample. The sonicated lysate was centrifuged (4 °C, 12,000 g, 10 min), and the supernatant was collected and diluted tenfold with ChIP dilution buffer. A portion of the sample was reserved as the \"Input\" control. Target protein-specific antibodies were added, and incubation was carried out with rotation at 4 °C overnight (isotype IgG served as an NC). Pre-equilibrated protein G-agarose beads were added, and incubation was continued for an additional hour at 4 °C. The antibody-protein-DNA complexes were then eluted from the beads. Proteinase K was added to both the bead-bound complexes and Input samples, and the mixtures were incubated at 65 °C for 2 h. Finally, DNA was purified using a DNA purification kit.
