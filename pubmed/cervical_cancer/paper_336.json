As these tissues are not often easily accessible, we sought to determine whether the presence of stem-like T cells in peripheral blood, early in an immunotherapy regimen, may help define patients more likely to derive clinical benefit. We found that PDS01ADC, a tumor-targeting IL-12 immunocytokine, increases T-cell stemness in peripheral blood of patients with advanced solid tumors, as assessed by frequencies of stem cell–like memory T cells and by T-cell factor 1 expression on T-cell states, with greater increases correlating with disease stabilization. Thus, we show for the first time that peripheral T-cell stemness can be induced by an immunocytokine therapy in humans. These data can inform rational immunotherapeutic strategies to capitalize on this burst of T-cell stemness to improve antitumor immunity. Introduction The use of cytokines for the immunotherapy of solid tumors is an active area of research. Novel strategies to improve the antitumor abilities and reduce toxicities of cytokines include development of immunocytokines, which consist of fusing a cytokine with mAbs or antibody fragments targeting tumor entities ( 1 2 3 11 + 5 11 12 PDS01ADC as a monotherapy was evaluated in a phase I clinical trial of patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid tumors who had received prior anticancer therapies ( NCT01417546 13 14 13 14 T stem cell–like memory (T SCM 15 SCM 16 Tcf7 17 19 + 20 + 21 SCM 22 24 + Tcf7 + + 25 26 SCM 16 27 29 IL-12 has been implicated in hematopoiesis and immune cell stemness in the bone marrow (BM); however, its effects on T-cell stemness have not been evaluated ( 30 32 + + 33 34 9 11 34 35 + in vitro 36 37 E omes + 38 + Tcf7 39 Based on these studies, we explored whether PDS01ADC could affect stem-like memory features in T cells.

We then pivoted to the translational setting, where we evaluated frequencies of T SCM Materials and Methods Non–tumor-bearing murine studies C57BL/6 (RRID: MGI:2159769) and BALB/C (RRID: MGI:2161072) female mice, ages 2 to 4 months, were acquired from the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. Mice were co-housed under specific pathogen–free conditions and a 12 hour:12 hour light/dark cycle, in rooms at 72°F ± 2°F and 30% to 70% relative humidity, in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care–accredited animal facility of the NIH. These studies were reviewed and approved by the NIH Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were randomized and treated with 2 µg NHS-muIL12 subcutaneously or PBS ipsilaterally on alternate days for a total of three doses. Four days after the final dose, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and spleens and BM harvested. NHS-muIL12 dose and schedule were developed based on prior work demonstrating clearance of NHS-muIL12 within target tissues by 72 hours and evidence of infiltration of CD8 + 4 11 Murine tumor studies The TC-1 lung cell line, which expresses the E6 and E7 oncoproteins of human papillomavirus 16, was a kind gift from Dr. T.C.

A mitochondrial cutoff of up to 25% was set, and cell annotations were determined through expression of key genes as previously described ( 12 11 Patients and sample collection From the phase I, open label, dose-escalation trial of PDS01ADC ( NCT01417546 Table 1 NCT00001846 Table 1.

Immunophenotyping of patient PBMCs A multicolor flow cytometry panel including antibodies for CD3, CD4, CD8, CCR7, CD45RA, CD45RO, CD27, CD28, CD127, CD95, CD122, and intracellular TCF1 was developed ( 16 Data and statistical analyses Statistical testing and data visualizations were performed using R (R Core Team, 2022) with RStudio (v4.2.2, RRID: SCR_000432), GraphPad Prism v10.0 (GraphPad Software, RRID: SCR_002798), FlowJo V10.8.2, and OMIQ. Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank tests were used to compare paired data, and Mann–Whitney tests were used to compare patient differences between two groups. Spearman rank tests were used to assess correlations between two continuous variables. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed following standard protocols to assess the effect of prior treatments on cell frequencies in patients prior to treatment with PDS01ADC. Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection was used for dimensionality reduction of flow cytometric data. All statistical tests were two-tailed without multiple testing correction, and P Data availability Data will be made available upon reasonable request. scRNA-seq data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database ( GSE295238 Results Increases in peripheral T-cell stem cell antigen 1 expression and CD8 + SCM Effects of NHS-muIL12 on peripheral T-cell stemness were first evaluated in two non–tumor-bearing mouse strains by assessing stem cell antigen 1 (SCA1) expression on splenic T cells after treatment.

TC-1 tumors treated with NHS-muIL12 or PBS control were evaluated for the expression of several key genes in T-cell self-renewal and stemness through scRNA-seq of pooled tumors from each condition.

Although prior work has demonstrated the importance of T-cell stemness in studies of immune checkpoint inhibition and adoptive cell transfer, the present study demonstrates that increases in T-cell stemness can also occur with cytokine therapies, a finding that may be crucial in developing rational immunotherapeutic combinations.
