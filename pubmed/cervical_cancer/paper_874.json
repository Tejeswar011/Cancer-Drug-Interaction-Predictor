We previously demonstrated similar counterintuitive effects for the GPX4 system in highly ferroptosis-sensitive tissues, such as the adrenals 40 A limitation of our study relates to our tubule-isolation protocol, which is performed using an ex vivo model. However, cell death propagation was recently detected directly by longitudinal intravital imaging after IRI 41 42 Methods Reagents Chemicals used for cell death assays were dissolved in DMSO. 17β-oestradiol, testosterone and 2-hydroxyoestradiol were dissolved in ethanol.

Cells were then washed twice and seeded in six-well plates (Sarstedt, 83.3920). All cells were seeded at 1 × 10 5 Cell death assays Ferroptosis was induced using established FINs: type I FIN, erastin (Sigma-Aldrich); type II FIN, RSL3 (Selleckchem); type III FIN, FIN56 (Sigma-Aldrich); and type IV FIN, FINO2 (Cayman Chemical). Necrosis was additionally induced as previously described by the thioredoxin reductase inhibitor FTC 30 2 Flow cytometry Cells were collected and the pellets were washed twice in PBS and stained with 5 μl of 7-AAD (BD Biosciences) and 5 μl of annexin-V–FITC (BD Biosciences) added to 100 μl annexin-V binding buffer solution (BD Biosciences). After 15 min, cells were recorded either on the Fortessa LSRII system with the FACS Diva 6.1.1 software (BD Biosciences), or on the Symphony A3 system with the FAVS Diva v9.0 software (BD Biosciences) and subsequently analysed with the FlowJo v.10 software (Tree Star). The flow cytometry procedure was supported by the Flow Cytometry Core Facility of the CMCB Technology Platform at Technical University of Dresden (TU Dresden) and the FACS Facility of the Institute for Physiological Chemistry (TU Dresden). Western blotting Cells were lysed in ice-cold 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA supplemented with PhosSTOP (Merck), cOmplete (Merck) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min on ice. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (14,000 g Western blot analysis of renal tubules For western blot analysis of kidney tubules, freshly isolated tubules are transferred into a 2 ml reaction tube. Depending on the pellet size, an approximate volume of 7 to 30 μl of Roti Load 1 (Roth, K929.1) is added, mixed thoroughly and subsequently snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were then either stored at −80 °C or used directly for the western blot analysis. It is essential to assess the protein loading equivalency, as a classical Bradford assay cannot be conducted. Between 3 and 7 μl of tubules, contingent on the quantity, was loaded onto the gel. Next, Ponceau staining was performed to evaluate the uniformity of protein loading. If the staining results were consistent, the protocol proceeded as previously outlined for cell samples. Isolation of primary mouse renal tubules Primary mouse renal tubules were isolated strictly following a recently published protocol 43 −1 −1 −1 2 4 2 4 2 4 2 3 2 a −1 −1 −1 −1 2 3 −1 −1 −1 Investigation of pig kidney tissue Six-month-old INSC94Y ( n 44 n n Primary porcine renal tubules were isolated using an identical procedure along with the corresponding solutions and media to those described for mouse tubules. Owing to the larger size of the porcine kidney, multiple 2 ml reaction tubes were used during the isolation process. Human renal tubules Human renal tissue for the isolation of renal tubules was obtained from fresh tumour nephrectomy specimens at the University Hospital Dresden. Informed consent was obtained from all patients; ethical approval was granted through the uro-oncological biobanking agreement. All aspects of the declaration of Helsinki were met. After open nephrectomy, tissue was immediately obtained from a non-tumour-infiltrated area. Appropriate sections of the kidney medulla, lacking tumour tissue, were excised from the kidneys by medical professionals. The sections were stored in 50 ml reaction tubes in PBS until they could be sliced into thin sections in the laboratory, following the same protocol used for mouse and porcine tubules. Owing to the size of the sections, up to ten 2 ml tubes were used. The remainder of the protocol was consistent with that used for the isolation of porcine and murine tubules; however, the incubation times for digestion and precipitation were extended to 10 min due to the higher density of human tissue composition, which complicates the sectioning process. Approval for use of nephrectomy samples was granted by the ethics commission of the TU Dresden (EK194092004). Informed consent for use of extant tissue for research purposes was obtained before biopsy. Refusal did not affect clinical care. Investigators were strictly blinded to experimental groups during data acquisition and analysis. Human renal biopsies For the set of human renal biopsies used in this study, we identified samples of patients who underwent renal indication biopsy for mild-to-medium chronic kidney disease of uncertain aetiology at the University Hospital Dresden from 2022 to 2025 that demonstrated minimal chronic tubular injury due to IgA nephritis. Importantly, no other significant comorbidities were present in these patients except for well-controlled hypertension in some cases. The mean ages of the patients were as follows: male (30.25 years), premenopausal female (32.0 years) and postmenopausal female (62.0 years). Fresh biopsy materials were fixed in 4% normal buffered formalin for at least 24 h before embedding in paraffine. After deparaffinization with xylene and rehydration with graded ethanols, unspecific binding was blocked with 3% BSA in PBS and background sniper (50-823-84, Biocare Medical). Subsequently, the primary antibody was incubated at a concentration of 1:5,000 for AGPS (ab236621, Abcam) followed by anti-rabbit secondary antibody (7074S, Cell Signaling). Bound antibody was visualized with a standard polymer horseradish peroxidase system and counterstained with haematoxylin. Stained sections were analysed using the Axio Imager microscope (Zeiss) or Zeiss Observer Z.1 at ×100, ×200 and ×400 magnification. Micrographs were digitalized using an AxioCam MRm Rev. 3 FireWire camera and AxioVision v.4.5 software (Zeiss), or using an AxioCam MRc and Zen 2012 Software (Zeiss), respectively. Semiquantative scoring of the immunohistochemistry staining intensity (ranging from 0 to 3) in the brush border compartment of proximal tubules was performed by an experienced nephropathologist in a strictly double-blinded manner. Approval for use of human renal biopsies was granted by the ethics commission of the TU Dresden (EK 148052012 and BOK-EK-431102023). Informed consent for use of extant tissue for research purposes was obtained before biopsy. Refusal did not affect clinical care. Investigators were strictly blinded to experimental groups during data acquisition and analysis. Human renal gene expression data We explored the MetMap500 database through the DepMap portal 45 https://depmap.org/metmap/vis-app/index.html + − + − − − 37 To compare gene expression data in healthy individuals and patients with AKI, we used an approach published previously of merging scRNA data from KPMP and the Human Kidney Single Cell Transcriptome 36 https://susztaklab.com/hk_genemap_kpmp/scRNA Assessment of tubular necrosis and treatments of murine renal tubules All experiments included a negative control to assess LDH release at 0 h. No more than 10% LDH release in these negative controls was tolerated as a quality control. Freshly isolated mouse renal tubules were placed in 24-well plates in DMEM/F12 nutrient mixture without glycine and phenol red (DMEM/F12, custom-made medium provided by Cell Culture Technologies), supplemented with 0.01 mg ml −1 −1 −1 2 3 −1 −1 −1 In the case of treatment of tubules, the medium or each well of a 24-well plate was incubated with the compounds of interest. Tubules were added to each well and the samples were prepared for the LDH-release assay. LDH-release assay The LDH release of cells or of freshly isolated kidney tubules was measured according to manufacturers’ instructions at the indicated timepoints. In brief, an aliquot of the supernatant was taken to assess the experimental LDH values. Subsequently, lysis solution was added for 45 min to induce maximal LDH release before another aliquot of the supernatant was taken. The supernatants were then incubated with CytoTox 96 Reagent for 15 min protected from the light at room temperature before adding stop solution. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm and calculated as \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$100\\times \\frac{{\\rm{experimental}}\\;{\\rm{LDH}}\\;{\\rm{release}}}{\\text{max LDH release}}$$\\end{document} 100 × experimental LDH release max LDH release Time-lapse imaging Videos of freshly isolated mouse tubules stained with 50 nM SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain (Life Technologies) in the presence or absence of 150 nM Biotracker 609 Red Ca 2+ M22425 2 Quantification of SYTOX positivity in freshly isolated renal tubules Isolated renal tubules from male or female mice were incubated in a single 3D-printed well separated by a glass slide, stained with SYTOX green nucleic acid stain. Transmitted light and fluorescence time-lapse images (GFP BP filter cube) were acquired (described in more detail in the ‘Time-lapse imaging’ section). Every 30 min, the images were assessed for the number of tubules exhibiting more than 90% of SYTOX green positivity. For the quantification of cell death propagation, tubules with less than 90% SYTOX positivity were not counted. Debris was not included in the analysis. The total numbers of male and female tubules were visually counted. Data are presented as the percentage of tubules with equal or more than 90% of SYTOX positivity over time. Electron microscopy Mouse tubules were isolated according to the above-mentioned protocol, fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and then fixed in glutaraldehyde and underwent 1 h of post-fixation/contrasting with osmium tetroxide. The samples were then embedded in Epon resin through graded ethanols and propylene oxide. Blocks were polymerized at 80 °C overnight. Semi-thin sections were stained with methylene blue and azure blue. Thin sections were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on the Zeiss Electron Microscope EM 906 (Oberkochem). A Wide-Angle Dual-Speed 2K CCD-Camera TRS 465/14 (Tröndle Restlichtverstärkersysteme) was used for image acquisition in combination with Image SP (Tröndle Restlichtverstärkersysteme) as software.

The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 days. The solvent was removed in a vacuum and the crude product was purified over silica using the running mixture of iso-hexane/ethyl acetate (2.5:1) with addition of 0.2 vol% triethylamine. The product was obtained as an off-white solid (118 mg, 72%). Then, 40 mg of the product was purified by high-performance LC (HPLC) using the running mixture of iso-hexane/ethyl acetate (5:1) and obtained as a colourless solid (8.6 mg, 21%).

In brief, the isolated tubules (see the ‘Isolation of primary mouse renal tubules’ section for the isolation protocol) were washed twice with cold NaCl (0.9%) solution. Subsequently, any excess liquid was carefully removed. To ensure cell lysis and alkylation of thiol and persulfide species, 200 µl of a 5 mM MBB (monobromobimane) solution in 50% methanol was added to the tubules. The samples were then incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20 min. After the incubation period, the tubules were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, stored at −80 °C and finally shipped to the designated location on dry ice for further analysis.

Then, 700 µl of a 10:3 mixture of MTBE and methanol (warmed to room temperature) was added to the dried sample. The sample was shaken for 1 h at 4 °C at 1,400 rpm. Then, 140 µl of water was added, and the sample was shaken again for 15 min at 4 °C at 1,400 rpm. The mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C at 13,400 rpm. The upper organic phase was collected and transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, where it was evaporated. For the derivatization with pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride, 80 µl of sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M, pH 10) and 80 µl of pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride (2 mg ml −1 Pyridine sulfonyl derivatives of oestradiol (E2), 2-hydroxyoestradiol (2OH-E2), 4-hydroxyoestradiol (4OH-E2) but also of the internal standard d4-oestradiol (d4-E2) were profiled by LC–tandem MS (LC–MS/MS) using an instrument set-up containing an ultra-performance LC system (Aquity I-class, Waters) coupled to a triple quadrupole linear ion-trap mass spectrometer (QTRAP 6500+, Sciex). Chromatography separation was achieved using the Kinetex EVO C18 column (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 2.6 µm; Phenomenex) at 40 °C in conjunction with a gradient of aqueous mobile phase A (5 mM ammonium formate) and methanol as mobile phase B. Then, 5 μl of reconstituted samples, kept at 6 °C in the autosampler, were injected into the LC–MS/MS system at a flow rate of 0.350 ml min −1 Derivatized oestrogens were analysed in multiple-reaction monitoring scan mode (MRM) using positive ESI including the ion source parameters curtain gas (40 psi), ESI voltage (5,500 V), source temperature (500 °C), gas 1 (70 psi) and gas 2 (50 psi). Compound-dependent source and fragmentation parameters were set to 100 V declustering potential, 10 V entrance potential, 45 V collision energy and 10 V cell exit potential. For detection of E2 und d4-E2 (chromatographic retention time 9.3 min), respective pairs of quantifier and qualifier ions of 414.2–350.2 and 414.2–272.2, and 418.2–354.2 and 418.2–276.2 were used. Isobaric 4OH-E2 and 2OH-E2, baseline separated at retention times of 8.76 min and 8.96 min, respectively, were detected using pairs of 571.2–365.2 and 571.2–79.0. Data acquisition was performed by Analyst 1.7 (Sciex). Data processing was done by using the Sciex OS-MQ software package. The data were analysed based on the peak area and normalized according to the internal standard and the total protein. For data presentation, the mean of values from the control group (E2 in males) was calculated and other values represented as factor of this mean. Lipidomics analysis of murine renal tubules Mouse renal tubules were freshly isolated according to the isolation of primary mouse renal tubules (see above; n 49 g −1 For LC–MS analysis, lipids were resuspended in 50 µl of isopropanol and centrifuged, and 40 µl was transferred to glass vials. Lipids were separated by reversed-phase chromatography (Accucore C30 column; 150 mm × 2.1 mm 2.6 µM 150 Å, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled on-line to the Orbitrap Exploris 240 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a HESI source. Lipids were separated at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min −1 m z m z m z; Lipid identification was performed using Lipostar2. Features with isotopic pattern and MS/MS spectrum were matched against the LIPID MAPS database and selected based on automatic approval (3–4 stars). After manual approval based on an established LC–MS/MS lipid-identification strategy 50 P Mice Male and female mice (aged 8–12-week-old) were co-housed 2–5 mice per cage in individually ventilated cages in our facility at the Medizinisch-Theoretisches Zentrum (MTZ) at the Medical Faculty of the Technical University of Dresden (TU Dresden). All wild-type mice (C57BL/6N) were initially provided by Charles River at the age of 6–7 weeks.

If not otherwise specified, experiments were performed according to German animal protection laws and were approved by ethics committees and local authorities in Dresden (Landesdirektion Sachsen, Germany) or Munich (Germany) as described below. Induction of Gpx4 For survival and end-point studies, the tamoxifen-inducible conditional mouse strain Gpx4 fl/fl ROSA26-creERT2 20 Gpx4 −1 Bilateral kidney IRI injury model All male and female mice were strictly matched for weight, age and genetic background. Bilateral kidney IRI was performed as described in detail previously 43 −1 −1 In this study, we applied different doses of ischaemia. For male mice, we defined 36 min as a hard ischaemia dose (Figs. 1a,b 2j–m 5g,h 1f–i 2k–j,n–q 3p–r 1b–e 5i 8c 1i–l 4c–f 1a 9a–d To test the effect of ferrostatins in different doses of ischaemia, either vehicle or UAMC-3203 was applied 15 min before surgery as described above to 10-week-old C57BL/6N female wild-type mice. Surgery was performed as described above with ischaemia times escalating from 30 min to 45 min. After 48 h, blood was taken and the kidneys were removed and processed as described above (Supplementary Fig. 2j–l All IRI experiments were approved by the government of Saxony (Landesdirektion Sachsen, Germany; TVV 07/2021 and TVV 38/2024). Ovariectomy Ovariectomy was performed using an abdominal approach. At 15 min before surgery, all mice received 0.1 µg per g body weight buprenorphine-HCl for analgesia. Anaesthesia was induced by the application of volatile isoflurane with pure oxygen in the induction chamber of the COMPAC5 (VetEquip) small animal anaesthesia unit. After achieving a sufficient level of narcosis, typically within 2 min, mice were placed in a supine position on a temperature-controlled self-regulated heating system calibrated to 38 °C and fixed with stripes at all extremities. Surgical access to the abdominal cavity was created in the lower abdomen and the right ovary was visualized first. After ligation of the blood supply, the ovary was removed; the same procedure was applied to the left ovary. Next, the abdomen was closed layer by layer and the mice were set back into the individually ventilated cage in pairs. Then, 7 days later, IRI surgery was performed as described above partially using the previous abdominal access. Ovariectomies were approved by the government of Saxony (Landesdirektion Sachsen, Germany; TVV 38/2024). Histology Organs were dissected as indicated in each experiment and put in 4% (v/v) neutral-buffered formaldehyde, fixated for 24 h and then transferred to 70% ethanol for storage. In general, the kidneys were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and xylene, and finally embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (3–5 μm) were stained with periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reagent, according to a standard routine protocol. The stained sections were analysed using the Axio Imager microscope (Zeiss) or Zeiss Observer Z.1 at ×100, ×200 and ×400 magnification. Micrographs were digitalized using an AxioCam MRm Rev. 3 FireWire camera and AxioVision v.4.5 software (Zeiss), or using an AxioCam MRc and Zen 2012 Software (Zeiss), respectively. Organ damage was quantified by two experienced pathologists in a double-blinded manner on a scale ranging from 0 (unaffected tissue) to 10 (most severe organ damage). For the scoring system, tissues were stained with PAS, and the degree of morphological involvement in renal failure was determined using light microscopy. The following parameters were chosen as indicative of morphological damage to the kidney after IRI: brush border loss, red blood cell extravasation, tubule dilatation, tubule degeneration, tubule necrosis and tubular cast formation. These parameters were evaluated on a scale of 0–10, which ranged from not present (0), mild (1–4), moderate (5 or 6), severe (7 or 8), to very severe (9 or 10). Each parameter was determined on at least five different animals.

Mice were selected into groups according to genotype and sex. Otherwise, they were selected randomly. All mouse experiments were conducted in a strictly double-blinded manner during data collection and analysis. Group sizes were planned ahead of experiments as required by German animal welfare regulations under strict application of 3R initiatives. During all of the experiments involving mammal biomaterials (mice, pigs, humans), investigators were blinded to experimental groups during data acquisition and analysis. No blinding was performed for cell culture assays.
