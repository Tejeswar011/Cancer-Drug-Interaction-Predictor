The single-entry model (SEM) has been proposed to address these issues, but its implementation raises concerns among surgeons. We sought to explore surgeons’ perspectives on surgical wait times, referral processes, and the potential effect of the SEM on improving access to surgical care in a major metropolitan Canadian city. Methods: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study to explore the perspectives of surgeons at a large community hospital using semi-structured interviews. We used thematic analysis to identify key themes regarding surgical wait times, referral processes, and the SEM. Results: We interviewed 10 surgeons with different specialties and administrative roles, and a median 16.5 years of experience. Participants expressed frustration with systemic inefficiencies, particularly regarding long wait times for consultations and surgeries. Key issues included overwhelming workloads, limited operating room availability, and nonspecific referrals, which often led to delayed patient care. Surgeons reported burnout from managing these delays. Although many participants viewed the SEM as a promising strategy to improve equitable access to care, others raised concerns about depersonalization of care and reduced surgeon autonomy. Some participants emphasized that, without concurrent reforms to funding models, the SEM could inadvertently reinforce existing disparities, particularly gender-based pay inequities. Conclusion: Surgical wait times pose substantial challenges for both patient outcomes and surgeon well-being. The SEM holds promise for reducing delays and improving equity in patient access, but its successful implementation requires addressing concerns related to surgeon autonomy and workforce equity. Contexte : Les temps d’attente pour une intervention chirurgicale ont des répercussions sur les résultats des patientes et patients, l’accès aux soins et le bien-être des chirurgiennes et chirurgiens. Le modèle à guichet unique a été proposé pour répondre à ces problèmes, mais sa mise en œuvre soulève des préoccupations chez les chirurgiennes et chirurgiens. Nous avons voulu analyser les points de vue des chirurgiennes et chirurgiens quant au temps d’attente pour une intervention chirurgicale, aux processus d’aiguillage et à l’effet possible du modèle à guichet unique qui pourrait améliorer l’accès aux soins chirurgicaux dans une grande ville canadienne. Méthodes : Nous avons effectué une étude descriptive qualitative pour analyser les points de vue de chirurgiennes et chirurgiens d’un grand hôpital communautaire au moyen d’entrevues semi-structurées. Nous avons eu recours à une analyse thématique pour cerner les principaux sujets relatifs au temps d’attente pour une intervention chirurgicale, aux processus d’aiguillage et au modèle à guichet unique. Résultats : Nous avons réalisé des entretiens avec 10 chirurgiennes et chirurgiens de différentes spécialités et occupant divers postes administratifs, et comptant 16,5 ans d’expérience (médiane). Les personnes participantes ont exprimé une frustration à l’égard de l’inefficacité en général, notamment en ce qui concerne les longs temps d’attente pour les consultations et les interventions chirurgicales. Parmi les principaux problèmes soulevés, notons les énormes charges de travail, la disponibilité limitée des salles d’opération et les aiguillages non spécifiques, qui entraînent souvent un retard dans les soins aux patientes et patients. Les chirurgiennes et chirurgiens ont rapporté souffrir d’épuisement professionnel lié à la gestion de ces retards. Bien que de nombreuses personnes participant à ces entretiens ont jugé le modèle à guichet unique comme étant une stratégie prometteuse pour améliorer l’accès équitable aux soins, d’autres ont soulevé des préoccupations quant à la dépersonnalisation des soins et à la diminution de l’autonomie des chirurgiennes et chirurgiens. Certaines personnes ont insisté sur le fait que, sans des réformes parallèles des modèles de financement, le modèle à guichet unique pourrait involontairement accroître les disparités existantes, entre autres celles liées aux iniquités de rémunération fondée sur le sexe. Conclusion : Les temps d’attente pour une intervention chirurgicale posent des défis importants tant pour les résultats des patientes et patients que le bien-être des chirurgiennes et chirurgiens. Le modèle de guichet unique semble être une solution prometteuse pour réduire les retards et améliorer l’équité de l’accès des patientes et patients. Cependant, la réussite de sa mise en œuvre nécessite de se pencher sur les problèmes liés à l’autonomie des chirurgiennes et chirurgiens et à l’équité des effectifs de la santé.

This includes Canada, where wait times affect patient outcomes, access to care, and the efficiency of surgical services. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Although the SEM has been proposed as a solution to streamline surgical referrals and improve access to care, implementation raises several concerns among surgeons. Studies have shown that, although the SEM can reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction, it may also introduce challenges related to resource allocation, data tracking, and surgeon autonomy. 4 7 Our objective was to explore the perspectives of surgeons at a large community hospital regarding current wait times for patient consultations and surgical procedures. We aimed to identify the perceived impacts of the SEM on these wait times, as well as any associated potential benefits and challenges. By examining the broader issues affecting surgical wait times, we sought to inform strategies for improving patient care and system efficiency. Methods Study design and setting In this study, we employed a qualitative descriptive approach using semi-structured interviews to gather in-depth insights from surgeons across a range of specialties. 8 9 8 9 We conducted this study at Trillium Health Partners (THP), a large community hospital with 3 sites serving Mississauga and Toronto, Canada. A comprehensive range of surgical specialties are represented at THP and 67 739 surgeries were performed during the 2023/24 fiscal year. 10 Participants We employed purposive and maximum variation sampling to recruit surgeons from a variety of surgical specialties and administrative positions for participation in individual semi-structured qualitative interviews. 11 12 11 13 Data collection We invited surgeons to take part in individual semi-structured interviews with a surgeon who is learning qualitative methodology (J.C.). Virtual interviews were conducted in English over Zoom between January and March 2024 and lasted 45 to 60 minutes. 14 Appendix 1 https://www.cjs.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cjs.014424/tab-related-content 13 Data analysis The interview transcripts were thematically analyzed. 15 16 Ethics approval This study was deemed quality improvement by the THP Research Ethics Board. We obtained informed verbal consent from all interviewees before participation. Results Ten surgeons from various specialties — general surgery ( n n n n n n n n n Surgeons expressed frustration with systemic inefficiencies in managing wait times, referrals, and operating room (OR) availability — factors that delayed care, increased patient distress, and caused provider moral distress. The SEM was viewed as a potential strategy to improve equitable access, although concerns were raised about its impact on patient–surgeon relationships and case selection aligned with expertise. Five key themes emerged from the data. Theme 1: wait time management and operating room resources Surgeons expressed deep frustration with systemic challenges to timely care, including overwhelming workloads, inefficient referral processes, and limited OR time. One surgeon described feeling so overwhelmed by referrals that they paused accepting new ones and continued to struggle with the backlog. Scarcity of OR time was also a recurring issue, with surgeons feeling pressure to prioritize urgent cases over elective procedures, leading to delays and compromised care. Some surgeons reported additional pressure and distress associated with ensuring they could complete certain procedures within their allotted OR time. One surgeon described personal tension, panic, and guilt, particularly when a complication in a surgery delayed the care of another patient. You’re allotted a certain amount of operating room time, and that’s how our resources are determined. And so, you know, I know that if I have a certain day that I can fit x Participants’ frustration stemmed from moral distress, as they knew they could offer effective care but were restricted by system limitations. Instead of empowerment, this sense of hopelessness was particularly evident when patients experienced extended wait times. When you see a patient, they’ve got a problem, and I know 100% I could fix that problem ... and they’re going to suffer for a month, 2 months, 6 months, whatever it is. Or come back to emerg. (Surgeon 2, urology) Theme 2: referral procedures Several surgeons expressed frustration with wait times from referral to consultation, highlighting system inefficiencies and burdens placed on patients. They empathized with patients who travelled long distances because of referrals based on a family physician’s memory or habitual referral practices, rather than standardized processes based on geography or accessibility. One surgeon described the challenge: They’re still using that Rolodex in their brain of, “Who do I send to [to manage a specific problem], and how do I get them there?” (Surgeon 1, plastic surgery) This same surgeon also emphasized the need for a systematic referral process: I think there should be 1 site for the entire province, where a family doctor would go and say, “This is the problem area,” or type of problem, and then it narrows it down from there. (Surgeon 1, plastic surgery) Participants described how these inefficiencies not only extended wait times, but also inconvenienced patients and providers; inconsistent referral processing led to backlogs for some surgeons, while others managed urgent cases more smoothly. They suggested that a more coordinated, centralized referral system could reduce these inconsistencies and ensure timely access to appropriate surgical care. Intradivision collaboration was seen as key to optimizing referrals. Surgeons emphasized that directing patients to the appropriate specialist could improve care quality and reduce delays. Streamlining allocation would help avoid misdirected referrals, ensure complex cases reach the right experts, and balance workloads. This could enhance both patient outcomes and surgeon satisfaction by allowing surgeons to focus on cases best suited to their expertise. If we were really a well-oiled machine, we would figure out who does what the best and who wants to do what. And then have a referral system where the right patients went to the right surgeon. (Surgeon 6, general surgery) Gender inequities in remuneration propagated by referral patterns were another concern. Some pointed out that systemic pay disparities can disproportionately affect female surgeons and those performing pediatric or female-specific procedures, which are typically compensated at lower rates, and contribute to the broader gender pay gap in the profession. 17 There’s a system issue around remuneration ... the gender pay gap between male and female surgeons, and specifically the remuneration for pediatric or female procedures, is lower. (Surgeon 3, thoracic surgery) Theme 3: surgical wait times Surgeons expressed discontent with the way surgical wait times were tracked and emphasized that metrics often failed to reflect clinical realities. The system’s focus on quantitative measures such as average wait times and benchmarks oversimplified the complexities of patient care, overlooking factors such as clinical urgency, individual patient needs, and resource constraints faced by surgeons. I know we get the wait time data from the OR. But to me, it’s never been relevant or practical.” (Surgeon 1, plastic surgery) A major source of frustration was limited OR availability, particularly for elective surgeries. Urgent cases often took priority, resulting in frequent postponements of elective procedures and growing backlogs. These delays were not only frustrating for surgeons but also had a substantial impact on patients, especially when nonurgent conditions worsened while they waited. Variability in wait times across specialties and hospital sites was a recurring concern. Some surgeons reported manageable wait times, while others experienced major disruptions, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to widespread cancellations of elective surgeries and years-long backlogs. Recovery was uneven across hospital sites, with some departments catching up faster than others. These disparities underscored the need for more flexible scheduling and resource allocation to support equitable access to care. Our wait times are appropriate ... but for some colleagues, they were really shut down during COVID. (Surgeon 10, orthopedics) Theme 4: perceived patient experience Surgeons recognized the emotional burden that prolonged wait times imposed on patients, particularly those with nonurgent yet impactful conditions. The unpredictability of surgical scheduling, compounded by the prioritization of emergent cases, contributed to mutual frustration among patients and providers. Surgeons described the challenge of offering definitive timelines for procedures, often estimating delays of several months, which frequently resulted in visible patient distress and dissatisfaction. For that person, when they ask me, “Well how long is it going to be for surgery?”... I have to say, “I don’t know, 6, 7, 8, 9 months.” You see their face get very sad and upset. (Surgeon 4, otolaryngology) Surgeons noted that long wait times often worsened patients’ conditions, turning straightforward cases into more complex ones that required additional interventions. For example, a benign condition left untreated could progress, increasing surgical risk and recovery time. This not only prolonged suffering, but also heightened emotional distress, as patients realized that delays were leading to more serious complications and greater strain on the health system. I did a complex case that was languishing on someone’s wait-list, and [a complication occurred because of progression of disease] ... the patient came to me really upset after being told, “I can’t do this.” (Surgeon 9, ophthalmology) This growing complexity and emotional strain not only frustrated patients, but also added to surgeons’ moral burden, as they knew earlier intervention could have prevented further complications and distress. Theme 5: single-entry model Surgeons expressed mixed views on the SEM, although many supported centralized referrals to improve efficiency and ease patient burdens. Supporters noted that a centralized system could streamline referrals by matching patients with suitable surgeons based on subspecialty and availability, rather than relying on informal networks. This could reduce wait times and limit disruptions such as unnecessary travel for specialist care. I always wished for a centralized referral system ... if a patient comes from beyond [distant city], why would they come to see me and pass 4 other surgeons? (Surgeon 1, plastic surgery) Surgeons also highlighted that the SEM should account for the complexity of cases and individual surgeon expertise, not just even distribution of workloads. They noted that not all surgeries are equal in difficulty or time requirements, and surgeons have different specializations. Simply spreading cases evenly could overlook these nuances, leading to inefficiencies or compromised patient care. Equity among patients, yes, but among surgeons, it’s not real. Surgeons are different, and expertise is different. (Surgeon 8, vascular surgery) However, surgeons expressed concern about how the SEM could affect their autonomy in case selection. They debated whether the model should focus on allocating more OR resources to surgeons with longer wait-lists or on redistributing patients to surgeons with shorter wait-lists. Although many saw the potential for the SEM to balance workloads and improve efficiency, some feared that redistributing patients might disrupt established relationships between surgeons and patients. Additionally, surgeons worried that being assigned cases through a centralized system might limit their ability to select cases according to their expertise or cases that they preferred to manage, particularly in specialties with overlapping areas of expertise. I think there is this tension between where the resources should follow ... do you put more resources to the surgeon with the long waiting list, or do you take the patients away from that surgeon? (Surgeon 2, urology) Generational differences in attitudes toward the SEM also emerged. Younger surgeons appeared more open to sharing the workload, viewing it as a way to manage overwhelming demands. I know a lot of the more old-school surgeons tend to view new surgeons as competition. For a lot of the younger surgeons it’s like, ‘There’s too much work. Please take it away from me. I am so drowning it’s crazy.’ (Surgeon 1, plastic surgery) Surgeons viewed the SEM as a promising way to improve equity by streamlining referrals and accelerating access to surgery. Centralizing referrals could distribute patients more evenly among surgeons, reducing variation in wait times caused by geography or individual referral patterns. This would help prevent situations where patients wait longer simply because of the surgeon they were referred to. Logistically, I think it would increase equity for patients regarding wait times by spreading it more evenly. (Surgeon 1, plastic surgery) Concerns about equity among surgeons were nuanced, particularly regarding the SEM’s impact on surgeon–patient relationships. Although the model aims to balance workloads and standardize care, some surgeons feared it could depersonalize care by assigning patients based on availability rather than relationships or expertise. They emphasized that trust, communication, and familiarity are essential to delivering personalized care, and worried the SEM might make them feel interchangeable, undermining the personal connection central to their practice. The other half of equity is uncoupling the physician relationship with the patient ... it takes away some of the value in medicine. (Surgeon 2, urology) Discussion In this study, we explored surgeons’ perspectives regarding the challenges associated with managing surgical wait times, including referral processes, OR availability, and the impact of systemic inefficiencies on both patient care and surgeon workload. Our findings highlight several systemic challenges that affected surgeons’ ability to manage wait times and provide timely care. Surgeons expressed frustration with overwhelming workloads, inefficient referral processes, and limited OR time, which forced them to prioritize urgent cases, leading to delays in elective procedures and creating moral distress as they witnessed patients suffering from nonurgent but debilitating conditions. This aligns with broader issues highlighted in other Canadian studies that have identified substantial barriers to timely access to surgery related to variability in wait-time reporting systems across provinces and territories, leading to delays in elective surgeries. 18 Surgeons expressed frustration with the ad hoc nature of many referrals, often guided more by family physicians’ familiarity or habitual practices than by standardized processes. This reliance on a “mental Rolodex” frequently resulted in patients travelling longer distances or facing unnecessary prolonged wait times, as referrals may have been directed based on family physicians’ subjective judgment rather than systematized approaches. Another issue with decentralized referrals is surgeons’ incentives; those operating under a fee-for-service model may prioritize certain types of referrals, actively redistributing cases they feel are better managed elsewhere or where shorter wait times exist — or they may decline referrals altogether. This observation has been identified throughout Ontario, where decentralized referral practices contribute to inconsistencies that place some patients in unnecessarily long queues and create bottlenecks in the health care system. 19 In our study, surgeons identified that the current referral system created substantial challenges for patients, surgeons, and health systems. Postponements of nonurgent surgeries for urgent cases are common, potentially prolonging patient suffering, complicating treatment, and adding to surgeons’ sense of burnout. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened these delays, with some surgeons experiencing complete shutdowns during critical periods. This issue has been identified in other Canadian health care studies, where delays in accessing general and elective surgeries were not only prevalent, but also contributed to patient distress, with reports of high levels of patient anxiety and depression and worsened health outcomes leading to more complex or riskier surgeries. 20 22 Most surgeons reported burnout that stemmed from systemic inefficiencies, including overwhelming workloads, long referral wait times, and limited OR availability. Many described the emotional toll of having to prioritize urgent cases while delaying elective surgeries, resulting in moral distress as they witnessed patients suffering due to prolonged waits. These challenges, compounded by the pressure to manage high patient volumes and navigate an overburdened system, contributed to feelings of exhaustion and frustration. Payne 23 3 22 24 Participants also raised broader concerns about workforce equity, understood as the fair distribution of cases, opportunities, and resources among surgeons. Although SEMs are often framed as mechanisms to improve patient equity by standardizing access and minimizing variation in wait times, surgeons emphasized that equitable systems must also address provider-level factors, including differences in expertise, case complexity, and historical inequities in remuneration. Several noted that current remuneration models do not reflect the intensity or value of certain procedures. For example, pediatric and female-specific surgeries — often managed by female surgeons — were seen as undervalued in billing structures. This perception aligns with findings of previous studies showing that female surgeons are disproportionately represented in lower-paying subspecialties and perform a greater share of undervalued procedures. 17 25 26 Although some surgeons in our study expressed support for the SEM, others raised concerns about potential challenges. Many supported it as a potential way to streamline referrals and improve efficiency by distributing cases more evenly across surgeons. This view aligns with research demonstrating the ability of the SEM to reduce wait times, particularly for high-volume, low-complexity surgeries. 5 7 4 Limitations We conducted this study at a single institution — THP — a large, multisite community hospital serving a diverse, high-volume population in a Canadian metropolitan area. The structure and scale of THP, including its broad range of surgical subspecialties, centralized administrative support, and system-level innovation, may have influenced surgeons’ views on the SEM and wait-time management. Surgeons at THP may be more receptive to centralized approaches given previous exposure to similar initiatives such as DAPs. In contrast, surgeons in smaller hospitals, rural settings, or institutions with fewer resources and subspecialty services may face different operational challenges and view SEMs as less feasible or relevant. Therefore, the transferability of our findings may be limited, especially in settings with different institutional structures, referral patterns, or patient demographics. Although we used purposive and maximum variation sampling to recruit participants with diverse clinical and administrative backgrounds, this approach may have limited the range of perspectives, particularly regarding systemic factors like provincial policy, funding, or staffing. Participants’ responses reflected personal experiences and may not fully capture broader structural or institutional barriers that can influence referrals and wait times. Additionally, our findings may not reflect the full range of experiences across surgical specialties, each of which may face distinct challenges in implementing centralized referral models. Conclusion This study highlights the substantial challenges faced by surgeons in managing wait times, with many expressing frustrations over overwhelming workloads, inefficient referral processes, and limited OR time. These delays not only affect patient outcomes, but also create moral distress for surgeons as they witness the worsening of nonurgent conditions. Many participants empathized with patients, who experienced increased anxiety and deterioration of health because of prolonged wait times, a sentiment supported by broader research on patient distress during extended surgical delays. Further research is needed to explore the broader implications of the SEM, including patient perspectives and external factors such as hospital policies and funding, to ensure that surgical wait time solutions are both effective and equitable.
