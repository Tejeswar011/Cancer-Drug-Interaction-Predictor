While computed tomography (CT) scans are beneficial for diagnosis, the optimal and most convenient method for opportunistic screening is not yet determined. This retrospective study evaluated how well chest CT can diagnose osteoporosis and low BMD at the T11 and T12 levels, using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) as the standard reference in participants who received CT and DXA scans. We included 147 postmenopausal women. Based on the lowest T-score from the DXA test, all patients were classified into normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis groups. Both T11 HU and T12 HU showed a strong correlation with T-scores ( P P P Keywords Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry Chest computed tomography Osteoporosis Opportunistic screening Subject terms Diseases Medical research pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Limited 2025 Introduction Postmenopausal osteoporosis is caused by estrogen deficiency, which leads to increased osteoclast differentiation and accelerated bone resorption beyond bone formation, resulting in bone loss. This results in low bone mineral density, deterioration of bone microstructure, decreased bone strength, and increased risk of fragility fractures. Roughly 20% of women in the United States who are over 50 and 30% who are over 65 meet the diagnostic standards for osteoporosis 1 2 3 Identifying and treating osteoporosis early can significantly decelerate bone resorption, lower the risk of fragility fractures, and decrease the occurrence of complications related to osteoporosis, and reduce the social burden 4 5 Measurement of vertebral bone mineral density is an important indicator recommended by the World Health Organization for the diagnosis and screening of osteoporosis. At present, the DXA method is the gold standard for assessing bone mineral density, and it is also the most commonly used bone densitometry measurement method in clinical and scientific research, which can be used for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, the prediction of fracture risk, and the evaluation of drug efficacy. In addition, there is a quantitative computed tomography (QCT) that provides three-dimensional volumetric bone density 6 7 8 9 Opportunistic osteoporosis screening refers to the use of routine CT scan data from chest, abdomen, etc., for other indications to assess volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) and osteoporosis screening at no additional cost and without additional equipment, time, or radiation exposure 10 12 13 14 Chest CT is the most widely used examination in clinical practice and physical examination, and is mainly used for screening for lung diseases such as tumors and inflammation. CT images offer vertebral HU values that are useful for diagnosing osteoporosis 10 11 15 10 11 Methods Study design and participants This retrospective study received approval from the Ethics Committee of Henan Provincial People’s Hospital, and informed consent was obtained from all the participants. Additionally, it was conducted following the ethical principles of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki. We recruited 325 patients hospitalized in the Department of Spine and Spinal Cord Surgery at Henan Provincial People’s Hospital between January 2024 and December 2024: (1) postmenopausal women; (2) DXA and chest CT are carried out in our hospital at intervals of no more than 2 weeks. Exclusion criteria: (1) Patients with severe heart failure, liver and kidney damage; (2) Patients with conditions impacting bone metabolism including diabetes, multiple myeloma, hyperparathyroidism, etc. (3) Patients who consume alcohol excessively or use medications like glucocorticoids that influence bone metabolism; (4) Previous lumbar internal fixation surgery or vertebroplasty surgery; (5) Previous diagnosis of osteoporosis; (6) T11/12 fracture or surgery. A total of 147 individuals were included in the study (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Flow-chart of patient inclusion and grouping. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry For measuring bone mineral density, a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar iDXA, GE Healthcare, USA) was used. All patients underwent DXA scans of the lumbar spine(L1-4) and proximal femur. Areas with severe degeneration or significant osteophyte formation that cause markedly increased local bone mineral density are excluded. Typically, fractured lumbar vertebrae exhibit significantly higher bone density and are also excluded from the analysis. BMD results presented as T-scores and g/cm 2 16 CT scan acquisition Patients were hospitalized due to spinal fractures, lumbar disc herniation, lumbar spinal stenosis, or cervical spondylosis and required surgical intervention. To assess potential pulmonary conditions—such as infections or inflammatory diseases—that could influence surgical decisions, chest CT scans were performed. Chest CT examinations were done on a 64-row spiral CT (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens). The patient was in the supine position, and a CT scan was performed. The CT scanning parameters are as follows: tube voltage: 120 kV, tube current: automatic adjustment, layer thickness: 1 mm. CT values of the 11th and 12th thoracic vertebrae were measured in the axial position. Initially, the median sagittal position of the CT scan was chosen as the reference point for measurement. Next, create a region of interest (ROI) that is as large as possible in the axial position of the corresponding vertebra, while leaving out the vertebral cortical bone and nutrient foramen. Finally, separate measurements of the HU values for the mesial upper, middle, and mesial inferior endplates were conducted and then averaged. Focal abnormalities can be identified on CT scans by their characteristically elevated or reduced Hounsfield units, and such cases were excluded from analysis. Cases involving T11/T12 fixation or vertebroplasty were also excluded due to their significant effects on HU measurements. The identification of vertebral fractures The subjects of this study include acute vertebral fragility fractures or chronic vertebral fractures. Acute vertebral fragility fractures are defined as: (1) caused by low-energy trauma, such as a fall from standing height or lower; (2) thoraco-low back pain associated with postural changes; (3) obvious tenderness or percussion pain on physical examination. (4) characteristics of acute vertebral fracture found on MRI or CT. A chronic vertebral fracture is calculated when vertebral height is compressed (> 25%) according to the Genant semi-quantitative assessment but there are no typical symptoms, signs, or MRI features of an acute vertebral fracture 17 Statistical analysis All patients were divided into normal, osteopenia, and osteoporosis groups according to the DXA T-score. Continuous variables express as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the efficacy of CT attenuation values in predicting osteopenia or osteoporosis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. All statistical results were obtained using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows ver. 26.0 (Armonk, NY, USA). Results Patient characteristics A total of 147 patients were included in this study. Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1 P  Table 1 Patient characteristics.

For osteoporosis detection, T11 showed a threshold of 106.1 HU (sensitivity 0.924, specificity 0.644), while T12 had a threshold of 92.8 HU (sensitivity 0.797, specificity 0.794). For low BMD detection, T11 demonstrated a threshold of 140.5 HU (sensitivity 0.657, specificity 0.848), compared to T12 with a threshold of 133.9 HU (sensitivity 0.686, specificity 0.843). Following patient reclassification as previously described, we identified distinct HU thresholds: for osteoporosis, 101.4 HU (sensitivity 0.675, specificity 0.878, T11) vs. 82.6 HU (sensitivity 0.822, specificity 0.823, T12); for low BMD, 153.1 HU (sensitivity 0.650, specificity 0.875, T11) vs. 140.2 HU (sensitivity 0.751, specificity 0.874, T12). In summary, T11 and T12 exhibited comparable diagnostic performance in detecting both osteoporosis and low BMD. Correlation between CT HUs and the number of fractures 94 individuals had no fractures, 13 had fractures in 1 vertebral body, 6 had fractures in 2 vertebral bodies, 14 had fractures in 3 vertebral bodies,12 had fractures in 6 vertebral bodies, 5 had fractures in 7 vertebral bodies, and 3 had fractures in 10 vertebral bodies. In total, there were 204 fractured vertebral bodies, comprising 73 lumbar vertebrae and 131 thoracic vertebrae. The increasing fracture numbers show a significant decrease in Hu values (Fig. 3 P P 3 3  Fig. 3 Correlation between the CT values and the number of fractures. ( a b P P c Discussion The article examines the feasibility of using chest CT data to diagnose osteoporosis and low BMD. Budoff et al. suggested that the T10-T12 vertebral region serves as an effective surrogate for lumbar spine in BMD evaluation due to their high measurement correlation 18 1 5 We found that bone mass decreases with age, and this is due to the withdrawal of hormones after menopause, which affects women’s bone metabolism 1 19 10 15 20 We focused on the diagnostic performance of thoracic HU values of osteoporosis. Through ROC analysis, we saw no significant difference in AUC between T11/12 for the diagnosis of osteoporosis, suggesting that the diagnostic value of T11/12 was similar. T11 showed a threshold of 106.1 HU (sensitivity0.924, specificity0.644), while T12 had a threshold of 92.87 HU (sensitivity 0.797, specificity 0.794). The results show that the advantages of the HU thresholds of T11 in diagnosing osteoporosis are more due to its very high sensitivity, while T12 is more balanced in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Other study reported that the HU threshold of T12 was 114.5, and 122.5 for T11, which was quite different from the HU value of T12 or T11 in this study 10 For low BMD detection, T11 demonstrated a threshold of 140.5 HU (sensitivity 0.657, specificity 0.848), compared to T12 with a threshold of 133.9 HU (sensitivity 0.686, specificity 0.843), which shows that the HU thresholds of T11 and T12 have their respective advantages in the identification of normal and low BMD. After patient reclassification, T12 appeared to marginally outperform T11 in both sensitivity and specificity for detecting osteoporosis and low BMD, which may require further investigation in future studies. Since the previous results showed that T11 attenuation has a higher predictive sensitivity for osteoporosis, we investigated the relationship between the HU value of T11 and fractures. Obviously, the increasing fracture numbers show a significant decrease in Hu values (Fig. 3 21 22 23 Some limitations should be mentioned. First of all, the sample size is small. Secondly, in order to measure the HU value of T11/12 to reduce the experimental error, we excluded patients with T11/12 fractures, which may have an impact on the results. Thirdly, due to factor of manual measurement, it may be necessary to combine artificial intelligence to better solve the problem. Conclusion We show the feasibility of identifying patients with osteoporosis and low BMD, using chest CT obtained for other conditions. Vertebral CT attenuation analysis could offer a practical screening modality that can be seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows to proactively detect patients susceptible to future osseous abnormalities, especially to prevent fractures.
