Introduction Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common malignancy of the oral cavity [ 1 2 2 3 4 1 3 4 5 OSCC is characterized by a high rate of recurrence and demonstrates a pronounced tendency to metastasize, primarily through the lymphatic system [ 6 7 8 9 A clinically node-negative neck (cN0) is defined as the absence of detectable lymph node metastases based on thorough preoperative assessment, including both clinical examination and radiological imaging modalities. Occult lymph node metastasis (OLNM) refers to metastatic deposits that are present but remain undetected by preoperative evaluation. This diagnostic challenge is underscored by the fact that approximately 20% to 30% of patients classified as cN0 are subsequently found to harbor OLNM upon pathological examination. When considering management strategies for the cN0 neck, tree options exist: elective neck dissection (END), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and watchful waiting approach. Advocates of the watchful waiting strategy argue that this method spares approximately 70% to 80% of patients from undergoing unnecessary surgical intervention and its associated morbidity [ 6 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 15 17 18 While multiple predictive factors for OLNM have been investigated, only depth of invasion (DOI) has constantly emerged as an independent predictive factor [ 9 19 20 21 22 23 Consequently, for the long time considerable scientific efforts have been dedicated to the identification and validation of potential biomarkers capable of reliably detecting OLNM in patients with OSCC [ 9 24 25 Tumor lymphangiogenesis represents a critical step in the development of lymph node metastasis, as it facilitates the dissemination of malignant cells through newly formed lymphatic channels. This process encompasses the formation of both intratumoral and peritumoral lymphatic vessels [ 9 24 25 Lymphovascular density (LVD) has been proposed as a potential biomarker for regional metastasis in OSCC. However, the current literature shows conflicting evidence regarding whether intratumoral lymphovascular density (ILVD), peritumoral lymphovascular density (PLVD), or both play significant roles in metastasis or serve as prognostic indicators [ 9 26 27 28 Podoplanin is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on lymphatic endothelial cells. Current literature highlights its dual role in both the development of the lymphatic vascular system and tumorigenesis [ 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 28 29 30 36 37 38 39 40 41 This study seeks to assess the prognostic significance of PLVD and ILVD in predicting OLNM in OSCC. To achieve this, we utilize the D2-40 antibody, an established immunohistochemical marker for lymphatic endothelium, to accurately quantify lymphangiogenesis and explore its association with metastatic risk. 2. Materials and Methods Forty-three patients diagnosed with OSCC who were treated consecutively with primary surgery at a tertiary care cancer center were included in this retrospective study. Clinical and pathological data for these patients were collected from the institutional database, covering the period from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2015. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) T1–T4 primary OSCC; (b) no previous history of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC); (c) surgical resection of the primary tumor with concomitant END; (d) absence of neoadjuvant treatment; (e) no radiological or clinical evidence of LNM; and (f) reliable follow-up. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) OSCC patients with a clinically node-positive neck (cN+); (b) previous surgical or chemo/radiotherapy of HNSCC; (c) unreliable follow-up; and (d) incomplete data in hospital medical records. Preoperatively, all patients underwent clinical and radiological evaluation using either multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Standard preoperative protocol included contrast-enhanced imaging of the head, neck and thorax. All cases were presented preoperatively at the institutional multidisciplinary tumor board. The indication for END has been routinely established for locally advanced primary tumors (cT3, cT4). The decision to perform END in cT2 tumors has been made considering tumor sublocation inside the oral cavity, histological grade, and the necessity for microvascular reconstruction. The standard of care for END in oral cancer includes dissection of levels I–III/IV, depending on the tumor prognosticators. Postoperatively, the neck specimens were divided into neck levels and sent for histopathological analysis. During follow-up, each patient was evaluated every 2–3 months for the first two years, every 4-6 months for the subsequent four years, and annually thereafter. Each follow-up appointment included a physical examination. Ultrasound of the region was performed 1–2 times per year, and the imaging (MSCT or MRI) of the head, neck and thorax was conducted annually. 2.1. Histological and Immunohistological Analysis Postoperative histopathological analysis was routinely carried out on hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained slides by an experienced pathologist specializing in head and neck pathology (D.M.). The HE staining technique employed for routine histological evaluation involves sequential application of hematoxylin, which stains cell nuclei blue purple, followed by eosin, which stains cytoplasmic and extracellular proteins in varying shades of pink. The tissue sections were prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, cut at a standard thickness of 4–5 μm. For the purposes of this study, several key histopathological parameters were documented. These included tumor T staging based on the updated 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classification system. Additional parameters recorded were the presence of perineural invasion and perivascular invasion, tumor sublocation within the oral cavity, maximum tumor diameter, and the presence or absence of extracapsular extension (ENE) of nodal metastases. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on four-micrometer-thick sections of paraffin-embedded primary tumor tissue using the anti-podoplanin antibody D2-40 (Agilent, M3619). The D2-40 antibody binds specifically to podoplanin, a mucin-type transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on lymphatic endothelium but not on blood vessels. The immunostaining procedure involved antigen retrieval, typically by heat-induced epitope retrieval using citrate buffer, followed by incubation with the primary antibody and detection via a polymer-based secondary antibody system with chromogenic visualization using diaminobenzidine (DAB). This protocol yields distinct brown immunoreactive lymphatic vessels suitable for quantitative analysis. LVD was assessed by identifying lymphatic vessel hotspots both within the tumor mass (intratumoral) and in the peritumoral stroma, defined as tissue located within 0.5 mm of the tumor margin. This evaluation followed the method described by Yuan et al. [ 42 Figure 1 Figure 2 2 2.2. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses for this study were performed using GraphPad Prism software, version 8.4.3 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Descriptive statistical analysis was performed on a study cohort consisting of 43 patients. Age data were summarized by calculating the mean and median values. Gender distribution and tumor localization were presented as counts and percentages. Tumor sites included sublingual region, tongue, retromolar trigone, and mandibular gingiva. Tumor staging was determined according to the AJCC 8th edition criteria for oral cancer [ 43 2 For the detailed statistical analysis, the initial step consisted of evaluating the distribution of continuous variables to determine whether they adhered to a normal distribution. This was systematically assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test, which was applied to each continuous variable included in the analysis.; this was accomplished using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Data points that deviated significantly from the overall dataset were identified as potential outliers through application of the Grubbs test, allowing for the detection and consideration of anomalous values that could potentially bias results. Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages to provide a clear overview of the distribution of categorical data within the study population. Comparisons between categorical groups were made using either Fisher’s exact test, which is appropriate for small sample sizes and provides exact p 2 t 3. Results A total of 43 patients were included in this study. The mean age was 61.3 years, with a median age of 59 years.

Discussion The main scope of this study is to determine the influence of intratumoral and peritumoral lymphatic vessel density (ILVD and PLVD) as prognostic factors for OLNM in oral squamous cell carcinoma OSCC. The propensity for epithelial malignancies to metastasize via lymphatic vessels arises from their structural characteristics. Thinner walls composed of a single endothelial layer and discontinuous basement membrane, resulting in greater permeability compared to blood vessels [ 30 44 30 45 46 47 30 48 49 In our study, we observed significantly higher PLVD compared to ILVD. This contrasts with findings by Mermond et al. [ 9 2 36 In our study, PLVD was significantly higher in early-stage tumors (pT1 and pT2) compared to locally advanced tumors (pT3 and pT4). No significant difference was observed for ILVD across tumor stages. This aligns with research by Mafra et al. [ 50 51 p p 52 p 53 In our study, there was no significant correlation between overall disease stage, as defined by the UICC/AJCC 8th edition staging manual, and either ILVD or PLVD. Although there was a trend toward higher ILVD and PLVD in patients with advanced-stage disease (stage III and IV) compared to those with early-stage disease (stage I and II), the differences were not statistically significant. Similar findings have been reported by other authors, who also failed to demonstrate a significant correlation between lymphatic vessel density and disease stage [ 2 27 In our current study higher ILVD was significantly associated with the presence of OLNM. Some studies have correlated PLVD with regional metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [ 9 26 27 51 27 28 54 55 56 2 27 9 24 25 27 54 57 58 59 27 In our study, there was no significant correlation LVD and survival outcome, although higher ILVD showed a trend toward poorer outcomes. Some studies have also failed to demonstrate a correlation between intratumoral or peritumoral lymphatic vessel density and survival outcomes [ 51 2 52 60 61 Controversy persists in this field, with some authors correlating higher PLVD with worse outcomes [ 51 61 4.1. Future Research Directions This research contributes valuable insights to the complex and evolving field of LVD as a prognostic factor in OSCC. Notably, it focuses on a specific patient population with clinically node-negative status, who represent a critical subgroup of high interest in current head and neck oncology research due to the challenge of OLNM prediction. While the potential of LVD to serve as a reliable prognostic biomarker for OLNM is promising, its clinical utility remains to be conclusively established. Prospective studies involving larger patient cohorts are essential to validate these preliminary findings and clarify the prognostic value of LVD in this context. Additionally, future investigations should explore the feasibility of accurately assessing LVD from routine preoperative biopsy specimens, which could enhance clinical decision-making without requiring extensive surgical sampling. This includes research into technical advancements and standardization of immunohistochemical techniques, as well as the identification of complementary molecular markers that may refine LVD determination and improve predictive accuracy. Such efforts will be crucial to translate LVD assessment into a practical tool for personalized management in OSCC patients. 4.2. Limitations of the Study Although our study contributes to existing knowledge on the controversial topic of LVD in OSCC, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, the retrospective design—while consistent with other studies in this field—introduces inherent biases; prospective validation in a larger cohort would provide more robust and clear conclusions. Second, the relatively small cohort size may limit statistical power; expanding the sample size could yield more significant results and enhance understanding of LVD’s prognostic role. Third, reliance on a single immunohistochemical method may affect generalizability, as significant variability exists in LVD assessment due to divergent staining protocols and quantification techniques across studies. Standardization of these methodologies would improve result consistency and interpretability. 5. Conclusions In our cN0 OSCC cohort, PLVD was significantly higher than ILVD. PLVD was also significantly higher in early-stage tumors (pT1/pT2) compared to advanced stages (pT3/pT4). ILVD showed a significant association with OLNM. No significant influence of LVD on OS was observed, although ILVD demonstrated a trend toward poorer outcomes.
