The tumor microenvironment significantly influences the aggressive invasive characteristics of human solid tumors, with the infiltration of immune cells being a defining feature of tumor advancement. Among the diverse cell types present in the tumor microenvironment, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) stand out as crucial regulatory centers in the interplay between tumors and the immune system. Recent developments in single-cell sequencing technologies, combined with an expanding body of research, have revealed the functional diversity and heterogeneity of TAMs, as well as the mechanisms through which they interact within the tumor microenvironment. This indicates that TAMs could represent innovative targets for therapies aimed at tumors, thus promoting the creation of tailored anti-cancer strategies. This article provides a review of the various types of TAMs, their influence on tumor development and progression, their regulatory functions in tumor activities, and the progress in tumor immunotherapy that focuses on targeting TAMs. tumor microenvironment tumor-associated macrophages tumor immunotherapy immune cell tumor treatment The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

They can be broadly categorized into two polarized types: M1 classically activated macrophages and M2 alternatively activated macrophages (  Figure 1 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Figure 1 Classification of tumor-associated macrophages. Diagram illustrating macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment. The transition from M0 macrophages to M1, promoted by LPS and IFN-gamma, supports anti-tumorigenesis. Conversely, M0 to M2 transition, influenced by IL10, IL13, and IL4, promotes tumorigenesis. 3 The function of TAMs 3.1 The immunoregulatory functions of TAMs TAMs are essential in regulating the immune response, playing a significant role in both tumor immune evasion and immune surveillance. In the tumor microenvironment, these macrophages can dampen immune responses through various mechanisms, facilitating the escape of tumor cells from immune detection. For example, TAMs produce the immunosuppressive enzyme IL4I1, which not only restricts T cell proliferation but also encourages the development of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), thus hindering anti-tumor immune activities ( 31 32 33 3.2 The role of TAMs in tumor metastasis TAMs are essential players in the spread of tumors. They take part in the metastatic cascade at multiple stages. In breast cancer, TAMs secrete similar factors which promote the migration of the tumor cells. The transforming growth factor beta-induced protein (TGFBI) and Tenascin C released by TAMs, for example, aid in the movement of ovarian cancer cells. Studies have shown that patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) who have high levels of ascitic proteins secreted by TAMs have decreased progression-free survival ( 34 35 36 3.3 The role of TAMs in tumor drug resistance Research has indicated that in drug-resistant tumors, the ratio of macrophages present within the tumor microenvironment is notably increased, suggesting a role for TAMs in the emergence of drug resistance within tumor tissues ( 37 38 39 in vitro in vivo 40 41 42 43 Overall, the roles of TAMs in immune regulation, metastasis promotion, and drug resistance are notably complex and adaptable. Interventions aimed at modulating their polarization, secretory factors, and associated signaling pathways present promising strategies to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy and to overcome drug resistance (  Figure 2 Figure 2 The functions of tumor-associated macrophages.

Central image represents a TAM. Arrows indicate the influence of TAMs on these processes. 4 The relevant pathways of TAMs in tumors 4.1 TGFβ signaling pathway The TGFβ signaling pathway serves as a pivotal regulatory factor in immunosuppression within the TME, influencing macrophage polarization, tumor cell proliferation, and metastasis ( 44 46 47 48 44 47 49 4.2 WNT signaling pathway The WNT signaling pathway, well-known for its crucial involvement in embryonic development, maintenance of tissue health, and advancement of cancer, has been identified as a significant modulator of the polarization and function of TAMs. When WNT signaling becomes dysregulated in TAMs, it encourages tumor growth, helps in immune evasion, and supports metastasis, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention ( 50 51 52 44 53 54 4.3 PI3K signaling pathway The signaling pathway of PI3K has arisen as a key regulator of TAMs functions, impacting their polarization, metabolic reprogramming, and interactions with various immune and tumor cells ( 55 56 57 58 48 56 57 4.4 TNF signaling pathway TNFα, an essential pro-inflammatory cytokine, regulates the polarization and activity of macrophages via its receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. These receptors initiate unique but interconnected signaling pathways that affect tumor development and immune reactions ( 44 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 This section focuses on the critical signaling pathways and their biological significance of TAMs within the tumor microenvironment, specifically addressing the TGFβ, WNT, PI3K, and TNF pathways. In summary, these pathways collectively drive tumor immune suppression, vascular and lymphatic remodeling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, and therapy resistance by regulating TAMs polarization, metabolic and secretory profiles, as well as interactions with tumor and immune cells. This provides important theoretical and clinical insights for the development of multi-target, combined therapeutic strategies. 5 Therapeutic strategies for TAMs 5.1 Immunotherapy targeting TAMs In recent years, the targeted immunotherapy of TAMs has emerged as a popular research direction in tumor therapy, which may enhance the body’s anti-tumor immune response by regulating TAMs’ function and phenotype. One strategy utilizes chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) – T cells to kill off specific suppressive TAMs groups. Studies suggest that FR-specific CAR – T cells can specifically remove TAMs that are FR-expressing which have an M2-like immunosuppressive phenotype in syngeneic tumor mouse models ( 66 67 5.2 Drug intervention strategies for TAMs The aim of pharmacological intervention is to inhibit tumor growth and progression with the modulation of TAMs functions and activities. Medications directly target TAMs and change their phenotype and functions. In cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), blocking the signaling pathway of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) or using clodronate liposomes to kill macrophages can effectively hinder the growth of the leukemia ( 68 69 5.3 Regulation of TAMs in combined therapy strategies Combination therapy boosts the therapeutic efficacy of tumor therapies by using multiple treatment modalities to cooperate against TAMs. The combination of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib with adoptive cell transfer in melanoma is shown to enhance anti-tumour effect. According to studies, there is increased infiltration of TAMs and Tregs in the tumor microenvironment with dabrafenib monotherapy. However, inclusion of trametinib decreases these immunosuppressive cell populations with an increase in T cell numbers within the tumor, which in turn increases in vivo 70 6 Future perspectives TAMs serve as vital immune regulatory entities within the tumor microenvironment, significantly contributing to the initiation, progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapies. While recent advances in research and therapeutic approaches targeting TAMs have achieved notable milestones, there remain various challenges and opportunities for future investigations. To begin with, the diversity and plasticity of TAMs phenotypes and functions call for a more comprehensive understanding of their underlying molecular mechanisms. By utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as single-cell sequencing, spatial omics, and the integration of multi-omics, scientists aim to elucidate the characteristic heterogeneity and dynamic alterations of TAMs in the tumor microenvironment with greater accuracy, facilitating more targeted interventions. Furthermore, the effective modulation of TAMs polarization to encourage their shift from the pro-tumor M2 phenotype to the anti-tumor M1 phenotype continues to be a key focus for future immunotherapeutic strategies. The emergence of small molecule medications, nanocarrier drug delivery systems, and gene editing tools offers crucial support for this goal. Moreover, approaches leveraging CAR-T cell technology that specifically target and eliminate immunosuppressive TAMs subpopulations exhibit promising potential and are anticipated to improve the efficacy of current anti-tumor immunotherapeutics. The complexity of the tumor immune microenvironment suggests that a singular focus on modulating TAMs alone is unlikely to fundamentally reverse tumor immune suppression. Future combination therapy strategies must explore the intricate interactions between TAMs, other immune cells, tumor cells, and stromal cells. This comprehensive approach aims to establish a multi-dimensional therapeutic network that enhances both the response rate and durability of immunotherapy. Furthermore, clinical translation remains a critical bottleneck that hinders the application of TAMs-related research findings. Future efforts must strengthen the integration of basic research with clinical trials to promote the clinical validation of novel TAMs-targeting drugs and therapeutic regimens. Additionally, identifying suitable populations through biomarkers for personalized treatment is a crucial direction for future research. In summary, future research on TAMs will deeply integrate technological innovations, such as single-cell analysis and multi-omics analysis, with clinical applications. This integration aims to uncover the mechanisms of tumor immune evasion and treatment resistance, promote multidisciplinary collaborative development, and ultimately provide more effective and safer treatment options for cancer patients.
