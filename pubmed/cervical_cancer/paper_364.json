Previous analyses of the EC TME were often limited by a lack of detailed cellular annotations. Integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data offers a comprehensive approach to reconstruct the TME, aiming to uncover novel mechanisms and therapeutic targets. Methods We integrated public scRNA-seq data from 15 EC and 5 normal endometrium samples. Through detailed cell annotation, we performed comprehensive bioinformatic analyses, including pseudotime trajectories, copy number variation, and cell communication, to investigate mechanisms of EC development. Results We identified nine cell types and characterized subpopulations of epithelial, macrophage, lymphocyte, and stromal fibroblast cells. The SOX9+LGR5- epithelial subtype showed elevated malignancy and NFKB pathway enrichment. The M2_like2 macrophage subtype played a critical role, engaging in robust MIF-(CD74+CD44) mediated communication with SOX9+LGR5- cells. Experimental validation confirmed MIF co-expression with E-cadherin in EC tissues. Furthermore, the transcription factor NFKB2 was found to mediate MIF’s effect on the CD44 receptor in malignant epithelial cells. A pericyte-to-fibroblast transition in stromal cells may also support tumor growth, while an increase in CD8 exhausted/Treg cells and a decrease in cytotoxic CD8 cells suggest potential immune evasion. Conclusion Our single-cell analysis details the EC TME landscape, revealing robust communication between M2_like2 macrophages and SOX9+LGR5- epithelial cells. We highlight a key mechanism where NFKB2 mediates MIF’s pro-tumorigenic effects via the CD44 receptor, offering new insights into EC progression and potential therapeutic targets.

It ranks as the second most prevalent among malignant tumors affecting the female reproductive system in China and is the most common in developed countries. 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Overall, in this study, we integrated 15 cases of endometrial cancer and 5 cases of normal data from public databases to restructure the endometrial cancer microenvironment. We provided detailed annotation of important subpopulations and compared our findings with other published studies. Furthermore, we discovered a strong communication between the macrophage subpopulation M2_like2 and the epithelial cell subpopulation SOX9+LGR5-. Experimental validation confirmed that MIF was co-expressed with the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin in EC tissues, with the transcription factor NFKB2 mediating MIF’s effects on the CD44 receptor of SOX9+LGR5- epithelial cells. Methods Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data Preprocessing We acquired publicly available data from databases published by Guo et al. 5 8 10 Appendix Table 1 11 12 Appendix Table 1 Dimensionality Reduction, Clustering, and Annotation Post-normalization, we identified highly variable genes using the FindVariableGenes function in Seurat. These genes were employed for principal component analysis (PCA). 13 14 15 Functional Enrichment Analysis Gene set enrichment analysis was performed on differentially expressed genes using the Gene Ontology (BP, CC, and MF) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database. 16 17 18 19 Estimation of Copy Number Variations (CNVs) We utilized the R package InferCNV ( https://github.com/broadinstitute/inferCNV 20 Pseudotime Analysis We employed the Monocle 2.0 package (version 2.10.0) to analyze single-cell trajectories and infer the continuous process of cell differentiation. 21 RNA Velocity Analysis RNA velocity analysis estimated the change in RNA abundance over time by measuring the ratio of mRNA before and after splicing using standard single-cell sequencing data, which can be applied to study the dynamic differentiation of cell gene expression. RNA velocity analysis was conducted using the Python package scVelo to investigate cell type transitions. 22 SCENIC Analysis We performed SCENIC analysis using pyscenic (version 0.9.19) and the hg19-500bp-upstream-10species database with RcisTarget, GRNboost, and AUCell. The input matrix comprised the normalized expression matrix from Seurat. To compute the regulon activity scores (RAS) of cells, we utilized the pySCENIC Python package for SCENIC analysis. 23 Cell Communication Analysis We employed the CellChat tool 24 TCGA Data Analysis The Transcripts Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads (TPM) data and clinical parameters of Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (TCGA-UCEC) was downloaded using the Bioconductor TCGAbiolinks package (version 2.10.5). 25 Cell Culture All EC cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Ishikawa and KLE cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS, while AN3CA cells were maintained in EMEM with 10% FBS. HEC-1A cells were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 100 mmol/L sodium pyruvate and 10% FBS. RL95-2 cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 with 0.005 mg/mL insulin and 10% FBS. All cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2. When cells reached 80% confluence, they were incubated overnight in serum-free medium, then treated with various concentrations of rhMIF (MCE, HY-P7387) (0, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 50 ng/mL) for 24 hours before being harvested for protein extraction. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection All siRNAs, including the negative control siRNA (#1027281), were purchased from RiboBio, with the target sequences for NFKB2 being stB0003825A/B/C. Transfection was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocols using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). Western Blot Western Blot analysis was performed as described in our previous work. 26 Immunofluorescence To assess the cellular localization of MIF protein in EC tissues, immunofluorescence was employed to label conserved markers. Tissue samples were fixed, dehydrated, and embedded following established protocols. The slides were then incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies, including those against MIF (Proteintech, #20415-1-AP, 1:100) and E-cadherin (CST, #14472, 1:100). After three PBS washes, the slides were incubated with the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. Nuclei were stained with DAPI solution, and the results were observed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. For comparisons between two groups, statistical evaluation was conducted using a two-tailed Student’’s s t P Results Single‐cell Transcriptomic Profiling of Human Endometrial Cancer After stringent filtering, a total of 147,438 single cells were retained for further bioinformatics analysis ( Figure 1A Figure 1B Figure 1C D Figure 1E Figure 1F Figure 1 Provided a comprehensive overview of human endometrial cancer. ( A B C D E F p p p Epithelial Cells in the Endometrial Microenvironment and Increase in the SOX9+LGR5- Proportions To gain a better understanding of the subtypes of epithelial cells, further analysis was conducted by performing re-clustering and dimensionality reduction analysis on epithelial cells from both normal tissue and tumor samples. The UMAP projection revealed that epithelial cells were divided into 9 clusters ( Appendix Figure 1A Figure 2A Appendix Figure 1B Appendix Figure 1C Figure 2B Figure 2 Examined the cell population landscapes of epithelial cells in the endometrial microenvironment. ( A B C D E F G p p p Increase in CNVs in SOX9+LGR5- and Specific Programs Identified Through NMF Algorithm Endometrial cancer originates from epithelial cells. Therefore, it can be assumed that tumor cells undergoing malignant transformation are present within the epithelial tissue. To distinguish the malignant status of cells, we calculated large-scale chromosomal CNVs for each cell type based on the average expression patterns of the genome. We found that the CNV levels in SOX9+LGR5- epithelial cells were significantly higher than those in other cell types. The heatmap revealed extensive amplifications or deletions in SOX9+LGR5- cells ( Figure 2C Appendix Figure 1C Appendix Table 2 Figure 2D Figure 2E Figure 2F Figure 2G Appendix Table 3 Trajectory Analysis Revealed the Lineage and Dynamics of Epithelial Cells Monocle trajectory and RNA velocity analysis were performed on epithelial subtypes to establish their developmental trajectories. Pseudotime analysis revealed that different subtypes formed a relative developmental trajectory, starting from glandular secretory cells and gradually differentiating into SOX9+LGR5- and SOX9+LGR5+ cells, ultimately differentiating into ciliated cells ( Figure 3A Appendix Figure 2A Appendix Figure 2B Appendix Figure 2C Figure 3A Figure 3 Established the trajectory lineage of epithelial cells and identified epithelial subtype-specific gene regulatory transcription. ( A B C D E p p p Identification of Epithelial Subtype-Specific Gene Regulatory Transcription We attempted to identify TFs to better understand the establishment and maintenance of epithelial subtypes in the endometrial cancer tumor microenvironment. To achieve this, we applied the SCENIC algorithm to identify the top five TFs with high activity specific to cell clusters within the epithelial subtypes of endometrial cancer ( Figure 3B C Appendix Figure 2D Figure 3D Figure 3E Macrophages in the Endometrial Microenvironment and Increase of the M2-like2 Proportions To delve deeper into macrophage subtypes and enhance comprehension, we conducted a re-clustering analysis of macrophages in both normal tissue and tumor samples. The UMAP projection unveiled the subdivision of macrophages into 14 clusters ( Appendix Figure 3A B Figure 4A Appendix Figure 3C Figure 4B Figure 4 Examined the cell population landscapes of macrophages in the endometrial microenvironment. ( A B C D E F G p p p Increase of CNVs in Myeloid Cells and Identification of Specific Programs Through NMF The heatmap revealed extensive amplifications or deletions of M2_like2 cells in these cells ( Figure 4C Appendix Table 4 Figure 4D Considering that various subtypes of epithelial cells in tumor tissues exhibited a certain degree of malignancy in the aforementioned results ( Figure 4E Figure 4F Figure 4G Appendix Table 5 Trajectory Analysis Reveals the Lineage and Dynamics of Macrophages Pseudotime analysis disclosed that different subtypes followed a relative developmental trajectory, commencing from monocyte cells, progressively differentiating into M1-like cells, polarizing into M2-like macrophages, and ultimately differentiating into M_remodeling cells, contributing to cellular remodeling functions. Macrophages were notably abundant in tumors and displayed a continuum of macrophage activation states. Compared to normal tissues, monocyte differentiation into macrophages appeared to be less efficient, along with two subtypes of M2 macrophages, differentiated into M_remodeling cells ( Figure 5A Appendix Figure 3D Figure 5B Appendix Figure 3E Figure 5 Established the trajectory lineage of myeloid cells and identified subtype-specific gene regulatory transcription. ( A B C D Identification of Myeloid Subtype-Specific Gene Regulatory Transcription To better comprehend the establishment and maintenance of Myeloid subtypes, we proceeded to identify TFs using the SCENIC algorithm. This analysis aimed to identify the top five TFs with high activity specific to cell clusters within the Myeloid subtypes of the endometrial cancer tumor microenvironment ( Figure 5C D Appendix Figure 4A Figure 5C Lymphocytes in the Endometrial Microenvironment We conducted a re-clustering of lymphocytes to investigate the inherent heterogeneity of the immune microenvironment. The lymphocytes were categorized into 17 clusters, representing 12 cell types, including CD8 exhausted, CD4 naive, CD8 naive, CD4 cytotoxic, CD8 cytotoxic, Proliferation_T, NK cells, Treg, ILC3, B cells, plasma cells, and NKT ( Figure 6A Appendix Figure 5A B Appendix Figure 5C Figure 6B Figure 6 Examined the cell population landscapes of lymphocytes and stromal fibroblasts in the endometrial microenvironment. ( A B C D E p p p Stromal Fibroblasts in the Endometrial Microenvironment Intense stromal reactions are commonly observed in various malignant tumors such as cervical cancer and colorectal cancer. We re-clustered stromal fibroblasts and categorized them into 12 clusters, representing 9 cell types ( Figure 6C Appendix Figure 5D E Appendix Figure 5F Figure 6D Figure 6E Appendix Figure 5G H Figure 6E Appendix Figure 5G H Cell Communication in the Endometrial Microenvironment and Experimental Validation In endometrial cancer epithelial cells, SOX9+ cells displayed significant segmental amplifications or deletions, indicating a high level of malignancy. While current research on endometrial cancer focuses on myeloid cells at a preliminary annotation stage and differentiation trajectory, this study concentrated on myeloid cells in the immune microenvironment to offer fresh insights. M2_like2 macrophages were identified as terminally differentiated cells, with their proportion significantly heightened in the tumor microenvironment. CNVs and gene enrichment analysis suggested a potential pro-cancer role for these cells, leading to their inclusion in the cell communication analysis. Matrix FBs within the stromal fibroblast population exhibited notable changes in the cell evolutionary trajectory, representing the largest proportion of stromal fibroblasts in tumor tissues and significantly increased compared to the normal group. Consequently, this cluster was also included in the cell communication analysis. In this study, we utilized the R package CellChat to conduct a systematic cell communication analysis focusing on SOX9+LGR5-, SOX9+LGR5+, M2_like2, M2_like1, and Matrix FBs, with a specific emphasis on receptor-ligand interactions. Initially, we visualized the overall interaction between the cell groups. Subsequently, through chord plots and heatmaps, we displayed the level of interaction between different cell groups. Figure 7A Figure 7B Figure 7C Figure 7C Appendix Figure 6A B Figure 7 Cell Communication in the Endometrial Microenvironment and Experimental Validation ( A B C D E F G H By progressively narrowing down our focus to the most intense communication, we centered on M2_like2 and SOX9+LGR5- cells. Further ligand analysis unveiled that these cells generated robust signals through MIF-(CD74+CD44) interactions ( Figure 7D Appendix Figure 6C Figure 7E Appendix Table 6 Figure 7F Appendix Figure 7A Figure 7G Appendix Figure 7B Figure 7H Appendix Figure 7C E Gene Expression and Survival Analysis TCGA Data Analysis observed that the mRNA expression levels of MIF and NFKB2 in endometrial cancer tissues were significantly higher than those in the Normal group, whereas the opposite was true for CD44 ( Figure 8A Figure 8B Figure 8 Gene Expression and Survival Analysis. ( A B C p p p By analyzing publicly available endometrial cancer data from TCGA ( https://cancergenome.nih.gov/ Figure 8C Appendix Figure 7F Discussion The tumor microenvironment comprises various components that intricately interact to propel the malignant transformation and progression of endometrial epithelial cells. Single-cell transcriptome analysis has emerged as a pivotal tool for exploring the tumor microenvironment, unraveling its multidimensional intricacies, and delving into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of tumors. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive integration analysis of publicly available scRNA-seq data on EC, aiming to restructure the microenvironment at a single-cell resolution. In addition to insights gleaned from existing literature on single-cell analysis of EC, this study also referenced markers linked to normal menstrual cycles and other markers specific to endometrial cells. 27–30 In this study, we consulted multiple studies on the endometrium and furnished detailed annotations of epithelial cells, encompassing the SOX9+ cell types (SOX9+LGR5- and SOX9+LGR5+), glandular secretory epithelial cells, and ciliated epithelial cells. This study serves as the comprehensive report on epithelial cell annotations in EC research. Our study unveiled that the menstrual cycle in EC deviated from normal conditions, leading to the manifestation of characteristics of both glandular secretory epithelial cells and ciliated epithelial cells in SOX9+ cell types. In essence, these cells transitioned from glandular secretory epithelial cells. Guo et al 5 8 30 A prior study identified LCN2+/SAA1/2+ cells as a distinct subgroup associated with endometrial tumor development. 8 31 32 This study corroborated the previous findings, illustrating the phenomenon of macrophage polarization from M1 to M2. Macrophages adhered to the continuum activation model. However, our research indicated that M_remodeling cells represented the terminal differentiation state, potentially influencing extracellular matrix remodeling. 33 Cell communication analysis suggested that M2_like2 cells exert varying degrees of influence on non-immune cells, underscoring their pivotal role in the tumor immune microenvironment. Through the evolution of macrophages, functional enrichment analysis, and the heightened expression of specific marker genes, the M2_like2 cells delineated in this study likely corresponded to the same cluster as the C1QC+ macrophages mentioned in Guo et al’s research. Beyond published research, this study identified a cell cluster, M2_like1, characterized by elevated expression of TNF and MAF genes. 33 Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) serves as a versatile protein with dual roles as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and a chemotactic factor, regulating the expression of other pro-inflammatory factors. 34 35 36 36 37 38 39 40 41 Our investigation into lymphocytes corroborated existing research, revealing a notable increase in Treg cells in EC. 8 Our study delved into the evolutionary trajectory of stromal fibroblasts, where activated stromal fibroblasts differentiated into myofibroblasts and pericytes. Myofibroblasts play a crucial role in tissue repair by producing collagen in response to damage. 42 6 8 43 44 The primary strength of this study lied in its comprehensive, integrated analysis of multiple single-cell datasets, which allowed for a detailed annotation of the EC microenvironment. Critically, we moved beyond computational prediction by providing experimental validation for the key identified MIF-NFKB2-CD44 signaling axis. We acknowledged, however, certain limitations and nuances. For instance, while high CD44 expression was prognostic in bulk survival data, its upstream regulators MIF and NFKB2 were not. This highlighted a broader limitation of retrospective data and underscores that many of our other findings remain predictive. Therefore, future work is essential to validate these interactions and explore their therapeutic potential. A key clinical application lies in refining patient selection for Fertility-Sparing Treatment, where understanding the tumor’s “molecular fingerprint” is paramount for success. 45 46 In conclusion, our study unveiled a detailed transcriptomic landscape of human EC, shedding light on the EC microenvironment and emphasizing the significant communication between the M2_like2 macrophage subpopulation and the SOX9+LGR5- epithelial cell subpopulation. NFKB2 was identified as a mediator of MIF activity through the CD44 receptor in EC, providing deeper insights into cancer initiation and progression.
