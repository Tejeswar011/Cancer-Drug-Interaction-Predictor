However, its prognostic significance in thyroid cancer, particularly papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), remains largely unexplored and somewhat controversial, with findings to date being limited and inconsistent. The aim of this study was to evaluate PD-L1 expression in a well-characterized cohort of patients with PTC and assess its association with key clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: This retrospective, single-center cohort study included patients with histologically confirmed PTC who underwent thyroid surgery at the Korgialenio-Benakio Hellenic Red Cross Hospital of Athens in Greece between 2007 and 2018. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples were assessed for PD-L1 expression using immunohistochemistry and scored using the combined positive score (CPS), with CPS ≥10 indicating PD-L1 positivity. Clinicopathological data were collected through review of patients’ medical records and postoperative histopathology reports, and associations with PD-L1 status were analyzed. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were also evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Results: Among 81 patients with PTC included in this study (median age: 48 years, 61/81 (83%) patients being female), PD-L1 positivity (CPS ≥10) was observed in 37/81 (45.7%) patients. CPS ≥10 status was significantly associated with larger tumor size, higher pT stage (pT3-pT4, as per the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification), extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, and the presence of aggressive histologic variants. Coexisting Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and higher rates of radioactive iodine therapy were also more common in the PD-L1-positive group. At a median follow-up of nine years, the overall recurrence rate was 8.6% (7/81 patients), with significantly higher recurrence and shorter DFS among patients with CPS ≥10. OS remained high across both groups. Conclusions: PD-L1 expression was present in nearly half of this real-world Greek PTC cohort and was associated with multiple adverse clinicopathological features and an increased risk of recurrence. These findings support the potential utility of PD-L1 as a prognostic biomarker in PTC and may inform postoperative risk stratification and follow-up strategies, although further prospective studies in larger, multicenter cohorts are warranted to corroborate these results. clinicopathological marker immune checkpoint immunohistochemistry papillary thyroid carcinoma pd-l1 prognostic biomarker programmed death-ligand 1 thyroid cancer tumor immune microenvironment pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system. It ranks as the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, with over 821,000 new cases annually (4.1% of all cancer cases) [ 1 1 2 3 4 5 This surge in TC incidence has been largely driven by papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), which represents the predominant histological type, accounting for nearly 90% of all TC cases [ 3 6 7 8 9 Interestingly, a growing body of evidence highlights the tumor immune microenvironment as a key driver of tumor progression. In fact, tumors can shape their immune microenvironment to create an immunosuppressive milieu that allows them to evade immune surveillance, primarily by exploiting immune checkpoint pathways such as the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis [ 10 9 11 9 In TC, PD-L1 has also been evolving as a potential prognostic biomarker [ 11 7 9 12 14 7 9 Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate PD-L1 expression in a Greek cohort of patients with PTC and assess its association with key clinicopathological characteristics. By further investigating this relationship, we sought to explore the potential of PD-L1 as a prognostic biomarker in PTC. Materials and methods Study design and patient population This was a retrospective, single-center cohort study of adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of PTC following thyroid surgery at the Korgialenio-Benakio Hellenic Red Cross Hospital of Athens in Greece between 2007 and 2018, ensuring a minimum of five years of follow-up at the time of analysis. Eligible patients had a primary tumor size ≥0.5 cm and adequate clinical and histopathological data, defined as complete documentation of the key variables pertinent to the study objectives, as described below. No exclusion criteria were applied, and patients were not excluded on the basis of comorbidities or other clinical characteristics. Archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from these patients' primary tumors were retrieved from the pathology laboratory archives of the Department of Pathology of the hospital and assessed for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Patient demographics, perioperative data, and postoperative clinicopathological data were collected through retrospective review of medical records and histopathology reports. Demographic characteristics included gender and age at the time of surgery, with patients categorized into two age groups: <55 years and ≥55 years. Perioperative data comprised preoperative clinical impression, extent of surgery (hemithyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy), performance of lymph node dissection and/or laryngectomy, and surgical complications (if any). Postoperative clinicopathological data included tumor characteristics such as maximum tumor diameter, pT stage, lymph node involvement (pN stage), number and location of metastatic lymph nodes, presence of distant metastasis (M stage), tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, histologic subtype, and presence and type of aggressive histological variants. Tumor staging (pT, pN, M, and TNM) was based on the 8th edition (2017) of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classification [ 15 The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and all applicable local regulations. Ethical approval was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital. As this was a retrospective study using archived FFPE tissue specimens, the requirement for informed consent was waived. All patient data and tissue specimens were pseudoanonymized before analysis to ensure confidentiality. IHC staining The FFPE tumor tissue blocks were cut into 4-μm sections (two per patient), mounted on positively charged glass slides, and then placed in an oven at 58°C ± 2°C for 1 hour. PD-L1 IHC staining was performed using the FDA-approved PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx assay (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) on the Dako Autostainer Link 48 (code AS480), according to the manufacturer’s instructions [ 16 PD-L1 expression was then assessed by an experienced, independent pathologist blinded to clinicopathological data using a light microscope (20× magnification). Scoring was based on the combined positive score (CPS), calculated as the number of PD-L1-positive cells (including tumor cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumor cells, multiplied by 100. Convincing partial or complete linear membrane staining (≥1+) of viable tumor cells, perceived as distinct from cytoplasmic staining, was scored as positive, as was convincing membrane and/or cytoplasmic staining (≥1+) of lymphocytes and macrophages within tumor nests and/or immediately adjacent supporting stroma. A minimum of 100 viable tumor cells per tissue section was required for the section to be considered adequate for PD-L1 evaluation. A CPS ≥10 was considered positive [ 16 17 Statistical analysis No a priori sample size calculation was performed, as the study was retrospective in nature and based on available medical records. To ensure feasibility while maintaining representativeness, a random sample of 100 patients with a histopathological diagnosis of PTC during the study period was selected. Descriptive statistics were primarily used to summarize the data. Categorical variables were reported as relative and absolute frequencies, while continuous variables were summarized based on the number of available observations (n), mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. All variables are presented both overall and stratified by PD-L1 CPS, using a cut-off of 10. To examine associations, the independent t-test and chi-square test were applied when statistical assumptions were met; otherwise, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher’s exact test were used. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the time from surgery until the first documented disease recurrence, while overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from surgery until death from any cause. Patients who were alive and recurrence-free at the time of analysis were censored at the date of last available information, as determined from medical records or national registry data. Only deaths confirmed to be the result of the disease were counted as events; other deaths were censored at the time of death. Time-to-event outcomes were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences in DFS and OS by CPS status were assessed using the log-rank test. Statistical analysis was performed using R version 4.4.3 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The level of statistical significance was set at α=0.05. Results Patient demographics and perioperative characteristics Of the 100 randomly selected patients, 19 were excluded due to missing or incomplete clinical or histopathological data (n=9) or unavailability of adequate FFPE tissue blocks for PD-L1 assessment (n=10). Thus, a total of 81 patients with a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of PTC following thyroid surgery between 2007 and 2018 were included in the study. Key patient demographic and perioperative characteristics are summarized in Table 1 The most common preoperative clinical impression was thyroid carcinoma, either localized (28/81 (34.6%)) or with suspected metastatic disease (13/81 (16.0%)); the latter often first identified through a malignant cervical lymph node. Other indications for thyroid surgery included multinodular goiter (23/81 (28.4%)), solitary thyroid nodule (11/81 (13.6%)), substernal goiter (3/81 (3.7%)), and Graves’ disease (3/81 (3.7%)). All patients underwent total thyroidectomy. Concomitant lymph node dissection was performed in 21/81 (25.9%) patients, all involving the central compartment, with or without lateral compartment dissection (11/81 (13.6%) and 10/81 (12.3%), respectively). Laryngectomy was performed in only 2/81 (2.5%) patients. Most patients did not experience surgical complications (58/81 (71.6%)), while transient hypocalcemia occurred in 17/81 (21.0%), transient recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis in 5/81 (6.2%), and permanent hypocalcemia in 1/81 (1.2%) (Table 1 Table 1 Patient demographic and perioperative clinical characteristics.

In contrast, extrathyroidal extension was identified in 29/81 (35.8%) patients. Most patients had unifocal disease (49/81 (60.5%)), with the number of tumor foci ranging from 1 to 7 (median: 1), and bilaterality was observed in 18/81 (22.2%) patients. Lymph node metastases were present in 18/81 (22.2%) patients, with 6/81 (7.4%) having central compartment involvement only (N1a), while 12/81 (14.8%) had both central and lateral compartment involvement, corresponding to N1b staging. Distant metastasis to the lungs (M1) was documented in a single patient (1/81 (1.2%)). According to the 8th edition of the AJCC TNM staging system [ 15 2 The predominant histologic subtype was follicular (36/81 (44.4%) patients), followed by mixed papillary-follicular (33/81 (40.7%) patients) and classical papillary carcinoma (12/81 (14.8%) patients). Aggressive histologic variants, including tall cell, columnar cell, hobnail, solid, and diffuse sclerosing patterns, were identified in 18/81 (22.2%) patients. Other concurrent thyroid neoplasms were rare, observed in only 5/81 (6.2%) patients. Coexisting Hashimoto’s thyroiditis was present in 23/81 (28.4%) patients. PD-L1 positivity (CPS ≥10) was observed in 37 (45.7%) of the total cohort. Stratification by PD-L1 status revealed several significant clinicopathological differences between the CPS ≥10 and CPS <10 groups. In detail, tumors in the CPS ≥10 group were significantly larger (median: 1.20 cm vs. 0.50 cm, p=0.002) and more frequently associated with advanced primary tumor stage. Specifically, 24/37 (64.9%) patients in the CPS ≥10 group were classified as pT3-pT4, compared to only 6/44 (13.6%) patients in the CPS <10 group (p<0.001), whereas pT1-pT2 tumors were more common in the CPS <10 group (38/44 (86.4%) vs. 13/37 (35.1%)). CPS ≥10 also demonstrated higher rates of extrathyroidal extension (24/37 (64.9%) vs. 5/44 (11.4%), p<0.001) and lymph node metastasis (17/37 (45.9%) vs. 1/44 (2.3%), p<0.001), with significantly higher frequency of lateral compartment involvement (N1b: 11/37 (29.7%) vs. 1/44 (2.3%)). Aggressive histologic variants were substantially overrepresented in the CPS ≥10 group (16/37 (43.2%) vs. 2/44 (4.5%), p<0.001). Although bilaterality (11/37 (29.7%) vs. 7/44 (15.9%)) and multifocality (17/37 (45.9%) vs. 15/44 (34.1%)) were more frequent in the CPS ≥10 group, these differences did not reach statistical significance (p=0.14 and p=0.2, respectively). However, a significantly greater proportion of patients in the CPS ≥10 group had ≥4 tumor foci (9/37 (24.3%) vs. 2/44 (4.5%), p=0.034). Coexisting Hashimoto’s thyroiditis was also more prevalent among patients with CPS ≥10 (17/37 (45.9%) vs. 6/44 (13.6%), p<0.001). Finally, RAI was more commonly administered in patients in the CPS ≥10 group (30/37 (81.1%) vs. 14/44 (31.8%), p<0.001), consistent with the higher-risk pathological features observed.

Discussion The expression of PD-L1 is a well-established prerequisite for the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors and has been increasingly recognized and used as a prognostic biomarker in several malignancies [ 9 In terms of overall clinical characteristics, patients in this cohort were predominantly female (75.3%) with a median age of 48 years, consistent with the known epidemiology of PTC, which is more common in women and typically diagnosed in the fourth to fifth decades of life [ 1 2 18 Notably, nearly half of our cohort (45.7%) exhibited PD-L1 positivity (CPS ≥10), a prevalence falling in the middle of the broad range reported in the literature (6.1% to 82.5%) [ 19 27 9 20 23 28 19 21 22 25 27 22 24 26 A significant association was also identified between PD-L1 expression and coexisting Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, in line with findings from previous studies and confirmed by meta-analyses [ 12 13 20 22 23 25 27 28 28 25 At a median follow-up of nine years, disease recurrence was observed in 8.6% of our cohort, which falls within the known ranges for low- to intermediate-risk PTC populations [ 18 12 14 Interestingly, patients with PD-L1-positive tumors were more likely to receive adjuvant RAI therapy. While PD-L1 status was not used to guide treatment, this likely reflects the association of PD-L1 expression with high-risk pathological features that influence adjuvant decision-making. Although this observation does not establish a direct clinical role for PD-L1, it highlights the relevance of PD-L1-positive status in current management patterns and supports its further evaluation as a potential marker for individualized risk stratification. Discrepancies in reported PD-L1 expression and its clinicopathological associations across studies may stem from variability in tissue preparation, IHC assays, PD-L1 antibody clones, scoring systems, cut-off values, and interpretation criteria [ 9 12 29 19 22 26 27 16 17 Further heterogeneity arises from the use of different antibody clones (e.g., E1L3N, SP142, 22C3, SP263, and Ab174838 19 29 29 29 30 9 Our study has several limitations. First, although patients were randomly sampled, eligibility required the availability of adequate tissue material and complete clinical and histopathological data. This may have inadvertently introduced selection bias by excluding patients with incomplete records or insufficient specimens, thereby limiting the representativeness of the broader PTC population treated in our hospital. In addition, the retrospective and observational nature of the study precludes causal inference, so the associations identified should be regarded as exploratory and hypothesis-generating, rather than definitive. The absence of multivariate adjustment further limits interpretation, as it precludes assessment of whether PD-L1 expression is independently associated with adverse features or recurrence, or whether the observed associations are confounded by established prognostic factors such as tumor size, stage, extrathyroidal extension, nodal status, or histologic subtype. External validity is also limited. The single-center setting and modest sample size restrict generalizability, as the cohort may not capture the full spectrum of patients with PTC encountered in more diverse clinical settings. The ethnically homogeneous Greek population further narrows applicability, while the predominance of early-stage disease may underestimate the potential relevance of PD-L1 expression in advanced PTC, where immune evasion mechanisms are expected to play a greater role. Although the median follow-up was sufficient to capture early recurrences, the lack of active, prospective follow-up and reliance solely on medical record review may have resulted in under-detection of late or asymptomatic events, particularly given the typically indolent course of PTC. The limited number of recurrence and mortality events further reduces the statistical power to draw firm prognostic conclusions. Additionally, due to the retrospective nature of the study and variability in documentation, we were unable to systematically distinguish between structural and biochemical recurrence. While a subset of patients received adjuvant RAI or lymph node dissection during follow-up, the indication (e.g., rising thyroglobulin vs. imaging findings) was not consistently available. Of note, serum thyroglobulin levels were not included in our data collection process, as they were not uniformly documented in the medical records. This precluded further evaluation of biochemical recurrence and potential associations with PD-L1 expression. Prospective studies with standardized data collection would be better positioned to address such aspects. Moreover, PD-L1 expression was assessed using CPS ≥10, a threshold not yet validated in TC; while considered appropriate for the objectives of this study, exploring additional thresholds or alternative scoring systems (e.g., TPS) could yield further insights into PD-L1 expression dynamics and prognostic relevance. Lastly, molecular alterations such as BRAF mutations were not assessed, as their evaluation was beyond the scope and resources of this study. This omission limits further interpretation of potential interactions between PD-L1 expression and oncogenic drivers in PTC. Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, this is the first study to provide real-world data on PD-L1 expression in a well-defined cohort of patients with PTC in Greece, thereby contributing to the limited literature on this topic. Methodological rigor was ensured through the use of an FDA-approved, clinically validated IHC assay, blinded scoring, and detailed clinicopathological information, which enhances the robustness of our exploratory findings and highlights their potential clinical significance. However, to better understand the independent prognostic role of PD-L1 and establish its clinical utility, future research should ideally include larger, prospective, multicenter cohorts with extended follow-up, integration of molecular profiling, and multivariate analyses. Conclusions Our study underscores a potential association between PD-L1 expression and adverse clinicopathological features in PTC. While these findings may support the relevance of PD-L1 as a surrogate biomarker of tumor aggressiveness and suggest its potential utility in risk stratification, they should be interpreted with caution, given the study’s limitations, including its retrospective design, limited sample size, and inability to support causal inferences. Looking ahead, future prospective, multicenter studies with larger cohorts are warranted to validate these findings and further elucidate the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in appropriately selected PTC populations.
