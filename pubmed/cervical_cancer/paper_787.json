Regulatory RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), play crucial roles in modulating messenger RNAs (mRNAs) expression and are potential molecules that regulate multifactorial neurotoxicity mechanisms. Integrated studies of regulatory RNAs’ functions are still lacking to portray the complete picture. In this study, we carried out a detailed analysis of mRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA profiles in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exposed to arsenic, a well-known neurotoxicant, using the Illumina Novaseq6000 platform. Subsequently, employing a bioinformatics approach, we identified specific interactions between these RNA molecules and potential miRNAs, unraveling intricate regulatory networks. Results Among significantly deregulated transcripts, we identified 2487 mRNA transcripts, 1192 lncRNA transcripts, and 20 circRNA transcripts in arsenic-treated cells compared to control. Functional enrichment analysis indicated their involvement in numerous pathways underlying neurotoxicity. Further, these regulatory molecules displayed strong interactions with multiple miRNAs implicated in neuronal damage. Conclusion Our findings revealed intricate molecular alterations in response to arsenic exposure, emphasizing the crucial role of multi-omics technologies in understanding neurodegeneration. This approach has enabled the identification of potential targets for future exploration, emphasizing the precise modulation of regulatory RNA networks to mitigate the effects of arsenic.

These intricate phenomena have been associated with significant alterations in the genome-wide expression at both genetic and epigenetic levels [ 1 2 3 3 3 6 RNA is broadly classified into two main types: messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in accordance with their coding potential, structure, and function. According to their length, non-coding RNAs are categorized into the following groups: microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs). MiRNAs regulate the expression of their target mRNAs by inhibiting translation (perfect binding) or directly triggering the cleavage of mRNA (imperfect binding). Furthermore, endogenously synthesized RNAs like lncRNA and circRNA possess the miRNA binding domain, which may reduce the repression of target mRNAs by miRNAs [ 7 8 10 11 14 More recently, circRNAs have been emerging as key regulators in neurodegenerative diseases, influencing gene expression through mechanisms such as miRNA sponging and interaction with RBPs. In AD, circRNAs like CDR1 antisense RNA (CDR1as), circRNA neurofibromin 1‐419 (circNF1‐419), circRNA histone deacetylase (circHDAC9), circRNA actin‐binding protein 1C (circCORO1C), and circRNA spliceosome‐associated cyclophilin (circCwc27) modulate the levels of key proteins involved in amyloid-beta or SNCA clearance and synaptic function [ 15 19 20 22 23 24 25 26 Recent developments in omics technology have proven to be the most effective tool for dissecting the abnormal cellular processes and pathways that drive the development and progression of poly-factorial neurodegenerative disorders. Owing to the lack of direct regulatory relationships between mRNAs, miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, focusing on one approach, either the transcriptome, microRNAome, lncRNAome, or circRNAome, may result in only a partial explanation or even a misinterpretation of the biological response. For complex interpretation and reliable outcomes, omics integration is an ideal approach. Moreover, multi-omics techniques, including the multidimensional investigation of neuronal cells, have the potential to reveal the complex biochemical mechanisms underlying various hallmarks of neurodegeneration [ 27 The interplay among aging, genetic susceptibility, and environmental factors is well-established in neurodegenerative conditions. There are a number of neurological illnesses that have been linked to long-term exposure to environmental pollutants, including heavy metals. Arsenic toxicity is a global environmental challenge because more than 230 million people around the world are exposed to potentially hazardous levels of arsenic [ 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 36 Despite the abundance of evidence elucidating the significant contributions of coding and non-coding RNAs to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration, there exists a notable gap in the exploration of integrated multi-omics data, specifically within the context of neurotoxicant exposure. While mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs have been widely studied for their involvement in neurodegeneration, yet are rarely contextualized in integrated studies within toxin-induced environments. Furthermore, prior studies have investigated the impact of arsenic on individual RNA species or epigenetic markers, but integrative multi-omics analysis assessing regulatory networks is lacking for arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. CircRNAs, although abundant in the brain and well-characterized in cancer for their stability and miRNA sponging capabilities, are vastly underexplored in neurotoxicology despite their potential roles in neural homeostasis and disease progression. The lack of integration across transcriptomic and epigenomic layers hinders a comprehensive understanding of how these RNA species interact to mediate neurodegenerative processes, underscoring the need for systems-level analysis to uncover novel regulatory networks and therapeutic targets. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate general neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative mechanisms by conducting an integrative assessment of RNA sequencing and in silico analysis in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells subjected to arsenic exposure. This approach would reveal coordinated regulatory mechanisms that underlie neuronal dysfunction, allowing the identification of key regulatory nodes and potential targets for future exploration. Figure 1 Fig. 1 A schematic overview of the study Materials and methods Reagents and chemicals SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line (Catalogue No. SH-SY5Y CRL-2266) was acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), USA. The authenticity and purity report of the obtained SH-SY5Y cells via short tandem repeat (STR) profiling is available on the ATCC site. Further, this cell line does not appear on the International Cell Line Authentication Committee’s database of commonly misidentified cell lines ( http://iclac.org/databases/cross-contaminations/ Cell culture, differentiation, and arsenic exposure The present study employed the human SH SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line as an in vitro model to investigate integrative molecular alterations induced by arsenic exposure. This in vitro model was selected due to its ability to acquire mature neuron-like characteristics upon differentiation, including neurite extension, synapse formation, cessation of proliferation, and expression of neuronal markers [ 37 37 5 5 37 39 Differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to 10 μM of arsenic for 24 h (h), following the method outlined in our prior studies [ 37 38 37 38 38 37 RNA isolation, quantification, quality assessment, real-time PCR, and sequencing Following the manufacturer’s guidelines, total RNA was extracted employing the mirVana miRNA kit. The concentration and purity of RNA were evaluated using a BioSpectrometer of Eppendorf Scientific, Germany. Sample absorbance was measured at 260 nm and 280 nm, and the ratios of 260/280 and 260/230 were used for the assessment of RNA purity. For the examination of the RNA banding pattern, agarose gel electrophoresis was conducted using 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. The bands of RNA were visualized using the ChemiDoc™ MP Imaging System (BIO-RAD). SYBR green chemistry was employed for real-time PCR of expression analysis of human genes such as Synapsin-1 (SYN-1), Synaptophysin (SYP), Neurofilament-M (NF-M), and β-III tubulin using QuantStudio™ 6 Flex system. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: an initial hold stage at 50 °C for 2 min, followed by a denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min. PCR amplification was carried out for 40 cycles, each consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 1 min. A melt curve analysis was performed post-amplification with the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 1 min, followed by a gradual temperature increase to 95 °C at a ramp rate of 0.05 °C/second with continuous fluorescence acquisition. A total reaction volume of 5 µl was maintained per well in a 384-well PCR plate. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endogenous control. The details of primers employed for real-time PCR are provided in Table S1. Sequencing was performed by the Molsys scientific company (Bengaluru, Karnataka, India) using the Illumina (Novaseq6000) platform. For sequencing, RNA from control and arsenic-treated SH-SY5Y cells was isolated and subjected to quality assessment as described above. The processes of quality control, trimming, alignment, normalization, and annotation were outsourced to Molsys and performed using established bioinformatics tools. All functional enrichment and network analysis for mRNA, lncRNA, circRNA, and miRNA were conducted in-house using established and validated computational tools. The sample size optimization employing the Power analysis technique, library preparation, and quality assessment of the raw fastq reads are detailed in the supplementary information. The brief overview of sequencing workflow and enrichment analysis of identified mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs is depicted in Fig. S1. MA plots and volcano plots were created using the plotMA and EnhancedVolcano utilities of DESeq2, respectively. The sequencing data is submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)-Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo GSE278489 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE278489 In-silico analysis for target prediction and pathway enrichment Functional annotations, including the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, Gene Ontology (GO), Reactome pathway, etc., of differentially expressed mRNAs were primarily conducted using the DAVID online platform ( http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ https://metascape.org https://string-db.org/ LncRNA enrichment analysis was done using the LncSEA server with default parameters and P ., http://geneyun.net/CSCD2/ https://www.webgestalt.org/ https://www.mirnet.ca http://62.217.122.229/app/miRPathv4 Statistical analysis To ensure robust statistical power, the current study included a minimum of three biological replicates per group (Control and Arsenic-exposed differentiated SH-SY5Y cells), providing at least 80% power to detect differential gene expression.

KEGG analysis suggested that the upregulated mRNAs may be associated with pathways such as hematopoietic cell lineage, tyrosine metabolism, ECM-receptor interaction, complement and coagulation cascades, cell adhesion molecules, mineral absorption, MAPK signaling pathway and others while downregulated mRNAs were potentially linked with pathways like alcoholism, systemic lupus erythematosus, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, cell cycle, viral carcinogenesis, p53 signaling pathway, axon guidance, DNA replication, and pyrimidine metabolism (Fig. 4 4 4 4 4 Fig. 4 KEGG and GO pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs. Top 20 significantly enriched ( P a b c e g d f h mRNA: construction of Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) networks Interaction network analysis was conducted to generate PPI networks of differentially expressed mRNAs employing the STRING algorithm. Findings of STRING analysis demonstrated that upregulated mRNAs are functionally interconnected and may be involved in processes such as negative regulation of cell proliferation (nodes: 45, edges: 38), inflammatory response (nodes: 43, edges: 115), response to hypoxia (nodes: 20, edges: 18), negative regulation of cell growth (nodes: 15, edges: 4), positive regulation of apoptotic process (nodes: 35, edges: 27), activation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process (nodes: 10, edges: 6), response to unfolded protein (nodes: 19, edges: 89), and cell–cell signaling (nodes: 28, edges: 20) (Fig. 5 6 2  Fig. 5 String analysis of upregulated mRNAs.

Disconnected nodes in the network have been removed mRNA: metascape enrichment analysis (disease associations, pathway & cluster insights, tissue specificity, and regulatory context) Functional enrichment analysis of upregulated and downregulated mRNAs was also carried out employing the Metascape, a resource for gene annotation and analysis (Figs. 7 8 7 8 7 8 7 8 Fig. 7 Metascape enrichment analysis of upregulated mRNAs in arsenic-exposed differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. a b c d e f g h Fig. 8 Metascape enrichment analysis of downregulated mRNAs in arsenic-exposed differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. a b c d e f g h Expression profiles and enrichment analysis of lncRNAs lncRNA: profile overview Using Illumina (Novaseq6000) platform-based sequencing, 1192 lncRNA transcripts (715 upregulated and 477 downregulated) were identified to be significantly deregulated in arsenic-exposed differentiated SH-SY5Y cells compared to the control.

In the results section of the ‘Experimental_Validated_Function’ category, we found that upregulated lncRNAs were significantly enriched in functions potentially related to cancer progression, cell invasion, cell proliferation, tumorigenesis, chemoresistance, cell growth, and cell migration (Fig. 10 10 10 Fig. 10 Enrichment analysis of identified lncRNAs in arsenic-exposed differentiated SH-SY5Y cells.

GO functional analysis of host genes of circRNAs exhibiting differential expression in arsenic-exposed differentiated SH-SY5Y cells was grouped into different functional categories: a b c d P Association analysis of identified mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs with potential miRNAs Construction of mRNA-lncRNA-circRNA-miRNA networks Extensive evidence has demonstrated that lncRNAs and circRNAs can function as competitive endogenous RNA by binding to miRNAs via their miRNA response elements and thus controlling the expression of the miRNA target i.e., mRNA. An integrated analysis was conducted to unveil the interactions of differentially expressed lncRNAs, circRNAs, and mRNAs with miRNAs, utilizing the online tool miRNet ( https://www.mirnet.ca 14 14 Fig. 14 Integrated network of mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs along with targeting miRNAs. a b Pathway and functional enrichment analysis of targeting miRNAs KEGG, Reactome, and GO enrichment analysis were carried out to identify the significant pathways and processes regulated by targeting miRNAs. The findings of KEGG and Reactome pathways enrichment analysis revealed that targeting miRNAs may be associated with pathways such as autophagy, cell cycle, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, axon guidance, pathways of neurodegeneration (multiple diseases), transcription, metabolism of proteins, protein trafficking, cellular response to stress, signaling by Rho GTPases, chromatin organization, cellular senescence and others (Fig. 15 15 15 Fig. 15 KEGG and GO pathway enrichment analysis of targeting miRNAs. a P b b c d Discussion The present study hypothesized that arsenic exposure disrupts neuronal integrity by altering the expression of coding and non-coding RNAs and their regulatory interactions, ultimately contributing to neuronal damage. Our prior work extensively revealed miRNA-mediated neurotoxicant responses in neuronal cells [ 38 40 41 P 2 Many of the enriched pathways, including disruptions in ECM-receptor interactions, focal adhesion, cell adhesion molecules, tyrosine metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway, protein refolding, unfolded protein response, cell cycle, axon guidance, RNA transport, and autophagy, identified in the present study closely align with mechanisms previously associated with neurodegeneration [ 42 52 42 43 44 45 47 48 52 Neuronal apoptosis is a crucial aspect of various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and PD. Studies employing autopsies have demonstrated a significant number of apoptotic neurons in the hippocampus and brain cortex of AD patients, as well as apoptotic death of dopaminergic neurons in both PD patients and experimental models [ 53 55 56 57 58 59 62 In our miRNet-based target prediction studies, HMOX1 was identified as a target for multiple miRNAs, including hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-335-5p, hsa-miR-103a-3p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-miR-101-3p, hsa-miR-124-3p, hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-21-3p, hsa-miR-128-3p, hsa-miR-24-3p and others. These targeting miRNAs are implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases [ 63 72 63 64 66 68 70 75 76 77 78 78 79 78 80 79 81 Several interconnected processes are crucial in comprehending the complex mechanisms underlying neuronal apoptosis across various neurological disorders. The intricate interplay of cell cycle aberrations, inflammation, protein aggregation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction collectively contributes to the cascade of events resulting in neuronal death. Investigating the crosstalk of mRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs, and miRNAs in these processes is imperative to gain a comprehensive molecular understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative conditions. Neurons exhibiting abnormal cell cycle activity have been detected in association with various neurodegenerative disorders [ 82 83 + 84 89 Expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) increases in neurodegenerative conditions, helping to prevent protein misfolding and abnormal deposition [ 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 101 102 Our results from mRNA analysis indicated a significant upregulation of oxidative stress-responsive genes such as HMOX1, NQO1, G6PD, SLC7A11, SRXN1, SESN2, GCLM, CRYAB, HBA1, and HBA2 in arsenic-treated SH-SY5Y cells. HMOX1 and NQO1 are major signatures of oxidative stress, and their elevation has been linked with a number of neurodegenerative and neuropathological alterations [ 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 Our target prediction analysis using miRNet identified that hsa-miR-27a-3p was negatively correlated with the upregulation of several metallothioneins, such as MT1E, MT1F, MT1G, MT1H, and MT2A. There is a conflicting pattern in the expression of miR-27a-3p in neurological conditions. In AD, the expression of miR-27a-3p is elevated, particularly in the presence of depression [ 113 114 115 93 73 75 116 72 117 Furthermore, our miRNet analysis revealed a noteworthy regulatory connection between hsa-miR-27a-3p, hsa-let-7b-5p, hsa-miR-22-3p, hsa-miR-1301-3p, and LINC02381- a lncRNA which exhibited significant downregulation in arsenic-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Lu et al. (2022) and Yin et al. (2022) have independently provided evidence of a substantial correlation between LINC02381 and miR-27a-3p, as well as LINC02381 and miR-1301-3p in their respective studies [ 118 119 120 123 124 129 Our findings also revealed a significant increase in the lncRNA SATB2-AS1, suggesting its role in diseases like astrocytoma, colorectal cancer, osteosarcoma, and AD, as revealed by enrichment analysis. SATB2-AS1 is documented to exert inhibitory effects on both cell proliferation and glycolytic metabolism while inducing apoptosis in glioma cells [ 130 131 132 134 DisGeNET analysis using Metascape suggested that upregulated mRNAs may be associated with various neurological diseases. Several serpins, including SERPINE1, SERPINE2, SERPINA3, SERPINF2, and SERPINB8, exhibited significant upregulation in arsenic-exposed differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Serpins belong to a superfamily of serine protease inhibitors, which are synthesized by astrocytes in the brain and are implicated in processes associated with neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation [ 135 136 137 138 136 139 140 Neuron navigator 3 (NAV3), which belongs to the neuron navigator protein family, was significantly increased in arsenic-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. NAV3 is predominantly present in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, and its expression is notably elevated in degenerating pyramidal neurons within the cerebral cortex of individuals with AD [ 141 142 143 Likewise, downregulated mRNAs were potentially associated with various disorders linked with neuronal dysfunction. GAP-43, also known as neuromodulin, was significantly downregulated in arsenic-exposed SH-SY5Y cells. DisGeNET analysis showed its putative involvement in neuralgia, mood disorders, mild cognitive disorder, motor neuron disease, childhood astrocytoma, down syndrome, metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain, cerebellar hypoplasia, pick disease of the brain, neurilemmoma, motor neuron disease, and ganglioneuroblastoma. GAP-43 is a presynaptic protein that strongly associates with processes such as neurite outgrowth, axonal guidance, and synaptic plasticity [ 144 145 146 147 148 Our sequencing results revealed a significant increase in 11 circRNAs, most of which (including circMFN2, circFBXO7, circSTX6, circFAT1, circZNF800, circCLIP1, and circDNTTIP2) have been implicated in studies associated with various cancers. CircMFN2 is known to regulate autophagy by interacting with miR-27b-3p, thereby contributing to increased cell proliferation and migration in gastric cancer [ 149 150 151 150 152 158 , , 159 Similarly, circZNF800 has been implicated in the regulation of cancer stem cell properties in colorectal tumorigenesis [ 160 158 161 165 161 164 The present study compared differentiated SH-SY5Y cells with and without arsenic exposure, revealing that the identified circRNAs, normally expressed in neurons, show altered expression in response to arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. Further studies are warranted to fully characterize their baseline expression profiles and functional relevance in neuronal health and arsenic toxicity. It is crucial to consider that the observed alterations in circRNA expression after arsenic exposure can result from both specific regulatory mechanisms and broader cellular effects. Arsenic is well-known to trigger oxidative stress, DNA damage, and disturbance of cellular redox equilibrium, thus influencing transcription, processing, and stability of RNA species, including circRNAs. Additionally, arsenic may also alter the splicing activities required for circRNA biogenesis by affecting RBPs and splicing machinery. These possibilities highlight the need for additional mechanistic research to differentiate between direct regulation and secondary effects resulting from arsenic-induced cellular toxicity. The functional enrichment analysis suggested that the host genes of differentially expressed circRNAs were significantly involved in various pathways underlying neurodegenerative events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report implicating these specific circRNAs in arsenic-induced neuronal toxicity. Additionally, through miRNet analysis, we found direct interactions between the identified circRNAs (such as circCLIP1, circDNTTIP2, circMFN2, circKHDRBS1, circFBXO7, circPLEKHM3, circACVR2A, circSTX6, circFAT1, circERC1, circZNF800, circSETD2, circCSGALNACT2, circNUP54, circRBM6, circCDC42BPA, circPTBP3, circSCLT1, and circPPP6R2) and various miRNAs. Our functional enrichment analysis has identified the potential involvement of these miRNAs with critical cellular processes, including autophagy, cell cycle, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, axon guidance, pathways of neurodegeneration, transcription, metabolism of proteins, protein trafficking, cellular response to stress, and others. Furthermore, these miRNAs showed substantial enrichment in pathways associated with major neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, HD, AD, PD, and prion disease. These interactions highlight the possible involvement of identified circRNAs in key pathways underlying neuronal damage and degeneration. In summary, our extensive analysis uncovers intricate molecular networks affected by arsenic exposure in neuronal cells. This investigation not only sheds light on potential promising targets but also provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of coding and non-coding elements in neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. While this study provided valuable insights into arsenic-induced transcriptomic alterations in neuronal cells, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, although differentiated SH-SY5Y cells are a widely accepted in vitro human neuronal model, their use without in vivo confirmation may not have fully captured the functional and molecular complexity of mature human neurons. Second, some observed transcriptomic changes may, in part, have reflected non-specific cytotoxic effects of arsenic at the concentration applied, warranting cautious interpretation. Third, variations in baseline RNA expression among differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, arising from differences in differentiation efficiency of cells or responsiveness to RA and BDNF, may have introduced biological noise and influenced differential expression outcomes. Lastly, while transcriptomic alterations and predicted miRNA-target interactions were identified through in silico analysis, functional and mechanistic validation of miRNAs and their targets was not performed and remains an important direction for future investigation. Conclusion The prevalence of neurological problems is rising abruptly due to increased environmental arsenic exposures. Arsenic is a multitargeting toxin that exerts its detrimental effects by disrupting an interactive system of multiple layers of molecular markers. The complexity of arsenic-induced neuronal damage requires multi-omics technologies to portray the complete picture. The identification of key dysregulated mRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, as well as their associated miRNAs in the current study, advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning arsenic-induced neuronal damage. Future research should prioritize the functional characterization of identified circRNAs, such as circMFN2, circFBXO7, circSTX6, circFAT1, circZNF800, circCLIP1, circSETD2, and circSCLT1, using targeted knockdown or overexpression studies in neuronal cell models and in vivo models of arsenic-induced neurotoxicity. Additionally, validation of these findings in human postmortem brain tissues or patient-derived neurons will be critical to establish their relevance in human diseases.
