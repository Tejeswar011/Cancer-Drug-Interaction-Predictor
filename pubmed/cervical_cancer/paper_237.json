Regular screening for cervical cancer significantly reduces mortality rates. Due to the strong causal relationship between high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) and cervical cancer, HPV DNA testing has been developed as a screening method. HPV self-sampling kits have the potential to increase screening uptake, facilitate early detection, and reduce the global burden of cervical cancer. This study evaluates the efficacy of an in-house developed HPV CerviSens self-sampling kit for women in detecting hrHPV types. Methodology The study, approved by the Gupte Hospital Ethics Committee, included women aged 35–65 visiting Gupte Hospital in Pune, India. Participants self-collected vaginal samples using the in-house developed HPV CerviSens kit, and trained healthcare practitioners collected conventional samples. HPV DNA analysis was performed using the Cobas 4800 assay. Concordance between self-sampling and clinician sampling was assessed using Cohen's κ Results A total of 203 paired self-collected and clinician-collected samples were analyzed for HPV detection. The median age of participants was 44 years. Concordance for HPV detection between self-samples and clinician-collected samples was very good (Cohen's κ κ Conclusion HPV self-sampling using the in-house developed HPV CerviSens kit is a reliable and effective method for cervical cancer screening, with high concordance and accuracy in detecting HPV infections. Integrating self-sampling into screening programs can enhance early detection, improve patient outcomes, and significantly reduce the global burden of cervical cancer. self-sampling kit human papillomavirus CA cervix cervical cancer high-risk HPV self-sampling HPV screening The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Diagnostic and Therapeutic Devices 1 Introduction Cervical cancer (CA cervix) ranks as the second most common cancer among women aged between 15 and 44 years ( 1 2 In addition, HPV self-sampling kits have the potential to increase screening uptake, facilitate early detection, and therefore reduce the global burden of cervical cancer. Furthermore, HPV-based screening is more sensitive than cytology-based screening for detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (CIN3) and cervical cancer ( 3 4 A systematic review has shown that self-sampling is a well-accepted method for cervical cancer screening ( 5 6 7 8 9 2 Methodology 2.1 Study center and sample acquisition The present study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (Certificate No. GHEC/2022-23/013). All research involving human subjects was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Women visiting Gupte Hospital in Pune, India, were included in the study. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed below. 2.1.1 Inclusion criteria Women aged between 35 and 65 years. 2.1.2 Exclusion criteria • Pregnancy and within the first 6 weeks of the puerperium • Absence of a cervix (due to prior hysterectomy or trachelectomy) • Vaginal bleeding • Use of medications, creams, or vaginal douches in the last 48 h before sample collection • Inability to perform self-sampling Women provided two vaginal samples for HPV testing—one self-collected using the in-house developed HPV CerviSens self-sampling kit and another collected by trained healthcare practitioners at the hospital. Prior to sample collection, participants received verbal and written instructions with illustrations and gave informed consent to participate in the study. The in-house developed HPV CerviSens self-sampling kit for HPV detection includes a sterile screw cap tube prefilled with 2 ml of transport media, ensuring the integrity of the sample during transport ( Figure 1 Figure 1 HPV CerviSens kit components. HPV self-collection kit titled \\\"CerviSens\\\" by GreenArray, featuring a test swab in clear packaging and a labeled tube with a red cap. The box displays a teal and white ribbon and part of a doctor's attire. Detailed instructions are provided in the kit insert, guiding users on the correct procedure for swab collection, thus facilitating accurate and reliable self-sampling for cervical cancer screening ( Figure 2 Figure 2 HPV CerviSens user instructions. Instructions for taking your own sample for an HPV test. Step 1: Lower underwear, twist off the cap, and remove the swab. Step 2: Get comfortable and insert the swab 7-10 cm. Step 3: Rotate for 30 seconds, remove, and break the swab. Step 4: Place swab in the tube, return to a doctor or nurse. Consult a doctor if you have questions. Ensure no pain or discomfort. The specimen was obtained and stored at 4°C. The collected samples were used for HPV infection detection and genotyping. To minimize potential bias introduced by the order and timing of sample collection, we ensured that clinician-collected samples were obtained within 1 h of self-sampling. This timing was chosen to reduce the risk of time-dependent HPV DNA degradation. Additionally, self-sampling was performed first to avoid any bleeding or disruption of the cervical environment caused by speculum use, which could affect the accuracy of the self-collected sample. This sequence helped preserve the integrity of both samples and minimized the likelihood of one sampling method influencing the other. For the comparison of the two collection systems, only the 14 hrHPV types were evaluated, including 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68. Results were considered identical when both samples contained the same set of hrHPV genotypes. Samples were classified as concordant if at least one hrHPV genotype was shared between the two samples, even if the complete genotype sets differed. Discordant results were defined when no overlapping hrHPV genotypes were detected between the paired samples. This classification allowed for a nuanced assessment of agreement between the two collection methods. 2.2 HPV infection detection by polymerase chain reaction For HPV DNA analysis, the Cobas 4800 assay (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland) was employed. This fully automated real-time PCR method separately detects HPV16, HPV18, and 12 other hrHPV types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68), utilizing the β-globin gene as an extraction and amplification control. The Cobas HPV test is a highly automated assay designed to detect hrHPV DNA in LBC specimens using real-time PCR technology. It utilizes a set of 16 PCR primers (8 forward and 8 reverse) to amplify a ∼200 bp fragment of the L1 gene from all 14 hrHPV genotypes. TaqMan probes, labeled with three spectrally unique fluorescent dyes, enable the simultaneous detection of these 14 hrHPV types across three separate channels using real-time PCR technology. In channel 1, 12 hrHPV types (HPV 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) are detected as a pool. Channel 2 specifically detects HPV16, while channel 3 detects HPV18. Channel 4 detects a 330 bp amplicon from the human β-globin gene, serving as a control for sampling adequacy; a positive β-globin result confirms the presence of human cells in the collection vial ( 10 11 2.3 Statistical analysis The concordance of HPV detection between paired samples was evaluated using Cohen's kappa statistic ( κ κ κ κ κ κ P 3 Results Out of 535 eligible women, 213 (39.8%) agreed to provide a self-sample. Ten women were excluded because their self-samples were taken after the biopsy, leaving 203 women for analysis. The median age of the included women was 44 years (IQR: 38–49 years). The majority aged 40–49 years ( n n n Figure 3 Figure 3 CONSORT-style flow diagram depicting participant progression through the HPV self-sampling diagnostic accuracy study.

It has been suggested that self-sampling should be considered a valuable strategy in implementing national cancer screening programs globally ( 12 13 14 15 16 6 In the present study, we have demonstrated a strong agreement in HPV detection between self-collected samples and clinician-collected samples. The HPV CerviSens self-sampling kit emerged as a highly accepted method for screening. Importantly, our findings indicate that self-sampling did not miss any cases of underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or higher (CIN2+), compared with clinician-collected sampling. This highlights the reliability and effectiveness of HPV self-sampling kits in cervical cancer screening programs. A significant strength of our study lies in the utilization of both a clinically validated self-sampling device and an automated PCR-based HPV DNA test assay on paired samples ( 11 We evaluated the concordance and performance of HPV self-sampling compared with clinician-collected samples in a cohort of 213 women undergoing cervical cancer screening. We found very good concordance for HPV detection between self-samples and clinician-collected samples, as indicated by a Cohen's kappa of 0.88 (95% CI: ≥0.81), which suggests substantial agreement. This finding supports previous research indicating that self-sampling is a reliable method for HPV detection, comparable to sampling performed by healthcare professionals ( 14 17 Our study also examined the concordance for specific HPV genotypes. We observed a very good agreement ( κ κ 18 19 The HPV CerviSens self-sampling kit exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in detecting HPV infections. Specifically, the sensitivity of the kit was 98.1% (95% CI: 66.7%–90.9%), indicating that it accurately identified nearly all true positive cases of HPV infection, and the specificity was 99.3% (95% CI: 86.3%–95.3%), demonstrating that it effectively distinguished between HPV-positive and HPV-negative samples, with a minimal rate of false positives. These performance metrics are crucial for ensuring that the self-sampling method is reliable and can be trusted to provide accurate results comparable to those obtained through clinician-based sampling. The convenience and ease of use of the HPV CerviSens self-sampling kit significantly enhance patient compliance and accessibility. Women can collect samples in the comfort of their own homes, eliminating the need for clinical visits and associated logistical challenges. This aspect is particularly beneficial for increasing screening coverage in underserved populations and remote areas with limited access to healthcare facilities. Additionally, the self-sampling method respects the privacy and autonomy of women, which can encourage more individuals to participate in regular screening. 5 Conclusion HPV self-sampling using the in-house developed HPV CerviSens kit demonstrated high concordance and accuracy in detecting HPV infections, supporting its potential role in expanding cervical cancer screening programs. The high sensitivity and specificity of the kit ensure reliable detection of high-risk HPV types, while its ease of use promotes broader screening participation. Continued research and implementation efforts are warranted to maximize the benefits of self-sampling in reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortality. By integrating self-sampling into cervical cancer screening strategies, we can enhance early detection, improve patient outcomes, and ultimately contribute to the global effort to eradicate cervical cancer. The integration of this self-sampling method into screening programs holds great promise for achieving these goals and significantly reducing the global burden of cervical cancer.
