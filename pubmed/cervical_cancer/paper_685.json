This process enables cells to enter stem-like, dormant, or drug-tolerant persister states in response to treatment or environmental stress without undergoing genetic changes. Such reversible transitions complicate and limit current treatments. Conventional cancer models often fail to capture the complexities of these adaptive states. In contrast, patient-derived tumor organoids (PDOs), which retain the cellular diversity and structure of primary tumors, provide a unique system for investigating plasticity. This review describes how PDOs can model cellular plasticity, such as the emergence of drug-tolerant persister cells and the interconversion between cancer stem cell states across multiple tumor types. We particularly focused on colorectal cancer organoids, for which research on the mechanism of plasticity is the most advanced. Combined with single-cell analysis, lineage tracing, and functional assays, PDOs can help identify the molecular pathways that control plasticity. Understanding these mechanisms is important for developing therapies to prevent treatment failure and control disease progression. patient-derived tumor organoids cellular plasticity cancer stem cells drug-tolerant persister cells tumor heterogeneity therapy resistance Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) 25K10421 This research was funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C), grant number 25K10421 (R.C., M.I.).

Introduction Despite major advances in early detection and treatment, cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 The development of effective treatments is limited by the absence of reliable models that accurately replicate the complexity of human tumors. Although traditional 2D cancer cell lines are easy to manipulate and scale, they fail to capture the cell diversity and phenotypic heterogeneity of primary tumors. These models often accumulate significant genetic alterations over a high number of passages and lack tissue-specific niche interactions that influence tumor behavior and therapeutic responses [ 5 6 7 In recent years, organoid cultures have emerged as a powerful alternative for modeling human cancers. Organoids are three-dimensional epithelial structures derived from either adult or pluripotent stem cells, and they can be established from both normal and tumor tissues. These cultures maintain key histological, genomic, and functional features of the tissue of origin, including cell heterogeneity, cell lineage architecture, and dependence on niche factors, such as Wnt, R-spondin, EGF, and Noggin, which normally sustain epithelial stem cells [ 8 9 10 11 Previous review articles have mainly outlined the potential of organoid-based cancer modeling and its clinical applications [ 9 10 11 12 2. Cancer Cell Plasticity Overview Cell plasticity refers to the ability of cells to reprogram and adopt alternative fates or identities to support tissue regeneration and homeostasis. Traditionally, plasticity has been observed in physiological contexts, such as development and tissue repair, where it enables cells to respond dynamically to injury or environmental changes [ 13 14 15 Beyond natural contexts, artificially induced plasticity has been demonstrated through reprogramming technologies, with the most notable development being the generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from terminally differentiated somatic cells, such as fibroblasts [ 16 17 In pathological contexts such as cancer, cell plasticity enables dynamic and reversible transitions between phenotypic states in response to selective pressures such as microenvironmental cues or therapeutic interventions [ 3 18 19 20 Figure 1 21 8 22 4 Figure 1 This plastic behavior is the central mechanism by which tumors acquire functional diversity, evade targeted therapies, and adapt to new microenvironments during progression and metastasis [ 3 18 2.1. From Homeostasis to Tumorigenesis In adult tissues, cellular homeostasis is maintained by multipotent or lineage-restricted stem cells that sustain differentiated populations. During tissue injury or regeneration, committed progenitor cells exhibit enhanced self-renewal, expanding their differentiation potential to compensate for cellular loss and support tissue repair [ 38 + 39 40 + + + + 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 21 This cellular plasticity has significant implications in tumorigenesis. Differentiated cells can reacquire stem-like properties under the influence of oncogenic drivers, whereas tumor suppressors such as TP53 and PTEN normally restrict this potential [ 20 + 50 51 52 2.2. CSCs: From a Static to a Dynamic Model CSCs are characterized by their ability for self-renewal and regeneration of tumor heterogeneity. However, CSCs are not a fixed entity. Tumor cell populations exhibit bidirectional transition between CSC and non-CSC states, enabling dynamic maintenance of the CSC pool [ 8 + − 23 24 Additionally, a second level of cellular plasticity exists within the CSC pool itself, as CSCs do not represent a homogeneous entity, but instead comprise distinct functional states that interconvert depending on environmental conditions [ 22 32 53 54 55 + + + + 22 32 Furthermore, CSC plasticity is also influenced by the tumor microenvironment (TME). Niche-derived signals, such as WNT, NOTCH, and EGFR pathway activity, can actively promote or suppress transitions between CSC and non-CSC states or between distinct CSC subtypes. Stromal cues, inflammation, and other extrinsic factors serve as key modulators of CSC identity and plasticity, enabling their dynamic adaptation to environmental changes [ 8 56 2.3. Drug-Tolerant Persister Cells and Post-Treatment Regrowth Another manifestation of cancer cell plasticity is the emergence of DTP cells, a slow-cycling reversible state that allows cancer cells to survive therapy without acquiring genetic resistance. These transient cells arise in initially responsive tumors via an adaptive response to drug exposure [ 57 25 26 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 4 57 63 66 67 68 3. Organoids to Model Cellular Plasticity, Cell Fate, and Cell-State Transitions PDOs capture tumor complexity and cellular plasticity, enabling in vitro modeling of lineage hierarchies and cell-state dynamics. Organoids provide a unique platform for modeling the interplay between tumor-intrinsic plasticity programs and extrinsic microenvironmental signals. When integrated with single-cell transcriptomics, CRISPR editing, drug perturbation assays, and in vivo transplantation, PDOs allow researchers to track, manipulate, and functionally test plastic cancer cell states, which are essential to develop a better understanding of disease progression, relapse, and mechanisms of therapeutic resistance ( Table 1 Table S1 Figure 1 3.1. Reversible Interconvertion Reversible interconversion describes the bidirectional switching between distinct cellular compartments. These include (i) transitions between CSC and non-CSC states [ 23 24 25 26 27 A study that used PDOs derived from breast cancer provided evidence that luminal-type breast cancer cells exhibit high plasticity, with their differentiation status being highly dynamic during in vitro culturing [ 28 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) organoids further underscore the potential of the PDO system [ 29 30 31 29 Using an intraductal xenograft model, Miyabayashi et al. [ 30 Another example was provided by Raghavan et al.

Rethinking Cancer Treatment: How to Target a Moving System? Targeting cancer cells requires innovative strategies that address their intrinsic heterogeneity and plasticity. Traditional therapies often fail because cells exist in a dynamic equilibrium, transitioning between distinct functional states, such as DTP and CSC, under specific conditions. These shifts allow cancer cells to evade treatment, leading to tumor persistence and relapse. To effectively target this adaptive system, therapeutic approaches must block the mechanisms that enable cellular plasticity, such as preventing non-CSCs from acquiring stem-like properties and restoring the CSC pool. An additional strategy could be to block the regrowth potential of DTPs ( Figure 2 Table 2 4.1. Therapeutic Targeting of Cellular Plasticity and Cell-State Transitions Targeting molecular pathways that mediate cellular plasticity, such as the transition from dormancy to proliferation in CSCs, has emerged as a viable therapeutic strategy to prevent tumor relapse [ 25 + + The study by Álvarez-Varela et al. [ 26 + + + Similarly, Coppo et al. [ 27 Calandrini et al. [ 71 4.2. Targeting Niche-Dependent Cellular Plasticity and Cell States Plastic tumor cell states are often sustained by niche-derived signals, offering therapeutic windows before the cells transition to autonomous, therapy-resistant phenotypes. Seino et al. [ 29 Yan et al. [ 70 73 NCT04189614 Transcriptional plasticity in pancreatic cancer cells, driven by microenvironmental signals such as TGF-β and IFN-γ, can dynamically modulate drug sensitivity. Exposure to these factors induces a shift toward basal-like or intermediate co-expressor (IC) states, which are associated with reduced responsiveness to standard chemotherapies, but increased sensitivity to MAPK pathway inhibitors. These state transitions are reversible, highlighting the potential of targeting cell-state plasticity as a therapeutic strategy for overcoming resistance in PDAC organoid models [ 31 74 4.3. Potential Therapeutic Targets Cellular plasticity not only drives intratumor heterogeneity but also represents a critical mechanism of therapy resistance, making it a promising therapeutic target.

Conclusions Cancer cell plasticity represents a paradigm shift, redefining cancer cells as dynamic entities that drive tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance. This challenges traditional views and poses new questions: are plastic cells rare, or can most tumor cells adopt adaptive states under stress, such as during therapy? Targeting this “moving target” highlights the limitations of conventional treatments that overlook the unique properties of plastic cells. Integrating novel insights into cancer cell plasticity offers insights into new therapeutic opportunities. Future research should prioritize the development of therapeutic agents that specifically inhibit these adaptive pathways by focusing on the mechanisms that enable cancer cells to switch between different functional states and evade conventional therapies. Additionally, improving model systems, such as PDOs and single-cell assays, is essential to enable better studies on plasticity and screening of targeted therapies. The disruption of these adaptive mechanisms in cancer cells may lead to more durable therapeutic responses. Research on plasticity based on PDO drives the development of treatment strategies and precision in cancer medicine. Examples include new combinations of drugs with chemotherapy and the discovery of novel targets in stromal cues. Furthermore, integrating the PDO platform into precision cancer medicine has the potential to aid patient stratification [ 75 76 25 26 31 32 Although PDOs represent a powerful platform for modeling intratumor heterogeneity and cancer cell plasticity, they have some limitations. Established organoids lack stromal, vascular, and immune compartments. This absence restricts the ability of PDOs to fully capture tumor–microenvironment interactions. Recent efforts to overcome these limitations include co-culture systems with fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells, as well as organoid-on-chip platforms that incorporate vascular flow and extracellular matrix dynamics [ 77 78 79 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cells14181464/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.C. and M.I.; writing—original draft preparation, R.C.; writing—review and editing, M.I.; visualization, M.I.; funding acquisition, M.I.
