This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/397957-juvenile-granulosa-cell-tumor-in-an-adolescent-with-xeroderma-pigmentosum-a-rare-case-and-implications-for-surveillance We report the case of a 14-year-old girl with xeroderma pigmentosum who was incidentally found to have a juvenile granulosa cell tumor of the ovary during routine imaging. The tumor was surgically removed, and no signs of hormonal activity or metastasis were observed. The patient had an uneventful recovery and required no additional therapy. This case underscores a rare but noteworthy association between a DNA repair disorder and early-onset gynecological tumors, highlighting the importance of regular gynecological surveillance in affected patients. Early detection may improve clinical outcomes and reduce the need for aggressive treatment. adolescents dna repair deficiency gynecological surveillance juvenile granulosa cell tumor ovarian tumor xeroderma pigmentosum pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Juvenile granulosa cell tumors (JGCTs) are rare ovarian neoplasms, accounting for approximately 5% of granulosa cell tumors and 2%-5% of all ovarian cancers [ 1 2 The standard treatment involves fertility-sparing surgery, typically unilateral adnexectomy, sometimes followed by chemotherapy in advanced or aggressive disease. The prognosis is generally favorable in early-stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stages IA-IB), with a five-year survival rate of 90%-100% [ 3 4 5 We report the case of a 14-year-old girl with xeroderma pigmentosum who developed a juvenile granulosa cell tumor of the ovary, incidentally discovered without typical endocrine manifestations. This rare case highlights the importance of enhanced onco-gynecological surveillance in XP patients and contributes to the limited literature on this association. Case presentation We report the case of a 14-year-old adolescent born to non-consanguineous parents, followed since early childhood for xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare genodermatosis characterized by extreme sensitivity to UV radiation and a marked predisposition to cutaneous cancers. Her medical history included multiple surgeries for cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas, as well as surgery for a toe myeloma (Figure 1 Figure 1 Abdominopelvic CT showing a suspicious left lateral uterine mass (arrow) of likely ovarian origin. The patient was admitted for routine dermatological surveillance, during which a suspicious ovarian mass was incidentally detected on abdominal ultrasound as part of her follow-up. It appeared predominantly solid and homogeneous with a few central anechoic areas, but its precise characteristics were difficult to determine due to its size and location. Upon admission, the patient was conscious, afebrile, and hemodynamically stable. Physical examination revealed multiple hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules and small papules on the face and photo-exposed areas, along with scattered nodules in some regions, consistent with her underlying condition. The lesions were predominantly distributed over the face, neck, forearms, and dorsal aspects of the hands. There was no involvement of the mucous membranes. Abdominal examination showed a soft, non-distended abdomen without palpable mass or guarding; hernial orifices were clear, and bowel sounds were normal. No other abnormalities were noted on clinical examination. Biological tests showed normal complete blood count, hepatic and renal function, and no signs of tumor lysis. A pelvic CT scan demonstrated a left latero-uterine soft tissue mass, apparently arising from the ovary on ultrasound correlation, with irregular but fairly well-defined contours, showing heterogeneous enhancement after contrast injection, measuring 33 × 27 mm. Bilateral inguinal lymph nodes are subcentimetric (Figure 2 Figure 2 Axial pelvic MRI in T1-weighted sequence showing the presence of a mass classified as O-RADS 4 (arrow), highly suspicious for malignancy. O-RADS: Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System. Pelvic MRI demonstrates a left latero-uterine mass with irregular contours, intermediate T2 and isointense T1 signals, restricted diffusion with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) drop, and type 1 gadolinium enhancement, containing a central area of necrosis. The lesion measures 31 × 21 mm, abutting the uterus medially while sparing the internal iliac pedicle laterally. The left ovary is not clearly visualized; the right ovary measures 12 × 12 mm with follicular appearance. The uterus is anteflexed and retroverted, measuring 59 × 22 mm, with normal signal and morphology. Cervical signal and thickness, as well as the parametrium, are preserved. No bowel wall thickening is seen. External iliac lymph nodes are subcentimetric. Minimal intrapelvic fluid is present (Figures 3 4 Figure 3 Axial pelvic MRI in T2-weighted imaging after gadolinium injection showing the presence of a mass classified as O-RADS 4 (arrow), highly suspicious for malignancy. Figure 4 Histological section (H&E, ×4) showing a solid nodular tumor of monomorphic oval-to-spindle cells with grooved (“coffee-bean”) nuclei, rare mitoses, and fibrous stroma. Serum tumor markers were all within normal limits: inhibin B 80 pg/mL, α-fetoprotein (AFP) 5 ng/mL, β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) 2 mIU/mL, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) 20 U/mL, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 180 U/L. All values were therefore considered negative. An exploratory laparoscopy followed by left adnexectomy was performed by the pediatric surgery team. Intraoperatively, the left ovarian mass measured 3.5 × 3.5 × 1 cm was well-circumscribed and predominantly solid, with no evidence of capsular invasion. The contralateral ovary and uterus appeared normal, and no ascites, peritoneal implants, or abnormal lymph nodes were noted. Histological examination of the lesion revealed a predominantly solid tumor proliferation, composed of nodules separated by fibrous septa. The proliferation consisted of monotonous oval to occasionally spindle-shaped cells with moderately abundant cytoplasm, which was sometimes eosinophilic and at other times luteinized and vacuolated. The nuclei were round with fine chromatin, showing occasional nuclear grooves giving a “coffee bean” appearance in some areas. Mitotic figures were estimated at 2 per 10 high-power fields (HPF). The stroma was fibrous. No Call-Exner bodies were identified (Figure 5 Figure 5 Histological section (H&E, ×10) showing a solid nodular tumor of monomorphic oval-to-spindle cells with grooved (“coffee-bean”) nuclei, rare mitoses, and fibrous stroma. An immunohistochemical study was performed, showing positive staining of the tumor cells for inhibin and calretinin and absence of staining for GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3). A special reticulin stain was also performed, which was positive, delineating the tumor nodules. These histological and immunohistochemical features are compatible with a juvenile granulosa cell tumor (Figures 6 8 Figure 6 Immunohistochemistry: reticulin stain positive, highlighting the boundaries of tumor nodules. Figure 7 Immunohistochemistry showing positive tumor cell staining for inhibin. Figure 8 Immunohistochemistry showing positive tumor cell staining for calretinin. The tumor was confined to the left ovary without capsule rupture or evidence of metastasis, corresponding to FIGO stage IA. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. The patient underwent regular clinical and radiological surveillance, including chest X-rays and abdominopelvic ultrasounds. Follow-up showed no recurrence. A multidisciplinary team concluded that neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy was required. Discussion The association between a juvenile granulosa cell tumor and xeroderma pigmentosum represents an exceptional clinical scenario, illustrating the oncogenic potential of congenital DNA repair defects [ 5 6 7 8 A retrospective Tunisian study reported five cases of gynecological cancers in xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group C (XP-C) patients carrying the V548A fs X572 mutation, including uterine sarcomas, a uterine leiomyosarcoma, and an ovarian adenocarcinoma, with a median age of 22.4 years [ 5 5 In a multicenter review by Bradford et al. (2011) involving 106 XP patients, a significantly increased risk of internal tumors, including sarcomas, carcinomas, and CNS tumors, was observed in XP-C patients, suggesting that NER deficiency may affect tissues beyond the skin [ 9 10 Our case aligns with the findings of Yurchenko et al. (2023), who described a series of early-onset gynecological tumors, including a JGCT, in XP adolescents, highlighting the likely role of NER deficiency in ovarian tumorigenesis [ 11 XPC 8 In a U.S. pediatric study, two XP-C adolescents aged 15 and 17 developed gynecological tumors, including a possible granulosa-type ovarian tumor, suggesting that DNA repair defects (NER pathway) may predispose to the early onset of these malignancies [ 12 9 Conclusions This case report sheds new light on the emerging association between xeroderma pigmentosum type C and early-onset gynecological neoplasms, particularly juvenile granulosa cell tumors. The development of an ovarian tumor in the context of a congenital defect in DNA repair mechanisms supports the hypothesis of a broader systemic oncogenic predisposition in patients with XP, extending beyond the well-characterized cutaneous manifestations. These findings underscore the imperative for proactive and prolonged gynecological surveillance in affected adolescents. They also call for increased clinician awareness regarding the comprehensive management of patients with XP, including multidisciplinary follow-up to anticipate and address extra-cutaneous tumor complications.
