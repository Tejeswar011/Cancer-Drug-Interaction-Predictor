The antibacterial and antioxidant properties of agarwood essential oils (EOs) have been well documented. High-altitude (> 2500 m) regions attract tens of millions of visitors worldwide each year; however, the hypoxic environment poses a threat to the health of the body’s organ systems, including the digestive system. Additionally, hypoxia has been reported to alter the gut microbiota and metabolites. Our previous study demonstrated that hypoxia exposure triggered ferroptosis in the gastric and small intestinal mucosa. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of EOs in hypoxia-induced gastric and small intestinal mucosal injury. EO effects were evaluated based on clinical manifestations, histopathological assessments, and lipid peroxidation as determined by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) levels. We also assessed microbiota changes through 16 S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and analyzed metabolites using untargeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry in the gastric and small intestinal contents of mice. EO treatment significantly alleviated hypoxia-triggered mucosal damage in the stomach and small intestine. Notably, EOs reduced hypoxia-induced lipid peroxidation and partially recovered the microbiota and metabolite disruptions induced by hypoxia.

However, individuals exposed to high-altitude environments usually experience gastrointestinal discomfort, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (Anand et al. 2006 2022 2024 2024 2013 2023a Our previous study found that hypoxia-induced gastrointestinal damage primarily occurred in the stomach and small intestine (Wang et al. 2024 2020 2015 b 2024 Agarwood, known as “the king of all incense”, is a resinous substance derived from the trunks and branches of Aquilaria 2021 2019 2021 2025 qi 2022 2024 Bacillus 2020 2022 2024 Materials and methods EO extraction The wood of Aquilaria yunnanensis Analysis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) The composition of EOs was Analyzed by Agilent 6890–5977 A GC/MSD system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a HP-5 ms column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm). Compounds were identified by comparing with the NIST database (Linstrom 2022 2024b Animal experiments Male and female C57BL/6 wild-type mice (6 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Beijing, China). The mice were housed in a specific-pathogen-free Animal facility at Tsinghua University under a controlled 12-h light/dark cycle, with ad libitum n n n n n n Gastrointestinal permeability in vivo The mice were fasted for 4 h, and then received an oral gavage of FITC-dextran (Molecular weight 70,000; MedChemExpress, Saint Louis, MO, USA) at a dose of 600 mg/kg body weight. 4 h post administration, mice were placed in a closed induction chamber and exposed to medical oxygen containing 5% isoflurane (v/v) until deep anesthesia was achieved. Retro-orbital blood was then collected in K3-EDTA-coated tubes followed by cervical dislocation. The blood samples were centrifuged (4 °C, 15 min, 1000 g), and serum was collected in clear Eppendorf tubes (Voetmann et al. 2023 H&E staining Gastric and small intestinal tissue of the mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Sections were cut 5 μm thick and underwent H&E staining using standard protocols (Cardiff et al. 2014 2016 ROS and 4-HNE analysis The levels of ROS and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) in the gastric and small intestinal mucosa were determined using kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ROS, E-BC-K138-F; 4-HNE, E-EL-0128c; Elabscience, Wuhan, Hubei, China). 16 S rRNA sequencing Gastric and intestinal contents were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at − 80 °C until 16 S rRNA sequencing. Sequencing was conducted as previously described (Wang et al. 2024 www.qiime.org Analysis of metabolites in the gastric and small intestinal contents Metabolites in the gastric and small intestinal contents were analyzed using untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) on a Vanquish UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and ACQUITY UPLC ® 2024 KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of metabolites KEGG pathway enrichment analysis ( Kanehisa et al. 2017 2007 Correlation analysis of microbiota and metabolites Data preprocessing was performed using Python 3.9.

Certain metabolites enhanced by EOs have been linked to food consumption and microbial diversity. Specifically, gamma-tocotrienol, pelargonidin, traumatic acid, nervonic acid, and guanosine demonstrated potent antioxidant activities by scavenging superoxide radicals (Gudkov et al. 2006 2007 2016 2020 2021 2017 2022 2024 2010 2011 2023 1986 EOs reduced the abundance of certain metabolites with oxidative properties. Levels of palmitoyl-L-carnitine, which were reduced by EOs, have been linked to enhanced oxidative phosphorylation rates in mitochondria (Lenartowicz et al. 1976 The metabolites improved by EOs were significantly enriched in the pentose phosphate pathway, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor agonists/antagonists, nucleotide metabolism, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. The pentose phosphate pathway Supplies ribose 5-phosphate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) for nucleotide synthesis and redox homoeostasis, respectively (TeSlaa et al. 2023 2021 2014 2023 An association analysis between the microbiota and metabolites revealed that Candidatus_Saccharimonas Akkermansia Candidatus_Saccharimonas 2025 2019 2022 Candidatus_Saccharimonas Akkermansia In conclusion, EOs effectively ameliorated hypoxia-induced gastric and small intestinal injury, potentially by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and improving the microbiota and metabolite levels. EOs may be regarded as an alternative or supplementary approach for treating hypoxia-induced damage of the gastric and small intestinal mucosa.
