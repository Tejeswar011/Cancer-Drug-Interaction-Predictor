The cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) plays an important role in tumor immune evasion. CD47 is a highly glycosylated protein, however, the mechanisms governing CD47 glycosylation and its potential role in immunosuppression are unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the function of CD47 glycosylation in bladder cancer. Methods Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry were used to measure protein expression, protein‐protein interactions, and phagocytosis in bladder cancer. A murine model was employed to investigate the impact of mannosidase alpha class 1B member 1 (MAN1B1) modification of CD47 on anti‐phagocytosis in vivo. An ex vivo Results Our research identified that aberrant CD47 glycosylation was responsible for its immunosuppression. The glycosyltransferase MAN1B1 responsible for CD47 glycosylation was highly expressed in bladder cancer. Abnormal activation of extracellular signal‐regulated kinase (ERK) was significantly associated with MAN1B1 stability by regulating the interaction between MAN1B1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HMG‐CoA reductase degradation 1 (HRD1). Mechanistically, abnormally activated ERK stabilized MAN1B1, resulting in the glycosylation of CD47 and facilitating immune evasion by enhancing its interaction with signal‐regulatory protein alpha (SIRP‐α). In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that MAN1B1 Conclusions This comprehensive analysis uncovered that ERK activation stabilizes MAN1B1 by regulating the interaction between MAN1B1 and HRD1, facilitates immune evasion via CD47 glycosylation, and presents new potential targets and strategies for cancer immunotherapy that do not cause anemia.

Tumor cells can often achieve immune evasion through the loss of antigenic substances and the expression of anti‐immune molecules [ 1 2 CD47, also known as integrin‐associated protein, consists of a single extracellular V‐set Immunoglobulin Superfamily domain, a presenilin domain with five membrane‐spanning sections, and a short cytoplasmic domain that is subject to alternative splicing, thereby giving rise to four isoforms [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 CD47 expression is regulated by genomic alteration, transcriptional regulation, and post‐transcriptional and post‐translational modifications. Transcriptional regulation of CD47 has been extensively studied. Moreover, v‐myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 This study aimed to explore the role of CD47 in bladder cancer and to identify the glycosyltransferase responsible for the glycosylation modification of CD47. We utilized both in vivo and in vitro models to investigate the immunosuppressive impact of CD47 glycosylation in bladder cancer. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Cell lines and culture Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK293T), human bladder cancer cell lines J82, T24 and 5637 and murine bladder cancer cell line MB49 cells were cultured in dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) or RPMI 1640 (C11995500BT, C11875500BT, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (A5670701, Gibco, Burlington, MA, USA), 1% penicillin and 1% streptomycin (BL505A, Biosharp, Hefei, Anhui, China) at 37°C under 5% CO 2 2.2 Vector generation Human full‐length CD47 transcript variant 2 (RefSeq: NM_198793.3 P53006 P30176 P16206 P61757 2.3 Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9‐mediated generation of knockout (KO) cells To construct CD47 CD47 Cd47 The MAN1B1 MOGS ERK1/2 HRD1 MAN1B1 MOGS ERK1 ERK2 HRD1 2.4 Lentivirus packaging and infection A total of 5 × 10 6 For construction of stable overexpression infection cell lines, the cells were infected with lentiviral particles expressing CD47‐WT or CD47‐5NQ for 48 h and positive stable cell lines were subsequently selected by puromycin for two days. The shRNA sequences were inserted into the pLVX vector. Human glucosidase II alpha subunit (GANAB) shRNA: #1, 5‐GCTGTGGATAGAAGCAACTTT‐3, #2, 5‐CCCAACCTCTTTGTCTGGAAT‐3; Human monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (MGAT2) shRNA: #1, 5‐GCCCAAATTGAGTCACTCTTA‐3. 2.5 Western blotting analysis and immunoprecipitation (IP) For Western blotting, cells were collected and lysed in radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (P0013C, Beyotime) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (11836170001, Roche, Basel, Kanton Basel‐Stadt, Switzerland). Each sample was sampled with 10‐30 µg and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane. The final protein quantification was obtained using ImageJ software ( https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads For IP, cells were collected and lysed in IP buffer (P0013, Beyotime) supplemented with a complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein G beads (SM004025, Smart‐Lifesciences, Changzhou, Jiangsu, China) were incubated with the specified antibodies for 1 h at 4°C. Whole‐cell lysates were added to protein G beads. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. For the co‐immunoprecipitation experiments assessing the affinity between CD47 and SIRP‐α, either CD47‐Fc or SIRP‐α‐Fc was used as the bait protein and incubated with Protein G beads. After the incubation, cell lysate was added and allowed to bind at room temperature for 1 h. The complexes were then eluted and detected by Western blotting. All Western blotting and IP antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table S1 2.6 Clinical tissue specimens The study included patients with bladder cancer, kidney cancer, and prostate cancer who were diagnosed and underwent surgical treatment at Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University between January 2022 and April 2024. Cancer tissues and adjacent non‐tumor tissues were collected from these patients. The inclusion criteria specified that patients were over 18 years of age, had indications for surgical treatment, and had no history of other malignancies. Vulnerable populations were excluded. Neoadjuvant therapy can be administered before radical cystectomy for bladder cancer according to the patient's preference. Therefore, whether chemotherapy was received before surgery was not included in the inclusion or exclusion criteria of this project. For patients with kidney cancer and prostate cancer, tissues from those who had received preoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy were not included in this study. All patients were informed and consented, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital of Zhejiang University (No.20230312). All specimens were diagnosed by pathologists. 2.7 Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining Fresh specimens obtained after surgery were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, fully dehydrated with ethanol, embedded with paraffin, and sliced into 4‐µm tumor tissue sections. The sections were placed in an incubator at 60°C for 1‐2 h until the paraffin was dissolved, dewaxed, and hydrated. After hydration, the antigen was repaired at high temperature for 15 min in pH = 9.0 ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) Antigen Retrieval Solution (P0085, Beyotime), and the cell membrane was broken using 0.1% Triton X‐100 (P0096, Beyotime) for 15 min. After cleaning with Phosphate‐Buffered Saline (PBS) 2‐3 times, sections were soaked in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min to inactivate endogenous enzymes and enclosed with 5% FBS at room temperature for 1 h. Next, they were incubated with MAN1B1 primary antibody (1:100, #sc‐100543, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) at 4°C overnight and cleaned with PBS 2‐3 times. After being incubated with the secondary antibody, the sections were developed with 3,3'‐diaminobenzidine (P0203, Beyotime) for 5‐10 min. The cell nuclei were then re‐stained, and the sections were stored in a sealed tablet. All of the IHC staining results were reviewed by a pathologist team blinded to the clinicopathological information. For evaluation of MAN1B1 staining, we adopted a staining score by the percentage of positive cells (0, <10%; 1, 10%‐30%; 2, 31%‐60%; 3, >60%) [ 22 23 24 2.8 Immunofluorescence (IF) Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15‐20 min, then washed twice with PBS and permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X‐100 (Beyotime) for 15 min. After that, the cells were blocked with 5% serum (G1217, Servicebio, Wuhan, Hubei, China) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were added and incubated at 4°C overnight. Finally, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (5 µg/mL, D609734, Aladdin, Shanghai, China) for 15 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were mounted, and confocal images were captured using a laser scanning microscope. All IF antibodies are listed in Supplementary Table S1 2.9 Tissue extraction Clinical bladder cancer tissues were cut into pieces with sterilized scissors, ground with tissue grinding beads, and added to the RIPA buffer at 4°C for 60 min. DNA was separated by ultrasound. Then the sample was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g at 4°C for 20 min. The protein in supernatant was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid method. To acquire bladder cancer mRNA samples, tissue was treated in the same way as described above, and mRNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (AG21101, Accurate Biology, Changsha, Hunan, China). 2.10 Glycosylation analysis of CD47 To confirm that CD47 was glycosylated, cell lysates were treated with peptide‐N‐glycosidase F (PNGase F) (PE011, Novoprotein, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China). Purified CD47 extracellular domain (ECD)‐biotin protein (CD7‐HM447B, KactusBio, Shanghai, China) was treated with PNGase F (50 U/10 µg) to remove N‐linked glycans, and then the protein samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‐PAGE). Following the completion of SDS‐PAGE, the gels were stained using the Glycoprotein Staining Kit (RTD6501, RealTimes, Beijing, China) and Coomassie Staining Kit (P0017A, Beyotime) following the manufacturer's instructions. Photos were taken for documentation and further analysis after staining. 2.11 Lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA) lectin enrichment The cell lysate was mixed with 50 µL of biotinylated LCA lectin (B1045, vector laboratories, Newark, CA, USA) in the lysis buffer at 4°C overnight. Then, 50 µL agarose coupled streptavidin (20361, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed and then boiled with loading buffer at 100°C for 10 min. The samples were analyzed with CD47 antibodies (1:1000, #218810, Abcam, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England). 2.12 Macrophage generation and stimulation Bone marrow‐derived macrophages (BMDMs) were obtained from NoD.Cg.Prkdc scid em1Smoc Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors were isolated via density‐gradient centrifugation using Ficoll‐Hypaque (DKW‐LSH‐0250, Dakewe Biotech, Shenzhen, China). Monocytes were differentiated into macrophages over 7‐10 days of culture in RPMI 1640 [10% heated‐inactivated serum, 1% penicillin, 25 ng/mL macrophage colony‐stimulating factor (C417, Novoprotein), and 2 mmol/L glutamine (C0212, Beyotime)]. 2.13 Flow cytometry‐based phagocytosis assay A green fluorescent protein (GFP)‐encoding lentivirus was prepared from the pLVX vector construct using standard techniques and transfected into J82 and T24 cells to generate GFP + + + + + + S1 2.14 In vivo xenograft tumor‐growth experiments For bladder cancer xenograft analysis, male NSG mice (6‐10 weeks old) were engrafted 5 × 10 6 3 + + + For dihydrotanshinone I (DHT I) (5 and 25 mg/kg, B20357 2 2.15 Mass spectrometry To detect glycosyltransferase interaction with CD47, 293T and J82 cells were transfected with CD47‐FLAG for 24‐48 h. CD47‐FLAG protein was enriched by beads, which were incubated with an anti‐FLAG antibody. The washed beads were boiled in the loading buffer (P0015A, Beyotime) for 10 min to elute bound proteins and prepare for SDS‐PAGE analysis. The whole lane was excised and digested with trypsin at 37°C overnight to attain the peptide extract. Peptides were then desalted and lyophilized. After separation on an analytical column, the peptides were analyzed through mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry analysis was assisted by Beijing Qinglian Biotech Co., Ltd. CD47‐interacting proteins from 293T and J82 cells were intersected with glycosyltransferases (Supplementary Table S2 http://www.sangerbox.com/ 2.16 Culture and treatment of patient‐derived tumor‐like cells (PTCs) from bladder cancer Samples collected from bladder cancer patients were conditioned in ice‐cold PBS with 4‐(2‐Hydroxyethyl)‐1‐piperazineethanesulfonic acid (10 mmol/L, H43340 2 2.17 Subcellular fractionation assays Cells harvested with a cell scraper were collected into a centrifuge tube and washed twice with PBS. The Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) extraction kit (BB‐3604, BB‐314541, BestBio, Shanghai, China) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were fully cracked by a homogenizer, and impurities were removed by several centrifugations. Finally purified Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum solution was obtained. 2.18 Molecular docking The X‐ray crystal structures of CD47 (7MYZ), QPCTL (3PB6) and MAN1B1 (1×9D) were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank ( https://www.wwpdb.org/ https://autodocksuite.scripps.edu/adt/ https://gramm.compbio.ku.edu/ https://www.pymol.org/ 2.19 Cell viability assay The cells were cultured in 96‐well plates at a density of 5000 cells per well for 24, 48, and 72 h. Following this incubation period, the culture medium was discarded, and a medium containing Cell Counting Kit‐8 (CCK8) (HY‐K0301, MedChemExpress) was introduced. The cells were then incubated for an additional hour before measuring optical density at 450 nm (OD450). Proliferation rate (%) = [OD450 (experiment) ‐ OD450 (blank)] / [OD450 (control) ‐ OD450 (blank)] × 100%. 2.20 Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT‐PCR) analysis Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent. The reverse transcription process was conducted using the Evo M‐MLV kit (AG11728, Accurate Biology). The following primers were used for qRT‐PCR. For human MAN1B1 MGAT2 18S ACTIN 2.21 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analyses The expression levels of CD47 and MAN1B1 in different tumors were evaluated utilizing the tumor immune estimation resource (TIMER) platform base on TCGA dataset ( http://timer.cistrome.org/ https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome‐sequencing/tcga 2.22 UbiBrowser 2.0 and N‐glycosylation (NXT) motif analysis UbiBrowser 2.0 database ( http://ubibrowser.bio‐it.cn/ubibrowser_v3/ https://www.uniprot.org/ 2.23 Statistical analysis Quantitative data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).

We performed the IP assay using the lysates from J82 or 293T cells transfected with CD47‐FLAG to obtain complexes containing CD47 and its interacting proteins. The immuno‐complex was analyzed using mass spectrometry to identify potential CD47‐interacting proteins in cells. We identified that glycosyltransferases MAN1B1, MOGS, MGAT2 and GANAB might be involved in CD47 glycosylation (Figure 2A S2A 2B S2B 2C S2C‐E FIGURE 2 MAN1B1 was involved in the glycosylation process of CD47 and exhibited high expression levels in bladder cancer.

In addition, validation of the effectiveness of inhibitors in real‐world tumors in patients is important. However, DHT I had still not been approved for clinical use. Recently, several patient‐derived tumor models have been developed to screen drug candidates for cancer patients. An ex vivo 35 4N 4O P S10C‐D S4 3.5 Erythrocyte CD47 lacked MAN1B1 modification We also assessed the in vivo toxicity of DHT I on the levels of red blood cell, hemoglobin and platelet content in mice. The results indicated that DHT I did not elicit anemia, which was commonly associated with targeting CD47 (Figure 5A 5B FIGURE 5 The targeted therapy directed at MAN1B1 exhibited negligible adverse effects.

To investigate why DHT I did not affect red blood cell level in mice, we conducted experiments using blood cells from healthy donors and tissue samples from bladder cancer patients. Western blotting demonstrated minimal expression of MAN1B1 in red blood cells, while bladder cancer tissue exhibited a high level of MAN1B1 expression (Figure 5C 5D 5E F 3.6 Abnormal ERK phosphorylation stabilized MAN1B1 in bladder cancer Considering the significant upregulation of MAN1B1 in bladder cancer, our study aimed to uncover the molecular mechanisms behind its dysregulated expression. We utilized qRT‐PCR to quantify the mRNA levels of MAN1B1, revealing no significant variation between tumor and adjacent normal tissues (Figure 6A S5 FIGURE 6 ERK stabled MAN1B1 by regulating its interaction with E3 ligase HRD1 in bladder cancer.

Phosphorylation and ubiquitination are two crucial post‐translational modifications that can influence the function and expression of target proteins [ 36 37 38 6B C 6D G 6H MAN1B1 and ERK2 were found to interact by IP (Figure 6I 6J 6K ERK1/2 6L 6M N ERK phosphorylation typically stabilized proteins by modulating their affinity to E3 ubiquitin ligases [ 39 40 6O 6P HRD1 6Q HRD1 6R 41 6S T S6 Upon the activation of ERK through epidermal growth factor, we found that the affinity between MAN1B1 and HRD1 decreased with increased ERK phosphorylation (Figure 6U V 6W 4 Discussion This study investigated the role and regulation of CD47 to thoroughly comprehend immunotherapy for bladder cancer. Our study found that the glycosylation of CD47 played a vital role in bladder cancer, and the glycosyltransferase MAN1B1 mainly mediated this effect. Additionally, we identified that targeting MAN1B1 can achieve the therapeutic strategy of anti‐CD47 immunotherapy for bladder cancer without causing anemia. This was critical in CD47‐associated anti‐tumor immunotherapy. This study demonstrated that ERK could stabilize MAN1B1 by regulating its interaction with HRD1. These results underscored the promising therapeutic potential of targeting MAN1B1 in bladder cancer. Our study supports the notion that CD47 releases a “don't eat me” signal, enabling cancer cells to evade the immune system. CD47 was found to play a pivotal role in cancers [ 42 Protein glycosylation is primarily regulated by glycosyltransferases. Multiple glycosyltransferases, including MAN1B1, MOGS, MGAT2, and GANAB, were identified using mass spectrometry from J82 and 293T cells. However, subsequent knockout or knockdown experiments with MOGS MGAT2 GANAB 43 44 45 46 47 Although CD47 is an important immune checkpoint, and immunotherapies targeting CD47 are undergoing clinical trials in the 2a/2b phases. However, its broad expression in normal cells, especially erythrocytes and platelets, has exhibited adverse effects such as anemia in animal experiments and clinical trials. This limits the application of CD47 monoclonal antibody treatment [ 48 21 Our study provided evidence that glycosyltransferase MAN1B1 might inhibit the innate tumor immune response through glycosylation of CD47. It provided an important indicator for the selection of targeted CD47 therapeutic strategies. Interestingly, we found low level of MAN1B1 in erythrocytes. Our data implied that inhibitors targeting MAN1B1 perform immunotherapeutic functions without adverse effects such as anemia in vivo. Thus, MAN1B1 as a target could treat CD47‐mediated immune evasion in bladder cancer with highly expressed MAN1B1. Monoclonal antibodies are widely used in tumor immunotherapy. However, the large molecular weight of monoclonal antibodies limits them from crossing the tumors' biological barrier [ 49 50 51 52 53 54 Our results indicated that ERK activation could stabilize MAN1B1 by regulating its interaction with HRD1. Our study found that increasing the affinity of HRD1 and MAN1B1 through ERK inhibitors could effectively reduce MAN1B1 expression and promote tumor immune efficacy. This suggested that, in addition to MAN1B1 inhibitors, the combined use of ERK inhibitors could also be considered in immunotherapy strategies in bladder cancer. Applying ERK inhibitors in T cells could affect the interaction between PD‐1 and ubiquitin specific peptidase 5, degrading PD‐1 and promoting tumor immunotherapy [ 39 55 56 57 Although this study provided sufficient evidence from biochemical analyses and several mouse tumor models to highlight the important role of MAN1B1 in regulating CD47‐mediated immune evasion in bladder cancer, as well as the safety of targeting MAN1B1. Our study still had limitations. First, the sample size of the overall experiment was small. Many of the experiments relied on cell lines such as J82 and T24, which represented bladder cancer cell lines with the highest and lowest CD47 expression levels and male and female origin, respectively. However, there could be discrepancies among various cell lines of the same tumor. Knock‐in and knock‐out mice can be used to investigate the function of MAN1B1 in other cell types. Due to the rigorous sample collection requirements for PTCs, only data from three patients were included in this study. We hope for more data from the PTCs model in the future. Further basic and clinical data are still needed to confirm the function of targeting MAN1B1 in bladder cancer immune evasion, as well as to assess its safety. 5 Conclusions This study found that glycosylation of CD47 in bladder cancer was critical for releasing immunosuppressive signals by influencing the interaction of CD47 with SIRP‐α. The expression of glycosyltransferase MAN1B1 was significantly elevated in bladder cancer. The absence of MAN1B1 considerably impaired the anti‐phagocytosis mediated by CD47 in bladder cancer. Furthermore, activation of ERK was found to be an essential factor in regulating the stability of MAN1B1 by modulating the interaction between MAN1B1 and the E3 ligase HRD1 in bladder cancer. Targeting MAN1B1 demonstrated significant antitumor activity and exhibited no adverse effects such as anemia, offering a promising strategy for bladder cancer immunotherapy. This study systematically demonstrated the functional importance of glycosylated CD47 and proposed a potentially safe treatment strategy for targeting CD47‐specific glycosyltransferase, MAN1B1, in bladder cancer.
