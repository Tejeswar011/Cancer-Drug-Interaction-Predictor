We aimed to assess the nutritional status using Computed Tomography (CT) scans, in HCC patients and its association with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Methods A total of 122 patients were qualified for systemic therapy due to HCC, 73 for sorafenib treatment. The nutritional status was assessed using CT, Body Mass Index (BMI), the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and on the Nutritional Risk Score (NRS) 2002 scale. The ECOG Performance Status Scale was used to assess the patients’ level of functioning. The classification of the liver failure was described with the Child–Pugh scale. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer classification system was used for patients management. Survival analyses were performed. Results NRS and BMI were not significantly related to PFS and OS. Nutritional status changed significantly during 6 months of sorafenib treatment; however, the sarcopenia was not detected. The low PNI deteriorates significantly both PFS and OS. Significant differences between median time of survival in patients that lost more than 10% in visceral or subcutaneous fat or muscle mass in comparison to those with stable parameters were noticed: Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Index (SATI): PFS—9.5 vs 16.4 months, OS—15.95 vs 24.5 months; Visceral Adipose Tissue Index (VATI): 11 vs. 15.75 months; SMI: PFS—11.5 vs 15.75 months, OS—22 vs 24.1 months; PMI: PFS—9.2 vs 16.15 months, OS—14.5vs 24.5 months. Conclusion The loss in fat and muscle mass in patients undergoing sorafenib therapy for HCC was associated with poorer PFS and OS.

Currently, HCC is the sixth most frequently diagnosed cancer (4.3% of all cancers worldwide) and the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths (7.8%) with an estimated 865,000 new cases and 757,948 deaths in 2022 in the world [ 1 2 The main risk factors for HCC are hepatitis B and C virus infection, although non-alcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus is becoming a more frequent risk factor in the West. Other factors include heavy alcohol consumption, smoking, exposure to toxins like aflatoxin and genetic factors [ 3 4 5 6 The aim of the study was to assess the nutritional status based on CT scans in HCC patients and its association with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Material and methods Patient’s population A total of 122 HCC patients were qualified for systemic therapy between 2012 and 2023 in the Greater Poland Cancer Center in Poznan. The analyzed population included 73 patients receiving Sorafenib at an initial dose of 800 mg per day, with locally advanced or metastatic HCC diagnosed on the basis of a histopathological examination or based on a characteristic image for HCC with liver cirrhosis in CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast. The oncological treatment was based on the guidelines of the Polish Society of Clinical Oncology (PTOK) [ 7 8 Inclusion criteria were as follows: age over 18 years, (1) locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma confirmed by histology or cytology. In patients with cirrhosis and lesions ≥ 1 cm in diameter, it is possible to waive the histological or cytological diagnosis provided that a typical image for HCC is obtained in multiphase CT or magnetic resonance imaging with contrast (MRI), with enhancement in the arterial phase (hyperdense lesion) and contrast washout from the lesion in the portal venous or delayed phase (hypodense lesion); (2) no possibility of radical surgical treatment or locoregional therapies or their ineffectiveness; (3) performance status 0–2 according to WHO/ECOG; (4) functional liver status in category A based on the assessment according to the Child–Pugh classification; (5) presence of at least one lesion that can be assessed, according to the currently applicable RECIST criteria; (RECIST 1.1: mRECIST criteria used from 2022 in doubtful situations); (6) absence of significant comorbidities constituting a contraindication to therapy determined by the attending physician based on the relevant Summary of Product Characteristics and guidelines of the Polish Society of Clinical Oncology in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma; (7) adequate organ function, determined on the basis of blood laboratory test results, which, in the opinion of the attending physician, allows for the safe commencement of therapy; (8) no contraindications to the use of each drug; (9) in the case of coexistence of other active neoplasms, qualification for treatment must take into account the prognosis related to the coexisting neoplasm; Exclusion criteria based on: (1) coexistence of another malignant disease except for basal cell carcinoma of the skin, cervical cancer in situ, (2) uncontrolled infection, (3) heart failure higher than NYHA III or IV, (4) pregnancy or breastfeeding; (5) lack of cooperation or non-compliance with medical recommendations, including in particular those concerning periodic check-ups assessing the effectiveness and safety of treatment on the part of the beneficiary or his legal guardians. Clinical characteristic of patients BMI was calculated by dividing body weight by height expressed in meters squared, and the risk of malnutrition was assessed according to the Nutritional Risk Score (NRS) 2002 scale in hospital setting. For the assessment of patients’ level of functioning in terms of their ability to care for themselves, daily activity, and physical ability the ECOG Performance Status Scale was used [ 9 10 11 3 Computed tomography (CT) image acquisition All CT examinations were conducted at the Greater Poland Cancer Centre using two scanners: the GE Optima CT660 and Siemens Somatom Definition AS. The scans were performed at baseline and then after either every 6 months or based on clinical indications. Both scanners produced axial images with 1.25-mm slice thickness and a soft tissue reconstruction kernel. A single slice from each CT scan, showing the transverse processes of the third lumbar vertebra, was selected by a single radiologist using Siemens syngo.via software. All selected slices were in the axial plane, with the third lumbar vertebra confirmed in the sagittal plane. The measurement of the subcutaneous fat (SF), visceral fat (VF), total muscle (TM) and psoas muscle area (PMA) were done automatically using Coreslicer software. If necessary, the automated categorization of selected anatomical structures by CoreSlicer was manually corrected for individual patients by experienced professionals. The following formulas were used to calculate the: Skeletal Muscle Index (SMI), Psoas Muscle Index; Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Index (SATI) and Visceral Adipose Tissue Index (VATI). \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$SMI({cm}^2/m^2)=TM({cm}^2)/Height(m^2),PMI(cm2/m^2)=PMA({cm}^2)/Height(m^2);\\;SATI({cm}^2/m^2)=SF({cm}^2)/{Height}^2(m^2)$$\\end{document} S M I ( cm 2 / m 2 ) = T M ( cm 2 ) / H e i g h t ( m 2 ) , P M I ( c m 2 / m 2 ) = P M A ( cm 2 ) / H e i g h t ( m 2 ) ; S A T I ( cm 2 / m 2 ) = S F ( cm 2 ) / Height 2 ( m 2 ) \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$VATI ({cm}^{2}/{m}^{2}) = VF({cm}^{2})/{Height}^{2}({m}^{2})$$\\end{document} V A T I ( cm 2 / m 2 ) = V F ( cm 2 ) / Height 2 ( m 2 ) A muscle mass at the L3 level of < 42 cm 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 12 Statistical analysis For quantitative variables, descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean, range, standard deviation) were used, and for qualitative variables numerical value and percentage values ​​were used. Depending on the distribution of data, when assessing changes before and during treatment, the following were used: for normal distribution Student’s t 13 Results More than two third of the population were men characterized by NRS 0–2.

Similarly, for VATI the significant differences between patients that lost at least 10% of VATI and those with stable VATI were visible in both PFS and OS. For PFS median time of survival if VATI loss exceeded 10% was 11 months vs. 15.75 months for stable VATI and for OS median time of survival was not significant. Finally, the reduction of 10% in PMI was significantly related to disease PFS and OS (Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Progression-free survival and overall survival for HCC patients treated with sorafenib in relation to: a–b c–d Discussion The obtained data confirmed the importance of body composition in effectiveness of oncological treatment and survival. The loss of at least 10% in visceral/subcutaneous fat or muscle mass was significantly associated with poorer PFS and OS in HCC patients treated by sorafenib. Therefore, it is extremely important to provide proper nutrition to patients with HCC in order to support oncological treatment, both antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects. A rapid publication of new researchers in HCC that attained predefined primary end points brings new challenges for professionals. Firstly, there is a need to organize the treatment in this group of patients in a standardized way. Secondly, a standard of care for patients with Child–Pugh class B liver disease, especially those without liver decompensation, should be developed [ 14 15 16 17 2 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Although, the musculoskeletal imbalance is reported as a predictor of perioperative mortality in patients with HCC, this condition is still overlooked in clinical setting [ 27 2 2 28 29 31 29 29 2 2 2 2 31 30 32 29 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 There are several limitations of this study. The small sample size limits the dataset for the analysis. Nevertheless, HCC is a rare cancer and as for a single-center study the collected sample size seems to be satisfactory. Objective measurements for body composition assessment changes were used which indicates a good quality of presented data. The data analysis was performed by an experienced radiologist and oncologist, which is another strong point of the presented data. Of course, the planned prospective observational study would benefit from additional information on the analyzed group of HCC patients. In conclusion, changes in body composition of at least 10% influence significantly the disease PFS and OS and therefore should warrant careful attention from all healthcare professionals. A simple graph, constructed using biochemical data and parameters assessing body composition in CT, could help in predicting survival in HCC patients treated with sorafenib.
