Background Upper limb flexibility (ULF) is a simple and feasible measure of physical function in long-lived population. This study aimed to explore the association of ULF with all-cause mortality in community-dwelling oldest-old in China. Methods A total of 21 861 older adults aged ≥80 years were enrolled from five waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. The assessment of ULF at baseline involved three objective physical tasks (touching the root of the neck, touching the lower back, and raising arms vertically). All participants were followed up until 2018, during which survival information was collected. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to analyse the association between ULF and all-cause mortality. Demographic characteristics, health behaviours, and disease history were included as covariates. Results After 72 586.42 person years of follow-up, 18 570 people died. After adjusting for all confounding factors, both left and right ULF impairments were correlated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, with adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01, 1.12) and 1.12 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.20). In the collaborative analyses, individuals exhibiting ULF impairment across both the left and right sides had the highest mortality risk with adjusted HR of 1.29 (95% CI = 1.19, 1.38). We found significant additive interaction between left and right ULF impairment on all-cause mortality (relative excess risk due to interaction = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.02, 0.18). The principal findings maintained stable across sensitivity analyses. Conclusion Impaired ULF is associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality among the oldest-old in China, especially when the impairment occurs on the right side. For the oldest-old, ULF may serve as a simple and effective predictor of premature death. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes According to the seventh national census of China in 2020, the number of individuals aged 80 and above was 35.8 million. This figure is projected to rise to 70.84 million by 2035 and to 135 million by 2050, positioning China as the nation with the largest older population globally [ 1 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 11 14 15 Currently, assessments of physical function among the oldest-old primarily focus on muscle strength, physical performance, and balance. Previous studies have utilised grip strength [ 16 17 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 Studies have demonstrated that frail older individuals frequently exhibit motor dysfunctions, including reduced movement speed, grip strength decline, and impaired balance [ 26 27 METHODS Study population Study data were collected from the CLHLS, a cohort study focusing on healthy longevity led by Peking University and the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The data set comprised 35 564 participants selected from five waves (2002, 2005, 2008, 2011, 2014), ensuring no duplication in the research sample. The follow-up period extended through to 2018. Participants aged <80 years (n = 9457) and those with missing data on ULF (n = 82) were excluded. Additionally, 3927 participants lost to follow-up and 237 participants with invalid death time were also excluded. As a result, the final analysis encompassed a total of 21 861 individuals ( Figure 1 Online Supplementary Document Figure 1 Flowchart of participant recruitment and follow-up interviews. Upper limb flexibility During each survey round, participants were instructed to sequentially perform three specified activity tasks using their left and right upper limbs: touching the root of the neck, touching the lower back, and raising their arms vertically. Successful performance on all three tasks indicated that a participant's ULF was normal. otherwise, it was defined as impaired. The ULF measurement had good internal consistency with a Cronbach’s α coefficient of 0.858, and the correlation coefficients between the three ULF tasks were greater than 0.65 ( P 28 29 30 Survival information Survival data for all participants were collected, and the time of death was documented through either the local civil affairs system or inquiries with close relatives at each follow-up interval. For those who passed away, survival time was calculated as the period from the date of inclusion to the date of death. For those still alive or censored, survival time was defined as the period from the last effective follow-up to the date of inclusion. Participants lost to follow-up during the initial tracking phase were excluded from the study due to the inability to ascertain their precise survival times. Covariates Based on previous researches, the following covariates were included in the multiple Cox models: 1. Sociodemographic characteristics: age (continuous variable); gender (male or female); ethnicity (Han or other); residence (rural or urban); living status (living alone or not); and marital status (married and living with a spouse or not). Given the advanced age of participants, educational level was categorised based on whether the duration of education exceeded one year. 2. Health status and behaviours: body mass index (BMI); current smoking status (yes or no); current alcohol consumption (yes or no); and regular exercise (yes or no). Activities of daily living (ADL) were evaluated using the 6-item Katz scale and a total score <6 was classified as ADL impaired [ 31 32 33 3. History of chronic diseases: hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory disease were collected through standardised self-reported questionnaires. Statistical analysis Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) or the Chi-Square test was used to compare baseline characteristics. Survival probabilities across various limb flexibility groups were assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the log-rank test. Three adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were applied to examine the association between ULF and the risk of all-cause mortality: 1. Model 1 adjusted for age and sex 2. Model 2 further adjusted for residence, living arrangement, ethnicity, marital status, education, smoking, alcohol consumption, regular exercise, and BMI 3. Model 3 additionally adjusted for ADL impairment, cognitive function, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each model. The Schoenfeld residual method was used to verify the proportional hazards assumption. Given that most daily activities of older individuals require coordination of both upper limbs, joint analyses were conducted to evaluate potential synergistic effects of left and right ULF impairments on mortality. Using Li et al.'s methodology for biological interaction within proportional hazards models, key metrics such as Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI), Attributable Proportion due to Interaction (AP), and Synergy Index (SI) were calculated to assess additive interactions, with significant positive interaction indicated when RERI was greater than zero and excluded zero within its 95% CI. The following sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the stability of the primary results: 1. Considering the potential reverse causality due to early decedents, we excluded 2324 descents in the first year 2. Since severe pathological conditions may confound the association, we sequentially excluded participants who had heart disease (n = 1559) or cerebrovascular disease (n = 1064) 3. Considering that cognitive impairment and ADL decline may affect limb flexibility, we also excluded 2753 participants with severe cognitive impairment (MMSE score <14) and 4601 participants with severe physical function impairment (Katz ADL score <5) to test the stability of main results. All statistical analyses were performed using R R P- RESULTS Demographic characteristics The mean age of the 21 861 participants was 92.61 ± 7.23 years, and 13 553 (62.00%) were female. A total of 3391 (15.51%) participants had left ULF impairment, 2638 (12.07%) had right ULF impairment, and 2196 (10.05%) had bilateral ULF impairment. Significant statistical differences were observed in the primary demographic characteristics and health status across the different ULF status groups ( Table 1 Table 1 Demographic characteristics of 21 861 oldest-old individuals across upper limb flexibility status* Characteristics Overall (n = 21 861) Upper limb flexibility t/Z/ꭓ 2 P    Normal (n = 18 030)  Left impaired alone (n = 1193)  Right impaired alone (n = 440)  Left + right impaired (n = 2198)   Age in years, x̄ (SD) 92.61 ± 7.23 91.51 ± 7.18 93.67 ± 7.11 93.59 ± 7.18 96.59 ± 6.67 219.85 <0.001 Female 13 553 (62.00) 10 817 (59.99) 786 (65.88) 311 (70.68) 1639 (74.57) 209.01 <0.001 Han ethnic 20 442 (93.51) 16 815 (93.26) 1123 (94.13) 427 (97.05) 2077 (94.49) 17.53 0.001 Rural or town 17 704 (80.98) 14 664 (81.33) 934 (78.29) 340 (77.27) 1766 (80.35) 11.19 0.012 Live alone 3305 (15.12) 2839 (15.75) 151 (12.66) 70 (15.91) 245 (11.15) 40.87 <0.001 <1 y schooling 15 979 (73.09) 12 926 (71.69) 896 (75.10) 357 (81.14) 1800 (81.89) 129.86 <0.001 Current married 3536 (16.17) 3100 (17.19) 175 (14.67) 63 (14.32) 198 (9.01) 113.14 <0.001 BMI, kg/m 2, 18.99 ± 3.53 19.06 ± 3.51 19.12 ± 3.50 18.89 ± 3.62 18.33 ± 3.63 27.76 <0.001 Smoking 3177 (14.53) 2833 (15.71) 135 (11.32) 50 (11.36) 159 (7.23) 146.54 <0.001 Alcohol consumption 3900 (17.84) 3453 (19.15) 172 (14.42) 58 (13.18) 217 (9.87) 147.78 <0.001 Regular exercise 5237 (23.96) 4738 (26.28) 235 (19.70) 68 (15.45) 196 (8.92) 419.06 <0.001 ADL impairment 7688 (35.17) 5187 (28.77) 617 (51.72) 261 (59.32) 1623 (73.84) 1940.79 <0.001 Cognitive impairment 6753 (30.89) 5045 (27.98) 504(42.25) 149(33.86) 1055 (48.00) 446.71 <0.001 Hypertension 3346 (15.31) 2674 (14.83) 235 (19.70) 89 (20.23) 348 (15.83) 27.77 <0.001 Diabetes 310 (1.42) 224 (1.24) 28 (2.35) 10 (2.27) 48 (2.18) 20.18 <0.001 Heart disease 1559 (7.13) 1230 (6.82) 113 (9.47) 43 (9.77) 173 (7.87) 17.59 0.001 Cerebrovascular disease 1064(4.87) 630 (3.49) 123 (10.31) 72 (16.36) 239(10.87) 348.16 <0.001 Respiratory disease 2493 (11.40) 2006 (11.13) 152 (12.74) 49 (11.14) 286 (13.01) 8.87 0.031 ADL – activities of daily living, BMI – body mass index, SD – standard deviation, x̄ – mean *Presented as n (%) unless specified otherwise. † P 2 Survival outcomes A total of 18 570 individuals died after 72 586.42 person-years of follow-up.

In addition, we conducted subgroup analyses for left ULF impairment and right ULF impairment, respectively. The association between left ULF impairment and mortality was more pronounced in participants age ≥90 years, had no regular exercise habit, had cognitive impairment ( Figure 3 , P Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Subgroup analysis of left and right ULF impairment with all-cause mortality. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, residence, living arrangement, education, marital status, smoking, alcohol consumption, regular exercise, BMI, ADL impairment, cognitive function, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory disease. Panel A Panel B Synergetic effect of left and right ULF impaired on mortality risk Participants with bilateral ULF impairment had the highest mortality risk (HR = 1.29; 95% CI = 1.19, 1.38) compared to the normal group, exceeding the risk for those with only left ULF impairment (HR = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.98, 1.14) or only right ULF impairment (HR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.01, 1.31). This trend was consistent across both genders. In the total sample, the RERI = 0.10 (95% CI = 0.02, 0.18) and the SI = 1.52 (95% CI = 1.13, 2.06), indicating a significant additive effect of combined left and right ULF impairments on mortality risk. The proportion of mortality risk attributable to the interaction effect was 8% (AP = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.05, 0.11). Subgroup analyses by gender showed that the synergistic effect was more pronounced in women ( Table 3 Table 3 Additive interactions between left and right ULF impairment on all-cause mortality* Group Participant Death Person years Adjusted HR (95% CI) P RERI (95% CI) AP (95% CI) SI (95% CI)  Overall (n = 21 861)      0.10 (0.02, 0.18) 0.08 (0.05–0.11) 1.52 (1.13, 2.06) Normal 18 030 15 086 62 566.64      Left impaired alone 1193 1046 3791.18 1.06 (0.98, 1.14) 0.116    Right impaired alone 440 392 1321.53 1.13 (1.01, 1.31) 0.035    Left + right impaired 2198 2046 4907.06 1.29 (1.19, 1.38) <0.001     Men (n = 8308)      0.01 (−0.07, 0.09) 0.01 (−0.02, 0.04) 1.04 (0.76, 1.43) Normal 7213 6033 25 476.46      Left impaired alone 407 355 1343.53 1.03 (0.91, 1.16) 0.656    Right impaired alone 129 117 369.33 1.21 (1.02, 1.43) 0.031    Left + right impaired 559 514 1289.63 1.25 (1.06, 1.52) 0.003     Women (n = 103 553)      0.13 (0.05, 0.21) 0.09 (0.07, 0.13) 1.72 (1.26, 2.34) Normal 10817 9053 37 090.18      Left impaired alone 786 691 2447.65 1.08 (0.98, 1.18) 0.101    Right impaired alone 311 275 952.2 1.10 (0.94, 1.28) 0.228    Left + right impaired 1639 1532 3617.44 1.31 (1.20, 1.42) <0.001 AP – attributable proportion due to interaction, CI – confidence interval, HR – hazard ratio, RERI – relative excess risk due to interaction, SI – synergy index, ULF – upper limb flexibility *Adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, residence, living arrangement, education, marital status, smoking, alcohol consumption, regular exercise, body mass index, activities of daily living impairment, cognitive function, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and respiratory disease. Sensitivity analysis The core findings demonstrated substantial stability throughout the sensitivity analyses. After excluding participants who died in the first year or those with a history of heart or cerebrovascular disease, the independent associations of ULF impairment with all-cause mortality remained statistically significant (Table S2–4 in the Online Supplementary Document Online Supplementary Document After excluding individuals with severe cognitive impairment, right ULF impairment remained significantly associated with mortality (adjusted HR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.20, P P Online Supplementary Document P P Online Supplementary Document Online Supplementary Document DISCUSSION In this prospective cohort study, left ULF impairment and right ULF impairment were both associated with higher all-cause mortality. In the current study, individuals with ULF impairment account for 17.52% of the total sample, highlighting the necessity of screening for limb flexibility in the oldest-old population. In the older population, ULF is closely related to overall balance ability. High flexibility of the upper limbs can enhance the sensory input of the oldest-old, including visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive inputs, which are key factors in maintaining balance. Reduced balance ability increases the risk of falls in the older adults [ 34 35 36 Independent analysis indicated that left-sided ULF impairment was associated with a 6% increased risk of death, and right-sided ULF impairment is associated with a 12% increased risk of death. In the subgroup analysis, older individuals aged ≥90 years exhibited an increased risk of bilateral ULF impairment, with the right-sided impairment risk being more pronounced. These results indicated that the risk of right-sided ULF impairment on mortality was greater than that of left-sided ULF impairment. The right hand, often the dominant one, compared to the non-dominant hand, when injured, can significantly impact the daily living abilities of the older adults, causing a loss of independence and an increase in dependence on external assistance [ 37 38 39 The study also identified a synergistic effect of left and right ULF impairment on mortality, indicating that the risk of death due to bilateral ULF impairment is significantly higher than that due to unilateral ULF impairment. The human body relies on coordinated bilateral motor control for balance and daily activities [ 38 40 41 42 In the gender subgroup analysis, a more pronounced association was observed between ULF impairment and mortality among the female oldest-old population. Research has found that among the oldest-old and long-lived individuals, although women have longer lifespans, their health status is relatively poorer, and they are more sensitive to reduced physical function [ 43 44 45 46 As shown in Table 1 47 48 49 Cognitive function may also contribute to the association between ULF and mortality. Lv et al. found that the faster the cognitive decline in older people, the higher the mortality rate, but this is not related to the initial level of cognitive function [ 50 51 Upper limb flexibility in the oldest-old demographic is significantly associated with chronic conditions, including sarcopenia and frailty. A study from South Korean revealed that sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity significantly adversely affect older adults' health and are strongly associated with various chronic diseases [ 52 53 In this study, 99.69% of the oldest-old successfully completed the measurement. Compared to current physical function assessments, this index offers the advantage of being simple and easy to implement, requiring no professional medical guidance or equipment, and can be administered independently, especially in research among the oldest-old. It is also applicable to older individuals with walking difficulties or limited ADL, and its convenience and user-friendly nature make it ideal for home-based assessment. Traditional ADL assessment tools, such as the Barthel Index and Katz Index, primarily focus on whether individuals can complete activities independently and the extent of assistance required. However, these scales frequently overlook the quality of task execution, particularly the role of ULF. Incorporating ULF into ADL assessments can provide a more comprehensive reflection of upper limb function in the older adults and aid in identifying potential risk factors. Furthermore, this research, grounded in a nationally representative sample of China's older population, offers a distinctive chance to gauge the correlation between the ULF and all-cause mortality. Several limitations of this study should also be acknowledged. First, the study population was primarily limited to Chinese older individuals, lacking representation from other countries and regions. Future research should incorporate more diverse samples to enhance generalisability. Second, like other observational research, it is not feasible to eliminate the impact of all potential confounding variables such as genetic risk and environmental factors. Third, since ULF was assessed only at a single time point in this study, longitudinal evaluations should be considered in future research to account for potential temporal variations. Fourth, due to data limitations, our outcome only analysed all-cause mortality and did not analyse specific causes of death. And our study did not speculate on potential mediating factors. Furthermore, we assessed chronic diseases in the older adults exclusively via self-report questionnaires, which may introduce recall bias and compromise measurement accuracy. Future research should consider diagnosis of different diseases, especially neurodegenerative disease. This study may be subject to attrition bias, as some participants were lost to follow-up due to advanced age or deteriorating health status. While our study benefits from high statistical power due to substantial mortality events and extended follow-up, the focus on the older adults raises potential concerns regarding reverse causality. However, sensitivity analyses excluding participants with extremely old individuals, early deaths, and severe health issues yielded consistent results. Future longitudinal studies incorporating repeated ULF assessments would help clarify causal relationships. CONCLUSIONS Impaired ULF is associated with a higher risk of mortality, especially when the impairment occurs on the right side. For the oldest-old, ULF may serve as a simple and effective predictor of premature death.
