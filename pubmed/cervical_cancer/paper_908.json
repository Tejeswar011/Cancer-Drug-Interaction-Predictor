This study aimed to identify key axon regeneration genes in SCI and their correlations with immune infiltration and SCI subtyping. Methods Gene expression profiles of 30 sham-operated mice and 29 SCI mice were obtained from GSE5296 GSE47681 GSE93561 Results We identified 2,971 genes associated with SCI, including 19 axon regeneration-related genes, and 144 differentially expressed transcription factors, with Jun being highly interconnected. Significant alterations in immune cell abundance correlated with axon regeneration genes. Consensus clustering stratified SCI samples into two subtypes. WGCNA identified 21 hub genes associated with SCI subtypes. Drug-gene interaction analysis identified Itgam and Ptprc as potential therapeutic targets. Validation experiments showed significant upregulation of Fn1, Sdc1, and Cspg4, and downregulation of Col4a1 and Lamb1 in the SCI model group compared to controls. Conclusions Our study elucidates the interplay among axon regeneration genes, immune infiltration, and transcriptional regulation in SCI. Validation experiments confirmed the dysregulation of key axon regeneration-related genes in SCI mice, supporting their role in SCI pathology.

We collected gene expression data from three mouse SCI model datasets, analyzed differential gene expression associated with SCI, and identified transcription factors (TFs) among differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Additionally, we explored the interplay between axon regeneration genes and immune infiltration, stratified SCI samples based on axon regeneration genes, and identified subtype-specific biological pathways and immunological disparities. Furthermore, we employed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify key genes associated with SCI subtypes and identified hub genes and potential drug interactions. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying SCI and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods Data collection and preprocessing The gene expression profiles of the GSE5296 GSE47681 GSE93561 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ 1 S1  Table 1 Sample information Source Sham SCI Total GSE5296 12 18 30 GSE47681 12 5 17 GSE93561 6 6 12 Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network To investigate the interaction between axon regeneration genes, a PPI network was constructed using the STRING database ( https://string-db.org/ Identification and characterization of DEGs A pairwise correlation analysis of axon regeneration genes was performed based on their expression levels in both overall samples and SCI samples. DEGs between the two categories of samples were identified using the thresholds of |log2 fold change (log2FC)| >1.5 and adjusted (adj.) P http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/AnimalTFDB4/#/ P Immune infiltration assessment Immune infiltration was assessed using three methods. Single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) was used to estimate the relative abundance of 28 immune cell types [ 17 https://www.immport.org/ Consensus clustering Consensus clustering was performed to identify different subtypes of SCI samples using the R package “ConsensusClusterPlus” based on the expression of axon regeneration genes. Euclidean distance and K-means clustering were used for data classification. The process was iterated 100 times. The optimal number of subtypes (k) was determined by assessing the tendency and smoothness of the cumulative distribution function curve, as well as the concordance score and concordance matrix. The distribution of different subtypes was visualized using principal component analysis (PCA). Differential analysis on GO and REACTOME pathways was performed using the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) (V2023.1) via the Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) package in R. Differences in immune cells and immune response gene sets between SCI subtypes were further compared. WGCNA Key genes associated with SCI subtypes stratified by axon regeneration genes were identified using WGCNA. The top 5000 genes based on their median absolute deviation (MAD) were selected as target genes. Optimal network construction was determined to achieve a scale-free network. The genes were organized into multiple modules. Unique colors were assigned to each module. Modules underwent additional screening by assessing their correlation with phenotype. To identify hub genes in the module, we first intersected subtype-specific DEGs with genes from the most correlated module. A PPI network was constructed using interaction data from the STRING database. Gene pairs with a combined score > 0.9 were selected. Genes with a degree > 6 (more than six connections) were considered hub genes. In this study, the soft-thresholding power was set to 3, which is the minimum value at which R² first reached its peak. Drug-gene interaction The pharmaceutical agents potentially targeting the hub genes were explored using data from the DGIdb database ( https://dgidb.genome.wustl.edu/ Animals An SCI mouse model was established as previously described to verify bioinformatics results [ 18 19 20 Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining Mouse spinal cord tissue blocks were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h, washed in running water, and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series (50%, 70%, 85%, 95%, and 100%) for 2 h each. Samples were cleared in a 1:1 mixture of ethanol and xylene for 2 h, followed by pure xylene twice for 2 h each. Tissues were then embedded in paraffin (Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Group, China) and sectioned at 4–7 μm thickness using a Leica RM2235 microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were baked at 65 °C for 45 min, deparaffinized in xylene (Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Group, China), and rehydrated through graded ethanol to water. Sections were stained with modified Harris hematoxylin (Beijing Regen, China) for 3 min, differentiated in 1% acid alcohol, and washed in running water for 10 min. Eosin staining (Beijing Solarbio, China) was performed for 2 min, followed by dehydration in 70% ethanol twice for 1 min each. Sections were cleared in xylene for 3 min twice and mounted with neutral resin (Beijing Solarbio). Microscopic examination and image analysis were conducted using a Nikon Eclipse Ni microscope and DS-Ri2 imaging system (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) Mouse spinal cord tissue samples were homogenized, and total RNA was isolated using RNA extraction reagent (Yeasen Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). cDNA was synthesized using the Hifair ® ® −ΔΔCT S2 Western blot analysis Mouse spinal cord tissues were washed with pre-cooled phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized with a grinder, and lysed with RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Thermo Scientific). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to collect the supernatant. Protein concentration was measured using a OneDrop ultramicro spectrophotometer (Wuyi Technology, China). Samples (25 µg protein per well) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and separated by electrophoresis, followed by transfer to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) using a semi-dry transfer system (Dalian Jingmai Technology, China). Membranes were blocked with skimmed milk (Beyotime, China) and incubated with primary antibodies against COL4A1 (ab227616; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), LAMB1 (23498-1-AP; Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA), FN1 (15613-1-AP; Proteintech), SDC1 (ab128936; Abcam), and CSPG4 (55027-1-AP; Proteintech) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Zhongshan Golden Bridge, China). Detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Millipore), and chemiluminescence was captured using a chemiluminescence imager (Tanon, Shanghai, Chna). Image analysis was conducted using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using R (v4.3.0). Correlation analysis was performed using the Pearson method. The Wilcoxon test was employed to compare the differences in immune cell infiltration and the differences in enrichment scores of GO and REACTOME pathways between different sample groups. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Relationships among axon regeneration genes in SCI To investigate the relationships among axon regeneration genes in SCI, gene expression data were collected from three mouse SCI model datasets. A total of 29 SCI spinal cord samples and 30 control samples were analyzed after merging the datasets (Table 1 S1 S1 S1 21 22 S3 1 1 S4 1 S5 1  Fig. 1 Chromosomal location and construction of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of axon regeneration genes. A B C p p p D E Identification and characterization of DEGs associated with SCI Next, we analyzed differential gene expression associated with SCI. We identified 2,971 DEGs between SCI and sham samples. Notably, 19 of these genes were linked to axon regeneration (Fig. 2 S6 2 2 2  Fig. 2 Identification and characterization of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with SCI. A B p p C D Identification and characterization of differentially expressed TFs associated with SCI. To elucidate the transcriptional regulation of SCI, we sought to identify TFs among DEGs related to axon regeneration. However, no overlap was observed between TFs and DEGs related to axon regeneration. Nevertheless, among the 2,971 DEGs, we identified 144 TFs (Table S7 3 3  Fig. 3 Transcription factor (TF) dynamics and interaction network post-SCI. A B The interplay between axon regeneration genes and immune infiltration in SCI. To explore the interplay between axon regeneration genes and immune infiltration, we assessed the abundance of immune cells across all samples. We observed significant increases in 26 types of immune cells in SCI samples compared to sham samples, except for active CD8 T cells and CD56bright natural killer (NK) cells (Fig. 4 4 S8 4 4 5 5 S9 5  Fig. 4 Correlation between axonal regeneration-related DEGs and immune cell infiltration.

To elucidate the heterogeneity in SCI samples, we stratified the samples based on the expression of 45 axon regeneration genes. The optimal number of subtypes (k) was 2 (Fig. 6 6 6 6 S10  Fig. 6 Sample stratification via axonal regeneration gene expression. A B C D E F Immunological disparities and pathway enrichment in SCI subtypes. To distinguish subtype-specific biological pathways in SCI, we conducted a differential analysis on GO and REACTOME enrichment scores using the MSigDB (V2023.1). KEGG was excluded due to its unavailability for Mus. We identified significant differences in processes such as “Tolerance induction dependent upon immune response”, “Dendritic cell chemotaxis”, and “Antigen processing and presentation of peptide antigen via MHC class I” (Fig. 7 S11 7 S12  Fig. 7 Enrichment analysis and differential gene expression in SCI sample clusters. A B A B C Based on the involvement of immune regulation revealed by enrichment analysis, we further explored immunological disparities between the two subtypes. Of the 28 types of immune cells, 23 significantly differed between subtypes, excluding CD56bright NK cells, eosinophils, immature dendritic cells, neutrophils, and Type 2 T helper cells (Fig. 8 8 S13  Fig. 8 Differential immune cell infiltration and immune gene set scoring between SCI subtypes. A B p p p p Identification of subtype-specific key genes through WGCNA. To identify key genes associated with SCI subtypes stratified by axon regeneration genes, we employed WGCNA to construct a co-expression. Optimal network construction was achieved at a soft-thresholding power of 3, which is the minimum value at which R² first reached its peak (Fig. 9 9 9 S14 9 S14  Fig. 9 WGCNA for SCI subtype-specific hub gene identification. A 2 B C D Identification of hub genes and hub gene-drug interaction To identify hub genes within the turquoise module, we intersected 781 subtype-specific DEGs and 850 genes from the turquoise module, resulting in 543 common genes (Table S14 10 10 S15  Fig. 10 Identification of hub genes and hub gene-drug interaction analysis. A B Validation of the dysregulation of axon regeneration-related DEG in an SCI mouse model To validate the bioinformatic analysis results, we selected five genes with large fold changes in differential expression between groups and constructed an SCI mouse model and determined the expression of five axon regeneration-related DEGs in the spinal cord tissues. HE staining showed significant pathological changes in the spinal cord tissues of the SCI model mice compared to the control group (Fig. 11 11 11  Fig. 11 Validation of DEG alterations in SCI mouse model. A B p n Discussion In this study, we investigated the relationships among axon regeneration genes, immune infiltration patterns, and SCI subtypes using mouse SCI model datasets. Differential gene expression analysis identified 2,971 DEGs associated with SCI, including 19 genes linked to axon regeneration. We observed significant correlations between axon regeneration-related DEGs and immune cells, identified key genes associated with SCI subtypes through WGCNA, and specified hub genes potentially targeted by drugs. Validation in the SCI mouse model confirmed the differential expression of Fn1, Sdc1, Cspg4 (upregulated), Col4a1, and Lamb1 (downregulated). Our findings offer insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying SCI and potential therapeutic avenues. In SCI models, Robo1 and Sema3a exhibited a positive correlation in expression, while Robo2 was significantly downregulated, highlighting their critical and interconnected roles in axonal regeneration. Consistent with our findings, both Robo1 and Sema3a represent key components of the molecular mechanisms underlying the spatial organization and connectivity of motor and sensory pathways in the developing spinal cord. In SCI, Robo1 and Robo2 play roles in axonal regeneration and guidance, facilitating the re-navigation and reconnection of nerve fibers across injured sites [ 23 24 25 In our study, Jun emerged as a central node in the PPI network of differentially expressed TFs in SCI, exhibiting significant upregulation in SCI samples compared to sham-operated controls. This observation is supported by prior studies demonstrating increased Jun expression in response to SCI [ 26 28 27 29 30 Regarding immune infiltration, our findings indicated that Vcan was significantly positively correlated with effector memory CD4 + T cells, while Gpc5 showed a significant negative correlation with NK cells. Vcan is a crucial extracellular matrix component exhibiting more abundant expression in oligodendrocyte precursor cells than in astrocytes, playing a significant role in the cellular environment of the spinal cord, especially in oligodendrocyte precursor cells that are critical for myelination and neural repair processes [ 31 32 33 34 We also found that Matn2 exhibited a positive correlation with TNF family members, whereas Dcn displayed a negative correlation with BCR signaling. Matn2 encodes an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that belongs to the matrilin family. In SCI, alterations in the expression of ECM components, including Matn2, can reflect and influence the processes of inflammation, scar formation, and tissue remodeling during the healing and recovery phases [ 35 36 37 38 39 40 Our analysis of SCI samples based on axon regeneration genes identified two distinct subtypes. We found that subtype-specific pathways were related to immune response regulation, with significant differences in immune cell abundance and gene set scores between subtypes. WGCNA analysis further revealed a pivotal turquoise module correlated with subtype clusters, from which 21 hub genes interacting with multiple drugs were identified, suggesting potential therapeutic targets such as Itgam and Ptprc. Li et al. have identified Itgam as one of the hub genes related to the innate immune response in SCI. Itgam expression peaked at 72 h post-injury and then gradually decreased, suggesting that regulating Itgam expression within 72 h after SCI may improve spinal cord repair outcomes [ 41 42 Validation experiments in the SCI mouse model confirmed significant upregulation of Fn1, Sdc1, and Cspg4, and downregulation of Col4a1 and Lamb1 in spinal cord tissues compared to controls, albeit not entirely consistent with bioinformatics analysis, possibly due to biological variability and experimental conditions. BBB scores further confirmed locomotor impairment in the SCI model group. Fn1 encodes an extracellular matrix protein crucial for wound healing, exhibiting dual roles in SCI by promoting nerve repair and reducing inflammation, while also contributing to fibrotic scar formation that inhibits axon regeneration [ 43 45 46 47 49 50 51 52 55 This study is limited by factors such as the relatively small sample size of the SCI cohort, potential biases from variations in experimental conditions across datasets, and a focus primarily on gene expression and immune cell infiltration, neglecting other potential factors influencing SCI. Furthermore, while potential therapeutic targets were identified, their efficacy and safety require further validation. Although the bioinformatics analysis was based on contusion models and the in vivo validation used a weight-drop model, which may affect translational relevance, both models share key molecular responses, especially in the early phases post-injury. Future studies incorporating multiple injury models may help enhance the robustness and applicability of the findings. Conclusions In conclusion, our study explored the interplay between axon regeneration genes and immune infiltration in SCI. We identified subtype-specific pathways related to immune response regulation, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for SCI treatment. Significant dysregulation of Fn1, Sdc1, Cspg4, Col4a1, and Lamb1 was observed in spinal cord tissues in the SCI mouse model. Further experimental validation of these findings could contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for SCI management.
