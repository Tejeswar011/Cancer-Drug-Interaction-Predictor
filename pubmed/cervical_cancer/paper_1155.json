Patients with abnormal screening results should receive diagnostic follow‐up care; optimizing this process is a challenge. We conducted a mixed methods study to examine the cancer screening process among underserved patients who received abnormal results on a self‐sampled cancer screening test. Methods Participants were drawn from a parent study examining the impact of self‐sampled colorectal and cervical cancer screening tests among patients at federally qualified health centers in Pennsylvania. Those who had received abnormal results on their screening were completed a survey and semi‐structured interview about their experience ( n Results Quantitatively, participants indicated very high satisfaction with each self‐sampled cancer screening, and 60% preferred a self‐sampled test for their next cancer screening. Qualitatively, participants differed in the extent to which they seemed to understand their screening results, but they were generally satisfied with the self‐sampling process. In mixed methods analysis, participants' baseline knowledge about cancer screening supported better understanding of abnormal screening results, and participants' preference for their next cancer screening was related to their experiences with self‐sampling. Conclusions Among this sample of patients who received abnormal results on their self‐sampled colorectal or cervical cancer screening test, knowledge and understanding were not prerequisites for accessing follow‐up care. Satisfaction with the self‐sampling screening process was very high. These findings provide additional support for public health priorities to expand access to self‐sampling cancer screening tests. cancer screening cervical cancer colorectal cancer self‐sampling underserved patients National Cancer Institute 10.13039/100000054 K22 CA225705 National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences 10.13039/100006108 UL1 TR00045 UL1 TR002014 National Institutes of Health 10.13039/100000002 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.09.2025  J.

However, follow‐up care after abnormal cancer screening is suboptimal [ 1 2 3 1 2 1 3 Certain cancer screening tests are available through at‐home self‐sampling modalities. For colorectal cancer, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines include at‐home stool tests, such as the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) [ 4 5 2 6 7 6 8 9 We investigated experiences after receiving abnormal results on a self‐sampled cancer screening test (i.e., FIT or hrHPV test) among female patients from federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), drawn from a parent study focused on increasing cancer screening in vulnerable communities [ 10 11 1 Materials and Methods 1.1 Parent Study Participants came from a trial examining self‐sampling tests for cancer screening [ 10 11 4 12 1.2 Procedures for the Current Study Participants in the current study were participants from the parent study who received abnormal results on their self‐sampled FIT and/or hrHPV tests. After physician notification of abnormal results, the study team confirmed that the participant had received their screening results and obtained verbal informed consent for the current study. Data collection focused on the experiences of participants with abnormal screening results. Outcomes of interest included [ 1 2 13 Overall, 48 participants enrolled in the parent study, of whom 24 received the self‐sampling cancer screening tools. Of these, 7 participants had abnormal results (FIT: n n n n 1.3 Measures 1.3.1 Baseline Surveys From the Parent Study Sociodemographic variables included race/ethnicity, annual household income, educational attainment, and marital status. Healthcare variables included whether participants had a preventive health check‐up in the last year and health insurance type. We assessed cancer screening knowledge using four true‐or‐false questions from the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey [ 14 15 1.3.2 Surveys From the Current Study We measured satisfaction with each self‐sampling cancer screening test (separately for FIT vs. hrHPV testing) with four items: if they (1) thought the test was easy to use, (2) liked that they could do the test themselves, (3) thought the test was private, and (4) thought the test was convenient [ 16 1.3.3 Semi‐Structured Interview From the Current Study We developed a semi‐structured interview guide informed by existing literature on cancer screening. The interview guide consisted of open‐ended questions with suggested follow‐up probing questions to elicit rich, descriptive narratives about the self‐sampling cancer screening intervention delivery, content, and follow‐up (Table S1 1.4 Analytic Methods Analysis followed a concurrent triangulation design of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods analysis [ 17 1.4.1 Quantitative Analysis We generated descriptive statistics for the sociodemographic variables of parent study participants in the self‐sampling arm ( n n 1.4.2 Qualitative Analysis Descriptive qualitative analysis [ 18 19 19 20 21 1.4.3 Mixed Methods Analysis We used the quantitative data to triangulate our qualitative findings. To do this, we combined findings from quantitative and qualitative data using joint displays [ 22 17 Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 and nVivo software. The Pennsylvania State University Human Research Protection Program approved this project. 2 Results 2.1 Quantitative Findings Participants in the current study were similar to participants in the parent study (Table S2 p On average, participants scored 2.6 (standard error [SE] = 0.2) on the cancer screening knowledge index and 17.8 (SE = 0.7) for health literacy (Table 1 TABLE 1 Summary statistics for key quantitative variables related to understanding and satisfaction with self‐sampling for cancer screening among underserved patients. Mean SE  Baseline survey from the parent study Cancer screening knowledge (range: 0–4) 2.6 0.2 Health literacy (range: 4–20) 17.8 0.7  Survey from the current study Satisfaction with self‐sampling cancer screening test Colorectal cancer (range: 0–4) 4.0 0.0 Cervical cancer (range: 0–4) 4.0 0.0   n  %  Preference for next cancer screening test Colorectal cancer Self‐sampling test at home  a 3 60% Other 2 40% Cervical cancer Self‐sampling test at home  a 3 60% Other 2 40% Abbreviation: SE = standard error.  a Preferences for ‘self‐sampling test at home’ reflect only participants who indicated that option only (i.e., excludes participants who selected ‘no preference’ or ‘both’ tests). 2.2 Qualitative Findings We developed two themes about the self‐sampling cancer screening process. 2.2.1 Theme 1: Understanding of Self‐Sampled Screening Results and Receipt of Appropriate Follow‐Up Care Although participants were mixed in their understanding of self‐sampled cancer screening test results, all reported engaging with physicians to receive follow‐up care. Three participants used vague or general statements when discussing their FIT and/or hrHPV test results. In this example, Participant E (abnormal cervical cancer screening) indicated a superficial conversation about the results: [The healthcare provider] just said the results were [abnormal]. And I took that at face value and didn't ask any further questions, which I probably should have. (Participant E; abnormal cervical cancer screening) In contrast, two participants demonstrated a clear understanding of what abnormal screening test results meant. In this example, Participant C (abnormal colorectal cancer screening) summarized the results of both of her screening tests: That [I] did not have the necessary markers for cervical cancer and had blood in my stool, but that could be from hemorrhoids. It could be, you know, lot of other things. (Participant C; abnormal colorectal cancer screening) Understanding of cancer screening results was sometimes related to participants' family experiences and/or medical training. For example, one participant indicated that a family member's cancer experience provided her with some knowledge of the importance of cancer screening: Well, they told me that that was less than normal progression of this, and I have an uncle who died of colon cancer. And I know that when you catch that early that most of the time you can live through it. (Participant B; abnormal colorectal cancer screening) Similarly, another participant shared that her family and occupational experiences influenced her understanding of screening results: I worked in the medical field. I was an emergency medical technician, and my own life experience between the health issues with my children, you know, I have a basic understanding. (Participant C; abnormal colorectal cancer screening) “they checked further, and everything's fine” 2.2.2 Theme 2: Satisfaction With Self‐Sampling for Cancer Screening Participants reported an overall positive experience with using the self‐sampling tests for cancer screening. Several participants mentioned that they liked that they could do the tests privately: I love it, because … it's easier. It's more private. It's more convenient, because you don't have to make an appointment … (Participant C; abnormal colorectal cancer screening) I have a very difficult time going to the OB‐GYN. So I just don't. And because I was in the group that got the test [in the parent study], I was very excited. Because I wouldn't have to go. This was like get my doctor to stop bugging me about going! (Participant B; abnormal colorectal cancer screening) People, you know, don't like going to the doctor's, because it is a little humiliating, and this will somewhat eliminate that. (Participant C; abnormal colorectal cancer screening) However, some participants identified potential barriers or drawbacks for this testing modality. For example, Participant D (abnormal colorectal cancer screening) noted that patients may not “follow up with a doctor, even though they may be having some other problems.” 2.3 Mixed Methods Analysis Upon mixed methods analysis, we identified instances of convergence and divergence between quantitative and qualitative findings. First, in terms of understanding and following up on abnormal results, we noted that cancer screening knowledge scores resonated with quotes about understanding screening results (Table 2 TABLE 2 Joint display of quantitative and qualitative data related to the theme of understanding and follow‐up on abnormal results from self‐sampled cancer screening tests. Domain Participant A Participant B Participant C Participant D Participant E Cancer screening test results Colorectal  Abnormal  Abnormal  Abnormal  Abnormal Normal Cervical Normal Normal Normal Normal  Abnormal Cancer screening knowledge  a 2 3 3 2 3 Health literacy  b 20 17 17 16 19 Illustrative quotes Understanding of abnormal screening results That something was wrong because, you know, I'm‐‐ I'm … So that‐‐ I‐I‐just I make, I make appointments. Well, they told me that that was less than normal progression of this, and I have an uncle who died of colon cancer. And I know that when you catch that early that most of the time you can live through it. That [I] did not have the necessary markers for cervical cancer and had blood in my stool, but that could be from hemorrhoids. It could be, you know, lot of other things. And I really didn't express concerns at all, um, because I just was spotting a little bit. I didn't know that that was a‐‐ a huge deal after menopause. But apparently it is. They just said the results were [abnormal]. And I took that at face value and didn't ask any further questions, which I probably should have. Receipt of appropriate follow‐up care Um, I … needed to see a, a, a gastroenterologist. I had one polyp and they removed it, and it was benign. They checked further, and everything's fine. It was like, OK, Doc, you got a test. Be happy seeing you in a couple of years. Everything came back clear, so [the healthcare provider] is not overly concerned about it, either. I had the colposcopy… like, a week after they called me with those res—with the positive results from their office.  a Potential range of scores = 0–4.  b Potential range of scores = 4–20. Second, we examined quantitative and qualitative data on satisfaction with self‐sampling for cancer screening. Because quantitative data on satisfaction with screening were uniformly high (i.e., scores of 4.0 on a range from 0 to 4), we could not evaluate these data in reference to the qualitative outcomes. However, we identified strong convergence between preference for the next cancer screening test and positive evaluation of self‐sampling, particularly for cervical cancer (Table 3 TABLE 3 Joint display of quantitative and qualitative data related to the theme of satisfaction with the process of self‐sampling for cancer screening tests. Domain Participant A Participant B Participant C Participant D Participant E Cancer screening test results Colorectal  Abnormal  Abnormal  Abnormal  Abnormal Normal Cervical Normal Normal Normal Normal  Abnormal Preference for next cancer screening Cervical Both at‐home and in‐person tests At‐home test At‐home test No preference At‐home test Colorectal Don't know Both at‐home and in‐person tests At‐home test At‐home test At‐home test Illustrative quotes Positive evaluation of self‐sampling for cancer screening Since I'm a little bit out in the country and I travel by bus, I like doing it, the home test. I have a very difficult time going to the OB‐GYN. So I just don't. And because I was in the group that got the test [in the parent study], I was very excited. Because I wouldn't have to go. This was like get my doctor to stop bugging me about going! It allowed me to go further and have a peace of mind that everything's OK. [It] made it more comfortable, more easy, less embarrassing, because nothing like going to the doctor's, and just … being spread‐eagled. I love it, because … it's easier. It's more private. It's more convenient, because you don't have to make an appointment, and it's accomplishing the same thing. I think it's a great idea. I think there are a lot of women out there who would‐‐ would definitely be more open to using this and‐‐ as an initial screening… because we're busy, we have busy lives. I was uncomfortable at the thought of all of it at first. … But having done it once, it would be a lot less uncomfortable. And, um, I‐‐ I actually like it. I mean, it‐‐ ‘cause it‐‐ it‐‐ it wasn't physically as uncomfortable‐‐ as an in‐office test. Potential drawbacks of self‐sampling for cancer screening If there was going to be a barrier, you know, unfortunately, once in a great, great while that things get lost in the mail. With the cervical cancer one, that was test‐‐ testing only for HPV. And so some women may get that result back and think that they're fine, gynecologically speaking. [Patients may not] follow up [on their self‐sampled cancer screening] with a doctor, even though they may be having some other problems. 3 Discussion Our mixed methods analyses revealed that participants differed in their understanding of their abnormal results, which was related to their cancer screening knowledge; however, regardless of their level of understanding, all participants received appropriate healthcare to follow up on their abnormal screening result. In addition, satisfaction with self‐sampling for cancer screening was uniformly high, and these positive experiences led many participants to prefer a self‐sampled test for their next cancer screening. Based on previous studies [ 23 2 3 6 Among general patient populations, satisfaction with self‐sampling is very high for colorectal cancer screening [ 24 7 8 25 26 26 27 28 3.1 Implications Improving quality and access for “near home” cancer services is a public health priority, including increasing use of self‐sampling tests for cancer screening [ 29 4 30 5 31 8 9 3.2 Limitations and Strengths Our sample size was limited by the small number of participants who received abnormal screening results in the parent study. To mitigate this limitation, we integrated quantitative and qualitative findings to support a more robust, in‐depth investigation into participants' experiences. A related limitation is the demographic homogeneity of the sample; future research should explore these findings in larger, more diverse samples. Further, social desirability bias may have impacted the results. Specifically, participants may have responded to survey and interview items with a more positive perspective than their true attitudes [ 32 In terms of study strengths, we used a mixed methods approach to contextualize and enrich our scientific understanding of patient experiences after receiving abnormal results on a self‐sampled cancer screening test. Further, our study focused on an understudied population, and findings can be used to improve care and reduce healthcare disparities impacting low‐income, underinsured patients. 4 Conclusions We conducted a mixed methods analysis of FQHC patients' experiences with self‐sampling for cancer screening after receiving abnormal results. Despite differing levels of understanding of the abnormal results, all participants were able to access follow‐up diagnostic care. Further, participants had very high satisfaction with the entire self‐sampling cancer screening process. These findings support the potential impact of public health priorities focused on expanding access to self‐sampling tests, especially for increasing uptake and follow‐up care, and reducing avoidable cancer mortality.
