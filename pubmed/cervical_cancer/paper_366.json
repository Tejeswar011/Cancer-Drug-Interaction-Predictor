Immune cells are central to the subsequent regenerative response, orchestrating dynamic interactions between innate and adaptive immunity. This review systematically summarizes the current understanding of the roles of key immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, basophils, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes) in TMI pathophysiology and repair, based on a comprehensive analysis of recent literature. Their intrinsic mechanisms, contributions to tissue regeneration, and therapeutic implications are discussed. Furthermore, we explore therapeutic strategies targeting immune cells, including biomaterials, pharmacologic interventions, cell therapies, and physical modalities. The aim of this review is to provide a consolidated understanding of immune-mediated repair mechanisms in TMI and to identify critical knowledge gaps and future research directions necessary for developing novel immunomodulatory therapies to optimize muscle regeneration and functional recovery. traumatic muscle injury immune cell neutrophil macrophage T lymphocytes The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Grade Muscle Fiber Damage Fascial Tear Inflammatory Phase Functional Impairment References I Mild (<5%) None Acute (MRI-visible edema) Minimal ( 8 10 II >5% or partial Partial Acute to subacute Partial ( 8 11 12 III Complete with muscle retraction None Subacute to regeneration Total ( 8 13 IV Complete Complete Reconstruction None ( 8 14 15 The interplay between TMI, therapeutic interventions, and the immune system is governed by an orchestrated network of immune cells and molecular mediators ( 1 Neutrophils constitute the first line of immune defense following TMI, rapidly infiltrating the damaged tissue to clear necrotic debris and potential pathogens. They initiate the inflammatory phase through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and by recruiting circulating monocytes to the injury site. However, excessive or prolonged neutrophil activity intensifies tissue damage, underscoring the importance of tightly regulated inflammatory responses ( 19 20 + 21 + 22 24 25 26 30 31 32 35 36 Despite recent advances, significant challenges remain in translating immune modulation strategies into clinical applications ( 37 38 39 40 41 42 Etiology and clinical symptoms of TMI TMI generally result from either indirect non-contact mechanisms, such as strains and fractures, or direct contact injuries, including contusions and lacerations, often caused by mechanical forces and frequently associated with sports-related trauma ( 1 43 44 45 After TMI, just as shown in  Table 2 46 46 50 51 47 52 53 48 54 56 Table 2 Clinical symptoms of TMI. Symptoms Causes A link to the immune system References Pain and discomfort Tearing of muscle fibers Immune cells release pro-inflammatory mediators that cause sensitization of nociceptors, which triggers pain. ( 46 Muscle stiffness Pain and limited movement after exercise Inflammation can lead to muscle stiffness, as well as decreased function, etc., because protein degradation, apoptosis, and local inflammatory response during inflammation can lead to ultrastructural damage of muscle cells, resulting in muscle being unable to perform normal function. ( 47 48 Muscle dysfunction Damage to muscle structure and inflammatory response Swelling of muscle Inflammation and increased vascular permeability Immune cells are recruited to the injury site, resulting in increased local vascular permeability, and the infiltration of proteins and other liquids in plasma into the tissue space causing local edema or swelling. ( 49 TMI leads to significant changes in numerous markers, including increased activity of biochemical indicators such as serum creatine kinase (CK), a key marker for assessing the extent of muscle injury ( 57 58 59 59 61 62 19 63 The onset and progression of these responses are influenced by multiple factors, including the type, intensity, and duration of exercise, as well as the individual’s adaptive capacity to physical activity. Early detection of these responses is essential for timely diagnosis and intervention in traumatic muscle injuries, thus facilitating recovery and reducing the risk of further tissue damage. Diagnosis and treatment of TMI Based on these symptoms, a preliminary diagnosis can be made, further supported by diagnostic tools such as ultrasound ( 64 65 66 67 68 69 Treatment for TMI involves several approaches, including initial management, non-surgical and surgical treatments, rehabilitation, and preventive measures. Initial management typically involves protection, rest, optimal use of the injured limb, and cold therapy, following the RICE principle of “rest, ice, compression, and elevation” ( 70 71 64 65 72 1 9 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 Preventive measures are crucial for reducing the risk of muscle injuries, especially in athletes involved in sports such as football. Key strategies include adequate warm-ups, temperature regulation, and stretching, all of which help lower the risk of strains. Increasing muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility is vital for improving athletic performance and preventing injuries. Although traumatic muscle injuries are prevalent among athletes, successful recovery is attainable through proper classification, prompt diagnosis, and effective treatment. Immune cells response to TMI repair After TMI, the immune system initiates an inflammatory response to remove damaged cells and tissue debris, setting the stage for muscle tissue repair. This process involves vasodilation, cell migration, and the activation of inflammatory cells ( 80 81 82 83 Moreover, the immune system orchestrates the activities of immunocompetent cells such as macrophages, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells, which secrete multiple cytokines to enhance muscle repair and regeneration ( 80 TMI triggers an intricate host response that disrupts immune homeostasis, increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections and inflammatory complications such as infections, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) ( 84 85 86 86 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 95 As shown in  Figure 1 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 Figure 1 Immune cell dynamics during TMI repair, including, neutrophils immediately infiltrate within a few seconds, macrophage polarization in a few days, and Treg-mediated inflammation regulation in weeks. M1, pro-inflammatory macrophage; M2, anti-inflammatory macrophage; IL-6, interleukin-6; IL-8, interleukin-8; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; Treg cell, regulatory T cell. The figure was drawn by Figdraw. Flowchart illustrating muscle repair after trauma. Normal muscle experiences trauma, leading to injured and damaged inflammatory muscle cells with cell debris. Neutrophil recruitment occurs within seconds, followed by macrophage activation in days, involving M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) pathways. Treg cell action further supports healing. Processes include removal of dead tissue, satellite cell recruitment, formation of new collagen networks, angiogenesis, and cytoskeleton formation, leading to repaired muscle over weeks. The immune system’s response to TMI involves a multifaceted interplay of mechanisms mediated by immune cells, which are crucial for post-injury muscle repair. Following trauma, these cells play pivotal roles, including the activation and differentiation of muscle stem cells, the regulation of inflammation, the clearance of damaged tissues, and active participation in tissue regeneration. Neutrophils Neutrophils play an important role in both the initial injury and repair of TMI, serving as an necessary component of the innate immune system that combats infections through pathogen engulfment and the release of antibacterial enzymes ( 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 During the early stages of TMI, neutrophils contribute to the inflammatory response by releasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteases, which facilitate the initial repair of the injured site ( 114 115 116 117 105 118 119 120 121 122 123 116 116 116 124 125 As the inflammatory response at the injury site gradually subsides, IL-10 from N2 neutrophils promotes macrophage polarization toward a regenerative phenotype, enhancing myoblast proliferation and satellite cell activation in murine models ( 126 128 129 73 130 131 119 132 In summary, neutrophils show dual functions in TMI repair. They facilitate initial repair by eliminating necrotic tissue and pathogens, while promoting muscle regeneration through the release of pro-inflammatory factors and participation in the inflammatory response ( 104 115 133 115 Studies in murine and human models underscore neutrophils’ pivotal yet complex role of neutrophils in muscle regeneration ( 41 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 1 142 Other studies have suggested that neutrophils may not significantly impact muscle recovery. In one study, mice underwent a 10-day offloading of their hind limbs, followed by reloading after neutrophil depletion. The results indicated that neutrophil depletion did not affect strength loss or the recovery of atrophied muscle fibers ( 143  Table 3 135 146 148 145 Table 3 Overview of the role of neutrophils in TMI repair. Reference Research model/platform Research mechanism Conclusions related to immune cells ( 136 Dual laser Multimode nonlinear optical microscope platform The peak number of neutrophils coincided with the activation of muscle satellite cells. Neutrophils may be involved in the activation of satellite cells in favor of muscle repair. ( 142 Male Swiss mice were pretreated with anti-mouse granulocyte immunoglobulin G (IgG) or control antibody. Likely through phagocytosis of necrotic debris and the recruitment of other inflammatory cells, both of which are critical for effective muscle repair. Neutrophils play a key role in skeletal muscle regeneration following Bothrops asper. ( 144 A peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) deficient mouse model Neutrophils induce secondary immune thrombosis through PAD-dependent mechanisms, thereby promoting the healing of injured tissues. Insufficient immune thrombosis caused by neutrophils may cause damaged tissue to bleed and be difficult to heal. ( 143 Mice underwent 10 days of hindlimb unloading and neutrophil depletion before reloading. LPS alters the activation state of neutrophils, otherwise, neutrophilic infiltration is highly regulated and effectively eliminated during regulated mechanical loading without significant muscle fiber damage Neutrophil consumption does not affect loss of strength or restoration of atrophied fibers. ( 135 Real-time force control compatible with ultrasound for tissue strain analysis. In addition to neutrophils in the injured muscle, the inhibitory effect of neutrophil-related secretion factors on the differentiation of muscle progenitor cells was reduced. Massage to clarify that neutrophils promote myogenesis by changing the type of muscle fiber maturation, thus promoting muscle regeneration. ( 145 Humans normally heal open damage and pressure ulcers. MPO deficiency leads to an intensification of the inflammatory response and affects neutrophil function, including cytokine production. MPO, as a key enzyme in neutrophils, produces reactive oxygen intermediates such as hypochlorous acid that help kill microorganisms, but may also cause tissue damage. ( 146 Nanoparticles were used to label bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) Neutrophil-derived mediators are made by SOD. When hydrogen peroxide accumulates, it is toxic to cells, causing membrane lipid peroxidation and membrane fission, leading to cell damage and death. When the medium produced by neutrophils is less superoxide, the cytotoxicity and the influence on cell proliferation activity are less, which is conducive to tissue repair. The presence and activity of neutrophils may be associated with the pathogenesis of TMI. Animal studies have shown that neutrophil depletion can enhance muscle regeneration, supporting the hypothesis that neutrophils contribute to muscle damage. Researchers found the depletion of neutrophils in young mdx mice reduced muscle degradation ( 149 150 151 Neutrophils play diverse roles in TMI repair, including initiating the inflammatory response, facilitating muscle regeneration, modulation of the inflammatory environment, and contributing to dual functions. In the pathophysiological process of TMI, neutrophils play a complex and bidirectional regulatory role ( 115 104 109 116 117 116 152 Monocytes/macrophages Macrophages are critical to TMI, which is pivotal in initiating and resolving inflammatory responses ( 153 154 155 156 157 158 M1 macrophages, primarily pro-inflammatory, contribute to clearing damaged tissue by engulfing apoptotic or necrotic muscle fibers, releasing inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α and IL-1β ( 159 160 139  Figure 2 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 Figure 2 Macrophages shift from a pro-inflammatory (M1) phenotype (peaking at 0.5–2 days post-injury) to an anti-inflammatory (M2) phenotype (maximal at 3.5–10 days), dynamically coordinating tissue debridement, stem cell activation, and regenerative remodeling ( 2 Flowchart illustrating macrophage differentiation and its effects on muscle cells over time. M1 macrophages, induced by pro-inflammatory factors, lead to necrotic tissue removal and either cell protection or apoptosis through ROS and NO pathways. M2 macrophages, driven by TGF-β1, facilitate lipopenia, angiogenesis, muscle stem cell recruitment, and tissue repair. The process spans one to two and two to five days. In contrast, M2 macrophages transition from an initial anti-inflammatory role to become central mediators of tissue regeneration. This functional adaptation is facilitated by distinct M2 subtypes (M2a, M2b, M2c, M2d), classified based on activating stimuli and transcriptional profiles, each with specific functions ( 172 As regeneration progresses into later stages, M2a macrophages, also referred to as alternatively activated macrophages, predominantly function during the early stages of immune responses. They suppress inflammatory reactions and stimulate the proliferation of non-myeloid cells through the secretion of regulatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13. Additionally, M2a macrophages play a role in fibrosis by regulating fibroblast activities via the secretion of factors like TGF-β ( 173 91 11 Following skeletal muscle injury, macrophage subsets. Spatially and Temporally form multi-layered regenerative inflammatory zones (RIZs). Spatially resolved transcriptomic analyses reveal that the dynamic changes in macrophage subtypes and the ordered structure of RIZs are fundamental to efficient skeletal muscle regeneration ( 174 175 Exploring the specific mechanism of macrophages in TMI, we know macrophages are modulated by multiple signaling pathways during their polarization and functional transformation. Following tissue injury, the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway is activated by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) ( 176 177 178 179 180 181 179 Recent studies have shown the effect of macrophages on the behavior of myoblasts and muscle stem cells by releasing paracrine factors. For example, real-time imaging with genetically modified zebrafish has allowed scientists to observe interactions between muscle stem cells and the innate immune system, underscoring the critical role of macrophages in muscle regeneration ( 136 182 183 + Macrophage activation and function are highly versatile, with distinct roles at different muscle injury and repair stages. In both stable and injured skeletal muscle, their functional diversity encompasses phagocytosis, regulation of inflammation, and tissue remodeling ( 184 Eosinophils and basophils Both eosinophils and basophils play vital roles in TMI repair. Eosinophils contribute significantly to muscle tissue repair and epithelial remodeling by interacting with the clotting system to promote hemostasis and tissue repair. Moreover, eosinophils are recruited to damaged organs such as the liver and muscles, where they secrete IL-4 and IL-13. These cytokines activate IL-4 receptor α Chain-expressing hepatocytes and progenitors in both liver and muscle tissues, supporting tissue regeneration. IL-4 activates the IL-4Rα/STAT6 signaling pathway on (Fibro adipogenic progenitors) FAPs, thereby promoting the proliferation of FAPs ( 185 189 190 190 190 191 On the other hand, basophils also play a significant role in immune surveillance and damages repair. Although they constitute only a small fraction of circulating white blood cells, basophils release histamine and other mediators necessary for initiating allergic reactions ( 192 193 194 194 165 195 196 165 193 T lymphocytes T lymphocytes, or T cells, are crucial components of the immune system, maturing primarily in the thymus before migrating to various immune organs and tissues to carry out their immune functions. They are derived from pluripotent stem cells in the bone marrow and, during embryonic development, from the yolk sac and liver ( 197 198 100 199 200 Investigations into T lymphocytes have highlighted the significant role of Tregs in muscle recovery. Numerous studies have demonstrated that Tregs are essential for maintaining muscle tissue’s homeostasis, integrity, and functionality. They regulate skeletal muscle function and regeneration through IL6 receptor α signaling ( 201 201 202  Figure 3 203 204 42 Figure 3 Treg cell modulation of IFN-γ signaling to promote M1-to-M2 macrophage transition and resolve inflammation during muscle repair. The figure was drawn by Figdraw. STAT1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1; JAK1, janus kinase 1; PKC delta, protein kinase C delta, PI3K phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; M1, pro-inflammatory macrophage; M2, anti-inflammatory macrophage; IFN-γ, interferon-γ; P, phospholipid. Diagram illustrating the mechanism of immune regulation involving Treg cells and cytokine signaling. Treg cells inhibit the IFNγ receptor pathway, involving JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1 phosphorylation. This leads to STAT1 dimerization, affecting gene transcription and regulating the inflammatory response. Macrophage polarization is shown, with M1 macrophages transforming into M2, indicating immune modulation. Other T cell subsets, such as CD8 + + 205 + 206 + + 207 B lymphocytes B lymphocytes are key components of the immune system, playing essential roles in antibody production and the establishment of immune memory ( 208 209 210 in vitro 31 The role of B lymphocytes in TMI has been less extensively studied. However, their immune regulatory functions suggest they may indirectly support repair processes by modulating macrophage activity or secreting specific cytokines. B lymphocytes can influence macrophage phenotypes by releasing cytokines such as IL-10 ( 211 212 213 214 The functions of B lymphocytes in muscle injury and repair may mirror their roles in other tissue injuries. In liver disease, B cell activity not only aids in controlling infections but may also exacerbate tissue damage and fibrosis by amplifying chronic inflammation ( 215 216 217 B lymphocytes contribute to TMI repair by directly participating in tissue repair through cytokine secretion and regulating inflammatory responses. These insights provide a valuable foundation for understanding the mechanisms by which B lymphocytes influence TMI repair. Therapeutic strategies targeting immune cells for TMI repair In addition to conventional surgical management for advanced stages (Grade III and IV), current therapeutic strategies for TMI include the use of biomaterials, pharmacological agents, cell-based therapies, and physical rehabilitation approaches. Biomaterials effectively regulate the behavior of immune cells As clearly illustrated in  Table 4 220 221 218 225 218 in situ 223 224 Table 4 Biomaterial-based therapies for TMI and immune cell involvement. Classification Application Biomaterial Technology Specific Mechanism Immune Cell Effect Specific Efficacy References Acellular Scaffold Technology Natural polymers Exhibits excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mechanical properties; alleviates inflammatory response; promotes stem cell proliferation and differentiation Reduces inflammatory response; accelerates tissue regeneration Mitigates post-tendon-injury inflammation and enhances regenerative capacity ( 218 Cell Delivery and Tissue Engineering Cellular Carriers (e.g., Stem Cells) Provides biomimetic microenvironment; facilitates cell migration and proliferation Promotes macrophage polarization; improves immune microenvironment Enhances healing quality and repair efficiency of chronic injuries ( 219 Bioactive Polymers and Electrical Stimulation Bioactive Polymers (e.g., Hydrogels) Modifies material surface properties; provides mechanical support and growth factor release Promotes angiogenesis and neural precursor cell migration Enhances tendon regenerative apacity and mechanical properties ( 220 Natural and Synthetic Materials Natural Polymers (e.g., Collagen, Gelatin) Provides native scaffold architecture; supports cell adhesion and proliferation Promotes M1-to-M2 macrophage polarization Improves mechanical properties and tissue architecture of tendon regeneration ( 218 221 Mechanical Stimulation and Biomechanics Dynamic Mechanical Stimulation Devices Simulates biological environment; promotes tenocyte differentiation Enhances cell adhesion and proliferation capacity Improves mechanical properties and regenerative outcomes of tendon tissue ( 222 Immunomodulation Biomaterials Combined with Immunomodulators Regulates immune response; reduces inflammation and rejection Promotes muscle tissue repair via macrophage polarization modulation Improves post-muscle-injury immune microenvironment and accelerates tissue regeneration ( 218 Bioprinting Technology Bioprinted Scaffolds Provides precise three-dimensional structural support; facilitates cell distribution and proliferation Improves local microenvironment; promotes immunomodulation Achieves in-situ ( 223 Nanomaterials Nanofibrous Scaffolds Features high specific surface area and porosity; provides cellular adhesion sites Improves immune microenvironment; promotes macrophage polarization Enhances tendon regeneration efficiency and mechanical properties ( 224 Drug intervention balances immune cells in the inflammatory response Pharmacological interventions for TMI primarily aim to modulate inflammatory responses to preserve immune homeostasis and prevent excessive immune activation, which can hinder muscle regeneration ( 226 227 228 229 230 231 Cell therapy activates the regenerative potential of immune cells Cellular therapies promote muscle regeneration by modulating specific immune cell populations. Tregs are key mediators in this process, secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β to suppress pro-inflammatory signaling and establish a microenvironment conducive to tissue repair ( 232 233 234 235 Physical intervention non-invasively regulates the function of immune cells Physical interventions provide non-pharmacological strategies for immunomodulation in TMI. Massage therapy directly reduces neutrophil infiltration, disrupting inflammatory barriers that hinder muscle regeneration and exerting anti-inflammatory effects ( 136 236 In Summary, diverse immunotherapeutic strategies for TMI show translational promise across varying clinical readiness stages. Biomaterial-based therapies, such as decellularized scaffolds and hydrogels, modulate immune cell behavior to improve inflammatory microenvironments and support tissue regeneration, with preclinical validation demonstrating biocompatibility and efficacy, laying the groundwork for early-phase trials ( 237 238 239 234 101 240 241 242 Conclusions and future perspectives Immune cells infiltrate the site of muscle damage. Following this infiltration, signaling molecules such as cytokines and growth factors are released into the microenvironment. These molecules regulate muscle repair and regeneration by directly interacting with satellite cells, as illustrated in  Figure 1 In recent years, the rapid development of single-cell ( 243 244 245 246 247 247 248 Future research should focus on several critical aspects. The specific contributions and functional heterogeneity of immune cells in TMI repair remain unclear ( 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 257 259 256 257 Looking toward the future, the development of drug delivery systems with spatiotemporal specificity for fine-tuning the inflammation-regeneration balance, the investigation of immune crosstalk between organs, and the design of biomimetic materials that replicate the native extracellular matrix are imperative ( 13 260 Author contributions SP: Writing – original draft.
