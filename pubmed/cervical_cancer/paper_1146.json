Intrinsic or acquired drug resistance remains a major challenge, rendering clinically overt metastatic disease incurable in most patients. This review first examines key clinical trials and their primary outcomes involving targeted therapies in the most common advanced solid tumors, along with the main mechanisms underlying drug resistance. Recently, micrometastatic disease has emerged as a novel focus of investigation aimed at definitively curing advanced solid tumors. Accordingly, this review explores the biology of micrometastases, current challenges in their detection and monitoring, and the main strategies proposed to prevent their progression. The potential roles of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence‐driven predictive models are also discussed. Furthermore, we highlight specific characteristics of micrometastatic disease that favor immune modulation, and we evaluate the effectiveness of an immunotherapy regimen that inhibits immune suppression. The lead time provided by serum tumor markers, used experimentally to better track the progression of otherwise undetectable micrometastatic disease, also forms the mechanistic basis for a novel protocol we propose to prevent relapse in high‐risk cancer patients. This innovative protocol holds scientific relevance being supported by an appropriate mathematical model and ready for immediate application in clinical practice. In TME, undetectable DCCs (panel A) join with a low tumor burden along with low immune suppression, that favor successful immune manipulation through immune suppression inhibiting immune‐therapy. This moves the immune balance toward the immune response and likely makes more stable the dormant state of DCCs in the unstable metastatic niche and/or allows innate and adaptive immune response to kill the cancer cells. In clinically overt metastatic disease (panel B), higher tumor burden and immune suppression favor cancer cell proliferation and the arising of drug resistance. ↑ decreased IS; ↑ increased IS; ↑ further increased IS. solid tumors drug resistance micrometastatic disease immune suppression immune therapy serum tumor markers pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.09.2025  A.

While tamoxifen is often regarded as an “ante litteram” targeted therapy, the advent of the “targeted therapy” or “precision medicine” era is commonly dated to 2001, when Slamon et al. [ 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 More recently, the prevention of clinically manifest metastatic disease has been proposed as an emerging therapeutic paradigm aimed at achieving definitive cancer cures. This review seeks to contribute to this evolving discourse by first summarizing the principal clinical trials evaluating targeted therapies in the most prevalent advanced solid tumors, with emphasis on their key outcomes. In addition, the review addresses the principal mechanisms underlying therapeutic resistance. Although a substantial proportion of patients initially respond to endocrine therapies or cytotoxic chemotherapy, resistance—either intrinsic (primary) or acquired—inevitably ensues, leading to treatment failure. Drug resistance can arise following several mechanisms; for example, mutations within the target sequence, hampering the drug‐target binding, are widely reported as well as the activation of alternative pathways that can bypass the effect of the target inhibition and that can depend on activating mutation or overexpression of other oncogenic proteins. Particular attention is given to the critical role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) while mechanisms involving epigenetic dysregulation and less commonly reported pathways are also considered. Subsequently, this review outlines the biological rationale for targeting micrometastatic disease as a strategic approach for the definitive treatment of high‐risk patients with solid tumors. The potential contributions of nanotechnology and artificial intelligence (AI)‐driven predictive models, along with their projected development in the coming decade, are also explored. Within the context of emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing micrometastatic disease progression, a novel immune suppression‐inhibiting immunotherapy (IS‐IIT) schedule is proposed, with particular applicability to disseminated cancer cells (DCCs). Finally, the review discusses the kinetics of DCC proliferation, as inferred through serum tumor marker lead time (LT), and presents the mechanistic rationale underlying a protocol designed to eradicate DCCs in patients with solid tumors at high risk of relapse. 2 Targeted Therapies in Common Advanced Solid Tumors In this section, we review the characteristics of the principal clinical trials conducted with targeted therapies in the most common advanced solid tumors. Lung, breast, gastrointestinal, prostate, and ovarian cancers are discussed in separate subsections. 2.1 Non‐Small Cell Lung Cancer Lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease, which poses challenges for therapeutic decision‐making. In cases of advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), testing for predictive biomarkers is recommended, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS proto‐oncogene 1 (ROS1), proto‐oncogene B‐raf (BRAF) V600E, neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) and RET fusions, MET exon 14 skipping alterations, and programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression via immunohistochemistry (IHC) [ 8 9 8 9 2.1.1 Patients with Common (Exon 19 Deletion, Exon 21 L858R Mutation), Uncommon (S768I, L861Q, G719X Mutation) or Exon 20 Insertion EGFR Mutation‐Positive NSCLC In NSCLC adenocarcinomas, more than 85% of common EGFR mutations confer sensitivity to EGFR‐tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while the remaining ∼15% represent rare or uncommon EGFR mutations (Table 1 10 11 12 13 14 15 1 TABLE 1 Characteristics and findings in principal clinical trials carried out with the molecular targeted therapies as first line treatment of advanced NSCLC.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 2.4 Prostate Cancer According to the World Health Organization, prostate cancer is the third most common cancer and the second most frequently diagnosed cancer among men worldwide as of 2020 [ 89 120 89 120 121 122 123 124 CRPC frequently emerges through increased AR signaling; however, some tumors evolve toward AR independence due to genetic and epigenetic alterations and hormonal changes that drive cellular plasticity. Over the past two decades, treatment for both metastatic hormone‐sensitive (mHSPC) and metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) has shifted toward genomically guided and novel targeted therapies [ 125 126 In mHSPC, ADT remains the foundational first‐line therapy [ 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 Androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSIs), poly(ADP‐ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis), and immunotherapy represent emerging classes of targeted agents for defined molecular subsets. Despite advances in ADT, resistance often develops due to molecular alterations in AR signaling and the activation of AR‐driven transcriptional networks [ 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 Enzalutamide functions by inhibiting AR binding of androgens, their nuclear translocation, and DNA interaction, even in tumors overexpressing AR. It received US FDA approval for mCRPC based on outcomes from the AFFIRM (postdocetaxel) and PREVAIL (chemotherapy‐naive) phase III trials [ 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 To further extend the treatment landscape in metastatic prostate cancer, research has increasingly focused on tumor genomic profiling. PARPis have been evaluated for patients with alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) and/or homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes [ 151 152 153 154 BRCA ATM BRCA/ATM 155 Two additional phase III trials—TALAPRO‐2 and KEYLYNK‐010—focused on mCRPC populations. TALAPRO‐2 evaluated first‐line talazoparib plus enzalutamide versus placebo plus enzalutamide, including both HRR‐deficient patients and an unselected cohort. The rationale for the trial was based on preclinical evidence of crosstalk between AR and PARP pathways, supporting dual inhibition [ 156 157 158 The principal clinical trials involving ARSIs and PARPis, alone or in combination, for both mCRPC and mHSPC are summarized in Table 5 TABLE 5 Characteristics and findings in principal clinical trials carried out in mCRPC and in mHSPC with ARSIs and/or PARPis alone or in association.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 3 Mechanisms of Drug Resistance In this section, we analyze the mechanisms underlying both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance, with a particular focus on the critical role of TME in driving resistance development in certain cancer therapies. Additionally, drug resistance arising from epigenetic dysregulation and other often overlooked mechanisms is discussed. Antineoplastic agents rarely achieve definitive cures, even in highly chemo‐sensitive tumors. Drug resistance remains the primary cause of treatment failure and can arise from pre‐existing cellular characteristics (intrinsic resistance) or emerge as a consequence of therapy exposure (acquired resistance) [ 188 189 190 191 192 193 Nongenetic mechanisms encompass the ability of a subset of tumor cells to survive chemotherapy by exploiting nutrients and signaling molecules within the TME [ 194 195 196 3.1 Intrinsic Resistance The most common contributors to intrinsic resistance include inherited DNA variants, subpopulations of resistant cancer cells, and the activity of specific intracellular pathways that counteract the effects of particular drugs. While some of these factors may be involved in both intrinsic and acquired resistance, inherited genetic variants uniquely characterize intrinsic resistance, as they are present prior to treatment initiation. Recent studies have reported various inherited genetic variants that affect drug response through different mechanisms [ 197 For example, a study in NSCLC patients showed that the G allele of rs751402 in the ERCC5 promoter was associated with a poorer response to PBC compared with the A allele. This effect was likely due to increased ERCC5 expression and its role in nucleotide excision repair mechanisms [ 198 199 200 Mechanistically, this allele creates an AR binding site within a regulatory region, enhancing RFX6 expression and resulting in increased resistance to enzalutamide [ 200 201 202 Germline variants also impact the function of solute carriers (SLC), a protein family critical for drug uptake in cancer cells. Variants in SLC genes have been linked to drug resistance across various malignancies, including hematologic and solid tumors [ 203 204 204 205 Intrinsic resistance can also result from activation of specific cellular pathways that diminish drug efficacy. For example, cancer cells can evade KRAS G12C inhibitors through activation of the YAP pathway or via epithelial‐to‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes [ 206 207 208 3.2 Acquired Resistance Acquired resistance to cancer therapies can arise through various mechanisms, including oncogene activation, mutations, or altered expression of the target gene, and activation of specific pathways induced by the therapy itself [ 209 Acquired resistance has been documented across multiple therapeutic modalities and malignancies. TKI osimertinib is widely used in EGFR‐mutated NSCLC; however, resistance to this treatment almost inevitably develops. Two primary mechanisms have been described: EGFR‐independent (off‐target) and EGFR‐dependent (on‐target) resistance. Among off‐target mechanisms, MET gene amplification is the most common, though other alterations such as HER2 amplification, MYC, MDM2/CDK4, CCND1, PIK3CA, and KRAS mutations, BRAF fusions, and RB1 loss‐of‐function mutations have also been reported. These genetic changes activate downstream signaling pathways that bypass EGFR inhibition. On‐target resistance frequently involves mutations in EGFR itself, with C797S and T790M being the most prevalent. Less common EGFR mutations associated with resistance include L718Q, G796S, and S778I [ 210 These findings were corroborated by Bayle et al. [ 211 211 211 Another mode of acquired resistance involves activation of intracellular signaling pathways. For instance, Egeland et al. [ 212 SFKs have also been shown to be systematically activated following targeted inhibition of BRAFV600E‐mutant metastatic CRC, limiting the efficacy of this approach [ 213 Moreover, KRAS‐ and BRAF‐mutant CRC can acquire resistance to anti‐EGFR therapies through activation of the PKC/CRAF/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, mediated by enhanced lipid metabolism. Wang et al. [ 214 214 Intracellular pathways can also be activated as an adaptive response that cancer cells employ to circumvent therapeutic effects. For example, activation of the RAS pathway through alternative upstream mediators such as EGFR, FGFR1, IGFR, and AXL has been observed following KRAS inhibitor therapy [ 206 3.3 Tumor Microenvironment The effectiveness of cancer therapies is profoundly influenced by the activity of immune, endothelial, and mesenchymal cells within the TME. Additionally, factors such as hypoxia, the composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM), and the secretion of specific soluble mediators by cells play crucial roles in this context. Consequently, the TME is a key determinant in the development of drug resistance for certain cancer treatments. In breast cancer, TME‐associated resistance arises through multiple mechanisms, as comprehensively reviewed by Salemme et al. [ 215 215 l 216 Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) also contribute to drug resistance by remodeling the ECM and limiting T cell infiltration into the TME. This remodeling activates the PI3K/AKT and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2 pathways, conferring resistance to multiple anticancer therapies [ 215 216 216 216 216 Beyond TAM and CAF activity, the host immune response and immunotherapy efficacy are significantly compromised by hypoxia, a common feature in many tumors. In lung cancer mouse models, Robles‐Oteiza et al. [ 217 217 217 3.4 Noncoding RNAs, Epigenetic Control, and Further Mechanisms Another often overlooked mechanism contributing to drug resistance involves the dysregulation of noncoding RNAs and epigenetic processes, which can lead to aberrant activation or suppression of specific intracellular cancer‐related pathways. In chemoresistant tumor cells, decreased levels of tumor‐suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs) alongside increased levels of oncogenic miRNAs promote multidrug resistance (MDR) [ 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 Emerging evidence indicates that tumor cells employ multiple mechanisms to evade cytotoxic drug effects, predominantly through epigenetic reprogramming of gene expression. The two principal epigenetic modifications are: (1) DNA methylation and (2) histone modifications via acetylation or methylation. Both mechanisms differentially regulate chromatin accessibility, thereby influencing transcriptional activity [ 226 227 228 229 Alternative splicing, involving the removal of noncoding sequences from pre‐mRNA and rearrangement of coding segments, produces protein isoforms with diverse or even opposing functions. Dysregulation of alternative splicing contributes to numerous cancer hallmarks, including therapy resistance, by altering the expression of critical genes. Furthermore, a subpopulation of tumor cells can evade chemotherapy and targeted therapy by entering a reversible, slow‐proliferation state known as the drug‐tolerant persister (DTP) phenotype until additional resistance mechanisms emerge. Increasing evidence suggests that DTP cells adapt to varying microenvironments through modulation of epigenomic and transcriptomic profiles, metabolic reprogramming, and interactions with the TME [ 230 4 Micrometastatic Disease: Biology and Challenges Micrometastatic disease, occult DCCs, minimal residual disease (MiRD), and the more recently adopted term molecular residual disease are often used synonymously. Currently, residual micrometastatic disease following primary tumor resection, along with drug resistance, represent the major barriers to achieving a definitive cancer cure. The mechanisms underlying the dissemination, dormancy, and reactivation of DCCs, as well as their detection and monitoring, have been extensively reviewed by us [ 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 4.1 Biology of Micrometastases Tumor dormancy is a pivotal concept in understanding residual micrometastatic disease, wherein cancer cells persist following primary treatment. This phenomenon encompasses two distinct, yet not mutually exclusive, forms: tumor mass dormancy and cellular dormancy. Tumor mass dormancy refers to a state of equilibrium within a tumor mass, characterized by a balance between cell proliferation and cell death, whereas cellular dormancy involves a slow‐cycling or nonproliferative state with reversible, transient growth arrest. Tumor mass dormancy is often termed “angiogenic dormancy” or “immunogenic dormancy,” reflecting the predominant regulatory mechanisms involved. Angiogenic dormancy precedes the “angiogenic switch,” a transition marked by rapid tumor growth driven by neovascularization. The balance between proliferation and cell death critically depends on the availability of oxygen and nutrients supplied by pre‐existing blood vessels. Increased proliferation can deplete oxygen and nutrients within TME, especially in regions distant from vasculature, ultimately establishing an equilibrium between proliferation and cell death. In immunogenic dormancy, this equilibrium is maintained through host immune surveillance, whereby T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells recognize and eliminate tumor cells via tumor‐specific or stress‐induced surface antigens. Additionally, interferon‐γ (IFN‐γ), produced by Th1 cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells, promotes dormancy through STAT1‐dependent and ‐independent pathways, including the indoleamine 2,3‐dioxygenase 1 (IDO1)–kynurenine (Kyn)–aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)–p27 axis. Consequently, tumor cell growth is tightly regulated by the host immune system [ 239 Cellular dormancy is characterized by quiescence, where solitary cancer cells undergo a reversible growth arrest, often linked to slow or halted progression through the G0‐to‐G1 phase of the cell cycle. DCCs originating from the primary tumor reach peripheral organs or tissues via the vasculature. These early‐seeder circulating tumor cells (CTCs) extravasate into the perivascular niche, where they receive physical support from vessel walls and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) acting as pericytes. The formation of the metastatic niche by early‐seeder CTCs is driven by tumor‐ and tissue‐specific gene expression patterns and chemokine secretion, a process termed “organotropism” or cancer cell “homing,” accounting for the divergent biology of metastatic niches compared with primary tumors [ 231 Beyond reversible growth arrest, dormant cancer cells exhibit reduced metabolic activity and undergo chromatin and epigenetic alterations, facilitating durable dormancy. The niche is crucial for maintaining this state, involving pathways such as Wnt/Notch, TGFβ, mitogen‐ and stress‐activated kinase 1 (MSK1), Hedgehog proteins, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. These often converge on mTOR, MAPK/ERK, and p38 effector pathways, which are essential for niche maintenance. The small GTPase Cdc42 also contributes by enhancing p38 signaling and inducing growth arrest to sustain dormancy. At the metastatic niche, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, alongside autophagy, angiogenesis, immune editing, hypoxia, and metabolism, cooperate with the TME to promote and sustain cancer dormancy and cell dormancy [ 240 The awakening of dormant cancer cells is another critical aspect in residual micrometastatic disease biology. Breakdown of dormancy‐maintaining mechanisms occurs under the integrated influence of multiple factors, which can be categorized into nonimmunological and immunological mechanisms. Nonimmunological factors include systemic inflammation, ECM stiffness, aging TME, and physiological stresses that promote angiogenesis. ECM remodeling, interactions with stromal cells, nutrient availability, and other host factors also contribute. Furthermore, interactions with pericytes, fibroblasts, and vascular endothelial cells via growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines are pivotal in tumor relapse by reactivating slow‐cycling/dormant cancer cells [ 231 239 Chronic inflammation also promotes awakening of dormant tumor cells. Cytotoxic proteins and proteases activate dormant cells in the lungs through integrin‐mediated focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/ERK/myosin light chain (MLC) kinase (MLCK)/Yes‐associated protein 1 signaling, driven by sequential protease‐mediated laminin remodeling. In the liver, dormant breast cancer cells are likely reactivated by liver‐specific pericytes secreting CXCL12, which induces CXCR4‐mediated NK cell quiescence and promotes CXCR4‐dependent outgrowth of dormant cancer cells [ 231 239 Last, the multifaceted roles of extracellular heat shock proteins (Hsp) in tumor dormancy and reactivation have been recently reviewed. The review describes in detail how these proteins, transported via vesicles and microvesicles, influence dormancy programs and tumor awakening [ 240 4.2 Detection and Monitoring MiRD is commonly associated with involvement of the bone marrow or regional lymph nodes. According to the International Union Against Cancer, tumor cells measuring between 0.2 and 2 mm are classified as metastatic initiating cells [ 241 242 243 244 245 231 231 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 246 251 6.1 More recently, advances in technology have enabled detection of ctDNA and circulating cfDNA in blood samples, termed “liquid biopsy,” which has emerged as a novel, noninvasive tool for monitoring MiRD and predicting clinical recurrence. Several blood‐based monitoring studies have demonstrated that MiRD detection often correlates with clinical disease recurrence with an LT of a few months. However, it remains unclear whether treatment changes prompted by ctDNA detection improve clinical outcomes [ 253 The personalized tumor‐informed approach targets pre‐existing mutations, enabling deeper sequencing. For example, in early‐stage NSCLC, the Patient‐specific pROgnostic and Potential tHErapeutic marker Tracking (PROPHET) assay utilized deep sequencing of 50 patient‐specific variants. PROPHET achieved 45% sensitivity at baseline and outperformed fixed‐panel assays prognostically, anticipating recurrence detected by radiology by a median of 299 days [ 254 255 In the cTRAK TN clinical trial [ 256 p 257 Overall, these advanced technologies are currently not routinely implemented in clinical practice. Furthermore, these biomarkers cannot yet distinguish whether detected ctDNA originates from dormant versus proliferating tumor cells [ 258 4.3 Therapeutic Vulnerabilities Therapeutic vulnerabilities in MiRD that we have previously reported [ 231 259 DCCs likely acquire unique genetic features and gene expression signatures that contribute to heterogeneity among different metastases, as well as differences compared with the preinvasive or primary tumor lesions from which they originate [ 260 261 235 236 238 Accordingly, Phan and Croucher [ 262 236 263 Moreover, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play critical roles in inducing and maintaining dormancy in DCCs [ 236 264 265 Additionally, several studies have reported that cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth are closely linked to immune inhibition and evasion mechanisms [ 266 267 268 269 270 Overall, quiescent metastatic niches and/or low tumor burden are likely associated with reduced immune suppression and greater potential for successful immune‐based therapeutic manipulation. 5 Emerging Strategies to Overcome Resistance and Eradicate Micrometastases All patients with locally advanced disease or radically operable recurrence are potential candidates for alternative therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing the progression of MiRD to clinically overt metastatic disease [ 231 259 In this section, currently proposed therapeutic strategies—based on experimental findings—are categorized into “next‐generation targeted agents,” “combinatorial approaches,” and “therapies targeting the TME.” For each category, strategies focusing on the “sleeping,” “killing or depletion,” and “awakening” of DCCs are actively being investigated [ 258 271 236 239 272 Additionally, a novel immunotherapy regimen as well as emerging contributions from nanotechnology and AI‐driven predictive models are also discussed. 5.1 Next‐Generation Targeted Agents 5.1.1 Sleeping Strategy Hyperexpression of factors that promote dormancy or inhibit growth can induce or maintain the dormant state. Debio‐0719, a lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 inhibitor, promotes breast cancer dormancy by decreasing proliferation markers Ki67 and ERK, while enhancing the p38 pathway, which suppresses growth [ 273 Histone modifications and increased DNA methylation represent epigenetic mechanisms through which DCCs maintain dormancy. Accordingly, HDACs inhibitors among several epigenome‐targeting agents, have received US FDA approval and demonstrated efficacy in experimental studies. Specifically, HDACs inhibitors epigenetically upregulate the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, thereby promoting dormancy in breast cancer cells [ 274 275 276 Other targets for inducing dormancy include MSK1, a positive regulator of metastatic dormancy in ER‐positive breast cancer, and regucalcin, which enhances key hallmarks of tumor dormancy in prostate cancer [ 277 278 Preventing neovascularization is another established strategy to induce tumor dormancy, first demonstrated in 1972 by Gimbrone Jr. et al. [ 279 280 281 282 283 258 284 5.1.2 Direct Killing of Dormant Cancer Cells Nimustine, an alkylating agent, completely eradicated tumors in a BRCA1/p53‐deficient mouse model, where platinum‐chemotherapy–refractory tumor cells remained sensitive to this drug [ 285 286 The protein kinase RNA‐like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) also supports the survival of dormant cancer cells [ 287 288 287 289 290 291 Additional therapeutic approaches to directly eliminate disseminated dormant tumor cells include peptide‐mimetic copolymers and targeting the survival kinase dual‐specificity tyrosine phosphorylation‐regulated kinase 1B (DYRK1B). Peptide‐mimetic copolymers disrupt cell membranes to remove dormant PC‐3 prostate cancer cells resistant to docetaxel [ 292 293 293 5.2 Combinatorial Approaches 5.2.1 Sleeping Strategy In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), the retinoic acid–regulated orphan nuclear receptor NR2F1 promotes cellular dormancy [ 294 295 296 294 294 294 NCT03572387 5.2.2 Killing or Depletion Strategy Inhibition of the SFK pathway induces dormancy in breast cancer cells, while combined inhibition of SFK and MEK1/2 eradicates dormant cells and reduces metastases [ 297 298 299 300 Hydroxychloroquine and other US FDA‐approved autophagy inhibitors have been tested alone or in combination with various agents to prevent relapse in breast cancer patients harboring bone marrow DCCs. In the CLEVER trial ( NCT03032406 301 302 NCT04523857 NCT04841148 Targeting Unc‐51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 in combination with CPT‐11 also reduces the proliferation of dormant cancer cells [ 303 304 305 5.2.3 Awakening Strategy Combining a reactivation strategy with conventional chemotherapy, as suggested by many studies, could potentially exacerbate disease progression; therefore, careful management is essential. LB1, a protein phosphatase 2A inhibitor, can reactivate dormant cancer cells by activating AKT and interfering with p53‐mediated cell cycle arrest, thereby sensitizing cells to cytotoxic agents. This mechanism has been validated in the treatment of HNSCC [ 306 307 308 309 310 Disseminated dormant breast cancer cells typically exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype [ 311 312 5.3 Targeting the TME 5.3.1 Sleeping Strategy Metastatic and premetastatic niches are specialized microenvironments that undergo continuous remodeling driven by ECM modifications and tumor‐specific signals. The interactions between DCCs and the ECM play a critical role and represent potential therapeutic targets. Often, the TME within the metastatic niche induces cell dormancy, particularly through signals that inhibit proliferation while promoting survival. Notably, microenvironmental factors such as TGFβ2 [ 313 314 315 316 315 317 318 319 320 321 Inhibiting growth‐promoting factors—including urokinase receptors [ 322 323 297 287 294 324 325 326 324 325 327 Osteoblast‐induced dormancy has been demonstrated in prostate cancer cells, with the FAK inhibitor PF‐562271 recapitulating osteoblast‐mediated dormancy [ 328 278 329 330 331 332 314 333 334 5.3.2 Killing or Depletion Strategy In pancreatic cancer models, linsitinib, which inhibits IGF1 or IGF‐1 receptor along with AKT, favors the elimination of dormant cancer cells not expressing mutant KRAS or c‐MYC [ 290 5.3.3 Awakening Strategy Cells surrounding micrometastases regulate dormancy or proliferation through direct interactions and the release of cytokines and environmental cues [ 300 335 315 336 337 338 7 TABLE 7 Main therapeutic strategies targeting micrometastases.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 5.3.4 Immunotherapy Immune cells are a key component of the TME, and immune‐related mechanisms can prevent disease progression by maintaining tumor cell dormancy. Tumors derived from the 4T07 mouse breast cancer cell line exhibit a higher frequency of CD39+PD1+CD8+ T cells compared with those from the 4T1 line. The 4T07 tumors prime CD8+ T cells to promote dormancy and prevent relapse [ 321 339 Conversely, dormant cancer cells can evade immune surveillance by downregulating NK cell activity, thereby escaping NK cell recognition and cytotoxicity, while maintaining a stem‐like state conducive to dissemination [ 321 340 341 342 343 321 344 345 NCT04841148 346 Building on the above mentioned MiRD therapeutic vulnerabilities, we recently proposed a drug regimen aimed at inhibiting immune suppression, termed IS‐IIT. We have reported preliminary evidence supporting its efficacy in a small cohort, including two patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) following radical prostatectomy and two additional cancer patients with likely MiRD after primary tumor removal [ 347 260 269 263 236 249 347 231 8 TABLE 8 Main findings in four prostate cancer patients who after radical prostatectomy (RP) with ( N N Patient Last PSA  N Age (yrs) RP (date) Gleason (grade) pTNM DFI  a PSA at BCR  b ng/mL date Follow‐up from BCR (mo) IS‐IIT cycles (N) TPTR injections (N) Adjuvant RT (1) RG 65 12‐01‐2010 4 + 4 (4) pT3bN0M0 36 0.23 0.05 11‐03‐25 143 82 7 No (2) BS 57 09‐10‐2009 4 + 5 (1) pT3aN0Mx 133  c 0.24  c1 <0.01 10‐12‐24 127  c2 85 No No (3) DE 71 11‐02‐2019 4 + 4 (4) pT3bN0R1M0 3 0.67 <0.35 24‐04‐25 72 37 4 Yes (4) LG 75 12‐06‐2020 3 + 4 (2) pT3bN0R1Mx 5 0.23 0.97 14‐03‐25 51 27 3 No  a Time from RP to BCR.  b Last value after BCR and before the beginning of treatment.  c Time to local recurrence (27x26 mm nodule) treated with salvage radiotherapy (RT).  c1 Value before the beginning of IS‐IIT, 24 months after salvage RT.  c2 Time following salvage RT; TPTR: triptorelin; also see reference [ 347 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. These findings suggest that IS‐IIT cycles, initiated soon after BCR, substantially slowed PSA progression and synergized with triptorelin to further reduce PSA levels. To date, in these high‐risk patients, prolonged IS‐IIT combined with intermittent triptorelin injections has prevented BCR progression to clinically overt metastatic disease (Table 8 5.4 Nanotechnology and Drug Delivery The field of nanotechnology for drug delivery dates back to the 1960s, when liposome structures were first characterized. However, it took nearly 30 years before the first nanomedicines entered clinical use. Here, we briefly examine the current role of nanotechnology in targeting MiRD. The evolution of nanomedicines as nanoparticles (NPs), also known as nano‐carriers (NCs), with diameters ranging from 1 to 100 nm, reflects advances in nanomedical engineering and nanomedicine. Polymeric, inorganic, and lipid‐based NCs are the most common forms, each tailored to meet specific therapeutic needs. NCs serve as delivery vehicles that transport active substances to their intended targets, which may be tissues, cells, or even individual molecules [ 348 The clinical approval of NP‐based agents faces multiple challenges [ 349 350 351 352 353 354 Despite these advances, relatively few NP‐based therapeutics have received regulatory approval and entered clinical practice, and none specifically target micrometastases. A recent study utilizing imaging methods to quantify NP delivery to micrometastases concluded that developing predictive models based on micrometastasis physiology could enable personalized treatments tailored to individual patient microenvironments [ 355 In EOC, micrometastases persist within the abdominal cavity, contributing to tumor recurrence and rendering the disease incurable. A recent review [ 356 357 225 225 Finally, miRNAs represent promising therapeutic targets, and developing efficient miRNA delivery systems is a key objective. Nanomaterials enhance miRNA stability in circulation, improve cellular uptake, and enable targeted delivery to specific organs or cell types. A recent review [ 358 5.5 AI‐Driven Predictive Models AI algorithms can effectively capture tumor complexity arising from the interplay between genes and their downstream effects within biological network structures [ 359 360 361 362 363 With advances in high‐throughput sequencing, the field of omics has rapidly expanded, offering unprecedented opportunities alongside significant challenges in data analysis and interpretation for predictive modeling in precision medicine. Deep learning (DL), particularly convolutional neural networks, has driven impressive progress in predictive modeling. This approach not only improves predictive accuracy but also employs transfer learning to optimize computational efficiency and model performance. However, challenges remain, including model interpretability, data volume and heterogeneity, and the limited ability of current models to fully capture intrinsic biological complexity. Large datasets provide valuable insights into molecular processes and opportunities for modeling drug efficacy prediction. Yet, the increasing complexity of models may reduce their utility for biological discovery and undermine confidence in clinical application. AI and ML‐based methodologies [ 364 365 Transfer learning further facilitates the repurposing of knowledge gained from large datasets to improve accuracy in smaller cohorts [ 366 367 368 In conclusion, AI‐driven predictive models have the potential to address key challenges in micrometastatic disease, including the identification of reliable biomarkers for improved detection, imaging, and postoperative monitoring, as well as the discovery of suitable therapeutic targets and drug candidates. 6 The Kinetics of DCCs Growth and a Protocol to Counteract Micrometastatic Progression in Solid Tumors at High Risk of Relapse This section deals with the kinetics of DCCs growth and the mechanistic rationale of a proposed protocol to counteract the progression of DCCs. 6.1 The Kinetics of DCCs Growth A micrometastasis becomes detectable when it reaches a volume threshold of approximately 0.5 cm for positron emission tomography/computed tomography (CT) imaging, which corresponds to the accuracy of a single voxel, or roughly 0.065 cm 3 244 369 3 370 Three widely used models to approximate the growth kinetics of primary tumors and micrometastases are exponential, logistic, and Gompertzian [ 234 244 371 234 371 3 371 In breast cancer patients, we conducted a study involving intensive postoperative surveillance using more sensitive thresholds called “individual reference limits” (IRLs) for the serum tumor markers CEA, TPA, and CA 15.3. The mean LTs observed were 7, 8.8, and 8.5 months, respectively [ 246 247 248 249 372 252 373 374 375 376 9 TABLE 9 Overall median lead time (mo.) obtained from mean serum CEA, TPA, CA15.3, CA125, HE4, and PSA lead time for “early” detection of relapse during postoperative monitoring of untreated, disease‐free breast, colorectal, ovarian, and prostate cancer patients.

[ 246 247 248 249 252 372 373 374 375 376 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. To better characterize the growth dynamics of DCCs and optimize the duration of IS‐IIT cycles, we calculated the mean serum tumor marker LT using experimental data from 10 untreated or drug‐resistant patients with the same tumor types enrolled at our oncologic center: prostate ( n n n n 9 Importantly, in six of the 11 recurrences (54%), the IRL (in five cases) and BCR (in one case) were the relevant thresholds, rather than the conventional laboratory reference values typically used in the literature. These thresholds proved to be more sensitive for early detection. Kinetic analysis also enabled us to estimate the mean tumor doubling time (TDT), which was 136 days. This value is comparable to the TDT reported for colorectal lung metastases, which ranges from 109 to 171 days [ 234 377 378 379 S1 S2 S1 S2 6.2 The Mechanistic Rationale We have recently characterized the dormant state of DCCs as an unstable virtual equilibrium (defined as a “virtual equilibrium line = 0”), which can be disrupted at any time by cellular awakening and proliferation. It is hypothesized that dormant DCCs in secondary tissues may evade conventional anticancer immune responses through a process of immune editing [ 236 We propose that IS‐IIT cycles may shift this dynamic balance toward enhanced immune response thereby stabilizing the unstable dormant state and/or directly eliminating the DCCs (Figure 1 FIGURE 1 In TME, undetectable DCCs (panel A) join with a low tumor burden along with low immune suppression, that favor successful immune manipulation through immune suppression inhibiting immune‐therapy. This moves the immune balance towards the immune response and likely makes more stable the dormant state of DCCs in the unstable metastatic niche and/or allows innate and adaptive immune response to kill the cancer cells. In clinically overt metastatic disease (panel B), higher tumor burden and immune suppression favor cancer cell proliferation and the arising of drug resistance. DCCs, disseminated cancer cells; DR, drug resistance; IB, immune balance; IR, immune response (NK, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells); IS‐IIT, immune suppression inhibiting immunotherapy; IS, immune suppression (Tregs, macrophages, MDSCs); IT, immune‐therapy; TB, tumor burden; TME, tumor microenvironment. Based on our kinetic analysis of DCC growth, we estimated a median LT of approximately 9 months for tumors with intermediate biological aggressiveness. For tumors with low or high aggressiveness, this value may vary by approximately ±2 months. Considering the possibility of proliferating foci escaping IS‐IIT, we subtracted an additional 2 months from each interval to allow conventional therapies to intercept progressing MiRD. The recommended intervals for alternating IS‐IIT and conventional antiproliferative therapies in tumors of varying biological aggressiveness are outlined in Table 10 TABLE 10 Additional adjuvant therapy proposed in solid tumors in patients with locally advanced disease or radically resected metastases. Immunotherapy (IT)  a Conventional therapy  a IS‐IIT Years 1–7 Years 1–5 Years 6–7 Hormone therapy  c Chemotherapy Tumor biological aggressiveness  b Interval time (mo.)

[ 347 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. For tumors with high or low biological aggressiveness, the IS‐IIT cycle duration should be adjusted to 5 or 9 months, respectively, as described above. Biological aggressiveness should be assessed based on histology, tumor grade, the number of involved loco‐regional lymph nodes, and the proliferation index. In cases of relapsed disease following radical resection, at least an intermediate level of aggressiveness should be assumed. Factors such as primary tumor type, disease‐free interval, number and site of radically resected metastases, and additional prognostic biomarkers may assist in identifying patients with high‐risk biology. For endocrine‐dependent cancers—particularly prostate cancer—our recent findings (see Table 8 231 347 During this extended treatment phase, the patient's immune system—repeatedly challenged by multiple episodes of proliferative activity—is more likely to acquire the capability through the memory T cells of effectively controlling future micrometastatic progressions. The proposed schedule for extended adjuvant immune, hormonal, or chemotherapeutic treatment in high‐risk cancer patients is provided in Table 10 7 Conclusions and Prospects High‐risk patients with solid tumors frequently develop clinically overt metastatic disease, which remains the leading cause of mortality in this population. The era of targeted therapies, which began over two decades ago with high expectations, has undoubtedly led to significant advances in molecular biology and genetics, fundamentally transforming cancer treatment paradigms. While some patient subsets have experienced substantial improvements in disease‐free survival and/or OS, the majority of patients have derived only marginal benefits. More importantly, even among initially responsive patients, the emergence of intrinsic or acquired drug resistance renders metastatic disease largely incurable. Despite these limitations, multinational pharmaceutical companies continue to heavily invest in the targeted therapy paradigm, often in collaboration with institutional researchers and public funding frequently at the expense of exploring promising alternative strategies. This review begins by summarizing key findings from major clinical trials involving targeted therapies in the most common advanced solid tumors, along with an analysis of the primary mechanisms underlying drug resistance. It then explores how recent advances in our understanding of micrometastatic seeding and latency in peripheral tissues account for development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing micrometastatic disease progression. In the subsequent sections, we discuss the potential of nanotechnology and AI‐driven predictive modeling to address and overcome therapeutic challenges in this evolving field. Furthermore, insights into MiRD and the immunological conditions favoring its manipulation have allowed us to propose a novel preventive therapeutic strategy aimed at achieving durable remission—or potentially a cure—in high‐risk patients with solid tumors. Central to this approach is immune manipulation, designed to be less susceptible to conventional drug resistance mechanisms. Importantly, resistance could be further mitigated by the brief duration and alternating nature of accompanying conventional therapies. We also highlight the utility of serum tumor marker LT as a unique experimental tool to monitor the progression of undetectable micrometastatic disease and calculate TDT. The proposed 7‐year treatment protocol aims to maintain a stable dormant state at micrometastatic niches, thereby enabling the “educated” immune system to autonomously eliminate any emergent proliferative foci over time. In conclusion, this review critically evaluates the role and limitations of current targeted therapies in the most prevalent advanced solid tumors, while also addressing the biological and therapeutic complexity of MiRD. Based on both our own and others' experimental and clinical data, we present a novel treatment protocol offering high‐risk cancer patients an alternative and potentially curative strategy. This protocol is intended to be validated in future prospective, randomized clinical trials. Author Contributions A.N. conceived, wrote, and revised the review article. P.F. wrote and revised.
