DKD develops in approximately 40% of patients with diabetes ( 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 13 14 15 16 18 18 9 19 20 21 Here, we used metabolomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic approaches to test our hypothesis and to explore early changes in kidney cells that promote kidney protection. These studies revealed a biologic role for methionine metabolism and the S Results Kidneys of mice lacking SGLT2 function are protected from injury in HFD conditions. We used a mouse model known as Sweet Pee (SP) that carries a missense mutation in the Slc5a2 Supplemental Figure 1A https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI188933DS1 22 Figure 1A Figure 1, B and C Supplemental Figure 1B Figure 1, D–F Supplemental Figure 1C HFD Figure 1, D and E Supplemental Figure 1C HFD HFD HFD Figure 1, G and H Supplemental Figure 1D HFD HFD Figure 1, I and J Figure 1, K and L Supplemental Figure 1E Tagln Acta2 Fn1 Vim Col1a1 Col3a1 HFD HFD Supplemental Figure 1F Supplemental Figure 1G Supplemental Figure 1H Emergence of a population of PTCs with injury phenotype in the setting of HFD. To determine early transcriptional changes in kidney cells triggered by HFD, single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) was performed as described ( 23 Supplemental Figure 2A Figure 2, A and B Figure 2, A and B HFD HFD Figure 2, C and D Supplemental Figure 3A Supplemental Figure 3B Lrp2 Slc5a2 Slc22a6 Slc7a13 Slc12a1 Umod Figure 2B Supplemental Figure 2B Slc12a1 Umod 24 Slc5a1 Supplemental Figure 4 RNA-Seq analysis identified metabolic and inflammatory gene signatures in PT-HFD. Because of the known alteration of metabolic gene signatures in PTCs in the setting of diabetes, we explored changes in metabolism-related gene signatures in PT-HFD.

Given the prominent role that inflammation is known to play in progression of kidney disease in the setting of diabetes as well as in other kidney diseases that respond favorably to SGLT2 inhibitors ( 18 25 26 In keeping with increased NF-kB activity, Western blot analysis showed the expression of phospho-/total NF-kB p65 was increased in renal cortex harvested from WT HFD HFD Figure 3B Tnf Il1 Ccl2 Il6 Icam1 HFD HFD Figure 3C HFD Figure 2D HFD HFD Figure 3D 26 27 Supplemental Figure 6 Supplemental Figure 7 Supplemental Figure 8 The Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) family of transcription factors, including FOS, JUN, and JUNB, cooperate with the NF-κB complex to promote inflammatory signals ( 28 31 Fos Jun Junb Supplemental Figure 9 Fos HFD Supplemental Figure 9C Fos Jun HFD Supplemental Figure 9D Methionine metabolism is altered in kidneys of mice under HFD conditions. As our RNA-Seq analysis suggested changes in metabolic gene signatures when SGLT2 function is lost, metabolomic analysis was performed on tissue harvested from the renal cortex and serum of SGLT2 WT and SP mice under both diet conditions at 8 weeks. In the renal cortex, 57% of cellular diversity and 77% of protein mass are derived from PTCs ( 32 Supplemental Figures 10 and 11 Supplemental Tables 2 and 3 HFD HFD Figure 4A 21 33 Figure 4B HFD Figure 4C Mat2a Figure 4D Supplemental Figure 6D Supplemental Figure 7C Supplemental Figure 8C Mat2a Inhibition of the SAM synthetase MAT2A in SP HFD Since SAM and Mat2a HFD HFD Figure 4, C and D HFD HFD Supplemental Figure 12 Figure 5A Figure 5B Figure 5, C–E HFD HFD Figure 5, F and G Mat2a HFD Mat2a HFD Methionine modulation controlled tubular phenotypic changes in DKD. To further understand the role of SAM and methionine metabolism in the phenotypes observed in SP HFD Figure 6, A and B HFD HFD Figure 6C Figure 6D While inhibition of MAT2A is predicted to reduce SAM levels, we also wanted to test whether SAM supplementation is sufficient to rescue PTCs when exposed to high glucose (HG) and whether it can overcome the negative effect of the MAT2Ai. HG-treated, immortalized, renal PTCs (HK-2 cells) were treated with SAM for 48 h ( Figure 7A Figure 7, B and C Figure 7D Figure 7D Figure 7E Figure 7F Mice treated with an SGLT2 inhibitor phenocopied SGLT2 genetic LOF. To determine whether the phenotype observed in SGLT2 LOF mice was similar to pharmacological inhibition of SGLT2, HFD-fed mice were treated with the SGLT2 inhibitor Canagliflozin (Cana). WT mice were prefed HFD for 4 weeks and subsequently administered placebo (0.5% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose [HPMC]) with or without Cana (20 mg/kg/day) via daily oral gavage for 8 weeks ( Supplemental Figure 13A Supplemental Figure 13B Supplemental Figure 13 Supplemental Figure 13 Supplemental Figure 13 Supplemental Figure 13 scRNA-Seq analysis revealed that Cana suppressed the emergence of the PT-HFD subpopulation ( Supplemental Figure 14A HFD Supplemental Figure 14 Fos Il1b Supplemental Figure 14D Supplemental Figure 14E Enhanced repressive trimethylation of H3K27 in inflammatory pathway genes following HFD in mice with SGLT2 LOF.

The mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibition alters methionine metabolism remains unclear. Given that SAM and glucose metabolism are interconnected through the 1-carbon metabolic network ( 40 Malat1 MAT2A 41 42 mTOR Malat1 Taken together, we have identified modulation of methionine metabolism in kidneys of HFD-fed mice and identified protective methylation in mice lacking the SGLT2 cotransporter. These data support a model and mechanism by which an altered metabolite directly drives cellular responses to prevent injury. Methods Sex as a biological variable. For studies involving animal models, male mice were used because male animals are known to exhibit less variability in phenotype. However, the single-nucleus RNA sequencing analyses included datasets that included both male and female human samples as well as female ob ob Mouse models. SGLT2 mutant (MT) and WT C3H/HeJ (C3H) male mice (10 weeks old) were fed a HFD (60% calories from fat) (TD.06414; Envigo) or ND for 8 or 18 weeks. For MAT2Ai treatment, WT and MT mice were fed a HFD for 8 weeks and then treated with placebo (DMSO) or 2 dosages of ( E N 41 43 Genotyping and detection of urinary glucose excretion. Genomic DNA was isolated from mouse tails, and PCR was used to identify SP mutants with the following primers to produce a 470 bp PCR product: sense 5′-TGTGAGGCTGTCCCAAGAATGT-3′ and antisense 5′-TCAGAGTCCCAGCATTTGGTCT-3′. The PCR product was then digested with restriction enzyme TaqI (T↓CGA) for 90 min at 65°C (WT: 2 bands at 225 and 245 bp; heterozygous mutant: 3 bands at 225, 245, and 470 bp; homozygous mutant: 1 band at 470 bp). The urinary glucose excretion was determined using urine strips (11895362160; Roche Diagnostics) ( Supplemental Figure 1A Cell culture. HK-2 human PTCs were procured from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-2190; ATCC) and grown in Keratinocyte serum-free medium (17005-042; Gibco) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 Preparation of single-cell suspension. Kidneys from male SGLT2 WT/MT mice fed with ND or HFD for 8 weeks were harvested. Kidneys were minced with a sterile razor blade into small pieces (<1 mm in diameter) after removing capsule. Approximately 65 mg tissue was digested in 1.5 mL digestion buffer including Liberase TM (0.3 mg/mL; 291963; Roche), hyaluronidase (10 μg/mL; #H4272, Sigma-Aldrich), and DNase I (20 μg/mL; 11284932001; Roche) at 37°C for 40 min on a shaker (300 rpm, The Eppendorf Thermomixer 5350). After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 mL red blood cell lysis buffer (00-4333-57; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and incubated for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were then further digested with 5 mL 0.25% trypsin EDTA (Gibco) at 37°C for 30 min on a shaker (100 rpm, Thermo Scientific MaxQ 6000 incubated/refrigerated stackable shakers) after washing with 0.04% BSA in PBS 3 times. Trypsin was inactivated using 2 mL 10% FBS in PBS after digestion. Cells were then washed with 10% FBS twice and 0.04% BSA twice followed by resuspension in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 0.04% BSA. After filtration through a 40 μm strainer, cell number and viability were analyzed using the Nexcelom Cellometer Auto2000 with the acridine orange (AO) and propidium iodide (PI) fluorescent staining method. Ten thousand cells for each group were loaded into the Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) on a Chromium Next GEM Chip G (10X Genomics) and processed to generate single-cell gel beads in the emulsion (GEM) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The cDNA and library were generated using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kits v3.1 (10X Genomics) and Single Index Kit T Set A (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s manual. Quality control (QC) for constructed library was performed using a Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies) and a Qubit DNA HS assay kit for qualitative and quantitative analysis, respectively. The multiplexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer with 2 × 50 paired-end reads using the following read length: 28 bp Read1 for cell barcode and UMI (unique molecular identifier), 8 bp I7 index for sample index, and 91 bp Read2 for transcript. scRNA-Seq. Cell Ranger (v1.0.0) was used for demultiplexing and counting. The R (R Core Team, 2023) ( 44 45 46 13 47 50 P Pathway enrichment analysis. Pathway enrichment analysis were performed using Enrichr ( 51 P z KPMP dataset analysis. KPMP dataset analysis was based upon data generated by the Kidney Precision Medicine Project ( https://www.kpmp.org Metabolomics in serum and renal cortex from SGLT2 WT or MT mice. The metabolomic analysis was conducted by Metabolon Inc. Samples were prepared using the automated MicroLab STAR system from Hamilton Company. Several recovery standards were added prior to the first step in the extraction process for QC purposes. To remove protein, small molecules bound to protein or trapped in the precipitated protein matrix were dissociated, and to recover chemically diverse metabolites, proteins were precipitated with methanol under vigorous shaking for 2 min (Glen Mills GenoGrinder 2000) followed by centrifugation. The resulting extract was divided into 5 fractions: 2 for analysis by reversed phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with positive ion mode electrospray ionization (ESI), 1 for analysis by RP/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI, 1 for analysis by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography/UPLC-MS/MS with negative ion mode ESI, and 1 sample was reserved for backup. Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap evaporator (Zymark) to remove the organic solvent. The sample extracts were stored overnight under nitrogen before preparation for analysis. Several types of controls were analyzed in concert with the experimental samples: a pooled matrix sample generated by taking a small volume of each experimental sample (or a pool of well-characterized human plasma) served as a technical replicate throughout the dataset; extracted water samples served as process blanks; and a cocktail of QC standards that were carefully chosen not to interfere with the measurement of endogenous compounds were spiked into every analyzed sample, allowing instrument performance monitoring and aiding chromatographic alignment. Instrument variability was determined by calculating the median relative standard deviation (RSD) for the standards that were added to each sample prior to injection into the mass spectrometers. Overall process variability was determined by calculating the median RSD for all endogenous metabolites (i.e., non-instrument standards) present in 100% of the pooled matrix samples. Experimental samples were randomized across the platform run with QC samples spaced evenly among the injections. The informatics system consisted of 4 major components, the Laboratory Information Management System, the data extraction and peak identification software, data processing tools for QC and compound identification, and a collection of information interpretation and visualization tools for use by data analysts. The hardware and software foundations for these informatics components were the LAN backbone and a database server running Oracle 10.2.0.1 Enterprise Edition. Raw data were extracted, peak identified, and QC processed using Metabolon’s hardware and software. Compounds were identified by comparison with library entries of purified standards or recurrent unknown entities. The authenticated standards contained the retention time/index (RI), mass-to-charge ratio ( m z P 52 Glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance test. Glucose tolerance tests were performed in mice fasted for 16 h. Blood glucose and insulin were measured at the indicated times following i.p. glucose injection of 2 g/kg BW. Insulin tolerance tests were performed after a 2 h fast, followed by i.p. injection of 0.75 U insulin/kg BW (Humulin R; Eli Lilly). Plasma was collected by centrifugation at 850 g 53 uACR measurement. uACRs were determined by ELISA (Albuwell M kit, 1011; Ethos Bioscience) and the microtiter-format colorimetric Jaffe reaction assay using alkaline picrate ( 54 Serum creatinine measurement. Mouse serum was collected by centrifugation at 850 g 55 RT-qPCR. RNA was isolated from various organs using the standard Trizol (15596018; Life Technologies) extraction protocol. cDNA was reverse transcribed using the iSCRIPT synthesis kit (1708891; Bio-Rad). The cDNA was used as the template for RT-qPCR, which was performed with Fast SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on a QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) ( 54 Supplemental Table 4 Immunoblotting. Cells and mouse kidney tissues were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer supplemented with Halt protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (78442; Thermo Fisher Scientific) on ice for 30 min. Protein concentration in the lysates was measured with a bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Equal amounts of protein in Laemmli sample buffer composed of 1% SDS, 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% bromophenol blue were boiled for 10 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare), which was blocked with 5% BSA in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with primary antibodies. After 3 washes with TBST, the membrane was incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The antigen was detected with a SuperSignal West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate (34580; Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Information on antibodies is provided in Supplemental Table 5 Immunofluorescence. Frozen kidney sections (5 μm) were dried at room temperature for 1 h, and the frozen section was fixed with precooled acetone (–20°C) for 10 min. After blocking with 10% normal horse serum for 60 min, the tissue was incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibody (fibronectin; 1/200). Alexa-labeled secondary antibody (1/300) was used for signal detection. For immunofluorescent imaging, confocal microscopy was performed using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope from the Center of Advanced Microscopy at Northwestern University. Different sample images of the same antigen were acquired under constant acquisition settings. For image analysis, Fiji software was used ( 56 Supplemental Table 5 Histological analysis. Tunnel staining was performed by the Northwestern University Mouse Histology and Phenotyping Laboratory. Sirius Red staining was performed to evaluate the degree of fibrosis. For immunohistochemical detection of NF-kB p65, kidney tissue was fixed with 10% buffered formalin phosphate (Fisher Scientific), and sections cut at a thickness of 5 μm were incubated with the appropriate primary antibody ( 57 58 59 56 Supplemental Table 5 Bulk RNA-Seq analysis. Total RNA was extracted from kidney cortex using an RNeasy mini kit (74104; Qiagen), followed by genomic DNA digestion with DNase (79254; Qiagen). Poly(A) mRNA isolation and library preparation were performed using the Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (E7490; New England Biolabs) and the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (E7760; New England Biolabs). The libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). Raw sequencing data underwent QC assessment using FastQC. Adapters and low-quality bases (Phred score < 33) were removed. Cleaned reads were aligned to mouse genome mm10 using STAR (v2.5.2) ( 60 61 P CUT&RUN library preparation and peak calling. CUT&RUN assay libraries for mouse kidney cortex were generated using the CUT&RUN Assay Kit (86652; Cell Signaling) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nuclei were isolated from frozen mouse kidney using nuclei isolation buffer (NUC-101; Sigma-Aldrich). Obtained nuclei were then mixed and incubated with concanavalin A–conjugated paramagnetic beads. Antibodies or rabbit IgG negative control were added to each sample. The remaining steps were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by DNA purification using ChIP DNA Clean & Concentrator (D5205; Zymo Research). This purified DNA was used to prepare libraries using the KAPA Hyper prep kit (Roche). Libraries were sequenced on the NovaSeq 6000.
