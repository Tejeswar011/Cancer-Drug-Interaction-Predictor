Although only 8% of cases invade beyond the prostate, predicting PCa aggressiveness is challenging. This study investigated the potential of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein phosphorylated in Serine 249 (Phospho-Rb S249), N-cadherin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin as biomarkers for identifying aggressive PCa in Puerto Rican men. We hypothesized that the expression of these proteins could serve as biomarkers for identifying PCa tumors with potential to becoming aggressive in Puerto Rican men. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 23 biopsies from Puerto Rican men to evaluate the biomarkers’ expression, and correlation analyses examined associations with clinicopathological parameters. Results showed that Phospho-Rb S249 expression correlated positively with tumor size and positive cores in patients with Gleason scores ≥4+3. β-catenin was positively associated with tumor size and carcinoma percentage in Gleason scores ≥4+3. E-cadherin expression negatively correlated with grade group, indicating a protective role. In contrast, N-cadherin and β-catenin were more prominent in Gleason scores ≤3+4, hinting at their involvement in early epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). A decision tree analysis identified N-cadherin expression as a key determinant for classifying PCa aggressiveness, with an 82% likelihood. These findings suggest N-cadherin as a biomarker for identifying PCa with the potential to become aggressive. While our study provides promising results, further validation in a larger patient cohort is needed to increase the robustness and reliability of our findings. Also, combining multiple biomarkers could further enhance the specificity of aggressive PCa detection.

Introduction Prostate cancer (PCa) accounted for 29% of all cancer diagnoses in 2023, and since 2010, there has been an increase in cases diagnosed at higher grades and advanced stages [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Minorities, such as Black and Hispanic men, are underrepresented in PCa clinical trials, making it challenging to manage their disease [ 12 13 p 14 15 Cadherin and catenins are crucial for epithelial cell adhesion, and their disruption can promote tumor progression [ 16 17 18 19 20 20 21 22 23 We studied the Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, a critical regulator of the cell cycle, for its potential in the early detection of aggressive PCa in Puerto Rican men. Loss of Rb’s tumor suppressive function can induce cell cycle deregulation and lead to a malignant phenotype in various cancers [ 24 25 26 27 In a previous PCa study conducted in our laboratory, these biomarkers were assessed in an Asian cohort. The findings indicated that in Asian patients, there is a negative correlation between the expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin with aggressive tumor behavior, whereas Phospho-Rb S249 and N-cadherin were positively correlated with increased tumor aggressiveness [ 28 28 2. Methodology 2.1 Puerto Rican PCa biopsy samples Puerto Rican PCa biopsy samples were obtained from “CorePlus Servicios Clínicos y Patológicos” in Carolina, Puerto Rico. In this study, all patient biopsy samples were retrospectively collected; we did not perform any patient recruitment. Thus, we received an Institutional Review Board (IRB) exemption with protocol number 2207109755. The samples provided by “CorePlus Servicios Clínicos y Patológicos” were already prepared as formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded on a positively charged glass slide. Each slide contained a single patient biopsy sample, with each tumor section measuring 5μm in thickness. Also, “CorePlus Servicios Clínicos y Patológicos” provided the demographic and pathological information for each patient. The information included the patient’s age, PSA levels (ng/ml), tumor size (millimeters), grade group, Gleason score, percentage of the biopsy with carcinoma, and the number of positive cores for each patient. The control group consisted of prostate biopsy samples selected based on the absence of carcinoma, classified as negative following standard pathological evaluation. In total, 23 PCa adenocarcinoma cases and nine prostate control cases were analyzed in the study. 2.2 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to assess the expression of Phospho-Rb S249, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin in the PCa biopsy samples, following a previously established protocol [ 29 2.3 Statistical Analysis Graph Pad Prism software version 9 was used to describe the sample population using measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean, standard deviation, median, 25 th th Table 1 30 p 3. Results 3.1 Biomarker expression and Gleason score stratification in Puerto Rican PCa patients To investigate the potential of Phospho-Rb S249, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin as biomarkers for identifying aggressive PCa in Puerto Rican patients, we stratified the patients based on their Gleason score (N=23), a key factor in determining the prognosis of prostatic malignancies [ 31 32 33 Figure 1 p p p Table 2 p p p Table 3 p p p 3.2 Correlation analysis between biomarker expression and clinicopathological parameters We conducted a correlation analysis to explore the relationships between the expression of Phospho-Rb S249, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin, and various clinical parameters, including age, PSA, grade group, tumor size, percentage of carcinoma, and the number of positive biopsy cores ( Tables 4 5 p 34 p p p p p 3.3 Classification tree analysis for aggressive PCa identification To evaluate whether the expression of the biomarkers Phospho-Rb S249, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin could identify patients at risk of developing an aggressive PCa, a classification tree was constructed ( Figure 2 4. Discussion This study aimed to evaluate the potential of Phospho-Rb S249, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin as biomarkers for identifying PCa with high risk of becoming aggressive in Puerto Rican men. For this, we explored the relationship between the expression of Phospho-Rb S249, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin with the clinicopathological parameters of the Puerto Rican PCa patients. When evaluating the clinicopathological parameters, we observed an overall trend of increasing tumor aggressiveness in patients with higher Gleason scores. Furthermore, the evaluation of the biomarker’s expression levels showed that N-cadherin and β-catenin were highly expressed in Gleason scores ≤3+4. These results potentially reflect the early onset of EMT, contributing to disease progression. N-cadherin expression has been noted in multiple human cancers, such as those of the breast, lung, and liver, among others [ 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 The expression pattern of N-cadherin observed in this Puerto Rican cohort suggests that lower Gleason score tumors might exhibit elevated N-cadherin levels, possibly indicating a role in early tumor characteristics rather than advanced disease progression. Additionally, the high levels of β-catenin in patients with Gleason scores ≤3+4 emphasize its role in maintaining cell-cell adhesion during the initial stages of the disease. The interaction between β-catenin and E-cadherin at the membrane may prevent β-catenin from translocating to the nucleus and participating in the transcriptional activation of factors such as LEF-1/TCF [ 44 45 18 Moreover, we observed correlations between increased β-catenin expression with the percentage of carcinoma in biopsies and tumor size in patients with Gleason scores ≥4+3. It is well established that E-cadherin inhibits the nuclear localization and transactivation of β-catenin [ 46 47 48 49 50 51 We also assessed the potential of Phospho-Rb S249 as a biomarker for identifying PCa with potential to become aggressive. The Rb protein contains 14 mono-phosphorylated sites, each potentially influencing Rb interactions and conferring functional specificity [ 52 53 53 54 55 27 56 Comparing our findings with those of our previous study on Asian PCa patients, both studies demonstrated that Phospho-Rb S249, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin were significantly associated with tumor aggressiveness [ 28 64 Thus, given the unique genetic and environmental factors affecting the Puerto Rican population, these biomarkers may enhance personalized treatment strategies aimed to control tumor growth, preventing metastasis, and managing symptoms more effectively. Specifically, N-cadherin expression was identified as a critical determinant of PCa aggressiveness, exhibiting a moderate discriminatory power. This emphasizes N-cadherin’s potential as a classifier for aggressive disease, particularly in Puerto Rican PCa patients. While these findings are encouraging, a prospective study with a larger sample size from Puerto Rican patients is necessary to validate their clinical utility in PCa risk assessment. Additionally, future research should focus on evaluating N-cadherin expression levels alongside other potential biomarkers and comparing these findings across different populations. While clinicopathological data can provide some insight into a patient’s risk assessment, it lacks precision in predicting individual patient outcomes, making this study significant [ 57 57 58 59 60 61 61 62 63 62 A limitation of the present study is the use of retrospective biopsy samples, which could be influenced by sample preservation methods, potentially affecting protein stability and IHC staining results. Additionally, obtaining biopsies from the same patient at different time points during disease progression is a significant challenge and may not accurately reflect dynamic changes in biomarker expression over time. Therefore, incorporating a prospective study would minimize the limitations of analyzing heterogeneous samples and facilitate the inclusion of additional patient data, such as MRI results, thus contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of aggressive PCa. Such an approach will enhance the early detection and development of management strategies specifically tailored to the Puerto Rican population. In addition, working with a limited sample size (N=23) was a limitation of our study. While we acknowledge that the small sample size limits the statistical power and complexity of multivariate or machine learning analyses, our goal was to conduct a preliminary study to identify potential biomarkers in a Puerto Rican cohort. These findings serve as a foundation for future prospective studies involving larger cohorts. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights into the biological behavior of PCa in Puerto Rican men and demonstrates the feasibility of biomarker-based analysis in this population. Thus, we emphasize the need for future studies with a larger Puerto Rican cohort to confirm the observed associations and improve model robustness. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, Phospho-Rb S249, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and E-cadherin are clinically relevant as IHC-based biomarkers for assessing PCa aggressiveness in Puerto Rican men. Specifically, N-cadherin was shown to be a key classifier of tumor aggressiveness, while β-catenin and E-cadherin were associated with tumor size and grade group. Additionally, Phospho-Rb S249 expression was positively correlated with tumor size and the number of positive biopsy cores. Together, the combined expression of these biomarkers may provide a more specific stratification of PCa cases, potentially informing prognosis and therapeutic decision making. As an accessible and cost-effective alternative to genomic testing, IHC biomarkers could support the early identification of high-risk patients and guide personalized treatment strategies, particularly in resource-limited settings. Importantly, this study emphasizes the need for population-specific approaches for PCa management. Puerto Rican men may exhibit unique disease characteristics, and understanding these disparities is crucial for improving healthcare equity and prognostic accuracy across diverse populations. Future large-scale prospective studies are essential to validate these findings and to establish the clinical utility of these biomarkers in routine diagnostic workflows for PCa management.

The upper section of the figure corresponds to a patient with a Gleason score of 3+3, representing the staining patterns that predominate within the Gleason scores ≤3+4, a less aggressive form of PCa. In the lower section of the figure, the staining corresponds to a patient with Gleason score of 4+5, representing the pattern that predominates in patients with Gleason scores ≥4+3, a more aggressive form of PCa. Pictures were captured at 40X visual fields. Bars represent mean expression levels, and error bars indicate ± standard deviation (SD). Figure 2. Classification tree for predicting PCa aggressiveness based on N-cadherin expression levels. Table 1.
