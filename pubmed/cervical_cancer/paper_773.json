Nonetheless, significant gaps persist in integrating these NCD management interventions into primary care. For hypertension, although treatment coverage in the Americas (60%) is the highest as compared with other world regions ( 3 4 4 4 5 Calls have been made to prioritize and scale up the implementation of the most impactful and feasible NCD interventions in primary health care. As such, several initiatives to strengthen primary health care for NCDs are being implemented throughout the Americas. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is providing technical cooperation to Member States on the Better Care for NCDs initiative, building on experiences with the Regional implementation of WHO’s HEARTS package, providing more than 5 million people in the Americas with hypertension treatment, with a 60% hypertension control rate. One important area that requires more attention is expanding access to affordable, quality- assured NCD medicines and other NCD medical technologies. The PAHO Regional Revolving Funds offer HPV vaccines, antihypertensive medications, including fixed dose combinations, and blood pressure measurement devices, insulin and metformin, as well as blood glucose measurement devices, HPV tests and thermal ablation devices. With PAHO’s assistance, these are all offered at one unique price, regardless of purchase volume, to strengthen a country’s supply chain management, forecasting and procurement. Yet this resource continues to be underutilized in the Region. Therefore, all governments are urged to consider accessing PAHO Regional Revolving Funds to increase access to essential NCD medicines and diagnostics. Partnerships are key to PAHO’s work to reduce the gaps in NCD management. Notable partnerships include the following: Resolve to Save Lives has been a key PAHO partner in NCDs since its inception in 2017, investing in salt-reduction, trans-fat elimination and HEARTS programs. This has involved sharing technical and financial resources, providing technical assistance on training primary care providers in hypertension treatment and control, updating clinical protocols, and developing information systems for monitoring. The World Diabetes Foundation and the International Diabetes Federation have been instrumental in our Region and in supporting PAHO’s work with Member States to improve primary care providers’ capacity and expand access to quality services for people with diabetes. Gavi, the Sabin Vaccine Institute, Unitaid, the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation, the MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the University of Miami are major PAHO partners for our Regional cervical cancer elimination strategy. Through these partnerships we have convened national health authorities to develop national elimination plans, collaborate on introducing HPV testing, expand coverage of HPV vaccination, and train providers in the essentials of cervical cancer elimination.
