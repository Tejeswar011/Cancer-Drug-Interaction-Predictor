Graphical abstract Highlights • 150 metastatic cervical cancer patients took a quantitative treatment preference survey of two discrete choice experiments. • Participants valued 12-month overall survival rate and disease control rate as the most important attributes. • Participants were willing to accommodate certain logistical and financial requirements to gain treatment benefits. • Participants remained sensitive to out-of-pocket costs and number of visits. • These findings can be used to inform shared decision-making and treatment discussions between patients and their care team. Objective This study assessed treatment preferences of patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer, a disease with poor prognosis. Methods A survey with two discrete choice experiments was completed by 150 patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer in the US. Discrete choice experiment 1 included treatment attributes, and discrete choice experiment 2 included risk mitigation plan attributes. Results Participants valued 12-month overall survival rate as the most important attribute, followed by disease control rate; both efficacy attributes were rated as more important than the risk of side effects such as peripheral neuropathy and corneal side effects. Participants’ willingness to accept a treatment profile requiring a risk mitigation plan was influenced by the number of clinic visits and out-of-pocket costs. Conclusions Patients with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer prioritize overall survival and disease control rate as the most important attributes. These findings can be used to inform shared decision-making and treatment discussions among patients, clinicians, and the care team.

Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy improved overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy alone in patients treated for r/mCC in the first line (1L) ( Tewari et al., 2014 Chung et al., 2019 Colombo et al., 2021 Coleman et al., 2021 Vergote et al., 2024 FDA, 2024 Kim et al., 2022 Richardson, 2023 The multiple r/mCC treatments now available to patients differ in their efficacy and potential safety risk profiles. Thus, patients may need to make trade-offs when selecting a treatment. However, limited literature is available on patient preferences for the treatment of cervical cancer. Understanding the trade-offs patients are willing to make between treatment efficacy and risks, as well as the non-clinical burden of treatment (i.e., additional costs, need for travel), may increase our understanding of novel therapies in addressing treatment burden and inform healthcare providers in shared decision-making ( Brennan and Strombom, 1998 Grad et al., 2017 Here we describe the results of a patient preference study evaluating the relative importance of therapeutic and risk mitigation plan attributes of r/mCC treatments to patients, as well as their willingness to receive a treatment with a risk mitigation plan that requires an increased use of healthcare resources. 2 Methods 2.1 Overall study design and participants This was a quantitative preference study involving patients with r/mCC in the US. The study was conducted as an online survey with two discrete choice experiments (DCEs). The DCEs included therapeutic and risk mitigation plan attributes, selected based on a targeted literature review ( Supplementary Fig. S1 Participants were recruited through a third-party healthcare recruitment company via healthcare professional referrals. Adults (≥18 years) with a self-reported diagnosis of r/mCC (stage IVB or ineligible for surgery or chemoradiation) were eligible to participate in the study. Participants had to be living in the US or to have received/be receiving treatment for r/mCC in the US and be able to speak, read, write, and understand English or Spanish. All study materials were available in English and Spanish. Participants were remunerated for their time upon the completion of interviews or online survey. Cognitive pilot telephone interviews (60 min) were conducted in English or Spanish with 10 patients between March and May 2023 to assess the feasibility, relevance, and robustness of the study design, as well as to confirm the final selection of treatment attributes. Patients reviewed the DCE survey and provided feedback on length, wording, format, structure, and response options. The survey was iteratively refined based on this feedback. Cognitive pilot testing confirmed that participants could make trade-offs between treatment attributes. Out-of-pocket cost levels were revised using Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services estimates (USD 75 per visit), and a cap of USD 500 per 3-week cycle was introduced in DCE 2. Findings from the cognitive pilot interviews were used to inform the DCE design and survey language. A quantitative pilot study was conducted with 30 patients with r/mCC between July and August 2023 to collect initial preference data and test the DCE design. The main DCE survey (30 min) was conducted in English and Spanish with 150 patients with r/mCC between July and September 2023 ( Supplementary Appendix Cognitive pilot interview participants were not eligible for the quantitative pilot and main DCE survey. The study was conducted in accordance with best practice guidelines on preference-based methods from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research ( Hauber et al., 2016 2.2 Attribute and level development Attributes were included in the DCEs if they were reported as being important to the patients, covered safety aspects relevant to patients, were related to a care plan associated with a new r/mCC treatment, or could differentiate between available r/mCC therapies. The first DCE (DCE 1) involved choosing between two hypothetical treatment options to quantify the relative importance placed on key efficacy and safety attributes during r/mCC treatment selection ( Table 2 Supplementary Fig. S2 Table 1 Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of participants.

Attribute Description Levels DCE 1: Clinical Attributes and Levels Overall survival rate at 12 months Percentage of patients alive at 12 months after receiving treatment needed to manage the disease 25 % Chance of treatment shrinking or preventing tumor growth Percentage of patients who experience control or stabilization of disease (i.e., the chance that the tumor does not grow/shrinks/disappears entirely) 30 % DCR (20 % chance tumor not growing + 10 % tumor shrinking or disappearing)  DCE 1: Risk Attributes and Levels Peripheral neuropathy Side effects such as tingling, numbness, pain, or swelling in the hands or feet, or muscle weakness in the arms or legs Tingling, numbness, pain, swelling, or weakness is barely noticeable Corneal side effects Side effects such as pain and redness in the eyes, excessive tears, blurred or decreased vision, or sensitivity to light No discomfort in eyes or change in vision Conjunctival side effects Side effects such as pink or red eyes, swollen eyelids, itchiness or a burning sensation in the eyes, and/or an urge to rub the eyes No discomfort in the eyes or change in vision  DCE 2 Care Plan (non-clinical) Attributes and Levels Number of doctor visits The treatment involves a care plan to reduce or manage side effects. The patient will be required to visit a doctor between one and four times every three weeks for eye exams, treatment infusion, and treatment of side effects if needed. 1 visit to the doctor every 3 weeks Accessibility of eye drops Patient will be required to use three different kinds of eye drops. Two of the eye drops will be administered at the time of infusion and two of the eye drops at home, while receiving their cancer treatment. There are three ways the patient can obtain the eye drops. Patient will pick the eye drops at the pharmacy for use at home and will be administered the eye drops at every infusion at the infusion center. Out-of-pocket costs The out-of-pocket costs may vary. For every 3-week period, the patient may be required to pay a certain amount of money for each visit to the doctor. USD 20 per visit × number of visits DCE: discrete choice experiment; USD: US dollar; DCR: disease control rate. The second DCE (DCE 2) assessed participants’ willingness to accept a risk mitigation plan associated with a newly approved treatment with ocular side effects ( Table 2 Supplementary Fig. S3 2.3 DCE instrument design and survey flow The levels of DCE attributes were varied according to a D-efficient experimental design generated using Ngene software (ChoiceMetrics, Sydney, Australia) ( ChoiceMetrics, 2023 Carlsson et al., 2012 Heidenreich et al., 2021 Participants began the online survey after providing electronic informed consent. In Section 1 of the survey, participants were presented with background information on r/mCC and its treatments, as well as attributes included in the two DCEs. In Section 2, participants completed randomly allocated block of 13 experimental choice tasks (7 choice tasks from DCE 1 and 6 choice tasks from DCE 2. Examples of experimental choice tasks from DCE 1 and DCE 2 are shown in Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3 In Section 3, participants answered three questions on health literacy and five questions on numeracy ( Chew et al., 2004 Lipkus et al., 2001 Supplementary Appendix 2.4 Validity assessments Validity analyses were conducted to test participant comprehension, alertness, and stability of choices. In DCE 1, a repeated choice task at the end of the survey tested the stability of participants’ responses. Stability was defined as selecting the same option in both instances. A dominance test assessed rationality by presenting a choice where one treatment was superior on all attributes; participants passed if they selected the superior option. Non-participation was defined as consistently choosing the same option across all DCE tasks, while dominant decision-making was evaluated to assess whether choices were driven by a single attribute. The time taken by each participant to complete the DCE survey was recorded. To avoid selection bias, participants who failed the internal validity tests were not excluded ( Supplementary Appendix 2.5 Statistical analysis The sample size in the main DCE was consistent with the sample size for healthcare DCEs reported in the literature ( Hauber et al., 2016 Soekhai et al., 2019 Bridges et al., 2011 Data from the two DCEs were separately analyzed with correlated mixed logit models specified within the random utility maximization framework ( Manski et al., 1959 Thurstone, 1927 McFadden, 1973 Efron and Tibshirani, 1986 Supplementary Appendix Hole, 2007 Participants’ willingness to accept an r/mCC treatment was assessed as predicted uptake probabilities, which were calculated using the elicited preferences for the overall sample in DCE 2 ( Supplementary Appendix Supplementary Appendix 2.6 Ethics The study protocol was approved by Salus Institutional Review Board (Salus study number: 22259-01C), and the study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided electronic informed consent after reading an online informed consent form containing information on the study objectives, participant confidentiality, and whom to contact in case of questions. Participants were informed that they could withdraw at any time without penalty or giving up any benefits to which they were otherwise entitled. 3 Results 3.1 Participants A total of 150 participants with r/mCC were included in the DCE survey (mean age, 50.1 years; Table 1 3.2 Validity assessments The validity assessments suggested that participants were able to make trade-offs between DCE attributes. Participants demonstrated adequate health literacy and numeracy ( Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Table S2 3.3 Treatment and risk mitigation care plan preferences 3.3.1 Utility estimates In DCE 1, clinical efficacy attributes had a larger impact on participants’ preferences than risk attributes. An increase in OS rate at 12 months from 25 % to 60 % was the most important change in an attribute to participants (maximum likelihood estimate [MLE] = 4.8; P < 0.05), followed by an increase in DCR from 30 % to 70 % (MLE = 3.2; P < 0.01) ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 DCE 1: Participant preferences for r/mCC treatment attributes and levels (N = 150) All numeric attributes were modelled as linear terms. The figure shows the preference estimates for changes in the attributes, as specified in the DCE. Effects were derived by multiplying each attribute level with its corresponding linear coefficient. The black error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals. Utility estimates (y-axis) capture the impact of an improved attribute level (e.g., an increase in overall survival rate from 25 % to 40 %) on participants’ preferences. Higher estimates indicate a higher desirability, but the absolute value of a utility are not directly interpretable. With each DCE attribute, reference level is indicated by “*” was manually set as a utility estimate of zero. Positive change compared to reference indicates higher preference, and negative change indicates a lower preference, hold all else equal. The disease control rate is defined as the proportion of patients with a confirmed complete response, partial response, or stable disease. The model had a good fit (adjusted McFadden R 2 In DCE 2, participants were first asked about their willingness to accept a treatment with a given benefit-risk profile. With the same benefit-risk profile, patients then answered questions about their preferred choice with varying degree of access convenience. Participants preferred having one visit to the doctor over two visits per 3-week treatment cycle (MLE = 13.3; P < 0.001). Additionally, increasing the number of doctor visits from 2 to 4 visits per cycle (MLE = −7.3; P < 0.001) and out-of-pocket costs from USD 20 to USD 200 per 3-week treatment cycle (MLE = −28.2; P < 0.001) both led to a decrease in acceptability of a treatment, all else being equal ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 DCE 2: Participant preferences for risk mitigation care plan attributes and levels (N = 150) The figure shows the estimated effect of each attribute over the range used in the DCE. Black bars show the 95 % confidence interval for each utility value. The model had a good fit (adjusted McFadden R 2 3.3.2 Relative attribute importance Compared to treatment attributes related to efficacy, those related to risks of side effects were less important to participants during treatment selection ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Relative attribute importance scores in DCE 1 Relative attribute importance scores represent the relative impact of improving each attribute from the worst level to the best level (e.g., improving overall survival rate at 12 months from 25 % to 60 %). A higher relative attribute importance score indicates a greater relative importance of improving the attribute. CI: confidence interval; DCE: discrete choice experiment. 3.3.3 Minimum acceptable benefit of overall survival rate at 12 months Trade-offs between efficacy and risk attributes were calculated based on participant responses to measure the minimum improvement in treatment efficacy participants would require for them to accept the potential risks associated with treatment. Results showed that participants required a 7.9 % increase in OS rate to tolerate severe peripheral neuropathy (P < 0.05), a 7.2 % increase to tolerate severe corneal side effects (P < 0.05), and a 3.5 % increase to tolerate mild to moderate conjunctival side effects (P < 0.05) ( Fig. 4 Supplementary Fig. S4 Supplementary Fig. S4 Fig. 4 Minimum acceptable benefit of overall survival rate at 12 months (DCE 1) Minimum improvements in OS rate at 12 months that participants would require to tolerate an increased risk of side effects. Values were based on the attributes and levels presented in DCE 1. Higher MAB values indicate that participants would require higher treatment efficacy to tolerate an increase in the severity of side effects. For example, to tolerate an increase in risk of severe peripheral neuropathy, participants would require a treatment which offered a 7.9 % increase in OS rate at 12 months. *** P-value < 0.1 %; ** P-value < 1 %; * P-value < 5 %. CI: confidence interval; DCE: discrete choice experiment; OS: overall survival; SD: standard deviation. 3.3.4 Predicted patient uptake of an r/mCC treatment profile with a risk mitigation care plan Most participants (83.0 %) were willing to accept a treatment with a given benefit-risk profile defined by a 12-month OS rate of 51 %; 24 % of patients experiencing tumor shrinkage/disappearance and an additional 48 % having no tumor growth (DCR of 72 %); and mild or moderate peripheral neuropathy, corneal, and conjunctival side effects. Furthermore, with the above-described benefit-risk profile, most participants (73.0 %) were willing to accept some degree of burden associated with a risk mitigation plan, which included two visits to the doctor per 3-week treatment cycle and an out-of-pocket cost of USD 150 per cycle (an average per-visit cost of USD 75). However, for the same out-of-pocket cost, the predicted uptake decreased to < 50 % when three visits to the doctor per 3-week treatment cycle were required ( Supplementary Fig. S5 3.3.5 Subgroup differences We conducted subgroup preference heterogeneity analyses based on a range of participant observed characteristics, including age, insurance type, and prior experience with peripheral neuropathy or ocular side effects ( Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7 Supplementary Fig. S7 4 Discussion This study informs how patients with r/mCC trade-off between treatment efficacy, risks, and burden of treatment (i.e. a risk mitigation plan) when making treatment decisions. Additionally, data from this study was used to model how certain non-clinical factors such as financial or logistical burden, as perceived by patients, may influence treatment preferences. Consistent with published studies on patient preferences for gynecological cancer treatments ( Collacott et al., 2021 Havrilesky et al., 2020 Havrilesky et al., 2019 Lee et al., 2016 Havrilesky et al., 2014 Minion et al., 2016 An important aspect of this study is the inclusion of a diverse patient sample that reflects the epidemiology and sociodemographic characteristics of patients with r/mCC in the US ( NCI, 2025 As suggested by the predicted uptake analysis, patients with r/mCC face trade-offs between treatment benefit and the burden of treatment, which is not unexpected. Patients with cervical cancer often require more support with various aspects such as money, housing, food, transportation, and utilities. These needs arise as they navigate the effects of cancer-related treatments, which can often result in work limitations and reduced earnings (unpublished data on file. Family Reach Cervical Advocacy Collaborative). For patients on active treatment, cost of therapy is a significant contributor to the overall financial burden and is often a major factor in a patient’s choice of therapy in their long-term planning for survivorship. Many patient assistance programs exist today to address the cost of therapy challenges. Furthermore, patients also face overwhelming expenses and logistical demands associated with treatment outside of cost of therapy, such as costs for imaging and other follow-up or monitoring visits. As such, these may lead to patients delaying seeking medical attention for milder symptoms, thereby increasing the likelihood of experiencing deterioration of their health status. Previously, Zheng et al have observed a link between financial hardships and increased emergency room visits and lower use of preventative services among cancer survivors ( Zheng et al., 2020 Zheng et al., 2020 It is noteworthy that participants with previous experience of side effects associated with treatment or with better overall health were more concerned about corneal side effects. Furthermore, participants with a history of peripheral neuropathy reported heightened concerns regarding the risk of experiencing side effects with a new treatment. This may reflect the trade-offs patients make between avoiding risk of severe side effects and finding ways to manage the impact of severe side effects on their daily activities (e.g., using walkers or wheelchairs to manage challenges in mobility due to peripheral neuropathy). The authors interpret this as indicative of the importance for patients to maintain active and productive lives throughout their treatment journey and survivorship. We propose that physicians and care team members should more consistently consider the patient’s lifestyle and social commitments when discussing treatment options during shared decision-making. Participants reporting self-provided insurance were more sensitive to both increased number of doctor visits and higher out-of-pocket costs compared to participants with employer-provided/veteran affairs insurance or Medicare/Medicaid insurance suggest that a more equitable coverage for care may help mitigate disparities in access to newer treatments that require a risk mitigation plan. These results provide evidence of differences in preferences among the sample, which indicates that personal preferences should be considered in shared decision-making because prescribing a treatment that is more consistent with a patient’s preferences is more likely to lead to increased treatment satisfaction and potentially increased adherence. This study has certain limitations. First, attribute confounding is a general risk within DCEs and is usually present if the chosen attributes overlap and/or the influence of preferences for one attribute depends upon levels of other attributes. However, this DCE was designed to minimize attribute confounding by selecting distinct treatment aspects as attributes. Second, preference methods such as DCEs may be subject to hypothetical bias, if the choices made by respondents in the DCE differ from those they would make in real life. Third, the preferences of participants may be systematically different from those who were contacted but declined to participate. Lastly, due to the small sample sizes in some subgroups, some analyses, such as the analysis of differences in participant preferences based on health insurance coverage, may have been limited in their generalizability. 5 Conclusions Our study findings may be used to guide the selection of r/mCC treatments, emphasize counseling with consideration for the patient’s native language, and improve shared decision-making between patients and clinicians. This research also highlights the importance of engaging patients with r/mCC as essential partners in discussions of their treatment plan and empowering them with information on benefit-risk and burden of treatment to facilitate informed and confident decision-making. These results underscore the importance for clinicians to identify patients’ perspectives and their tolerance of treatment-related risks that may necessitate a care plan. Increased patient education in all facets of treatment options may potentially enhances compliance with life-prolonging treatments. Logistical and financial implications are significant considerations for patients and should be incorporated into discussions with patients. CRediT authorship contribution statement Premal H.
