Introduction Temozolomide (TMZ) and Paclitaxel (PXT), crucial anti-cancer drugs for glioblastoma (GBM) and primary breast cancer (BC), respectively, face drug resistance. Therefore, we investigated the adjuvant potential of characterized extracts of the lichens Evernia prunastri Cladonia arbuscula Methods TMZ-resistant U-87 cells, MCF7 BC-cells, and normal human skin fibroblasts (HSKF) were treated with hexane (Hex), dichloromethane (DCM), and acetonitrile (ACN) extracts of Epr (EprDCM, EprACN), Car (CarHex, CarACN), and with EA and UA to measure cell metabolic activity. Molecular mechanisms were predicted using ChemGPS-NP and validated by Western blot, RNA sequencing, quantitative RT-PCR, and Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) protein expression. Combinatory effects were calculated by Combination Index (CI) and Zero Interaction Potency methods (ZIP). Results Extracts and selected metabolites reduced concentration-dependent cellular metabolic activity in U-87 and MCF7 cells. EprACN and EA (U-87 cells: IC 50 Discussion The combination EA-TMZ interacts with the Wnt pathway regulation associated with sensitizing U-87 cells, without increasing GEs of pro-inflammatory cytokines. EA deserves further investigation as an adjuvant.

Authors constructed an immune-related prognostic model to predict patient sensitivity to checkpoint inhibitor blockade therapy ( Ma et al., 2022 Ma et al., 2022 BC is also extremely variable in morphology and at the molecular level, necessitating combinatorial therapy modalities depending on the molecular subtype, which is defined by hormone receptor (HR) status and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) expression ( Li et al., 2017 Kashyap et al., 2022 Li et al., 2017 Rosińska et al., 2024 Baranova et al., 2022 The current standard of care in breast cancer varies by subtype and stage. Early-stage breast cancer typically involves surgical resection, adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy for hormone receptor-positive tumors, and targeted therapy for HER2-positive tumors ( Bravo et al., 2023 Grant et al., 2024 The Wnt pathway is implicated in both BC and GBM, significantly contributing to treatment resistance ( Zhong and Virshup, 2020 Kashyap et al., 2022 Zhong and Virshup, 2020 Zhong and Virshup, 2020 Ulrich-Merzenich et al., 2017 TMZ and paclitaxel (PTX), key chemotherapeutics for GBM and BC, respectively, are under investigation for combination therapies ( Tan et al., 2020 Tan et al., 2020 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ Gueble et al., 2022 Neff et al., 2022 Minea et al., 2024 Fekete et al., 2023 Tan et al., 2020 Taxanes, like PTX, used in BC treatment, were derived from the Pacific yew’s bark ( Wani et al., 1971 Manthey et al., 1992 Das et al., 2021 Bukowsk et al., 2020 Lee, 2016 Abu et al., 2019 Abu et al., 2019 Abu et al., 2019 Khongkow et al., 2016 Abu et al., 2019 This diversity of resistance mechanisms promotes a search for natural compounds as adjuvants ( Persano et al., 2022 Sestito et al., 2018 Lichens have been utilized in traditional medicine for ages ( Crawford and Ranković, 2015 Schwendener, 2011 Evernia prunastri Cladonia arbuscula E. prunastri Fernández-Moriano et al., 2017 Lee et al., 2021 Gökalsın and Sesal, 2016 Shcherbakova et al., 2019 C. arbuscula Einarsdottir et al., 2010 Bačkorová et al., 2011 Galanty et al., 2017 Kiliç et al., 2019 Brisdelli et al., 2013 We investigated extracts from E. prunastri C. arbuscula Both cell lines were selected as representative in vitro Xie et al., 2015 Neve et al., 2006 U-87 and MCF7 remain widely accepted platforms for early-stage anticancer research. In this study, they were used to evaluate not only the ability of the lichen extracts and their metabolites to influence cancer cell metabolic activity, but also their potential to synergize with standard chemotherapeutics (TMZ or PTX). Extracts and combinations showing efficacy were further assessed for possible mechanisms of action. This included chemographic prediction tools, cytokine response profiling, and evaluation of their potential to modulate cellular pathways involved in drug sensitivity, forming a foundation for future translational investigations. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals, media, and assays Usnic acid (UA) (purity 98%), paclitaxel, resazurin tox kit, insulin (Sigma Aldrich, Germany); evernic acid (EA) (purity 98%), temozolomide (Cayman Chemical, United States); (phospho-AKT rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2000), ß-actin rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2000), phospho-p44/42 (Thr202/Tyr204) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2000), p44/42 mouse clonal antibody (1:2000), goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, United States); phospho-c-Jun (Ser73) rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:2000) (Cell Signaling Technology, United States); Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1,640 Medium, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, fetal bovine serum (FBS), non-essential amino acids (MEM NEAA), sodium pyruvate, penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco™, United States); Human WIF-1 DuoSet ELISA (R&D Systems, United States), RNeasy MiniPlus kit (QIAGEN, Netherlands). 2.2 Lichens material Samples of E. prunastri C. arbuscula Institute of Forestry and Nature Management E. prunastri C. arbuscula 2.3 Extraction and characterisation Extracts were obtained and characterized as described earlier ( Shcherbakova et al., 2021 2.4 Chemographic prediction of the mode of action ChemGPS-NP ( http://chemgps.bmc.uu.se Buonfiglio et al., 2015 2.5 Cell culture and cytotoxicity assay 2.5.1 Cell lines and culture Human primary glioblastoma (U-87), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), and human skin fibroblast (HSKF) cell lines were purchased via Cell Line Services (CLS) from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ) and Promocell and grown as described earlier ( Ammar and Ulrich-Merzenich, 2017 2.5.2 Metabolic activity assay as measure for cell viability Cells (5 × 10 3 Ulrich-Merzenich et al., 2017 Ulrich-Merzenich et al., 2017 Einarsdottir et al., 2010 Kiliç et al., 2019 Brisdelli et al., 2013 Emsen et al., 2018 Bézivin et al., 2004 2.6 Western blot analysis Western blot analysis was performed to investigate the expression and phosphorylation levels of Akt, Erk1/2, and c-Jun in U-87 cells treated with EprACN or EA as described ( Ulrich-Merzenich et al., 2007 Supplementary Material S1 Supplementary Material Table S1 2.7 Synergy screening Cells (as described under Section 2.5.2 Chou, 2010 Section 3.1 Supplementary Material S2 Supplementary Material S3 2.7.1 Synergy calculation Synergism was calculated using the CompuSyn software ( https://compusyn.software.informer.com/ Chou, 2010 Ianevski et al., 2017 2.8 RNA deep sequencing of primary glioblastoma cells (U-87) 2.8.1 Cell culture U-87 cells (106 cells/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and stimulated for 24 h with the following treatments: 1) EA (9.97 μg/mL = 30 µM); 2) EA (14.95 μg/mL = 45 µM); 3) TMZ (116.49 μg/mL = 600 µM); 4) EA (6.65 μg/mL = 20 µM) + TMZ (73.78 μg/mL = 380 µM); 5) EA (6.65 μg/mL = 20 µM) + TMZ (112.61 μg/mL = 580 µM); 6) EA (11.63 μg/mL = 35 µM) + TMZ (62.13 μg/mL = 320 µM); 7) untreated controls. 2.8.2 RNA isolation and sequencing RNA was extracted as described ( Ulrich-Merzenich et al., 2017 GSE245919 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE245919 2.8.3 Data evaluation Data evaluation was performed according to the guidelines provided on the Galaxy Training website ( https://training.galaxyproject.org/ Warde-Farley et al., 2010 https://genemania.org/ 2.9 Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) The same RNA samples analyzed by RNASeq were used for quantitative reverse transcription (qRT-PCR) as described earlier ( Abdel-Aziz et al., 2015 Supplementary Material S3 S4 2.10 Protein Wnt-inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1) release Cells were treated as described under 2.5.2. Treatment was either with EA (6.65, 13.29, and 19.94 μg/mL = 20, 40, and 60 µM) or TMZ (58.25, 87.37, and 116.49 μg/mL = 300, 450, and 600 µM) alone or in combinations. The WIF1 release was determined by Human WIF-1 DuoSet ELISA (R&D Systems). 2.11 Statistical analysis All values are expressed as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments.

Experiments were performed with 3 replicates. The IC 50 Lee, 2016 EA and UA did not significantly affect the metabolic activity of HSKF at concentrations up to 66.46 μg/mL and 68.86 μg/mL (equivalent to 200 µM), respectively. In U-87 cells, EA demonstrated greater activity and more favorable response comparing to UA. The results indicated that while the compounds were effective against cancer cell lines, they exhibited reduced activity toward HSKF cells, suggesting a degree of selectivity toward malignant cells. The lichen extracts did not reduce the metabolic activity of MCF7 with the SI value below 1, indicating a lack of selectivity. Both EA and UA showed activity against MCF7 cells, but their SI was comparatively lower than that of PTX, leading to the discontinuation of further experiments with MCF7 cells. In the next step, combinations were investigated. 3.2 Combinatorial effects of lichen metabolites with TMZ or PTX  Figure 1a Figure 1b Figure 1c FIGURE 1 Synergy assessments (a) (b) (c) Group of scientific charts and graphs analyzing drug interactions and cell viability.

Panel b contains combination index (CI) plots demonstrating drug synergy, with CI values and dose reduction index (DRI) for different combinations. Panel c features 3D plots highlighting the delta score impact of several drugs in combination. Each section is labeled with drug acronyms such as EprACN, EA, and UA, indicating the tested compounds. The combination of EprACN with TMZ exhibited antagonism (CI = 3.07) and with PTX additive effects (CI = 1.04) ( Figure 1b Figure 1a Although the EA-TMZ combination demonstrated antagonism, EA increased the sensitivity of U-87 cells to TMZ by 3.4 times (DRI = 3.4). Synergistic effects were observed at Fa < 0.5 ( Figure 1b Figure 1c Figure 1a Effects of the EA-PTX and UA-PTX combinations were similar, with enhanced effectiveness leading to up to 60% in metabolic activity reduction ( Figure 1a Figure 1b Figure 1c Since synergistic effects are influenced not only by drug concentrations but also by their ratio ( Ammar and Ulrich-Merzenich, 2017 Figure 2 FIGURE 2 U-87 cell viability and synergy calculations for the combinations of TMZ with EA at a ratio of 1:16.

Experiments were performed in triplicate. 3.3 Mechanistic insights into EA’s mode of action In a first step, we used ChemGPs for a chemographic prediction of EA’s mode of action. The Euclidean distance calculation over all eight dimensions of the ChemGPS-NP chemical property space suggests that EA’s most probable mode of action is either topoisomerase I inhibition or disturbance of tubulin activity ( Figure 3a Thomas and Pommier, 2019/06 Figure 3c Tubulin-active compounds bind to the tubulin microtubules, affecting their dynamics ( Janke and Magiera, 2020 TUBB6 TUBB2B Figure 3c Janke and Magiera, 2020 Figure 3b Supplementary Material S5 Supplementary Material S6 Western blot analyses revealed that EA, along with EprACN, also modulates key signaling pathways.

Therefore, we measured the Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1). WIF1 binds to Wnt-proteins, thereby inhibiting the activation of the Wnt-signaling (see also Supplementary Material S7  Figure 5e The Wnt pathway is a regulatory system interacting directly or indirectly with other signaling pathways, including the NF-kB pathway, as a central pathway in inflammation ( Guo et al., 2024 Guo et al., 2024 Guo et al., 2024 Lee et al., 2021 Figure 6 GABRs BDNF, IL6, IL10, TNFA Figure 6a Figure 6b FIGURE 6 Expression of genes encoding brain-related proteins and cytokines.

GABARAPL1: GABAA receptor-associated protein-like 1. The pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFA IL10, IL6 IL6 RNAseq analysis showed no significant differences in the expression of GABA GABRB1 GABARAPL1 RNAseq analysis further revealed insignificant influences of all treatments on BDNF BDNF  IL10 IL6 4 Discussion The effectiveness of standard chemotherapeutics such as temozolomide (TMZ) in glioblastoma (GBM) and paclitaxel (PTX) in breast cancer (BC) is often limited by developing resistance and eventual treatment failure ( Das et al., 2021 Lee, 2016 E. prunastri C. arbuscula Xie et al., 2015 Allen et al., 2016 in vivo Neve et al., 2006 Holliday and Speirs, 2011 in vivo The initial experiments revealed a reduction in cellular metabolic activity in U-87 and MCF7 cells after treated with the lichen extracts and their metabolites. However, they were less effective against MCF7 cells compared to PTX. Therefore, experiments with MCF7 cells were discontinued, even though UA had exhibited activity against MCF7 cells in earlier studies ( Bačkorová et al., 2011 Hawrył et al., 2020 For extracts of E. prunastri, 50 Bézivin et al., 2004 Studzińska-Sroka et al., 2021 The extracts of C. arbuscula 50 Lee, 2016 To substantiate the antiproliferative effects, we performed Western blot (WB) analyses of members of the central MAPK families. They play a central role by regulating the cell cycle engine and other proliferation-related proteins ( Bézivin et al., 2004 Studzińska-Sroka et al., 2021 Zhang and Liu, 2002 Singh et al., 2023 WB analyses revealed that EprACN and EA reduced the expression and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 over time, explaining the observed decrease in the metabolic activity in U-87 cells and revealing an antiproliferative activity, as in most cells, sustained ERK activation is required to induce cell cycle entry. In Glioma, an aberrant activity of the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway appears to play a crucial role in the development of gliomas ( Stachyra and Grzybowska-Szatkowska, 2025 Yakubov et al., 2025 Another member of the MAPK-pathway, the so-called proto-oncogene c-Jun, is also central to cancer-altered signalling: an upregulated c-Jun was described for variable tumor cells, specifically in brain tumors, contributing to its malignancy ( Blau et al., 2012 Blau et al., 2012 EprACN and EA downregulated pAkt in a time- and dose-dependent manner corresponding to the reduction in metabolic activity in U-87 cells. This is particularly relevant, given that overexpression and high phosphorylation of Akt correlate with a poor prognosis in glioblastoma patients ( Shahcheraghi et al., 2020 Manoranjan et al., 2020 Zhong and Virshup, 2020 WNT3 In our combinatory study, GE-profiling of U-87 cells revealed the modulation of multiple components within the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Combination EA35TMZ320 reduced the transcription of WNT5A, an upstream intracellular member ( Yu et al., 2007 Chen et al., 2021 Zuccarini et al., 2018 Chen et al., 2021 Lee, 2016 Yu et al., 2007 Chen et al., 2021 Alkailani et al., 2022 Chen et al., 2021 Frizzleds (FZDs) are transmembrane receptors ( Alkailani et al., 2022 Shahcheraghi et al., 2020 Zuccarini et al., 2018 FZD7 CTNNBIP1 Tong et al., 2015 To support the transcriptional findings, we measured the release of Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF1) protein via ELISA. WIF1 binds to Wnt-proteins, thereby inhibiting Wnt pathway signalling. Both single metabolites and combinations increased the release of WIF1 protein. In contrast, the combination of high concentrations of EA (40 µM) and TMZ (≥380 µM) reduced WIF1 releases, supporting the dose-dependent effects observed in the GE analyses, where higher concentrations induced an upregulation of WNT3 Cross-talks between signaling pathways are known to play a role in resistance development f. e. Wnt/ß-catenin signaling activates NF-kB in the cytoplasm, whereas Dvl inhibits NF-kB signaling in the nucleus ( Guo et al., 2024 Zhao et al., 2021 Guo et al., 2024 Jang et al., 2021 IL6 Guo et al., 2024 Bazan et al., 2021 West et al., 2018 Widodo et al., 2021 IL6 IL10 IL6 IL10 Ulrich-Merzenich et al., 2017 Ahmad et al., 2018 We did not observe changes in the GE of IL4 IL8 in vivo Brat et al., 2005 Losur et al., 2024 Furthermore, the IL-17B/ IL-17RB pathway has been implicated in tumorigenesis and resistance to anticancer therapies ( Briukhovetska et al., 2021 Briukhovetska et al., 2021 IL17RC Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), an endogenous signaling molecule, is involved in the carcinogenesis of glioma ( Zheng and Chen, 2020 Chen et al., 2016 Xiong et al., 2013 BDNF GABAA forms a heterotetrameric complex ( Huang et al., 2022 Smits et al., 2012 Le Grand et al., 2011 Boyer-Guittaut et al., 2014 GABARAPL1 5 Summary and conclusion This study demonstrates the potential of lichen-derived metabolites, particularly evernic acid (EA), to modulate key pathways associated with TMZ resistance in U-87 cells, suggesting a promising multitarget mechanism for future investigation. EA reduced the metabolic activity of TMZ-resistant U-87 cells, synergizing with TMZ to reduce viability by 75% at optimized ratios. The prediction of ChemGPS that EA acts on tubulin activity was supported by deep sequencing. Mechanistically, EA suppressed GE of oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling while upregulating the protein expression of WIF1 as a central inhibitor of Wnt-signaling. Combinatorial EA-TMZ treatment further modulated MAPK/PI3K pathways, inhibiting ERK1/2, c-Jun, and Akt phosphorylation, which are critical for glioblastoma survival and resistance. The discovery of IL17RC overexpression in resistant cells underscores a novel pathway implicated in TMZ resistance, warranting further exploration.
