In situ regeneration of tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHV) is a promising strategy to overcome the limitations of existing heart valve prostheses. Although, decellularized aortic valves (DAVs) are widely regarded as a scaffold in the construction of TEHV, the poor hemocompatibility and adverse immune responses make DAV scaffolds prone to thrombosis and degradation, thus hindering recellularization and in situ regeneration. Our study developed an immune-regulatory strategy involving the use of hydrogel-encapsulated nanoparticles to modify DAV scaffolds. Specifically, folic acid- and hyaluronic acid-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (FA-HA-MSNs@CY-09) were engineered to deliver NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inhibitor CY-09, thereby targeting macrophages, modulating their polarization and establishing a pro-regenerative immune microenvironment. The reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive hydrogel delivering FA-HA-MSNs@CY-09 enabled intelligent nanoparticle release and ROS scavenging. Results demonstrated that the hydrogel-modified DAV scaffold exhibited ROS-responsive release of FA-HA-MSNs@CY-09, which effectively induced macrophage polarization toward the pro-remodeling M2 phenotype. In vitro, the scaffold showed favorable mechanical properties, cytocompatibility, and hemocompatibility. Transcriptome sequencing elucidated the macrophage-reprogramming mechanism of the scaffold. In vivo, the scaffolds promoted significant M2 macrophage infiltration shortly after implantation, facilitating endothelial tissue formation. This resulted in enhanced endothelialization and interstitial cell infiltration under blood flow, without thrombosis or calcification. The novel heart valve overcomes various limitations of conventional heart valve prostheses and demonstrates considerable promise for clinical translation, particularly as an immunomodulatory biomaterial strategy.

Primarily composed of extracellular matrix (ECM), DAVs demonstrate excellent biocompatibility and reduced susceptibility to calcification compared to conventional alternatives [ 5 6 7 8 9 Following the implantation of valve materials, macrophages, which govern immune responses and tissue remodeling, emerge as central to the ensuing immune reaction [ 10 11 12 1 13 14 15 The polarization control is activated by the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, a key innate immune sensor that drives macrophages toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and perpetuates the inflammatory response [ 16 17 18 19 20 The large surface area and well-defined pore architecture of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) enable high drug-loading capacity and tunable release kinetics, making MSNs a promising nanocarrier platform [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 In this study, we developed an intelligent nanoreservoir system—comprising a ROS-responsive hydrogel and folic acid/hyaluronic acid dual-modified MSNs loaded with CY-09—functionalized onto a DAV scaffold. This system enables spatiotemporally controlled nanoparticle release, active targeting of macrophages, and modulation of the immune microenvironment, thereby promoting in situ regeneration of TEHV. Moreover, we evaluated the mechanical properties, blood compatibility, and cellular compatibility of TEHV in vitro; we also explored the mechanism by which CY-09 regulates macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype using transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, we assessed its tissue compatibility and in situ regenerative capacity using subcutaneous small animal embedding models and abdominal aorta implantation models. Our modification strategy is expected to alleviate early inflammatory damage, provide an adaptive immune microenvironment to early endothelialization of the scaffold, and ultimately promote the constructive remodeling of TEHV ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Schematic of the fabrication process, structure, and functional mechanism of ROS-responsive hydrogel-coated DAVs encapsulating FA-HA-MSNs@CY-09 (DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs). Fig. 1 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA), and all cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco (USA) unless otherwise stated. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) (MW = 25,000 kDa) was purchased from MeilunBio Co., Ltd. (China). Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), N, N, N′, N′-tetramethyl-1,3-propanediamine and 4-(bromomethyl)phenylboronic acid were purchased from Aladdin Co., Ltd. (China). N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS), 1-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), folic acid (FA), hyaluronic acid (HA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd. (USA). Reactive oxygen species assay kit (ROS Assay Kit), Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and Calcein-AM/propidium iodide (PI) cell viability/cytotoxicity assay kit were purchased from Beyotime Co., Ltd. (China). CY-09 was purchased from MedChemExpress Co., Ltd. (China). Primary antibodies and fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from Abcam (UK). 2.2 Preparation of the FA-HA-MSN MSNs were synthesized according to a previously reported procedure [ 28 29 MSNs (30 mg) were dispersed in 4 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mM, pH 7.4) and mixed with 100 μL of PEI solution (75 mg/mL). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min. The PEI-modified MSNs (MSN-PEI) were isolated by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 15 min) and washed three times with ultrapure water. HA (15 mg), NHS (40 mg), and EDC (30 mg) were dissolved in 10 mL of distilled water and stirred at room temperature for 1 h to activate the carboxyl groups of HA. Subsequently, the MSN-PEI and FA (10 mg) were added to the activated HA solution. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h to yield the dually modified nanoparticles (HA-FA-MSN). 2.3 Preparation of FA-HA-MSNs@CY-09 HA-FA-MSNs (10 mg) were dispersed in 5 mL of CY-09 solution (0.4 mg/mL in PBS). The mixture was magnetically stirred (150 rpm) at 4 °C for 24 h. Following loading, the nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation. The drug-loading capacity was determined by quantifying the unloaded CY-09 in the supernatant using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu) at 210 nm. The drug-loading efficiency (LE) was calculated using the following formula: LE ( % ) = Weight of total drug − Weight of free drug Weight of nanoparticles × 100 % 2.4 CY-09 release properties of FA-HA-MSNs@CY-09 and MSNs@CY-09 FA-HA-MSN@CY-09 (2 mg) were dispersed in 2 mL PBS (pH 7.4). The dispersion was incubated at 37 °C under constant shaking at 100 rpm. Samples were collected by centrifugation at designated time intervals within 72 h. The supernatant was analyzed for released CY-09 concentration, and the release medium was replenished with an equal volume of fresh, pre-warmed PBS (37 °C). CY-09 concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 210 nm using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu). The percentage of drug release was calculated using the following formula: Culmulative release ( % ) = Mt M 0 × 100 % Mt was the amount of drug released at time t and M0 was the total amount of drug in the loaded in the nanoparticles. 2.5 Study of in vitro cellular uptake THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages by treatment with 100 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Differentiated macrophages were then treated with MSN-FITC@CY-09 or FA-HA-MSN-FITC@CY-09 at an equivalent nanoparticle concentration (1.0 μg/mL) for 3 h. Cells were washed three times with 1X PBS to remove unbound nanoparticles The cells were then fixed and examined using confocal laser scanning microscopy to assess the uptake of both particles, thereby evaluating the enhanced uptake capacity of macrophages for FA-HA-MSN@CY-09. 2.6 Preparation of DAV DAVs were prepared as previously described [ 30 2 2.7 Preparation of DAVs/ROS-gel and DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs The ROS-responsive hydrogel employed in this study was synthesized using N1-(4-boronophenyl)-N3-(4-boronophenyl)-N1, N1, N3, N3-tetramethylpropane-1,3-diamine (TPA) as the primary raw material, following a previously established protocol [ 31 32 A 10 mL PVA solution (25 mg/mL in PBS) was prepared. FA-HA-MSN@CY-09 was added to the PVA solution to achieve a final concentration of 1 mg/mL. Subsequently, DAVs were introduced into the mixture. The suspension was then incubated on a horizontal shaker (80 rpm) at 4 °C for 24 h to allow reaction. Following incubation, the reacted DAVs were washed twice with PBS. The washed DAVs were then immersed in a TPA solution (25 mg/mL in PBS), leading to rapid hydrogel formation on the valve surfaces. This resulted in DAVs loaded with the FA-HA-MSN@CY-09 ROS-responsive hydrogel, designated as DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs. The preparation of ROS-responsive hydrogel-modified DAVs (DAVs/ROS-Gel) followed a similar procedure to that of DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs. The key difference was the omission of FA-HA-MSN@CY-09 from the initial PVA solution during the incubation step with the DAVs. 2.8 Mechanical test Tensile testing was performed using a universal testing machine equipped with a 50 N load cell, at a constant crosshead speed of 18 mm/min. Test specimens were cut into strips with a gauge length of 10 mm and a width of 4 mm. To prevent slippage during gripping, sandpaper was affixed to both ends of each specimen. Specimens were then clamped and subjected to uniaxial tensile loading until failure occurred within the gauge section. The ultimate tensile strength was recorded, and the Young's modulus was calculated from the slope of the linear elastic region (0–5 % strain) of the resulting stress-strain curves. 2.9 Cytotoxicity test The cytotoxicity of DAVs was evaluated using a co-incubation method. The DAV samples were cut into 0.5 cm 2 2.10 Collagenase and elastase degradation test In vitro enzymatic degradation of the samples was assessed using collagenase and elastase, following a previously described protocol with minor modifications [ 33 Weight Loss ( % ) = W 0 − Wt W 0 × 100 % 2.11 In vitro hemocompatibility of the DAVs The whole blood was collected from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and immediately anticoagulated with sodium citrate. Platelet adhesion assay: Citrated whole blood was allowed to rest at room temperature for 10 min. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was then isolated by centrifugation at 590× g 8 Thrombogenesis assay: DAV samples were incubated with 0.5 mL of citrated whole blood that had been recalcified by adding a coagulation trigger solution (70 μL per 1 mL blood) containing CaCl 2 2 Samples of DAV, DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs, DAVs/ROS-Gel, and GAV were cut into 9 mm × 6 mm rectangles and affixed to the inner surface of a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) catheter. Japanese white rabbits were anesthetized by intravenous injection of 1 % (w/v) sodium pentobarbital solution. Following surgical isolation of the left common carotid artery and right external jugular vein, an ex vivo shunt circuit was established using cannulaes and catheters to position the sample-containing segment directly within the blood flow path. The samples were exposed to circulating blood for 90 min. Subsequently, the shunts were disconnected, and the samples were gently rinsed three times with PBS. Macroscopic images were captured to document thrombus formation on the sample surfaces. Finally, the samples were fixed in 2.5 % (w/v) glutaraldehyde solution for subsequent visualization by SEM. Hemolysis Assay: Citrated whole blood was diluted 10-fold with normal saline (0.9 % NaCl). RBCs were then isolated by centrifugation at 1520× g g Hemolysis rate ( % ) = ODsample − ODnegative ODpositive − ODnegative × 100 % 2.12 Proteomics Samples from the anterior tributary circuit system were extracted and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples (approximately 100 mg) were pulverized into a fine powder under liquid nitrogen and homogenized in 1 mL of phenol extraction buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at a final concentration of 1 mM. The homogenate was further processed using a cryogenic grinding instrument for two cycles under the following conditions: 35 °C, 60 Hz, 120 s per cycle. The mixture was then centrifuged at 25,000× g 2.13 In vivo assessment by rat subdermal implantation model The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (IACUC Number 4677). Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (body weight: 180–200 g) were supplied by Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd. To assess the in vivo histocompatibility of heart valve scaffolds, a rat subdermal implantation model was established as previously described [ 34 2 2.14 In vivo assessment by abdominal aorta transplantation The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (IACUC Number 4677). All valvular samples were trimmed to 5 mm × 5 mm squares and fashioned into tubular conduits under microscopic guidance. Male SD rats (approximately 200 g body weight) were randomly assigned to three experimental groups. Anesthesia was induced via intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg body weight). Following aseptic preparation, a midline laparotomy incision was made. The muscle layer was bluntly dissected to access the abdominal cavity. The abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava were meticulously isolated under surgical microscope magnification. Vascular clamps were applied proximally and distally to isolate a segment of the abdominal aorta. The prepared valvular conduit was then anastomosed end-to-side to the isolated abdominal aorta segment using interrupted 8-0 polypropylene sutures (Ethicon Inc., USA). Following anastomosis completion and confirmation of hemostasis, the vascular clamps were released to restore blood flow. The abdominal muscle layer was closed with continuous 4-0 polypropylene sutures (Ethicon Inc., USA), and the skin incision was sutured. At postoperative days 7, 14, and 28, rats were euthanized, and the implanted valvular specimens, along with surrounding aortic tissue, were explanted and immersion-fixed in 4 % (w/v) paraformaldehyde solution for subsequent analysis. 2.15 Quantitative analysis of calcium All tubular scaffolds were obtained following a 28-day abdominal aorta transplantation. The scaffolds were then freeze-dried, weighed, and subsequently dissolved in a 6 M nitric acid solution at 75 °C for 24 h. The calcium content of the different scaffolds was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). 2.16 RNA-sequencing and data analysis THP-1 cells were induced and seeded on DAVs and DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs, and then cultured in 1640 medium containing 100 ng/mL LPS for 3 days. Subsequently, the two groups of samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA from the tissue was extracted using the mirVana™ miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion-1561), and the RNA concentration was determined using the NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo). The library construction and sequencing procedures were conducted by Oebiotech (Shanghai). 2.17 Statistical analysis The experimental results are presented as mean ± standard deviation, with analyses conducted using GraphPad Prism 10.1. Comparisons between two groups with normally distributed data were performed using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test, while multiple comparisons were assessed using one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistically significant differences were defined as a p-value <0.05 (not significant (ns), p p p p 3 Result 3.1 Synthesis and characterization of FA-HA-MSNs@CY-09 The fabrication process of FA-HA-MSNs@CY-09 is illustrated in Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Preparation and Characterization of FA-HA-MSN@CY-09. Fig. 2 The actual sizes and Zeta potential for MSN-PEI, HA-MSN, and FA-HA-MSN were determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS). The results revealed that the average particle size of MSN-PEI was 261.3 nm, while the average sizes of HA-MSN and FA-HA-MSN were 271.0 and 282.0 nm, respectively. This finding is closely related to the modification of nanoparticles by hyaluronic and folic acids. (Fig. 2B) The Zeta potential measurement for MSN-PEI was +11.9 mV, confirming the successful amination modification of MSN with PEI. Moreover, the average Zeta potentials for HA-MSN and FA-HA-MSN were −15.6 and −18.1 mV, respectively, further demonstrating the successful modification of the nanoparticles. (Fig. 2C)) We also employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to assess the overall morphology of the nanoparticles. The final FA-HA-MSN exhibited a near-spherical morphology, similar to that of the bare MSN. The surfaces of HA-MSN and FA-HA-MSN, following HA and FA coating, displayed a distinct coating-like structure, with the surface of FA-HA-MSN exhibiting this feature more prominently ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 To ensure the successful modification of MSNs with HA and FA, the FTIR spectrum was collected at each stage. As shown in Fig. 2 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 To ensure a high drug loading rate of nanoparticles, this study used the solvent impregnation method for loading CY-09 ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 To evaluate the selective targeting and internalization of inflammatory macrophages, we labeled MSN and FA-HA-MSN with FITC, co-cultured them with LPS-activated THP-1 cells for 2 h, and observed cellular uptake using confocal laser scanning microscopy ( Fig. 2I, Fig. S1-2 ROSs are a critical factor in inducing the pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages [ 35 36 Fig. 2 Fig. S3 3.2 Fabrication of a hydrogel coating responsive to ROS loaded with FA-HA-MSN@CY-09 on DAV To achieve the slow release of FA-HA-MSN@CY-09 targeting macrophages, a ROS-responsive hydrogel was developed through mixed crosslinking of PVA and TPA, with FA-HA-MSN@CY-09 embedded within the network. ( Fig. 3 Fig. S4 Fig. 3 Fig. S5 Fig. 3 Construction of DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs scaffold. Fig. 3 The energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) analysis revealed the elemental composition of the surface of various porcine heart valve materials. The significant distribution of the Si element indicated successful loading of nanoparticles, accounting for 4.26 % (w/w) in DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs ( Fig. 3 Fig. S6 Fig. 3 Fig. S7 3.3 Characterization of 3.3.1 Surface roughness As demonstrated in the two- and three-dimensional representative images, hydrogel modification can influence the surface roughness of the scaffold ( Fig. 3 Decellularization of natural valves or crosslinking with glutaraldehyde can create a smooth surface on the scaffold; however, modifying the surface of DAV with hydrogels results in a rougher surface. Among these, DAVs/ROS-Gel exhibited the highest roughness, measuring 274.33 ± 70.61 nm, whereas DAV showed the lowest roughness at only 88.43 ± 6.08 nm. 3.3.2 Mechanical properties The mechanical strength of artificial heart valve materials is a crucial factor in determining their potential for clinical translation. As shown in the strain‒stress curve, the slope of the curve represents the Young's modulus for different groups ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. S8 3.3.3 Enzymatic degradation After treatment with collagenase solution on different scaffolds, there was a significant difference in weight loss between DAVs and DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs, of 80.70 ± 2.31 % and 13.57 ± 2.30 %, respectively. However, there was no significant difference before and after loading the nanoparticles. In the elastase degradation experiment, there was no statistically significant difference in the weight loss rates among the different scaffolds, with the weight loss rates of GAVs and DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs being 4.12 ± 1.61 % and 4.5 ± 1.64 %, respectively ( Fig. S9 3.3.4 Water contact angle The water contact angles (WCA) of different scaffolds are shown in Fig. S10 3.3.5 Thermodynamic stability Fig. S11 3.4 In vitro cytocompatibility of DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs 3.4.1 Cytotoxicity After in vivo implantation, artificial valves directly interact with diverse cell types in the circulating blood flow, such as endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and endothelial cells (ECs). The cytotoxicity of the scaffold directly affects the application prospects. In this study, HUVECs were seeded on different scaffolds to evaluate cytotoxicity. The results of the cell proliferation experiments show that an incomplete endothelial cell layer could be observed on DAVs and DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs after 3 days ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. S12 Fig. 4 In vitro cytocompatibility and macrophage reprogramming of the DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs scaffold. Fig. 4 3.4.2 Subtype changes of macrophages on DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs This study used THP-1 cells to investigate the immune microenvironment and macrophage polarization. Immunofluorescence staining of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; M1 phenotype marker) and CD206 (M2 phenotype marker) demonstrated that, compared to DAV, differentiation into the M2 phenotype significantly increased following hydrogel modification ( Fig. 4 Fig. S13A-C Fig. S13D Fig. S14 To elucidate the potential mechanisms through which DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs influence the polarization and subtypes of macrophages, we performed transcriptome analysis on samples from implanted macrophage scaffolds. Volcano plots and clustering heat maps revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs and DAVs ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. S15A Fig. 4 Fig. S15B Fig. 4 3.5 Hemocompatibility of DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs 3.5.1 Thrombosis To thoroughly evaluate the antithrombotic properties of DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs, this study was conducted under both dynamic blood flow and static conditions. Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 In vitro hemocompatibility of the DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs scaffold. Fig. 5 A proteomic approach was employed to identify the proteins adhering to the samples after 2 h of circulation, revealing a total of 2929 expressed proteins. We focused on significantly different proteins between DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs and DAVs using fold change >1.5 and p-value <0.05 as the screening criteria to analyze the underlying mechanisms of ROS-Gel@MSNs in improving hemocompatibility. The volcano plot revealed that 210 proteins were significantly downregulated in DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs compared to DAVs, whereas only 70 proteins were significantly upregulated ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 In addition to dynamic blood flow, the static thrombogenesis assay also confirmed this conclusion, indicating that the ROS-Gel@MSNs modification prevented thrombosis compared to DAV. A quantitative analysis of the thrombus attached to different scaffold samples was conducted ( Fig. S16 3.5.2 Adhesion of PLTs As shown in Fig. 5H, a large number of platelets (PLTs) exhibiting a morphology of extending dendritic pseudopodia adhered to the surface of DAV scaffolds, while the content of PLTs on the surface of other scaffolds was nearly absent. Meanwhile, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay was employed to quantify the relative number of PLTs on different scaffolds. The results demonstrated a trend consistent with the SEM images. As expected, a higher optical density (OD) value at 490 nm was measured in the DAV group, whereas the other three groups exhibited significantly lower values, indicating greater PLT adhesion in the DAV group ( Fig. 5 3.5.3 Hemolysis assay In the hemolysis assay, representative images are shown in Fig. S17 3.6 In vivo assessment of DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs grafts after subcutaneous embedding The rat subcutaneous implantation model is a classic model used to study the biocompatibility of grafts in vivo. The samples obtained from the experiments were primarily used for conducting histological examinations including H&E, Masson, EVG, and Von Kossa staining. Except for the GAV group, all other scaffolds underwent decellularization treatment, and thus no nuclei were observed in them. As expected, HE staining images showed that cells gradually infiltrated the DAV and DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs grafts after embedding for 7, 14, and 28 days, however, there was no infiltration in GAV at any time point ( Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. S18–S19 Fig. 6 Rat subcutaneous embedding model. Fig. 6 We identified the types of infiltrating immune cells, by employing immunofluorescence staining to detect iNOS (M1 phenotype marker) and CD163 (M2 phenotype marker) ( Fig. 6 Fig. 6 3.7 In vivo performance of the scaffolds under a hemodynamic environment This study established a rat abdominal aorta implantation model using an end-to-end anastomosis to evaluate the performance of different types of stents in the presence of arterial blood flow ( Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Fig. S20–S21 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 In vivo evaluation through rat abdominal aorta implantation. Fig. 7 M1 and M2 macrophages were identified using immunofluorescence staining techniques ( Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Immunofluorescence staining of immune cells, endothelial cells, and remodeling of the rat abdominal aorta implantation. + Fig. 8 Samples of abdominal aortic implants were collected at 7, 14, and 28 days to investigate the conditions of endothelialization and remodeling ( Fig. 8 + Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 To evaluate potential side effects, we assessed rats 28 days after the implantation of DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSN into the abdominal aorta by collecting major organs and blood samples for analysis. As shown in Fig. S22A-E Fig. S22F 4 Discussion The in situ regeneration strategy embodied in TEHVs represents the optimal approach to overcome the limitations of existing bioprosthetic valves. In this study, we propose a novel strategy for modifying DAVs using ROS-Gel@MSNs and validate its efficacy in enhancing the performance of TEHVs. Our findings demonstrate that: 1) MSNs modified with folic and hyaluronic acids enable active targeting of macrophages; 2) Coating DAVs with TPA-PVA hydrogel significantly enhances their mechanical properties and anti-thrombotic performance; 3) CY-09, delivered by FA-HA-MSNs, effectively promotes macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype by inhibiting the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome and reducing ROS generation; and 4) Following in vivo implantation, ROS-Gel@MSNs scaffolds promote M2 macrophage polarization while simultaneously accelerating endothelialization and remodeling. The host immune response, a pivotal process in tissue microenvironment reconstruction and in situ regeneration, is inevitably elicited upon biomaterial implantation [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 [46] [47] [48] 49 50 To optimize CY-09 utilization and prolong its macrophage-targeted action, we employed nanoparticles for sustained drug delivery. MSNs offer high drug-loading capacity and controlled release kinetics owing to their large surface area and tunable pore structure [ 51 24 25 To enable intelligent drug release in response to the high ROS levels during early TEHV implantation, we developed a ROS-degradable hydrogel comprising TPA and PVA. The PVA solution was mixed with DAVs and CY-09-loaded FA-HA-MSNs, thereby achieving stable nanoparticle adhesion through hydrogen bonding and physical embedding. Subsequent crosslinking with TPA generated phenylboronate ester bonds, forming a hydrogel coating that rapidly degrades under high ROS conditions to expose encapsulated nanoparticles [ 52 In subcutaneous implantation and abdominal aortic transplantation models, DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs significantly enhanced early M2 macrophage recruitment compared to DAVs and GAVs controls, indicating accelerated anti-inflammatory remodeling. This in vivo outcome aligns with our in vitro macrophage polarization data. Collectively, our TEHV functionalization strategy operates using three synergistic mechanisms: 1) ROS-responsive drug release: Phenylboronate ester cleavage in the hydrogel enables early nanoparticle exposure in high-ROS microenvironments; 2) Active macrophage targeting: FA/HA surface modifications mediate specific nanoparticle internalization; 3) Sustained M2 polarization: Intracellular CY-09 release from MSNs reprograms macrophages toward regenerative phenotypes. This multi-level design establishes a theoretical foundation for promoting endothelialization and tissue remodeling in TEHVs. Enhancing the mechanical robustness of TEHVs is critical to withstand the demanding physiological stresses of cardiac function [ 53 54 55 56 Given the critical exposure of heart valves to the circulatory system, various surface modification strategies have been explored to enhance the hemocompatibility of valve materials [ 53 57 55 To further investigate the mechanisms for the enhanced hemocompatibility conferred by DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs, we performed comparative proteomic profiling across sample groups. This analysis revealed a significant downregulation of several pro-thrombotic proteins in the DAVs/ROS-Gel@MSNs samples compared to controls. Thrombospondin 3 (THBS3), which facilitates platelet adhesion to collagen, promoting thrombus initiation; (CAMK2D) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (ITPR2), key regulators of intracellular calcium signaling and release, thereby influencing platelet activation and aggregation; Tyrosine-protein kinase(s), implicated in mediating platelet surface receptor signaling (e.g., GP IIb/IIIa), further enhancing platelet adhesion and aggregation [ [58] [59] [60] [61] 62 63 64 2 2 65 Endothelialization and ECM remodeling are critical hallmarks of successful in situ regeneration. Our findings demonstrate that the hydrogel modification significantly increased the surface roughness of the scaffolds, as measured by the atomic force microscope (AFM). This altered surface topography suggests enhanced potential for cell adhesion and proliferation [ 66 Overall, we achieved stable modification of ROS-Gel@MSNs onto DAVs utilizing a PVA-based strategy that facilitates hydrogen bonding and embedding interactions. This study suggests the potential of TEHV for future clinical application. However, limitations exist in the current study. Further research, including large animal studies and clinical trials, is therefore warranted to evaluate its potential for clinical translation. 5 Conclusions In conclusion, we successfully developed a novel TEHV to achieve targeted macrophage modulation by encapsulating FA-HA-MSNs@CY-09 within a ROS-responsive hydrogel. his innovative TEHV demonstrates superior mechanical properties and excellent biocompatibility, with the scaffold promoting macrophage polarization toward the M2 phenotype and scavenging ROS. Thus, the scaffold crucially fosters an adaptive immune microenvironment favorable to endothelialization and ECM remodeling post-implantation. These combined effects significantly enhance valve durability compared to traditional glutaraldehyde-crosslinked biological valves. Overall, by focusing on immune regulation and subsequent tissue regeneration processes, this modification strategy enhances the immunomodulatory potential of TEHVs and provides an effective approach for addressing the inherent limitations of conventional heart-valve prostheses.
