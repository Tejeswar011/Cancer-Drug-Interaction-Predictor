This anxiety may exacerbate psychological burdens, including depressive symptoms and fear of recurrence, significantly impacting quality of life. AIM To examine whether reproductive concerns partially mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and fear of recurrence in cervical cancer patients of childbearing age. METHODS Utilizing a cross-sectional design with convenience sampling, 208 eligible cervical cancer patients (aged 18-45 years, stable condition, and aware of diagnosis) from three tertiary hospitals completed validated questionnaires: The Reproductive Concerns After Cancer Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Fear of Cancer Recurrence Questionnaire. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the mediating role of reproductive concerns in the relationship between depression and fear of recurrence. RESULTS Reproductive concerns demonstrated significant positive correlations with depression ( r P r P β P CONCLUSION Identified path reveals fertility anxiety links depression to recurrence fear. Targeted psych interventions for repro concerns may ease both in childbearing cervical cancer survivors.

Reproductive concerns-a multidimensional construct encompassing fertility potential, pregnancy feasibility, and offspring health anxieties-are central to this distress. The Reproductive Concerns After Cancer Scale (RCAC), developed by Gorman et al 5 6 7 8 9 10 We propose that reproductive concerns may mediate the depression–fear of recurrence relationship: Depressive symptoms, characterized by negative cognitive schemas[ 11 12 9 12 2 Therefore, this study aimed to test whether reproductive concerns partially mediate the association between depressive symptoms and fear of recurrence in cervical cancer patients aged 18-45 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS General information This cross-sectional survey study utilized a convenience sampling method to recruit eligible cervical cancer patients from three tertiary-level A hospitals in China: Nanjing Women and Children's Healthcare Hospital, Nanjing Gulou Hospital, and the Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Disease Hospital of the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University. Data collection occurred between September 2022 and October 2023. Of the 210 patients recruited, two were excluded due to incomplete questionnaires, yielding 208 valid responses (99.05% effective rate) for final analysis. Inclusion criteria: (1) Aged 18-45 years; (2) Diagnosed with cervical cancer per the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cervical Cancer (2021 Edition)[ 13 via e.g. 14 Survey instruments  General information questionnaire: Reproductive concerns  Of Young Adult Female Cancer Scale (RCAC): et al 15 et al 6  Depression screening scale (PHQ-9): et al 16 et al 17  Fear of Cancer Recurrence Questionnaire: et al 18 et al 19 Data collection and quality control All questionnaire data were collected online. Investigators underwent a 1-week standardized training. After obtaining consent, patients received unified instructions. Surveys were anonymous and self-administered. If patients were unable to complete the survey independently, trained nurses assisted by reading questions aloud and recording responses. Clinical data (tumor type and stage) were abstracted from electronic medical records by two independent researchers using dual verification. Pilot testing with 10 eligible patients informed survey procedures. All scales underwent reliability validation (Cronbach's α > 0.83). Ten percent of randomly selected questionnaires underwent third-party audit with discrepancies resolved by a senior researcher. Data entry was performed with two-researcher cross-checking. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 24.0 for descriptive statistics (continuous variables expressed as mean ± SD; categorical variables as frequencies and percentages); Pearson correlation analysis examining relationships among RCAC total/subscale scores, PHQ-9, and Fear of Cancer Recurrence Questionnaire (FCRQ) scores; and AMOS 24.0 for structural equation modeling testing the mediation pathway where depression (PHQ-9) influences fear of recurrence (FCRQ) through reproductive concerns (RCAC), with model fit assessed using χ df via P RESULTS Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics The sample comprised 208 cervical cancer patients of reproductive age (mean age 36.6 ± 5.8 years). Most participants were married (90.4%), Han Chinese (95.2%), and urban residents (59.1%) (Table 1 Table 1 Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of 208 cervical cancer patients  Variable   Items  Percentage (%) Ethnicity Han 198 95.19 Others 10 4.81 Residence Urban 123 59.13 Rural 85 40.87 Marital status Single 15 7.21 Married 188 90.38 Divorced 5 2.40 No. of children 0 29 13.94 1 110 52.88 ≥ 2 69 33.17 Education level Primary/middle 75 36.06 High school 42 20.19 College and above 91 43.75 Household income per capita (RMB) ≤ 3000 34 16.35 3000-5000 67 32.21 5000-10000 69 33.17 ≥ 10000 38 18.27 Occupation Employed 136 65.38 Unemployed/retired 72 34.62 Medical payment method Medical insurance 152 73.08 New rural Cooperative Medical Scheme 48 23.08 Self-pay 8 3.85 Tumor type Squamous-cell carcinoma 146 70.19 Adenocarcinoma 35 16.83 Other types 27 12.98 Clinical stage I 65 31.25 II 76 36.54 III 50 24.04 IV 17 8.17 Fertility anxiety, depression, and fear of recurrence scores in cervical cancer patients of reproductive age The total fertility anxiety score of cervical cancer patients of reproductive age was (53.95 ± 7.71), with the highest subscale score in fertility potential (10.97 ± 2.51) and lowest in pregnancy planning (7.05 ± 2.23). The total depression score was (15.84 ± 3.91), indicating moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Total fear of recurrence score was (21.38 ± 4.53), indicating moderate to severe relapse fears (Table 2 Table 2 Fertility worries, depression, and fear of recurrence scores in 208 cervical cancer patients of childbearing age  Variable  Items  Score  mean ± SD Total reproductive concerns 18 18-90 53.95 ± 7.71 FP 3 3-15 10.97 ± 2.51 PP 3 3-15 7.05 ± 2.23 PA 3 3-15 7.87 ± 2.06 PH 3 3-15 10.11 ± 2.59 CH 3 3-15 9.79 ± 2.48 DA 3 3-15 8.16 ± 2.65 Total depression score 9 0-27 15.84 ± 3.91 Total FOR score 7 7-40 21.38 ± 4.53 FOR: Fear of recurrence; FP: Fertility potential; PP: Pregnancy planning; PA: Partner awareness; PH: Personal health; CH: Child health; DA: Disease acceptance.

Mediating effect of fertility anxiety between depression and fear of recurrence in cervical cancer patients of reproductive age With depression as the independent variable, fear of recurrence as the dependent variable, and fertility anxiety as the mediator variable, a structural variance model was constructed using AMOS 24.0 software, and parameter estimation and fitting corrections were carried out using the method of great likelihood to construct a structural equation model with fertility anxiety as the mediating effect (Figure 1 χ df β P P P β P Figure 1  Mediating effect model of reproductive concerns between depression and fear of recurrence. β P DISCUSSION Our study found that: (1) Cervical cancer patients of childbearing age exhibited moderate levels of reproductive concern (mean 53.95 ± 7.71), depression (mean 15.84 ± 3.91), and fear of recurrence (mean 21.38 ± 4.53); (2) Reproductive concern positively correlated with depression and fear of recurrence; and (3) Reproductive concern partially mediated the effect of depression on fear of recurrence (28.1% of total effect). Our mediation proportion (28.1%) exceeded the 23.5% reported in breast cancer cohorts[ 20 e.g. 2 21 22 vs vs 23 24 25 26 The results of this study showed that the total fertility anxiety score and the scores of each dimension were positively correlated with the total depression score and the total fear of recurrence score, and the total fear of recurrence score was positively correlated with the total depression score, which was consistent with the results of the studies conducted by Zhu et al 27 et al 28 29 30 This study is the first to establish a formal mediation model (28.10%) linking depression, reproductive concerns, and fear of recurrence in cervical cancer patients. This finding extends beyond prior correlational studies[ 20 31 32 et al 33 However, it is worth noting that fertility anxiety played a key mediating role in this process. The structural equation modeling in this study showed that depressed mood directly predicted fear of recurrence, and by positively predicting fertility anxiety, indirectly influenced the level of fear of recurrence. Qiao et al 34 Fertility anxiety acts as a mediating variable between cervical cancer and worsened reproductive outcomes. Here's how: Cervical cancer is a severe disease. It often causes depression and related adverse psychological emotions, including fertility anxiety. These emotions then interfere with sex hormones and disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis function. This interference directly worsens the damaging effects of cervical cancer on the reproductive organs and their function. Cervical cancer patients of reproductive age have greater expectation for fertility, and the decrease or loss of fertility that may be caused by the disease and its treatment undoubtedly increases their level of anxiety. This anxiety directly affects the patient's psychological state, and indirectly exacerbates the level of fear of cancer recurrence through a mediating effect. Therefore, alleviation of adverse emotions is crucial for improving the psychological status of cervical cancer patients of reproductive age. Wang et al 35 This study had several limitations. Its cross-sectional design precludes causal inferences about the observed relationships. Convenience sampling from three regional hospitals limits generalization, particularly for rural populations. Voluntary participation risks self-selection bias-potentially excluding severely distressed patients while over-representing motivated participants. Unmeasured psychosocial confounders ( e.g. e.g. vs CONCLUSION This study is the first to demonstrate that reproductive concerns partially mediate (28.10%) the relationship between depression and fear of recurrence in cervical cancer patients of childbearing age. In cervical cancer patients of childbearing age, reproductive concerns partially explain how depressive symptoms translate into heightened fear of recurrence. Addressing fertility anxiety may be a valuable component of psychosocial care.
