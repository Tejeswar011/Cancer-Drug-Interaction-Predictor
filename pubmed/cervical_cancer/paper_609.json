Introduction Musculoskeletal pain is the most frequently reported medical condition worldwide. The age-standardized prevalence rate of musculoskeletal pain per 100,000 people globally is 16,276.2 [ 1 2 3 4 Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and acetaminophen are the most prescribed drugs for musculoskeletal pain. However, these conventional medications are not recommended for long-term use because of their significant side effects such as weight gain, weight loss, gastrointestinal symptoms, and dizziness [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 3 11 12 13 14 In South Korea, eight constitution medicine (ECM) combines acupuncture treatment and lifestyle intervention. It is a unique constitutional medicine system in TKM. Its diagnostic approach involves dividing individuals into eight inherent constitutions based on radial artery pulse patterns identified through pulse diagnosis [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 This multi-institutional retrospective observational study aimed to evaluate the real-world clinical effectiveness of combined ECA and ECLI therapy for musculoskeletal pain. Furthermore, we sought to determine the impact of treatment on patients’ quality of life and to understand the factors contributing to diverse treatment responses and follow-up patterns. This included identifying characteristics that may influence patient outcomes and the overall effectiveness of this therapeutic approach. 2. Materials and Methods We analyzed the medical records of patients who visited the ECM clinics for back, neck, shoulder, and knee pain. We observed the effects of ECA and ECLI by evaluating symptoms before and after treatment. This was a single-group retrospective chart review study without a control group and was preliminary in nature. All authors who designed and conducted this study are licensed Korean Medicine Doctors (KMDs). Authors Y.C., H.K. and J.Y. have direct clinical experience in ECM and provided the patient data for this study. The remaining co-authors (N.C., H.J., C.Y., S.K., and J.L.) are clinical research experts and specialists in traditional medicine. The other co-authors, although without direct ECM clinical experience, contributed their expertise in research methodology and have published relevant academic papers. The Wonkwang University Bioethics Committee approved the study protocol (IRB no: WKIRB-202308-BM-061) on 9 August 2023. Because this was a retrospective study, the need for prior consent was waived by the IRB. 2.1. Participants This retrospective study used data from patients who visited the Gangnam-Shingwang, Yeson, and Yebon clinics between January 2018 and August 2023, and reported one of the following symptoms: neck, shoulder, back, or knee pain. The diagnostic codes for each pain site were as follows: for neck pain, “Pain in joint, other (M25.58)” or “Cervicalgia, cervical region (M54.22)”; for shoulder pain, “Pain in joint, shoulder region (M25.51)”; for low back pain, “Low back pain, lumbar region (M54.56)”; and for knee pain, “Pain in joint, lower leg (M25.56)”. Patients in this study were diagnosed with nonspecific musculoskeletal conditions, such as myofascial pain syndrome. Detailed differential diagnosis into specific anatomical pathologies like osteoarthritis or tendinopathy was not the primary focus of diagnosis, as the therapeutic approach in EATM focuses on the patient’s symptoms and constitutional type, rather than the specific anatomical structure involved. Patients aged between 20 and 80 years were included in this study, without restrictions on sex, comorbidities, symptom severity, or disease duration, encompassing all individuals who visited the clinics during the study period. Patients whose records did not confirm the interventions were excluded from this study. In addition, patients with suspected serious conditions (e.g., fractures, infections, or malignancies), identified through clinical assessments by the attending KMDs and referred to conventional medical institutions, were also excluded. 2.2. Intervention Eligible participants underwent standard treatment processes used in clinical practice at the Gangnam-Shingwang, Yeson, and Yebon clinics in Seoul. The treatments, ECA and ECLI, were performed by authors Y.C., H.K., and J.Y., who are licensed KMDs with about 20 years of clinical experience. KMDs are practitioners of TKM within a dual healthcare system of South Korea. All have obtained a master’s degree or higher in Clinical Epidemiology or related fields. The first step involved classifying the patients’ constitutional groups using a standardized pulse diagnosis technique [ 15 21 Once the constitution group was determined, acupuncture was administered at different acupoints depending on the symptoms [ 16 Figure 1 22 Because this study reflects real-world clinical protocols used in primary care settings, there were no strict restrictions on concurrent treatments. During this treatment period, the use of herbal medicine was generally restricted, and the use of opioid analgesics was avoided. However, the concurrent use of non-opioid analgesics was permitted. These restrictions were flexibly applied based on the patient’s condition and clinical discretion. The patients were informed about ECLI, which included diet, bathing, and exercise methods specific to each constitution [ 16 23 Supplementary File S1 2.3. Outcome Measurements and Data Collection This study evaluated the general symptom scores for pain, symptom-specific indices for each body part, and quality of life to assess the effects of ECA and ECLI. Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) were used, considering the standardization of outcome measures and feasibility in the clinical setting. These outcomes were collected using both paper and electronic surveys, and their completion was recorded in electronic medical records. These surveys are part of the standard clinical protocols of the three primary care institutions. Baseline information included sex, date of birth, educational background, marital status, job, and one of eight constitutional diagnoses determined by the physician. General information related to pain, such as alcohol consumption and smoking history, onset, cause, aggravating factors, diagnosis, medical and surgical history, current illness, and medication history, was also collected. The primary outcome was the change in symptom-specific indexes (Neck Disability Index [NDI], Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC], and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index [SPADI]) from the first visit (Visit 1) to follow-up. Secondary outcomes included changes, in general, symptom scores (PainDETECT score), somatic pain scores from the Korean Cancer Pain Assessment Tool (KCPAT), and EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) scores from visit one to follow-up. The PRO surveys were collected at the first visit and 4–8 weeks later at follow-up, and the data were stored in a database. Data meeting the selection and exclusion criteria were extracted in Excel. The NDI is a tool used to assess neck and cervical spine dysfunction and comprises 10 items scored from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more severe activity impairment [ 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 PainDETECT is a scale consisting of seven items for assessing neuropathic pain, with scores ranging from −1 to 38, where higher scores indicate more severe neuropathic pain [ 35 36 37 The Korean version of the EQ-5D-5L was used to assess the health-related quality of life. It consists of five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each domain is scored from 1 to 5, with lower scores indicating a healthier state [ 38 39 40 2.4. Statistical Analysis 2.4.1. Descriptive Statistics Summary of Study Participants Descriptive analysis was performed for the collected baseline characteristics. For continuous variables, mean ± standard deviation (SD), median, and interquartile range are presented, and for categorical variables, frequency and ratio are provided. 2.4.2. Clinical Response Evaluation Criteria and Methods Clinical responses were evaluated using paired t The responder and non-responder groups were determined based on the MCID, and the proportion of responders in each symptom group and overall was investigated. Differences in characteristics between these groups were analyzed using the chi-squared test (or Fisher’s exact test) for nominal variables and the independent t 2.4.3. Factors Influencing Treatment Effectiveness To identify factors influencing treatment effectiveness, we performed univariate linear regression analysis for continuous dependent variables (SPADI, WOMAC, NDI, ODI, and EQ-5D-5L scores) and univariate logistic regression analysis for the binary dependent variable (treatment responders and non-responders based on MCID). Covariates included sex, age, diagnostic constitution, education, marital status, job, smoking history, drinking history, supplementary diet intake, baseline PainDETECT, KCPAT somatic pain scores, and EQ-5D-5L scores. Covariates with statistical significance in univariate analysis were then included in a multivariate linear/logistic regression analysis to identify independent factors influencing treatment effectiveness. All statistical analyses were performed using R Version 4.3.2 software (R Studio, Boston, MA, USA). Statistical significance was set at p 2.4.4. Safety Evaluation Criteria The safety evaluation involved reviewing all adverse events recorded in the charts during the treatment period. Adverse event data were collected from the patient reports and clinician observations at each visit, and the incidence rates of adverse reactions, including those leading to discontinuation of treatment due to adverse reactions and serious adverse reactions, were reported. 3. Results 3.1. General Characteristics of Patients Data from 163 patients were analyzed: 26 with knee pain, 49 with LBP, 62 with neck pain, and 26 with shoulder pain ( Figure 2 Table 1 Table S1 Among the 163 patients, 44 had successful follow-up, with a significant age difference between the successful (53.91 ± 11.40 years) and unsuccessful follow-up groups (48.39 ± 14.97 years) ( p p Table S2 p Table S3 3.2. Clinical Response 3.2.1. Pre- and Post-Treatment Comparison For the 44 participants who completed the ECA and ECLI and had successful follow-ups, the Shapiro–Wilk normality test assumed a normal distribution for outcome variables such as PainDETECT, partial KCPAT, EQ-5D-5L, WOMAC, ODI, NDI, and SPADI scores. Paired t p p p p Overall PainDETECT scores and those for LBP specifically decreased from 9.32 ± 4.76 to 8.93 ± 5.06 and from 8.79 ± 3.43 to 6.89 ± 5.03, respectively; however, these changes were not statistically significant. PainDETECT scores for knee, neck, and shoulder pain increased post-treatment; however, these were not statistically significant. Neck pain partial KCPAT scores decreased from 14.30 ± 4.47 to 13.50 ± 4.70; however, this was not statistically significant; shoulder pain partial KCPAT scores increased post-treatment, but not significantly ( Table 2 Figure 3 Although PainDETECT scores decreased in all age groups except those in their 50s and those aged 70 and above, the changes were not statistically significant. In the 50s and 70+ age groups, PainDETECT scores increased, but these changes were also not statistically significant. Additionally, KCPAT scores remained the same or decreased across all age groups, yet none of the changes reached statistical significance ( Table S4 3.2.2. Comparison Between Responder and Non-Responder Groups Among the ten patients with neck pain, four (40%) were NDI treatment responders. Of the 19 patients with LBP, 14 (73.68%) were ODI responders. Among the shoulder pain patients, two of seven (28.57%) were SPADI responders, and six of eight knee pain patients (75%) were WOMAC responders. Overall, 26 of the 44 individuals (59.0%) were responders across various symptom-specific scores. Responders took dietary supplements more frequently and had significantly lower baseline EQ-5D-5L scores than non-responders. No differences were observed in the other variables ( Table S5 Table S6 Of the 20 individuals evaluated with the EQ-5D-5L, 4 (20.00%) were treatment responders. A comparison of baseline characteristics between the EQ-5D-5L responder and non-responder groups revealed that the responders had significantly higher baseline KCPAT scores and significantly lower baseline EQ-5D-5L scores. No differences were found in the other variables ( Table S5 Table S6 No binary analysis was performed for the PainDETECT or KCPAT because of the absence of MCID values. Univariate linear regression analysis of continuous assessment indicators, such as changes in PainDETECT, KCPAT, and EQ-5D-5L scores, identified baseline PainDETECT and KCPAT scores, occupation, and education as influencing factors, although caution is advised due to the small overall sample size ( Table S7, Figure S1 3.3. Safety Evaluation A retrospective analysis of medical records revealed no adverse effects in the patients with successful follow-up. 4. Discussion 4.1. Summary of Findings This retrospective study, analyzing data from 163 patients to evaluate the real-world clinical effectiveness of a combined ECA and ECLI therapy for common musculoskeletal pain. The patient cohort was diverse, with pain locations including the knee, back, neck, and shoulder. Overall, the findings suggest that this combined treatment may offer a beneficial therapeutic strategy for musculoskeletal pain. Among the 44 participants with follow-up data, significant improvements were observed—in general, pain intensity and quality of life. Symptom-specific indices for knee pain and low back pain also showed significant improvements. However, the changes in NDI and SPADI scores were not statistically significant. Notably, a majority of the participants (59.0%) were identified as responders across various symptom-specific scores. Analysis of this responder group revealed that they were more frequent users of dietary supplements and had significantly lower baseline quality of life scores compared to non-responders. This is the first study to demonstrate the effectiveness of this integrated treatment, providing a pioneering approach in TKM. These findings not only validate the clinical response but also offer a foundation for further studies on holistic and personalized medical practices. 4.2. Responder of ECM In the context of ECM, it is crucial to consider variability in patient responses, as in other forms of TKM, including herbal and acupuncture treatments. Although our study did not find significant differences in this system between responders and non-responders, this aspect merits further discussion. The responder group had a markedly poorer quality of life at the start of treatment, suggesting that those with an overall more compromised physical condition might exhibit a more positive response to therapy. Furthermore, the higher rate of dietary supplement intake in the responder group may imply that superior health-related habits can lead to improved treatment outcomes. However, this hypothesis requires further investigation. Additional research is required to determine whether these tendencies are characteristic of acupuncture therapy, in general, or specific to this treatment. In the realm of herbal medicine, research has shown that factors such as BMI can influence treatment response [ 41 42 4.3. Personalized Medicine and ECM The increasing awareness of personalized or precision medicine among clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and medical consumers has underscored the need for tailored treatment approaches. Precision medicine typically involves the use of diagnostic tools and treatments tailored to the genetic, biomarker, or psychosocial characteristics of the patients [ 43 Within this framework, a key principle of personalization is the concept of a constitution, which classifies individuals into distinct types based on their unique physiological characteristics [ 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 45 4.4. Value and Strengths of ECM Improvements in diet and exercise are crucial for enhancing health-related quality of life. However, the effects are not uniform and vary according to an individual’s constitution type [ 50 ECA uses a fast-in, fast-out method with standardized ECA guide tube, making it minimally invasive [ 22 51 21 4.5. Strengths and Implications for Clinical Practice This study aimed to evaluate the treatment response and safety of ECA and ECLI for musculoskeletal pain in clinical practice setting. One of the main strengths is the use of real-world data from primary ECM clinics which retrospectively examined medical records of patients with various types of musculoskeletal pain. This is beneficial for assessing the treatment effectiveness and patient responses in real clinical settings. Although previous studies have used this model for neck pain, lumbar disc herniation, and degenerative knee osteoarthritis [ 17 19 52 18 19 52 53 54 The ECM therapeutic approach is distinct from conventional pain management standards, including those of European guidelines [ 12 Additionally, as there were no significant differences between the responders and non-responders, this approach can be applied to a diverse range of patients in clinical settings without being confined to any specific subgroup. Nevertheless, further research into the characteristics of the responder groups is necessary. 4.6. Limitation and Suggestion for Further Study This study had several limitations. First, as a retrospective review of real-world data, a formal a priori power calculation was not performed. The study was exploratory, aiming to investigate clinical effectiveness based on existing medical records. We acknowledge this limitation and highlight the small sample size as a reason for caution when interpreting the results and as a justification for future large-scale prospective studies. Second, the retrospective chart review design cannot exclude the possibility of selection and information bias; therefore, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results of this study, especially regarding clinical effectiveness. The limited sample size also posed a challenge for statistical adjustment. Third, a retrospective analysis of real-world data may not have captured all the variables that could influence treatment outcomes. These findings provide foundational data and justification for future large-scale, prospective controlled studies, particularly for determining effect size, appropriate treatment duration, and outcome variable. Prospective studies are required to identify additional factors affecting treatment response. Our research team plans to conduct prospective registry studies based on these results. Fourth, this study followed the routine clinical practice protocols of ECM clinics by applying a combined intervention of acupuncture and lifestyle intervention, exploring the primary factors contributing to the observed effects challenging. Future studies should quantitatively evaluate dosage and adherence to this treatment and to lifestyle interventions. The development of assessment tools for lifestyle habits and dietary intake is a prerequisite for such studies. Fifth, the wide age range of participants may have introduced heterogeneity in treatment response. However, this reflects real-world clinical practice, where patients of various ages seek care for similar complaints, which may enhance the generalizability of the findings. Finally, its findings may have limited generalizability beyond East Asia, particularly to Western cultures. This is primarily due to the established public understanding and clinical integration of acupuncture and constitutional medicine in East Asian healthcare. Additionally, lifestyle management strategies like ECLI are culturally specific, making direct application elsewhere challenging. These contextual differences can significantly influence treatment outcomes. Therefore, caution is necessary when extrapolating results to different cultural or healthcare systems. Future research should explore the applicability of this treatment in diverse cultural settings. 5. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the clinical response and safety of individualized and minimally invasive treatment (ECA and ECLI) for musculoskeletal pain using real-world data. In this study, we suggest that these treatments can significantly improve certain metrics of musculoskeletal pain, indicating the potential for the clinical application of personalized constitution-based treatment through ECM. However, the limitations of this study, including its small sample size and retrospective design without a control group, necessitate further multi-institutional prospective studies and the development of tools to measure the dosage and adherence to this treatment.
