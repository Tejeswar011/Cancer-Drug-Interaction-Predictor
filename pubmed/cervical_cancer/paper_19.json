Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Sorafenib is the only FDA approved drug for HCC patients, affecting patient survival by just a few months with significant toxicities in approximately half of HCC patients and the poor prognosis of these patients. Thus, the combination therapy with Sorafenib and Natural killer (NK) cells has been suggested, due to NK cells' distinct effectiveness against HCC. This research examined the main signaling pathways in HCC progression affected by Sorafenib or NK cells in combination or individual treatment. The xenograft model of HCC was created by implanting human HepG2 cells subcutaneously into the flank of 12 nude mice and then divided into four groups: Control, Sorafenib, NK cells, and Sorafenib plus NK cells. Four weeks post tumor implantation, the mice were euthanized, and the levels of liver and kidney enzymes were analysed for safety purposes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was used to measure the expression of key effector genes related to Sorafenib and NK cell functions with focused on the signaling pathways involved in the development of HCC. The levels of Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alanine transaminase (ALT), Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (Cr) in all groups remained in normal ranges. The expression levels of certain proliferative, anti-apoptotic factors were reduced in groups treated with either Sorafenib or NK cells only, but in combinational treated group showed no significant differences compared to control group. Also, the NK cell effector function related genes were upregulated in NK cell treated group, but inhibited in co administration of both NK cell and Sorafenib. Therefore, combining Sorafenib and NK cells at the prescribed dosage led to a decrease in the anti-cancer efficiency of both and may not be a successful option for HCC treatment.

These pathways control the expression of key genes related to apoptosis, such as baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5 (BIRC5), Cyclin D1 (CCND1), Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and MYC proto-oncogene. Survivin, also known as BIRC5, is a part of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family and is commonly found in high levels in HCC. It can prevent cell death by inhibiting caspase 3, 7, and 9, leading to excessive cell growth. The CCND1 gene encodes the protein cyclin D1, which plays a role in advancing the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependant kinase. Cyclin D1 is a cell cycle regulator that activated by the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and promotes progression through the cell cycle and its overexpression can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. MYC is a transcription factor activated by multiple pathways, including Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR, which promotes cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism, and its overexpression is a hallmark of many cancers. A growth factor that promotes angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, VEGF, is often overexpressed in tumors due to activation of various pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, driving tumor growth and metastasis [5] [6] The progression of HCC tumors significantly initiated by RTKs such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR/ c-MET), stem cell growth factor receptor (c-KIT), and FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) [7] [4] [8] The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activates by various growth factors and promotes cell survival, proliferation, and growth by inhibiting apoptosis and stimulating protein synthesis. PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 to PIP3, which recruits and activates AKT. Activated AKT, in turn, phosphorylates and inactivates TSC2, a negative regulator of mTOR. Dysregulation of this pathway is a frequent event in cancer, driving tumor growth and resistance to therapy [9] The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is essential for regulating cell growth, blood vessel formation, and changes in liver cells caused by growth factors, making it a possible treatment target for HCC. RTKs activate Ras, which recruits and activates Raf. Then activated Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn activates ERK. Activated ERK translocates to the nucleus and phosphorylates various transcription factors, leading to changes in gene expression. Mutations in Ras, Raf, or MEK are common in cancer, driving uncontrolled cell proliferation. In this route, STAT3 is the key regulator for the transformation induced by RAS oncogenes. The transcription factor STAT3, which has been widely researched, is highly activated in HCC patients either directly by different cytokines and growth factors, or indirectly by the activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway [5] [7] [10] [11] [12] [13] The Wnt/β-catenin pathway also contributes to at least one third of HCC tumor advancement. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is essential for regulating cell cycle and cancer development in both normal and abnormal cell functions. An increase in cytosolic β-catenin levels is triggered by the binding of Wnt ligands to Frizzled receptors on the surface of HCC cells, resulting in the activation of this pathway. The β-catenin subsequently translocates to the nucleus, inducing the transcription of genes such as Cyclin D1, c-myc (MYC), and Survivin that play a role in cell growth [5] [14] [15] [16] The sole FDA-approved drug for advanced HCC is Sorafenib, which functions as a multikinase inhibitor that hinders tumor growth and blood vessel formation. Sorafenib works as an anticancer agent by blocking RTKs like PDGFR, VEGFR, FLT-3, and cKIT, resulting in suppression of downstream signaling in the Ras/Raf/ERK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways [17] [18] [19] [20] [20] Fig. 1 [21] [22] Fig. 1 The schematic diagram of the key signaling pathways in liver cancer initiation and progression affected by Sorafenib or NK cells. Fig. 1 While Sorafenib has positive outcomes for advanced HCC patients, it only extends survival by less than 3 months and leads to significant toxicities in approximately half of patients [23] [24] [25] [26] et al. [27] Another debatable choice is the use of a combination of Sorafenib and NK cells, due to their important role in the early immune response to HCC and their ability to kill different viral and cancer cells. NK cells are a type of lymphocyte with the ability to kill infected cells and boost immune responses against cancer cells. NK cells, as key components of the innate immune system, play a crucial role in anti-tumor immunity [28] [29] [30] Fig. 1 [31] Several previous studies showed that Sorafenib has beneficial effects on the anticancer effector functions of NK cells [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Reagents We mixed Sorafenib powder obtained from American LC LAB Company in a 1 ml of a mixture containing 12.5 % ethanol, 12.5 % Cremophor, and 75 % water in a ratio of 1:1:6 to achieve a concentration of 21.6 mg/ml. Based on the stock solution’s concentration, a desired dose of 30 mg/kg was administered. The precise volume of this solution for each animal was calculated individually according to its measured body weight to ensure accurate dosing at 30 mg/kg. This dosage is consistent with effective concentrations reported in human studies (400 mg, twice daily) [43] 2.2 Cell culture The Iranian National Center for Genetic and Biologic Resources in Tehran provided HepG2 human HCC cell lines, which were cultured in DMEM with high glucose, 10 % fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin under standard conditions (37 °C, 5 % CO2, and 95 % humidity). The NK cells were extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy individuals utilizing the Miltenyi Biotec NK cell Isolation Kit and magnetic associated cell sorting (MACS) columns through negative selection method, subsequently cultured in SCGM medium (CellGenix, Freiburg, Germany) with anti-CD3 Antibody (OKT3) (10 ng/ml), penicillin (100 IU/ml), 10 % FBS, and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) along with irradiated autologous PBMCs as feeder layer. In a prior investigation, NK cell activation was triggered by hrIL-2 (1000 IU/ml) and hrIL-15 (10 ng/ml) [41] 2.3 Xenograft model and treatment The athymic male nude (NU/NU; C57BL/6) mice, aged 6 weeks, were obtained from the Pasteur Institute of Iran. The mice were all kept and cared in a controlled environment with no pathogens, each in their own ventilated cage, at 23 °C with 65 % humidity. In accordance with the findings outlined in our earlier research efforts [40] [44] 7 2 Therapy started on the twelfth day following the injection of HepG2 cells when the tumor grew to a size larger than 200 mm 3 6 2.4 Tumor growth analysis The therapeutic effectiveness of NK cells and Sorafenib (either separately or together) against xenograft HCC tumor caused by human HepG2 cell was evaluated by assessing the tumor growth in nude mice as follows: two times a week for four weeks after treatment with a vernier caliper and using a standard formula of ((length × width 2 2.5 Assessment of in vivo toxicities 2.5.1 Examination of of liver and kidney biochemical factors The safety of cellular treatment in living organisms was evaluated by analyzing biochemical markers in the liver and kidney. In order to accomplish this objective, blood samples were centrifuged at a speed of 1500 g for a period of 10 min to isolate the serum. The AST, ALT, BUN, and Cr levels were assessed with a biochemical analyzer made by Mindray in China. 2.6 Quantitative real-time PCR assay Levels of signaling factors related to HCC tumor advancement were assessed through qRT-PCR, including proliferative factors (BIRC5, CCDN1, Myc, OCT4, β-catenin), angiogenic factors and tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-β), apoptosis related factors (Mcl-1, Bcl-2) and factors associated with the anti-tumor effect of NK cells (perforin, granzyme-B, IFN-γ and TNF-α genes). HCC tumor samples were obtained from different treated groups and total RNA was isolated using a total RNA extraction kit (Takara, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Takara cDNA Synthesis Kit from Japan was utilized to generate cDNA from 1 µg of RNA with a 260/280 ratio of approximately 2. The quantification of gene expression was done using qRT-PCR with ABI-7000 detection system thermal cycler by Applied Biosystems in the USA, with SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan), 10 Pm of each primer, 100 ng cDNA (2 µl), SYBR Green I Master Mix (2X) (BioFact, Korea), and nuclease-free H 2 –ΔΔCT 2.7 Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to check normality. If the data followed a normal distribution, one-way ANOVA was applied, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. If the data were not normally distributed, the Kruskal–Wallis test was used, followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test. The differences in variances between the two groups were examined using the Student's t test for independent means. GraphPad Prism software evaluated the data, and the 2 –ΔΔCT 3 Results 3.1 Analysis of tumor growth As illustrated in Fig. 2 Table 1 Fig. 2 The xenograft HCC tumors removed from differentially treated nude mice on the 40th day of the study.

ALT AST BUN Cr 3.3 qRT-PCR analysis 3.3.1 Tyrosine kinase receptors As Fig. 3 , Fig. 3 Assessing the expression levels of important tyrosine kinase receptors (VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-B, c-Kit, Flt3) during HCC tumor initiation compared to Sorafenib targeted therapy in four treated groups (Control, Sorafenib, NK cell, Sorafenib & NK cell). Treatment with either NK cell alone or Sorafenib resulted in a substantial reduction in receptor expression levels. The NK cell & Sorafenib treated group had the highest levels of expression for all factors, with no discernible differences compared to the control group. The Student's t test was utilized to assess the disparities between the two groups. Statistical variances were considered notable at p-values of less than 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**), 0.001 (***), and 0.0001 (****). Fig. 3 3.3.2 Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK/STAT signaling pathway A significant decrease in the relative expression levels of important target genes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways was observed in the monotherapy group treated with Sorafenib ((BIRC5 (p-value= 0/00989), CCDN1 (p-value= 0/12826), Bcl-2 (p-value= 0/00939), Mcl-1 (p-value= 0/02335)) or NK cells ((BIRC5 (p-value= 0/008438), CCDN1 (p-value= 0/03014), Bcl-2 (p-value= 0/02653), Mcl-1 (p-value= 0/07898)) compared to control group ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 The qRT-PCR analysis was utilized to assess the expression levels of important downstream target genes of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways (BIRC5, CCDN1, OCT4, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1) in xenograft HCC tissues following various treatments. Treatment with either NK cell alone or Sorafenib resulted in a notable decrease in the levels of these genes linked to HCC cell proliferation, viability, and cell death. However, there were no significant alterations in the gene expression of any genes, except for OCT4, in the NK cell & Sorafenib treated group when compared to the control group. Student's t test for independent means was used to analyze the variances between the two groups. Emphasis was placed on the significance of statistical variations with p values below 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**), 0.001 (***), and 0.0001 (****). Fig. 4 3.3.3 Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway The statistical analysis presented a notable reduction in the relative amounts of β-catenin and its target gene MYC in HCC tumors after treatment with Sorafenib (β-catenin (p-value= 0.02724), MYC (p-value= 0.04531)) or NK cells ((β-catenin (p-value= 0.07618), MYC (p-value= 0.00219)) compared to control group in Fig. 5 3.3.4 The pathways of NK cell effector function against HCC tumors As shown in Fig. 6 , 4 Discussions HCC is a prevalent issue worldwide and ranks third in cancer-related mortality globally [45] [23] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [30] [36] [37] [51] [52] [7] As shown in Fig. 2 Table 1 [53] [54] Table 2 Sorafenib hinders the inhibition of tyrosine kinase receptors such as VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-β, EGFR, c-Kit, and Flt3, which ultimately impedes the proliferation of tumor cells and angiogenesis [20] [25] Fig. 3 Fig. 3 These results are consistent with those of previous studies which showed Sorafenib reduces the number and activity of NK cells in HCC tumors by inhibiting ERK phosphorylation and decreasing plasma levels of MCP-1 and IFN-γ [55] [56] It was reported that Sorafenib primarily affects the proliferation and function of NK cells by blocking the PI3K/AKT and ERK pathways, rather than directly impacting the JAK/STAT3 pathway [37] [38] The expression levels of the most important target genes of Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways including OCT4, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, cyclin D1 (CCND1), and surviving (BIRC5) in different treated groups have been illustrated in Fig. 4 However, the cooperation between Sorafenib and NK cells showed no significant difference comparing control group. Additionally, the individual use of Sorafenib or NK cells led to a noteworthy decrease in the expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 genes. However, in the group that received both treatments, this effect was limited and did not differ significantly from the control group. This finding suggests that NK cells and Sorafenib may hinder each other's ability against HCC tumor growth by modulating JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Ras/Raf/ERK/MEK or Wnt/β-catenin pathways, thereby affecting the expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, cyclin D1, and survivin levels. Also, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 These findings are consistent with previous studies that showed Sorafenib inhibit the JAK/STAT signaling pathway and regulate the levels of pSTAT3 and its downstream genes necessary for cellular activities like metabolism, growth, angiogenesis, and survival, such as Bcl-2, Mcl-1, cyclin D1, and survivin by enhancing the amounts of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatase [20] [57] [58] [59] The exact mechanism of how NK cells affect OCT4 expression in HCC is still being researched, but it's likely related to their ability to kill cancer cells and modulate the tumor microenvironment. The results of combined treated groups can be justified by finding of one study that showed Sorafenib inhibits the JAK-STAT pathway by decreasing phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT5 in response to IFN-α and IL-2, respectively, leading to reduced NK cell function, including diminished production of cytokines like IFN-γ and impaired proliferation [56] The Wnt/β-catenin pathway, found in at least one-third of HCC tumors, is considered one of the most difficult to inhibit. This pathway controls the transcription of specific genes such as Cyclin D1, c-myc (MYC), and Survivin, assisting in the advancement of the cell cycle and the prevention of apoptosis [5] [60] Fig. 5 [61] [62] [63] Fig. 5 Evaluation of the expression of the key target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (MYC), involved in tumor progression. The findings indicated a notable rise in β-catenin and MYC gene expression in either the NK cell or Sorafenib group when used as a standalone treatment. However, the combined therapy of NK cell and Sorafenib resulted in increased β-catenin and MYC gene expression levels, although the difference was not statistically significant. The Student's t test for independent means was employed to examine the differences in variances between the two groups. Statistical significance was determined for variances with p values less than 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**), 0.001 (***), and 0.0001 (****). Fig. 5 For evaluation of the Sorfenib effect on the NK cell effector function in combinational therapy of HCC, the expression levels of most important factors including TNF-α, IFN-γ, Perforin, Granzyme was measured in the xenograft HCC tumors. As shown in Fig. 6 , Fig. 6 Evaluation of the expression of the key NK cell effector function genes (Perforin, Granzyme-B, IFN-γ and TNF-α) in different treated group. Expression of mRNA was quantified by real-time PCR and normalized to GAPDH gene, n = 6 tumors for each group. Ctrl control, Sor Sorafenib, NKC NK cells, NKC & Sor combination of NK Cells and Sorafenib. The Student's t test for independent means was employed to examine the differences in variances between the two groups. Statistical significance was determined for variances with p values less than 0.05 (*), 0.01 (**), 0.001 (***), and 0.0001 (****). Fig. 6 The observed loss of efficacy when combining Sorafenib with NK cells in treating HCC can be attributed to several interrelated factors. While Sorafenib is a standard treatment, it has been shown to suppress NK cell activity, which may counteract the intended synergistic effects of the combination therapy. As reported in recent study, Sorafenib significantly reduces the number and activity of NK cells in tumor-bearing models, leading to decreased levels of critical cytokines like IFN-γ and MCP-1 [55] et al [37] In addition, the tumor microenvironment in HCC is often immunosuppressive, which can hinder NK cell expansion and persistence, limiting their effectiveness even when combined with Sorafenib [51] [40] et al [38] Accordingly, while the combination of Sorafenib and NK cells shows promise, the inherent challenges of NK cell suppression and tumor microenvironmental factors may necessitate additional strategies to optimize treatment efficacy. Several studies suggest that enhancing NK cell functionality through cytokine activation or combining Sorafenib with immune checkpoint inhibitors, like anti-PD-L1, may improve therapeutic outcomes by overcoming the immunosuppressive effects of Sorafenib [64] [65] In conclusion, Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is known to affect various signaling pathways. There is increasing evidence that Sorafenib can regulate the function of immune cells, particularly NK cells against HCC tumors, particularly in combination treatments. This reduction is primarily due to Sorafenib's immunosuppressive effects, which diminish NK cell function and their ability to lyse tumor cells. In combination therapies, the negative impact on NK cell efficacy may be exacerbated, as Sorafenib can modulate the immune response, further impairing NK cell activation and expansion. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies, as identifying effective combination therapies could help mitigate Sorafenib's adverse effects on NK cells, thereby enhancing overall anti-tumor responses. The mechanism by which Sorafenib affects NK cell function is not yet comprehensively clarified, suggesting that varying doses could potentially influence NK cell efficacy against HCC tumors, warranting further investigation into optimal dosing strategies. Therefore, careful consideration of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity is essential when developing treatment regimens for HCC that include Sorafenib and a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism is necessary in order to optimize the combination of Sorafenib and NK cell-based immunotherapy for the treatment of HCC. 5 Conclusions Sorafenib and NK cells modulate multiple signaling pathways in HCC, including Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, NF-κB, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin and JAK/STAT pathway. These pathways are critical for tumor growth, immune evasion, and drug resistance. Combination therapies targeting these pathways offer promising strategies to enhance Sorafenib and NK cell efficacy and overcome drug resistance. In this study, we investigated how Sorafenib and NK cells impact the key signaling pathways that contribute to the development of HCC tumors in human HCC xenograft mouse models, either individually or in combination. Analyzing the relationship between Sorafenib and NK cells at a molecular level demonstrated that when used together, they can impede the antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, and apoptotic effects on HCC tumors. Our findings suggest that Sorafenib may not be the optimal option for cancer treatment when used in conjunction with NK cells for managing HCC in the described manner. Nevertheless, we suggest further mechanistic studies that could elucidate the precise interactions between Sorafenib and NK cells that lead to this non-synergistic outcome. Also, more research is needed to examine how different doses of Sorafenib and NK cells interact in combined treatment for HCC, since the effects of Sorafenib on NK cell functions differ depending on dosage and timing.
