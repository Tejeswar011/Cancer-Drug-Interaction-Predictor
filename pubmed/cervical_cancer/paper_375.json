Hispanic and Latino melanoma patients face significant disparities in patient outcomes and survival rates due to challenges in melanoma care, including later-stage diagnoses, disproportionate financial burdens, and cultural differences. Healthcare insurance status is an important contributing factor to these disparities, with uninsured Hispanic patients being more likely to delay seeking medical attention and face higher out-of-pocket costs. Socioeconomic factors, including lower income levels, limited education, and occupations that may increase UV exposure exacerbate these disparities. Additional factors such as inadequate patient education, language barriers, and inadequate health education campaigns also limit melanoma awareness, prevention, and healthcare access in Hispanic populations. Consequently, there is an urgent need for culturally tailored interventions, such as community-based, targeted health campaigns and enhanced, culturally sensitive provider training to better address these disparities and improve melanoma outcomes in Hispanic and Latino populations. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer as, arising from the malignant transformation of melanocytes within the basal layer of the epidermis, it is prone to metastasizing [ 1 2 3 3 4 5 In the United States, the Hispanic population, including both Latinos and Hispanics, are the second-largest racial or ethnic group, accounting for 19.1% of the total population [ 6 7 8 9 Many factors contribute to the later-stage diagnoses observed in Hispanic populations by hindering timely treatment, including restricted healthcare access, socioeconomic determinants, insufficient patient education about melanoma, language barriers, and cultural practices or beliefs. The lack of access to health insurance for Hispanic communities results in individuals delaying their visits to healthcare professionals in a timely manner, and the out-of-pocket costs can hinder their ability to seek both diagnosis and treatment [ 10 11 12 To provide clarity and direction in addressing these complex challenges, this narrative review was conducted by identifying and evaluating relevant articles from PubMed, Google Scholar, and other academic databases (2000–2025) using search terms such as “melanoma” or “cutaneous melanoma” combined with terms related to inequities in the examined population including “disparities,” “Hispanic,” “Latino,” “healthcare access,” “socioeconomic determinants,” “insurance,” “cultural competence,” “health education,” “language barriers,” “acculturation,” “public health campaigns,” “prevention,” “intervention,” “artificial intelligence,” and “medical education.” Studies were included if they addressed clinical characteristics, epidemiology in Hispanics, healthcare access or insurance, socioeconomic or occupational determinants, prevention or education, language or cultural barriers, technological advances, or medical education initiatives. Non-English articles, case reports, and studies unrelated to melanoma disparities in Hispanics were excluded. Over 70 studies, covering epidemiological data, systematic reviews, qualitative research, expert commentaries, and intervention trials, were assessed for relevance and contribution to current knowledge and guiding future directions in the field. In summary, melanoma disparities in Hispanic populations are examined through a synthesis of current evidence, with particular emphasis on the following areas ( Table 1 • Examines the epidemiology of melanoma among Hispanics, highlighting their higher likelihood of late-stage diagnosis and worse survival compared to NHWs. • Analyzes structural and socioeconomic barriers such as low insurance coverage, immigration-related access challenges, and occupational risk factors prevalent in Hispanic communities. • Explores cultural and linguistic factors, including health literacy, acculturation, and the role of familism, that influence prevention behaviors and healthcare utilization. • Reviews existing targeted public health campaigns, including digital and community-based educational strategies tailored to Hispanic populations. • Highlights the need for enhanced provider training and a more diverse healthcare workforce to improve communication and trust. • Proposes future priorities for research and policy to reduce melanoma disparities and promote equitable care in this rapidly growing segment of the U.S. population. In this review, we begin by recognizing healthcare insurance challenges affecting melanoma outcomes in Hispanic populations, followed by an examination of the role of socioeconomic determinants. We then discuss disparities related to limited education and inadequate health education campaigns. Cultural and linguistic factors, including language barriers and acculturation, are subsequently explored. The final sections address current prevention efforts and future directions, including early detection strategies, public health campaigns, medical education initiatives, provider training, and proposed areas for future investigation. 2. Healthcare Insurance There is a low rate of health insurance, particularly among noncitizen Latino immigrants, of whom less than half report health insurance coverage due to various structural and sociopolitical barriers that limit access to healthcare [ 13 17 46 17 17 47 14 15 16 2.1. Socioeconomic Determinants Poverty, economic opportunity, and level of educational attainment are community factors that have also been demonstrated to influence health and outcomes. Currently, limited research has been conducted on the community factors influencing melanoma outcomes in Hispanics, with existing studies relying on composite measure data derived from population-based cancer registries. This makes it more challenging to decipher which determinants result in melanoma inequities among Hispanic subgroups. Among Hispanics, high-SES individuals make up one-third of those with melanoma, while more than 60% of NHWs with melanoma incidence were high-SES individuals [ 48 Furthermore, a large number of Hispanics work in outdoor occupations, such as transportation, construction, landscaping, agriculture, and maintenance [ 18 19 20 Subsequently, the different subgroups of Hispanics in the United States have different migration and settlement patterns. Nearly all Puerto Ricans are native-born US citizens, and more than two-thirds of Mexican Americans in the United States are US-born. On the other hand, most other national origin groups are principally foreign-born [ 49 50 2.2. Limited Education Education level is a crucial link between socioeconomic status and health, potentially predicting cancer outcomes [ 21 22 23 23 21 24 2.3. Inadequate Health Education Campaigns Health education and communication campaigns play pivotal roles in shaping risk behaviors and health perceptions, particularly those associated with skin cancer and melanoma. Studies show that mass media campaigns can influence risky behaviors at the population health level [ 51 52 53 8 2.4. Language Barriers Language barriers and preferences significantly impact communication between the patient and healthcare provider, often leading to poorer health outcomes due to the inability to effectively communicate information [ 30 31 54 2.5. Cultural Differences and Acculturation Many studies have recognized provider bias and behaviors as a crucial contributing factor to health inequities, suggesting that cultural and language differences between patients and their healthcare providers may impact their outcomes [ 55 56 57 33 Cultural values and beliefs held by Hispanic populations also present challenges in effectively serving Hispanic patients. Familism (familismo), a cultural value in which the family is more important than the self, emphasizes family unity, collective well-being, and loyalty, and it may result in underuse of healthcare resources, including home healthcare services [ 34 35 36 38 35 39 Acculturation can be defined as the extent to which a person from a nondominant ethnic group assimilates aspects of the dominant ethnic group's culture [ 58 59 40 41 42 Aside from behavioral effects, low acculturation may also potentially account for the lower trust placed in providers by Hispanics compared with NHW and Black populations [ 54 43 44 45 2.6. Prevention and Future Directions 2.6.1. Screening and Early Detection Early detection of melanoma is crucial as it significantly improves prognosis by identifying the disease at an earlier, more treatable stage [ 60 61 62 Some strategies to treat NHW individuals effectively include emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI)-based image analysis, along with sequential digital dermoscopy, teledermatology, or dermatoscopy inspections [ 63 64 65 66 67 In parallel, broader public health strategies such as community outreach programs, mobile clinics, free screening days, and expanded Medicare coverage can also help address socioeconomic barriers and promote earlier melanoma detection in Hispanic communities. Culturally tailored health campaigns that take place within the local community such as at schools, churches, or community centers can resonate with the diverse populations [ 68 69 70 Mobile screening units which are traveling clinics that provide cancer screening services outside of traditional clinical settings can also increase early detection and screenings [ 71 72 73 Moreover, free screening days in clinics, hospitals, or pop-up centers can encourage patients who avoid preventive screenings due to cost to access these services. The integration of free health screening days can advance public health efforts allowing for collaboration with the community such as at schools or community organizations, providing essential health services but also creating an opportunity to educate individuals who participate in the screenings [ 74 75 76 77 Furthermore, Medicaid has undergone significant changes, specifically with the Affordable Care Act which has expanded its coverage for cancer screenings, making preventive services accessible to more individuals. Currently, 10 states have not adopted the Medicaid expansion. Texas and Florida are notable examples since combined, they account for a significant proportion of the Hispanic population in the United States and have higher rates of uninsured rates of Hispanics when compared with Medicaid expansion states [ 78 79 2.6.2. Public Health Campaigns Targeted education may be an effective strategy for mitigating skin cancer disparities in the Hispanic population in the United States. Greene et al. reported increased melanoma knowledge in Latino patients after implementing a targeted digital educational program. Their program involved emailing a random sample of Latino patients, Instagram and Facebook advertisements, and posts on Mayo Clinic's social media channels and websites. In their study, they reported that study participants showed a 22% increase in their melanoma knowledge score and sustained an 11% increase at the 3-month follow-up visit [ 25 26 Additionally, qualitative explorations aimed at designing culturally relevant tools for skin cancer prevention among Hispanic individuals have suggested social media apps such as WhatsApp would be a promising tool for disseminating melanoma educational materials [ 27 28 27 Besides digital educational programs, community-based programs have also been proven to be effective. In a pilot program that collaborated with community centers to enhance skin cancer awareness and screening among Latinos in Chicago, most participants improved from “not at all” confident regarding performing skin examinations to “somewhat confident” by attending structured educational sessions led by Spanish-speaking Lay Health Workers and practicing examination techniques with guidance [ 29 2.6.3. Enhancing Medical Education Frameworks The curricula for medical schools, residency programs, and fellowships should integrate health systems, cultural competence, and health financing topics. Even though this is standard across many medical schools in the United States, there is a need to further tailor these materials to Hispanics in the United States. Medical Spanish programs in healthcare provider training programs may also help address language barriers, with longitudinal Spanish programs being associated with improved Spanish-listening comprehension in medical programs [ 32 2.6.4. Provider Training The recent reversal of affirmative action policies may further exacerbate the discordant care experienced by Hispanic patients due to the decreased number of physicians from the underrepresented minorities entering the US healthcare workforce [ 57 An important Hispanic cultural value to take into account when delivering healthcare is familism because of its role in decreasing home healthcare services usage. As such, provider management strategies should not only demonstrate acknowledgment of and respect for familism but also strive to encourage optimization of adherence and self-care when deemed appropriate [ 35 34 Likewise, acculturation and recognition of ethnic heterogeneity along with the associated language barriers must also be addressed. A potential direction could include the healthcare system usage of Medicaid funding and Health Resources and Services Administration grants to collaborate with local agencies working with settling legal immigrants. Recruited legal immigrants could help create English-language instruction that incorporates healthcare topics for new immigrants [ 54 54 80 7 3. Related Works Several prior articles have documented melanoma disparities affecting Hispanic populations. Multiple epidemiological analyses have shown that Hispanics are more likely to receive a late-stage melanoma diagnosis and suffer worse survival outcomes compared with NHWs [ 53 81 82 53 83 84 While valuable, most existing studies tend to focus on isolated determinants such as epidemiology, insurance status, or cultural factors individually [ 53 81 4. Conclusion Delayed diagnosis and inferior outcomes in Hispanic melanoma patients are the consequences of pervasive, multifactorial disparities accumulated across healthcare accessibility, socioeconomic, and cultural domains. Addressing these burdens through integration of preventative screenings, targeted educational campaign expansions and culturally sensitive, comprehensive provider training are essential to refining the current healthcare framework in order to deliver improved melanoma treatment to Hispanic patients. Moving forward, further studies clarifying the etiology of and causal relationships between the risk factors in this population are necessary so as to uncover previously overlooked patterns and ultimately advance equitable patient care. Efforts should also prioritize the adoption of rigorously validated technologies, such as AI-assisted diagnostic tools, to ensure accurate melanoma detection across diverse Hispanic subgroups. Expanding Medicaid coverage and reducing immigration-related barriers remain critical steps to improving access to care. Furthermore, culturally tailored, bilingual educational initiatives delivered through popular social media platforms alongside community outreach can enhance awareness and promote early detection. Strengthening medical education on Hispanic health needs and increasing Hispanic representation in the healthcare workforce will further improve patient–provider communication and foster trust, leading to better outcomes. Ongoing research into the diverse experiences within Hispanic populations is essential for the development of precise, effective interventions that can ultimately reduce melanoma disparities and support long-term health equity in this underserved community.

Barriers Impact Proposed solutions Low health insurance among noncitizen Latino immigrants [ 13 High uninsured rates leading to decreased access and increased preventable hospitalizations; limited use of specialty care, despite outreach programs [ 14 16 Medicaid expansion; community education to reduce immigration-related enrolment fears; mobile clinics and public–private partnerships Non-Medicaid expansion in certain states (Texas, Florida) [ 17 Sustained higher uninsured rates among Hispanics in those states, contributing to poorer access Advocacy for Medicaid expansion Socioeconomic challenges (poverty, economic opportunity, low education) Occupational UV exposure and chemical hazards; poor sunscreen use and low cancer knowledge among outdoor Hispanic workers [ 18 20 21 24 Targeted skin cancer education emphasizing prevention behaviors; campaigns focused on outdoor workers Limited health literacy and melanoma awareness Poor awareness of melanoma risk; lower perception of risk among Hispanics Tailored digital and community health education, including use of social media and lay health workers [ 25 29 Linguistic barriers Poor communication; delayed diagnosis [ 30 31 Culturally and linguistically tailored education; bilingual providers; medical Spanish training for providers [ 32 Provider shortages and underrepresentation of Hispanics in the medical workforce Lower patient satisfaction linked to race concordance; only 5.7% of U.S. medical graduates are Hispanic, contributing to care discordance [ 33 Increase Hispanic medical student recruitment and retention; cultural competence training for providers Cultural differences, heterogeneity in Hispanic subgroups (nativity, migration) and acculturation Underuse of healthcare services due to familism (family-centered values); delayed melanoma diagnosis; variable adherence due to fatalism, marianismo, machismo, folk beliefs [ 34 39 40 45 Community- and family-focused culturally competent campaigns; provider training on Hispanic cultural values and acculturation; customized education and intervention programs that address subgroup-specific needs and acculturation level Insufficient medical education on Hispanic health needs Providers less aware of cultural, linguistic, and financial barriers faced by Hispanics, impacting care quality Incorporate Hispanic health and cultural competence training in medical education; medical Spanish programs [ 32 ",
