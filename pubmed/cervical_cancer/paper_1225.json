Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a major global health concern, ranking as the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 Immunotherapy, which harnesses and enhances the effect of the immune system against tumor cells, has achieved significant progress through the emergence of ICIs, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, and experimental therapeutic vaccines, as well as the development of new strategies that modulate the tumor microenvironment to inhibit those immunosuppressive signals that prevent the immune system from attacking tumor cells [ 5 4 6 7 8 9 10 Research into new molecules capable of counteracting these suppressive mechanisms would offer great potential for the treatment of different CRC subtypes, especially those characterized by strong immune evasion. Additionally, the development of novel therapeutic strategies that enhance the recruitment of effector cells into the tumor microenvironment may also improve outcomes in tumors with deficient immune activity or low basal infiltration. Phytochemicals, which are natural bioactive compounds produced by plants, have demonstrated a broad range of biological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory effects. These compounds can modulate both systemic immunity and gut microbiota composition, thus offering a multifaceted approach for cancer prevention and treatment [ 11 Allium 12 13 14 15 Allium 16 17 18 Allium cepa 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Reagents and Treatment PTSO ( Figure 1 Allium cepa 19 13 20 2.2. Generating CSCs-Enriched Colonospheres The human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 was used to generate CSCs-enriched colonospheres, according to the patented protocol WO2016020572A1 [ 21 ® ® 2.3. Isolation and Culture of Human PBMCs Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) were isolated from healthy donors following written informed consent. Cells were obtained via density gradient centrifugation using Lymphoprep™ (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% L-glutamin, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1% amphotericin B. hPBMCs were treated with vehicle (DMEM) or 25 μM for 48 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 2.4. Immunophenotyping of PBMCs PTSO- or vehicle-treated hPBMCs ( n Table S1 2.5. Immune-Humanized Tumor-Bearing Murine Model Animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” and were approved by the Ethics Committee (Ref. No.07/12/2019/127). NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice were obtained from the Center for Scientific Instrumentation (University of Granada, Spain) and maintained under controlled environmental conditions (22 ± 1 °C, 55 ± 10% humidity, 12 h light/dark cycle) with ad libitum access to standard chow (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and water. Animal welfare was continuously monitored by qualified staff to ensure the well-being of the animals throughout all experimental procedures. ARRIVE guidelines were followed throughout the study. Mice ( n 6 ® 6 Figure 1 V = length 2 (1) The tumor size was controlled to not exceed the maximum, 3 cm 3 n After mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine (10 mg/kg) and xylazine (100 mg/kg) and subsequently euthanized by cervical dislocation, tumors were excised and weighed. Blood and tumor samples were taken and stored for further gene expression, flow cytometry, and histological analysis. 2.6. Immune Profiling of Blood and Tumor Samples At the endpoint of the in vivo assay, tumors and blood samples were harvested for immune profiling. Blood was collected via cardiac puncture and subjected to red blood cell lysis. Tumor tissues were cut into small pieces and enzymatically digested in 5 mL of HBSS (40–50 mg tissue/mL) containing 400 U/mL DNase, 500 U/mL collagenase type IV and 0.09 U/mL dispase II (Roche Applied System, Penzberg, Germany). Digestion was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with agitation, then washed twice with cold PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and filtered through a 70-μm nylon mesh. Single cell suspensions from blood were stained with anti-C45, anti-CD193, anti-CD14, and anti-CD64 ( Table S2 Table S2 2.7. RNA Extraction and Analysis of Gene Expression Total RNA from tumor tissues was extracted using the Maxwell ® −ΔΔCt Supplementary Table S2 2.8. Histological Studies Tumor sections were fixed in 4% PFA for 24 h and embedded in paraffin for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. For immunofluorescence analysis, antigen retrieval was performed prior to incubation with an anti-KI67 primary antibody (Abcam ® ® AB170057 Images were acquired from three random fields per slide using a light microscope, for H&E-stained sections, or a fluorescence microscope, for KI67 stained sections. Images were captured and analyzed with ImageJ Software (v. 1.54f), which was used to count KI67 positive nuclei and quantify the fluorescence intensity of the labeling with anti-KI67 antibody. 2.9. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using the GraphPad Prism version 8 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). All experimental animals were retained for analysis; no exclusion criteria were applied. Data are presented as mean ± SEM from at least three independent experiments or biological replicates unless otherwise specified in the figure legends. Data distribution was assessed for normality prior to statistical testing. For multiple group comparisons, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was applied. A p 3.

PTSO Reduces the Levels of Immunosuppressive Myeloid Populations In Vitro To investigate the immunomodulatory potential of PTSO, we assessed its effects on myeloid subsets within hPBMCs via flow cytometry. The immunomodulatory role of this compound resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of total CD11b + Figure 2 + + Next, the effect of PTSO on MDSCs, a heterogeneous group of immunosuppressive cells broadly classified into monocytic (M-MDSC, CD14 + low/− high − 22 Figure 2 + + + − 3.2. PTSO Promotes Cytotoxic T Cell Expansion In Vitro The impact of PTSO on T lymphocyte subsets was also evaluated in vitro in the PBMC populations ( Figure 3 Figure 3 + + + + + + + + Figure 3 3.3. Immunomodulatory Activity of PTSO Impairs Tumor Growth in a CRC Xenograft Mouse Model To translate these in vitro findings, we investigated the impact of PTSO-modulated hPBMCs on colorectal tumor development in a xenograft mouse model using HCT116 CSC-enriched colonospheres. Throughout the study, no mortality or overt signs of toxicity were observed in any of the experimental groups. Importantly, the tumors of mice that received PTSO-treated hPBMCs showed a smaller volume from day 14 post-injection, this difference being statistically significant from day 20 until the end of the assay ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 3.4. PTSO Modulates Tumor Cell Proliferation and Invasive Potential To evaluate whether the impact on tumor growth observed in mice receiving PTSO-pretreated hPBMCs was associated with a reduction in tumor cell aggressiveness, tumor sections were analyzed for markers of proliferation and invasion. Immunofluorescence staining of KI67 revealed a significant decrease in the number of KI67-positive nuclei in tumors from the PTSO group, indicating reduced tumor cell proliferation. This was further supported by a decrease in the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), confirming a diminished proliferative index in these tumors. Additionally, gene expression analysis carried out in tumors from the two experimental groups revealed a significant downregulation of the proliferation and invasion marker WNT5A in mice receiving PTSO-pretreated hPBMCs ( Figure 5 Figure 5 3.5. PTSO-Treated hPBMCs Enhance Tumor Immune Infiltration and Deplete the Intratumoral Myeloid Suppressor Cells To further dissect the immune mechanisms underlying tumor control by PTSO treatment, the presence of different immune cell populations was analyzed both in blood and in tumor tissues of xenografted mice treated with hPBMCs. Flow cytometry analysis of blood samples revealed no significant differences between both groups in the levels of total immune cells (CD45 + + + + + + + + Figure 6 + + − + Figure 6 + Figure 6 + + + − + Figure 6 + Figure 6 Figure 6 4. Discussion Immunotherapy has emerged as a transformative approach in cancer treatment, with ICIs demonstrating significant clinical benefit in various malignancies [ 23 24 25 This study demonstrates, for the first time, that PTSO, a bioactive organosulfur compound derived from Allium cepa 26 27 28 Allium cepa 29 4.1. Impact of PTSO on MDSCs and Their Immunosuppressive Signaling in CRC High infiltration of MDSCs within tumors has been consistently associated with poor clinical prognosis, due to their potent suppressive effects on effector lymphocytes and NK cells [ 26 30 31 32 10 33 CD38 has also been described as a pivotal marker in the MDSCs biology by contributing to their maturation. Moreover, high expression of CD38 in MDSCs has been associated with a higher immunosuppressive capacity that results in a greater ability to suppress activated T cells and promote tumor growth in comparison with CD38 low 34 Allium Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan into N-formyl kynurenine and plays a critical role in mediating immunosuppression. This effect is largely attributed to the capacity of IDO to promote an environment conducive to tumor growth by recruiting and activating MDSCs, which in turn contribute to resistance against T cell-targeted immunotherapies [ 35 35 IDO1 25 Allium IDO 36 This study also demonstrates the ability of PTSO to attenuate immunosuppressive activity by downregulating key markers such as MRC1 PVR NECTIN2 37 NECTIN2 + 38 NECTIN2 The poliovirus receptor (PVR) or CD155, also plays an important role in CRC progression and immune evasion. In fact, the expression of this receptor has been found to be increased in almost 90% of CRC patients and has been strongly associated with enhanced tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. PVR facilitates immune escape through its interaction with the TIGIT receptor on T and NK cells, thereby suppressing their cytotoxic functions. These properties make PVR an attractive immunotherapeutic target in CRC [ 39 PVR 4.2. The Role of Anti-Tumor Effector Immune Cells and Their Modulation by PTSO The immunomodulatory capacity of PTSO, demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo, was also linked to a notable increase in anti-tumor effector immune cells, particularly CD4 + + + + 40 41 42 + + + 43 44 Allium + + 29 45 The observed increase in T and NK cell tumor infiltration further suggests that PTSO may influence the expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines that guide immune cell homing to the tumor site. Immunosuppressive myeloid cells are known to impede T cell trafficking by downregulating molecules such as L-selectin; reversing these effects may help reprogram the environment to support more effective immune responses [ 46 Importantly, the enhanced immune infiltration induced by PTSO treatment was associated with a significant anti-tumor effect, as evidenced by reduced tumor volume and compromised tumor architecture in mice receiving PTSO-pretreated PBMCs. This outcome likely reflects increased immune-mediated cytotoxicity, along with impaired angiogenesis. Indeed, MDSCs are known to promote tumor vascularization by secreting pro-angiogenic factors; therefore, their depletion by PTSO may disrupt vascular support, aggravate tumor hypoxia and sensitize cancer cells to immune attack [ 47 4.3. Cancer Stem Cells, Proliferation, and Invasion Moreover, this anti-tumor action observed in the PTSO groups of mice was corroborated molecularly by a reduction in cancer cell proliferation markers, specifically KI67 and WNT5A 48 48 49 50 51 52 WNT5A MMP9 53 MMP9 + 54 Taken together, our findings provide evidence for considering PTSO as a novel immunomodulatory agent capable of reducing immunosuppressive myeloid populations while boosting T and NK cell-mediated anti-tumor responses, ultimately resulting in reduced tumor burden in a CRC xenograft model. By reprogramming the tumor microenvironment from a suppressive to an immunologically active state, PTSO holds promise as a complementary agent to improve the efficacy of immunotherapies such as ICIs and adoptive T cell therapies, which are frequently limited by the presence of MDSCs and dysfunctional T cell activity. 4.4. Structure–Activity Relationship of PTSO Beyond the observed immunomodulatory effects, structural considerations may provide additional insights into the potential mechanisms of action of PTSO. Although no direct studies have addressed the structure–activity relationship of PTSO, evidence from related organosulfur compounds offers valuable clues to infer its possible immunomodulatory properties. In particular, the presence of a thiosulfinate oxide moiety is likely to enable interactions with thiol-containing proteins, thereby modulating key regulators of immune signaling such as NF-κB [ 55 56 55 57 4.5. Translational Implications Regarding translational implications, these results align with clinical data supporting the targeting of myeloid cell populations in CRC as a strategy to improve patient outcomes [ 58 59 4.6. Study Limitations and Future Directions Certain limitations of this study should be acknowledged. The experimental data are derived from in vitro models and xenograft systems, which, although valuable, do not fully capture the complexity of human tumor–immune interactions. The heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment in patients receiving immunotherapy involves intricate crosstalk between immune, stromal, and tumor cells that cannot be entirely replicated in preclinical models. Furthermore, while PTSO has shown promising immunomodulatory activity and its safety profile has been evaluated in vivo [ 60 61 5. Conclusions The present study highlights the immunomodulatory potential of PTSO, evidenced by its ability to reduce immunosuppressive myeloid populations, activate NK cells, and promote the differentiation of T lymphocytes towards effector phenotypes. These immune changes collectively contribute to a decrease in tumor growth, reduction in cancer cell proliferation, and invasiveness. By reprogramming the tumor microenvironment from an immunosuppressive to an immunologically active state, PTSO may enhance the efficacy of current immunotherapeutic approaches. Altogether, these findings position PTSO as a promising nutritional adjuvant for CRC therapy, while future studies are warranted to validate these effects in clinically relevant models and to further investigate its impact on specific myeloid subpopulations and CSC dynamics using patients-derived systems, in order to better elucidate its translational potential.
