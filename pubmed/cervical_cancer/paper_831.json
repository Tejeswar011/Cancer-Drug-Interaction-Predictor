Here, it is found that FLNs are first delivered to the early endosomes and then preferentially fused with lipid droplets (LDs) after entering the cells through endocytosis. This process leads to a notable LDs accumulation, which in turn triggers autophagy via the AMPK‐mTOR‐ULK1 signaling pathway. The cascade ultimately promotes tumor cell growth and invasion. However, autophagy inhibition while FLNs treatment counteracts these effects and further causes mitochondria damage, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and excessive LDs accumulation, eventually leading to cell apoptosis. This indicates a potential anti‐tumor strategy. The animal tests further demonstrate that intratumoral injection of FLNs together with an autophagy inhibitor (3‐MA) effectively suppresses tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastasis without harming normal cells in mice, confirming a promising and safe anti‐tumor strategy of applying FLNs under autophagy inhibition conditions. The findings represent a substantial step forward in comprehending the biological effects of biomedical carriers. This work reveals a novel extracellular nanoparticle transport and metabolic pathway. Following cellular uptake, Food‐grade lipid nanoparticles (FLNs) selectively fuse with lipid droplets (LDs) rather than lysosomes, driving LDs accumulation. This process activates autophagy through the AMPK‐mTOR‐ULK1 signaling axis, facilitating tumor progression. Autophagy inhibition not only reverses FLNs‐mediated oncogenic effects but also induces mitochondrial dysfunction, elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS), and causes excessive LDs accumulation, culminating in cell apoptosis. These effects collectively suppress tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and metastatic potential while preserving normal cellular function. autophagy food‐grade lipid nanoparticles lipid droplets tumor growth National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/501100001809 32172341 U23A20258 Key R&D Program of Ningbo, China 2024Z280 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September 18, 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.3 mode:remove_FC converted:19.09.2025  C.

This diversity leads to a broad spectrum of interactions at the cellular and organelle levels, many of which are not yet fully understood. The unique interactions of NPs may trigger unexpected secondary biological effects, which can be either beneficial or harmful. [  1 ] Food lipid nanoparticles (FLNs) are widely used nanocarriers for delivering numerous bioactive nutrients. They are known for their edibility, ease of preparation, high encapsulation and delivery efficiency, and excellent histocompatibility. [  2  3 ] [  4  5  6  7 ] [  8  9  10  11 ] Therefore, this study employed monoglyceride‐stabilized soybean oil NPs as a model to investigate the cellular effects of FLNs. Interestingly, a novel metabolism mode of FLNs was observed, in which they were internalized into intestinal cells and fused with intracellular lipid droplets (LDs) rather than undergoing typical lysosomal fusion. This fusion resulted in LDs accumulation and activated autophagy via the AMPK‐mTOR‐ULK1 signaling pathway. Subsequent in vivo experiments validated these in vitro findings and demonstrated that FLNs treatment alone promoted tumor cell growth and metastasis. However, inhibiting autophagy effectively suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in response to FLNs treatment. This dual effect of FLNs on colon tumor growth, mediated through autophagy, highlights their potential in future biomedical applications for cancer therapy. Furthermore, the study revealed a direct interaction between FLNs and the intracellular energy metabolism regulation mechanism of tumor cells via LDs. 2 Cellular Uptake of FLNs by Colon Cancer Cells via Clathrin‐ and Caveolae‐Mediated Pathways To explore the cellular effects of FLNs, spherical 3D lipid NPs were prepared using soybean oil and monoglyceride. The successful fabrication of the FLNs was confirmed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic laser scattering (DLS) ( Appendix S1 Given the ongoing controversy over whether food‐grade NPs can be absorbed in their intact form, we also investigated the internalization of FLNs ( Appendix S2 S3 Appendix S2 Appendix S3 Appendix S3 3 Appendix S4 3 Intracellular LDs Change upon FLNs Treatment Using TEM and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), we next showed that FLNs treatment significantly increases the number and average size of intracellular LDs in a time‐dependent manner ( Figure  1 Appendix S5 1C,D S1 Appendix S6 1C,D S2 Appendix S6 S7 1E Figure 1 FLNs induced changes in the intracellular LDs structure.

These vesicles are identified as autophagosomes by subsequent monodansylcadaverine (MDC) staining ( Appendix S8 −1 Appendix S9 Figure  2 Appendix S10 [  12  13 ] 2B S3 −1 Appendix S11 Appendix S11 −1 [  14  15 ] Figure 2 Changes in intracellular AMPK/mTOR/Class III PI3K/Beclin‐1/LC3 protein expression following FLNs treatment.

CON: Control group. * P P P P Interestingly, none of the individual components of FLNs induced an upregulation of autophagy, nor did they significantly promote cell proliferation ( Appendix S12 Appendix S13 It is well known that autophagy is involved in intracellular LDs metabolism. [  16 ] 1A–D 2A–H Appendix S14 Appendix S14A,D Appendix S15B,E Appendix S16 Based on these observations, we conclude that FLNs first induce an accumulation of LDs in the cytoplasm, which in turn triggers LDs‐targeted autophagy (lipophagy) to catabolize the excess LDs and maintain energy homeostasis. Simultaneously, this process upregulates the level of general autophagy. Furthermore, we explored the signaling pathway regulation mechanism of FLN‐induced autophagy. The AMP‐activated protein kinase (AMPK) involved signal pathway was analyzed first, as AMPK is well known to be a major regulator of lipid metabolism and plays a critical role in autophagy regulation. [  17  18  19 ] [  20  21  22  23 ] [  24 ] [  25  26  27  28 ] 2A–H 2A–H Appendix S17 To further verify the regulatory role of AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway in FLNs‐induced autophagy, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA, siAMPK) to specifically silence AMPK AMPK 2I–N In summary, our study demonstrates that FLNs treatment initially induces the accumulation of intracellular LDs, followed by the activation of AMPK. This activation subsequently leads to the inhibition of mTOR, thereby activating the autophagy promoter ULK1 and ultimately initiating the autophagy process. 5 FLNs Induce Mitochondrial Damage and Apoptosis When exploring the intracellular bioeffects of FLNs through TEM observation, it was found that some autophagosomes included mitochondria ( Appendix S18 Appendix S19 S20 Appendix S21 To further analyze the cause and the potential subsequent effects of mitochondrial damage, we tested intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), IL‐8, and Caspase‐3, as ROS can induce mitochondrial damage and subsequently trigger cell apoptosis. [  29 ] Appendix S22 [  30 ] Figure  3 Figure 3 FLNs induced apoptosis of cells after inhibition of autophagy.

CON: Control group; 3‐MA: 3‐MA treatment for 24 h. * P P P P In contrast, when autophagy was pre‐inhibited with an autophagy inhibitor (3‐MA), the administration of FLNs led to a subsequent increase in ROS, IL‐8, and Caspase‐3 levels ( Appendix S22 3A,C 3B,D [  31 ] The mechanism of FLNs‐induced apoptosis following autophagy inhibition was also verified. The findings of this study indicate that after autophagy inhibition, treatment with FLNs significantly increases the level of the pro‐apoptosis‐related protein Bax, while notably reducing the expression level of the anti‐apoptosis‐related protein Bcl‐2 (Figure 3E,F [  32 ] 6 FLNs Promote the Invasion and Migration of Colon Cancer Cells In addition to the bioeffects described above, we observed another intriguing phenomenon: FLNs were found to be enriched at the cell‐cell junctions ( Figure  4 4B Figure 4 Effect of FLNs on cell invasion, migration, and healing.

E) Effects of exosomes on angiogenesis in different treatment groups. White scale bars: 100 nm; Black scale bars: 50 µm. * P P P P Since intercellular junctions are closely related to cell mobility, we next assessed the effect of FLNs treatment on the invasion and migration of colon cancer cells by Transwell assay. After 48 h incubation, a significant increase in the number of invading cells was found in the FLNs‐treated group, yet such a change was not observed in 3‐MA‐pretreated cells (Figure 4C 4C 4D [  33 ] [  34 ] Moreover, we also evaluated another cancer‐related indicator: angiogenic ability. Exosomes from cells before and after FLNs treatment were collected and incubated with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Quantitative analysis demonstrated that exosomes derived from FLNs‐treated cells significantly enhanced angiogenic parameters by: (1) increasing total tube length by 1.3‐fold, (2) elevating branch points by 1.4‐fold, and (3) expanding mesh formation area by 1.5‐fold compared to control groups (Figure 4E; Appendix; Figure S23 4E Appendix S23 Appendix S24 −1 −1 Appendix S25 S26 The results obtained in this section highlight that food‐derived NPs may have a positive effect on tumor metastasis and growth, providing valuable insights for the scientific dietary management of cancer patients. 7 In Vivo Validation of the Effects of FLNs on Colon Tumor Xenograft mouse axillary subcutaneous tumor models were employed to confirm the effect of combined therapy using FLNs treatment and autophagy inhibition on tumor progression in vivo. As expected, following only three weeks of intratumoral injection with FLNs, there was a significant increase in tumor weight and volume. However, the combination treatment of FLNs with 3‐MA significantly reduced both the tumor weight and volume. The administration of 3‐MA alone does not significantly affect tumor size, and in vitro testing has confirmed that FLNs do not modify the cellular uptake of 3‐MA ( Figure  5 Appendix S27 5A–D Appendix S28 Appendix S29 Figure 5 Effect of FLNs on tumor proliferation, metastasis, and angiogenesis in vivo. Intratumoral injections were administered every other day with the following treatments: PBS (100 µL), FLNs (100 µL; 1 mg mL −1 −1 −1 −1 EGFR human GAPDH human E‐CADHERIN human P P P P Subsequent investigations revealed that FLNs prompted the intracellular accumulation of LDs (Figure 5E Appendix S30 5F 5D 5G,I Appendix S31 S32 Next, the effect of FLNs on tumor cell metastasis in vivo was investigated since our in vitro test showed an enhanced cell invasion and migration capability by FLNs treatment. The tumor cells were fluorescently labeled and tumor metastasis in mouse organs (liver, lung, kidney, and spleen) was evaluated by near‐infrared (NIR) imaging analysis. The results showed that FLNs significantly promoted metastasis to the lungs, and this was completely restrained by the combined use of 3‐MA (Figure 5H EGFR human GAPDH human, E‐CADHERIN human 5J HE staining was further utilized to verify metastasis through the bloodstream. Numerous tumor cells were detected in the vessels and tissues of the lungs in the FLNs‐treated group, whereas only a scant few cells were present in the lungs of the 3‐MA and 5‐FU‐treated groups. Practically no tumor cells were observed in the group treated with a combination of FLNs and 3‐MA ( Appendix S33 Moreover, the pathological observations indicated that the combined treatment of 3‐MA and FLNs did not cause significant damage to the lungs, liver, intestines, and spleen. Specifically, the lung tissue structure remained clear without obvious inflammation or fibrotic changes; the liver cells were neatly arranged without necrosis or steatosis; the intestinal mucosa remained intact with normal villus structure and no inflammatory infiltration; and the spleen also showed no significant pathological changes. In contrast, pathological section observation showed that 5‐FU treatment resulted in thickening of alveolar walls in the lungs, various degrees of necrosis in liver cells accompanied by inflammatory cell accumulation, damage to intestinal villus structure, and structural disorder of white and red pulp in the spleen ( Appendix S33–S36 8 Discussion and Conclusion The study on the cellular uptake and intracellular bioeffects of NPs in food is crucial to the clarification of their safety and potential functionalities in vivo. In this study, we found that FLNs can enter into the cells through different endocytosis pathways and caused three main bioeffects: i) fuse with intracellular LDs and leads to an increase in their number and size; ii) induce autophagy; and iii) loosen the intestinal cell adhesion junctions and promote cell migration and invasion. Similar results were also observed in the in vivo test. Among these effects, the changes in LDs induced by FLNs acted as a trigger for autophagy, which played a central role in regulating LDs metabolism and the growth behavior of tumor cells. We found that FLNs promoted tumor proliferation and metastasis. When autophagy was inhibited, FLNs significantly suppressed tumor proliferation and induced tumor cell apoptosis. This tumor suppression effect was comparable to 5‐FU, with fewer toxic side effects than 5‐FU. LDs are lipid‐rich organelles that regulate the intracellular lipid storage and metabolism. Recent studies have shown that LDs can form the first defensive barrier and act as a molecular switch in innate immunity, responding to danger signals by reprogramming cell metabolism and triggering protein‐mediated antimicrobial mechanisms. [  4  5  6  7  35 ] [  36 ] [  37 ] [  38 ] Autophagy is a fundamental degradation mechanism that affects lipid homeostasis in several different ways. [  39 ] Appendix S37 5 FLNs treatment reduces E‐cadherin expression, disrupting intercellular adherens junctions to promote in vitro cell migration/invasion and in vivo colon tumor metastasis. Crucially, autophagy activation mediates E‐cadherin degradation, and autophagy inhibition fully reverses FLNs‐induced migratory, invasive, and angiogenic effects. [  40  41 ] [  42  43  44 ] [  45 ] [  46  47 ] In conclusion, our findings offer valuable insights into food‐body interactions, suggesting guidelines for dietary lipid ingestion in healthy and cancer populations. They also highlight the need to reassess the safety of NPs in food. Furthermore, combining FLNs with autophagy inhibitors may offer a promising anti‐tumor strategy with low side effects. Given the tumor‐targeting capability of FLNs, [  48 ] [  49 ] 4A,B Appendix S2 9 Experimental Section Human colon cancer cells HT‐29 and Caco‐2 were purchased from Procell Life Science & Technology Co.
