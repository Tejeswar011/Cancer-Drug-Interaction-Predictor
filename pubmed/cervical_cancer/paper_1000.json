Highlights • Constructed ACTA2-based clinical scoring model for COAD prognosis. • ACTA2 downregulated in COAD tissues but high expression linked to poor survival. • WGCNA revealed ACTA2-associated biological processes in COAD. • ACTA2 correlates with immune infiltration, checkpoints, and tertiary lymphoid markers. • Negative correlation between ACTA2 methylation and transcriptional levels confirmed. This study aimed to construct and validate a clinical scoring model for colorectal adenocarcinoma (COAD) based on ACTA2 to identify novel biomarkers. COAD-related data were obtained from the TCGA database, and the expression of ACTA2 was verified by in vitro experiments. WGCNA analysis was used to explore the biological processes associated with ACTA2. The results showed that ACTA2 was downregulated in COAD tissues, but its high expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients. ACTA2 was closely related to immune cell infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, and tertiary lymphoid structure marker genes. In addition, there was a negative correlation between the methylation level and transcriptional level of ACTA2. The ACTA2-based clinical scoring model constructed in this study may serve as a novel biomarker for COAD, providing new insights for improving patient prognosis.

Global cancer statistics from 2020 report that CRC ranks fifth among the most common cancers worldwide, with an estimated 11.48 million new cases and 578,000 deaths reported annually. These numbers account for 6.0 % of the total new cases and deaths from malignant tumors [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Research has shown that the proliferation of fibrous tissue, often leads to an increase in alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). Additionally, α-SMA is also essential for cancer metastasis [ 7 8 Therefore, this study used bioinformatics methods to analyze the expression levels and functions of ACTA2 and its related genes and differentially expressed genes in COAD. We also investigated the expression levels of ACTA2 at the mRNA and protein levels through Real Time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and Western blot experiments. Additionally, we predicted the immune cell infiltration and upstream regulators of the clinical scoring model based on ACTA2. Finally, we constructed a multi-omics landscape for the model based on multi-omics data. Materials and methods data Data resources and preprocessing The expression profiles and relevant clinical information data of COAD were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA, https://www.cancer.gov/ 9 10 11 RT-qPCR We used the (FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation Kit V2) (Vazyme) to extract total RNA from the tissue, and the NanoDrop™ One/OneC micro UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to measure the RNA concentration by OD value. The reverse transcription was performed using HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR (+gDNA wiper) (Vazyme) under the conditions of 37 °C for 15 min and 85 °C for 5 s. α-Tublin was chosen as the reference gene. ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme) was used for qPCR, and the samples were mixed and detected using the QuantStudio 6 Flex real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the following thermal cycling conditions: 95 °C for 30 s; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C for 30 s; and 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 95 °C for 15 s. The primers (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai) were designed as follows: α-Tublin 5′-TGTTGGTCAGGCTGGTGTCC-3′ and 5′-TGAAGAAGGTGTTGAACGAGTCATC-3′; ACTA2 5′-AGAAGAGTTACGAGTTGCCTGATGG-3′ and 5′-GCTGTTGTAGGTGGTTTCATGGATG-3′. The relative gene expression level was calculated using the 2 ^-ΔΔCt Differential protein expression analysis of ACTA2 We obtained the immunohistochemistry atlas of ACTA2 from the Human Protein Atlas ( https://v15.proteinatlas.org/ 12 Western blot The cells isolated from tissue samples were washed with PBS and lysed on ice with a mixture of PIPA+PMSF (Beyotime). The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and the supernatant was combined with Protein Sample Loading Buffer (epizyme) and heated at 95 °C in a metal bath for 10 min. The protein concentration of each sample was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Biosharp). The protein samples were separated in a 10 % SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a 0.2 µm PVDF membrane (Merck). After blocking with skimmed milk powder (Biosharp) at room temperature for 1 hour, the PVDF membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with Mouse anti-α-SMA (YM3364, Immunway) and Mouse anti-α-Tublin (RM2007, Beijing Ray Antibody Biotech) antibodies. The membrane was washed 6 times with TBST (Boster Bio), then incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with the secondary antibody Goat anti-Mouse IgG ( H L Analysis of the diagnostic and prognostic potential of ACTA2 in COAD To explore the diagnostic potential of ACTA2 as a biomarker for COAD, we conducted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis using the pROC package [ 13 14 Differentially expressed gene analysis We conducted differential analysis using the limma package to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) between the COAD and control groups, as well as between the high-expression and low-expression groups of ACTA2 [ 10 Weighted gene co-expression network analysis We conducted a co-expression network analysis using the WGCNA package [ 15 Functional enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment analysis We performed gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis using the clusterProfiler package [ 16 17 18 Construction and validation of a clinical scoring model based on ACTA2 We utilized the most significantly positively correlated module genes of ACTA2 for survival analysis. Subsequently, we selected the top 50 genes that were significantly associated with COAD prognosis and ACTA2 as scoring gene. Subsequently, scoring gene analysis was performed using univariate and multivariate Cox regression. After that, we obtained a ACTA2-based scoring model. Furthermore, we further explored the relationship between the ACTA2 prognostic scoring genes and clinical indicators such as OS, RFS, stage, grade, gender, age, and constructed a clinical indicator model based on ACTA2. In order to examine the semantic similarity of genes in the ACTA2 scoring model, we utilized the GOSemSim software package [ 19 Immune cell infiltration analysis of acta2-based clinical scoring genes The CIBERSORT tool [ 20 Identification of upstream regulators of the ACTA2-based clinical scoring gene set The hypergeometric test method was employed to identify the upstream regulators that govern the ACTA2-based scoring model gene set, which includes long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), transcription factors (TFs), and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Additionally, the regulatory impacts of the identified upstream regulators on the expression of the scoring genes of interest were investigated. For the selected transcription factors, HADDOCK software was used to calculate their binding affinity to downstream gene DNA. Protein three-dimensional structures were obtained from the PDB database ( https://www.uniprot.org/ https://scfbio-iitd.res.in/software/drugdesign/bdna.jsp# Construction of multi-omics landscapes based on the ACTA2-based clinical scoring gene regulatory network The maftools software package in R language was used to visualize the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the genes in the ACTA2-based scoring model in COAD. Subsequently, copy number variation (CNV) plots of these genes were generated. Finally, we explored the relationship between methylation modification levels and transcript levels of acta2-based clinical scoring genes by correlation analysis.

Fig. 8 Discussion COAD is a challenging malignant tumour to treat, presenting with subtle early symptoms, high recurrence and metastasis rates post-surgery, and considerable mortality rates in advanced stages. In recent times, clinicians have focused on differential gene expression in tumour tissue and their potential applications in clinical settings [ 21 Our results showed that the overall expression level of ACTA2 in COAD tissues was lower than that in paracancerous tissues. However, survival analysis showed that in the COAD patient population, high ACTA2 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis. This apparent contradiction may be due to the differences in the analysis objects and comparison methods: the expression analysis was based on the comparison of paracancerous tissues with the whole COAD samples, while the survival analysis was performed within the COAD samples according to the high and low ACTA2 groups. Studies have shown that α-SMA-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) can promote the invasion of cancer cells, and in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients, the expression level of α-SMA is closely related to advanced tumor stage, invasive growth and tumor budding [ 22 Smooth muscle cell contract to perform many physiological functions, such as regulation of blood flow and pressure in arteries, pupil constriction, intestinal motility, and bladder voiding [ 8 23 24 25 26 In this study, we assessed the turquoise module that displayed the most significant positive correlation with ACTA2. We then constructed a clinical model that relied on ACTA2 for scoring. We examined clinical and pathological characteristics of samples from various groups and predicted the correlation between levels of immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint analysis. Combined with existing research, it is hypothesised that mature stromal fibrosis is associated with reduced ACTA2 expression and smaller spindle-shaped myofibroblast-like cells, while the ACTA2 high expression in the immature stromal fibrosis group is accompanied by large and plump myofibroblast-like cells that resemble scar tissue. These cells may promote cancer infiltration and lead to a poor prognosis [ 22 27 We found that ACTA2 was significantly negatively correlated with Tfh cells. Tfh cells primarily exert their anti-tumor effects by assisting B cells in producing anti-tumor antibodies and enhancing humoral immunity [ 28 29 Subsequently, we investigated the upstream regulatory factors of the clinical indicator gene set, which is based on ACTA2, including lncRNAs, RBPs and TFs. It has been demonstrated that the expression levels of lncRNA, such as POLR2A, have a close association with their gene copy number in COAD. These findings suggest that inhibiting POLR2A could be a novel therapeutic strategy for human cancers with this common genomic alteration [ 30 31 32 Finally, we analysed the somatic mutation status of the ACTA2-based clinical scoring genes and presented the landscape of SNPs mutations. Our study revealed that LTBP2, COL18A1, and NOTCH3 had higher mutation frequencies in COAD within the ACTA2-based clinical scoring genes. Moreover, LTBP2 has been validated as a potential oncogene in the progression of COAD, which has significant implications for predicting prognosis [ 33 34 35 In brief, we created and verified a novel clinical scoring model for forecasting COAD patients' prognosis, offering fresh avenues for COAD therapy. The ACTA2-based scoring clinical model may serve as a useful tool for guiding clinical treatment of COAD and promoting personalized therapy. However, this study has limitations, and additional in vitro and in vivo experiments are necessary to validate the accuracy of the clinical model based on ACTA2 scoring.
