Herein, we investigate how mitochondrial dynamics, which control mitochondrial fitness via coordinated fission and fusion events, shape MM cell metabolism impacting growth, survival and drug sensitivity. We identify mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), a pivotal driver of mitochondrial fragmentation, as being highly expressed in MM plasma cells bearing cytogenetic abnormalities predicting poor clinical outcome. In preclinical models, selective inhibition of MFF via multiple RNA-based strategies (short-hairpin RNA, short-interfering RNA or LNA gapmeR antisense oligonucleotides) reduces MM cell growth both in vitro in vivo Funding This research was supported by a grant from the Italian Association for Cancer Research (IG24449) to NA, and partially by the PRIN PNRR (code: P2022THN5N; CUP: F53D23012310001) to NA, and the PNRR CN00000041 “Sviluppo di terapia genica e farmaci con tecnologia a RNA” to MEGC, GV and NA. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Frequently recognized as the powerhouse of the cell, mitochondria are vital organelles that regulate critical biological processes, including energy production, cellular metabolism and cell death. 1 2 3 4 5 In cancer, the elevated nutrient demands of proliferating cells are mainly fulfilled through drastic changes in energetic metabolism, in turn supported by variation in mitochondrial function and shape. 6 7-1 1 12-14 Mitochondrial fission factor (MFF) is an integral membrane protein of the outer mitochondrial membrane, which serves as the main molecular mediator regulating mitochondrial fragmentation. 15 16 17 18 19-21 4 Methods Cell culture and drugs Detailed information regarding the cell cultures and drugs used in this study is provided in the Online Supplementary Methods Transmission electron microscopy Samples were processed for ultrastructural transmission electron microscopy analysis according to standard protocols. 22 23 Online Supplementary Methods RNA-sequencing of multiple myeloma patients’ samples Multi-omics data about bone marrow MM samples at baseline (BM_1) were publicly accessible from the MMRF CoMMpass study ( https://research.themmrf.org/ Online Supplementary Methods RNA-sequencing, differential gene expression and pathway analyses Detailed information about RNA-sequencing, differential gene expression and pathway analyses is provided in the Online Supplementary Methods Virus generation and transduction of multiple myeloma cells The plasmids used and the related protocols are described in the Online Supplementary Methods Transient transfection of multiple myeloma cells MM cells were transfected by electroporation using the Neon Transfection System (Invitrogen, CA, USA), according to previously established protocols. 24 Online Supplementary Methods Cell viability, clonogenicity assays and cell cycle analysis Details of the cell viability studies, clonogenicity assays and cell cycle analysis are presented in the Online Supplementary Methods Measurements of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential Detailed information regarding the measurements of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial membrane potential is supplied in the Online Supplementary Methods Measurement of oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were quantified using a Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer (XFe96, Agilent Technologies).

Interestingly, higher MFF gene expression was observed in patients harboring genomic alterations associated with poor prognosis, such as 1q amplification, 1p deletion, del(13), del(17), DIS3 mutation, t(4;14) translocation, and non-hyperdiploid status ( Figure 1A Online Supplementary Figure S1A data not shown Figure 1B Consistent with the role of MFF as a Drp1 partner in mitochondrial fragmentation, 16 17 25 Figure 1C Online Supplementary Figure S1B Given that MFF is a key regulator of mitochondrial fragmentation in various cellular contexts, we next investigated whether MFF-targeted inhibition could affect mitochondrial morphology in MM cells. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed a significant accumulation of elongated mitochondria following MFF knockdown (KD) ( Figure 1D Mitochondrial fission factor targeting halts in vitro in vivo Mitochondrial dynamics regulate biological processes relevant to the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis, affecting cell growth and proliferation. 26 Online Supplementary Figure S2A, B Figure 2A Online Supplementary Figure S2C Figure 2B Figure 2C Online Supplementary Figure S2D Figure 2E Figure 2F Online Supplementary Figure S2E Online Supplementary Figure S2F Online Supplementary Figure S2G Figure 1.

After confirming MFF protein overexpression ( Online Supplementary Figure S3A vice versa Figure 3A We hypothesized that the differential modulation of the pathways regulated by such genes, which displayed opposing trends between the two experimental conditions (OE and shMFF), could unveil MFF function in MM. To address this point, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) comparing each condition to its corresponding control. Upon analyzing the GSEA results from shMFF or OE MFF cells, we observed five top deregulated processes exhibiting opposite patterns ( Figure 3B Online Supplementary Figure S3B Online Supplementary Figure S3C in vitro Figure 3C in vivo Online Supplementary Figure S3D Mitochondrial fission factor-dependent metabolic reprogramming of multiple myeloma cells is mediated by intracellular lactate accumulation To directly correlate the MFF-associated transcriptomic changes reported above to the metabolic phenotype, we performed metabolic analyses using high-resolution respirometry (Oroboros) and/or Seahorse analysis on MM cells after knockdown or overexpression of MFF. High-resolution respirometry showed that MFF overexpression caused a significant increase in OXPHOS, as evidenced by enhanced basal and maximal respiration rates compared to those of control cells. Specifically, the increased maximal respiration following injection of FCCP, a mitochondrial uncoupler, indicated an elevated mitochondrial capacity, improved electron transport chain efficiency, and greater oxygen consumption during cellular respiration, reflecting the enhanced ability of mitochondria to produce ATP ( Figure 4A Online Supplementary Figure S4A Figure 3. Mitochondrial fission factor targeting prompts a shift towards glycolytic metabolism. P MFF targeting, on the other hand, led to a reduction in both basal and maximal respiration in MM cells (Figure 4B; Online Supplementary Figure S4B Online Supplementary Figure S4C Figure 4C Figure 4D Online Supplementary Figure S4D, E Figure 4E in vitro in vivo Online Supplementary Figure S4F Online Supplementary Figure S4G Previous studies have indicated that excessive lactate can drive OXPHOS while suppressing glucose fermentation. 27 28 Figure 4G Figure 4.

As shown in Figure 5E Figure 5F Figure 5G 32 Figure 5H Figure 5J Overall, these data indicate that targeting mitochondrial fission can enhance the efficacy of lactate transporter inhibitors in MM, with a safe toxicity profile in vitro Mitochondrial fission factor promotes bortezomib resistance of multiple myeloma cells Recent reports have highlighted the capability of lactate to ignite MM cell resistance to proteasome inhibitors (PI). 33 Figure 6A Figure 6B in vitro Figure 6D As both AZD3965 and syrosingopine promote MFF expression, likely as an adaptive mechanism to cope with lactate overload, we tested whether these two drugs could affect bortezomib anti-MM activity in vitro Figure 6E Online Supplementary Figure S6 Figure 6F in vitro Discussion MM is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by a complex array of clinical manifestations, including hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, and bone lesions (collectively referred to as CRAB symptoms); the disease also presents a wide spectrum of clinical variants, ranging from benign monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering/indolent MM to more aggressive forms, such as overt MM and plasma cell leukemia. 34 Mitochondria are vital organelles often referred to as the powerhouse of the cell; as such, they regulate critical cellular processes, including energy production, cellular metabolism, and apoptosis. 1 4 35 36 37 Figure 5. Targeting of mitochondrial fission enhances the in vitro P P P P P P P P P Over the last decade, it has become evident that the tight regulation of mitochondrial morphology, carried out by the mitochondrial dynamics rheostat, is mandatory for regulating cellular homeostasis and survival, and its disruption or imbalance can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction which, in turn, promotes a wide range of diseases, including cancer. 38 7-1 1 12 13 39 Although deregulated mitochondrial fission is emerging in cancer and is starting to be linked to MM pathobiology, 13 14 16 15 40 Overexpression of MFF has been reported in non-small cell lung, 19 41 42 43 44 20 45 Consistent with a general collapse of mitochondrial integrity, the induction of mitochondrial elongation via multiple MFF targeting strategies (siRNA, shRNA or ASO) delivered preclinical anticancer activity, as indicated by inhibition of MM proliferation, blockade of the cell cycle, suppression of colony formation and impaired growth in mice. Overall, these data point to MFF as a novel potential therapeutic target in MM. Transcriptomic analyses were carried out to assess the molecular perturbations produced by MFF targeting and revealed that mitochondrial fission blockade is associated with substantial alterations in metabolic pathways, consistent with the inhibition of mitochondrial OXPHOS and a shift toward glycolysis. This was validated by high resolution respirometry and Seahorse measurement of metabolic fluxes. Intriguingly, this glycolytic signature was associated with a decrease in intracellular lactate, highlighting the broad and still not fully understood metabolic plasticity of MM. For a long time considered a metabolic waste product, it is now acknowledged that lactate can act as fuel for oxidative phosphorylation; 46 We also explored whether the adaptive metabolic responses induced by MFF targeting could be leveraged for therapeutic purposes. To this end, we employed two drugs, AZD3965 and syrosingopine, both known to promote lactate accumulation via MCT4 or MCT1/4 inhibition, respectively. Notably, the excessive intracellular lactate produced by both compounds resulted in MFF upregulation and stronger anti-MM activity when MFF, or its partner Drp1, was inhibited; conversely, no cytotoxic effects were observed in healthy cells. These data suggest that lactate overload, which can no longer support growth-promoting OXPHOS when mitochondrial fission is impaired, leads to MM cell death. This provides the first preclinical rationale for exploiting therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondrial fission to enhance the limited single-agent activity of drugs inhibiting MCT1 and/or MCT4 transporters, both of which are overexpressed and predict poor survival in MM. 33 47 The proteasomal machinery, i.e., the most relevant therapeutic target in MM, is involved in the regulation of cellular metabolism. 36 48 36 48 49 33 in vivo Figure 6. Mitochondrial fission factor triggers resistance to proteasome inhibitors via a lactate-dependent pathway. P P P P P P In conclusion, the data presented highlight novel aberrations in mitochondrial dynamics that underlie the metabolic adaptability of MM cells, providing a compelling framework for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches to treat MM and potentially other cancers characterized by elevated mitochondrial fission.
