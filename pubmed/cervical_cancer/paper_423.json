Yet, the mechanisms by which\nmicroglia can drive neurodegeneration remain unresolved. Here we discover that a\nconserved stress signaling pathway, the integrated stress response (ISR),\ncharacterizes a microglia subset with neurodegenerative outcomes. Autonomous\nactivation of ISR in microglia is sufficient to induce early features of the\nultrastructurally distinct “dark microglia” linked to pathological\nsynapse loss. In AD models, microglial ISR activation exacerbates\nneurodegenerative pathologies and synapse loss while its inhibition ameliorates\nthem. Mechanistically, we present evidence that ISR activation promotes the\nsecretion of toxic lipids by microglia, impairing neuron homeostasis and\nsurvival in vitro. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of ISR or lipid\nsynthesis mitigates synapse loss in AD models. Our results demonstrate that\nmicroglial ISR activation represents a neurodegenerative phenotype, which may be\nsustained, at least in part, by the secretion of toxic lipids.
