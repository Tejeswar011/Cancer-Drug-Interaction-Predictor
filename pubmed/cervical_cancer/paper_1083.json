For women, these include cervical cytobrushes, cervicovaginal swabs, cervicovaginal lavage (CVL), first-void urine (FVU), menstrual cups, sponges, filter paper strips, and aspirate samples. 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 28 29 , 30 , 31 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 Hence, the objective of this review is to give a comprehensive overview of local mucosal immune biomarkers associated with CT infection and explore their association with systemic immune responses. Identified prognostic biomarkers may support future vaccine monitoring studies, since a correlate of protection is unknown. This review will discuss methods used for sampling the local urogenital environment with regard to identification of those biomarkers and outline potential confounding factors influencing the detection and quantification of CT-associated immune responses. Finally, different immunoassays used for monitoring local immune responses will be discussed. Results Study selection and characteristics A total of 5,968 records were identified through database searches conducted in October 2023 ( Figure 1 Figure 1 PRISMA flow diagram of the literature search Records were identified through three databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus). After duplicate removal, records were screened by title and abstract and excluded if they did not match the inclusion criteria. Articles were then retrieved for full-text screening and included if they matched inclusion criteria. Reference lists of included articles were manually screened for further records that were not yet included through database search and screened based on title and abstract. Full texts were included when appropriate. Of the 145 included publications, 85 reported on the detection of CT immune responses in female urogenital secretions, 54 in male urogenital secretions, and six included both male and female participants.

Studies including both female and male participants were included in both proportions. (B) Overview of different immunoassays used for measuring antigen-specific cellular immune responses in female urogenital secretions. Functional antibody assays were performed in two studies, both focusing on female cervicovaginal secretions. The first study examined the inhibitory effects on inclusion formation using direct immunofluorescence-based staining of inclusion bodies. The study concluded that secretions of women with positive endocervical culture results exhibited higher anti-chlamydial activity compared with secretions of culture-negative women. 117 36 Association between local and serum antibody levels In this review, we identified eight studies that investigated associations between local and serum antibody levels.

Some studies additionally collected whole blood, serum, or plasma to determine cytokine concentrations. Flow cytometry data have demonstrated distinct differences between local and systemic cellular immune phenotypes. As expected, lymphocyte counts are lower in cytobrush samples compared with cervical biopsies and peripheral blood. 63 + + + 47 , 64 + + + 64 , 65 , 66 + 65 + + 64 , 66 64 , 66 47 , 54 , 64 , 66 Chlamydia- 41 , 42 42 66 When comparing lymphoproliferative responses of cervical lymphocytes and PBMCs after stimulation with cHsp and MOMP peptides, no significant differences between stimulation indices were observed, 39 44 68 45 68 113 , 179 Only two studies used data from both mucosal and systemic assays to calculate correlations. Neither study found significant correlations between cervicovaginal and systemic cytokine concentrations. 38 , 113 Factors influencing the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis Besides sample type and immunoassay, we identified several host-pathogen factors that can influence the immune response measured during chlamydial infection. An overview of the major contributing factors is shown in Figure 4 Table 3 Table S6 Figure 4 Different factors influencing mucosal immune responses to urogenital CT infections Overview of different factors affecting measured mucosal immune responses to urogenital C. trachomatis Table 1 Table 3 Influencing factors taken into account in different papers Influencing factor N° of papers (% of total) Coinfections (tested or self-reported) 109 (75.2% a • N • 28/68 investigated effect of other infections on outcome parameters. • Effects on immune biomarkers in coinfected participants compared with monoinfection were investigated in 9 papers.

Although several studies investigated the independent effects of CT and other STIs on immune biomarkers, only nine explored the combined effects of coinfections compared with participants infected with CT alone. Interestingly, not all studies reported a significant impact of coinfections for each individual pathogen. 48 , 57 , 122 , 173 Neisseria gonorrhea 52 , 126 , 133 , 156 Chlamydia 136 52 , 55 , 59 , 73 Proteus Chlamydia 154 56 , 64 , 103 , 172 When collecting female urogenital samples, hormonal influences can be considered by measuring serum hormone levels or taking into account the menstrual cycle. Serum hormones may affect local immune cells present and cytokine concentrations measured. 38 , 41 , 177 77 Multiple studies independently demonstrate that patients with recurrent or persistent infections, as well as those with fertility disorders, exhibit distinct differences in mucosal cytokine concentrations or mRNA expression. 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 43 , 56 , 90 , 93 , 94 , 104 50 , 61 , 69 + 41 , 43 , 61 39 Chlamydia 39 , 40 , 43 , 50 , 78 , 79 , 82 , 83 , 105 , 144 , 154 62 61 Host genetics can also influence immune responses, as shown by Wang et al., who identified two HLA IL10 91 42 , 43 , 94 89 , 116 187 , 188 , 189 , 190 , 191 ompA 36 Discussion Comprehensively, there has been growing scientific interest in investigating local mucosal immune responses rather than systemic responses. However, sampling the local environment presents several challenges, and differences between anatomical compartments and sample types should be considered in trial design. For example, proportional cell counts can differ between sample types. 54 , 192 , 193 193 192 , 193 192 49 Figure 5 21 , 37 , 194 Table 4 214 , 215 , 216 , 217 , 218 , 219 , 220 19 , 204 , 221 Figure 5 Measurement of urogenital interferon-γ concentration depends on infection status, immunoassay choice, and sample type Median IFN-γ concentrations (unless indicated as mean) in picograms per milliliter in different urogenital secretions retrieved from different studies (one data point indicates one population in a certain study).

Despite sampling challenges, researchers have demonstrated that CD69 and CD103 expressions are significantly higher in female reproductive tract tissues compared with blood, indicating the presence of cells with a TRM phenotype, even in a healthy population. 193 + 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 126 + + 222 Figure 5 223 , 224 , 225 , 226 Nine studies investigating antigen-specific cellular responses were included in this review. Despite ELISpot being considered a highly sensitive, standardizable method for use with PBMCs, only two of the nine studies employed this technique. 186 227 , 228 229 , 230 , 231 15 , 232 44 , 61 233 39 , 44 , 45 , 50 , 60 , 61 , 62 , 68 69 234 , 235 , 236 , 237 , 238 + 239 , 240 , 241 , 242 , 243 , 244 , 245 , 246 , 247 , 248 38 , 113 Several assays are available for detecting anti-CT serum antibodies. 182 182 Chlamydia 182 249 182 250 , 251 , 252 , 253 254 , 255 256 , 257 120 , 258 , 259 141 , 260 , 261 Chlamydia pneumoniae 182 , 262 The role of antibody-mediated immune responses in human Chlamydia 89 263 , 264 262 , 265 , 266 , 267 , 268 266 36 89 , 120 105 Several factors are known to influence immune responses to CT infection. One of the most critical is the microbiome. Urogenital CT strains can utilize a specific enzyme to convert indole (produced by, e.g., Prevotella 225 , 269 270 , 271 , 272 264 , 273 , 274 274 , 275 , 276 , 277 , 278 279 , 280 36 , 42 , 43 , 89 , 94 , 116 , 187 , 188 , 189 , 190 32 , 274 , 281 , 282 , 283 , 284 Future directions As urogenital sampling for detection of mucosal immune biomarkers has gained increasing interest, we propose several aspects that should be considered and optimized for future research in this field. First, we suggest that sample collection and processing be standardized across research groups to enable meaningful comparisons. Therefore, it is important to disclose detailed information regarding sample collection, processing, and dilution. Furthermore, protocols for isolation of cervical mononuclear cells should be harmonized, whereas protocols for isolation of male urogenital mononuclear cells still need to be developed. Uniform collection methods for measurement of local antibodies should also be agreed upon, with normalization for differences in sample volumes and dilution factors. Second, we believe that consensus regarding “gold-standard” assays and antigens for both humoral and cellular immune responses is essential. For validating assays that measure humoral immune responses, a reference standard using either antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies or a serum standard should be available. 214 Limitations of the study Despite these interesting findings, it is important to acknowledge potential limitations in our study. This review did not consider clinical endpoints associated with proposed immunological endpoints, even though they are essential for defining a correlate of protection. However, we did highlight the effect of fertility disorders and urogenital symptoms as factors that can influence mucosal CT immunity. We did not investigate the effect of other confounding factors including demographic background or immune-related comorbidities. The data collected are highly variable regarding population characteristics, sample type and processing, specific biomarkers assessed, and detection methods. Therefore, a meta-analysis was unfortunately not feasible. Yet, the data are presented in a systematic way, and an overview is provided to allow comparison between the studies.
