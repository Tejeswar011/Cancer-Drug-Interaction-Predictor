This study is the first to systematically investigate the function of DHCR24 in OC and elucidate its mechanism in promoting OC progression, providing novel theoretical insights for targeted therapy. Methods The expression of DHCR24 was evaluated in tissues using bioinformatics and clinical data; the impact of DHCR24 on the malignant behavior of OC was assessed through in vivo in vitro t Results Database, clinical data, and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses demonstrated that DHCR24 is upregulated in OC and correlates with poor outcomes. In vitro in vivo Conclusion DHCR24 contributes to ovarian cancer progression by upregulating the TGF-β1 pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. 3β-hydroxysterol Δ24-reductase (DHCR24) metastasis ovarian cancer (OC) proliferation transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1 Introduction Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the three major gynecological cancers and has the highest mortality rate in the group [ 1 2 3 4 6 3β-hydroxysterol Δ24-reductase (DHCR24), also known as seladin-1, is primarily localized on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane [ 7 8 9 10 11 8 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 21 22 24 Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is one of the growth factors that constitute the TGF-β superfamily, with TGF-β1 being the most frequently expressed and widely studied homotype [ 25 26 27 28 29 30 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Database Analysis Gene expression analysis of DHCR24 in OC tissues versus normal ovarian epithelial tissues was performed using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA 2) ( http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn p https://kmplot.com/analysis/, p 2.2 Tissues In this study, paraffin sections of 70 cases of OC were examined. In addition, fresh human normal ovarian and OC tissue specimens (16 each) were collected and stored in liquid nitrogen for follow-up experiments. Patient details can be found in Table S1. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (approval number: 2024-006-02). Informed consent has been obtained from all patients. 2.3 Cell Culture Normal ovarian epithelial cells IOSE-80 (RRID: CVCL_5546) were purchased from Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co., Ltd.

OC cells A2780 (RRID: CVCL_0134) were purchased from Servicebio Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China). All cell lines were authenticated by STR profiling and confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination. All cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium (Procell, Wuhan, China) at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 2.4 RNA Extraction and Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Total RNA was extracted from the aforementioned tissues and cells using Trizol (Cat.

The next day, secondary antibody incubation (diluted in Tris-Buffered Saline with Tween-20) was performed at room temperature for 1 h. Finally, an ultrasensitive chemiluminescence kit (Cat. No. BL520A, Biosharp, Anhui, China) was used to visualize the proteins. Antibody data are presented in Table S3. All experiments were independently repeated three times. 2.6 Lentiviral Infection The cells (SKOV3, CAOV3, ES2, and A2780) were seeded (1 × 10 5 2.7 Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) Assay Cells (3 × 10 3 2.8 Colony Formation Assay Cells (SKOV3, CAOV3, ES2 and A2780) were evenly seeded (4 × 10 2 2.9 Transwell Migration and Invasion Assays For the migration assay, SKOV3 and ES2 cells (2 × 10 4 4 2.10 Wound Healing Assay Cells (SKOV3 and CAOV3) were seeded (5 × 10 5 2.11 Flow Cytometry Assay Cells (SKOV3, CAOV3, ES2, and A2780) were seeded (5 × 10 5 2.12 Subcutaneous Tumor Model in Mice Twenty-two BALB/c nude mice were purchased from Changzhou Cavins Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Changzhou, China). The mice were housed in an AAALAC-accredited facility with controlled temperature (23 ± 1°C), humidity (50 ± 10%), and a 12-h light/dark cycle, with a 1-week acclimation period. A total of 10 mice were randomly divided into 2 groups (5 mice per group) and subcutaneously injected with OC cells (SKOV3/shNC and SKOV3/sh1, 5 × 10 6 6 Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Chongqing Medical University (approval number: IACUC-CQMU-2024-0705). The study was reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. 2.13 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) The tissue sections were baked at 60°C. Sodium citrate solution was used for antigen repair. Subsequently, the tissue sections were subjected to a blocking solution and incubated with the primary antibody. A diaminobenzidine (20x) chromogenic solution (Cat. No. ZLI-9018, ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) was applied. Nuclei were stained with hematoxylin (Cat. No. G1004, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Information regarding the antibodies that were used is provided in Table S5. 2.14 RNA Sequencing Transcriptome sequencing was conducted by Seqhealth Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China) using a NovaSeq 6000 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Differentially expressed genes between groups were identified using the ‘edgeR’ package (version 3.42.0) in R 4.3.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria), with screening criteria of |logFC| > 1 and adjusted p p 33 34 2.15 Rescue Experiment SKOV3 cells were treated with TGF-β1 (Cat.

SKOV3 and ES2 cells were treated with the DHCR24 inhibitor SH-42 (Cat. No. HY-143228, MCE, NJ, USA). Functional assays were performed after 48 h, and total cellular proteins were extracted for Western blot at 72 h. Relevant experimental details can be found in the corresponding methods section. SB431542 and SH-42 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a concentration of 10 μM, and TGF-β1 was dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2–7.4) containing bovine serum albumin (BSA) to a concentration of 10 ng/mL. 2.16 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis and graph plotting were performed using SPSS 25.0 and GraphPad Prism 8.0 software, while image processing was conducted with Fiji software.

Because of the extensive cross-talk between the TGF-β1 pathway and other signaling pathways, TGF-β1 inhibitors may activate other pro-tumor signaling pathways, thereby reducing their therapeutic efficacy [ 50 55 This study has certain limitations. As the availability of clinical samples and pathological data is limited, future studies will aim to expand the clinical cohort, increase the sample size in mouse experiments, and collect additional pathological data to strengthen the findings on the correlation between DHCR24 expression and OC prognosis, while enhancing the credibility of our research conclusions. Furthermore, studies incorporating in vivo 5 Conclusions The OC malignancy-promoting effect of DHCR24 correlates with the TGF-β pathway. Our findings suggest that DHCR24 facilitates the development of OC, and its inhibition is likely to be a therapeutic strategy for OC. Supplementary Materials Not applicable.
