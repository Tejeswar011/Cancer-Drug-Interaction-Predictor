However, studies evaluating surveillance patterns often cannot distinguish between imaging ordered for surveillance versus for symptoms suggestive of recurrence. Moreover, early recurrences and other competing events hamper efforts to determine true surveillance rates because of wide variability in reported guideline adherence in clinical practice. Leveraging comprehensive Veterans Health Administration data, we developed a novel competing risks framework to describe the patterns and predictors of NSCLC imaging surveillance. Objective This study aims to examine posttreatment surveillance to estimate the true surveillance rates and predictors of guideline-concordant care in patients with early-stage NSCLC. Methods The study cohort comprised veterans who were treated for stage 1 to 3 NSCLC between 2008 and 2016 and who survived for ≥6 months. Clinical documents and radiology reports were abstracted for image indication and clinical information. We estimated the cumulative probability of receiving guideline-concordant surveillance, defined as chest computed tomography imaging within 4 to 9 months after treatment, accounting for competing risks and censoring. Multivariable cause-specific Cox regression was used to estimate associations between patient factors and guideline-concordant surveillance, with adjustments made for multiple comparisons. Results The cohort consisted of 1888 patients. The mean age of the analysis cohort was 66.4 (SD 7.9) years; 95.9% (1811/1888) of the patients were male, 71.1% (1342/1888) of the patients were White, and 43.1% (814/1888) were married. Of the 1888 patients, 57% (n=1076) presented with stage 1 disease, and the most common treatment modality was surgery alone (n=1068, 56.6%). The most common type of imaging performed during the initial 120- to 270-day window was chest computed tomography (1460/3278, 44.5%). Chest X-rays accounted for 36.3% (1190/3278) of all imaging performed, while the remaining 11.8% (386/3278) and 7.4% (242/3278) were positron emission tomography scans or other imaging modalities, respectively. Compared to the years 2008 to 2010, patients treated for NSCLC from 2014 to 2016 had a significantly higher likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant surveillance (hazard ratio 1.42, P Conclusions In this unique application of a competing risks framework, the rate of guideline-concordant surveillance in this national cohort was lower than that reported in many previous studies. This finding highlights a potentially substantial gap in surveillance among eligible, asymptomatic lung cancer survivors. More strategies are needed to measure the true rate of guideline-concordant surveillance, along with education and advocacy to ensure guideline-concordant care.

Previous studies have evaluated adherence to these recommendations for posttreatment surveillance, with reported rates ranging from 25% to 71% [ 7-10 11 12 We contend that incomplete data on imaging indications are a potential contributing factor to the observed variability in guideline adherence. Imaging after definitive treatment can occur for multiple reasons, including nonsurveillance indications such as a chest computed tomography (CT) ordered for a traumatic injury. Previous studies that have included information on imaging indications have been limited to single-center experiences with a relatively small patient sample and are likely influenced by these population differences and varying institutional practices [ 8 13 7 9 10 14 Herein, this study examines posttreatment surveillance using detailed national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data to estimate the true rate of adherent surveillance and predictors of guideline-concordant care in patients with early-stage non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We used a novel annotation methodology to abstract imaging indications from national data at scale. Information on imaging indications and clinical documentation allowed us to use a competing risk analysis for estimating the cumulative probability of surveillance. In contrast to previously published reports, this form of time-to-event analysis offers the opportunity to account for events and describe the factors that affect posttreatment surveillance [ 15 16 Methods Cohort and Definitions Using the VHA electronic health record databases, we identified 20,532 patients treated with curative intent for nonmetastatic primary NSCLC who were diagnosed between January 1, 2008, and April 30, 2016. We used the International Classification of Diseases, 9th/10th Edition ICD-9/10 Multimedia Appendix 1 17 ICD-9/10 Multimedia Appendix 1 The study cohort included a random subset of 1890 eligible patients with completely abstracted radiology reports and clinical notes from a 9238-sample cohort. An additional 369 patients from the sample cohort had no radiology reports directly relevant to NSCLC surveillance. To avoid overrepresentation of patients without abstractable radiology reports in our analysis, we weighted these patients so that their proportion in the study cohort was the same as their proportion among all eligible patients in the sample cohort—bringing the final analysis sample to 1888. Radiology Abstraction We abstracted image indications (surveillance, symptoms, abnormality follow-up, other, and unknown) and modalities (positron emission tomography [PET]; chest X-ray [CXR]; chest CT; and other [magnetic resonance imaging, non–chest CT, and bone scan]) from radiology reports. Imaging indications were identified in the report text and recorded as documented. We used the previously published semiautomated chart abstraction protocol by our group for obtaining detailed radiology data [ 18 Clinical Abstraction Clinical notes from patient charts were used to abstract any missing data on disease stage, smoking status, NSCLC recurrence or an SPLC, and tumor histology. Final pathologic staging took precedence during chart abstraction. Smoking at the time of diagnosis or initial presentation was considered “current.” The presence of recurrent NSCLC or SPLC was determined based on documentation by a treating clinician. Histologic subtypes were identified directly from pathologic reports when available or collected from other clinical note types (eg, progress notes). Patients who had small cell histology, had recurrence or SPLC outside the lungs within 120 days after treatment, or did not undergo curative-intent treatment were also excluded. Outcomes of Interest The primary outcome was receipt of guideline-concordant surveillance imaging. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations for posttreatment surveillance imaging at the time of diagnosis were used as a base set of guidelines [ 19 Multimedia Appendix 1 Ethical Considerations This study was approved by the institutional review boards of Stanford University and the Department of Veterans Affairs (IRB-46841). The study data used were deidentified. Informed consent was waived as per institutional review board review. Statistical Methods To estimate the cumulative probability of patients receiving guideline-concordant surveillance imaging within the initial 120- to 270-day surveillance window after curative-intent therapy, we used a competing risks framework to account for competing events. This can help provide unbiased estimates of patients experiencing the event of interest, given that competing events materially alter their probability or preclude them entirely. For example, receiving a diagnosis of recurrent NSCLC before scheduled surveillance precludes guideline-concordant surveillance, as imaging after recurrence can no longer be considered surveillance. Recurrences discovered during surveillance imaging were coded as surveillance events. An example schematic of the time-to-event analysis helps visualize a few of these relatively common clinical scenarios (Figure S1 in Multimedia Appendix 1 We used the Aalen-Johansen estimator and corresponding CIs to analyze the primary outcome, that is, the receipt of guideline-concordant surveillance imaging within the 120 to 270 days after curative-intent treatment. Death, recurrence, SPLC, and nonconcordant surveillance were treated as the competing events in this analysis. To evaluate the factors associated with the primary outcome, we used multivariable cause-specific Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and CIs. We considered various demographic factors (eg, sex, age, race, marital status, and year of diagnosis) and clinical factors (eg, treatment, histology, and disease stage) in this model. To adjust for multiple testing, we applied the Bonferroni correction method for 11 independent variables in each model. We reported unadjusted P Multimedia Appendix 1 20 Results Demographics of the Analytic Cohort Of 135,513 patients diagnosed with primary NSCLC between January 1, 2008, and April 30, 2016, a total of 20,532 met the study eligibility requirements ( Figure 1 Cohort and Definitions Table 1 Figure 1.

Cumulative Probability of Receiving Posttreatment Imaging To estimate the cumulative probability of patients receiving guideline-concordant surveillance imaging after curative-intent therapy, we used a competing risks framework to correctly estimate the cumulative probability by accounting for competing events (eg, death or recurrence). This analysis shows that the cumulative probability of receiving guideline-concordant imaging for surveillance was 43.8% (827/1888; 99.6% CI 41.6%-46.1%; Figure 2 Figure 2. Cumulative probability estimated from an Aalen-Johansen competing events model for receipt of guideline-concordant imaging, defined as chest computed tomography imaging with a documented indication of surveillance, within 120 to 270 days after definitive therapy. The probability curves are stacked such that the sum at any time point is 100%. Patients were followed only until the first event, and cumulative probability is therefore the expected proportion of patients who had the event as their first event before a given time point. The overlaid table shows the cumulative probability (Pr) and 99.6% CI at 270 days after therapy. Factors Associated With Receiving Guideline-Concordant Surveillance Imaging We evaluated the association between the receipt of guideline-concordant surveillance imaging and various demographic and clinical variables using multivariable cause-specific Cox regression ( Table 4 P P P Multimedia Appendix 1 Table 4.

Moreover, the true fraction of patients receiving surveillance imaging consistent with recommended guidelines in this study was less than half (43.8%). This is an improvement over results from our previous study of patients’ first imaging procedures within 4 to 8 months after resection (representing the first surveillance window) of early-stage NSCLC in the Medicare population, where 24.6% of patients received a chest CT scan and 59.6% received a CXR [ 7 9 14 Comparison to Existing Literature We observed that the rate of guideline-concordant surveillance CT imaging is substantially lower than that previously reported by Malhotra et al [ 10 9 10 10 Strengths An important strength of our study is the inclusion of detailed VHA data that provided insights into the indications for radiology procedures. Indeed, true rates of posttreatment surveillance were previously obscured by the fact that imaging reported from other studies may have been done for purposes other than surveillance, as it is nearly impossible to reliably categorize imaging indications using administrative and claims data alone. Another strength of our study was the ability of the competing risks model to evaluate true surveillance rates in the presence of competing events that alter estimates put forth in other studies. Indeed, we found 7.6% (144/1888) of patients were not eligible to receive surveillance in our sample cohort because of death or recurrence. Accounting for competing events addresses the potential for overestimating the incidence of the event of interest, a potential weakness of using the Kaplan-Meier method or claims-based data in this setting. Each of these features present in this study likely describes our report of relatively lower rates of guideline-concordant surveillance compared with the literature. Thus, using the most liberal interpretation of our data, excluding those patients with competing events of early recurrence or death, 59% (1114/1888) of our cohort received imaging with the explicit intent of surveillance (44%, 827/1888 guideline concordant and 15%, 287 discordant). This is consistent with other reports lacking indication data, yet 33% (630/1888) received no imaging at all during this initial surveillance period. This allows us to highlight the latter group of patients with no surveillance imaging as the most important group to target when considering interventions in the future. Limitations There are limitations to be acknowledged in this study. First is the use of administrative ICD-9/10 21 22 Future Directions In conclusion, the use of this detailed clinical database, along with the novel application of a competing risks model, has provided additional clarity on the current state of adherence to posttreatment surveillance. Our analysis shows that the rate of guideline-concordant surveillance in this national cohort was lower than that reported in many studies. There is a need to develop efficient strategies to monitor the rate of guideline-concordant surveillance as well as patient education and health care professional advocacy to ensure these patients do not fall through the cracks of the health system. In addition, future studies are needed to determine how guideline adherence and other aspects of current surveillance practices influence clinical outcomes, especially given the recent literature casting doubts on the survival benefits of routine surveillance imaging [ 22 23 Supplementary material 10.2196/76515 Multimedia Appendix 1 Example schematic of the time-to-event analysis with competing risks.
