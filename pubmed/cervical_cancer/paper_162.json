On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal physiological ranges, including stable blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Palpation of the cervical region revealed no evidence of lymphadenopathy or abnormal masses in the cervical triangles. Pulmonary examination demonstrated clear lung sounds on auscultation. Chest CT revealed nodular lesions in the right lower lung lobe, diffuse miliary opacities in both lungs, and multiple enlarged lymph nodes, including subcarinal lymphadenopathy (Figure 1A–C FIGURE 1 Chest computed tomography (CT) findings. CT revealed nodules in the right lower lobe (A) and miliary shadows in both lungs (B). The red circle denotes the primary lung tumor; red arrows indicate minimal intrapulmonary metastases, and the blue arrow highlights enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes. Contrast‐enhanced chest CT demonstrated enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes (C). After 11 months, the tumor showed a partial but stable response (D). 3 Differential Diagnosis, Investigations, and Treatment The micronodules observed on CT were independent of the components of the secondary lobule and exhibited a symmetrical, diffuse distribution. Based on these findings, miliary tuberculosis and highly vascular tumors, such as renal cell carcinoma, were considered. Alternative differential diagnoses included sarcoidosis and metastatic lung tumors. Blood tests revealed elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (10.7 ng/mL) and sialyl Lewis X (470 U/mL), while angiotensin‐converting enzyme and soluble interleukin‐2 receptor levels were within normal ranges. The interferon‐gamma release assay was negative. Contrast‐enhanced CT further demonstrated metastatic involvement of the left adrenal gland, liver, and multiple bones. To establish a definitive diagnosis, endobronchial ultrasound‐guided transbronchial needle aspiration was performed on a subcarinal lymph node. Histopathological examination confirmed lung adenocarcinoma, and multiplex gene panel testing identified a RET fusion (Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Histopathological findings. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed characteristic features of lung adenocarcinoma. 4 Conclusions and Results Follow‐up imaging demonstrated a partial response to treatment (Figure 1D 5 Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first published case to explicitly describe a miliary pattern in RET fusion‐positive NSCLC responding to selpercatinib. Lung cancer typically manifests on imaging as nodular lesions, pleural effusions, and lymphadenopathy [ 7 4 4 4 8 Several studies have reported an association between miliary intrapulmonary metastases and NSCLC harboring driver gene alterations, including EGFR mutations, ALK and RET fusions, and ROS1 rearrangements [ 6 9 10 11 12 13 9  RET 14 15 16 17 18 p 18 19 5 5 In the present case, our patient exhibited a durable response to selpercatinib, maintaining disease control for over 1 year despite extensive bilateral miliary lung metastases. This case provides novel evidence suggesting that RET 6 Conclusion This case highlights the critical importance of comprehensive driver gene testing, including RET RET Author Contributions  Soichi Iwanaka: Tadashi Nishimura: Hajime Fujimoto: Daichi Morita: Hitoshi Kuru: Yasumasa Sakakura: Corina N.
