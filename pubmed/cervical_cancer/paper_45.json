Objective Obesity is associated with chronic, low-grade inflammation in metabolic tissues such as liver, adipose tissue and skeletal muscle implicating insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes as inflammatory diseases. This inflammatory response involves the accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages in these metabolically relevant organs. The Ca 2+ Methods Mice with myeloid-specific deletion of Camkk2 Results Myeloid-specific Camkk2 Conclusions Our data establish CAMKK2 as an important regulator of macrophage function and putative therapeutic target for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders. Highlights • Myeloid-specific CAMKK2 deficiency in mice prevents diet-induced fat accumulation, insulin resistance, and hepatosteatosis. • CAMKK2 deficiency alters gene expression in macrophages, enhancing fat oxidation and driving an anti-inflammatory phenotype. • CAMKK2 is an attractive therapeutic target for treating obesity and related metabolic disorders.

Herein, we identified a calcium and fatty acid responsive kinase, CAMKK2, as having direct control of regulating immune cell and whole-body metabolism. Under conditions of dietary stress or in cases of infection, reliance on aerobic glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation for energy production predominates in pro-inflammatory macrophages because of a defunct and/or impaired TCA cycle [ 17 18 19 20 21 Camkk2 MKO Camkk2 Our data suggest that myeloid-specific deletion of Camkk2 Camkk2 Camkk2 Camkk2 MKO CAMKK2 and liver kinase-B1 (LKB1) are upstream activators of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a key enzyme involved in cellular energy sensing and maintenance of whole-body metabolic balance. One question that arises from our study is what role, if any, does AMPK play in mediating the phenotype we observed in Camkk2 MKO Prkaa1 22 23 23 Camkk 2 24 Camkk2 25 A limitation of our study is the basic phenotyping of eWAT macrophages using the commonly employed markers CD11c and CD206 to distinguish between pro- and anti-inflammatory populations [ 26 [27] [28] [29] [30] 31 [32] [33] [34] 30 35 36 Camkk2 MKO LysMCre LysMCre Camkk2 13 37 in vitro in vivo in vivo Although we focused on obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction in this study, it should be noted that macrophage polarity and, importantly, metabolic reprograming is also implicated in infectious and/or inflammatory diseases [ 38 4 39 Camkk2 40 Camkk2 41 42 43 [44] [45] [46] 47 In summary, we demonstrate that deletion of Camkk2 Camkk2 4 Methods 4.1 Mouse husbandry All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Care Research Committee at Baylor College of Medicine. Camkk2 fl/fl LysM-Cre Tg/- Camkk2 fl/fl LysM-Cre Tg/- Camkk2 fl/fl LysM-Cre Tg/- Camkk2 fl/fl LysM-Cre −/− Camkk2 fl/fl LysM-Cre Tg/Tg Camkk2 MKO 4.2 Histology Fresh liver tissue was fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 48 h and embedded in paraffin. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to evaluate gross morphology, and Sirius Red was used to examine fibrosis. Frozen-block preparation was performed by embedding liver tissues in OCT compound. Oil Red O staining was used to visualize neutral lipid accumulation as previously described. All staining was carried out by the pathology core at Baylor College of Medicine. 4.3 Glucose and insulin tolerance tests For glucose tolerance tests (GTT) with insulin measurement, mice were fasted for 16 h and administered a 50 % glucose solution via IP injection at 2 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected prior to, and after glucose injection at times 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively, via tail vein bleeding using a lancet. Blood glucose was measured based on the glucose hexokinase assay and plasma levels of insulin were determined by ELISA (Millipore). Mice were restrained repeatedly for less than a minute each time blood samples were collected. For insulin tolerance tests (ITT), mice were fasted for 4 h and administered a defined dose of insulin, 1 U/kg body weight (Humulin R) via IP injection. Blood glucose was measured at 0 (before) and after 15, 30, 60 and 120 min of insulin injection using a glucometer (Life Scan). 4.4 Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps were performed according to protocols previously described [ 48 49 Camkk2 MKO 3 14 14 14 4.5 RNAseq analysis RNA samples were isolated from eWAT, iWAT and BMDMs extracted from Camkk2 MKO https://metascape.org 4.6 qPCR Total mRNA was isolated from naïve BMDM from Camkk2 MKO 4.7 Comprehensive lab animal monitoring systems (CLAMS) Calorimetry (Columbus Instruments) was used for real time measuring of Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER).

In brief, 20–25 μg of tissue protein lysate was loaded onto a 4–20 % gradient SDS-PAGE page gel, separated at 125 V for 90 min, transferred using the iBlot system for 5 min to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked in 3 % BSA in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1 % Tween-20 (TBS-T).

Retained Oil Red O was extracted using isopropanol and absorbance was measured at 492 nm. 4.14 β-oxidation assay β-oxidation assays were performed as previously described [ 54 14 14 14 4.15 Citrate synthase assay and Mitotracker staining BMDMs from Camkk2 MKO in vitro 6 4.16 Flow cytometry Stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells from Camkk2 MKO AB_469392 AB_914345 AB_467108 AB_465552 AB_324594 + + + + – + – 4.17 Statistical analyses Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (Version 10.3.1; GraphPad). Comparisons between two groups were performed using unpaired, two-tailed Student's t-test. For comparisons of more than two genotype groups and effects, two-way ANOVA was performed followed by Sidak's post-hoc multiple comparisons test. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA were performed to compare two genotype groups analyzed with time, followed by Fisher's LSD post-hoc test. ANCOVA analysis was performed using body weight as a covariate using CalR (Version 1.3) [ 50 CRediT authorship contribution statement Andrea R. Ortiz: Kevin Nay: Brittany A. Stork: Adam M.
