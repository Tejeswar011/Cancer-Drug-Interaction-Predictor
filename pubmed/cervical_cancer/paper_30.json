Introduction and importance Salivary gland neoplasms, comprising 2-6.5% of head and neck tumors, primarily arise in the parotid and submandibular glands. Salivary gland cystic lesions can be either neoplastic or non-neoplastic. Presentation of case This is a 50-year-old male with a cystic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) in the parotid gland, presenting with a right infraauricular swelling that had progressively enlarged over three years. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) indicated a benign cystic neoplasm. Histological examination, however, confirmed ACC with cystic changes. Clinical discussion A cyst in salivary gland neoplasms can result from degeneration, necrosis, or hemorrhage within the tumor, or when the tumor arises within a non-neoplastic cyst. Differentiating between benign and malignant cystic salivary gland lesions is challenging preoperatively. Accurate preoperative diagnosis is essential to prevent unnecessary surgeries, and techniques such as ultrasound and FNAC are critical in assessing these lesions. Conclusion Cystic changes in malignant tumors, particularly ACC, are not frequently reported, underlining the need for increased awareness among clinicians and pathologists. This case highlights the importance of including ACC in the differential diagnosis of cystic salivary gland tumors. Highlights • Salivary gland neoplasms are rare • Cystic salivary gland neoplasms are uncommon, and cystic adenoid cystic carcinoma is exceptionally rare. • Cystic salivary gland • Accurate preoperative diagnosis is crucial to avoid unnecessary surgeries and complications.

The most common site of involvement is the parotid gland, followed by the submandibular gland [ 1 2 1 3 4 13 2 Presentation of case A fifty-year-old male patient presented with a complaint of an occasional mildly painful, gradually increasing right infra-auricular swelling for three years. There was no associated paresthesia or motor deficits. There was no previous history of head and neck cancer surgery. He denies any constitutional symptoms, including fever, chills, night sweats, appetite changes, and weight loss. He has never drunk alcohol and has never smoked. On maxillofacial examination, there is a swelling over the right infraauricular area that distorts his facial contour. Palpation reveals a well-circumscribed, freely movable, soft, 3 × 4 cm non-tender mass above the angle of the mandible ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Physical examination: 3 × 4 cm right infraauricular swelling. Fig. 1 The patient was investigated with a head CT scan and fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). The CT scan showed a well-defined, fluid-attenuating right parotid gland lesion measuring 2.7 × 2.8 × 3.2 cm with smooth margins. No enhancing parts were seen ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 The CT scan shows cystic right parotid lesion (red arrows). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Fig. 2 After written informed consent was obtained, the patient was transferred to the operating theatre, where a partial parotidectomy was performed through a modified Blair incision by a maxillofacial surgeon. Intraoperatively, a well-delineated 3 × 4 cm cystic mass was found on the tail of the parotid gland. Hemostasis was checked using the Valsalva maneuver, and a drainage tube was placed into the defect, away from the nerve. The drain was secured at the skin surface with a 2–0 silk suture, and the wound was closed in two layers and dressed. The patient was extubated safely and transferred to the post-anesthesia unit with stable vital signs. The specimen was sent for histopathological examination. On gross examination, a 3 × 3 cm partly opened, well-circumscribed cystic tissue was received. There was no any solid growth inside the cyst cavity ( Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Fig. 3 Gross picture: A well circumscribed cystic tissue (A) and a cut surface (B). Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Histologic sections revealed a cyst wall lined with bilayered cuboidal cells (A, 10×). The wall is infiltrated with moderately pleomorphic, hyperchromatic, angulated basaloid cells arranged in solid nests (D, 40×) and a cribriform pattern (B, 20× and C, 40×)(hematoxylin and eosin). Fig. 4 Postoperatively, the patient was kept in the ward for close monitoring of the wound and for parenteral medications. The integrity of the facial nerve was evaluated in the immediate postoperative period. Antibiotic ointment was applied to the suture line during the initial postoperative care. The patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day and showed no signs of metastasis or recurrence at the six-month follow-up. 3 Clinical discussion Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy arising from the secretory glands, most commonly involving the salivary glands, and it is most frequently observed in the 6th and 7th decades of life. It is the second most common malignant neoplasm of the major salivary glands and is also common in minor salivary gland [ 5 6 A wide spectrum of neoplastic to non-neoplastic salivary gland pathologies may present as partially or completely cystic. Parotid gland cysts are rare, accounting for 2–5 % of parotid lesions [ 7 8 9 10 Accurate preoperative diagnosis is crucial to avoid unnecessary surgeries and their complications. US and FNAC are important diagnostic modalities for cystic salivary gland lesions [ 1 3 4 11 1 The sensitivity of FNAC in diagnosing cystic salivary gland lesions ranges from 41.6 % to 100 %. It is especially sensitive in diagnosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma in mucus-containing aspirates [ 4 8 4 12 Although cystic changes are observed in a wide variety of malignant salivary gland tumors, cases with cystic changes in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) have rarely been reported [ 1 3 4 7 11 4 Conclusion In conclusion, cystic salivary gland neoplasms are uncommon, and cystic ACC is exceptionally rare. These neoplasms pose a diagnostic challenge for both clinicians and pathologists, as there are a range of differential diagnoses and they yield paucicellular aspirates during FNAC. This case report alerts pathologists and clinicians to consider ACC in the differential diagnosis of cystic salivary gland tumors and include FNAC from the solid part of the cystic lesion in a diagnostic workup before any operative procedure.
