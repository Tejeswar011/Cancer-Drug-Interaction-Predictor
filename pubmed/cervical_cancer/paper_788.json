The demethylation of H3K4me2/3 is orchestrated by the KDM5 demethylase family, comprising KDM5A, KDM5B, KDM5C, and KDM5D. Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of KDM5 demethylases in mediating resistance to cancer therapies, encompassing chemoresistance, radioresistance, immune evasion, and targeted therapy resistance. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the regulatory mechanisms by which KDM5 demethylases contribute to these resistance pathways, with a focus on their molecular targets and interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming treatment resistance by targeting KDM5 demethylases. These insights provide a foundation for the development of innovative therapeutic interventions to enhance the efficacy of existing cancer treatments, offering a transformative approach to improving long-term patient survival and quality of life.

Resistance appeared almost inevitably in the processes of these treatments, which usually lead to treatment failure ultimately [ 1 2 6 7 8 Epigenetic modifications mainly comprise six regulatory processes including DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, and SUMOylation, ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes, non-coding RNAs, nuclear dynamics and three-dimensional genome organization, and the Poly- comb (PcG) and Trithorax (TrxG) complexes [ 9 10 11 Histone methylation, first discovered in the 1960s, is the most extensively studied PTMs owing to its close connection with development, progression, and therapy of various cancers and roles of gene expression regulation [ 12 13 14 15 2+ 16 In this review, we summarize the cellular and molecular resistance mechanisms of four types of treatments mediated by KDM5 demethylases, including chemoresistance, radioresistance, targeted resistance, and immune evasion. Obtaining an in-depth understanding of the contribution of KDM5 demethylases on therapy resistance maybe provide insight for the innovation of therapeutic resistance strategies. Structures and catalytic mechanisms of KDM5 demethylases Structures of KDM5 demethylases KDM5 demethylases comprise four members KDM5A/B/C/D, and perform a high degree of homology in sequence and domain organization. In structure, all of the KDM5 members consist of five highly conserved domains: an N-terminal Jumonji (JmjN) domain, an AT-rich interactive domain (ARID), a catalytic JmjC domain, a helical C5HC2 motif containing zinc finger domain (Znf), and two to three plant homeodomain (PHD) domains (PHD1-3). KDM5A and KAM5B have a third PHD domain (PHD3) [ 17 18 1 19 20 21 22 24 18 25 26 27 28  Fig. 1 Figure 1 A KDM5 demethylases structure. KDM5A/B/C/D are 1690/1544/1560/1570 amino acids residues in length. KDM5 demethylases have five domains: JmjN, ARID, JmjC, Znf, and two to three PHDs, KDM5A and KAM5B have a third PHD domain (PHD3). B The three-dimensional structure of KDM5 demethylases. The catalytic domain JmjC is surrounded by JmjN, ARID, Znf, and PHD. Catalytic mechanisms of KDM5 demethylases KDM5 demethylases are confirmed to preferably remove H3K4me3/2 that mainly enrich in the transcription start sites (TSS) dependent on reaction with substrates including Fe 2+ 2 2 2 29 30 31  Fig. 2 Figure 2 Expression of KDM5 demethylases and H3K4 methylation mechanisms of KDM5 demethylases. First, KDM5 demethylases identify and locate in H3K4me3/2 in the histone tails of chromosome. second, JmjC catalyzes hydroxylation of methyl group with assistance of co-factors including Fe2+, 2OG, H2O, and O2. Third, one methyl group is reduced from lysine with the action of hydroxymethyl cleavage, followed by produced of CO2 , succinate, and formaldehyde. KDM5A KDM5A, also known as JARID1A (jumonji domain ARID-containing protein) or retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (RBP2), is expressed by location in the human genome at loci 12p13.33. KDM5A was firstly reports as a RB pocket domain-binding protein in 2001 [ 32 1 33 34 35 KDM5B KDM5B, also named JARID1B or PLU1, was initially reported in breast cancer as an oncogene. This gene is located in the human genome at loci 1q32.1. Protein structure of KDM5B consists of 1544 amino acids, the minimum amount of amino acids in the four demethylases (Fig. 1 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 KDM5C KDM5C, also called JARID1C or SMCX, is located in the human genome at loci Xp11.22. KDM5C protein has 1560 amino acids and is lack of PHD3 domain (Fig. 1 52 53 54 55 56 57 KDM5D KDM5D (JARID1D or SMYC) is encoded on Y chromosome and located in loci Yq11.223.1 and is composed by 1570 amino acids. KDM5D mediate a range of physiological events including cardiomyocyte differentiation [ 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 KDM5 demethylases and cancer therapy resistance KDM5 demethylases have been implicated in resistance to various therapies—including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy—across a wide spectrum of malignancies such as head and neck cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, hepatic cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, oral squamous cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, and osteosarcoma (Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Figure 3 KDM5 methylases involved in cancer therapy resistance in various cancers. KDM5 demethylases have been reported to regulate the therapy resistance to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy in various cancers including head and neck cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, esophageal cancer, breast cancer, hepatic cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, oral squamous cell cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma, and osteosarcoma. Among them, KDM5A and KDM5B play central roles in mediating therapy resistance in most cancers, whereas KDM5C and KDM5D exhibit more context-dependent functions. KDM5C, in particular, has been associated with immune evasion mechanisms in breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and NSCLC [ 69 71 72 73 74 KDM5 demethylases and chemoresistance KDM5A KDM5A contributes to chemoresistance in several cancers, as reported in multiple studies (Fig. 4 75 76 77  Fig. 4 Figure 4 The regulatory mechanisms of KDM5 methylases in cancer chemoresistance. A In hepatocellular carcinoma, KDM5A decreases response to cisplatin with activation of ROCK1, inhibition of PTEN, and phosphorylation of AKT. B In melanoma, KDM5B promotes cisplatin resistance via activation of mitochondrial of respiratory chain. C In neuroblastoma, KDM5B induces cisplatin resistance by notch/jagged axis and EMT. D In osteosarcoma, KDM5A/B decrease response to hydroxyurea by activation of MMR2 and CHK1. E In endometrial carcinoma, paclitaxel resistance of KDM5B can be inhibited by miR-29-3p. F In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, deubiquitination of KDM5B induced by USP7 inhibits the expression of ZBTB16 and activation of TOP2A, thus leads to decreased response to ciaplatin. G In gastric cancer, HSP90 protect KDM5B escapes from ubiquitination degradation, KDM5B promotes cisplatin resistance via activation of XRCC1 and DNA repair. H In colorectal cancer, KDM5C induces resistance to oxaliplatin and irinotecan by repression of ABCC1. I In prostate cancer, KDM5D decrease resistance to docetaxel with inhibition of genes of AR signaling pathway and MYBL2 expression. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor gene and inhibits the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway by phosphorylation. Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) appears to activate the PI3K/AKT pathway by negatively inhibiting PTEN [ 78 79 4 80 81 82 83 84 4 KDM5B Currently, we find that KDM5B contributes to the chemotherapy resistance by different mechanisms in various cancers types. In 2013, Roesch et al. pointed that KDM5B can persistently activate the function of mitochondrial respiratory chain, and thus promote melanoma cell acquire resistance to cisplatin (Fig. 4 85 4 86 87 Moreover, the deubiquitinating enzyme HSP90 protect KDM5B from ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation, thus upregulating KDM5B expression to sustain chemoresistance (Fig. 4 88 89 4 90 81 KDM5C KDM5C appears to have context-dependent roles in chemoresistance. In certain cancers, such as cervical cancer, it behaves similarly to KDM5B by promoting cisplatin resistance via activation of the Notch/Jagged signaling axis [ 77 72 KDM5D, a Y-chromosome-encoded gene, remains poorly understood in the context of therapy resistance. Contrary to our previous claim, the reported role of promoting gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was misattributed to KDM5D and should correctly be assigned to KDM5A [ 77 Despite the limited literature, KDM5D has shown relevance in prostate cancer, where it was reported to enhance the efficacy of docetaxel and cabazitaxel. Additionally, emerging data suggest sex-specific functions of KDM5D, particularly in colorectal cancer, where it may influence immune evasion or therapy response uniquely in male patients. Given that KDM5D is only expressed in males, its role in sex-biased cancer biology warrants deeper investigation. These aspects position KDM5D as a promising but underexplored target for future research in precision oncology. KDM5D Activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling is associated with docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer, KDM5D contributes to localize in promotors of the genes of AR signaling and prevent the protein expression of AR signaling, and thus induces sensitivity to do [ 73 74 The roles of KDM5 demethylases and regulatory genes and pathways related in chemoresistance are recorded in Table 1  Table 1 The roles of KDM5 demethylases and regulatory genes and pathways related in chemoresistance Demethylases Cancer types Roles in resistance Drugs Related genes and signal pathways References KDM5A Glioblastoma Promotor Temozolomide - [ 75 Ovarian cancer Promotor Paclitaxel - [ 76 Lung adenocarcinoma Promotor Paclitaxel -  [120] Liver cancer Promotor Cisplatin ROCK1, PTEN, AKT [ 80 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas Promotor Gemcitabine - [ 77 Osteosarcoma Promotor Hydroxyurea MMR2, CHK1, replication dress [ 81 KDM5B Melanoma Promotor Cisplatin mitochondrial oxidative ATP-synthesis genes [ 85 Neuroblastoma Promotor Cisplatin Jagged/Notch axis [ 86 Gastric cancer Promotor Cisplatin XRCC1 [ 89 Endometrial cancer Promotor Paclitaxel miR-29c-3p [ 90 Nasopharyngeal carcinoma Promotor Cisplatin USP7, ZBTB16/TOP2A [ 91 Osteosarcoma Promotor Hydroxyurea MMR2, CHK1, replication dress [ 81 KDM5C Colon cancer Repressor Oxaliplatin Irinotecan ABCC1 [ 72 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas Promotor Gemcitabine - [ 77 KDM5D Prostate cancer Repressor Docetaxel Cabazitaxel Androgen receptor MYBL2 [ 73 74 KDM5 demethylases and immune evasion KDM5A In Ovarian cancer, KDM5A plays a vital role in promoting immune evasion.

A In ovarian cancer, KDM5A promotes immune evasion by repressing MHC-I expression. B In melanoma, KDM5A increases response to ICB with stimulating phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT/S6K1 cascade. KDM5B promote immune evasion via inhibiting ER pathway activation. C In breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and HPV-positive head and neck cancer, KDM5B/C induces immune evasion by repressing STING expression. D In oral squamous cell carcinoma, KDM5A increases response to ICB with transcription repression of PTEN. LncRNA IFITM4P promotes the expression of KDM5A. E In NSCLC, KDM5B inhibits the killing effect of recombinant CD8+ T cells that specifically recognize cancer cells expressing NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3. F In ESCC, high expression of KDM5B decreases proliferation of CD8+ T cells. KDM5B KDM5B acts as a promotor in immune evasion. Cancer-testis antigen including NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1 and MAGE-A3, existing in male germ cells and human tumors including NSLC, are negatively regulated by KDM5B in NSCLC. NSCLC cells expressing NY-ESO-1, MAG 5 97 Cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) cascade, mainly sensing abnormally released self-DNA, is another critical regulatory pathway promotes the cancer immune response [ 98 99 99 5 69 5 100 Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) 101 102 P. gingivalis + + 103 KDM5C The function repressing immune response of KDM5C also by inactivating STING is concurrently reported with KDM5B [ 99 + 71 70 5 The roles of KDM5 demethylases and regulatory genes and pathways related in immune evasion are recorded in Table 2  Table 2 The roles of KDM5demethylases and regulatory genes and pathways related in immune evasion Demethylases Cancer types Roles cells involved in regulation Genes and signal pathways involved in regulation References KDM5A Melanoma Repressor M1 macrophages, CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, tumor-infiltrating CD103 + DCs PD-L1, PTEN, PI3K-AKT-S6K1 [ 96 Ovarian cancer Promotor MHC-1 cells, CD8 + T cells HLA-A [ 92 Oral squamous cell carcinoma Repressor M1 macrophages, CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, tumor-infiltrating CD103 + DCs PD - L1, LncRNA IFITM4P, PTEN [ 97 Glioblastoma Repressor M2 macrophages CD47, RB, AMPK [ 114 NSCLC Repressor CD4 + - [ 70 KDM5B HPV-positive head and neck cancer Breast cancer Colorectal cancer Promotor CD8 + T cells STING [ 69 100 Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma with P. gingivalis infection Promotor CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells B7-H4, CXCL11, CXCL9, CXCL10, [ 104 NSCLC Promotor Recombinant T cells NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A1, MAGE-A3 [ 98 Repressor CD4 + - [ 70 Melanoma Promotor MHC-I expression cells SETDB1, ERV, STING [ 101 KDM5C NSCLC Repressor CD4 + + - [ 70 71 Breast cancer Promotor CD8 + T cells STING [ 69 KDM5 demethylases and targeted therapy resistance KDM5A To date, both KDM5A and KDM5B are reported to act as promotors of targeted therapy resistance. In lung adenocarcinoma, silence of KDM5A induces the sensitivity to gefitinib [ 104 105 + 105 6 106  Fig. 6 Figure 6 The regulatory mechanisms of KDM5 methylases in targeted therapy resistance. A In liver carcinoma, KDM5B decreases response to sorafenib with inhibition of PTEN and stimulating phosphorylation of PI3K/AK cascade. B In NSCLC, gefitinib resistance under hypoxia induces overexpression of KDM5B and EMT. C In breast cancer, KDM5A decreases response to erlotinib with inhibition the expression of p21 and BAK1. D In ER+ breast cancer, KDM5A/B can increase transcriptomic heterogeneity to promotes resistance to Fulvestrant. E In melanoma, KDM5B promotes vemurafenib resistance via activation of mitochondrial of respiratory chain and genes associated with cell cycle, DNA repair, and cell death. Elevated KDM5B shifts melanoma cells to a more drug-tolerant, CD34- state upon exposure to trametinib and PLX4032. KDM5B In NSCLC, KDM5B is considered as a promotor for gefitinib resistance, the resistance to erlotinib induced by hypoxia is regulated by high expression of KDM5B that reduces the expression of EMT associated genes (Fig. 6 107 6 85 108 − + 109 Repression of PTEN regulated by KDM5B demethylation in promotor engages in sorafenib resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma. Phosphorylation of the following signaling PI3K/Akt pathway is downregulated after decreased expression of PTEN, thus leads to resistance to sorafenib (Fig. 6 110 6 111 The roles of KDM5 demethylases and regulatory genes and pathways related in targeted therapy resistance are recorded in Table 3  Table 3 The roles and elucidated mechanisms of KDM5 demethylases in targeted therapy resistance Demethylases Cancer types Roles targeted therapy resistance Drugs Related genes and signal pathways References KDM5A Breast cancer Promotor Erlotinib p21, BAK1  [121] Lung adenocarcinoma Promotor Gefitinib - [ 105 106 HER2 + Promotor Trastuzumab - [ 106 ER + Promotor Fulvestrant Transcriptomic heterogeneity [ 112 KDM5B ER + Promotor Fulvestrant Transcriptomic heterogeneity [ 112 NSCLC Promotor Gefitinib N-cadherin, Fibronectin, Vimentin, E-cadherin [ 108 Melanoma Promotor Trametinib PLX4032 CD34 − [ 110 Promotor Vemurafenib mitochondrial oxidative ATP-synthesis genes [ 85 promotor PLX4720 Genes controlling cell cycle, DNA repair, and cell death [ 109 Hepatocellular carcinoma Promotor Sorafenib PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway [ 111 KDM5 demethylases and radioresistance KDM5A The reason of radiotherapy failure of glioblastoma is the naïve radiotherapy resistance of glioma stem cells (GSCs). In these cells, ionizing radiation (IR) usually induces the DNA damage and strong DNA repair reaction subsequently that alters the cellular metabolism obviously. This process activates the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the primary sensor of cellular energy, mediates control of metabolic homeostasis as a hub [ 112 7 113  Fig. 7 Figure 7 The regulatory mechanisms of KDM5 methylases in radioresistance. A In lung adenocarcinoma, KDM5B suppresses radiosensitivity by inhibition of PTEN, KDM5B is elevated by HIF-α but decreased by miRNA-320a. B In lung squamous cell carcinoma, KDM5B promotes DNA repair pathways (HR and NHEJ) induced by IR to reduce response to radiotherapy. C In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, KDM5B decreases response to radiotherapy with expression inhibition of PIK3C3 that suppresses apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and autophagy. D In melanoma, In combination therapy, PLX4720 induces elevated KDM5B that activates expression of genes controlling cell cycle, DNA repair, and cell death to decrease response to radiotherapy subsequently. E In glioblastoma, IR activates phosphorylation of AMPK and RB, which leads inhibition of KDM5A expression, depletion of KDM5A enhances H3K4 methylation of CD47 promotor and activation of CD47, thus leads to M2 macrophage polarization and inhibition of phagocytosis. KDM5B In breast cancer, inhibition of KDM5B directly increases the radiosensitivity [ 114 115 7 116 7 117 KDM5B is overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, existence of KDM5B reduces the H3K4me3 methylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3) and expression of PIK3C3. Inhibition of PIK3C3 restricts apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, autophagy, and decreases sensitivity to radiotherapy (Fig. 7 118 V600E V600E V600E V600E 4 108 The roles of KDM5 demethylases and regulatory genes and pathways related in radioresistance are detailed in Table 4 。  Table 4 The roles of KDM5demethylases and regulatory genes and pathways related in radioresistance Demethylases Cancer types Roles in resistance Related genes and signal pathways References KDM5A Glioblastoma Repressor CD47, RB, AMPK [ 114 KDM5B Lung squamous cell carcinomas Promotor NHEJ, HR [ 118 Breast cancer Promotor - [ 115 Melanoma Promotor TP53BP2, E2F3, TREX1, SOX4, IGFR1, ILF2, CARD11, FXYD5 [ 109 NSCLC Promotor miR-320a, PTEN [ 117 Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma Promotor PIK3C3  [119] Therapeutic targeting of KDM5 demethylases: inhibitors, challenges, and future strategies Several small molecule inhibitors targeting KDM5 family members have been developed in recent years, offering potential avenues for overcoming therapy resistance. Notably, CPI-455 is a highly selective inhibitor of KDM5 demethylases that functions by competitively binding the Jumonji catalytic domain, leading to increased global H3K4me3 levels and impaired cancer cell proliferation in preclinical models. Similarly, KDOAM-25 exhibits nanomolar potency and selectivity, and has shown efficacy in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Another compound, JIB-04, although less specific, targets multiple Jumonji family members and has demonstrated anti-proliferative effects in several tumor types. Despite these promising developments, several challenges remain in the clinical translation of KDM5 inhibitors: Off-target effects are a major concern due to the structural homology among Jumonji family demethylases. Functional redundancy between KDM5A and KDM5B may allow compensatory upregulation, attenuating inhibitor efficacy. Epigenetic plasticity in tumor cells may facilitate escape mechanisms via reprogramming of chromatin states. To overcome these limitations, combination strategies are under exploration. For instance, CPI-455 has been tested in conjunction with chemotherapeutic agents and PARP inhibitors, demonstrating synergistic effects in drug-resistant cancer models. Emerging data also suggest that epigenetic rewiring induced by KDM5 inhibition may sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint blockade, opening new avenues for combined epigenetic-immunotherapy approaches. Overall, while the therapeutic potential of KDM5 inhibition is promising, clinical validation and safety optimization are crucial next steps. Future research should focus on biomarker-driven patient stratification, development of isoform-specific inhibitors, and a better understanding of KDM5’s role in tumor heterogeneity and resistance dynamics. Conclusion KDM5 demethylases are closely involved in the regulation of proteins related to therapy resistance. Our study is the first to systematically summarize the regulatory functions of KDM5 family members in different types of therapeutic resistance, including chemoresistance, immune evasion, targeted therapy resistance, and radioresistance. We structured the discussion from three perspectives: individual demethylases, cancer types, and regulatory mechanisms. At the enzyme level, KDM5A generally functions as a repressor of immune response and radioresistance suppressor, except in ovarian cancer, where it behaves differently. A key mechanism by which KDM5A enhances immune responses is through activation of M1 macrophages and suppression of M2 macrophage polarization across multiple cancers, including melanoma, oral squamous cell carcinoma, glioblastoma, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In contrast, KDM5A promotes chemoresistance and targeted therapy resistance by inhibiting tumor suppressors such as PTEN, thereby attenuating chemotherapy and immunotherapy responses. KDM5B enhances resistance across nearly all therapy types, except in the case of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) response in NSCLC, where it may play a positive regulatory role, as suggested by bioinformatic analysis. However, further preclinical validation studies are needed to confirm this finding. Notably, KDM5B suppresses STING, a crucial immunotherapy-related factor, leading to immune evasion in cancers such as HPV-positive head and neck cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma. Current evidence suggests KDM5C enhances immunotherapy response in NSCLC and improves oxaliplatin/irinotecan efficacy in colon cancer. KDM5D is implicated in gemcitabine resistance in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and immune evasion in breast cancer. Only one study reported KDM5D enhances docetaxel and cabazitaxel sensitivity in prostate cancer. The limited data for KDM5C and KDM5D underscores the need for more comprehensive investigation. Regarding cancer types, resistance mechanisms are best characterized in melanoma, where KDM5B activates genes governing cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis to promote radioresistance. It also induces resistance to BRAF inhibitors via enhancing mitochondrial respiration and promoting CD34⁺ melanoma subpopulations. KDM5A contributes to immune evasion in melanoma by inhibiting PTEN and activating the PI3K/AKT/S6K1 pathway. Additionally, cisplatin resistance involves mitochondrial metabolism regulation. In lung cancer, all four types of resistance—chemoresistance, immune evasion, targeted therapy resistance, and radioresistance—are discussed in relation to KDM5A and KDM5B. However, the mechanisms underlying paclitaxel resistance, gefitinib resistance, and immune evasion remain inadequately clarified. At the mechanistic level, PTEN and STING are pivotal targets regulated by KDM5 demethylases in immune evasion. KDM5-mediated chemoresistance, radioresistance, and targeted therapy resistance involve diverse molecular pathways. PTEN in particular plays a central role across all four resistance types. For example, in liver cancer, cisplatin and sorafenib resistance are associated with KDM5A- and KDM5B-mediated PTEN suppression, respectively. Overall, this review highlights the significant roles of KDM5 demethylases in therapy resistance. Addressing current knowledge gaps will help elucidate their therapeutic potential and may pave the way for overcoming treatment resistance in diverse cancer types.
