This review explores a new role for lactate, a molecule once thought to be merely a waste product of pancreatic cancer metabolism. We describe how lactate acts as a key signaling molecule that fuels tumor growth, helps the cancer hide from the immune system, and promotes the formation of new blood vessels. Understanding this process opens up new possibilities for diagnosing and treating pancreatic cancer, potentially by targeting lactate production or its effects within the tumor. This research highlights a promising new direction in the fight against this challenging disease. Abstract Since the discovery of the ‘Warburg effect’ in cancer, lactate is no longer considered merely a metabolic byproduct. It serves as both a metabolic fuel involved in the energy cycle and a signaling molecule that modulates cellular signal transduction. Recent studies have demonstrated that lactate participates in protein lactylation, regulates energy metabolism, reshapes the tumor microenvironment, and facilitates the metastasis of pancreatic cancer. Therefore, targeting lactate metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy and survival rates in pancreatic cancer. In this review, we outline aberrant lactate metabolism and recent advancements in lactylation, and elucidate the biological functions of lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer, focusing on metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. Additionally, we discuss diagnostic and therapeutic approaches targeting lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer. Research in this field is critical for understanding the mechanisms driving pancreatic cancer progression and is anticipated to develop novel therapeutic strategies for clinical practice. lactate metabolism lactylation pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment National Natural Science Foundation of China 82273970 32270768 82370715 National Key R&D Program of China 2023YFC2507900 Hubei Strategic Science and Technology Talent Plan 2024DJA037 Innovation Group Project of Hubei Province 2023AFA026 This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (No. 2023YFC2507900), National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 82273970 and No. 32270768 and No. 82370715), Hubei Strategic Science and Technology Talent Plan (No. 2024DJA037), Innovation Group Project of Hubei Province (No. 2023AFA026). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Pancreatic cancer, commonly referred to as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), is a malignant tumor that primarily originates from ductal epithelial cells. It has long posed a significant challenge in the medical field due to its inconspicuous early symptoms, difficulty in diagnosis, and poor prognosis [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Lactate metabolism, which encompasses the generation, transport, and utilization of lactate, is closely associated with glycolysis and glutaminolysis [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 7 24 25 26 27 28 29 7 30 31 32 33 34 In this review, we highlight abnormal lactate levels in pancreatic cancer and focus on lactylation. Given the distinct features of different stages in pancreatic cancer progression, our analysis centers on the impact of lactate metabolism on multiple physiological processes, including metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. Furthermore, we discuss the applications and future challenges of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches targeting lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer. This review illuminates the role of lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer, enriching fundamental knowledge of its influence on progression and offering insights into novel therapeutic strategies. 2. Aberrant Lactate Production in Pancreatic Cancer The oncogenic factors lead to the activation of proto-oncogenes [ 35 8 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 30 43 44 45 20 46 In addition to glycolysis, pancreatic cancer cells can generate lactate via glutamine (Gln) metabolism. Specifically, pancreatic cancer cells exhibit a phenomenon called ‘Gln addiction’, driven by arginine (Arg) depletion in the microenvironment and KRAS mutations [ 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 50 55 3. A Novel Protein Modification: Lactylation Aberrant lactate metabolism in tumors is not limited to energy supply. Its derived epigenetic modifications also aggravate the malignant phenotype of pancreatic cancer. In 2019, Zhang et al. [ 56 57 58 59 3.1. The Mechanism of Lactylation Precise mechanism of lactylation remains incompletely elucidated. Currently, it is widely accepted that lactylation is modulated through both enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. The enzymatic pathway entails the combination of lactate with coenzyme A (CoA) to form lactyl-CoA catalyzed by specific synthetases. Lactyl-CoA is then utilized for lactylation through the transfer of the lactyl moiety to lysine residues of proteins by specific transferases [ 60 60 Figure 1 61 62 Table 1 Table 1 43 63 64 61 65 61 66 65 67 68 69 58 70 67 71 63 72 73 74 75 76 70 Another mode of lactylation, the non-enzymatic reaction, does not necessitate the involvement of enzymes. This mode is also referred to as lactate-independent lactylation Non-enzymatic lactylation is accomplished through two principal pathways. One pathway comprises the direct reaction of methylglyoxal (MGO), a byproduct generated during glycolysis, with lysine to form carboxyethyl (N-ε lysine) lactylation ( Figure 1 78 79 80 81 Figure 1 78 Figure 1 The discovery of protein lactylation has expanded the scope of biological research on PTMs and offered valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms by which lactate influences a myriad of physiological and pathological processes, ranging from developmental anomalies [ 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 3.2. Lactylation in Pancreatic Cancer Dong et al. [ 77 77 43 While histones can be lactylated, an increasing number of studies indicate that non-histone proteins are also subject to lactylation. In pancreatic cancer, nucleolar and spindle-associated protein 1 (NUSAP1) has been found to form a transcriptional regulatory complex with c-MYC and HIF-1α. This complex localizes to the LDHA promoter region to enhance the expression of LDHA. Lactate-induced lactylation inhibits the degradation of NUSAP1, forming a positive feedback loop of NUSAP1-LDHA-glycolysis-lactate, which promotes pancreatic cancer metastasis and negatively affects the prognosis of pancreatic cancer [ 27 80 91 68 68 Crucially, intracellular lactate in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) facilitates extracellular lipolysis to produce free fatty acids by stabilizing apolipoprotein C2 (APOC2) via the lactylation of APOC2 K70. This mechanism enhances tumor metastasis and immunotherapy resistance [ 92 81 59 79 93 94 81 95 3.3. Lactate-Regulated Other Epigenetic Modification Processes The influence of lactate extends beyond lactylation. Lactate also exerts direct or indirect effects on other epigenetic modification processes, including DNA methylation [ 96 96 97 2 97 3.4. Lactylation and Acetylation An intriguing aspect is the considerable overlap between lactylation and acetylation. Both processes occur on lysine residues and share many catalytic enzymes [ 56 98 99 43 63 64 100 58 59 101 4. Effects of Lactate Metabolism on the Microenvironment of Pancreatic Cancer Lactate is not only an important substrate for lactylation but also plays a significant role in cellular metabolism. As research on lactate metabolism deepens, its role in the physiological processes of pancreatic cancer has increasingly come to the forefront, particularly concerning the metabolic reprogramming of tumor microenvironment [ 102 4.1. Metabolism Reprogramming In pancreatic cancer cells, the expression level of G protein-coupled receptor 81 (GPR81) is significantly upregulated on the cell membrane. Lactate, a natural ligand for GPR81, binds to and activates GPR81, triggering a series of downstream MAPK signaling cascades. One of these cascades induces the inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production via G protein α i/o (Gα i/o). The reduction in cAMP levels diminishes the expression and activity of gluconeogenesis-related enzymes [ 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 Figure 2 As pancreatic tumors develop, the metabolic profile of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the tumor microenvironment is significantly altered. Activated CAFs shift from an energy supply mode predominantly reliant on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to a highly active glycolytic state, characterized by enhanced glucose uptake capacity. Glucose is metabolized into pyruvate through glycolysis, which is subsequently converted into lactate under the catalysis of LDH. Studies have shown that a portion of the lactate produced can be transported to neighboring cancer cells [ 110 111 46 112 113 25 114 115 31 116 4.2. Angiogenesis The rapid growth of cancer cells subjects pancreatic cancer to a hypoxic and nutrient-deprived environment. To survive and perpetuate their growth under such adverse conditions, cancer cells initiate a series of adaptive mechanisms, with angiogenesis being a pivotal strategy. Angiogenesis is defined as the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, driven by the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells [ 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 11 24 120 124 Lactate transported into endothelial cells is oxidized to pyruvate by LDH, stabilizing HIF-1α and subsequently upregulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a master regulator of angiogenesis [ 28 125 126 127 128 129 Figure 3 4.3. Immune Evasion To persist and successfully metastasize to distant tissues and organs, tumor cells must evade the immune system [ 130 131 132 132 133 134 135 136 137 137 138 139 68 The stromal cells, immune suppressive cells, and ECM surrounding the tumor also create an environment conducive to tumor survival and escape [ 140 9 141 10 142 143 144 Lactate binding to GPR81 on macrophages drives their polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the immunosuppressive M2 phenotype. Simultaneously, lactate-induced histone lactylation further upregulates the expression of arginase 1 (Arg1) [ 145 146 147 148 149 + 89 150 Tumor cells experience profound metabolic stress, which drives high rates of glycolytic flux and lactate production [ 151 152 46 153 154 A study using a murine pancreatic cancer model revealed that lactate treatment decreased the production of perforin and granzyme B by NK cells [ 155 156 157 158 159 158 Section 4.1 Figure 2 158 + 160 Figure 4 5. Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer Based on Lactate Metabolism Lactate metabolism plays a vital role in the complex regulatory mechanisms underlying pancreatic cancer. Building on foundational research into lactate metabolism in the context of pancreatic cancer, it is highly plausible that lactate metabolism-related indicators may emerge as prospective biomarkers for early diagnosis or as effective therapeutic targets in future clinical applications. In recent years, research on lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer has gained significant traction. The following section will discuss the prospects of targeting lactate metabolism for the diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Early-stage pancreatic cancer typically presents with no overt symptoms, and by the time symptoms become apparent, the disease is often already in its intermediate or advanced stages. Traditional imaging modalities, such as ultrasound and computed tomography (CT), are unable to detect early-stage abnormalities promptly. Although the tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) offers high sensitivity [ 161 Research into targeting lactate metabolism for pancreatic cancer diagnosis has shown promising results. Serum marker monitoring has identified lactate as a differential metabolite in pancreatic cancer patients across different stages [ 159 162 163 164 164 165 While these probes hold certain application value, they also have limitations. Some probes may be metabolized and degraded in the body or induce immune reactions, potentially affecting imaging quality. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer is characterized by dense mesenchymal tissue, which hinders the uniform penetration of probes into tissues for effective detection. Coupled with inherent limitations in resolution and sensitivity, there is an increased risk of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Consequently, the optimization of imaging technology remains an area that warrants further exploration. 6. Targeting Lactate Metabolism in Pancreatic Cancer Therapy 6.1. Inhibiting Lactylation Lactate metabolism, beyond its diagnostic potential, has emerged as a promising therapeutic avenue for pancreatic cancer. This metabolic pathway is intricately regulated through proteins lactylation, primarily via the targeting of lactate transferase AARS or the delactylases HDAC and SIRT. However, research on lactate transferase remains limited. For instance, β-alanine has been shown to competitively bind to AARS1, inhibiting its lactylation activity [ 32 32 Table 2 6.2. Inhibiting Lactate Synthesis: Targeting LDH Existing studies have predominantly concentrated on inhibiting LDH, a key enzyme in lactate synthesis, to reduce lactate production and mitigate its tumor-promoting effects. Several inhibitors have been identified, including oxamate, which competitively binds to the active site of LDHA, displacing pyruvate and significantly reducing lactate production in pancreatic cancer cells [ 151 171 172 173 151 174 175 Table 2 6.3. Targeting Lactate Transport: The Role of MCT As mentioned above, MCTs are indispensable for lactate shuttling in and out of cells and have been closely linked to prognosis and lymph node metastasis in PDAC [ 176 177 116 166 178 179 180 167 166 + 181 182 182 183 + 181 184 Table 2 6.4. Targeting Other Metabolic Pathways: An Alternative Strategy Beyond direct targeting of LDH or MCTs, another viable strategy involves cascading interference with lactate transport and production via metabolic signaling pathways. In glycolysis, glucose antimetabolite 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) competitively binds to hexokinase (HK), inhibiting its activity and blocking the glycolysis pathway [ 185 186 187 188 169 169 189 168 190 191 170 Table 2 7. Conclusions and Discussion Lactate metabolism plays a crucial role in orchestrating the process of pancreatic cancer through a multifaceted and intricate regulatory network. Lactate acts as a precursor for protein lactylation, which modifies protein structures and functions. This progress regulates downstream signaling pathways, thereby promoting tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis. Additionally, lactate serves as a key substrate for various biosynthetic pathways, including lactylation, gluconeogenesis, TCA cycle and fatty acid synthesis, and functions as an agonist for the G-protein coupled receptor GPR81 to modulate cAMP/PKA signaling ( Figure 5 The critical role of lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer development has been extensively studied, providing a theoretical foundation for developing therapeutic strategies targeting this metabolic process. Preclinical studies show that lactate metabolism inhibitors exhibit promising anticancer activity, offering a new therapeutic avenue for pancreatic cancer management. However, the clinical application of these inhibitors faces several challenges, including inadequate target specificity, which may disrupt normal energy metabolism and heighten the risk of adverse reactions. The complex signaling network of lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer also makes it difficult for single inhibitors to comprehensively block this progress, potentially leading to drug resistance. Furthermore, the intricate metabolic environment in pancreatic cancer and the depletion of lactate metabolites through alternative pathways may reduce the efficacy of these inhibitors. Despite these challenges, there is significant potential for optimizing lactate metabolism inhibitors. Enhancing their structural specificity can improve targeting and reduce adverse effects on normal cells. Multi-target, multi-drug combination therapies have emerged as a promising approach. By leveraging the synergistic effects of various drug mechanisms, they can effectively counteract tumor cell compensatory mechanisms. Innovative drug delivery systems offer new possibilities. Zhang et al. [ 192 192 Advances in histological techniques and big data analytics allow systematic mapping of intracellular signaling pathways. These advancements not only deepen our understanding of the regulatory networks governing lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer and their dynamic interplay with other metabolic pathways, but also facilitate the integration of single-cell metabolomics with spatial genomics. AI-driven platforms such as DeepSeek-V3 and ChatGPT 5.0 can further decode the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of lactate metabolism and identify potential therapeutic targets. Sustained investigations of lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer can facilitate the early detection and continuous surveillance of the disease, which paves the way for innovative therapeutic avenues and effective management strategies. In summary, this review provides an analysis of contemporary therapeutic strategies targeting lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer ( Figure 5 Acknowledgments We thank Hubei University of Technology for financial support for this Review.

Function Name Reference Lactyl-CoA Synthetase ACSS2 [ 61 GTPSCS [ 62 Lactyltransferase P300 [ 63 77 CBP [ 64 GCN5/KAT2A [ 61 MYST1/MOF/KAT8 [ 66 MYST2/HBO1/KAT7 [ 65 TIP60/KAT5 [ 67 AARS1 [ 32 68 AARS2 [ 69 HDAC6 [ 70 Delactylase HDAC 1-3 [ 67 71 76 SIRT 1-3 [ 63 73 biology-14-01213-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Summary of therapeutic strategies targeting lactate metabolism in pancreatic cancer. Therapeutic Target Representative Inhibitors Mechanism Advantages Challenges Inhibit lactate LDHA Oxamate [ 163 146 Inhibits LDHA, reducing pyruvate-to-lactate conversion. Targets the core of glycolytic flux, multiple inhibitors available. Off-target effects, potential compensatory mechanisms by other LDH isoforms. Inhibit lactate transport MCT1/4 AZD3965 [ 111 166 Blocks lactate efflux, causing intracellular acidification and glycolysis inhibition. Target lactate export in both cancer and stromal cells, some inhibitors are in clinical trials. MCT4 affinity issues for some inhibitors, potential hematological toxicity. Target lactylation AARS1 (Lactyl-transferase), β-alanine (potential) [ 32 Inhibits lactyl-transferase activity, reducing protein lactylation. Novel epigenetic targeting, Early stage of research, lack of potent and specific clinical inhibitors. HDACs (De-lactylases) Sodium butyrate [ 32 32 Inhibits de-lactylase activity, potentially hyper-stabilizing lactylated proteins. Uses existing HDAC inhibitor, dual function (deacetylase/delactylase). Lack of specificity, complex and unpredictable outcomes. Target upstream pathways Glycolysis 2-DG [ 167 168 169 Inhibits key glycolytic enzymes (HK, GLUT1, PFKFB3), reducing lactate source. Broad impact on cancer metabolism, some compounds in clinical trials. Affect normal tissues with high glycolytic demand, compensatory metabolism. Glutaminolysis DRP-104 [ 170 Inhibits glutamine metabolism, reducing a key substrate for lactate production. Targets “glutamine addiction” of PDAC, impacts multiple metabolic pathways. Systemic glutamine depletion has side effects. ",
