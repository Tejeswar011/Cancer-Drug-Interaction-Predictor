Several aspects of food processing and formulation in the development of chronic inflammatory diseases are currently being studied. Ongoing research emphasizes epidemiological evidence and mechanistic insights regarding UPFs and their interaction with the intestinal microbiota. In this review, we explore UPFs, their interaction with the intestinal microbiota, and the implications for gastrointestinal health.

These products are typically designed to be hyper-palatable, convenient, and shelf-stable, often replacing minimally processed or home-prepared meals in modern diets. The concept has gained prominence through the NOVA food classification system, which categorizes foods based on the extent and purpose of processing, rather than nutrient content alone[ 1 1 Table 1 NOVA classification of foods[ 1  Category  Description  Examples Unprocessed or minimally processed foods Natural foods altered by removal of inedible parts, drying, freezing, or pasteurization without adding substances Fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, eggs, milk, and meat Processed culinary ingredients Substances extracted from group 1 foods or nature, used in home cooking to prepare and season dishes Oils, butter, sugar, salt, starch Processed foods Products are made by adding salt, sugar, oil, or other group 2 ingredients to group 1 foods, typically to increase shelf life or palatability Canned vegetables, cheese, salted nuts, bread UPFs Industrial formulations with little or no whole foods, containing additives for flavor, texture, and shelf life. Designed for convenience and hyper-palatability Soft drinks, packaged snacks, instant noodles, and ice cream UPFs: Ultra-processed foods. The classification of processed foods, however, remains complex and somewhat contested as multiple classification systems are present (Table 2 4 7 et al 8 Table 2 Alternative classification systems for ultra-processed foods[ 1 4 7  Classification system  Developed by/source  Basis of classification  Key features NOVA Monteiro et al 1 Extent and purpose of food processing Categorizes foods into 4 groups; emphasizes the health risks of UPFs UNC system University of North Carolina Processing categories based on ingredient lists and barcodes Categorizes > 12000 United States foods from NHANES; focuses on industrial processing IFPRI classification International Food Policy Research Institute Technological processes and ingredient function Emphasizes processing techniques like extrusion, hydrolysis EU FP7 (Food4Me Project) European Commission Combining processing level with nutritional and matrix properties Assess the impact of the food matrix and nutrient profile EPIC-Soft/GloboDiet European Prospective Investigation into Cancer Harmonized food description for dietary recall Focuses on preparation and preservation methods NHANES: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; UPFs: Ultra-processed food; FAO: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. UPFs AND GI DISEASE: EPIDEMIOLOGICAL VIEWPOINT Multiple cohort studies have demonstrated that higher consumption of UPFs is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and several morbidities, including coronary artery disease[ 9 10 11 12 Among the GI disorders, the association between UPFs and IBD is demonstrated by multiple studies. Large cohort studies, including PURE, Nurses’ Health Studies, NutriNet-Santé, Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite, and the United Kingdom Biobank, consistently report that individuals with higher UPFs consumption have an increased hazard ratio for Crohn’s disease (CD), even after adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, and overall diet quality. However, the association between UPFs and ulcerative colitis (UC) was generally weaker and not statistically significant in most studies[ 13 17 i.e. UPFs AND GI DISEASES: MECHANISTIC INSIGHTS The adverse impact of UPFs on GI health occurs through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. The following outlines how UPFs contribute to GI dysfunction and disease (Figure 1 Figure 1 Ultra-processed foods and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Impact on the nutritional quality of food Excessive consumption of UPFs, as classified by the NOVA system, carries important implications for human health. In developed countries, UPFs contribute up to 80% of total caloric intake, with confectionery and sugar-sweetened beverages representing the most frequently consumed categories[ 18 Patterns of UPFs consumption are closely linked to dietary habits, with higher intakes observed among individuals adhering to vegan and vegetarian diets[ 19 20 21 Role of the food matrix The concept of the \"food matrix” refers to the physical and chemical structure of a food item, including how its nutrients and non-nutrients are organized and interact within the whole food. It is increasingly recognized as more important than consideration of nutrient composition alone. Ultra-processing techniques extensively disrupt the natural food matrix[ 22 UPFs are characterized by extreme matrix degradation through the addition of cosmetic additives (such as colors, flavors, and texturizers), the extraction and purification of isolated compounds ( e.g. e.g. 22 It is important to recognize that individuals consume whole food matrices, not isolated nutrients. For example, a sugar molecule embedded within the natural matrix of an apple has markedly different metabolic effects compared to sugar dissolved in a soft drink. Ignoring the food matrix in favor of a purely nutrient-centric perspective risks oversimplification and may mislead dietary guidance. A paradigm shift toward matrix-focused assessment of foods is warranted to more accurately evaluate health impacts. Impact of food additives on gut microbiota The United States Food and Drug Administration defines a food additive as “any substance the intended use of which results, or may reasonably be expected to result-directly or indirectly, in it becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food” [Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 201(s)]. Acceptable daily intake levels for food additives are established based on lifetime exposure risk assessments conducted by expert committees such as the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Among the most commonly employed food additives are emulsifiers, low-calorie sweeteners, inorganic nanoparticles, and preservatives.  Emulsifiers: 23 etc. 24 Emulsifiers can adversely affect gut health by decreasing bacterial diversity, promoting the expansion of pro-inflammatory microbial populations, altering microbial gene expression, reducing mucus layer thickness, and impairing gut barrier integrity via  Non-nutritive sweeteners: 25 26 28 29 30 Non-nutritive sweeteners have been demonstrated to reduce microbial diversity by impairing the production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, and increase intestinal permeability, thereby activating inflammatory cascades, including the colitis-associated nuclear factor kappa-B pathway and promoting the secretion of tumor necrosis factor and MAdCAM1. Furthermore, the metabolism of food colorants by intestinal microbiota generates pro-inflammatory metabolites, such as 1-amino-2-naphthol-6-sulfonic acid sodium salt, which can drive IL-23R-dependent inflammation.

It plays a role in the metabolism of macro- and micronutrients, gut immunity, and disease susceptibility, risk, progression, and severity of disease[ 39 41 42 43 46 Four observational studies have examined the association between UPFs and the human gut microbiome[ 43 46 3 et al 43 vs et al 44 et al 46 46 Table 3 Summary of available studies on the effect of ultra-processed food on the gut microbiome[ 43 46  Ref.

Alpha and beta diversity are key ecological metrics used to study biodiversity. Alpha diversity refers to the variety of species within a particular area or ecosystem, typically expressed through species richness or indices like Shannon or Simpson. it reflects local diversity and how evenly species are distributed. Beta diversity, on the other hand, measures the difference in species composition between two or more ecosystems or habitats. It indicates the species turnover across environments and assesses the ecological variation. Alpha diversity was assessed in all studies, while beta diversity was investigated in 3 studies. Only one of the four UPFs studies showed a difference in alpha diversity, i.e. 39 Prevotella spp. 44 46 Lachnospira spp. 43 46 Ruminococcus spp. 45 46 Overall, these studies point towards the negative health outcomes associated with the consumption of UPFs. Though a reasonable clinical outcome cannot be drawn. Further studies with adequate food processing measurement, gut microbiota assessment, and relevant clinical endpoints are required before any definitive conclusion of the UPFs on the gut microbiome and health can be drawn. UPFs and impact on IBD IBD is a condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the gut mucosa. An alteration in the gut microbiota of IBD patients has been demonstrated to contribute to disease progression. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed, including decreased mucosal function, impaired intestinal barrier, and abnormal immune system activation[ 47 48 i.e. Escherichia coli, Ruminococcus gnavus Fusbobacterium spp. 49 50 Evidence that the non-nutritional components of UPFs can negatively affect the intestinal barrier is growing. Both prospective and retrospective studies have investigated this aspect with variable outcomes (Table 4 13 17 51 69 13 16 57 59 62 65 66 14 15 51 58 60 61 63 65 70 71 Table 4 Summary of available studies on the use of ultra-processed food and risk of inflammatory bowel disease[ 13 17 51 69  Ref.

Human trials of dietary emulsifier restriction The harmful effects of food emulsifiers are long established in animal studies. Among the common emulsifiers, carrageenan is most commonly studied and has properties to induce IBD in murine models. Though the human studies are still in the infancy stage, with limited available studies.

Four randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have evaluated the effect of emulsifier on the gut microbiome and IBD. Bhattacharyya et al 125 et al 126 et al 127 128 FUTURE RESEARCH The availability of a newer classification system has expanded our knowledge of the role of UPFs in various GI disorders and their associations. However, our understanding remains limited, with much still to be discovered. Future research should determine the cut-off ranges of UPFs in daily food intake and categorize them as harmful accordingly. These cut-offs should also be identified for different geographic locations and populations. More importantly, observational associations should be confirmed through randomized studies, with a concurrent focus on experimental research to understand the exact mechanisms of UPFs and GI disorders. Strategies involving dietary guidelines and recommendations for reducing UPFs consumption worldwide should be promoted. CONCLUSION GI diseases include a wide range of disorders with an incomplete understanding of etiopathogenesis. Often, these disorders are associated with a change in gut microbiota with an incompletely understood mechanism. With the recent availability of novel classification of UPFs, there is a better understanding of the link between GI disorders and UPFs. The available studies point towards higher consumption of UPFSs and increased risk of overweight and obesity, abdominal obesity, metabolic syndrome, functional GI disorders, CD, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and overall cancers. However, evidence supporting protective dietary interventions remains limited, based on small-scale studies with inconsistent findings. Secondly, the majority of the evidence is derived from Western countries, particularly Europe and North America, largely due to the availability of large, well-established cohorts in these regions. However, this geographic concentration raises concerns regarding the generalizability of the findings to populations in underrepresented regions.
