Introduction Manganese (Mn), as one of the most abundant metallic elements in the Earth’s crust, is ubiquitously distributed in the natural environment and serves as an essential trace mineral for the normal growth, development, and maintenance of cellular homeostasis in humans and a wide range of other organisms [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Mn is a trace element crucial for the reproductive system and plays a key role in reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes. Early animal research has demonstrated that Mn deficiency in the diet may lead to disrupted ovulation, testicular degeneration, and elevated offspring mortality rates. Prolonged feeding of a Mn-deficient diet in cows results in suppressed estrus, characterized by the declined conception rate, rising abortion rate, and lower birth weight of calves [ 7 8 9 10 During aerobic metabolism, living organisms maintain continuous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). When the generation rate of ROS (especially O 2 − 11 12 2 − 13 2+ 14 12 15 16 Numerous studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress is closely linked to the progression of various pathological conditions, including male infertility [ 17 18 19 20 21 The testis, as the core organ of the male reproductive system, produces sperm to maintain fertility. Additionally, it also synthesizes androgens such as testosterone, which regulate sexual development, sustain libido, promote the formation of secondary sexual characteristics, and exert systemic effects on metabolic processes and overall health. Previous research has demonstrated that Mn deficiency in male animals leads to infertility and a lack of sexual desire, accompanied by impaired testicular function, sperm deficiency, degeneration of the seminal ducts, and degeneration of epididymal cells [ 9 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animals and Treatments Some 45 3-week-old male ICR mice were obtained from Dashuo Biological Technology Company (Chengdu, China) and housed in a carefully sterilized animal facility which was maintained at a relative humidity of 55 ± 5% and a temperature of 25 ± 2 °C. The mice were randomly divided into three groups, namely, the control, Mn-deficient (MnD), and MnD + MnCl 2 2 2 22 2.2. Testis Index Mice were weighed weekly, and at the end of the feeding experiment, all mice were sacrificed by cervical decapitation under isoflurane, and testes were removed, weighed, and photographed. Testis index was calculated by testis absolute weight (mg) divided by body weight (kg) and multiply 100%. 2.3. Histopathological Observation Testis was collected and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. This was followed by dehydration with gradient ethanol and paraffin embedment of the samples. Then, the samples were cut into sections 5 μm thick and H&E-stained. A light microscope (Leica DM500, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) was adopted to observe the histopathological changes. Histopathological evaluation of testicular tissue damage and spermatogenesis was conducted using Johnsen’s testicular scoring system [ 23 2.4. Mn Content of the Testis Mouse testis tissues were obtained following the administration of the experimental treatment. Subsequently, 0.5 g of each sample was subjected to wet digestion in heat-resistant test tubes containing a mixture of 1 mL HClO 4 3 3 2.5. Sperm Quality Assessment The method for sperm quality detection was based on the research of Yang et al. [ 24 Eosin staining was performed to evaluate sperm morphology. After spreading 20-μL sperm suspension on a glass slide, it was allowed to be air-dried. Then, the slide was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 5 min and air-dried again. A 2% eosin solution was used to stain the sample for 1 h. After staining, the excess dye was washed off and the sample examined under an optical microscope (Leica DM500, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). Sperm malformations involved head defects (double, large, and broken heads), neck curvature, midpiece defects (asymmetry), and principal piece defects (short tails, double tails, irregular bends, and curls), as well as abnormally large cytoplasmic droplets. The sperm malformation rate of each sample was assessed based on the observation of at least 200 sperm. 2.6. Evaluation of Oxidative Stress in Testis Testicular tissue was mixed with an appropriate volume of ice-cold physiological saline and homogenized to prepare a 10% ( w v 2.7. Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) The Trizol reagent was adopted to extract RNA from about 50 mg of mouse testicular tissue, stored in liquid nitrogen. The isolated RNA was then subject to reverse transcription into complementary DNA (cDNA) following the guidelines provided with the reverse transcription kit and preserved at −20 °C for further use. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to amplify the target genes, including Occludin Claudin-11 zonula occludens-1 ZO-1 nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 Nrf2 Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 Keap1 junctional adhesion molecule-A JAM-A heme oxygenase-1 HO-1 Table 1 −ΔΔCt 2.8. Immunofluorescent Staining The paraffin-embedded mouse testicular tissues were sectioned into 5 μm thick slices, followed by dewaxing and gradient rehydration. Antigen retrieval was then carried out using a citrate-based antigen retrieval solution in a microwave oven. The sections were subsequently cooled to room temperature, rinsed with PBS, and dried. A goat serum-based blocking solution was applied for 30 min, after which it was carefully removed. Subsequently, the diluted primary antibodies ZO-1 (1:2000) and Occludin (1:500) were added, and the sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C. The next day, the sections were brought to room temperature, washed three times, and incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. This incubation was performed in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. The sections were then immersed in a fluorescent staining solution for 10 min to enhance signal detection. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI for 10 min in the dark. After being mounted with coverslips, the sections were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon D-Eclipse C1, Minato, Tokyo, Japan). Finally, the fluorescence intensity was quantitatively analyzed using ImageJ2 software ( http://imagej.net/Downloads 2.9. Western Blotting After thawing the mouse testicular tissues stored in liquid nitrogen, these tissues were homogenized in a RIPA lysis buffer that contained phosphatase and protease inhibitors for total protein extraction. A BCA protein assay kit (P0010S, Beyotime Technology, Shanghai, China) was used to measure the protein concentration. An amount of 30 μg of total protein was combined with loading buffer, denatured by boiling, and separated via sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (4–15%) (P0818S, Beyotime Technology, Shanghai, China). This was followed by the transfer of the resolved proteins onto a PVDF membrane. After blocking the membrane for 1 h at the room temperature, primary antibodies targeting ZO-1 (1:3000 dilution; catalog No. A0659, Abclone, Wuhan, China), Occludin (1:1000 dilution; catalog No. A2601, Abclone, Wuhan, China), JAM-A (1:5500 dilution; catalog No. A2601, Abclone, Wuhan, China), Nrf2 (1:1000 dilution; catalog No. ab137550, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), Keap1 (1:1000 dilution; catalog No. ab119403, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), HO-1 (1:1000 dilution; catalog No. ab68477, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and β-actin (1:10000 dilution; catalog No. AC026, Abclone, Wuhan, China) were used for incubation overnight at 4 °C. After being washed three times using PBST, the membrane was subject to room-temperature treatment with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) for 1.5 h. Following additional washing, an ECL chemiluminescence reagent (P0018A, Beyotime Technology, Shanghai, China) was employed to detect the protein bands. The protein bands were subsequently quantified using ImageJ2 ( http://imagej.net/Downloads 2.10. Statistical Analysis Data, in the form of mean ± standard deviation, were analyzed by variance analyses (LSD or Dunnett’s T3). SPSS software version 22.0 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) for windows was utilized to perform all statistical analyses. Differences were regarded as significant at p 3. Results 3.1.

Discussion Testicles are crucial reproductive organs in male animals responsible for sperm production and the secretion of male hormones. In this study, mice receiving a Mn-deficient diet exhibited a significant reduction in the Mn concentration in testicular tissues after five weeks. Furthermore, Mn deficiency resulted in reduced testicular volume, a lower testicular index, and structural damage to testicular tissue. Histopathological examination revealed that Mn deficiency in mice resulted in disorganization of the spermatogenic epithelium within seminiferous tubules, decreased number of spermatogenic cells at all developmental stages, decreased epithelial thickness, the presence of vacuoles between spermatogenic cells and within their cytoplasm, and a significantly lower Johnsen’s score in the testis. However, after one week of Mn supplementation, the reduction in testicular index and the histopathological damage of testicular tissue caused by Mn deficiency were alleviated. The aforementioned results demonstrate that Mn is vital for the normal development of testis. Mn deficiency can impair testicular development and induce structural abnormalities in the seminiferous tubules, whereas Mn supplementation can mitigate these adverse effects. Currently, reports on the impact of Mn deficiency on testicular development and histomorphological changes remain limited. Earlier studies have yielded findings consistent with those of the present study. For instance, Boyer et al. [ 25 Sperm density, motility and abnormality rate detection are rapid and effective methods for evaluating the reproductive development of male animals [ 24 26 27 28 2+ The blood–testis barrier (BTB), as a critical anatomical structure between seminiferous tubules and capillaries within the testis, serves as a key component in maintaining spermatogenesis [ 29 30 31 32 Occludin Claudin-1 ZO-1 JAM1 33 Mn serves as an essential cofactor for numerous biologically active enzymes. Among them, MnSOD is a Mn-dependent metalloenzyme localized in the mitochondrial matrix, where it catalyzes superoxide anion radicals to be dismutated into hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen. Consequently, Mn is vital for maintaining the antioxidant defense system of the body. Previous studies have demonstrated that Mn deficiency significantly reduces the activity of critical antioxidases, such as SOD, glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and CAT, in the heart, liver, kidneys, and pancreas of rats, thereby inducing the oxidative stress state in the organism [ 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 5. Conclusions In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Mn deficiency leads to structural damage in testicular tissue, reduced sperm quality, BTB dysfunction, and oxidative stress injury. The underlying mechanism may involve the suppression of antioxidant enzyme activity and the inhibition of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, which collectively elevate oxidative stress levels in the testis. This ultimately results in impaired testicular function, disrupted spermatogenesis, and compromised BTB integrity. These findings provide novel experimental evidence that enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive dysfunction induced by Mn deficiency.
