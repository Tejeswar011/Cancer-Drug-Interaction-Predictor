We developed a preoperative prediction model to distinguish patients requiring routine ICU admission from those who can be cared for in a post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). This retrospective cohort study included consecutive adults undergoing elective esophagectomy between January 2011 and June 2021 in the UMC Utrecht. Firth’s corrected multivariable logistic regression was used for model development and internal validation using bootstrapping was performed to obtain optimism-corrected performance metrics. Among the 619 patients included, 380 (61%) received critical care support beyond the first morning following surgery: 83 (13%) were on invasive mechanical ventilation and 338 (55%) needed cardiovascular support (with 174 [28%] receiving only low-dose norepinephrine). Predictors retained in the final model included age, diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin level, kidney function, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, tumor stadium, type of neoadjuvant therapy and surgical approach.

This includes the use of minimally invasive surgical methods, alternative anastomotic techniques (such as cervical vs intrathoracic, or hand-sewn vs stapled anastomosis) and enhanced recovery protocols after esophagectomy. 1 2 3 In the past, patients undergoing total esophageal resection with gastric pull-up were routinely admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) postoperatively and mechanically ventilated overnight to prevent aspiration, protect the airway and allow for adequate pain management during the immediate postoperative period. 4 4 , 5 6 7 7 7 METHODS This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the University Medical Center Utrecht, a tertiary academic hospital and designated major trauma center in the Netherlands. All adults undergoing elective esophagectomy between January 2011 and June 2021 were included. The preoperative work-up involved evaluation at a preanesthesia clinic, including spirometry as per European Respiratory Society and American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) guidelines, 8 We combined data from a prospectively maintained institutional surgical database, the Molecular Diagnosis and Risk Stratification of Sepsis (MARS) biorepository ( NCT01905033 9 Outcome definition We considered postoperative allocation to an ICU bed appropriate if the patient’s condition on the first day after surgery (i.e. 10–24 hours postoperatively) mandated the continued use of respiratory and/or hemodynamic support measures that are typically reserved for a critical care unit. These measures included (i) use of invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation or high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and/or (ii) continuous infusion of norepinephrine, phenylephrine, dobutamine or milrinone at any dose. Of note, in a post hoc sensitivity analysis we used a stricter definition of vasopressor support, which mandated a norepinephrine continuous infusion rate of ≥0.1 μg/kg/min (or equivalent), as lower doses of vasopressor support are commonly given outside the ICU in clinical practice (e.g. in HDUs). We considered postoperative allocation to a PACU bed appropriate if neither criterion 1 nor 2 was met, indicating respiratory and hemodynamic stability. Candidate predictors Candidate predictor variables were selected a priori, based on clinical experience and a comprehensive literature review of published risk factors for postoperative complications ( Supplementary Table 1 10–15 16 Univariable analyses were used to explore nonlinear relationships of continuous variables with the outcome using restricted cubic splines. Only the preoperative hemoglobin level clearly showed a nonlinear relationship to the outcome and was categorized with three levels: low (Hb < 7.5 mmol/L), intermediate (Hb 7.5–8.5 mmol/L) and high (Hb > 8.5 mmol/L). Missing values were observed in six variables (range 1%–9% missingness, supplementary materials 17 Statistical analysis We developed the prediction model using logistic regression analysis. We used the criteria proposed by Riley et al. Supplementary Table 2 18 19 For model fitting, we used Firth’s penalized logistic regression, which is the preferred method for model development in smaller datasets when the event per candidate predictor ratio approaches 10:1. The Firth correction shrinks the intercept and all regression coefficients individually during the initial model development process. 20 21 We evaluated model performance by assessing discriminatory ability, calibration and overall predictive accuracy. Discrimination was evaluated using the c O E 22 23 Finally, following development of the preoperative model, we studied whether it could be further improved by additionally incorporating intraoperative predictors that are known at the conclusion of surgery. The goal of this sensitivity analysis was to assess whether the need for an ICU bed predominantly depends on preoperative information or is mostly determined by intraoperative events. For development of this early postoperative (extended) model, we used a similar analytical approach to that described above. Continuous variables were compared between groups using either a two-samples t U RESULTS All 619 adult patients who had undergone an elective esophagectomy between January 2011 and June 2021 were analyzed. For logistical reasons, 13 patients had been admitted to the PACU, whereas all the others were electively admitted to the ICU following surgery. In total, 380 patients (61%) met the criteria for routine ICU admission, whereas admission to a PACU with subsequent transfer to a regular ward the next morning would have been possible for 239 (39%) patients. For the 380 patients for whom ICU care proved necessary after surgery, respiratory and/or hemodynamic support included the continued use of (a combination of) invasive mechanical ventilation in 83 (13%), noninvasive ventilation in 28 (5%), inotropes and/or high-dose vasopressors in 134 (22%) and low-dose vasopressors in 204 (33%) subjects. Of note, 174 (28%) patients received only low-dose vasopressors without respiratory support. This proportion increased after introduction of an ERAS protocol in 2016 (from 20% in 2011–2015 to 37% in 2018–2021), as did the number of on-table extubations (from 47% to 91%, respectively). Patients who required postoperative allocation to an ICU bed were older and had more cardiovascular comorbidities then remaining subjects ( Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 Characteristics of esophagectomy patients with and without postoperative ICU dependency ICU dependency n PACU eligible n  P  Preoperative patient characteristics Age (years) 68 [62–73] 65 [56–70] <0.001 Sex at birth (M), n 271 (71) 185 (77) 0.110 BMI (kg/m 2 25 [22–27] 25 [23–28] 0.230 ASA score, n 261 (70) 187 (79) 0.020 COPD, n 54 (14) 31 (13) 0.750 Cardiovascular comorbidity * n 87 (23) 37 (16) 0.030 Diabetes mellitus, n 47 (12) 36 (15) 0.400 Hypertension, n 134 (35) 78 (33) 0.560 Smoking history, n 90 (24) 45 (19) 0.190  Preoperative biomarkers Hemoglobin (mmol/L) 7.8 [7.2–8.6] 8.1 [7.4–8.6] 0.040 Kidney function, n 325 (91) 218 (95) 0.100 FEV1 (%pred) 98 [83–109] 100 [88–113] 0.030 Tiffenau index (%pred) 97 [87–104] 98 [90–104] 0.180  Surgical characteristics Tumor location, n 46 (12) 40 (17) 0.020 Type of neoadjuvant therapy, n 58 (15) 31 (13) <0.001 Type of surgery, n 62 (16) 24 (10) 0.040 Surgical approach, n 310 (82) 172 (72) 0.010  Procedural information Duration of surgery (hours) 6.4 [5.4–7.4] 6.2 [5–7.2] 0.020 Type of anastomosis, n 288 (77) 188 (79) 0.530 Any intraoperative complication, n 42 (11) 18 (8) 0.150 Conversion to open procedure, n 14 (4) 6 (3) 0.570 Estimated blood loss, n 304 (80) 204 (85.5) 0.020 At least one unit of RBC needed, n 40 (11) 6 (3) <0.001 Lowest intraoperative pH 7.27 [7.22–7.31] 7.28 [7.23–7.33] 0.060 Intraoperative saturation < 90% for ≥10 minutes, n 133 (35) 77 (32) 0.530 On-table extubation, n 267 (70) 159 (67) 0.370  Postoperative course Hospital length of stay (days) 15 [11–24] 12 [10–19] <0.001 Unplanned ICU (re)admission † n 57 (15) 37 (15) 0.960 (Any) Reintubation, n 57 (15) 37 (15) 0.960 In-hospital mortality, n 18 (5) 6 (3) 0.240 Results are presented as median [IQR] for continuous variables and counts (%) for categorical variables. * † Model development After backward selection of candidate predictors, the final model included advanced age, presence of diabetes mellitus, preoperative hemoglobin level < 7.5 mmol/L, lower preoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), tumor stage ≥ 3, neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (vs either chemoradiation therapy or no neoadjuvant therapy), open (vs minimally invasive) procedure and transthoracic (vs transhiatal) approach ( Table 2 c O E Fig. 1a,b c O E Table 3 Table 2 Preoperative prediction model to distinguish patients requiring elective ICU admission from patients that can be cared for in a PACU following esophagectomy Term  β 95% CI OR 95% CI Intercept −1.82 −2.80 to 0.85 0.16 0.06–0.43 Age in years 0.05 0.04–0.07 1.06 1.04–1.07 Diabetes −0.38 −0.69 to 0.07 0.68 0.50–0.93 Preoperative Hb < 7.5 mmol/L 0.38 0.16–0.59 1.46 1.18–1.81 Preoperative FEV1 (%) −0.01 −0.02 to −0.007 0.99 0.98–0.99 Tumor stage ≥ 3 * 0.30 0.09–0.51 1.35 1.09–1.66 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy † −0.94 −1.31 to -0.57 0.39 0.27–0.57 Open procedure ‡ 0.60 0.33–0.88 1.83 1.39–2.41 Transhiatal approach § −0.69 −0.98 to -0.41 0.50 0.38–0.66  * † ‡ § Fig. 1 Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and calibration plot of final model before internal validation.

Adjusted estimates show optimism-corrected values obtained by bootstrapping (using 500 iterations). Patient disposition We used a predicted probability cutoff < 0.78 to mark patients for elective admission to the PACU instead of ICU, simulating a 50% reduction in preoperative ICU bed allocations compared to our default strategy (i.e. allocating all patients postoperatively to an ICU). At this decision threshold, the model selected a total of 296 (48%) patients for postoperative recovery at the PACU, of whom 139 (47%, 22% of total cohort) would need to be relocated to the ICU later because they required respiratory and/or cardiovascular support beyond the first morning after surgery. Of note, only 34 (24%) of these patients required continued mechanical ventilation, whereas 68 (49%) merely received low-dose vasopressor support, a therapy that could potentially have been provided at another HDU. Overall, this implies that 25%–42% of ICU beds may be conserved using our model, depending on the local hospital situation (i.e. the various resources available at different wards). A more extensive exploration of various decision thresholds is provided in Supplementary File 4 Updated model with intraoperative information When updating the model with intraoperative information, the model included the same predictors as the preoperative model, but hemoglobin level < 7.5 mmol/L was replaced by intraoperative transfusion. This did not yield improved model performance (adjusted c O E Supplementary File 3 DISCUSSION At least one-third of patients (and possibly two-thirds if low-dose vasopressor therapy can be delivered elsewhere) do not need admission to an ICU following esophagectomy. Correctly identifying these patients would result in more judicious use of scarce ICU resources. Although our prediction model has only moderate discriminatory performance, it can still decrease elective postoperative ICU bed utilization by approximately 50%, albeit with the consequence of having to reallocate a substantial number of subjects from the PACU to either an HDU or ICU the next day, depending on the local situation. While advances in perioperative care for esophagectomy patients—such as early extubation and enhanced recovery protocols—have prompted reconsideration of routine ICU admission practices, 7 3 24 7 Until now, no validated tools have been available to support such risk-based management. Although some prognostic studies have identified predictors such as ASA ≥ 3, a Charlson comorbidity index ≥ 2, absence of neoadjuvant therapy, transthoracic or hybrid surgery, cervical anastomosis and occurrence of intraoperative complications as potential risk factors for prolonged ICU admission (>1 day) in univariable analysis, these were mostly identified through univariate analyses. 15 , 24 To ensure the universal applicability of our model, we used a strict definition of ICU care that encompassed any level of respiratory and/or hemodynamic support. According to these criteria, 39% of patients were fit for discharge to a regular nursing ward the morning after surgery. However, it is important to note that 28% of all patients merely received infusion of norepinephrine at rates < 0.1 mcg/kg/min. Using our model, we observed that 49% of patients that were misallocated to the PACU also only received low-dose norepinephrine, which may be administered in a variety of HDU settings. Postoperative care for esophagectomy patients varies significantly across hospitals and countries, including preferences for restrictive versus more liberal fluid administration, HDU availability and protocols for routine ICU stays. 25 15 Our study has limitations. First, this was a retrospective cohort study, which resulted in some missing data. Since we considered these variables to be missing at random and easy to obtain in clinical practice, we performed multiple imputation by chained equation to impute the missing data. Second, our study cohort spanned over a decade, during which significant advances were made in the care for esophagectomy patients. Importantly, minimally invasive procedures have largely replaced open thoracotomies (from 24% earlier to just 5% in recent years). In fact, adding the calendar year to the model captured essentially the same information as the minimally invasive versus open procedure variable (data not shown), which is a key predictor in our model. As minimally invasive techniques become more standard practice, this reinforces our premise that routine postoperative ICU care can be replaced by PACU admission in many cases. However, we noted an increasing trend in vasopressor dependency over the years, which likely reflects heightened attention to blood pressure management. Finally, our model was developed based on data from a single center. As discussed above, there is considerable variation in the postoperative care for these patients, both within the Netherlands and internationally. Therefore, this model should be locally validated in these different settings before clinical use. CONCLUSION Over a third of esophagectomy patients do not require routine postoperative ICU admission. An additional third receive only low-dose vasopressor support, suggesting that care outside the ICU may be appropriate in settings with suitable infrastructure. Our prediction model could therefore support more efficient perioperative bed allocation and potentially reduce ICU bed claims by up to 50%.
