Cellular senescence, a state linked to cell cycle arrest, represents a potential therapeutic strategy for cancer. However, the clinical impact and regulatory mechanism of cellular senescence in HCC remains incompletely unknown. We identified HCC associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using bioinformatics analysis of public databases (TCGA, GEO, GEPIA, etc.). Enrichment, prognostic, risk scoring models analyses revealed cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) as a core senescence-related gene. CDK1 expression was upregulated in HCC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis of HCC patients. In addition, CDK1 knockdown significantly increased senescence markers (the level or activity of P16, P21, and SA-β-gal), and induced cellular senescence in HepG2 cells. Molecular docking demonstrated high-affinity binding between CDK1 and kaempferol (KAE; affinity = −9.7 kcal/mol). KAE treatment similarly increased senescence markers and promoted cellular senescence in HepG2 cells. Mechanistically, KAE reduced CDK1 protein levels by promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. These findings indicated that KAE might induce cellular senescence through CDK1 ubiquitination, providing potential drugs and targets for HCC treatment.

Recent researches showed that targeting senescence pathways provide therapeutic benefits in malignancies including liver cancer [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 CIP1 23 24 25 26 Kaempferol (KAE), a natural flavonoid abundant in fruits and vegetables, exhibits broad-spectrum antitumor activity against various cancers [ 27 28 29 30 31 In this study, we identified CDK1 as a core regulatory protein in the development and progression of HCC, and its correlation with immune cell infiltration. Subsequent GO and KEGG revealed that CDK1 and its associated protein networks are functionally enriched in cellular senescence pathways in HCC. Experimental validation showed elevated CDK1 expression in HCC patient tissues. CDK1 overexpression suppressed cellular senescence, whereas its knockdown promoted this process in HepG2 cells. We also found that KAE has a high affinity for CDK1, triggering its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation, reduced CDK1 protein levels, which ultimately induced senescence and suppressing HCC progression. These findings suggested that KAE and CDK1 could serve as promising therapeutic drugs and targets for HCC intervention.

The secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (HRP) (Abcam, ab6721, 1:10000). β-actin was the internal control. Protein bands were detected by an ECL kit (EpiZyme, China) and visualized with a ChemiDoc imaging system (BioRad, USA). The intensity of each band was quantified by Image J. Ubiquitination analysis Cells were lyzed with ice-cold IP lysis buffer to obtain the supernatant containing total proteins.

Subsequently, these proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-rabbit Ub (Abcam, ab7780, 1:1000). Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) assay SA-β-gal staining was performed using an SA-β-gal staining kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, China; Cat#C0602) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. After washing with PBS three times, samples were incubated in SA-β-gal solution at 37 °C for 18 h.

GO analysis indicated these genes involved in mitotic cell cycle phase transition, nuclear division, and cyclin-dependent protein kinase regulation (Figs. 4 4  Fig. 4 CDK1 regulated HCC progression by inducing cellular senescence.

The findings of are highly consistent with those of other researchers [ 13 35 36 37 37 KAE, a tetrahydroxy-flavonoid, exhibits anticancer properties by promoting cancer cell apoptosis, inhibiting cancer metastasis, and reducing drug resistance and side effects [ 27 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 CDK1, a key kinase at cell cycle checkpoint serves as an effective potential therapeutic target for cancers. Dinaciclib, a CDK1 specific inhibitor, induces senescence by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction and increasing mitochondrial ROS in patient-derived 2D and 3D glioblastoma cell models [ 45 CIP1 23 20 46 Cellular senescence has a “double-edged sword” effect in HCC progression, exerting both anti-tumor and pro-tumor effects. In the early stages of HCC, senescence in damaged hepatocytes prevents malignant transformation, whereas in advanced preclinical models, the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) remodels the tumor microenvironment to facilitate progression. lncRNA NEAT1 deficiency increased senescence in HCC tissue and HepG2 cells, accelerating HCC progression [ 47 48 49 The degradation of CDK1, a subunit of the CDK1/cyclin B kinase complex, is essential for kinase inactivation and mitotic exit. In eukaryotic cells, selective protein degradation primarily occurs through the autophagy-lysosome and ubiquitin-proteasome systems [ 50 51 52 53 54 55 This study lacks sufficient experimental evidence to confirm KAE-CDK1 binding or identify their interaction sites. The E3 ubiquitin ligase mediating KAE-induced CDK1 ubiquitination also remains unidentified. In addition, further study is required to identify the dominant cell death pathway responsible for KAE-induced cytotoxicity, whether apoptosis, autophagy, senescence or ferroptosis. Subsequent research will investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of KAE through animal experiments. Conclusions Here, we demonstrate that KAE promotes CDK1 ubiquitination and degradation, thereby reducing CDK1 levels and inducing cellular senescence, which suggests its therapeutic potential for HCC.
