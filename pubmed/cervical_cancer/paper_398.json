Yet, there is a dearth of frameworks grounded in nursing practice that articulate this role, particularly in driving sustainable change. Aim This study aimed to describe the diverse forms and strategies used in nurse-led advocacy, to develop a conceptual framework for fostering sustainable healthcare practices and nurse-led change from the bedside to the system-level. Method A descriptive qualitative design was used to describe how nurse-led advocacy is manifested in the stories of RCN-UK ‘Nurse of the Year’ 2016–2023 awardees. The Framework Method was applied to analyse seven publicly available nurse-led advocacy initiatives. The analysis involved familiarisation, identification of a thematic framework, indexing, charting, mapping and interpretation to synthesise key advocacy dimensions. Findings The analysis resulted in the development of the TRIL Nurse Advocacy Model. This novel thematic framework posits that nurse-led advocacy comprises three interconnected pillars: Transformative Action, Relational Co-design and Institutional Legacy. Transformative action highlights the nurses’ capacity for crisis-responsive innovations, people-centred transformations, advancing health equity, and revisioning practice standards. Relational Co-design underscores the importance of cross-sector partnership, community-led empowerment, and workforce inspiration. Institutional Legacy emphasises the critical role of policy and resource formalisation, and sustainable system integration in ensuring lasting impact. The model also recognises the reality of the context of barriers, which underscores the need for strategic navigation to overcome systemic resistance, thereby creating sustainable healthcare. Conclusion The TRIL Nurse Advocacy Model provides a comprehensive lens for advancing nurse-led advocacy. It offers significant implications for nursing education by guiding curriculum development to cultivate advocacy skills. It also impacts policy by highlighting the contributions of nurses to systemic change, and in practice, by empowering nurses to strategically plan and evaluate their initiatives toward building resilient and sustainable healthcare systems.

Generally, it refers to the speaking up, supporting and empowering of marginalised and vulnerable individuals and groups [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 12 11 12 By addressing the social determinants of health and promoting health equity through establishing programmes to improve access to care, community mobilisation and direct patient care [ 13 The Royal College of Nurses (RCN) in the United Kingdom (UK) has over the years recognised and celebrated nurses who demonstrate extraordinary leadership, innovation, and impacts patient care and the broader healthcare system through their annual ‘Nurse of the Year’ awards. The awardees are distinguished nurses whose work of advocacy and service not only exemplifies excellence at the bedside but also extends to driving systematic change and influencing policy. Consequently, the feature stories on their award-winning initiatives offers invaluable insights into nurse-led advocacy and serve as case studies. By systematically analysing advocacy practices enacted by these nurses, we can identify patterns that can be utilised to empower nurses with knowledge on the strategies, conditions, and leadership traits that enable nurses to act as effective advocates. It can also inform the development of a practical framework to guide and strengthen nursing advocacy for sustainable healthcare outcomes. Purpose The study aimed to describe the diverse forms and strategies used in nurse-led advocacy to develop a conceptual framework for fostering sustainable healthcare practices and nurse-led change from the bedside to the system level. Research questions The study was guided by the questions:  “How is nurse-led advocacy for sustainable healthcare manifested by the ‘Nurse of the Year’ awardees feature stories? How can the diverse forms and strategies of nurse-led advocacy be conceptualised into a comprehensive framework for sustainable healthcare? Methodology Design The study employed the descriptive qualitative research approach to describe how nurse-led advocacy for sustainable healthcare is manifested by nurses to inform the development of a robust nurse-led advocacy framework that can empower nurses to effect meaningful change as well as foster solutions from the bedside to the system level. Setting The contextual backdrop is the RCN-UK, which is a registered trade union and professional body in the UK for those in the nursing profession. The RCN-UK awards are the UK’s national award to celebrate the professionalism of nurses, student nurses and support workers who define the nursing profession. Each selected features story represents a distinct nursing environment, ranging from hospital-based care to community health, and offers a snapshot of nurse-led practices in diverse institutional and service delivery contexts. Document and sampling procedure The study focused on the feature stories of the ‘Nurse of the Year’ awardees published by the RCN UK. The subject of interest was the advocacy activities of individuals who have received the RCN UK ‘Nurse of the Year’ award. The unit of analysis was each individual feature story. Purposive sampling was used to select feature stories of RCN UK ‘Nurse of the Year’ awardees officially published by the RCN or its recognised affiliates. The inclusion criteria included; awardee must have received the ‘Nurse of the Year’ award during the periods of 2014–2024; the feature story should present substantial description of the nurse’s advocacy roles and its impact on service delivery as well as being published in English. Feature stories was excluded if the full text was unavailable online or the awardee was not a nurse by profession. We focused on a 10-year period of analysis to ensure recency and relevance of the stories to the purpose of the study. The 2024 story was excluded because there was no full text of the feature story for RCN UK ‘Nurse of the Year’ but of individual countries like Wales, Scotland etc. Two awardees’ stories (2014–2015) were also excluded because the full texts were not available online, while the 2018 feature story was excluded because the awardee was not a nurse but a celebrity awardee. A total of seven feature stories of awardees were included in the final analysis. Data collection To begin, systematic identification and screening of the feature stories that documented the professional contributions of each of the nurse awardees was done. Following this, the inclusion criteria were applied to screen the data for eligible stories. The full texts of eligible feature stories were downloaded and reviewed to identify the profiles, advocacy journey and outcomes. The feature stories that were selected were subsequently formatted into a standard textual format for the purposes of analysis. No direct interaction with the awardees or additional data collection was conducted beyond what is available online in the Nursing Times, Nursing Management and their affiliate online sites. Data analysis The data was analysed utilising the Framework Method, an analytical technique formulated by Ritchie and Spencer [ 14 15 Initial indexing was done by systematically labelling relevant text from the feature stories with thematic code from the analytic framework. The indexed data was conceptually re-organised and presented under three new core categories and their nine merged sub-categories, which served as the final analytic framework: The TRIL Nurse Advocacy Model. This refined model categorises nurse-led advocacy into Transformative Action, Relational Co-design and Institutional Legacy. Following the finalisation of the TRIL framework, it was methodologically applied across the entire dataset by aligning pertinent codes or annotations to relevant segments of the text using ATLAS.ti to develop a matrix in a process known as Charting (Table S-1 To finalise the analytical procedure, the researchers conducted mapping and interpretation by identifying patterns, relationships, and connections among themes. This resulted in the formulation of explanations and components constituting the nurse-led advocacy framework. Trustworthiness Trustworthiness of the study findings was ensured by applying the criteria of credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability proposed by Lincoln and Guba [ 16 Findings Characteristics of nurse leaders and their advocacy initiatives All the awardees were females. Their nursing roles varied across specialties, with the least years of experience in their roles being 6 years at the time of the award. The scope of most of the nurses’ initiatives was at the population (3/7) and organisational (3/7) levels, with only one initiative targeted at regional/systemic change. Concerning level of advocacy, a slight majority of initiatives (3/7) were directed at community and public health, while an equal number (2/7) were targeted at service delivery and organisational levels, respectively.

Table 2  Table 2 The thematic framework of the TRIL nurse advocacy model Pillars Sub-category Transformative Action • Crises-Responsive Innovation • People-centred Service Transformation • Advancing Health Equity, • Advancing Practice Standards and Quality. Relational Co-design • Cross-Sector Partnership, • Community-Led Empowerment • Workforce Inspiration and Development. Institutional Legacy • Policy and Resource Formalisation • Sustainable System Integration Pillar one: transformative action This pillar represents the innovative and proactive efforts initiated by the nurses to fundamentally reshape healthcare delivery and address critical needs or persistent health inequalities. Four sub-categories emerged from the analysis; Crises-Responsive Innovation; Patient-Centered Service Transformation; Advancing Health Equity and Advancing Practice Standards and Quality • Crises-responsive innovation From the feature stories, it was evident that the nurses recognised unmet patient needs, system inefficiencies and societal crises, and chose to respond through advocacy in line with their professional ethics. The nurses leveraged their knowledge, skills and experiences to not only speak-up and support decisions but also to provide innovative solutions to address the crises. For instance, Bailey (2021) established the “Rose Clinic” to ensure access to early medical abortion during the pandemic-induced travel restrictions. Similarly, Waddington (2020) founded “YourStance” to equip vulnerable youth with life-saving skills in direct response to rising crises of knife crime in London and the lack of bystander intervention. While Bunce (2022) initiated “Compassionate Inverclyde” by mobilising community kindness to address social isolation in times of acute loneliness. • Patient-centered service transformation This refers to the nurse-led advocacy efforts that focused primarily on reshaping health service delivery with the patient’s individual needs, preferences and experiences at the core of the design and delivery. This was evident in the feature stories of Davies (2017), who transformed the care of patients with learning disabilities by crafting individualised care plans and communication tools that ensured dignified care in general hospitals, moving away from the one-size-fits-all approach. Roye (2023) also co-produced strategies to improve cervical cancer screening uptake to meet the specific needs of the diverse and marginalised groups in her vicinity. Similarly, Wynter-Blyth (2016) also incorporated a digital platform for personalised support to improve outcomes for cancer patients. • Advancing health equity The stories highlighted the fact that, the nurses’ motivation for undertaking the transformative action was the pursuit of health equity. Roye (2023) specifically targeted underserved populations with tailored cervical screening services to overcome the barriers like language and trauma. Waddington (2020) also delivered the “YourStance” workshops directly to young people in high-risk boroughs and challenging environments, thus addressing the systemic inequalities related to youth violence. Likewise, Davies (2017) directed her advocacy by addressing systemic neglect and health disparities faced by people living with disabilities, ensuring dignified and quality care. • Advancing practice standards and quality In this model, the sub-category refers to the nurse-led advocacy efforts that focus on fostering a culture that prioritises ongoing refinements to establish adherence to new, quality, effective benchmarked standards. The nurses’ advocacy efforts moved isolated improvements to embed a continuous drive for high standards. Matare (2019) exemplified this by expanding nursing roles and integrating services to create an organisational culture that was committed to delivering gold standards of care, optimising patient flow and experience. Also, Davis (2017), through her advocacy for persons living with disabilities, ensured a shift that encouraged continuous adherence and refinement across the practice to prevent future avoidable deaths. Additionally, Wynter-Blyth (2016) with her PREPARE programme also cultivated an environment where improved surgical outcomes became the norm, demonstrating that re-envisioned pre-operative pathway was effective in elevating and sustaining quality patient outcomes. These nurses, through their actions, not only set new standards but also cultivated the commitment within their teams to maintain and continually strive for higher benchmarks. Pillar two: Relational Co-design Relational Co-design within the TRIL Nurse Advocacy Model refers to the strategic nurse-led advocacy that involves building diverse partnerships and empowering stakeholders through collaborative, co-productive processes to achieve shared healthcare goals. The pillar emphasises trust-building, communication and shared responsibility in driving change. Three sub-categories were developed: Cross-Sector Partnership Community-Led Empowerment Workforce Inspiration and Development • Cross-sector partnership This sub-category describes the nurse-led advocacy efforts characterised by intentional formation of collaborative alliances and work relationships with diverse stakeholders. In their quest to advocate, the nurses’ showed adeptness at forging partnerships and identifying collaborators across sectors. Bunce (2022) exemplified this by building a network that included faith groups, voluntary bodies, healthcare professionals, businesses and the police. Waddington (2020) also developed and delivered the “YourStance” curriculum through extensive collaboration with the Metropolitan Police Service, London Ambulance Service, and trauma surgeons, and thus fostering an inter-agency collaboration. Moreover, Bailey (2021) worked closely with the local charity, Informing Choices NI, to navigate the complex political landscape to sustain the Rose Clinic. While Roye (2023) actively engaged diverse patient groups, community leaders and interpreters in the co-design for the smear test improvement and thus, built trust with previously marginalised and underserved groups. • Community-led empowerment A core feature of relational advocacy was the active empowerment of communities. In this model, community-led empowerment refers to the nurse-led advocacy efforts where nurses actively mobilise, engage, and empower community members to take ownership and lead in the co-design and implementation of solutions to address local challenges. The feature stories highlights how Bunce (2022) not only mobilised thousands of community volunteers but also deliberately sought their inputs through public meetings, thus, enabling local ownership of solutions. Through her advocacy efforts, Waddington (2020) promoted dialogue and breaking down barriers existing between the youth and the emergency services by directly empowering them to become active partners in their safety and well-being. Davis (2017) also engaged and empowered families of patients with learning disabilities as central partners in care planning, ensuring their voices were integral in decision-making. • Workforce inspiration and development Within the TRIL Nurse Advocacy Model, the sub-category describes the nurse-led advocacy efforts where nurses actively cultivate, motivate and empower their teams and broader professional colleagues through mentorship, training and fostering an environment that encourages professional growth and shared leadership. The analysis revealed that the nurses excelled at inspiring and developing the capacities of their teams and the broader healthcare workforce. Matare (2019) promoted a culture shift in her unit by empowering the staff to challenge bullying and to take on new leadership roles. She also invested in training nurses for the extended clinical roles and thus, developed their professional capabilities. Waddington also exemplifies this sub-category by delivering sessions to healthcare staff on serious youth violence and by this action, addressing critical issues such as compassion fatigue among her peers. Furthermore, Bunce (2022), through her advocacy drive, served as a role model by sharing her “12-steps guide” for establishing her compassionate communities, thereby inspiring and enabling other nurses to replicate her model. Pillar three: institutional legacy The third construct of the TRIL Nurse Advocacy Model is Institutional Legacy. It focuses on ensuring that nurse-led advocacy efforts are integrated within the health system through the development of policies, protocols and guidelines as well as the allocation of resources to achieve sustainable healthcare. Two sub-categories emerged during the analysis: Policy and Resource Formalisation Sustainable System Integration. • Policy and resource formalisation This sub-category highlights how nurses actively engaged in advocacy to ensure that their innovative practices and services became official policies and received the necessary resources to facilitate their integration within the health system. This was to ensure the longevity of nurse-led initiatives within the healthcare delivery system. The feature stories highlights Bailey’s (2021) sustained advocacy through the Rose Clinic by directly contributing to evidence that influenced the Northern Ireland government to issue a directive for commissioned abortion services, leading to policy integration. Matare (2019) also lobbied for, and successfully secured funding for additional staff and formalised new staffing models within her ophthalmology department, and thereby, institutionalising vital resources. Wynter-Blyth (2016), through the noticeable success of her PREPARE programme, saw the wider adoption within the cancer care pathway, hence, influencing broader institutional practice. • Sustainable system integration The sub-category denotes the creation of changes that were scalable, replicable and permanently integrated into the healthcare system, ensuring a lasting impact. In this study, the nurses actively advocated for and engineered the widespread adoption of their initiatives, ensuring that these changes became seamlessly integrated into the healthcare system. For instance, Wynter-Blynth (2016), through her persistent advocacy, ensured her PREPARE programme, with its digital companion, demonstrated high scalability prompting its widespread integration into surgical pathways across different trusts. Matare also actively championed the transformation of her unit into a “one-stop eye care centre” with expanded nurse roles, thereby advocating for a more efficient and integrated system that ensures sustainable “gold standard” service delivery. Similarly, Waddington (2020) advocated for the expansion of her “YourStance” programme, which resulted in its integration into public health and emergency preparedness, while contributing to community resilience and life-saving impacts. Context of barriers: navigating challenges in nurse-led advocacy While the TRIL model demonstrates the manifestations of nurse-led advocacy, it is important to recognise that these initiatives consistently unfolded within a challenging environment, characterised by numerous barriers which ranged from political and systemic hurdles to resource limitations and deep-seated societal stigmas. The nurses, however, demonstrated resilience and strategic acumen by identifying, confronting and overcoming these obstacles. For instance, Bailey (2021) navigated significant political resistance and legal issues to establish the Rose clinic in that era. Matare (2019) also faced years of bureaucratic hurdles and resource scarcity in her persistent effort to secure additional staffing and funding. Waddington also had to overcome initial scepticism and build trust with the communities and institutions affected by the youth violence. These barriers, though not a pillar of action, served as critical contextual factors that necessitated the transformative, relational and institutional strategies the nurses employed. The nurses’ success often hinged on their ability to strategically navigate and manoeuver through, as well as mitigate the impact of these pervasive contextual challenges. Discussion The study aimed to develop a comprehensive framework for nurse-led advocacy, culminating in the TRIL Nurse Advocacy Model. The findings highlight the multifaceted and interconnected nature of nurse advocacy, extending beyond bedside patient care to encompass systemic, collaborative and enduring efforts to sustainable healthcare. The TRIL Model, comprising three pillars, Transformative Action, Relational Co-design and Institutional Legacy, offers a lens through which we understand, plan and evaluate the efforts of nurse-led advocacy in contributing to sustainable healthcare, in the face of Context of Barriers. The emergence of the TRIL Nurse Advocacy Model highlights the fact that nursing advocacy is a dynamic and proactive force for change, that is strongly built on the profession’s mandate to promote patients’ wellbeing and health equity. This observation aligns with the core tenets of the nursing professional code, which identifies advocacy as a core nursing responsibility [ 12 13 17 19 20 13 Unlike conventional views of nursing advocacy, which limit the nurses’ role to the act of representation and mediation by speaking up for individuals, communities or causes, and empowering marginalised groups, the TRIL Model details how nurse-led advocacy manifests in practice. It highlights the types of actions taken, such as the nurses’ strategic engagement in crises-responsive innovation, patient-centered transformation, and the promotion of health equity. In addition to these, it showcases nurses’ pivotal role in advancing practice standards and qualities through the initiation of systemic improvements in response to the identified gaps. Furthermore, the Relational Co-design pillar reveals the inherent collaborative nature of effective nurse advocacy. It emphasises the fact that nursing advocacy rarely achieves significant change in isolation but thrives on human interaction, empathy, intentional networking, partnership building and empowerment of stakeholders. This highlights the concept of relational advocacy which focuses on building connections, and collaborating with diverse stakeholders. The relational nature requires nurses move beyond simply speaking on behalf of communities to actively engaging them in the design and implementation of solutions thereby ensuring their empowerment. Pellegrini and Lovati [ 21 22 Also, the Institutional Legacy pillar highlights the critical importance of ensuring nurse-led advocacy efforts translate into integration within the healthcare systems. Through Policy and Resource Formalisation and Sustainable System Integration, nurse leaders in this study actively worked to sustain new practices, secure sustained funding and integrate successful initiatives into the operational procedures and policies. This aspect of nursing advocacy is essential for moving beyond temporal solutions to create more resilient and sustainable healthcare systems. Farquharson, therefore, intimates the need to mentor nurses in grantsmanship and in leading funded projects to ensure the sustainability of their advocacy initiatives [ 23 Finally, although nurse-led advocacy is transformative and collaborative, there exists a complex myriad of inherent challenges and obstacles that nurses who undertake this venture face. The findings revealed that the “Nurse of the Year” awardees frequently encountered barriers that necessitated strategic approaches and resilience to achieve their advocacy goals. These contextual factors highlight the demanding environment in which nurses operate and underscore the importance of the advocacy strategies outlined in the TRIL Model. Primary barriers identified in this study include political and bureaucratic resistance, where participants described significant hurdles stemming from rigid institutional hierarchies, complex approval processes and political oppositions, often requiring navigation and overcoming resistance from stakeholders with vested interests in maintaining the status quo. Resource limitations were pervasive, encompassing insufficient funding, inadequate staffing levels and a lack of dedicated time for advocacy activities. These compelled the nurses to be highly creative in leveraging existing, limited resources or tirelessly advocating for new allocations. Another contextual barrier was organisational resistance to change, which was ingrained in the organisational culture. This often resulted in scepticism towards innovations and a preference for familiar routines. This resistance to change negatively impacted the nurses’ ability to change the mindset of the organisational members. These identified barriers underscored that nurse-led advocacy is not merely about identifying problems and proposing solutions, but also about the strategic navigation and overcoming of systemic resistance. The effectiveness of the Transformative Action, Relational Co-design and Institutional Legacy pillars within the TRIL Model is often demonstrated through the successful mitigation or circumvention of these challenges. Implications for practice, education and policy The TRIL Nurse Advocacy Model provides an actionable framework with clear implications for nursing practice, education and policy. It demonstrate how nurses can overcome the perceived lack of influence within the health system and drive sustainable change. For nursing practice, the model offers a practical guide for nurses at all levels to enhance their advocacy efforts by providing a structured lens to assess current strengths, identify areas for development, and strategically plan their initiatives. It reframes influence as being cultivated from the ground up, not just from formal positions of authority. The three pillars, Transformative Action, Relational Co-design, and Institutional Legacy offers a clear roadmap for nurses to achieve lasting impact. Through Transformative Action even nurses without formal authority can lead a quality improvement project and scale it through Relational Co-design, by building collaborative partnerships to gain buy-in and expand the initiative. Finally, these nurses can work to ensure that their initiatives are embedded into formal policy or practice standards through institutional legacy, ensuring the change becomes part of the established way of doing things. For nursing education, the model is valuable tool for informing nursing curricula, particularly in leadership, public health and policy courses. It provides students with the knowledge of advocacy beyond individual patient care, offering a structured framework to conceptualise, teach, and evaluate nurse-led advocacy efforts. Grounded in real-world narratives of nurse leaders, the model provides empirical examples that make the complex process of advocacy tangible and relatable for aspiring nurses. For health policy, the TRIL Model provides a clear language and structure for nurses to articulates their contributions to systematic change, enabling them to advocate more effectively for policies that support nurse-led initiatives and innovations. It offers a framework for health systems to recognise and support grassroots advocacy, which can lead to embedding positive changes and ensuring their sustainability and formal recognition. The model’s focus on sustainable system integration provides a basis for influencing policy and securing resources by demonstrating that nurse-led change can result in demonstrable life-saving impact. Limitations of the study While the study provides a robust thematic framework for nurse advocacy, certain limitations should be acknowledged. The authors acknowledge that publicly published data especially award feature stories often highlights only achievements and positive outcomes. Thus, the study may not represent the everyday advocacy efforts of most nurses. As a qualitative study utilising Framework Method, the findings are derived from a specific dataset and context, which may limit the generalisability of the findings to all settings. Conclusion The TRIL Nurse Advocacy Model represents a significant contribution to the understanding of the dynamic and multifaceted nature of nurse-led advocacy for sustainable healthcare. By defining Transformative Action, Relational Co-design and Institutional Legacy, while recognising the context of barriers, the model provides a robust framework for conceptualising, analysing and advancing the role of nurses in shaping resilient, equitable and people-centred healthcare systems.
