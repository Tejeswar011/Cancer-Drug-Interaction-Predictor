China is facing a more severe challenge from NCDs than ever before, which not only places enormous pressure on the public health system but also significantly hinders economic development and the achievement of sustainable development goals. Objective Scientifically sound policies can provide a supportive environment for the prevention and control of NCDs. Therefore, this study aims to identify the strengths and weaknesses of current policies through a multidimensional analysis of policy texts, and to propose corresponding policy recommendations. The goal is to enhance the government's capacity and effectiveness in NCD governance, improve the health level of the entire society, and provide policy insights for China and other countries suffering from NCD burdens. Methods This study adopts the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model, content analysis method, and the Policy Modeling Consistency (PMC) model to conduct a multidimensional evaluation of 50 NCD-related policy documents issued by the Chinese government from 2009 to 2025, focusing on three dimensions: policy themes, policy instruments, and policy effectiveness. Results (1) LDA analysis identified six key policy themes: primary healthcare, health promotion, health equity, healthcare reform and regulation, NCD prevention and control, and public health governance. (2) There was a clear structural imbalance in the use of the three types of policy instruments: supply-type (49.1%), environment-type (36.4%), and demand-type (14.4%). (3) The PMC model was applied to 9 representative policies. Among these, 4 were rated “excellent” and 5 “acceptable,” with an average PMC score of 6.19, indicating moderate internal consistency and scientific design, yet with considerable variance in quality across policies. Conclusion China's NCD policy framework shows generally sound structure and intent. However, imbalances in tool application, limited demand-side engagement, and insufficient cross-sectoral coordination remain challenges. Enhancing interdisciplinary integration, strengthening incentives, and promoting stakeholder collaboration are essential for optimizing NCD governance. chronic disease/prevention and control health policy public health policy making content analysis The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

In 2021, at least 43 million deaths worldwide were attributed to NCDs, accounting for 75% of all non-pandemic-related deaths globally. In China, the situation is even more severe, with 91% of deaths and 86.7% of disability attributed to NCDs ( 4 8 9 9 10 11 12 The Adelaide Statement on Health in All Policies 13 4 Healthy China 2030 Planning Outline and the National Plan for NCD Prevention and Control 14 International academic research on NCD policy is extensive, encompassing both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Draper et al. evaluated the consistency between NCD policy and practice using a case study method and found that significant gaps existed between policy and implementation. These gaps were primarily due to limited awareness of the policy among primary care physicians and insufficient community infrastructure ( 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 28 29 30 31 32 Although China's NCD policy has achieved certain outcomes, the lack of evidence-based decision-making has led to poor feasibility in some policies ( 33 14 34 35 34 36 37 8 38 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data collection To ensure the validity and reliability of this study, NCD-related policy documents were retrieved using keywords such as “chronic disease” and “noncommunicable disease” from official government websites, including Peking University Law Database, the State Council, the National Health Commission, and the National Development and Reform Commission. The time range for the search is from January 1, 2009, to January 1, 2025. The types of policy documents searched include official announcements, laws and regulations, strategic plans, key work points, guiding opinions, and relevant industry guidelines, all of which have been formulated and publicly released by authoritative institutions, ensuring the authority and credibility of the policy research sample ( 39 Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Medical and Healthcare System 40 2.2 Data screening The screening of policy samples was based on the principles of authority, relevance, and validity. The specific criteria were as follows: (1) Authority: Policy documents included in the study were those classified as administrative regulations, departmental rules, or departmental normative documents that had been officially issued by authoritative national institutions. Given that most local policies in China are developed based on national-level policies, this study excluded local policies from the sample ( 41 41 Table 1 Table 1 Sample library of NCD policy documents (partial list).

A three-dimensional analytical framework—comprising policy themes, policy instruments, and policy effectiveness—was developed to analyze NCD policy from multiple perspectives ( Figure 1 n n 48 n Table 2 Figure 1 Research design.

Subsequently, based on policy instrument theory, content analysis is used to reveal the application of policy instruments. Finally, combining the findings from the theme analysis and instrument analysis, a quantitative evaluation model is constructed to assess the content effectiveness of NCD policy documents. By integrating multiple research methods, progressing across analytical layers, and combining different perspectives, this framework addresses the limitations inherent in single-method approaches and enhances the scientific rigor, systematic structure, and comprehensiveness of the research ( 48 49 2.4 Research methods 2.4.1 Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic model The LDA topic model is a statistical language model proposed by Blei ( 50 51 52 50 53 54 50 54 55 (1) P ( d , w , z , θ , φ ) = P ( θ ∣ α ) × ∏ P ( z ∣ θ ) × P ( w ∣ z , φ ) × ∏ P ( φ ∣ β ) where the word ω in document d z The specific modeling process consisted of the following steps: (1) Based on a thorough reading of the policy documents, the text was preprocessed by merging synonyms, removing irrelevant words, and standardizing synonymous terms. A domain-specific vocabulary for NCD policy texts was created, and a Bag of Words model was constructed ( 56 Figure 2A 57 (2) Perplexity = exp ( - ∑ d ∈ D log P ( w d ∣ α , β ) ∑ d ∈ D N d ) Figure 2 (A) (B) (A) (B) Panel A shows a line graph with two metrics, Perplexity and Coherence, plotted against the Number of Topics.

It enables a comprehensive and multidimensional representation of policy evaluation outcomes, aiding in the assessment of both overall strengths and weaknesses and specific indicator disparities ( 64 68 (9) PMC = [ X 1 X 2 X 3 X 4 X 5 X 6 X 7 X 8 X 9 ] 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Analysis of external characteristics of policy texts This study analyzed noncommunicable disease (NCD)-related policies issued by the Chinese government between 2009 and 2025. As shown in Figure 3A Healthy China 2030 Planning Outline Figure 3B Figure 3B Figure 3 (A) (B) Graph A is a line chart showing the number of events from 2008 to 2024, with notable peaks at 2015 and 2017. Graph B is a network diagram centered around the National Health Commission, displaying connections to various organizations and committees. 3.2 Analysis of internal characteristics of policy texts 3.2.1 Policy content theme analysis This study employs LDA topic modeling to analyze NCD policy texts. By selecting the top 30 high-frequency words most strongly associated with each topic, it extracts key terms and identifies six major policy themes: healthcare reform and regulation, public health governance, primary healthcare, health promotion, NCD prevention and control, and health equity ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Summary of thematic dimensions in China's NCD policy framework. The charts display the overall term frequency for each topic (shown in blue) and the estimated term frequency for each topic (shown in red). Six bar graphs present the top thirty most relevant terms for six distinct topics. Each graph includes two sets of bars: one for overall term frequency and another for estimated term frequency within the topic. The topics are: Healthcare Reform and Regulation, Public Health Governance, Primary Healthcare, Health Promotion, NCD Prevention and Control, and Health Equity. Each graph provides a slider to adjust the relevance metric, and key terms are labeled on the y-axis. 3.2.1.1 Healthcare reform and regulation China's NCD policies focus on healthcare system reform and drug regulation, especially in the systematic adjustments of payment mechanisms and drug distribution governance. In the dimension of healthcare reform and regulation, policy texts frequently mention high-frequency words such as “drugs,” “medications,” “insurance,” “medical insurance,” “healthcare,” “reform,” and “regulation.” This reflects China's efforts to optimize payment mechanisms and resource allocation through a series of institutional regulations, while also using measures such as centralized bulk purchasing, medical insurance cost control, and payment reform to effectively reduce drug price margins. These measures aim to improve national healthcare efficiency and equity, and further enhance the full-process regulation of drug quality and usage safety. 3.2.1.2 Public health governance The NCD policy system in China demonstrates a trend of transformation toward collaboration and integration. High-frequency words in the theme of public health governance, such as “nursing,” “family doctor,” “general practice,” “referral,” and “tiered” indicate that NCD governance is moving toward a governance model of service integration and responsibility reconstruction. The policy focuses on resource coordination, organizational integration, and functional collaboration, gradually integrating primary healthcare institutions and the public health service system into a unified platform. 3.2.1.3 Primary healthcare The primary healthcare service system is key to advancing nationwide NCD governance. Currently, primary healthcare faces issues such as unequal resource distribution, a shortage of technology and talent, and weak information linkage mechanisms, resulting in disparities in health services between urban and rural areas, medical institutions, and regions ( 69 3.2.1.4 Health promotion With the continued deepening of the Healthy China strategy, health promotion has gradually shifted from a marginal promotional tool to one of the core approaches in NCD governance. In the current NCD policies, “fitness” and “exercise” are high-frequency terms. These terms indicate that the policy particularly emphasizes the popularization of group exercise and the promotion of public services in the field of health promotion. This policy trend reflects the government's efforts to promote nationwide participation in physical activities and the dissemination of healthy lifestyles through innovative policy measures and strengthening the construction of sports facilities. In addition, the current NCD policy texts also focus on health education, balanced diets, and mental health, gradually promoting the integration of health factors into various aspects of social development. 3.2.1.5 NCD prevention and control In this theme, high-frequency words such as “food safety,” “survey,” “death,” and “cancer” reflect the key points of NCD policy, emphasizing aspects such as nutritional intervention, disease screening, early warning, and the analysis of causes of death. The policy texts also focus on strengthening NCD prevention and control through information technology, with many policies mentioning the use of public data to build a monitoring system that includes nutritional risk identification, disease screening, and early warning, thereby advancing NCD prevention and control. 3.2.1.6 Health equity Health equity is a key component of China's NCD policy, with a focus on medical rights and healthcare security mechanisms for key populations such as the impoverished, those in remote areas, and the elderly. In the theme of health equity, high-frequency words such as “poverty alleviation,” “impoverished populations,” “poor areas,” and “responsibility” dominate, reflecting China's special focus on the two sub-dimensions of health equity and health poverty alleviation in NCD governance. The six major themes of China's NCD policy reflect the construction of an integrated governance approach to NCDs, encompassing dimensions such as institutional design, prevention orientation, differential protection, payment systems, technical support, and grassroots integration. This demonstrates the systematic institutional design and hierarchical response of public policies with Chinese characteristics to social issues. 3.2.2 Analysis of policy instruments Based on the policy tools analysis framework and the coding of NCD policy texts, this study identified a total of 291 coding reference points for policy tools (see Figure 5 Figure 5 Utilization of policy instruments in China's NCD Policies. Frequency distribution of policy instruments across 50 NCD policy documents, categorized by type: supply-side (blue), environment-oriented (green), and demand-side (purple). Bar chart depicting various factors in three categories: Supply, Environmental, and Demand. Supply has the highest value in Public Services (40) and Infrastructure Development (37). Environmental is highest in Strategic Measures (39) and Information Technology (30). Demand peaks in Medical Insurance and Security (21). The legend differentiates categories with unique colors. Among the supply-side policy tools, public services and infrastructure construction are the primary tools, ranking first and second among the 15 policy tools, accounting for 13.75% (40/291) and 12.71% (37/291), respectively. This indicates the government's emphasis on the construction of the primary healthcare service system. However, the three tools related to talent development, financial investment, and standardization together account for only 25.2% (36/143) of supply-side policy tools, suggesting that the use of policy tools for talent development and financial support is relatively limited, which restricts the sustainability and effectiveness of the policies. Regarding environmental policy tools, while strategic measures account for 36.8% (39/106), reflecting the flexibility of policy design, there is significant discoordination in actual implementation. This may be due to insufficiently detailed policy content, leading to unclear responsibilities and accountability among policy implementers, which affects the effectiveness of policy execution. The financial incentives and supervision assessment tools account for 5.7% (6/106) and 10.4% (11/106), respectively. This suggests that the current policy system places insufficient emphasis on financial incentives and supervisory evaluation, which may reduce the enthusiasm and enforceability of policy execution, thereby impacting the effectiveness of the policy. The overall application of demand-side policy tools is relatively low, with particularly insufficient use of government procurement (3/42), public-private partnerships (2/42), international exchange (1/42), pilot projects (10/42), and public charity (5/42), which together account for only 7.22% (21/291) of the total policy tools. Among them, the medical insurance tool has a higher usage frequency, accounting for 50% (21/42) of demand-side tools, reflecting policymakers' emphasis on alleviating the medical burden of NCD patients. However, the lack of demand-side policy tools such as government procurement and international exchange hinders the effective participation of market and social forces. This may result in insufficient public service provision and inadequate protection for vulnerable groups, thereby reducing the driving effect of demand-side policy tools on NCD prevention and control. 3.2.3 Analysis of policy effectiveness Based on the PMC-Index modeling and calculation procedures described in the methodology section, this study conducted a quantitative analysis of nine NCD policy documents and assessed their effectiveness using the evaluation criteria outlined in Table 6 Table 7 Figure 6 Figure 6 PMC surface plot of NCD policies. the lower the degree of convexity and concavity in the figure, the higher the level of policy consistency, indicating better coordination and stability between different factors in the policy. Nine 3D surface plots labeled P1 to P9, displaying different undulating shapes with a color gradient from blue to red. Each plot includes a color bar scale indicating value ranges.

This reflects China's multidimensional consideration of policy functions and the systematic and comprehensive design of its NCD policies. In particular, X4 Policy Theme, as a core indicator of policy consistency, scored relatively high, indicating that China's NCD policies are broad in scope, covering areas such as healthcare reform and chronic disease prevention, with particular attention to the construction of primary healthcare systems and integrated disease management. Although X7 Policy Instruments scored relatively high overall with an average score of 0.74, seven of the policies scored 0.67, which is below the average. This is because these policies lacked demand-oriented policy instruments. The role of demand-oriented policies in chronic disease governance is to align policies with the needs of the public and patients, utilizing various forms of social and market collaboration, such as government procurement, corporate partnerships, and international exchanges. These instruments improve the efficiency and accuracy of public health resource allocation, optimize the chronic disease diagnosis and treatment system, meet the needs of different population groups, and maximize the driving force of demand-oriented policies. The average scores for X9 Involved Disciplines and X6 Policy Audience were 0.69 and 0.67, respectively. The main factor influencing the score for X9 was the relatively narrow range of disciplines covered by some policies. Given that chronic disease etiology involves multiple dimensions, including biological, behavioral, psychological, environmental, and social factors, as well as its long-term and complex nature, there is a need for an interdisciplinary approach in chronic disease policies. Effectively integrating the relevant fields in chronic disease management can not only promote interdisciplinary communication and cooperation, providing new perspectives and ideas for prevention and treatment, but also enhance the effectiveness of policy coordination and governance. In the NCD policies analyzed in this study, most policies covered public health, medicine, health economics, and nutrition, but there was insufficient focus on psychology, sociology, environmental science, and law. The average score for X5 Policy Audience was 0.67, which, according to the evaluation results, aligns with the government's proposed “government-led, multi-departmental collaboration, mobilization of society as a whole, and full participation” approach to chronic disease governance. However, the evaluation results indicate that the policy pays insufficient attention to special groups such as farmers, the elderly, and people with disabilities. The primary reason for this may be that the Chinese government categorizes these groups as impoverished populations, making it difficult to clearly define the policy recipients and effectively safeguard their rights and interests. It is particularly concerning that five of the nine policies did not mention the involvement of social organizations, which limits the ability of societal forces to effectively contribute to chronic disease governance. The average score for X1 Policy Nature was 0.65, with P4, P6, P8, and P9 falling below the average. Overall, most policies are primarily regulatory, guiding, and advisory in nature, but they lack predictive and diagnostic features. Predictive policies help by forecasting the development of chronic disease patterns, enabling timely interventions and the efficient allocation of resources, avoiding waste of public health resources, and improving the precision and sustainability of policy governance. Diagnostic elements in policy design are essential starting points, especially for chronic diseases with such complexity. Only through a scientific evidence-based decision-making process can the key issues be identified, enabling targeted efforts in chronic disease prevention and control. The average score for X5 Policy Evaluation was 0.64. The relatively low score for this indicator is due to the lack of detailed policy content, unclear designation of responsible entities, and ambiguous implementation pathways, which can lead to policy execution deviations, wasting resources, and negatively impacting the effectiveness of policy implementation. The average score for X2 Policy Timeliness was 0.63, with the score being affected by the lack of long-term planning in some policies. However, overall, China's NCD policies have developed a governance system that includes long-term planning, mid-term coordination and improvement, and short-term precision execution. X8 Incentive Measures received the lowest score among the nine indicators (0.38). Talent is fundamental to chronic disease prevention and control. Among the nine policies, only P7 includes policies related to talent incentives. The absence of such content can lead to the loss of skilled professionals in chronic disease management, impacting the long-term effectiveness of policy implementation. None of the nine policies mention tax incentives or government subsidies, which makes it difficult to motivate enterprises and other social forces to actively participate in chronic disease governance. The lack of incentive and constraint mechanisms makes it difficult to activate market participation in chronic disease governance, directly affecting the long-term effectiveness and sustainable development of NCD policy implementation. Figure 7 (A) (B) Two radar charts labeled A and B. Chart A compares three policies 'P3 (blue), P4 (green), and P8 (red)' across nine criteria: Policy Nature, Timeliness, Function, Theme, Evaluation, Audience, Tools, Incentive Measures, and Discipline Scope. Chart B shows the mean performance of these criteria in blue. Each axis represents ratings from 0 to 1.2 for chart A and 0 to 1.0 for chart B. 3.3 NCD governance policies analysis In response to the growing global burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), governments worldwide have introduced a range of policies aimed at reducing the associated public health and economic pressures, thereby fostering a supportive environment for effective NCD governance. Although China has made notable progress in NCD prevention and control, it still lags behind many developed countries in terms of governance depth and comprehensiveness-largely due to its relatively late policy initiation and regional disparities in development. To better understand the similarities and differences in national NCD policy frameworks and implementation outcomes, this study systematically compares the governance approaches of China, the United States, Australia, and Japan (see Table 8 Table 8 International comparison of NCD policies.  Country  Representative policies  Governance strategies  Management entities  Policy outcomes China “Healthy China 2030 Planning outline” (2016), “China's Medium- and long-term plan for the prevention and control of NCDs (2017–2025)” (2017) Strengthen early screening and intervention for NCDs, promote the transition from disease treatment to health management, and conduct nationwide health education and health promotion activities. National Health Commission, local governments at all levels, medical institutions, community health service centers The overall effectiveness of NCD management is acceptable, with progress in health education and early screening. However, disparities in medical resources and management systems across regions have led to uneven outcomes. United States “Healthy People 2020” (2010), “Healthy People 2030” (2020) Improve NCD management through various measures such as epidemiological surveillance, policy and environmental interventions, healthcare system interventions, and community programs. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), state health departments, community organizations The U.S. has shown outstanding performance in medical technology innovation, with improvements in patients' self-management abilities, but high healthcare costs and persistent health disparities remain. Australia National Strategic Framework for Chronic Disease (NSFCC) (2017), “Australia's Health Strategy” (2018) Implement general practitioner-led Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPMP) and Team Care Arrangements (TCAs), and strengthen health performance monitoring. Federal government, state and territory governments, Department of Health and Aged Care, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, general practitioners, community health service centers After policy implementation, care costs were reduced, health promotion effects were significant, and chronic disease management achieved good results through collaboration with general practitioners. Japan “Specific Health Checkups and Health Guidance” (2008), “Healthy Japan 21 (Second Phase)” (2013) Strengthen specific health checkups and health guidance, implement early screening and intervention, promote mandatory universal health insurance system, and optimize the integration of medical and nursing services. Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, health insurance organizations, community health service centers Early screening and intervention have shown significant effects, integration of medical and nursing services has been highly effective, and positive progress has been made in addressing the chronic disease challenges brought by population aging. 3.3.1 Governance strategies China's NCD policy emphasizes “co-building and sharing” and “prevention first” focusing on the construction of the primary healthcare service system and advocating the concept that “everyone is their own first responsibility.” At the same time, the policy strengthens health education and promotes healthy lifestyles, covering various aspects such as healthcare services, health equity, and social security. The policy's goal is to reduce the impact of NCDs on public health through systematic measures, lower premature mortality caused by NCDs, improve the overall health level of residents, and achieve population-wide, full-cycle health management. The United States' NCD policy focuses on cross-sector, multi-stakeholder, and multi-dimensional comprehensive interventions aimed at providing a favorable health management environment for citizens. This policy not only seeks to reduce healthcare costs but also enhances citizens' health literacy, with particular emphasis on the application of technology in NCD governance, promoting health equity, and strengthening individual self-management capabilities ( 70 71 72 3.3.2 Management entities China's NCD governance system is led by the National Health Commission, adopting a top-down governance model. The National Health Commission is responsible for formulating national-level NCD policies, while local governments develop and implement specific measures based on central policies. Medical structures and community health service centers play a crucial role in this system, directly providing basic healthcare services to citizens, including health education, early screening, disease diagnosis, and management. In the United States, NCD policies are guided and regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as its subsidiary, responsible for monitoring, data collection, and formulating health intervention measures for NCDs. The U.S. emphasizes the responsibilities and rights of state governments in NCD governance, with state and local health departments formulating and implementing NCD policies based on local conditions. Japan's NCD governance adopts a horizontal collaborative governance model involving national and local governments, as well as social organizations such as health insurance institutions ( 73 74 3.3.3 Policy outcomes The Chinese government adheres to a people-centered approach in NCD governance, actively promoting the integration of health into various policies, especially under the framework of the Healthy China strategy. To alleviate the burden of NCDs and improve public health, China has introduced a series of national policies, laws, and regulations. With the continuous improvement of the NCD policy system, the capacity and level of comprehensive prevention and control have gradually increased, and the policy practice has achieved significant results. Since the launch of the National NCD Prevention and Control Zones initiative in 2010, by 2023, a total of 488 national-level NCD prevention and control zones have been established, with a county-level coverage rate exceeding 17%. Additionally, 2,880 counties have launched the National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign, with a coverage rate of 97.3%. Citizens' health literacy has increased from 8.8% in 2012 to 27.8% in 2022 ( 75 76 At the same time, the lack of scientific evidence, the continuous increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases, regional disparities in NCD governance service levels, and the collaborative inertia in multi-sectoral cooperation remain major challenges that urgently need to be addressed in China's NCD governance ( 9 The United States' NCD management policy emphasizes cross-sector, multi-stakeholder cooperation to promote NCD prevention, early screening, and treatment and management. Under the health policy framework centered on the Healthy People initiative, the U.S. has achieved significant accomplishments, including: reducing major causes of death, such as heart disease and cancer; increasing preventive behaviors, such as childhood vaccination; and reducing risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and high cholesterol ( 77 78 79 Australia's primary healthcare system has played a crucial role in NCD governance. With the development of this system, Australia's average life expectancy has reached a historic high. The life expectancy for males born in 2023 is 81.3 years, and for females, it is 85.1 years. The premature mortality rate from chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases has significantly decreased, especially since the implementation of the national cervical screening program, which has halved the number of deaths from cervical cancer. The general practitioner-led Medicare program plays a central role in the prevention, screening, diagnosis, and management of NCDs. According to data, during the 2022-2023 period, approximately 60% of patients visiting general practitioners (10.2 million) had long-term health issues, with 16% (4.1 million) receiving chronic disease management services. This highlights the central role of general practitioners in Australia's NCD governance system ( 80 81 Since the implementation of the specific health checkups and health guidance policy, Japan has made significant progress in NCD prevention and management. Japan has made substantial strides in improving population health and is one of the leading countries globally in life expectancy. The life expectancy for those born in 2021 is 85.2 years, an increase of 5.8 years compared to 1990. The mortality rate from major non-communicable diseases has decreased, although the rate of decline has slowed ( 82 83 Through a systematic comparative analysis of the NCD policies of China, the United States, Australia, and Japan, this study finds that: China's NCD policy emphasizes “co-building and sharing” and “prevention first,” focusing on the construction of the primary healthcare service system and improving public health literacy through health education and lifestyle promotion. The United States, on the other hand, employs cross-sector, multi-stakeholder, and multi-dimensional interventions to promote early screening and self-management of NCDs, while also strengthening health equity and the application of technology in governance. Australia's policy focuses on early screening, general practitioner-led NCD management, and multidisciplinary care, emphasizing long-term care and community intervention for NCDs. Japan, in contrast, integrates medical and nursing care, early intervention, and health guidance, providing effective NCD management, especially for the elderly, in the context of aging. 4 Discussion The innovation of this study lies in balancing the subjectivity of qualitative analysis and the objectivity of quantitative analysis through complementary research methods. This provides a richer research perspective, broader scope, and emphasizes practicality. However, this study still has certain limitations, including: (1) Despite the extensive and locally distinctive policies implemented by local governments in China for chronic disease prevention and control, this study did not include local policies in the sample analysis. This limitation may result in the research findings not fully reflecting the overall situation of chronic disease policies in China, particularly the specific role and effectiveness of local policies in chronic disease prevention and control, as well as their coordination and interaction with national-level policies. (2) Insufficient analysis of the synergies between policy tools: Although this study points out the imbalance in the use of policy tools, the analysis of the interactions and synergies between different policy tools remains insufficient. In particular, there is a lack of in-depth discussion on how policy tools can work together to enhance policy effectiveness and social participation. (3) Insufficient long-term evaluation of policy effectiveness: The PMC model used in this study primarily assesses the internal consistency of policy texts but does not fully consider the actual effects after policy implementation. To address the limitations of the current study, future research could focus on the following areas: (1) Future studies could further reveal the unique roles and interactions of policies at different levels in NCD prevention by conducting a layered comparison between local and national policies. (2) Empirical methods, such as difference-in-differences (DID), can be applied to analyze the impact of policy implementation on long-term indicators such as the incidence rate, mortality rate, and healthcare costs of NCDs, providing more reliable data support for policy evaluation. (3) In-depth research on the synergies between different types of policy tools (supply-side, demand-side, and environmental) can help explore how to optimize tool combinations to enhance policy effectiveness. (4) Leveraging new technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and large language models can improve the efficiency and accuracy of policy text analysis, extracting deeper policy insights and trends. (5) Long-term tracking of the implementation effects of NCD policies should be conducted to assess their impact on public health, healthcare burden, and social costs, providing a basis for policy optimization. 5 Conclusion This study combined qualitative and quantitative research methods to conduct a multidimensional systematic analysis of China's NCD policies from 2009 to 2025. The findings effectively address the three questions raised by this study: Question 1: What are the themes of China's NCD policies? In terms of policy themes, this study identified and summarized six major themes in China's NCD policies using LDA topic modeling based on 50 policy samples. These themes include primary healthcare, health promotion, health equity, healthcare reform and regulation, chronic disease prevention and control, and public health governance. The findings align with the Chinese government's priorities in NCD governance. First, improving the level of primary healthcare services has always been a key focus of the government. In 2025, the National Health Commission issued the “Opinions on Optimizing the Layout and Construction of Primary Medical and Health Institutions,” particularly focusing on improving healthcare systems in economically underdeveloped areas such as rural and township regions. The policy set the goal of achieving full coverage of basic medical and health services in rural and community areas by 2027, with everyone being able to reach the nearest healthcare station within 15 minutes. Furthermore, to effectively bridge the healthcare service gap between regions and between urban and rural areas and promote health equity ( 84 85 86 Question 2: Are the policy instruments used in China's NCD policies reasonable? In terms of policy instruments, this study applied policy instrument theory and used NVivo 15 software to conduct content analysis on 50 NCD policy samples. The results reveal that, overall, the use of policy instruments in China's NCD policies exhibits structural imbalances and internal inconsistencies. Policy makers tend to favor the use of supply-oriented (49.1%) and environment-oriented (36.4%) policy instruments, which provide a solid external environment and basic support for the development of NCD policies. However, the use of demand-oriented policy instruments is significantly lacking (14.4%), which is consistent with the findings of existing research ( 8 Question 3: Are China's NCD policies effective? In terms of policy effectiveness, this study applied the PMC-Index model to analyze nine policy samples. The results revealed that the average PMC score of the nine NCD policies was 6.16, with an evaluation rating of “Excellent.” Among the nine policy samples, four were rated as “Excellent” and five as “Acceptable.” No policy samples were rated as “Perfect” or “Poor.” This suggests that China's NCD policies are generally well-designed and that their effectiveness is relatively high. However, significant differences still exist between policies, and aspects such as X1 Policy Nature, X2 Policy Timeliness, X8 Incentive Measures, and X9 Involved Disciplines should be prioritized for improvement. Additionally, through an analysis of the external characteristics of the policy texts, it was found that the collaboration among decision-making bodies is weak in the design and issuance of NCD policies, with policies often being issued by single departments. Therefore, future NCD policies will require more cross-departmental collaborative design and governance. 6 Policy implications As the global burden of NCDs increases, scientific and comprehensive policy planning is crucial for achieving universal health coverage. The effectiveness of policy planning directly impacts the scope and quality of NCD prevention, treatment, and management, thus affecting the realization of universal health. According to the Policy Triangle Theory, the success of a policy depends not only on the design of its content but also on the interaction between the policy environment, policy content, and policy process ( 87 88 6.1 Policy environment The construction of the policy environment is crucial for NCD governance and universal health coverage. The complexity of NCDs requires cross-departmental, cross-disciplinary, and cross-regional cooperation. In this context, coordination and collaboration among policy actors are essential. (1) The complexity of NCD governance makes it impossible for a single department to respond effectively. Therefore, policy planning should promote cross-departmental collaboration, covering sectors such as health, finance, education, and social security. Government agencies should collaborate with public health management departments, hospitals, research institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and NCD patients, among other stakeholders, in policy formulation and implementation. This ensures that resources and efforts from different departments and sectors are coordinated, thus enhancing the effectiveness and implementation of policies. (2) In the policy environment, the application of digital health technologies (such as artificial intelligence, big data, natural language processing, etc.) should be promoted to enhance the scientific basis and accuracy of policy decisions. By leveraging technological tools, not only can the effectiveness of decisions be improved, but the flow and sharing of information among stakeholders can also be ensured, enhancing the efficiency of policy implementation. (3) Emphasis should be placed on the foresight of the policy environment. Policy formulation needs to anticipate future trends in NCD development and consider the coordination of long-term and short-term goals from the early stages of policy planning. Regular dynamic evaluations of policy effects should be conducted to ensure that policies are adjusted in a timely manner based on changing environments and needs. 6.2 Policy content The design of policy content determines the specific measures and direction of NCD governance, directly influencing resource allocation and the achievement of policy goals. (1) Policy content should place greater emphasis on the use of demand-driven policy tools, encouraging the government to guide social forces in participating in NCD governance through mechanisms such as service purchasing and public-private partnerships. These tools effectively mobilize resources from all sectors of society, improving the accessibility and equity of NCD treatment and management services. (2) Health education is a key component of policy content. Particularly in NCD prevention and control, public health education should be strengthened to raise awareness of NCDs and promote the idea that “everyone is primarily responsible for their own health.” In addition, policies should guide the broader participation of society in adopting healthy lifestyles, thereby improving overall public health. (3) Policies should strengthen fiscal and tax incentives to encourage social forces to participate in NCD governance, increasing investment from both the public and private sectors in NCD-related medical services. Tax policies and financial subsidies can be used to support health coverage for low-income and specific social groups, ensuring equitable access to health protection for all populations. (4) The formulation of policy content should take local conditions into account, encouraging research focused on local populations to ensure that research results are locally applicable and provide scientific evidence for NCD prevention and control. At the same time, policy design should consider the coordination and complementarity between local and national policies to achieve coordinated governance across the country. 6.3 Policy process The policy process determines the implementation and evaluation of the policy and is key to ensuring the achievement of policy goals. (1) Stakeholder participation is crucial in the policy formulation, implementation, and evaluation processes. The policy process should involve multiple stakeholders, including government departments, public health management departments, healthcare providers, patient groups, and research institutions. The broad participation of stakeholders ensures that the policy content is more closely aligned with actual needs, enhancing its operability and fairness. (2) To ensure the fairness and transparency of policy implementation, a clear policy evaluation system should be established. Policy evaluation should consider not only the short-term effects of policy implementation but also long-term health indicators, such as the incidence and mortality rates of NCDs, as well as healthcare costs. An independent third-party evaluation mechanism should be introduced during the policy process to ensure the fairness and objectivity of the evaluation results. (3) Accountability must be strengthened during policy implementation. The responsible parties for policy implementation should be clearly defined, and any actions that fail to comply with regulations or meet established goals should be held accountable. To ensure the effectiveness of accountability, regular performance evaluations should be conducted, and incentive and penalty mechanisms should be established to encourage stakeholders to fulfill their responsibilities, ensuring that policy goals are successfully achieved. (4) A real-time feedback mechanism should be established during policy execution. Feedback obtained during policy execution should be promptly incorporated into the evaluation system, allowing the policy to be dynamically adjusted based on actual outcomes. This ensures that the policy can make necessary adjustments at different stages based on actual circumstances, thereby enhancing its sustainability and adaptability.
