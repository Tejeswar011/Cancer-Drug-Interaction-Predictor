In order to compare degradation of wild-type and mutant CALM protein, nontransfected HEK293T cells and HEK293T cells transfected with a plasmid encoding HA-tagged wild-type or mutant CALM were cultured in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit translation.

Hearts were immersion-fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 24 hours at 4°C, cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in PBS for 24 hours, and embedded in OCT (Sakura). Ten-micrometer-thick longitudinal sections were cut on a cryotome (Leica 3050S). The sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma-Aldrich) or Masson’s trichrome (ScyTek Laboratories) and examined under a light microscope. Images were captured with a digital camera ( DS126311 Immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging. Ten-millimeter-thick sections from fixed and cryoprotected hearts were incubated with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 hour, followed by 30 minutes of blocking with 2% BSA. Sections were then incubated for 12 hours with a polyclonal rabbit anti-CALM antibody (1:200; ab45689; Abcam) in PBS supplemented with 2% BSA and 10% goat serum and subsequently reacted with an Alexa Fluor 555–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1.5 hours (1:100; A21429; Invitrogen).

After an initial 24-hour recording period, telemetered mice were trained on a single-lane graded treadmill for 10 minutes on 3 consecutive days. At the day of treadmill test, mice initially ran at a speed of 10 m/min and slope of 15 degrees, and speed was increased by 2 m/min every minute until the mice reached exhaustion. Exhaustion was defined as the inability of the mouse to run on the treadmill for 10 seconds despite electrical shock ( 34 Cage switch was routinely begun at 10 am by removing ECG transmitter–carrying mice from their original cage and placing them into a cage previously occupied by a different male mouse for approximately 3 hours. Ventricular arrhythmia scores during the 1-hour interval preceding and following the cage switch were defined by the worst ventricular arrhythmia (1 – no or isolated PVCs, 2 – ventricular bigeminy and/or frequent PVCs >10/min, 3 – ventricular couplet, 4 – non-sustained ventricular tachycardia lasting ≥ 3 s and ≤ 15 s) ( 35 Epicardial optical voltage mapping of Langendorff-perfused hearts.
