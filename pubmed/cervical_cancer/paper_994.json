This scoping review examines the barriers and facilitators to preventive healthcare access among rural immigrant populations in the United States, utilizing a systematic analysis of 21 peer-reviewed studies published between 2011 and 2025. Key findings reveal interconnected barriers at multiple levels, spanning from individual psychological factors to policy-level exclusions. Facilitators include community-based initiatives, culturally responsive care, and policy-driven supports such as Medicaid and vaccination programs. The review also highlights critical gaps in the literature, including limited research on non-Hispanic immigrant groups and underrepresentation of certain preventive care services, such as diabetes management and oral health. Addressing these challenges requires multilevel interventions that prioritize affordability, accessibility, and cultural relevance. This review underscores the need for comprehensive, equity-driven strategies to ensure that rural immigrant populations can fully benefit from preventive healthcare services.

(2) How are these factors associated with health outcomes, and how do they inform or appear in strategies to improve healthcare access for this population? Identifying relevant studies A systematic search across MEDLINE with Full Text, APA PsycInfo, and CINAHL was conducted under three broad headings—“immigrant,” “rural,” and “preventive health care,” as described in Table 1 Table 1 Searching strategy Search Terms Search Area Immigrant related immigrant* OR refugee* OR asylum OR\"undocumented person*\"OR\"undocumented worker*\"OR\"undocumented people\"OR\"illegal alien*\"OR\"unauthorized worker*\"OR\"green card holder*\"OR\"greencard holder*\"OR migrant* OR\"foreign born\"OR foreignborn Title, subject, abstract Rural related rural* OR village* OR town OR towns OR farming OR farms OR\"farm worker*\"OR farmworker* OR agriculture* OR forestry OR ranching OR ranches OR\"ranch worker*\"OR ranchworker* Title, subject, abstract Preventive care related* prevent* OR prophyla* OR screening OR screenings OR vaccination OR vaccinations OR immunization OR immunizations OR immunisation OR immunisations Title, subject, abstract * Selecting the studies Articles published in English in 2010 and after were included. A total of 1,704 articles were imported into Covidence, a systematic review platform, and duplicates were removed. The first-round review involved title and abstract screening based on the following criteria. Each study: (1) focused on immigrant populations (i.e., foreign-born populations or families with foreign-born members); (2) was conducted in rural America; (3) was empirical; and (4) focused on preventive rather than curative care. Each article was reviewed independently by two reviewers to determine eligibility; in case of a conflict, a third reviewer was involved, and conflict was resolved after a team discussion. Articles that met the criteria or could not be categorized based on title and abstract were subjected to a full article review ( n 1 Fig. 1 PRISMA Article Searching and Screening Flowchart Charting the data Using a pre-designed Covidence form, four authors independently extracted data from selected articles: study characteristics, participant criteria, recruitment methods, preventive healthcare focus, barriers, resources, and significant findings. Collating, summarizing, and reporting the results We analyzed and synthesized the findings using the “charted” information from the selected studies. We organized relevant information on the authors, study design, study participants, country of origin of immigrants, primary focus of preventive healthcare, and barriers/resources to accessing preventive healthcare services (Table 2 15 62 Table 2 Summary of the included studies ( N # Author (s) (year) Design Country of Origin Region of Study Population(s)/Community Sample Size Outcome Barriers Facilitators 1 Alasagheirin et al.

Psychological barriers, particularly fear and perceived lack of control, frequently hindered access to preventive health services such as COVID-19 testing and vaccination [ 7 25 69 46 50 51 3 50 Limited English proficiency was another significant individual-level barrier, restricting rural immigrants’ access to healthcare [ 41 26 26 45 61 51 Knowledge and awareness of diseases, healthcare procedures, and community resources were also critical factors influencing access to preventive healthcare. For example, limited health literacy about cervical cancer was cited as a barrier to both HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening [ 39 68 46 50 53 Socio-demographic factors, such as sex, age, and socioeconomic status (SES), also influenced access to preventive health services. The reviewed studies indicated that younger women were less likely to undergo Pap smear tests [ 39 51 66 Individual-level factors: facilitators While various individual-level factors hindered access to preventive healthcare, several, such as personal attitudes, knowledge, and faith, were facilitators. For COVID-19 testing and vaccination, a strong sense of responsibility to protect oneself and others, coupled with a willingness to follow protective measures, was a key facilitator among rural immigrant communities [ 1 7 7 39 Relationship-level factors: barriers The second level of SEM focuses on close social relationships with family, friends, and partners that shape individual behavior and experiences (CTSA Consortium, 2011). Parents’ attitudes and beliefs play a critical role in minors’ access to preventive healthcare, as parental hesitancy, perceived risks, and stigma often discourage children from utilizing these services [ 3 69 3 46 50 Relationship-level factors: facilitators Support from close relationships facilitated preventive healthcare use, particularly in SRH education and care. Parental acceptance and informed knowledge were key to HPV vaccination uptake, with mother-daughter communication playing a crucial role [ 45 68 3 Community-level factors: barriers The community level of SEM examines the impact of social environments such as schools, workplaces, and neighborhoods on health (CTSA Consortium, 2011). A key issue in the reviewed studies was limited access to timely and accurate health information in rural communities. Participants struggled to find reliable information [ 26 53 61 3 26 Another common theme of barriers at the community level was inconvenience, stemming from a lack of transportation, need-based services from healthcare providers, and appropriate accommodations from workplaces. Many participants reported difficulty accessing healthcare facilities due to long travel distances [ 53 66 53 Challenges in accessing preventive healthcare also arose from interactions with healthcare providers. These included language barriers caused by the lack of bilingual providers and staff for scheduling and care [ 11 53 66 68 45 68 11 Workplace-related barriers significantly impacted healthcare access, with many patients unable to schedule and attend medical appointments due to insufficient workplace accommodations [ 50 53 53 69 66 Community-level factors: facilitators At the community level, a variety of facilitators were identified that promoted access to preventive healthcare. These facilitators highlight community-based strategies that mitigate barriers to healthcare access, underscoring the importance of local involvement, flexible service delivery, and effective communication. For example, community support for transportation to appointments, flexible clinic hours (afternoons and evenings), and the availability of Spanish-speaking staff at the clinic were identified as key facilitators [ 66 69 11 49 50 Trusted local messengers, including community members and religious leaders, played a vital role in building trust and promoting health behavior change [ 1 25 1 7 50 45 68 11 Societal-level factors: barriers Societal-level factors include cultural and social norms as well as policies related to health, economics, and education, which can either mitigate or exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities between groups (CTSA Consortium, 2011). The first significant barrier identified was the lack of insurance among rural immigrants. Medicaid reimbursement shortfalls and insurance coverage gaps significantly limited access to necessary services [ 45 50 61 41 49 66 Another crucial barrier stemmed from identity-related issues, particularly for undocumented individuals or those with temporary immigration status, who felt vulnerable due to their legal status or the potential for deportation. This structural fear was compounded by general distrust in the government and institutions, often resulting in avoidance of preventive healthcare services, especially for those with limited access to insurance [ 1 53 25 60 Cultural barriers significantly impacted preventive healthcare access. Stigma around sexual behavior discouraged HPV vaccination, especially among rural immigrants, as norms against teen and premarital sex intersected with policy-related barriers like immigration status, further limiting SRH education and care [ 3 11 39 45 51 Societal-level factors: facilitators Federal and state efforts, though not specifically for immigrants, have improved access to preventive healthcare. Medicaid and Vaccines for Children expanded HPV vaccine access [ 68 3 1 7 Discussion This scoping review highlights the multilevel barriers and facilitators to accessing preventive healthcare among immigrant populations in rural America, emphasizing the unique challenges at the intersection of immigrant status and rurality. Immigrants in rural areas often face compounded obstacles that differ from those encountered by immigrants in urban areas or native-born rural residents. The convergence of geographic and social isolation, limited healthcare infrastructure, and systemic inequities creates a complex landscape where immigrants in rural settings are more vulnerable to barriers such as transportation challenges, language barriers, and fear of deportation. Although we categorized the barriers according to specific levels of the Social Ecological Model (SEM), it is important to acknowledge that some barriers are cross-cutting—shaped simultaneously by individual and structural factors. These overlapping factors not only restrict access to preventive care but also exacerbate existing health disparities, underscoring the urgent need for targeted, multilevel interventions for this growing and diverse population [ 42 The findings from the included studies reveal a significant gap in the scope of preventive healthcare outcomes examined for immigrants in rural America. The studies primarily focused on a limited range of services, such as COVID-19 vaccinations, cervical cancer screenings, and specific disease testing, with less evidence on other outcomes such as diabetes that disproportionately affect rural population and minorities [ 38 This review identified multilevel barriers, spanning from individual psychological factors to policy-level exclusions. Systemic obstacles, such as lack of health insurance, legal precarity, and language exclusions, further compounded by cultural stigmas, misinformation, and logistical difficulties like limited transportation and inflexible work schedules, make access to preventive healthcare complicated and challenging for immigrants residing in rural areas. These challenges are interconnected and should be addressed systematically. For example, structural barriers such as a lack of insurance among rural immigrants can manifest at the individual level as fear of diagnosis of illness that is beyond their financial means to address. In such cases, an individual-level intervention that addresses fear alone, without focusing on expanding insurance coverage in rural immigrant communities, may not lead to improved access to preventive healthcare. Therefore, an interpretation of barriers that highlights the nuances of the issues has important implications for intervention strategies. Additionally, the complexities of the healthcare system pose significant challenges; for instance, one study highlighted that private hospitals nearby often have specific eligibility criteria, while county hospitals that do not require a Social Security Number may be located 30 miles away [ 11 Despite these barriers, the review revealed promising facilitators that could inform multilevel interventions. Community-based initiatives that involve promotores and trusted local messengers (e.g., religious leaders) were highlighted as critical in bridging gaps in healthcare access. In addition, community-level efforts to eliminate inconveniences, such as providing transportation, bilingual providers, and flexible clinic hours, have proven effective. More broadly, policy-driven supports, including Medicaid and state-level vaccination programs, have shown potential to alleviate financial barriers to access care. The impact of policy mandates, such as required HPV and other immunizations in school systems [ 31 Implications for policy and practice Policy and practice implications for improving preventive healthcare access among rural immigrants must address their unique challenges through systematic and innovative solutions. Additionally, it is essential to clarify how rural immigrants are situated within healthcare insurance plans, as rural plans differ significantly from those in urban areas, often leaving immigrants with inadequate coverage. At the policy design level, several limitations and challenges regarding the impact of existing legislation on immigrant health require careful examination. For example, despite that fact that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) significantly expanded access to preventive services—such as cancer screenings—through Medicaid expansion and marketplace subsidies, its eligibility for these benefits depends on immigration status. Specifically, lawfully present immigrants may qualify (though often with restrictions such as a five-year waiting period for Medicaid), while undocumented immigrants are excluded from ACA coverage altogether. As most studies in this review did not disaggregate findings by immigration status, the actual reach of ACA provisions in rural immigrant communities remains unclear and warrants further attention. The recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed and signed on July 4, 2025, introduces significant cuts to Medicaid—estimated between $800 billion to $1 trillion—with new work requirements, increased cost-sharing, and changes likely to reduce coverage for millions, especially in rural areas [ 35 From the policy implementation perspective, effective strategies are needed to reduce address access barriers and concerns among immigrant populations. Access to preventive care must be coupled with affordable follow-up treatment, as evidence indicates that some immigrants struggle to proceed with treatment despite early detection of disease during screening [ 64 18 52 Last, from the practice perspective, engaging immigrant populations through both grounded and innovative approaches is critically importance. Community-level programs should engage diverse stakeholders, including employers, schools, and religious groups, to collectively make preventive healthcare accessible for immigrants, who contribute significantly to the local economy and vitality. Leveraging resources within immigrant communities is also essential, as trusted members like religious leaders play a key role in health promotion. Schools with children of immigrant parents serve as critical venues and programs such as the Migrant Education Program can enhance engagement and support for preventive health initiatives. Addressing these challenges requires culturally informed, trust-building strategies and policies that promote affordable, continuous, and accessible care. Mobile and onsite clinics, as well as telehealth, are particularly needed in remote rural areas and for those working in labor-intensive jobs with less flexibility, requiring collaboration and accommodation from rural employers. Implications for future research This review highlights key directions for future research. Most studies relied on qualitative methods, which, while valuable for capturing lived experiences, limit generalizability. To better understand rural immigrants’ healthcare access, future research should incorporate large-scale, disaggregated data. Additionally, the study population was largely limited to Latinx immigrants, with minimal focus on Asian, multiracial, or other growing rural minority groups [ 34 41 50 Limitations This review has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, the focus on peer-reviewed articles may have excluded valuable insights from gray literature, which often provide practical and community-level perspectives on healthcare access. Second, while we defined “rural” based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s definition, some areas that do not meet this definition but still experience significant resource limitations may have been excluded. These areas may face similar challenges, warranting further investigation. Third, our search strategy did not include racial or ethnic group identifiers, which may have contributed to the overrepresentation of Latinx-focused studies. As rural areas become increasingly diverse, further research is needed to examine barriers and facilitators among other racial and ethnic immigrant groups. Addressing these limitations could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the barriers and facilitators to preventive healthcare access among immigrant populations. Conclusion Preventive healthcare is crucial for improving long-term health outcomes and reducing costs, particularly for vulnerable populations such as rural immigrants. This review highlights barriers and facilitators to access, revealing structural, cultural, and policy challenges, but also promising community-based initiatives and policy-driven supports. Achieving equitable preventive healthcare for rural immigrants requires multilevel interventions that tackle systemic barriers and enhance community-driven solutions.
