It accounts for approximately 15% 1 2 3 Recent studies have highlighted the pivotal role of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) in tumor progression. Among the various subfamilies of DUBs, ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs) are the largest and have been found to be involved in tumor progression 4 5 Notch1 6 USP1 7 8 In 2013, Young's lab introduced the concept of SEs, highly active enhancers enriched with transcription factors (TFs), cofactors, and histone modifications 9 10 11 , 12 13 14 HOXB HOXB8 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 In leukemia, Sanda's group 22 23 24 IRF4 NF-kB) TP73 25 TAL1 26 MYB ANP32B) MYC) 27 LYL1 28 29 30 This study screened the DUB family based on H3K27ac ChIP-seq data from pediatric clinical samples and T-ALL cells, identifying USP20 as an SE-regulated DUB in T-ALL. It has been shown to deubiquitinate proteins, such as D2, HIF1A, and β κ 31 USP20 4 32 USP20 In vivo USP20 2 Methods and materials 2.1 Cell culture Shanghai Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co., Ltd. supplied the J.gamma1, 6T-CEM, MOLT-4, and Jurkat human leukemia cell lines. HUT78 and CCRF-CEM came from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Cell Bank. Complete RPMI 1640 media (VivaCell, Shanghai, China) supplemented with 10% FBS (Biological Industries, CT, USA) was used to cultivate these cells. HEK293FT cells were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and maintained in DMEM (VivaCell, Shanghai, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biological Industries, CT, USA). All cell lines underwent authentication by STR analysis and testing for mycoplasma using the MycoAlert kit. 2.2 Lentivirus generation and infection IGE Biotechnology LTD in China synthesized and integrated shRNA into the pLKO.1 vector, with the sequences provided in Supporting Information Table S1 USP20 USP20 α USP20 HIF1A CTNNB1) RUNX1), ETS1) 2.3 CRISPR-mediated silencing of USP20 To establish stable knockout cell lines using the dCas9/CRISPR system, Jurkat and J.gamma1 cells were initially transfected with lentiviruses containing the dCas9 gene and subsequently subjected to puromycin selection. Subsequently, small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting USP20 USP20 Table S2 2.4 RNA purification, cDNA generation, and qRT-PCR FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation Kit V2 (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was used to extract total RNA. Subsequently, the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to reverse transcribe 2 μg of total RNA into cDNA. The LightCycler® 480 SYBR® Green I Master Mix on a LightCycler® 480 Real-Time System (Roche, Grunzak, Germany) was used for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).

Subsequently, the samples were resuspended in 1 × Annexin V binding buffer and labeled with FITC-Annexin V antibody and PI solution according to the instructions provided in the FITC-Annexin V apoptosis kit manual (BD Biosciences, 556547, San Jose, CA, USA). Cell apoptosis was evaluated using the Beckman Gallios™ Flow Cytometer (Beckman, Krefeld, Germany). 2.9 Luciferase reporter assay The USP20 Table S4 USP20 2.10 Cell cycle analysis Cells were harvested, washed with cold PBS, and then fixed in 70% ethanol overnight. Subsequently, cell cycle analysis was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using the “Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Analysis Kit” (Beyotime, C1052, Shanghai, China). Flow cytometry (Beckman Gallios™ Flow Cytometer) (Beckman, Krefeld, Germany) was utilized to determine the distribution of cells in different phases of the cell cycle. 2.11 RNA sequencing and data processing BGI Tech Service Co., Ltd. (Shenzhen, China) isolated the RNAs, prepared the library, sequenced the transcripts, and filtered the data. The 150 bp paired-end reads were aligned to the hg38 genome (Ensembl) employing HISAT2 software (version 2.2.0). StringTie software (version 2.1.2) was utilized for transcriptome assembly and abundance analysis. Differentially expressed genes were detected using the R/Bioconductor package DESeq2. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the R/Bioconductor package clusterProfiler, utilizing Hallmarks gene sets sourced from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). 2.12 In vivo All animal studies were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Suzhou College (approval number: CAM-SU-AP#: JP-2018-1). Female NSG mice aged 5 weeks (Shanghai Model Organisms Center, Inc., Shanghai, China) were randomly separated into two groups ( n in vivo 6 d 2 in vivo n 6 d 2.13 CUT&Tag assay and data processing CUT&Tag assays were conducted using the Hyperactive Universal CUT&Tag Assay Kit for Illumina (Vazyme, TD903, Nanjing, China) following the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies against IgG, USP20, and HIF1A were employed. DNA was extracted and amplified with i5 and i7 primers in TruePrep Index Kit V2 for Illumina (Vazyme, TD202, Nanjing, China). Libraries were purified with VAHTS DNA Clean Beads (Vazyme, N411, Nanjing, China) and sequenced by Novogene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). The 150 bp paired-end reads were aligned to the hg38 (Ensembl) genome using Bowtie2 (version 2.4.4) with parameters --end-to-end-- very-sensitive --no-mixed --no-discordant. Duplicates were removed using Picard tools. Peaks were called using MACS (version 3.0). 2.14 Immunoprecipitation Jurkat and J.gamma1 cells transfected with USP20 2.15 Human tissue samples, ChIP-seq, and SE analysis This research was authorized by the Human Care Committee of Soochow University (approval number: 2023CS106).

Refractory T-ALL has a survival rate of <10%. Factors, such as genetic mutations, immunophenotypic heterogeneity, treatment resistance, dysregulation of apoptosis, bone marrow microenvironment, and specific patient factors (including age, gender, and genomic traits), contribute to its poor prognosis. Abnormal gene activation or inactivation ( e g NOTCH1 MYC TAL1 β κ 34 , 36 , 37 Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of SEs in solid tumors and blood cancers, with their composition and function evolving throughout tumorigenesis. Genes driven by SEs are crucial targets for cancer therapies. In this study, we conducted an in-depth exploration of SE function in T-ALL. Meanwhile, the role of SEs in various other tumor types has also drawn considerable interest. For instance, the Holliday junction recognition protein ( HJURP HJURP 18 17 HOXB8 HOXB8 15 TTC8 TTC8 LYL1 ANP32B LYL1 ANP32B 27 , 28 Sanda et al. identified the crucial roles of SE-related oncogenes T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 2, IRF4 TP73 22 23 24 TAL1 25 TAL1 26 USP20 + USP20 versus + USP7 6 USP5 USP36 USP44 USP49 38 USP20 USP44 USP4 USP44 8 USP4 39 USP4 USP20 USP20 RUNX1 USP20 USP20 plays a crucial role in regulating protein stability through various signaling pathways and is involved in important biological processes, such as the cell cycle, proliferation, and apoptosis 4 31 40 41 USP20 4 USP20 32 42 The ubiquitin–proteasome system regulates protein quality control in eukaryotes via 43 κ 4 β 44 via 45 β 44 β 34 β USP20 via β USP20 HIF1A 46 β 47 48 β GLUT1 PER1 CIC 49 O via 50 51 Although our study provides new insights into SE-driven USP20 L1210 cells are a mouse leukemia cell line derived from lymphoma in DBA/2 mice. Although L1210 cells originate from mouse lymphocytic leukemia rather than T-ALL, they recapitulate critical features of human T-ALL, such as rapid proliferation, impaired apoptosis, and comparable drug sensitivity. These shared characteristics, along with their utility in studying broader leukemia mechanisms ( e g 52 in vitro in vivo in vivo While GSK2643943A is a recognized USP20 inhibitor, its detailed pharmacological mechanisms remain poorly characterized in the literature. Currently, no studies report its synergistic effects with chemotherapy agents such as cytarabine, dexamethasone, etoposide, or daunorubicin; furthermore, there are no investigations into the interactions between these four chemotherapy drugs and USP20. We speculate that several factors may contribute to the absence of observed synergistic effects between GSK2643943A and the tested chemotherapy drugs. These factors could include drug–drug interactions, competition at target sites, or differing pharmacological mechanisms. USP20 is a deubiquitinase that plays a crucial role in maintaining protein stability by removing ubiquitin chains from target proteins.
