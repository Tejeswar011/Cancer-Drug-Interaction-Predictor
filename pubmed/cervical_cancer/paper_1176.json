We aimed to analyse and compare oncological outcomes of men age ≤50 years (y) and >50 years with PeCa. A retrospective analysis of men ≤50 y with penile squamous cell carcinoma managed at a tertiary centre was performed. A propensity score matched cohort of men >50 y was identified for comparison. Matching was according to tumour, nodal stage and the types of primary surgery. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and metastasis-free survivals (MFS) were estimated using Kaplan–Meier plots and compared using log-rank tests. Between 2005–2020, 100 men ≤50 y (median (IQR) age, 46 y (40–49)) were identified and matched with 100 men >50 y (median (IQR) age, 65 y (59–73)). 10, 24, 32, 34 men age ≤50 y were diagnosed in 2005–2007, 2008–2012, 2013–2016 and 2017–2020 respectively. Median (IQR) follow-up was 53.5 (18–96) months. OS at 2 years: ≤50 y, 86%>50 y, 80.6%; 5 years: ≤50 y, 78.1%, >50 y, 63.1%; 10 years: ≤50 y, 72.3%, >50 y, 45.6% ( p p p p Subject terms Urogenital diseases Diagnosis pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Limited 2025 Introduction Penile cancer (PeCa) is a rare malignancy and the GLOBOCAN Cancer Statistics estimated 36,068 (0.2%) new cases of PeCa and 13,211 (0.1%) PeCa-related deaths worldwide in 2020 [ 1 2 3 2 Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for over 95% of PeCa, and is associated with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in 30–50% of invasive cases [ 4 5 6 1 Here, we report our oncological outcomes of men aged ≤50 y with penile SCC and compare it to a propensity score matched cohort of men aged >50 y with penile SCC from a single tertiary referral centre. Patients and Methods Patients Following institutional board registration, a retrospective analysis of data from patients treated for penile SCC between Jan 2005 and Jan 2020 at a single tertiary referral centre was performed. Pathology reports, staging images, operation notes and follow-up data were analysed. There is no age definition for young or older PeCa patients, therefore, an arbitrary cut-off of 50 y was used. A 50 y cut-off was chosen on an arbitrary evaluation based on literature search on cut-offs for young vs. old patients for other urological malignancies [ 7 9 1 10 Management: diagnostic workup Patients referred for suspected PeCa underwent diagnostic evaluation as per the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines [ 11 Management: primary surgery Localised disease on the penis was treated by performing one of the following surgical options depending on the location (T-stage) of the disease: Radical Circumcision and Wide local excision (WLE) A radical circumcision, where the inner foreskin is excised to the coronal sulcus is sufficient if the lesion is confined to the foreskin. In phimotic cases, a dorsal slit is performed first (not incising the tumour) to fully retract the prepuce to examine the glans penis and urethral meatus. The prepuce is removed en-bloc with the lesion via an outer and inner prepuce incision. Small superficial shaft lesions, i.e. not involving the corpus spongiosum or cavernoma may be excised in whole (WLE) and the defect closed with absorbable sutures. If a primary skin closure results causes tension in the fully erect penis, a local skin flap or an extragenital split-thickness skin graft (STSG) may be required. Glansectomy with or without distal corporectomy Lesions confined to the glans (cT2 disease) are treated with a glansectomy. An incision is made on the outer prepuce, or if the patient is circumcised, an incision is made along the scar. The incision is deepened circumferentially, and a plane is created between above Buck’s fascia and the glans. This is to preserve the vascular supply if a graft is planned. If a STSG is not required, especially if the tumour is adherent to Buck’s fascia, dissection is performed under the fascia. The glans is dissected off the corporal bodies until the urethra is the only remaining attachment, maintaining ~1 cm length beyond the corpora cavernosa if possible. The urethra is transected, spatulated ventrally and is splayed over the corpora cavernosa heads at 2–4 points with 5–0 absorbable suture. Biopsies of the urethral margin and corporal bodies are taken. If the distal corporal bodies are involved macroscopically, distal corporectomies are performed. The skin is brought to the urethra and the shaft skin edges with 5–0 and 4–0 absorbable sutures. A 14Fr 2-way indwelling catheter is left in place for ~12 days. Partial penectomy Patients with distal disease involving the corpus cavernosa (cT3) are managed with a partial penectomy to preserve penile length for sexual and urinary function. A skin incision is made proximal to the tumour and extended circumferentially down to Buck’s fascia. The dorsal vasculature is ligated and the corpora cavernosa are incised proximal to the tumour with ~5 mm margin. The urethra should be left 10–15 mm longer than the corpora if the lesion is not ventral, and spatulated and centralised over corpora cavernosa with a 5-0 absorbable suture. The shaft skin is subsequently used to cover the stump and sutured to the urethral mucosal edge. A14-16Ch Foley catheter is left in situ and removed after 7 days. A STSG can also be used to avoid the shaft retracting and allow better cosmetic outcome. The main complication of partial penectomy is meatal stenosis. The risk can be minimised by ensuring that the urethral spatulation conducted is of an adequate length, 10–15 mm. Total penectomy/Subtotal penectomy If the whole shaft of the penis and crura are involved, a total penectomy with perineal urethrostomy is required. An elliptical incision is performed around the tumour, followed by dissection through the skin and superficial fascia around the tumour. Subsequent division and ligation of the deep dorsal vein and neurovascular bundle is performed along with the suspensory ligament. Dissection is carried out beyond the tumour or down to the crura if there is extensive proximal involvement. The crura are isolated with complete division of them onto the ischial tuberosity via a perineal incision. In subtotal penectomy the  corporal body is divided at the penoscrotal junction  and oversewn using a 2/0 PDS suture. The urethra is mobilised off the corporal bodies with adequate length and spatulated ventrally. A inverted ‘U or Y” shape incision is made in the perineum and the urethra is brought out. The perineal skin is sutured to the urethra with 4/0 and 5/0 absorbable sutures. A 14–16Ch Foley catheter is then left insitu and removed after ~7–10 days. A drain is left in the perineum and in the pubic area, with a pressure dressing applied to reduce hematoma formation. The main complication from total/subtotal penectomy is perineal urethrostomy stenosis. Glans resurfacing This procedure is indicated for PeIN or cT1a disease. The glans skin is marked in quadrants from the urethral meatus to the coronal sulcus. A tourniquet is applied and the tip of each quadrant is lifted, starting at the urethral meatus. The glans epithelium and subepithelium are dissected from the meatus to the coronal sulcus. The tourniquet is removed once all quadrants have been excised. Haemostasis is secured and a STSG is harvested, sutured to the corona sulcus and urethral edge with 4–0 and 5–0 absorbable sutures. Absorbable quilting sutures with monofilament poliglecaprone 5–0 are used. A 14–16ch urethral catheter is left insitu for around 12 days and a paraffin soaked dressing is applied and sutured in place. Coronal-sparing glans resurfacing can also be performed in cases where the coronal ridge and sulcus are not affected, this allows preservation of the coronal ridge helping maintain erogenous sensation, sexual function with excellent cosmetic outcomes [ 12 Split-thickness skin graft (STSG) A STSG can be used to construct a neoglans following glans resurfacing, glansectomy or partial penectomy. Commonly, the thigh is selected for STSG harvesting using an air-powered dermatome. Graft thickness ranges from 0.014 to 0.018 inches. In case of smoking, vascular disease or diabetes, graft healing can be compromised. Therefore, the use of grafts should be discouraged in severe vascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes or when the patient refuses to quit smoking. Complications include graft infection or graft failure requiring debridement. Management: lymphadenectomy Patient with cancer detected in FNA or DSLNB samples were managed with radical inguinal lymphadenectomy (ILND) with or without pelvic lymph node dissection if they had pN2 disease or extracapsular nodal extension. Post-operative histological reports and staging images were reviewed in a sMDT meeting to decide on adjuvant treatment. Primary and secondary outcomes The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and secondary outcomes included recurrence-free survival (RFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS). Statistical analysis A 1:1 propensity score matched cohort of 100 men >50 y with penile SCC based on type of surgical procedure, grade and stage of disease was identified. A 1:1 propensity score matched cohort (without replacement) was created by matching each patient ≤50 y with 1 > 50 y, by use of nearest neighbour matching within a propensity score-based caliper of 0.20. The 2 cohorts were matched according to clinical local and nodal stage and to the type of surgery of the primary tumour. All subsequent analyses were performed on the matched cohort. Balance was checked after matching for each covariate. Averages were calculated using the median and interquartile range. Categorical data were analysed using Chi-square test. Non-parametric continuous data were analysed using Mann–Whitney U p Results After matching, 100 men with penile SCC aged ≤50 y and 100 men >50 y old were included in the analysis. The median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 46 y (40–49) vs. 65 y (59–73) ( p 1 Table 1 Baseline clinical and histopathological characteristics and oncological outcomes of patients ≤50 years and >50 years old.

We found that the number of new cases age ≤50 y increased steadily over the study period, this is in keeping with the ONS [ 3 2 13 14 15 16 17 The majority (82%) of the younger patients in our study underwent penile-preserving procedures, this is the mainstay of treatment for disease limited to the glans penis and the foreskin, in order to preserve urinary and sexual function, and has been shown to be associated with satisfactory cosmetic outcomes, without compromising oncological outcomes [ 18 20 The 5 years OS was higher for patients ≤50 y compared to >50 y, 78.1% vs. 63.1% ( p p Despite matching for clinical stage, the histological features and tumour grades were similar between men aged ≤50 y and those aged >50 y. This means that tumour characteristics are similar in the case of PeCa in young and older adults. Overall, this imply that PeCa can be fatal in all age groups, including young patients. Therefore, clinicians should not underestimate the aggressiveness of PeCa in young patients and research and management should focus on preventing PeCa and early detection [ 21 Veeratterapillay et al. [ 22 Overall, PeCa in young adults is an under-investigated field, despite observations of increase in its incidence [ 2 3 18 23 24 25 Limitations This study has a few limitations. The retrospective nature of the study may not have captured all the ≤50 y men managed at our centre. Being a tertiary centre, after primary surgery and a period of surveillance, patients are often discharged back to their local urology units, making it difficult to obtain long-term follow-up data. Our study spanned over 15 years and there have been a change in practice over the years such as the use of DSLNB [ 26 27 18 Conclusion Within our cohort, the number of men aged ≤50 y diagnosed with penile SCC increased over the past 15 years. The DSS, RFS and MFS are similar in the ≤50 y and >50 y groups. The overall survival was higher in the younger age group. PeCa in younger patients is just as fatal, public awareness and patient education is crucial for disease prevention, early detection and management.
