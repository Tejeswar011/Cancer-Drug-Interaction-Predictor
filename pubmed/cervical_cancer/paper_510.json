In this cross-sectional study, we sought to investigate whether the observed improvement is attributable to the anxiolytic, euphoric, and analgesic properties of alcohol, rather than or in addition to its effect on dystonic movements, as psychiatric symptoms and pain frequently occur in dystonia patients and as emotional stress is a well-established trigger for symptom exacerbation. Methods We analyzed data from 339 prospectively enrolled participants with recently diagnosed isolated dystonia (mean age: 55.2 ± 12.5 years, 228 female) of the Natural History Project of the Dystonia Coalition, a large international multicenter study. Alcohol responsiveness was determined by patients´ self-report. Symptoms of depression, as well as generalized and social anxiety, were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale. Severity of pain was measured using question 21 of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey. Results Participants with more severe pain reported greater response to alcohol than those with less severe pain ( p p p p Conclusion Alcohol responsiveness in isolated dystonia is associated with higher levels of pain, whereas self-reported alcohol-related improvements in dystonic movements or tremor do not depend on the euphoric or anxiolytic effects of alcohol. This finding underscores the potential role of pain management in alleviating motor symptoms in dystonia.

Should future research focus on exploring other GABA-enhancing substances, such as sodium oxybate, which mimics some effects of alcohol [ 18 Methods Participants Our analysis included participants’ baseline data from the Natural History Project of the Dystonia Coalition clinical database collected across 36 international recruiting sites (Online Resource 1). Only isolated dystonia patients, aged 18 years and older with dystonia onset no more than five years prior to study enrollment were included ( https://www.rarediseasesnetwork.org/cms/dystonia Participants of the Natural History Project answered a standardized questionnaire (Natural History Intake Form) , Questionnaire and rating scales Dystonia Coalition Questionnaire—Natural History Intake Form Demographic and clinical data included sex, age, affected body regions, presence of tremor, age at onset, disease duration, mutation in dystonia-related genes in study participants or relatives, presence of other movement disorders and family history of movement disorders. Alcohol responsiveness was assessed using the question ‘Has alcohol relieved the dystonia?’ with the answer options ‘yes’, ‘no’ or ‘unknown’. Patients who answered ‘unknown’ with regard to alcohol responsiveness were also excluded. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) The severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed with the HADS version 4 [ 19 Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) The severity of social anxiety symptoms was assessed with the LSAS [ 20 Pain Severity of pain was assessed using question 21 of the RAND 36-Item Health Survey 1.0 [ 21 Statistical analysis The associations of the severity of depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and pain with alcohol responsiveness were assessed using binary logistic regression with alcohol responsiveness as the dependent variable and HADS-D, HADS-A, LSAS and pain severity as independent variables, including a pairwise evaluation of interactions between the independent variable pain by the independent variables HADS-D, HADS-A, and LSAS. Goodness of fit was assessed by Nagelkerke R 2 1 Results Out of 615 participants, 12 were excluded based on clinical criteria. Of the remaining 603, 253 participants answered the question ‘Has alcohol relieved the dystonia?’ with ‘unknown’ either due to lack of alcohol consumption or a failure to remember. Out of the remaining 350 participants, 339 participants had complete data (mean age: 55.2 ± 12.5 years, female n 1 Table 1 Clinical data of the study cohort Alcohol responsive n Non-alcohol responsive n Sex Female 61.4% (51/83) 69.1% (177/256) Male 38.6% (32/83) 30.9% (79/256) Age 52.0 ± 12.5 56.3 ± 12.3 Main groups of dystonia Focal 61.4% (51/83) 62.9% (161/256) Segmental 25.3% (21/83) 30.9% (79/256) Multifocal/generalized 13.3% (11/83) 6.3% (16/256) Subgroups of focal dystonia Cranial 3.6% (3/83) 14.8% (38/256) Laryngeal 6.0% (5/83) 7.0% (18/256) Cervical 48.2% (40/83) 33.2% (85/256) Limb 3.6% (3/83) 7.8% (20/256) Depression (0–21) 20.5% (17/83) 24.6% (63/256) 4.6 ± 3.8 4.8 ± 4.4 Generalized Anxiety (0–21) 44.6% (37/83) 36.7% (94/256) 6.6 ± 4.1 6.5 ± 4.4 Social Anxiety (0–144) 41.0% (34/83) 44.9% (115/256) 28.7 ± 22.8 33.8 ± 27.3 Pain (1–6) 88% (73/83) 82.8% (212/256) 3.3 ± 1.4 2.9 ± 1.4 Sex and type of dystonia with percentage and numbers, as well as mean age with SD of patients with and without alcohol responsiveness.

Corresponding values of these red points as β X m For illustration, if a patient has a median value of 3 in the pain scale (26 social anxiety, 6 generalized anxiety, 4 depression scale), the corresponding estimates are 0.843 for pain severity (−0.312 for social anxiety, 0.174 for generalized anxiety, −0.192 for depression; see upper line); these are summed to be a total score of 0.516 (second to last line), which translates into a probability of alcohol responsiveness of 0.252. Discussion In this analysis of the large, multicenter Dystonia Coalition database, isolated adult-onset dystonia participants with more severe pain are more often responsive to alcohol than those with less severe pain. Alcohol responsiveness in dystonia was not associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms (depression, generalized anxiety and social anxiety), and there was no interaction between pain and psychiatric symptoms. The lack of an association between psychiatric symptoms and alcohol responsiveness in dystonia suggests that self-reported alcohol-related improvements of dystonia or tremor do not depend on the euphoric and anxiolytic effects of alcohol [ 22 23 Pain is a highly disabling complaint in isolated adult-onset dystonia [ 11 24 25 16 16 17 26 This study has limitations: Most importantly, alcohol responsiveness in this study was evaluated through self-assessment with limited response options (yes, no, unknown). A more comprehensive investigation of this phenomenon will require both subjective and, in particular, objective assessments of the impact of alcohol consumption on dystonia-related motor symptoms (e.g., posturing, tremor, duration of improvement). Additional important parameters include the degree of alcohol responsiveness, changes in drinking habits, as well as the degree and localization of pain and its modulation by alcohol. The inclusion of a placebo-controlled group would be advisable to validate these findings. Another limitation of our analysis is that disease duration of studied population was less than five years, which prevented the assessment of later disease stages. Patients with a known monogenic background of dystonia were excluded to control for a potential confounder, as they may exhibit a distinct neuropsychiatric profile and response to alcohol. It should be noted as a limitation that only carriers of known mutations in dystonia-related genes were excluded, while no systematic genetic screening was performed at the time of the analysis of our study. In the meantime, genetic data from the Dystonia Coalition cohort have also been published, which—similar to previous studies in other cohorts—demonstrate that the mutation frequency in isolated dystonia cases is generally very low, whereas the likelihood of detecting causative mutations is considerably higher in combined or complex dystonias, as demonstrated in a large dystonia cohort subjected to exome sequencing [ 9 27 28 9 29 In conclusion, we found that the severity of pain related to alcohol responsiveness in dystonia, highlighting the analgesic properties of alcohol in this alcohol responsive isolated dystonia population and the potential role of pain management in alleviating motor symptoms, in addition to new therapeutic approaches with other GABAergic substances such as sodium oxybate, which may mimic some effects of alcohol [ 18 Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
