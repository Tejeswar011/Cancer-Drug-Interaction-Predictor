Objective Studies have shown the benefit of ratios between cell types in full blood count for the diagnosis and prognosis of various pathologies, but its use in the investigation of lymphadenopathy is still controversial. The aim of this study is to assess whether there is a difference between the full blood count ratios of children and adolescents with lymphadenopathy who had benign or malignant causes identified in excisional biopsies during the investigation of lymphadenopathy. Method This is a cross-sectional observational study. A total of 72 participants between 0 and 17 years old who underwent an excisional lymph node biopsy and had their full blood count collected up to 15 days before the procedure were included. The participants were divided into two groups, malignant and benign, according to the biopsy result. Neutrophils/lymphocytes (N/L), monocytes/lymphocytes (M/L), and platelets/lymphocytes (P/L) ratios were then calculated and compared between the groups. Results The mean full blood count ratios for the benign and malignant groups, respectively, were: N/L 2.36 × 3.28 (p = 0.09) (p = ) (p = 0.249) Conclusion The use of full blood count ratios as predictors of malignant or benign results has no proven statistical significance. Higher ratio values tend towards malignant results but should be interpreted with caution, as this is only one of the factors to be considered during the investigation.

This condition can have many etiologies: infectious, immunological, endocrine, lymphoproliferative, medicinal, and neoplastic. In children, most peripheral lymphadenopathies have a benign and self-limiting cause, which can usually be identified through anamnesis and physical examination. The biggest predicament happens when the cause cannot be identified even with complementary tests and the symptom remains for more than four weeks. The main concern is the exclusion of malignant causes, such as lymphoma. 1 The gold standard test for lymphoma diagnosis is a histopathological analysis of the material obtained through an excisional biopsy, which allows a complete examination of the architecture of the lymph node. However, this is an invasive procedure, subject to inherent risks, as well as to those related to the use of general anesthesia. 2 3 Fine needle biopsy of the lymph node, despite being a minimally invasive option in adults, ends up having the same morbidity in children, since it is unlikely that a child will cooperate with the puncture, requiring sedation and analgesia in an environment with adequate support. In addition, this technique allows only cytological analysis, being more useful for collecting cultures than for histopathological analysis. A fine needle puncture without alterations does not exclude malignancy, since the puncture may have been performed in a healthy area of ​​the lymph node. In addition, if there is an alteration suggestive of lymphoma, an excisional biopsy is mandatory for the diagnosis and classification of the neoplasia. Thus, fine needle biopsy in children is a procedure with the same operational complexity as an excisional biopsy and contributes little to the etiology of lymph node enlargement. 4 , 5 The full blood count is a rapid, objective, widely accessible, and low-cost diagnostic tool. In addition to the absolute and relative concentrations of cellular types present in the peripheral circulation, relationships between different cell types have been researched, aiding in the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases. 6 7 7 , 8 Recent studies sought to assess the utility of the ratios obtained through the full blood count in differentiating patients who have received benign or malignant diagnoses through excisional lymph node biopsies. Çolak et al. 5 3 1 This study aims to assess whether there is a difference between the ratios of N/L, M/L, and P/L in full blood count of children and adolescents who have had benign or malignant causes identified in excisional biopsies during an investigation of lymphadenopathy. Methods This is an analytical cross-sectional study with retrospective data collection, approved by the institution's Research Ethics Committee. Initially, the present study evaluated 198 participants under the age of 18 who had undergone excisional lymph node biopsy at a tertiary public university hospital between 2011 and 2023 for a lymphadenopathy investigation. Within this group, the following were excluded: histopathological analysis of lymph nodes for staging solid tumors ( n n n n n Full blood count collected externally was excluded from the samples to maintain the uniformity of the analysis since all full blood count samples from the department are submitted to a microscopic analysis of the blood smear slide, in order to verify the automated results. Data such as date of birth, gender, age at the date of the biopsy, date of the biopsy, date of the full blood count, days between the collection of the full blood count and the biopsy, and description of the result of the histopathological analysis were collected from each patient's electronic medical record, along with the following full blood count parameters: erythrocyte count, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), leukocytes, basophils, eosinophils, band cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets, and mean platelet volume (MPV). White cells were considered as an absolute count. The N/L, M/L, and P/L ratios were calculated using the Microsoft Excel 365 software. According to the histopathological analysis of the biopsy, participants were divided into two groups (benign and malignant) for statistical comparison. The gender homogeneity in both groups defined by the biopsy result was evaluated by the Chi-Square test. The quantitative variables of participants with benign and malignant results were compared by the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test (or the Student's t p < 0.05 The reference values presented by Moosmann et al., [ 6 Results Of the 72 participants, 43 received a benign biopsy result and therefore were placed in the benign group, while 29 had a malignant result and were categorized under the malignant group. The prevalence of malignancy in the sample was 40.3%. Among the diagnoses considered benign, the following were reported: granulomatous disease ( n n n n n Table 1 Table 1 General sample characteristics and hematological parameters.

Fig 2 Considering the reference values published by Moosmann et al., [ 6 p = p Discussion In the present study, the N/L, M/L, and P/L ratios did not differ between cases of benign and malignant lymphadenopathy in children and adolescents. Most cases of lymphadenopathy have their etiology determined by clinical history, physical examination, and ancillary tests, but the most challenging ones may remain uncertain and require the gold standard test, that is, the excisional biopsy of the lymph node, to verify malignancy. The highest prevalence of lymphoma usually occurs from the age of 7, 9 Although mandatory for diagnosing malignancies, every biopsy resulting in reactive lymphadenopathy is deemed as unnecessary surgical intervention 5 10 Edomwonyi et al. 11 2 12 13 The use of biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes has been increasing. In the context of investigating lymphadenopathy, a new biomarker could indicate the need for a biopsy more precisely, avoiding unnecessary procedures without delaying the prognosis of malignancy. Studies have been published on serum markers that are highly predictive of lymphoma and refer to biopsies more accurately, such as soluble interleukin 2 receptor and serum thymidine kinase, although they are expensive and not widely available in practice. 5 The full blood count is a broadly accessible, cost-effective, objective, and rapid tool. However, its full potential in daily practice has yet to be fully explored. In addition to absolute and relative concentrations of cellular types, ratios between different cell types have been the subject of research, aiding in the diagnosis and prognosis of various diseases across diverse medical specialties. 6 Malignant tumors are surrounded by matrix and stromal cells, as well as the vascular and lymphatic network. These elements constitute the tumor microenvironment, which is closely linked to each stage of tumoral genesis. Hematological neoplasms are characterized by a microenvironment that is slightly different from solid tumors. 7 Lymphocytes are highly prevalent in the histopathology of lymphoma, and elevated intratumoral levels often predict a better outcome. The interaction between CD4+ and CD8+ is important for inducing tumor cell apoptosis. A low number of infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment may facilitate metastasis and recurrences. The presence of lymphopenia usually reflects severity and favors the escape of tumor cells from lymphocyte action. 7 , 14 8 Although neutrophils undeniably provide benefits in the context of infection and trauma, their role in oncogenesis is problematic. Despite exhibiting anti-tumoral activity, neutrophils also suppress cell destruction by immune cells and secrete multiple cytokines, such as interleukin-2, interleukin-10, and TNF-α, which promote tumoral genesis. This could be the reason why more than15% of malignant neoplasms are triggered by infections. 7 8 Monocytes play an important role in the microenvironment and should be considered as markers of high tumor load. Tumor-associated macrophages stimulate tumor cell proliferation, migration, and genetic instability, and promote the proliferation of blood and lymphatic vessels, which facilitates metastasis. In lymphomas, a higher density of intratumoral macrophages is associated with disease progression and a worse prognosis. 7 Platelets have a leading role both in the initial stage and in inflammation and immune response regulation, and can be considered perpetuators of the inflammatory cascade. 15 8 , 16 Regarding simple full blood count parameters, the present study found no difference between the groups. Kamiya et al., 3 1 5 5 1 The N/L ratio has been studied as a prognostic marker in infectious diseases, postoperative complications, and oncological diseases, and is a predictor of mortality in cardiovascular diseases, 6 1 , 17 , 18 , 19 5 , 20 , 21 1 5 The M/L and P/L ratios had no statistical relevance in this study as a diagnostic test. Kamiya et al. 3 1 Significant heterogeneity between the sample in this study and those of other authors was observed. The first difference found in the samples was the prevalence of malignancy. The present study found a prevalence of malignancy of 40.3%, a higher rate than that reported in the literature, between 13% and 27%. 1 Kamiya et al. 3 5 3 5 1 The main limiting factors of the present study were: sample size and selection bias, lack of knowledge about the comorbidities of the participants; and the liability of the full blood count, which could be influenced by other stressors up to 15 days before the biopsy. An expansion of the study sample and a meta-analysis for a systemic analysis of published studies on the subject are recommended for future research. In conclusion, there was no difference between the full blood count ratios of children and adolescents who had benign or malignant causes identified by excisional biopsy during the investigation of lymphadenopathy. Therefore, the use of full blood count ratios as a predictor of malignant or benign outcomes does not have enough proven statistical significance to be incorporated into daily practice. Given the literature presented, higher ratio values tend towards malignant results, but they should be interpreted with caution, emerging as only one of the factors to be considered during the investigation.
