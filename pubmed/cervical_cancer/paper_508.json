Previously classified as benign melanotic schwannomas, they were redefined as a potentially aggressive entity in the 2020 WHO classification of soft tissue tumors and later included in the 2021 WHO CNS classification. However, optimal therapeutic strategies remain under discussion. Case presentation We present the case of a 46-year-old Caucasian male who underwent surgery for an intra- and extraspinal cervical mass lesion at the C4/5 level on the left side. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis of MMNSTs. The patient initially presented with ataxia, left-sided weakness, and hemihypesthesia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine revealed a left intra- and extraspinal homogeneous contrast-enhancing mass at the C4/C5 level. After the first intraspinal partial resection, the diagnosis of MMNST was established. Gross-total resection is highly recommended in nearly all cases in the literature, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy in selected cases to prevent metastases, which occur in 15%–42% of cases. The patient postponed the second neurosurgical intervention and declined adjuvant radiotherapy. At 18 months after gross total resection, no recurrent tumor was detected by MRI. Conclusion Given the limited epidemiological knowledge on MMNSTs, our study contributes to the literature by documenting a case of intra- and extraspinal, cervical MMNST without any of the previously known driver mutations or copy number changes. While the WHO 2021 classification designates these tumors as potentially malignant, our findings support existing reports that more benign courses can occur. malignant melanotic nerve sheath tumor (MMNST) cervical nerve root melanotic schwannoma psammomatous melanotic schwannoma case report The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Neurosurgery 1 Introduction Malignant melanotic nerve sheath tumor (MMNST) is a rare peripheral nerve sheath tumor showing both Schwann cell and melanocytic differentiation. Although melanotic schwannomas have historically been considered as rather benign lesions, the 2021 WHO classification of central nervous system tumors defines MMNSTs as a potentially aggressive entity ( 1 2 MMNSTs often harbor PRKAR1A mutations, particularly in patients with Carney complex ( 3 4 5 3 6 7 Despite their classification as malignant, MMNSTs exhibit variable clinical behavior, ranging from indolent locally controlled disease to aggressive tumors with distant spread. Metastases have been reported, most commonly in the lungs ( 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Our case presents a cervical intra- and extraspinal MMNST without PRKAR1A mutation or copy number changes, a finding rarely documented in the literature. Since the most recent WHO classification, 18 intraspinal MMNSTs have been reported, including four located in the cervical spine and one at the cervicothoracic junction. This rare occurrence, with its unique molecular profile and favorable clinical course, contributes to the ongoing discussion of which MMNST subtypes exhibit aggressive behavior and which cases may warrant adjuvant therapy. 2 Case presentation A 46-year-old Caucasian male carpenter with a 6-week history of left-sided weakness and hemihypesthesia was admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery. Initial cranial imaging ruled out multiple sclerosis and stroke. Subsequent imaging revealed a contrast-enhancing intraspinal mass at the level of C4/C5, extending to the left side and encasing the left C5 nerve root up to the vertebral artery ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) preoperative images: sagittal view (A) (B) (C) (D ) Preoperative and postoperative MRI of the cervical spine. Sagittal (A) and axial (B) enhanced T1-weighted images preoperatively; sagittal (C) and axial (D) images postoperatively. Clinical examination revealed adduction paresis of the fingers of the left hand (muscle strength grade 3/5), atrophy of the interosseous muscles, distally accentuated hypesthesia of the left upper extremity, spasticity of the left lower extremity, and an unsteady gait with a tendency to fall to the left. Routine laboratory parameters, including markers of infection and inflammation, were within normal limits. The patient was very anxious and initially reluctant to undergo the proposed treatment. Only six weeks after the initial diagnosis he agreed to neurosurgical resection. Intraoperatively, the tumor was encapsulated by white, fibrous tissue, compressing the spinal cord and displacing it to the midline. Inside the capsule, black granular tissue triggered suspicion of melanoma, which was supported by the intraoperative frozen section analysis. Significant bleeding complicated the initial surgery. Due to persistent hemorrhage and the suspicion of malignancy, surgical resection was halted after intradural decompression of the spinal cord and partial lateral tumor removal. Following surgery, the patient initially presented with persistent hypesthesia of the right arm, distal weakness of the left arm with a muscle strength grade of 4/5, and proximal weakness of the right arm with a strength grade of 3/5. Over the course of follow-up, a gradual improvement was observed. The abduction weakness in the right arm persisted with a strength grade of 3/5, while left arm flexion improved to 4/5. Hypesthesia in the right arm showed regression. Additionally, gait steadiness improved progressively. Histologically, the tumor showed an epithelioid to spindle-shaped morphology with heavy melanotic pigmentation and moderate cellularity, arranged in short fascicles ( Figure 2A Figure 2 Representative microphotographs of HE and immunohistochemical staining are shown. HE staining shows a tumor with epithelioid to spindle-shaped morphology and heavy melanotic pigmentation, arranged in short fascicles (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) (G) (A–C,E) (D) (F,G) Histological microphotographs of the tumor. HE staining shows epithelioid to spindle-shaped cells with heavy pigmentation (A). Immunostaining shows positivity for MelanA (B) and SOX10 (C), retained PRKAR1A (D), low Ki-67 proliferation index (E), partial Cyclin D1 nuclear positivity (F), and negative mTOR staining (G). Scale bars: 50 μm (A–C, E), 100 μm (D), 20 μm (F, G). The tumor tissue demonstrated broad immunohistochemical positivity for S-100, MelanA, and HMB45, as well as for Sox10 ( Figures 2B,C Figure 2D Figure 2E Furthermore, molecular mutation detection and gene fusion analysis were initiated to exclude other morphological mimics of melanocytic tumors (primary CNS melanocytoma and melanoma, metastatic cutaneous melanoma). While these targeted analyses provided relevant molecular information, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was unfortunately not available due to technical reasons. DNA methylation profiling was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue from both the primary and recurrent tumor using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array (850k). Raw data were normalized and quality-controlled using the ChAMP R package. 17849 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) between the tumor samples and conventional schwannoma controls ( n limma p msigdbr clusterProfiler Significant enrichment of genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway was observed (e.g., MAP3K5, MAPK11, PDGFRB, RASGRF1). In contrast, no significant enrichment of genes involved in the mTOR signaling pathway was detected ( Figure 3A Figure 3B Figures 2F,G Figure 3 (A) x gene count p WP_MAPK_SIGNALING_PATHWAY adjusted p KEGG_MAPK_SIGNALING_PATHWAY adjusted p (B) MAP3K5 Methylation profiling of the tumor. t-SNE analysis shows clustering with MMNST (A). Copy number profile is flat without chromosomal\ngains or losses, calculated from the DKFZ database using the conumee package (B). Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) using a customized hybrid-capture panel covering all coding regions as well as selected intronic and promoter regions of 130 genes [as described by Sahm et al. ( 16 Mutation detection and gene fusion analysis were performed using the customized panels QIASeq targeted DNA Panel for Solid Tumors (Qiagen) and QIAseq targeted RNAscan Panel (Qiagen). High-throughput sequencing was then performed on a MiSeq (Illumina) instrument, which revealed wild-type sequences for the BRAF, NRAS, KIT, TERT, GNAQ, and GNA11 genes. Additionally, genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the EPIC Illumina Human Methylation 850 (850k) array v1.0. The methylation profile of the tumor was compared with previously defined methylation classes using the publicly available database of the German Center for Cancer Research (DKFZ) ( 17 www.molecularneuropathology.org Figure 4A 18 Figure 4B 19 Figure 4 tSNE analysis shows clustering with MMNSTs (black dot, marked with asterisk, SCHW_MEL). Proximal methylation classes include Schwannomas (SCHW), atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, subgroup SHH (ATRT_SHH), and chordoma (CHORDM) (A) www.molecularneuropathology.org (B) Panel A displays a bubble plot of the MAPK signaling pathway with gene ratio on the x-axis and significance indicated by color and size. Panel B is a heatmap showing gene expression differences between cases and controls, with higher expression in red and lower in blue. Gene names are listed on the side. Interestingly, the sarcoma classifier showed a match in the primary tumor for soft tissue clear cell sarcoma (Score: 0.96), but EWSR1/CREB1 or ATF1 gene fusion were excluded. Additionally, mutation analysis of PRKAR1A was performed using a customized enrichment/hybrid-capture-based panel of genes recurrently altered in brain tumors ( 16 This case represents an interesting molecular profile of an MMNST without PRKAR1A mutation, without any of the reported copy number changes, and without other previously known driver mutations. 3 Postoperative course Complete resection followed by radiotherapy was recommended by the sarcoma board and the interdisciplinary neuro-oncology board. At the time of considering a second neurosurgical intervention, the patient had not yet been able to resume his profession as a painter. Although gait and postural stability had significantly improved after the initial surgery, he continued to experience sensory disturbances in the left shoulder radiating to both thumbs and index fingers, more pronounced on the left side. Additionally, he reported paresthesia predominantly affecting the right thumb and persistent neck pain exacerbated by forward bending. Although no paresis of the upper extremities was present, he still suffered from exertional weakness. Only after careful consideration of the persistent symptoms and the recommendations did the patient agree to a second neurosurgical intervention, which was performed five months after the initial partial resection. This time, according to the view of the operative microscope and confirmed by early postoperative MRI ( Figure 1 Upon clinical reassessment based on the histologic diagnosis, the patient exhibited no clinical features indicative of Carney complex, such as pigmented skin lesions, cardiac myxoma, or endocrine dysfunction. Additionally, there was no family history of Carney complex or related syndromes. Subsequently, the patient agreed to undergo oncologic and radiotherapeutic counseling but continued to decline radiotherapy. His decision was influenced by the significant improvement in symptoms and the absence of recurrence on MRI. The most recent MRI, performed 18 months after the initial surgery, showed no evidence of recurrent disease. At the two-year follow-up, the patient reported only mild, persistent paresthesia. 4 Discussion We describe a rare case of a cervical MMNST with intra- and extraspinal extension, absence of PRKAR1A mutation, absence of detectable copy number changes, and a benign clinical course without adjuvant therapy. The patient remained recurrence-free for 24 months after gross total resection, suggesting that not all MMNSTs exhibit aggressive behavior. These findings are in line with recent reports of sporadic MMNSTs retaining PRKAR1A expression and lacking metastatic potential. Malignant melanotic nerve sheath tumors account for less than 1% of all primary peripheral nerve sheath tumors and most often arise from the spinal nerves or visceral autonomic nerves ( 20 22 23 24 MMNST has historically been regarded as an atypical variant of schwannoma and, due to its pigmentation, has been referred to as melanotic schwannoma ( 25 25 27 In some series, over 50% of patients with MMNSTs have evidence of Carney complex, an autosomal dominant, occasionally familial multiple neoplasia syndrome ( 27 19 28 31 27 32 33 29 34 19 3 The average age at diagnosis of MMNST is 41 years, with a reported range of 11–81 years, which corresponds well to our patient (46 years) ( 29 29 30 20 34 Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 Recently published MMNST cases since the 2021 WHO CNS classification.

Extramedullary neoplasms are often confused with meningiomas, dermoids, or schwannomas ( 35 36 Follow-up information in the available literature is heterogeneous and often limited. Reviewing publications that also included cases reported before the 2021 WHO classification revealed equivocal treatment results. Torres-Mora et al. reported a mean follow-up of 56 months (range, 1–300 months) in 26 patients, with frequent recurrences and metastases ( 29 37 38 39 Given the scarcity of reported cases, there are currently no established guidelines for the management of this tumor. Nevertheless, gross-total resection is recommended to minimize the risk of recurrence ( 40 42 42 43 41 However, our patient continues to decline radiation therapy. His case underscores the heterogeneity of MMNSTs, as some tumors may follow a more indolent course. Given the absence of recurrence up to now, 24 months postoperatively, it remains uncertain in which cases immediate adjuvant therapy is needed. Regular long-term follow-up is crucial to confirm the durability of this favorable outcome. 5 Conclusion Given the limited epidemiological knowledge about malignant melanotic nerve sheath tumors (MMNSTs), our study contributes to the literature by documenting a cervical intra- and extraspinal MMNST without previously described driver mutations or copy number changes. While the WHO 2021 classification designates these tumors as potentially malignant, our findings support existing reports that some cases may follow a more benign course. This case illustrates that predicting biological behavior can be challenging, even in the presence of a defined WHO classification. It is encouraging that the patient has experienced a favorable follow-up period after resection without irradiation or chemotherapy.
