Factors that participate in achieving the proper immune balance during pregnancy include glycoproteins that expose sugar residues recognized by specific lectin receptors. Several types of lectins and their ligands have been detected at the maternal-fetal interface, and changes in their expression levels have been correlated with pregnancy complications. Although the presence of potential sugar ligands for human macrophage galactose-type lectin (MGL), including LacdiNAc and (sialo)Tn antigen, has been detected in amniotic fluid, placenta and fetal tissues, the interaction between them and its possible role have not been elucidated so far. The aims of the present study were to evaluate reactivity of MGL with amniotic fluid proteins and to identify and characterize the amniotic ligands of MGL. The analysis proved the ability of MGL to interact with amniotic glycoproteins and revealed the potential protein carriers of glycans recognized by MGL, including mucins, mucin-like proteins, and uromodulin. Bioinformatics analysis assigned the identified glycoproteins as being involved in immune processes such as regulation of signaling pathways activated in the response to Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist stimulation or modulation of antimicrobial responses. Our research suggests that MGL-mediated interactions may be involved in maintaining the delicate immune balance during pregnancy. Our results may be helpful in future implementation of modern therapies based on the glycan ligands of MGL in the context of avoiding miscarriages and preterm birth.

Understanding the immunological interactions underlying this phenomenon has been the subject of intensive research since the middle of the last century, but to this day there are gaps in the knowledge about the immunological mechanisms accompanying pregnancy. Numerous cases of recurrent miscarriages, pre-term birth or preeclampsia, the cause of which is at least partially related to the maternal immune response, leave no doubt about the need for further research in this field 1 Important immunoregulatory factors that actively participate in achieving the proper immune balance during pregnancy include, among others, glycoproteins that expose sugar residues recognized by specific lectin receptors 2 9 10 12 13 16 Recently, there has been growing interest in the macrophage galactose-type C-type lectin (MGL, also known as CLEC10A/CD301), which belongs to the CTL family 17 17 20 21 24 25 10 26 29 2 30 31 Interaction of MGL with its ligands on CD45 reduces T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways, leading to inhibition of T-cell proliferation, reduced synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and therefore accelerated T-cell apoptosis. On the other hand, in MGL-expressing DCs, ligand binding augments signal transduction pathways, which increases secretion of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced IL-10 20 32 33 34 35 17 20 22 36 38 Many of the MGL-mediated interactions described so far concern microbial pathogenesis. Some CTLs evolved to differentiate ligands as self and non-self structures 39 40 17 41 42 43 47 The Tn antigen, recognized by MGL, is a structure closely related to cancer cells. Its overexpression promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness and has been associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis 48 51 22 52 17 20 53 According to the human fetoembryonic defense system (Hu-FEDS) hypothesis, the mechanisms involved in achieving maternal immune tolerance are similar to those that pathogens and metastatic cancer cells use to evade host immune surveillance and are based on recognition of specific glycans by lectins. The hypothesis assumes that soluble and cell surface glycoproteins associated with fertilization and pregnancy expose unique carbohydrate structures that have not been found in other normal tissues outside of the human reproductive system, and such glycosylation patterns are acquired or mimicked by persistent pathogens and aggressive tumor cells to target specific counterreceptors 2 3 54 56 In the light of the assumptions of the Hu-FEDS hypothesis, the immunomodulatory function of MGL, and data on the presence of oncofetal (sialyl)Tn antigen and LacdiNAc epitope in amniotic fluid and fetal tissues 2 10 26 31 Methods Clinical material Amniotic fluid samples were obtained from women ( n g 57 Western blot Western blot was used for the preliminary assessment of the presence of MGL ligands in amniotic fluid. Pooled samples of amniotic fluid were separated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). SDS-PAGE was conducted according to the standard Laemmli procedure 58 59 2+ Vicia villosa Wisteria floribunda MGL pull-down assay To identify amniotic fluid glycoproteins interacting with MGL, magnetic Protein G beads (Dynabeads Protein G Immunoprecipitation Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Baltics UAB, Vilnius, Lithuania) were used following the manufacturer’s protocol with the modification described by Pirro et al. 60 2+ Affinity chromatography To confirm that the proteins released in the pull-down assay indeed carried carbohydrate structures constituting a target for MGL, affinity chromatography was performed using agarose-immobilized plant lectins, namely VVL and WFL (Vector Labs, Vector Laboratories, Mowry Ave, Newark, CA, US), specific for single GalNAc or LacdiNAc epitopes respectively. A pooled sample of amniotic fluid, containing 0.4 mg of protein, was mixed with 400 µL of lectin-agarose in TBS and stirred gently overnight at 4 °C. The unbound proteins were washed out on the column and lectin-reactive glycoproteins were eluted with 0.2 M GalNAc in 0.2 M acetate buffer, pH = 4.0. The released proteins were immediately neutralized, buffer exchanged against PBS, washed three times and concentrated on 3 kDa MWCO protein concentrators (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In the next step, 7.5 µL of each isolate was separated by SDS-PAGE in a 12.5% gel, and to detect proteins, a silver-staining procedure 59 Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) identification of glycoproteins In-gel digestion Mass spectrometry experiments were performed at the Mass Spectrometry Laboratory at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics PAS. Gel pieces were dried with acetonitrile (ACN) and subjected to reduction with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min at 57 °C. Cysteines were then alkylated with 0.5 M iodoacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate (45 min in a darkroom at RT) and proteins were digested overnight with 10 ng/µL trypsin (Promega GmbH) in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C. Protein digestion Precipitates were reconstituted in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (ABC). Samples were incubated for 60 min on a vortex with 5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at 60 °C, followed by the addition of methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) to a final concentration of 20 mM. Protein digestion was performed overnight using 0.5 µg of trypsin (Promega GmbH) at 37 °C. Peptides were then acidified to 0.1% formic acid (FA). Mass spectrometry Samples were analyzed using an LC-MS system comprising an Evosep One (Evosep Biosystems) directly coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One third of each sample was loaded onto disposable Evotips Pure C18 trap columns (Evosep Biosystems) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Chromatographic separation was achieved at a flow rate of 220 nL/min or 500 nL/min with an 88-min or 44-min preformed gradient using a PepSep analytical column (C18, 1.5 μm beads, 150 μm ID, 15 cm long, Bruker). Data acquisition was conducted in positive ion mode using a data-dependent method. The MS1 resolution was set at 60,000 with a normalized automatic gain control (AGC) target of 300%, automatic maximum injection time, and a scan range of 300 to 1600 m/z. For MS2, the resolution was set at 15,000 with a standard normalized AGC target, automatic maximum injection time, and the top 40 precursors within a 1.6 m/z isolation window were selected for MS/MS analysis. Dynamic exclusion was applied for 20 s with a mass tolerance of ± 10 ppm, and the precursor intensity threshold was set at 5 × 10 3 Data analysis Obtained raw data were preprocessed with Mascot Distiller (version 2.8, Matrixscience) and protein identification was performed with Mascot Server (version 2.8.3, Matrixscience) using the Homo sapiens Bioinformatics analysis The STRING 12.0 database (STRING Consortium, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Lausanne, Switzerland, access 31 October 2024) 61 Results Detection of MGL ligands For the preliminary assessment of MGL reactivity with amniotic fluid proteins, lectin-blotting analysis was performed. The pooled samples of amniotic fluid were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to the silver staining procedure (Fig. 1 1 S1 1 1 1 1 1 2+ S1 1  Fig. 1 Lectin-reactivity patterns of pooled amniotic fluid samples with specified Gene Ontology assignments for proteins contained in each lectin-reactive fraction: a b c d e S1  Table 1 Proteins contained in lectin-reactive bands identified by LC–MS.

Hits with scores above 1000 were included in the analysis. The most significant terms of Gene Ontology are presented in Fig. 1 Isolation and identification of MGL ligands To assess which proteins are the actual ligands for MGL, a pull-down assay was carried out to isolate those that are MGL-reactive. Additionally, affinity chromatography using agarose-immobilized plant lectins, namely VVL and WFL, specific for terminal GalNAc/LacdiNAc sugar epitopes, was performed.

Among the plant lectins ligands, only those that overlap with MGL-binding proteins are included. Scale represents LC-MS scores. The presence of such a modification in DMBT1 was also suggested by searching the LC-MS/MS data for glycopeptides carrying a single HexNAc (N-acetylhexosamine) linked to serine and threonine residue in the polypeptide backbone—potentially corresponding to O-linked single GalNAc/Tn antigen. Representative spectral data containing the glycopeptides with specific HexNAc ions at m/z 203.0794 have been extracted and presented in Fig. 3  Fig. 3 MS/MS fragmentation of A B Bioinformatics analysis Protein–protein interaction network The STRING database was used to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network complex. Two analyses were performed, the first for the most efficiently binding MGL ligands (with the highest scores)—with a cut-off score of 400—and their functional partners (A) and the second for a broader set of proteins with scores above 100 (B). The PPI network contained 13 nodes and 25 edges for analysis A (Fig. 4 5 4 5 DMBT1 MUC5AC MUC5B MUC7 TFF2 BPIFA1 BPIFB1 BPIFB2 FGB SFTPA1 SFTPA2 APOA1 APOB FGA FGB FGG HBB LYZ S100A8 TF ZG 16B ANXA1 CD9 EPS8L2 EZR FLG2 IST1 MSN PDCD6IP SDCBP BPIFB1 DCD DMBT1 MUC1 MUC5AC MUC5B SFTPA2 UMOD  Fig. 4 STRING analysis of glycoproteins identified as most efficiently binding MGL ligands and their functional partners.

A B D E https://string-db.org Gene ontology and reactome pathways enrichment analysis Functional enrichment analysis for sets of isolated proteins were performed using online databases. The enrichment was considered in the category of biological processes—in terms of Gene Ontology (GO) as well as pathways—using Reactome pathways. The first category of enrichment (biological processes) for analysis A assigned analyzed proteins/genes as involved in the antimicrobial humoral response and the latter (pathways) identified most of the genes as significantly enriched in innate immune system processes (Fig. 4 5 Discussion In humans, sugars attached to a protein or lipid core can act as specific markers on the surfaces of cells or soluble macromolecules. The large diversity in glycan structures and composition allows for the storage of biological information in these structures 62 63 64 65 66 68 69 70 40 Protein-sugar interactions are also important at various stages of the fertilization process and pregnancy 71 6 72 2 3 Over time, researchers began to analyze the role of lectins—recognizing particular glycan structures—in interactions regulating the immune response in pregnancy, such as galectins or Siglecs 9 11 73 76 2 10 26 31 Our preliminary analysis revealed calcium-dependent binding of MGL to glycoproteins contained in electrophoretically separated amniotic fluid fractions. The analysis identified five MGL-reactive fractions with molecular mass from 245 to 23 kDa. Proteomic profiling of the fractions revealed a broad panel of proteins engaged mainly in immunological processes as well as having regulatory properties in metabolic/biological processes and in maintaining homeostasis in the human body. Numerous proteins are engaged in the response to stress and other stimuli, including external stimuli. To indicate which proteins actually exhibit MGL binding ability, a pull-down assay was carried out to isolate those that are MGL-reactive. Additionally, lectin affinity chromatography with agarose-immobilized plant lectins—VVL and WFL (specific for terminal GalNAc/LacdiNAc) was used in parallel. The analysis showed a greater similarity between the protein composition of the WFL eluate and the set of proteins identified in the MGL-pull down assay than between the proteins contained in isolates of the VVL and MGL-pull down assay. WFL recognizes LacdiNAc structure with greater affinity than GalNAc, whereas VVL shows preference for a single GalNAc residue attached directly to a serine or threonine in the polypeptide backbone via an O-glycosidic bond (Tn antigen) 77 79 The most relevant ligands binding MGL, as well as WFL, seem to be: mucins—MUC5AC and MUC5B; BPIFB1; DMBT1; and UMOD. As mentioned above, some of the proteins identified in our study, i.e. mucins and uromodulin, but also glycodelin A, form the basis of the original Hu-FEDS assumptions. According to the available data, glycodelin A shows the presence of LacdiNAc—a glycan acting as a sugar ligand for MGL 2 31 80 An interesting result is the ability of MGL to bind uromodulin. UMOD is a protein exclusively produced by the kidney, and it has been detected in the urine of pregnant women and amniotic fluid—which it reaches along with the fetal urine 81 85 83 86 87 88 87 88 Our study identified MUC5AC and MUC5B as the main amniotic ligands for MGL. Mucin-5B has already been identified as an amniotic fluid protein 89 90 91 92 91 93 93 93 The amniotic fluid shows various defense mechanisms to prevent intra-amniotic infections and inflammation. Amniotic antimicrobial proteins and peptides provide the front-line defense in the innate immune response 94 95 97 98 99 100 Bioinformatics analysis of the protein-protein interaction network and functional enrichment of the panel of isolated MGL ligands may support the above assumptions, indicating the participation of most of the identified proteins and their partners in the immune response, the response against pathogens, and the regulation of TLR signaling. Interestingly, the impact of MGL engagement on TLR pathways has been extensively analyzed. It has been found that MGL-mediated induction of immunosuppressive IL-10 requires concomitant TLR stimulation, e.g. TLR4 induced by bacterial LPS. Research has demonstrated that MGL interaction with its specific ligand modulates TLR signal transduction for enhanced IL-10 and TNF-α synthesis 37 101 Moreover, our analysis showed that some isolated proteins participate in CLR signaling, which may support their ability to be recognized by MGL and possibility to act in a network of interactions with other CLRs. In addition to immunological processes, the analysis also assigned a group of identified proteins as engaged in O-glycan processing, including termination or defective O-glycan biosynthesis. It suggests that MGL binding of proteins included in this group (mucins) may occur through O-linked glycans. Another interesting annotation is surfactant metabolism. Considering this enrichment, it is worth mentioning one of the surfactant proteins: SFTPA2. SFTPA2 was isolated using the MGL-pull down assay, although it was not detected among VVL and WFL ligands. As mentioned, SFTPA2 is a binding partner for DMBT1, so its co-isolation is possible, especially since the protein has a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) that allows it to bind other glycoproteins 102 102 103 104 103 104 102 Although MGL has recently been the subject of intensive research, especially in the context of carcinogenesis and infectious disease 17 20 53 Nevertheless, MGL has the potential to be an important factor in maintaining homeostasis during gestation, orchestrating signaling pathways to resolve inflammation and preventing the activation of pathways related to premature birth during the fight against microorganisms. Thus, the MGL-mediated interactions may be an important part of the signaling network that ensures the critical immune balance necessary to maintain the fetus in the uterus. However, future studies are essential for elucidating the exact nature and role of the interactions between MGL and amniotic fluid ligands. Conclusions We have demonstrated for the first time the potential ligands of MGL in amniotic fluid which may participate, via MGL binding, in development of immune homeostasis—essential for the maintenance of pregnancy and the prevention of miscarriage and preterm birth. However, full understanding of this issue remains elusive, warranting further exploration. We suggest that the identified amniotic MGL ligands may serve in future as predictors in assessing the risk of preterm birth. Their exact glycosylation profile and the exact nature of binding to MGL are also worth investigating, as they may be helpful in the development and implementation of modern therapies in the context of avoiding preterm birth.
