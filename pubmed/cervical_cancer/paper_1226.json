Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third-most common cancer globally and stands as the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The incidence of CRC is rising among individuals younger than 50, particularly in high-income countries. This increase is associated with some risk factors, such as obesity, sedentary habits, and the consumption of antibiotics, red meats, alcohol, and tobacco. Another important factor is gut inflammation, such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), that represent up to 18% increased risk of developing CRC [ 1 2 The etiological origin of CRC can be categorized into three main types: hereditary cases, which account for 10% of all occurrences; familial history-related cases, comprising 25%; and sporadic cases, which represent 65% [ 3 4 Colorectal tumors are classified in four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs): (1) CMS1: hypermutated tumors characterized by microsatellite instability and strong immune activation, (2) CMS2: tumors exhibiting high levels of somatic copy number mutations and activation of the wingless-related integration site (WNT) and myelocytomatosis (MYC) signaling pathways, (3) CMS3: tumors demonstrating metabolic deregulation, and (4) CMS4: tumors associated with a mesenchymal phenotype, stromal infiltration, angiogenesis, activation of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway, and a strong inflammatory response [ 5 Chronic inflammation is a hallmark of cancer that drives tumorigenesis and tumor progression [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 The hygiene hypothesis proposes that a lack of exposure to microorganisms, mainly pathogens, during childhood may lead to an imbalanced immune response and increase the risk of developing inflammatory diseases such as allergies, asthma, and autoimmune diseases [ 12 13 Helicobacter pylori 14 Helminths are a group of parasites that include nematodes (roundworms), trematodes (flukes), and cestodes (tapeworms) [ 15 16 17 Although helminthiasis is recognized as a public health problem, many researchers employ various models to understand how helminths evade and modulate the immune response, and to develop therapies for inflammatory diseases. Experimental studies have consistently demonstrated a close association between helminth infections and favorable changes in the progression of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including inflammation-associated cancers such as CRC [ 18 How do helminth infections influence cancer outcomes? The existing literature presents two different perspectives. Experimental studies in CRC models show that helminths may accelerate disease progression and lead to worse outcomes, while others indicate that helminths could help reduce tumor burden [ 19 Table 1 Figure 1 2. The Impact of Helminth Infections on Colorectal Cancer Helminthiases are among the most prevalent infections worldwide, affecting nearly 24% of the global population [ 42 43 There are several general mechanisms by which helminth infections and their products may impact CRC development either positively or negatively: (1) indirect bypass affecting the host’s immune responses, (2) direct carcinogenic or anti-carcinogenic effect, (3) acute or chronic histo-mechanical damage, (4) altering the homeostasis of the microbiome, and (5) antigenic cross reactivity given a molecular mimicry. The first section examines the negative and positive effects of helminth infections on the development of CRC. The second section, entirely experimental, discusses the impact of helminth-derived products at different stages of CRC onset in preclinical assays or in in vitro models, focusing on the mode of action involved in this disease. Notably, the primary mechanisms discussed involve modulating the host’s immune response, likely due to the characteristics of the in vivo models used in the reviewed literature ( Table 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 2.1. Pro-Tumorigenic Effects of Helminthic Infections in CRC Few helminth parasites have been identified as direct causes of cancer development. In its monographs on identifying carcinogenic hazards to humans, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies infections with the helminths Opisthorchis viverrini Schistosoma haematobium Schistosoma japonicum 14 Figure 2 Patients with CRC who also show a Schistosoma 25 43 S. japonicum 21 26 22 23 Chronic inflammation is a critical factor that contributes to the development of CRC [ 11 Schistosoma mansoni 44 S. mansoni 44 S. mansoni 24 45 46 In intestinal living helminths, other mechanisms may influence CRC outcomes. In a study using the alkylating agent azoxymethane (AOM) and the polysaccharide dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) model, mice infected with Heligmosomoides polygyrus, 47 H. polygyrus Accordingly, H. polygyrus 47 H. polygyrus 47 IL-6 20 48 H. polygyrus Another case that highlights how intestinal helminths can affect CRC outcomes is the infection with Trichuris muris T. muris 49 T. muris Approximately 25% of CRC patients have a family history of the disease. Familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome (FAP) is characterized by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC 28 APC min/+ APC 50 APC min/+ T. muris + + + T. muris 49 T. muris As previously mentioned, the niches where helminths reside may influence the effects of helminthiasis on CRC outcomes. To explore this further, an experiment was conducted using the APC min/+ H. polygyrus T. muris, T. muris H. polygyrus 49 H. polygyrus H. polygyrus 47 Another exclusive intestinal helminth infection is that caused by Syphacia muris. 51 27 52 27 S. muris 51 At least four different helminth infections, caused by Schistosoma T. muris S. muris H. polygyrus Figure 2 Figure 2 2.2. Anti-Tumorigenic Effects of Helminthic Infections The gut microbiota is an ecosystem made up of bacteria, fungi, viruses, Archaea, and parasites that interact with IECs to maintain homeostasis. This ecosystem plays a crucial role in the fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates, nutrient absorption, vitamin synthesis, and modulation of host immunity. When the function or composition of the microbiota is disrupted, this condition is referred to as dysbiosis, which is associated with several diseases, including CRC [ 53 In CRC patients, dysbiosis is characterized by an increase in pathogenic bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum Veillonella Prevotella Streptococcus 54 It is not hard to think that gastrointestinal-living helminths may modulate the microbiome in such tissue. Several reports indicate specific alterations in the microbiota in humans and murine models. Different species of all helminth classes have been associated with changes in the gut microbiome [ 55 56 53 T. muris H. polygyrus Bacteroides vulgatus Clostridium species 57 S. mansoni S. mansoni S. mansoni 58 Hymenolepis diminuta 59 S. mansoni H. diminuta 60 Taenia crassiceps T. crassiceps T. crassiceps 61 In the AOM/DSS CRC model, mice pre-infected six weeks earlier with T. crassiceps T. crassiceps 62 32 Trichinella spiralis 63 Unlike protumor helminth infections that promote tumor growth and trigger an inflammatory response in the intestine, mice pre-infected with T. crassiceps hi 62 T. crassiceps T. crassiceps T. crassiceps 64 This section summarizes the connection between the immune response triggered by helminth infections and their significant impact on the development of CRC, particularly in the early stages of the disease. The reviewed literature suggests that particular helminth species promote a local inflammatory response or a localized injury that actively supports protumor activity, thereby facilitating the initiation of CRC ( Figure 2 T. crassiceps Figure 3 Based on these observations, we hypothesized that a delicate balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in the host influences the effects of helminth infections on tumorigenesis in the early stages of sporadic CRC. In this context, helminth infections that stimulate an inflammatory response in the intestine may lead to tissue damage and the formation of tumors in the colon. Conversely, an anti-inflammatory response could help modulate intestinal inflammation, reducing tissue damage and preventing tumorigenesis in the colon. The precise mechanisms by which helminth infections trigger inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses are still being elucidated. Intestinal helminths attach themselves to the epithelium through specialized structures, such as the scolex, which results in tissue damage [ 15 65 3. The Impact of Helminth-Derived Products on Colorectal Cancer While certain helminth infections may have beneficial effects on CRC, using whole live parasites as helminth therapy is impractical and could pose a health risk to patients, as several studies have indicated. Although helminthiasis is generally not fatal, it can lead to several health issues, including anemia, malnutrition, stunted growth, internal organ blockage, and organ damage. Additionally, it can cause immune-related problems such as chronic inflammation, fibrosis, granuloma formation, and immunosuppression, depending on where the parasite is located [ 66 Trichuris suis NCT01433471 NCT03565939 NCT01576471 NCT01434693 NCT01279577 NCT03079700 67 To avoid the potentially serious adverse effects of whole and long-term helminth therapy, recent studies have focused on analyzing helminth-derived products as an alternative. Helminths excrete and secrete several products, including metabolites, glycans, lipids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, glycolipids, proteins, and glycoproteins. Helminth-derived products primarily interact with the host immune system in two principal ways: either by inducing a protective immune response or by evading the host immune response. Currently, these effects are studied as potential immunomodulatory and biotherapeutic drugs for chronic inflammatory diseases, including inflammation-associated cancers [ 68 Anti-Tumorigenic Effects In 1970, Berton Zbar and his colleagues demonstrated that immunization with the attenuated Bacillus Calmette–Guerin (BCG) could stimulate the immune cells to target cancer cells. Today, BCG is an approved treatment for bladder cancer [ 69 In a heterotopic syngeneic mouse model of CRC, researchers transplanted the CRC cell line CT26 (5 × 10 5 Echinococcus granulosus 70 Immunizing mice with HCF before tumor induction using the heterotopic syngenic model of CRC (CT26 colorectal cells) reduces tumor incidence by 40%. Moreover, administration of HCF at 4-, 7-, and 10-day post-tumor induction increases mouse survival by 40%. Additionally, anti-HCF antibodies generated in rabbits can target CT26 CRC cells. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that these anti-HCF antibodies also recognize the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), found in E. granulosus, 34 Given that antibodies against E. granulosus Helminth-derived products are significant sources of parasite antigens recognized by the host immune system. The presentation of these antigens leads to the production of antibodies against helminth products [ 16 O 35 Helminths influence the host’s immune system through their derived products [ 16 T. spiralis S. mansoni 71 71 Other helminth-derived molecules have also been tested against CRC. The larval phase of T. crassiceps 61 T. crassiceps 38 The underlying mechanism of this inhibition involves a reduction in STAT3 phosphorylation through the downregulation of the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). The inhibition of the IL-6-STAT3 signaling pathway was confirmed by a reduction in the transcription of STAT3 target genes, including DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and Cyclin D1 [ 38 39 72 38 Like T. crassiceps 38 73 74 38 38 These findings demonstrate that the immunomodulatory properties of helminth-derived products can be harnessed as a prophylactic strategy to reduce intestinal inflammation and prevent tumor formation effectively. Furthermore, pursuing new treatment strategies, particularly combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy, is essential to improve patient outcomes [ 75 76 The effective antitumor effect of combined treatment (TcES+5-FU) was associated with increased infiltration of cytotoxic cells, such as natural killer cells (NK), which promote tumor cell apoptosis by releasing granzyme B. In addition, this combined treatment also reduced the expression of murine double minute 2 (MDM2), a P53 repressor, leading to the upregulation of P53 and P21, suggesting that combined treatment leads to cell cycle arrest of tumor cells [ 76 The regulation of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes observed in the treatment of ES helminth products raises the question of whether there is direct interaction between helminth ES products and CRC tumor cells. Our next section will address this question. 4. The Impact of Helminth-Derived Products on Colorectal Cancer, Beyond the Immune System The revised reports above have primarily focused on the impact of helminths on CRC through modulation of the immune system. However, since intestinal helminths reside in the gastrointestinal tract, they come into direct contact with epithelial and tumor cells. This raises the question: what effects does this interaction have? To understand this, it is necessary to consider the two main models that explain the cellular origin of CRC. The first is the bottom-up model, which is associated with hereditary or familial history factors and suggests that CRC originates from stem cells at the bottom of intestinal crypts. The second is the top-down model, linked to sporadic cases of CRC, which posits that the cancer arises from stem-like cells at the top of the crypts [ 40 77 Several effects of helminths on the gut epithelium have been documented. These effects include increased epithelial permeability, degradation of mucus, and mechanical damage, all of which promote alarmin production. Additionally, it has been hypothesized that helminths influence stem cell differentiation towards specific lineages, which helps maintain epithelial integrity while enhancing the persistence of the worm. In response, host epithelial cells can activate various signaling pathways to defend against these infections. These protective mechanisms include mucus production, cellular proliferation, and activation of the immune response [ 78 4.1. Pro-Tumorigenic Effects of Helminth-Derived Products Few studies have reported direct pro-tumorigenic effects of helminth-derived molecules on CRC tumor cells. For example, exposure of the HT29-D4 human CRC cell line to 1 μg/mL of conditioned medium from Trichostrongylus colubriformis T. colubriformis 79 Trichostrongylus vitrinus Cooperia curticei 30 Cell migration is a key step in cancer invasion and metastasis, reflecting the pathological grades of malignancy associated with cancer cells [ 6 H. polygyrus H. polygyrus 29 4.2. Anti-Tumorigenic Effects of Helminth-Derived Products The direct antitumor effects of helminth-derived products on CRC cell lines have been studied in several helminth species and in greater depth. Initial reports indicate that ES products from Nematodirus battus 30 Ascaris lumbricoides 37 N. battus A. lumbricoides Further investigations have explored the mechanisms behind the direct antitumor effects of helminth-derived products in several CRC cell lines. Research using the mouse CT26 cell line indicated that cells treated with egg antigens from S. mansoni H. polygyrus H. polygyrus 29 On the other hand, experiments using the human cell line HCT116 demonstrated that HES reduced cell viability and DNA synthesis without impacting mitochondrial activity. The antigens from H. polygyrus H. polygyrus 29 These observations highlight the differences in the anti-tumorigenic activity of antigens among helminth species and the variations between total and ES antigens. Such differences may result in varying impacts on CRC cells. It is important to consider that helminth-derived products might induce species-specific responses, exhibiting a range of effects on CRC cells depending on their origin. Recent studies, like those conducted using H. polygyrus E. granulosus 33 TcES also directly affected human CRC cell lines alone and in combination with the chemotherapeutic agent 5-FU. In one study, exposure of the human CRC cell line RKO to 12.5 μg/mL of TcES for 72 h reduced cell numbers, although it did not affect cell viability. Furthermore, TcES induced changes in cell morphology and promoted the formation of colonospheres by reorganizing the actin cytoskeleton. Like those results observed in the AOM/DSS mouse model, TcES decreased NFκB activation in RKO cells stimulated with 0.5 mg/mL of LPS for 20 min. Notably, the inhibition of c-RAF reversed the downregulation of NFκB, suggesting that TcES may operate through the c-RAF signaling pathway [ 38 36 S. mansoni 80 E. granulosus 81 The combined therapy using 50 μg of TcES and 10 μM of 5-FU reduced the proliferation and migration of the HCT116 and RKO cell lines. The treatment upregulated P53 and P21 proteins and decreased Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1), a proto-oncogenic protein [ 76 In summary, the findings reviewed suggest that several factors influence the antitumoral effects of helminth-derived products and could involve a range of mechanisms ( Figure 3 E. granulosus 82 T. spiralis 83 A. lumbricoides 37 T. crassiceps 84 85 5. The Impact of Isolated Molecules from Helminths in Colorectal Cancer Modulation 5.1. Pro-Tumorigenic Effects Some researchers have focused on isolating specific molecules that preserve the primary biological function of whole helminth-derived products to better understand and identify them, and to reduce exposure to inactive molecules from helminths. The molecule SjE16.7 has been identified as an EF-hand calcium-binding protein released from the eggs of S. japonicum Escherichia coli 86 This effect correlated with the accumulation of myeloid cells (CD11b+), Tregs, and a reduction in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The myeloid subset was primarily composed of Gr1 hi 86 86 86 As previously mentioned, ROS contributes to tissue damage and the development of colorectal tumors. In this regard, the immunomodulatory effects observed in macrophages could be proposed as a potential protumor mechanism of SjE16.7. Conversely, the increased FOXP3+ Tregs and the decreased CD4+ and CD8+ T cells indicate an immunosuppressive microenvironment mediated by SjE16.7, which may facilitate tumor progression. Given the contrasting immunomodulatory effects of SjE16.7, it is essential to investigate the patterns of cell infiltration in the colon induced by this molecule. Additionally, the recognition of SjE16.7 by CRC cell lines suggests that SjE16.7 may have a direct protumor effect. 5.2. Anti-Tumorigenic Effects Another helminth-identified molecule, but with contrasting effects, is the recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c2 (rNAPc2), which is a protein isolated initially from Ancylostoma caninum Pichia pastoris 31 87 The antitumor effects of rNAPc2 have been proven in several CRC mouse models. In the APC min/+ 88 The combination of rNAPc2 with chemotherapeutic drugs or specific antibodies has been shown to inhibit tumor formation. In a model involving human HCT116 xenograft transplantation into nude mice, those treated with rNAPc2, 5-FU, or bevacizumab (an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody) exhibited tumor volume reduction compared to untreated mice. However, mice receiving the combined therapy rNAPc2 and 5-FU or rNAPc2 and bevacizumab demonstrated a remarkable tumor volume reduction, even greater than that observed in the individual treatments. Additionally, mice treated with these combined therapies showed reduced angiogenesis and inhibition of tumor cell proliferation [ 88 The anti-metastatic effects of rNAPc2 have been demonstrated in several CRC mouse models. In a study where pulmonary metastasis was induced by injecting CT26 cells into the tail vein, mice treated with increasing doses of rNAPc2, ranging from 10 to 1000 µg/kg, exhibited reduced lung weight and a lower number of surface metastases compared to untreated controls. Additionally, in a liver metastasis model where human HCT116 cells were administered via the portal vein to nude mice, those treated with rNAPc2 or the chemotherapeutic irinotecan (CPT-11) showed a decrease in tumor areas in the liver. Notably, the anti-metastatic effect was enhanced when rNAPc2 and CPT-11 were given together [ 88 As mentioned above, rNAPc2 inhibits the TF complex, which is associated with angiogenesis and metastasis. For these reasons, authors have proposed that rNAPc2 antitumor effects may be linked to the surface expression of TF on tumor cells. Experiments using HCT116 cells with TF knockdown showed that these cells have slower growth in nude mice xenografts compared to HCT116 parental cells. Interestingly, tumors induced by HCT116 TF knockdown cells are resistant to the antitumor effects of rNAPc2 compared to HCT116 parental cells. In summary, the reviewed literature indicates that helminths can have both negative and positive effects on the initiation and progression of CRC ( Table 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 41 Figure 4 On the other hand, ongoing clinical trials are investigating the use of helminth-derived products for the treatment of several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and IBD. In these trials, the efficacy and safety of helminth-derived products have been demonstrated, with some yielding successful results [ 89 90 Thus, it is not impossible to achieve this in a few years, once isolated or enriched helminth-derived products are molecularly better characterized and tested in CRC. 6. Concluding Remarks In this review, we gathered evidence on how helminths influence outcomes in CRC. Helminths and their products can either promote or inhibit colonic tumor progression depending on various factors, such as the species of helminths, their primary site of localization, the origin of the colorectal tumor, and the stage of the disease. While several physiological changes have been observed in mice bearing CRC when infected with helminths or treated with helminth-derived products, the exact mechanisms impacting CRC outcomes are not yet fully understood. One of the most studied mechanisms is immune modulation. Evidence suggests that in inflammation-associated cancer models, the balance between immunosuppression and exacerbation of inflammation mediated by helminths is a key factor in tumor progression during the early stages of the disease. Specifically, helminths that exacerbate inflammation may promote tumor formation, while those that suppress immune responses may inhibit it. Conversely, in hereditary CRC models, immunosuppression induced by helminths could promote tumorigenesis. This highlights the importance of considering both the origin and stage of the tumor in evaluating the effects of helminths on CRC. Given that helminth therapy using whole parasites is impractical and could compromise patient health, recent research has focused on helminth-derived products as a more viable therapeutic approach. The extraction of helminth-derived products has enabled the study of new mechanisms by which these organisms may impact CRC. Like active helminth infections, the investigation of ES helminth products as immune modulators has been extensively studied. Antitumor effects of these products have been linked to both the stimulation and the suppression of immune responses. Evidence indicates that the immune stimulatory effects of helminth-derived products may occur through cross-reactivity between helminth and cancer antigens. Conversely, ES helminth products may downregulate key inflammatory transcription factors that favor CRC. Recent studies have also demonstrated that, in addition to immunomodulatory mechanisms, helminth-derived products could interact directly with CRC cells. In this context, ES helminth products have shown the potential to either promote or inhibit cell proliferation and cell death. Tumor-promoting effects are associated with the activation of proto-oncogenes and the inhibition of anti-apoptotic proteins, while antitumor effects are linked to the upregulation of tumor suppressor proteins ( Figure 4 One of the main challenges in utilizing ES helminth products as potential biotherapeutics lies in the complexity of their composition. As a complex mixture of biomolecules, studying their interaction with tumor cells can be difficult. Further characterization and identification of the components of ES helminth products will allow researchers to investigate their interaction with specific receptors in immune, tumor, and epithelial cells, aiding in the development of potential biotherapeutic agents. Nevertheless, we must consider potential adverse effects, such as immunosuppression or the induction of PDL-1 and PD-L2 expression, that may compromise the use of immunotherapy aimed at blocking immunologic checkpoints. Research on helminth-derived products as a potential treatment for CRC is currently limited to basic science studies and preclinical trials conducted in animal models and in vitro cultures using human colorectal tumor cells. While these models provide valuable insights, they only capture a small fraction of the complex mechanisms involved in the development of CRC. It is important to note that accurately reproducing the development and progression of CRC is challenging due to the multifactorial nature of the disease. CRC is a heterogeneous condition, meaning there are numerous differences among patients’ tumors, and even variations in tumors from the same patient. Thus, there is no ideal in vitro or preclinical model for any human disease. However, numerous efforts are underway to develop preclinical models that closely resemble human diseases. Several models attempt to replicate human disease in colorectal cancer as closely as possible. The models described in this review are limited and involve chemical inducers, injecting syngeneic heterotopic tumor cells, single-gene mutations, and the induction of inflammation. They all have limitations in several aspects, such as the development of a limited number of mutations, restricted tumor heterogeneity, and poor metastasis development. However, these preclinical models have generated valuable information for understanding the development of CRC in humans, particularly in terms of the role of innate and adaptive immune response, chronic inflammation, and insights into the tumor microenvironment. There are more preclinical models of CRC. However, with the advent of genetically modified animals, it has become possible to develop models with up to four CRC-related mutations in the same animal, thereby generating a model that more closely resembles the classification of the four consensus molecular subtypes described in human CRC. Furthermore, organoids or tumor cells from patients have been grafted into immunodeficient mice to investigate more effective treatments for the patients, thereby providing precision medicine, which aims to develop therapeutic strategies tailored to the specific characteristics of tumors. However, these aforementioned models have not yet been addressed from the perspective of treatment with helminth-derived molecules. Thus, this is a point that researchers in this field should develop soon to solidify the potential beneficial effects of using helminth ES products. Finally, as mentioned before, the use of helminth infection is not an option, given the potential harmful for the patients; we propose instead the use of helminth-derived products, not to displace the conventional drugs in CRC (even when their efficacy is low) but the combination of such products with standard drugs to improve their efficacy and reduce the drug doses to decrease the severe side effects in patients. Understanding how these products impact CRC is vital for advancing translational research that can identify new therapeutic targets.

Figure 2 Physiological changes associated with the protumor effects of helminths. Specific helminth infections contribute to tissue damage and adverse clinical outcomes in CRC. These infections trigger physiological changes in their hosts, including alterations in immune response and antioxidant mechanisms. The protein SjE16.7, which is derived from S. japonicum Figure 3 Physiological changes are associated with the antitumor effects of helminths. Infection with T. crassiceps Ancylostoma caninum Figure 4 Helminths regulate cell signaling pathways in tumor cells. Pro-tumorigenic effects of helminths involve the activation of transcription factors associated with cell proliferation and the inhibition of pro-apoptotic proteins. In contrast, anti-tumorigenic effects of helminths inhibit the activation of transcription factors related to cell proliferation, downregulate anti-apoptotic proteins, and upregulate pro-apoptotic proteins. pathogens-14-00949-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Effects of helminths and their products on different models of CRC.
