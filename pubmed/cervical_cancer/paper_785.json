Therefore, this large-scale population-based retrospective study in Seoul, South Korea, aimed to estimate the cumulative incidences and subsequent risks of overall cancers 1 year after COVID-19 vaccination. Data from 8,407,849 individuals between 2021 and 2023 were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance database. The participants were categorized into two groups based on their COVID-19 vaccination status. The risks for overall cancer were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, and data were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The HRs of thyroid (HR, 1.351; 95% CI, 1.206–1.514), gastric (HR, 1.335; 95% CI, 1.130–1.576), colorectal (HR, 1.283; 95% CI, 1.122–1.468), lung (HR, 1.533; 95% CI, 1.254–1.874), breast (HR, 1.197; 95% CI, 1.069–1.340), and prostate (HR, 1.687; 95% CI, 1.348–2.111) cancers significantly increased at 1 year post-vaccination. In terms of vaccine type, cDNA vaccines were associated with the increased risks of thyroid, gastric, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers; mRNA vaccines were linked to the increased risks of thyroid, colorectal, lung, and breast cancers; and heterologous vaccination was related to the increased risks of thyroid and breast cancers. Given the observed associations between COVID-19 vaccination and cancer incidence by age, sex, and vaccine type, further research is needed to determine whether specific vaccination strategies may be optimal for populations in need of COVID-19 vaccination.

It is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is linked to high morbidity and mortality among the elderly [ 1 2 3 6 Similar to other viruses, such as human papillomavirus and Epstein–Barr virus, SARS-CoV-2 shows an oncogenic potential, which has been hypothetically proposed based on its mechanisms of action, including the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, viral mutagenicity, and inflammatory cascade [ 7 8 1 Our data showed associations between COVID-19 vaccination and an increased the risk of six cancer types, namely, thyroid (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21–1.51), gastric (HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13–1.58), colorectal (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.12–1.47), lung (HR, 1.533; 95% CI, 1.25–1.87), breast (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.07–1.34), and prostate (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.35–2.11) cancers (Fig. 1 2 3 1  Fig. 1 Risks of cancers associated with COVID-19 vaccines.

HR, hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval Given the limited availability of real-world data, our population-based cohort study in Seoul, South Korea suggested epidemiological associations between the cumulative incidence of cancers and COVID-19 vaccination, which varied by sex, age, and vaccine type. However, further studies are warranted to elucidate potential causal relationships, including the underlying molecular mechanisms related to COVID-19 vaccine–induced hyperinflammation. The concept of a booster dose involves re-exposure to the immunizing antigen to enhance immunity [ 9 9 10 In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccination could be associated with an increased risk of six specific cancer types, including thyroid, gastric, colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers. Notably, this COVID-19 vaccination-associated cancer risk was likely more elevated among individuals aged ≤ 65 years except in individuals with prostate cancer. Given the observed associations between COVID-19 vaccination and cancer incidence by age, sex, and vaccine type, further research is needed to determine whether specific vaccination strategies may be optimal for populations in need of COVID-19 vaccination.
