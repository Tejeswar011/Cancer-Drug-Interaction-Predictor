The extracellular matrix (ECM) serves as a dynamic biomechanical regulator of cellular behavior, yet conventional 3D culture systems, such as Matrigel, lack the spatiotemporal control required to dissect mechanotransductive mechanisms in organoids. This review systematically explores the synthesis of mechanically tunable hydrogels—spanning stiffness and viscoelasticity—and their transformative applications in organoid research. By integrating natural, synthetic, and hybrid polymers, these hydrogels enable precise recapitulation of tissue-specific ECM mechanics, overcoming limitations of batch variability and static properties. We categorize hydrogel design strategies, emphasizing crosslinking paradigms (physical vs. chemical) and dynamic bond engineering, which permit real-time modulation of mechanical cues. Applications across developmental organoids (intestinal, hepatic, renal, neural) reveal stiffness-dependent morphogenesis, where optimal mechanical niches enhance maturation via YAP/Notch signaling. Tumor organoid models (breast, pancreatic, colorectal) further demonstrate how matrix stiffening drives malignancy through mechanosensitive pathways, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and drug resistance. Emerging viscoelastic hydrogels, tailored via alginate molecular weight or decellularized ECM, replicate dynamic tissue mechanics, advancing cartilage and cerebellar organoid models.

Mechanical confinement orchestrates cell volume, shape, and force generation via actomyosin contractility and protrusive activity [ 1 [2] [3] [4] 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 in vitro [13] [14] [15] Patient-derived organoids uniquely retain individual genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, positioning them as unparalleled tools for personalized medicine, enabling patient-specific drug screening, therapeutic response prediction, and modeling of complex pathologies [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 This review synthesizes advances in mechanically controlled hydrogels for organoid engineering, establishing a novel framework for biomaterial design. We first categorize hydrogel systems by composition (natural/synthetic/hybrid) and crosslinking paradigms, focusing on molecular strategies enabling precision control of stiffness and viscoelasticity. Next, we detail applications across developmental organoids (intestinal, hepatic, renal, neural, auditory), demonstrating how tissue-specific mechanical mimicry enhances maturation and functionality. Tumor organoid platforms (breast, pancreatic, colorectal) further reveal how engineered matrix mechanics regulate malignancy phenotypes, including stromal crosstalk and therapy resistance. Emerging viscoelastic hydrogels for dynamic niches (e.g., cartilage, cerebellar organoids) are critically evaluated. By integrating mechanistic insights across organ systems and pathologies, this work provides a roadmap for next-generation hydrogels to accelerate translational applications—from patient-specific therapy testing to regenerative medicine—while addressing persistent challenges in vascularization and matrix-cell feedback loops. 2 ECM hierarchies govern tissue mechanics ECM components critically regulate tissue mechanics and cellular behavior through spatially distinct mechanisms. Basement membranes orchestrate cellular functions via ligand-receptor signaling, while the interstitial ECM establishes a three-dimensional scaffold that facilitates mechanochemical crosstalk through integrins, discoidin domain receptors, and other adhesion molecules [ 22 23 2.1 The structure and biomechanics of extracellular matrix The human body exhibits an extraordinary elastic modulus gradient across tissues, spanning ∼11 Pa (intestinal mucus) to ∼20 GPa (cortical bone), reflecting functional specialization essential for tissue integrity and performance [ 23 Fig. 1 22 Fig. 2 22 24 Fig. 1 Mechanical moduli of human tissues. Fig. 1 23 Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Variability in the structure of extracellular matrix components. (A) (B) Fig. 2 Decoding ECM mechanics is imperative for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, as these properties govern developmental morphogenesis, pathophysiological trajectories, and repair outcomes [ 25 2.2 Engineered hydrogel microenvironments for organoid Hydrogels, three-dimensional hydrophilic polymer networks capable of retaining substantial water, have emerged as indispensable platforms for organoid engineering by recapitulating key physicochemical and biological features of native ECM [ 26 27 28 2.2.1 Grasping the distinctions between stiffness and viscoelasticity Stiffness and viscoelasticity, key mechanical properties governing cellular behavior, have become central to advancing organoid culture systems [ 1 23 21 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 The distinctions between stiffness and viscoelasticity. (A) ε 0 (B) ε Fig. 3 It is necessary to distinguish the principles and mechanisms governing the regulation of stiffness and viscoelasticity in hydrogels. Classical theories posit that stiffness regulation primarily governs the equilibrium elastic modulus through control of covalent crosslinking density. This involves adjusting the concentration of chemical crosslinkers, polymer chain length, or solid content to establish a permanent network topology [ 20 29 21 30 2.2.2 Design of natural and synthetic polymer networks Hydrogel networks are strategically engineered from natural, synthetic, or hybrid polymers to construct biomimetic microenvironments for organoid cultivation. ECM-derived natural hydrogels (e.g., decellularized brain, kidney, and cervical matrices) leverage tissue-specific biochemical cues to drive organoid morphogenesis while preserving pathological signatures, as evidenced by their success in modeling neural circuitry development [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 To overcome these limitations, recent studies have developed synthetic hydrogels to enhance functional performance. Unlike natural hydrogels, synthetic hydrogels enable scalable production and precise molecular control through customizable polymerization [ 37 38 20 [39] [40] [41] 39 Contemporary hybrid hydrogel systems transcend the biocompatibility-mechanical performance trade-off through rational integration of natural and synthetic components. Photocrosslinkable methacrylated gelatin (GelMA), synthesized via controlled methacrylation in phosphate buffer, exemplifies this paradigm by coupling enzymatic degradability with tunable stiffness to guide intestinal crypt-villus self-organization [ 42 43 44 2.2.3 Dynamic reversible vs. stable covalent crosslinking Hydrogel crosslinking strategies are broadly categorized into physical interactions and chemical linkages, both critical for providing dynamic mechanical support in organoid culture [ 38 39 42 43 45 46 2+ 47 In contrast, chemically crosslinked hydrogels form largely irreversible covalent bonds via free radical polymerization or functional group reactions, ensuring long-term stability [ 48 49 50 2.3 Molecular mechanisms of hydrogel-driven mechanotransduction Cells perceive hydrogel mechanical cues through membrane-bound mechanosensors that convert biophysical signals into biochemical responses. Integrins serve as primary sensors, binding hydrogel-immobilized ligands (e.g., RGD peptides) and transmitting forces via focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to activate downstream pathways [ 1 4 21 22 24 22 2+ 51 Hydrogel mechanics regulate organoid development through conserved mechanotransduction pathways. YAP, a canonical mechanoresponsive effector, dynamically responds to matrix stiffness: Soft hydrogels promote cytoplasmic YAP retention and renal differentiation [ 52 [53] [54] [55] 56 2+ 51 57 58 59 55 60 Mechanotransduction pathways exhibit significant divergence across tissue types and pathologies. In developmental organoids, soft hydrogels optimize physiological YAP/Notch signaling for intestinal crypt folding and hepatic maturation [ 56 61 53 62 63 64 65 60 66 Collectively, these findings establish extracellular matrix mechanics as a master regulator of organoid development, where substrate stiffness orchestrates stem cell fate decisions, tissue morphogenesis, and therapeutic responses through evolutionarily conserved mechanotransduction hubs—including YAP, integrin-FAK, Wnt, Notch, and JNK/NF-κB pathways—across diverse tissue types and physiological contexts. Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Mechanical signaling pathways modulating organoid function. Fig. 4 3 Mechanically controlled hydrogel synthesis for organoid cultivation Matrigel exhibits intrinsically unstable mechanical properties, demonstrating pronounced concentration- and temperature-dependent stiffness variability. Atomic force microscopy using a micron-scale spherical indenter quantified the elastic modulus (E) of standard Matrigel at 443 Pa. Complementary rheological analysis revealed that its shear storage modulus (G′) increases from 9 Pa to 288 Pa across concentrations spanning 3–19.1 mg/mL. Critically, these values fall substantially below the physiological stiffness range of human tissues, rendering Matrigel biomechanically inadequate for recapitulating native ECM microenvironments in organoid systems. This fundamental limitation underscores the cardinal advantage of synthetic hydrogels: their programmable mechanical properties enable precise spatiotemporal emulation of dynamic ECM mechanics essential for physiologically relevant organoid development [ 20 3.1 Synthesis of hydrogels with adjustable stiffness Hydrogels are broadly classified into conventional systems (fixed mechanical properties) and mechanically tunable systems, with the latter offering adjustable stiffness through strategies such as polymer concentration modulation, crosslinking density control, and dynamic bond engineering. For instance, increasing substrate concentration or crosslinker ratio elevates hydrogel stiffness by enhancing polymer network density, while reversible physical interactions allow dynamic mechanical adaptation. These tunable systems are particularly valuable in organoid research, where substrate stiffness directly regulates cellular processes like differentiation, migration, and tissue morphogenesis. This section systematically examines stiffness-tuning methodologies, emphasizing their role in replicating tissue-specific micromechanical environments for advanced organoid models. Key hydrogel fabrication approaches, including PEG, PAA, GelMA, and alginate systems, are summarized in Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Methods to synthesize mechanically controlled hydrogels. Fig. 5 3.1.1 Polyethylene glycol hydrogels for organoid culture PEG-based hydrogels are widely employed in biomedical and tissue engineering due to their tunable mechanical properties, which enable precise emulation of tissue-specific stiffness. This adaptability allows PEG hydrogels to serve diverse applications, from soft tissue engineering to cartilage repair. Funfak et al. demonstrated that PEG hydrogels act as synthetic scaffolds for cholangiocytes, facilitating the formation of polarized cysts. By varying PEG concentrations, they generated hydrogels with distinct shear storage modulus: soft (G' = 0.5 kPa), intermediate (G' = 3 kPa), and stiff (G'>5.5 kPa) [ 67 38 53 3.1.2 Polyacrylic acid hydrogels for organoid culture PAA hydrogels, characterized by high water retention and structural stability, are utilized across biomedicine, environmental engineering, and industrial processes. Their stiffness is precisely adjustable through variations in acrylamide and bis-acrylamide concentrations. Yeung et al. fabricated PAA hydrogels spanning a shear storage modulus range from 2 Pa (3 % acrylamide/0.05 % bis-acrylamide) to 55 kPa (12 % acrylamide/0.60 % bis-acrylamide), providing a versatile substrate for studying mechanoresponses in fibroblasts, bovine aortic endothelial cells, and human neutrophils [ 39 52 3.1.3 Gelatin hydrogels for organoid culture Gelatin hydrogels, derived from collagen hydrolysis, exhibit exceptional biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ECM-like properties, making them prominent in tissue engineering [ 68 69 70 3.1.4 Collagen hydrogels for organoid culture Collagen hydrogels, derived from the primary structural protein of human ECM, are extensively used in regenerative medicine for their biocompatibility and tissue-mimetic microenvironments [ 71 72 43 43 3.2 Synthesis of hydrogels with adjustable viscoelasticity Viscoelasticity is a critical mechanical property of hydrogels for organoid research. While previous studies have predominantly focused on hydrogels with variable elasticity, the development of systems with tunable viscoelasticity remains underexplored in organoid applications. Current strategies to achieve adjustable viscoelasticity include modulating alginate molecular weight and utilizing naturally derived hydrogels [ 66 73 3.2.1 Alginate hydrogels for organoid culture Alginate, a polysaccharide derived from alginic acid, forms pliable hydrogels with tunable viscoelasticity, making it a versatile material for 3D cell culture [ 73 74 66 73 3.2.2 Tissue-derived hydrogels for organoid culture Tissue-derived hydrogels for organoid culture are matrices sourced from natural tissues, such as decellularized ECM. These hydrogels offer a biomimetic environment that closely mimics the native tissue microenvironment, providing critical biochemical and biomechanical cues necessary for cell growth and differentiation. Various naturally derived hydrogels have been developed from different organs or tissues, including the heart [ 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 3.3 Organ-specific mechanical properties guiding hydrogel design The selection and engineering of hydrogels for organoid development must align with the native mechanical niche of target organs. For instance, soft elastic modulus hydrogels (E = 0.1–1 kPa) optimally support morphogenesis in neural organoids by mimicking brain elasticity, enhancing neurite extension and synaptic maturation [ 63 83 57 84 66 85 Hydrogel platforms must distinguish between dynamically loaded organs (e.g., heart, lung, vasculature) and structurally stable organs (e.g., liver, bone) to emulate physiological force regimes. For dynamically active tissues, viscoelastic hydrogels with tunable stress relaxation (e.g., alginate modulated systems) are indispensable. These enable energy dissipation during cyclic loading [ 86 58 87 53 88 89 Collectively, numerous papers have been published exploring the application of stiffness/viscoelasticity-adjustable hydrogels in organoids, and key hydrogel fabrication approaches—including PEG, alginate, GelMA, collagen, and liver derived systems—are summarized in Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Synthesis of hydrogels with adjustable stiffness and viscoelasticity. (A) 53 (B) 73 (C) 68 (D) 43 (E) 81 Fig. 6 4 Application of stiffness-adjustable hydrogels for organoid cultivation For decades, Matrigel has remained the benchmark scaffold for organoid culture by recapitulating key ECM characteristics [ 90 18 91 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Application of mechanically controlled hydrogels in development and tumor organoids. Fig. 7 4.1 Stiffness preference in organs Organs with diverse functionalities exhibit critical shared characteristics in stiffness regulation preferences. These characteristics reflect inherent tissue architectures and cellular functions that confer high sensitivity to matrix stiffness modulation. Highly mechanosensitive organs demonstrate stiffness-dependent processes; brain organoids exhibit substrate stiffness-regulated morphogenesis, neurite outgrowth, synaptogenesis, and neural stem cell differentiation [ 92 56 61 84 Conserved mechanotransduction pathway dependencies govern cellular functions across organ systems; YAP/Notch signaling mediates intestinal cryptogenesis while integrin-FAK axis regulates skin fibrogenesis, demonstrating evolutionary conservation of stiffness-responsive pathways [ 54 93 94 95 11 62 4.2 Application of stiffness-adjustable hydrogels for development organoids Developmental organoid morphogenesis, differentiation, and maturation are governed by organ-specific stiffness windows [ 96 Table 1 Table 1 Application of stiffness-adjustable hydrogels for development organoids.

(A) 5+ 55 (B) 52 (C) 56 (D) 105 (E) 57 (F) 51 Fig. 8 These findings underscore the mechanosensitive nature of organoid development, with key signaling pathways such as YAP and Notch playing critical roles in both colony formation and crypt maintenance [ 54 98 4.2.2 Kidney organoid Hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties can mimic the ECM by providing both structural support and biological cues that influence cellular behavior during pluripotent stem cell differentiation, particularly in kidney organoid development [ 3 52 Fig. 8 99 Contrastingly, Treacy et al. observed that self-assembled peptide hydrogels with stiffer shear storage modulus (G’ = 12–20 kPa) increased nephron cell types, particularly mature podocytes [ 100 84 101 4.2.3 Liver organoid Hydrogels have emerged as a superior alternative to Matrigel for liver organoid development, offering enhanced reproducibility and translational potential for liver regeneration therapies. Recent studies demonstrate that hydrogel-encapsulated cholangiocyte organoids can effectively regenerate hepatocytes, restore hepatic function, and ameliorate liver injury through paracrine signaling and cell replacement mechanisms [ 102 56 Fig. 8 56 103 87 These collective findings establish a stiffness “sweet spot” for liver organoid development—approximately 1∼2 kPa—that optimally balances structural support with mechanical compliance. Mechanistically, this regime engages integrin-SFK-YAP signaling cascades, where physiological stiffness stabilizes YAP nuclear translocation to drive hepatocyte differentiation while suppressing apoptosis. Deviations from this range disrupt force-sensitive feedback loops, compromising organoid maturation. Thus, recapitulating native liver mechanics through tunable hydrogels represents a critical advance toward scalable, functional liver models for transplantation and disease modeling. 4.2.4 Brain organoid Previous studies have established the crucial involvement of mechanical forces in neurulation, yet the precise mechanisms through which neural tissues integrate these mechanical cues to coordinate fate specification, patterning, growth, and morphogenesis remain poorly understood [ 104 105 Fig. 8 63 Building on this mechanical perspective, Tang et al. developed an innovative approach using volumetric compression through a soft alginate shell (0.1 % w/v) encapsulating a Matrigel core. This configuration maintained unrestricted growth while simultaneously enhancing neuronal maturation in cerebral organoids [ 106 83 4.2.5 Cardiovascular organoid Recent advances in cardiovascular organoid research have revealed substantial progress in modeling cardiac microenvironments through bioengineered materials. Hydrogels and decellularized extracellular matrices now enable the recapitulation of tissue-specific mechanical properties, driving spatially organized cellular alignment and functional maturation. In a breakthrough study, Shkumatov et al. established that collagen-conjugated polyacrylamide hydrogels mimicking cardiac muscle elastic modulus (E = 6 kPa) significantly enhanced vascularized cardiac muscle sheet formation from embryoid bodies, while simultaneously promoting cardiomyogenic differentiation and endothelial specialization in contracting cardiovascular organoids [ 57 Fig. 8 58 107 These collective findings underscore the dual regulatory role of hydrogel mechanics in cardiovascular organoid development. Optimal stiffness ranges not only promote tissue-specific cellular behaviors such as cardiomyocyte maturation and endothelial patterning but also suppress pathological responses when mechanical parameters deviate from physiological norms. The studies collectively establish hydrogel stiffness as a critical design variable for balancing structural organization, functional output, and vascular integration in engineered cardiac models. 4.2.6 Cochlear organoid Recent advances in cochlear organoid research have underscored the critical role of mechanical forces and ECM properties in guiding inner ear development. Xia et al. systematically investigated mechanobiological regulation in sensory epithelium formation using tunable GelMA hydrogels. Their work demonstrated that moderate shear storage modulus (G’ = 1.5 kPa) enhanced cochlear progenitor cell-derived organoid expansion through ITGA3/F-actin/YAP mechanotransduction, while higher stiffness (G’ = 5 kPa) redirected cochlear progenitor cell fate toward sensory hair cell differentiation via PIEZO2-mediated Ca 2+ 51 Fig. 8 3 2 x 108 4.2.7 Immune organoid Stiffness-tuned synthetic hydrogels now reveal a mechanical hierarchy in B cell programming enabling precision models for lymphoma therapy. Zhong et al. pioneered this exploration by developing synthetic PEG-4MAL hydrogels (G’ = 500 Pa stiffness) to model lymphoid tissue microenvironments. Their platform supported robust germinal center formation and plasma cell differentiation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in both healthy donors and lymphoma patients, with optimized bioadhesive properties enhancing B cell survival and lineage specification—a breakthrough for modeling immune responses and malignancies [ 109 110 111 112 Collectively, these studies delineate a stiffness-dependent paradigm in B cell programming: softer matrices favor memory cell induction, intermediate stiffness promotes GC maintenance, and stiffer environments enhance terminal differentiation. This mechanical hierarchy, coupled with biochemical customization, positions tunable hydrogels as transformative platforms for both dissecting immune mechanisms and engineering B cell therapies. The findings underscore hydrogel stiffness as a tunable rheostat for guiding fate decisions across the B cell lineage. 4.2.8 Endometrial organoids The endometrium is pivotal for reproduction, providing the essential environment for embryo implantation and development. Human endometrial organoids have emerged as a powerful model for investigating endometrial physiology. Gómez-Álvarez et al. developed a hybrid hydrogel derived from endometrial tissue, integrating the rigidity of PuraMatrix with natural scaffold components and the bioactive interactions of a porcine decellularized endometrial extracellular matrix hydrogel. This biomaterial effectively mimics the mechanical properties of the native endometrium, offering excellent support for cultivating human endometrial organoids and enhancing their differentiation efficiency, demonstrating significant potential for regenerative therapies in reproductive medicine [ 113 114 These advances in hydrogel design underscore the potential of engineered biomaterials to advance reproductive medicine. By recapitulating the mechanical and biological properties of the natural endometrium, these hydrogels provide a more physiologically relevant microenvironment for cultivating human endometrial organoids. This approach not only improves organoid differentiation efficiency but also facilitates the development of novel regenerative therapies for infertility and other reproductive disorders. Continued optimization of hydrogel composition and mechanical properties will further enhance the reproducibility and functionality of these models, offering deeper insights into endometrial physiology and enabling more effective treatments for reproductive health. 4.2.9 Mammary epithelial organoid Three-dimensional organoid models serve as indispensable tools for investigating molecular mechanisms in cellular processes and disease modeling, though conventional biomaterials such as Matrigel face limitations in biochemical complexity and batch reproducibility. To address this, Lingard et al. systematically evaluated self-assembling peptide hydrogels as tunable alternatives for 3D mammary epithelial cell culture [ 115 4.3 Application of stiffness-adjustable hydrogels for tumor organoids Biomimetic hydrogel platforms reveal organ-specific mechanical windows that drive tumor invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and drug resistance through conserved mechanotransduction pathway [ [116] [117] [118] 119 Table 2 Table 2 Application of stiffness-adjustable hydrogels for tumor organoids.

Vahala et al. developed gradient-elastic modulus GelAGE hydrogels (E = 1.5–24.8 kPa) using photomasks with varying transparency (20–100 %). MCF-7 cell growth analysis revealed stiffness-dependent behavior - softer matrices promoted volumetric spheroid expansion, while stiffer environments suppressed growth. This mechanical regulation correlated with progressive downregulation of mechanosensitive proteins (TRPV4, β-integrin, E-cadherin, F-actin) as stiffness increased [ 120 Fig. 9 121 122 123 Fig. 9 Application of stiffness-adjustable hydrogels for tumor organoids. (A) 120 (B) 53 (C) 130 (D) 133 (E) 134 Fig. 9 4.3.2 Pancreatic cancer organoid Pancreatic cancer, a highly lethal malignancy originating from pancreatic ductal epithelium and acinar cells, exhibits a dismal five-year survival rate of ∼9 %, underscoring the urgent need for improved therapeutic strategies [ 124 125 53 Fig. 9 Notably, elevated stiffness in PEG-CBF-0.5 and GelNB-HPA hydrogels induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition, characterized by upregulated N-cadherin and vimentin expression, activation of Sonic hedgehog signaling, nuclear translocation of YAP, and enhanced proliferative capacity [ 53 126 in vitro 4.3.3 Colorectal cancer organoid Patient-derived cellular and tissue models have emerged as pivotal tools in cancer biology research, enabling precise investigation of tumor heterogeneity and microenvironmental interactions [ [127] [128] [129] in vitro 11 The foundational study by Ng et al. pioneered the use of patient-derived xenograft cells in 3D colorectal cancer modeling [ 130 130 Fig. 9 131 Synthetic hydrogels now demonstrate multifaceted potential for colorectal cancer research through mechanical tunability, microenvironmental control, and clinical translation. These innovations are poised to transform drug screening pipelines and personalized treatment strategies by bridging the gap between in vitro 132 4.3.4 Esophageal adenocarcinoma organoid Esophageal adenocarcinoma has experienced a marked increase in incidence, where elevated ECM stiffness is closely associated with metastatic progression and therapeutic resistance. To address this mechanistic link, Anil K. Rustgi, Ricardo Cruz-Acuña, and colleagues developed a modular hydrogel platform that replicates the tumor ECM for culturing esophageal adenocarcinoma organoids [ 133 Fig. 9 4.3.5 Liver cancer organoid Liver cancer remains a significant global health concern, ranking among the most common and lethal malignancies. Addressing this challenge, Zhao et al. developed a chemically defined, mechanically tunable, and bioactive double-network hydrogel for the construction of liver cancer organoids [ 134 Fig. 9 in vitro in vivo 113 4.3.6 Prostate cancer organoid In prostate cancer research, particularly when investigating the transition from castration-resistant adenocarcinoma to neuroendocrine prostate cancer, understanding ECM regulation is critical. To address this, Matthew J. Mosquera and colleagues developed a synthetic hydrogel platform using four-armed PEG functionalized with maleimide end-groups. The hydrogel was engineered with bioactive peptides—RGD, GFOGER, and REDV—to mimic tumor microenvironment adhesion motifs [ 135 4.3.7 Salivary carcinoma organoid In studying the tumorigenesis of salivary gland malignancies, particularly carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma that arises from pleomorphic adenoma, Chen et al. investigated the role of ECM stiffness. The researchers utilized a GM90 hydrogel kit to synthesize hydrogels with adjustable mechanical properties, modulating elastic modulus to two distinct levels by controlling UV light exposure duration. When primary pleomorphic adenoma cells and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma cell lines were cultured in these hydrogels, cells exhibited enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasiveness in the stiffer shear storage modulus (G’ = 50 kPa) compared to softer environments (G’ = 5 kPa) [ 136 In conclusion, hydrogels with tunable stiffness have emerged as a versatile platform for developing both aging and tumor organoid models. However, current research on ECM mechanical effects remains constrained by limited organoid diversity—key models such as heart, lung, and osteosarcoma-derived organoids are notably absent, restricting comprehensive analysis of stiffness-dependent behaviors. Despite these limitations, the adaptability of tunable hydrogels holds promise for expanding into underrepresented organoid systems in future studies. Furthermore, while optimal stiffness ranges for organoid growth have been identified, the molecular mechanisms underlying stiffness-mediated regulation remain poorly defined. Addressing this knowledge gap will require systematic investigations using organoids cultured across graded stiffness conditions, building on methodologies established in prior work. 5 Application of viscoelasticity-adjustable hydrogels for organoid cultivation Viscoelasticity—a time-dependent mechanical behavior characterized by irreversible deformation under sustained force—has been shown to critically regulate biological processes such as cell migration, differentiation, and transcriptional activity [ 137 138 139 140 Table 3 Table 3 Application of viscoelasticity-adjustable hydrogels for organoid cultivation.

Beyond stiffness-sensitive organs, viscoelastic characteristics prove especially critical in these organoid models: Cartilage represents a quintessential viscoelastic material where load-bearing and shock-absorption functions fundamentally depend on stress relaxation capabilities generated through synergistic interactions between proteoglycans and collagen networks [ 141 142 143 144 Organs highly dependent on viscoelasticity exhibit three unifying features. First, they undergo cyclic or dynamic mechanical loading during daily physiological activities, enduring repetitive pressure, tension, shear, or impact forces (e.g., articular movement, cardiac contraction, respiration, hemodynamics) [ 145 146 147 These viscoelasticity-sensitive organs exhibit significant similarities in dynamic mechanical requirements during pathological progression. Fibrotic transformation consistently alters viscoelastic properties: Dense fibrotic ECM networks typically demonstrate slowed stress relaxation, prolonging cellular exposure to sustained mechanical stress and exacerbating aberrant mechanosignaling. Concomitantly, reduced energy dissipation capacity compromises tissue resilience under dynamic loading (e.g., diminished diastolic compliance in stiffened cardiac tissue) [ 148 5.2 Application of viscoelasticity-adjustable hydrogels for organoids 5.2.1 Intestinal organoid Recent advances in viscoelastic hydrogel design have significantly advanced intestinal organoid research. Christandy et al. developed a hybrid PEG-based hydrogel featuring dynamic rearrangement through reversible hydrogen bonds, demonstrating that its stress relaxation properties enhance crypt budding in intestinal stem cell epithelia by promoting symmetry disruption and Paneth cell differentiation [ 88 Fig. 10 149 150 151 Fig. 10 Application of viscoelasticity-adjustable hydrogels for organoid culture. (A) 88 (B) 152 (C) 65 (D) 66 (E) 157 (F) 86 Fig. 10 5.2.2 Trophoblast organoid Trophoblast organoids, three-dimensional structures derived from trophoblast cells, are critical for studying placental development and early human pregnancy. To replicate the dynamic and intricate in vivo 152 Fig. 10 5.2.3 Kidney organoid Kidney organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells hold significant promise for advancing kidney research and regenerative medicine, though optimizing their mechanical microenvironment remains a critical challenge. To address this, Bryan A. Nerger and colleagues investigated the role of hydrogel viscoelasticity in kidney organoid development by encapsulating the organoids in alginate hydrogels with tailored viscoelastic properties. These hydrogels spanned a shear storage modulus range from soft to stiff and incorporated variations in stress relaxation rates to mimic the dynamic extracellular matrix of the developing kidney. Organoids cultured in hydrogels with viscoelasticity resembling embryonic kidney mechanics exhibited enhanced nephrogenesis, characterized by more complex tubular structures and increased branching compared to those grown in suspension or mechanically mismatched hydrogels [ 65 Fig. 10 5.2.4 Cerebellar organoid Prior to 2020, cerebellar organoids had not been extensively utilized for modeling human medulloblastoma, and their in vivo 153 154 in vitro 5.2.5 Spinal cord organoid The spinal cord, a critical component of the central nervous system, facilitates neural signal transmission between the brain and peripheral systems [ 155 156 64 5.2.6 Cartilage organoid Viscoelasticity, an inherent mechanical property of natural tissues, has garnered significant attention in cartilage tissue engineering due to its critical role in scaffold design [ 137 66 Fig. 10 85 5.2.7 Liver organoid Liver diseases represent a major cause of pediatric and adult liver transplantation, driving the development of advanced organoid models for therapeutic applications. To address this need, Muhammad Rizwan and colleagues engineered defined viscoelastic hyaluronic acid hydrogels by crosslinking hyaluronic acid with either non-cleavable polyethylene glycol-tetraoxyamine or matrix metalloproteinase -degradable peptides, creating a mechanically tunable platform for primary cholangiocyte culture. By adjusting laminin content, the hydrogels achieved stress relaxation rates mimicking native liver mechanics, yielding two distinct viscoelastic profiles: fast-relaxing and slow-relaxing hydrogels. Fast-relaxing hydrogels significantly enhanced cholangiocyte organoid growth and bile duct-like morphogenesis through activation of YAP and Notch signaling pathways. This work underscores the synergistic role of viscoelasticity and Notch signaling in cholangiocyte organogenesis, advancing platforms for liver disease modeling and regenerative therapies [ 157 Fig. 10 CYP3A4 CYP3A7 TAT 81 5.2.8 Vessel organoid Recent advances in vascular organoid research underscore the critical influence of ECM viscoelasticity on vascular network formation and maturation. Sun et al. investigated how matrix stiffness and dynamics regulate the differentiation of vascular organoids—3D human pluripotent stem cell-derived structures that self-organize into functional vascular networks—providing insights into vascular development and regenerative applications. The researchers engineered two hydrogel systems: a dynamic hydrogel and a non-dynamic hydrogel. The dynamic hydrogel was synthesized via host-guest interactions between gelatin and acryloylated β-cyclodextrin, forming a tunable dynamic network. Photopolymerization with a photoinitiator enabled precise control over viscoelastic properties, endowing the dynamic hydrogel with rapid stress relaxation, shear-thinning behavior, and injectability. In contrast, the non-dynamic hydrogel, fabricated from methacryloylated gelatin, lacked these dynamic features [ 86 Fig. 10 PDGF-B 5.3 Divergent hydrogel selection criteria in development and tumor organoids Compared to stiffness-controllable hydrogels, which have been successfully applied in diverse tumor organoid models (e.g., breast cancer organoids [ 122 53 130 The distinct hydrogel selection criteria primarily arise from differing mechanical property requirements. Developmental organoids rely on physiological stiffness ranges and high stress-relaxation capacity to facilitate stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. For instance: intestinal crypt formation necessitates soft matrices to optimize folding dynamics, while colony expansion requires intermediate stiffness [ 61 97 63 152 53 130 60 Building on these distinct mechanical requirements for developmental versus tumor organoids, significant implications emerge for future hydrogel design strategies. Developmental organoids should emphasize mimicking dynamic physiological adaptability (e.g., tunable mechanical properties, rapid stress relaxation). Tumor organoids, however, necessitate immobilizing aberrant mechanical feedback loops (e.g., stiffness-mediated persistent YAP activation). This dichotomy dictates divergent hydrogel design principles: developmental models benefit from reversible physical crosslinking and spatiotemporal programmability, while tumor models require chemically crosslinked networks ensuring mechanical homeostasis. Future research must prioritize developing pathological viscoelastic tumor models and integrating organ-on-a-chip technologies to achieve coupled mechano-biochemical regulation, thereby bridging the microenvironmental recapitulation gap between these two research domains. 6 Challenges and outlook The application of mechanically controlled hydrogels in organoid culture has garnered significant attention due to their ability to offer precise control over the mechanical properties that are essential for maintaining organoid growth, differentiation, and function [ 99 109 18 [158] [159] [160] Fig. 11 Fig. 11 Challenges and future directions of mechanically controlled hydrogels in organoids. (A) (B) (A) (B) 163 (C) 166 (D) 21 (E) 173 (F) 180 Fig. 11 6.1 Challenges of mechanically controlled hydrogels in organoids 6.1.1 Limited understanding of matrix-organoid interactions Despite advances in understanding how mechanical properties influence organoid development, the precise signaling pathways and cellular responses triggered by these properties remain poorly understood. Current studies investigating hydrogel mechanical parameters in shaping organoid phenotypes remain scarce, with identified key effectors predominantly localized to canonical mechanoresponsive pathways, including FAK/YAP, Wnt/β-catenin, ERK/KLF2, and TGF-β/Smad signaling. However, the mechanisms underlying how mechanical cues interact with biochemical signals to orchestrate stem cell fate decisions, lineage commitment, and tissue morphogenesis represent a critical knowledge gap [ 21 161 in vitro Fig. 11 6.1.2 Complexity of hydrogel design Despite their advantages in mechanical tunability and reproducibility, synthetic hydrogels exhibit inherent limitations. Critically, they often lack intrinsic bioactivity due to the absence of native ECM-derived biochemical cues (e.g., growth factors, adhesion motifs), which can impede cell-ECM signaling essential for organoid maturation [ 162 163 Fig. 11 164 6.1.3 Limited vascularization and nutrient transport Organoids development often faces significant hurdles in terms of vascularization (the formation of blood vessels within the organoid) and efficient nutrient and oxygen transport [ 165 166 Fig. 11 167 168 169 6.2 Prospects and future directions of mechanically controlled hydrogels in organoids 6.2.1 Tailoring hydrogel properties enhanced understanding of matrix-organoid interactions Future hydrogels may incorporate dynamic properties that allow the stiffness or viscoelasticity to change over time, better mimicking the changes that occur during organ development or disease progression [ 21 89 170 Fig. 11 162 171 6.2.2 Mechanically tunable hydrogels for organoid bioprinting 3D bioprinting enables precise manipulation of biophysical properties, including organoid size, cell number and conformation, with modification of organoid conformation substantially increasing the reproducibility and complexity of engineered tissues [ 172 173 Fig. 11 174 175 176 177 Despite significant advances in bioprinting technologies, their implementation for organoid engineering remains exploratory due to persistent technical barriers. Chief among these are challenges in fabricating high-resolution vascularized constructs: cell viability and function are compromised by shear-induced damage during bioink extrusion and cytotoxic UV crosslinking. Equally problematic, current strategies fail to recapitulate perfusable, hierarchical vasculature, invariably producing necrotic cores in volumetric tissues. Furthermore, material limitations impose critical trade-offs—bioink rheology must simultaneously ensure printability, maintain tissue-mimetic stiffness, and permit dynamic extracellular matrix remodeling [ 178 6.2.3 Integration of mechanically controllable hydrogels with organ-on-a-chip technology Organoid-on-a-chip platforms are revolutionizing the field of tissue engineering which allows integration with sensors, microfluidic systems, and other technologies to create dynamic monitoring systems for organoid growth [ 179 180 Fig. 11 [181] [182] [183] 184 185 Despite their transformative potential, organ-on-a-chip platforms face significant biological and engineering complexities. Critically, simplified microfluidic designs often fail to recapitulate native tissue heterogeneity or multi-organ systemic crosstalk, thereby limiting physiological relevance. Furthermore, real-time monitoring of metabolic and mechanical cues remains constrained by inadequate sensor biocompatibility and spatial resolution [ 186 187 188 This review advances beyond existing literature by establishing a cohesive framework spanning ECM biomechanics, hydrogel synthesis, organoid applications, and future challenges [ 189 While this review comprehensively explores the critical roles of hydrogel stiffness and viscoelasticity in regulating organoid morphogenesis, differentiation, and disease modeling, it acknowledges a limitation in systematically addressing other key mechanical and structural properties of the hydrogels. Parameters such as shear stress, elasticity, and pore size also profoundly influence cell-ECM interactions and organoid behavior. For instance, shear stress generated by microfluidic flow in vessel-on-a-chip systems is essential for driving endothelial cell alignment and vascular network maturation within blood vessel organoids and kidney organoids [ 190 191 88 192 7 Conclusion Hydrogels offer more precise control over composition and physical properties compared to traditional Matrigel, effectively addressing the issue of Matrigel's uncontrollable mechanical characteristics. This review explores the synthesis of mechanically tunable hydrogels and their applications in organoid research, aiming to provide a novel framework for developing hydrogels with customizable properties in the future. We focus on how the mechanical properties of hydrogels, particularly stiffness and viscoelasticity, influence organoid development. These advancements hold the potential to more accurately replicate the mechanical microenvironment of the human body, providing valuable insights into the study of ECM mechanics and its impact on cellular behavior.
