Ischemic stroke ranks as the second leading cause of mortality and the third disability worldwide. Disruption of energy metabolism and subsequent inflammation driven by oxidative stress constitute significant barriers to functional recovery. Proper distribution and function preservation of mitochondria are essential for maintaining energy homeostasis and modulating the inflammatory response during cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury. Accumulating evidence indicates that both dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments and functional mitochondria undergo intracellular and intercellular transmission, significantly influencing stroke outcomes. The review details two contrasting mitochondrial processes in ischemic stroke: the release of dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments into the cytoplasm or extracellular space and the entry of functional mitochondria into damaged cells, which plays a dual role: friend or foe. The release of dysfunctional fragments activates downstream pattern recognition receptors, including the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes pathway, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3/absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome, and Toll-like receptors, triggering inflammatory cascades within the neurovascular unit and initiating cell death pathways contributing to cerebral injury. In contrast, the transfer of functional mitochondria plays a protective role by attenuating oxidative stress, preserving mitochondrial quality control, restoring neuronal energy metabolism, inhibiting apoptosis, and maintaining blood-brain barrier integrity. Therapeutic approaches that inhibit the release of dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments, enhance functional mitochondria transfer, or apply mitochondrial transplantation offer significant potential for improving outcomes in ischemic stroke.

Pathologically, it is characterized by an acute collapse of energy metabolism resulting from cerebral blood flow interruption [ 1 2 3 4 5 The mitochondrial membrane system forms the core structural basis for cellular energy metabolism, consisting of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), and intermembrane space (IMS), which collectively establish dual physical and functional barriers [ 6 6 7 8 c c 9 ( 10 11 12 13 14 12 15 The present review provides a comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms underlying mitochondrial fragments release from dysfunctional mitochondria within the NVU, focusing on the pathways and therapeutic potential of functional mitochondria transfer in ischemic stroke. The goal is to elucidate the intricate interplay between mitochondrial content release and intercellular functional mitochondria transfer, thereby providing new insights into their potential as therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke. 2 Ischemic stroke pathophysiology Ischemic stroke is a prevalent cerebrovascular disorder with multiple risk factors, including hypertension, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis, obesity, hypercoagulability, and obstructive sleep apnea [ 16 17 18 19 20 The essence of oxidative stress lies in the imbalance between oxidant generation and the antioxidant defense system [ 21 22 Fig. 1 23 24 2 - 25 2 - 26 27 26 28 2 - 2 2 29 2 - 29 30 Fig. 1 ROS and RNS generation in neurons during ischemic stroke Ischemic stroke induces ATP depletion, triggering massive glutamate release that activates NMDA receptors and ultimately leads to calcium ion influx. Ca 2+ 2 - 2+ 2 - 2+ 2 - 2 2 2+ 2+ 2 - − 2 - 2 2 2 2 2 2 - 2 2 − Fig. 1 However, ATP depletion compromised the crucial antioxidant defense system. Lacking ATP, the core enzyme of the glutathione (GSH) system, glutathione reductase (GR) fails to reduce oxidized glutathione (GSSG) back to GSH. Simultaneously, the NADPH-dependent pentose phosphate pathway is impaired, further weakening GSH regeneration capacity [ 31 2 2 27 2 - 2 2 2 2 2 2 25 25 32 33 In ischemic stroke, oxidative stress acts as both an executor of damage and a signal amplifier. It dynamically interacts with energy metabolism disturbances, excitotoxicity, BBB disruption, neuroinflammation, and cell death pathways. Together, these processes accelerate brain tissue destruction and lead to severe neurological deficits. 3 Mitochondrial fragments release and functional mitochondria transfer Mitochondria play a central role in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke by mediating energy metabolism dysfunction and neuroinflammation [ 34 35 c 36 37 38 37 39 The release of dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments by damaged cells serves as a sensitive indicator of cellular distress, transmitting signals to surrounding cells and initiating the transfer of functional mitochondria to injured cells. In cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (CI/RI) models, neurons release damaged mitochondria that are recognized by astrocytes as a “help me” signal [ 11 11 Functional mitochondria transfer refers to the process by which mitochondria are transferred from one cell to another, serving to maintain cellular homeostasis and respond to pathological stress [ 12 40 41 12 42 13 43 4 Dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments in the NVU The NVU, consisting of neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and vascular endothelial cells, plays a central role in regulating cerebral blood flow, maintaining BBB integrity, and providing metabolic support to neurons. Under pathological conditions such as cerebral ischemia, hypoxia, or oxidative stress, dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments are released into the extracellular space through various pathways, including mPTP opening, BAK/BAX oligomerization, and GSDMD-mediated pore formation. Mitochondrial components such as mtDNA, ROS, cytochrome c 4.1 Release of mitochondrial fragments Mitochondria, the central hub of energy metabolism in eukaryotic cells, enclose numerous functional molecules within the matrix and cristae, bounded by a double membrane structure. These organelles regulate cellular energy homeostasis and fate through dynamic and tightly controlled signaling networks [ 44 45 c, a 46 47 48 2+ 3+ + 2+ 49 50 2 - 51 52 Under physiological conditions, transient mPTP, formed by the ANT, VDAC, and cyclophilin D (Cyp D), opening participates in Ca 2+ 52 2+ c 3+ [53] [54] [55] 56 c 57 58 59 60 Dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments are expelled into the extracellular space via EVs actively [ 61 62 63 64 65 4.2 Mitochondrial·fragments activate PRRs Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments in the NVU. Stimulation derived from plasma membrane NOX, cytoplasmic XO, and mitochondrial ROS triggers the opening of the mPTP, leading to the release of mitochondrial contents, mitochondrial fragmentation, and even cell death. Neuronal mtDNA activates the cGAS-STING pathway within neurons, inducing ER stress and triggering panoptosis, while simultaneously promoting mitophagy. Neuron-derived dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments, including mtDNA, ox-mtDNA, ATP, and CL, synergize with astrocyte-derived ATP to activate microglial PRRs: cGAS-STING axis, NLRP3/AIM2 inflammasomes, and TLRs. Activation of these PRRs induces microglia polarization toward the pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype, characterized by upregulation of IL-1β and TNF-α. Affected microglia generate mtROS and oxidize mtDNA to form ox-mtDNA. Both mtROS and ox-mtDNA directly activate the NLRP3 inflammasome. Furthermore, mitochondrial fragments released by microglia promote the transformation of astrocytes into the neurotoxic A1 phenotype. A1 astrocytes and M1 microglia cooperatively exacerbate neuroinflammation by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-6, thereby intensifying neuronal apoptosis and BBB disruption.NVU, Neurovascular unit; mtDNA, Mitochondrial DNA; cGAS-STING, Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes; ER, Endoplasmic reticulum; ox-mtDNA, Oxidized mitochondrial DNA; ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; CL, Cardiolipin; PRRs, Pattern recognition receptors; NLRP3, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3; AIM2, Absent in melanoma 2; TLRs, Toll-like receptors; IL-1β, Interleukin-1 beta; TNF-α, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha; Cyt c c Fig. 2 4.2.1 cGAS-STING The cGAS-STING pathway functions as a pivotal sensor of cytosolic DNA and represents a key link between mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation. cGAS possesses a nucleotidyltransferase catalytic domain and two DNA-binding domains, maintaining the enzyme in an autoinhibited conformation under resting conditions [ 66 67 68 69 69 70 71 72 73 74 As immune cells, microglia respond to abnormal DNA signals first in the central nervous system (CNS) [ 75 75 76 77 77 Neuronal mtDNA accumulates in the cytoplasm under stress conditions, activating the intracellular cGAS-STING signaling pathway. Following activation, the cGAS-STING complex is trafficked to lysosomes through interaction with microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3), facilitating a lysosome-dependent negative feedback loop that limits sustained type I IFN signaling [ 72 78 79 80 80 81 82 4.2.2 NLRP3 inflammasome The NLRP3 inflammasome is one of the most extensively studied members of the inflammasome family and serves as a key cytoplasmic innate immune sensor. It responds to a series of DAMPs stimuli, initiating inflammasome assembly and triggering pro-inflammatory signaling cascades [ 83 84 85 [86] [87] [88] 89 90 91 4.2.3 AIM2 inflammasome As a key intracellular innate immune sensor, the AIM2 inflammasome is essential for recognizing cytosolic DNA derived from pathogens or damaged host cells. Detection of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), including mtDNA, in the cytoplasm leads to inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation, and the proteolytic maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, amplifying the inflammatory response [ 92 93 94 95 96 4.2.4 TLRs TLRs are pattern recognition receptors located on the cell surface or within endosomal compartments [ 97 98 99 c 100 101 5 Functional mitochondria transfer in ischemic stroke Ischemic stroke is characterized by energy failure resulting from the interruption of cerebral blood flow [ 102 13 103 5.1 Mechanisms of functional mitochondrial transfer To date, the molecular and signaling mechanisms underlying mitochondrial transfer in ischemic stroke have not been fully elucidated. Most studies suggest that tunneling TNTs and EVs serve as the primary pathways for functional mitochondria transfer. However, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the key drivers that trigger functional mitochondria transfer between donor and recipient cells, as well as the subsequent cellular activities. By systematically reviewing existing evidence and synthesizing various molecular clues, this article aims to provide direction for future research into the underlying mechanisms of intercellular mitochondrial transfer.

Originating from the plasma membrane, TNTs form within minutes and maintain stable connections between cells for several minutes to hours [ 104 105 106 107 in vitro 108 Ischemia impairs mitochondrial energy metabolism and disrupts the ETC, leading to electron leakage and excessive generation of ROS, such as O 2 - 2 2, 2 2 [109] [110] [111] 112 13 [113] [114] [115] 109 116 109 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 Experimental evidence demonstrates that coculture of MSCs with hypoxic neuronal cells induces a time-dependent upregulation of SIRT-1 expression [ 124 125 124 [126] [127] [128] [129] 130 131 5.1.2 Extracellular vesicles EVs are heterogeneous membrane particles secreted by all cell types, classified into three categories by biogenesis, size, and composition: microvesicles (100 nm-1 μm), exosomes (30–100 nm), and apoptotic bodies (1–2 μm) [ 132 133 134 135 Ischemia/hypoxia-induced energy deficit disrupts ion homeostasis, culminating in Ca 2+ 2+ 136 137 2+ 2+ [138] [139] [140] 15 141 141 142 The mechanisms by which EVs containing functional mitochondria are internalized and integrated into recipient cells following ischemic stroke remain incompletely understood. Current evidence suggests that EVs uptake primarily occurs through endocytic pathways [ 143 144 145 146 Macropinocytosis, a form of pinocytosis, is an actin-dependent endocytic process characterized by the formation of large intracellular vacuoles. Recognized as a widespread and evolutionarily conserved mechanism, macropinocytosis has been proposed to have played a role in the early mitochondrial endosymbiosis event [ 147 148 [149] [150] [151] 148 152 146 144 153 5.1.3 Trigger signals The factors influencing functional mitochondria transfer encompass four aspects: donor cells, recipient cells, transfer vehicles, and the in vivo 2 - 2 2 − 43 154 2 2 155 11 2 2 2 2 110 11 43 156 157 However, it is emphasized that current evidence supporting these mechanisms primarily originates from in vitro in vivo 158 in vivo 5.2 Functions of mitochondria transfer In ischemic stroke, the transfer of functional mitochondria to damaged cells inhibits oxidative stress, maintains mitochondrial quality homeostasis, restores neuronal energy metabolism, suppresses apoptosis, and preserves BBB integrity. 5.2.1 Inhibition of oxidative stress In ischemic stroke, oxidative stress is both an executor of damage and an amplifier of signaling cascades. As the primary site of ROS generation, mitochondria critically determine the extent of cellular injury through functional status. Functional mitochondria transfer exerts multidimensional antioxidant effects, with core mechanisms encompass: restoration of energy metabolic homeostasis, direct scavenging of ROS, and mitophagy. Following the acquisition of functional mitochondria via TNTs or EVs, recipient cells demonstrate enhanced ATP biosynthesis capacity through functional mitochondrial integration. This process optimizes ETC functionality by preserving the integrity of Complexes I-IV, reducing O 2 - 124 159 124 160 161 Although functional mitochondria transfer is recognized to mitigate ROS, most evidence remains confined to in vitro in vivo 5.2.2 Maintaining mitochondrial quality control MQC is essential for preserving mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis [ 162 62 As a critical compensatory response in ischemic stroke, mitochondrial biogenesis reduces cerebral blood flow, leading to an insufficient neuronal energy supply. In this context, neurons adapt by increasing mitochondrial content to meet elevated energy demands [ 163 163 In ischemic stroke, astrocytes have been shown to transfer functional mitochondria to neurons via CD38-mediated EVs, restoring neuronal viability. Furthermore, stem cells transfer functional mitochondria to neurons through TNTs, resulting in increased neuronal ATP production [ 15 124 164 130 Transferred mitochondria represent a small portion of the recipient cell's overall mitochondrial network. Activation of mitochondrial biogenesis may be more critical in sustaining energy metabolism. Healthy exogenous mitochondria can promptly initiate oxidative phosphorylation to mitigate acute energy deficits and subsequently proliferate within recipient cells, triggering mitochondrial biogenesis and supporting long-term energy restoration. Recent studies have shown that coculture of stem cells with hypoxic PC12 cells increases SIRT-1 expression in PC12 cells, which upregulates PGC-1α and promotes mitochondrial biogenesis. These findings provide further support for the role of functional mitochondria transfer in activating endogenous biogenic pathways [ 130 165 in vivo Mitochondria are morphologically dynamic organelles that undergo continuous fission and fusion, essential for regulating mitochondrial integrity, bioenergetic function, and cellular homeostasis under physiological and pathological conditions [ 166 Dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1), a key regulator of fission, is recruited to the outer mitochondrial membrane by several receptor proteins, including mitochondrial fission protein 1 (Fis1), 49 and 51-kDa mitochondrial dynamin-like proteins, and the mitochondrial fission factor. DRP1 oligomerizes and interacts with dynamin 2 to form a constrictive ring-like structure, ultimately severs the mitochondrial membrane through GTP hydrolysis and mechanical constriction [ [167] [168] [169] 170 171 124 Mitochondrial fusion facilitates the exchange of matrix contents and metabolites, such as proteins, mtDNA, or membrane components, essential for the ETC [ 172 173 174 124 15 5.2.3 Neuronal energy metabolism restoration Cellular energy metabolism encompasses the biochemical processes by which cells generate and utilize energy to sustain essential physiological functions. Mitochondria, often referred to as the powerhouses of the cell, serve as the primary sites of ATP production. In the nervous system, ATP is primarily generated through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation pathways [ 175 176 176 177 178 179 Functional mitochondria transfer has been reported to improve cellular energy metabolism [ 124 124 15 124 180 124 0 164 0 164 12 in vivo 5.2.4 Apoptosis inhibition Neuronal apoptosis in ischemic stroke proceeds through two pathways: the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways [ 181 182 c, a c 182 183 183 184 15 130 159 185 15 159 159 in vivo in vivo 5.2.5 BBB integrity maintenance As a selectively permeable interface, the BBB, formed primarily by brain endothelial cells, safeguards the brain from harmful substances while maintaining intracranial homeostasis. Astrocytes, endothelial cells, pericytes, and microglia jointly regulate blood-brain exchange and engage in intercellular communication, collaboratively generating survival signals essential for preserving BBB integrity and central nervous system homeostasis [ [186] [187] [188] [189] 131 190 191 190 192 193 194 195 196 130 130 in vitro 131 197 197 [197] [198] [199] 6 Targeting therapeutic strategies Neuronal injury is a critical pathological process of ischemic stroke. As previously outlined, suppressing the release of damaged mitochondria and their associated components and promoting the transfer of functional mitochondria are essential for reducing neuronal injury. In addition, mitochondrial transplantation has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach, improving neurological deficits following ischemic injury. Based on these mechanistic insights, therapeutic strategies are categorized into three principal modalities. 6.1 Inhibiting the release of mitochondrial fragments Under ischemic-hypoxic conditions, mitochondrial damage frequently exceeds the compensatory capacity of mitophagy, resulting in increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and the subsequent release of dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments. This pathological cascade activates inflammatory signaling and promotes neuronal cell death, aggravating ischemic stroke progression and worsening clinical outcomes.

[ 217 Specifically, studies confirm that mitochondrial transplantation effectively enhances systemic antioxidant capacity. For instance, transplantation of autologous mitochondria isolated from rat skeletal muscle (e.g., pectoralis major) into the lateral ventricle significantly increased neuronal levels of key antioxidant enzymes, including SOD and GSH-Px, by approximately 3-fold compared to controls [ 216 217 anti 218 c 216 218 219 220 221 221 + 222 223 220 Collectively, these effects, including attenuated oxidative stress, suppressed apoptosis and pyroptosis, modulated immune responses, promoted myelin repair, and induced neurogenesis, converge to form a complex mechanistic network underpinning mitochondrial transplantation facilitated brain tissue repair. Ultimately, this therapy effectively reduces cerebral infarct volume and improves neurobehavioral function in ischemic stroke models. 7 Conclusion and perspectives Dysfunctional and functional mitochondria exert a critical influence on the pathogenesis, progression, and clinical outcomes of ischemic stroke. The present review systematically delineates the mechanistic framework and functional consequences of dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments release versus functional mitochondria transfer, clarifying their opposing roles in regulating neuroinflammation and mediating cellular salvage. These insights offer new conceptual foundations for understanding mitochondrial pathophysiology in ischemic stroke therapy. Under physiological conditions, damaged mitochondria are selectively eliminated through mitophagy to preserve mitochondrial quality control. When mitochondrial injury surpasses the capacity of mitophagy, mitochondrial components escape into the cytoplasm via mechanisms such as mPTP opening, BAX/BAK oligomerization, and GSDMD-mediated pore formation. These fragments subsequently activate inflammatory pathways through cGAS-STING signaling, the NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasomes, and Toll-like receptors, culminating in regulated cell death. Within the neurovascular unit, these responses manifest as microglial M1 polarization, A1 astrocyte transformation, BBB disruption, neuronal apoptosis, and enhanced infiltration of peripheral immune cells. In contrast, functional mitochondria transfer via TNTs and EVs serves as an intrinsic neuroprotective mechanism. During ischemic injury, neurons transfer functional mitochondria to astrocytes through CD38 or LRP1-mediated EVs trafficking for lysosomal degradation, thereby supporting mitochondrial quality homeostasis. Stem cell-derived functional mitochondria transfer through TNTs promotes neuronal recovery, with Miro1 identified as a key regulator of mitochondrial trafficking. TNTs mediated mitochondrial exchange among pericytes, endothelial cells, and astrocytes also play a crucial role in maintaining BBB integrity. EVs-mediated functional mitochondria transfer typically involves uptake through endocytosis or macropinocytosis, followed by fusion with host mitochondrial networks via MFN1/2 and OPA1-dependent processes. However, emerging studies suggest that exogenous mitochondria may not always integrate directly with endogenous mitochondria but instead activate recipient cell responses via the PINK1-Parkin mitophagy pathway [ 161 Despite substantial progress in elucidating the roles of dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments release and functional mitochondria transfer in cerebral pathology, several critical questions remain unresolved. First, while mitochondrial transfer shows potential in mitigating cellular oxidative stress, current research faces two limitations: the exact mechanism remains obscure, and the specific components and origins of the reduced oxidative stress products have not been sufficiently traced or studied. Second, although dysfunctional mitochondrial fragments trigger inflammatory responses, the dual role of inflammation in disease progression requires further clarification, particularly regarding the threshold of mitochondrial damage necessary to initiate detrimental outcomes. Third, given that both dysfunctional fragments and functional mitochondria are transported via EVs, the presence of residual fragments within mitochondria bearing EVs and the molecular mechanisms governing cargo selectivity remain to be defined. Fourth, the mechanisms by which functional mitochondria evade lysosomal degradation to sustain energy metabolism in ischemic neurons have not yet been fully elucidated. Clarifying these processes may enhance the efficacy of exogenous mitochondrial delivery and further inform research in cellular bioenergetics. Fifth, while functional mitochondria transfer from microglia to neurons via TNTs has been observed in neurodegenerative models, the presence and functional relevance of such interactions in ischemic stroke remain unverified [ 224 225 in vitro in vivo in vitro in vivo in vitro in vivo in vitro 5.2 in vivo in vitro in vivo in vivo CRediT authorship contribution statement Lan Yang: Xuan Wei: Zi Liao: Bei Chen: Guang Zeng: Zhigang Mei: Funding information This work was supported by the 10.13039/501100001809 National Natural Science Foundation of China 82174167 10.13039/501100004735 Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province 2023JJ30464] 2025JJ90001 Furong Scholars Program of Hunan Province 2024 Young Qihuang Scholar Support Project of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine 2022 10.13039/501100014978 Hunan University of Chinese Medicine 2024CX102 Declaration of competing interest The authors declare no conflict of interest in the manuscript.
