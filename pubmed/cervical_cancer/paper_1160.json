However, EXO1 loss is well-tolerated, suggesting the existence of compensatory mechanisms that could be exploited in DDR-deficient cancers. Using CRISPR screening, we find EXO1 loss as synthetic lethal with many DDR genes somatically inactivated in cancers, including Fanconi Anaemia (FA) pathway and BRCA1-A complex genes. We also identify the spliceosome factor and tumour suppressor ZRSR2 as synthetic lethal with loss of EXO1 and show that ZRSR2-deficient cells are attenuated for FA pathway activation, exhibiting cisplatin sensitivity and radial chromosome formation. Furthermore, FA or ZRSR2 deficiencies depend on EXO1 nuclease activity and can be potentiated in combination with PARP inhibitors or ionizing radiation. Finally, we uncover dysregulated replication-coupled repair as the driver of synthetic lethality between EXO1 and FA pathway attributable to defective fork reversal, elevated replication fork speeds, post-replicative single stranded DNA exposure and DNA damage. These findings implicate EXO1 as a synthetic lethal vulnerability and promising drug target in a broad spectrum of DDR-deficient cancers unaddressed by current therapies. EXO1 performs multiple roles in DNA replication and DNA damage repair (DDR), but its role in DDR-deficient cancers remains unclear. Here, the authors find EXO1 loss as synthetic lethal with many DDR genes involved in various cancers, including genes from Fanconi Anaemia pathway, BRCA1-A complex, and spliceosome factor ZRSR2; such interactions represent potential clinical targets.

Germline mutations in DDR factors have been recognised amongst common cancer driver mutations, as exemplified by BRCA and mismatch repair gene mutations in homologous recombination (HR) deficient and microsatellite unstable tumours, respectively 1 3 4 5 Here we define synthetic lethal interactions with exonuclease EXO1, which has revealed known and previously unappreciated genetic vulnerabilities that exist in many cancers. Specifically, we uncover cancer vulnerabilities amongst synthetic lethal hits with EXO1 loss, including deficiencies in BRCA1-A complex factors, FA pathway genes and the splicing factor and tumour suppressor ZRSR2. We show that ZRSR2 loss phenocopies FA pathway deficiency and implicate EXO1 and FANCG in replication fork reversal and the suppression of post-replicative ssDNA gaps.

In cells with a functional Fanconi Anaemia pathway, replication forks that encounter a DNA lesion can undergo fork reversal as a way of safeguarding genome integrity, ensuring sustainable replication fork speed and cell viability. However, in FA-deficient cells, in which genome stability is challenged with a higher incidence of DNA lesions, this mechanism of genome stability maintenance critically relies on EXO1. Loss of EXO1 in FA-deficient cells leads to a defect in replication fork reversal, elevated replication fork speed and an increase in post-replicative ssDNA gap formation, which ultimately contributes to DNA damage and results in cell death. Discussion In conclusion, this study reveals extensive synthetic lethal genetic interactions with EXO1 in human cells, which defines a framework for EXO1-based targeting of cancers with deficiencies in DDR pathways for which current therapeutic approaches are not sufficiently effective. Our genome-wide CRISPR dropout screen identified established and previously unappreciated DDR factors that participate in mechanisms that are compensated by EXO1. Importantly, we define notable cancer vulnerabilities amongst synthetic lethal hits with EXO1 loss, such as deficiencies in BRCA1-A complex factors, Fanconi Anaemia pathway genes and the splicing factor and tumour suppressor ZRSR2. ZRSR2 was the only splicing factor that scored as a significant hit in the EXO1 synthetic lethal screen. Since ZRSR2 clustered with other top hits, including many genes previously implicated in FA pathway activation, we explored the possibility that ZRSR2 loss might impact genome stability. Indeed, deletion of ZRSR2 conferred elevated levels of spontaneous phosphorylation of RPA at serine 33, CHK2 on threonine 68 and H2AX on serine 139, indicative of elevated spontaneous replication stress and DNA damage. Consistent with the clustering of ZRSR2 and the FA pathway in the CRISPR screen, we observed that ZRSR2 ZRSR2 EXO1-FANCG EXO1-ZRSR2 Mechanistic analysis of the synthetic lethal interaction observed in EXO1-FANCG 6 FANCG EXO1-FANCG 53 33 EXO1-FANCG 2h Importantly, homozygous deletions of factors identified as synthetic lethal with EXO1 loss in this study are found in 8.49% of all cancers (Table 1 33 1 Methods Cell lines eHAP is a diploidised HAP1 cell line, derived from the chronic myelogenous leukaemia KBM-7 cell line (haploid originally purchased from Horizon Discovery). eHAP iCas9 20 54 2 Plasmids and cloning For the generation of KO cell lines, lenti-sgRNA plasmids (-Puro and -Hygro, Addgene #104990 and #104991) 55 56 6 57 13 13 7 7 E.coli E.coli ccd E.coli Generation of lentiviruses and transduction of cell lines Lentiviruses were produced in HEK293FT cell line by transfection with plasmids expressing capside proteins (pLP1, pLP2 and VSVG) and with lentiviral expression plasmid as described previously 20 6 g Generation of constitutive KO cell lines with CRISPR-Cas9 Constitutive knockout cell lines (for EXO1 FANCG ZRSR2 5 Generation of complemented cell lines with piggyBac transposon system For the generation of complemented cell lines, 2 × 10 5 Cas9 editing efficiency assay Cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing BFP and GFP, as well as sgRNA targeting GFP sequence (Addgene #67980) 58 Generation of inducible KO cell lines with CRISPR-Cas9 Cells with inducible Cas9 were transduced with lentiviruses containing lenti-sgRNA-Puro (or -Hygro) with sgRNA targeting GOI. Transduced cells were selected with puromycin (0.4 μg/ml for eHAP iCas9 or 0.5 μg/ml for HeLa Kyoto iCas9 cell lines) for 48–72 h before expansion and testing for KO. Sequencing of inducible cell lines and deconvolution of sequencing chromatograms To analyse editing efficiency for the targeted locus, samples were collected at seeding for a particular assay. PureLink Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen) was used to obtain DNA for PCR (with Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, NEB), followed by PCR purification and sequencing (both Genewiz services).

Gene Ontology (GO) Biological Process pathway analysis Analyses were performed through Enrichr portal 62 64 p Clonogenic assay for viability Cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 200 cells/well a density (in 4 technical replicates) and colonies were allowed to grow for 6 days before fixing with 0.5% crystal violet stain with 20% methanol. Stain was rinsed with water and after drying plates were imaged with GelCount (Oxford Optronics). GelCount software was used to analyse colony numbers in each well. Colony count was averaged over technical replicates and normalised against the control. Cell Titre Glo assay for viability Cells were seeded in opaque 96-well plates at a 200 cells/well density (in 3 technical replicates) and allowed to grow for 6 days before cell lysis with CellTitre-Glo reagent (Promega). Luminescence signal was readout using CLARIOstar Plus Microplate Reader (BMG Labtech) and exported via its MARS Data Analysis software. Values for the signal in technical replicates were averaged before normalising against the control. Sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs and DDR factor inhibitors Cells were seeded in opaque 96-well plates at 200 cells/well density (for eHAP cells) or at 500 cells/well density (for HeLa Kyoto cells). Compounds were added to the media the next day and cells were allowed to grow for 5 more days before cell lysis with CellTitre-Glo reagent and processing as above. Luminescence signal values were normalised against untreated control wells for each cell line. Compounds purchased from Selleckchem used in this study: PARPi olaparib (AZD2281), PARPi talazoparib (BMN 673), PARPi veliparib (ABT-888), ATMi (KU-55933), ATRi (Ceralasertib, AZD6738), TYMSi (Pemetrexed, LY231514 65 Sensitivity to ionising radiation Cells were seeded 4 h before irradiation for a clonogenic assay for treatments with the indicated dose.

The dose rate was determined by probe reading, and exposure times were adjusted based on this prior to all irradiations. The treatments were carried out at 300 kV, 10 mA with a dose rate of ~0.5 mGy/min. Cell proliferation assay with Incucyte For proliferation assay of eHAP cell lines, cells were seeded 4 days after Cas9 expression induction with doxycycline into an opaque 96-well plate (black wells), with 1000 cells seeded per well (seeding in three wells for each cell line). For proliferation assay of PL11 cell lines, cells were seeded 5 days after transduction with lentiCRISPR-sgNT or sg EXO1 Apoptosis assay with Incucyte Media on cells seeded for the assay (coupled to cell proliferation assay) was changed to contain NucView 488 (BioTracker) apoptotic-induced nuclear dye (at 1 mM final concentration).

Software Incucyte Basic Analyzer (Sartorius) was used to obtain information on the percentage of confluency and the number of green nuclei. To be able to correlate confluency to number of nuclei for the ratios analysis, eHAP iCas9 cell line was separately seeded in an opaque 96 well plate in a range of 1000–16,000 cells per well (in a technical duplicate) and DRAQ5 dye (at 5 μM final concentration) was added with media the following day to generate a dataset of DRAQ5 images and brightfield images.
