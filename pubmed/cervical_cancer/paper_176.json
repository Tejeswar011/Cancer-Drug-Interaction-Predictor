Tumors frequently display an aberrant glycosylation profile, often characterized by a hyperexpression of sialylated glycan moieties. Here, we provide a holistic view on how sialylation alters cellular behavior in the tumor niche that not only includes tumor cells but also comprises the intricate interplay of cancer cells with stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and immune cells. We discuss how sialylation alters tumor cell biology, migration, and metastasis, as well as how it impacts local infiltration of immune cell subsets, their differentiation, and function via Keywords sialic acids tumor microenvironment antitumor immunity antitumor therapy pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Abbreviations CAR-T chimeric antigen receptor T cell CMAS CMP N DC dendritic cell EGFR epidermal growth factor receptor EV extracellular vesicle IL interleukin MUC mucin PDAC pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma TAM tumor-associated macrophage TGF-β1 transforming growth factor beta 1 Reviewed by members of the JBC Editorial Board. Edited by Robert Haltiwanger An aberrant glycophenotype is a common feature of cancer cells and includes de novo O N 1 2 N N N cytidine monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase CMAH N 3 N 4 5 N O O O One of the most studied glycoproteins in cancer are the mucins (MUCs), proteins containing hundreds of glycosylation sites in their backbone. In normal tissue, MUCs are expressed in the apical membrane of polarized epithelial cells; however, cancer cells often lose their polarization, resulting in the presence of MUCs in the tumor microenvironment and the bloodstream ( 6 Fig. 1 Figure 1 Overview of common tumor-associated glycan structures. 108 In this review, we will discuss how sialic acids affect cancer cell biology and antitumor immunity, focusing on developments within the oncology field of the last 5 years ( Fig. 2 Figure 2 Recent developments in the sialic acid axis in cancer cell biology and immunity. via N Regulation of sialic acid expression at the tumor site Many tumor types exhibit abnormal expression of sialylated glycoproteins and lipids, with alterations in both the levels as well as the type of structures found on the cancer cells. This aberrant expression is even more prominent in necrotic core regions of especially breast, thyroid, and liver tumors, reflected by a conserved pattern of sialylated biantennary N 7 8 9 de novo 10 11 Lately, miRNAs have been implicated in regulating the sialic acid phenotype of tumors. miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional control of gene expression. They are mostly known for silencing gene expression by destabilizing mRNA and for mediating mRNA destruction. Indeed, miR-21, miR-30e, and miR-26b all negatively correlate with downregulated ST6GALNAC1 expression in colorectal cancer ( 12 13 N 14 15 During tumor development, many different cell types accumulate in the tissue and create a niche in which tumor cells grow along with stromal cells and various immune cells. Cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of cancer cells, resembling actual stem cells. These cells display a unique ability to self-renew and have an enhanced ability to grow in an anchorage-independent manner, rendering them more tumorigenic and metastatic. These cancer stem cells appear to be characterized by a distinct glycosylation profile (elegantly reviewed in Ref. ( 16 O 17 18 19 20 Not only tumor cell sialylation but also sialylation of stromal cells attributes to the growing tumor niche ( 21 22 vice versa 23 via 24 via 25 In general, recent research has highlighted the multilayered complexity in maintaining the sialylation phenotype of tumors, ranging from regulation of sialylation pathway gene expression and availability of CMP–sialic acid donors to the intricate interplay between cancer cells and surrounding stromal and immune cells. Sialic acids in endorsing the malignant tumor phenotype Changes in glycosylation patterns have been associated with malignant transformation and clinical outcomes in several cancer types, prompting ongoing research into the mechanisms involved and potential clinical applications. Recently, transcriptomic analysis of glycosylation-related genes and pathways, using publicly available bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets from tumor samples and cancer cell lines, identified genes and pathways strongly associated with different tumor types, which may represent novel diagnostic biomarkers ( 26 27 α2-6 sialylation and especially ST6GAL1 have a strong tumor-promoting role in among others, pancreatic cancer ( 28 29 30 LSL.G12D/+; ST6Gal1 N 29 The TNF–TNFR1 axis plays a crucial role in balancing cancer cell death and survival. While cell-surface TNFR1 initiates a survival program upon TNF binding, TNFR1 internalization triggers caspase-mediated apoptosis. ST6GAL1-mediated α2–6 sialylation of TNFR1 promotes cancer cell survival by preventing TNFR1 oligomerization, high-affinity TNF binding, and subsequent internalization ( 28 31 30 31 32 Not only α2–6 sialylation of Gal appears to stimulate cancer malignancy but also α2–6 sialylated GalNAc has a tumor-promoting role. In lung cancer cells, ST6GALNAC3 controls the mRNA stability and protein expression of the transferrin receptor protein 1 and is a critical regulator of tumor cell iron metabolism ( 33 34 Interestingly, also opposite effects have been reported. Blocking the sialidase NEU1, thus increasing cellular sialylation, hampered proliferation and apoptosis in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 ( 35 Next to controlling tumor cell growth and apoptosis, sialic acids are also involved in regulating tumor angiogenesis. ST3GAL1-mediated sialylation of vasorin enhances its binding to transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), thereby promoting TGF-β1 signaling and expression of angiogenic genes ( 36 In ovarian cancer, expression of ST8SIA1 and ganglioside synthesis are particularly found in mesenchymal cancer cells and associated with worse prognosis ( 37 38 Sialic acids controlling tumor cell invasion and metastasis Sialic acids are well known to contribute to invasion and metastasis by promoting cell detachment, enhancing, and ultimately driving the spread of malignant cells. Classical rolling and adhesion receptors, like the selectins and their sialyl-Lewis antigen ligands, are important mediators of cancer cell motility and metastasis. Expression of sialyl-Lewis X A N 39 40 41 A 42 43 A 43 O 44 Interestingly, some tumors also express receptors for sialic acids. Especially, Siglec-15 is overexpressed by several tumor types, including hepatocellular, colorectal, thyroid, and cervical cancer, and promotes the cancer cell’s migratory capacity ( 45 46 47 via 45 via 46 48 47 EGFR itself is a sialylation target of the ST6GAL1 enzyme, regulating the mechanosignaling and ligand-dependent activity of EGFR. ST6GAL1 is upregulated in many tumor types, including prostate cancer, where it facilitates bone metastasis, a process that could be counteracted using sialyltransferase inhibitors ( 49 N 50 51 50 via O 52 Also the truncated O 53 54 55 Kras Trp53 in vivo 53 56 57 196 58 59 Sialic acid and intercellular communication via Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived membranous vesicles that facilitate cellular communication by transferring messengers, DNA/RNA, and proteins ( 60 61 62 62 63 64 EVs from several cancer types, including prostate, ovarian, and bladder cancer, have high levels of both α2–3 and α2–6 sialic acids ( 65 66 67 68 68 X 69 65 Sialic acid and the induction of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment During oncogenesis, tumor cells acquire mutations that result in the expression of neoantigens, which can be sensed by the immune system to build up an antitumor immune response. Release of these antigens by tumor cells allows the antigens to be captured by dendritic cells (DCs), which in the presence of immunogenic signals can trigger T-cell responses in the tumor-draining lymph node ( 70 70 71 72 Hypersialylation in both tumor and stroma is not only involved in hampering DC-induced T cell-mediated killing, but it has also been shown to drive the differentiation of tumor-infiltrating monocytes to monocyte-derived macrophages, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( 73 74 75 76 21 X X Sialylation is also able to reduce NK cell–mediated cytotoxicity of tumor cells ( 77 78 via 79 80 81 82 83 Although these cellular interactions consist of trans- cis 84 85 in vivo 86 87 These findings illustrate that sialylation of tumor and stromal cells may locally alter the immune cell infiltration, differentiation, and activity in the tumor niche, all to increase tumor growth and disease severity. Interestingly, immune cells in turn can affect cancer cell sialylation ( 23 Sialic acid targeting and resistance to therapy An elevated tumor sialylation profile also has strong implications for therapy, and research over the past few years has highlighted that sialylation and especially ST6GAL1 convey resistance to several types of cancer therapy, including immunotherapy, small-molecule inhibitors, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. ST6GAL1 is upregulated upon chemotherapy, preventing cancer cell apoptosis and thus reducing treatment efficacy ( 88 89 90 91 Resistance may also occur through the concomitant upregulation of sialic acid receptors, such as Siglec-9. In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, radiotherapy induces Siglec-9 expression and polarization of M2-like macrophages. These macrophages subsequently further augment the radioresistance and prime the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment ( 92 Nevertheless, the highly sialylated tumor microenvironment also offers opportunities for therapy. The multicellular strategies by which sialic acids promote immune evasion make them very interesting to modulate for future immunotherapy. Various studies have shown the beneficial effects of interfering in the sialic acid–Siglec axis, leading to reduced tumor growth and increased survival benefit. Preclinical models have highlighted that reduction of sialic acids by interfering with the expression of sialyltransferases or transporters increases percentages of effector CD8 T cells and reduces regulatory T cells. Tumor-targeted sialidases coupled to a HER2 antibody enhanced antitumor immunity in murine breast and melanoma models ( 93 94 NCT05259696 21 22 95 96 Single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics of patients with glioblastoma multiforme treated with neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy identified unique monocyte-derived tumor-associated macrophage subpopulations with functional plasticity that highly expressed the immunosuppressive SIGLEC9 97 + + 93 98 99 100 101 102 103 Next to targeted sialidases or developing high-affinity Siglec ligands that direct receptors to the lysosome for degradation ( 79 104 105 106 Conclusions and future directions Sialylation of the tumor microenvironment has been shown to have an enormous impact not only on tumor invasion and metastasis but also on locally imprinting immunity by engaging Siglecs as immune inhibitory receptors. A lot of attention has been given to ST6GAL1 and α2–6 sialylation of N 107 The further identification of sialoglycans, including their carrier proteins, as ligands for specific Siglecs could benefit biomarker discovery to select patients who are most likely to benefit from therapy. Preclinical experiments have already demonstrated that interfering in the Siglec–sialic acid axis may benefit response rates of future therapies by combining these with existing immune checkpoint therapies to maximize therapeutic benefit. It is, however, important to fully understand the biological effects of desialylation, as its impact is affecting a wide variety of immune cells and may vary according to tumor type. Whereas the biology of certain sialic acids is well understood, the individual contribution of both cis- trans Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of this article.
