Yet, there remains a need to develop methods to understand the interaction of microbiome factors with host cells and to characterize their potential therapeutic functions. To address this challenge, we developed a systems biology framework we term the Pharmacobiome for microbiome pharmacology analysis. The Pharmacobiome framework evaluates similarities between microbes, microbial byproducts, and known drugs based on their impact on host transcriptomic cellular signatures. Here, we apply our framework to characterization of the Anti-Gynecologic Cancer Vaginal Pharmacobiome. Using published vaginal microbiome multi-omics data from the Partners PrEP clinical trial, we constructed vaginal epithelial gene signatures associated with each profiled vaginal microbe and metabolite. We compared these microbiome-associated host gene signatures to post-drug perturbation host gene signatures related to 35 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures database to identify vaginal microbes and metabolites with high statistical and functional similarity to these drugs. We found that select lactobacilli particularly L. crispatus L. crispatus vaginal microbial community gynecological cancer anti-cancer systems biology multi-omics The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Due to sparse information on modulatory effects, the intricate relationship between the vaginal microbiota and gynecological cancers is not fully elucidated ( Chase et al., 2015 Ravel et al., 2011 Walther-António et al., 2016 The vaginal microbiome also plays a significant role in influencing the response to cancer therapy by regulating inflammation in the context of gynecologic cancers ( Łaniewski et al., 2020 Ventolini et al., 2022 Kudela et al., 2023 Manyam et al., 2021 Kudela et al., 2023 Kyrgiou and Moscicki, 2022 Sipos et al., 2021 Chambers et al., 2020 Sipos et al., 2021 In addition to understanding the role of the endogenous microbiome in gynecologic cancer and its response to chemotherapy, it may be possible to apply exogenous microbes as treatment adjuvants. Precision therapy could leverage specific microbes or microbial functions for a targeted and personalized treatment. This method enhances efficacy by considering individual microbial variability affecting drug response. However, precise timing and dosing are essential to avoid disrupting microbial balance, which could cause infections, resistance, or immune reactions. Understanding the complex microbial ecosystem is key to preventing adverse effects and optimizing outcomes ( Fernandes et al., 2022 Here, we propose a systems biology computational framework to characterize the therapeutic potential of microbes and their products, termed the Pharmacobiome Figure 1 Anti-Gynecologic Cancer Pharmacobiome in vitro Figure 1 Pharmacobiome workflow: transcriptomics, metabolomics, and microbiome composition data from the partners PrEP vaginal microbiome multiomics datasets were analyzed via Spearman correlation analysis to extract microbe-host gene and metabolite-host gene signatures. National Institutes of Health-National Cancer Institute drugs screening in the LINCS Small Chemical Perturbation datasets were extracted to identify drug-host gene signatures. microbiome-gene and drug-gene up- and down-regulated signatures were compared via Fisher's exact test to identify anti-cancer drug: vaginal microbe and anti-cancer drug: vaginal metabolite signature similarities. Flowchart illustrating a study involving PrEP participants and data analysis. It begins with inputs from the PrEP study, leading to Spearman correlation analysis of microbiota metabolites and RNA. This generates a microbiome/metabolite signature, which is compared with drug signatures from the LINCS database, comprising thirty-five drugs FDA-approved drugs for female gynecological cancers. The outputs display the similarity of downregulated and upregulated gene signatures, highlighting microbiota metabolites that mimic anti-cancer drugs, with Q value significance thresholds indicated. Materials and methods Human vaginal microbiome multi-omics data We obtained previously generated vaginal microbiome multi-omics data from a subgroup of 405 HIV-negative women enrolled in the Partners PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) study ( Berard et al., 2023 Baeten et al., 2012 Berard et al., 2023 For transcriptomic analysis Microbiome composition Metabolomic profiling Microbiome-associated host signature extraction We analyzed transcriptomics, microbiome composition, and metabolomics data from Group 2 participants to investigate the relationships between microbial, metabolic, and host gene expression profiles. Using R Studio (Version 2022.12.0+353), we calculated Spearman correlation coefficients to assess microbe-RNA and metabolite-RNA associations. Standard Spearman correlation analysis was used to determine associations between microbial relative abundances and host transcriptomic profiles, effectively capturing monotonic relationships without assuming linearity. This approach suits the non-linear interactions between microbiota and host gene expression. For metabolome data, partial Spearman correlation analysis was applied, incorporating microbiome composition—specifically Lactobacillus Lactobacillus iners Lactobacillus crispatus Coded identifiers were used to match between datasets to ensure data integrity. Correlations were quantified using the Spearman coefficient (rho), which ranges from −1 to 1, indicating the strength and direction of associations, where positive values reflect upregulation and negative values indicate downregulation. We used the cor.test() function for correlation analysis and the p.adjust() function for multiple comparison corrections from the R stats package (version 4.3.0). This analysis identified significant correlations with adjusted p Identification of post-treatment drug transcriptomic perturbation data The gene expression changes induced by 35 FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs were extracted from the Library of Integrated Network and Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Chemical Perturbation database ( NCI, 2012 Todd Golub, 2021 NCI, 2012 Todd Golub, 2021 The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics catalogs gene expression profiles for cellular perturbagen molecules at different time points, doses, and cell lines using the L1000 assay. We obtained the LINCS data for the MCF7 breast cancer cell line because it serves as a prototypical hormone-responsive female cancer type for hypothesis generation and because it was the female cancer cell line with the most significant number of drugs screened at a 10 μM dose over 24 h, the most consistent criteria among the drugs analyzed. Comparison of drug gene signatures with microbiome host signatures The microbes and metabolites signatures we obtained from Spearman correlations were compared to LINCS-derived signatures for similarities using a Fisher's Exact test which calculates exact p p Bacterial culture and sample preparation for metabolomics L. crispatus G. vaginalis L. iners L. crispatus Reid, 1999 G. vaginalis Swidsinski et al., 2005 L. iners Petrova et al., 2017 2 Jimenez et al., 2023 Evans et al., 2009 http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82M8R Cell viability and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 The Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay was carried out to determine cell viability and the IC 50 2 2 p Data and code availability Supplementary Tables GSE139655 https://maayanlab.cloud/sigcom-lincs/#/Download http://dx.doi.org/10.21228/M82M8R https://github.com/Brubaker-Lab/Characterizing-the-Anti-Cancer-Potential-of-Vaginal-Microbes-and-Metabolites- Results Integrative analysis of vaginal microbiome and host gene expression In this study, we characterized the relationship between microbiome composition and RNA expression and the association between microbial metabolites and host vaginal epithelial RNA expression. We integrated metagenomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic data from a well-characterized cohort of HIV-negative women in the Partners PrEP trial to comprehensively profile microbial communities, metabolite production, and host gene expression, enabling detailed analysis of host-microbe interactions relevant to gynecologic health and disease. For vaginal microbiota composition and taxa, we performed Spearman correlation analysis between 51 measured microbes and 23,482 gene expression signatures from vaginal biopsies. The size of the coefficient determined the effect magnitude, while the sign indicated the proposed regulatory direction on gene expression ( Supplementary Tables S1 S2 p To further explore connections between vaginal metabolites and host gene expression patterns, we integrated vaginal metabolomics and vaginal epithelial transcriptomics data from 23 matched participants. To generate metabolite-RNA correlations, we calculated partial Spearman correlation coefficients between 99 metabolites and 23,482 host genes controlling for Lactobacillus p Linking vaginal epithelial and microbiome gene signatures to anti-gynecologic cancer drug-gene signatures Building upon the generated associations, we applied Fisher's exact test to compare gene expression profiles associated with vaginal microbes and metabolites to transcriptional changes induced by 35 chemotherapeutic agents, analyzing these relationships along two distinct dimensions ( Supplementary Tables S3 S4 Notably, our unsupervised clustering approach revealed a striking pattern where drugs with established similar modes of action consistently clustered together. For example, steroidal aromatase inhibitors like Exemestane, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like raloxifene, and selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) like Fulvestrant formed a distinct cluster in the heatmap ( Figures 2B 3A Figure 2 Identifying vaginal microbes with anti-cancer therapeutic potential.

Panels A and B show upregulated (red) and downregulated (blue) metabolites across various drugs with hierarchical clustering of values.

Identification of vaginal microbes with anti-cancer drug similarity based on gene signature alignment Our analysis revealed striking patterns of functional mimicry. For upregulated signature similarity, five compounds demonstrated exceptional statistical significance: Doxorubicin, Fulvestrant, Etoposide, Raloxifene, and Exemestane. The downregulation axis identified a partially overlapping set of high-significance compounds: Everolimus, Raloxifene, Fulvestrant, Lapatinib, and Rucaparib.

Most notably, five compounds—Doxorubicin, Fulvestrant, Exemestane, Etoposide, and Raloxifene—demonstrated exceptional significance for upregulated gene similarity ( Figure 3A Figure 3B The analysis identified over 40 vaginal metabolites with significant transcriptional parallels to 28 anti-cancer compounds (adjusted p Figures 3A B Supplementary Table S5 The three drugs showing the most consistent metabolite signature similarities—fulvestrant, raloxifene, and etoposide—represent distinct pharmacological classes ( Figure 3C National Institute of Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases, 2012 Carlson, 2005 Montecucco et al., 2015 Figure 3C Lactobacillus crispatus To validate our computational findings regarding microbiome-derived anti-cancer metabolites, we conducted targeted metabolomic profiling of cultured vaginal bacteria and performed cell viability assays using both endometrial and breast cancer cell lines. Previous research has established L. crispatus, L. iners G. vaginalis L. crispatus L. iners G. vaginalis Petrova et al., 2017 Jimenez et al., 2023 Castro et al., 2019 To explore which microbes were responsible for producing netabolites with anti-cancer potential, we cultured each microbe in suspension and analyzed their conditioned media using metabolomics. Our primary aim was to identify which vaginal microbes produce or consume the 28 metabolites with anti-cancer drug similarities identified in our previous analysis. Metabolic profiling revealed 597 metabolites produced or consumed across L. crispatus, L. iners G. vaginalis Figure 4A L. crispatus L. iners G. vaginalis Figure 4B L. iners' Figure 4 Metabolomics of cultured bacteria.

Panel A shows a heatmap of key metabolites produced or consumed by L. iners, L. crispatus, and G. vaginalis, color-coded from blue to red. Panel B presents bar plots depicting log2 fold changes of cytosine and taurine across the bacteria, with notable variations in L. iners and G. vaginalis. Panel C contains bar graphs displaying cell viability in HEC1A and MCF7 cells treated with cisplatin and varying taurine concentrations, indicating significant differences marked by asterisks. To test direct anti-cancer activity of these metabolites, we evaluated taurine and cytosine in cell viability assays using MCF7 cells (the breast cancer line used for LINCS database gene signature generation), HES cells (endometrial stromal cell line), and HEC1A cells (an endometrial cancer line). We selected taurine and cytosine for further investigation based on two compelling factors: our metabolomic findings and existing literature. Previous research has demonstrated taurine's anti-cancer properties in breast cancer models ( Zhang et al., 2015 Shennan and Thomson, 2007 Li et al., 2022 Kim et al., 2024 Ligasová et al., 2023 Christensen et al., 2010 L. crispatus We treated all cell lines with taurine and cytosine at concentrations ranging from 1 to 300 μM for 24 h, using Cisplatin as a positive control. Cell viability was quantified using the CCK8 assay. Taurine demonstrated remarkable tissue and malignancy selectivity in our cellular assays. While having no detectable effect on normal HES endometrial stromal cells ( Supplementary Table S6 p Figure 4C L. crispatus Supplementary Table S6 Discussion We developed the Pharmacobiome as a novel systems biology approach to characterize microbes and microbial products' function relative to known drugs. This methodology enables systematic comparison between microbial effects and established pharmaceuticals, opening new avenues for therapeutic discovery. To explore this concept, we integrated vaginal microbiome multi-omics data from HIV-negative study participants with in vitro Our analysis revealed Lactobacillus L. iners L. crispatus Gardnerella Lactobacillus Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus iners Lactobacillus jensenii Lactobacillus Gardnerella Ravel et al., 2011 Understanding the natural diversity of vaginal microbiota is crucial for interpreting our findings. Research has demonstrated that Gardnerella vaginalis G. vaginalis Hickey and Forney, 2014 G. vaginalis Himschoot et al., 2025 Cleveland Clinic, 2021 G. vaginalis Cleveland Clinic, 2021 G. vaginalis Abou Chacra et al., 2022 G. vaginalis Hickey and Forney, 2014 Cleveland Clinic, 2021 Our comprehensive analysis identified 28 metabolites, and three microbes, L. crispatus, L. iners Gardnerell L. crispatus, L. iners G. vaginalis to determine which microbes produce anti-cancer metabolites L. crispatus G. vaginalis The convergence of our computational and experimental bacterial metabolomics analysis pointed toward L. crispatus-produced Santulli et al., 2023 Ripps and Shen, 2012 Jong et al., 2021 Baliou et al., 2021 Seidel et al., 2019 In contrast, circulating taurine levels are substantially lower, with concentrations ranging from 7 to 200 μM in plasma and whole blood, variations that depend on an individual's feeding state and metabolic condition ( Santulli et al., 2023 While taurine is essential in various physiological functions like redox balance and cell volume regulation, our findings suggest that elevated concentrations may disrupt cell metabolism and growth, triggering protective responses or promoting cell death ( Centeno et al., 2024 Our analysis further reveals that L. crispatus L. crispatus Raloxifen acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that differentially activates or blocks estrogenic pathways in a tissue-specific manner. Breast tissue binds to estrogen receptors competitively, preventing estrogen from stimulating cancer cell growth while preserving beneficial estrogenic effects in bone tissue ( National Institute of Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases, 2012 Fulvestrant functions as a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) that binds to estrogen receptors in cancer cells, causing their destabilization and subsequent degradation. This process ultimately blocks estrogen's ability to promote cancer cell proliferation by eliminating the receptors themselves rather than simply blocking them ( Nathan and Schmid, 2017 Exemestane belongs to the aromatase inhibitor class, working by irreversibly binding to and inactivating the aromatase enzyme. This enzyme is essential for converting androgens into estrogen, and its inhibition reduces estrogen levels in peripheral tissues, thereby slowing the growth of estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells ( Buzdar, 2000 Etoposide works through dual mechanisms, combining direct cytotoxicity with immune system activation. It forms complexes with topoisomerase II and DNA, causing unrepairable double-stranded breaks that prevent mitosis and trigger cell death ( Zhang et al., 2021 Dunphy et al., 2018 Johnson et al., 2014 Mouw et al., 2017 The gene expression similarities between L. crispatus Mirmonsef et al., 2015 Li et al., 2018 O'Hanlon et al., 2013 O'Hanlon et al., 2013 2019 O'Hanlon et al., 2013 Li et al., 2018 O'Hanlon et al., 2013 r 2 Mirmonsef et al., 2015 2016 Li et al., 2018 L. crispatus Beyond maintaining vaginal acidity, Lactobacillus Lactobacillus reuteri Engevik et al., 2021 Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lcr35 + + + regs Ding et al., 2017 Recent research has identified specific anti-cancer metabolites produced by lactobacilli.

Further investigations are necessary to ascertain the efficacy and safety profiles of these vaginal microbiome-derived molecules for gynecologic cancer treatment ( Han et al., 2023 In conclusion, our study shows that commensal microbes like Lactobacillus crispatu The applications of microbial products for cancer therapy extend far beyond the specific bacteria and metabolites discussed in this study. The field has massive potential for future growth and innovation. Our Pharmacobiome analysis provides a robust framework for discovering novel therapeutic strategies potentially applicable to gynecologic cancers and other conditions. This approach is based on profiling the therapeutic actions of human microbiome communities. By understanding and harnessing the natural anti-cancer properties of the vaginal microbiome, we may develop more targeted, better-tolerated therapies that work with the body's natural defenses rather than against them. Our results indicate that specific components of the vaginal microbiome have the potential to modulate host responses that are relevant to cancer therapy. The observation highlights the need for additional experimental and translational studies to fully assess the potential for clinical application. Future directions While our study provides foundational insights into the therapeutic potential of L. crispatus in vitro Moving forward, our research will focus on two major areas to support clinical translation. First, a comprehensive pharmacokinetic and systemic safety profiling is essential. Although, our in vitro in vivo Then, we will develop translational models that recapitulate host-microbe interactions and capable of replicating the complexity of human tissue-microbiome crosstalk. To address this, we propose three-dimensional vaginal organoids co-cultured with L. crispatus 2 L. crispatus L. iners in vivo ex vivo By integrating these approaches, we aim to advance microbiome-derived metabolites from bench to bedside, ensuring efficacy and safety in the complex landscape of human physiology.
