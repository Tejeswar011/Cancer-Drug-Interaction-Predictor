In this case report, we describe two patients with acute ascending aortic syndromes who were treated endovascular with a Gore TAG Thoracic Branch Endoprosthesis (W. L. Gore & Associates) in zone 0.

For the ascending aorta, open surgery remains the golden standard with excellent short and long-term outcomes. 1 2 , 3 4 , 5 Case report Case 1 An 80-year-old man with a comprehensive oncological history (metastasized prostatic cancer to the liver and lungs and sigmoid carcinoma) was presented to one of our referring hospitals with acute chest pain. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed an acute, local type A aortic dissection ( Fig 1 A F Fig 1 C Fig 1 (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) The patient was scheduled in the hybrid operating room the next day for a multidisciplinary, endovascular intervention. We started with a bypass from the right to the left common carotid artery. The left subclavian artery (LSA) was not revascularized, because both vertebral arteries had a similar diameter. A Gore TBE endograft was then implanted in zone 0 with the side branch into the brachiocephalic trunk (BCT). The TBE endograft covered the left common carotid artery and LSA and landed distally in zone 4. Last, the TBE endograft was extended proximally with a Gore TAG endograft just up to the sinotubular junction (STJ). All CTA measurements were performed using Endosize software (Therenva). We aimed for 0% to 10% oversizing. Case 2 A 77-year-old woman, with no relevant cardiovascular medical history, presented with chest pain to a referring hospital. CTA showed an acute, local, type A aortic dissection with an intimal defect (entry) in the ascending aorta and thrombosed false lumen ( Fig 2 A F Fig 2 (A B) (C) (D) (E) (F) Our surgical plan was almost identical to our previous case; however, because the vertebral artery originated from the arch, we revascularized the LSA. First a carotid-carotid-subclavian bypass was performed, followed by implantation of a Gore TBE endograft in zone 0 with the side branch into the BCT and proximal extension to the STJ with a Gore TAG endograft. All CTA measurements were again made with the Endosize software (Therenva). We aimed for 0% to 10% oversizing. Operative procedure Case 1 The patient was scheduled in the hybrid operating room and was treated by our complex aortic team. First, a right-to-left carotid bypass was performed with the use of an 8-mm ringed vascular graft. The origin of the left common carotid artery was ligated. Access for the TBE endograft was obtained percutaneously in the right femoral artery (Gore Dryseal sheath 24F) and preclosure devices were deployed (Perclose ProGlide system, Abbott Vascular). The left femoral artery was used for an angiography catheter (7F sheath). Surgical cutdown of the right brachial artery was performed to accommodate the through-and-through wire for later implantation of the side branch into the BCT. The main device was then advanced over a stiff wire (Lunderquist, Cook Medical) and positioned in the ascending aorta. Blood pressure was temporary lowered by inferior caval vein occlusion with a Reliant balloon (Medtronic) without rapid pacing. After deployment of the TBE endograft in zone 0 (37 mm in diameter, 150 mm long, 12 mm portal diameter), which distally landed in zone 4, a side branch (15 mm) was deployed in the BCT. The Lunderquist wire was then changed for a Safari 2 Fig 1 D A perioperative angiogram showed no endoleak and patent coronary arteries. In the absence of any observed endoleak, postdeployment ballooning was not performed, except for the side branch, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions for use. The systolic blood pressure in the left arm was 40 mm Hg lower than in the right arm. The patient experienced no limitations and had no complaints regarding his left arm. A postoperative CTA showed a small endoleak originating from the branch in the BCT. The patient was discharged 1 day after the procedure and scheduled for a second procedure to implant a 14 × 29 mm covered endograft (BeGraft, Bentley InnoMed) in the BCT 2 weeks later. The procedure was uncomplicated. A direct postoperative CTA revealed no endoleak ( Fig 1 E F Case 2 The procedure was similar to the first case, except that we also revascularized the LSA. The following surgical steps are similar to our first case: access the TBE endograft through the right groin with preclosure devices. A through-and-through wire was placed in the right brachial artery and right femoral artery, and a Gore TBE endograft was deployed in zone 0 (31 mm in diameter, 150 mm long, 12 mm portal diameter) and distally landed in zone 4, with its side branch (15-mm device diameter for a 12-mm portal) into the BCT and proximal extension with a Gore TAG endograft (34 mm in diameter, 100 mm long) in the ascending aorta. The outer curve length from the STJ until the BCT was 10.2 cm ( Fig 2 D Fig 2 E F Discussion In this case report, we described the use of the TBE endograft combined with proximal extension with a Gore TAG endograft in two patients with acute aortic syndrome of the ascending aorta. It is a matter of debate whether this is truly a type A aortic dissection. The aortic layers are however clearly dissected. Especially in the first patient, we can appreciate that an earlier CTA did not show any sign of a penetrating ulcer or other atherosclerotic defects ( Fig 1 C Fig 2 A B Both patients were initially deemed unsuitable for (open) surgical repair. Probably owing to the local nature of the defect or dissection, they both survived the hyperacute phase and could be scheduled for a later complex endovascular repair. The postoperative course was uneventful for both patients and no neurological deficits developed. The TBE endograft by Gore became commercially available in Europe since 2024 and was approved in the United States in 2022. Several American groups have reported their results, of which most endografts were implanted in zone 2 and some in zone 0 or 1. 6 7 8 9 10 6 , 7 5 Both our patients had an intimal defect in the ascending aorta with a limited dissection of the aortic layers. This specific pathology likely resembles the more benign course of an IMH, instead of a full-blown DeBakey type 1 aortic dissection. In the most current European and American guidelines, early surgery for an IMH of the ascending aorta is recommended whenever there are high-risk features present. 1 11 Because open surgery remains the first choice of treatment in acute ascending aortic pathologies, 1 5 The endograft is available with two portal sizes: an 8-mm and a 12-mm portal for the side branch. After implantation of this endograft in the aortic arch, the length of the STJ to the portal of the TBE endograft is important for the feasibility of proximal extension with another stent graft. Most commercially available endografts have a minimum length of 10 cm, which is often longer than the ascending aorta. Therefore, the technique described in this case report is promising, but only applicable in patients with an elongated aorta. The availability of shorter stents will make this technique widely applicable in patients with ascending or aortic arch pathology, which will hopefully come with the results of ARISE. 12 Conclusions In selected patients, hybrid endovascular treatment of an acute, local type A aortic dissection in carefully selected patients who are deemed unsuitable for open surgery is feasible with the use of a single branched thoracic device combined with proximal extension with a conventional endograft. This technique is currently particularly suitable for patients with a longer ascending aorta. Further development of shorter stents will make this technique more widely applicable. Funding None.
