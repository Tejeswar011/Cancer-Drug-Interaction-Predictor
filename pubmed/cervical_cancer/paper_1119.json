Introduction Cancer remains a leading global health issue and has been the leading cause of death in Taiwan for over four decades. In recent years, ethnomedicines have gained growing attention as complementary therapies in cancer treatment. However, systematic investigations linking traditional medicinal practices with cancer remain limited. This study aims to explore the types, preparation methods, and parts used of anticancer ethnomedicines and cancer types across different regions in Taiwan through ethnobotanical surveys, and to preserve and transmit traditional knowledge. Methods Data were collected through questionnaire-based interviews with 210 participants, sampled proportionally by region, age, gender, and education based on national demographics. Results Chi-squared tests showed that only education level significantly influenced the number of anticancer ethnomedicines mentioned ( p Discussion In summary, the results of this study provide a valuable foundation for future anticancer research, serving as a priority focus for further investigation into the underlying mechanisms of anticancer activity. Moreover, this research supports the scientific development and potential drug discovery of ethnomedicines in modern cancer treatment, contributing to the integration of traditional knowledge with contemporary biomedical approaches. anticancer ethnomedicine Asteraceae cancer Taiwan traditional medicine questionnaire The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

In general, natural products, spiritual therapies and operational therapies were used to prevent, diagnose or treat physical and mental health problems of traditional medicine. A variety of traditional medical practices are believed to have a special effect on diseases even though traditional medicine lacks scientific basis and empirical evidence. India’s Āyurveda, Greece and Arabias’ Unani, China’s acupuncture, South Africa’s Muti and West Africa’s Ifá are well-known traditional medicines. Among them, India’s Āyurveda is a traditional medical treatment consisting of medicinal plants, massage and yoga therapy. It is noteworthy that traditional medicine was collected in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) in 2018, suggesting that it is of increasing importance in the global healthcare system. Humans have maintained a close relationship with plants. In addition to using plants as food sources, humans have also been using plants to treat diseases and maintain health. Archaeological evidence shows that the four ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt, ancient China, and ancient India have a large number of records on the use of various medicinal plants ( Diamond, 1997 Fuller et al., 2014  Ochwang’i et al. (2014) Spathodea campanulata S. campanulata Ochwang’i et al., 2014 S. campanulata Świątek et al. (2022) Cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, and has been the leading cause of death in Taiwan for 42 consecutive years. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) report provides that there were 20 million new cancer cases and 9.7 million deaths globally, with lung and breast cancer being most common in 2022. According to the report provided by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan, the 10 most common types of cancer were lung, liver, colorectal, breast, prostate, oral, pancreatic, stomach, esophageal and ovarian cancer in 2023. Due to the efforts of various countries in cancer prevention, treatment, and long-term care, cancer has become a major global public health issue and an economic burden. In general, traditional medicine is often used to relieve the symptoms caused by medication or improve treatment efficacy during cancer treatment ( Lo et al., 2012 Kalender et al., 2014 Li et al., 2017 Park et al., 2019 Radha Abbas Hasoon and Jawad Kadhim, 2021 Panax ginseng Ophiopogon japonicus Schisandra chinensis Lo et al., 2012 Kalender et al., 2014 P. ginseng Li et al., 2017 Park et al., 2019 Radha Abbas Hasoon and Jawad Kadhim, 2021 The knowledge and practices of traditional medicines that have been transmitted and hybridized for thousands of years within the cultures and life systems of Han Chinese, indigenous people and foreign peoples in Taiwan that offers Taiwan’s unique traditional medical knowledge. Since small territory and high population density of Taiwan, high degree of consistency achieved regarding the efficacy of the plants among respondents from the four major administrative regions of northern, central, southern and eastern Taiwan. Taiwan has a well-developed communication and transportation system, which makes it easy to collect questionnaire data from respondents all over the country and increases the response rate of the questionnaire. There is a growing awareness of participation in social issues and public policy of Taiwanese people that will be more than willing to participate in questionnaire surveys and provide opinions and suggestions, further increasing the response rate of the questionnaire. Mandarin is Taiwan’s official language and is spoken by nearly 96.9% of Taiwan’s population. Therefore, respondents can be communicated better and answer to the questionnaire, thereby improving data accuracy. Based on the above reasons, conducting questionnaire surveys in Taiwan will be more advantageous than in other countries. The major purpose of this study was to systematically investigate and gain further understanding of the traditional medicines and their applications in the treatment or prevention of cancers in Taiwan. The results of this study can be used to further clarify the plant resources, knowledge and culture in a certain area and even provide useful information for researchers to explore the mechanism of anticancer activity in future and promote the development of new drugs and the traditional Chinese medicine industry. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Introduction of study area Taiwan is an island in East Asia, has an area of approximately 36,000 km 2 Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Four political geographies of Taiwan. Map of Taiwan divided into four regions: Northern, Central, Southern, and Eastern, with latitude and longitude markers. The Tropic of Cancer is indicated. A compass rose and scale bar are included. 2.2 Field work and data collection The field investigation and data collection for this study was carried out between December 2022 and December 2023 by using semi-structured questionnaire to collect data from a total of 272 respondents. However, due to incomplete data, such as the areas of residence, gender, age, education or occupation not filled, from some respondents, only 210 respondents were ultimately included in the analysis. The questionnaire was divided into two parts: basic information and ethnobotanical information. The basic information of the respondents included the areas of residence, gender, age, education and occupation, while the ethnobotanical information covered the ethnomedicine name, part of use, preparation method, and type of cancer treatment. According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior of Taiwan, the proportions of the population over 20 years old in the four major administrative regions are 46.13%, 24.70%, 26.87% and 2.3%, respectively. In each region, the gender ratio is approximately 1:1, with a significant proportion of the population being middle-aged. Additionally, statistics indicate that approximately 40% of Taiwanese graduates have a university degree or above (including bachelor, master and doctorate degrees). Therefore, this study intends to conduct a survey based on the aforementioned population distribution ratios. In addition to collecting respondents based on the above conditions, in order to avoid bias in the survey results caused by specific occupations, this study also collected an appropriate number of questionnaires from all walks of life. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee Ⅱ of the China Medical University and Hospital, Protocol No. CMUH111-REC2-191, and the study was conducted on ethnic groups aged 20 years or older. Before data collection, each respondent was given a detailed explanation of the study content. Since multiple ethnomedicines may correspond to the same local name, relevant online images were immediately searched for and presented to the respondent for confirmation when an ethnomedicine was mentioned, in order to avoid misrecording the ethnomedicine. After the interview, the respondent confirmed that the content of the interview was correct and signed an informed consent form. Respondents were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason, and that all steps of the study, including the principles of protection, informed consent, respect for privacy, and reciprocity and feedback, were conducting according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the Code of Ethics of the International Society of Ethnobiology (ISE). 2.3 Biological classification of traditional anticancer medicines collected In this study, the collected Taiwan anticancer ethnomedicines were biologically classified according to the Taxonomy by Cavalier-Smith and the World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP). The Taiwan anticancer ethnomedicines organs mentioned by the respondents were confirmed by Prof. Shyh-Shyun Huang of the China Medical University. The scientific names and family names used were based on the World Flora Online (WFO), the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), and the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN). 2.4 Electronic database survey This study searched PubMed based on the scientific name of the anticancer ethnomedicines and the keyword cancer or tumor, and obtained a collection of information related to the top ten anticancer ethnomedicines in research studies on the types of cancers treated. 2.5 Data analysis In this study, the results of the ethnobotanical data were analyzed using descriptive statistics which includes percentage calculation and informant consensus factor (ICF). ICF value is used to objectively assess the level of agreement on conventional treatment regimens for different cancer types, and its magnitude is directly proportional to the level of agreement on the therapeutic agents chosen by the respondents for the treatment of a specific cancer type. The following are the formulae for calculating ICF values: ICF =  N ur − N t N ur − 1 ur t ur 3 Results 3.1 Characteristics of respondents In order to investigate anticancer ethnomedicine in Taiwan, this study conducted a random questionnaire survey among 210 respondents. According to the Human Subjects Research Act promulgated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of the Executive Yuan of Taiwan, where the subject has been judicially declared to be of limited legal capacity (over 7 years old but under 20 years old) or under assistance, consent shall be obtained from both the individual and their legal representative or assistant. Therefore, the subjects of this study are people over 20 years old. Taiwan is divided into four major administrative regions: northern, central, southern, and eastern. The proportions of the population over 20 years old in these four administrative regions are 46.13%, 24.70%, 26.87% and 2.3% respectively. Therefore, this study is also approximately conducted a questionnaire survey on the population distribution ratio ( Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 TABLE 1 Informant mentioned anticancer ethnomedicine species characteristics.

According to the biological classification method proposed by Cavalier-Smith, organisms can be divided into seven kingdoms: Animalia, Protozoa, Fungi, Plantae, Chromista, Bacteria and Archaea. Among the 159 anticancer ethnomedicines in this study, 146 are distributed in Plantae (91.82%), 8 in Animalia (5.03%), 4 in Fungi (2.52%), and 1 in Chromista (0.63%) ( Figure 2 Figure 3 FIGURE 2 Distribution of 159 anticancer ethnomedicines in kingdom. Pie chart depicting the proportions of different kingdom groups. The chart shows Plantae in purple as the largest section, followed by smaller sections of Animalia in red, Fungi in green, and Chromista in blue. FIGURE 3 Distribution of 146 anticancer medicinal plants in family. Bar chart showing the percentage distribution of various plant families. The Asteraceae family has the highest percentage, around 15%, followed by Lamiaceae and Fabaceae. The remaining families have significantly lower percentages. In traditional medicine, different parts used and preparation methods are used to treat diseases, such as leaves, roots, fruits, seeds or flowers of plants. In terms of preparation methods, decoction, crush or soaking are used. Therefore, investigating species parts used and preparation methods will help to rationally and effectively utilize these precious biological resources. According to biomorphological classification, 159 anticancer ethnomedicines can be classified into 95 herbaceous, 19 lianas, 19 trees, 13 shrubs, and 13 others (including animals, fungi and algae) ( Figure 4A Supplementary Table S1 Figure 4B Figure 5 Supplementary Table S1 FIGURE 4 Statistics of morphology and parts used of 159 anticancer ethnomedicines.

Chart B details the frequency of plant parts used, with \"Herba\" being most mentioned. Various plant morphologies are compared, including herbaceous, liana, tree, and shrub. FIGURE 5 Distribution of preparation methods of 159 anticancer ethnomedicines. Two preparation methods of the same plants were counted as two types, etc. Bar chart depicting the number of different preparation methods. Decoction is the most common, with nearly fifty occurrences. Other methods include tea, broth, dish, juice, raw, crush, soak, and honey maceration, each having decreasing frequencies. 3.3 Relationship between 159 anticancer ethnomedicines collected and frequency used in cancer treatment To date, clinical medicine has discovered more than hundreds of cancers. To clarify the relationship between Taiwan folk anticancer ethnomedicines and the types of cancer treated, this study analyzed the cancer type treated by 159 anticancer ethnomedicines collected. It was found that these anticancer ethnomedicines are used in the treatment of 26 different cancer types, such as liver, colorectal, and lung cancer. In order to analyze the frequency of use of 159 anticancer ethnomedicines collected in Taiwan, the study calculated the proportion of each anticancer ethnomedicine. The proportion is directly proportional to the frequency of use of the ethnomedicine to treat cancer. The results show that the top ten anticancer ethnomedicines are Taraxacum formosanum Scleromitrion diffusum Scutellaria barbata Zanthoxylum ailanthoides Prunella vulgaris Curcuma phaeocaulis Clinacanthus nutans Buthus martensii Gynura procumbens Rhus chinensis roxburghii Figure 6 Table 2 T. formosanum S diffusum S barbata S diffusum P vulgaris T formosanum T formosanum Z. ailanthoides P vulgaris S barbata B. martensii T formosanum P vulgaris Z ailanthoides C phaeocaulis C nutans T. formosanum FIGURE 6 The top ten anticancer ethnomedicines.

To explore the relationship between the traditionally used of the top ten anticancer ethnomedicines collected and documented researches, this study used PubMed to search for literature on these ethnomedicines across different cancer types. As shown in Supplementary Table S2 T. formosanum In recent years, traditional medicine has attracted much attention in the treatment of cancer. Ethnobotanical surveys can reveal the application experience of ethnic medicine in the treatment of various types of cancer. Generally speaking, quantitative analysis methods, such as the ICF, can be used to objectively assess the degree of consensus on traditional treatment options for different cancer types. The ICF value ranges from 0 to 1, and its size is related to the respondent’s opinion on the specific treatment. The degree of consensus on the selected treatment drug is directly proportional to the type of cancer. In order to understand the correlation between the collected anticancer ethnomedicines and cancer types, this study used the analysis ICF to understand the respondents’ consensus on the treatment of certain anticancer ethnomedicines in specific cancer types. The results show that in addition to prostate cancer and oral cancer, respondents have a high degree of consensus on the anticancer ethnomedicines used in the top ten cancers in Taiwan. In particular, breast, lung, colorectal, liver, and gastric cancer were mentioned extremely frequently ( Table 3 Table 3 Table 4 Supplementary Table S1 T. formosanum P. vulgaris S. barbata Supplementary Table S1 TABLE 3 Use reports (N ur t Taiwan incidence rank Cancer categories Use reports (N ur  a Number of species (N t  b Informant consensus factor (ICF) 1 Breast cancer 179 42 0.77 2 Lung cancer 196 54 0.73 3 Colorectal cancer 211 32 0.85 4 Prostate cancer 12 8 0.36 5 Liver cancer 315 57 0.82 6 Oral cancer 18 10 0.47 7 Uterine cancer 21 9 0.60 8 Thyroid cancer 26 6 0.80 9 Ovarian cancer 12 5 0.64 10 Gastric cancer 150 29 0.81 – Skin cancer 21 11 0.50 – Pancreatic cancer 17 5 0.75 – Lymphoma 84 14 0.84 – Cervical cancer 57 14 0.77 – Esophageal cancer 42 14 0.68 – Leukemia 22 11 0.52 – Nasopharyngeal cancer 18 10 0.47 – Renal cancer 10 7 0.33 – Bladder cancer 10 9 0.11 – Brain cancer 6 5 0.20 – Cholangiocarcinoma 3 2 0.50 – Splenic cancer 2 2 0.00 – Bone cancer 2 2 0.00 – Small intestine cancer 1 1 0.00 – Penile cancer 1 1 0.00 – Pelvic cancer 1 1 0.00  a The number of mentioned ethnomedicines of each cancer category.  b The number of different ethnomedicines mentioned in N ur ICF =  N ur − N t N ur − 1 TABLE 4 Top three of ethnomedicines mentioned were used for top ten cancers (incidence) in Taiwan.

Cancer also remained the top cause of death in Taiwan for the 42nd year last year. In recent years, ethnomedicines have garnered significant attention as adjunct therapies for cancer treatment worldwide. However, there is still a lack of systematic investigations into the relationship between ethnomedicines and cancer. Traditional medicine is a long-standing cultural practice deeply rooted in ethnic heritage. Although it often lacks sufficient scientific validation, its practical application demonstrates significant scientific value and potential. To protect and preserve the valuable traditional folk medicine culture of Taiwan, this study conducted a systematic and in-depth investigation into the types of anticancer ethnomedicines, the parts used, and their methods of application across various regions of Taiwan through ethnobotanical surveys. Based on biological taxonomy, this study found that the 159 anticancer ethnomedicines collected were mainly distributed in the herbal plants of the plant kingdom. Whole plants are primarily used for herbaceous species, while both whole plants and roots are common for climbers. For trees and shrubs, leaves are the most commonly used parts. Of the 146 medicinal plants were classified into 66 plant families using the WCVP system. The most represented families were Asteraceae (19 species), Lamiaceae (9 species), and Fabaceae (7 species). Asteraceae, the largest dicotyledon family with over 32,000 species worldwide ( Achika et al., 2014 Rolnik and Olas, 2021 Yuan et al., 2012 Rolnik and Olas, 2021 Chrysargyris, 2024 Wink, 2003 De Sousa et al., 2004 Stanojevic et al., 2010 De et al., 2011 Lin et al., 2012 Kamdem et al., 2013 Pop et al., 2013 Lewis, 2005 Boudjou et al., 2013 Del Carmen Millán-Linares et al., 2014 Giusti et al., 2017 This is the first ethnobotanical investigation focused on the use of traditional Taiwanese medicines in cancer treatment, incorporating responses from individuals of varying regions, genders, ages, education levels, and occupations. In the current study, 38.10% of respondents were male and 61.90% were female. The average number of anticancer ethnomedicines mentioned was 6.08 ± 0.41 for males and 5.33 ± 0.28 for females. Despite this apparent difference, statistical analysis using the Chi-squared test showed that the result was not statistically significant ( p Quinlan and Quinlan (2007) Voeks and Leony (2004) Lozada et al.

(2003) T formosanum This study employed the ICF to assess the level of agreement among respondents regarding the ethnomedicinal treatments used for various types of cancer. Except for prostate and oral cancers, there was a high degree of consensus on treatments for the top ten most prevalent cancers in Taiwan, particularly breast, lung, colorectal, liver, and stomach cancers, which were mentioned most frequently. These findings suggest that traditional medicine in Taiwan has developed substantial collective knowledge and agreement in managing several common cancer types. Prostate and oral cancers showed lower levels of consensus in this study. In Taiwan, about 80% of prostate cancer cases are localized, with treatment largely based on cancer stage, ranging from active surveillance to surgery or other therapies ( Mazhar and Waxman, 2002 Sekhoacha et al., 2022 Montero and Patel, 2015 In summary, this study investigates the ethnomedicines used in Taiwan for cancer treatment and their methods of use. In addition to finding out the application experiences of ethnomedicines in treating various types of cancer through ethnobotanical surveys, it also plays a vital role in enhancing the understanding, preservation, and transmission of Taiwan’s rich traditional medical practices and natural resources. The study further examines the relationship between traditional folk knowledge and modern scientific research. This result highlights the scientific value of traditional medicine in cancer treatment, providing a valuable foundation for future anticancer research, serving as a priority focus for further investigation into anticancer mechanisms and supporting the scientific advancement and drug development of ethnomedicines for cancer treatment.
