Methods Patients with LA-ESCC who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection at West China Hospital between January 2018 and December 2023 were screened and enrolled. Patients were categorized into early relapse (≤ 6 months) and late relapse (> 6 months) groups based on the interval from surgery to relapse. Results A total of 183 LA-ESCC patients who received neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical resection were included, with 79 experiencing early relapse and 104 experiencing late relapse. Logistic regression analysis showed that postoperative TNM stage III-IV, ypN + stage, R1 resection, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PI), and absence of postoperative adjuvant therapy were risk factors for early relapse ( p p p p p p Conclusion R1 resection is an independent risk factor for rapid postoperative relapse in LA-ESCC patients following neoadjuvant therapy. Furthermore, LVI significantly affects patients survival outcomes, and early relapse was strongly associated with reduced overall survival (OS).

These patients tend to have more aggressive biological behavior [ 14 15 Therefore, thoroughly investigating the risk factors and survival determinants associated with rapid postoperative relapse in patients with LA-ESCC, as well as establishing effective prediction or risk assessment models, has become a critical issue that urgently needs to be addressed in the clinical management of LA-ESCC. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors related to early relapse following neoadjuvant therapy in LA-ESCC patients, aiming to provide evidence for optimizing postoperative management and improving patient outcomes. Methods Study population Patients with LA-ESCC who underwent surgery following neoadjuvant therapy were included in a single-centre cohort analysis. The study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines and received approval from the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital, Sichuan University (2024–2390), in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Clinical data from ESCC patients who underwent surgical resection at the Cancer Centre of West China Hospital, Sichuan University, between January 2018 and December 2023 were collected. Patients with indications for neoadjuvant therapy (cT2N + M0 or cT3-4aN0-3M0), as assessed according to the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO), were included in the study. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age 18–80 years; (2) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) score of 0–1; (3) pathological biopsy confirming ESCC; (4) receipt of 2–4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy; (5) underwent radical esophagectomy for ESCC. Exclusion criteria were: (1) coexistence of other tumor histologies, including small cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma; (2) death without relapse within 3 months; (3) incomplete clinical follow-up data; (4) no relapse observed. Incomplete data were defined as loss to follow-up without an event (relapse or death) within 6 months or incomplete medical records of key data. Treatment Treatment decisions included neoadjuvant therapeutic strategies, surgical approaches, and adjuvant therapies, all of which were discussed by the multidisciplinary team to develop individualized treatment plans. Notably, the selection of these treatment options was independent of the study’s design and conduct. The neoadjuvant regimen comprised concurrent radiotherapy: platinum-based chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy (following the CROSS and NEOCRTEC5010 study protocols) [ 7 8 16 Assessment of treatment response and staging diagnosis is performed using pre- and post-neoadjuvant therapy imaging, including computed tomography (CT), upper gastrointestinal barium swallow, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT). Clinical T staging primarily relies on enhanced CT to evaluate the cervical, thoracic, and abdominal regions. Chest and abdominal MRI serve as supplementary evaluation methods. For N staging, further assessment is conducted with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). M staging diagnosis often utilizes PET-CT for additional support. Analysis of surgical specimens includes evaluation of tumor size, surgical margins, degree of differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, lymph node response, the extent and number of lymphadenectomies, the number and percentage of regionally positive lymph nodes, and tumor regression scores (TRS). Follow-up Imaging examinations and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are routinely performed postoperatively every three months for two years, followed by every six months until five years post-surgery. In some cases, the frequency of follow-up may be increased in real-time based on clinical symptoms. The site of recurrence is determined based on CT or MRI results, endoscopic examination (with endoscopic ultrasound performed if necessary), and tissue biopsy. When clinical findings are suggestive of distant metastasis or when CT evaluation is challenging, PET-CT may be used in conjunction. Follow-up data is recorded in the clinical case electronic system for review, and any missing or uncertain information may be obtained through telephone interviews with patients, their families, or attending physicians. Outcome measures Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging was performed according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) 8th edition, assessing Primary Tumor, Regional Lymph Node, and Distant Metastatic Lesions. Response to treatment was evaluated based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Soft Tissue Tumors (RECIST) definition of TRS and the American Society of Pathology (ASCP) TRG, which describe the pathological response of the tumor to neoadjuvant therapy [ 17 18 Statistical methods Statistical analyses were conducted using R software version 4.1.2 ( http://www.r-project.org Result Baseline characteristics A total of 689 esophageal cancer patients were collected after neoadjuvant therapy for EC. Of these, 626 cases (90.9%) were identified as ESCC patients. Twenty-nine cases (4.6%) with incomplete data were excluded, resulting in 597 eligible cases (95.4%). Among these, 183 cases (30.7%) experienced recurrence. Of the recurrent cases, 79 (43.2%) were early relapses and 104 (56.8%) were late relapses. The enrollment flow chart is shown in Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Flow chart of patient screening. ESCC, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma The demographic characteristics of the two groups (age, gender, smoking history, drinking history, weight) were balanced. Compared to the late relapse group, the early relapse group had a higher proportion of postoperative TNM stage III/IV, ypN+, R1 margins, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PI) cases ( p 1  Table 1 Comparison of clinical data between the early relapse group (≤ 6 months)and the later relapse group (> 6 months) Characteristics Patients, No. (%) P early relapse group ( n late relapse group ( n Age 0.145 ≤ 60 39 (49.4) 59 (37.5) > 60 40 (50.6) 65 (62.5) Gender 0.797 Male 68 (86.1) 92 (88.5) Female 11(13.9) 12 (11.5) Smoking 0.891 No 29(36.7) 46(34.6) Yes 50 (63.3) 68 (65.4) Alcohol 0.682 No 29 (36.7) 24 (22.7) Yes 50 (63.3) 70 (67.3) BMI 0.439 normal 43 (54.4) 61 (58.7) abnormal 18 (45.6) 16 (41.3) Primary site 0.502 Upper 11 (13.9) 10 (9.6) Middle/Lower 68 (86.1) 94 (90.4) Tumor length (mean (SD)) 5.80 (2.22) 5.21 (1.98) 0.061 cTNM stage 0.666 II 6 (7.6) 11 (10.6) III/IV 73 (92.4) 93 (89.4) cT stage 0.271 T2 7 (8.9) 4 (3.8) T3/4 72 (91.1) 100 (96.2) N stage 0.274 N0 7 (8.9) 16 (15.4) N+ 72 (91.1) 88 (84.6) Type of neoadjuvant treatment 0.469 nCRT 49 (62.0) 71 (68.3) nICT 30 (38.0) 33 (31.7) Number of lymph node dissections (mean (SD)) 23.65 (10.28) 23.08 (9.50) 0.699 ypTNM stage 0.038 Ⅰ/II 28 (35.4) 54 (51.9) III/IV 51 (64.6) 50 (48.1) ypT stage 0.070 T0/1/2 31 (39.2) 56 (53.8) T3/4 48 (60.8) 48 (46.2) ypN stage 0.016 N0 26 (32.9) 54 (51.9) N+ 53 (67.1) 50 (48.1) TRS 0.594 0 25 (31.6) 38 (36.5) 1/2/3 54 (68.4) 66 (63.5) Lymph node reaction 0.906 No 67(84.8) 90(86.5) Yes 12 (15.2) 14 (13.5) Differentiation level 1.000 well 27 (34.2) 36 (34.6) worse 52 (65.8) 68 (65.4) Resection Margin < 0.001 R0 58 (73.4) 97 (93.3) R1 21(26.6) 7(6.7) Lymphovascular invasion 0.017 negative 46 (58.2) 79 (76.0) positive 33 (41.8) 25 (24.0) Perineural invasion 0.002 negative 43 (54.4) 80 (76.9) positive 36 (45.6) 24 (23.1) Adjuvant treatment 0.025 yes 41(51.9) 72(69.2) no 38 (48.1) 32 (30.8) Locoregional rucurrence 0.847 no 39(49.4) 54(51.9) yes 40 (50.6) 50 (48.1) Distant metastasis 0.462 no 18(22.8) 18(17.3) yes 61 (77.2) 86 (82.7) Statu 0.048 death 65 (82.3) 71 (68.3) live 14(17.7) 23(31.7) nICT nCRT TNM TRS Risk factors for early relapse Univariable logistic regression analysis showed that postoperative pathological TNM stage III/IV, ypN+, R1 resection, LVI, PI, and lack of adjuvant therapy were risk factors for early relapse in patients.

A B C Discussion In this retrospective cohort study, we systematically examined the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors linked to postoperative early relapse (≤ 6 months) in patients with LA-ESCC who underwent neoadjuvant therapy. Of the 597 patients included, early relapse occurred in 13.2% (79 cases), which is consistent with previously reported rates in international studies (approximately 10%−13%) [ 19 20 22 23 24 25 26 24 27 29 30 31 32 Research limitations This study has several limitations. Firstly, as a retrospective, single-center study, despite the considerable overall sample size, the subset of patients experiencing early recurrence remained limited. This small subgroup affected statistical analyses, resulting in wide confidence intervals, which could introduce bias and limit the interpretability of results. To overcome this, future multicenter studies with larger patient cohorts and extended follow-up durations are warranted. Additionally, potential confounding factors, such as molecular biomarkers and the reliance on imaging modalities rather than pathological confirmation to detect recurrences, may affect the accuracy of recurrence identification. Future research incorporating advanced techniques like liquid biopsy (e.g., circulating tumor DNA) could enhance the accuracy of early relapse prediction and facilitate personalized postoperative management for high-risk LA-ESCC patients. Conclusion R1 resection is an independent risk factor for rapid postoperative relapse in LA-ESCC patients following neoadjuvant therapy. Furthermore, LVI significantly affects patients survival outcomes, and early relapse was strongly associated with reduced overall survival (OS).
