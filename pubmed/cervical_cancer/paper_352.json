More than 95% of cases are pathologically characterized by the cytoplasmic accumulation of hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Multiple mouse models with TDP-43 accumulation have been developed, however, whether they recapitulate molecular features of ALS pathology is unclear. Given the lack of curative treatment for ALS, there is an urgent need to identify the precise biological processes contributing to disease pathogenesis for the development of effective therapeutic treatments. Thus, in this study we employed label-based untargeted proteomics to characterize the ALS proteome and related biological processes in the spinal cord and brain of TDP-43 Q331K Q331K Keywords Motor neurone disease Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Immune-mediated pathology Mitochondrial dysfunction Neurodegeneration TMT-proteomics Subject terms Motor neuron disease Immunology Proteomics National Health and Medical Research Council GNT2007912 NHMRC-AMED 2022 Dementia Collaborative Research GNT2022203 Alzheimer’s Association grant AARF1020292 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Limited 2025 Introduction Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a debilitating and fatal neurodegenerative disease, with an increasing incidence of 6 per 100,000 people worldwide 1 4 5 9 TARDBP 10 11 Strikingly, 90% of sporadic ALS cases show TDP-43 pathology in the affected brain and spinal cord regions, irrespective of a genetic mutation in TDP-43 8 12 8 8 Q331K 13 12 The pathophysiology of ALS is highly complex and multifactorial 5 11 9 Q331K Q331K Materials and methods Human postmortem tissues The use of postmortem human tissue was approved by The University of Melbourne Human research ethics committee. Human brain and spinal cord tissue was obtained from the Victorian Brain Bank, in part funded by The Florey, Fight Parkinson’s, FightMND, Ian and Maria Cootes and One More Night for Tania’ (Parkville, Victoria, Australia). The motor cortex, cervical, thoracic and lumbar tissue were analyzed from 5 control and 10 sporadic ALS cases.

Female transgenic mice expressing human TDP-43 Q331K 13 Q331K Proteomics Brain and spinal cord samples were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (5% w/v sodium dodecyl sulphate, 20% SDS, 100 mM HEPES, pH 8.5), heated at 95 °C for 10 min and then probe-sonicated before measuring protein concentrations using a BCA kit. The lysed samples were denatured and alkylated by adding tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride and 2-chloroacetamide to a final concentration of 10 mM and 40 mM, respectively, and the mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 15 min. Samples were acidified by adding 12% phosphoric acid at 1:10 until pH reached around 2. The proteins were trapped using S-Trap mini columns (Profiti, Farmingdale NY), and S-Trap binding buffer (100 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate) at a buffer to protein ratio of 7:1 and centrifuged at 1500 x g 15 Q331K 14 Data analysis Pre-processing: TMT-analyst https://analyst-suites.org/apps/tmt-analyst/ 16 18 Differential expression analysis: 19 1 Enrichment analysis: 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 2 3 Meta-analysis: 28 2 29 32 21 Table 2 Summary of studies used in the mouse proteomics meta-analysis.

( A Q331K B C D F Q331K D E F G Q331K H I J K J K Principal component analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) on all proteins demonstrated distinct separation of genotypes and tissue types, indicating differential proteomic responses (Fig. 1 C 1 E and 1 1 Q331K Q331K 1 G To gain insight into the function of these deregulated proteins we performed Over Representation Analysis (ORA) (Fig. 1 1 Next, using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) we examined the top up- and down-regulated processes in the entire protein set (F i 1 2 2 2 1 1 Overlapping responses across human tissues affected by ALS To examine whether our proteomic findings from TDP-43 Q331K 2 ) 1 Fig. 2 Proteomic signatures across ALS tissue are highly overlapping. ( A B C D F E F G A total of 102,196 peptide groups (464 k PSMs) were identified and assigned to 10,238 protein groups (11,277 proteins), of which 7,070 were quantified across all samples. By PCA, there was subtle segregation by disease status (i.e., ALS versus control), but none by tissue type (Fig. 2 2 2 2 Using a linear mixed model, we then performed differential expression analysis comparing control versus ALS cases on the combined and tissue-stratified data (Fig. 2 2 2 2 G 1 Immune and mitochondrial functions are differentially regulated in ALS We next performed ORA and GSEA on combined and tissue-stratified data to better understand the function of the DEPs and provide insight into mechanisms influencing disease progression (Fig. 3 3 B 3 2 2 Fig. 3 Immune and mitochondrial functions are differentially regulated in ALS. ( A B A B C Interestingly, of the top upregulated GO terms, the majority of these were associated with immune and inflammatory responses, including the innate and adaptive immune responses, B cell mediated immunity and complement activation (Fig. 3 2 2 2 2 In contrast to our findings in mice, the majority of the downregulated GO processes in the combined human dataset were involved in mitochondrial function, respiration, ATP synthesis and biosynthesis processes (Fig. 3 2 2 2 TDP-43 mice do not recapitulate immune responses in ALS To compare our findings from mice and humans we generated an upset plot evaluating the unique and shared GO, KEGG and REACTOME terms (Fig. 4 4 Fig. 4 TDP-43 mice do not recapitulate inflammatory immune responses in ALS. ( A C A B D F D F E D E F Notably, the 15 processes shared across species were regulated in opposite directions. Specifically, these were all associated with mitochondrial function and were upregulated and downregulated in mice and humans, respectively (Fig. 4 C 2 4 3 4 3 Another striking finding was the abundant upregulation of immune responses in humans which was not apparent in mice (Fig. 4 3 Q331K Enrichment analysis of multiple mouse models identifies those that exhibit higher concordance with human ALS To identify mouse models of ALS that better recapitulate our findings in humans, we performed a meta-analysis using previously published proteomics datasets (Fig. 5 28 2 5 29 32 Fig. 5 Enrichment analysis across mouse models of ALS. ( A B C Across the 20 samples, 6 showed zero significantly enriched GO biological processes, cellular component or molecular function terms when performing a GSEA on each individual study (Fig. 5 5 Q331K Ubqln2 5 4 We then performed a joint GSEA analysis on all samples together using the GO biological processes database. The most common upregulated terms across studies included those relating to mRNA processing and negative regulation of DNA-templated transcription, nucleobase-containing compound metabolic process, RNA metabolic and biosynthetic process (Fig. 5 and 5 5 and 5 Intriguingly, Ubqln2 6 Ubqln2 Q331K 6 Fig. 6 Alterations in mitochondrial and immune processes across mouse models of ALS. ( A D A C B D A B C D While we acknowledge that a direct side-by-side comparison of all mouse models using the same proteomics platform with appropriate batch controls is required to unambiguously identify unique and shared features across these model – our re-analysis of previously published data indicates that young Ubqln2 Discussion ALS is a rapidly debilitating and fatal disease with no curative treatment available. Understanding the precise molecular processes contributing to disease pathogenesis is essential to reveal novel therapeutic targets. In this study, we identify the in-depth tissue- and species-specific proteomes to reveal dysfunctional biological processes linked to ALS. Examination of the brain and spine of TDP-43 Q331K 8 9 36 37 38 39 40 41 40 31 42 While our analysis in mice provides an in-depth investigation of the precise processes dysregulated with mutant TDP-43 expression, ALS is far more complex and multifactorial than TDP-43 dysregulation. Our analysis of human ALS tissue spanning the motor cortex, cervical, thoracic and lumbar regions demonstrated many shared DEPs and GSEA terms with the top upregulated terms associated with the immune system. The role of the immune system in promoting inflammation and exacerbating neurodegeneration in ALS and many other neurological diseases, is now widely appreciated, particularly since many proteins encoded by mutant genes alter immune function 1 5 43 44 46 1 36 47 5 Of note, SAA1 was the top upregulated protein across all human ALS tissue. SAA1 is a member of the serum amyloid A family of apolipoproteins expressed during the initial response to infection and trauma. Consequently, it has been identified as biomarker of many infectious and inflammatory diseases including COVID-19, ischemic stroke, cancer and inflammatory bowel disease 48 56 57 58 59 5 42 1 60 43 Importantly and in contrast to humans, our analysis revealed the limited inflammatory or immune related pathways upregulated in TDP-43 Q331K 61 13 47 43 62 32 Q331K In mice and humans, mitochondrial processes were highly deregulated in ALS, albeit in the opposite direction. Mitochondrial function is crucial in the brain, consuming 20% of the body’s resting ATP production and providing an essential Ca 2+ 9 9 63 64 65 The discrepancy in the differential regulation of mitochondrial processes in TDP-43 Q331K 32 31 32 Our analysis of previously published mouse proteomics datasets demonstrate that young Ubqln2 29 66 67 31 In this study, we demonstrated the broad proteomic dysregulation in bulk tissue, however future studies require investigations at a single-cell level to more precisely identify cell-specific responses. Moreover, our investigation is limited by the very small range of mouse models, sexes and timepoints examined, which prevented analysis of sex- and temporal-specific alterations in biological processes across various transgenic mice. Sex-specific alterations is an important differentiating factor in ALS and should be considered in future studies 31 Conclusions Overall, we define the tissue-specific alterations in humans and mice with ALS associated with the modulation of diverse cellular processes. We suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction followed by immune activation are key drivers of pathology. The sheer complexity and heterogeneity of neurodegenerative diseases presents extreme challenges in targeting these pathologies. Future studies are required to more precisely define and track cell-specific immune dysregulation in humans for effective treatment. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Information 1.
