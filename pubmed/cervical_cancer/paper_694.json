Breast cancer has been known for its high propensity of metastasis to unusual locations and the jaw bones are one among those sites. Numerous studies examining metastatic tumours to the oral region have been described in the literature. However, the analysis of Breast cancer metastasis to the jaw bones alone has been the subject of relatively few published research studies to date. This review was conducted to examine the published cases of metastasis to jaw bones from breast cancer as the sole primary source from 1954-2023. An electronic search of the published literature was performed without publication year limitation in PubMed/ Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science direct and Embase databases, using mesh keywords like (‘Breast cancer’, OR ‘Breast carcinoma’), AND (‘Metastasis’ OR ‘Metastases’), And (‘Jaw’ OR ‘Maxilla’ OR ‘Mandible’ OR ‘Temporomandibular joint’ OR ‘Condyle’). We also searched all related journals manually. The reference list of all articles was also checked. Our research revealed a total of 63 relevant papers with 74 patients. The mandible was more predominantly affected jaw than the maxilla. 20% of patients died with a mean survival time of 1.8 years. To conclude, Breast cancer metastasis to the jaw bones is a rare occurrence. Careful evaluation of more number of such cases is needed in order to raise awareness of these lesions and gain a better understanding of their characteristics.reful evaluation of such cases is needed to raise awareness of these lesions and gain a better understanding of their characteristics.

According to Global Cancer Observatory (GLOBACON) records, there were over 2.3 million new cases of BC worldwide in 2022, and this cancer was responsible for 684996 fatalities.[ 1 2 3 3 4 MATERIALS AND METHODS The present study was conducted by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. It was not necessary to obtain ethical approval for this review due to its nature. Focused question To answer the research question, “How many cases of BC metastasizing to JB have been documented in the literature, and what is the prognosis of these metastatic lesions?” the Joanna Briggs Institute’s CoCoPop (context, condition, population) paradigm was employed.  Pop (Population): Patients with BC Co (Condition): Jaw bone metastasis Co (context): Characteristics of these patients (e.g., demographics, clinico-pathological and prognostic parameters, etc). Search strategy for identification of studies Without regard to publication year limitations, an electronic search of the published literature was conducted using mesh keywords such as (“Breast cancer” or “Breast carcinoma”) and (“Metastasis” or “Metastases”) and (“Jaw” or “Maxilla” or “Mandible” or “Temporomandibular joint” or “Condyle”) in the databases PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Science direct and Embase [ Figure 1 Figure 1 PRISMA flowchart showing search strategy Screening of studies Three stages of study screening were engaged in this review. First, duplicates were eliminated after two authors (SG, NA) separately assessed the titles. Subsequently, the selected abstracts of every report were independently examined by the next two authors (AV, RV). Based on how well they evaluated the titles and abstracts of the first 50 references they could find, the reviewers were calibrated. The reviewers' kappa value for agreement was 0.82. The abstracts and titles were included in the study if they satisfied the eligibility requirement. In the last round, authors (MEMH, FM) independently reviewed the texts of the chosen studies. All authors' cases that seemed to meet the inclusion requirements or for which there was inadequate evidence were gathered, discussed, and resolved in the final report. Inclusion criteria  Confirmed cases of JBM via BC. The cases reported were from years 1954 through 2023. Study types include retrospective analysis, case series, and case reports. Cases were chosen without regard to restrictions on demographics like age, gender, race, or socioeconomic status, among others. All published articles were included, regardless of language. Exclusion criteria  Cases with no definite diagnosis of JBM via BC. Publications from primary sites other than Breast that report the JBM. Cases with BC metastasis to OST, salivary glands, and maxillary sinus were not included. Research that did not offer individual patient information was disregarded. Editorials, conference abstracts, hypothesis papers, web news, media coverage, and animal experiments. Outcome measures Primary outcome measures: To evaluate the number of cases of JBM via BC reported in the literature and to determine their prognosis. Secondary outcome measures: To evaluate other factors such as Worldwide distribution of cases, Patient’s demographic details, associated risk factors, Predominant site of JBM, Clinical features of these metastatic lesions, Most prevalent type of metastatic BC, Type of therapies used. Risk of bias assessment The majority of papers included in this review were case reports and case series. CARE and Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklists were used to assess the likelihood of bias.[ 5 6 Data extraction and analysis The data were extracted following the selection, screening, and in-depth inspection of the studies.

Although the majority of instances are documented in females, a few cases of BC in males have also been described. The peak age of occurrence is the second to sixth decade in females.[ 60 Oral cavity metastases account for about 1% of all oral cancers and are regarded as uncommon. Metastatic lesions are considered to be a diagnostic challenge due to their uncommon nature and unusual clinical and radiographic appearance, which may lead to a false diagnosis of pathologic entities with a dental origin. The most common source of metastases to JB is BC. If this happens, the mandible is more likely to be affected than the Maxilla.[ 3 7 Uncertainties exist regarding the pathogenic mechanisms underlying JBM. Tumour cells separate from their original site during the multistage process of metastasis and move via hematogenous or lymphatic routes to a secondary site.[ 4 3 3 TMJ is an uncommon site of metastasis that is typically associated with skeletal metastases and develops in the latter stages of the disease. TMJ and condylar involvement were the least common among the JBM, according to Irani et al 3 52 Because JBM resembles primary oral cancers, is located centrally, is asymptomatic, and has non-specific radiographic characteristics, it is more difficult to detect than OST lesions. Moreover, some anomalies may go unnoticed at autopsy since the jaws are not often examined. The actual incidence of metastatic tumours in the jaws may, therefore, be higher.[ 3 JBM is of high clinical importance because it may be the only symptom of an undiagnosed underlying malignancy or the first sign of metastasis. Metastasis can even appear in patients after a prolonged disease-free period. In our study, JB was the initial site of metastasis in 19% of cases, whereas, in 58% of cases, metastasis was detected after the mastectomy was done for BC, with an average mean time of one month to 27 years. Clinically, painful or asymptomatic swelling combined with dysphagia, paraesthesia, pathological fractures, numb chin syndrome, and trouble chewing are the hallmarks of metastatic BC to JB.[ 52 JBM’s radiographic features are not pathognomonic. Osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions may result from a particular form of interaction between tumour cells and the bone microenvironment. The majority of cancers are identified by OL. Prostate cancer is a major cause of OB lesions.[ 58 59 To assess the extent of soft tissue involvement and other sites of distant metastasis in the body, several modern imaging tools are necessary such as computerised tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Positron emission tomography (PET). A biopsy is recommended for the histopathological examination to provide a conclusive diagnosis of the type of metastatic lesion. However, it might be difficult to make an exact diagnosis because of varied histological appearances, particularly when the major focus of the primary site is unknown. Histopathologically, BC has been divided into various subgroups. The World Health Organization’s classification 2022 has introduced many new entities in the BC.[ 70 For the histological analysis to provide a definitive diagnosis of the type of metastatic lesion, a biopsy is advised. However, due to the variable histological appearance, an accurate diagnosis may be challenging, especially if the primary focus is unknown. BC has been classified histopathologically into several subgroups. According to the World Health Organization’s classification, BC now includes a large number of additional entities.[ 70 The treatment of choice for primary BC ranges from mastectomy to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy or even palliative treatment. Management for JBM includes a combination of surgical removal of solitary tumors, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and endocrine therapy. The most commonly used therapeutic aids in this study were multiple therapies (27%). Other therapies used were chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal. Despite the proposed treatments, patients with metastatic involvement of JB have poor prognosis, with the 5-year survival rate reported to be 10%. According to the current study, only 20% of individuals died, with an average survival time of 1.8 years. 27% of patients had a good prognosis with no signs of recurrence. 4 cases are under follow-up. Limitations of current research One of the major limitations of our research was the lack of information provided for many parameters included for data extraction. CONCLUSIONS During the last 69 years (1954-2023), we found only 74 cases of BC metastasis to JB. This signifies a rare occurrence of JB metastasis from BC as the sole primary source. 20% of patients died, with a mean survival rate of 1.8 years. The mandible was the most affected jaw, followed by the Maxilla. Because they resemble primary neoplastic and non-neoplastic JB lesions, metastatic lesions go unnoticed the majority of the time. Their diagnosis is a challenging task for clinicians and pathologists. A thorough examination of the metastatic lesions is required, including a review of the patient’s medical history, clinical presentation, and early diagnosis to identify the primary site of metastasis and choose the best course of treatment.
