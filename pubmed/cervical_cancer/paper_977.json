Patients who are clinically lymph node negative (cN0) lack clinical evidence of central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) on preoperative ultrasonography or computed tomography. This study aimed to identify clinical factors associated with CLNM based on ultrasonographic features and clinical data, and to develop a nomogram for personalised clinical decision-making. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients diagnosed with cN0 PTMC who were treated at the Vascular Thyroid Surgery Department of the Hospital from December 2020 to February 2022, totaling 834 individuals. The patients were divided into CLNM and non-CLNM groups based on postoperative pathology. The clinical characteristics and ultrasonographic features of the PTMC were collected. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression method was applied in R for feature selection. A nomogram was then developed based on multivariable logistic regression using the predictors selected by the LASSO algorithm. The receiver operating characteristic curve and Hosmer-Lemeshow test were used to assess the discrimination and calibration of the nomogram model, respectively. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed using the Risk Model Decision Analysis package to evaluate the clinical utility of the model in the validation dataset. Results Six variables associated with patients with PTMC were identified through LASSO shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis and used to establish the nomogram. The predictive model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.719 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.681–0.757), and in internal validation, the AUC was 0.717 (95% CI 0.683–0.754). The calibration curve indicated a good fit for the model, and the Hosmer–Lemeshow test demonstrated a close match between the predicted and observed values ( P Conclusion The LASSO regression model nomogram based on clinical risk factors and ultrasonographic features is valuable in predicting CLNM in cN0 PTMC, and can assist surgeons in making more personalised clinical decisions.

Approximately 25–65% of patients diagnosed with cN0 PTMC were later confirmed to have CLNM, either intraoperatively or postoperatively [ 7 8 9 10 This study aimed to identify risk factors for CLNM in patients with cN0 PTMC based on data from our institution, and developed and validated a nomogram for preoperative decision-making in pCND to predict the risk of CLNM. Materials and methods Patients The study sample included 834 patients with a pathological diagnosis of cN0 PTMC, who were treated at the Department of Vascular Thyroid Surgery of the First People’s Hospital of Foshan City between December 2020 and February 2022. All patients were divided into the CLNM and non-CLNM groups according to the presence or absence of CLNM on postoperative pathology. The clinical information and ultrasound features were retrospectively analysed. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1)complete clinical and ultrasound data, 2)postoperative pathology of the primary thyroid lesion confirms PTC, with the lesion located in one or both thyroid glands, and 3)at least the affected thyroid lobe and isthmus are resected, along with ipsilateral central compartment lymph node dissection. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with combined diffuse thyroid changes, (2) tumour size > 1 cm or suspected lymph node metastasis on ultrasound, (3) history of previous thyroid surgery, (4) those who did not undergo preoperative ultrasound or whose ultrasound data were not available; and 5)jump metastasis. This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First People’s Hospital of Foshan(Lunshenyan[2024]No.164), and the requirement for informed consent was waived. A flowchart of the patient inclusion process is shown in Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Flowchart of the included patients Ultrasound examination Examinations were performed using high-resolution ultrasound systems from multiple manufacturers, including Canon (APLIO i800 TUS-AI800), Esaote (MYLAB TWICE), Mindray (Resona I9, R9), and GE Healthcare (LOGIQ E8-E11,P9), All scans were acquired using linear array transducers in a frequency range of 8–15 MHz. To ensure optimal image quality, key acquisition parameters, such as gain, depth, focal-zone placement, edge enhancement, and dynamic range, were tailored for each scan. Both thyroid lobes were systematically evaluated in the longitudinal and transverse planes, with complete grayscale and Colour-Doppler datasets captured for every lobe. Data collection The following data were collected: (1) clinical information: sex (male or female), age (< 55 or ≥ 55 years), and (2) ultrasound features: location (upper or middle or lower), position (left or right or isthmus), tumour diameter (≤ 8 mm or > 8 mm), multifocality, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), composition, echogenicity, aspect ratio (≥ 1 or < 1), margin, and echogenic foci. Multifocality is defined as the presence of two or more distinct foci of PTC, with each focus representing the lesion with the most malignant features, either confined to one lobe or bilaterally distributed. An aspect ratio ≥ 1 indicates that the anteroposterior diameter of the nodule is equal to or exceeds its transverse diameter, whereas an aspect ratio < 1 indicates that the anteroposterior diameter is less than the transverse diameter. The composition described the relative proportion of solid and fluid components within each nodule and was categorised as cystic or spongiform, mixed cystic, or solid. Echogenicity was evaluated in the noncalcified solid portion of the nodule with reference to the adjacent normal thyroid parenchyma or anterior strap muscles. The nodule was labeled as hyperechoic if it appeared brighter than the thyroid tissue, isoechoic if echogenicity matched the thyroid tissue, hypoechoic if darker than the thyroid tissue, or very hypoechoic if less echogenic than the strap muscles. Margins were characterized by the contour of the interface between the nodule and the surrounding thyroid parenchyma and were described as smooth, lobulated, or irregular. Echogenic foci were defined as sharply echogenic foci located within or at the periphery of the nodule, distinct from the surrounding parenchyma. These were further classified as large comet-tail artifacts, macrocalcifications, peripheral calcifications, or punctate echogenic foci. The ETE describes the spatial relationship between a nodule thyroid capsule, and perithyroidal structures. ETE was identified when a nodule breached the thyroid capsule and directly invaded adjacent structures, as evidenced by the discontinuity of the capsular contour [ 10 Two physicians with more than 7 years of experience in ultrasonography independently analyzed the images without knowing the pathological results, with final assessments determined by consensus. Surgical procedures In accordance with the Chinese Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer [ 11 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 25.0 software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) and R software (version 4.3.1; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Categorical variable were represented as numbers and percentages, and two-sided P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Univariate analysis for comparison between patient groups was performed using Pearson’s chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) expression was used to filter the predictors of CLNM [ 12 13 14 15 Results Clinical information and ultrasound features of patients with PTMC This study included 834 patients diagnosed with PTMC, of whom 600 (71.9%) were female and 234 (28.1%) were male. The mean age was 43.3 ± 11.1 years (range 17–77 years). Tumour diameters varied from 2 mm to 10 mm, with a mean diameter of 7 ± 2 mm. Of all patients, 23.6% (197/834) exhibited multifocal PTMCs (≥ 2 foci), whereas 76.4% (637/834) had unifocal PTMCs. Regarding tumour location, 19.3% (161/834), 55.8% (465/834), and 24.3% (208/834) of tumours were located in the upper, middle, and lower poles, respectively. CLNM was detected in 28.5% (238/834) of the PTMC cases and absent in 71.5% (596/834) of the cases (Table 1  Table 1 Demographics and clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) in clinically lymph node negative (cN0) Variables Total Sex male 234(28.1%) female 600(71.9%) Age(years) <55 603(73.0%) ≥ 55 225(27.0%) Location upper 161(19.3%) middle 465(55.8%) lower 208(24.9%) Position left 416(49.9%) right 376(45.1%) isthmus 42(5.0%) Tumour diameter, mm ≤ 8 603(72.3%) >8 231(27.7%) Multifocality Yes 197(23.6%) No 637(76.4%) ETE Yes 143(17.1%) No 691(82.9%) Composition Cystic or Spongifour 4(0.5%) Mixed cystic 400(48.0%) Solid 430(51.6%) Echogenicity Hyperechoic or isoechoic 15(1.8%) Hypoechoic 655(78.5%) Very hypoechoic 164(19.7%) Aspect ratio <1 527(63.2%) ≥ 1 307(36.8%) Margin Smooth 161(19.3%) Lobulaced 405(48.6%) Irregular 268(32.1%) Echogenic foci large comet-tail artifacts 309(37.1%) macrocalcifications 28(3.4%) Peripheral calcifications 8(1.0%) punctate echogenic foci 489(58.6%) Central lymph node metastasis Present 238(28.5%) Absent 596(71.5%) Development of predictive model LASSO regression analysis identified 13 potential risk factors, and ultimately selected 10 factors with nonzero coefficients in the final model (sex, age, location, tumour diameter, multifocality, composition, ETE, margin, echogenicity, and echogenic foci (Fig. 2 2 3  Fig. 2 ( a b  Fig. 3 Nomogram for predicting central lymph node metastasis based on six risk factors  Table 2 Logistic regression analysis of the risk factors of central lymph node metastasis in patients with cN0 PTMC Variables Multivariable logistics model Coefficients OR(95%CI) P Sex -0.427 0.65(0.46–0.93) 0.019 Age -2.343 0.83(0.56–1.22) 0.3 Location(Lower) 2.033 1.68(1.02–2.79) 0.042 Tumour diameter 3.657 1.95(1.36–2.79) <0.001 Multifocality 3.747 2.02(1.40–2.91) <0.001 Composition(solid) -0.669 0.46(0.04–4.89) 0.5 ETE 2.464 2.60(1.74–3.87) <0.001 Margin 0.790 1.32(0.66–2.66) 0.4 Echogenicity -0.713 0.65(0.21–2.28) 0.5 Echogenic foci (punctate) 4.408 2.28(1.59–3.32) <0.001 Validation of the CLNM-predicting nomogram The AUC for the predictive model was 0.719 (95% CI, 0.681–0.757) (Fig. 4 4 P 5 6  Fig. 4 ( a b  Fig. 5 Calibration curves of the predicted nomogram.

DCA, decision curve analysis Discussion Regional lymph node metastasis is common in patients with PTC, with the central neck lymph nodes being the primary site of involvement. PTMC generally has a favourable prognosis; however, the CLNM rate in PTMC ranges from 24.1 to 64.1% [ 16 In this study, 834 patients with PTMC were included. By characterising the clinical and nodal ultrasound features, a nomogram was developed as a new strategy to personalise and quantify the probability of CLNM in patients with PTC. First, risk factor screening by LASSO regression was applied, a widely used variable selection method for fitting high-dimensional generalised linear models, which allows finer models to be derived by constructing penalty functions to reduce the number of variables and avoid overfitting [ 17 n Among the 834 patients diagnosed with PTMC, 28.5% (238/834) exhibited pathologically confirmed CLNM, which is consistent with the findings of earlier investigations [ 16 18 19 The impact of tumour location on lymph node metastasis has been debated in the literature. In our study, CLNM tumours were distributed across the upper (16.4%), middle (53.8%), and lower (29.8%) poles. Data analysis revealed that tumour location in the lower poles was an independent risk factor for CLNM development. This finding was consistent with that of Sun et al. [ 20 21 22 23 In the current study, 23.6% of patients presented with multifocal tumours, and CLNM was observed in 43.7% of these cases. Previous research [ 20 22 24 25 27 20 28 29 For enhanced convenience in the application and visual representation of the results for predicting the risk of CLNM, a personalised and quantitative nomogram was constructed based on these six independent risk factors. The AUC of the nomogram was 0.719 (95% CI 0.681–0.757), indicating sufficient discriminative power. Notably, internal validation was successfully performed through 1000 resampling bootstrap analyses, confirming the robustness of the nomogram. The calibration curves demonstrated reasonable agreement between the ideal and observed lines in the developed nomogram. Furthermore, DCA graphically illustrates the clinical utility of our predictive model. However, this study had some limitations. First, the model did not undergo external validation, which limited its applicability in diverse clinical settings. Second, biochemical parameters such as thyroid function were not included in the model. Third, the size and number of metastatic lymph nodes were not collected in this study and will be included in future investigations. In summary, our findings revealed independent associations between CLNM and sex, tumour diameter, multifocality, tumour location, and echogenic foci in patients with PTMC. Using these variables, a nomogram capable of assessing the CLNM risk in patients with PTMC was constructed. This tool aims to aid clinicians in making personalised management decisions based on a comprehensive evaluation of the aforementioned risk factors.
