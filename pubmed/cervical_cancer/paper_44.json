It usually presents with nodal involvement (cervical, mediastinal, or abdominal), but approximately 30% of patients will exhibit extranodal involvement, with 2-4% presenting as a primary cardiac mass. Multimodal imaging is essential to distinguish these masses from other common benign lesions and to assist in surgical planning. Here, we report a case of DLBCL manifested as a right atrial mass, pericardial eﬀusion, and cardiac tamponade. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) were complementary to transthoracic echocardiogram in diagnosing the cardiac neoplasm, with positron emission tomography (PET-CT) aiding in staging and localizing the primary tumor. Biopsy of the cardiac mass or extracardiac involvement confirms the histopathological subtype and guides the treatment. Although primary and secondary cardiac tumors have poor outcomes, early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can influence prognosis. lymphoma right atrial mass tamponade cardiovascular imaging DLBCL pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Background Primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) is a rare malignancy that is confined to the heart and pericardium, representing 1.3 to 3% of all primary cardiac tumors.. 1 2 1,2 3 4,5 Case Presentation A 56-year-old male with a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease was transferred to our institution for further evaluation of a right atrial mass. One week prior, he was admitted to an outside facility for dizziness and hypotension. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) during that admission revealed a right atrial mass (8 cm in size) and pericardial eﬀusion with signs of cardiac tamponade. Emergent pericardiocentesis with drain placement was performed, yielding 760 mL of serosanguinous exudate with negative cytology, resulting in hemodynamic stabilization. The analysis of the pericardial fluid is summarized in Table 1 On admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable, with a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg, a heart rate of 80 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, a temperature of 36.3°C, and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. Physical examination revealed no palpable cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy; no jugular venous distension; clear lung fields; and normal heart sounds without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, peripheral edema, or pericardial rub appreciated. Laboratory parameters are summarized in Table 1 Figure 1 Figure 2 301135 Table 1.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sagittal section (A) and axial section (B) showing a multilobulated, enhancing interatrial mass (white arrows) measuring approximately 9 × 7 × 6 cm, protruding into the right atrium with a significant mass eﬀect, causing narrowing of the inferior vena cava (IVC) at the cavo-atrial junction. A close-up of a scan of a chest AI-generated content may be incorrect. Whole-body staging with positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) demonstrated fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid uptake in the right atrial mass, along with FDG-avid bilateral adrenal masses, a right lower lobe pulmonary nodule, and lymphadenopathy involving the right cervical, right axillary, precarinial, retroperitoneal, and iliac lymph nodes—findings suggestive of a metastatic process. As a part of the staging process, an MRI of the brain was unremarkable. Histopathological examination of the CT-guided biopsy of the left adrenal mass confirmed diﬀuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), with medium to large atypical lymphoid cells positive for CD20, MUM1, BCL6 and c-MYC (focally greater than 40%). Fluorescence in-situ hybridization was positive for a BCL6 rearrangement at 3q27.3 and negative for rearrangements involving BCL2. The Ki-67 proliferation rate was greater than 90%. A multidisciplinary discussion was done, and cardiac surgery was deferred in view of metastatic disease and high-risk surgical candidacy. Given the aggressive nature of the disease and metastatic spread, the patient was promptly initiated on R-CHOP chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) on an urgent basis, as DLBCL is highly chemosensitive. He tolerated the chemotherapy well and received one cycle of treatment before being discharged. The patient remained hemodynamically stable with no recurrence of pericardial effusion. The pericardial drain was removed four days after it was placed. A bedside point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was performed, confirming only a small, stable effusion without features of tamponade, and the pericardial drain had been removed. A multidisciplinary discussion determined that the patient was safe for discharge, given stable hemodynamics and absence of complications. This facilitated initiation of outpatient chemotherapy with close cardiology and oncology follow-up. In the outpatient setting, the patient was switched from R-CHOP to Pola-R-CHP (polatuzumab vedotin, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin [epirubicin], and prednisone) starting with cycle 2. He completed a total of six cycles of therapy. A follow-up PET/CT at five months demonstrated a complete metabolic response, with no evidence of residual FDG-avid disease. Clinically, he reported feeling “back to 100%,” resumed full-time work, and experienced only minor peripheral neuropathy, which subsequently improved with minimal residual symptoms. Discussion Lymphomas involving the heart and pericardium are most often secondary to disseminated disease, with primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) being a rare occurrence, accounting for only 1.3% of cases. 1,6 7 8 8 3 Clinical presentations of primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) are often nonspecific, making it challenging to distinguish from other more common cardiac masses, such as myxomas, angiosarcomas, or pseudo-masses, which diﬀer in management strategies and prognosis. Multimodal imaging and biopsy are essential for an accurate diagnosis. 9 10 10,11 Cardiac computed tomography (CCT), cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) serve as complementary imaging modalities to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) in the diagnosis of right atrial masses. CCT with contrast provides optimal anatomical details and coronary artery assessment prior to surgical intervention. Additionally, ECG-gated CCT can provide lesion mobility. On CCT, lymphoma typically appears as multiple solid masses attached to the myocardium or, more commonly, as an infiltrative mass within the myocardium or epicardium, which is hypodense or isodense relative to the myocardium, with slight contrast enhancement. A distinctive feature of cardiac lymphoma is diﬀusion along the surfaces of adjacent structures. 10 12 13 Chemotherapy remains the standard treatment for lymphoma, with the first-line regimen of R-CHOP demonstrating a favorable response rate. Alternative regimens, such as R-EPOCH and R-Pola-CHP, are also viable options. 3,14 15,16 17 18 17 19,20 21 22 Conclusion The occurrence of DLBCL presenting as a right atrial mass with cardiac tamponade is extremely uncommon. Multimodal imaging helps with the diagnosis and staging of the tumor. Primary and secondary cardiac tumors typically have poor prognosis. However, early diagnosis and aggressive treatment have implications on the outcomes. Dislcosures/Conflicts of Interest The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.
