Plasmin-mediated cellular responses were further examined by proteomic analysis of mPSIEC whole-cell lysates. In parallel, the contribution of the fibrinolytic system in FhNEJ migration was studied in vivo by infecting mice with F. hepatica Results Co-stimulation of mPSIEC with FhNEJ and PLG led to increased plasmin generation in the intestinal pericellular space, which was associated with enhanced collagen degradation and secretion of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator. In addition, using independent cell culture replicates and a stringent statistical pipeline, we identified a robust set of differentially expressed proteins in mPSIEC following stimulation with FhNEJ and PLG. These proteins were involved in cell adhesion, migration, ECM remodelling, immune evasion and fibrinolysis. Despite inter-experimental variability, FhNEJ migration in mice was reduced upon pharmacological inhibition of fibrinolysis, supporting the contribution of host fibrinolysis to parasite invasion in vivo. Conclusions Altogether, this work provides unprecedented insights into the role of the host fibrinolytic system to FhNEJ migration across mammalian host tissues, thereby advancing our understanding of host–parasite relationships during early stage fasciolosis and highlighting interesting directions for future research in this area.

These include the expression of proteins that bind to PLG, the precursor zymogen of u-PA (pro-u-PA), or both at the host–parasite interface [ 14 16 18 15 24 25 26 Although the interaction between parasites and the host fibrinolytic system is well-established [ 1 3 1 F. hepatica 27 28 29 Methods Culture of mouse primary small intestinal epithelial cells C57BL/6 mouse primary small intestinal epithelial cells (mPSIEC; Cell Biologics) were cultured as previously described [ 27 28 2 2 Excystment of F. hepatica F. hepatica 14 2 2 In vitro interaction model FhNEJ were co-cultured with mPSIEC as previously described [ 27 28 g g Plasmin activity in cell culture supernatants Plasmin activity in cell culture supernatants collected from mPSIEC in the in vitro interaction model was assayed by measuring the amidolytic activity of generated plasmin on a plasmin-specific chromogenic substrate, as previously described [ 14 d Analysis of u-PA levels in cell culture supernatants The levels of u-PA in cell culture supernatants (100 µL) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Mouse PLAU/Upa (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator) ELISA kit (FineTest) and following the manufacturer’s instructions. The reaction was stopped 11 min after addition of the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate, and the amount of u-PA in the samples was quantified by fitting a regression line to the linear portion of a standard curve with known u-PA concentrations. All the reactions were performed in technical duplicate. Analysis of total collagen in cell culture supernatants The levels of total collagen in cell culture supernatants (20 µL) were measured by enzymatic digestion of collagen into N Zymography The ability of plasmin to degrade the mPSIEC coating solution was measured by preparing 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels using standard protocols but replacing water with the mPSIEC coating solution (Cell Biologics). Next, different amounts of plasmin (Origene) were mixed with non-reducing sample buffer (125 mM Tris–HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue) in a total volume of 18 µL, and samples were loaded onto the gel in duplicate. Electrophoresis was performed at a constant current of 15 mA for 20 min followed by 30 mA. After electrophoresis, the gel was soaked twice in wash buffer (5 mM CaCl 2 2 30 Analysis of MMP levels in cell culture supernatants The levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, pro-MMP-9 and MMP-12 in mPSIEC culture supernatants (25 µL) were analysed on a Luminex xMAP platform using a 5-plex mouse MMP magnetic bead panel (Millipore) and in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Multiplex assays were analysed on a Liquichip Luminex 100 Liquid Array Multiplexing System XYP Lab (Luminex Corporation, Qiagen) with Luminex Xponent 3.1 software (Luminex Corporation), following the manufacturer’s technical guidelines. Data analysis was performed with the Milliplex Analyst 5.1 Software (Merck). All the reactions were performed in technical duplicate. The experiment and analysis were conducted at the Flow Cytometry Facility of the National Centre for Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC, Madrid, Spain). Proteomic analysis of mPSIEC whole-cell lysates Sample preparation Protein concentrations were determined using the Macherey–Nagel Protein Quantification Assay (Macherey–Nagel), and equal amounts of protein were reduced with 2 mM dithiothreitol at 60 °C for 20 min, and alkylated with 5 mM iodoacetamide diluted in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate at room temperature for 30 min. Next, proteins were purified using the SP3 protocol [ 31 32 Liquid chromatography (LC)–MS/MS analysis Liquid chromatography (LC) was performed by loading 200 ng of digested peptides (diluted in 20 µL of 0.1% formic acid) onto an Evotip Pure tip (EvoSep) following the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by separation using the Evosep One system on an analytical Performance 15 cm × 150 μm column with a particle size of 1.5 μm (Evosep). The eluted peptides were ionised in a CaptiveSpray with 1700 V at 200 °C, and tandem mass spectrometry analysis (MS/MS) was performed with a TimsTOF fleX mass spectrometer (Bruker) in data-independent acquisition Parallel Accumulation-Serial Fragmentation (diaPASEF) mode. Data processing and protein quantification The PASER system (Bruker) was used to send the raw data for subsequent analysis and quantification with DIA-NN version 1.8 software ( https://github.com/vdemichev/DiaNN Mus musculus Statistical analysis Peak intensities of all the conditions were transformed to the logarithm with base e 33 34 Z 35 33 P 36 P Analysis of interaction effects To identify proteins whose differential expression was specifically driven by the interaction of FhNEJ and PLG, rather than by either factor alone, an interaction effect analysis was conducted on the list of DEPs identified using the abovementioned statistical pipeline in the untreated versus FhNEJ + PLG comparison. To ensure that only proteins influenced by the interaction between FhNEJ and PLG were retained, proteins that were also differentially expressed in either the untreated versus FhNEJ or untreated versus PLG comparisons were excluded unless their expression in the combined treatment deviated significantly from the expected additive effect. This approach is conceptually similar to established methodologies in gene interaction studies aimed at detecting synergistic genetic perturbations, where interaction effects are assessed by comparing the observed combined effects to the expected additive effects of individual perturbations [ 37 38 39 In vivo model A total of 20 wild-type, 49–55-day-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) were divided in two groups: one group ( n 40 n F. hepatica 29 F. hepatica F. hepatica 2 PAI-1 and t-PA activity assays The activities of PAI-1 and t-PA in peritoneal fluids of mice were measured using the commercially available Mouse active PAI1 ELISA Kit (Innovative Research) and Mouse Active tPA ELISA Kit (Innovative Research), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The amounts of active PAI-1 and t-PA in the samples were quantified by fitting a regression line to the linear portion of a standard curve with known active PAI-1/t-PA concentrations. All the reactions were performed in technical duplicate. Statistical analysis Plots were created, and statistical analyses were performed using Prism 10 software (GraphPad Software). Unless otherwise stated, graph bars represent the mean of three cell culture replicates, each calculated as the average of two or three technical replicates. Error bars represent either the standard error of the mean (SEM) or the standard deviation (SD) to reflect the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean or the variability among individual technical measurements, respectively. The data from the in vivo experiment were analysed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), considering both treatment groups and the day on which the experiment was conducted as factors. On the basis of the results of this analysis, the data was plotted separately for each day and presented as mean ± SEM. Since normality in data distribution cannot be confidently determined with small sample sizes [ 41 U α Results FhNEJ stimulate plasmin generation in the pericellular space of mouse intestinal epithelial cells To study whether FhNEJ stimulate plasmin generation from host PLG in an in vitro system of host–parasite interactions [ 27 28 14 1 Fig. 1 FhNEJ stimulate plasmin generation from host PLG in the pericellular space of mPSIEC. mPSIEC cultures were incubated with FhNEJ and PLG and plasmin generation on cell culture supernatants (optical density (OD) at 405 nm) was assessed 24 h after stimulation in an enzymatic assay by mixing equal amounts of cell culture supernatants with a plasmin-specific chromogenic substrate. Cells left untreated (Unt) or those that were single-treated with either FhNEJ or PLG served as negative controls for FhNEJ-induced plasmin generation, and cells incubated with FhNEJ and PLG in the presence of ε-ACA were used to assess whether FhNEJ-induced plasmin generation was mediated by lysine residues. A condition was included in where the plasmin-specific chromogenic substrate was incubated with recombinant plasmin (Plm) instead of cell culture supernatant to control for substrate specificity. The results from three independent cell culture replicates are shown. Lines indicate the mean of three technical replicates ± SD. Error is displayed only for the PLG-only and FhNEJ + PLG conditions for simplification purposes FhNEJ increase u-PA levels in mPSIEC culture supernatants and promote collagen degradation in a PLG-dependent manner We next addressed how mPSIEC respond to the presence of FhNEJ in terms of u-PA release and collagen degradation, and whether these responses would be modulated by the interaction between FhNEJ and PLG. The levels of u-PA in cell culture supernatants of mPSIEC left unstimulated, stimulated with FhNEJ and PLG, or stimulated with either component alone were assessed through ELISA, and total collagen in these samples was quantified by measuring the amount of N 2 2 Fig. 2 FhNEJ stimulate u-PA release and collagen degradation by mPSIEC in the presence of PLG. mPSIEC cultures were stimulated with FhNEJ and PLG, and the levels of u-PA ( A B A N B * P Regulation of MMP levels in mPSIEC culture supernatants by FhNEJ We went on to evaluate whether FhNEJ influence the secretion of different ECM-degrading MMPs by mPSIEC, and whether this would be influenced by PLG. To that end, the levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-12, and pro-MMP-9 were analysed through multiplexed assays in cell culture supernatants of mPSIEC left unstimulated, stimulated with FhNEJ and PLG, or stimulated with either component alone (Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Increased secretion of MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-12 and pro-MMP-9 by mPSIEC upon stimulation with FhNEJ. mPSIEC cultures were stimulated with FhNEJ and PLG, with either component alone, or left unstimulated, and the levels of MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-12 and pro-MMP-9 were simultaneously assayed using multiplexed assays. In all graphs, data points represent the value obtained for each independent cell culture replicate, calculated as the average of two technical replicates, and bars represent the mean ± SEM. Only statistically significant differences are shown ( * P Proteomic profiling reveals mPSIEC responses driven by the interaction between FhNEJ and host PLG To characterise in greater detail how mPSIEC respond to FhNEJ and whether these responses are modulated by their interaction with host PLG, a proteomic analysis was conducted in whole-cell lysates from mPSIEC left unstimulated, stimulated with FhNEJ and PLG, or stimulated with either component alone. This analysis identified a total of 8136 proteins with FDR < 1% that were included in the differential expression analysis. We compared the protein expression profiles of untreated cells with cells stimulated with both FhNEJ and PLG to identify proteins that are differentially regulated by the interaction between both factors, which resulted in increased plasmin activity in the pericellular space (Fig. 1 1 Table 1 DEPs in untreated versus FhNEJ + PLG-treated mPSIEC Genes logFC adjPVal Genes logFC adjPVal Cap1 −11.5641 1.16 × 10 −8 Mrgbp 0.315304 0.041192 Eif1ad11 −10.8284 0.044884 Sgo2 0.321909 0.044884 Zfp606 −9.98762 1.16 × 10 −8 Tmem184b 0.337123 0.042419 Serpinb5 −9.09 1.29 × 10 −5 Cdca2 0.337796 0.044267 A130006I12Rik −8.8194 6.9 × 10 −6 Aurka 0.337847 0.037707 S1pr2 −8.79117 6.89 × 10 −5 Glul 0.353169 0.029492 Pptc7 −7.5837 3.26 × 10 −7 Blm 0.365228 0.032615 Tmem14c −0.70435 0.044884 Actn4 0.36718 0.046035 Rab3b −0.67455 0.031743 Rab38 0.367389 0.026216 Mmp11 −0.67003 0.046035 Aurkb 0.370126 0.047626 Dennd3 −0.4902 0.004343 Sash1 0.377697 0.044267 Desi2 −0.44875 0.044884 Rpl35 0.398069 0.012174 Dhx38 −0.44049 0.035042 Acsl4 0.398548 0.007476 Srsf2 −0.43185 0.041835 Cox6a1 0.405347 0.028322 Gorasp1 −0.38835 0.011505 Esco2 0.419492 0.018064 Ccn2 −0.37626 0.046035 0610010K14Rik 0.476796 0.044884 Atrx −0.32326 0.04661 Arhgap20 0.48969 0.044267 Slc25a30 −0.31699 0.046035 Cmip 0.490543 0.046035 P4ha2 −0.26881 0.044267 Aven 0.490844 0.041192 Slc12a7 −0.2512 0.026216 Gmnn 0.495586 0.047626 Scel −0.24909 0.044267 Cdc34 0.522914 0.040503 Gpam −0.23204 0.046035 Suco 0.539981 0.018465 Sppl2a 0.191843 0.042419 Cetn2 0.553036 0.040283 Ska3 0.199186 0.0426 Nifk 0.619508 0.046035 Lama5 0.223652 0.040283 Fnip1 0.677284 0.006195 Slc9a3r2 0.224492 0.046404 Lrig1 0.745655 0.00283 Dvl2 0.239475 0.046035 Sema3a 0.831001 0.031743 Cdv3 0.244815 0.035681 Serpind1 0.858629 0.032615 Notch2 0.247477 0.022438 Fn1 0.888985 0.031603 Lamb1 0.250854 0.018889 Zfhx4 1.130508 0.010738 Prkd2 0.254831 0.048562 Thbs1 1.239887 0.035681 Diaph3 0.255139 0.018889 Serpinb7 1.278409 0.003469 Rnf4 0.25624 0.044267 A2m 1.423682 0.016865 Prr11 0.265523 0.04991 Itih4 1.425836 0.026216 Spdl1 0.271143 0.031743 Tmc5 1.469909 0.002405 Melk 0.27314 0.048562 C7 1.471351 0.003517 Calu 0.28254 0.022262 Dnah14 1.608509 0.026216 Fam50a 0.286497 0.011574 Mettl25 7.646163 4.28E-05 Mphosph10 0.292922 0.028712 Pigr 8.709757 4.38E-06 Msmo1 0.302965 0.031743 Sema3d 10.34484 3.39E-07 Ror1 0.311029 0.021179 Lamtor3-ps 12.05803 0.00283 Tns2 0.313294 0.017259 Alb 12.61229 2.51E-07 A negative fold-change indicates that proteins were overrepresented in FhNEJ + PLG-treated versus untreated mPSIEC.

( A F. hepatica 40 F. hepatica B F. hepatica * P U Discussion Aiming to understand the contribution of the fibrinolytic system in biological processes that might facilitate FhNEJ migration, commercially available primary intestinal epithelial cells derived from the mouse small intestine (mPSIEC) were stimulated with FhNEJ [ 27 28 14 19 28 First, our enzymatic assays revealed that cell culture supernatants from mPSIEC stimulated with both FhNEJ and PLG exhibited increased plasmin activity compared with those from control or single-treated cells, indicating that FhNEJ stimulate plasmin generation in the pericellular space of the mouse small intestine in the presence of host PLG. Since FhNEJ cannot directly cleave and activate PLG [ 14 Since u-PA is expressed by epithelial cells of the small intestine, presumably to loosen intercellular junctions and facilitate epithelial cell turnover at the top of the villi [ 42 43 44 45 Plasmin regulates cell migration by degrading ECM components such as collagen type IV and laminin [ 11 46 25 47 1 3 Dirofilaria immitis 47 48 49 50 48 49 In addition to directly degrading ECM components, plasmin activates the precursor zymogens of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-10, MMP-12, and MMP-13, either via direct cleavage or by activating other MMPs that, in turn, cleave and activate the MMP precursor [ 51 58 12 5 45 59 Since plasmin influences biological processes not only by regulating the activity of proteolytic enzymes but also by modulating intracellular signalling pathways that culminate in changes in gene expression [ 60 63 33 64 67 t 36 68 2 Some of the DEPs resulting from the interaction between FhNEJ and PLG were involved in biological processes that could be beneficial to FhNEJ trans-intestinal migration and survival within the mammalian organism, including cell adhesion and migration, cytoskeleton dynamics, ECM remodelling, mucosal immunity and fibrinolysis. For instance, we identified Cap1, serpin b5, Rab3b, and Actn4 as differentially regulated upon mPSIEC stimulation with both FhNEJ and PLG. Cap1 is involved in cell adhesion and motility through the regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics [ 69 70 71 72 73 In addition, some of the DEPs identified in mPSIEC incubated with both FhNEJ and PLG play important roles in ECM remodelling. Among others, we found differential expression of Mmp-11 and Timp3 in double-treated cells, suggesting that FhNEJ-induced plasmin generation alters the protease/anti-protease balance of the MMP system to ultimately regulate ECM degradation. Overexpression of Mmp-11 is particularly compelling, as this metalloproteinase degrades collagen type IV [ 74 25 75 Another notable functional aspect of the interaction between FhNEJ and PLG, highlighted by our proteomic analysis, is the identification of proteins linked to host immune responses and, potentially, to FhNEJ immune evasion mechanisms. Among others, we found downregulation of Sema3d, Pigr, and the complement molecule C7 in mPSIEC treated with both FhNEJ and PLG. Sema3d has been recently shown to promote pancreatic cancer progression by stimulating macrophage polarisation into a protumourigenic M2 phenotype [ 76 Fasciola 77 78 79 The complement molecule C7 is essential for the assembly of the lethal, pore-forming membrane attack complex, a key effector in antibacterial defence. Previous studies had shown that F. hepatica 80 81 82 Moreover, our proteomic analysis indicated that plasmin itself might also be regulating fibrinolysis in the small intestine tissue microenvironment, as double-treated mPSIEC differentially regulated the expression of two major fibrinolysis inhibitors: A2m and TAFI, which were downregulated and overexpressed, respectively, in mPSIEC upon stimulation with FhNEJ and PLG. This finding suggests that fine-tuning fibrinolysis may benefit the parasite by balancing proteolytic activity such that it facilitates tissue penetration while preventing excessive ECM degradation, which could inadvertently lead to severe tissue damage and exacerbated inflammatory responses in the intestine. Finally, we employed a mouse model of acute fasciolosis [ 29 F. hepatica F. hepatica 40 83 29 Since differences in juvenile counts across experimental days were observed only in PAI-1-treated mice, but not in their control counterparts, we suspected that variations in PAI-1 treatment efficacy between days might explain these results. To investigate this possibility, fibrinolysis was evaluated by measuring the levels of active PAI-1 and t-PA in peritoneal fluids collected immediately after euthanasia. Although the differences in active PAI-1 and t-PA levels between PAI-1-treated and control mice on day 1 were more consistent with the expected inhibition of fibrinolysis than those observed in mice from day 2, these differences were small and did not reach statistical significance. This is likely due to the fact that peritoneal fluids were collected 8 days after PAI-1 treatment, exceeding the maximum half-life of 6 days achieved for this factor through random mutagenesis [ 83 F. hepatica 84 85 Conclusions This study demonstrates that plasmin is generated in the pericellular space of mouse intestinal epithelial cells in the presence of FhNEJ and host-derived PLG. This process correlates with increased collagen degradation and u-PA release into the extracellular environment, potentially facilitating FhNEJ migration across the intestinal wall.
