Terms with adjusted p 21 2.6. Correlation Analysis Between HTR1F Expression and Clinical Factors To comprehensively investigate the association between HTR1F expression and tumor progression across multiple cancer types, we employed the “Clinical Stage of Pan-Cancer Analysis” module provided by the SangerBox platform ( http://www.sangerbox.com/home.html t http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html HTR1F t p p p p HTR1F 2.7. Drug Sensitivity Analysis and Molecular Docking The IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) and gene mRNA expression data of cancer cell lines were downloaded from GSCALite databases. The correlation between HTR1F expression level and drug sensitivity [half inhibitory concentration (IC50)] to 86 small molecule drugs in the GDSC database and CTRP database was analyzed. In the molecular docking analysis, we utilized the PubChem database to identify the name, molecular weight, and 3D structure of small molecule drugs. The corresponding 3D structure of the HTR1F http://www.rcsb.org/ https://cadd.labshare.cn/cb-dock2/php/index.php The crystal structure of the HTR1F HTR1F The docking results were evaluated based on the affinity (kcal/mol) value, which indicates the binding strength between the ligand and receptor. A lower affinity (kcal/mol) value signifies a more stable interaction between the ligand and the receptor. 2.8. Construction of the Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Network An online tool for the retrieval of interacting genes (STRING 11.0; https://string-db.org/ 22 https://cytoscape.org/ 23 24 2.9. Plasmid and Cell Lines LUSC cell lines (NCI-H226 and NCI-H520) were obtained from the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). The cell lines were cultured according to the provided instructions [ 25 2.10. Cell Proliferation and Migration Function Assays The CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8) assay was employed to compare the cell viability between the negative control and the HTR1F high expression groups. The detailed procedures of the in vitro experiments are available in a previous report published by our research group [ 26 3 To evaluate cell migration, transwell assays were performed using transwell chambers (Corning, NY, USA). Serum-free medium containing 1 × 10 5 2.11. Western Blot Total cellular proteins were isolated using RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktails (NCM Biotech, Shanghai, China) to prevent protein degradation and dephosphorylation. After SDS-PAGE separation, the denatured protein samples were electrophoretically transferred onto 0.4 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes at a constant current of 300 mA for 100 min. The membranes were then incubated with primary antibodies, followed by secondary antibodies. Protein signals were subsequently visualized using the ChemiDoc XRS+ system. 2.12. The Human Protein Atlas The Human Protein Atlas ( https://www.proteinatlas.org/ 27 2.13. Statistical Analysis The resulting data were analyzed using the R software (version 3.6.4).

Effects of HTR1F on Cell Proliferation in LUSC Based on our previous findings, HTR1F was identified as an independent prognostic indicator for patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). However, its functional role in LUSC development required further experimental validation. To this end, we upregulated the expression of HTR1F in NCI-H226 and NCI-H520 LUSC cell lines. Western blot analysis confirmed successful upregulation of HTR1F protein levels in both cell lines ( Figure 7 p p Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 4. Discussion Previous studies have revealed that HTR1F is also associated with the development of bladder urinary epithelial carcinoma, GC prognosis, and the survival rate evaluation of the CAFs of GC [ 12 13 The results based on the TCGA database revealed that HTR1F was abnormally overexpressed in 17 types of tumors compared to the normal tissue and that HTR1F was associated with poor prognosis in four types of tumors. Next, the relationship between HTR1F and the clinical prognosis of LUSC patients was evaluated. It was revealed that the abnormal expression of HTR1F was closely linked to the prognosis and the clinicopathological stage of the patients with LUSC. A nomogram was constructed to evaluate the application of HTR1F in the prognostic assessment of LUSC. The above findings indicated that HTR1F can serve as a poor prognostic factor for tumors. The tumor immune microenvironment is increasingly recognized as a decisive factor in determining whether tumor cells are eliminated by immune surveillance or evade immune control [ 30 31 32 33 34 + + 35 36 36 To validate the functional role of HTR1F in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), we performed HTR1F overexpression experiments in two LUSC cell lines, NCI-H226 and NCI-H520. The results showed that HTR1F upregulation significantly increased cell proliferation in both cell lines. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which HTR1F exerts its regulatory effects in LUSC remain to be fully elucidated and warrant further investigation in future studies. In summary, our study revealed that HTR1F is markedly overexpressed in multiple tumor types, with its dysregulated expression closely linked to patient prognosis. Furthermore, aberrant HTR1F expression across pan-cancer was found to correlate significantly with the extent of immune cell infiltration, the expression levels of immune checkpoint molecules, and key genomic features such as tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI). These results suggest that HTR1F may play a critical role in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment and could serve as a valuable biomarker or therapeutic target in diverse cancers. Validation experiments confirmed that HTR1F has oncogene function and promotes the proliferation of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) through the MAPK pathway. Although HTR1F is a ligand-dependent GPCR, we did not assess ligand availability, receptor activation, or downstream signaling markers such as cAMP/β-arrestin responses or PTX sensitivity in this study. Therefore, the observed effects of HTR1F overexpression on cell proliferation and ERK phosphorylation should be interpreted as correlative rather than conclusive. Further studies will be required to determine whether these effects are strictly ligand-dependent. Therefore, it was concluded that HTR1F could be utilized as a potential prognostic biomarker and target for LUSC patients. While this study represents the first comprehensive investigation into the role of HTR1F in cancer, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, our in vitro validation was limited to HTR1F overexpression in two LUSC cell lines (NCI-H226 and NCI-H520) without complementary loss-of-function or pharmacologic rescue experiments. Consequently, these findings are model-specific and preliminary, serving as proof-of-concept support for the pan-cancer bioinformatics analyses rather than definitive mechanistic evidence. Second, cross-cohort tumor–normal comparisons involve TCGA tumor and GTEx normal samples, which may be affected by batch effects due to differences in sample handling and experimental protocols; these comparisons should therefore be regarded as exploratory. Third, while the study incorporates some protein-level evidence from the Human Protein Atlas and Western blot validation in LUSC cell lines, the broader conclusions regarding HTR1F’s potential as a therapeutic target and clinical relevance are primarily based on transcriptomic data. Additional protein-level validation across diverse tumor types—using large-scale proteomic resources such as the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC; https://proteomics.cancer.gov/programs/cptac 37 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/biomedicines13092238/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, Y.G. and Y.Y.; data acquisition and analysis, Y.G., Z.Z., and Q.L.; partial analysis methods, D.Y., Y.W., and S.M.; original draft preparation, writing, Y.G. and B.Z.; important contribution in manuscript amending, Y.Y.; manuscript review and editing, Y.G., L.C., B.Z., and Y.Y.
