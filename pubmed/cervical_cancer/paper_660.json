Unlike traditional drug development approaches that rely on randomized screening, research on aging-related pharmaceuticals has employed mechanism-based strategies, resulting in the discovery of the pioneering combination therapy of dasatinib (D) and quercetin (Q). Although preliminary studies with senolytic drug combinations have shown promising outcomes, the predictive capabilities of the research in this field remain limited by the extensive experimental data requirements. In this study, we employed differential gene expression analysis and machine learning techniques to investigate the combinatorial effects of senolytic drugs. We identified 1624 core aging-related genes and used this dataset to retrain a multimodal attention mechanism model, creating a specialized framework, SenolyticSynergy, for predicting effective senolytic drug combinations. We then utilized 63 established senolytic compounds as starting points for combination testing, developing a comprehensive dataset of 1953 potential drug combinations for aging interventions. Following rigorous filtration, we identified 190 high-confidence drug combinations and predicted their synergistic scores. Among these combinations, ten demonstrated exceptionally high synergistic scores, exceeding 8. The combination of temsirolimus and nitazoxanide ranked first and may be the most promising candidate. The analysis of the literature data and computational studies of molecular structures using 3D modeling validated the accuracy of these predictions. This framework paves the way for large-scale research into anti-aging drug combinations, advancing research capabilities in this field. senolytics aging genome drug combinations anti-aging interventions This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction In recent years, the scientific community is proposed to redefine aging as a chronic disease [ 1 2 In the past decade, numerous machine learning-based models have been developed to predict drug combination synergy. For instance, Zhao and colleagues proposed the Dual Feature Fusion Network for Drug–Drug Synergy prediction (DFFNDDS), which utilizes a fine-tuned pre-trained language model and dual feature fusion mechanism to predict synergistic drug combinations [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 In this study, we utilized various R (Version 4.2.2) packages and methods [ 11 GSE141595 12 GSE72815 13 We successfully identified multiple core differential genes related to aging through differential analysis, including PKP1 NRAP CMA1 Clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes has highlighted the significance of aging-related core pathways, such as hsa04020, demonstrating a robust theoretical foundation for a deeper understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying aging diseases. Furthermore, published experimental studies have confirmed the synergistic effects of several drug combinations predicted by this model. For example, a survey by Ren [ 14 This study aimed to analyze the differential gene expression profiles between young and elderly populations and identify aging-related genes. These genes serve as key input elements for the drug-gene attention model, which predicts and optimizes the potential synergistic benefits of different anti-aging drug combinations. This study provides scientific evidence in support of precision medicine. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Differential Genetic Analysis We obtained the gene expression data files of the GSE141595 GSE72815 15 Figure 1 GSE141595 GSE72815 Table 1 The genes listed in Table 1 H19 16 HIF3A 17 TREM2 18 SERPINA3 19 ADAMTS12 20 2.2. Enrichment Analysis Enrichment analysis is a critical method in bioinformatics, primarily employed to elucidate the functional tendencies of gene sets within specific biological contexts [ 21 Figure 2 2.3. Pathway Analysis The KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway enrichment analysis is a significant bioinformatics method [ 22 The table illustrates pathways involving genes that occur two or more times. There are 11 significant signaling pathways, including the calcium signaling pathway, which concerns the transmission of signals by calcium ions within cells. Calcium ions play crucial roles in organisms, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and muscle contraction. Most of the signaling pathways presented in this table are intricately linked to aging. For instance, hsa04020, which ranks highest in relevance, involves calcium ions as vital cellular messengers in various biological functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, programmed cell death, and muscular contractions. This pathway comprises two primary components: (1) External calcium ion sources: Cells obtain calcium ions from their surroundings through diverse calcium channels located on the cellular membrane, such as voltage- operated channels (VOCs), receptor- operated channels (ROCs), and store-operated channels (SOCs). (2) Internal calcium ion sources: The endoplasmic reticulum/sarcoplasmic reticulum (ER/SR) functions as a critical calcium ion storage site, where inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) and ryanodine receptors (RYRs) control the release of calcium ions. Furthermore, the core pathways in Table 2 23 2.4. Synergy Prediction and Interpretation The prediction model we employed is called SenolyticSynergy. In this study, we integrated the dataset of omic genes 1624 genes to features and made the model specifically for senolytic target utilization. The following Table 3 Supplementary Materials Among the candidate drugs listed, several are FDA-approved for specific clinical indications. Temsirolimus (Torisel) is approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma (FDA approval: 30 May 2007). Nitazoxanide (Alinia) is approved for the treatment of diarrhea caused by Giardia lamblia in patients aged 12 years and older (FDA approval: 21 July 2004). Azithromycin (Zithromax) is approved for various bacterial infections (FDA approval: 1 November 1991). Cantharidin (Ycanth) is approved as a topical treatment for molluscum contagiosum in patients aged 2 years and older (FDA approval: 21 July 2023). Enoxacin was previously approved for various infections but has been withdrawn from the U.S. market and is no longer available. By searching databases such as PubChem and DrugBank [ 26 Combination with synergistic effects on the same pathway: For instance, the combination of Temsirolimus and Nitazoxanide. Both drugs inhibit the mTOR protein, thereby jointly blocking the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, which corresponds to the pathways enriched by differential gene analysis of LAMA3/MET. Combination with synergistic effects on different pathways, for example, the combination of Fisetin and Azithromycin. Azithromycin reduces inflammation by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, corresponding to the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Conversely, Fisetin upregulates HO-1 expression via the p38 MAPK pathway, inhibiting doxorubicin-induced senescence of pulmonary artery endothelial cells. It also inhibits the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells through the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thereby preventing pulmonary artery remodeling. These correspond to the MAPK and Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathways. The specific relationships between the individual drugs and enriched pathways are detailed in Table 4 2.5. Verification The inherent lack of interpretability in deep learning consistently poses challenges for model mechanism inference. In this study, we employed molecular docking simulations to validate the mechanisms of high-synergy drug combinations, enhancing the interpretability of synergistic effects in drug combinations and further elucidating the advantages of dual-drug systems. To validate the efficacy of our model, we conducted a literature review for the top ten predicted drug combinations. Based on the model’s scoring system, we identified a novel senolytic drug combination, Temsirolimus + Nitazoxanide, with the highest score. We performed molecular docking simulations to validate the interaction further and confirm its synergistic potential. 2.6. Molecular Docking Verification We simulated the docking of the highest-scoring drug combination predicted by the model: Temsirolimus + Nitazoxanide on the same target. The docking results indicated that the binding sites of these two compounds on the mTOR target were highly similar. In the context of the dynamic structure of the three-dimensional conformation of the protein, this drug combination demonstrates a broader binding range for FKBP12 in mTORC1 compared to Temsirolimus alone. Temsirolimus is a prodrug of rapamycin that is rapidly converted to its active form by cytochrome CYP 4503A4/5 in the bone marrow. It exhibits superior chemical stability and solubility compared with rapamycin. Its active component, rapamycin, is lipophilic and can permeate the cell membrane to bind to the intracellular receptor FKBP-12 (FK506-binding protein 12 kDa) [ 44 We performed the molecular docking simulations to verify the binding modes of Temsirolimus and Nitazoxanide with the mTOR protein. The structures of the Temsirolimus and Nitazoxanide compounds were extracted from PDB codes: 7SQ9 and 3V35, respectively. The mTOR protein structure was obtained from PDB code: 7PED. The protein was pre-processed using AutoDock Tools (ADT) by removing water molecules and adding hydrogen atoms. Simulated docking of the drugs with mTOR protein was performed using AutoDock Vina (v1.2.5) [ 45 46 Figure 3 Table 5 The root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) measures the relative conformational distance from the most favorable mode. A more negative binding affinity indicates a stronger and more stable interaction between the drug and the receptor. Among the docking results, mode 1 demonstrated the lowest binding affinity (−7.259 kcal/mol), signifying the most optimal binding conformation. Consequently, mode 1 was selected as the reference mode, with its RMSD lower and upper bound values set to zero. For other docking modes, modes 2–3 and 5–10 exhibited relatively high RMSD values (14.52 Å–23.67 Å) compared to the reference mode, suggesting significant spatial deviations from the optimal conformation and, consequently, lower reference significance. In contrast, mode 4 displayed an RMSD range of 3.092 Å–8.357 Å, indicating structural similarity to the best mode, with a corresponding binding affinity of −6.494 kcal/mol. The binding free energies for docking modes 1 and 4 fell within the range of −7.259 kcal/mol to −6.494 kcal/mol, suggesting that the binding conformation of nitazoxanide with mTOR at a certain binding site (as illustrated in Figure 3 2.7. Literature Verification A comprehensive literature review revealed that certain combinations listed in Table 3 24 Similarly, the combined treatment of Canthardin and ABT-737, with a predicted synergistic score of 9.70, was explored by Ren and colleagues [ 14 47 The specific action mechanisms involve NCTD promoting the mitochondrial translocation of Parkin, leading to changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as inducing the accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and blocking autophagic flux, thereby regulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins. The combination of Finasteride and Azithromycin has been shown to have a predicted synergistic score of 9.64. Shao and colleagues [ 25 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Youth-Old Age Differential Gene Expression Dataset Microarray data for this study were retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) with accession numbers GSE72815 GSE141595 GSE72815 13 GSE141595 12 3.2. Senolytics Dataset We obtained part of our single-drug dataset from Smer-Barreto [ 48 Senolytic in Table 6 3.3. Aging-Related Target Gene Dataset The target genes were selected from the following six sources: (1) From the differential gene analysis of GSE72815 (2) From the differential gene analysis of GSE141595 (3) The Human Ageing Genomic Resources (HAGR) database [ 64 https://www.genomics.senescence.info/genes/index.html https://www.genomics.senescence.info/genes/human_genes.zip (4) The latest stable version of the LongevityMap [ 65 https://www.genomics.senescence.info/longevity/ https://www.genomics.senescence.info/longevity/longevity_genes.zip (5) A list of genes associated with cellular senescence was obtained from the CellAge database26 ( https://genomics.senescence.info/cells/ https://genomics.senescence.info/cells/cellAge.zip (6) From the Aging Atlas database [ 66 The total number of gene entries under these six approaches was 2566. After removing duplicate entries, 1769 entries remained for analysis. Finally, gene ID conversion was performed, and entries that could not be converted were removed, resulting in the final selection of 1624 target genes ( Figure 4 Figure 4 3.4. Senolytics Combination Efficacy Prediction Model Regarding model prediction, we introduced SenolyticSynergy ( Figure 5 67 The training set collects 330,917 drug combinations from the DrugComb database consisting of 354 single drugs and 170 cell lines with S synergy scores [ 68 A 1953 senolytic combinations used for prediction were also subjected to feature fusion and standardization, and the corresponding synergy scores of each combination were predicted by the SenolyticSynergy model. Meanwhile, we further filtered out 190 cases of senolytic combinations in which all single drugs appeared in the training set. We selected those combinations with synergy scores greater than 8 as the final output, based on the theory of Lin et al. that the training set contained single drugs within the prediction set that improved the accuracy of synergy prediction of drug combinations (40% to 90%) [ 69 4. Conclusions This study, which uses differential genes associated with aging as the core entry point, thoroughly investigates the intricate relationships between senolytic drugs and apoptosis-related pathways. By integrating multi-omics analysis with advanced deep learning models, we have successfully applied a multi-drug combination prediction model that specifically evaluates the efficacy of senescent cell clearance. Based on this robust foundation, we have constructed a high-confidence senolytic drug combination database for predictive purposes, led by the combination of temsirolimus and nitazoxanide. The predicted results have been partially validated through extensive experimental literature data and molecular docking simulation calculations. This work provides a novel perspective on the diversity of clinical drug use, offers a potential solution to the challenge of limited combinatorial therapies in the clinical application of senolytic drugs, and may provide valuable insights into personalized aging prevention strategies. Since the analytical workflow in this study involved performing differential expression analysis separately on GSE72815 GSE141595 Further experimental validation must take into account additional clinical considerations, such as dosage optimization and potential toxicity arising from drug combinations. We hope that research teams with qualifications for conducting human clinical trials will take particular interest in the top three ranked drug combinations identified in this study. Regarding future model improvements, graph-based approaches and deep ensemble learning techniques may be explored to enhance predictive performance further.
