This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/386969-non-hodgkins-lymphoma-in-pregnancy-a-report-of-a-rare-case Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is a rare diagnosis observed in pregnant women. It can present as B-cell and T-cell lymphomas. It can be a diagnostic challenge in pregnant women, due to overlapping clinical features such as weight loss and fatigue, similar to pregnancy. It can be managed either by immediate intervention in aggressive cases or after postpartum if indolent. We present the case of a 30-year-old woman at 32 weeks of gestation, presenting with a painless progressive swelling over the left side of her neck. It was later diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and successfully managed by R-CHOP chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone). lymphoma non-hodgkin's lymphoma pregnancy malignancies r-chop chemotherapy slow-growing tumors pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of lymphoid malignancies that rarely occur during pregnancy, with an estimated incidence of one in 6,000 pregnancies [ 1 2 3 Helicobacter pylori 4 5 6 7 Case presentation A 30-year-old woman, G2P1, at 32 weeks of gestation, presented with a progressively enlarging, painless swelling in the left side of her neck for six weeks. The swelling was insidious in onset and progressively increasing in size. She also reported mild fatigue and intermittent low-grade fever but denied any significant weight loss, night sweats, or cough. Her antenatal history was otherwise unremarkable, and routine obstetric scans had shown normal fetal growth and well-being. She had no prior history of tuberculosis, autoimmune diseases, or malignancy, and there was no significant family history. On physical examination, the patient was afebrile, with stable vital signs. Local examination revealed multiple, firm, non-tender, mobile lymph nodes in the left cervical region (levels 2 and 3), the largest measuring 4.0 × 3.0 cm. An extensive differential workup was limited antenatally due to fetal safety. Basic laboratory tests, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and neck ultrasound with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) were performed to exclude common causes such as tuberculosis and reactive lymphadenopathy. Definitive excision biopsy with immunohistochemistry postpartum confirmed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and ruled out other differentials. There were no palpable axillary or inguinal lymph nodes. Abdominal examination showed a gravid uterus consistent with 32 weeks of gestation, with cephalic presentation and regular fetal movements. Cardiotocography showed a reactive fetal heart pattern. Initial laboratory investigations revealed mild anemia (hemoglobin: 10.2 g/dL), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH: 640 U/L), and a normal leucocyte count. Liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 52 mm/hour. Obstetric ultrasound showed a single live intrauterine fetus in cephalic presentation with appropriate growth parameters and normal amniotic fluid index. Due to gestational age and concern for fetal safety, a high-resolution ultrasound of the neck was performed, revealing multiple enlarged, hypoechoic lymph nodes with loss of fatty hilum. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was done for the patient, and it was inconclusive. Excision and biopsy were planned for the patient post-delivery (Figure 1 Figure 1 Excisional biopsy of an enlarged level 2a cervical lymph node for suspected non-Hodgkin's lymphoma The laboratory results of the patient are shown in Table 1 Table 1 Blood test results of the pregnant patient diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma g/dL: grams per deciliter, μL: microliter, %: percent, U/L: unit/liter, mm/hour: millimeters per hour WBC: white blood cell, LDH: lactate dehydrogenase, ESR: erythrocyte sedimentation rate Laboratory parameter Patient value Normal value Hemoglobin (g/dL) 8.2 12-16 WBC count (cells/μL) 18,200 4,500-11,000 Lymphocytes (%) 56 20-40 Platelets (cells/μL) 95,000 150,000-450,000 LDH (U/L) 920 135-275 ESR (mm/hr) 85 0-20 Given the late third trimester, absence of aggressive systemic symptoms, and stable fetal and maternal conditions, chemotherapy was deferred until delivery. The patient was closely monitored until 36 weeks, at which point she underwent an elective lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) under spinal anesthesia. A healthy female infant weighing 2.8 kg was delivered with APGAR scores of 9 and 10 at one and five minutes, respectively. Postpartum recovery was uneventful. One week after the delivery, the patient underwent an excision biopsy of the cervical lymph node under local anesthesia. Histopathology revealed diffuse effacement of nodal architecture with sheets of large atypical lymphoid cells, and immunohistochemistry was positive for CD20, CD10, and BCL6, with a high Ki-67 index, consistent with diffuse large B-cell (germinal center B-cell-like (GCB)) subtype. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) imaging of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed stage 2 disease involving cervical and mediastinal lymph nodes. Bone marrow biopsy was negative. The patient was started on R-CHOP chemotherapy (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone). At present, she has completed two cycles of chemotherapy and is tolerating well. Discussion Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma encompasses a heterogeneous group of malignancies, commonly arising from lymphocytes. These malignancies widely vary in their clinical behavior and aggressiveness. It can be a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge when presented in pregnant women, attributed to physiological challenges during pregnancy [ 8 9 9 10 Conclusions Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma diagnosis can be challenging in pregnant women. It requires multidisciplinary management involving oncologists, neonatologists, obstetricians, and hematologists for optimal outcomes. Therapy can be initiated in aggressive cases with multi-agent regimens such as R-CHOP with postponement until delivery in non-aggressive cases.
