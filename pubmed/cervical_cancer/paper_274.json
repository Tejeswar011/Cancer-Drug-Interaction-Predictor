Therefore, he developed a lower esophageal-GEJ stricture and underwent multiple endoscopic dilatations. Computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax and abdomen along with biopsies at the stricture site were negative for tumor recurrence. A fully covered esophageal self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) was placed because of the refractory nature of the stricture; however, this corrective attempt failed. He had also undergone a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube insertion to maintain adequate nutrition 1 year prior. He received continuous PEG feeds and was lost for follow-up for approximately 6 months. The patient presented to our outpatient clinic with absolute dysphagia that had persisted for 3 weeks. An upper gastrointestinal (UGI) endoscopy was performed using an Olympus GIF-H190 gastroscope and showed a completed esophageal obstruction at 38 cm from the upper incisors ( Fig. 1A Fig. 1B Fig. 1C Fig. 2A B Fig. 2C Fig. 2D Fig. 2E F Fig. 3A Fig. 3B Fig. 3C CEO is an uncommon complication that often occurs because of high-dose radiation for head and neck or esophageal malignancies. In rare cases, even benign esophageal diseases can lead to CEO. The underlying pathology is a progressive chronic inflammatory state with subsequent fibrosis and collagen deposition secondary to radiation exposure. This results in a connective tissue membrane that reduces the esophageal lumen frequently. 5 In the paper, van Twisk et al. 4 6 7 8 9 Blind antegrade endoscopic puncture or dilation is generally not performed owing to the risk of complications such as perforations and fistula. This risk is even higher in the neck and cervical esophagus as the region is surrounded by critical structures. 10 Although a blind antegrade puncture and dilatation of the CEO are not typically performed, antegrade puncture can be safely performed in limited cases. Patients with a distal CEO and a short segment obstruction (<1 cm), as confirmed by the length between the ante-retrograde scopes and relatively thinner septum, which is evident by transillumination, are possible candidates for attempting a safe antegrade puncture. In addition, this approach can be performed in a few selected groups of patients at centers without an EUS scope or competency. Informed consent was obtained for this case report.
