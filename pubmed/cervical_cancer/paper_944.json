Retinoblastoma (RB) immunotherapy represents a paradigm shift in managing this aggressive pediatric eye cancer, overcoming limitations of conventional therapies. Recent breakthroughs reveal how circular RNAs (circRNAs) critically modulate the tumor-immune microenvironment: oncogenic circRNAs promote immune evasion by upregulating PD-L1 and suppressing T cell activity, while tumor-suppressive circRNAs such as circMKLN1 enhance antigen presentation and cytotoxic responses. The convergence of circRNA biology with immunotherapy has yielded innovative strategies, including circRNA-targeted immune checkpoint blockade to reverse T cell exhaustion, circRNA-engineered CAR-T cells with improved tumor homing and persistence, and circRNA-based oncolytic viruses that stimulate immunogenic cell death. Notably, exosomal circRNAs serve dual roles as both immune modulators and minimally invasive biomarkers for predicting immunotherapy response. While preclinical studies demonstrate remarkable synergy between circRNA inhibition and PD-1/CTLA-4 blockade in RB models, clinical translation requires optimization of delivery systems and combinatorial regimens. This review summarizes the latest evidence positioning circRNAs as central regulators of anti-tumor immunity and provides a strategic roadmap for the integration of circRNA-based approaches in precision immunotherapy for RB. retinoblastoma circular RNAs tumor metastasis drug resistance biomarkers immunotherapy The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

They primarily arise through back-splicing of precursor transcripts ( 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 2.2 Oncogenic circRNAs 2.2.1 circ-0000527 and circ-0000034 circ-0000527, also known as circ-FAM158A, is the sole circular RNA transcribed from the FAM158A gene and is notably overexpressed in RB ( 22 22 24 25 26 27 22 24 circ-0000034, also referred to as circ-001787 or circDHDDS, is derived from the DHDDS gene, mutations in which are linked to retinitis pigmentosa ( 28 29 30 31 32 31 29 28 2.2.2 circ-0075804 circ-0075804, a circular RNA originating from the E2F3 gene located on chromosome 6, plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cell cycle-associated genes through its direct interaction with the RB protein ( 33 34 35 35 36 36 37 38 2.2.3 Other oncogenic circRNAs In addition to the aforementioned circRNAs, several others have emerged as significant players in the pathogenesis of RB. These include circRNF20, circ-ODC1, circ-0099198, circROBO1, and circ-0000989, all of which have been implicated in RB tumorigenesis ( 39 40 41 39 42 43 44 40 in vitro in vivo 45 46 2.3 Tumor-suppressive circRNAs 2.3.1 circMKLN1 circMKLN1, a circular RNA derived from the MKLN1 gene, plays a critical role in the autophagic processes underlying diabetic retinopathy, where it has been shown to promote neovascularization ( 47 48 49 50 49 49 51 52 2.3.2 circ-0001649 circ-0001649, a transcriptional product derived from the DNA repair gene SHPRH, as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating tumorigenesis via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway ( 53 54 in vitro in vivo 55 56 57 58 2.3.3 circ-0093996 and circCUL2 circ-0093996 is derived from the TET1 gene which functions as a pivotal tumor suppressor gene ( 59 60 61 61 62 62 63 2.4 circRNAs in RB drug resistance Drug resistance in RB involves complex molecular mechanisms, including circRNA-mediated regulation of oncogenic pathways. circ-0000527, circ-0000034, and circ-0093996 promote chemoresistance via the Wnt/β-catenin axis, while circODC1 and circRNF20 suppress resistance by targeting SKP2 and PAX6, respectively. In vivo 29 31 47 64 3 Prospects of circRNAs in the diagnosis and treatment of RB 3.1 circRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers for RB Current clinical diagnosis of RB relies heavily on imaging techniques such as MRI, CT, and B-scan ultrasonography ( 65 66 67 68 34 55 69 70 71 39 3.2 circRNAs as therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers in RB circRNAs have emerged as potential biomarkers in RB ( 72 28 73 74 75 39 in vivo 49 76  Figure 1 Figure 1 The regulatory role of circRNAs in retinoblastoma progression. Diagram illustrating the roles of oncogenic and tumor-suppressive circular RNAs (circRNAs) in retinoblastoma. Oncogenic circRNAs are shown to promote tumor progression, drug resistance, and metastasis through pathways like Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/AKT. Tumor-suppressive circRNAs inhibit these processes via mechanisms such as the AKT/mTOR pathway. The image also mentions specific circRNAs and their interactions with miRNAs, apoptotic pathways, and other cellular processes, summarizing the complex regulatory network involved in retinoblastoma development and resistance. 4 Advances in immunotherapy Recent advances in immunotherapy have transformed the therapeutic landscape of RB, offering strategies that harness and redirect immune responses against tumor cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 blockers, restore cytotoxic T cell–mediated surveillance by disrupting inhibitory signals within the tumor microenvironment (TME), and have shown promising efficacy in RB, where PD-L1 is upregulated and co-expression of PD-1/CTLA-4 correlates with poor prognosis ( 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 Recent studies have begun to elucidate how circRNAs shape the immunological landscape of RB. Oncogenic circRNAs such as circ-0136666 and circ-0000512 promote immune escape by upregulating PD-L1 expression, either directly or via modulation of Wnt/β-catenin and ROCK1 pathways, which are known to suppress antigen presentation and impair CD8 + 92 93 + 49 52 94 95 96 97 98 5 Conclusion Retinoblastoma therapy has entered a transformative era, driven by advances in circRNA biology and immunotherapeutic innovation. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), owing to their stability and tissue specificity, have emerged as critical regulators of tumorigenesis, chemoresistance, and metastatic progression. Moreover, their potential for non-invasive diagnostics, particularly through exosomal detection (circRNF20), offers new opportunities for early detection and monitoring. In parallel, immunotherapies including checkpoint inhibitors, CAR-T cells, and oncolytic viruses are overcoming the limitations of traditional therapies by harnessing immune-mediated tumor clearance and facilitating durable remission. Despite these exciting developments, several knowledge gaps remain before clinical translation. Key challenges include optimizing in vivo Author contributions XW: Writing – original draft.
