To date, tens of thousands of circRNAs have been identified in humans, many of which have been implicated in various diseases, including viral infections and metabolic disorders. Particularly, circRNAs in cancer have garnered considerable attention due to their involvement in tumorigenesis through diverse molecular mechanisms. For instance, circPVT1 serves as a ceRNA to sponge miR-181a-2-3p, thus stabilizing ESR1 mRNA and promoting the genesis of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer 3 4 + 5 6 Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) is a pivotal RNA-binding protein (RBP) that plays a significant role in tumorigenesis and the creation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment 7 8 9 10 11 13 14 15 16 17 Our study reveals that hsa_circ_0058495 plays a crucial role in PDAC tumorigenesis and progression. We found that hsa_circ_0058495 directly interacts with IGF2BP2, suppressing its ubiquitination-mediated degradation by TRIM25. This interaction enables IGF2BP2 to promote tumor progression by stabilizing MEKK1 mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner and activating the p-ERK1/2 pathway. Notably, exosomal hsa_circ_0058495 also positively regulates M2 macrophage polarization, further contributing to PDAC development. Our findings highlight the essential role of hsa_circ_0058495 in PDAC and identify it as a potential therapeutic target for this devastating disease. Results Hsa_circ_0058495 is upregulated in PDAC To explore the role of circRNAs in PDAC, we analyzed the expression profiles of circRNAs in PDAC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 289 and 686 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in the GSE79634 GSE69362 2 FC 1 Table S1 via 1 Table S2 GSE79634 GSE69362 1 1 1 in situ 1 vs. Figure S1 1 1 Figure S1 To investigate the clinical relevance of hsa_circ_0058495 in PDAC, we performed a comprehensive clinicopathological analysis using tissue specimens from 70 PDAC patients. Based on quantitative expression profiling, the cohort was stratified into two groups: high hsa_circ_0058495 expression (n = 35) and low hsa_circ_0058495 expression (n = 35). Statistical analysis revealed significant associations between elevated hsa_circ_0058495 expression and several aggressive pathological features, including vascular invasion (p = 0.013), perineural invasion (p = 0.026), advanced T classification (p = 0.001), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.004), and higher TNM stage (p = 0.038). However, no significant correlations were observed between hsa_circ_0058495 expression levels and demographic parameters (age, gender) or tumor characteristics (anatomical location, histological differentiation grade) (Table 1 Hsa_circ_0058495 interacts with IGF2BP2 and upregulates the expression of IGF2BP2 Hsa_circ_0058495 is a circular non-coding RNA that originates from exons 4-8 of the RHBDD1 http://www.circbase.org https://circinteractome.nia.nih.gov/ Figure S1 2 2 2 2 2 CircRNAs are known to exert their functional effects through protein interactions and the regulation of complex protein modifications. To elucidate the protein-hsa_circ_0058495 interactome, we employed an RNA pull-down and mass spectrometry (MS) proteomics analysis. This approach identified 350 proteins that interacted with hsa_circ_0058495. Notably, IGF2BP2 was the only protein that overlapped with the hsa_circ_0058495-binding proteins predicted by circinteractome ( Table S3 2 https://www.uniprot.org Figure S1 2 2 To further confirm this interaction, RNA pull-down assay was performed using biotin-labeled hsa_circ_0058495 truncated probes generated by T7 in vitro http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at//cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi 2 2 2 2 Figure S1 Hsa_circ_0058495 stabilizes IGF2BP2 protein by inhibiting autophagy-lysosome mediated degradation To further validate whether hsa_circ_0058495 mediated the upregulation of IGF2BP2 by suppressing its degradation, we treated cells transfected with negative control, hsa_circ_0058495 knockdown, or overexpression constructs with cycloheximide (CHX, a translation inhibitor). The results showed that hsa_circ_0058495 prolonged the half-life of IGF2BP2 protein (Figure 3 3 3 3 The autophagy process encompasses a series of consecutive events: initiation, nucleation, expansion, fusion, and cargo degradation. To understand how hsa_circ_0058495 regulated autophagy, we sought to pinpoint the specific step within this cascade that was suppressed by hsa_circ_0058495. During autophagic vesicle maturation, autophagosomes fused with lysosomes to form autolysosomes containing active proteases. We used an mRFP-GFP tandem fluorescent-tagged LC3 reporter to assess the abundance of autophagosomes and autolysosomes. The mRFP fluorophore was more tolerant to a decrease in pH than GFP; therefore, autophagosomes were labeled with both GFP and mRFP. After fusing with lysosomes, autolysosomes became acidic and GFP fluorescence was quenched. The results showed that hsa_circ_0058495 caused a dramatic decline in the number of both autophagosomes (mRFP + + + - 3 3 Hsa_circ_0058495 suppressed ubiquitination degradation of IGF2BP2 protein by hindering the combination of TRIM25 with IGF2BP2 As shown in Figure 3 3 4 As shown in Fig. 2 4 To investigate whether hsa_circ_0058495 suppressed IGF2BP2 ubiquitination by competitively blocking the binding sites for E3 ligases on IGF2BP2, we performed IP- MS in 293T cells transfected with HA-IGF2BP2 or HA-NC. This analysis identified a total of 280 proteins associated with IGF2BP2, among which, four E3 ligases TRIM29, PML, RSF1, and TRIM25 were identified ( Table S4 4 4 To delineate the specific domains of IGF2BP2 that were targeted by TRIM25 for ubiquitination and that also interacted with hsa_circ_0058495, we co-transfected the indicated truncated IGF2BP2 vectors and an HA-Ub plasmid into 293T cells, which were then treated with MG132. IP analysis revealed that the KH3-4 domains were significantly ubiquitinated by TRIM25, whereas the RRM1-2 and KH1-2 domains were not (Figure 4 4 4 Hsa_circ_0058495 promotes the proliferation and invasion of PDAC cells in vitro in vivo To investigate the role of hsa_circ_0058495 in PDAC progression, we constructed siRNAs targeting hsa_circ_0058495 (si-0058495) to knockdown its expression and an over-expression plasmid (pLC5-0058495) to ectopically express hsa_circ_0058495. The efficiency of hsa_circ_0058495 knockdown and overexpression was confirmed in BxPC3 and PANC1 cells ( Figure S1 in vitro 5 Figure S1 5 5 Figure S1 For the in vivo G12D-/+ R172H-/+ Figure S2 18 18 Table S5 5 5 5 5 Figure S2 In addition, to validate whether the tumor-promotion effect of hsa_circ_0058495 was correlated with the immune microenvironment, we constructed orthotopic PDAC model in immunocompetent mice (C57BL/6) and immunodeficient mice (NOD-SCID) by injecting Pan02 cells into the subcapsular region of the pancreas. Following exosomes injection from tail veins twice a week for 6 weeks, the tumors were resected and the volume and weight of tumor lesions were analyzed. H&E staining was also performed. The results showed that the tumors from the hsa_circ_0058495-overexpressing exosomes-treated groups were significantly larger than those from control group in both of immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice, suggesting that hsa_circ_0058495 promoted the orthotopic tumorigenicity of PDAC cells independently from immune status ( Figure S2 Figure S2 The patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model was also conducted to further verify the effect of hsa_circ_0058495 on humanized PDAC. Patient-derived PDAC tissue blocks were implanted subcutaneously in the flank of Balb/c nude mice and the tumor sizes were recorded every 3 days. After treatment with exosomes through tail veins twice a week for 6 weeks, the tumors were resected and the volume and weight of tumor lesions were analyzed ( Figure S3 Figure S3 Figure S3 in vitro in vivo. Hsa_circ_0058495/IGF2BP2 promotes the activation of the ERK pathway by stabilizing MEKK1 mRNA in an m6A-dependent manner To investigate whether IGF2BP2 contributed to PDAC progression through its role as an m6A reader, we performed transcriptome sequencing of RIP samples enriched with an IGF2BP2 antibody. We also analyzed a dataset of RNA-sequencing comparing METTL3-depleted to wildtype THP-1 cells 18 19 20 Table S6 Finally, this analysis identified MEKK1 (also known as MAP3K1), a crucial kinase in the MAPK cascade, as the potential target of IGF2BP2. Next, to clarify the impact of IGF2BP2 on MEKK1 expression, the mRNA level of MEKK1 was detected after knockdown or overexpression of IGF2BP2. The RT-qPCR results demonstrated that IGF2BP2 positively regulated the mRNA levels of MEKK1 in both PANC1 and BxPC3 cells (Figure 6 6 6 http://www.cuilab.cn/sramp 6 6 Figure S3 To directly establish hsa_circ_0058495's upstream regulatory role in the IGF2BP2-MEKK1 axis, the Western blot assay was firstly performed in BxPC3 cells after overexpression or knockdown of hsa_circ_0058495. The results showed that hsa_circ_0058495 promoted the expression of IGF2BP2, MEKK1 and downstream phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Figure 6 6 Exosomes-delivered hsa_circ_0058495 promotes M2 polarization of macrophages Exosomes secreted by tumor cells play a vital role in shaping the TME, in part by inducing the differentiation of immune cells. These nanovesicles facilitate the transfer of non-coding RNAs between cells, thereby modulating the immune response. As shown in Figure 1 Figure S4 Figure S4 Figure S4 Figure S4 Figure S4 Figure S4 Given that IGF2BP2 was upregulated in M2 macrophages and that hsa_circ_0058495 regulated IGF2BP2, we investigated whether hsa_circ_0058495 influenced macrophage polarization after being selectively packaged into PDAC-derived exosomes. First of all, Western blot, RT-qPCR and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that hsa_circ_0058495 enhanced M2 macrophage polarization by detecting the markers of M1 (iNOS, IL-1β, CD86, TNF-α and CD80) and M2 (Arg1, IL-10, CD206, CCL13 and TGF-β) ( Figure S5 Figure S6 Considering that IGF2BP2 was found to function by activating of the MEKK1 pathway, we further investigated the potential involvement of MEKK1 in the polarization of macrophages by transfecting with si-NC or si-MEKK1, with stimulating by exosomes derived from BxPC3 cells overexpressed hsa_circ_0058495 or not. These findings indicated that the knockdown of MEKK1 suppressed exosomal hsa_circ_0058495-induced M2 polarization ( Figure S6 Figure S6 Single-cell transcriptomic characterization of PDAC TME stratified by hsa_circ_0058495 expression To elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which hsa_circ_0058495 modulated the TME in PDAC, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on five freshly resected PDAC tumor specimens obtained from distinct patients (designated P1-P5). RT-qPCR was performed to quantify hsa_circ_0058495 expression levels, which enabled us to stratify the samples into two cohorts: a low-expression group (P1 and P5) and a high-expression group (P2, P3, and P4) ( Figure S7 7 7 Cell cluster annotation was performed through differential expression analysis to identify cluster-specific marker genes (Figure 7 SPP1 21 KRT19 22 APOE KRT17 7 Given our previous in vitro 7 IL1B G0S2 EREG CCL18 SELENOP IGHG1 7 Figure S7 To delineate the developmental trajectory of macrophage polarization in PDAC, we performed pseudotemporal ordering analysis. The trajectory reconstruction revealed two distinct differentiation pathways corresponding to M1 and M2 macrophage lineages (Figure 7 23 MKI67 UBE2C 7 The scRNA-seq analysis revealed that elevated expression of hsa_circ_0058495 was associated with a significant expansion of M2 macrophage polarization within the TME of PDAC, accompanied by dynamic regulation of key genes ( MKI67 UBE2C EIF4A3 promotes the biosynthesis of hsa_circ_0058495 Recent research has revealed a crucial role for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the biogenesis of exon-derived circRNAs. Specifically, RBPs have been shown to interact with the flanking sequences of circRNA-generating exons in pre-mRNA, facilitating the formation of circRNAs. We investigated this possibility using the Circinteractome and Starbase 3.0 databases, which predicted that EIF4A3 binds to RHBDD1 pre-mRNA in both intron3 and intron8 ( Figure S7 Figure S7 Figure S7 Figure S8 Figure S7 Figure S8 Based on the known role of hsa_circ_0058495 in promoting PDAC proliferation, we hypothesized that EIF4A3 contributed to PDAC progression by enhancing hsa_circ_0058495 biogenesis. To test this, we performed a CCK8 assay in PANC1 cells transfected with si-EIF4A3 or pLVX-EIF4A3. The results showed that EIF4A3 facilitated tumor cell growth ( Figure S8 Figure S8 Discussion Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as central regulators in the intricate network of cancer biology. Accumulating evidence underscores their critical roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis, influencing diverse cellular processes such as the maintenance of cancer stemness, angiogenesis, apoptosis and autophagy, as well as tumor invasion and metastatic dissemination 24 26 While confirming RHBDD1 gene upregulation in PDAC, our analysis reveals no significant correlation between RHBDD1 levels and patient prognosis. This suggests that bulk transcriptional activity at the RHBDD1 locus is neither a primary driver of aggressive PDAC behavior nor a robust prognostic indicator. However, there may exist some potential contributing factors led to the insignificance, such as the statistical power limitations inherent in the available TCGA-PAAD sample size and possible cohort heterogeneity, which needs future validation in larger independent cohorts. Critically, our findings establish hsa_circ_0058495, a circular RNA isoform derived from RHBDD1 pre-mRNA as a potent oncogenic effector. Hsa_circ_0058495 promotes key malignant phenotypes, including tumor cell proliferation and invasion, and functions as a strong independent prognostic biomarker predictive of poorer survival. This evidence confirms that the hsa_circ_0058495 plays its own unique biological role, independent from its parental gene RHBDD1 Several RBPs have been found to regulate the biogenesis of circRNAs, such as QKI and EIF4A3 27 28 29 30 14 28 31 32 The present study demonstrates that EIF4A3 binds to introns in the flanking regions of hsa_circ_0058495-forming exon 4-8 of RHBDD1 pre-mRNA to promote the generation of hsa_circ_0058495. Our study provides insights into the effects of EIF4A3-regulated circRNA on the development of PDAC. Most studies have focused on the role of circRNAs as miRNA sponges or scaffolds. For example, hsa_circ_001783 promotes breast cancer by sponging miR-200c-3p 33 34 35 36 37 N 6 38 39 17 40 41 Exosomes play a pivotal role in facilitating tumor progression by serving as versatile nanocarriers that transport biological cargos including proteins, lipids, RNAs, and DNAs, between cancer cells and immune cells within the TME 42 43 44 + 5 45 46 47 48 We leverage the KPC mouse model which accurately mirrors human pancreatic cancer biology through targeted mutations in Kras Trp53 in vivo in vivo In conclusion, our study reveals that hsa_circ_0058495 acts as an oncogene in PDAC, exerting its tumorigenic effects through two distinct mechanisms: firstly, by stabilizing IGF2BP2/MEKK1 and activating the p-ERK1/2 signaling pathway, and secondly, by promoting M2 macrophage polarization, thereby facilitating immune evasion. Our findings provide insights into the critical roles of hsa_circ_0058495 in PDAC progression and highlight its potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for PDAC. Methods Patients and tissue specimen collection The PDAC tissues from patients who underwent surgery at The First Hospital of Jilin University between August 2019 and August 2022 were chosen. The postoperative pathological reports, independently confirmed by two experienced pathologists, verified the presence of PDAC. The tissues were immediately snap-frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen at -80 °C following dissection. The study protocol was approved by the ethics review board of The First Hospital of Jilin University. We have obtained written informed consent from all study participants.

HPDE6C7 and BxPC3 cell lines were cultivated in 1640 medium (11875119, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (04-001-1ACS, BI) and 2% Penicillin-Streptomycin Solution. SW1990 cells were cultivated in DMEM-F12 medium (11320033, Thermo-Fisher) while PANC1 and 293T cells in DMEM medium (11965092, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% Penicillin-Streptomycin Solution. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in an environment containing 5% carbon dioxide. Microarray analysis The circRNA microarray analysis of exosomes was conducted by RIOBIO (Guangzhou). The raw sequencing dataset GSE79634 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo 2 Fold Change 2 FC GSE79634 RNase R treatment A total of 2 μg RNA was treated with 2 U/μg Rnase R (M0100S, NEB) at 37 °C for 15 minutes. Then the expression of hsa_circ_0058495 and RHBDD1 mRNA was tested by RT-qPCR. Actinomycin D assay Cells were seeded onto six-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 5 Vector construction The linear hsa_circ_0058495 was amplified via PCR from 293T cell lines. The primer sequences are presented in the Supplementary Table. Subsequently, it was introduced into the pLC5-ciR vector provided by Geenseed Biotech Co. The pLC5-0058495 was subsequently encapsulated into lentivirus for achieving stable transfection. The EIF4A3 overexpression vector was created by utilizing the pLVX-puro vector. The entire length of IGF2BP2 and its truncated versions, known as RRM1-2, KH1-2, and KH3-4, were inserted into the pLVX-puro vector. The linear hsa_circ_0058495 mutations were generated by PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (M0530L, NEB) from the pLC5-0058495 vector and inserted into pLC5-ciR vector using the In-Fusion HD cloning kit (639649, Clontech). The si-0058495, si-IGF2BP2, and si-EIF4A3 were acquired from JTS bio (Wuhan). Transfection A total of 1 × 10 5 RT-PCR and RT-qPCR The RNA extraction was performed using TRIzol (15596-018, Invitrogen) and the RNA concentration was determined using Nanodrop spectrophotometer. The reverse transcriptase was acquired from Takara (2680A) and the RT-qPCR procedure to generate cDNA was carried out using the BIO-RAD iCYCLER. The SYBR-Green dye was acquired from Takara (RR820A). Subsequently, the fluorescence quantification reaction in real time was observed using an MX-3000 system. The relative expression levels of the target RNAs were determined using the 2^-ΔΔ CT Western blot analysis The RIPA lysis buffer (89900) and the protease inhibitor cocktail (78429) were obtained from Thermo-Fisher. Each sampling hole was loaded with 40 µg of protein lysate, and separation was performed using a 10% SDS-PAGE. Subsequently, the protein was deposited onto a PVDF membrane and incubated overnight with the following primary antibodies at 4 ℃: anti-IGF2BP2 antibody (14672, CST), anti-EIF4A3 antibody (bs-14548R, Bioss), MAPK Family antibody sampler kit (9926, CST), phospho-MAPK family antibody sampler kit (9910, CST), anti-ubiquitin antibody (ab134953, Abcam), anti-K48 antibody (4289, CST), anti-Flag antibody (66008-4-Ig, Proteintech), anti-HA antibody (51064-2-AP, Proteintech), anti-LC3A/B antibody (12741, CST), anti-SQSTM1 antibody (sc-26675, Santa Cruz), anti-TRIM25 antibody (67314-1-Ig, Proteintech), anti-Arginase-1 antibody (16001-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-iNOS antibody (18985-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-CD206 antibody (81525-1-RR, Proteintech), anti-CD86 antibody (13395-1-AP, Proteintech), anti-α-Tubulin antibody (sc-8035, Santa Cruz), anti-β-actin antibody (1030300012, lifespaceo). This was followed by hybridization with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 40 minutes. The immunoreactive signals were detected using a chemiluminescence system (Bio-Rad, United States). Wound healing assay Each well of the six-well plates was seeded with 5 × 10 5 Cell viability assay Cell viability assay was conducted using the cell counting kit-8 (C0038, Beyotime). Each well of the 96-well plates was seeded with 1 × 10 5 EdU assay Fluorescent EdU detection was employed by Cell-Light EdU Apollo 488 In vitro 5 Single-Cell RNA Sequencing and Analysis The scRNA-seq experiments were outsourced to Singleron Biotechnologies (Nanjing, China), utilizing their proprietary GEXSCOPE® platform for high-resolution single-cell profiling. Tumor tissues were enzymatically dissociated into single-cell suspensions using a standardized protocol. Viable cells were isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and processed for scRNA-seq library preparation using the GEXSCOPE® Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Kit. Sequencing was carried out on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform, generating paired-end reads with an average depth of 50,000 reads per cell to ensure robust transcriptomic coverage. Raw sequencing data were processed using Singleron's SCOPE pipline, which included demultiplexing, barcode assignment, and unique molecular identifier (UMI) counting. Cells with fewer than 200 detected genes or more than 6,000 genes were excluded to remove low-quality cells and potential doublets. Additionally, cells with mitochondrial gene content exceeding 20% were filtered out to eliminate stressed or apoptotic cells. RNA pull-down assay The RNA probe was labeled with desulphurization biotin at the 3' end using the Pierce RNA 3' End Desthiobiotinylation Kit RNA (20163, Thermo-Fisher). The biotin-labeled hsa_circ_0058495 probe was acquired from Gema (China). The RNA-pull down experiment was conducted using the Pierce Magnetic RNA-Protein Pull-Down Kit (20164, Thermo-Fisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins interacting with RNA were examined using mass spectrometry and Western blot analysis. RNA immunoprecipitation RNA Immunoprecipitation Kit (P0101, Geenseed, China) was used for RNA immunoprecipitation. 1 × 10 7 Co-immunoprecipitation Co-immunoprecipitation was performed using the Pierce Co-immunoprecipitation Kit (88804, Thermo-Fisher) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were lysed using Pierce IP Lysis Buffer (87788, Thermo-Fisher) and subsequently incubated with protein A/G beads that were conjugated overnight with anti-IGF2BP2 and IgG antibodies at 4 °C. Following several washes, the immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted and analyzed using mass spectrometry and Western blot assay. In vivo The animal study was executed following the approval of the ethics committee of the first hospital of Jilin University. The Kras G12D/+ 172H/+ 3 2 Orthotopic mouse model All animal experimental protocols were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals. C57BL/6 and NOD-SCID mice were injected with Pan02 tumor cell suspensions (5 × 10⁴ to 1 × 10⁵ cells/injection in Matrigel, 354230; Corning) directly into the pancreas, followed by closure of the peritoneum with 5-0 Vicryl sutures and the skin with surgical staples. Tumors were allowed to grow for 2 weeks prior to exosomes treatment. PDX mouse model To generate patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), surgical specimens from primary tumors of the patient were immediately implanted in mice. The tumor was resected from a 71-year-old woman, and the pathological diagnosis revealed a 3.2 × 3 × 2.5 cm pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated, staged as T2N2M0. Fragments of 8 mm3 were implanted into the lower flank of 6-week-old female Balb/c nude mice (SPF biotechnology, China). Animals were housed in laminar flow cabinets under a 12-hour light/dark cycle with unrestricted access to food and water. Established tumors were serially passaged to maintain the models. Flow cytometry The cells were suspended to a density of 1×10 6 ELISA Conditioned media or cellular protein lysates were quantified, and equal protein amounts were loaded per well of a 96-well plate with three technical replicates per biological replicate. ELISA kits specific for human IL-1β, TNF-α, TGF-β, and IL-10 (Invitrogen, A35574, A42898, BMS249-4, and BMS215INST) were used according to manufacturer protocol to quantify cytokines levels. Results were measured by the absorbance of each well using a BioRad microplate reader. Statistical analysis The results were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and between-group differences were assessed for statistical significance using variance analysis followed by unpaired, two-tailed student's test. For comparison among multiple groups, the ANOVA test was used. The Pearson chi-square test was used for testing the differences between categorical variables. Fisher's exact test was used when the number of variables was lower than 5. The statistical analysis was conducted using Prism software (GraphPad Software 9.0) and SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0). In general, P value < 0.05 was considered significant and was indicated as follows: * P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, ****P < 0.0001, ns: no significance.
