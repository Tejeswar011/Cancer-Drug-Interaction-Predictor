Commonly found as a white solid mineral, this inorganic compound possesses distinct properties that make it highly relevant to a broad range of scientific disciplines, including medicine, biochemistry, physiology, and nutrition (Chinthala et al. 2021 2014 2014 2019 2020 2024 2023 Cervical and prostate cancers pose significant public health concerns on a global scale, contributing markedly to cancer-related deaths. Cervical cancer is recognized as the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer among females worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 604,000 new cases of cervical cancer were reported in 2020, with approximately 342,000 associated fatalities (Singh et al. 2022 2004 2023 2021 2010 2019 2023 This research on eco-friendly MgO NPs holds profound significance for the health and well-being of individuals with disabilities. This population experiences well-documented health disparities, including a higher susceptibility to antimicrobial-resistant infections due to frequent medical interventions and compromised immunity (Hetta et al. 2023 2022 2015 2024 In our investigation, orange peel extract was utilized for the biological synthesis of MgO NPs. Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to optimize three significant factors: pH, concentration, and temperature. Then characterize these NPs by Uv, Zeta potential, TEM, FTIR, EDX, XRD, SEM–EDX and DLS. The bio-derived MgO NPs were investigated for their anticancer efficacy, antibacterial and antibiofilm potential, antioxidant activity and as an antidiabetic agent. Materials and methods Orange peel extract (OPE) preparation OPE was sourced from local market (BIM) in Cairo City, Egypt and transported to the laboratory for processing. OPE from fruits without any visible plant disease symptoms then washed via DH 2 2 2022 Phytochemical screening of OPE extract The active constituents in this study were identified using standard, widely accepted phytochemical screening methods. The presence of various phytochemicals was confirmed using established qualitative assays: Wagner’s reagent for alkaloids; Molisch’s test for carbohydrates; Keller-Killiani’s test for cardiac glycosides; alkaline reagent test for flavonoids; ferric chloride test for phenols; precipitation test for phlobatannins; ninhydrin test for proteins; foam test for saponins; Liebermann-Burchard test for steroids; Braymer’s test for tannins; Salkowski’s test for terpenoids; hydrochloric acid (HCl) test for quinones; and glacial acetic acid test for oxalates (Akinlabu et al. 2024 2023 Optimization study Optimization assessment of MgO NPs biosynthesis (general factors) The characteristics related to the OPE and magnesium nitrate, its main nanoparticle component, were adjusted through optimization studies. The impact of different filtrate and precursor solution durations (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 h), precursor concentrations (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mM), pH value (5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), and temperature (20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 °C) were subsequently evaluated using the one-variable-at-a-time (OVAT) approach (Khan et al. 2020 Statistical optimization using central composite design (CCD) Statistical optimization was conducted using RSM. Among the various RSM techniques, the CCD is one of the most widely used and effective approaches for optimization. CCD enables the evaluation of relationships between independent variables and the response in this case, precursor concentration, pH, and temperature. Within the experimental framework, cube points are utilized to model first-order linear effects and interactions, axial points to estimate second-order quadratic effects, and center points to evaluate the curvature of the response surface and determine pure experimental error. Output from the CCD, both numerical and graphical, facilitate the generation of optimization curves that guide the identification of optimal variable settings to enhance the synthesis of MgO NPs. In this study, a two-level, three-factor CCD model was employed. A full factorial CCD was implemented to optimize MgO NPs production. Each response variable obtained from the CCD experiments was modeled using a full quadratic (second-order polynomial) multiple regression approach, considering three continuous independent variables (precursor concentration, pH, and temperature) across various levels. The statistical significance was caaried out via ANOVA foe evaluation the model terms, including linear, quadratic (squared), and interaction effects among the variables (Salem et al. 2024 Validation of the RSM model The response optimizer in the Minitab® DoE package was employed to generate optimization curves and identify the optimal combination of interacting factors for maximizing MgO NP production. The optimization process was guided by individual desirability (d) and composite desirability (D) functions, which evaluate how effectively the predicted settings meet the desired response outcomes on a scale from 0 to 1. The validation was carried via the prediction model, additional confirmation study was conducted under the optimized conditions. All experimental design, data generation, and the Minitab® version 18 (2017) program was used for statistical analyses, supplemented with built-in statistical and graphical analysis tools. Biosynthesis of MgO NPs at optimum condition MgO NPs were synthesized by a green, eco-friendly route utilizing OPE. Specifically, OPE was combined with 5.1 mM magnesium nitrate (Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (Mg(NO 3 2 2 2 2019 2022 Characterization studies of bio generated MgO NPs During the incubation process, the biofabrication of MgO NPs was preliminarily evidenced by an observable color change in the reaction mixture. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrophotometry was employed to monitor the nanoparticle formation using a JENWAY-6305 spectrophotometer across a wavelength range of 200–800 nm. The functional groups on the surface of the synthesized MgO nanoparticles were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer Spectrum Two, USA). The spectrum range was started from 400 to 4000 cm −1 −1 2024 2024b 2025 2023 Anticancer activity The study evaluated two ATCC cancer cell lines HeLa (cervical carcinoma) and PC3 (prostate carcinoma) alongside normal Vero cells. Cells were seeded at 1 × 10 5 2024c 2014 Antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy Agar-based well diffusion technique was used to assess how successfully green generated MgO NPs inhibited the development of harmful bacteria (Saied et al. 2025 2016 Klebsiella pneumonia Bacillus subtilis Staphylococcus aureus Salmonella typhi 1990 MIC of MgO NPs towards the microbial strains was assessed using the broth microdilution technique, following the CLSI guidelines. Two-fold serial dilutions of MgO NPs were prepared to obtain seven concentrations levels (1000 to 15.75 μg/mL). Sterile 96-well microtiter plates were filled with 100 μL of Mueller–Hinton broth (Oxoid) per well. An additional about 100 μL of level dose of MgO NPs was introduced to the wells. Subsequently, 20 μL of a bacterial suspension calibrated to the 0.5 McFarland standard was introduced into each well, except for the negative control, which contained only broth and nanoparticles. Positive control wells were supplemented with bacterial suspension in broth without nanoparticles to confirm microbial viability and medium suitability. The plates were incubated at (37 °C/ 24 h.). After 24 h, the microbial growth was assessed using a microplate reader (STATFAX, USA) (Abbey and Deak 2019 The MgO NPs antibiofilm efficacy toward S. aureus E. coli 2018 2025 Antioxidant capacity via DPPH radical scavenging procedure For the antioxidant assessment, MgO NPs were tested at varying concentrations (15.7–1000 µg/mL) alongside a standard ascorbic acid solution.

Test samples and reference standards were prepared at suitable doses covering a range from 1000 to 15.625 μg/mL in PBS at suitable doses. The enzyme solution (0.1 M PBS, 1 U/mL) and substrate solution (10 mM pNPG) were prepared separately. For the assay, 100 μL of the enzyme solution was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min in test tubes, followed by the addition of 10 μL of pNPG solution and further incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by adding 650 μL of 1 M sodium carbonate solution. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm, and the inhibition percentages were calculated based on the absorbance readings (Kim et al. 2004 Amylase inhibitory Evaluation of α-amylase inhibition was carried out using the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) (≥ 98% purity, Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) assay. MgO NPs and reference standards were diluted in PBS at suitable doses covering a range from 1000 to 15.625 μg/mL. The assay mixture consisted of 10 μL of α-amylase solution (2 U/mL) and 20 μL of each test sample, incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Then, 200 μL of a 1% potato starch solution in 100 mM PBS was introduced into each reaction tube, followed by an additional 30-min incubation at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μL of DNSA reagent, after which the samples were heated at 90 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, absorbance readings were taken at 540 nm, and the inhibition percentage of α-amylase activity was determined (Wickramaratne et al. 2016 Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 8; San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical comparisons between group means were performed using both one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Minitab® version 18 (2017) was used for optimization via RSM. All experimental results are presented as mean values ± SD. A value P with less than 0.05 was considered revealing of statistical significance. Results Phytochemical study Screening of phytochemicals revealed that the OPE contains alkaloids, carbohydrate, flavonoid, glycosides, saponin, and tannin (Table S1). Optimization study for MgO NPs biosynthesize Determination of significant factors The maximal productivity of MgO NPs varies depending on environmental conditions, such as a presence of precursors concentration. The incubation time between the OPE filtrate and the precursors, along with pH and temperature, were the variables considered. The UV–Vis spectra of the biosynthesized precursors were used to identify them. From all four factors only, one factor exhibited non-significant outcomes among the bio fabrication of MgO NPs illustrated in the time of incubation between the OPE filtrate and precursors of MgO NPs (Fig. S1). So RSM was applied to identify the optimal parameters for maximizing the final MgO NPs productivity. The most important factors (precursor concentration, pH and temperature) were conducted to obtain the optimum condition for bio fabrication process. RSM analysis To optimize the synthesis parameters for maximal yield and concentration of MgO NPs, RSM was utilized. The plot of normal probability MgO NPs show the true (real) effect of each term and whether chance (randomness) contributed to the outcomes. As illustrated in the normal probability plot (Fig. 1 1 1 D 2 B 2 Fig. 1 RSM analysis showing A B C D Fig. 2 RSM analysis showing A B C Characterization of MgO NPs using OPE at optimized conditions Usage of OPE for MgO NPs biosynthesis remains largely unexplored, underscoring the innovation of the current study. The biosynthesize of MgO NPs had appeared by the color change that at the optimum condition for high productivity at pH 6.8, 32.5 °C, and 5.1 mmol.

As illustrated in (Fig. 6 50 6 6 50 6 7 Fig. 6 Viability, toxicity and IC50 of Vero, PC3 and HeLa cell lines after treated by MgO NPs Fig. 7 The morphology of Vero, PC3 and HeLa cell lines control and treated by bioderived MgO NPs Antibacterial and antibiofilm efficacy The rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) microorganisms poses a significant threat to both the medical and agricultural sectors. These resistant strains have evolved sophisticated defense mechanisms that diminish the efficacy of conventional antibiotics, complicating treatment and management strategies. Consequently, researchers are intensively exploring innovative solutions, including the development of novel bioactive agents such as NPs. In this study, MgO NPs were biosynthesized using metabolites present in OPE which acted as both reducing and stabilizing agents to mediate the transformation of the metal precursor into MgO NPs. In this study, the antimicrobial efficacy of green-synthesized MgO NPs was evaluated against various pathogenic microorganisms, including K. pneumonia S. typhi B. subtilis S. aureus 8 B. subtilis S. aureus K. pneumonia S. typhi B. subtilis S. aureus S. typhi K. pneumoniae 8 K. pneumoniae S. typhi, S. aureus B. subtilis S. aureus E. coli 5 Fig. 8 The antibacterial potentials of bioderived MgO NPs. A: Agar well diffusion and MIC index. B: petri plate of the bacterial strains (A: MgONPs, B: negative control (DMSO) and C: positive control (Gentamicin)) Antioxidant activity As illustrated in (Fig. S2), MgO NPs demonstrated notable antioxidant activity, compared to that of ascorbic acid, which served as the reference standard. The radical scavenging capacity of MgO NPs showed a dose dependent increase across the tested concentrations. The IC 50 Antidiabetic activity The antidiabetic potential of MgO NPs is assessed by measuring their ability to inhibit α-amylase and α-glucosidase enzymes. Inhibiting α-amylase and α-glucosidase is a crucial therapeutic strategy in managing type 2 diabetes, as these enzymes significantly contribute to postprandial hyperglycemia. In this study, α-glucosidase inhibition was quantitatively assessed using a spectrophotometric assay involving yeast α-glucosidase and p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (pNPG) following treatment with varying concentrations of MgO NPs and the reference drug acarbose (Fig. S3). MgO NPs exhibited dose-dependent α-glucosidase enzyme inhibition, with an IC 50 50 50 Discussion The sustainable synthesis of biogenic MgO NPs using OPE represents a significant advancement in eco-friendly nanotechnology, as it merges green chemistry principles with biomedical innovation. Phytochemical analysis of the OPE revealed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, saponins, carbohydrates, and glycosides. The detected alkaloid content suggests that the extract possesses notable medicinal properties. Furthermore, our detection of phenolic compounds aligns with previous research by (Koolaji et al. 2020 2 2 2019 2021 −1 −1 2020 2021 2025 2020 In our study, we employed Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to design experiments and determine the optimal conditions for MgO NP production. This technique allowed us to systematically evaluate the most effective factors: pH, temperature, and precursor concentration. The RSM analysis yielded several key outcomes. For instance, a normal probability plot of residuals was used to detect significant deviations from normal distribution assumptions (Bagewadi et al. 2018 1998 2015 2022 2019 2 Under the optimized synthesis conditions, the bio fabricated MgONPs exhibited a characteristic ultraviolet–visible absorption peak at 281 nm. This finding is consistent with previous studies reporting surface plasmon resonance maxima for MgO NPs within the 260–280 nm range (Moorthy et al. 2015 2018 Tecoma stans 2021 2017 g 2018 −1 1 2019 −1 2020 −1 2016 −1 −1 2022 −1 −1 2023 −1 2015 −1 −1 2022 2017 2024 2020 Rosa floribunda 2021 2020 2020 2020 2022 Ajwain 2021 In this work, the average particle size of the biosynthesized MgO NPs was found to be 53.3 nm. Assessing the experimental cytotoxicity of biological materials against normal cell lines represents a fundamental initial step in evaluating their safety profile (Salem and Fouda 2021 50 2013 2019 50 2025 4 2020 2019 2013 2023 B. subtilis, S. aureus K. pneumonia S. typhi . 2021 B. subtilis S. aureus K. pneumonia S. typhi.

The multifunctional bioactivities of the biosynthesized MgO NPs, spanning anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antidiabetic effects, converge to address a constellation of health challenges that are notably prevalent within disability communities. The high efficacy against wound associated pathogens like S. aureus E. coli 2022 2015 2023 Limitations Problems with targeted delivery: It might be challenging to deliver medication precisely to certain tissues, which can result in systemic toxicity and adverse effects. Toxicity observed despite low-risk profile: while MgO NPs are often less harmful than other nanoparticles, certain research indicates that they can nevertheless be highly harmful both in vivo and in vitro. Unreliable synthesis approaches: poor batch-to-batch repeatability and inconsistent methodologies plague industrial-scale production. Problems with scalability and polydispersity: because nanoparticles frequently differ in size and shape, it might be difficult to produce them uniformly on a large scale. Limited stability in the long run data: little is known about the long-term safety, behavior and stability of MgO NPs in human body. Absence of validated in vivo models: the models that are now available are insufficient for assessing the effects of treatments and interactions of the immune system, particularly immunotoxicity. Underdeveloped industrial infrastructure: A lack of tools and quality control systems hinders the shift from laboratory-scale research to industrial output. Clinical translation challenges: There are still some unresolved scientific and regulatory obstacles that prevent promising lab results from being successfully translated into clinical settings. Futuristic studies Mechanistic studies: Examine the molecular mechanisms by which MgO NPs produce their antibacterial and therapeutic properties. In-vivo testing and biocompatibility: To assess the safety, adverse effects, and suitability of MgO NPs for biological systems, additional animal research is needed. Enhancing theranostics: Create theranostic systems based on MgO NPs for integrated diagnosis and treatment, an area that is still in its infancy. Potential for personalized medicine: Make use of MgO NPs to provide individualized care by utilizing their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant qualities to fit the needs of certain patient profiles. Integration of AI and Machine Learning: Use AI/ML to forecast optimal experimental conditions, optimize the synthesis of MgO NPs, and create nanoparticles with desired characteristics. Frameworks for regulations and standardization: To facilitate clinical translation, clearly define production, safety, and pharmacological profiling guidelines. Examine the possibilities for commercialization and patenting of MgO NPs in clinical, environmental, and industrial contexts. Conclusion Orange peel extract was successfully used to synthesis MgO NPs, providing a safe, economical, environmentally beneficial, and green method. Characterization through FTIR, UV–Vis, XRD, Zeta potential, TEM, SEM–EDX, and DLS confirmed that the nanoparticles were approximately 53.3 nm in size, exhibited a semispherical or quasi-spherical and well-organized morphology, and possessed a crystalline structure. Furthermore, the presence of various phytochemical components within the OPE was confirmed, which played a crucial role in the reduction and stabilization of the nanoparticles. Then, RSM was used to find the highest productive MgO NPs. These biosynthesized MgO NPs displayed potent anticancer activity against HeLa cervical cancerous cell line and prostate cancerous cell line (PC3), where the IC 50 S. aureus E. coli Supplementary Information  Additional file1 (DOCX 160 kb) Publisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
