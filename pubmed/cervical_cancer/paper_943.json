Introduction The second generation of Antibody-based Immunotherapy includes monoclonal antibodies against Immune Checkpoints (ICs), to modulate specific T cell responses against cancer or viruses. We recently generated a large repertoire of fully human antibodies targeting ten different ICs through a novel selection strategy based on the combination of phage libraries on human lymphocytes and next generation sequencing (NGS). Here we generated and tested four novel fully human IgG1 mAbs specific for OX-40, an immunostimulatory receptor expressed on immune cells, which has been shown to be a promising target for immune-based therapeutic strategies. Methods and results By ELISA and Biolayer Interferometry we demonstrated that they all specifically bind with high affinity to OX-40 and they recognize distinct epitopes. Three of them interfere with the binding of OX-40 and its ligand, thus suggesting that they compete with it for the receptor binding. T cell activation assays confirmed the agonistic properties of these 3 antibodies which are able to mimic the ligand by activating the pathway downstream the receptor. This activation results into an effective proliferation of hPBMCs and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Co-culture assays of hPBMCs with tumor cells confirm their ability to induce the activation of immune cells against cancer cells. The fourth antibody, even though non-agonistic, was able to induce the activation of lymphocytes by a different mechanism of action, based on NK-mediated Treg killing in co-culture assays. Discussion and conclusions Combinations of these anti-OX40 mAbs targeting different epitopes lead to stronger activation of immune cells. Moreover, epitope binning analyses show that they recognize distinct epitopes not overlapping with that of the clinically validated Rocatinlimab, thus they could become potential new therapeutic tools. Taking advantage of the different behaviour of the novel mAbs, we also exploited them to clarify the unclear role of OX-40 on NK cells. We show here for the first time that NK cells express higher levels of a medium glycosylated OX-40 form than T cells, which is preferentially recognized by the novel mAbs but not by OX-40L, which instead binds to a highly glycosylated OX-40 variant absent on non-immune cells. Thus, glycosylation pattern could affect the recognition and biological effects of OX-40 binders and should be considered for the design of novel drugs. antibodies immunotherapy immune checkpoints OX-40 NK cells The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The treatment with OX-40 agonists promotes T cell activation and infiltration into tumors and it also prevents primary or acquired resistance to drugs targeting inhibitory checkpoints (e.g., PD-1, CTLA-4) as depicted in different preclinical cancer models (B16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma, colon cancer and 4T-1 breast cancer). Beyond functional invalidation of Treg cells, if of appropriate isotype, anti-OX-40 mAbs can further eliminate infiltrating Treg by Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC), as reported for several malignancies such as MCA303 sarcoma, CT26 colon carcinoma and SM1 breast cancer ( 14 15 Several anti-OX-40 agonistic antibodies are currently being tested in clinical trials, both in monotherapy and in combination with other drugs ( 16 NCT01644968 17 18 NCT02318394 19 20 21 22 NCT02528357 NCT04198766 23 24 26 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Antibodies and human recombinant proteins The following human recombinant (hr) proteins were used: OX40/TNFRSF4 Fc Chimeric Protein, CF (3388-OX), human OX40 Ligand/TNFSF4 Protein, Fc Tag (OXL-H5266) from Acro biosystems (Newark, DE 19711, USA), Recombinant Human IgG1 Fc Protein, CF (110-HG), Recombinant Human OX40/TNFRSF4 His-tagged Protein (9969-OX), CF, all from R&D SYSTEMS Inc.

The human commercial or clinically validated antibodies used are reported as follows: CD134/OX40 Polyclonal antibody (20006-1-AP) from Proteintech; Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Secondary Antibody, HRP (31460, Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific); anti-human IgG (Fab’)2 HRP-conjugated goat monoclonal antibody (ab87422, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); anti-alpha Tubulin antibody (ab4074, Abcam); anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody (sc-25336, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Dallas, TX, USA) HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The clinically validated anti-PD-L1 Atezolizumab mAb (N298A, InvivoGen) and anti-OX-40 Rocatinlimab (HY-P99955, MedChemExpress) were also used. 2.2 Cell cultures The human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Gibco, Life Technologies). The medium was supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (30-2025, ATCC), 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 µg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine (all from Gibco Life Technologies) and cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 2.3 Production and Purification of the novel antibodies Plasmid vectors encoding each of the 5 novel anti-OX-40 mAbs were transfected into HEK293-EBNA SINEUP cells ( 25 ® ® 24 2.4 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays 2.4.1 ELISA on purified protein In order to evaluate the binding affinity of the novel OX-40 mAbs, parallel ELISA assays were performed on human OX-40/Fc recombinant protein and, as a negative control, on recombinant human IgG1 Fc protein. The proteins were coated at a concentration of 5 µg/ml. The anti-OX-40 mAbs were incubated at Room Temperature (RT) for 1 h 30 min at increasing concentrations (0.3–200 nM) with gentle shaking. After three extensive washes with PBS 1X, the secondary anti-human HRP-conjugated IgG (Fab’)2, was added for 1 h at RT. The plate was washed three times with PBS 1X and the signal was detected by incubating with 3,3’,5,5’-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Sigma-Aldrich) reagent before quenching with an equal volume of 1 N HCl. Finally, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured by Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer, 2102). The binding values were reported in GraphPad Prism 10 tool system for the binding curve analyses and the K D 2.4.2 Cell ELISA on human PBMCs The binding of the purified anti-OX-40 mAbs to the target, expressed in its native conformation, was tested on human lymphocytes. First, the expression levels of OX-40 on hPBMCs, either untreated or activated with SEB (50 ng/ml), was checked by plating 2.10 5 The binding curves of the novel anti-OX-40 mAbs were obtained by incubating them at increasing concentrations (ranging from 0.3 to 200 nM) for 1 h and 30 min at RT, on both untreated and activated lymphocytes, plated as mentioned above. After three washes, the secondary anti-human HRP-conjugated IgG (Fab’)2 was incubated for 1h at RT and the signal was measured as previously mentioned. The binding of OX-40_5 mAb was also tested on CD4 + - 5 2.4.3 Competitive ELISA assays Competitive parallel ELISA assays were carried out in order to determine whether the novel mAbs recognize different epitopes. To this aim, OX-40_2 and OX-40_1 were immobilized on 96-well plate (5 µg/mL in a buffer of NaHCO 3 2.5 Biolayer interferometry analyses 2.5.1 Binding kinetics via BLI analyses In order to analyze the kinetics of the four purified anti-OX-40 mAbs, BLI analyses were performed by using the Octet R4 Protein Analysis System (Sartorius, Fremont, CA, USA) by following the manufacturer’s recommendation, as previously reported ( 27 28 2.5.2 Epitope binning via BLI in tandem assay For epitope binning analyses, the loading step was carried out as described above. After washing step, OX-40-Fc, used as ligand, was saturated with the first mAb (OX-40_2 or OX-40_5) at concentration of 200 nM for 600 s; then, the second mAb (OX-40_3 or OX-40_1) was added at increasing concentrations (50 nM, 100 nM, and 200 nM) for 600 s. Alternatively, in additional analyses, Rocatinlimab was used as first Ab for saturation, and each of the novel mAbs was added at a concentration of 200 nM. The biosensors were regenerated and the data acquired and processed as mentioned above. 2.5.3 Competitive BLI assays In order to evaluate the interference of the novel isolated mAbs in the binding between the OX-40 Ligand and OX-40 Receptor, we performed competitive BLI assays. OX-40L/His ligand was immobilized on HIS1K biosensors at a concentration of 5 μg/mL; after washes, OX-40/Fc receptor was added for 500 s at a concentration of 10 nM alone or previously incubated with one of each anti-OX-40 mAb (10-fold molar excess) for 1 h 30 min at RT. A parallel pre-incubation with an unrelated IgG1 mAb was carried out as a negative control. The data were obtained and processed by the Octet Analysis Studio Software 13.0{it}. 2.6 Bioluminescent cell-based assays In order to test whether the antibodies can activate OX40 downstream pathway, the bioluminescent OX40 Bioassay (JA2191, Promega) was used. Briefly, the day before the assay, the Jurkat T cells expressing OX40 were thawed in RPMI with 5% FBS and plated in white, flat-bottom plate by following the manufacturer’s recommendations. After 24 h, the five novel anti-OX-40 mAbs or the ligand, used as a positive control, were added at increasing concentrations (1.5–200 nM) and incubated for 5 h in 5% CO 2 2.7 Isolation of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (hPBMCs) Human PBMCs were purchased from ATCC (PCS-800-011). All tissues used for isolation by ATCC are obtained under informed consent and conform to HIPAA regulations to protect the privacy of the donor’s Personally Identifiable Information. The vials containing the PBMCs were gently thawed out by using a medium composed by RPMI 1640 with 1% L-glutamine, 1% CTLWash™ (Immunospot by Cellular Technology Limited) and 100 U/mL Benzonase (Merck Millipore) and used after resting overnight at 37°C in R10 medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% inactivated FBS, 1% L-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, 50 µg/mL streptomycin and 1% HEPES all from (Gibco, Life Technologies). 2.8 Isolation of NK and CD8 + Human NK and CD8 + + 29 30 + + + 2.9 Isolation of CD4 + + + CD4 + + + + + + + + +  - + + g 2.10 ADCC assays and determination of cell lysis To clarify whether the novel anti-OX-40 mAbs could induce Treg and tumor cells killing through ADCC mediated by NK cells, the latter isolated cells (6 × 10 4 + + + - 29 2.11 Cytokine secretion assays The supernatants were analyzed by performing ELISA assays in order to evaluate the levels of IL-2 and IFNγ secretion. The IL-2 (DY202) and IFNγ (DY285B) DuoSet ELISA kits by R&D Systems were used to measure the release of cytokines from cell culture supernatants. The assays were performed as described ( 30 31 2.12 Cytotoxicity assays The cytotoxic effects of the novel anti-OX-40 mAbs were tested in co-cultures of hPBMCs and MDA-MB-231, either used as single agents or in combination with the clinically validated Atezolizumab. To this aim, MDA-MB-231 were plated at a density of 1 × 10 4 2.13 Western blotting analyses In order to evaluate the OX-40 expression in different lymphocytes subpopulations or other non-immune cells, Western Blotting analyses were carried out. Untreated lymphocytes or activated total hPBMCs, NK, CD8 + + 6 2.14 Data analysis and statistics Error bars were calculated on the basis of the results obtained by at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were assessed by Student’s t-test (two variables) or by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test performed after Two-way ANOVA analysis. Statistical significance was established as *** p ≤ 0.001; ** p < 0.01; * p < 0.05. 3 Results 3.1 Phage display selection of human scFvs specific for OX-40 and screening by NGS In our laboratory a human antibody repertoire against several immune checkpoints was previously generated ( 24 26 As resting lymphocytes do not express OX-40, the first step of selection included a negative panning on non-activated (resting) human lymphocytes to subtract from the phage pool those recognizing common antigens on cell surface, followed by a positive selection on activated lymphocytes expressing high levels of OX-40 ( 24 E. coli  Supplementary Figure S1  Table 1 24 26 26  Table 1 24 Table 1 Enrichment of the scFv sequences over the 3 phage display selection cycles.

The secreted mAbs were purified from conditioned medium by protein A affinity chromatography as described in Methods. The purified antibodies were tested for their purity and stability by SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting and ELISA assays. As shown in  Supplementary Figure S2  Supplementary Figures S3A, B  Supplementary Figure S3C 3.3 Characterization of binding ability of the novel converted anti−OX-40 mAbs by ELISA and Biolayer Interferometry The newly-generated anti-OX-40 mAbs were further tested for their binding to the targets, by performing a dose-response binding curve by ELISA assays (0.3–200 nM) on human OX-40 expressed either as recombinant protein or in its native conformation on activated lymphocytes. The binding curves, shown in  Figure 1A Figure 1 Binding of the novel anti-OX-40 mAbs on OX-40 recombinant protein and human lymphocytes.

Section A displays binding curves on human recombinant protein with four graphs, showing absorbance versus concentration for OX-40_1, OX-40_2, OX-40_3, OX-40_5, and no binding for OX-40_8. Section B is a bar graph depicting OX-40 expression levels in untreated versus activated hPBMCs, indicating higher absorbance for activated cells. Section C presents binding curves on human lymphocytes in four graphs, indicating higher absorbance for activated hPBMCs across OX-40_1, OX-40_2, OX-40_3, and OX-40_5. In order to evaluate the binding of OX-40_1, 2, 3 and 5 mAbs to the target also when expressed on human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hPBMCs), we first checked the expression levels of OX-40 on hPBMCs, either untreated or stimulated with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), by using a commercial anti-OX-40 Ab for detection. As reported in  Figure 1B 7  Figure 1C We further analysed the binding kinetics (association and dissociation rates not detectable by ELISA) of the four functional anti-OX-40 mAbs by carrying out real time binding analyses by Biolayer Interferometry (BLI). In these assays, we immobilized by protein A the human recombinant OX-40/Fc on the surface of the biosensors. Before adding the analytes, we further saturated the biosensors by using the recombinant human Fc to avoid non-specific interactions of the antibodies with the proA biosensor through their Fc fragment. Then, we added each of the four anti-OX-40 antibodies, used as analytes at increasing concentrations (10, 50 and 100 nM). These experimental conditions, in which the target protein was immobilized on the biosensor, were chosen to mimic the in vivo  Figure 2 D D  Table 2 D  Table 3 D D Figure 2 Binding kinetics of the novel anti-OX-40 mAbs on immobilized OX-40 protein via BLI analyses.

To this aim, each of the novel binders was tested in competitive assays by measuring the binding of biotinylated OX-40 receptor to the immobilized mAb after an incubation of 1 h at RT in the absence or presence of saturating concentration (250 nM) of the other mAb. The signal was detected by using HRP conjugated Streptavidin. As a negative control, the binding was also evaluated when the receptor was pre-incubated with saturating concentrations of the same mAb used for the coating. As shown in  Figure 3A Figure 3 Epitope binning of the novel mAbs on OX-40 receptor. (A) (B) Two graphs. Panel A shows bar graphs of absorbance at 450 nm for coated OX-40_2 mAb and OX-40_1 mAb, comparing OX-40_Biot, OX-40_1, OX-40_2, OX-40_3, and OX-40_5 mAb, with varying absorbance levels. Panel B presents two line graphs for OX-40_2 and OX-40_5 at 200 nM saturating concentration, with time in seconds on the x-axis and response in nanometers on the y-axis, displaying curves for different concentrations. To further confirm these findings, additional epitope binning analyses were carried out via BLI by using a different in-tandem approach, with respect to the previous premix assays. Briefly, recombinant OX-40/Fc receptor was immobilized on ProA biosensors, then a first antibody (either OX-40_5 or OX-40_2) was added at saturating concentrations of 200 nM, and the second antibody (OX-40_1 or OX-40_3, respectively) was added at increasing concentrations (50–200 nM). The results, reported by the sensorgrams in  Figure 3B We also decided to investigate whether the epitopes recognized by these new immunoagents overlap or not with that recognized by the ligand OX-40L. To this aim, we performed BLI assays to measure the interference of the new mAbs in the binding between the ligand and the receptor. First, we measured the binding of OX-40 Ligand to its receptor. Briefly, OX40/Fc receptor was immobilized on ProA biosensor at the concentration of 3 µg/mL and OX-40L/His ligand was tested as analyte at increasing concentrations (5–30 nM), the results confirmed its binding affinity for the receptor in the nanomolar range (  Supplementary Figure S4  Figure 4A  Figure 4B Figure 4 Assessment of competitive binding and interference of novel anti-OX-40 mAbs and OX-40-L.

Curves indicate different reduction of binding in the presence of mAbs. 3.5 Bioluminescent cell-based assay to analyze the biological properties of the novel anti-OX-40 mAbs To clarify the different intracellular downstream effects of each mAb, we subjected them to OX-40 reporter cells assay. The assay consists in the stimulation of engineered Jurkat T cells expressing OX-40 receptor associated with a luciferase reporter that generates a bioluminescent signal when stimulated by agonistic molecules. The OX-40 expressing Jurkat T cells were seeded in white 96 well plate, and the following day, were incubated with each of the four antibodies (OX-40_1, 2,_3, 5) at 37 °C at increasing concentrations (1.5–200 nM) for 5 h. The resulting data, represented in  Figure 5  Figure 4 Figure 5 Assessment of the effects of novel anti-OX-40 mAbs on OX-40 intracellular signalling. The ability of the indicated antibodies to activate OX-40 receptor was tested by using OX-40 Bioassay. Genetically engineered Jurkat T cells expressing luciferase reporter gene under the control of OX-40 signalling were used. The cells were treated with the indicated antibodies in a dose escalation range (1.5–200 nM). After treatment, the bioluminescent signal was quantified. OX-40_8 mAb was used as a negative control. Error bars depicted means ± SD and the P values reported is: ***P < 0.001, calculated by Sidak’s multiple comparisons test performed by 2way ANOVA analysis. RLU values at all the doses of the antibody OX-40_1, OX-40_2, and OX-40_3 were compared to those of OX-40_5. Bar graph depicting luminescence (RLU) at various nM concentrations for OX-40_1 to OX-40_8. Bars show an increase in luminescence for OX-40_1, OX-40_2, and OX-40_3, with significance indicated by asterisks. OX-40_5 and OX-40_8 show minimal luminescence. Given the stronger agonistic activity shown by OX-40_3 compared with the other antibodies, we decided to compare its effects to the agonistic effect of OX-40 ligand on hPBMCs activation. To this aim, hPBMCs were stimulated with SEB and then treated with either OX-40L or OX-40_3 mAb at increasing concentrations for 96 h. IL-2 and IFNγ cytokines secretion levels were measured in supernatant by ELISA assays. An unrelated IgG1 was used as a negative control. The results, reported in  Figure 6A Figure 6 Effects of the novel mAbs on cytokines secretion by hPBMCs. (A) (B) (C) (D) A set of graphs and bar charts display the effects of different treatments on hPBMCs stimulated with SEB. A) Two line graphs show IFNγ and IL-2 concentrations against various OX-40 treatments over 96 hours, highlighting statistically significant differences (*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001). B) Similar line graphs compare additional OX-40 treatments under the same conditions, emphasizing significant differences. C) Two bar charts illustrate IFNγ and IL-2 levels for various treatments, with statistical significance indicated. D) A bar chart presents IFNγ levels after 48-hour stimulation and treatment, demonstrating significant differences between groups. 3.6 Effects of the novel mAbs on the activation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes Based on these results, we further extended cytokine secretion profile of all the novel anti OX-40 mAbs in a dose escalation experiment (0.2–10 nM) by using immune cells, as this system mimics the natural environment of human body better than the previous bioluminescence assay. We stimulated hPBMCs with SEB at 50 ng/ml and then treated with each of the anti-OX-40 mAbs. An unrelated IgG1 was used in parallel assays as a negative control. After 96 h, the supernatants were collected and the levels of IFNγ and IL-2 secreted were evaluated by ELISA assays. As shown in  Figure 6B 50  Table 4 Table 4 EC 50 Mab EC 50 IFNγ IL-2 OX-40_1 1.18 nM 0.8 nM OX-40_2 1.25 nM 1 nM OX-40_3 1.5 nM 1.1 nM OX-40_5 1.2 nM 1.1 nM EC 50 50 To further investigate on the different mechanisms exploited by the four novel anti-OX-40 mAbs, we decided to compare cytokine secretion profile induced by all the novel mAbs with the one elicited by natural ligand of OX-40 (OX-40-L). Thus hPBMCs, previously stimulated with SEB, were treated with the novel mAbs or with OX-40-L, for 96 h at two different concentrations (2 and 10 nM). As indicated in  Figure 6C  Figure 6D 3.7 Effects of anti-OX-40 mAbs on Treg and tumor-cell killing On the basis of previous observations, we decided to further investigate on the ability of the novel mAbs to induce ADCC, by recruiting the NK cells through the interaction of Fc and CD16 receptor ( 32 33 + - Interestingly, we observed a differential behaviour between agonistic and non-agonistic mAbs: OX-40_5, the non-agonistic mAb, induced a stronger Treg cell lysis, leading to highest levels of LDH released, mediated by NK cells when compared to the agonistic mAbs (  Figure 7A + -  Figure 7B + -  Figure 7C Figure 7 Effects of anti-OX-40 mAbs on co-cultures of NK with Treg, CD4 + - (A) + - (B) (C) + - (D) (E) (A, B) (E) Bar graphs comparing NK cell interactions with Treg or CD4+/CD25- cells, and MDA-MB-231 tumor cells.

Error bars represent standard deviation, and significance is marked by asterisks. To test whether the novel anti-OX-40 mAbs induce ADCC mediated by NK cells also on tumor cells, we exploited a co-culture of NK cells with MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. The tumour cell lysis was measured as LDH release in the presence of the OX-40_3 and OX-40_5 (100nM for 72h) or in the presence of unrelated IgG1. Also, combination of the two mAbs was tested. As shown in  Figure 7D  Figure 7E 3.8 Binding and Effects of novel anti-OX-40 mAbs on isolated NK and CD8 + To further investigate on the different biological behaviour of agonistic and non-agonistic antibodies, we decided to test the novel OX-40 _3 and _5 mAbs on different lymphocytes subpopulations isolated or in co-cultures. To this aim NK, CD8 + + It has been reported in literature that OX-40 is expressed at higher levels on CD4 + 34 + +  Figure 8A + Figure 8 Expression of OX-40 on hPBMCs, NK, CD8 + + (A) + (B) + (D) C E Panel A displays a Western blot and bar graph showing OX-40 expression levels in various cell conditions, with glycosylated forms at 35, 40, and 45 kDa.

Each panel represents different cell types, including NK cells, NK plus monocytes cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD8+ plus CD4+ T cells plus monocytes, treated with various concentrations of OX-40. Once confirmed the expression of OX-40 on all the subpopulations, we tested the effects of mAbs on isolated NK and CD8 + + +  Figures 8B-E + A cell ELISA with OX-40_3 and OX-40_5 was conducted on unfractionated pre-activated hPBMCs and on isolated subpopulations (CD8 + +  Supplementary Figure S5 To further investigate on the ability of the novel mAbs to recognize the differential glycosylated forms of the native receptor, we analyzed cell extracts of stimulated hPBMCs and NK cells by WB by incubating the membranes with each mAb, OX-40_3, OX-40_5, commercial anti-OX-40 Ab or its natural trimeric ligand fused to Fc, used in parallel for comparison. After detection of the signals, each form was quantified and normalized with α-tubulin. The commercial Ab was used to determine the total expression of OX-40 in hPBMCs and NK cells, (  Supplementary Figures S6A, B These results suggest that the ligand cannot bind to OX-40 on NK cells and seems to recognize the receptor through a sugar epitope present on highly glycosylated form, preferentially expressed by T cells, thus suggesting an important role of glycosylation for OX-40. To confirm this hypothesis we tested the binding of OX-40 ligand in comparison with that of the novel antibodies on NK cells also by cell ELISA by using the commercial anti-OX-40 Ab to check OX-40 expression level. As shown in  Supplementary Figure S6C To further investigate on the role of the highly glycosylated form and its specific recognition by the ligand we analyzed its expression on other non-immune cells, such as normal-like or tumor cells (MDA-MB-231). To this aim, these cells were lysed in parallel with hPBMCs and analyzed by WB with the commercial anti-OX-40 Ab. As shown in  Supplementary Figure S6D  Supplementary Figure S6 3.9 Comparative analysis of the novel human mAbs and clinically validated Rocatinlimab Finally, the effects of the novel human anti-OX-40 mAbs were compared with the FDA-approved anti-OX-40 mAb Rocatinlimab. First, we performed epitope binning analyses carried out via BLI. Briefly, recombinant OX-40/Fc receptor was immobilized on a ProA biosensor, then Rocatinlimab was added at a saturating concentration of 200 nM, and each of the novel antibody was added at the same concentration. Rocatinlimab itself was used as a control. The results, reported by the sensorgrams in  Supplementary Figure S7A We then tested the effects of Rocatinlimab on activation of hPBMCs in comparison with those exerted by OX-40_3 and _5. We stimulated hPBMCs with SEB at 50 ng/ml in the absence or presence of each anti-OX-40 mAb at a concentration of 5 μg/mL. An unrelated IgG1 was used in parallel assays as a negative control. After 48 h, the supernatants were collected and the levels of IFNγ and IL-2 secreted were evaluated by ELISA assays. As shown in  Supplementary Figures S7B, C 3.10 Effects of the novel anti−OX-40 mAbs used alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1 mAbs on co-cultures of hPBMCs and tumor cells In order to evaluate potential synergistic effects with antibodies targeting other inhibitory ICs we investigated the biological effects of the novel anti-OX40 mAbs in combination with the clinically validated anti-PD-L1 mAb, Atezolizumab, in co-cultures of hPBMCs and tumor cells. First, we compared the effects of the novel anti-OX-40 mAbs when used alone or in combination with Atezolizumab on the proliferation of human lymphocytes. To this aim, hPBMCs were stimulated with SEB (50 ng/mL) and treated with anti-OX-40 mAbs alone or in combination with Atezolizumab for 96 h at the concentration of 5 μg/mL. As shown in  Figure 9A Figure 9 Effects of anti-OX-40 mAbs on co-cultures of lymphocytes and tumor cells used alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1 mAbs. (A) (B) (C) Three charts depict experiments with hPBMCs, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, and NK cells. Chart A shows IL-2 levels for hPBMCs with various treatments, highlighting significant differences. Chart B presents absorbance of PD-L1 and OX-40 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Chart C illustrates LDH release from co-cultured cells with hPBMCs and NK cells, comparing different treatments and controls. Statistical significance is marked by asterisks. On the basis of these results, we decided to further study the effects of these combinations on co-cultures of tumor cells and hPBMCs or NK cells, in order to evaluate their anti-tumor effects. Once checked the expression levels of OX-40 and PD-L1 on MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cell line by cell ELISA assays, by using a commercial anti-OX-40 Ab (  Figure 9B  Figure 9C 4 Discussion Immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis and CTLA-4, have significantly improved the efficacy of cancer therapy, and the development of this type of tools has emerged as one of most active field of research ( 1 3 2 4 5 8 35 36 36 37 37 We previously adopted a phage display selection approach on both OX-40-expressing cells in its native conformation and recombinant protein to isolate novel antibody fragments targeting OX-40 ( 24 26 In this study, we fully characterized these four antibodies, named OX-40_1, OX-40_2, OX-40_3, and OX-40_5, by evaluating their binding to OX-40, by using both ELISA and BLI, and testing their ability to interfere in the interaction between the OX-40 receptor and its ligand. Among them, OX-40_1 and OX-40_3 behaved as full agonists, effectively competing with the natural ligand for OX-40 binding. In contrast, OX-40_2 and OX-40_5 exhibited only partial competition, reflecting differences in epitope recognition. It is particularly interesting to note that assays analyzing various aspects of OX-40 pathway activation provide the opportunity to diversify the impact of different antibodies. Indeed, despite all identified antibodies binding at sub-nanomolar concentrations, their biological effects are highly diverse. This is especially evident when comparing the effects of antibodies with the natural ligand in their ability to induce IL-2 and IFNγ secretion. Specifically, regarding IL-2 secretion, the ligand exhibits a stronger effect than the novel mAbs whereas it shows an opposite effect for IFNγ secretion, as the treatment with the novel antibodies, especially OX-40_5, leads to the strongest secretion. Furthermore, competition with the natural ligand, and consequent agonistic behaviour of the antibodies, was not found to be a discriminating factor in hPBMC activation. As previously mentioned, OX-40_5, differently from the other antibodies, did not behave as an OX-40 agonist, and appeared nearly inert in the functional bioluminescence assay, which is based on OX-40 specific downstream signalling. On the other side, it was the most potent in inducing IFNγ release following the stimulation of NK cells in cytotoxic activity against Treg cells or TNBC cells in ADCC assays. Therefore, its anti-tumor potential might derive from its ability to trigger an efficient Treg cells depletion thanks to the high levels of OX-40 on Treg cells ( 33 38 39 32 40  Supplementary Figure S8 41 42 Furthermore, considering the different mechanisms of action of OX-40–3 and OX-40_5, the combination of agonistic and non-agonistic mAbs resulted in a more potent activation of hPBMCs, especially when NK cells were co-cultured with TNBC cells. This combination could also promote the generation of memory T cells due to the effect of agonistic anti-OX-40 mAb ( 15 43 11 Finally, combining these antibodies with a clinical inhibitor of the PD-1/PD-L1 immune axis, Atezolizumab, resulted in an additive capacity to induce inflammatory cytokine secretion and tumor cell killing in co-culture assays. These findings provide valuable insights into the therapeutic potential of anti-OX-40 mAbs in modulating immune responses against tumors. By targeting OX-40 with agonistic antibodies, this study demonstrates the ability to potentiate anti-tumor immunity while reducing the suppressive function of Tregs, thus shifting the immune landscape toward a more pro-inflammatory and tumor-eliminating state. In summary, this study extends beyond the description of novel monoclonal antibodies. First, it demonstrates the applicability of an NGS-based screening method that leverages activated human cells and recombinant protein bait to isolate and enrich antibody species recognizing the antigen in its native form. Additionally, it highlights the complexity of the OX-40 pathway, where competition with the natural ligand and the ability to induce ADCC are key factors to be considered in future studies. Furthermore, it confirms that the combinations of antibodies recognizing different epitopes of OX-40 or targeting OX-40 and PD-L1 lead to stronger anti-tumor effects. Finally, it suggests for the first time a critical role of extensive glycosylation of OX-40 in T cells, not observed in NK or other non-immune cells, for the specific recognition by the ligand.
