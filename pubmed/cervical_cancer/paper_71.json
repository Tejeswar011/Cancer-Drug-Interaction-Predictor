Immunotherapy has become a pivotal modality in clinical cancer treatment. However, its effectiveness is limited to a small subset of patients due to the low antigenicity, impaired innate response, and various adaptive immune resistance mechanisms of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Accumulating evidence reveals the critical roles of metal elements in shaping immunity against tumor progression and metastasis. The marriage of metalloimmunotherapy and nanotechnology further presents new opportunities to optimize the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of metal ions in a precise spatiotemporal control manner. Several metallodrugs have demonstrated encouraging immunotherapeutic potential in preliminary studies and are currently undergoing clinical trials at different stages, yet challenges persist in scaling up production and addressing long-term biosafety concerns. This review delineates how metal materials modulate biological activities across diverse cell types to orchestrate antitumor immunity. Moreover, it summarizes recent progress in smart drug delivery-release systems integrating metal elements, either as cargo or vehicles, to enhance antitumor immune responses. Finally, the review introduces current clinical applications of nanomedicines in metalloimmunotherapy and discusses potential challenges that impede its widespread translation into clinical practice. Graphical abstract This review delineates how metal elements modulate biological activities across diverse cell types to orchestrate onco-immunity, and highlights the integration of metalloimmunology and nanotechnology in advancing antitumor therapy.

The medicinal properties of metal substances have been recognized since ancient times. For example, ancient Greeks utilized iron-rich rust to treat ailments, while cinnabar containing mercury (Hg) was used in ancient China to soothe nerves. In modern medicine, the discovery of platinum (Pt) as an antibacterial agent by Rosenberg and his colleagues in 1965 propelled the field of metallotherapeutics 1 , 2 3 Immunotherapy has marked a significant leap forward in cancer treatment over the past decade 4 5 , 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Metallic elements are endogenous elements in the human body and have demonstrated their essential roles in shaping the immune system 16 + 2+ 2+ 17 18 19 + 2+ 2+ κ 20 21 22 23 2+/3+ 2+ 24 25 26 27 2+ 2+ 28 + + 29 30 31 2+ 2+ 2+ 32 in vivo 33 Beyond direct immunomodulatory actions, metal substances often exhibit substantial surface area and abundant functional groups (or vacant electron orbitals) and can be further tailored to exhibit specific structural or functional features, such as nano-size or photo/thermal/magnetic responsiveness 34 , 35 This review highlights the immunological significance of metallic nanomedicines across diverse cell types within the TME, including their direct effects on immune cells, their role in modulating the extracellular matrix or alleviating immunosuppressive features within tumor tissues, and their indirect effects in inducing immunological tumor cell death. It also introduces recent laboratory and preclinical studies on the utilization of metal-based nanoparticles in cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, it summarizes metallic nanomedicines currently under different stages of clinical trials and discusses translational hurdles, aiming to guide the future development of metalloimmunotherapy strategies. 2 Metallic nanomedicines induce tumor cell death Metal ions play critical roles in various fundamental biological processes including membrane excitability, metabolic regulation, enzymatic catalysis, signal transduction, redox balance, and energy supply 36 37 , 38 39 40 41 , 42 43 , 44 Fig. 1 Table 1 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 Figure 1 Metallic nanomedicines induce various modes of immunogenic tumor death.

Among metallodrugs, platinum-based therapies have stood out in clinical oncology, retaining their efficacy as first-line treatments despite challenges such as drug resistance and side effects.

When combined with αPD-1 antibodies, RiMO-301 achieved an objective response rate of 66.7% (4 out of 6 patients), with the remaining 2 patients showing a 15%–20% reduction in tumor size. Observed treatment-related adverse events included mild radiation dermatitis, dysgeusia, hypotension, dizziness, and elevated aminotransferase levels 310 Another metallic nanoparticle under clinical development is NBTXR3, designed as a radiation enhancer comprising negatively charged phosphate-coated crystalline hafnium oxide nanoparticles 311 in vivo vs. 312 313 Taken together, metallic nanomedicines hold significant promise in enhancing antitumor immune responses, either by directly activating innate immune pathways such as cGAS–STING or by potentiating PTT or RT-induced tumor ablation and subsequent ICD effects. These approaches offer advantages in inducing the abscopal effect and promoting immune memory. However, most metallic nanomedicines remain in preclinical or early-stage trials. A deeper understanding of immune network interactions and comprehensive investigations into the short-term and long-term toxicity of metal-based materials are crucial prerequisites for advancing clinical translation. 6 Conclusions and future prospects Immunotherapy leverages the host's immune system to attack tumor cells, representing a significant advancement in cancer treatment over the past decade 12 κ + While direct effects on immune cells are rapid and specific, indirect effects on tumor cells and the TME tend to be more gradual and may vary across individuals or even different stages of tumor progression within the same individual. This underscores the importance of personalized assessment and tailored therapy. Nonetheless, these indirect actions often contribute to a more favorable environment for immune training, systemic immune protection, and the establishment of immune memory. Combining both direct and indirect mechanisms may overcome potential negative feedback loops that contribute to tumor resistance, generating both rapid and sustained antitumor effects, ultimately improving response rates and providing survival benefits. However, the presence of multiple cell types within tumor tissues and the shared immune signaling pathways across these cells pose challenges in isolating these effects. For example, toxic ions used to initiate RCD in tumor cells may inadvertently damage healthy endothelial and immune cells. Additionally, cGAS–STING activation in T cells is often associated with unwanted apoptosis, which could suppress antitumor immunity 314 Exposure to high levels of metal ions poses severe biosafety concerns such as hematologic toxicity and organ failure 315 β 316 , 317 2+ 318 , 319 via 320 , 321 322 227 , 323 Despite promising, only a limited number of metallic nanomedicines have entered clinical evaluation. Several challenges need to be addressed to facilitate their translation. First, the pharmacokinetics and biocompatibility of metallic nanomedicines remain inadequately studied. Growing evidence suggests that metallic nanoparticles entering the body are prone to deposit in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, potentially inducing oxidative stress and increasing inflammation 324 , 325 326 2 327 , 328 329 330 293 in vivo 331 Second, comprehensive mechanistic investigations into the interactions between metal substances and immune networks, along with strategies for precise control over delivery and release, are essential. Certain metal ions may exhibit multifaced bioactivities 332 2+ 333 2+ 334 , 335 314 336 Third, compared to small-molecule drugs, metallic nanomedicines introduce structural complexity, adding costs and steps in chemistry, manufacturing, and controls 337 Author contributions Shixuan Li and Xiaohu Wang collected the related papers, drafted the original manuscript.
