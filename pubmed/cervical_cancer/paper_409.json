To date, none of the proposed strategies for predicting outcomes in this disease have proven fully effective, and a comprehensive physical examination remains the primary method for early detection and monitoring of HNSCC. Therefore, identifying new molecular markers for HNSCC prognosis would be highly beneficial. Candidate biomarkers of HNSCC progression include various signaling proteins and actin-binding proteins (ABPs) [ 1 [ 2 3 [ 4 [ 3 [ 1 [ 5 The current study included 29 Caucasian patients with T1–4N0–1M0 HNSCC, of whom five were female. The median age of the patients was 56 years (range, 43–67). Among these patients, 37.9% ( n The serum level of FSCN1 was measured using an ELISA Kit for FSCN1 (Cloud-Clone Corp., Wuhan, China) and a Multiskan FC enzyme immunoassay analyzer (Thermo Scientific, Shanghai, China). The number of leukocytes and CTCs in whole blood samples was assessed by flow cytometry using a BD FACSCanto Ⅱ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Membrane markers CD45 and CD326 (also known as EpCAM) were stained using Alexa Fluor® 700 mouse anti-human CD45 (monoclonal, clone HI30) and PerCP-Cy™5.5 mouse anti-human EpCAM (monoclonal, clone EBA-1; BD Pharmingen™, San Diego, CA, USA), respectively. FSCN1 was stained after pre-permeabilization of the cell membrane using a Transcription Factor Buffer Set (BD Pharmingen) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against fascin (phospho-Ser39) conjugated to PE (Biorbyt Ltd., Cambridge, UK). FSCN1 + Ultrathin sections (7 µm) of tumor tissue were prepared for immunofluorescence analysis using a Leica RM2255 microtome (Leica Biosystems, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). Staining was performed using a Bond RXm immunostainer (Leica Biosystems). Nuclei in sections were counterstained with DAPI (Leica Biosystems). The panels of marker antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and Opal fluorochromes (Akoya Biosciences, Marlborough, MA, USA) used included: anti-fascin, polyclonal (570; 620); anti-CD20, polyclonal (650); anti-CD68 (clone KP1; 690); and anti-smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4; 690) ( Supplementary Tables 1 2 Supplementary Methods In HNSCC patients with lymph node metastases (T2–4N1M0), serum levels of FSCN1 were 10-fold higher than in patients without clinically confirmed regional lymph node metastases (T1–4N0M0; P Fig. 1A Р Fig. 1B Figure 1 Expression of FSCN1 in HNSCC patient samples.

This prevented adequate statistical analysis in HNSCC patient groups stratified by pathological differentiation of the tumor (four well-differentiated and 25 moderately differentiated tumors), sex (five female patients), and median age.
