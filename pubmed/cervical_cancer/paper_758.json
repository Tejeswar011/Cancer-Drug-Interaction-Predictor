Introduction In this comprehensive narrative review, we analyze how artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies are shaping contemporary spine surgery and spine care. By examining advanced applications from diagnostic imaging to predictive genomics, we take an in-depth look at how sophisticated AI algorithms are revolutionizing multiple domains of orthopedic and spine-focused medicine, including automated radiological interpretation, surgical planning optimization, robotic-assisted procedures, and personalized risk stratification through genomic analysis. Current evidence demonstrates that AI-powered systems such as Aidoc’s cervical spine fracture detection [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 2. Methodology This narrative review was conducted as a structured narrative synthesis of peer-reviewed literature, regulatory reports, and industry documentation related to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications in spine care. The aim was to provide a comprehensive overview of validated AI tools, clinical decision support systems, genomic integration models, and robotic surgical platforms in contemporary spinal diagnostics and intervention; it does not present original experimental data. 2.1. Literature Search Strategy The literature search was conducted between January 2024 and May 2025 across PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. Search terms included “artificial intelligence AND spine surgery,” “machine learning AND spinal imaging,” “robotic spine systems,” “spinal genomics,” “polygenic risk score AND spine,” “ambient clinical intelligence,” and “federated learning in healthcare.” Boolean operators were used to refine the scope. References were also drawn from FDA medical device databases and reports (e.g., HealthVCF 510(k) clearance, 2020 [ 7 8 Only English-language sources published between 2007 and 2025 were considered. Priority was given to high-impact clinical studies, FDA-approved systems, externally validated models, and articles published in peer-reviewed journals with known impact factors. Foundational studies on algorithm development and AI architectures dating back to 2007 (e.g., Gstoettner et al. on Cobb angle measurement accuracy [ 9 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Studies were included if they met at least one of the following criteria: Described AI/ML systems used in spine diagnostics, surgical planning, or outcome prediction (e.g., SpineNetV2 2017 [ 3 10 11 12 1 13 14 15 5 16 17 Reported external validation results of AI-based tools in spinal imaging (e.g., Yeh et al., 2021 [ 18 3 Detailed FDA-cleared robotic systems with spine-specific capabilities (e.g., Mazor X, 2021 [ 3 5 16 19 10 20 Investigated genomic risk stratification or pharmacogenomic frameworks applied to spinal pathologies (e.g., Sigala et al., 2023 [ 6 21 Described ambient clinical intelligence or documentation automation tools with demonstrated implementation in spine-related clinical settings (e.g., Nuance DAX, 2024 [ 22 23 Excluded were unpublished conference abstracts, non-peer-reviewed preprints (unless containing novel datasets or architectures), non-English publications, and studies lacking clear methodological description or validation metrics. 2.3. Data Extraction and Synthesis Key information extracted included the following: system/tool name, validation methodology (e.g., peer-reviewed study, FDA clearance, or real-world data), clinical domain of application (diagnostic imaging, robotics, genomics, etc.), performance metrics (e.g., AUC, sensitivity/specificity, error rates), and year of publication. Data were synthesized into thematic domains including (1) diagnostic imaging and automated classification; (2) morphometric and functional analysis; (3) surgical robotics and navigation; (4) genomic and pharmacogenomic personalization; (5) documentation and decision support; and (6) cost-effectiveness and health systems modeling. The extracted data were organized into summary tables (e.g., Table 1 Table 2 2.4. Risk of Bias and Validation Considerations To assess generalizability and real-world relevance, we prioritized studies that included external validation cohorts (e.g., SpineNetV2, validated in 2022–2024), FDA-approved platforms (e.g., HealthVCF, 2020 [ 7 8 1 13 14 48 49 50 20 51 3. Current Applications of AI in Imaging and Radiological Analysis 3.1. Automated Detection and Classification of Spinal Pathologies AI, and more importantly, the resultant sophisticated deep learning algorithms, are increasingly capable of detecting and classifying complex pathological conditions, largely changing clinical practice. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models designed to process images by automatically learning which visual features matter for a task (for example, detecting lesions on an X-ray or classifying a scan). Rather than requiring manually engineered image descriptors, CNNs ingest large, labeled imaging datasets and build a hierarchy of spatial features: early processing emphasizes simple patterns (edges, textures), while deeper processing combines those elements into organ- or pathology-level representations. This hierarchical, data-driven feature learning is a practical reason CNNs have advanced diagnostic image analysis. [ 24 In clinical practice CNNs are applied to both image-level tasks (e.g., classification such as “tumor present/absent”) and pixel-level tasks (e.g., segmentation or localization), and they can produce auxiliary outputs such as heatmaps that help indicate influential regions. Their performance depends strongly on the quality and quantity of annotated training data and on robust validation, but when well-trained, they achieve high sensitivity and specificity across many imaging tasks [ 25 26 52 53 54 55 Appendix A Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly integrated into routine radiographic evaluation of the spine. They can automate the detection, localization, and characterization of fractures and other pathologies across modalities, thereby reducing missed injuries and accelerating diagnosis. Research studies across radiography, CT, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) demonstrate the breadth and performance of modern CNN approaches. On plain thoracolumbar radiographs, a deep convolutional neural network achieved an accuracy of 86.0%, sensitivity of 84.7%, and specificity of 87.3% for vertebral fracture detection; a performance that was non-inferior to orthopedic and spine surgeons [ 29 56 30 36 Cervical spine findings mirror these advances. A hybrid transfer-learning approach that combined Inception-ResNet-v2 with U-Net for CT-based cervical vertebra fracture detection reported an overall accuracy of 98.44% on a large test set, outperforming radiologist predictions [ 31 32 57 35 58 59 60 30 33 34 36 61 Given their effectiveness, there has been a push for creation of commercial CNNs aimed at being implemented in hospital workflow, such as the Zebra Medical Vision’s FDA-cleared HealthVCF. HealthVCF version 5.1.1 is a CNN based software that accurately detects moderate-to-severe vertebral compression fractures (VCFs), which seamlessly integrates into the existing hospital Picture Archive and Communication (PAC) infrastructures [ 7 7 62 62 Beyond its general accuracy, HealthVCF was able to identify fractures that radiologists failed to report in 42.8% of positive scans, and it identified 38 additional ones from the scans [ 62 In practice, these AI accuracies have been translated into clinical tools. For example, an FDA-cleared CNN triage system (Aidoc) for acute cervical spine fractures reported ~94.8% overall diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity ≈ 89.8%, specificity ≈ 95.3%) in one large study [ 63 63 Besides fractures, CNNs have been applied extensively in lumbar spine MRI to identify degenerative disk diseases. For example, herniated disks on axial T2 MRI can be detected and graded by deep learning models. Zhang et al. developed a two-stage deep model (Faster R-CNN for detection + ResNeXt101 for classification) to identify and grade lumbar disk herniation according to the Michigan State University (MSU) classification [ 64 64 64 CNNs can also grade disk degeneration (e.g., Pfirrmann grades). For instance, a recent YOLOv5-based model simultaneously detected and graded disk degeneration, herniation, and high-intensity zones on lumbar MRI [ 65 65 Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is another area where CNNs have shown promise. Tumko et al. (2024) designed a three-stage CNN: one stage segments relevant anatomy, and two stages separately classify stenosis for central canal, lateral recess, and foraminal regions [ 66 66 37 37 67 67 While some AI models are focused on detecting pathologies traditionally identified by radiologists, radiomics focuses on capturing patterns on radiographical images that are not visible to the human eye [ 38 38 38 The application of radiomics in spine relation pathologies ranges from grading spinal degeneration to determining ideologies of infectious spondylitis. For example, Xie et al. (2024) developed an MRI radiomics workflow to automatically classify cervical disk degeneration [ 68 68 68 Radiomics also enhances tumor characterization and prognostication in the spine. For instance, spinal multiple myeloma and metastatic lesions often look similar on MRI, but Cao et al. (2024) showed that a radiomics model using T2 and contrast-enhanced T1 MRI could distinguish myeloma from metastasis with a ~86% accuracy (AUC ≈ 0.87) [ 39 41 Radiomics has likewise revealed hidden cues in non-neoplastic spine disorders. In infectious spondylitis, MRI radiomic signatures can differentiate etiologies that overlap with imaging. Qin et al. (2025) [ 69 69 40 Overall, these studies demonstrate that radiomics systematically uncovers image features (e.g., texture, shape, intensity patterns) that are usually imperceivable by the naked eye. By transforming subtle imaging heterogeneity into quantitative biomarkers, radiomics augments conventional spine imaging and enhances diagnostic precision in conditions ranging from degenerative disk disease to tumors, infections, and fractures. In essence, radiomics provides additional data beyond visual inspection, enabling earlier detection and more accurate characterization of spine pathology. Despite their promise, current AI tools in spine imaging still require rigorous validation across diverse patient populations, careful integration into clinical workflows, and demonstration of consistent performance, as they are not yet universally equivalent to expert clinicians. Evidence from real-world evaluations highlights this concern. For example, researchers who processed approximately 10,000 CT scans with HealthVCF at a Danish hospital reported a sensitivity of 0.68 (68%, 95% CI 0.581–0.776) and a specificity of 0.91 (91%, 95% CI 0.89–0.928) [ 42 42 The urgency of addressing this limitation is amplified by the fact that numerous AI systems entered clinical practice without undergoing thorough validation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prior to 2025. Clark et al. examined 119 medical devices marketed as AI- or ML-enabled and found that 23 (19.3%) displayed discrepancies or ambiguities between their advertised capabilities and actual FDA clearance [ 20 51 3.2. Advanced Morphometric Analysis and Quantitative Assessment AI-driven segmentation is rapidly transforming spinal radiographic imaging by automating the precise delineation and labeling of vertebral bodies, intervertebral disks, neural foramina, and other anatomical landmarks. Automated segmentation and labeling remove much of the repetitive manual workload, reduce inter-observer variability, and create the consistent regions of interest required for downstream quantification (e.g., Cobb angles, Pfirrmann grading, canal cross-sectional area). By converting anatomy into structured, pixel-accurate masks, these tools enable reproducible measurements, longitudinal monitoring, and the reliable extraction of radiomic features that feed diagnostic and prognostic models. New tools, such as SpineNet by Jamaludin et al., represent a landmark achievement in comprehensive spinal analysis, as they can automate segmentation and label spinal structures across various imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI) [ 10 70 10 70 9 11 Other networks such as Spine-GAN 71 43 Critically, these advanced AI platforms are beginning to prove robust across settings. Open-source models like SpineNetV2, an updated second-generation version of SpinNet, have undergone external validation in independent datasets. In one study, SpineNetV2 showed “strong performance” in predicting disk pathologies: Cohen’s κ and related metrics exceeded 0.7 for most evaluated features, although foraminal stenosis and herniation were somewhat harder [ 3 49 These AI automated segmentation advances are also opening new modality frontiers. Ultrasound spine images are notoriously difficult for analysis given their low contrast and speckled noise, but attention-based deep networks have made segmentation feasible. Jiang et al. (2022) introduced the ultrasound global guidance block network (UGBNet), which incorporates spatial and channel attention to segment vertebral landmarks in noisy ultrasound scans [ 72 72 AI is similarly transforming quantitative measurements of spinal alignment. Conventional manual Cobb angle measurements have 95% confidence intervals on the order of 4–8°, while deep learning has markedly improved consistency with mean absolute errors consistently below 3° ( Figure 1 18 Figure 2 73 44 Deep networks have also been developed specifically for landmark localization. Yeh et al. (2021) trained models on 2,210 lateral spine X-rays of diverse pathology to detect 45 anatomical landmarks and automatically compute 18 key sagittal parameters (e.g., C2–C7 angle, SVA, pelvic tilt) [ 18 18 These capabilities are being packaged into practical tools. For instance, CobbAngle Pro is a smartphone app that employs deep learning to analyze mobile photos of spine X-rays and output scoliosis curvature. Field users (e.g., combat medics or rural clinicians) can simply photograph the radiograph, and the app will identify vertebral endplates and draw Cobb angles automatically. Published reports indicate this app’s measurements agree closely with expert readers across mild, moderate, and severe scoliosis [ 45 46 45 46 Another advanced development is tissue segmentation. Models are now demonstrating automated quantification of paravertebral muscle characteristics, including cross-sectional areas and fatty infiltration patterns that correlate with functional outcomes and disability measures. A primary example of this is the CTSpine1K dataset, which has annotations for over 11,000 vertebrae including both healthy and pathological specimens [ 47 47 50 Another significant application is AI-enabled image reconstruction and enhancement. Modern imaging modalities, such as MRI and CT, often face trade-offs between image resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and scan time. AI tools, such as those developed by NVIDIA Clara Imaging, use deep learning to reconstruct clearer, higher-resolution images from lower-quality raw data [ 50 Modern spine MRI and CT scans face inherent trade-offs between scan time, resolution, and noise. Recent deep learning (DL) methods have begun to overcome these limits by reconstructing high-quality images from undersampled or noisy data. In spine MRI, DL reconstruction can dramatically speed up exams while maintaining (or improving) image quality. For example, a prospective study of lumbar spine MRI found that a DL-reconstructed turbo spin-echo protocol (TSE-DL) cut scan time by ~45% (i.e., 2:55 vs. 5:17 min) versus standard imaging, without compromising overall image quality or pathology detection [ 75 76 77 DL is also used to generate or enhance MRI sequences that would otherwise require extra scan time. For instance, a synthetic STIR (Short Tau Inversion Recovery) image can be generated by a neural network from routine T1/T2 images. One study showed that synthetic STIR reduced the dedicated STIR acquisition by ~3 min, yet yielded significantly higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) than a standard STIR; radiologists found the synthetic STIR images diagnostically interchangeable with the real STIR [ 78 79 78 79 In spine CT, AI-powered reconstruction mainly targets noise reduction and dose savings. Modern scanners already use iterative reconstruction, but DL reconstruction (e.g., GE’s TrueFidelity or ClariCT.AI) can push quality further. In one 2025 clinical study, lumbar CT scans were processed with a DL denoising algorithm, ClariCT.AI, and compared to standard filtered back-projection [ 80 80 81 AI can also fuse modalities to enhance spine evaluation. A striking example is MRI-based synthetic CT (sCT) of the spine. In a multicenter study of acute cervical spine trauma, an AI algorithm generated CT-like bone images from routine MRI. The sCT images detected 97.3% of fractures (sensitivity) and showed near-perfect agreement with actual CT in measuring vertebral heights and alignment [ 82 82 Together, these studies illustrate the real-world clinical value of AI reconstructions. DL-enhanced MRI protocols allow substantially shorter spine exams (often 40–60% faster) while maintaining or improving image quality [ 76 77 80 81 81 82 76 3.3. AI’s Ability to Enhance Workflow AI is increasingly being applied to optimize clinical workflow in spinal imaging. One key frontier is scanning triage, where AI algorithms automatically prioritize studies that show critical or urgent findings, ensuring that radiologists review these cases first and reducing delays in time-sensitive diagnoses [ 83 84 AI triage tools are increasingly deployed to flag urgent spinal pathologies and streamline radiology workflow. For example, Aidoc’s FDA-cleared cervical-spine fracture algorithm automatically analyzes trauma CT scans and prioritizes patients with potential fractures by sending them to the top of the radiologist’s patient list [ 13 This quick alert helps reduce diagnostic time; researchers found a 16 min (46%) reduction in time to diagnosis for positive cases of cervical spine fractures when using Aidoc compared to traditional methods [ 63 85 In sum, AI triage in spine imaging ensures that critical findings are recognized and reported more rapidly. Systems like Aidoc’s C-spine algorithm platform illustrate how deep learning can flag urgent pathology and automatically notify clinicians. This process improves overall workflow by focusing radiologist attention on high-priority cases first, reducing the risk of missed injuries, and shortening diagnostic delays. Early clinical results suggest that these tools can significantly cut report wait times and length of stay for patients. Moreover, opportunistic AI screening (e.g., algorithms that detect vertebral fragility fractures on routine CT) can identify otherwise undetected spine injuries in thousands of patients. By integrating AI alerts into the PACS and reporting system, radiology departments can achieve faster turnaround, more consistent detection of acute spine findings, and more efficient communication with treating teams. However, recent external validation studies have highlighted important limitations, particularly in detecting chronic fractures and subtle pathological changes amid varying fracture characteristics and imaging quality [ 86 87 Large language models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing-driven (NLP-driven) tools are beginning to automate the creation of radiology reports from spine imaging data. Many current systems combine image analysis (e.g., segmentation, detection, measurements) with templated language output. For example, SmartSoft’s FDA-cleared CoLumbo software Version 3 analyzes lumbar spine MRIs, identifying and measuring vertebral structures and pathologies, and then creates a detailed draft report with the findings that clinicians can edit [ 88 89 90 91 92 Beyond rule-based reporting, generative AI is also being introduced into radiology workflows. For instance, Nuance/Microsoft’s PowerScribe Smart Impression uses an LLM to automatically draft the impression section of a report from the imaging findings that are highly rated for scientific terminology, coherence, and comprehensiveness; these reports either matched or exceeded human performance in clarity and completeness [ 93 94 Importantly, integrating AI outputs into the reporting workflow has proven efficiency benefits. For example, an “AI-to-structured-report” pipeline was developed for chest X-rays, in which AI findings automatically populate a structured report template. Reports generated with this pipeline were completed in significantly less time (mean ~67 s) than traditional free-text reports (~86 s) and were rated as higher quality [ 95 4. Surgical Planning and Robotic-Assisted Interventions 4.1. Advanced Preoperative Planning and Simulation Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed preoperative planning in spinal surgery, shifting the paradigm from generalized heuristics toward patient-specific, data-driven optimization. Traditional imaging review and surgeon experience remain foundational, but modern AI-powered platforms now extract detailed biomechanical and anatomical features from CT and MRI to build 3D reconstructions tailored to each patient [ 16 One significant development is the incorporation of finite element analysis (FEA) into AI-driven platforms. By simulating load-bearing mechanics under various conditions, FEA helps forecast implant longevity, risk of hardware failure, and the distribution of spinal stresses post-fusion [ 96 Robotic platforms are embedding these tools into their workflows. The Mazor X Stealth Edition integrates predictive planning with robotic navigation, enabling surgeons to simulate screw placement in virtual environments before transferring the plan intraoperatively [ 17 17 19 97 Peer-reviewed validation studies highlight the accuracy of such systems. Jia et al. demonstrated that an AI-driven planning algorithm designed screws that were not only larger and longer than those chosen manually, but also safer: 85.1% of AI-suggested screws achieved a Grade A accuracy (i.e., no cortical breach) compared to 64.9% in freehand techniques [ 98 99 Imaging innovation is extending planning into radiation-conscious domains. A study by Levi Chazen et al. showed that deep learning-reconstructed 3D MRI could mimic CT for pedicle screw planning, achieving nearly identical geometric accuracy [ 100 The next frontier lies in adaptive, intelligent planning frameworks. The SafeRPlan model exemplifies this evolution, applying deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to refine screw trajectories intraoperatively. Importantly, it integrates safety filters to mitigate errors, representing a step toward autonomous yet surgeon-supervised planning systems [ 101 4.2. Robotic-Assisted Surgical Execution Robotics in spine surgery is evolving from navigational assistance toward true AI-driven co-surgeons. Early systems like ROSA Spine or da Vinci SP functioned primarily as stabilizers for surgeon-guided trajectories, but modern platforms increasingly incorporate AI for dynamic adjustment and real-time control [ 102 The VELYS™ Active Robotic-Assisted System, developed by DePuy Synthes with eCential Robotics, exemplifies this shift. FDA-cleared for use across cervical, thoracolumbar, and sacroiliac fusions, VELYS employs active robotics with independent navigation that recalibrates in response to intraoperative imaging and even subtle patient movement [ 102 103 Medtronic has also advanced robotic intelligence by linking its Mazor platform with real-time analytics. The system integrates intraoperative CT, fluoroscopy, and MRI, dynamically updating trajectories when deviations occur [ 104 105 106 107 Importantly, the trend is toward self-improving systems. Cloud-based federated learning allows robotic platforms to assimilate global datasets, tracking outcomes across institutions, while maintaining patient privacy [ 108 Early experimental work suggests where this is heading: DRL-driven robotic frameworks that autonomously adjust trajectories in real time. These models learn to adapt to intraoperative conditions such as tissue deformation, with built-in safeguards to ensure error containment [ 101 4.3. Integration with Advanced Navigation and Guidance Systems Navigation technologies remain the backbone of precision in spine surgery, but AI is fundamentally reshaping how guidance is achieved. Brainlab Curve Navigation, for example, now couples intraoperative CT and fluoroscopy with AI-based registration to accelerate setup and improve accuracy in pedicle screw placement [ 109 Stryker’s NAV3i expands this model through automatic landmark recognition, which simplifies registration in anatomically complex cases such as scoliosis [ 27 28 Zimmer Biomet’s ROSA ONE Spine and NuVasive’s Pulse platforms add further layers with AI-enabled augmented reality (AR) overlays. These overlays visualize planned screw paths directly in the surgical field, while feedback systems dynamically warn surgeons of deviation from optimal parameters [ 110 111 112 Emerging techniques now bypass traditional markers altogether. A deep neural network was recently used to segment the lumbar spine directly from RGB-D camera input, enabling AR-guided navigation with registration errors averaging ~1.2 mm and 100% pedicle screw accuracy in ex vivo testing [ 113 114 Together, these approaches illustrate the convergence of AI, robotics, and AR/VR into fully integrated surgical ecosystems, where each component strengthens the accuracy and safety of the others. 4.4. Functional Outcome Prediction and Treatment Optimization Beyond intraoperative execution, AI is increasingly applied to predicting recovery and optimizing long-term outcomes. This is particularly relevant in spine surgery, where radiographic success does not always correlate with patient satisfaction or functional improvement. Recent work with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), GAN, and Transformer models demonstrates the potential of integrating diverse datasets, ranging from imaging biomarkers to psychosocial indices, to predict complications, pain persistence, or quality-of-life outcomes [ 115 116 117 118 NLP represents another frontier. By mining clinical notes, postoperative journals, or patient-reported text, NLP algorithms can quantify subtle psychological factors such as anxiety, resilience, or depressive sentiment that heavily influence recovery ( Figure 3 119 120 121 Wearable technology provides the data backbone for these predictive frameworks. Devices such as ActiGraph GT9X and WHOOP Strap 4.0 generate continuous physiological, activity, and sleep data [ 123 124 125 Early pilot studies suggest that integrating intraoperative robotic performance metrics (e.g., screw placement accuracy, time to completion) with postoperative wearable-derived physiology may produce holistic predictions of recovery trajectories. Such models could ultimately drive adaptive, individualized rehabilitation regimens, optimizing both functional outcomes and patient satisfaction. 4.5. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Despite these technical advances, the sustainability of AI in spine surgery depends on its economic justification. Health systems operating under value-based care frameworks increasingly demand demonstration that technology improves outcomes relative to costs [ 126 74 127 128 Cost-effectiveness studies of navigation and robotics generally report improved accuracy, shorter operating times, and reduced complication rates. However, high acquisition and maintenance costs, coupled with steep training curves, remain major barriers to adoption [ 129 Future frameworks may need to incorporate behavioral economics and complexity theory, assessing not just cost per procedure but how surgeon learning, institutional adoption, and interdisciplinary workflows evolve in response to AI integration [ 9 129 5. Genomic Applications and Precision Medicine 5.1. Genome-Wide Association Studies in Spine Surgery Risk Assessment Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) leveraging national biobanks (e.g., UK Biobank, FinnGen) are beginning to clarify the heritable architecture of spinal disease and perioperative risk. In surgically managed adult spinal deformity (ASD), a study of 540 patients identified 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with surgical risk, with the LDB2 variant (rs12913832) showing the most robust signal and implicating ectodermal differentiation pathways in spinal morphogenesis and repair [ 21 130 131 132 133 134 132 133 134 135 136 Translating these associations into clinical utility requires aggregation and contextualization. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) that combine genome-wide variant weights with clinical covariates (body-mass index, radiographic severity, comorbidity indices) now permit probabilistic stratification of patients for adverse outcomes, examples include heightened predicted risk for pseudarthrosis tied to SMAD3-related signaling and elevated reoperation probability in certain genetic strata [ 137 138 139 Beyond risk assessment, the field is exploring interventional genomics. Ongoing translational efforts and early-phase trials investigate gene-editing (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9) and small-molecule modulation of GWAS-implicated targets such as NFU1 in stenosis and GSDMC in inflammatory disk degeneration, highlighting a therapeutic horizon where genotype guides targeted molecular therapy in conjunction with surgical management [ 140 5.2. Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Pain Management Pharmacogenomics is increasingly relevant to postoperative analgesia and medication safety in spine surgery. Allelic variation in cytochrome P450 enzymes—principally CYP2D6 and CYP3A4—substantially influences opioid pharmacokinetics and clinical response: CYP2D6 poor metabolizers risk inadequate conversion of prodrugs such as codeine, whereas ultra-rapid metabolizers face overdose risk from active metabolites, a nuance critical for perioperative prescribing [ 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 5.3. Multi-Omics Analysis Integrative multi-omics platforms operationalize complex molecular datasets to delineate pathobiology and predict therapeutic response. Cloud-enabled pipelines (Seven Bridges, DNAnexus) now permit the harmonized analysis of genomics (GWAS/PheWAS), proteomics (e.g., Olink Target 96 inflammation assays), metabolomics (Metabolon HD4), and single-cell transcriptomics (10× Genomics) to map dysregulated pathways in spinal disease [ 150 151 22 6. Clinical Decision Support and Documentation Systems 6.1. Ambient Clinical Intelligence and Documentation Automation Ambient clinical intelligence (ACI) platforms have substantially reconfigured documentation workflows in contemporary practice. Systems such as Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX) and Suki AI combine advanced speech recognition with natural language processing to generate clinical notes directly from physician–patient conversations [ 23 Specialty-focused charting solutions further extend these capabilities. For example, Ambience Healthcare provides co-pilot functionality for pre-charting, real-time scribing, and automated post-visit summaries [ 48 48 Across implementations, the principal reported benefit is a reduction in after-hours documentation and associated clerical burden, which can improve clinician work–life balance and reduce the risk of burnout. Importantly, these technologies are positioned as augmentative rather than replacement tools: clinicians retain supervisory control, reviewing and validating algorithm-generated content. This human–AI collaboration functions as a check-and-balance that both streamlines documentation and mitigates charting errors, while preserving clinician accountability and the integrity of the medical record. 6.2. Clinical Decision Support Systems AI-enabled clinical decision support systems (CDSS) deliver real-time, evidence-based guidance to assist diagnosis, therapeutic selection, and management optimization in spine care. IBM Watson for Clinical Decision Support exemplifies the marriage of cognitive computing and clinical expertise, mining large bodies of medical literature together with patient-level data to produce tailored treatment recommendations [ 14 152 Critical to their utility is the ability to integrate heterogeneous data streams (e.g., imaging features, demographics, comorbidities, and operative variables) to perform comprehensive risk stratification and outcome prediction. Continuous learning mechanisms permit these systems to incorporate new research findings and real-world outcomes, progressively refining their recommendations. Moreover, real-time analytics deliver dynamic risk updates as a patient’s status evolves or as intraoperative information becomes available, enabling proactive adjustments to management plans that aim to optimize clinical outcomes. 7. Current Challenges, Limitations, and Implementation Barriers 7.1. Technical and Algorithmic Limitations The adoption of novel AI technologies into routine spine care remains constrained by several interrelated technical and algorithmic limitations. Prominent examples illustrate limited generalizability: systems developed for cervical spine fracture detection (e.g., Aidoc) and joint assessment (e.g., Zebra Medical Vision’s HealthVCF) have demonstrated performance drops when applied to imaging produced under different protocols or scanner vendors. Variations in slice thickness, field of view, and contrast administration commonly degrade model performance when these algorithms encounter unfamiliar datasets. In practice, complete harmonization across major vendors (e.g., GE, Siemens, Philips) is unrealistic, and algorithm robustness must therefore be addressed through design and deployment strategies rather than idealized standardization [ 15 153 154 Hardware-related artifacts further complicate reliable performance. Metallic implants, frequent in revision spine surgery, produce signal distortions that have led to segmentation failures in systems such as SpineNet when processing MRI scans with titanium hardware [ 155 Algorithmic limitations also arise from the intrinsic heterogeneity and rarity of certain pathologies. SpineNet and similar tools exhibit weaker performance in grading disk degeneration and quantifying spondylolisthesis for less common conditions; examples include sacral chordomas, which present atypical anatomy, histopathology, and metastatic patterns that are poorly represented in training sets [ 156 157 158 Dataset bias and representativeness are additional, persistent problems. Publicly available collections (e.g., CTSpine1K) and many institutional repositories disproportionately reflect urban, academic practice populations, leaving rural and underserved patient presentations underrepresented. Geographic, linguistic, and practice-pattern variations therefore create sampling biases that limit external validity. Retrospective curation further compounds the issue through selection effects. Consequently, no training corpus can be entirely comprehensive or error-free, an unavoidable constraint that must be acknowledged during model evaluation and clinical deployment. Longitudinal assessment poses yet another technical challenge. Many current models are cross-sectional by design, inhibiting consistent tracking of disease progression across pre- and postoperative intervals. This limitation is particularly consequential for practices without access to high-performance computing resources. Smaller private groups and many community hospitals may be unable to bear the USD 500,000–USD 1 million capital costs associated with real-time processing infrastructure, a disparity that persists alongside the closure of over 140 U.S. hospitals since 2010 [ 159 160 161 162 7.2. Regulatory and Validation Challenges Regulatory pathways and validation requirements introduce additional barriers. The FDA’s evolving framework struggles to accommodate continuous learning systems, such as those embedded in platforms like Mazor X Stealth Edition, where post-market performance may change as algorithms adapt. Worryingly, a 2022 analysis found that 226 of 521 FDA-cleared AI devices lacked peer-reviewed clinical validation, raising questions about the evidence base supporting many deployed tools and the potential risks to patient safety [ 51 Robust, multi-institutional validation, necessary to demonstrate generalizability across heterogeneous care settings, is logistically and financially demanding. Collaborative validation efforts that coordinate datasets across rural and urban hospitals have been estimated to cost on the order of USD 250,000 annually, limiting participation by resource-constrained centers and slowing generation of high-quality external evidence [ 163 164 Physician skepticism compounds these challenges. Concerns about workflow disruption, loss of autonomy, and uncertain reimbursement influence adoption decisions, small practices are particularly sensitive to economic pressures, and recent Medicare payment reductions for spine procedures (2024) have further constrained capital investments such as robotic platforms (e.g., ExcelsiusGPS) [ 165 7.3. Clinical Integration and Workflow Challenges Finally, integrating AI into the clinical ecosystem challenges established workflows and cultural norms. Intergenerational differences shape expectations: some senior clinicians view tools like automated scribes (e.g., DeepScribe) as encroachments on clinical autonomy, while newer clinicians expect seamless EHR integration and interoperability to reduce clerical burden [ 166 7.4. Data Quality, Generalization, and Statistical Stability Despite promising diagnostic accuracy in controlled research settings, AI-driven spine imaging tools remain fundamentally constrained by data quality and representativeness. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) implicitly assume that training and clinical images share the same statistical properties; any distribution shift (e.g., different scanner vendors, acquisition protocols, or patient populations) can markedly degrade performance [ 167 168 167 168 24 167 24 167 169 169 Typical medical datasets are often small, imbalanced, and collected under narrow conditions. High-quality labels require expert effort and are expensive, so many available datasets contain annotation errors, ambiguity, or limited case diversity [ 24 170 167 170 168 170 Training data should be expertly annotated to cover the full spectrum of disease presentations and patient demographics to ensure reliability and clinical relevance. In reality, datasets vary widely in annotation quality and scope: multi-site collections can suffer from inconsistent protocols and labeling conventions, and retrospective curation often favors easily obtainable cases (e.g., urban hospitals or clear-cut pathology), thereby omitting rare presentations or underrepresented populations [ 171 171 171 Beyond data composition, statistical rigor in model evaluation is essential for stability and trust. Models trained on small or narrow datasets are prone to overfitting, and a number of systematic reviews have found that many published AI studies rely solely on cross-validation with small samples and omit sample-size calculations, a significant methodological shortcoming [ 171 171 Finally, AI systems must remain statistically stable over time. After deployment, data distributions commonly drift because of changes in equipment, protocols, or patient populations; even well-calibrated models can misbehave on shifted inputs. Responsible implementations therefore include ongoing data monitoring and drift detection (e.g., checking input histograms or outcome rates), with retraining or recalibration triggered as needed. Regulatory guidance is beginning to address these concerns: for adaptive or continuous learning systems, an Algorithm Change Protocol is advised to specify retraining criteria and requisite validation steps after any update [ 24 7.5. Bias, Fairness, and Subgroup Performance AI tools can unintentionally perpetuate or worsen healthcare disparities when training data reflects historical biases. Experts caution that deployment must assess not just overall accuracy but performance across demographic subgroups [ 172 172 172 To uncover and mitigate these biases, subgroup performance must be reported explicitly. Recent reporting guidelines (i.e., TRIPOD-AI) now require that model evaluations include metrics with confidence intervals for each key subgroup (e.g., race, sex, age, or other clinically relevant categories) [ 173 173 When biases are identified, steps should be taken to mitigate them. These steps might include rebalancing training data (e.g., adding more examples from underrepresented groups) or incorporating fairness-aware algorithms that penalize disparate error rates. Importantly, even good fairness performance in the training context is not guaranteed to hold after deployment: models must also be tested for bias under distribution shifts [ 172 7.6. External Validation, Robustness, and Failure-Mode Testing Demonstrating an AI model’s robustness requires testing beyond its own training environment. Numerous systematic reviews have found that radiology AI algorithms suffer performance drops when tested on external data. In one review, fully 81% of published external validations showed a decline in accuracy on new datasets, with about a quarter showing large (≥0.10) drops in AUC [ 174 29 56 Robustness to edge cases and data shifts is also critical. AI systems should be explicitly stress-tested with challenging cases. A concrete illustration of the pitfalls of scale comes from Roccetti et al. (2019), who found that training on a very large, uncurated time-series initially produced poor results until the dataset’s “semantics of validity” and inclusion criteria were defined and a representative subset curated, after which performance improved substantially [ 169 29 30 A further layer of validation comes from shadow deployments. Before entrusting AI with patient care, many institutions run it in parallel: the model receives real imaging data and makes predictions, but clinicians do not act on them. This “shadow mode” allows observation of the AI’s real-time performance and failure modes without any risk to patients [ 31 31 32 7.7. The Gap Between Promising Research and Clinical Reality Despite promising results on curated datasets, AI models have inherent limitations that temper their clinical utility. First, most AI algorithms do not truly “understand” disease the way humans do; they learn statistical patterns, which may not hold outside the training context [ 171 171 171 35 171 Second, many technical challenges remain. Deep learning models are often “black boxes” with limited interpretability. This opacity can hinder trust and obscure failure modes; currently there is no guarantee that a given model will behave sensibly on a rare case or under adversarial perturbations. Relatedly, most AI studies focus on single-timepoint classification and do not model patient longitudinally or causally; they lack an understanding of progression over time. There is also the issue of calibration: AI confidence scores can be poorly calibrated, giving a misleading sense of certainty. Handling domain shifts and adversarial examples, intentional or not, remains an active research problem. In short, current models do not self-correct when facing truly new challenges. Finally, practical deployment limitations cannot be ignored. Regulatory pathways for AI are still evolving, and most models enter the clinic with limited evidence: few have randomized trial validation or real-world outcome studies. Even with validation, implementation requires robust IT infrastructure, privacy safeguards, and user training, which are obstacles that many hospitals struggle with. Economic and workflow factors (e.g., cost of hardware, integration into PACS, clinician workload) often become rate-limiting. In the spine imaging domain in particular, the relatively small volume of cases and the diversity of pathologies mean that algorithmic improvements have to overcome a high bar of cost and complexity. In sum, AI promises much but also has real constraints: its outputs must be interpreted in the context of clinical judgment, sound data practice, and ongoing surveillance. Only through acknowledging and addressing these limitations can safe, effective AI tools be realized. 8. Discussion The body of evidence synthesized in this review demonstrates that artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are no longer exploratory curiosities in spine care; they are operational technologies that touch imaging pipelines, preoperative planning, intraoperative navigation, postoperative monitoring, and even early translational genomics [ 3 9 10 11 13 16 17 19 43 63 70 71 83 84 85 96 97 From a practical standpoint, AI has already demonstrated clinically meaningful benefits where tasks are structured, repetitive, and well-defined. Automated fracture and acute-pathology triage systems shorten time-to-diagnosis in emergent settings [ 29 30 31 32 56 63 13 44 63 83 84 85 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 3 9 10 11 43 70 71 However, these practical benefits are often undermined by persistent performance gaps, particularly when models are deployed beyond their development environments. Recent reports showing markedly higher diagnostic accuracies than older studies likely reflect multiple converging factors, not solely algorithmic breakthroughs. Larger, better-curated training corpora, improved network architectures and transfer-learning methods, and more sophisticated image-reconstruction pipelines have raised retrospective test metrics. At the same time, reporting practices (e.g., use of internal test sets, selective case sampling, and the occasional presence of data leakage) and publication bias toward positive results can inflate apparent performance. Crucially, prospective and external evaluations frequently reveal lower, more clinically realistic performance (see, e.g., external evaluations of triage algorithms), underscoring that headline accuracy numbers should be interpreted in the context of dataset provenance, validation methodology, and deployment environment. For deployment decisions and regulatory assessment, emphasis should be placed on multi-center prospective validation, calibration reporting, and transparent failure-mode analysis. Additionally, several interlocking technical realities explain the recurring drop in performance when models leave their development environments. First, domain shift is pervasive: scanner vendors, slice thickness, acquisition protocols, contrast timing, and local reporting conventions create distributional differences that degrade generalizability [ 15 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 Beyond these technical and human challenges, current regulatory pathways were not designed for adaptive, continuously learning systems deployed across thousands of variable clinical contexts. Analyses show that many AI devices entered the clinical domain with limited peer-reviewed validation and that post-market performance monitoring is inconsistent [ 20 51 While governance is critical, evidence also suggests that requiring a technology to be clinically useful is not the same as designing it to be deployable. Successful implementations share several features: native interoperability with EHRs (FHIR/HL7 compliance), minimal workflow disruption (e.g., integration that populates structured report fields rather than forcing transcription changes), clinician-facing explainability (clear, concise model outputs with uncertainty estimates), and a staged roll-out with shadow mode, supervised use, and then live deployment [ 14 23 48 152 163 To address the issue of equitable access, the promise of AI magnifies existing inequities if models are trained and validated on narrow cohorts. Federated learning and privacy-preserving analytics provide technical pathways to broaden training datasets while minimizing raw data movement, but these must be paired with deliberate inclusion strategies (such as incentives for rural/underserved centers to participate in consortia) and prospective audits of model calibration across demographic strata [ 47 164 165 166 Ultimately, to move the field forward, research must shift from single-center optimization to multi-center external validation and prospective impact trials. Priority areas include robustness engineering (domain-adaptation methods, uncertainty quantification, and explicit failure-mode detection for edge cases such as metal hardware and severe deformity); longitudinal modeling frameworks for consistent tracking of disease state across serial imaging and clinic visits; explainability and human–AI interaction studies that produce clinically meaningful visualizations of model reasoning; federated and distributed learning initiatives to improve representativeness without compromising privacy; cost-effectiveness and outcomes research that couples clinical outcomes, quality-of-life instruments, and economic impact; and open benchmark datasets with reporting checklists (e.g., TRIPOD-AI, CONSORT-AI adaptations) [ 159 160 161 The FDA should also emphasize transparency and explainability: models should disclose interpretability methods, provide standardized uncertainty metrics, and include clinician-facing output templates that clearly distinguish prediction, confidence, and suggested action. Interoperability standards (e.g., HL7/FHIR compliance, standardized labeling) must be enforced to reduce integration costs and ensure comparability across platforms. Finally, equity and cybersecurity must be central. Systems should report subgroup-level performance, incentivize validation that includes underrepresented populations, and adhere to rigorous encryption, penetration testing, and vendor transparency standards. Through these measures, FDA guidance can both protect patients and accelerate innovation in AI for spine care [ 51 163 9. Conclusions AI and ML technologies have reached a point of clinical maturity in specific, high-value tasks within spine care: emergent triage, standardized morphometrics, surgical planning assistance, and nascent prognostic modeling [ 3 9 10 11 13 16 17 19 43 63 70 71 83 84 85 96 97 15 51 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 162 To move from demonstration to durable clinical impact, the field requires aligned action on three fronts. First, technical innovation must prioritize robustness, explainability, and longitudinal fidelity, not just peak accuracy on curated datasets. Second, implementation science must make AI a practical clinical collaborator through seamless interoperability, clinician-centered interfaces, staged rollouts, and careful change management [ 14 23 48 152 163 51 Concretely, an upgraded FDA approach, one that combines stratified premarket standards, adaptive system governance, enforced external validation, ongoing real-world performance auditing, and interoperability mandates, will both protect patients and accelerate clinically meaningful adoption. Parallel investments in federated learning, subsidized computational infrastructure for resource-limited centers, and incentives for multi-center prospective validation studies will prevent a two-tiered system in which AI-enhanced care is only accessible in well-resourced institutions [ 159 160 161 In sum, AI is poised to become an integral, augmentative element of contemporary spine care. Yet the pathway to safe, equitable, and effective scale depends as much on governance, workflow design, and economic strategy as it does on algorithmic advances. A coordinated effort among developers, clinicians, regulators, payers, and patients, guided by transparent validation, robust monitoring, and explicit equity goals, will be essential to realize AI’s promise while minimizing foreseeable harm.

This table delineates key challenges impeding the widespread adoption of AI in spine diagnostics and surgery, categorized across imaging variability, algorithmic brittleness, dataset bias, explainability deficits, regulatory complexity, infrastructure costs, and clinical integration issues. Each barrier is described in detail, along with its technical considerations, and paired with its practical clinical or operational consequences. The table aims to guide researchers, developers, and healthcare administrators in identifying systemic vulnerabilities and prioritizing translational improvements necessary for safe and scalable AI deployment in spinal healthcare. Category Barrier Technical Detail Clinical/Operational Consequence Imaging and Model Generalizability Cross-Vendor Imaging Variability Heterogeneity in scanner vendor output (e.g., GE vs. Siemens vs. Philips) causes domain shift in AI models; non-uniform slice thickness and FOV distort CNN feature extraction layers. Decreased classification precision for compression fractures; high false-negative rates in under-standardized imaging environments. Hardware-Induced Artifacts Metallic Implant Interference Titanium-induced susceptibility artifacts in T1/T2 MRI sequences disrupt segmentation accuracy in deep neural networks like SpineNet and V-Net variants. Invalidated predictions in post-fusion patients; potential for underestimation of central canal and foraminal compromise. Pathological Heterogeneity Low Representation of Rare Tumors Model sensitivity drops when exposed to rare presentations (e.g., sacral chordomas, extradural myxopapillary ependymomas) due to weak class priors and minimal edge-case training data. False negatives in tumor surveillance; unreliable outputs for oncological follow-up assessments. Training Data Bias Geographic and Socioeconomic Overfitting Training sets skewed toward tertiary care centers cause latent space misalignment for rural/underserved demographics; manifests as calibration drift in diagnostic AI systems. Inaccurate prioritization in triage algorithms; potential exacerbation of healthcare disparities. Model Explainability Opacity in Neural Attribution Maps Lack of saliency map interpretability or explainable AI (XAI) frameworks in real-time decision support; attention-based models still fall short in spine-specific pathologies. Limited clinician trust in AI output; inability to validate or refute system recommendations during multidisciplinary rounds. Infrastructure and Cost High-Cost HPC Requirements Inference latency optimization via GPU clusters (e.g., NVIDIA A100) requires capital investment exceeding $500k; suboptimal throughput without federated inference pipelines. Barriers to adoption in rural and small private clinics; delayed implementation in mid-tier health systems. Regulatory and Legal Complexity Validation of Continuous Learning Systems Regulatory frameworks not equipped for post-deployment model drift; challenge in validating self-updating AI modules under FDA’s Good Machine Learning Practice (GMLP) guidelines. Post-market liability ambiguity; disincentivizes procurement by risk-averse hospital administrators. Workflow and Physician Engagement Non-Interoperability with Legacy EHRs Lack of native HL7/FHIR compliance in AI tools (e.g., DeepScribe); interface incompatibility leads to fragmented data workflows and redundancy in documentation. Cognitive overload and duplication of work; rejection by high-volume providers. Patient-Centric Barriers Privacy Anxiety from Data Breaches 2024 cyberattack exposure of biometric and imaging datasets undermines patient confidence in AI-driven diagnostics; hesitancy persists even with federated learning protocols. Consent withdrawal and decreased utilization of AI-assisted care; limits scalability of patient-facing applications. ",
