We hypothesized that incidental screen-detected DISH may be an actionable marker for incident diabetes screening and aimed to assess the absolute incidence rate (ratio) for T2DM in cardiovascular patients with and without DISH. Methods Cardiovascular disease patients without diabetes ( n Results DISH was present in 263 (7.7%) patients. After a median follow-up of 11.1 years (IQR: 7.1–15.2), 317 patients developed T2DM. Patients with DISH had a higher incidence rate for T2DM compared with no-DISH patients (17.1 vs. 7.8 T2DM per 1000 person-years). DISH was associated with incident T2DM in multivariate analyses (IRR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.03–2.06), with the highest IRR in the DISH group with the most extensive ossification (IRR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.15–3.29). The number needed to screen for T2DM in patients with screen-detected DISH for 11.1 years was 7, similar to accepted risk markers overweight ( n n n n Conclusions DISH is associated with higher rates of incident T2DM in cardiovascular disease patients, independent of accepted risk markers. DISH could be used as an imaging marker to identify cardiovascular disease patients with an increased risk for subsequent T2DM.

DISH patients with >7 fused vertebral bodies had a 2-fold higher risk for incident diabetes. DISH may be used as imaging marker for future diabetes risk stratification. Introduction DISH is a systemic disorder characterized by the progressive formation of osseous bridging near the anterolateral spine [ 1 2 3 Fig. 1 1 4 4 5 6 7 8–10 11 4 11 12 13–15 16 Figure 1. Grade III DISH on a lateral chest radiograph (left) and sagittal computed tomography scan (right) in a 55-year-old patient. Note the bridging ossification, which cannot be explained by disc degeneration. Also note the absence of facet joint ankylosis which differentiates DISH from ankylosis spondylitis Example image of grade III DISH on a chest radiograph and CT-scan. DISH is a common incidental imaging finding, e.g. on chest radiography, the most commonly ordered radiological test, with an annual number of 129M in the USA [ 17 18 Methods Study cohort Our patient cohort is derived from the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease (UCC-SMART) study, an ongoing prospective cohort study initiated in 1996, which follows patients between the ages of 18 and 79 years with either manifest or risk factors for vascular disease [ 19 20 Physical and laboratory examinations Extensive vascular screening was performed for all included patients. This consisted of a health questionnaire on medical history, risk factors, smoking and drinking habits, and prescribed drugs. According to a standard diagnostic protocol, physical examination and laboratory testing in a fasting state were also performed [ 19 2 21 22 DISH presence and extent Using the Resnick criteria [ 3 11 Follow-up and diabetes end point assessment The primary end point for our study was incident T2DM [ 19 Statistical analysis Normal distributed data were expressed using the mean and standard deviation, and categorical variables using frequencies and percentages. Incidence rates were calculated for the DISH and no-DISH groups. Moreover, the effect of DISH on the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of incident T2DM occurrence with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) was estimated using Poisson regression models, for which the event count was the dependent variable and the individual follow-up time was included in the model as an offset. Continuous variables were transformed if they were not linearly related to the number of events. We accounted for over- or under-dispersion (i.e. less or more spread in the individual count observations than expected on the basis of the Poisson distribution). Adjustments were made for age and sex, and additionally for BMI, systolic blood pressure, non-HDL cholesterol and CKDEPI. Finally, we calculated the number needed to screen as one divided by the crude incidence rate for the overall DISH groups, and groups stratified by overweight and DISH subjects. Missing covariate data were imputed using single regression imputation for non-HDL ( n n n n P Patient and public involvement Patients and/or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of this research.

IRR: incidence rate ratio. We calculated that the follow-up of seven DISH patients with cardiovascular disease for 11.1 years would detect one case of T2DM during our study follow-up period (T2DM incidence in DISH: 14.8%). For overweight subjects, follow-up of eight patients would detect one case of T2DM (T2DM incidence 12.6%), which was five patients per case for obesity (T2DM incidence 19.7%), 13 patients per case for hyperlipidaemia (T2DM incidence 7.7%) and nine patients per case for hypertension (T2DM incidence 11.0%). In overweight subjects with DISH ( n 2 n 2 Discussion The current study aimed to evaluate the absolute risk of T2DM development in patients with DISH in a cohort of cardiovascular disease patients in comparison with established screening indicators for diabetes. We quantified the total event rate for T2DM and found that the presence of DISH was associated with an increased rate of incident T2DM. This was most pronounced for subjects with extensive vertebral ossification (grade 3 DISH: >7 fused vertebral bodies), which had a 2-fold higher risk for incident T2DM compared with subjects without DISH. Moreover, this observed association was fairly similar to obesity and overweight subjects and stronger than hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. In our cohort seven DISH patients would need to be screened for 11 years to identify one T2DM potentially earlier. Our study highlights the potential role of incidentally discovered DISH on available medical images as a marker to stratify cardiovascular disease patients with an increased risk of developing incident T2DM. DISH can be easily evaluated on various radiological examinations. Worldwide, the demand for radiological examinations continues to rise [ 18 23 24 16 25 24 26 27 27 18 2 Although for diagnosis and screening pathophysiological knowledge is not essential, previous cross-sectional studies have shown that DISH subjects have an increased prevalence of diabetes mellitus in both cardiovascular disease cohorts, as well as samples derived from the general population [ 4 11 12 28 29 14 30 31 32 30 31 33 34 Our study has multiple strengths. First, we used data from a large prospective study with uniform and standardized data collection at baseline. Second, we were able to assess associations with adjustments due to extensive data collection of cardiovascular determinants. Finally, our study population had long and complete follow-up with end point adjudication by multiple physicians, which reduced end point subjectivity assessment. The limitations of our study should also be considered. The selection of patients with chest radiographs could have resulted in the selection of subjects with a recent cardiovascular event, which could have resulted in increased selection of subjects from the UCC-SMART cohort with a higher risk. Independent of this, the UCC-SMART cohort is not a reflection of a general population or patients presenting at a general practitioner. As our study population of patients with known cardiovascular disease is enriched with known risk factors for DISH, the numbers needed to screen are presumably higher than in a lower risk population without cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we recommend external validation of our findings in a general population or first/second line medicine cohort. Another limitation is that DISH presence was not assessed at multiple time-points or at the time of T2DM event occurrence. We believe that this would have resulted in stronger associations with DISH. Therefore, future studies could also incorporate both DISH and T2DM assessment across multiple time-points. Third, we had no data available on anti-inflammatory rheumatic drugs usage in our population. However, our results were not affected by statin and anti-cholesterol therapy usage, medication characterized by its anti-inflammatory properties [ 35 36 Conclusion The presence of DISH is associated with increased rates of incident T2DM in patients with cardiovascular disease at a level similar to accepted screening criteria for incident T2DM. We found that this association was most pronounced in the DISH group with the most extensive ossification, with a 2-fold higher risk for T2DM compared with subjects without DISH. Depending on replication, DISH could be used as an imaging marker to identify individuals who have an increased risk for subsequent T2DM development.
