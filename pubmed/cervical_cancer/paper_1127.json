See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a tumor-associated antigen that is specifically expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and having relatively low levels in normal tissues. This unique expression pattern positions GPC3 as a potential target for precision therapy and drug development in HCC. Recent studies have shown significant advancements in GPC3-targeted therapies and immunotherapies, particularly for patients with advanced or treatment-resistant HCC. Although certain clinical trials have yielded suboptimal results, numerous ongoing studies continue to explore its therapeutic efficacy. This mini-review focuses on the latest research developments regarding GPC3 as a therapeutic target across various HCC treatment strategies, including monoclonal antibodies, bispecific antibodies, chimeric antigen receptor-T-cell therapies, and other innovative approaches. In addition, the limitations of GPC3-targeted therapies and their future application prospects in HCC treatment are discussed. The review particularly emphasizes the unmet need for future research directions, such as combination immunotherapy strategies and novel drug designs. Through the integration of innovative technologies and clinical validation, GPC3 holds strong potential as a promising breakthrough in the treatment of HCC, offering new opportunities for enhancing patient outcomes and improving therapeutic efficacy.

Its oncogenic effects, primarily through activation of the c-Myc signaling pathway, make it a crucial target for both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Given the high incidence and mortality rates seen in HCC patients, developing effective GPC3-targeted strategies could very well address the significantly unmet clinical need currently seen. In HCC, GPC3 is overexpressed in more than 70% of cases when compared to adjacent normal tissue, with this upregulation being strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes[ 7 8 9 10 GPC3 is primarily expressed on the surface of HCC cells but undergoes proteolytic cleavage by the enzyme Furin at Arg358 and Ser359, resulting in the release of soluble GPC3 (sGPC3) into the bloodstream[ 11 12 13 14 15 16 Importantly, GPC3-targeted therapies offer a new frontier in HCC treatment by leveraging its tumor-specific expression. Given the limitations of current HCC treatments, GPC3-targeted therapies represent a promising development in the field. Various strategies, including monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapies, are all in active development, aiming to harness GPC3’s tumor-specific expression for precise treatment. However, challenges such as optimizing delivery, overcoming tumor heterogeneity, and minimizing immune evasion must be addressed to fully realize GPC3-targeted therapy as a transformative clinical solution. These strategies aim to enhance antitumor efficacy while also minimizing off-target toxicity, addressing a major limitation to the current treatments. However, challenges remain in translating these therapies into clinical practice, including optimizing drug delivery, overcoming tumor heterogeneity, and mitigating resistance mechanisms. Further research is still needed in order to refine these approaches and better develop combinatorial strategies that will enhance treatment effectiveness. This review highlights the pivotal role of GPC3 in HCC, from its fundamental oncogenic mechanisms to its emerging role as a critical biomarker and therapeutic target. As novel GPC3-based strategies advance, they hold the potential to reshape the current landscape of HCC diagnosis and treatment, addressing the urgent need for more effective therapeutic solutions. We have critically examined the molecular mechanisms underlying GPC3's biological functions and subsequently highlighted its significance as a therapeutic target in HCC diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, we analyzed the current challenges in translating GPC3-based therapies from bench to bedside so as to optimize their clinical implementation. MOLECULAR AND BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF GPC3 GPC3 is essential for embryonic development and organogenesis. During embryogenesis, GPC3 regulates multiple regulatory pathways by modulating growth factor signaling cascades, including Wnt, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)[ 17 21 1 Figure 1  Diverse growth factor signaling pathways coordinated by glypican-3 in hepatocellular carcinoma. Under physiological conditions, GPC3 is essential for the development of various organ systems. In liver development, it regulates hepatocyte proliferation and differentiation, ensuring proper liver formation[ 17 22 19 23 20 24 25 In pathological conditions such as HCC, GPC3 is aberrantly re-expressed or overexpressed, serving as a critical regulator of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. Through its core protein and HS side chains, GPC3 interacts with both ligands and receptors, functioning as a co-receptor and scaffold to facilitate signal complex formation, thereby activating downstream effectors such as c-Myc, AKT, and ERK that drive proliferation, survival, and metastasis in HCC cells. Among the multiple oncogenic pathways regulated by GPC3, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is one of the most frequently activated (Figure 2 26 27 28 29 26 30 Figure 2  Glypican-3-mediated Wnt/β-catenin and YAP/TAZ signaling axes in hepatocellular carcinoma. GPC3 also modulates the Hippo/YAP signaling cascade. Certain Wnt ligands, upon binding to FZD receptors, can bypass β-catenin and suppress LATS1/2 kinase activity, promoting YAP nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity[ 31 32 33 e.g. 34 35 GPC3 regulates multiple growth factor pathways through its core protein and HS chains[ 36 36 37 38 39 e.g. 40 via 21 41 GPC3 in hypoxia and oncogenic signaling Recent studies have shown that under hypoxic conditions, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha upregulates GPC3 mRNA expression and promotes its secretion via 42 3 42 42 in vitro in vivo 42 Figure 3  Hypoxia-induced exosomal release of glypican-3 and its effects on hepatocellular carcinoma progression and angiogenesis. via GPC3 in metabolic adaptation and tumor stemness In addition to its role in oncogenic signaling, GPC3 plays a pivotal role in metabolic adaptation under hypoxic conditions. It promotes lactylation and cellular glycolysis, thus enhancing tumor stemness, metabolic plasticity and immune evasion[ 43 4 43 8 8 43 Figure 4  Glypican-3-mediated regulation of c-Myc stability and metabolic adaptation under hypoxia. Differential functions of GPC3 across cancer types In cervical cancer, elevated GPC3 expression promotes tumor progression. Studies have shown that GPC3 antisense long non-coding RNA (GPC3-AS1) is upregulated and cooperates with ELK1 to regulate GPC3 expression, enhancing cell proliferation and migration, thereby revealing its regulatory mechanism in cervical cancer[ 44 45 46 47 48 49 The role of GPC3 in the cancer immune microenvironment In the tumor immune microenvironment, the correlation between elevated GPC3 expression and therapeutic response has emerged as a significant area of investigation. Studies have revealed that high GPC3 expression correlates with diminished clinical efficacy and may contribute to resistance against combination therapy involving anti-PD-1 (atezolizumab) and anti-VEGF (bevacizumab) in HCC patients, potentially through interference with immune and angiogenic co-regulatory mechanisms[ 50 51 51 51 52 52 52 In vivo + 52 INNOVATIVE APPLICATIONS OF GPC3 IN HCC MOLECULAR IMAGING AND DIAGNOSTICS Molecular imaging Recent advances have enhanced GPC3-based molecular imaging for HCC diagnosis. A single-domain antibody probe (ssHN3) conjugated for selective GPC3 binding and labeled with [89Zr] demonstrated improved tumor uptake and reduced liver accumulation, optimizing PET imaging for HCC detection[ 53 [18F] [18F] 54 [68Ga] 55 Radiomics Advanced radiomic models have improved non-invasive prediction of GPC3 expression in HCC. A multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging-based radiomic scoring model integrating tumor morphology and microvascular invasion achieved high predictive accuracy [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.979][ 56 57 Serum biomarker detection Technological advancements have significantly improved serum-based GPC3 detection. A sandwich-type ultrasensitive electrochemical aptamer sensor using both gold-polyaniline nanomaterials and graphene oxide-platinum palladium nanoparticles (PrGO-Hemin-PdNP) showed exceptional sensitivity for GPC3 detection, thus enhancing early HCC diagnosis[ 58 59 60 Circulating tumor cell detection Circulating tumor cell (CTC)-based technologies have advanced GPC3 detection in HCC. A dual fluorescence aptamer-based sensing system achieved 92% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with a detection limit of just 2 cells/mL[ 61 61 Together, these advancements demonstrate that GPC3 has been innovatively applied across molecular imaging, radiomics, serum detection and CTC analysis, significantly improving the sensitivity and accuracy of HCC diagnosis. These technologies provide novel, non-invasive tools for early detection and disease monitoring, reinforcing GPC3’s clinical potential as both a diagnostic and prognostic marker in liver cancer. TRANSLATIONAL PROGRESS OF GPC3-DIRECTED THERAPIES IN HCC Given its selective expression in HCC, various GPC3-targeting strategies have been developed, including monoclonal antibodies, ADCs, photodynamic therapy (PDT), DNA vaccines, and CAR-T-cell therapies (Figure 5 1 Figure 5  Applications of glypican-3-targeted therapies.

Beyond direct tumor cell killing, these cells also influence Wnt signaling, which is critical in HCC progression. However, challenges such as limited persistence and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment hinder their therapeutic efficacy. To address these limitations, researchers are actively refining GPC3-CAR-T cell design in order to enhance both their functionality and clinical potential. Patients in clinical trials NCT02905188 NCT02932956 68 NCT05103631 NCT04377932 68 Cytokine co-expression to boost CAR-T cell persistence A major limitation of CAR-T therapy in HCC is the absence of essential survival signals, such as IL-15 and IL-21, within the tumor microenvironment[ 69 70 71 72 Metabolic regulation for CAR-T enhancement Metabolic adaptation is critical for CAR-T cell persistence and function. Overexpression of GLUT1 or AGK enhanced glycolytic metabolism and anti-apoptotic capacity, improving GPC3-CAR-T cell persistence and cytotoxicity via 73 74 75 76 in vivo 76 Multi-target CAR-T therapies for enhanced efficacy One of the major obstacles in CAR-T therapy is antigen escape, which occurs due to antigen loss, shedding, or low expression, as well as limited T-cell homing and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments[ 77 78 A recent preclinical study developed GPC3-BiTE CAR-T cells, which not only express a GPC3-directed CAR but also secrete BiTE molecules targeting B7H3[ 79 79 To further enhance T-cell homing and infiltration, researchers engineered GPC3-CAR-T cells co-expressing IL-21 and CXCL9 in combination with PD-1 blockade, significantly improving tumor infiltration and tumor suppression in HCC xenograft models[ 80 80 80 via in vitro in vivo Allogeneic and novel T-cell therapies Conventional autologous CAR-T cell therapy faces challenges in manufacturing, T-cell homing, antigen heterogeneity, and tumor immune evasion. To overcome these limitations, researchers developed GPC3-CAR/sIL-15 Vδ1 T cells, leveraging the unique properties of Vδ1 γδ T cells, which exhibit MHC-independent cytotoxicity and a reduced risk of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)[ 81 In vitro 81 81 GPC3-targeted DNA vaccine for enhanced T-Cell response Beyond CAR-T cell therapy, a novel PLGA/PEI-HMGB1/GPC3 dual-target DNA vaccine was developed to enhance CD8+ T-cell responses and counteract immune suppression in HCC[ 82 HMGB1, an inflammatory mediator overexpressed in solid tumors, contributes to cancer progression and immune modulation[ 83 84 85 82 82 COMPARISON TO OTHER HCC THERAPIES AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES The treatment of advanced HCC has evolved from TKIs, such as sorafenib and lenvatinib, to ICIs, which have improved clinical outcomes to some extent[ 86 87 9 10 As a tumor-specific antigen highly expressed in HCC, GPC3 represents a promising therapeutic target with the potential to overcome current treatment limitations. Multiple clinical trials are evaluating GPC3-directed approaches, including CAR-T cell therapy, DNA vaccines, T-cell redirecting antibodies, and allogeneic strategies. Among these, CAR-T cell therapy has seen major advancements through cytokine modulation, metabolic reprogramming, dual-targeting strategies, and combination therapies with ICIs, significantly improving persistence, tumor infiltration and antitumor efficacy. Additionally, emerging modalities such as vaccines and multifunctional antibody therapies continue to expand the immunotherapy landscape, offering new opportunities for enhancing immune responses against HCC. Although there has been significant progress, further improvements are needed to boost effectiveness, overcome resistance, and better identify the right patients for treatment. Future research should focus on integrating GPC3-targeted therapies into personalized treatment plans, exploring combination approaches, and enhancing drug delivery to maximize effectiveness. HBV-related HCC progression involves the epigenetic silencing of tumor-suppressive miRNAs, such as let-7c, through HBx-induced EZH2 upregulation, leading to HMGA2-mediated metastasis[ 88 CONCLUSION With ongoing advancements in both CAR-T technology and clinical trials, GPC3-targeted therapies are poised to revolutionize HCC treatment, addressing key limitations within the existing therapies. By integrating innovative dual-targeting designs, metabolic enhancements, and immune checkpoint blockade, these therapies have the potential to overcome antigen escape, enhance T-cell function, and improve treatment durability. As research continues, GPC3-based immunotherapies may offer breakthrough solutions for HCC, bringing new hope for improved patient outcomes and long-term disease control.
