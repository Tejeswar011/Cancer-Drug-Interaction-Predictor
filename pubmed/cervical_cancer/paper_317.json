Emerging evidence suggests immune cell involvement in migraine, but the specific regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to identify immune cell-type-specific genetic drivers of migraine and prioritize potential therapeutic targets. Methods We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis integrating single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTL) data from 14 immune cell types with large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of migraine. Colocalization analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC), phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), and drug repurposing databases were utilized to validate findings and assess therapeutic potential and safety. Results We identified 25 immune cell-specific eGenes causally associated with migraine, including CDC42 NELFCD HOXB3 HAX1 FHL3 CDC42 HAX1 GINM1 TMA7 NELFCD CDC42 Conclusion This study reveals immune cell-specific genetic contributors to migraine and highlights druggable targets for therapeutic development. Integrating sc-eQTL with multi-omics and pharmacological data provides a novel framework for precision medicine in migraine.

Evidence points to the involvement of immune cells such as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells (NK), along with cytokines and chemokines that may contribute to neuroinflammation during migraine attacks [ 8 10 8 11 12 Human genetics offers a powerful tool for validating drug targets and improving the success rates of clinical drug development. Genetic evidence supporting a drug target has been shown to significantly increase the likelihood of approval in clinical trials. In the context of migraine, large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 40 common DNA sequence variants that affect risk for migraine types, providing critical insights into its polygenic architecture [ 13 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 23 In this study, we performed a sc-eQTL-based MR analysis to systematically explore the causal effects of immune cell-specific gene expression on migraine. We further integrated colocalization analysis, protein interaction networks, phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), and drug enrichment prediction to prioritize therapeutic targets. This comprehensive approach aims to reveal immune-mediated mechanisms underlying migraine and identify safe, genetically supported, and targetable candidates for drug development. Materials and methods Study design and ethics Overview of the study design and analysis pipeline were outlined in Fig. 1 24 22  Fig. 1 Overview of the study design and analysis pipeline. A B C Exposure data and instrument selection To define genetic instruments for immune cell-specific gene expression, we utilized cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) derived from the OneK1K sc-eQTL dataset [ 22 P −8 25 26 2 27 F F 28 Outcome data Migraine-associated genetic summary statistics were obtained from the FinnGen consortium (R12), a large-scale public-private partnership that integrates genotype data from Finnish biobanks with comprehensive national health registry data ( https://www.finngen.fi/en 29 14 1  Table 1 Summary of migraine GWAS datasets used in this study Phenotype Ancestry nCase nControl Source Migraine European 55,116 445,232 FinnGen Migraine European 48,975 540,381 Hautakangas et al.

Specifically, we leveraged results from prior LDSC-based genome-wide genetic correlation analyses conducted separately using the FinnGen and Hautakangas et al. migraine GWAS datasets. Traits that demonstrated statistically significant and directionally consistent correlations in both datasets were retained, yielding a consensus panel of migraine-related phenotypes. From this set, we selected a refined panel of migraine-related traits based on two criteria: (1) strong and concordant genetic correlation across both datasets, and (2) biological or clinical relevance to migraine pathophysiology, as supported by existing literature. The selected traits represent major domains frequently comorbid with migraine, including chronic pain conditions, psychiatric symptoms, cardiovascular traits, gastrointestinal disorders, and sensory disturbances. Subsequently, we performed MR analyses to evaluate the causal effects of the 25 prioritized eGenes on these selected traits. The full list of GWAS summary statistics used in this analysis is provided in Supplementary Table S7. Instrument selection and harmonization followed the same procedures described in earlier sections. Each gene was tested individually against each trait using appropriate MR methods based on the number of available instruments. Standardized effect sizes were calculated and visualized in a heatmap matrix to identify shared or trait-specific pleiotropic effects. Initial phenome-wide screen of migraine-associated eGene pleiotropy using PheWAS To preliminarily evaluate the pleiotropic effects and potential safety profiles of migraine-associated eGenes, we conducted PheWAS using the AstraZeneca PheWAS Portal ( https://azphewas.com/ 34 36 P −8 P −6 −8 Integrative phenotypic annotation and safety profiling of migraine-associated eGenes Building upon the initial screening, we conducted a comprehensive integrative annotation of prioritized migraine-associated eGenes to further refine the evaluation of phenotypic pleiotropy and clinical safety. We queried each candidate gene across the following databases: (1) GWAS Catalog (2023): To identify previously reported trait associations; (2) UKB GWAS (v1): To cross-check broader phenotype links in population-scale data; (3) ClinVar (2019): To determine whether pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were reported; (4) PhenGenI (2021): To integrate functional evidence from dbGaP, OMIM, eQTL, and SNP databases. Queries and enrichment analyses were performed using the Enrichr platform ( https://maayanlab.cloud/modEnrichr/ 37 Drug repurposing for migraine-associated eGenes To explore potential repurposing opportunities, we integrated our eGenes with evidence from OpenTargets [ 38 39 40 41 Results Summary of instrument selection for immune-cell specific eGenes To construct robust genetic instruments for MR analysis, we began with 26,597 cis-eGenes identified across 14 immune cell types from the OneK1K sc-eQTL dataset. LD clumping was performed using a stringent threshold (r 2 2 n 2  Fig. 2 Summary of instrument selection for immune-cell-specific gene expressions.

The resulting network visualizes both known and predicted interactions among candidate proteins, integrating evidence from curated databases, experimental studies, and computational prediction methods such as gene co-occurrence, co-expression, and text mining (Fig. 4 H1F0 RPS26 HOXB3 H3C12 H3C12 RPS26 SLC2A4RG BTN3A1 CDC42 NELFCD HAX1 Prioritizing eGenes in colocalization analysis To refine candidate genes with potential causal roles in migraine, we conducted Bayesian colocalization analyses to assess whether gene expression and migraine share a common causal variant. eGenes with PP.H4 > 0.7 were considered strong evidence and PP.H4 between 0.5 and 0.7 considered moderate support (Supplementary Table S3). A total of 15 eGenes passed the strong colocalization threshold (PP.H4 > 0.7), while several others showed moderate support (Fig. 4 NELFCD HAX1 HOXB3 KLF7 CDC42 Analysis of prioritized eGenes in migraine subtypes To further dissect the subtype-specific genetic mechanisms underlying migraine, we performed separate MR analyses for MA and MO (Supplementary Fig. S1). For MA, several eGenes showed nominally significant associations.

Several eGenes identified in the FinnGen dataset demonstrated consistent effect directions and nominal significance ( P GINM1 CDC42 NELFCD TMA7 P NELFCD H1F0 HOXB3 Genetic correlates of migraine across human phenotypes Using LDSC regression, we assessed genome-wide genetic correlations between migraine and 2,871 complex traits. In the FinnGen dataset, 357 traits showed significant correlations after Bonferroni correction, notably chronic pain (e.g., cervicalgia, rg = 0.44), psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, rg = 0.36), and sleep disturbances (Fig. 5  Fig. 5 Genetic correlations between migraine and 2,871 phenotypes across the FinnGen migraine GWAS dataset. Each dot represents one phenotype categorized by domain. Only significantly correlated traits are colored, while non-significant ones are shown in gray. Notably, migraine was positively correlated with pain conditions (e.g., back pain), psychiatric traits (e.g., anxiety), and several cardiometabolic phenotypes Trait-specific pleiotropic effects of migraine-associated eGenes From the 211 traits that showed statistically significant and directionally consistent correlations with migraine in both datasets, we selected a refined panel of 27 migraine-related traits (Supplementary Table S7). MR analyses revealed multiple significant causal associations between migraine-associated eGenes and 27 migraine-related traits (Fig. 6 HAX1 TMA7 HOXB-AS1 GINM1 NELFCD HOXB3 FHL3 SLC2A4RG ASL CDC42 MAD1L1 NELFCD HOXB3 TMA7  Fig. 6 Causal effects of migraine-associated eGenes on migraine-related traits.

Notably, CDC42 CDC42 44 45 CDC42 CDC42 46 NELFCD NELFCD 47 48 NELFCD FHL3 49 FHL3 HOXB3 HAX1 HOXB3 50 51 HAX1 52 HAX1 Subtype analysis of MA and MO further supports a nuanced role for immune regulation. While many genes were shared across both subtypes, their activity appeared to be more concentrated in specific immune cell types for each phenotype. For instance, TMA7 TPGS2 HAX1 FHL3 Our finding that several immune cell-specific eGenes, such as NELFCD HOXB3 GINM1 53 54 NELFCD FHL3 HAX1 TMA7 TMA7 MAD1L1 CDC42 FHL3 MEF2BNB CDC42 MAD1L1 55 56 The integration of genetically supported eGenes with existing pharmacological databases highlights several promising avenues for drug repurposing in migraine. Notably, multiple identified targets, such as CDC42 NELFCD ASL NELFCD 57 NELFCD CDC42 58 CDC42 NELFCD 59 FHL3 NUTF2 60 Unlike previous migraine genetic studies that largely relied on bulk tissue eQTL analyses from brain or whole blood, this study is the first to systematically integrate sc-eQTL data with MR to explore cell-type-specific causal mechanisms in migraine. By resolving gene expression regulation at the level of distinct immune cell types, our approach overcomes the limitations of tissue-averaged analyses and enables more precise identification of functionally relevant and druggable targets. Previous studies have been unable to pinpoint which immune lineages contribute to migraine susceptibility, thus limiting progress in immune-targeted therapies [ 17 18 61 62 This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, our analyses were based on GWAS datasets predominantly derived from individuals of European ancestry, which may limit the generalizability of our findings across diverse populations. Future studies in more ancestrally diverse cohorts are essential to validate the identified targets globally. Second, we used summary-level genetic data, which precludes fine-grained analyses such as sex- or age-specific effects, gene-gene interactions, and temporal dynamics of gene expression. Third, while we incorporated multiple layers of publicly available functional data, including sc-eQTL, PheWAS, and drug-gene interaction datasets, the lack of experimental validation limits causal inference and translational conclusions. Fourth, while PheWAS is a valuable tool for assessing pleiotropy and preliminary safety, we explicitly acknowledge that PheWAS alone is insufficient for comprehensive safety evaluation. Electronic health record-based datasets often underrepresent rare diseases, subclinical phenotypes, drug response traits, and nuanced neurological or immune conditions. Furthermore, most PheWAS resources prioritize European ancestry and may lack clinical granularity. Expanded or complementary phenotypic resources may reveal additional off-target associations not captured in our initial analysis. Therefore, the absence of strong associations in our PheWAS results should be interpreted cautiously and not as definitive evidence of target safety. Future work may incorporate computational pleiotropy prediction tools such as PleioPred to further quantify gene-level trait sharing and refine target specificity. Fifth, while our drug repurposing analysis integrated multiple curated resources including Open Targets, DrugBank, DGIdb, and DSigDB, we acknowledge that quantitative prioritization using Open Targets genetic evidence scores was not performed in the current version. Future efforts may formally incorporate these scores to enhance the objectivity of target selection and ensure stronger alignment with genetic evidence for migraine. Finally, the sc-eQTL data used in this study were derived from peripheral immune cells, which may not fully capture gene regulation in the central nervous system or neurovascular interface, regions critically relevant to migraine pathophysiology. Despite these limitations, our findings provide a biologically informed framework for prioritizing immune-mediated targets in migraine and lay the groundwork for future functional and translational research. Conclusion This study provides the first systematic integration of sc-eQTL data with MR to uncover immune cell-type-specific genetic drivers of migraine.
