Patient navigation, developed in the 1990s to address disparities in cancer outcomes, aims to guide patients through the complex healthcare system and improve access to timely, quality care. Despite its proven benefits, little is known about the implementation or impact of patient navigation programmes in African settings. This scoping review aims to map the current evidence on components, procedures, outcomes and impact, as well as barriers and challenges to implementation of patient navigation programmes in cancer care across Africa. Methods and analysis This scoping review will follow Arksey and O’Malley’s scoping review framework, as further developed by Levac et al Ethics and dissemination This scoping review does not require ethical approval. Our findings will be published in a peer-reviewed, open-access journal on completion.

The developed search strategy covers multiple databases, including an Africa-specific source (African Journals Online), which will improve the comprehensiveness of the scoping review and reduce the chances of omitting important or relevant literature. This review will only include papers published in the English language, potentially excluding relevant papers published in other languages. Limiting the studies included to only those carried out in Africa may reduce the generalisability of our study, as there may be significant variations in patient navigation programmes across other continents. Introduction Cancer is a major global public health burden and a leading cause of death worldwide. 1 2 3 Over the years, a number of barriers to accessing cancer care have been identified in Africa. These challenges range from patient factors such as poor health-seeking behaviour, sociocultural influences and poverty to systemic factors like physician shortage, lack of adequate treatment facilities and poor screening programmes. 4 5 6 Once a diagnosis of cancer has been established, patients are often faced with the challenge of navigating an existing complex healthcare system to access care. The patient navigation framework was first introduced by Harold Freeman in the 1990s as a way of reducing the barriers patients faced when it came to cancer screening and treatment. 7 8 9 10 Patient navigation has demonstrated significant benefits across the cancer care continuum, including improving screening rates, early diagnosis, cancer therapy completion rates, follow-ups and treatment costs. 9 11 12 This scoping review seeks to fill this knowledge gap by mapping the current evidence on the components, procedures, outcomes and impact, as well as barriers and challenges to implementation of patient navigation programmes in cancer care across the continent. Methods and analysis This scoping review will use the methodological framework established by Arksey and O'Malley, 13 et al 14 15 Research questions This scoping review seeks to answer the following questions. What are the characteristics and core components of patient navigation programmes implemented in cancer care in Africa? What is the impact of patient navigation programmes on cancer care outcomes in Africa, such as early diagnosis, treatment adherence and survival rates? What are the experiences and perceptions of patients, healthcare providers and policymakers regarding patient navigation programmes in cancer care? What are the differences in patient navigation programme implementation across various African countries or regions? How do patient navigation programmes address barriers to cancer care (eg, financial, geographic, cultural) in African settings? What challenges are faced in implementing and sustaining patient navigation programmes in cancer care in Africa? Identifying relevant studies A comprehensive literature review will be undertaken using three key databases: PubMed, African Journals Online and Google Scholar, searched from database inception to the date of the final search. These databases were selected due to their extensive representation of healthcare and medical literature, especially concerning African healthcare issues. The search methodology for each database has been developed with the assistance of a senior librarian with experience in database inquiries. This methodology includes a curated array of keywords and medical subject headings that correspond to the research questions posed. The search strategy for PubMed is detailed in Box 1 Box 1 Scoping review search strategy (PubMed) (“Neoplasms”[Mesh] OR cancer[tiab] OR cancers[tiab] OR “cancer patients”[tiab] OR “oncology patients”[tiab] OR “cancer survivors”[tiab]) AND (“Patient Navigation”[Mesh] OR “patient navigation”[tiab] OR “navigator programs”[tiab] OR “patient navigator”[tiab] OR “patient navigators”[tiab] OR “healthcare navigation”[tiab] OR “health system navigation”[tiab] OR “patient support programs”[tiab] OR “care coordination”[tiab]) Study selection The process of study selection is essential for maintaining the reliability and validity of this scoping review. We will implement a two-step screening procedure aimed at minimising bias and improving the transparency of our selection methodology. Screening will be conducted using Rayyan, a web-based systematic review management tool which facilitates blinded, independent screening by multiple reviewers to enhance transparency. Stage 1: Screening of titles and abstracts In the initial phase of study selection, two independent reviewers will carefully assess the titles and abstracts of all identified studies based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These criteria serve as a robust framework for evaluating the relevance of each study to our research inquiries. Stage 2: Full-text screening After the initial screening of titles and abstracts, studies that fulfil the inclusion criteria will advance to the second stage of evaluation. In this phase, the complete texts of the selected studies will be obtained and assessed by the same two reviewers. Each reviewer will independently analyse the content of every study during the comprehensive text evaluation to determine its relevance to our research questions and inclusion criteria. Should any disagreements or uncertainties arise, a discussion will be conducted to achieve a consensus. If a consensus cannot be achieved, a third author will be consulted to render the final decision. Inclusion criteria The studies eligible for inclusion must satisfy the following conditions: They must be conducted within an African country. They must focus on patients diagnosed with cancer or navigating the cancer care continuum in Africa. They must reference the description, assessment or implementation of patient navigation programmes specifically related to cancer care. Exclusion criteria Studies that do not pertain to patient navigation programmes. Studies that exclusively address healthcare providers or non-patient groups without a connection to patient navigation systems. Studies performed outside the African continent. Publications not in English. Systematic reviews, scoping reviews, correspondence and case reports. Charting the data The data collected will be documented in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Extracted information will include details about the authors, the type of study conducted, the year of publication, the country of implementation, the sample size, the various patient navigation programmes, their characteristics, as well as their impact, effectiveness and the barriers and limitations associated with these programmes. A copy of the proposed data extraction sheet is provided as an online supplemental appendix Summarising the data A qualitative content analysis approach will be used to synthesise and integrate the findings. Data will be organised according to the research questions and coded into themes relating to programme characteristics, outcomes, barriers and contextual factors. Two reviewers will independently perform data coding, and discrepancies will be resolved by a third reviewer. Microsoft Excel will be used to manage data extraction and NVivo software will be employed to support coding and theme development. Findings will be presented narratively and visually (tables and figures) to highlight key patterns. Where feasible, a comparative analysis of studies will also be undertaken to compare findings across different African countries and regions, thereby providing insight into contextual variations in the design and implementation of patient navigation programmes. Patient and public involvement None. Ethics and dissemination This scoping review will analyse publicly available published literature; thus, no ethical approval is required. The results of this review will be published in a peer-reviewed, open-access journal on completion.
