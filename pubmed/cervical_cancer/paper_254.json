Previous research indicates factors like age, profession, and technology use influence RAS perceptions. This study investigates public knowledge, preferences, and misconceptions about RAS within a German cohort. Methods A cross-sectional survey at a university hospital’s open house gathered responses from 339 participants prior to an RAS exhibition. The questionnaire assessed demographics, surgical preferences, and RAS knowledge. Statistical analyses, including t Results A total of 71% (234) of participants favored RAS over conventional surgery, yet misconceptions persisted in 38% (122), particularly among pensioners (48% (46), p p p Conclusion This local study reveals strong public support for RAS but underscores prevalent misconceptions, especially among older adults, suggesting that addressing misconceptions could foster acceptance and informed decision-making.

In the USA, 56% of female patients undergoing pelvic surgery have never heard of RAS and only 6% prefer robotic over conventional surgery, with those preferring RAS being unaware of its advantages [ 13 14 13 15 16 16 17 This study aims to further investigate the knowledge among the public by exploring attitudes, preferences, and misconceptions surrounding RAS within the German population, where RAS implementation is on a profound international level [ 16 18 Methods In this single-center descriptive study, paper-based questionnaires were handed out to visitors of an open house event of the urologic department of a German university hospital. Open house was embedded in a city-wide event propagating science to the general public. Participants were handed out questionnaires before entering an exhibition on RAS to test their preexisting knowledge. The study was conducted in ethic compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. An ethics approval was not required due to local law as no personal data were processed. Patients were informed about the usage of data for scientific analyses (see online suppl. mat. 2; for all online suppl. material, see https://doi.org/10.1159/000544773 16 The first section of the questionnaire covered biographic questions on age, gender, profession, and daily usage of computer technologies. The second section contained 8 questions on knowledge, preference, and beliefs on RAS. Preference for robotic or conventional surgery was asked directly. Convictions were determined asking for advantages and disadvantages of RAS. Knowledge was tested by presenting false answers among correct ones (e.g., robotic assistance means the robot is programmed and performs the surgery). Items were mostly single-choice questions. Answers to multiple choice questions were transformed into dummy variables for analysis. A variable “Misconception of robotic surgery” was created to identify participants who demonstrated a misunderstanding of robotic surgery. Participants were coded as misconceiving if they thought robots were programmed and performed the surgery by themselves, robots operated automatically, and the surgeon is present for security reasons only or robotic surgery was mostly used for conventional open surgery or “Laser-surgery,” if they feared the robot would perform a wrong surgery, or if they believed “R2D2” and “Uronaut” to be robotic systems applied in urology. Participants were coded as misconceiving if one of these conditions applied and excluded as missing value if any of the relevant variables contained missing values.  t 19 Results A total of 339 participants filled out questionnaires in this first German single-center study on robotic knowledge among the public differentiating their beliefs, preferences, and knowledge toward RAS.

This is followed by fears of machine malfunction in 132 (39%) participants. The implausible fear of the wrong surgery being performed is apparent in 51 (15%) participants. Older individuals tend to be more concerned about machine dysfunction, while younger individuals fear human error more (see Fig. 2 p ANOVA p ANOVA p Fig. 2. Age by categories of fear.

Discussion For the first time, this study shows knowledge, convictions and fears of the German public on RAS, allowing for a more individualized patient information ahead of surgery. In contrast to previous findings in the Middle East [ 16 13 16 p 20 Interestingly, older patients, in which previous data described a higher prevalence of fear of malfunction [ 16 p 16 p In line with the previous study, misconceptions in our cohort are strongly associated with preference for conventional surgery (without misconceptions: 81% preference for RAS, with misconception 57% preference for RAS, p 15 Misconceptions are most prevalent among pensioners (48% (46) of pensioners vs. 38% (122) of all, p p p As well as for surgical preference, misconceptions were unevenly distributed among professions ( p p p p Previous findings of patients fearing increased risk [ 15 17 4 8 21 Limitations Even without a power analysis, this study clearly does not reach representation of the general population, as geographic representation is not fulfilled, a bias by scientifically interested individuals and possibly study degree may apply and no explicit sampling was applied. Distribution among professions also shows an overrepresentation of health care professionals (27% in our cohort vs. 18% in Germany [ 20 Inclusion of participants aged <18 produces a wholesome but flawed image of public perception of RAS. However, results were backed by additional analyses within more concise age cohorts if relevant. The unvalidated questionnaire used in this study was self-composed. In lack of validated questionnaires, comparability was attempted to be achieved by leaning on questions used in previous studies [ 15 17 Conclusion Our limited, local study in 339 participants shows a higher preference for RAS than previous studies but reaffirms the need of patient education addressing misconceptions surrounding RAS, particularly among pensioners. Meanwhile younger, tech-savy patients mostly fear lack of surgeon skill, showing a high confidence in technology. Bridging these gaps in knowledge and fears may help shift preferences further toward RAS, ultimately fostering wider acceptance and more differentiated understanding of its advantages. However, the generalizability of findings remains limited and deeper insight about the general population requires a sample with more representative characteristics, unaffected by regional variations and potential biases. Statement of Ethics Ethical approval was not required for this study in accordance with local/national guidelines. The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Consent to participate in the survey anonymously was precondition to visiting the exhibition on RAS. Patients were informed about the usage of data for scientific analyses and gave implied informed consent by participation (see online suppl. mat. 2). Written consent was not required by local law as no identifying data was processed. Conflict of Interest Statement The authors declare to have no conflicts of interest.
