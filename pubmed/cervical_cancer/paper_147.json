Methods The retrospective cohort study of fourteen patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma exhibiting cervical oesophageal involvement were included in the study from January 2012 to January 2021. Postoperative radiochemotherapy was utilised, and follow-up occurred for 3–5 years. The Kaplan–Meier method was used for survival analysis. Results All of the patients demonstrated healing without events, except for one patient who experienced a pharyngocutaneous fistula, which also healed after approximately 2 weeks of dressing changes. With a follow-up of 3–5 years, the median duration of follow-up was 49 months (range = 36–60 months). Eight patients died during follow-up. Moreover, three patients had metastases in the neck, 1 patient had metastases in the lung, and 1 patient discontinued further treatment because of thoracic oesophageal carcinoma with hepatic metastasis. The 5-year overall survival was 42.9%. Among the 14 included patients, two patients developed pharyngoesophageal stenosis, and the remaining patients recovered well. Two patients with pharyngoesophageal stenosis causing feeding difficulties received nasogastric tube nasal feeding and urinary catheter dilation after the scar tissue was removed via coblator plasma surgery at the stenosis and were fed via nasogastric tube for 1–3 months. Conclusion As an effective repair method, laryngotracheal flaps have broad application prospects in the repair of the cervical oesophagus after the resection of hypopharyngeal carcinoma with cervical oesophageal involvement. Coblator plasma surgery and catheter dilation may effectively address the problem of eating difficulties in patients with postoperative pharyngoesophageal stenosis.

The reasons for this poor prognosis include late presentations, submucosal spreading and early lymphatic/distant metastasis [ 1 2 3 4 7 Materials and methods A single-center, retrospective cohort study was performed. The participants in this report signed informed consent; moreover, they voluntarily participated in the study and had the right to withdraw at any stage. The study was approved by the Human Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine at Zhe Jiang University (Zhejiang, China) (Approval No. 157). All of the procedures were performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Clinical samples and data collection The inclusion criteria for the patients were as follows: patients with advanced hypopharyngeal cancer involving the cervical oesophagus with an invasion length of no more than 3 cm and with laryngeal function that could not be preserved; elderly or frail patients with compromised cardiopulmonary function or those who were unable to tolerate prolonged surgical procedures exceeding 3 h; or patients at high risk of aspiration following the preservation of laryngeal function. The exclusion criteria included patients with advanced hypopharyngeal cancer involving the cervical oesophagus with an invasion length exceeding 3 cm or those for whom laryngeal function could be preserved using alternative methods. The clinical data of 14 patients with postoperative defects for whom laryngotracheal flaps were used to reconstruct the cervical oesophagus from January 2012 to January 2021, as well as the management strategies for two patients with complicated laryngopharyngeal stenosis, were analysed. After resection of the laryngeal, pharyngeal and oesophageal tumours and bilateral neck dissection, direct anastomosis of the larynx and trachea with the oesophagus of the cervicothoracic segment was performed when the circular structure of the larynx and trachea could be preserved. Postoperative radiochemotherapy was utilised, and the follow-up occurred for 3–5 years. Surgery The trachea was incised at the fourth tracheal ring. After the resection of the piriform fossa and the affected side, the retained cartilage stent of the healthy side was removed as much as possible, and a flexible broad laryngeal mucosal flap or laryngeal tracheal mucosal flap was produced, which could be directly repaired with the residual hypopharyngeal and oesophageal mucosa. One side of the laryngeal structure was preserved, whereas the cricoid cartilage was excised, and the posterior portion was sutured to the prevertebral fascia. The tracheal stump was subsequently anastomosed with the oesophagus to reconstruct the degree of oesophageal continuity. A permanent tracheostomy was performed at the upper end of the trachea (Figs. 1 2 Fig. 1 The creation of the laryngotracheal flap Fig. 2 The use of a laryngotracheal flap to reconstruct the cervical oesophagus after the resection of hypopharyngeal carcinoma with cervical oesophageal involvement Statistical analysis Overall survival was calculated by the Kaplan–Meier method based on the time interval between the last day of treatment and the date of death or the most recent follow-up. Results The clinical data of 14 patients with postoperative defects resulting from the use of laryngotracheal flaps to reconstruct the cervical oesophagus from 2012–2021, as well as the management strategies for two patients with complicated laryngopharyngeal stenosis, were analysed (Table 1 Table 1 Demographic characteristics of patients ( N Number Age(year) Gender Smoking Alcohol use PS and CE were involved < 60 > 60 Male Female Ever Never Ever Never Unilateral Other 14 5 9 14 0 10 4 9 5 9 5 PS CE All of the patients exhibited healing without events, except for one patient who experienced a pharyngocutaneous fistula, which also healed after approximately 2 weeks of dressing changes. All of the patients demonstrated a good swallowing reflex (based on a video of X-ray inspection and oesophageal barium meal radiography); moreover, they were fed a normal diet free of feeding tubes and demonstrated no gastric reflux. The median radiation dose for postoperative radiotherapy was 60 Gy. Postoperative chemotherapy (involving cisplatin (80 mg/m 2 2 Survival The median duration of follow-up was 49 months (range = 36–60 months). Eight patients died during follow-up. Moreover, three patients had metastases in the neck, 1 patient had metastases in the lung, and 1 patient discontinued further treatment because of thoracic oesophageal carcinoma with hepatic metastasis. The 5-year overall survival was 42.9% (Fig. 3 4 5 6 Fig. 3 Overall survival of patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma invading the cervical oesophagus. The 5-year overall survival rate was 42.9% Fig. 4 Laryngoscopy and electrogastroscopy revealed pharyngoesophageal stenosis 14 months after surgery Fig. 5 Nasogastric tube and urinary catheter were placed to dilate pharyngoesophageal stenosis after the scar tissue was removed via coblator plasma surgery at the stenosis site Fig. 6 CT image of a patient fed a normal diet without the need for a feeding tube and without the occurrence of gastric reflux after urinary catheter expansion Discussion Many reconstructive methods, such as the use of a pectoralis major flap, a clavicular epithelial flap, free flap repair (e.g., a forearm free flap), and gastric pull-up, have been used in a variety of different situations when performing reconstruction of the hypopharynx to reconstruct the cervical oesophagus [ 4 7 Laryngotracheal flaps (LTFs) have been previously used to prevent defects of the cervical oesophagus in 1991[ 8 9 10 n n n n n n n 11 Pharyngocutaneous fistula and pharyngoesophageal stenosis represent the main postoperative complications of this procedure. Chu et al. reported that postoperative complications are rarely observed, with only 2% of patients experiencing pharyngoesophageal stenosis and 5% exhibiting pharyngocutaneous fistula [ 10 Pharyngoesophageal stenosis (PES) is among the most common complications following cervical oesophageal reconstruction by a laryngotracheal flap; additionally, it exhibits adverse effects on postoperative rehabilitation, adjuvant therapy, and overall survival. The postoperative management of pharyngoesophageal stenosis is one of the most challenging and controversial problems being experienced by head and neck surgeons. A number of different PES repair techniques have been described [ 12 14 This was a single-center retrospective analysis with a small sample size, which might have introduced bias in case selection. Therefore, it is essential to conduct large prospective studies in the future to validate the findings of this study. Conclusion As an effective repair method, the laryngotracheal flap has broad application prospects in the repair of the cervical oesophagus after the resection of hypopharyngeal carcinoma with cervical oesophageal involvement. Coblator plasma surgery and catheter dilation may effectively address the problem of eating difficulties in patients with postoperative pharyngoesophageal stenosis. However, given the limited number of evaluated cases, additional clinical validation is warranted.
