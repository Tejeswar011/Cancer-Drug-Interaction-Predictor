Introduction Gossypol is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound primarily derived from the seeds, roots, and stems of Gossypium hirsutum 1 2 3 4 3 In addition to its agricultural relevance, gossypol has garnered attention for its broad pharmacological activities, including antiviral, antioxidant, and antitumor effects. Clinically, it has been used to manage gynecological conditions such as uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and dysfunctional uterine bleeding [ 2 1 2 4 5 Despite its therapeutic potential, gossypol poses significant toxicological risks. It has been shown to suppress lymphocyte proliferation, impair macrophage function, and disrupt immune responses. Additionally, it exerts neurotoxic and hepatotoxic effects, and its acute exposure has been associated with mortality in animal models [ 3 5 6 6 Experimental animal studies have corroborated the reproductive toxicity of gossypol in females, demonstrating impaired folliculogenesis, reduced viable follicle counts, and increased follicular atresia, resulting in disrupted estrous cycles, embryogenesis, and pregnancy outcomes [ 7 8 9 10 11 Age is a critical factor influencing ovarian susceptibility to toxicants [ 12 13 14 To ensure a systematic and evidence-based risk evaluation, this study adopted the Targeted Risk Assessment of Environmental Chemicals (TRAEC) framework. The TRAEC framework integrates four key dimensions—reliability scores, risk intensity scores, correlation scores, and integrity scores—and stratifies health risks into three levels: low (0–4), moderate (4–8), and high (8–10) [ 15 16 17 The objectives of our study are to investigate the risk of gossypol exposure on ovarian function, the differences in its effects between the reproductive and perimenopausal periods, the mechanisms underlying gossypol’s impact on ovarian function, and the reversibility of ovarian function recovery following gossypol exposure. We aim to provide experimental and theoretical foundations for the prevention and control of ovarian diseases associated with gossypol exposure. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Risk Assessment of Gossypol-Induced Ovarian Reserve Decline Based on the TRAEC Strategy In this study, the Targeted Risk Assessment of Environmental Chemicals (TRAEC) strategy was employed to systematically evaluate the potential risk of gossypol exposure on ovarian reserve function. This assessment was conducted in accordance with the TRAEC framework, which comprises the following sequential steps: (1) identification of the core scientific question; (2) integration of evidence derived from targeted literature searches and in-house data, encompassing epidemiological, in vivo, and in vitro studies; and (3) comprehensive evaluation of the compiled evidence across four key dimensions—study reliability (rigor of design and execution), exposure-outcome correlation (strength of association), risk intensity (alignment with the research hypothesis), and evidence integrity (completeness and consistency of evidence). These criteria were quantitatively scored to assess the overall strength of evidence and classify the level of risk associated with gossypol-induced ovarian dysfunction. 2.2. Literature Retrieval and Screening A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases, covering all publications available up to 1 April 2025. The search strategy utilized the following keywords: “gossypol” AND (“ovary” OR “oocyte” OR “granulosa cell” OR “luteal cell”). Inclusion criteria covered in vivo, in vitro, cohort, or case–control studies reporting quantitative reproductive outcomes related to gossypol exposure. Studies lacking original data or relevant endpoints were excluded. Eligible studies were scored using the TRAEC framework. 2.3. Experimental Animals Female ICR mice aged 6 and 40 weeks ( n 2.4. Experimental Design Eighty female ICR mice were divided by age (6 and 40 weeks) and randomly assigned to control or gossypol groups ( n Mice were anesthetized with avertin (20 μL/g; Dalian Meilun Biotechnology, Dalian, China). Blood was collected via enucleation, and both ovaries were harvested. One ovary was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, sectioned (5 μm), and H&E-stained for histology. The other ovary and serum were stored at −80 °C for molecular analyses. 2.5. Follicle Counting H&E-stained serial ovarian sections were examined using a Nikon Ni-E microscope. Follicles were categorized as follows: primordial follicles—oocytes surrounded by a single layer of flattened granulosa cells; primary follicles—oocytes enclosed by a single layer of cuboidal granulosa cells; secondary follicles—two or more granulosa cell layers and zona pellucida; antral follicles—presence of an antral cavity and cumulus mass; and atretic follicles—degenerated oocyte, disrupted granulosa layers, or detachment. Every third section was analyzed; only follicles with visible nucleoli were counted to prevent duplication. 2.6. ELISA for Hormone Quantification Serum AMH and FSH levels were measured using ELISA kits (Jianglai Bio, Shanghai, China). Assays were performed per manufacturer instructions, including serial dilution, standard/sample addition to 96-well plates, incubation with HRP-conjugated antibodies, substrate reaction, and OD detection at 450 nm using a BioTek Synergy2 reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc., Winooski, VT, USA). Hormone concentrations were calculated from standard curves (R 2 2.7. Oocyte Culture and Maturation A 50 mM gossypol stock was prepared by dissolving 0.029 g of gossypol acetate in 1 mL of DMSO. Its working concentrations (0, 30, 60, and 120 μM) were made by adding 0, 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 μL of the stock solution to 1 mL of M16 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), pre-equilibrated at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 2.8. Immunofluorescence of Oocytes GV-stage oocytes were collected from five 6-week-old ICR mice and treated with 0, 30, 60, or 120 μM gossypol to assess cytoskeletal and mitochondrial alterations. Spindle assembly and Chromosome alignment: After 9 h of culture, oocytes were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde), permeabilized (0.5% Triton X-100), and blocked. Spindles were stained with anti-α-tubulin antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33,342 (KeyGen BioTECH, Nanjing, China). Images were captured using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope. Mitochondrial distribution: After 8 h, oocytes were incubated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 1 h, then fixed and imaged to assess mitochondrial localization. 2.9. KGN Cell Proliferation Assay (EdU) KGN cells (from Prof. Ran Huo, Nanjing Medical University) were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 10% FBS (NEWZERUM, Christchurch, New Zealand), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 A 40 μg/mL gossypol stock was prepared (0.002 g gossypol in 100 μL DMSO, diluted in 50 mL medium). Its working concentrations (0, 5, 10, and 20 μg/mL) were applied to cells in 24-well plates for 24 h. Proliferation was assessed using an EdU kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) following standard protocols: EdU incubation (2 h), fixation, permeabilization, click reaction, Hoechst 33,342 counterstaining (KeyGen BioTECH, Nanjing, China), and imaging on a Nikon Ti2-U microscope. EdU-positive nuclei were quantified to calculate proliferation rates. 2.10. KGN Cell Apoptosis Assay (TUNEL) TUNEL assays were performed under the same gossypol treatment concentrations and duration as the EdU assay. After 24-h treatment, apoptosis was detected using the TUNEL Cell Apoptosis Kit (Beyotime, China). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with PBS, incubated with TUNEL reaction mix, and imaged via fluorescence microscopy. The proportion of TUNEL-positive cells was used as an index of apoptosis. 2.11. Proteomic Analysis of Ovarian Tissue Ovaries from three control and three gossypol-treated 6-week-old mice were analyzed by data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry (Majorbio Bio-Pharm, Shanghai, China). Total proteins were extracted and trypsin-digested, and the obtained peptides were analyzed using LC-MS/MS with an Astral high-resolution mass spectrometer (400–1200 m z p 2.12. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 10.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) and presented as the mean ± SD. Student’s t p 3. Results 3.1. Identification of the Scientific Question: Does Gossypol Exposure Affect Ovarian Reserve Function? Gossypol has recently gained attention for its potent antitumor properties, making it a promising candidate for cancer therapy. Initially developed as a male contraceptive, its clinical use was discontinued due to concerns about irreversible infertility. However, data on its reproductive toxicity in female germ cells remain scarce. Thus, this study aims to address the following critical question: does gossypol exposure impair ovarian reserve function in females? 3.2. Evidence Collection and Integration 3.2.1. Literature Search and Screening Following a predefined strategy, 250 articles related to gossypol exposure and ovarian function were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI. After removing 63 duplicates, 187 articles were screened based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full-text review led to the exclusion of 10 additional articles due to insufficient data or methodological flaws. Ultimately, 36 studies were included in the TRAEC-based systematic risk assessment ( Figure 1 3.2.2. Overview of Included Studies Key characteristics of the 36 included studies are summarized in Table 1 Table 2 Although gossypol has been studied for gynecological conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, and abnormal bleeding [ 7 3.2.3. Summary of In Vivo Studies Seventeen in vivo studies were identified, utilizing various animal models including mice, rats, cows, ewes, hamsters, bats, and ducks. Specifically, six studies used rats; four used cows; two used mice; two used ewes; and one each used hamsters, bats, and ducks ( Table 1 3.2.4. Summary of In Vitro Studies A total of 21 in vitro studies were included, employing diverse cell and tissue types ( Table 2 n n n n 3.3. Gossypol Exposure Induces Decline in Ovarian Reserve Function To evaluate the effects of gossypol on ovarian reserve at different reproductive stages, female mice aged 6 weeks (young group) and 40 weeks (aged group) were orally administered gossypol daily for 30 days. Post-exposure, 6-week-old mice exhibited visible clinical symptoms, including sparse, coarse fur and hemorrhagic signs (petechiae and ecchymosis) on the tail, which were absent in controls ( Figure 2 Figure 2 p p Figure 2 Figure 2 p p p p p p p Figure 2 p 3.4. Effects of Gossypol on Mouse Oocytes and KGN Cells 3.4.1. Impairment of Oocyte Maturation Germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) and first polar body extrusion (PBE) rates were assessed after 4 and 14 h of in vitro culture, respectively ( Figure 3 p p p p 3.4.2. Disruption of Spindle Assembly and Mitochondrial Function After 9 h of culture, control oocytes exhibited barrel-shaped spindles with correct chromosome alignment ( Figure 3 p p Figure 3 3.4.3. Inhibition of KGN Cell Proliferation and Induction of Apoptosis EdU and TUNEL assays demonstrated that gossypol impairs proliferation and induces apoptosis in human granulosa-like tumor (KGN) cells. EdU incorporation decreased with increasing gossypol concentrations: 29.41 ± 7.42% at 5 μg/L ( p p Figure 3 p p p Figure 3 3.5. Integrated Risk Assessment of Gossypol Exposure on Ovarian Reserve Function Based on the TRAEC Strategy In this study, we applied a multi-evidence-based Targeted Risk Assessment of Environmental Chemicals (TRAEC) strategy to systematically evaluate the potential reproductive toxicity of gossypol on ovarian reserve function. The assessment focused on four core dimensions: reliability scores, risk intensity scores, correlation scores, and integrity scores. Each study was independently scored by two reviewers, with discrepancies resolved via discussion involving a third reviewer. This two-tiered review process enhances objectivity and scientific validity. Reliability was rated on a 1–10 scale ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 In summary, this integrative TRAEC analysis classifies gossypol exposure as a moderate reproductive risk, due to its significant evidence of ovarian reserve impairment. These findings underscore the need for cautious use of gossypol in clinical settings and warrant further targeted investigations. 3.6. Proteomic Analysis of Ovarian Tissue Following Gossypol Exposure To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying gossypol-induced ovarian dysfunction, we performed a comprehensive proteomic comparison between ovaries from 6-week-old female mice treated with gossypol and age-matched controls ( Figure 5 2 2 Figure 5 p Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Overall, proteomic profiling indicates that gossypol exposure induces extensive alterations in critical signaling pathways—steroidogenesis, immune regulation, mitochondrial metabolism, and cell adhesion—thereby impairing ovarian cellular function and depleting ovarian reserve capacity. 3.7. Assessment of Reversibility of Gossypol-Induced Ovarian Reserve Decline To evaluate the potential reversibility of gossypol-induced ovarian damage, subsets of 6-week-old and 40-week-old female mice underwent a 30-day recovery period following cessation of gossypol treatment. Throughout recovery, body weights in treated mice remained slightly lower than their age-matched controls (6 weeks: control 46.38 ± 2.39 g vs. gossypol 42.14 ± 0.83 g; 40 weeks: control 56.57 ± 1.37 g vs. gossypol 54.91 ± 1.64 g), with no further decline, suggesting systemic stabilization ( Figure 6 p Figure 6 p Figure 6 Figure 6 Within a one-month recovery period, gossypol-induced ovarian damage appears only partially reversible. Although ovarian structure and follicular composition showed modest improvement, endocrine and functional recovery was not significant. These results suggest that gossypol may exert lasting effects on ovarian reserve, and further research is needed to determine the extent and reversibility of its reproductive endocrine impact. 4. Discussion This study systematically evaluated the effects of gossypol exposure on ovarian reserve function and its reversibility in female mice, elucidating its potential reproductive toxicity and endocrine-disrupting effects. We quantitatively assessed the reproductive toxicity of gossypol utilizing the TRAEC strategy that integrates multiple lines of evidence from epidemiological, in vivo, and in vitro studies. Despite numerous studies reporting the reproductive effects of gossypol, results have been inconsistent [ 8 9 11 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 1 53 54 55 56 Our findings demonstrate that gossypol exposure significantly impairs ovarian function in female mice. Macroscopically, treated mice exhibited reduced body weight and smaller ovarian volume, suggesting inhibited overall growth and ovarian development. Previous studies support this observation, with Luz et al. (2018) reporting follicular atresia rates of 65–88% in rats, mice, and goats following seven days of gossypol treatment, and another study observing up to 79.4% atretic follicles in sheep [ 19 34 36 35 37 39 11 Previous studies have not reported on the effects of gossypol on ovarian function in different age groups. Our research findings indicate that gossypol exposure led to notable structural damage within the ovarian tissue and significantly depleted the follicular reserve in both young and aged mice. Notably, the ovarian damage was considerably more severe in the 6-week-old group, suggesting that ovaries during the reproductive age may be more susceptible to gossypol-induced toxicity. This highlights a critical high-risk window that warrants further investigation to better understand the underlying mechanisms, potentially leading to the development of preventive measures or targeted therapies to mitigate the adverse effects of gossypol on ovarian health. Advances in omics technologies have deepened our understanding of gossypol’s ovarian effects. Additionally, the development of omics technologies assists in elucidating the mechanisms of ovarian damage caused by gossypol. Metabolomic and redox proteomic studies in SKOV3 granulosa cells [ 56 35 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 34 36 We synthesized the existing literature on gossypol’s effects on female fertility and identified multiple mechanisms through which it impairs ovarian function. Gossypol disrupts oocyte development by impairing both nuclear and cytoplasmic processes—including spindle assembly and mitochondrial function [ 34 36 35 37 39 34 35 36 Historically, gossypol was evaluated as a male contraceptive [ 66 14 67 14 68 69 However, our study still has the following limitations: First, as this study was conducted using a murine model, its applicability to humans may be limited. Future studies should monitor fertility outcomes in women exposed to gossypol to evaluate both short- and long-term reproductive effects. Second, although proteomic analysis revealed multiple disrupted pathways, the interactions among these pathways and their specific molecular mechanisms require further investigation. Advanced approaches such as gene-knockout or overexpression models may help elucidate the roles of key regulatory molecules. Third, the recovery phase was limited to one month; extending this period could yield a more comprehensive understanding of the reversibility of gossypol-induced ovarian impairment. 5. Conclusions This study applied an innovative environmental chemical risk assessment framework (i.e., TRAEC) to evaluate the effects of gossypol exposure on ovarian reserve by integrating published evidence with novel experimental data. The results demonstrate that gossypol poses a moderate reproductive risk, as it reduces ovarian reserve in female mice, impairs oocyte maturation, and disrupts pathways involved in hormone production and antigen processing. In vitro assays further confirmed that gossypol inhibits granulosa cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. Although partial recovery was observed one month after exposure cessation, residual functional impairment and endocrine alterations persisted, indicating potentially irreversible reproductive effects. Future studies should focus on human-based investigations to clarify gossypol’s long-term impact on ovarian health and explore alternative compounds—such as dextrorotary (+) -gossypol—that may offer therapeutic benefits without compromising fertility [ 70 Acknowledgments We sincerely thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments on this manuscript.
