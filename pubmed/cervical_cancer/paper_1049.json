In a retrospective case series study, review of electronic medical records was conducted for 64 patients who underwent transoral laser MLS over an 18-month period. The collected data included vital parameters, mode of ventilation, ET tube details, surgical field of vision, perioperative adverse events and postoperative ventilation requirements. Among the 64 patients, 82.8% of the time, 5 size MLT tubes were used, fixed at mean lengths of 21.6cm in females and 23.07cm in males respectively. A good surgical field of exposure was achieved in 92.2% of patients, with an average FiO2 of 0.29 during laser use and pressure control ventilation mode being the majority choice. 98.4% were extubated on table. The incidence of cuff rupture and bronchospasm was 4.7% and 1.6% respectively with no instances attributable to laser related events. Even though Laser resistant tubes are considered gold standard, MLT tubes can be used by taking adequate precautions to reduce Laser related complications when there is limited availability of laser tubes.
