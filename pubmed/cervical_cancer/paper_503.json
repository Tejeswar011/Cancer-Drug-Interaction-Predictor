However, its potential effects on mammalian cellular behavior remain unclear. Here, we systematically profiled effects of stable Cas9 expression on growth of 32 cell lines spanning 9 cancer types and non-cancerous cells, finding growth alterations in a subset. To investigate mechanisms, we established the SpCas9 interactome in DU145 and MDA-MB-231 cells, both showing Cas9-enhanced growth, and identified ribosomal proteins as the top shared interactors. RNA-seq analysis revealed that Cas9 expression in DU145 cells activated PI3K signaling. Mechanistic studies showed that ribosomal proteins, including RPL26 and RPL23a, bind to Sin1, a core mTORC2 component, leading to mTORC2 activation. Notably, SpCas9 interacts with both RPL26/RPL23a and Sin1, acting as a scaffold to stabilize their association and enhance mTORC2 activation, even in the absence of growth factors. Our study systematically characterizes Cas9’s effects on cell growth regulation and uncovers a novel Cas9-ribosome-mTORC2 signaling axis that promotes cell growth. These findings underscore the need to consider unintended cellular effects in CRISPR applications and highlight the importance of engineering safer Cas9 variants for biomedical research and clinical therapies.

Notably, human T cells recognizing bacterial Cas9 proteins have been identified [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 CRISPR-based tools, including CRISPR, CRISPRi, CRISPRa, and base editing, rely on bacterial Cas9 protein expression and activity. However, its impact on mammalian cellular responses and behavior remains unclear. Understanding these effects is essential for ensuring CRISPR’s safe application in humans and maintaining the accuracy of CRISPR-based assays, such as genetic screens, in biomedical research. Beyond Cas9, other CRISPR-associated proteins, including Cas12a [ 23 24 25 26 Materials and methods Cell culture and transfection Human renal cell carcinoma cell lines 786-O, A498, RCC4, ACHN, HKC-8, UMRC2, and UMRC6, human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7, and T47D; human colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and DLD1; human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP, DU145, PC3, and 22Rv1, human pancreatic cancer cell lines AsPC-1, HuP-T3, and MIA PaCa-2, human lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299, human Ewing sarcoma cell lines A673 and MHH-ES-1, human glioma cell lines T98G and U87MG, and human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, human immortalized kidney cell lines HEK293 and HEK293T, benign human prostate cell line BPH1, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), and mouse embryo 10T1/2 cells were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum), 100 units of penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cell transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 3000 or polyethylenimine (PEI) as previously described [ 27 28 29 30 Plasmids Cas9-Flag (plenti-CRISPR-V2) was purchased from Addgene (plasmid #52961). To generate a Cas9-negative control plasmid, the coding sequence of Cas9 was removed from the lenti-CRISPR-V2 backbone. Briefly, the Cas9 open reading frame was excised by restriction enzyme digestion using NheI and BamHI, and the resulting fragment was replaced with a short stuffer sequence containing a stop codon to maintain plasmid integrity. sgEMX-1 construct was as reported previously [ 29 31 CMV-GST-RPL23A-BamHI-F: GCATGGATCCGCGCCGAAAGCGAAG CMV-GST-RPL23A-SalI-R: GACTGTCGACTTAGATGATCCCAATTTTGTTGGC CMV-GST-RPL26-BamHI-F: GCATGGATCCAAGTTTAATCCCTTTGTGACTTC CMV-GST-RPL26-SalI-R: GACTGTCGACTTATTCCTGCATCTTCTCAATGG Sin1-N (aa 1–137), Sin1-CRIM (aa 138–266), Sin1-RBD (aa 267–376), and Sin1-PH (aa 377–522) plasmids were constructed according to a previous study [ 31 sgRNAs targeting human RPL26 or RPL23a are designed as below and cloned into pLenti-CRISPR-V2 vector.

The protein concentrations of the whole cell lysates were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay and measured with a NanoDrop OneC. Equal amounts of whole cell lysates were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subjected to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitation (IP) analyses, unless otherwise specified, 1 mg of lysate was incubated with agarose beads coupled to antibodies specific for the tag for 3-4 h at 4°C. For endogenous IPs, the incubation of cell lysates with antibodies was extended overnight, followed by another 1 h with Protein A/G XPure agarose resins. The immuno-complexes were washed four times with NETN buffer [20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.5% NP-40] before being resolved by SDS–PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Notably, all uncropped, unprocessed western blotting images are included in Supplementary Fig. S5 T7E1 gene editing assays EMX-1 sgRNA was transfected into the indicated DU145 or MDA-MB-231 cells. Three days post-transfection with the indicated DNA constructs, cells were harvested, and genomic DNA was extracted using QuickExtract™ DNA Extraction Solution (Biosearch Technology SS000035-D2) according to manufacturer’s instructions. End-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using 10 μl of genomic DNA as the template, with the indicated primers and high-fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (M7122, Promega). PCR products were verified by DNA electrophoresis in 1× TAE buffer and purified using PCR cleanup kits (BS664, Bio Basic, Inc.). PCR products from control or Cas9-expressing cells (600–800 ng) were mixed, denatured, and annealed to generate small indels in the hybridized products. One microliter of T7 Endonuclease I (NEB M0689) was added, and the reactions were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Digested PCR products were resolved by 2% TAE agarose gel electrophoresis. Indel frequencies were calculated by comparing the intensities of the T7-digested bands to the sum of both full-length and digested bands, quantified using ImageJ. mRNA translation assays Messenger RNA (mRNA) translation assays were performed using the Invitrogen Click-iT™ HPG Alexa Fluor™ 488 Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (cat# C10428 ® ® ® Colony formation assays Indicated cells were seeded into six-well or 6 cm dishes (500 or 1,000 cells per well) and cultured in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO 2 Cell viability MTT assays Cell viability MTT assays were performed as described previously [ 32 2 Mass spectrometry analyses to identify flag-SpCas9 interacting proteins NC and SpCas9-Flag lentiviruses were used to infect DU145 and MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. Infected cells were selected in media containing 1 μg/ml puromycin for 72 h to eliminate non-infected cells. The resulting cells were harvested using EBC buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40) supplemented with a PI and protein phosphatase inhibitor (PPI) cocktail. For IP, 2 mg of whole-cell lysate (WCL) was incubated with Flag-M2 agarose beads under gentle rotation at 4°C for 4 h. The Flag immunoprecipitants were washed four times with NETN buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.5% NP-40). For MDA-MB-231 cells, proteins were diluted to 100 μg/μl using 8 M urea (U4883, Sigma–Aldrich) and subjected to FASP trypsin digestion. Briefly, proteins were reduced with 50 mM DTT (A39255, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 15 min at 65°C, followed by dilution with 200 μl of 8 M urea. The samples were transferred to a 30K MWCO spin filter (14‐558‐349, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and centrifuged at 10 000 × g g g g g 29 For MDA-MB-231 cells, peptides were separated using reverse-phase nano-HPLC using a nanoACQUITY ultraperformance LC (Waters Corporation). Peptides were trapped on a 2 cm column (Pepmap 100; 3-μm particle size and 100-Å pore size) and separated on a 25 cm EASYspray analytical column (75-μm inside diameter [i.d.], 2.0-μm C 18 33 34 33 34 35 RNA-seq analysis DU145 cells stably expressing NC or WT-SpCas9 via lentiviral infection were harvested at sub-confluent confluence. Bulk RNA was extracted using EZ-10 DNAaway RNA Miniprep Kit (Biobasic BS88136) and subjected to RNA library construction and subsequent high-throughput sequencing by Novogene, Inc. Bioinformatics analyses were also performed by Novogene. A brief bioinformatics analysis pipeline from Novogene is listed below. Data quality control: Raw data (raw reads) of fastq format were firstly processed through fastp software. In this step, clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing adapters, reads containing poly-N, and low-quality reads from raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30, and GC content of the clean data were calculated. All the downstream analyses were based on the clean data with high quality. Reads mapping to the reference genome: Reference genome and gene model annotation files were downloaded from genome website. Use HISAT2 (2.2.1) to build the index of the reference genome and use HISAT2 to align paired-end clean reads to the reference genome. HISAT2 can use the gene model annotation file to create splice-aware alignments, providing better alignment accuracy compared to other non-splice alignment tools. Quantification of gene expression level feature: Counts (2.0.6) was used to count the number of reads mapped to each gene. And then FPKM of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene. FPKM, expected number of Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Million base pairs sequenced, considers the effect of sequencing depth and gene length for the reads count at the same time, and is currently the most used method for estimating gene expression levels. Differential expression analysis: For DESeq2 with biological replicates: Differential expression analysis for two conditions/groups was performed using the DESeq2 R package (1.42.0). DESeq2 provides statistical programs for determining differential expression in digital gene expression data using models based on negative binomial distribution. The resulting P 2 P 2 GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes: Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes was implemented by the clusterProfiler (4.8.1), in which gene length bias was corrected. GO terms with corrected P http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ Gene set enrichment analysis: Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a computational approach to determine whether a predefined gene set can show a significant consistent difference between two biological states. The genes were ranked according to the degree of differential expression in the two samples, and then the predefined gene set was tested to see whether they were enriched at the top or bottom of the list. GESA can include subtle expression changes. We used the local version of the GSEA analysis tool, http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp Protein purification GST-RPL23a and GST-Akt1-tail were expressed in Escherichia coli 600 g  In vitro  In vitro 31 in vitro 2 2  In vitro For in vitro Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 software.

To assess whether Cas9 influences ribosome-associated biological functions, we first examined mRNA translation. Using a fluorescence-based assay, we found that NC infection alone significantly reduced mRNA translation in DU145 cells, while Cas9 expression did not further diminish translation intensity (Fig. 3A 2E 1N Figure 3.

Both viral infection by NC and SpCas9 expression were found to induce cell growth changes in certain cell lines. However, stable SpCas9 expression affected a subset of but not all cell lines, revealing a context-dependent role of SpCas9 in cell growth control. In this study, we focused on understanding how SpCas9 facilitates cell growth. By establishing the SpCas9 interactome in DU145 and MDA-MB-231 cells, where SpCas9 expression promotes cell growth, ribosome proteins were identified as top, shared binding partners. Further mechanistic investigations showed that ribosomal subunits, such as RPL26 and RPL23a, interact with the Sin1 subunit of the mTORC2 complex. This binding releases Sin1-PH inhibition of the mTOR kinase domain (a mechanism reported previously [ 31 38 Given that in CRISPR-mediated loss-of-function screens, Cas9 is typically stably introduced into target cells, tissues, or animals, followed by transient transfection of sgRNAs [ 41 During viral or bacterial infections, it has been reported that pathogens can hijack the host’s mRNA translation machinery, including ribosomes, to ensure efficient translation of viral or bacterial proteins [ 42–44 45 46 Our study has several limitations. First, we examined only SpCas9 and did not assess other bacterial Cas9 proteins, leaving it unclear whether and how they might similarly influence cell growth. Second, our focus was limited to cell growth using a 2D assay, without investigating other cellular behaviors such as migration, stress responses, treatment sensitivity, or tumor immunity, which warrant further exploration. Third, while ribosomal components were identified as common hits in our proteomic analyses of DU145 and MDA-MB-231 cells, DU145 cells specifically showed enrichment of mitochondrial RPL/RPS (mRPL/mRPS) proteins. Whether Cas9 affects mitochondrial mRNA translation and whether this contributes to Cas9-induced alterations in cell growth remain open questions for future investigation.
