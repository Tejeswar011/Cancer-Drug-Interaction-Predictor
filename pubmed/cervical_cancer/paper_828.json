Candidate miRNAs exhibiting significant upregulation with a log2 fold change > 4.5 were selected for validation via RT-qPCR in serum samples from patients with CCA. The diagnostic utility of these serum miRNAs was subsequently evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to assess their ability to distinguish CCA from normal controls and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This performance was assessed for the miRNAs as standalone markers and in combination with conventional tumor markers. Results Analysis of miRNA expression profiles identified seven upregulated candidates for validation. Among these, serum levels of miR-99a-5p, miR-516a-5p, and miR-526b-5p were significantly elevated in patients with CCA compared to both normal controls (all area under the curve, AUC > 0.79, p < 0.0001) and patients with HCC (all AUC > 0.80, p < 0.0001). A diagnostic panel combining these three miRNAs demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing CCA from normal controls (AUC = 0.899) and from HCC (AUC = 0.937). The panel’s performance was further enhanced by incorporating conventional tumor markers, achieving an AUC of 0.928 when combined with CA19−9, and rising to 0.959 with the inclusion of both CA19−9 and CEA. Conclusions These findings indicate that a panel comprising miR-99a-5p, miR-516a-5p, and miR-526b-5p, alone or with established tumor markers, offers high accuracy as a minimally invasive diagnostic tool for CCA, and can effectively distinguish it from HCC.

Incidence and mortality rates of CCA have been increasing worldwide over the past decades [ 1 Opisthorchis viverrini 2 3 4 5 The nature of CCA shows a high degree of heterogeneity [ 6 7 9 10 11 12 Circulating miRNAs found in biofluids such as plasma, serum, and urine are increasingly of interest as potential biomarkers for various diseases, including cancer [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 24 25 28 Here, we aimed to develop a miRNA panel as a novel, effective diagnostic biomarker for CCA. We analyzed miRNA profiles using sequences of small RNAs from two genetically altered CCA cell lines (p53-mutant KKU-213B and p53-wildtype KKK-D068H1) to reduce the heterogeneity of CCA and incorporate a control of MMNK1 immortalized cholangiocyte cell line. MiRNAs upregulated in all cell lines were selected as miRNA panel. Serum samples from CCA patients and normal individuals were compared to identify a potential miRNA biomarker panel for CCA and validated with serum from HCC patients by RT-qPCR. The findings of this study demonstrate that the identified biomarker panel achieves optimal diagnostic accuracy for CCA, with excellent sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) values in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, highlighting its potential to improve diagnosis. Materials and methods Sample collection and ethics statement The Japanese Collection of Research Bio-Resources (JCRB) Cell Bank in Japan provided the immortalized cholangiocyte cell line (MMNK1) and the two human CCA cell lines (KKU-213B and D068H1). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with high glucose (4.5 g/L) (Gibco, Thermo Fisher, USA), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The cultures were kept at 37 °C in an incubator with 5% CO 2 Serum samples from patients diagnosed with CCA and HCC were collected at Khon Kaen University’s Cholangiocarcinoma Research Institute between 2 February 2022 and 20 December 2023. The study was approved by the Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee for Human Research (Reference No. HE 571283), and all patients provided written informed consent. This study employed leftover serum samples of those patients. Normal control (NC) samples were taken from leftover serum of healthy individuals who came to Khon Kaen University’s Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences’ Office for Medical Technology and Physical Therapy Health Service from 26 June to 22 July in the year 2023. The study protocol (HE 662104) was approved by the Khon Kaen University Human Ethics Committee. All blood was collected in clotting tubes and processed within two hours of collection. Any samples exhibiting hemolysis were discarded. After the serum was separated by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 °C, it was promptly aliquoted and kept at −80 ºC until miRNA extraction. Three hundred microliters of serum per sample were utilized for RNA extraction and subsequent experimental procedures. Small-RNA sequencing and analysis Frozen cell pellets of three cell lines were used: p53-mutant KKU-213B CCA cells (n = 3 per cell line), p53-wildtype KKK-D068H1 CCA cells (n = 3), and MMNK1 immortalized normal cholangiocyte cells (n = 3). RNA was extracted from cell pellets using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit and subjected to small-RNA sequencing. A total of 3 μg of total RNA per sample was used as input material for the small-RNA library. Sequencing libraries were generated using the NEBNext Multiplex Small-RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB, USA.). PCR amplification was performed using LongAmp Taq 2X Master Mix, SR Primer for Illumina, and index (X) primer. Library quality was assessed on the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system using DNA high-sensitivity chips. The clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using TruSeq SR Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina). After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina platform, and 50-bp single-end reads were generated. Clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing poly-N, with 5´ adapter contaminants, without the 3´ adapter or the insert tag, containing poly A or T or G or C, and low-quality reads from raw data. The small-RNA tags were mapped to the reference sequence using Bowtie [ 29 30 Selection of candidate miRNAs After small-RNA sequencing, seven candidate miRNAs were selected as significantly and differentially expressed according to log2 fold change (> 4.5), p-value (<0.05). Detailed information on these candidate miRNAs is presented in S1 Table RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction RNA was extracted from serum samples using the NucleoSpin ® st S2 Table ® −ΔΔCt Assessing tumor markers in serum samples Serum levels of CA19−9 and CEA were measured using an automated analyzer (Elecsys e801, part of the cobas 8000 modular analyzer series, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) at the clinical laboratory section of Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University. To ensure the precision and accuracy of the measurements, internal quality control materials (PC TM, Roche) and external quality control materials (Riqas, Randox Laboratories, Antrim, UK) were utilized. Functional and pathway analysis The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis were performed using Shinygo 0.82 to identify and analyze significantly upregulated miRNAs (cutoff adjusted p-value < 0.01) between p53-mutant and p53-wildtype CCA cell lines. The biological process (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular functions (MF) of the GO terms were noted. An adjusted p-value of less than 0.05 was used to identify significant results. If more than 20 terms were found, the top 20 were shown using the techniques outlined. Statistical analysis The serum miRNA expression levels of CCA patients, NC, and HCC patients were compared using the Mann-Whitney test. G*Power (version 3.1) software was used for the determination of the optimal sample size for experiments, and above 80% was obtained in each compared group. ROC curves and the area under the ROC curve were analyzed to assess the diagnostic values of the detected serum and the panel. The DeLong method was used to determine statistical differences between ROC curves [ 31 Results Discovery of potential miRNAs for the diagnosis of CCA In this study, small-RNA sequences from three cell lines (p53-mutant KKU-213B, p53-wildtype KKK-D068H1, and MMNK1) were analyzed. In total, 1992 differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs) were detected in comparisons among the cell lines. Of these, 221 were upregulated in KKU-213B relative to MMNK1 and 245 were upregulated in KKK-D068H1 relative to MMNK1. Seventy-three miRNAs appeared in both lists. Finally, seven upregulated miRNAs with a log2 fold change (FC) > 4.5 were selected for further investigation: miR-99a-5p, miR-516a-5p, miR-526b-5p, miR-2113, miR-429, miR-148a-3p, and miR-200b-3p, as shown in Fig 1 10.1371/journal.pone.0333279.g001 Fig 1 Workflow for selecting candidate miRNAs. Diagnostic performance for CCA of seven candidate miRNAs To evaluate potential miRNAs to distinguish CCA patients from NC, we measured the seven candidate miRNAs in sera from both groups (n = 20 in each) using RT-qPCR. The sample sizes were adequate according to G*Power analysis (>80% statistical power). MiRNA-16 was used as an endogenous housekeeping miRNA to normalize the expression of selected miRNAs in serum [ 32 Fig 2A 2B Fig 2C 2D Fig 2E 2F ), Fig 2G 2H Fig 2I 2J Fig 2K 2L Fig 2M 2N 10.1371/journal.pone.0333279.g002 Fig 2 Diagnostic performance of potential miRNAs in CCA patients using relative expression and ROC curve analyses. The expression levels of seven potential miRNAs were quantified by RT-qPCR in 40 serum samples (20 NC and 20 CCA samples), and ROC curve analysis for seven miRNAs was also performed. Three candidate miRNAs—miR-99a-5p (A, B) (C, D) (E, F) (G, H) (I, J) (K, L) (M, N) High diagnostic utility of three miRNAs for the diagnosis of CCA The validation step utilized a greater number of CCA sera and NC sera than the screening step. Serum samples from patients with HCC were added to identify biomarkers more specific to CCA. For the validation phase, we used serum samples from 27 NC, 47 CCA patients, and 27 HCC patients. The three miRNAs we tested were those with considerably elevated expression in CCA in comparison to NC (as shown in Fig 2 Fig 3 10.1371/journal.pone.0333279.g003 Fig 3 Validation of three miRNAs using relative expression and ROC curves. All three were significantly upregulated in CCA (n = 47) compared with NC (n = 27) and HCC (n = 27). The expression levels and AUC values in the CCA vs. NC and CCA vs. HCC of the three candidate miRNAs, miR-99a-5p (A, B, C), miR-516a-5p (D, E, F), and miR-526b-5p (G, H, I) were determined by RT-qPCR and ROC analysis, respectively. A circulating miRNA panel enhances the efficacy of CCA diagnosis When the three miRNAs were combined for the analysis, the sensitivity and specificity values were 81% and 82%, respectively, and the AUC was 0.899 in the CCA compared to the NC group. When the CCA group was compared with the HCC group, the sensitivity and specificity values were 81% and 100%, respectively, and the AUC was 0.937. When all three miRNAs were combined, these values were greater than for single miRNAs ( Fig 4A 4B Fig 4C 4D S3 Table Table 1 10.1371/journal.pone.0333279.t001 Table 1 Ability of individual and combined circulating miRNAs to discriminate CCA from NC and HCC by RT-qPCR. miRNA AUC 95% CI p-value Cut off values Sensitivity Specificity PPV NPV AC  NC vs. CCA miR-99a-5p 0.832 0.727-0.937 <0.0001 0.47 96% 67% 85% 90% 86% miR-516a-5p 0.794 0.689-0.898 <0.0001 0.41 87% 59% 79% 73% 77% miR-526b-5p 0.831 0.734-0.929 <0.0001 0.50 92% 67% 82% 81% 82% miR-99a-5p + 516a-5p 0.875 0.794-0.956 <0.0001 0.39 96% 63% 80% 89% 82% miR-516a-5p + 526b-5p 0.864 0.781-0.947 <0.0001 0.46 87% 70% 83% 73% 80% miR-99a-5p + 526b-5p 0.870 0.788-0.952 <0.0001 0.63 75% 85% 90% 66% 78% miR-99a-5p + 516a-5p + 526b-5p 0.899 0.831-0.967 <0.0001 0.66 81% 82% 81% 82% 78%  HCC vs. CCA miR-99a-5p 0.814 0.705-0.923 <0.0001 0.62 92% 67% 83% 82% 82% miR-516a-5p 0.807 0.708-0.905 <0.0001 0.41 87% 59% 79% 73% 77% miR-526b-5p 0.855 0.769-0.942 <0.0001 0.94 83% 78% 87% 72% 81% miR-99a-5p + 516a-5p 0.887 0.815-0.958 <0.0001 0.79 68% 96% 97% 62% 77% miR-516a-5p + 526b-5p 0.890 0.818-0.961 <0.0001 0.60 81% 85% 90% 72% 82% miR-99a-5p + 526b-5p 0.903 0.838-0.969 <0.0001 0.72 75% 100% 97% 67% 81% miR-99a-5p + 516a-5p + 526b-5p 0.937 0.885-0.989 <0.0001 0.72 81% 100% 81% 100% 89% 95% CI = 95% confidence interval, PPV = Positive predictive value, NPV = Negative predictive value, AC = Accuracy 10.1371/journal.pone.0333279.g004 Fig 4 Individual candidate miRNAs alone or combined enhances the efficiency of CCA diagnosis.

No correlations were found, as shown in S4 Table Functional and pathway analyses KEGG pathway and GO analysis were performed on the predicted target genes of significantly upregulated miRNAs compared between p53-mutant and p53-wildtype cell lines. The results are shown in Fig 6 Fig 6A Fig 6B Fig 6C Fig 6D 10.1371/journal.pone.0333279.g006 Fig 6 The KEGG and GO analysis of significantly upregulated miRNAs. The pathways relating to target gene enrichment in the KEGG analysis (A) (B) (C) Discussion This study reports the findings of three candidate miRNAs as potential diagnostic markers for CCA and explores how this miRNA panel can be applied to support better diagnosis of CCA, particularly in patients suspected of concurrent CCA and HCC. We discovered candidate miRNAs using small-RNA sequencing in three cell lines, namely p53-mutant, wildtype CCA, and an immortalized cholangiocyte (MMNK1) line. Seven miRNAs exhibited significant upregulation in p53-mutant and wildtype CCA cell lines relative to MMNK1. RT-qPCR was performed on the sera of CCA patients and NC, revealing significantly higher expression of three out of seven miRNAs (miR-99a-5p, miR-516a-5p, and miR-526b-5p). CCA can sometimes be challenging to differentiate from HCC because both have morphological, genomic, and clinical heterogeneity [ 33 35 The selected miRNAs in our study possess scientific interest owing to their respective roles as diagnostic markers in a variety of cancers according to previous publications. One of the candidate miRNAs, miR-99a-5p, is a predictive and diagnostic biomarker in tissue samples from bladder cancer [ 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 48 49 50 Our findings indicated that the expression levels of miR-99a-5p, miR-516a-5p, and miR-526b-5p were elevated only in CCA when compared to HCC and NC. A previous study reported that levels of four different miRNAs were specifically and consistently upregulated in HCC patients but not in non-HCC patients, and they concluded that these markers might be specific to HCC [ 51 52 Regarding the diagnosis of CCA, a circulating two-miRNA panel of upregulated miR-877 and downregulated miR-16 has been previously shown to have good potential in diagnosing individuals with distal CCA and distinguishing it from benign disease and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [ 53 54 55 56 While this research provides significant insights regarding miRNAs, there are a few perspectives that should be considered for further improvement and robustness. To begin with, distinct miRNA biomarkers vary based on the type of cancer and the samples’ origin, blood-cell contamination and the anticoagulant employed during collection may have an impact on plasma or serum measurements [ 57 S5 Table 58 . 59 60 Based on our study, a novel panel of three circulating miRNAs can be used as a diagnostic marker and it can distinguish CCA from the NC and HCC groups. To improve the diagnosis of CCA, we exclusively compared the NC group with the CCA group using our panel of miRNAs and established tumor markers. A limitation of this study is that our sample size was relatively small during the screening and validation phases. Hence, further research with a larger, multi-center prospective study is needed to explore the value of unique panels of markers for the study of certain types of cancers. In our study, additional reference miRNAs could not be used in validation because of limitations in sample availability and resources. Future investigations should utilize additional reference miRNAs to enhance the normalization accuracy and ensure the robustness of RT-qPCR results. Conclusion We conclude that a panel of three specific circulating miRNAs (miR-99a-5p, miR-516a-5p, and miR-526b-5p) might be useful as minimally invasive, novel indicators for accurate diagnosis to differentiate persons with CCA not only from healthy individuals but also from HCC cases. Additionally, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the miRNA panel and the combination of this panel with CA19−9 or CEA are higher than those of the tumor markers alone or of individual miRNAs. Further research could focus on evaluating the clinical utility of these miRNAs in larger cohorts, including confirming their specificity against other relevant diseases and pathological conditions, and investigating their roles in the pathophysiological mechanisms of CCA progression.
