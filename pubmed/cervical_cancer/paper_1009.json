This study is the first to systematically compare nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEF) and microsecond pulsed electric fields (µsPEF) for cardiac ablation, filling a key knowledge gap as nsPEF enters clinical trials. Nanosecond pulsed electric fields promoted cardiomyocyte-selective killing with reduced endothelial damage, supporting its potential to minimize adverse remodelling and thrombosis. Cardiomyocytes showed delayed cell death kinetics compared to endothelial cells, while nsPEF exposure maintained a tighter coupling between membrane permeabilization and lethality—potentially reducing myocardial stunning. Raman spectroscopy revealed that nsPEF ablation favours oxidized cytochrome c-associated apoptotic pathways, while µsPEF shifts cytochrome c to its reduced, apoptosis-inhibiting form, indicating difference in cell death mechanisms. Introduction Electroporation, also known as electropermeabilization, 1 2 3 4–6 7 8 9 10–17 5 18 A key advantage of pulsed electric fields (PEFs) over other ablation technologies is their ability to selectively target cellular compartment of tissue, primarily affecting cell membranes while preserving the extracellular matrix. Further understanding the differential effects of PEF on various cell types is more complex. Most of our current knowledge about cellular sensitivity to PEF comes from in vitro 19–22 There is limited knowledge about how specific physiological and morphological characteristics influence cellular sensitivity to PEF. Earlier studies, especially those using electrical circuit models, suggested that larger cells or cells with larger nuclei may be more vulnerable to damage. 21 23 24 22 25 et al 22 26–28 The selectivity of short electric pulses for cardiomyocytes during cardiac ablation is crucial to prevent tissue remodelling and avoid excessive damage to endothelial cells, which could create new substrates for arrhythmias. 29–31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 While cardiomyocytes are generally considered more sensitive to electroporation than endothelial cells, definitive data remain scarce, and the differential effects of nsPEF and µsPEF on cardiac cells are not well understood. This study aims to compare the mechanisms and cytotoxic efficiency of nsPEF and µsPEF on cardiac and endothelial cells, revealing differences in their ability to selectively permeabilize and kill cardiomyocytes while sparing endothelial cells. Methods Cell cultures Experiments were conducted using the AC16 human cardiomyocytes (Cytion, Eppelheim, Germany) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, C-12205; PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO₂ atmosphere in their respective recommended media and expanded to 80–90% confluency. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in EC growth medium (C-22010; PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) and AC16 cells in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12; Capricorn Scientific, Ebsdorfergrund, Germany). All media supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA), 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA USA), and 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, New York, USA). Setup for electroporation of cell monolayers Two days before PEF exposure, cells were seeded onto 24-well plates at a density of 0.15 × 10 6 Electrode arrays We developed three custom electrode arrays for PEF delivery: For nanosecond pulses, two parallel stainless steel rods (0.9 mm outer diameter, 1.9 mm centre-to-centre distance). For microsecond pulses, stainless steel rods with 1.65 mm (cathode) and 0.5 mm (anode) outer diameters, spaced 1.85 mm apart. To minimize gas evolution during microsecond pulse trains, we enlarged the cathode, reducing current density at its surface and preventing bubble formation, which could otherwise distort the electric field. This decrease in current density helps alleviate gas evolution at the electrode, as noted in previous studies where trains of long pulses (≥100 μs) at lethal intensities resulted in significant bubble formation at the cathode. 8 39 For ex vivo Electroporation procedure Electric field parameters—pulse number, frequency, and intensity—were optimized through preliminary experiments to create comparable lesions across nanosecond and microsecond pulses. A modified Anet A8 3D printer (Shenzhen Anet Technology Co., China) with a custom electrode holder was used for precise positioning of electrodes perpendicular to the cell monolayers ( Figure 1A 8 40 41 Figure 1 Experimental workflow, image analysis, and electric field simulation. ( A B C Pulse generation and monitoring A pulse generator, constructed at the Institute of High Magnetic Fields (VGTU, Vilnius, Lithuania), delivered pulses from 100 ns to 1 ms. For nsPEF, trains of 200 pulses at 1.4 kV were delivered at 10 Hz, while for µsPEF, 20 pulses at 300 V with 100 μs duration were delivered at 1 Hz. Pulse shape and amplitude were monitored with a TBS1052C oscilloscope (Tektronix, Beaverton, OR, USA).  In vitro For fluorescence imaging, cells were incubated with 2.25 μM Hoechst-33342 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), a membrane-permeant nucleic acid dye, 1 h before exposure. To assess cell death, 75 μM propidium iodide (PI) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) solution was added at intervals from 2 to 60 h post-exposure, marking permanently permeabilized (dead) cells. 42–45 YO-PRO-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), a nucleic acid dye sensitive to membrane permeabilization, was used for nanopore detection. The dye was added right before electroporation. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope (Nikon Instruments Europe BV) with a 4×, 0.3 NA objective. The samples were imaged using DAPI, Cy3, and FITC filter sets for Hoechst, PI, and YO-PRO-1, respectively. Image analysis For image analysis post-PEF exposure, a rectangular region of interest (ROI) (0.5 mm × 3.7 mm) was defined between electrode centres perpendicular to the line connecting the electrodes (see Figure 1B Cells were classified as YO-PRO-1 positive only when their fluorescence intensity was more than 30% above the background level within an area matching the minimum nuclear size defined by Hoechst staining (7 µm). Cells showing lower YO-PRO-1 fluorescence or a fluorescent area smaller than the nuclei were considered non-permeabilized. Electric field simulations Electric field distribution was simulated using Sim4Lifelite v7.3.0 software (Zurich Med Tech, Switzerland), matching experimental electrode positions ( Figure 1C  Ex vivo All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and were approved by the local authorities (Regierungspräsidium Tübingen) under animal protocol no. M03/19 M, following the ARRIVE guidelines. Mice were housed under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle at temperatures of 18–23°C with 40–60% humidity. Water and food were provided ad libitum Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation under isoflurane anaesthesia (5% v/v), and hearts were extracted. Electrodes positioned 1 mm apart were inserted into the epicardium, spanning the ventricular wall. Ablation was performed with 300 ns, 200-pulse nsPEF at 10 Hz, and 100 µs, 20-pulse µsPEF at 1 Hz. To assess lesion size and progression, hearts were incubated at 37°C in pre-warmed Claycomb medium (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 0.5, 1, 2, or 4 h post-ablation, then immersed in 23,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution (10 mg/mL, prepared by dissolving 0.25 g TTC in 25 mL dPBS) for 20 min to stain viable tissue. Tissues were subsequently fixed in formaldehyde and imaged using a high-resolution scanner (ViewPix 700, BiobTep). This experimental workflow allowed temporal assessment of electroporation-induced lesion development. During the first 4 h post-ablation, lesions showed sharp, well-demarcated borders with clear separation between TTC-positive (viable) and TTC-negative (non-viable) tissue. We did not observe loss of TTC staining outside the ablation zone in this interval; the gradual, spatially confined enlargement of the lesion therefore likely reflects biologically meaningful, electroporation-mediated injury. Regions outside the ablation zone retained TTC staining for up to 4 h, supporting the specificity of the observed changes. Beyond 4 h, progressive pallor developed in previously unaffected regions, consistent with declining viability due to absent perfusion. Accordingly, we restricted quantitative analyses to the first 4 h to capture early injury dynamics relevant to clinical PFA while minimizing confounding artefacts. Additionally, it should be noted that flattening of the heart tissue during scanning artificially increased its apparent dimensions, potentially leading to overestimation of lesion size. Image analysis hearts Heart image analysis involved the detection and segmentation of TTC-stained lesions using Ilastik software. Initially, a training phase was conducted where representative regions in selected images were manually annotated to distinguish lesions from background tissue. These annotations were used to train Ilastik’s classifier to identify patterns based on pixel intensity and texture features. Following training, the classifier automatically segmented all images, distinguishing lesions from surrounding tissue according to the learned patterns. Ilastik assigned probability scores to each pixel, producing greyscale probability maps, which were subsequently exported and analysed in CellProfiler to quantify lesion size and shape. Morphometric parameter, the form factor, was used to quantify the uniformity and compactness of the electroporation-induced lesion in ex vivo 2 Raman microspectroscopy and imaging Forty-eight hours prior to Raman imaging, cells were seeded into removable eight-well chambers (Ibidi, Gräfelfing, Germany) pre-coated with human fibronectin, electroporated, and incubated for 4 h. After incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution. Raman spectroscopy of fixed cells was performed using the confocal Raman microspectrometer WITec alpha 300R (WITec GmbH, Ulm, Germany) that was equipped with a green laser (532 nm) and a CCD spectrograph with a grating of 600 g/mm. The microspectrometer was managed by Control 6 software (WITec GmbH). Images of 50 × 50 µm frame size were acquired at a laser power of 50 mW, an integration time of 0.1 s per spectrum, a pixel resolution of 1 × 1 µm, and at least as triplicates. Cells were submerged in PBS during the measurement and imaged with 63× dipping objective (W Plan-Apochromat, Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany). Spectral processing and multivariate data analysis Pre-processing of obtained spectra included four steps: (i) removing artefacts originating from cosmic rays; (ii) cropping spectra within the wavenumber range 327–3045 cm −1 Characteristic spectra of cellular components were identified by true component analysis (TCA)—mathematical fitting model based on a non-negative matrix factorization, implemented within the Project 6 software (WITec GmbH, Ulm, Germany). True component analysis extracts the dominant spectral components present in the dataset and visualizes their localization using false-colour intensity distribution heat maps. Principal component analysis (PCA) (The Unscrambler X, CAMO Software AS, Oslo, Norway) of acquired data was used to identify and interpret changes in molecular fingerprints of obtained cellular components between the groups of samples ablated by nsPEF and µsPEF. Principal component analysis was performed using the NIPALS algorithm. Spectral information was visualized in 2D scattered plots, information on the contribution to the variation in the dataset was visualized and interpreted based on the loadings plots, and statistical comparison was visualized in box plots. Statistical analysis Different experimental conditions (length of pulses) were randomized and tested across each cell line. For experiments evaluating the electric field strength response, a single experiment yielded 28 measurements, with one measurement taken per ROI. The data from two ROIs, symmetrically located relative to the ablation centre (e.g. the two most peripheral ROIs), were averaged to yield 14 distinct data points. Electric field strength-response data were analysed by fitting a sigmoidal curve using the Hill equation. 46 The dynamics of cell death were quantified by determining the percentage of dead cells within ROIs at specified time intervals. A paired t In ex vivo t P P P P Results Cardiomyocyte showed delayed cell death after nanosecond pulsed electric fields and microsecond pulsed electric fields compared to endothelial cells The interval between exposure to PEFs and the onset of cell death can vary depending on the cell type and pulse parameters. 28 40 41 47 48 40 41 Figure 2 Figure 2 Time course of cell death in human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells following nsPEF and µsPEF exposure. ( A B A B The increasing percentage of dead cells within the ROI reflects the progression and extent of the electric lesion induced by PEF exposure. In human cardiomyocytes, cell death continued to rise over 24 h following both nsPEF and µsPEF protocols ( Figure 2A B Figure 2A B For example, after exposure to nsPEF at 8 kV/cm, the percentage of dead cardiomyocytes increased from 26.8% ± 6 at 2 h to 83.5% ± 13 at 24 h ( P P Supplementary material online Figure S1 In endothelial cells, the majority of cell death occurred within the first 2–4 h, with only a minor increase at later time points. Notably, at the highest tested nsPEF (11 kV/cm), cell death reached 63% ± 5 at 2 h and further increased to 95.5% ± 2 by 6 h. At the lowest electric field strength, the percentage of dead endothelial cells decreased over time—from 32% ± 8 at 2 h—likely due to repopulation of the ablated area by viable cells and/or detachment of dead cells. A similar trend was observed following µsPEF: most endothelial cell death occurred within the first 2–4 h and slightly declined thereafter. For instance, at 2 kV/cm, the percentage of dead cells rose from 74% ± 6 at 2 h to 88% ± 3 at 4 h, followed by a slight decrease to 86% ± 5 at 6 h. These findings confirm that PEF-induced cell death exhibits distinct, cell-type-specific kinetics, with cardiomyocytes showing delayed responses compared to endothelial cells. Notably, our data suggest that the overall dynamics of cell death were less dependent on the pulse parameter itself.  Ex vivo In our ex vivo Figure 3A B Figure 3 Lesion formation in ex vivo A B ex vivo A B Methods Nanosecond pulsed electric field ablation led to the formation of visible lesions over time. A detectable lesion area appeared as early as 1 h post-exposure, with significant changes in size and morphology observed up to 4 h ( Figure 3A P P P Likewise, exposure to µsPEF resulted in a progressive increase in lesion size over time. The ablation area expanded significantly between 0.5 and 4 h post-exposure, increasing from undetectable at 30 min to 15.8 ± 2.2 mm² at 4 h ( P Figure 3B P P Studies using ex vivo Endothelial cells show higher susceptibility to microsecond pulsed electric fields compared to cardiomyocytes Following the determination of cell killing time, we compared the susceptibility of human cardiomyocytes and human endothelial cells to nsPEF and µsPEF. Direct comparison of nsPEF and µsPEF is complicated by the strength–duration relationship of membrane charging, which requires higher field amplitudes for shorter pulses to reach the electroporation threshold. 49 As shown in Figure 4A 50 50 Figure 4 Differential sensitivity of human cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells to µsPEF and nsPEF. ( A B A B In contrast, when ablated with microsecond pulses, endothelial cells demonstrated significantly greater susceptibility ( Figure 4B 50 P While these findings highlight variations in susceptibility based on pulse duration, our further research focused on uncovering the underlying mechanisms responsible for the differences in cell killing selectivity between nanosecond and microsecond pulses. Interplay between cell death and plasma membrane permeabilization after nanosecond pulsed electric fields vs. microsecond pulsed electric fields Nanosecond pulsed electric fields and µsPEF generate pores of different sizes in the plasma membrane, with nsPEF producing smaller pores compared to those induced by µsPEF. 43 50–58 Recent advances in the understanding of electroporation indicate that, regardless of the extent of membrane disruption, cells typically restore membrane continuity within minutes after exposure. 59 To investigate the relationship between cell death and plasma membrane permeabilization, we used YO-PRO-1 dye staining to quantify membrane permeability. In human cardiomyocytes exposed to nanosecond electroporation ( Figure 5A Figure 5A Figure 5 Interplay between plasma membrane permeabilization and ablation efficiency after nsPEF and µsPEF exposure in cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. ( A B A B Figure 2 n P During electroporation with longer microsecond pulses, membrane permeability in both cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells exceeded cell lethality ( Figure 5B Our findings demonstrate that pulse duration strongly influences how membrane permeabilization translates into cell death, potentially explaining the divergent responses of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells to nsPEF and µsPEF. Notably, while nsPEF-induced permeabilization in cardiomyocytes consistently led to cell death, µsPEF exposure did not elicit the same outcome. This key observation led us to further investigate the downstream molecular pathways activated in cardiomyocytes following nsPEF and µsPEF treatment. Raman spectroscopy shows the molecular changes corresponding to activation of regulated cell death after exposure to nanosecond pulsed electric fields To specifically investigate the mechanisms of cell death, we selected cells within the ROI between electrodes corresponding to an electric field intensity between 12.5–13 kV/cm for nsPEF and 2.1–2.2 kV/cm for µsPEF. To capture the progression of cell death and potential differences between microsecond and nanosecond pulse exposures, cells were fixed 4 h post-exposure for subsequent Raman analysis. Images were acquired in the ablated region as well as in the periphery ( Figure 6A Figure 6 Multivariate spectral analysis reveals molecular differences between nsPEF- and µsPEF-induced ablation in human cardiomyocytes. ( A B C D E P F n t Analysis of hyperspectral maps enabled marker-independent localization of subcellular structures and visualization of cell morphology. Three cellular components were discriminated via TCA by specific spectral signatures: nuclei (blue), lipids (yellow), and cytochrome c (green) ( Figure 6B C −1 −1 2 − Supplementary material online Table S1 −1 −1 −1 2 −1 −1 To further assess submolecular changes, individual spectra were extracted for every component and further analysed by PCA to evaluate spectral alterations between the PEF treatments. Principal component analysis of nuclei and lipid spectra did not reveal significant differences between the two groups (see Supplementary material online Figure S2 Figure 6D Figure 6E Figure 6F Spectral differences were observed at multiple peak positions. The biological assignments of the Raman spectra are provided in Supplementary material online Table S1 −1 −1 −1 60 −1 61 −1 Supplementary material online Figure S3 Discussion The use of PEFs to selectively target the myocardial cellular compartment presents a promising strategy for treating cardiac arrhythmias. Currently, clinical PFA predominantly uses mono- and bipolar microsecond pulses. As a novel modality of cardiac ablation, nanosecond PFA is currently undergoing initial clinical trials ( NCT06355063 In this study, we demonstrate a significant difference in the relationship between plasma membrane permeabilization and cell death induced by nano- vs. microsecond pulses. In cardiomyocytes, membrane permeabilization caused by nsPEF consistently led to cell death. In contrast, cells exposed to microsecond pulses can remain viable despite evident membrane permeabilization. It is known that nsPEF requires higher voltages to achieve electroporation than µsPEF due to the strength–duration relationship of membrane charging. 49 8 49 59 62 63 Most clinically available PFA systems deliver monophasic or biphasic microsecond-range pulses (≈500–2000 V) optimized to create deep myocardial lesions with specific electrode geometries. 64 65 66 67 To enable a fair comparison of nsPEF and µsPEF ablation after setting a fixed pulse duration, we adjusted the pulse count, amplitude (voltage), and repetition rate to produce measurable, size-comparable lesions in cell monolayers, equalize total pulse train exposure time across conditions, and minimize Joule heating by using low repetition rates with sufficient inter-pulse intervals for heat dissipation. The work of Pakhomov et al 68 The findings of our study may have clinical implications regarding the stunning phenomenon during PFA. 69 39 70 71 Our research showed that the amount of reversibly electroporated cardiomyocytes after application of nsPEF is minimalized whereas after µsPEF the substantial proportion of cells survive the transient permeabilization potential regaining the ability for further excitation thus creating the substrate for arrhythmia recurrence. Moreover, our data indicate that µsPEFs cause more pronounced endothelial injury than nsPEF. Endothelial injury diminishes antithrombotic signalling (e.g. nitric oxide, prostacyclin), increases oxidative stress and ROS, and initiates tissue fibrosis that may promote electrical decoupling. 32 33 29–31 Our demonstration of greater endothelial damage after µsPEF exposure supports the hypothesis that µsPEF amplify local inflammation and, in turn, increase the risk of AF recurrence. Although a mechanistic dissection of the downstream consequences of PEF-induced endothelial injury lies beyond the scope of this study, it remains an important direction for future research. The mechanisms of cell death following membrane permeabilization have been investigated across various cell lines and electroporation protocols. Several studies have confirmed the occurrence of apoptosis; however, factors such as the composition of the extracellular medium and the concentration of Ca 2+ 47 72 73 The key mechanisms involved in cell injury include (i) damage to DNA and proteins, 28 74 47 72 73 75 73 74 76 77 78 Raman spectroscopy is a non-invasive, marker-independent technique well-suited for detecting cytochrome c in biological samples, including cells and tissues. Its sensitivity to heme group vibrations allows differentiation between reduced and oxidized forms of cytochrome c, notably through distinct Raman peak near 751 cm⁻¹. 79 80 81 82–84 85 86 In our study, cytochrome c was localized and investigated with Raman imaging. Further analysis of the spectral information revealed significant molecular changes indicating shifts between the reduced and oxidized status of the molecule. In response to cellular stress or damage, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria into the cytosol, where it triggers apoptosome formation, leading to the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Notably, only the oxidized form of cytochrome c can initiate this pathway, whereas the reduced form fails to activate it, effectively inhibiting apoptosis. 87 80 Moreover, cytochrome c also exhibits peroxidase activity during apoptosis. When cytochrome c binds to cardiolipin on the inner mitochondrial membrane, its conformation changes, exposing the heme group and enhancing its ability to catalyse the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂). This leads to the oxidation of cardiolipin, a critical step in mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and the subsequent release of cytochrome c into the cytosol that induces apoptosis. 88 89 Our findings, supported by the literature, suggest that exposure of cells to µsPEF increases the levels of the reduced form of cytochrome c, which inhibits apoptosis and might promote a more acute and uncontrolled form of cell death. While in cells ablated by nsPEF an opposite tendency is observed, higher levels of oxidized cytochrome c are present, facilitating the activation of apoptosis. This observation is supportive but not definitive, as Raman spectroscopy alone cannot conclusively determine cell death type, and confirmation with complementary biochemical and imaging approaches will be required in future. In our studies, we used experimentally tractable, widely adopted models—AC16 cardiomyocyte and human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC. Both cell lines were immortalized, and both models were maintained under proliferative culture conditions. Consequently, they not fully recapitulate the phenotype or microenvironment of adult human cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells. These cells were well suited to our monolayer model as their strong adhesion and stable, confluent growth enabled controlled analyses. However, the absence of native 3D architecture, vascular-wall context, and tissue-level conductivity limits direct extrapolation of single-cell ED₅₀ values to intact myocardium or vasculature. In recent years, significant progress in cardiac mapping has improved the precision and completeness of ablation procedures. 90 67 91 67 92 67 93 94 The observed differences in cell sensitivity and cell death mechanisms underscore the potential advantages of nsPEF for cardiac ablation. A deeper understanding of how pulse duration influences both cardiac selectivity and efficacy can improve the protocols and therapeutic outcomes.
