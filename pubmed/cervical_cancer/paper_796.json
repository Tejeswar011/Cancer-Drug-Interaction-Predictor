Summary Since its 2006 FDA approval, the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has transformed the prevention of cervical, oropharyngeal, and other HPV-associated cancers in the United States. Despite notable progress, with 78.2% of adolescents initiating and 62.9% completing vaccination, support for the vaccine is at a critical point. Because the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) mainly provides recommendations, state-level action is crucial. Only five states and territories have adopted school-entry HPV vaccination requirements, but with varying enforcement policies. Uptake varies across the U.S., from Massachusetts' 79.8% completion to Mississippi's 39.1%. Evidence shows that school-entry requirements can significantly improve vaccination rates. As we approach the vaccine's twentieth anniversary, maintaining the current gains and achieving the 80% Healthy People 2030 target for series completion demands a multipronged approach. State policies must become more robust, especially if federal support wanes. Preventing HPV-related cancers for future generations depends on continued progress. By prioritizing policy that strengthens prevention and access, states can safeguard this progress.

A significant portion of adult women and men are positive for HPV (45 and 40%, respectively) at any given time. 1 2 3 , 4 HPV types 16 and 18 are the most common high risk variants that are associated with cervical, anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, and oropharyngeal (OPC) cancers; these variants cause 90% of HPV positive cancers globally. 1 , 5 5 5 5 1 , 5 1 5 5 6 7 Progress and prospects There has been an overall national increase in HPV vaccine initiation and completion nationally. Currently, 78.2% of eligible adolescents between 13 and 17 years of age have received at least one dose of the HPV, with about 62.9% up to date on their vaccine dose. 8 3 Table 1 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Table 1 2024 US HPV vaccination initiation and completion rates of adolescents ages 13–17.

There is a wide variety of factors affecting HPV vaccine uptake in the US. Counterintuitively, vaccination is lower among adolescents from households with higher incomes compared to those with lower incomes. 16 17 17 18 19 Figs. 1 2 8 Fig. 1 HPV vaccine initiation rate. 2024 HPV vaccine initiation rate in the US among 13- to 17-year-old adolescents.

Projections and possibilities HPV vaccine recommendations and uptake in the United States have dramatically evolved since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the HPV vaccine in 2006. 1 , 5 20 The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) oversees federal agencies that approve, recommend, and monitor vaccines, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Center for Disease Control (CDC). 21 21 Fig. 3 21 21 21 21 Fig. 3 Infographic of the federal government's role in vaccine policy and regulation. Aside from the aforementioned vaccine approval and recommendation processes, vaccine policy lies with the states. Since it was first approved, there has been no national requirement or specifically targeted national policy regarding HPV vaccination. 22 , 23 24 25 26 27 States with school-based HPV vaccine requirements School-entry requirements have been implemented sparingly across the US (see Table 2 28 29 30 8 Table 2 US states and territories with HPV vaccine school requirements. State or territory Type of vaccine requirement Year of enactment Strength of exemptions HPV initiation (%) HPV completion (%) Hawaii Administrative 2020 Strong Exemption Requirements 89.2 75.6 Puerto Rico Legislative 2018 Strong Exemption Requirements 91.8 77 Rhode Island Administrative 2015 Strong Exemption Requirements 91.3 76.1 District of Columbia Legislative 2009 Lax Exemption Requirements 89.3 75.8 Virginia Legislative 2008 Lax Exemption Requirements 86.9 71.9 The Council of the District of Columbia passed DC Law 17–10 in 2007, which requires female students to receive the HPV vaccine before entering seventh grade. This rule was amended and enacted in 2009 and required the HPV vaccination for all female students starting sixth grade. 27 31 , 32 33 Rhode Island's Department of Health implemented a policy in 2015 that required all students entering seventh grade to receive the HPV vaccine and one dose a year until 9th grade. 29 29 8 Puerto Rico's Department of Health implemented an HPV vaccine requirement for public school students in 2018. 33 , 34 35 34 , 35 8 Most recently, Hawaii implemented Hawaii Administrative Rule 11–157 in 2020 to require HPV vaccination for students entering the seventh grade. 29 29 8 Other state policy strategies There are other strategies that states have taken in HPV vaccine policy, including funding free or reduced-cost vaccines. Rhode Island has a law that covers the cost of any vaccine recommended by the ACIP, including the HPV vaccine. 29 29 31 29 23 , 29 8 In addition, all 50 states and the District of Columbia now have policies that allow pharmacists to administer the HPV vaccine, with variations regarding age eligibility. 36 29 37 23 , 37 , 38 37 23 23 23 Prognosis State-level HPV vaccine policies will play a particularly vital role in protecting the progress of the HPV vaccine in the United States in the coming years. We found substantial variation in both policies and uptake, with rates as high as 79.8% in Massachusetts and as low as 39.1% in Mississippi. 8 The effects of these requirements have been overwhelmingly positive. Following its policy, Rhode Island increased the vaccination rate in the state, particularly among adolescent boys, and the policy led to better coverage at an earlier age among girls. 39 40 40 32 31 31 8 33 8 41 8 The only school-entry requirement that did not, initially, have a significant impact on HPV vaccination rates was Virginia. 42 25 8 Many states fund free or reduced-cost vaccines. 23 29 18 , 43 , 44 45 , 46 47 , 48 Aside from the vaccine recommendations, federal policy has and will continue to serve an important role in combatting HPV associated cancers. Models from countries that are on track to eliminate cervical cancer, such as Australia, have shown high levels of population coverage for HPV vaccination along with comprehensive preventative screening (i.e., HPV DNA testing and/or Papanicolaou Smears). 13 49 , 50 51 Rhode Island's intervention could be seen as the gold standard due to its impact in significantly increasing vaccine uptake. 52 53 , 54 55 53 , 56 56 56 Posterity Vaccinations and vaccine policy should be apolitical. The focus should remain on their vital, positive public health impact that results in lives saved and serious illness averted for current and future generations. In the case of this vaccine, the focus should be on preventing HPV related cancers for future generations. Above all, the HPV vaccine is a cancer prevention vaccine. It gives us the opportunity to dramatically alter population level trends of several different cancers. It is a vital tool for us to make the future of the US healthy. A multi-pronged approach that includes strong policy and concurrent countering of HPV vaccine disinformation and hesitancy is required to continue our progress toward the Health People 2030 goal of a national HPV series completion rate of 80%. State vaccine policy has served as an empowering tool towards this national goal and will be all the more critical in the immediate future.
