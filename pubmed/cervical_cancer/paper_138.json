DNA mismatch repair (MMR) defects are important players in LS tumorigenesis, but the developmental steps leading to malignancy are incompletely understood. We undertook a deep sequencing approach with a panel of ~1,000 cancer‐associated genes to detect somatic changes in retrospective specimens from 33 LS carriers who had developed endometrial carcinoma (EC) or ovarian carcinoma (OC). Consecutive samples of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH) and EC or OC (64 samples plus blood) were available from a screening period of 15 years (0–15 years). Of carcinomas, all but one (41/42, 98%) were MMR‐deficient by microsatellite instability or immunohistochemical analysis, and 86% (36/42) showed loss of heterozygosity or somatic variants of MMR genes as putative second hits. AH closely resembled EC and OC with respect to MMR deficiency (20/22, 91%) and the presence of second hits (16/22, 73%); moreover, the average tumor mutation burdens and top mutant genes were largely similar in hyperplasia and carcinoma. The proportion of hypermutated tumors (over 10 somatic non‐synonymous mutations per megabase) was 36/42 (86%) among carcinomas and 15/22 (68%) among hyperplasia specimens (statistically non‐significant difference). In individual patients, cancer‐associated genes revealed varying degrees of somatic variant sharing between consecutive specimens of hyperplasia and carcinoma (10/19, 53%), and in some, such variants were detectable in histologically normal endometrium (9/19, 47%) too, one or several years before carcinoma. Our results shed light on the evolutionary trajectories of gynecological cancer development in LS. What's New? Lynch syndrome is a prevalent cause of hereditary gynecological cancers, but the timeline of molecular alterations preceding malignancy remains unclear. By studying consecutive surveillance specimens for up to 15 years before cancer diagnosis, the authors found that atypical endometrial hyperplasia was indistinguishable from endometrial and ovarian carcinoma with respect to mismatch repair deficiency, “second hit” frequency, and somatic mutational profiles. Some variants shared between hyperplasia and carcinoma were also detectable in normal endometrium, suggesting the existence of carcinogenic aberrations long before clinical cancer in Lynch syndrome. endometrial carcinoma Lynch syndrome ovarian carcinoma panel sequencing somatic variant Sigrid Juséliuksen Säätiö 10.13039/501100006306 University of Helsinki Doctoral Programme in Biomedicine The Academy of Finland 330606 Syöpäsäätiö 10.13039/501100010711 Biomedicum Helsinki‐säätiö Jane ja Aatos Erkon Säätiö 10.13039/501100004012 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date 1 December 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:04.10.2025  Kauppinen AK Olkinuora AP Mecklin J‐P Peltomäki PT Molecular analysis of the evolutionary history of endometrial and ovarian carcinoma in Lynch syndrome Int J Cancer 2025 157 11 2294 2308 10.1002/ijc.70074 40772756 PMC12496004 Abbreviations AH atypical hyperplasia B blood CAH complex atypical hyperplasia CCEC clear cell endometrial carcinoma CCOC clear cell ovarian carcinoma CH complex hyperplasia without atypia CxEC cervical adenocarcinoma EC endometrial carcinoma EEC endometrioid endometrial carcinoma EOC endometrioid ovarian carcinoma FT normal fallopian tube IGV Integrative Genomics Viewer IHC immunohistochemistry LOH loss of heterozygosity LS Lynch syndrome MMR mismatch repair MSI microsatellite instability N normal NE normal endometrium OC ovarian carcinoma SH simple hyperplasia T tumor TMB tumor mutational burden VAF variant allele frequency 1 INTRODUCTION Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most common gynecological malignancy in the Western world, while ovarian carcinoma (OC) is the leading cause of death from a gynecological cancer.  1 MLH1 MSH2 MSH6  2 MLH1 MSH2 MSH6  2  3 Histologically, most ECs from sporadic and LS cases represent type I (estrogen‐dependent, endometrioid) tumors, and stepwise development from endometrial epithelium via endometrial hyperplasia has been proposed.  4  5  6  5  7  5  6  6 Females diagnosed with either EC or OC turn out to have synchronous EC and/or OC in up to 10% of sporadic cases  8  9  10  11  12  13 Recently, sensitive DNA sequencing techniques have detected oncogenic variants in surprisingly high proportions of histologically normal endometria, even from females with no gynecological malignancy.  14  15  16  17  18  19 To address some of the open questions that remain, such as the timeline of molecular aberrations before cancer diagnosis, we took advantage of regular gynecological screening of LS individuals  20 MLH1 MSH2 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Patients and samples The study cohort was ascertained via the nationwide LS Research Registry of Finland from verified LS carriers diagnosed with EC and/or OC; the eligible individuals had been enrolled in regular gynecological surveillance, and the availability of consecutive endometrial biopsy samples together with cancer samples was required.  16  16  16 MLH1 MSH2  21  16  22  23 1 FIGURE 1 Variant sharing between pairs of synchronous carcinomas shown as Venn diagrams. Pairs of synchronous endometrial carcinoma (EC) and ovarian carcinoma (OC) (A), two OCs (B), and two ECs (C) are depicted. Somatic variants were called against blood in all cases except for LOC9 and LOC16, where normal endometrium was used as a reference in the absence of blood. The percentage of shared somatic variants was calculated according to the following formula: (no. of variants shared by cancers 1 and 2)/[[no. of variants shared by cancers 1 and 2] + [no. of variants unique to cancer 1] + [no. of variants unique to cancer 2]]).

Library quantification and quality check were performed using LabChip GX Touch HT High Sensitivity assay (PerkinElmer, Shelton, CT, USA) and Qubit Broad Range DNA Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Libraries were pooled to 8‐plex or 10‐plex reactions according to DNA concentration (Qubit). The exome enrichment was performed using Twist custom panel probes (6.4 Mb). The captured library pools were quantified for sequencing using KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) and LabChip GX Touch HT High Sensitivity assay. Libraries were sequenced on NovaSeq6000 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using S4 flow cell and standard workflow (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), using the NovaSeq6000 v1.5 reagents. The paired end read length was 101 bp. Panel capture design can be found in Table S1 S2 2.4  DRAGEN Germline variants were called and aligned against the GRCh37 reference genome using the Illumina DRAGEN system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the analysis pipeline v3.9. NGS library preparation, sequencing, and sequence analysis were performed by the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland Technology Centre, University of Helsinki. 2.5 Somatic variant calling Somatic variants were called using patient‐matched blood‐derived DNA whenever possible, with VarScan2 v2.3.2  26 p  27 p Frequently mutant genes (top 20) for each histological subtype of EC and OC were retrieved from the COSMIC database ( https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic S3  28 If VarScan2 analysis revealed somatic variants shared between endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, the possible existence of the same variants in histologically normal samples was manually inspected with IGV, and those present in at least five reliable reads and with ≥1% VAF were recorded. 2.6  MMR Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis was based on constitutionally heterozygous MMR gene variants identified by VarSeq (Golden Helix, version 2.4.0) analysis and verified manually with IGV. For pathogenic constitutional variants of MMR genes, LOH ratio in tumor (T) relative to normal (N) tissue was calculated as (alt:ref) T N  29 2 FIGURE 2 Chronological diagrams of Lynch syndrome cases with shared mismatch repair (MMR) or COSMIC gene variants between hyperplasia and the endpoint lesion(s) endometrial carcinoma (LEC cases, [A]) or ovarian carcinoma (LOC cases, [B]). Timepoint of sample collection is presented as years to carcinoma as endpoint (tp 0). Somatic variants were called against blood in all cases except for LEC1, LEC13, LEC15, LEC21 and LOC9, where normal endometrium was used as a reference in the absence of blood. A somatic variant was listed if it was common between carcinoma and at least one hyperplasia sample and affected any of the top 20 mutated genes listed in the COSMIC database for the carcinoma type in question. For MMR or COSMIC gene variants complying with our regular 5% cut‐off, the density of blue color indicates the range to which each variant's variant allele frequency (VAF) belongs. If an MMR gene second hit variant was discovered from any sample with VAF 5% or higher, the same variant was included in the patient's other samples even if it occurred with lower VAF in these. For variants occurring with VAF below 5% and/or detected in normal endometrium, an exact VAF‐value based on Integrative Genomics Viewer analysis is given. In the bottom part of the figure, numbers next to the dots show the total number of shared variants in PanCancer panel genes in pairwise comparisons between the two tissues identified with the dot (endometrial hyperplasia vs. carcinoma).

Our study design was retrospective and included only LS patients who had developed EC or OC. We did not investigate corresponding samples from LS patients who were cancer‐free (such samples were not available), which restricts interpretations of the carcinogenic potential of alterations observed in non‐neoplastic or preneoplastic tissues. Moreover, we lacked access to detailed medical records of our patients. OCs from our series were predominantly of endometrioid or clear cell histology, and these subtypes are thought to arise from endometriosis.  6  50 ARID1A TP53  16  22 In summary, our investigation provides new information on key molecular steps that may lead to EC and/or OC in LS.
