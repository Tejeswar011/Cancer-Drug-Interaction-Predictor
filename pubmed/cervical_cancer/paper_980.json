Radical surgery is the alternative treatment for this population without parametrial invasion. Approximately 85% of newly diagnosed cases occur in developing countries where brachytherapy facilities and expertise are lacking. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of different primary treatment modality (surgery vs. radiation) in this population. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study that included patients registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2022. Patients who were diagnosed with stage IIIC1 cervical cancer without parametrial invasion were identified and further stratified into two groups based on the primary treatment modality (surgery or radiation). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to balance the bias of baseline characteristics between the two groups. The primary outcomes are overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS). Results Of 2176 patients included, 1690 patients underwent primary surgery (group A) and 486 patients underwent primary radiation (group B). Compared to group B, patients who received surgery as primary treatment had a lower ratio of squamous carcinoma and larger tumor size. After one-to-one matching, no differences were found between the two groups on baseline variables. Compared to group B, patients who received surgery as primary treatment were associated with an increased 5-year OS (73.97% vs. 67.55%, HR 0.749[95% CI: 0.594–0.945], p p Conclusion Primary surgery may be a more favorable selection for patients with stage IIIC1 cervical cancer without parametrial invasion for improved survival benefits.

The database covers approximately 28% of the United States population, is publicly accessible, and has been de-identified. The data reported in this study reflects the latest follow-up (November 2022) available in the SEER database. Patients with histologically confirmed cervical cancer (ICD-O-3, primary site: C53.0 Cervix Uteri) who underwent lymphadenectomy as part of their primary treatment were included in the study. Patients were excluded if they did not have lymph node metastasis (N0), if stage information was unavailable, if they had distant metastasis outside of the pelvic lymph nodes, if they had parametrial invasion (T2b-T3b), if they only had microscopic primary lesions (Ta1-Ta2), or if treatment information was unavailable. The patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were included in the study. The cohort was stratified into two groups based on treatment modalities: patients who received cancer-directed surgery (radical or modified radical hysterectomy) as primary treatment were enrolled in group A and patients who received radiation or concurrent radiation as primary treatment were enrolled in group B. Study procedures and data collections Detailed demographic, oncological, and survival data of the patients who fulfilled the aforementioned criteria were extracted from the SEER registry through the software SEER*Stat 8.4.1. The detailed information included age at diagnosis, ethnicity, year of diagnosis, histology subtypes, tumor size, primary tumor extension, the scope of surgery, the modality of radiation, chemotherapy or not, and, survival outcome. The histology subtypes were derived from Histologic Type ICDO-3 and Behavior Code ICD-O-3. The tumor T, N, and M classification were derived from the T (N or M) value based on the AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) Cancer Staging Manual 6th (2004–2015)/7th (2016–2020). As there were no T1b3 codes for cervical cancer in the T value based on AJCC 6th or 7th, we manually transferred T1b into T1b1, T1b2, andT1b3 according to the tumor size (cutoff was > 2 cm for T1b2, and > 4 cm for T1b3, respectively). The type of hysterectomy was derived from RX Summ-Surg Prim Site (1998 +) and pelvic lymphadenectomy data were derived from RX Summ–Scope Reg LN Sur (2003+). The information on radiation was derived from RX Summ–Surg/Rad Seq and Radiation recode. Chemotherapy information was derived from chemotherapy recode (yes, no/unk). Survival outcomes include overall survival, cause-specific survival, and death from other causes. Follow-up began from the day of diagnosis. The reason for death was recorded through the “COD to site recode ICD-O-3 2023 Revision”. One-to-one propensity score matching between group A and group B was performed by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The demographics and oncological characteristics were entered into the model and calculated through an automated algorithm, with the propensity score difference cut-off being 1%. Outcome measurements The primary outcome was to compare the 5-year overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) between patients in the two groups, respectively. OS was defined as the time interval between the initial cervical cancer diagnosis and the date of death due to all death causes or the end of follow-up. CSS was defined as the time interval between the initial diagnosis of cervical cancer and the date of death resulting from cervical cancer or the end of follow-up. Among women who died, causes of death were examined (attributable to this cancer and other diseases) and grouped as previously described. Statistical analysis The statistical software SPSS 25.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was utilized for data analysis. Baseline characteristics were presented using descriptive statistics, which included mean ± standard deviation for continuous data and count ± percentages for categorical data. Comparisons of two groups were performed using Pearson’s chi-squared test for categorical variables and a two-sample t-test of mean differences for continuous variables. Kaplan–Meier methods were used for univariate analysis, and the log-rank test was used to compare the survival based on treatment modality. Cox regression was used to evaluate proportional hazard regression models, and the magnitude of statistical significance was expressed with an HR and 95% confidence interval (CI). The significance level was set at p Results Study population A total of 56,282 patients were screened and 2176 patients were included in the study from Jan 2004 to Dec 2020. All patients were diagnosed with primary cervical cancer with pelvic lymph node metastasis and tumors confined to the cervix except for lymph node metastasis. Of the included patients, 77.67% (1690/2176) who selected cancer-directed surgery as the primary treatment were included in group A, and 22.33% (486/2176) who selected radiation as the primary treatment were included in group B (the details were shown in Fig. 1 p p p p p  Fig. 1 Patients’ disposition and study design One-to-one matching between group A and group B was performed using an automated algorithm with propensity score matching. A total of 486 (28.76%) patients from group A were chosen through propensity score matching based on age, histology subtypes, tumor size, and primary tumor extension for each case. Following the matching process, no statistically significant variances were observed between the two groups in terms of age distribution ( p p p p p 1  Table 1 Clinicopathologic and treatment characteristics of study patients Values Group A n Group B n p Group A after PSM n Group B after PSM n p Age 46.25 ± 13.07 44.85 ± 12.85 0.306 46.36 ± 12.98 44.81 ± 12.99 0.422 < 45 862(51.0) 261(53.7) 228(49.9) 246(53.8) 45–60 652(38.6) 185(38.1) 183(40.0) 173(37.9) > 60 176(10.4) 40(8.2) 46(10.1) 38(8.3) Ethnicity 0.033 0.734 White 1336(79.1) 387(79.6) 372(81.4) 363(79.4) Black 124(7.3) 49(7.6) 44(9.6) 47(10.3) Others 230(13.6) 50(10.3) 41(9.0) 47(10.3) Year at diagnosis 0.302 0.171 20,004 − 2009 695(41.1) 181(37.2) 208(45.5) 180(39.4) 2010–2015 582(34.4) 180(37.1) 148(32.4) 163(35.7) 2016–2020 230(13.6) 125(25.7) 101(22.1) 114(24.9) Histology type < 0.001 0.736 Squamous 1068(63.2) 8009(82.1) 359(78.6) 345(75.5) Adenocarcinoma 258(15.3) 287(2.9) 50(10.9) 59(12.9) Adenosquamous 131(7.7) 803(8.2) 26(5.7) 29(6.3) Other pathology 233(13.8) 25(5.1) 22(4.8) 24(5.3) Tumor size < 0.001 0.974 ≤ 2 cm 334(19.7) 59(12.1) 56(12.3) 59(12.9) >2 ≤ 4 cm 726(43.0) 159(32.7) 165(36.1) 159(34.8) >4 cm 486(28.8) 168(34.6) 166(36.3) 167(36.5) Unknown 144(8.5) 100(20.6) 70(15.3) 72(15.8) Primary tumor < 0.001 0.341 T1b1 324(19.2) 80(16.5) 62(13.6) 70(15.3) T1b2 639(37.8) 154(31.7) 147(32.2) 149(32.6) T1b3 359(21.2) 125(25.7) 129(28.2) 124(27.2) T1bNOS 103(6.1) 53(10.9) 52(11.4) 44(9.6) T2a1 118(7.0) 12(2.5) 22(4.8) 12(2.6) T2a2 127(7.5) 43(8.8) 37(8.1) 43(9.4) T2aNOS 20(1.2) 19(3.9) 8(1.7) 15(3.3) Primary surgery modality With ovary resection 550(32.5) 0 176(38.5) 0 Without ovary resection 96(5.7) 0 45(9.8) 0 Unknown 1044(61.8) 0 236(51.6) 0 Primary radiation modality With brachytherapy 0 291(59.9) 0 271(59.3) Without brachytherapy 0 195(40.1) 0 186(40.7) Survival outcome After primary treatment, 82.8% (1399/1690) of patients in the primary surgery group received further adjuvant radiation to reduce the risk of recurrence, and 12.6% (61/486) patients in the primary radiation group received subsequent hysterectomy.

( A B C D Discussion Principal findings of the study This is the first study to investigate the effect of different primary treatment modalities on FIGO stage IIIC1 cervical cancer without parametrial invasion. The results showed that primary surgery was associated with a better survival prognosis than primary radiation in this population. Results Concurrent chemoradiation is recommended as the standard treatment choice for stages IB3, II, III, and IVA disease based on the results of randomized clinical trials [ 12 14 15 Clinical implications Approximately 85% of newly diagnosed cases occur in developing countries, where cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women [ 16 17 Also, there are controversial on the safety of the treatment modality of primary surgery and adjuvant adjuvant. A previous study compared radical hysterectomy and lymph node dissection and radical radiation alone in patients with clinical early-stage disease (stage IB–IIA) regardless of the pelvic lymph node status. The patients who had one of the following factors received adjuvant radiation: pathologic T2b or greater, positive margin, or lymph node metastasis. The identical outcomes were observed between patients who received radiation or surgery combined with (or without) adjuvant radiation. However, higher rates of complication were noted in patients who received the combined treatment modality [ 18 19 In patients receiving primary radiation, a total dose of 80 Gy for small cervical tumors or ≥ 85 Gy for larger tumors is needed through combined external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. Even in small tumors (IA1 or IA2), doses of 75–80 Gy are needed. Grossly involved unresected nodes may receive a boost of 10–15 Gy with highly conformal EBRT [ 10 19 For cervical adenocarcinoma not related to HPV, like gastric type or clear cell carcinoma, surgery combined with radiation and chemotherapy may be more effective. Gastric-type adenocarcinoma, for example, often has a high rate of TP53 mutant type, making it less responsive to treatment and leading to a poor prognosis. In patients with gastric type adenocarcinoma and resectable pelvic and abdominal metastases, cytoreductive surgery to remove visible lesions as much as possible, and followed by postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy may further improve the prognosis [ 20 22 Strengths and limitations Also, there are some limitations in our study. First, as the SEER database did not document the recurrence pattern of patients, the relationship between different treatment modalities and the recurrence pattern could not be evaluated, further studies are needed for this topic. Second, the presence of a short axis greater than 1 cm and central necrosis within the lymph node serve as imaging criteria for identifying lymph node metastasis. The volume of metastatic lymph nodes not only impacts the effectiveness of radiation therapy but also influences the complexity of surgical procedures. The surgical approach affects the prognosis of stages IA1-IIA2 patients. Laparoscopic radical hysterectomy has a longer operative time but lower blood loss compared to abdominal radical hysterectomy. However, the LACC study in 2018 found that minimally invasive surgery had higher rates of recurrence and death compared to open surgery [ 23 Conclusion In conclusion, this study shows that in patients with stage IIIC1 cervical cancer and without parametrial invasion, primary surgery could further improve the survival outcome than primary radiation. No differences were found in the non-cancer-related survival of primary surgery or radiation between the two treatment modalities. There is still a possibility to further improve the survival of this population and bring a better management modality to this population.
