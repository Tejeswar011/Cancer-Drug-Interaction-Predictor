The intensifying interaction between humans and rodent populations, fuelled by urbanization, climate change, and global trade, has amplified the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. This review compiles and examines current knowledge on key rodent-borne bacterial diseases, including leptospirosis, rat-bite fever, plague, salmonellosis, tularemia, Lyme disease, rickettsioses, Babesiosis, and associated parasitic infections such as toxoplasmosis and Chagas disease. Each disease is analyzed in terms of its etiology, transmission, clinical manifestations, diagnostic tools, and treatment options, with a particular focus on the impact of environmental changes.

Introduction Rodents (order: Rodentia) are among the most prolific and adaptable mammalian species, thriving in nearly all environments, including densely populated urban areas. Their ubiquitous presence and close association with human settlements make them critical contributors to the ecology of zoonotic diseases. As reservoirs and vectors of a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites, rodents pose a persistent and often underestimated threat to global health [ 1 Rodent-borne bacterial infections, such as leptospirosis, rat-bite fever, plague, salmonellosis, tularemia, and Lyme disease, have re-emerged in recent years, driven by climatic fluctuations, ecological disruptions, and increased human encroachment into natural habitats [ 2 3 Rodents, the most significant order of mammals, comprising over 2200 recognized species, account for approximately 42% of global mammalian diversity [ 4 5 6 3 7 This review examines the epidemiology, transmission dynamics, diagnosis, and control of rodent-borne pathogens, providing a comprehensive synthesis of current knowledge on this topic. Special attention is given to the impact of climate change on pathogen prevalence and distribution, emphasizing the urgency of adopting integrated One Health strategies. Recognizing the hidden threat posed by rodent-borne zoonoses is essential for mitigating their impact and safeguarding both human and animal populations. 2. Leptospirosis 2.1. Etiology Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial disease with a worldwide distribution, affecting approximately 1 million people and causing around 60,000 deaths annually [ 8 8 Morphologically, leptospires are thin, flexible, Gram-negative, motile bacteria, with one or both ends shaped like a hook, giving them a characteristic question-mark appearance [ 9 Leptospira Leptospira Leptospira interrogans Leptospira kirschneri Leptospira borgpetersenii Leptospira noguchii 10 11 12 2.2. Epidemiology Rodents are most frequently infected by Leptospira interrogans L. borgpetersenii L. kirschneri L. broomii L santarosai 13 14 15 16 16 Leptospira Leptospira 17 Leptospira Leptospira 18 19 20 21 22 2.3. Clinical Signs The incubation period for leptospirosis typically ranges from 7 to 14 days, though it can vary between 2 and 30 days. The majority (approximately 90%) of human infections are either asymptomatic or present with mild flu-like symptoms. However, severe forms can occur, potentially leading to life-threatening complications such as pulmonary hemorrhage, liver and kidney failure (Weil’s disease), as well as meningitis, pancreatitis, or encephalitis [ 18 18 Figure 1 23 24 24 25 26 2.4. Diagnosis Diagnosis of leptospirosis can be made through direct pathogen detection, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based identification of pathogenic Leptospira Leptospira 27 Leptospira 2.5. Treatment, Prevention, and Control Symptomatic leptospirosis is treated with antibiotics as early as possible, as the bacteria generally respond well to antimicrobial therapy. Effective antibiotics include tetracyclines, β-lactams, and macrolides, particularly azalides [ 28 Leptospirosis is a disease closely linked to the concept of One Health, so environmental balance is fundamental to understanding the disease dynamics. In this sense, reports indicate that climate change will lead to drastic changes in global ecosystems with unpredictable and incalculable impacts. Based on the disease dynamics, the intensification of events related to rainfall and floods is a critical point for the increase in leptospirosis cases [ 29 Commercially available vaccines are composed of whole inactivated Leptospira 30 31 2.6. Recommendations Given the complex epidemiology and environmental persistence of leptospirosis, a comprehensive, integrated approach (replaced “comprehensive and integrated” → “comprehensive, integrated” for conciseness) is essential for effective prevention and control. The author recommends implementing One Health strategies that acknowledge the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. The author recommends implementing One Health strategies that acknowledge the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. This includes controlling rodent populations, especially in urban and peri-urban areas, by reducing access to food sources, sealing entry points, and effectively managing waste and sanitation. Public education campaigns are crucial for raising awareness about risk factors, such as exposure to contaminated water or soil, and for promoting protective behaviors, like wearing boots and gloves in flood-prone or high-risk areas. In endemic regions, early diagnosis using rapid molecular techniques, such as PCR, should be prioritized to improve clinical outcomes. Timely antibiotic treatment remains a key tool in managing infections. Where available, vaccines may be considered for high-risk groups; however, their limitations, including serovar-specific protection and potential side effects, must be taken into account. Finally, given the strong link between climate events (e.g., heavy rainfall and flooding) and outbreaks, climate adaptation strategies should be integrated into public health planning to anticipate and mitigate future spikes in leptospirosis incidence. 3. Rat-Bite Fever 3.1. Etiology Rat-bite fever (RBF) is a systemic infectious disease primarily caused by two bacterial species: Streptobacillus moniliformis Spirillum minus 32 Spirillum S. moniliformis 33 34 Streptobacillus S. notomytis Rattus rattus S. felis 35 36 Rats harbor S. moniliformis 37 Mus musculus S. moniliformis 38 3.2. Epidemiology The prevalence of S. moniliformis 33 39 In Germany, it is estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 bite wounds are treated each year, with bites from dogs and cats being the most common. Less than 10% of these injuries are caused by rodents such as rats, hamsters, and rabbits. Notably, 59% of the affected individuals are children or adolescents [ 40 40 S. moniliformis High-risk groups include veterinarians, animal caretakers, sewer workers, farmers, and homeless individuals. Additionally, due to the increasing popularity of pet rats, children are at an elevated risk [ 41 42 43 43 Figure 2 43 43 3.3. Clinical Aspects The incubation period for S. moniliformis 44 45 44 45 31 32 44 45 A foodborne variant known as Haverhill fever ( Erythema arthriticum epidemicum 46 In laboratory mice infected with S. moniliformis 47 S. moniliformis Macaca mullata Callicebus 48 3.4. Diagnosis The PCR technique can be used to detect S. moniliformis 32 S. moniliformis 49 50 51 S. minus 51 3.5. Treatment, Prevention, and Control When diagnosed promptly, RBF can typically be treated without complications. The preferred antibiotics for this condition include penicillin, doxycycline, or ceftriaxone, which can be administered either orally or intravenously [ 52 53 54 55 34 3.6. Recommendations To prevent Rat-Bite Fever, the author recommends raising awareness, particularly among high-risk groups, including veterinarians, pet owners, and individuals exposed to rodents. Individuals should avoid direct contact with rats’ saliva, urine, or feces and use protective gloves when handling rodents or cleaning cages. Children should be supervised around pet rats to prevent bites or close face contact. Pet stores and breeders should screen rats for Streptobacillus moniliformis 4. Yersinia pestis Human plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis 56 57 4.1. Etiology Y. pestis 58 Indeed, Y. pestis Yersinia Yersinia enterocolitica Yersinia pseudotuberculosis 59 Y. enterocolitica 60 Y. enterocolitica 61 Y. pseudotuberculosis Y. enterocolitica 62 62 Y. pseudotuberculosis 4.2. Epidemiology Plague has a global distribution, with the three most endemic countries being Madagascar, Congo, Uganda, Peru, Tanzania, and the United States [ 63 Yersinia pestis 64 65 66 66 67 48 50 51 Argasidae Gamasidae Ixodidae Anoplura Heteroptera 65 Figure 3 By the end of 2021, there were 12 types of natural plague foci in the mainland of China, located in 322 county-level divisions of 19 provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs), covering a total of 1,587,666.67 square kilometers. Between 2002 and 2021, plague epizootics or positive indications were identified for 12 types of natural plague foci in 196 county-level divisions of 16 PLADs [ 68 69 The plague can be transmitted from a patient with pneumonic plague to other individuals through droplet transmission [ 70 71 72 73 74 75 In the next century, the combination of climate change and anthropogenic activities is expected to result in a significant increase in pathogen spillover and the emergence of zoonotic diseases [ 76 77 78 79 80 Y. pestis 4.3. Clinical Signs In 1940, G. P. Rudnev [ 81 82 i. Septicemic Plague: Clinically, the septicemic form of plague, caused by Y. pestis 83 ii. Pneumonic Plague: The pneumonic form has an incubation period of 1 to 3 days. Primary pneumonic plague is a rare but highly lethal form of the disease, mainly transmitted through droplets and aerosols via close contact (within 2 to 5 feet) with infected individuals. This form of the disease progresses rapidly from a febrile illness to severe pneumonia, producing cough and bloody sputum [ 84 iii. Bubonic Plague: Bubonic plague is the most frequent clinical form, occurring 2 to 10 days after inoculation with Y. pestis 85 74 74 86 In dogs, clinical signs may include fever, lethargy, anorexia, lymphadenopathy, vomiting, diarrhea, and abscesses [ 87 88 4.4. Diagnosis The diagnosis of the disease requires laboratory confirmation, with the best method being a sample of pus from a bubo, blood, or sputum. Among the diagnostic methods, the rapid diagnostic test (RDT), which aims to detect the F1 antigen of Y. Pestis 89 The use of molecular tests, developed to ensure greater accuracy of results, such as conventional PCR, aims to amplify the genes pla, caf1, inv, and yopM [ 90 91 92 93 The standard test for Y. pestis Y. pestis Y. pestis 94 4.5. Treatment, Prevention, and Control The recommended treatment includes the use of streptomycin or gentamicin in adult patients, including those who are immunocompromised and pregnant women. These drugs can be administered to children at a reduced dose. Alternatively, the combination of doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, and chloramphenicol can also be used for adults and children [ 95 Preventive measures include informing people when zoonotic plague is present in their environment and advising them to take precautions against flea bites and avoid handling animal carcasses. Generally, people should be advised to avoid direct contact with infected body fluids and tissues. When handling potentially infected patients and collecting specimens, standard precautions should be applied. Surveillance and control require investigating the animal and flea species implicated in the plague cycle in the region and developing environmental management programs to understand the natural zoonotic cycle of the disease and limit its spread. Active long-term surveillance of animal foci, coupled with a rapid response during animal outbreaks, has successfully reduced the number of human plague outbreaks. To effectively and efficiently manage plague outbreaks, it is crucial to have an informed and vigilant health care workforce (and community) to quickly diagnose and manage patients with infection, to identify risk factors, to conduct ongoing surveillance, to control vectors and hosts, to confirm diagnosis with laboratory tests, and to communicate findings with appropriate authorities [ 57 Plague vaccines have been in existence for over a century. First-generation vaccines, while potentially effective, are limited by high rates of reactogenicity [ 96 97 98 99 100 4.6. Recommendations In areas with confirmed or suspected cases of zoonotic plague, it is essential to raise public awareness about the presence of the disease in the environment. People should avoid handling animal carcasses and any contact with potentially contaminated tissues or body fluids. When in or near forests or tall vegetation, individuals should minimize exposure by avoiding direct contact with the vegetation and wearing long-sleeved, light-colored clothing that fully covers the feet, ankles, and legs. The use of insect repellents containing DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) and thymol is recommended, as well as the use of citrus-scented essential oils around the home to help deter fleas. Pet care is also crucial—dogs should be taken to the vet regularly, and all pets should be kept up to date on deworming treatments. To reduce the rodent population, avoid accumulating garbage, especially materials like cardboard and old magazines. Lastly, avoid contact with wild rodents to further reduce the risk of exposure to the plague. 5. Salmonella 5.1. Etiology Approximately 1 million people worldwide contract salmonellosis each year, resulting in 60,000 deaths [ 101 102 103 104 105 106 Salmonella Salmonella Typhi Salmonella Paratyphi 107 Salmonella Typhimurium Enteritidis 108 S. enterica 109 110 The genus Salmonella S. enterica S. bongori S. enterica S. Typhi S. Paratyphi Salmonella S. Typhimurium S. Enteritidis S. Heidelberg S. Newport S. Dublin S. Infantis S. Agona S. Javiana 107 108 109 111 5.2. Epidemiology The main reservoir of Salmonella 112 Mus musculus Salmonella 113 Rattus rattus S. Enteritidis 114 115 Rattus rattus Rattus norvegicus Mus musculus domesticus Salmonella 115 116 117 118 The Typhimurium serotype is frequently isolated from captive and wild rodents, with intermittent fecal excretion lasting from weeks to months [ 119 120 121 122 123 124 Salmonella 125 Salmonella Typhimurium 126 Salmonella Typhimurium S. enterica 125 Salmonella Salmonella Typhimurium S. Weltevreden 127 Salmonella S. Enteritidis S. Typhimurium 124 Rodents can significantly amplify Salmonella Salmonella Salmonellae Figure 4 Salmonella Salmonella Salmonella 128 Like other zoonotic diseases, the increase in salmonellosis is related to rising temperatures [ 128 129 130 Salmonella 131 132 5.3. Clinical Signs In humans, salmonellosis can cause symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and headache [ 112 Salmonella 128 Salmonella 128 Non-typhoidal Salmonella 133 134 Salmonella S. Typhi S. Paratyphi 133 135 136 137 In cattle, Salmonella 138 139 140 141 Salmonella 142 5.4. Diagnosis One of the diagnostic methods used for Salmonella Salmonella 143 Salmonella 144 145 146 147 148 5.5. Treatment, Prevention, and Control In the setting of NTS bacteremia or disseminated disease, initial therapy should be with third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone, for at least 7 to 10 days. Once bacterial susceptibilities are known, antibiotic treatment can be transitioned to azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. For enteric fever, the antibiotic treatment of choice is a fluoroquinolone. In cases of resistance, alternative antibiotics, such as third-generation cephalosporins and azithromycin, are recommended as an alternative. Fluoroquinolones are not used as frequently in children as they are in adults, and alternatives such as azithromycin are often preferred. The typical treatment duration is 10 to 14 days. In cases of severe enteric fever with symptoms of delirium, obtundation, stupor, or shock, additional treatment with corticosteroids may be considered. Dexamethasone at a dose of 3 mg/kg, followed by 1 mg/kg every 6 h for 48 h, has been shown to reduce mortality [ 149 Prevention requires control measures at all stages of the food chain, from agricultural production to processing, manufacturing, and preparation of foods in both commercial establishments and at home. Preventive measures for Salmonella Salmonella 128 Wild rodents can act as hosts for a variety of pathogens and transmit them to other farm animals through their feces, which can contaminate food and water throughout the farm. Therefore, frequent disinfection is required [ 150 151 Only licensed vaccines are available against S. Typhi S. Typhi S. Paratyphi S. Paratyphi 152 153 S. Typhi S. Typhi 154 5.6. Recommendations To prevent rodent infestation and related health risks, it is crucial to eliminate factors that encourage their presence and reproduction. This includes maintaining clean and organized environments, avoiding the accumulation of garbage and debris, storing food in airtight containers, and sealing any cracks, holes, or other access points. Garbage should be collected regularly at the regional level, and food must be stored safely, with no leftovers left exposed. Areas that are not frequently visited should be cleaned routinely. Additionally, practicing proper hygiene is essential: wash hands thoroughly, especially before handling food and after using the bathroom, and ensure kitchen utensils are cleaned adequately before food preparation. Safe food and water practices must also be followed. Only drink filtered or boiled water. Avoid consuming raw or undercooked meat. Ensure eggs are well-cooked, and drink only pasteurized or boiled milk. 6. Francisella Tularemia Francisella tularensis 155 6.1. Etiology Tularemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease caused by Francisella tularensis 156 The bacterium is classified into two types: Type A (subsp. tularensis), associated with a terrestrial transmission cycle and found throughout North America, and Type B (Subsp. holarctica 157 158 159 Francisella tularensis Tularemia Francisella tularensis holarctica 155 Francisella https://lpsn.dsmz.de/search?word=Francisella 6.2. Epidemiology Rodents and lagomorphs are maintenance hosts of F. tularensis 160 161 F. tularensis 162 F. tularensis Microtus agrestis 163 Arvicola terrestris Microtus arvalis Rattus rattus Arvicola terrestris Mus musculus Lepus Sylvilagus 164 Rabbits, hares, and rodents are especially susceptible and often die in large numbers during outbreaks [ 154 154 Tularemia 165 166 Figure 5 It is essential to strengthen scientific and research capacity on climate change and health to provide a more accurate assessment of the impact of climate change on vector- and rodent-borne infectious diseases, particularly in the context of One Health [ 167 6.3. Clinical Signs In sensitive animals, clinical signs of severe depression can be observed, followed by a fatal septicaemia. The disease lasts from 2–10 days, and affected animals die within a few days. Most domestic species do not usually manifest signs of tularemia infection, but they do develop specific antibodies against the bacteria. Outbreaks with high mortality caused by the Type A organism have occurred in sheep. Among domestic pets, F. tularensis 155 The first human case of tularemia was confirmed in 1914 in a patient presenting with ocular inflammation, characterized by ulcers and swelling of the eyelid, which progressed to enlarged lymph nodes, abscesses, and hyperemia [ 168 In humans, clinical manifestations are divided into forms, including ulceroglandular, glandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal, respiratory, and typhoidal [ 157 169 A prevalent form is oropharyngeal tularemia, resulting from the ingestion of contaminated water [ 156 166 157 170 171 170 In dogs, clinical signs such as lethargy, pyrexia, anorexia, and lymphadenopathy may occur [ 172 173 174 175 6.4. Diagnosis Diagnostic methods include serology, culture, and PCR from clinical samples [ 170 176 177 F. tularensis 170 176 177 6.5. Treatment, Prevention, and Control The treatment of choice for tularemia includes aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and fluoroquinolones. However, this treatment was primarily developed to address emergencies in the context of bioterrorism. Intravenous (IV) gentamicin is recommended for 7 to 14 days, depending on the severity of the disease, as the most effective treatment [ 178 179 180 181 182 To prevent tularemia, it is essential to minimize exposure to ticks, deer flies, and potentially infected animals. When spending time outdoors, such as hiking, camping, or working in nature, individuals should use insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD), or 2-undecanone. Wearing long pants, long sleeves, and high socks helps protect the skin from insect bites. Any attached ticks should be promptly removed using fine-tipped tweezers. Drinking untreated surface water should also be avoided. During mowing or landscaping, it is essential not to mow over sick or dead animals. Checking the area beforehand can help reduce this risk. Although not yet formally studied, wearing masks while mowing may lower the risk of inhaling bacteria. For those who hunt, trap, or handle animals, particularly rabbits, muskrats, prairie dogs, and other rodents, wearing gloves is recommended. Game meat should always be cooked thoroughly before consumption [ 183 In the 1960s, a live vaccine strain (LVS) Francisella F. holarctica 184 F. tularensis. 185 Francisella 185 6.6. Recommendations In endemic areas, individuals should protect themselves by using insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD), or 2-undecanone. When entering wildlife areas, it is essential to wear light-colored, long clothing that fully covers the legs and arms to reduce exposure to ticks and other vectors. After engaging in outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, or trekking, individuals should carefully inspect their bodies for ticks. Gardeners should wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), and all individuals should avoid contact with animal carcasses. Garbage should be collected regularly, and food scraps should not be left exposed; food must be stored in safe places. Unfrequented areas should be cleaned routinely to prevent the accumulation of vegetation and debris that could provide shelter for animals such as rodents. Hunters, especially in endemic areas, must use PPE such as rubber gloves and face masks when handling rabbits, hares, and rodents, and should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water afterward. Wild animal and game meat must be thoroughly cooked before consumption. Additionally, people should avoid drinking untreated water from lakes and rivers and must ensure vegetables are properly washed before eating. 7. Borrelia Lyme disease is a bacterial illness transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. The disease is caused by bacteria in the family Borreliaceae, particularly Borrelia (Borreliella) burgdorferi Ixodes ricinus I. persulcatus 186 7.1. Etiology Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere [ 187 188 Borrelia burgdorferi B. burgdorferi B. afzelii B. burgdorferi B. garinii B. valaisiana 189 190 191 7.2. Epidemiology Approximately 476,000 cases are reported annually in the United States due to B. burgdorferi 192 187 Ixodes 193 Ixodes ricinus B. burgdorferi 194 Ixodes scapularis 195 196 Ixodes persulcatus Ixodes pacificus 197 Peromyscus leucopus 198 199 200 Ticks carrying pathogenic strains of B. burgdorferi 201 202 203 202 204 Figure 6 The enzootic cycle of Lyme borreliosis involves Ixodes Borrelia burgdorferi Notably, climate change is expected to accelerate the spread of LB, making it crucial to implement preventive measures, including epidemiological and molecular surveillance, as well as promoting health education to the general public [ 205 7.3. Clinical Signs In humans, the disease has an incubation period of 3 to 30 days [ 206 207 208 In animals, clinical signs are barely noticeable [ 209 210 Peromyscus leucopus 210 211 In dogs, lameness may be observed, often with associated hyperemia and anorexia. Arthritis commonly occurs in a single joint, most often in the carpus or tarsus [ 212 213 7.4. Diagnosis According to CDC guidelines, a two-step testing process should be adopted for serological testing for Lyme disease. Both steps are required and can be done using the same blood sample. If this first step is negative, no further testing is necessary. However, if the first step yields a positive or indeterminate result (sometimes referred to as “equivocal”), the second step should be performed. The final result is only positive when the first test is positive (or equivocal) and the second test is positive (or, for some tests, equivocal). Standard two-tier testing (STTT) employs enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as the initial step and Western blotting (WB) as the second step. Increasingly, laboratories are using modified two-tier testing (MTTT) in which both assays are EIAs [ 214 7.5. Treatment, Prevention, and Control Prevention of Lyme borreliosis following a tick bite has been reported using a single dose of doxycycline [ 215 216 The primary methods of preventing infection are avoiding tick bites and promptly removing attached ticks. The most effective tick-bite avoidance strategies include wearing protective clothing, like long trousers and long-sleeved shirts, and using tick repellents. The skin should be checked periodically for attached ticks, which should be removed using tweezers or fine-pointed forceps. For safe removal, grasp the tick as closely as possible to the skin, pulling gently upwards and trying not to break off the mouthparts. The risk of borrelial infection is not increased if the tick’s mouth parts are left behind. It is recommended to use a skin disinfectant after tick removal to prevent pyogenic infection. When searching for attached ticks, pay particular attention to skin folds, the groin area, armpits, under the breasts, the waistband area, and the backs of the knees, as ticks tend to seek out more humid areas for attachment. In children, the head, including the scalp, and neck should be carefully checked, as tick bites are relatively more common in these areas in this age group. An effective preventive measure for individuals with intense tick exposure, such as forestry workers, rural workers, or military personnel on active duty, is the use of permethrin-impregnated clothing [ 204 Targeting ticks on mice with acaricides has also been used, either by using bait boxes that coat mice as they enter a feeder, nesting material impregnated with an acaricide that transfers the agent to the fur of mice in the nest, or oral feeding with baits containing acaricides [ 217 Currently, there is no vaccine available for humans against Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis [ 218 219 7.6. Recommendations To prevent exposure to rodents and ticks, it is essential to implement preventive rodent control measures, such as avoiding the accumulation of garbage and debris, storing food in tightly sealed containers, and installing metal screens on air and sewage inlets. People should avoid areas where ticks may be present, such as lawns, forests, and wildlife habitats. The use of effective tick repellents is highly recommended. In endemic regions, individuals should apply insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD), or 2-undecanone, and wear light-colored, long clothing that fully covers the legs and arms when entering wildlife areas. After potential exposure to ticks, such as visiting tick-infested environments, individuals should promptly remove their clothing, wash it, take a shower, and carefully inspect their body, especially hairy areas, for ticks. If a tick is found, it should be removed using fine-tipped tweezers, gripping it at the head or mouth parts close to the skin and pulling it out slowly. Ticks should never be handled with bare or unprotected hands. When hiking or trekking, it is also advised to avoid sitting on the ground, vegetation, or rocks, and to stay on designated paths and trails to minimize contact with ticks. 8. Rickettsia Rickettsiae are intracellular bacteria responsible for causing vector-borne zoonotic diseases worldwide [ 220 221 Rickettsiae 222 8.1. Etiology Rickettsioses (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) are diseases that severely impact public health, caused by intracellular, Gram-negative bacteria transmitted by ticks, performing enzootic or epizootic cycles in wild vertebrate hosts [ 223 224 220 225 226 8.2. Epidemiology Regardless of the length of travel (short- or long-term), all age groups are at risk for rickettsial infections during visits to endemic areas. Transmission risk increases with the time spent participating in outdoor activities, particularly during seasons when the vector is at its peak in terms of feeding and lifecycle activity. In many parts of the world, however, rickettsial infections occur year-round. The most commonly diagnosed rickettsial diseases in travelers belong to the spotted fever or typhus groups; notably, rickettsial infections can also be caused by emerging and newly recognized species [ 227 Rickettsia Table 1 Most rickettsial pathogens are transmitted directly to humans by infected arthropod vectors (i.e., fleas, lice, mites, or ticks) during feeding. In addition, pathogens can also be transmitted when a person accidentally inoculates Rickettsiae into the arthropod bite wound (or other breaks in the skin); this transmission can occur by scratching skin contaminated with infectious arthropod fluids or feces, or by crushing the arthropod vector at the bite site. Another possible transmission route is through inhalation of Rickettsiae or inoculation of the conjunctiva with infectious material. While possible, transmission of some rickettsiae through transfusion of infected blood products or organ transplants is less common, especially Anaplasma Ehrlichia 227 Figure 7 The impact of climate change on vector-borne and rodent-borne infectious diseases is essential [ 167 220 238 239 8.3. Clinical Signs Several Rickettsia R. conorii 240 R. rickettsii 231 Rickettsia japonica 234 R. africae 241 R. conorii 240 In a study evaluating clinically ill cats for evidence of rickettsial infection, no association was found between antibody positivity and fever, and no febrile cats tested positive for R. felis R. rickettsii 242 Rickettsia rickettsi 243 243 244 245 8.4. Diagnosis Methods for diagnosing rickettsial infections include serology, such as indirect immunofluorescence assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for IgM or IgG [ 246 247 8.5. Treatment, Prevention, and Control In infections caused by Rickettsia conorii 240 Rickettsia rickettsii 248 Rickettsia japonica 249 Rickettsia typhi 250 Rickettsia prowazekii 251 Rickettsia akari 248 Rickettsia africae 252 There is no vaccine available to prevent rickettsial infections. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for rickettsiae, and antimicrobial agents should not be given to asymptomatic individuals. Travelers to areas endemic for rickettsiae should seek to minimize their exposure to infectious arthropods (including fleas, lice, mites, and ticks) and avoid animal reservoirs (particularly dogs and rats) [ 227 It is not necessary to exclude individuals with rickettsial infections from daycare, preschool, school, or the workplace. It is recommended that long-sleeved protective clothing and a wide-brimmed hat be worn to reduce the risk of infection when engaging in activities where human contact with ticks, lice, mites, or fleas may occur, such as hiking and camping in areas where these pests are present. It is also recommended that you use insect repellent containing DEET or picaridin and examine your skin for possible bites (especially behind the ears, on the back of the head, in the groin, armpits, and behind the knees) [ 253 The first whole-cell antigen (WCA) vaccines against R. prowazekii R. rickettsii 254 255 R. prowazekii 255 256 R. rickettsii 257 258 259 260 261 O. tsutsugamushi 262 8.6. Recommendations In endemic areas, integrated pest control is crucial for disease prevention. It should involve a thorough environmental assessment, the use of physical barriers, controlled chemical applications, continuous monitoring, and community-based environmental education. Keeping pets dewormed is an essential preventive measure. Individuals in these regions should use insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), para-menthane-diol (PMD), or 2-undecanone, especially when entering areas with wildlife. It is also advisable to wear light-colored, long-sleeved clothing that covers the legs and arms. During outdoor activities such as hiking or camping, individuals should stay on safe trails and avoid contact with potentially infested environments. Hunters, particularly in endemic regions, must use personal protective equipment (PPE), such as rubber gloves and face masks, when handling animals like rabbits, hares, and rodents. They should then wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water to minimize the risk of infection. 9. Future Research We must understand that rodent-borne diseases are fully embedded in the context of One Health ( Figure 8 4 263 10. General Recommendations To efficiently manage rodent-borne zoonotic illnesses, the following priorities are recommended: 1. Public Health and Prevention − Awareness Campaigns: Educate communities endemic for rodents and rodent-borne diseases on rodent-borne illnesses, transmission, and preventive measures. − Personal Protection: Promote the utilization of protective equipment, insect repellents (e.g., DEET, picaridin), and proper hygiene measures. − Rodent Control: Employ integrated pest management (IPM) practices, such as sanitation, rodent-proofing buildings, and secure waste disposal. − Vector Control: Regulate tick and flea populations through environmental management, acaricides, and treatment of pets. 2. Health care and Diagnostics − Early Diagnosis: Enhance laboratory infrastructure to achieve early diagnosis of zoonotic pathogens using molecular (PCR) and serological diagnostic methods. − Antibiotic Stewardship: Support proper use of antimicrobials to prevent resistance, particularly in leptospirosis and rat-bite fever. − Vaccination Research: Develop vaccine research for high-mortality diseases like plague and tularemia. 3. Environmental and One Health Strategies − Climate Adaptation: Monitor climate-driven fluctuations in rodent and vector populations for predicting disease outbreaks. − Ecosystem Management: Re-establish ecosystems to minimize human-rodent interaction and maintain biodiversity. − Wildlife Surveillance: Regularly monitor rodent and arthropod populations in high-risk zones. 4. Policy and Global Coordination − International Reporting: Improve international surveillance networks for prompt reporting of zoonotic outbreaks. − Regulatory Measures: Enact stricter rodent trade, pet keeping, and food hygiene regulations to minimize risks of transmission. − One Health Frameworks: Promote interspecies collaboration among veterinarians, ecologists, and public health professionals to respond to zoonotic threats integratively. 11. Conclusions Rodents play a significant but often underrecognized role in the emergence and transmission of zoonotic bacterial infections. Due to their ability to adapt to diverse habitats, including cities, they coexist closely with human and domestic animal populations. This review highlights the major public health threats posed by rodent-borne pathogens, including Leptospira Streptobacillus moniliformis Yersinia pestis Salmonella Francisella tularensis Borrelia burgdorferi Rickettsia Acknowledgments This article has been registered in the Research Proposal Registration of the Coordination of Scientific Integrity and Surveillance of Universidad Cientifica del Sur, Lima, Peru, under the number PI-50-2025-0792.
