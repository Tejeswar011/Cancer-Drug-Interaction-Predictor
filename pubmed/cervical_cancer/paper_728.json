Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial endotoxin, is a well-established trigger of ALI. Emerging evidence suggests that heparin derivatives may attenuate lung injury, but their mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: This study evaluated the protective effects of 2-O, 3-O desulfated heparin (ODSH) in a murine model of LPS-induced ALI. Mice received LPS intratracheally with or without ODSH pre-treatment. Lung injury was assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) analysis, Evans blue dye albumin EBDA) extravasation, and histopathology. Results: ODSH treatment significantly reduced BALF protein concentration, inflammatory cell infiltration, and EBDA leakage. ODSH preserved endothelial barrier function in vitro, as evidenced by transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) measurements in human lung microvascular endothelial cell (HLMVEC) monolayers. Histological assessment (H&E staining) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) staining demonstrated reduced lung injury and neutrophil infiltration in the ODSH group. ODSH also downregulated pro-inflammatory mediators (NF-κB, IL-6, p38 MAPK) and upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Conclusions: ODSH mitigates LPS-induced ALI by reducing vascular permeability, neutrophilic inflammation, and pro-inflammatory signaling while enhancing IL-10 expression. These findings suggest ODSH may offer a novel therapeutic approach for treating ALI.

Introduction Acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can occur in critically ill patients and are characterized by widespread inflammation and pulmonary permeability edema. Patients become hypoxic and require mechanical ventilation for breathing support. ARDS has many possible causes, both of direct and indirect origin, including severe pneumonia and sepsis, respectively. Although more people are surviving ARDS now than in the past due to improved supportive management and care, mortality remains high at 30–50% [ 1 2 Gram-negative (G-) bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa Haemophilus influenzae Klebsiella pneumoniae 3 4 5 4 4 6 7 8 7 9 10 In this study, we evaluated whether the low anticoagulant ODSH can reduce LPS-induced lung vascular leak and inflammation in a well-established murine ALI model. We demonstrate that ODSH pre-treatment mitigates LPS-induced lung injury in mice. The protective ODSH effects correlate with increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and with decreased generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (GM-CSF, KC, IL-6, and IL-1α) after LPS insult. We moreover show that ODSH restores the levels of IL-9, IL-15, and IL-17 after LPS treatment, all of which were suggested to participate in immune defense and in the maintenance of lung homeostasis. In correlation with these results, ODSH attenuates upregulation of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory signaling pathways (p38 expression and NF-κB phosphorylation). In summary, our data suggested that ODSH protective effects against LPS-induced ALI in mice are at least partially attributed to the upregulation of anti-inflammatory IL-10 with concomitant suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated signaling. These data may pave the way to the development of clinically relevant novel therapeutic candidates for acute lung injury. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Chemicals and Reagents Unless specified otherwise, all chemicals were sourced from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). LPS derived from Escherichia coli 2.2. Transendothelial Electrical Resistance Measurement Human Lung Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HLMVECs) were obtained from Lonza Bioscience (Allandale, NJ, USA). Transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) was monitored in real time by using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing system (ECIS-zeta, Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY, USA). To measure TER, HLMVEC monolayers, 6 × 10 4 2.3. Animal Experiments All experimental procedures adhered to the Animal Welfare Act and received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Augusta University (IACUC protocol is 2011-0392. The latest approval date is 19 January 2024). CD-1 mice (8–12 weeks old, 20–25 g, n = 4) were procured from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA). Animals were housed in plastic cages with unrestricted access to food and water. Environmental conditions were maintained at room temperature under a controlled 12 h light/dark cycle. 2.4. Animal Surgical Procedure Mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (150 mg/kg body weight) and acepromazine (15 mg/kg), followed by surgical exposure of the trachea through cervical and thoracic incisions. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 2 mg/kg in sterile PBS) was administered intratracheally (IT) using a 20-gauge catheter. Compared to aspiration, IT instillation via neck incision offers more consistent and controlled delivery of LPS directly into the lower airways, minimizing variability in dosing and localization. This method also reduces the risk of upper airway irritation and ensures reliable induction of pulmonary inflammation, and hence is incorporated. Fifteen minutes prior to LPS instillation, animals received either vehicle or ODSH (50 mg/kg) via the internal jugular vein (IJV). Here, we chose the IJV route to ensure rapid systemic delivery and consistent therapeutic availability. In contrast, intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ODSH may result in delayed absorption and variable bioavailability. After 22 h of recovery period, anesthesia was re-induced and Evans Blue Dye Albumin (EBDA; 30 mg/kg in 4% bovine serum albumin) was delivered through the IJV. Following a 120 min circulation period, mice were exsanguinated, the thoracic cavity opened, and the lungs flushed with saline/EDTA via the right ventricle. Lung tissue was harvested for downstream analysis. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed by instilling 1 mL of 10% HBSS; resulting lavage fluid (BALF) and lungs were collected for protein quantification and cell counting. Lung tissues were stored at −80 °C. For histological analysis, right lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. 2.5. Lung Histology Lungs were perfused with EDTA to remove blood, then immersed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 18 h to fix the tissue prior to histological assessment using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. For uniformity, right lung lobes were selected. Tissue sections underwent deparaffinization and rehydration prior to staining. Slides were incubated in Harris Hematoxylin for 15 min, followed by Eosin for 30 s. Subsequently, slides were dehydrated, cleared, and mounted using Cytoseal for microscopic evaluation. 2.6. Immunohistochemistry: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) Lung sections of 5 μm thickness were prepared from paraffin-embedded blocks and mounted on pre-treated slides (Superfrost Plus; VWR Scientific Products, Suwanee, GA, USA). Slides were air-dried overnight and then incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. Deparaffinization was performed using two changes of xylene (7 min each), followed by a graded ethanol series: two changes of absolute ethanol (2 min each), two changes of 95% ethanol (2 min), 80% ethanol (2 min), and 70% ethanol (2 min), transitioning finally to distilled water. Antigen retrieval was carried out using Target Retrieval Solution (pH 6.0; Dako Corp, Carpinteria, CA, USA) in a steamer (Black and Decker rice steamer), followed by rinsing in distilled water. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in distilled water for 5 min, then rinsed with distilled water (2 min) and equilibrated in 1 × PBS (5 min). Slides were incubated with primary antibody against myeloperoxidase (1:2000 dilution) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by two rinses in 1 × PBS. Subsequently, sections were treated with a secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated Affinipure F(ab’) 2 2.7. Lung Permeability Measurement Using Evans Blue Dye Albumin To evaluate vascular permeability, Evans Blue Dye Albumin (EBDA; 30 mg/kg) was administered via the right internal jugular vein (IJV) two hours prior to study completion. The blood-free left lung was frozen at −20 °C and weighed. EBDA was extracted by homogenizing the tissue in formamide and incubating for 18 h at 60 °C. Following extraction, samples were centrifuged at 5000× g 2.8. Protein Estimation and Cell Count from the BALF Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was initially centrifuged at 500× g g g 2.9. Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis (RT-qPCR) Total RNA was isolated from mouse lung tissue homogenates using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following standard procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The concentration and purity of the extracted RNA were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Subsequently, 2 µg of total RNA was converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) utilizing the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). Each RT-qPCR assay was conducted in a 20 µL reaction volume using a MicroAmp™ Fast Optical 96-well plate (Applied Biosystems). The reaction setup included 5 µL of cDNA, 10 µL of PowerUp™ SYBR™ Green Master Mix (2×), 3 µL of Nuclease-Free Water, and 2 µL gene-specific primers (1 µL Forward + 1 µL Reverse at 10 µM each final concentration). Amplification was performed using the StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Gene expression levels were assessed for p38, NF-κB, IL-6, and the reference gene GAPDH. Quantification was achieved using the ΔΔCt method, and relative expression changes were determined using the formula: Relative expression = 2 −ΔΔCt Supplementary Table S1 2.10. Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting Following sacrifice, mouse lungs were dissected and homogenized in lysis buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Protein samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using the following primary antibodies: anti-mouse p38 and phospho-p38 (both polyclonal, 1:1000), phospho-NF-κB (polyclonal, 1:1000), anti-mouse β-actin (monoclonal, 1:1000), and IL-6 (monoclonal)—all sourced from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). 2.11. Quantification of Cytokines and Chemokines in BALF Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was initially centrifuged at 500× g 2.12. Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (SEM) from 3 to 5 independent experiments. For multiple group comparisons, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc tests was performed. Differences between two groups were assessed using Student’s t-test. Statistical significance was defined as p 3. Results 3.1. ODSH Treatment Significantly Attenuates LPS-Induced Capillary Leak in a Murine Model of LPS-Induced Acute Lung Injury Elevated microvascular permeability within the lung is a hallmark pathological feature of ALI/ARDS. Mice challenged by intratracheal (IT) instillation of LPS develop lung injury over 24 h [ 11 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 3.2. ODSH Mitigates LPS-Induced Endothelial Permeability in HLMVECs To examine whether ODSH also affects barrier function of confluent HLMVEC monolayers in vitro, we exposed the cells in ECIS chambers to ODSH for 40 min prior to the addition of LPS and we monitored transendothelial resistance (TER) (an inverse index of endothelial permeability) for 15 h. Figure 2 Figure 1 3.3. Histological Evaluation of ODSH Effect on LPS-Induced Lung Inflammation To substantiate the protective role of ODSH treatment in LPS-induced lung injury, we have performed a histological assessment using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining [ 11 12 Figure 3 3.4. Immunohistochemical Analysis of ODSH Effect on LPS-Induced Neutrophil Activation Myeloperoxidase, an enzyme abundantly expressed in neutrophil granulocytes, serves as a biomarker of neutrophil activity. Elevated MPO levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid indicate enhanced infiltration and activation of neutrophils within the pulmonary compartment [ 3 Figure 4 Figure 3 Figure 4 3.5. ODSH Suppresses the Activation of Pro-Inflammatory Signaling Induced by LPS in Murine Lung Tissue To further characterize the effect of ODSH on LPS-induced ALI in mice, we next evaluated the effect of ODSH on inflammation induced by LPS in lung tissue. Mice were challenged with either IT LPS or vehicle 15 min after IJV ODSH, and the level of inflammatory responses (IL-6 and NF-κB /p-NF-κB expressions) was subsequently evaluated by RT-qPCR and western immunoblotting of lung tissue lysates. Figure 5 Figure 6 Activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is a key signaling step in inflammation and is involved in microvascular EC barrier dysfunction [ 13 14 Figure 5 Figure 7 3.6. Effect of LPS and ODSH on the Levels of Cytokines in BALF To examine whether the protective effect of ODSH on lung injury in the LPS-treated mice occurs due to an inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and/or by stimulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, we quantified their levels in the BALF using the multiplex MCYTOMAG-70K assay (Millipore-Sigma). Figure 8 Figure 6 4. Discussion The most aggressive manifestation of Acute lung injury -ARDS- is distinguished by pulmonary permeability edema and capillary barrier dysfunction. LPS, a structural component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, functions as a potent endotoxin that elicits a robust immune response in otherwise healthy animals and which can lead to lung endothelial injury, neutrophilic inflammation, and microvascular thrombi [ 11 15 7 16 17 18 19 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 20 Figure 1 Figure 2 9 10 20 In ALI, increased permeability of pulmonary capillary endothelial cells leads to fluid leakage into the lung parenchyma, often accompanied by neutrophil extravasation and the development of interstitial edema. Neutrophils play a central role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema by releasing cytotoxic mediators that disrupt both endothelial and epithelial barriers, exacerbating tissue injury and inflammation [ 2 21 Figure 3 22 23 Figure 4 24 25 LPS induced a severe immune response, activating the NF-κB and cytokines that activated lymphocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines, causing endothelial dysfunction [ 26 27 28 29 30 p38 MAPK is a central signaling molecule activated by inflammatory stimuli such as IL-6. It transduces stress signals to the cell nucleus, triggering transcriptional programs that mediate cellular responses [ 31 Figure 5 32 33 34 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 6 Interestingly, IJV pretreatment with ODSH has a differential effect on cytokine production in BALF after IT LPS. It can be subdivided into several groups. In the first group, ODSH significantly attenuates the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1α, as well as the neutrophil attractant chemokine KC (similar to human IL-8) and GM-CSF ( Figure 8 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 While the mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effects of heparin and its derivatives, like ODSH, on the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines are largely unknown, early studies suggested that heparin may decrease their mRNA production in human monocytes after an LPS insult [ 42 43 In the second group, consisting of IL-12p70, LPS modestly but significantly increases the production of this cytokine, but ODSH addition has no significant effect on LPS-induced increase ( Figure 8 44 45 46 Klebsiella pneumoniae 47 48 48 In contrast to the first group, ODSH pre-treatment significantly increased production of IL-10 in BALF of LPS-treated mice ( Figure 8 49 50 51 52 16 53 54 Surprisingly, while 24 h of IT LPS significantly decreases the expression of IL-9, IL-15, and IL-17, IJV injection of ODSH restores their basal level in BALF ( Figure 8 55 56 57 58 59 60 IL-15 regulates the activation and proliferation of T cells, B cells, and natural killer (NK) cells and can be stimulated by LPS through its Toll-like receptors (TLR) [ 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 67 Mycoplasma pneumonia 68 5. Conclusions Our study showed that ODSH treatment attenuates LPS-induced lung injury by reducing lung vascular leak. In addition, ODSH treatment attenuates the LPS-induced neutrophil infiltration and oxidant tissue damage. Concomitantly, ODSH decreases the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-1α, KC, and GM-CSF and decreases the upregulation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, including NF-κB and p38 MAPK in lung tissue. It followed the same trend for NF-κB, IL-6, and p38 mRNA levels. By contrast, ODSH increases the production of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in the BALF of LPS-treated mice. ODSH, moreover, restores the LPS-suppressed levels of IL-9, IL-15, and IL-17 in BALF, suggesting that their expression may be important for lung recovery from an LPS insult. While the role of heparin as an anti-inflammatory agent, which protects against ALI, is well documented [ 24 54 Though these results support the anti-inflammatory potential of ODSH, we acknowledge the fact that further investigation is needed to delineate its effects on specific immune cell populations, including neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils, and T cells. Moreover, the precise molecular mechanisms by which ODSH modulates inflammatory signaling, particularly within the TLR4–MyD88–NF-κB pathway, remain to be elucidated. Future studies incorporating more advanced techniques and targeted pathway analyses will be essential to fully characterize the immunomodulatory actions of ODSH and its therapeutic relevance in ALI.

Representative slides of the lung sections (n = 4 mice) from animal groups of control, ODSH (50 mg/kg), LPS (2 mg/kg), and LPS/ODSH. The pathological changes were examined by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Lungs perfused free of blood were immersed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 18 h before H&E staining. Histological analyses of the lung tissue obtained from control mice showed minimal infiltration of neutrophils (scale bar = 100 µm). In contrast, mice exposed to LPS for 24 h produced prominent neutrophil infiltration (arrows) that was attenuated in LPS/ODSH-treated mice. ODSH alone treatment also shows minimal infiltration of the neutrophils. Figure 4 ODSH mediated attenuation of myeloperoxidase (MPO) staining (index of pulmonary infiltration of neutrophils). The MPO staining in the lung tissue (scale bar = 100 µm) indicates a markedly increased infiltration of neutrophils in the lungs of mice from the LPS group which was significantly attenuated in the LPS/ODSH group.
