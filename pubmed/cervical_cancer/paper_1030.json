The medium was supplemented with 10 µM ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632 (ATCC) for 2–3 days after subculture. The 922882-316-R organoid was generated in-house from the 922882-316-R PDX, obtained from the National Cancer Institute Patient-Derived Models Repository, in vivo.

Organoids were isolated from Matrigel and digested with TrypLE into small clusters of 5–10 cells, washed and resuspended in complete organoid medium with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to prevent detachment-induced cell death. Transductions followed the same procedure as described above, with spinoculation at 600 g pMHC stability assay The pMHC stability assay was performed as previously described 14 24 2 Antibodies, dyes and flow cytometry Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSymphony A5, LSR II or LSR Fortessa (all BD Biosciences), bulk cell sorting was performed on a SONY SH800 (SONY Biotechnology), and single-cell sorting was performed on a FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) for single-cell sorting. Data analysis was performed with FlowJo v10.6.2 (TreeStar). For surface staining, cells were incubated with antibodies for 15–20 min at 4 °C and washed. For mouse blood, red blood cells were lysed using ammonium–chloride–potassium buffer (Life Technologies) before staining. Mouse tumors were dissociated into single-cell suspensions by enzymatic digestion with 1 mg ml −1 −1 −1 2 T cell activation assays TCR-transduced T cell reactivity was evaluated by the upregulation of CD137 expression via flow cytometry. Transduced T cells were cocultured with target cell lines or autologous PBMCs in U-bottom 96-well plates at an E:T ratio of 1:2 (50,000:100,000 cells per well).
