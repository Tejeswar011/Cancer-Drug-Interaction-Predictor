Escherichia coli Pseudomonas putida Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus E. coli S. aureus While\nZIF-8 materials have been widely reported for their antimicrobial\nactivity, studies specifically of trans E. coli The main goal\nof this study was to demonstrate that trans trans E. coli Methodology Materials Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn (NO 3 2 2 4 6 2 2 4 l trans 9 8 Nanoparticle Synthesis ZIF-8 Synthesis ZIF-8 nanoparticles were synthesized\nusing a method with slight modifications. Synthesis of TC@ZIF-8 Nanoparticle Synthesis and Coating with\nPoly- l Encapsulation of TC in the ZIF-8 nanoparticles\n( Figure S1  To prevent aggregation and sedimentation,\nZIF-8 and TC-encapsulated ZIF-8 nanoparticles were coated with PL. Nanoparticle Characterization Particle Size, Zeta Potential, and TC Entrapment Efficiency The particle size was determined via nanoparticle tracking analysis\n(NTA) with a NanoSight NS 300 instrument (NanoSight, Malvern Panalytical\nInc., Massachusetts, USA) equipped with a sample chamber with a 532\nnm green laser and flow-cell top plate. Particles in a liquid suspension\nwere loaded into a sample chamber illuminated by a specially shaped\nlaser beam. The ZIF-8 and TC@ZIF-8 nanoparticles were dispersed in\nethanol (the particle concentration is around 0.2 mg/mL) and injected\ninto the sample chamber with a syringe (1 cc) connected with an infusion\npump. The samples were recorded for 45 s, and 4 measurements were\nperformed for each sample. The mean size, D10, D50, D90, and SD values\nobtained by the NTA software correspond to the arithmetic values calculated\nwith the sizes of all the particles analyzed by the software. D90\nvalues were reported for particle size. All of the measurements were\nperformed at room temperature. Zeta potential was measured with\na Malvern Zeta Sizer (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Panalytical\nInc., MA, USA) with a folded capillary zeta cell (DTS1070, Malvern\nPanalytical Inc., MA, USA). The zeta potential readings were carried\nout using freshly prepared ZIF-8 and TC@ZIF-8 suspensions in PL and\nafter freeze-drying and resuspending in water. Each suspension (concentration,\n2 mg/mL) was sonicated for 5 min prior to measurement. The amount\n(percentage) of entrapped TC in the ZIF-8 (TC@ZIF-8)\nnanoparticles was determined by UV–visible spectrophotometry\n(Genesys 10S UV–vis Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific,\nMadison, WI, USA). Approximately 5 mg of TC@ZIF-8 was dissolved in\n10 mL of 0.1 M HCl as sample solutions (diluted from hydrochloric\nacid, Acid Chlorhydrique, 34–37%, VWR Chemicals BDH, Radnor,\nPA, USA) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL and mixed thoroughly. The\nsuspensions were left for 15 min under constant agitation and then\nplaced in a UV–visible spectrophotometer, and the absorbance\nwas measured at 295 nm. The wavelength was determined as the maximum\nabsorbance in preliminary tests by scanning the UV–vis spectra\nof TC dissolved in 0.1 M HCI in triplicate. Samples were diluted with\n0.1 M HCl for proper spectrophotometric readings to keep the absorbances\nwithin a linear range. Entrapment efficiency (EE %) of the ZIF-8\nnanoparticles was determined\nas 1 E E ( % ) = a m o u n t o f a c t i v e c o m p o u n d e n t r a p p e d i n i t i a l a c t i v e c o m p o u n d a m o u n t × 100 The entrapment efficiency\n(EE %) of the TC@ZIF-8 nanoparticles\nwas measured because different mass ratios of TC per total solid component\nwere used to synthesize the nanoparticles. Scanning Electron Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy The morphology of ZIF-8, TC@ZIF-8, and TC@ZIF-8@PL nanoparticles\nwas imaged using a JEOL JSM-7500F (JSM7500, RRID/SCR_022202, Materials\nCharacterization Facility, Texas A&M University) ultrahigh-resolution\nfield emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) equipped with\na high-brightness conical FE gun and a low-aberration conical objective\nlens. The nanoparticles (in powder form) were placed as a very thin\nlayer on carbon tape and then sputter-coated (Cressington Sputter\nCoater, 208 HR, Ted Pella, Inc., CA, USA) with platinum/palladium\nwith a thickness of 5 nm prior to imaging. SEM was operated at an\naccelerating voltage of 3 kV and a working distance between 8 and\n15 mm, and the images were taken at a magnification of 37k ×. Aqueous suspensions of ZIF-8, TC@ZIF-8, and TC@ZIF-8@PL were also\nexamined using a FEI Morgagni Transmission Electron Microscope (FEI\nCompany, Hillsboro, OR) (Image Analysis Lab at Texas A&M University).\nThe suspensions of nanoparticles were placed on 300 mesh copper grids\nand stained with a 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate aqueous stain (Electron\nMicroscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) to provide contrast under magnification.\nExcess liquid on the mesh was removed with filter paper, and the grid\nwas allowed to dry before viewing under 50,000–100,000 times\nmagnification. Observations were performed at 80 kV. X-ray Diffraction Analysis, Gas Adsorption Analysis, and Fourier\nTransform Infrared Spectroscopy X-ray diffraction analysis\nwas conducted by using a Xeuss 2.0 HR SAXS/WAXS system (Xenocs, Sassenage,\nFrance) with a Cu source tuned to λ = 0.1542 nm. Measurements\nwere conducted at sample to detector distances of 1455.25 and 156.75\nmm. Nitrogen gas adsorption experiments of ZIF-8, ZIF-8@PL,\nTC@ZIF-8, and TC@ZIF-8@PL were measured at 77 K on a Belsorp Max X\nadsorption analyzer at the Microtrac Applications Laboratory (Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania, USA). Samples were pretreated at 100 °C under dynamic\nvacuum for 12 h before analysis. The 0.5 TC samples were pretreated\nat 70 °C under dynamic vacuum for 12 h. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller\n(BET) surface areas were calculated according to the ISO 9277 standard\nwith Rouquerol fits. Pore size distributions were calculated according\nto the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, and micropore\nvolumes were determined via T-Plots. FTIR spectroscopy was performed\nwith a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer\n(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Madison, WI, USA) with an attenuated total\nreflectance (ATR) instrument. Prior to the sample examination, air\n(no samples in the sample holder) and water were used for background\nanalysis. ZIF-8, ZIF-8@PL, TC@ZIF-8, and TC@ZIF-8@PL were used as\nsynthesized powders, and trans –1 –1 TC Release from ZIF-8 The release of TC from ZIF-8\nnanoparticles and PL-coated particles was evaluated using PBS, pH\n7.4, water, ethanol, methanol, a PBS/ethanol mixture (v/v, 20%), and\na PBS/methanol mixture (v/v, 3%, 5%, 10%) as release mediums. A typical\nrelease system was prepared by suspending TC@ZIF-8 and TC@ZIF-8@PL\nnanoparticles in buffer media at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, and each\nsuspension was prepared separately at each specific time interval\nand incubated in a water bath shaker (VWR International 89032-226,\nWest Chester, PA) at 37 °C, 100 rpm for 5 days. At predetermined\ntime intervals, a 1 mL aliquot was drawn and filtered through 0.2\nμm nylon membrane syringe filters (VWR Intl., West Chester,\nPA) prior to measurement. The measurements were performed with UV–visible\nspectrophotometry (Genesys 10S UV–vis Spectrophotometer, Thermo\nFisher Scientific, Madison, WI, USA). For each buffer, the wavelength\nwas determined as the maximum absorbance in preliminary tests by scanning\nthe UV–vis spectra of TC dissolved in each buffer. The absorbance\nreadings were performed at 295 nm for water, PBS pH 7.4, and PBS:\nethanol mixture and at 290 nm for methanol and ethanol. The same calibration\ncurve obtained for encapsulation efficiency was used for water, PBS\npH 7.4, and PBS: ethanol mixture, and a new calibration curve was\nobtained for ethanol and methanol by dissolving TC at a concentration\nbetween 0.5 and 6 μg/mL in ethanol and methanol. Antibacterial Activity Bacterial Culture Preparation  E. coli E. coli Minimum Inhibitory Concentration and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration The MIC of ZIF-8 and TC@ZIF-8 nanoparticles, both with and without\n0.1 mg/mL polylysine coating, was determined using a broth dilution\nassay. 2 y = ( 1 × 10 9 ) x − ( 6 × 10 7 ) x y E. coli 5 3 ( 0 h O D 630 , S P L ) − ( 0 h O D 630 , S P L C ) = 0 h O D 630 , n o r m a l i z e d 4 ( 24 h O D 630 , S P L ) − ( 24 h O D 630 , S P L C ) = 24 h O D 630 , n o r m a l i z e d 5 ( 24 h O D 630 , n o r m a l i z e d ) − ( 0 h O D 630 , n o r m a l i z e d ) = Δ O D 630 Any antimicrobial sample well that\nshowed ≤ OD NEG E. coli After the MIC test, all wells that showed inhibition of the test\nmicroorganism after 24 h were then tested for bactericidal activity\nby spreading 100 μL from each well showing inhibition onto TSA\nplates and incubating for 24 h at 37 °C. The lowest concentrations\nthat showed 3-log reduction on the plate surfaces following incubation\nwere considered bactericidal (MBC).

The\ndata was expressed as mean values ± the standard deviation (SD).\nStatistical analysis was performed using SPSS Software (IBM SPSS Inc.,\nversion 29.0.0.0, Armonk, New York, USA).

ZIF-8 has been investigated extensively as a pH-responsive\ndrug\ncarrier. For example, a study loaded anticancer drug doxorubicin into\nZIF-8 and evaluated its release in PBS across a pH range of 5.0 to\npH 7.4. A study investigated the effect of phosphate anions, both\nalone\nand in combination with lactic acid, on the degradation of ZIF-8 microcrystals. It was found that ZIF-8 rapidly decomposed in 10\nmM PBS, forming\ninsoluble zinc phosphate particles, and the smaller ZIF-8 particles\ndegraded faster.

As shown in Figure E. coli 12 Growth curve of E. coli This effect was even more pronounced when 5% methanol\nwas added\nto the PBS ( Figure 13 Growth curve of E. coli These findings indicated that while ZIF-8 can serve\nas a carrier\nto deliver TC with improved efficacy over ZIF-8 alone, both surface\nmodifications and dispersion conditions significantly impact antimicrobial\noutcomes. Conclusions This study aimed to develop and then characterize trans SEM and TEM images confirmed the characteristic\nmorphology of ZIF-8\nin the nanoparticles, as well as TC-entrapped ZIF-8, validating the\nobservation that TC entrapment did not change the morphology of ZIF-8\nnanoparticles. Gas adsorption analysis yielded a high BET surface\narea, which decreased with TC entrapment. FTIR spectra exhibited distinctive\npeaks of ZIF-8 and TC in the TC@ZIF-8 nanoparticles, and both methods\nfurther confirm the successful method for nanoparticle synthesis. TC release studies revealed that 0.5TC@ZIF-8 nanoparticles exhibited\na burst release in PBS buffer but a more controlled, steady release\nin water and alcohols. All synthesized ZIF-8 nanoparticles showed\nsome degree of antibacterial activity. An interesting finding was\nthat the antibacterial activity of 0.5TC@ZIF-8 nanoparticles could\nbe increased by changing the dispersion media.
