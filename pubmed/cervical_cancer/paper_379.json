Streptococcus anginosus Streptococcus anginosus Streptococcus anginosus Highlights • Streptococcus anginosus group is increasingly recognised as a cause of pyogenic abscesses. • Appendiceal rupture can cause infective thromboembolism and pylephlebitis. • Streptococcus anginosus group infection can mimic pseudomyxoma peritonei. • Sepsis is a rare but significant cause of widespread thrombotic disease.

It arises as a complication from intra-abdominal suppurative processes [6] [6] Escherichia coli, Bacteroides Streptococcus We highlight an atypical case of widespread pylephlebitis, infective thromboembolism and presumed mycotic pseudoaneurysm due to S. anginosus Case Study A 40-year-old male was transferred to a tertiary metropolitan hospital from a regional hospital with a two-week history of lower abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, nausea and jaundice. He had a history of binge-pattern alcohol use without clinical features of cirrhosis. His past medical history included psoriasis and asthma and he was on no regular medications. He reported no history of intravenous drug use, recent periods of immobilisation or other risk factors for thromboembolism. On examination he was tachycardic with heart rate 117 beats per minute and hypotensive with a blood pressure 94/55 mmHg. He had dermal and scleral icterus and a mildly tender lower abdomen with no signs of peritonism. Initial blood tests demonstrated a lactate 9 mmol/L (0.5–2.0 mmol/L) as well as elevated inflammatory markers with white cell count 34.3 × 10 9 9 9 9 Following transfer, the patient underwent further investigations. A repeat CTAP revealed a distended cystic structure within the right iliac fossa containing gas and dependent fluid density with the medial margin tethered to the sigmoid ( Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 1 Title – Intravenous contrast-enhanced portal venous phase CT abdomen and pelvis following transfer. Description – Cystic structure within the right iliac fossa containing gas (A). Multiple confluent lobulated hypodense foci within the mesorectum with mass effect and scalloping of the rectal wall, and further hypodense peri-splenic locule scalloping the splenic surface (B).

Fig. 2 The patient was commenced on a therapeutic dose of enoxaparin given his extensive portal venous thrombus, however developed large volume rectal bleeding with an associated haemoglobin drop from 90 to 64 g/L (130 – 180 g/L). An urgent CT angiography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated new inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) pseudoaneurysm, as well as an incidental finding of left sub-segmental pulmonary emboli (PE), with no active extravasation of contrast into the large bowel. A repeat flexible sigmoidoscopy and gastroscopy were also performed, neither of which identified any sources of gastrointestinal bleeding or appendiceal-sigmoid fistulisation. Whilst the initial recommendation from the vascular surgery team was to coil the IMA pseudoaneurysm, the patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate due to his significant disease burden from presumed malignancy and extensive thromboembolism. As such, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter was inserted to balance the risks of bleeding from the pseudoaneurysm with ischaemic risks from the known thrombi. Blood cultures were requested for investigation due to suspicion of sepsis. Bacteriological laboratory tests revealed an infection with Streptococcus Streptococcus anginosus [7] [8] [9] Blood cultures returned positive for S. anginosus After receiving two weeks of intravenous antibiotics, the patient showed marked clinical, biochemical and radiological improvement. A follow-up CTAP showed volume reduction of the right iliac fossa, peri-splenic and hepatic collections and partial involution of thrombi throughout the portal mesenteric venous system and presumed thrombi within the mesorectum. Given the clinical features, negative findings of malignancy and S. anginosus S. anginosus Following discharge, the patient completed an extended course of ceftriaxone followed by an oral tail of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Repeat CT demonstrated resolution of hepatic masses and abdominal collections with residual post-inflammatory adhesion of non-distended appendix adjacent to the sigmoid and small bowel, with complete involution of acute thrombi within the mesorectum and portal mesenteric venous system with cavernous transformation of portal veins. There was improvement in his PE as well as resolution of the pseudoaneurysm. The IVC filter was removed three months later. He continues to be followed up by the gastroenterology team in the outpatient setting for ongoing management of his cirrhosis. Discussion SAG is increasingly recognised as a cause of invasive pyogenic infections with abscess formation; most commonly intra-abdominal, cutaneous and soft tissue. Rarely, SAG has been found to cause liver and brain abscesses [1] [9] S. anginosus [10] Pylephlebitis is a rare condition presenting most commonly with fever, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Diagnosis is often made clinically in the presence of radiological evidence of portal vein thrombus coupled with bacteraemia and sepsis. Tracking infection from diverticulitis and acute appendicitis are the two most common causes of pylephlebitis owing to the drainage of the portal vein system [9] In terms of management, targeted antimicrobial therapy is requisite. Fortunately, selection of antimicrobial agents for the treatment of SAG is relatively uncomplicated. Profiles of SAG isolates have shown high susceptibility to beta-lactams [1] [11] [12] [13] Anticoagulation for PVT should be considered in tandem to antimicrobial therapy, though recommendations are limited due to the rarity of pylephlebitis, and by extension, the lack of randomised controlled trials and guideline recommendations. A retrospective observational study conducted by Naymagon et al. [14] [15] [16] As evidenced in this case, SAG infection can mimic PMP. To our knowledge, there are no cases in the literature denoting SAG infection presenting radiologically like PMP. PMP is a rare disease with high mortality, characterised by diffuse intra-abdominal gelatinous ascites with mucinous implants on peritoneal surfaces, classically arising from perforated AMNs [17] [18] [19] Conclusion Our case highlights the diagnostic challenge of managing complex disseminated infection caused by SAG.
