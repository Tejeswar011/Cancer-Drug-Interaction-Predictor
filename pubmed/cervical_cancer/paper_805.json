Cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are key in the ESCC microenvironment, yet their role in post‐radiation recurrence remains unclear. Materials and Methods KYSE150 ESCC cells were co‐implanted with non‐irradiated (0 Gy) or irradiated (8 Gy) CAFs in nude mice. CAF‐derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) were isolated via differential centrifugation and analysed by electron microscopy and immunoblotting. Transwell assays evaluated EVs' effects on ESCC cell migration and invasion in vitro. RNA sequencing identified differentially expressed microRNAs, and functional experiments verified the role of miR‐193a‐3p. Plasma samples from 32 ESCC patients and tissue samples from 76 ESCC patients were analysed for miR‐193a‐3p expression. Results Irradiated CAFs promoted the lung metastasis of ESCC cells in vivo, and their EVs enhanced ESCC cell invasion, migration and metastasis. Elevated miR‐193a‐3p levels in EVs from irradiated CAFs increased miR‐193a‐3p expression in ESCC cells. This effect was effectively attenuated by RNase and Triton X‐100 (degrading microRNAs encapsulated in EVs), or GW4869 (inhibiting EVs biogenesis and secretion)—indicating that miR‐193a‐3p functions in an EV‐dependent manner. Knockdown of miR‐193a‐3p diminished the invasion, migration and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)‐promoting activities of CAF‐derived EVs. Luciferase assays confirmed PTEN as a target of miR‐193a‐3p; miR‐193a‐3p overexpression decreased PTEN and increased p‐Akt expression. In vivo, coinjection of miR‐193a‐3p‐knockdown CAFs with KYSE150 ESCC cells resulted in smaller tumours, fewer lung metastases, increased PTEN and E‐cadherin, and decreased p‐Akt and Snail expression. Clinically, radiation increased plasma exosomal miR‐193a‐3p levels, and high miR‐193a‐3p expression was correlated with shorter survival, identifying miR‐193a‐3p as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in ESCC patients. Conclusion EVs from irradiated CAFs promote ESCC metastasis via the miR‐193a‐3p‐mediated PTEN/Akt signalling pathway. Targeting this EVs‐mediated interaction represents a promising strategy for improving ESCC radiotherapy outcomes. Key points  The poor prognosis of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is largely driven by recurrence and metastasis following radiation therapy. Irradiated cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs) drive ESCC recurrence and metastasis through extracellular vesicles (EVs), highlighting their critical role in the post‐radiation tumor microenvironment. CAF‐derived EVs deliver miR‐193a‐3p to ESCC cells, suppressing PTEN and activating Akt signaling, thereby enhancing invasion, migration, epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT), and metastatic potential. High plasma exosomal miR‐193a‐3p levels predict poor prognosis in ESCC patients and may guide therapeutic strategies after radiotherapy.  miR‐193a‐3p is upregulated in extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from irradiated cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Irradiated CAF‐derived EV miR‐193a‐3p promotes the metastasis and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of oesophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) cells. miR‐193a‐3p promotes ESCC metastasis through PTEN/Akt‐mediated EMT.

Our findings demonstrated that irradiated CAFs promote ESCC metastasis via EV‐mediated transfer of miRNAs from CAFs to cancer cells and identify miR‐193a‐3p/PTEN/Akt as the key pathway underlying this effect. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Tissue and plasma specimens Fresh ESCC tissues for in situ hybridisation were obtained from 76 patients who underwent surgical resection at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Centre between January 2014 and June 2014. The median follow‐duration was 35.6 months (interquartile range 23.5–49.6 months). Two senior pathologists confirmed ESCC diagnoses. Tumours were staged according to the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM classification. Participants were eligible for inclusion if they had not received preoperative chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The clinicopathological characteristics of the included patients are summarised in Supporting Information Table 1 Blood samples were collected from 32 patients with cytologically or histopathologically confirmed ESCC who underwent concurrent definitive chemoradiation therapy at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between February 2023 and June 2023. Samples were collected 1 day before treatment and 14 days after the initiation of concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (no. 0504323‐4‐2307E). 2.2 Cell culture Human ESCC cell lines KYSE150 and TE‐1 were obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) in a humidified incubator (37°C, 5% CO 2 Mycoplasma 2.3 Isolation and culture of CAFs CAFs were isolated from the central region of ESCC tumour tissue. After surgical resection, the samples were washed in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% antibiotic–antimycotic (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The tissues were then minced and digested for 2 h at 37°C with shaking using collagenase (Sigma‐Aldrich) and diluted in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and filtered through a 100‐µm cell strainer. The cells were then cultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS at 37°C with 5% CO 2 2.4 Preparation of conditioned medium from irradiated CAFs CAFs were inoculated into 25 cm 2 2.5 EV isolation and characterisation EVs were isolated from CAF culture‐conditioned supernatant and plasma via differential ultracentrifugation.  35 2.6 EV miRNA sequencing EV miRNA sequencing was performed by Lc‐Bio Technologies Co., Ltd. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from EVs, and a small RNA library was constructed using the TruSeq Small RNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). The libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq 2500 platform with 50‐bp single‐end reads. Differentially expressed genes (fold change ≥1.5 with p 2.7 Cell transfections hsa‐miR‐193a‐3p mimics, inhibitors and negative controls were purchased from RiboBio Co., Ltd. The mature hsa‐miR‐193a‐3p sequence was (5′‐AACUGGCCUACAAAGUCCCAGU‐3′). PTEN small interfering RNA (siRNA) and scramble siRNA were purchased from GenePharma Co., Ltd. Transfection of siRNA, miRNA mimics and miRNA inhibitors was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tumour cells were transfected with PTEN overexpression plasmid (pcDNA3.1‐PTEN) or the negative control vectors with Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). CAFs were infected with miR‐193a‐3p‐knockdown lentivirus or control lentivectors (GeneChem Co., Ltd.). The primer sequences are listed in Supporting Information Table 2 2.8 Western blotting Proteins were extracted using RIPA lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime). Each sample equivalent of 20 µg total protein was separated via sodium dodecyl‐sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in tris‐buffered saline with Tween20, polyvinylidene fluoride membranes were immunoblotted overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies. Horseradish peroxidase‐conjugated secondary antibodies were used for detection, and immunoreactive bands were visualised using Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The primary antibodies are summarised in Supporting Information Table 3 2.9 RNA extraction and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific). EV‐derived RNA extraction was performed using the Total Exosome RNA and Protein Isolation Kit (Invitrogen). Complementary DNA synthesis for mRNAs was performed using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara Bio), While miRNA reverse transcription was conducted using the Mir‐X miRNA First‐Strand Synthesis Kit (Takara). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT‐PCR) was performed in triplicate on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real‐Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with the TB Green kit (Takara Bio). Relative mRNA expression levels were analysed using the 2 −ΔΔCT 2 2.10 RNA stability assays Actinomycin D (AbMole) was added to TE‐1 cells transfected with miR‐193a‐3p mimics or NC mimic in a 6‐well plate at a concentration of 5 ug/mL for 0, 3 and 6 h intervals. After extraction, total RNA was reverse‐transcribed and evaluated using RT‐qPCR. As a means of measuring RNA abundance, the average Ct value at each time point was set to 0 h. 2.11 Animal models Female nude mice (BALB/c‐nu, 5 weeks old) were purchased from Shanghai Slack Laboratory Animal Co. Ltd. and maintained in a specific pathogen‐free facility under a 12‐h light–dark schedule. Sterile food and water were provided ad libitum.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 4 DISCUSSION Radiotherapy remains a cornerstone in the management of inoperable or locally advanced ESCC.  48 The interaction between cancer cells and surrounding stromal components, such as CAFs, is actively studied, with evidence suggesting that cellular communication between cancer cells and CAFs plays a vital role in tumour progression.  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57 In this study, we demonstrated that irradiated CAFs enhanced the invasion and migration of ESCC cells, consistent with Bao et al.  58  53  53  59  23 Besides CAFs, radiotherapy also exerts dual effects on other key cells within the TME, influencing both anti‐tumour immunity and pro‐tumour phenotypes. On the one hand, radiotherapy promotes tumour cell antigen release, activating dendritic cells (DCs) that prime CD8⁺ T cells for anti‐tumour responses. It also enhances CD8⁺ T cell cytotoxicity by stimulating the secretion of TNF‐α, IFN‐γ and granzyme B.  60  61  62 Regarding the mechanism by which irradiated CAFs enhance the invasion and migration of ESCC cells, we found that these CAFs release miR‐193a‐3p‐enriched EVs, which promote ESCC metastasis and EMT through PTEN downregulation and activation of the Akt signalling pathway. miR‐193a‐3p exerts diverse functions in multiple cancers. For example, studies suggest that miR‐193a‐3p functions as a tumour suppressor in colorectal,  63  64  65  66  67  68  68  67  68  69  70  71 Our study shows that inhibiting miR‐193a‐3p in CAFs enhances radiotherapy efficacy, suggesting that miR‐193a‐3p inhibitors could complement cancer treatment. Significant progress has been made in developing miRNA inhibitors, such as antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which bind specifically to the target miRNA or its precursor to prevent their function, and RNA interference (RNAi) technologies, which utilise siRNAs or short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to silence miRNA expression.  72  73  74  75  76 Liquid biopsy is an emerging tool for monitoring treatment response and predicting cancer outcomes.  77  78  79  80  81 The metastatic impact of radiation‐induced EVs secreted by CAFs on ESCC cells may vary with radiation dose and fractionation schedules. In preliminary experiments, we examined how different fractionation regimens affected miR‐193a‐3p levels in CAF‐derived exosomes. It was shown that 8 Gy in four fractions produced effects comparable to a single 8‐Gy dose (Supporting Information Figure 8  82  83 Radiation has differential effects on various cell types within the ESCC TME. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the upregulation of miR‐193a‐3p specifically occurs in CAFs. According to the literature, tumour cells, macrophages, T cells, fibroblasts and epithelial cells constitute approximately 80% of the cellular components in the oesophageal cancer TME.  84  85 9 In conclusion, we are the first to demonstrate that EVs derived from irradiated CAFs play a crucial role in intercellular communication, fostering a metastasis‐promoting microenvironment. Our findings support the notion that radiotherapy‐activated CAFs contribute to ESCC metastasis post‐radiotherapy and provide a rationale for targeting irradiated CAF‐driven miR‐193a‐3p‐Akt signalling to improve radiotherapy outcomes of ESCC patients.
