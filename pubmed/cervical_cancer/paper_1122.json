See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ BACKGROUND Thermal ablation (TA) has been proved to be effective and safe as minimally invasive treatment method for thyroid nodules. However, patients' experience during the procedures and quality of life varies among operators. AIM To explore strategy to improve quality of life and subjective experiences during TA for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) based on thermal field management (TFM). METHODS This retrospective propensity-matched cohort study was conducted in a single center. A total of 490 patients with PTC treated with TA from September 2023 to August 2024 were studied and divided into two groups (TFM group and non-TFM group) according to treatment strategies. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to control for confounding factors. Complications, side effect and complaints of patients were compared between the two groups. RESULTS A total of 113 patients (41.7 ± 10.6; 31 men, 82 women) were assigned to the TFM group, and 377 patients (mean age, 41.1 ± 10.7 year; 116 men, 261 women) were assigned to the non-TFM group. After PSM, a total of 108 patients were included in the TFM group, and 216 patients were included in the non-TFM group. The median follow-up was 10 months (range from 4-15 months). The incidence of voice change in the TFM group was significantly lower than that in the non-TFM group (0.9% vs P vs P CONCLUSION TFM, as a novel procedural optimization technique, can effectively improve quality of life and subjective experiences of patients during TA for PTC.

Its management has increasingly become a highlighting common clinical problem[ 1 2 3 4 6 7 In this context, we propose the concept of thermal field management (TFM) for the first time to optimize clinical practice in thyroid ablation. The central principle of TFM is to achieve complete ablation of thyroid nodules while minimizing injury to surrounding structures, thereby reducing complications and postoperative discomfort. Methodologically, TFM encompasses both active and passive management. Active management involves the real-time control or adjustment of the thermal field during the procedure under ultrasound (US) guidance. Passive management refers to protective techniques, such as hydrodissection, that prevent heat overflow from damaging adjacent structures. Importantly, TFM not only safeguards critical structures adjacent to the thyroid but also preserves perithyroidal soft tissues, including fascial layers. In the present study, we established and evaluated an improved technique for TA by integrating comprehensive TFM strategies, detailed technical refinements, and practical clinical applications. The aim was to assess the safety and patient experience of this novel TFM-based TA approach in comparison with conventional TA for the treatment of thyroid nodules. We hypothesized that optimized TFM during ablation improves short-term recovery and patient-reported quality of life compared to conventional approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients This retrospective study was approved by the Ethics Committees of China–Japan Friendship Hospital (2023-KY-250). Written informed consent for treatment and Quality of life assessment was obtained from each patient. From September 2023 to August 2024, a total of 490 patients underwent TA (MWA or RFA) for PTC in our center were enrolled (Figure 1 Figure 1  Patient flowchart. Complications and complaints of all patients were reviewed from the medical records presenting to our department and/or collected from telephone interview, and quality of life was assessed by the questionnaires. Preoperative evaluation Prior to TA, all patients underwent neck ultrasonography to assess the thyroid and cervical lymph nodes. Additional imaging (such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) and fine-needle aspiration were performed when necessary to exclude lymph node or distant metastases. TA procedure For both groups, the general procedures were similar and as follows: Prior to ablation, contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) (SonoVue, Bracco or Sonazoid, GE) was performed to assess the tumor’s enhancement pattern. Patients were positioned supine with the neck extended. After sterilizing the neck, local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was administered at the designated ablation site and along the thyroid capsule. Patients in non-TFM group received routine TA treatment as previously described[ 8 During TA treatment following the TFM strategy, energy delivery adhered to the principle of “minimum necessary”. In other words, the thermal field was strictly controlled based on the nodule’s size, location, and characteristics to ensure thorough coverage of the lesion while minimizing heat leakage beyond the target area. For PTC, minimal extended ablation (2 mm for non-infiltrative growth) should be achieved for nodules not adjacent to the thyroid capsule, with energy confined within the capsule. An individualized ablation strategy should be followed as outlined below.

Definition and study end points The primary end point was complications, and side effects which would significantly impact quality of life and subjective experiences of patients. The complications and side effects of the patients were observed and recorded during outpatient return visit, through questionnaires of quality of life, or collected through telephone interview. Questionnaires of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the Thyroid Cancer-Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (THYCA-QoL) was used to evaluate the quality of life and thyroid-specific symptoms for patients received TA at each follow-up time point. EORTC QLQ-C30 consists of 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea, and vomiting), 6 single-item common symptoms (dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties), and global health status subscales, while THYCA-QoL consists of seven symptom scales (neuromuscular, voice, concentration, sympathetic, throat/mouth, psychological and sensory problems) and six single items (problems with scar, feeling chilly, tingling hands/feet, gained weight, headache, less interest in sex). Most items are scored on a four-point response scale ranging from 1, “not at all” to 4, “very much”. After linear transformation, all scales and single-item measures range in score from 0-100. Among them, treatment-related symptoms and subscale scores were extracted for analysis[ 11 12 13 14 The secondary end points were technical success, which was defined as complete ablation, characterized as the nonenhancement ablation zone completely covering the targeted nodules and extending at least 2 mm from the original margin for PTC on CEUS. Follow-up After ablation, patients were followed up every 3 months in the first year, every 6 months for the next years, and annually thereafter. The follow-up included thyroid US, thyroid function tests, and questionnaires of quality of life. If the patient had hoarseness, the movement of the vocal cord was evaluated with US, as well as laryngoscopy, at each follow-up. Any delayed complications and presenting symptoms that occurred during the follow-up period were recorded.

DISCUSSION As a minimally invasive treatment, TA should prioritize improving health-related quality of life and patient experience when treating thyroid nodules, aiming to reduce treatment-related complications and postoperative discomfort. The concept of TFM represents a crucial advancement for PTC, enabling complete ablation of targeted nodules while maximizing protection of surrounding structures. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison of efficacy, safety, and subjective experiences between groups treated with or without TFM strategies for PTC. The results showed that the incidence of voice changes in the TFM group was significantly lower than in the non-TFM group (0.9% vs P vs P With advances in minimally invasive techniques, TA of thyroid nodules has rapidly progressed due to its proven effectiveness in treating BTNs and differentiated thyroid cancers in selected patient populations[ 4 5 15 16 17 Ensuring safety and enhancing patient experience are critical factors in the TA of thyroid nodules. The thyroid gland is located adjacent to vital structures such as the trachea, esophagus, cervical nerves, and carotid artery, and damage to any of these can result in serious complications. Moreover, the fascia surrounding the thyroid contains abundant peripheral nerves, lymphatic vessels, and stem cells, making it particularly sensitive to heat stimulation. Heat leakage during TA can injure the fascia, leading to postoperative pain, neck discomfort, or tissue adhesions, which negatively affect patient experience[ 7 vs P As pain is the most common complains during and after thyroid TA, reported in up to 24.6% of all studies, which will absolutely affect the health-related quality of life and patients’ experience[ 7 10 vs Notably, TFM, as a key conceptual framework in TA, is developed upon the principle of utilizing fascial spaces for protection during treatment[ 10 18 19 20 There are several limitations to this study. First, the retrospective nature of this study may have led to an inherent selection bias. Second, the follow-up period was short, meanwhile, considering the previous studies released by our team already confirmed the effectiveness of TA for PTC, the comparison of the treatment efficacy in long term follow up were not performed in the present study. Prospective, multicenter randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up are needed in the future. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that TFM is an effective strategy for improving quality of life and patient experience during TA of PTC. Compared to patients without TFM, those in the TFM group experienced a significantly lower rate of voice changes and showed a trend toward reduced procedure-related pain. Therefore, the TFM strategy can be recommended as a guiding approach for patients with PTC undergoing TA treatment.
