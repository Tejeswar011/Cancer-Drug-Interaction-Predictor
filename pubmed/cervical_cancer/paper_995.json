We present a comprehensive toolkit of ubiquitous and cell-specific promoters for potential use in adeno-associated virus (AAV)9-mediated gene therapy for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, systematically evaluating biodistribution, cellular specificity, and peripheral targeting. While ubiquitous promoters, such as the cytomegalovirus early enhancer/chicken beta-actin (CAG) promoter, drive widespread expression, cell-specific promoters offer greater targeting precision. We introduce a novel, astrocyte-specific, truncated glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter, named gfaABCD1405 (gfa1405), which enhances astrocyte specificity while reducing size, improving utility for gene therapies requiring larger transgenes. gfa1405 demonstrated broader CNS expression than gfaABC(1)D, addressing previous limitations in AAV-mediated applications. The methyl CpG binding protein 2 promoter (p546) effectively targeted neurons, with strong expression in the neocortex and hippocampus, making it a promising candidate for neuronal disorders. Oligodendrocyte-specific promoters exhibited distinct patterns, with the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) promoter driving expression in the corpus callosum, while the 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNP) promoter showed broader transduction, suggesting wider therapeutic applicability. This study establishes a promoter selection framework for AAV9-based gene therapy, enabling variable CNS cell-type targeting and optimizing therapeutic efficacy. By integrating comparative promoter analysis with gfa1405 development, we provide a practical collection for CNS-directed gene therapy, minimizing off-target effects and advancing treatment strategies for neurological disorders. Graphical abstract This study presents a comparative evaluation of ubiquitous and cell-specific promoters in the central nervous system and introduces a novel astrocyte-specific promoter. Using quantitative and imaging-based analyses, Bradbury and colleagues highlight promoter-dependent differences in distribution, intensity, and cell-type specificity. The toolkit described enables rational promoter selection for targeted gene therapy.

Rare neurodevelopmental disorders, predominantly affecting children, often result from inherited genetic mutations that disrupt normal brain function and CNS development. 1 , 2 3 3 , 4 , 5 4 , 6 Table 1 Table 1 List of promoters for potential use in AAV9-mediated gene therapy Promoter name Description Size (bp) Targeted cell types GFAP glial fibrillary acidic protein is a type of intermediate filament protein found in astrocytes 7 , 8 2,208 astrocytes gfa1405 truncated version of GFAP 1,405 astrocytes gfaABC(1)D truncated version of GFAP 7 , 8 681 astrocytes p546 truncated version of the Mecp2, transcriptional regulator 9 546 primarily neurons, but also expressed in glial cells CAG full-length CAG, composed of a chicken B-actin promoter with a CMV enhancer 10 1,700 ubiquitous tCAG truncated version of full-length CAG 7 581 ubiquitous EFS truncated version of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 α1 short form 11 240 ubiquitous CNP 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase, an important component in the myelination process carried out by oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) 12 1,644 oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells MAG myelin-associated glycoprotein, cell adhesion molecule involved in the formation and maintenance of myelin sheaths 13 1,451 oligodendrocytes, rMBP rat myelin basic protein, critical component of the myelin sheath, essential for the compaction and stability of myelin in the CNS and PNS 14 1,613 oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells Inherited genetic mutations that disrupt normal brain function and CNS development lead to abnormal cellular functions, structural changes, and degenerative mechanisms across different cell populations. Various neurological conditions arise depending on the specific cell types affected. For example, in leukodystrophies, disease typically manifests due to aberrant glial cell populations, which are crucial for maintaining homeostasis, forming myelin, providing support, and protecting neurons. 4 , 6 , 7 15 , 16 17 18 , 19 20 11 7 9 8 Table 1 Results Design and development of novel astrocyte-specific promoter derived from GFAP In pursuit of optimizing astrocyte-targeted gene therapies, we engineered a novel promoter derived from the foundational GFAP sequence, to achieve enhanced specificity and expression profiles within the CNS.

Additionally, we used mean EGFP intensity (relative fluorescence units, RFUs) as a proxy for assessing promoter-driven gene expression across different brain regions ( Figure 4 Figure 4 21 , 22 Figure 4 Comparative distribution and morphological analysis of EGFP protein in the mouse brain 4 weeks post-AAV9 i.c.v. injection using various promoters (A) Diagram of the mouse brain highlighting the regions analyzed, including the neocortex (CTX), hippocampus (HIP), striatum (STR), thalamus (TH), hypothalamus (HY), midbrain (MB), cerebellum (CB), pons (P), medulla (MY), FT – fiber tracts (green color including CC – corpus callosum area [spl – splenium and g – genu] and other green areas marked with a star “∗”),V – ventricular area, and olfactory area (OA).

Boxplots represent the percent (%) of EGFP-positive area in the brain area and EGFP intensity in the brain (mean EGFP intensity in the brain area minus median EGFP intensity of the EGFP-negative brain area) in RFUs. Statistical comparisons to CAG are shown; comparisons between all other possible promoter pairs are shown in Table S1. n p p p p The CAG promoter demonstrated widespread EGFP protein expression, covering up to 42% of the total brain area, with strong signals observed in the neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory areas, and thalamus, among other regions ( Figures 4 Figure 4 Figures 4 Figure 4 Figures 4 Figure 4 Figures 4 Figure 4 Among the astrocyte-specific promoters, gfa1405 demonstrated the broadest EGFP distribution, covering 35% of the brain area. EGFP protein expression was strong in the neocortex, hippocampus, and olfactory areas, with additional expression in regions close to the fiber tracts and ventricular system ( Figure 4 Figures 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figures 4 For the oligodendrocyte promoters, the CNP promoter drove widespread EGFP protein expression, covering 37% of the total brain area, including significant EGFP protein expression in the neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory areas, thalamus, and hypothalamus ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 This comprehensive analysis highlights the varying efficiencies of different promoters in driving EGFP protein expression across the CNS. Ubiquitous promoters like CAG demonstrated the highest distribution and intensity, while neuron-specific promoters such as p546 showed more targeted but widespread EGFP signal in neuronal projections. Astrocyte-specific promoters, particularly gfa1405, exhibited robust and widespread EGFP protein levels, while oligodendrocyte-specific promoter CNP displayed widespread but lower-intensity EGFP signal across both glial and neuronal populations. Promoters with low expression, such as rMBP and EFS, were excluded from further cell-type-specific colocalization analysis due to their minimal EGFP signal. Overall, the CAG (ubiquitous), gfa1405 (novel astrocyte), GFAP (full-length astrocyte), p546 (neuronal), and CNP (oligodendrocyte) promoters demonstrated the most promising results for driving widespread EGFP protein expression in the brain. Colocalization analysis of EGFP protein expression with cell-specific biomarkers in the brain As we proceeded to the next step in our investigation to identify the cell types with the best transduction levels in the brain, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate the expression patterns of EGFP with neuronal and astrocyte markers. We selected the hippocampus for high-resolution confocal imaging due to its high cellular density and strong GFAP signal, which enhances the detection and visualization of astrocytes. Additionally, the hippocampus is a critical region for neurogenesis and neural connectivity, making it highly relevant for examining promoter-driven EGFP protein expression in different cell types. 23 , 24 Figures 5 S2 Figure 5 Analysis of promoter specificity and colocalization with neuronal and glial markers in transduced brain tissues (A) High-resolution confocal microscopy images of EGFP expression (green) in the hippocampus after transduction with ssAAV9. EGFP with a variety of promoters as indicated, with the neuronal marker NeuN (red) and the astrocyte marker GFAP (purple). Nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue). Areas where EGFP expression overlaps with GFAP appear white, indicating EGFP expression in astrocytes, while overlap with NeuN appears yellow, indicating EGFP expression in neurons. (B) Percentage of EGFP-positive cells that colocalize with the astrocyte marker S100B (left, %) and the neuronal marker NeuN (right, %) among all EGFP-expressing cells in the brain for each promoter ( n n n p p p p The CAG promoter shows overlap with both GFAP and NeuN, indicated by white and yellow regions, suggesting EGFP protein expression in both astrocytes and neurons, with a stronger neuronal presence. The p546 promoter displays prominent yellow regions, indicating significant EGFP overlap with NeuN, suggesting predominant EGFP protein expression in neurons and minimal EGFP levels in astrocytes. EGFP driven by the GFAP promoter strongly overlaps with the astrocytic marker GFAP, indicating predominant EGFP levels in astrocytes and minimal colocalization with NeuN, suggesting limited neuronal EGFP protein expression. Similarly, the gfa1405 promoter shows significant overlap with GFAP, while the gfaABC(1)D promoter also retains astrocyte specificity, as evidenced by extensive white regions in the images. Additionally, we conducted a regular fluorescence microscopy colocalization study of EGFP with S100B and NeuN in the cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory areas, which were identified as the most abundant regions from the EGFP distribution analysis. S100B, known for its wider distribution compared to GFAP in the mouse brain, provided a complementary marker for astrocytes. 25 , 26 Figure 5 Figure 5 Following examination of astrocytic and neuronal populations for the aforementioned promoters, we conducted a detailed fluorescence microscopy colocalization study of EGFP with Olig2 and NeuN for the MAG and CNP promoters. Due to specific expression in oligodendrocytes, the CNP and MAG promoters can be effectively used with the Olig2 biomarker to identify and study these myelin-producing cells in the CNS. This part of the analysis focused on the MAG promoter using a 20× objective to capture 5 fields of view (FOVs) per sample ( n Figures 5 S3 n Based on our data showing robust promoter activity at 4 weeks, we extended our analysis to assess the stability of the gfa1405 (astrocyte-specific) and p546 (neuron-specific) promoters at 8 weeks, focusing on EGFP distribution, intensity, and colocalization with cell-specific markers ( Figure S4 Discussion Our study underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate promoter in the design of gene therapy vectors, particularly for targeting specific cell populations within the CNS. We employed i.c.v. injections in neonatal mice, a widely used model in preclinical gene therapy studies targeting early-onset CNS disorders, where early intervention is critical. This approach enabled delivery of vectors directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, facilitating widespread and uniform distribution across the brain and spinal cord, which is particularly beneficial for treating diffuse CNS disorders. 27 28 29 Ubiquitous promoters, such as CAG and EFS, are known for their widespread gene and protein expression but lack cell-type specificity. As a result, they can drive transgene expression not only in the CNS but also in peripheral tissues, such as the heart and liver, where unintended expression poses risks. Our study found that the full-length CAG promoter (1,700 bp) exhibited the strongest distribution and protein expression in neurons and astrocytes within the CNS following i.c.v. injection in neonatal mice. This enhanced activity may be due to additional regulatory elements that boost transcriptional efficiency. In contrast, truncated promoters like tCAG (581 bp) and EFS (240 bp) showed significantly weaker EGFP intensity, likely because they lack key structural components, such as the hybrid CBA intron and the rabbit beta-globin splice acceptor site in the case of tCAG, which may influence mRNA processing and stability, thereby impacting transgene expression. Promoter structure differences, especially between truncated and full-length variants, can substantially affect gene expression outcomes. For example, a shorter 212 bp EFS promoter version reported in the literature 30 30 in vivo 31 , 32 It is known that the MecP2 promoter includes key regulatory elements like CpG islands, which are crucial for the binding of transcription factors that modulate gene expression, essential for its role in neuron-specific expression as they contribute to the regulation of MecP2 gene transcription in response to neuronal activity and developmental cues. 9 9 19 , 33 7 Figure 2 All astrocyte-specific promoters (GFAP, gfa1405, and gfaABC(1)D) showed robust gene and protein expression in astrocyte-rich areas, such as the neocortex, hippocampus, olfactory regions, and corpus callosum. Notably, the newly developed gfa1405 promoter was designed to balance efficiency with size constraints, offering broader distribution than the full-length GFAP promoter while saving 803 bp of space in the AAV vector, and thus can be used for larger therapeutic genes, critical for conditions like leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter. This enhanced distribution is likely due to the inclusion of regulatory regions C3, C5, and C6, which may promote stronger interaction with transcription factors, thus increasing expression efficiency. In contrast, the gfaABC(1)D promoter, which also lacks the inhibitory C2 region, 8 34 8 The truncated gfa1405 and p546 promoters demonstrated strong cell-type specificity, with gfa1405 effectively targeting astrocytes and p546 driving widespread neuronal expression, particularly in the hippocampus and neocortex. Both promoters maintained stable expression over time, with no significant changes in distribution or intensity at 4 and 8 weeks. To effectively address leukodystrophies caused by oligodendrocyte dysfunction, such as globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease), 6 13 cis 14 in vivo in vitro in vivo 35 in vivo Overall, CAG, gfa1405, and CNP each produced strong gene-to-protein correspondence across the examined brain regions, whereas p546, despite its broad fluorescent footprint, yielded lower total protein. This distinction underscores that promoters driving protein predominantly into fine neuronal projections may appear under-represented when measured in bulk tissue. In the liver, however, a different pattern emerged: CAG drove modest, but highly variable, transcript levels but only minimal protein accumulation. Such uncoupling is common in hepatocytes and likely reflects post-transcriptional controls that limit translation or accelerate protein turnover. 36 In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of cell-specific promoters demonstrates the critical role of promoter selection in achieving precise, efficient, and targeted gene expression within the CNS. The success of promoters such as gfa1405, which combines enhanced specificity with reduced size, highlights the potential for optimizing gene therapies that are both effective and safe. The broad distribution and high gene and protein expression levels achieved by gfa1405, coupled with its reduced off-target effects, underline its promise for future therapies aimed at astrocyte-targeted interventions. Moreover, promoters like CNP, with its ability to target both oligodendrocytes and neurons, showcase the versatility required to address complex neurodegenerative diseases. While some promoters, such as rMBP, may require further optimization, this underscores the need for continued research to refine these tools. The ability to fine-tune promoter activity will not only enhance gene therapy outcomes but also broaden the range of treatable CNS disorders. This work paves the way for the development of highly specialized, next-generation vectors that can safely and efficiently deliver therapeutic genes to specific cell types within the CNS. By continuing to explore and optimize cell-specific promoters, we can accelerate the development of targeted gene therapies that have the potential to revolutionize treatments for a variety of neurological conditions. Materials and methods Construct design and development All constructs were designed to fit within the 4.8 kb packaging capacity of the ssAAV vector. All sequences were synthesized by GenScript with appropriate restriction sites added for cloning and cloned into a Kanamycin-resistant ssAAV backbone (Andelyn, USA) and modified in Dr. Bradbury lab (Nationwide Children’s Hospital, Columbus, USA) using a rapid DNA dephosphorylation and ligation kit (Roche, 50-100-3347). First, EGFP 8 12 13 14 11 10 7 8 AAV production Recombinant AAV production was performed using a calcium phosphate-mediated triple transfection in adherent HEK293 cells. Harvested media were filtered, concentrated, and then purified by gradient ultracentrifugation followed by ion-exchange chromatography. Vectors are formulated in 20 mM Tris (pH8.0), 1 mM MgCl2, 200 mM NaCl, and 0.001% Pluronic F68 and sterile-filtered. A droplet digital polymerase chain reaction process specific to the AAV2 ITR sequence was used to determine the AAV titers. All recombinant AAV vectors were generated at Andelyn Biosciences. Intracerebroventricular injections All animal procedures were performed under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Nationwide Children's Hospital and conducted in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. C57Bl/6 neonates (P0–P1) were cryo-anesthetized (∼2 min) before the i.c.v. injections. The i.c.v. injections were performed using a Hamilton syringe (Cal7635-01) with 33GA 30° beveled needles (Hamilton, 7803-05) into the left hemisphere, positioned at 2/5 of the distance from the lambda suture to the eye. C57Bl/6 neonates were injected with 5 μL volumes of ssAAV9 vectors encoding GFP under various promoters. The viral genome (vg) doses for each vector were as follows: 7.50E10 vg per animal for AAV9.GFAP.EGFP, AAV9.gfa1405.EGFP, AAV9.gfaABC(1)D.EGFP, AAV9.P546.EGFP, AAV9. CAG.EGFP, and AAV9.EFS.EGFP; 7.00E10 vg per animal for AAV9.tCAG.EGFP; 8.50E10 vg per animal for AAV9.CNP.EGFP and AAV9.rMBP.EGFP; and 8.00E10 vg per animal for AAV9.MAG.EGFP. After the injections, the mice were placed on a heating pad until they regained mobility and were then returned to their breeding cages. Cohorts and necropsy Our study cohorts consisted of 10 C57Bl/6 mice (5 male and 5 female) per promoter construct or control, along with 3 additional mice of either sex for whole-organ images. Some groups consisted of fewer replicates due to cannibalism or unexpected deaths (p546 and MAG groups, N N Microscopic examination of EGFP biodistribution and IHC One group of mice (3 mice per construct) was used to visualize the EGFP-positive signal across whole organs. Large-scale imaging was conducted using an Olympus microscope and cellSens version 1.3 software (Olympus, Center Valley, PA). All other right brain hemisphere samples (5 male/5 female per construct) were embedded and frozen in OCT compound (Scigen Tissue-Plus, Fisher). Sagittal sections were cut at 30 μm thickness on a cryostat (1950 Leica, Germany). Free-floating sections were washed in PBS and incubated with DAPI solution in PBS for 1 min at room temperature (RT). To retrieve antigens from PFA-fixed tissues, slices were treated with 0.1% sodium borohydride in PBS for 15 min at RT. Part of the sections were used for EGFP biodistribution and expression analysis. To facilitate the visualization of brain areas and enhance the anatomical context, DAPI staining was employed, which labels cell nuclei and thus delineates the overall brain structure and cellular distribution. In addition to analyzing general distribution, we included 20× magnified images covering an area of 90,000 square micrometers to identify which cell types expressed EGFP based on their morphological features. For the morphological analysis and determination of brain regions, we utilized the Allen Brain Atlas as a primary reference. This resource aided in accurately identifying specific brain areas and was instrumental in constructing schematic sagittal sections for visual representation within this article. 37 For EGFP colocalization with specific cellular markers, all the slices were blocked and permeabilized in 10% goat serum and 5% donkey serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS with 1% Triton (PBST) for 1 h at RT, followed by overnight incubation in antibody diluent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with chicken anti-GFAP (Abcam, 1:300) or mouse anti-S100B (MilliporeSigma, 1:400) or mouse Olig2 (MilliporeSigma, 1:50) and rabbit anti-NeuN (Cell Signaling, 1:500) at 4°C. Sections were washed in PBS and subsequently incubated with donkey anti-chicken Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:500), donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:500), donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:500), and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:500) secondary antibodies in PBST with 10% normal donkey serum for 1 h at RT. Sections were then washed in PBS and mounted on slides in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired using a Nikon Ti2-E motorized fluorescence microscope with a Nikon DLED-I multiline LED engine, a Hamamatsu ORCA Fusion camera, and Nikon Plan Apochromat Lambda D objectives. A quad-pass filter cube (C-FLL LFOV D/F/T/Cy5) was used for excitation and emission, and an emission cleanup wheel was used with Semrock filters for each channel. Images of EGFP colocalization with S100B were captured as 20× objective, 18–22 z stacks at a resolution of 0.16 μm/pixel with a Z step size of 0.6 μm. A total of 13 fields of view were acquired from 5 different brain regions (visual cortex, somatosensory cortex, motor cortex, olfactory areas, and hippocampus) with three replicates totaling approximately 1,800 cells in each replicate. Additional representative high-resolution images of EGFP and GFAP colocalization were captured as z stacks on a Nikon AX R confocal in resonant mode with a 60× Plan Apochromat Lambda D oil immersion objective at a resolution of 0.09 μm/pixel and a Z step of 0.19 μm. The confocal z stacks were compressed to 2D images using the extended depth of focus module in NIS-Elements. Separate channels for EGFP, GFAP, NeuN, and DAPI or EGFP, Olig2, NeuN, and DAPI channels are shown in Figures S2 S3 Images were processed and analyzed using NIS-Elements software v.5.30, employing custom algorithms developed in the General Analysis 3 module (Nikon Instruments). Each image underwent automatic rolling ball background correction, using a large radius to maintain all features. The DAPI signal delineated the total brain area. An automatic threshold for EGFP, derived from the tissue’s background intensity, identified EGFP-positive pixels. Statistical analysis of EGFP expression, both in terms of area coverage and intensity across different groups, was performed with one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons. The results were presented as boxplots showing the percentage of EGFP-positive area and the adjusted mean EGFP intensity (mean intensity in EGFP-positive areas minus median intensity in EGFP-negative areas) in RFUs. Colocalization of EGFP with S100B or NeuN was analyzed using maximum intensity projections of z stacks representing 19 individual fields of view from each brain and approximately 7 fields of view for colocalization of EGFP with Olig2 or NeuN. Astrocytes and oligodendrocytes were identified using bright spot detection with automatically calculated minimum intensity thresholds in the red channel (AF568). EGFP-positive pixels were segmented using an automatically calculated threshold for EGFP signal in the green channel (GFP). The overlap between the centroid of each bright spot representing an astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, or neuron and EGFP-positive signal was then used to identify cells as EGFP positive or EGFP negative. Neurons were segmented in a similar way within the far-red channel (AF647). The total and EGFP-positive cell counts from all regions were added up to calculate the percentage of EGFP-positive cells by the type for each brain section. These results were then graphed, and statistical analyses such as ordinary one-way ANOVA were performed to determine significance for most of the promoters and experiments, except for colocalization analysis for CNP and MAG, where an unpaired t test was used to determine significance, using GraphPad Prism. RNA isolation and quantitative PCR for EGFP Left hemispheres of the 4-week EGFP-injected C57Bl/6 mice (4–5 animals per construct, male and female) were cut into 6 sections and snap-frozen for molecular analysis. Peripheral tissues were also dissected from the same animals and divided and snap-frozen for molecular analysis. RNA was then extracted from 3 mouse brain areas, rostral (anterior region from bregma), central (posterior region from bregma), and caudal (posterior region from lambda); cervical spinal cord, thoracic spinal cord; lumbar spinal cord; heart; and liver using QIAGEN RNeasy Plus mini kit (QIAGEN, 74134), and RNA from quadriceps was isolated using the RNAeasy fibrous tissue mini kit from QIAGEN (QIAGEN, 74704) following the manufacturer’s protocol for snap-frozen tissue. Genomic DNA and AAV episomal DNA were then removed from RNA using DNA-free DNA removal kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM1906) following manufacturer’s rigorous protocol. After DNA removal, RNA purity and concentration were measured using NanoDrop One microvolume ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. 200 ng of RNA was then loaded into cDNA reactions using RevertAid first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, K1621). One sample each from the CNS and peripheral organs for each promoter was set up in a cDNA reaction without reverse-transcriptase enzyme to create “No RT” controls. qPCR reactions were prepared by adding 1.75 μL of cDNA reaction product to 18.25 μL of prepared qPCR master mix per well containing TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4305719), Ambion nuclease-free water (Invitrogen, AM9937), EGFP TaqMan FAM-MGB gene expression assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4331182, Assay ID Mr04329676_mr), and mouse ACTB (β-actin) TaqMan VIC-MGB gene expression assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4352341E). qPCR cycling conditions were adopted from TaqMan universal PCR master mix manufacturer protocol, omitting the optional UNG incubation at 50°C prior to polymerase activation at 95°C. All experiments were performed on QuantStudio 6 flex real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4485692). All samples were run in triplicate on a plate, and 2–3 plates were run per promoter, resulting in 6–9 wells per sample. Data analysis was performed using the delta CT method, calculating expression relative to corresponding endogenous gene expression within the sample (β-actin). The 2–3 plates were averaged together to create the final graphs. Protein isolation and western blots for EGFP protein quantification Total protein was extracted from mouse BA1, BA2, BA3, heart, and liver on 4-week-old EGFP-injected animal tissues following the manufacturer’s protocol using T-PER tissue protein extraction reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 78510) with Pierce protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32963). Protein lysate was quantified using the DC protein assay kit II (Bio-Rad, 5000112). Western blot loading samples were prepared using NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0007) with NuPAGE sample reducing agent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0004). Loading samples were then denatured at 70°C for 10 min, and 25 μg of protein was resolved on 4%–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris Plus mini protein gel (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NP0336BOX) followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane using the semi-dry transfer system. After transfer, membranes were blocked for overnight at 4°C in Pierce protein-free blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 37572). Blocked membranes were incubated for 2 h at RT with the following antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibody to GAPDH (1:5,000; Synaptic Systems) and chicken polyclonal antibody to GFP (1:5,000; Abcam). Following incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline with .1% Tween (0.1% PBST). Membranes were then incubated for 1 h at ambient temperature with the following secondary antibodies: goat anti-chicken Alexa Fluor 568 (1:1,000; Abcam) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1,000; Invitrogen). Membranes were then washed briefly in 0.1% PBST. Blots were subsequently imaged for fluorescence using Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP imaging system (Bio-Rad, 12003154). For accurate comparison between tissue types, all blots were imaged at the same exposure (1 s exposure for AF488; 101 s exposure for AF568). Quantification of band intensity was performed using Bio-Rad Image Lab software. Data were then analyzed in GraphPad Prism, and statistical analyses were performed through a two-way ANOVA between all groups. All fluorescence images were inverted and converted to black and white. Due to differences in transfer efficiency, p546 and gfa1405 heart blots had minor contrast enhancement for GAPDH band visualization. All post-image processing was performed in Adobe Photoshop software.
