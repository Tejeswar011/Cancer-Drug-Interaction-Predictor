Physical exercise has been linked to ALS but controversy remains. A key question is to determine which individuals might be at risk of exercise-associated ALS, because unnecessary avoidance of exercise could be harmful. We implemented complementary strategies including Mendelian randomization (MR) and multiple questionnaire-based measures of physical exercise in different cohorts. We include a prospective study involving UK Biobank participants where we could test for a relationship between exercise and the timing of future ALS symptom onset. To interrogate the molecular basis of our observations we performed a genetic association study of ‘extreme’ exercise, equivalent to >6 h of strenuous exercise or >12 h of any leisure-time exercise per week. Our data suggest that the link between increased physical exercise and ALS is particularly important for males who perform the most activity; with no evidence of a link in females. We determined that extreme exercise in males is associated with loss-of-function genetic variants within a number of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling genes that are also differentially expressed in ALS spinal cord. Activity-induced mTOR signalling has been shown to selectively benefit MN. Therefore, our findings could imply that moderate exercise is neuroprotective via enhanced mTOR signalling, but extreme exercise in men is associated with neurotoxicity and ALS via a failure of this mechanism. There was no significant overlap between genes associated with extreme exercise and those associated with ALS risk, consistent with a true gene–environment interaction rather than a shared genetic basis. We are not yet able to make individual-level recommendations regarding exercise and risk of ALS, but our conclusions should provide focus for future investigation. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been linked to physical exercise, but it is unclear who may be at risk and through what mechanism. O'Brien et al.

The majority of ALS has been proposed to result from gene–environment interactions. 1 2 3 4 5 One proposal that may explain apparently contradictory observations is that ALS risk is not related to all physical activity, but only to very frequent or strenuous physical exercise. Consistent with this, we 2 6 7 Here, we set out to explicitly investigate the link between the dose of physical exercise and risk of ALS separately in males and females. We have combined complementary strategies—Mendelian randomization (MR) and questionnaire-based measures, including in a prospective study. Two-sample MR does not require measurement of exercise and ALS incidence in the same individuals 8 8 9 10 A potentially important concept is that exercise itself may not be causally related to ALS but instead both exercise and ALS may share a common genetic basis. In this scenario, a person who carries a genotype associated with strenuous physical exercise may be at increased risk of developing ALS, even if they do not actually perform any exercise, because their genetic background is responsible for the elevated disease risk. ALS has a rare variant architecture 11 Across all cohorts we find convergent evidence for a link between higher frequency or intensity of physical activity in males and younger age of ALS symptom onset. We provide evidence that this association is driven by males who perform the most exercise. To investigate this, we performed a genetic study of the top 5% of exercisers in the UKB, which we defined as ‘extreme’, equivalent to >6 h of strenuous exercise or >12 h of any leisure-time exercise per week. We identified an excess of loss-of-function mutations within mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling genes in the male extreme exercise group. mTOR is a protein kinase that functions in intracellular signalling, and has been implicated in the regulation of catabolism and anabolism, including the balance of cell proliferation and cell survival in response to nutrient availability. 12 13 Fig. 1 Figure 1  Approach to identify those at risk of exercise-associated ALS. 11 https://BioRender.com/j09u606 An important point is that our analyses do not permit individual-level conclusions and so we cannot offer individualized recommendations for safe physical activity. Our findings should help to focus future investigation of exercise-associated ALS on males performing extreme exercise, but we are cognisant that unnecessary reduction of exercise could be detrimental to general health. 14 Materials and methods Sex-specific genome-wide association study for frequent or intense physical exercise Sex-specific genome-wide association study (GWAS) for physical exercise was performed using UKB data; we used the strenuous sport and other exercise (SSOE) definition as in Klimentidis et al 15 16 17 When performing the GWAS, we only included imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the Haplotype Reference Consortium. Sample exclusion criteria included mismatches between self-reported and genetically inferred sex, abnormally high heterozygosity and a >5% missing rate. SNP exclusions were based on low minor allele frequency (<0.1%), low minor allele count (<20), high missingness (>1.5%), low imputation quality (info <0.4) and deviation from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium ( P −6 Male- and female-specific GWAS were carried out using the Swiss Army Knife tool and REGENIE 18 r 2 Sex-specific GWAS for ALS risk We used a sex-specific ALS GWAS from Project MinE ( https://www.projectmine.com/ 19 Two-sample MR for the effect of physical exercise on ALS risk Genetic variants or SNPs associated with ‘exposure’ to the SSOE trait were used as genetic instruments; we employed a P −5 16 R P R 2 MR was performed using a multiplicative random-effects inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimate for significance testing, as this method has the greatest statistical power 20 F F 8 P P 21 I 2 I 2 22 https://github.com/MRCIEU/TwoSampleMR https://amymariemason.github.io/MR/ https://github.com/WSpiller/RadialMR Questionnaire measurement of historical physical exercise using HAPAQ Data were analysed from a previous questionnaire study of ALS cases and healthy controls undertaken by Harwood et al 23 9 From the results of the HAPAQ questionnaire, durations of various types of physical activity were calculated for each decade of life. Inputting the metabolic equivalent value (MET) for each activity undertaken then enabled conversion into a value of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE). 9 23 23 Questionnaire measurement of physical exercise in UKB participants who later developed ALS Physical activity in UKB participants was quantified in MET minutes. One MET corresponds to an activity where 1 kcal per kilogram per hour is consumed. A MET minute corresponds to one minute of that activity. MET minutes per week is thus a measure of the amount of energy expended per week quantified in multiples of this unit. UKB includes a measure of total activity in MET minutes based on reported activity at the time of enrolment. 10 To perform a sensitivity analysis we ranked individuals by MET minutes per week of physical activity. We then repeated the Cox regression tests but with removal of the top 20 individuals by activity rank. Further repeat tests removed 20 progressively lower ranked individuals; in each test the 20 individuals overlapped the cohort removed in the previous test by 19 individuals. After tests had been performed with removal of all individuals at least once, we then calculated the Pearson correlation between the mean MET minutes per week of physical activity in the removed subset, and the age of ALS symptom onset in the remaining individuals. The idea was to determine whether individuals performing more or less physical activity disproportionately affected the results of our analysis. If all individuals contributed equally then we might expect no significant correlation. A caveat is that the UKB does not record the precise date of ALS diagnosis but instead the date when the diagnosis was reported to the UKB, which may not be equivalent but should not precede the actual date of diagnosis. Moreover, we expect that the difference between the recorded date and the actual date of diagnosis is independent of the amount of exercise performed. Rare variant gene burden testing in extreme exercisers To isolate individuals performing extreme quantities of physical exercise in the UKB we selected the top 5% of exercisers within the SSOE category described above; this equated to those who performed more than 6 h of ‘strenuous exercise’ or more than 12 h of other leisure-time exercise per week. More precisely we selected males or females who performed ‘strenuous exercise’ everyday for more than 15–30 min; and ‘strenuous exercise’ 4–5 times a week for more than 1.5–2 h per session; and ‘strenuous exercise’ 2–3 times a week for more than 3 h per session; and ‘other exercise’ everyday for more than 1.5–2 h per session; and ‘other exercise’ 4–5 times a week for more than 2–3 h per session. The total number of males who met these criteria was 3615; the total number of females who met these criteria was 2133. This group was used in a rare variant gene burden analysis.

To test whether strenuous exercise is driving the signal observed in this analysis, we conducted a sensitivity analysis whereby we systematically removed a subset of individuals with progressively increasing MET minutes per week of physical activity. The mean quantity of physical activity performed by the removed subset was negatively correlated with the strength of the association between physical activity and age of ALS symptom onset in the remaining individuals (Pearson correlation, cor P −6 Fig. 4E cor P −5 Fig. 4F Rare variant analysis of extreme exercise We have provided evidence that higher levels of physical activity may drive an association between physical exercise and younger age of symptom onset for ALS in males. This could be the result of a gene–environment interaction, i.e. exercise could be harmful to motor neurons (MN) in the presence of a specific genetic background. An alternative explanation is that genetic drivers of extremely strenuous exercise are also genetic drivers of ALS, independent of the actual exercise performed. These alternatives are summarized in Fig. 5A Figure 5  Rare genetic variant burden testing links extreme exercise to loss-of-function mutations within mTOR signalling genes, which are also differentially expressed in ALS spinal cord A top bottom n n 26 B NCKAP1L C GOLPH3 D LAMTOR2 E RFFL F 13 F top F bottom https://BioRender.com/zxcqdn5 We isolated a group of male extreme exercisers in the UKB, which we defined as males who performed more than 6 h of ‘strenuous exercise’ or more than 12 h of other leisure-time exercise per week ( n n Table 3 30 Supplementary Table 2 P Fig. 5A P 26 Table 3 P P 13 Table 3 Genes enriched with loss-of-function mutations in males who perform extreme exercise, which are also differentially expressed in ALS versus control cervical spinal cord Gene Genetic LOF association with extreme exercise Gene expression in ALS versus control cervical spinal cord OR FDR FC FDR  ADCY6 5.88 3.41 × 10 −3 0.83 7.81 × 10 −5  AZIN2 5.79 3.35 × 10 −3 0.66 3.78 × 10 −5  BBS12 3.94 6.13 × 10 −3 1.26 1.73 × 10 −3  C2orf68 7.12 1.26 × 10 −3 0.91 2.76 × 10 −3  CCR10 15.43 2.21 × 10 −3 1.41 2.85 × 10 −4  CD14 5.79 9.22 × 10 −3 2.08 2.83 × 10 −5  CMKLR1 6.17 9.22 × 10 −3 1.63 8.92 × 10 −6  CYP2S1 5.14 3.68 × 10 −4 1.79 2.26 × 10 −6  DYRK1B 7.72 6.62 × 10 −3 0.84 5.46 × 10 −3  EPHB2 6.86 2.97 × 10 −5 0.67 1.17 × 10 −6  FNIP2 9.26 1.26 × 10 −3 1.42 2.30 × 10 −7   GOLPH3  7.72  1.04 10 −3  1.13  5.49 10 −3  KDELC2 2.54 9.22 × 10 −3 1.31 1.86 × 10 −4  KDM4C 4.54 2.38 × 10 −3 0.9 2.01 × 10 −3   LAMTOR2  15.43  4.79 10 −4  1.19  3.80 10 −5  LYSMD2 12.35 2.18 × 10 −3 1.29 8.24 × 10 −5  MSMO1 8.42 1.40 × 10 −3 0.62 3.35 × 10 −3   NCKAP1L  4.94  9.09 10 −3  1.79  4.35 10 −9  NUDT4 5.15 6.35 × 10 −3 1.74 1.93 × 10 −6  PCDHA8 4.98 3.35 × 10 −3 0.78 9.26 × 10 −3  PLLP 12.35 1.99 × 10 −3 0.74 1.80 × 10 −3  RCAN1 1.79 9.22 × 10 −3 0.8 2.82 × 10 −6  RELL1 10.29 6.13 × 10 −3 0.77 1.46 × 10 −4   RFFL  15.43  9.17 10 −4  0.76  2.74 10 −8  TMEM14C 12.35 3.79 × 10 −4 1.31 1.17 × 10 −6  TOPBP1 10.29 5.03 × 10 −3 1.12 3.00 × 10 −3  TPK1 1.21 8.75 × 10 −3 1.37 1.37 × 10 −6  TTLL5 2.98 3.20 × 10 −3 0.74 1.29 × 10 −8 Rare variant analysis was performed in the UK Biobank comparing males who performed more than 6 h of ‘strenuous exercise’ and/or more than 12 h of ‘other exercise’ per week ( n n P P In females (2133 extreme exercisers versus 127 061 sedentary individuals) the same genetic analysis identified n Supplementary Table 3 P P To gain further mechanistic insight we examined the directional change of transcription in ALS spinal cord 26 26 Fig. 5B–D 13 RFFL Fig. 5E Discussion Understanding the cause of ALS is crucial for the development of strategies for disease prevention. The majority of ALS is thought to result from gene–environment interactions. It follows that identified environmental risk factors are likely to apply only to individuals with a specific genetic background, and therefore any effort to prevent disease by reducing environmental exposure needs to be targeted. For physical exercise this is particularly crucial because we know that exercise in general confers considerable benefits to physical and mental health, and a large proportion of the population fails to meet the recommended thresholds of exercise per week. 31 The measurements of physical exercise we have employed: indirect measurement via genetic liability, a retrospective case-control questionnaire-based measure of lifetime exercise and a prospective questionnaire in a population-scale dataset, all have different advantages and disadvantages, which was the reason we chose to employ all three. We have provided multiple lines of evidence to suggest that the previously reported relationship between leisure-time physical exercise and ALS 16 Fig. 3A B Previous studies support the hypothesis that extreme exercise may be a contributor to the risk of ALS. A study of 212 246 individuals who took part in the annual long-distance cross-country skiing competition (Vasaloppet) from 1989 to 2010 in Sweden 32 16 33 It is important to consider what biological mechanism could link extreme exercise and ALS risk. Indeed, in other contexts exercise has been shown to be neuroprotective. 34 13 Fig. 5F Fig. 5F 35 36 We have identified a genetic link between reduced mTOR signalling and extreme exercise in males but the mechanism is unknown. Pharmacological inhibition of mTOR signalling is associated with improvements in cardiac function, 37 38 39 40 41 42 The regulation of mTOR signalling is complex and a detailed consideration is beyond the scope of this study. It is noteworthy that mTOR signalling genes, which are genetically inhibited in those who engage in extreme exercise in a way that may predispose to ALS, are generally upregulated in the spinal cord of ALS patients. This could be consistent with a neuroprotective response to symptom onset in the majority of patients who do not carry LOF mutations within mTOR signalling genes. However, one mTOR signalling gene ( RFFL Fig. 5E 43 44 45 46 In conclusion, we provide evidence that ALS is linked to extreme exercise in males, potentially via inhibition of mTOR signalling. The beneficial effects of mTOR inhibition on longevity could therefore be associated with an increase in MN vulnerability in the face of an environmental factor predisposing to ALS such as physical activity. Our observations might also explain why non-extreme exercise, which is not associated with mTOR inhibition, can be neuroprotective via activation of mTOR signalling at the NMJ. mTOR inhibition and exercise are frequently combined in the practice of ‘anti-ageing’ but our work suggests that caution may be necessary to avoid potential harm. We note that rapamycin has actually been proposed as a treatment for ALS due to its immunomodulatory effects, but in a recent negative clinical trial, 47 48 in vivo An important caveat to our work is that we have not performed an individual-level prospective analysis, which is the gold standard for the prediction and verification of gene–environment interactions. Our work provides motivation to focus future study on the interaction between physical activity and the risk of ALS on males performing extreme exercise, but should not be used to advise reduced physical activity in the general population.
