Methods A cohort of one hundred and twenty-one individuals diagnosed with breast cancer and 95 healthy volunteers were recruited for this study. Relative abundances of VIM-AS1 were detected through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was employed for evaluating the diagnosis potential of VIM-AS1. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis was performed to further examine the prognostic performance of VIM-AS1. The cellular events of VIM-AS1 were assessed via CCK-8 and Transwell assay. The target interaction of VIM-AS1 and microRNA-29a-3p (miR-29a-3p) was verified via luciferase activity report assays. Results VIM-AS1 expression was notably elevated in serum of breast cancer, demonstrating a significant diagnostic capacity for breast cancer patients. Its abnormal expression level was significantly correlated with TNM (tumor node metastasis, P P P P P Conclusion VIM-AS1 exhibited aberrant expression in breast cancer, playing a critical role in tumor development by targeting miR-29a-3p. Our findings highlight the potential of VIM-AS1 as a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in breast cancer. However, further in vivo studies and exploration of miR-29a-3p downstream targets are needed to fully elucidate the mechanistic role of VIM-AS1 in breast cancer progression.

Additionally, we analyzed the relationships of VIM-AS1 with clinicopathological factors, as well as its prognostic implications. Furthermore, we explored the influence of VIM-AS1 on cellular behaviors within breast cancer. Method and materials Patients and sample collection One hundred twenty-one breast cancer patients admitted to Zibo Central Hospital were enrolled as the study group according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) patients meeting the diagnostic criteria of breast cancer as confirmed by pathological biopsies; (2) patients without any other primary tumors or systemic diseases; (3) patients with complete clinical records; (4) patients without any anti-cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy before operation. Simultaneously, a control group comprising 95 healthy volunteers were recruited for a physical examination during the same timeframe. Following a fasting for 12 h, peripheral blood (5 ml) was collected from each participant using EDTA tubes. Serum was separated using standard procedures, and kept at -80℃ until further experimentation. The Ethics Committee of Zibo Central Hospital supported the approval. All the subjects and their family members had provided written-form informed consent after thoroughly understanding the nature and implications of this study. Follow-up Following the surgical intervention, patients included in the study were monitored for a duration of 5 years. The survival rate of these patients was meticulously tracked and summarized at three-month intervals in the first two years and subsequently at six-month over the final three years. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) was applied to isolate total RNA on the basis of the manufacturer’s instruction. The isolated RNA was subjected to reverse transcription reaction for cDNA synthesis with the PrimeScript reverse transcription reagent Kit (TakaRa, Dalian, China). The relative abundances of VIM-AS1 and miR-29a-3p were determined following the manufacturer’s requirements of SYBR Master Mix Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) with the participation of primers and run on a 7500 real-time system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Results of qRT-PCR were expressed as fold changes, calculated using the equation of 2 −ΔΔCt Then, based on the mean value of VIM-AS1 expression levels in the cohort, patients were stratified into high and low VIM-AS1 expression groups. The mean value was calculated from the qRT-PCR results of all the enrolled breast cancer patients. Patients with VIM-AS1 expression levels above the mean value were classified as the high VIM-AS1 group ( n n Cell culture and transfection Normal mammary epithelium cell line MCF-10 A, along with breast cancer cell lines, including MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, BT549, T-47D, obtained from Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China), was applied in the experiments. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% CO 2 Utilizing Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen), the constructed silencing negative control (si-NC), silencing VIM-AS1 (si-VIM-AS1), si-VIM-AS1 + miR-29a-3p inhibitor, overexpression negative control (oe-NC), oe-VIM-AS1 and oe-VIM-AS1 + miR-29a-3p, together with the control group, were transfected into MCF-7 and T-47D cells for further analysis in vitro cell experiments. The efficiency of transfection was evaluated using qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation assay After transfection of 48 h, cells were digested and subsequently seeded into 96-well plates, ensuring three parallel replicate wells for each condition. The cells were then incubated at 37℃ with 5% CO 2 Transwell assay Following a 48-hour transfection period, a Transwell chamber assay was adopted to examine cell migration and invasion capabilities. For the migration assay, cells were harvested to prepare cell suspensions, and then transferred to the top chamber in FBS-free medium, while the bottom chamber was filled with cell culture medium containing 20% FBS to prompt cells to pass through the membrane. After incubation for 24 h, membranes were collected, and cells were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 20 min at room temperature. Invasion assay was implemented utilizing a similar protocol, with the distinction that the top chamber was pre-coated with Matrigel. The stained cells were then calculated under an optical microscope. Dula-luciferase activity reporter assay The plasmid containing the binding sites between VIM-AS1 and miR-29a-3p was cloned into the pGL3 vector, resulting in the construction of the wild-type vector (VIM-AS1-WT). In parallel, a mutant-type vector (VIM-AS1-MUT) was established by incorporating plasmids containing the mutant binding sites. These vectors were subsequently co-transfected into breast cancer cells by Lipofectamine 3000, alongside miR-29a-3p mimics, inhibitor, or NC. The cells were co-transfected for 24 h, and luciferase activity was assayed based on the instruction provided by the manufacturer via a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay system (Promega). Statistically analysis For statistical analysis, SPSS 23.0 and GraphPad Prism 9.0 were conducted. The sample size was calculated based on previous and preliminary data and a power analysis was conducted using G*Power software (version 3.1) with a power of 0.8. The analysis confirmed that the sample size of 121 patients was adequate to achieve the desired statistical power. Continue variables were presented as average±SD (standard deviation) and assessed between two groups via Student’s t test. Categorical variables were evaluated by means of Chi-square test to determine differences between groups. Correlations between VIM-AS1 and miR-29a-3p were appraised through Pearson’s correlation analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was established to assess the diagnosis capacity. The prognostic value of VIM-AS1 was determined with both Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. When a P Results VIM-AS1 was widely expressed in breast cancer To investigate the expression pattern of VIM-AS1 in breast cancer, qRT-PCR was conducted.

A B Impacts of VIM-AS1 on cellular events in breast cancer cells Considered the relevance between VIM-AS1 expression and clinical outcome in patients suffering from breast cancer, impacts of VIM-AS1 on biological function of breast cancer cells were explored. Our findings revealed a significant increase in VIM-AS1 levels in breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, BT549, T-47D) ( P 4 4 P 4 4 4 4  Fig. 4 VIM-AS1 significantly affects cell proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. A B C D E F G H I J K P P P # P ## P ### P VIM-AS1 targeted and suppressed miR-29a-3p To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which VIM-AS1 influences breast cancer progression, we employed bioinformatics analysis to predict the binding sites of VIM-AS1 with miR-29a-3p (Fig. 5 5 P 5 r P 5  Fig. 5 VIM-AS1 directly targeted miR-29a-3p in breast cancer.

Subsequent analysis utilizing CCK8 and transwell assay were implemented. It was demonstrated that the suppressive effects of silencing VIM-AS1 on cellular events, including cell proliferation, migration and invasion, were reserved via transfection miR-29a-3p inhibitor (Fig. 6 6  Fig. 6 The recovery experiment investigating the effect of silencing VIM-AS1 demonstrated that the administration of si-VIM-AS1 in conjunction with miR-29a-3p inhibitor effectively cancelled the suppressive effect of si-VIM-AS1 on cell proliferation ( A B C D E F G H P P ## P ### P ^^^ P Discussion Breast cancer is characterized by its remarkable heterogeneity, rendering it susceptible to recurrence and metastasis, as well as accelerating its progression [ 18 19 LncRNAs have been demonstrated to be aberrantly expressed and play a significant role in the onset and formation of various tumors, including breast cancer [ 20 21 11 12 22 23 Dysregulation of cellular processes is a significant contributor to cancer pathogenesis and serves as a pivotal indicator of human tumors. The regulatory effects of lncRNAs on cellular behaviors have been emerged as the standard criterion for the assessment of their role in tumor progression. For example, lncRNA NR2F2-AS1 was highly reported and accelerated progression of cervical cancer by promising cellular activities [ 24 Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that a multitude of miRNAs paly critical roles in the regulation in the carcinogenesis and development of cancers by functioning to be tumor suppressors or promotors, including breast cancer [ 25 26 27 Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of the tumor immune microenvironment in breast cancer progression [ 28 29 30 31 33 Nevertheless, in the current research, several critical gaps should be addressed. Firstly, the downstream target genes of miR-29a-3p are still unclear. Although bioinformatics analysis has predicted potential target genes, these predictions need to experimentally validated. Identifying the downstream targets of miR-29a-3p is crucial for understanding the specific molecular mechanism by which VIM-AS1 regulates breast cancer progression. Further studies should focus on validating these targets using dual-luciferase reporter assays or other techniques. Moreover, in future studies, we plan to employ advanced bioinformatic tools, such as R language, to conduct more in-depth analyses of raw data and utilize multiple databases to further validate and explore the regulatory networks involving VIM-AS1. This approach will help identify additional downstream targets and pathways associated with VIM-AS1 in breast cancer progression. Secondly, our study lacks in vivo validation. While our in vitro experiments demonstrate the effects of VIM-AS1 on cellular activities, these findings need to be confirmed in animal models. In vivo experiments, such as tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer xenograft models, are essential to validate the role of VIM-AS1/miR-29a-3p axis in breast cancer progression. Thirdly, the impact of VIM-AS1 and miR-29a-3p on tumor immunity remains unexplored. Tumor immunity plays a critical role in the progression and prognosis of breast cancer. Future studies should investigate the effects of VIM-AS1 and miR-29a-3p on the tumor immune microenvironment using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and so on. The high diagnostic capacity and prognostic value of VIM-AS1 suggested its potential as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection and risk stratification. This could aid in the development of personalized treatment plans and improve patient management. The identification of VIM-AS1 as an oncogenic lncRNA and its interaction with miR-29a-3p provide a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer. Targeting VIM-AS1 or restoring miR-29a-3p function could offer new treatment options for patients with advanced or refractory disease. Conclusion This study represents the inaugural exploration of VIM-AS1 expression status in breast cancer. Our findings confirmed that VIM-AS1 was extensively expressed in the tumor and patients exhibiting increased VIM-AS1 expression experiencing inferior clinical outcomes. Furthermore, VIM-AS1 significantly regulated cellular activities of breast cancer cells via targeting miR-29a-3p. While our findings are statistically significant, their biological relevance is further supported by their impact on clinical outcomes and known biological mechanisms. Addressing the limitations mentioned above will enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer and providing new insights for therapeutic strategies.
