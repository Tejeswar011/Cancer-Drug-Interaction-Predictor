However, its clinical utility is hampered by life-threatening interstitial lung disease (ILD), whose molecular basis remains unknown. Through the integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we revealed that sotorasib activates PPAR-γ signaling, upregulating fatty acid oxidation (FAO) via its downstream effector CPT1B. This metabolic shift triggered mitochondrial ROS overproduction, which drives alveolar epithelial apoptosis and fibrosis in vivo and in vitro Graphical Abstract  Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12964-025-02425-3. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction The KRAS G12C mutation, a prominent oncogenic driver in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colorectal cancer, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, long defied therapeutic targeting due to its elusive binding pockets [ 1 2 3 4 5 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), nuclear receptors governing lipid metabolism and inflammation, exhibit a Janus-faced duality in tissue homeostasis [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Here, we propose a novel mechanism: the off-target effects of sotorasib activate PPAR-γ as a ligand through an atypical site, Thr325, engages FABP4 to upregulate CPT1B—a linchpin of fatty acid β-oxidation—triggering ROS-driven epithelial apoptosis and fibrotic remodeling. By dissecting this axis, we not only decode sotorasib’s metabolic collateral damage but also unveil FABP4 inhibition as a strategic countermeasure, bridging mechanistic discovery to therapeutic salvage. Results Sotorasib induces pulmonary toxicity in vivo and in vitro To simulate sotorasib-mediated pulmonary toxicity in vivo, we administered C57BL/6 J mice daily with 30% cyclodextrin and 600 mg/kg/d sotorasib via intragastrically for four weeks (Fig. 1 1 1 15 1 1 1 Fig. 1 Sotorasib induces pulmonary tissue injury and triggers apoptosis of pulmonary epithelial cells. C57BL/6 J mice were treated with either vehicle or 600 mg/kg/d sotorasib for four weeks ( n A B C D E F G H I J K L M N P To further investigate sotorasib-induced damage to pulmonary epithelial cells, we conducted in vitro studies using the human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B and the mouse lung epithelial cell line TC-1. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) staining revealed a significant reduction in cell viability in both BEAS-2B and TC-1 cells following sotorasib treatment (Fig. 1 1 1 1 1 1 The activation of PPAR-γ signaling pathway is the key reason of sotorasib-induced lung toxicity Apoptosis is widely recognized as the terminal event of cellular stress responses, marking a critical juncture in the cell lifecycle under adverse conditions [ 16 2 17 2 Fabp4 Cpt1b Scd4 Cpt2 Acadm Ehhadh Aqp7 Plin1 2 2 Fig. 2 Sotorasib activates the PPAR-γ pathway to mediate pulmonary toxicity. ( A B) A B C D E PPARA PPARD PPARG F PPARA PPARD PPARG G H I P P P Next, we sought to determine the role of PPAR pathway activation in sotorasib-induced pulmonary epithelial cell apoptosis. To this end, we silenced the three PPAR subtypes— PPARA PPARD PPARG PPARG 2 PPARG 2 The activated PPAR-γ pathway induces lung toxicity through upregulating the expression of CPT1B protein Growing evidence highlights the critical role of the PPAR pathway in regulating lipid metabolism, differentiation, and inflammation. To further elucidate the downstream mechanisms by which sotorasib-activated PPAR-γ signaling induces pulmonary toxicity, we analyzed transcriptomic data, which revealed significant enrichment of lipid metabolism-related pathways, such as regulation of lipolysis and fatty acid degradation, following sotorasib treatment (Figure S3A). To validate these findings, we conducted comprehensive lipid metabolomic profiling of pulmonary epithelial cells treated with sotorasib. Compared to the control group, sotorasib-treated cells exhibited 286 upregulated and 282 downregulated metabolites (Fig. 3 3 Fig. 3 Sotorasib-activated PPAR-γ pathway induces pulmonary toxicity by upregulating CPT1B expression and ROS accumulation. ( A C A B C 2 D E SCD CPT1B CPT2 ACADM EHHADH F CPT1B G PPARG H I J CPT1B P Based on these findings, we classified the downstream targets of PPAR-γ identified in Fig. 2 3 CPT1B CPT1B 3 3 As the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid β-oxidation, CPT1B is primarily localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation [ 18 20 PPARG 3 3 PPARG The upregulation of CPT1B expression increases mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, leading to excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. This suggests that CPT1B-mediated ROS overproduction may be a key mechanism underlying sotorasib-induced pulmonary toxicity via PPAR-γ activation. To test this hypothesis, we measured intracellular ROS levels using the fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. The results showed ant increase in ROS levels following sotorasib treatment (Figure S3J). Mitochondrial superoxide (MitoSOX) staining further revealed elevated mitochondrial ROS levels in sotorasib-treated pulmonary epithelial cells, which were reversed by CPT1B 3 Sotorasib potentiates the transcriptional activity of PPAR-γ through directly interation To elucidate the mechanism by which sotorasib activates the PPAR-γ pathway, we first examined whether sotorasib affects PPAR-γ expression. Transcriptomic analysis revealed no significant changes in PPAR-γ FPKM values following sotorasib treatment compared to the vehicle group (Fig. 4 4 21 4 4 4 Fig. 4 Sotorasib directly binds to PPAR-γ and activates its transcriptional activity. A B C D E F G H I J P P P To identify the specific binding site of sotorasib on PPAR-γ, we conducted molecular docking, which predicted a hydrogen bond interaction between sotorasib and the Thr325 residue of PPAR-γ. We then constructed a PPAR-γ Thr325 deletion mutant and compared its binding affinity for sotorasib to that of wild-type PPAR-γ. WB analysis confirmed that sotorasib binds to wild-type PPAR-γ but not to the Thr325 deletion mutant (Fig. 4 4 Additionally, WB analysis revealed that transfection with wild-type PPAR-γ enhanced sotorasib-induced apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas the Thr325 deletion mutant significantly attenuated these effects (Figure S4I, J). Annexin V/PI staining further corroborated these findings (Fig. 4 4 Inhibition of FABP4 suppresses PPAR-γ transcriptional activity and alleviates sotorasib-induced toxicity To identify effective therapeutic targets and strategies for mitigating sotorasib-induced pulmonary toxicity, we further investigated the mechanisms underlying sotorasib’s nuclear translocation and its interaction with PPAR-γ. Previous studies have shown that the PPAR-γ pathway upregulates fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4), which facilitates the nuclear translocation of PPAR-γ ligands, thereby promoting a positive feedback loop in downstream signaling [ 12 22 5 2 5 FABP4 5 FABP4 5 Fig. 5 Inhibition of FABP4 attenuates PPAR-γ transcriptional activity and alleviates Sotorasib-induced apoptosis and EMT. A B C D FABP4 E F FABP4 G H I J P P Having established the pivotal role of FABP4 in sotorasib-induced toxicity, we sought to target FABP4 as a therapeutic strategy to suppress the aberrant activation of PPAR-γ. Hyperoside (HYP), a natural compound derived from Hypericum perforatum Crataegus 23 5 24 5 5 Hyperoside serves as a potential interventional strategy to mitigate the pulmonary toxicity induced by sotorasib We further validated the protective effects of the FABP4 inhibitor hyperoside (HYP) against sotorasib-induced pulmonary toxicity in vivo (Fig. 6 6 6 6 6 Fig. 6 Hyperoside can rescue Sotorasib-induced pulmonary toxicity. C57BL/6 J mice were treated with vehicle, Soto (600 mg/kg), HYP (50 mg/kg), or Soto plus HYP for 4 weeks via intragastric administration ( n A B C D E F G H I J We then evaluated the expression levels of key proteins associated with sotorasib-induced pulmonary toxicity. The results showed that sotorasib treatment significantly upregulated both the expression and nuclear translocation of FABP4, which was effectively reversed by HYP (Fig. 6 6 Discussion This study delineates a previously unrecognized mechanism by which sotorasib, a KRAS G12C inhibitor, provokes interstitial lung disease through ligand-mediated activation of the FABP4-PPARγ-CPT1B axis. Our findings reveal that sotorasib directly binds PPAR-γ at Thr325, triggering excessive mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ROS overproduction, which culminate in alveolar epithelial apoptosis and fibrotic remodeling (Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Sotorasib, induces pulmonary toxicity by aberrantly activating the FABP4-PPARγ-CPT1b signaling axis. Upon administration, sotorasib binds directly to PPAR-γ at the non-canonical Thr325 site, facilitated by FABP4-mediated nuclear translocation. This interaction triggers PPAR-γ transcriptional activation, upregulating CPT1B—a mitochondrial enzyme driving excessive fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Elevated FAO generates reactive oxygen species, culminating in alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis and EMT, which collectively promote ILD. Pharmacological inhibition of FABP4 (e.g., hyperoside) disrupts this cascade, rescuing lipid homeostasis and mitigating lung injury PPAR-γ activation: a double-edged sword in pulmonary homeostasis PPAR-γ agonists are widely recognized for their anti-inflammatory and metabolic regulatory roles in acute lung injury [ 25 CPT1B as a pivotal mediator of mitochondrial dysfunction CPT1B, the rate-limiting enzyme in mitochondrial FAO, emerges as a central effector of sotorasib-induced injury. Its upregulation drives ROS accumulation, activating caspase-dependent apoptosis and EMT—a pathway corroborated by rescue experiments using CPT1B silencing or mitochondrial antioxidants. These findings extend prior observations the role of CPT1B in ischemia–reperfusion injury and fibrosis, underscoring its broad relevance in oxidative stress-related pathologies. Notably, the selectivity of CPT1B (versus other PPAR-γ targets like SCD or ACADM) in mediating toxicity highlights its therapeutic potential. FABP4: a therapeutic leverage point Our discovery of FABP4’s role in sotorasib nuclear translocation and PPAR-γ activation introduces a feedforward regulatory loop previously uncharacterized in pulmonary contexts. By demonstrating that hyperoside, a natural FABP4 inhibitor, attenuates sotorasib-induced fibrosis and apoptosis in vivo, we bridge mechanistic insight to therapeutic innovation. Hyperoside’s efficacy, coupled with its established safety profile in inflammatory and metabolic disorders, positions it as a promising adjunct to sotorasib, potentially decoupling antitumor efficacy from pulmonary toxicity. Clinical translation and unanswered questions Notwithstanding the pivotal role of the FABP4-PPARγ-CPT1B axis in mediating sotorasib-induced ILD, there are still several issues warranting consideration. Initially, while the mouse model recapitulates the lung histopathological features of human upon sotorasib exposure, its physiological relevance remains insufficient as the absence of tumor microenvironment complexities. Validation in tumor-bearing models or patient-derived organoids thus remains indispensable. Moreover, although hyperoside demonstrates preclinical efficacy in mitigating toxicity caused by sotorasib, substantial uncertainties persist regarding its long-term safety profile, specifically, potential renal toxicity after long-term administration [ 26 FABP4 PPARG Conclusion Based on our experimental evidence, this study demonstrates that sotorasib induces ILD through direct binding to PPARγ Thr325 residue—validated by biotin-pulldown assays and mutagenesis. FABP4 mediated the nuclear translocation PPARγ ligand facilitates this interaction, hyperactivating downstream CPT1B-dependent fatty acid oxidation to provoke mitochondrial ROS overproduction and subsequent in alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis/EMT. Critically, pharmacological inhibition of FABP4 by hyperoside significantly attenuated sotorasib-induced pulmonary toxicity in vivo. Building on these foundational insights, future studies should prioritize translational validation of hyperoside and explore synergistic targeting of KRAS and PPAR-γ pathways to optimize therapeutic outcomes. Materials and methods Animal study and approval C57BL/6 J mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Jiaxing, China) and housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle and free access to food and water. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols of the Institute of Medical Artificial Intelligence Innovation at Zhejiang University (ethical approval numbers: DW202311092319 and DW202406201425). Mice were acclimatized for one week before drug administration. For tissue or blood collection, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and euthanized via cervical dislocation. sotorasib (T8684, Topscience, Shanghai, China) and hyperoside (T2844, Topscience, Shanghai, China) were dissolved in cyclodextrin (Aladdin, H108813) to prepare stock solutions. Mice (7–10 weeks old) were treated daily via intragastric administration with cyclodextrin, 600 mg/kg sotorasib, or 50 mg/kg hyperoside for 28 days. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis Lungs were harvested post-euthanasia and divided into two parts. The right part was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C, while the left part was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, P6148, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA), embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 4 μm. Tissue sections were stained with H&E and Masson’s trichrome following standard protocols. Lung injury was semi-quantitatively assessed using the Smith’s scoring system, which evaluates pulmonary edema, alveolar and interstitial inflammation, hemorrhage, atelectasis, and hyaline membrane formation on a scale of 0–4 (0: no injury; 1: < 25% involvement; 2: 25%−50%; 3: 50%−75%; 4: > 75%). The total lung injury score was the sum of individual scores [ 15 For immunohistochemical analysis, lung sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO, ab208670, Abcam, UK), F4/80 (sc-377009, Santa Cruz, USA), anti-fibronectin (FN, #610,078, BD Biosciences, USA), cleaved caspase-3 (ET1608-64, HuaBio, China), PPARγ (#2435, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), FABP4 (12,802–1-AP, Proteintech, China), and anti-CPT1B (ab134988, Abcam, UK). Slides were scanned and analyzed using a pathological slide scanner (HS6, Sunny Instrument Co., Ltd., Ningbo, China). TUNEL assay Apoptosis in lung tissues was detected using the One-Step TUNEL Apoptosis Assay Kit (C1088, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and pretreated with Proteinase K (ST532, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) at 37 °C for 30 min. TUNEL detection solution was added to the slides and incubated at 37 °C in the dark for 60 min. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, D212, Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan), and TUNEL signals were visualized using a fluorescence microscope (IX81-FV1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cell viability assay Cell viability was assessed using the sulforhodamine B (SRB, S1402, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) colorimetric assay. Absorbance was measured at 515 nm using a microplate reader (Thermo Electron, USA) until stable readings were obtained. Cell culture and drug treatment BEAS-2B and TC-1 cells were purchased from Jennio Biotech (Guangzhou, China). BEAS-2B cells were cultured in DMEM (12,800, Gibco, Carlsbad, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, SH30396.03, Hyclone, Logan, USA), while TC-1 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (31,800, Gibco, Carlsbad, USA) with 10% FBS. Both media contained 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. Cells were treated with 40 μM sotorasib for specified durations or with 20, 40, or 80 μM sotorasib for 30 h for viability and Western blot analyses. In some experiments, cells were co-treated with 10 μM Z-VAD-FMK (CAS: 161,401–82-7, MedChemExpress, Shanghai, China) or 20 μM hyperoside (T2844, Topscience, Shanghai, China). Immunofluorescence assay After treatment, cultured cells in 96-well plates were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA (P6148, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (B2064, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) in PBS at 37 °C for 30 min, then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After washing, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated secondary antibodies (A21206; 1:250, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (D212, Dojindo, Japan) for 5 min, and images were captured using a fluorescence microscope. MitoSOX assay BEAS-2B cells were stained with MitoSOX (M36008, Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. MitoSOX was dissolved in HBSS buffer (14,065,056, Gibco, USA) to prepare a 5 mM working solution. Cells were incubated with MitoSOX at 37 °C for 10 min, washed three times with HBSS, and counterstained with Hoechst (H3570, Invitrogen, USA) in the dark for 10 min. Images were captured using a fluorescence microscope. Transcriptomics Transcriptomic analysis and preliminary data interpretation were performed by LC-Bio Technology Co., Ltd. (Hangzhou, China). Total RNA was isolated and purified using TRIzol and quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000. RNA integrity was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100. Samples with RNA concentration > 50 ng/μL, RIN > 7.0, and total RNA > 1 μg were used for library preparation. mRNA was enriched using oligo(dT) beads, fragmented, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 in PE150 mode. Clean data were aligned to the reference genome, and gene expression quantification, GSEA, differential expression analysis, and enrichment analysis were performed. Untargeted lipidomics Lipidomic data analysis was performed by Shanghai Luming Biotechnology Co., Ltd.. Briefly, samples were transferred to 2 mL centrifuge tubes with 600 μL of methanol–water, followed by the addition of 600 μL chloroform. The mixture was sonicated in an ice bath and extracted by ice-water bath sonication for 10 min, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, 450 μL of the lower phase was transferred to LC–MS vials and dried. The lipid residue in the vials was reconstituted in 200 μL isopropanol-methanol (1:1, v/v), vortexed for 30 s, and sonicated in an ice-water bath for 3 min. The solution was transferred to 1.5 mL EP tubes, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and 150 μL of the supernatant was collected in LC–MS vials for analysis. Raw Q Exactive LC–MS/MS data were processed using LipidSearch software. Western blot Protein lysates were prepared from cells or lung tissues using lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris–HCl, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM EDTA, 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, 25 mM NaF, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.3% NP-40, 0.3% leupeptin, 0.1% NaVO3, and 0.1% PMSF). Proteins (30–50 μg per sample) were separated on 8%, 10%, or 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to 0.45 μm PVDF membranes (IPVH00010, Millipore Corporation, Boston, USA). Membranes were blocked with skim milk and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, followed by detection using the ECL Plus kit (P2300, NCM Biotech, Suzhou, China). Primary antibodies used included: cleaved PARP (ET1608-10, HuaBio, China), ACTB (db14040, Diagbio, Hangzhou, China), anti-fibronectin (#610,078, BD Biosciences, USA), GAPDH (5174S, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), PPARγ (#2435, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), FABP4 (12,802–1-AP, Proteintech, China), and anti-CPT1B (ab134988, Abcam, UK). Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) After specified treatments, cells were harvested using TRIzol reagent (15,596,026, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA). Equal amounts of RNA were reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA using a cDNA reverse transcription kit (AT311, TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using TB Green Premix Ex Taq (Tli RNaseH Plus, RR420A, Takara, Tokyo, Japan) on a QuantStudio 3 real-time PCR instrument (A28132, Applied Biosystems, Woodlands, Singapore).

Energy minimization was performed using the MMFF94 force field. Molecular docking was conducted using AutoDock Vina 1.2.3. Prior to docking, the receptor protein was processed with PyMol 2.5.5 to remove water molecules, salt ions, and Small molecules. A docking box was set to encompass the entire protein structure. Small molecules and the receptor protein were converted to the PDBQT format required by AutoDock Vina using ADFRsuite 1.0. Docking was performed with an exhaustiveness of 32, and default parameters were used for other settings. The highest-scoring docking conformation was considered the binding pose and visualized using PyMol 2.5.5. Sotorasib-biotin conjugation and biotin pull-down The conjugation of sotorasib to biotin was performed by Zoobio (China). Briefly, 44.0 mg biotin, 42.2 mg EDCI, and 29.7 mg HOBT were dissolved in 10 mL DMF and stirred at room temperature for 15 min. After adding 36.4 mg TEA, the reaction was continued for another 15 min. Subsequently, 100.0 mg sotorasib was added, and the reaction was stirred overnight. The reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). After completion, the solvent was evaporated, and 20 mL water was added. The mixture was sonicated for 3–5 min, filtered, and the residue was further purified by column chromatography to obtain the target compound. The product was validated by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) hydrogen spectroscopy. For the biotin pull-down assay, adherent cells were harvested using trypsin–EDTA, and proteins were extracted using Pierce™ IP Lysis Buffer (Thermo, #87,787) supplemented with cOmplete ULTRA Tablets, Mini, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, #05892970001). The lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to collect the supernatant. A mixture of 40 µM Sotorasib/biotin, Sotorasib + biotin, and 50 µL Bioeast Mag-SA was pre-incubated with 400 µg protein and 50 µL Bioeast Mag-SA at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein mixture was then added to the Sotorasib/biotin, Sotorasib + biotin, and Bioeast Mag-SA mixture, and the beads were resuspended and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, the beads were separated from the liquid using a magnetic stand, and the supernatant was carefully removed. The beads were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and the bound proteins were eluted using loading buffer for subsequent Western blot analysis. Plasmid construction PPARγ-WT and PPRE-H2B-eGFP (Addgene Plasmid #84,393) were purchased from Miaoling Biology (China). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara) to construct the PPARγ Thr325 deletion mutant, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Flow cytometry analysis For Annexin V-PI staining, BEAS-2B cells were seeded in 12-well plates (8 × 10 4 For ROS measurement, intracellular ROS levels were analyzed using the ROS Detection Kit (S0033S, Beyotime, Shanghai, China).
