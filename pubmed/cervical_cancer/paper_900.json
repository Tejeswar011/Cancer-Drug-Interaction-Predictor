This differentiation contributes to tissue remodelling and is implicated in the accumulation of fat and fibrotic tissue seen in neuromuscular, cardiovascular and degenerative diseases. FAPs also interact with other muscle cells and modulate inflammation, playing a central role in muscle degeneration across various disease contexts. This review summarises current knowledge on FAP adipogenic differentiation in muscle degeneration and regeneration, with a focus on cardiovascular and neuromuscular diseases, which share common features of impaired muscle remodelling.

FAPs are directly involved in muscle wasting and its replacement by fibrous and fat tissue. Because of this, FAPs have become a subject of interest in the study of neuromuscular diseases (Fernandez‐Simon et al., 2022 2019 2021 The physiological response to muscle damage involves an orchestrated reaction from different cell types such as satellite cells, inflammatory cells and FAPs. FAPs are key in the process of muscle regeneration, and are a primary source of fibroblasts and adipocytes in muscle (Wosczyna et al., 2019 In recent years, an increased body of research studying FAPs has promoted promising advances in the field of tissue remodelling. Currently, FAPs from human and murine origins can be easily identified and isolated by the presence of specific cell surface markers, such as platelet‐derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα/Pdgfrα) (human and mice) and stem cell antigen 1 or Sca‐1 2021 2019 In skeletal muscle muscle, the differentiation of FAPs into fibroblast increases the pool of cells with the ability to further differentiate into myofibroblast (α‐SMA + + 2021 2016 The commitment of FAPs into a fibroblast, adipocyte and osteocyte/chondrocyte cell type is influenced by paracrine and autocrine signals. Signalling pathways involved in these processes are: Wnt (Liu et al., 2016 2017 2017 2016 This review aims to synthesise the current literature to better understand the differentiation of FAPs into adipocytes. We begin by describing the role of FAPs (and adipogenesis) in muscle degeneration. We then examine current knowledge on the involvement of FAPs in the two major groups of diseases that share tissue remodelling as a common feature: cardiovascular and neuromuscular diseases. We also describe the current methods for culturing and differentiating FAPs into adipocytes in vitro Adipogenic differentiation of FAPs: implications for muscle regeneration and degeneration The differentiation of FAPs into adipocytes has been evidenced in diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), sarcopenia, neuromuscular diseases, obesity, glucocorticoid (GC) myopathy and rotator cuff tear. In these diseases, the loss of muscle mass is associated with an accumulation of fat in the extracellular compartment of the muscles (Fig. 1 2021 2019 2024 2010 Currently, there is a significant knowledge gap concerning the functional impact of IMAT in skeletal muscle. Given the clinical relevance of ectopic lipid accumulation, recent studies have increasingly focused on the adipogenic differentiation of FAPs. Moreover, there is growing interest in IMAT as a potential physical barrier to drug delivery, further highlighting the need to better understand its role in muscle pathology (Gouju & Legeay, 2023 Below, we examine the current knowledge about the role of adipogenic differentiation of FAPs in cardiovascular and neuromuscular diseases, comprising two group of diseases characterised by impaired tissue remodelling and ectopic fat deposition. Figure 1 Degenerative process in skeletal muscle Schematic of fibro‐fatty deposition in different stages of disease in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Created with BioRender.com. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) Obesity and T2D CVDs are the primary cause of death worldwide (World Health Organization, 2021 2020 The use of mouse models of diet‐induced obesity (DIO) have increased the understanding of molecular processes, such as ectopic lipid accumulation and lipid droplet formation (Fig. 2 2018 2023 2024 Thy1 + + As previously noted, infiltration of adipose tissue is a common feature in muscle of individuals with obesity and T2D (Freitas & Katsanos, 2022 2023 2023 2024 With the expansion of adipose tissue in obesity and diabetes, there is also upregulation of ECM proteins (Gliniak et al., 2023 2022 2024 2021 2024 2018 2020 2020 2019 2019 Figure 2 Ectopic lipid accumulation in muscle from DIO mice Wild‐type male mice (WT), adult (8–12 weeks old) were fed with chow (control) diet or a high‐fat diet (HFD) for 9 weeks. Assessment of lipid droplets accumulation was performed in cryosections of gastrocnemius muscle (20× magnification), using BODIPY (green) staining to identify neutral lipids. Created in part with BioRender.com. Myocardial infarction and arterial disease Numerous studies in the CVDs field have used fibroblast and myofibroblast from human, rat and mice models. However, it was not until recently that cardiac FAPs (cFAPs) were described and isolated for first time. A recent study identified differences in the fate of cFAPs depending on the type of cardiac damage that mice were subjected to. The results showed increased accumulation of adipocytes in the heart of mice (PDGFR + + Skeletal muscle regeneration is important in other CVDs, such as peripheral arterial disease. The development of chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) is an advanced clinical feature of the disease. CLTI is characterised by infiltration of adipose tissue in the limb and ectopic deposition of fat at intramuscular level (i.e. IMAT). Similar to neuromuscular diseases, this fat deposition leads to muscle dysfunction and ambulation problems. Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) NMDs are a group of rare genetic diseases that share symptoms such as muscle wasting and fibre degeneration. This review focuses on findings related with the adipogenic commitment of FAPs in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD and BMD) and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). A shared therapeutic goal across these diseases is to develop novel strategies that mitigate intramuscular fat infiltration, aiming to ameliorate muscle dysfunction. Duchenne and Becker musular dystrophy Clinical progression of DMD and BMD is characterised by loss of muscle fibres and accumulation of fibro‐fatty tissue in muscle, impairing patient's muscle function. Interestingly, the number of FAPs and adipocytes in muscles from patients with DMD is larger than in control individuals. These findings were identified using data from single nuclei RNA‐sequencing analysis performed in human muscle biopsies. In healthy individuals, the physiological response to muscle damage is well regulated and involves different cell types. However, in patients with DMD/BMD, the lack of the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex leads to muscle fibre injury during muscle contraction. This effect leads to increased sarcolemma permeability, calcium entry and the activation of proteases in the muscle (Zhou & Lu, 2010 + 3 2022 Figure 3 Increased fat accumulation in gastrocnemius muscle of patients with BMD Imaging mass cytometry: PLIN1 (white) on histology sections of a control (left) and a patient with BMD (right) sample. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy FSHD is another genetic muscular dystrophy, characterised by progressive weakness associated with muscle wasting and atrophy. Muscle biopsies of patients with FSHD show a strong inflammatory reaction associated with muscle fibre necrosis. Later on, this is followed by expansion of fibrotic and fat tissue in advanced stages of the disease. The role of FAPs in this process has started to be investigated (Bosnakovski et al., 2020 2012 2022 2022 2020 2023 To facilitate and advance the study of FAPs in these and related pathologies, we have compiled and synthesised key literature outlining current methodologies for culturing and inducing adipogenic differentiation of FAPs. Below, we provide a detailed overview of the culture reagents, along with the rationale behind their use. We also describe different culture systems employed for FAPs, including two‐dimensional (2D) and three‐dimensional (3D) platforms. Current methods for differentiation of FAPs into adipocytes The isolation of murine FAPs from muscle was first described by Joe et al. ( 2010 in vitro 2010 2022 The variety of protocols used to culture and induce adipogenic differentiation of FAPs from different species (e.g. human, bovine, mouse) (Buras et al., 2019 2020 2024 2021 2023 2010 2020 Maintenance The most common reagents and drugs used are summarised in Table 1 m 2021 2023 2010 2023 2021 2021 2023 2010 2020 2019 2021 2020 2018 Differentiation Within the molecules inducing adipogenesis, we commonly found insulin, a key adipogenic hormone (1–5 µg/mL); in addition to 3‐isobutyl‐1‐methylxanthine (IBMX) (0.25 µ m 2011 m Srebp1c Cebpa Fasn Acc Scd1 in vitro 2022 The number of days of differentiation to complete adipogenesis varies depending on the model (up to ∼30 days). Generally, the validation of the adipogenic fate is evidenced by the accumulation of lipid droplets, identified mostly by Oil red O (ORO) staining, PLIN1 immunofluorescence or neutral lipids staining (BODIPY). Key proteins involved in the differentiation of FAPs into adipocytes are PPARγ, CEBPα and AP2 or FABP4 (Cerquone Perpetuini et al., 2020 2021 2024 Table 1 FAP maintenance and differentiation media.

Different platforms for culturing FAPs There are different ways to culture FAPs in vitro ‘of choice’ 2017 2017 2022 2023 2017 2017 2022 2017 2017 2007 2012 2022 2022 2017 2022 The use of coatings in 2D cultures, usually based on ECM proteins, reduces the impact of hard surfaces on the cell behaviour of FAPs and other cell types. There is a wide range of available ECMs on the market, with the most common used in the culture of FAPs being gelatine, matrigel, collagen I (from rat), fibronectin and other ECMs with laminin as a major component (Farup et al., 2021 2023 2010 2019 2021 2016 2022 2013 The development of biomaterials in the last 20 years has promoted the generation of 3D cultures in the shape of microchips, microspheres and bundles (Fernandez‐Costa et al., 2021 2023 2020 2023 2021 2023 2023 in vitro 2022 2018 2018 2022 2010 Identifying FAP subpopulations with greater proadipogenic potential With the advance of contemporary technologies such FACS and RNA‐sequencing, the study of different cell populations has increased in myriad tissues. There is an increasing body of literature looking at different FAP subpopulations on different models of health and disease. Below, we focus on FAP subpopulations that have been shown to be associated with adipogenesis (Fig. 4 There are several studies using single cell RNA‐sequencing showing that, within the global population of FAPs, there are subpopulations enriched (or positive) for ‘specific’ genes of interest (Farup et al., 2021 2024 2023 2024 2018 2024 One of the subpopulations of FAPs identified in humans is CD90 THY‐1 CD90 h CD90 + CD90⁺ 2021 2019 CD90⁺ Fitzgerald et al.

However, further investigation is required to characterise FAP subpopulations with proadipogenic potential. In addition, insights from these studies suggest that distinct FAP clusters possess specialised characteristics and unique gene expression signatures, which may modulate their adipogenic capacity, either promoting or inhibiting this differentiation potential.

Although the differentiation of FAPs into a fibrogenic phenotype has been extensively studied, it is only in recent years that attention has shifted toward understanding the molecular pathways underlying FAPs adipogenesis. Targeting this differentiation will help to mitigate ectopic adipose tissue expansion in muscle and slow down muscle degeneration. In this section, we summarise and discuss key pathways that have been studied in recent years (Fig. 5 Figure 5 Signalling pathways regulating adipogenesis in FAPs Graphical summary of the main signalling pathways involved in the adipogenesis of FAPs. Created with BioRender.com. Wnt signalling Wnt comprose a group of glycoproteins with signalling properties. Wnt signalling is mediated, for example, by the binding to Frizzled receptor (Fzd) in the plasma membrane. In muscle, Wnt ligands play important role in both regeneration and homeostasis (Jones et al., 2015 2008 2010 2010 mdx 2020 2020 2023 Pparγ Cebpα 2011 2019 2023 2015 2023 2020 2020 2023 in vivo 2023 2024 2024 Wnt5a 2024 Ciliary Hedgehog signalling Similar to fibroblasts, FAPs are ciliated cells and their ciliation increases during muscle repair. Primary cilia comprise an immotile, microtubule‐based, antennae structure that acts as a sensing organelle. This mechanosensor transduces intercellular cues of myriad signalling pathways, such as Hedgehog (Hh), G protein‐coupled receptor, receptor tyrosine kinase, Wnt, TGF‐β and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways (Anvarian et al., 2019 2010 2021 2017 2023 Ift88 −/− mdx 2017 Timp3 Timp3 Mmp14 2017 2023 Dhh Gli1 Ptch1 Timp3 2023 Dhh 2023 Notch signalling The Notch pathway has been reported to regulate differentiation of ADSCs through Notch‐dependent and independent mechanisms. A recent study has shown that FAPs and satellite cells express Notch ligands. These ligands can regulate the adipogenic differentiation of FAPs via autocrine and juxtacrine mechanisms. This was demonstrated in FAPs isolated from muscle (WT mice) and cultured on plates coated with Notch ligand Delta‐like protein 1 (Dll1). The results showed decreased ORO‐positive cells and lower levels of PPARγ after 8 days in culture with adipogenic media (Marinkovic et al., 2019 2019 2010 mdx 2019 Protein kinase B (PI3K‐AKT) signalling PI3K‐AKT signalling has been widely studied in adipogenic differentiation in several experimental models, including 3T3‐L1 (murine preadipocytes) (Magun et al., 1996 2004 2021 2020 in vivo 2013 2015 2015 2023 2019 mdx 2019 2013 2023 2023 2019 Nitric oxide signalling Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical that plays a crucial role in maintaining skeletal muscle structure and function. It is synthesised by nitic oxide synthase in several tissues. In muscle, NO influences regeneration and regulates the survival, activation and differentiation of satellite cells (Anderson, 2000 2012 2014 2010 In vitro mdx 2014 mdx Fabp4 Pparγ Adipoq Cebpα 2014 Retinoic acid signalling Retinoids are vitamin A derivatives that play role in regulating mammalian cell growth, differentiation (Sato et al., 1980 1999 2015 2010 1980 1980 1999 2020 Fabp4 Cebpα Pparγ Cebpα Pparγ 2021 Pharmacological strategies to inhibit adipogenic differentiation of FAPs Within the past decade, new research interest has developed with respect to understanding the process of FAP adipogenic differentiation. The main aim is the identification of novel strategies that limit intramuscular fat accumulation in ageing and other pathological conditions (Matthews et al., 2025 2 Table 2 FAPs and role of adipogenesis in muscle degeneration.

Within these miRNAs are a group of small (∼18–25 bp long), single‐stranded RNA molecules that are able to control gene expression (post‐transcriptional level) (Ying et al., 2008 2020 2021 2024 Runx1 and Klf6 2020 2021 Pparγ 2020 2024 Anti‐fibrotic drugs Anti‐fibrotic drugs work mostly by targeting the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, which are involved in ECM remodelling. The development of these drugs has focused on several pathological conditions, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis and cystic fibrosis (Zhao et al., 2022 2017 2022 2016 fabp4 plin1) Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a role in adipogenesis by remodelling ECM (Mariman & Wang, 2010 2017 Adipoq Plin Pparγ 2017 2017 2023 2017 2023 2023 2019 2023 Overall, it is important to further evaluate whether the effects of these and other anti‐fibrotic drugs with respect to reducing the fibrogenic fate of FAPs occur at the expense of an increased adipogenic potential. Metabolic modifiers These are compounds that alter the metabolic profile of the cell and/or tissues, such as anti‐diabetic drugs, phytochemicals and hormone receptor antagonists (Luo et al., 2023 2015 2012 CD90+ SKL‐14959 is another metabolic modifier and a glucose‐dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor antagonist. SKL‐14959 has shown to suppress intramuscular adipose tissue in murine models of sarcopenia (Takahashi et al., 2023 in vitro Pparγ Fabp4 Overall, these studies suggest that various therapeutics may play a role in regulating FAP differentiation into adipocytes. However, most of these compounds have been studied primarily in vitro Conclusions Since 2010, studies in FAPs have increased exponentially. The plasticity and the diverse differentiation potential of FAPs has attracted study in the fields of ageing, neuromuscular disease, skeletal conditions and cardiovascular disease (both in vitro in vivo) in vitro To conclude, we consider it important to highlight two major research gaps: the need for a deeper understanding of FAP subpopulations and the limited knowledge surrounding the molecular pathways and pharmacological interventions that regulate their differentiation. As a result of advances in omics technologies, an increased body of literature has emerged contributing to our understanding of FAP subpopulations. However, most findings focus on the identification of fibrogenic subpopulations ( Lum CD55 There are numerous studies aimed at elucidating the molecular pathways that drive FAPs differentiation into adipocytes and identifying new interventions to target their adipogenic potential. However, most of these studies are conducted in vitro in vivo mdx Lastly, the study of potential drugs to slow down or inhibit adipogenesis in FAPs has increased in recent years. This presents as an opportunity to advance the field of muscle degeneration and other related fields. However, the effect of these drugs in human FAPs remains to be determined.
