This article presents a rare case of renal metastasis from papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with concurrent lung and bone metastases. Through a retrospective analysis of the patient’s diagnostic and treatment process, we aim to contribute to the development of precise treatment strategies for such rare cases, thereby improving patient prognosis. thyroid cancer renal metastasis lung metastasis bone metastasis radioactive iodine-125 seed The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Its incidence has shown a rapid upward trend over the past few decades. Thyroid cancer is classified into four main pathological types: Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC), Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma (FTC), Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma (ATC), and Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC) ( 1 2 3 4 A 48-year-old female patient presents with a chronic oncological condition. She underwent a partial nephrectomy of the right renal space-occupying lesion in December 2024 after a tumor in the right kidney (  Figures 1A, B  Figures 2  3  Figures 1C, D Figure 1 A soft tissue nodule is present in the lower pole cortex of the right kidney, with increased glucose metabolism. A neoplastic lesion cannot be ruled out. (A) (B) (C) (D) Four-panel medical imaging comparison. Panel (a) shows a CT scan of the abdomen with a yellow arrow pointing at an area. Panel (b) displays a PET/CT scan, highlighting the same area in red. Panel (c) presents a chest CT scan with an arrow indicating a specific location. Panel (d) features a PET/CT scan of the chest with a similar area highlighted in red. Figure 2 The increased glucose metabolism in the eighth thoracic vertebra is consistent with the imaging manifestations of a metastatic tumor. (A) (B) (C) (D) Four-panel medical imaging with CT and PET-CT scans. Panel (a) shows a CT scan of the upper abdomen with a yellow arrow pointing to a lesion. Panel (b) is the corresponding PET-CT scan highlighting increased uptake in the same area. Panel (c) is a CT scan of the lower abdomen with another lesion indicated by a yellow arrow. Panel (d) shows the corresponding PET-CT scan with increased uptake in the same region. Figure 3 The iliac bone on the right side demonstrates bone destruction accompanied by the formation of a surrounding soft tissue mass, with involvement of the adjacent sacroiliac joint and iliac wing of the sacrum. Increased glucose metabolism is observed, which is consistent with the radiological manifestations of metastatic tumors. (A) (B) CT scan images in two panels, labeled a and b, show cross-sections of the abdomen. Both panels have yellow arrows pointing to a specific area on the left side. In panel a, the area appears as a light mass, while in panel b, it shows increased brightness, possibly indicating high activity or enhancement. In October 2024, the patient presented to the orthopedic department with intermittent low back pain and was diagnosed with suspected secondary malignant tumors in multiple bones upon examination. In October 2024, the patient underwent a biopsy of bone destruction in the right pelvis, and the postoperative pathology indicated bone metastasis from thyroid cancer (  Figures 4B  5B 5  Figures 4A  5A Figure 4 Pathology: (Right kidney tumor): Metastatic thyroid papillary carcinoma was found within the renal tissue. (A) (B) Histological images showing two panels: Panel a displays a section with dense cellular structures and fibrous tissue, stained purple and pink. Panel b shows a section with tubular structures and a pink-stained region, possibly bone or cartilage. Both are stained using standard histological methods. Figure 5 Immunohistochemical staining shows positive expression of Thyroglobulin (Tg) in the tumor cells (brown). Positive signals are localized in the cytoplasm. (Right kidney tumor) (A) (B) Two microscopic images labeled “a” and “b” show tissue sections with complex structures. Both images feature dense, branching patterns with brown staining, set against a lighter background, possibly indicating specific protein expressions or cell types. Physical Examination: No bulging was observed in the bilateral renal regions, and no tenderness or percussion pain was noted. There was no tenderness along the course of the bilateral ureters, and no tenderness was detected in the bladder area. Discussion Papillary thyroid carcinoma primarily metastasizes through the lymphatic system. Tumor cells can migrate via lymphatic vessels to cervical lymph nodes, including those in the central and lateral neck regions. Hematogenous spread to distant organs is less common, and it is even rarer for distant metastases to be the initial presenting symptom. Among the less common distant metastatic sites, the lungs are included. The cervical lymph nodes are the most frequent sites of metastasis ( 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Here, we present a rare case of renal metastasis from papillary thyroid carcinoma. The patient presented with concurrent metastases involving the pulmonary parenchyma, skeletal system, and kidneys. Given the patient’s condition, we prioritized symptomatic treatment. The patient experienced a right gluteal mass with worsening pain, accompanied by right iliac bone destruction and a surrounding soft tissue mass. Multi-Disciplinary Treatment discussion clinical manifestations, physical examination, and imaging findings, surgical intervention was deemed appropriate. The patient subsequently underwent exploratory surgery with curettage, microwave ablation, and bone cement augmentation for the right pelvic lesion. Concurrently, due to identified destructive changes in the left 9th rib with associated soft tissue mass and radiographic evidence of metastatic involvement in the T8 vertebral body, CT-guided 125 Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.
