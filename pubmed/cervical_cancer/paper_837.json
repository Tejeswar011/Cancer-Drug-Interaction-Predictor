Introduction Heterocycles, especially those containing nitrogen atoms, are vital targets in organic synthesis. Indeed, these ring structures have garnered considerable attention due to their prevalence in numerous physiologically active compounds. 1 2 Fig. 1 3–5 Fig. 1 Commercially available drugs containing N-heterocyclic ring systems. To date, several methods have been developed for synthesizing heterocyclic compounds, which tend to employ expensive resources such as gold, palladium, and other costly materials, along with catalysts that are harmful to the environment. 6–13 Although numerous attempts have been made to prepare N-heterocycles, conventional routes remained ineffective. 14–18 19 20–25 26–28 29 This review therefore aims to highlight the contemporary use of non-conventional protocols for the synthesis of N-heterocycles with potential biological activities via 30–34 1.1 Limitations of traditional synthetic approaches for N-heterocycles Traditional synthetic approaches for N-heterocycles, such as the Skraup, Paal–Knorr, Fischer, Debus–Radziszewski, and Hantzsch reactions, frequently encounter multiple intrinsic drawbacks. Such protocols generally necessitate high temperatures and extended reaction durations, along with the requirement for strong acids, dehydrating substances, or oxidizing agents, ultimately resulting in competitive side reactions, low atom efficiencies, and reduced selectivities. 35,36 1.2 Microwave-assisted synthesis Microwave (MW) irradiation is particularly advantageous in the preparation of physiologically relevant N-heterocycles, resulting in higher yields but a lower environmental impact than conventional thermal methods. 37–41 42–44 e.g. δ ε ε 45 46 47 MW-assisted reactions demonstrate significant advantages in terms of the reaction speed, efficiency, and selectivity. The effectiveness of a MW-assisted reaction largely depends on the ability of the reaction mixture to absorb MW energy, which is influenced by the choice of solvent and its loss tangent ( δ Commonly utilized systems include the CEM Discover SP, Biotage Initiator+, Anton Paar Monowave 400, and Milestone Ethos EASY, all of which are designed for safe and efficient chemical synthesis. These reactors can handle reaction scales ranging from a few milligrams to 30–100 grams, depending on the vessel type and system configuration. Method development often involves smaller scales (5–100 mg), while multi-vessel or batch systems facilitate medium scale (0.1–5 g) and larger scale (up to ∼100 g) processes. 1.3 Sonochemical synthesis The application of ultrasonic irradiation represents a new field of study that employs waves with frequencies ranging between 20 kHz and 1 MHz. 48,49 50–55 1.4 Mechanochemical synthesis Mechanochemical techniques are becoming more widely adopted as greener synthetic methods in response to the need for safer and cleaner chemical processes. While the significance of solvents in the extraction and purification steps remains crucial, mechanochemical techniques have been demonstrated to promote reactant interactions while improving the extent of reaction control and temperature management. The potential value in reducing solvent usage has also been recognized. Ball milling represents a frequently used technique in mechanochemistry, wherein mechanical forces ( e.g. 29 Commonly utilized equipment includes the Retsch PM100 and PM400 planetary mills, the Retsch MM400 mixing mill, and the Fritsch Pulverisette 7 planetary micro mill, all of which can operate at varied speeds and accommodate different jar sizes (10–500 mL). These mills can handle reaction scales ranging from a few tens of milligrams to several tens of grams, depending on the jar volume and ball-to-powder ratio. The reactions are carried out in jars constructed of stainless steel, zirconia, agate, or tungsten carbide, generally under ambient or inert atmospheres. 1.5 Solvothermal synthesis The solution-based synthetic approach known as solvothermal synthesis entails conducting chemical reactions in a closed system at high pressures and temperatures, usually above the standard boiling point of the solvent. Metal oxides, metal chalcogenides, coordination complexes, metal–organic frameworks, and other functional nanostructures 56,57 19 Solvothermal techniques are particularly useful in the preparation of bioactive heterocycles because they are more efficient and selective than traditional synthetic approaches. Furthermore, these methods can reduce energy consumption and lower solvent volumes, rendering them more sustainable and greener options. 58,59 2. N-heterocycles with anticancer activity Anticancer molecules are compounds that inhibit or destroy cancer cells by targeting specific cellular pathways. They work through various mechanisms, including DNA intercalation, enzyme inhibition, apoptosis induction, and angiogenesis suppression. Common classes include alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and N-heterocycles, as well as synthetic agents such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and platinum-based drugs. These molecules form the basis of chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted cancer treatments. 60–62 2.1 Microwave-assisted synthesis of anticancer agents 2.1.1 Pyrrole Numerous traditional methods exist for synthesizing pyrroles, including the Knorr, Paal–Knorr, Hantzsch condensation, and Clauson–Kaas reactions. However, when carried out using conventional heating approaches, these methods often demand harsh reaction and work-up conditions, which can negatively affect the product yields. In contrast, newer protocols utilizing MW irradiation offer significant improvements in the efficiency of such reactions. For example, in 2018, Manta et al. Scheme 1 63 Scheme 1 MV-assisted synthesis of various new 3-hydroxy-3-pyrrolin-2-ones 9. Among the various synthesized compounds, 9a demonstrated the most promising activity against leukemia cells. Additionally, pyrrole derivatives bearing cyclobutyl substituents exhibited increased efficacies against cervical carcinoma and leukemia, particularly when paired with halogen atoms such as chlorine or iodine ( cf. para 2.1.2 Piperidine The MW-assisted synthesis of piperidines offers faster reactions, higher yields, and improved selectivities under milder reaction conditions.

Common routes to pyrazoles include the cyclocondensation of hydrazines with 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds or enones, thereby rendering MW irradiation a valuable tool for efficient pyrazole synthesis in medicinal chemistry.

It was demonstrated that when a hydrogen atom ( cf. 1 3 2.1.6 Imidazole Conventional routes to imidazole typically require prolonged heating, strong acids, or dehydrating agents, and often result in moderate yields along with side product formation. MW-assisted synthesis overcomes these limitations by enabling rapid, uniform heating, thereby reducing reaction times, improving yields and selectivities, and allowing solvent-free or greener conditions to be employed.

N N 69 Scheme 8 Scheme 8 Synthesis of N The proposed reaction mechanism begins with the nucleophilic attack of benzamidoxime 32 on DCC, forming intermediate 35. The reaction proceeds through a transition state 36, and is accelerated by DMF due to its high dielectric constant, which renders this solvent more reactive under MW irradiation. Solvent-facilitated proton transfer then leads to the elimination of cyclohexylamine, yielding the final product 34 ( Scheme 9 Scheme 9 Plausible reaction pathway for the synthesis of 1,2,4-oxadiazole derivatives 34. The cytotoxic activities of the samples were subsequently evaluated using the MTT assay. Specifically, they were tested at concentrations of 100 μM for HCT-116 cells and 25 μM for the other cell lines. After dilution in the culture media, the compounds were added to each well, and the MTT assay was employed to determine the IC 50 meta 50 2.1.8 Quinolines Traditional synthetic approaches to quinoline, such as the Skraup and Friedländer reactions, often require strong acids, high temperatures, and extended durations, resulting in safety issues and limited efficiencies. MW-assisted synthesis offers a technically superior alternative by providing rapid thermal activation, enhanced yields, reduced reaction times, and improved functional group tolerances under milder and often solvent-free conditions.

N-heterocycles with antimicrobial activities N-heterocyclic compounds exhibit remarkable antimicrobial properties by targeting key pathways that are essential for microbial survival and growth.

This promotes a faster, solvent-free reaction with a high efficiency, and the nanocatalyst can be easily recovered and reused, thereby supporting the principles of green synthesis. 7. N-heterocycles with antitubercular activities Nitrogen-containing ring-structured N-heterocyclic compounds have been demonstrated to exhibit potent anti-mycobacterial action. Specifically, scaffolds such as triazoles, pyridines, and quinolines interfere with various bacterial processes, including DNA replication and cell wall construction. Two important examples of such compounds are bedaquiline and isoniazid. The potencies and structural adaptabilities of these substances render them essential for the development of TB drugs. 116,117 7.1 Sonochemical synthesis of antitubercular agents 7.1.1 Pyrazole Venkateswara et al.

Conclusions In conclusion, although non-conventional synthetic techniques, such microwave- and ultrasound-assisted procedures have numerous advantages, they also exhibit various limitations. Specifically, the requirement for specialized equipment, which may raise initial costs and necessitate technical expertise, is one of the main disadvantages. These techniques may also be less scalable, thereby rendering them less appropriate for use in large-scale industrial manufacturing. An inconsistent product quality may also result from the possibility of hot patches or uneven heating during microwave synthesis. Furthermore, ultrasonic bath reactions frequently suffer from poor reproducibilities due to differences in the bath layouts and a lack of standardized control over the ultrasonic power. Despite these challenges, there are numerous benefits to non-conventional approaches. For example, these methods greatly shorten the reaction times, increase yields, and lead to improved selectivities compared with those achieved using conventional synthetic methods. Moreover, through the use of reduced solvent volumes and lower extents of energy consumption, they also provide more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient alternatives. Consequently, non-conventional routes tend to be more efficient, sustainable, and reproducible than traditional approaches, which is particularly significant for the rapid and effective synthesis of bioactive molecules. In this review, the preparation of a range of N-heterocyclic compounds using non-conventional synthetic techniques was examined. The findings of this review suggest that such approaches offer numerous advantages, including higher yields, a reduced environmental impact, and enhanced selectivities. The biological activities of the synthesized N-heterocyclic compounds were subsequently evaluated, revealing noteworthy potential in various applications due to their antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities. Microwave-assisted routes yielded compounds with enhanced potencies and selectivities, highlighting their potential for use as drug candidates in diverse therapeutic applications. Overall, this review highlights the significance of non-traditional synthetic approaches as effective and sustainable strategies for the production of biologically active N-heterocyclic compounds. The presented results pave the way for new opportunities in drug discovery and in the development of novel pharmaceuticals. Nonetheless, further work in this field should concentrate on enhancing the reproducibility, including through the use of continuous-flow and extrusion technologies, along with the integration of artificial intelligence and in situ 10. Future development on non-conventional synthesis techniques 10.1 Microwave assisted synthesis (MAOS) Anticipated advancements in microwave-assisted synthesis are likely to transition from fixed-frequency setups to variable-frequency and tailored field irradiation, facilitating more precise control over energy distribution. The design of reactors will emphasize the development of rational catalyst supports, microwave-transparent flow cells, and hybrid technologies that integrate microwave energy with induction heating, ultrasound, or photo redox activation. Furthermore, the incorporation of digital twin models is expected to enable predictive design and reliable scale-up, thereby mitigating the current challenges of non-uniform heating and poor reproducibility. 10.2 Sonochemical synthesis The future of sonochemistry will predominantly focus on the utilization of multi-frequency, pulsed, and chirped ultrasonic waves to achieve programmable cavitation. This approach will facilitate precise control over bubble collapse and radical synthesis. Additionally, it is anticipated that hybrid systems, such as sonophotocatalysis and sonoelectrochemistry, will become prevalent for complex oxidation processes and selective reactions. These systems will be enhanced by specially engineered reactor surfaces that concentrate cavitation effects at catalyst interfaces. 10.3 Mechanochemical synthesis Mechanochemistry is expected to progress beyond traditional ball milling techniques, advancing towards resonant acoustic mixing and continuous, recipe-controlled extrusion. These developments will offer scalable methods for the preparation of complex materials and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The integration of operando The progression of these non-conventional methodologies will depend on the establishment of standardized process analytical technologies (PAT), the integration of real-time sustainability metrics and life-cycle assessments, and the implementation of unified reporting protocols to ensure reproducibility. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are anticipated to play a pivotal role in optimizing reaction conditions by correlating waveform, field, or mechanical inputs with desired outcomes. Additionally, the development of modular hybrid systems that integrate mechanical, acoustic, microwave, photochemical, and electrochemical methodologies will enhance the synthetic repertoire. Collectively, these innovations will facilitate reproducible, scalable, and environmentally sustainable chemical transformations that exceed the limitations of traditional synthetic strategies.
