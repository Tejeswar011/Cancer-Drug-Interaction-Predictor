Introduction Hypertension, a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), affects over 1.28 billion people worldwide, with a notable prevalence in middle-aged and elderly populations [ 1 2 3 4 Although current antihypertensive drugs can effectively lower blood pressure, they often cause notable side effects and fail to address key pathological factors such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular remodeling [ 5 6 7 8 2 9 10 Taxifolin (dihydroquercetin), a natural flavanonol found in plants such as Siberian larch and milk thistle seeds, possesses potent antioxidant activity. It exhibits various pharmacological effects, including vasodilatory and antioxidant properties, with minimal toxicity [ 6 7 8 11 12 15 12 7 13 Given the limitations of current antihypertensive therapies and the urgent need for drugs that can both lower blood pressure and protect vascular health, exploring the therapeutic potential of Taxifolin is of significant clinical importance [ 12 14 15 2. Result 2.1. Network Pharmacology and Molecular Docking Analysis 2.1.1. Screening of Active Components and Targets of Taxifolin Using the TCMSP database and text mining, seven entries associated with Taxifolin were retrieved. One entry was excluded according to the screening criteria in Section 4 2.1.2. Construction of Drug–Disease–Target Network By intersecting the Taxifolin targets with hypertension-related targets, 17 common targets were identified and visualized using a Venn diagram ( Figure 1 Figure 1 2.1.3. Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Network and Core Gene Screening To establish the PPI network, the 17 overlapping targets were analyzed via the STRING resource, applying a high-confidence cutoff value greater than 0.90. The network consisted of 21 nodes and 74 connections ( Figure 1 Figure 1 2.1.4. Gene Ontology (GO) Analysis GO enrichment analysis was performed using the clusterProfiler R package (version 4.16.0), focusing on Biological Processes (BP), Cellular Components (CC), and Molecular Functions (MF) with a significance threshold of p Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 2.1.5. KEGG Pathway Enrichment Analysis Twenty-six pathways were identified as enriched through KEGG analysis and found to be associated with the antihypertensive effects of Taxifolin. The most notable pathways included lipid and atherosclerosis, adipocytokine signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, NF-kappa B signaling, IL-17 signaling, TNF signaling, platelet activation, and regulation of lipolysis in adipocytes. These pathways were ranked based on ascending p Figure 3 2.1.6. Molecular Docking Molecular docking studies revealed that Taxifolin binds favorably to both PIK3CG and PTGS2, with binding energies of −9.7 kcal/mol and −8.9 kcal/mol, respectively. Two-dimensional interaction analyses indicated that Taxifolin forms van der Waals contacts with surrounding residues in both active sites. The PIK3CG binding pocket is primarily composed of hydrophobic residues (Tyr, Trp, Phe, Leu), while PTGS2 features both hydrophobic (Leu, Pro) and polar (His, Cys) amino acids. These environments underscore the significance of hydrophobic interactions in stabilizing the complexes. Taxifolin also forms hydrogen bonds with Tyr787, Leu657, and Trp201 in PIK3CG, and with Cys26 and Cys32 in PTGS2. In addition, it exhibits π–π interactions with the aromatic residues Phe, Tyr, and Trp in PIK3CG, which may influence fluorescence quenching, and π–alkyl interactions with Leu38, Pro39, and Cys21 in PTGS2. Together, these diverse interactions contribute to the overall specificity and stability of the Taxifolin–protein complexes ( Figure 3 2.2. The Vasorelaxant Effects of Taxifolin Were Evaluated Using Isolated Rat Aortic Rings First, as summarized in Table 1 Figure 4 Regarding KCl-induced contractions: in arterial rings previously stimulated by KCl, Taxifolin’s relaxation capacity was further diminished, with Rmax decreasing markedly to 62.26%. This result implies the involvement of voltage-dependent calcium channels ( Figure 4 Furthermore, pretreatment with atropine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist) and propranolol (a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist) led to a further reduction in the vasorelaxant activity of Taxifolin. Specifically, atropine reduced the effect to 63.1%, while propranolol reduced it to 69.7%. These findings indicate that muscarinic receptors and β-adrenergic receptors are involved in the mechanism underlying Taxifolin-induced vasorelaxation ( Figure 4 For endothelium-dependent assays, aortic rings with intact endothelium were exposed to indomethacin, L-NAME, ODQ, or methylene blue before testing. At a Taxifolin concentration of 1.5 mg/mL, L-NAME and indomethacin markedly reduced vasorelaxation compared with controls, whereas ODQ treatment resulted in only a modest decrease, with relaxation levels of 72.7% and 96.04% in ODQ-treated and control rings, respectively ( p Figure 4 Additionally, the influence of K + 2 + 2 2 p Figure 4 Additional studies were performed to characterize how Taxifolin regulates intracellular calcium release and extracellular calcium entry. The endothelial integrity of the aortic rings—either preserved or removed—was a key determinant in defining the contribution of calcium channels to Taxifolin-mediated relaxation. Calcium was incrementally added in concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 10 mM to induce a dose-dependent contraction in rings with intact endothelium. Figure 4 2+ Figure 4 p p These findings suggest that, in addition to limiting calcium influx through plasma membrane channels, Taxifolin also exerts a direct inhibitory effect on calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via IP3 receptors (IP3R). This dual mechanism highlights the potential of Taxifolin as a vasodilator, capable of reducing vascular smooth muscle contraction through comprehensive inhibition of calcium channels. An evaluation of Taxifolin’s vasorelaxation potency and peak response was performed across the experimental conditions. For each group, EC 50 Table 1 2.3. Taxifolin Significantly Increased Nitric Oxide (NO) Levels and Activated Multiple Vasodilatory Pathways in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRs) The findings demonstrate that Taxifolin significantly increased the NO levels in the aortic vascular tissues of SHRs ( Figure 5 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 2.4. In Vivo Antihypertensive Effects of Taxifolin on Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRs) 2.4.1. Antihypertensive Effect of Taxifolin on Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats In SHRs, Taxifolin administered daily for four weeks dose-dependently reduced SBP, DBP, and MAP. At doses of 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg, the reduction in SBP was 188.34 ± 4.05, 162.25 ± 4.33, and 132.38 ± 3.14 mmHg, respectively. Very similar significant decreases were obtained in both DBP and MAP in comparison to the negative control group. Even at their lowest dose, a meaningful decrease was observed by the fourth week ( Figure 6 2.4.2. Toxicological Evaluation of Taxifolin Over the 28-day treatment period, Taxifolin showed no adverse effects on the general behavior or activity levels of the SHRs. The rats displayed normal behavior with no signs of distress or lethargy, indicating that Taxifolin did not negatively impact their central nervous system or overall well-being. Body weights remained consistent across all groups, suggesting no interference with metabolic functions or growth ( Figure 6 No mortalities were recorded at any dose level up to 60 mg/kg, demonstrating good tolerability. Hematological and biochemical parameters—including liver and kidney function assessments—remained within normal reference range. These results indicate that Taxifolin is well-tolerated and safe at the tested doses, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent for hypertension without significant toxicity ( Table 2 3. Discussion This research thoroughly explored how Taxifolin, a natural flavonoid with strong antioxidant and vascular protective activities, mediates its blood pressure-lowering effects. The antihypertensive effects and underlying mechanisms of Taxifolin were elucidated through network pharmacology, molecular docking, and both ex vivo aortic ring assays and in vivo studies. Two key targets, PIK3CG and PTGS2, were specifically validated based on predictions from network pharmacology. The overall experimental workflow and the key signaling pathways validated are summarized and presented in Figure S1 Previous studies have demonstrated that PIK3CG and PTGS2 (COX-2) play key roles in endothelial function and cardiovascular homeostasis by modulating inflammatory responses and promoting vasodilation [ 16 17 2 18 19 20 The central role of eNOS in mediating vasorelaxation was further substantiated by the significant reduction in Taxifolin-induced vasodilation upon eNOS inhibition with L-NAME. Taxifolin also elevated both eNOS expression and NO production. Phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, which serves as a classical marker of PI3K/Akt pathway activation [ 21 19 22 19 23 24 25 To further support the mechanistic insights obtained from network pharmacology and functional assays, GO enrichment analysis was conducted. Notably, biological process terms such as “response to angiotensin,” “prostaglandin metabolic processes,” and “regulation of muscle system processes” are directly associated with blood pressure control and vascular tone modulation, aligning with findings related to NO and PGI 2 26 27 28 29 30 31 It is well established that NO initiates the NO signaling cascade by activating sGC, which catalyzes the conversion of GTP to cGMP. The resulting increase in intracellular cGMP promotes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation, positioning this pathway as a central regulator of vascular tone [ 32 1 2 2 The participation of potassium channels was evident from the strong inhibitory effect of glibenclamide, a K-ATP channel blocker, on Taxifolin-induced vasorelaxation. These channels regulate membrane potential and calcium influx, which are essential for vascular tone modulation [ 33 34 This study also has some limitations. First, although functional assays showed inhibition of Ca 2+ 2+ 35 Figure 4 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Animal Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 200–240 g were used in the ex vivo aortic ring experiments, while spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) weighing 200–220 g were used in both the in vivo antihypertensive study and the sub-chronic toxicity evaluation. A total of 80 SD rats and 40 SHRs were used in this study. The rats were accommodated in environmentally regulated facilities, where a 12 h photoperiod was maintained, and food and water were available without restriction [ 36 37 4.2. Network Analysis of Taxifolin’s Potential Mechanisms Against Hypertension In this study, network pharmacology combined with molecular docking was employed to clarify how Taxifolin may act against hypertension through potential mechanistic pathways. The active constituents of Taxifolin were retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) platform, followed by screening based on oral bioavailability ≥ 30% and drug-likeness ≥ 0.18 [ 38 39 40 41 42 For these compounds, potential protein targets were extracted from the TCMSP resource and translated into gene symbols via UniProt annotation. To illustrate the compound–target associations, a network framework was established in Cytoscape 3.7.1. Genes related to hypertension were screened from GeneCards and DrugBank databases based on searches using the keyword “hypertension”. Overlapping targets between Taxifolin and hypertension were identified using a Venn diagram generated with ImageGP 1 [ 43 44 The STRING resource (interaction confidence > 0.9; organism restricted to Homo sapiens) was utilized to construct a PPI network based on the shared targets, which was subsequently analyzed in Cytoscape using the CytoNCA tool to identify key hub genes through network topology assessment [ 45 46 P48736 P35354 47 48 The identified targets underwent GO term enrichment and KEGG pathway evaluation, implemented via the R packages clusterProfiler and org.Hs.eg.db. The resulting bubble diagrams depicted key functional roles and signaling cascades relevant to these targets [ 38 49 50 4.3. Experimental Procedures for Assessing Taxifolin’s Vasorelaxant Mechanisms in Rat Aortic Rings Chemicals and drugs used in this study included the following, along with their respective functions and suppliers: indomethacin (10 µM, cyclooxygenase inhibitor, Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA), L-NAME (10 µM, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA), ODQ (10 µM, soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, MedChemExpress, Shanghai, China), methylene blue (10 µM, cGMP pathway inhibitor, Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA), atropine (1 µM, muscarinic receptor antagonist, Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA), propranolol hydrochloride (1 µM, β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, MedChemExpress, Shanghai, China), tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA) (1 mM, non-selective calcium-activated K + + 2 + + 3 3 2 2 4 4 51 52 53 Taxifolin was prepared by dissolving 100 mg in distilled water containing 25% DMSO, with final experimental concentrations ranging from 0.1875 to 3 mg/mL. Fresh Krebs’ solution, prepared separately before every experiment with analytical-grade chemicals, had the following final concentrations: 118.0 mM NaCl, 25.0 mM NaHCO 3 2 2 4 4 54 55 Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 200–240 g were used for ex vivo aortic ring assays. All experiments were independently repeated eight times (n = 8 rings per condition). Rings were randomly assigned to experimental groups for each assay, including initial validation experiments (Taxifolin, vehicle control and blank control), endothelium dependency and calcium channel involvement assays (endothelium-intact PE-precontracted rings, endothelium-denuded PE-precontracted rings, and endothelium-intact KCl-precontracted rings), inhibitor studies (paired control rings without inhibitors and rings pre-incubated with respective inhibitors), and calcium-related experiments [ 51 Aortic rings were prepared from rats euthanized by CO 2 2 2 54 56 Endothelial integrity was assessed by first contracting rings with phenylephrine (PE, 1 µM) for 10 min and subsequently adding acetylcholine (ACh, 1 µM) for 5 min. Rings showing more than 60% relaxation after ACh administration were regarded as possessing intact endothelium, whereas those with <10% relaxation were classified as endothelium-depleted. Following this assessment, the rings underwent three consecutive rinses in Krebs’ solution freshly prepared for each wash, with 10 min allocated per rinse. This endothelial integrity test was conducted for all rings before proceeding with any experiment [ 57 For inhibitor studies, each experiment involved paired groups: control rings (without inhibitor pre-incubation, treated only with Taxifolin) and rings pre-incubated with respective inhibitors for 20 min. Following pre-incubation, rings were contracted with PE (1 µM) and allowed to stabilize for 30 min. Taxifolin was then cumulatively added at 20 min intervals (final concentrations: 0.1875, 0.375, 0.75, 1.5, and 3 mg/mL). Vasorelaxant responses were recorded to evaluate inhibitor modulation effects [ 58 Calcium channel experiments involved separate groups: after stabilization in normal Krebs’ solution, the rings were immersed in calcium-depleted Krebs’ buffer to which EGTA (0.2 mM) had been added, followed by a 10 min incubation [ 59 2 60 Intracellular calcium release experiments utilized endothelium-denuded rings, pre-incubated with either Taxifolin or 2-APB for 20 min prior to PE addition. Contractile responses were measured and compared with untreated control rings [ 61 Isometric tension changes were measured using a precision force transducer, amplified by a Quad Bridge Amp, digitized by a PowerLab 26T (ADInstruments, Bella Vista, Australia), and recorded and analyzed using LabChart-5 software. Vasorelaxation was quantified as percentage relaxation relative to the PE-induced contraction using the following formula: P e r c e n t a g e  o f  r e l a x a t i o n = ( B − A ) − ( C − A ) B − A × 100 % A B C 62 63 4.4. Ex Vivo Incubation of Rat Aortic Tissues for Mechanistic Analysis of Vasodilatory Signaling Pathways The experiment of the ex vivo incubation and analysis of rat thoracic aorta tissues was designed to determine the expression level of nitric oxide (NO) and associated signaling proteins. A series of separate experiments were conducted to investigate distinct mechanistic pathways. For the assessment of Akt phosphorylation using Western blot, three experimental groups were formed from the aortic rings: control, Taxifolin (3 mg/mL), and Taxifolin combined with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μM). For cGMP quantification by ELISA, three groups were used: control, Taxifolin, and Taxifolin with the sGC inhibitor ODQ (10 μM). For 6-keto-PGF 1 Protein extraction was carried out by homogenizing vascular tissues in 1 mL of pre-chilled RIPA buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) enriched with 1 mM PMSF and a protease inhibitor mixture. The resulting homogenates underwent ultrasonic disruption on ice at 25% amplitude (three 30 s bursts, interspersed with 30 s pauses) to maximize cell lysis. Following this, the lysates were centrifuged at 12,000× g 64 65 Additional ELISA assays were performed to quantify cGMP and 6-keto-PGF 1 1 65 In a separate experiment, to assess nitric oxide (NO) levels in vascular tissues, SHR aortic rings with intact endothelium were treated with Taxifolin at concentrations of 0.75 mg/mL, 1.5 mg/mL, or 3 mg/mL. Control rings received 10% DMSO. Tissue NO levels were determined using the Griess reaction. Supernatants were collected, and a standard curve was generated with nitrite concentrations of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 μM (in triplicate). For NO detection, 100 μL aliquots of each sample were loaded into a 96-well microplate, with three replicates per condition. Afterward, Griess Reagent A (sulfanilamide) and Reagent B (N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride) were applied sequentially, and the wells were incubated in darkness at room temperature for 10 min. Optical density at 550 nm was obtained using a microplate spectrophotometer, and NO concentrations were derived from the generated standard curve [ 66 For the Western blot experiment, extracted proteins were mixed with 5× loading buffer (Beyotime) at a 4:1 ratio and denatured at 100 °C for 8 min. Protein extracts were fractionated on 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gels at 80–120 V and subsequently electroblotted onto PVDF membranes using a cooled transfer module operated at 250 mA for 90 min. To minimize nonspecific binding, the membranes were incubated in TBST containing 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature, followed by overnight exposure at 4 °C to primary antibodies. The antibodies applied included anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology (CST), Danvers, MA, USA), anti-Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology (CST), Danvers, MA, USA)), anti-eNOS (1:1000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and anti-GAPDH (1:3000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK); GAPDH served as the internal normalization control. Upon completion of the rinsing steps, incubation of the membranes with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG, 1:5000, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. A chemiluminescence (ECL) imaging system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to visualize protein signals, and the resulting signals were quantified with ImageJ software (version 1.46r) [ 66 67 Data analysis involved comparing NO, cGMP, and 6-keto-PGF 1 2 68 69 4.5. In Vivo Evaluation of Taxifolin’s Effects and Toxicity in Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats An in vivo study was conducted to evaluate the effects and potential toxicity of Taxifolin in SHRs. Taxifolin was prepared as a 120 mg/mL stock solution in distilled water containing 25% DMSO and diluted to working concentrations. Propranolol, obtained from MedChemExpress (China), served as a positive control. Healthy male SHRs weighing 200–220 g were allocated into five groups: three groups received oral Taxifolin at doses of 15, 30, or 60 mg/kg, negative control group received 10 mL/kg of the vehicle solution (1.25% DMSO in distilled water), and a positive control group received 80 mg/kg of propranolol in the same vehicle. The animals were dosed by oral gavage once each day over a 28-day treatment period. Cardiovascular parameters—including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP)—were measured weekly using a CODA non-invasive tail-cuff blood pressure monitor. Rats were pre-warmed to 37 °C for 15 min before measurements to enhance detection of tail artery pulsations and improve measurement accuracy. During measurements, rats were placed in restrainers on a temperature-controlled platform maintained at 32–35 °C. Approximately five acclimation cycles were performed first, followed by 10–20 measurement cycles until at least ten valid readings were obtained. Each group consisted of five rats. Body weights were also recorded weekly to monitor overall health and detect any physiological changes due to the treatments. This comprehensive approach allowed for a detailed assessment of Taxifolin’s impact on cardiovascular health over the treatment period [ 70 71 After 28 days, a thorough toxicological evaluation was performed. Blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture, obtaining approximately 5 mL from each rat. For biochemical analysis, 3 mL of blood was placed into red-top vacutainers without anticoagulant and allowed to clot. After centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min, serum was separated and stored under controlled conditions for analysis. For hematological analysis, 2 mL of blood was collected into EDTA-containing purple-top vacutainers to prevent clotting and allow complete blood count (CBC) measurement. All analyses were conducted at the Wenzhou BaiYiGe Medical Laboratory Company, an accredited facility with advanced diagnostic equipment. Biochemical parameters were quantified using an Abbott ci2800 analyzer (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA). CBCs were performed using a SYSMEX XE-5000 hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan), providing detailed profiles of red and white blood cells and platelet counts. Data were organized using Microsoft Excel 2016 for subsequent statistical evaluation. 4.6. Statistical Analysis All data are presented as mean ± SEM, and statistical evaluations were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. For the 28-day in vivo antihypertensive and body weight studies, two-way repeated measures ANOVA was applied to assess the overall effect of treatment over time. To compare treatment groups at individual time points (e.g., on Day 28), one-way ANOVA was conducted, followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test to compare each treatment group with the negative control. For other experiments—including ex vivo vasorelaxation assays, ELISA quantification of NO, cGMP, and 6-keto-PGF 1 p 72 5. Conclusions This study demonstrates that Taxifolin exerts potent antihypertensive effects through multiple synergistic pathways, including PI3K/Akt/eNOS/NO signaling, COX-2/PGI 2 Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) for providing the research environment and technical training support.
