We conducted proteome-wide MR using genetic data for 4,853 plasma proteins. Summary-level data on lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) were extracted from GWAS meta-analyses (11,273 and 7,426 cases, respectively) and FinnGen cohort (1,590 and 1,510 cases, respectively). We genetically identified eight proteins with a causal role in the etiology of NSCLC. Lower levels of five proteins (CDH17, CXADR, FAM3D, POGLUT3, SFTPB) and higher levels of two proteins (CEACAM5, KLK1) were linked to increased LUAD risk, while higher CD14 levels were associated with elevated LUSC risk. Two proteins, POGLUT3 and SFTPB were validated through Bayesian colocalization. One protein SFTPB was identified using SMR and HEIDI tests. Bidirectional MR found no reverse causality. The primary findings were validated through scRNA-seq, GeneMANIA, GO analysis, druggability assessments and PheWAS analysis. These protein-coding genes are primarily expressed in epithelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells. Furthermore, CEACAM5, KLK1, and CD14 correspond to existing drugs. These proteins may deepen our comprehension of the etiology and could serve as appealing novel biomarkers and drug targets for NSCLC management. proteome-wide Mendelian randomization biomarker drug target non-small cell lung cancer. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Lung cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy globally and is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Annually, it is estimated that around 2.5 million new cases arise and over 1.8 million fatalities occur 1 2 3 4 5 Proteins serve as the cornerstone of human metabolism, translating genomic information into the processes of growth, development, and homeostasis. The levels and characteristics of individual plasma proteins reflect a range of physiological or pathological states. Their accessibility via minimally invasive and inexpensive methods renders them ideal candidates for biomarker identification and as targets for drug development 6 7 8 Mendelian randomization (MR) is a technique that leverages genetic variants as natural instruments to establish putative causality between phenotypes, thereby minimizing the potential for residual confounding and reverse causation bias in observational studies 9 Human genetic variation has wide-ranging effects on protein structure and function, with important implications for health and disease. Proteomics data research through protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) has opened new avenues for biomarker discovery and revealing disease mechanisms 10 11 14 In the current study, we conducted proteome-wide MR analyses utilizing pQTL summary statistics from seven large-scaled proteomic studies. The study design is illustrated in Figure 1 Materials and Methods We performed proteome-wide MR based on pQTLs from 7 large-scale proteomic studies and summary genetic association data of NSCLC from previously published GWAS, to examine the causal proteins associated with LUAD and LUSC. All contributing studies included in this analysis were approved by the relevant institutional review board from each country and all participants provided informed consent. Study data sources and selection of instrumental variables (IVs) The GWAS data for NSCLC in the primary outcome were obtained from a large-scale GWAS study of European descent, including 66,756 individuals of LUAD (11,273 cases and 55,483 controls) and 63,053 individuals of LUSC (7,426 cases and 55,627 controls), respectively 15 16 22 P -8 2 2 23 24 2 In total, 13,236 SNPs representing 4,853 unique plasma proteins were included in the analysis. Details regarding the data sources utilized in this study are provided in Table S1 Table S3 Proteome-wide MR analyses We treated plasma proteins as exposures and the two subtypes of NSCLC as outcomes. The \"TwoSampleMR\" package 25 26 P P P P P Identified protein markers considered as causal inferences must satisfy the following criteria. (i) The MR results using the Wald ratio or IVW methods show a nominally significant association with LUAD or LUSC risk ( P P Bayesian colocalization analyses To investigate whether the observed association signals in two traits (trait 1: identified proteins, trait 2: NSCLC-related traits) are consistent with a shared genetic variant, we employed Bayesian colocalization analyses using the \"coloc\" package 27 Summary-data-based MR (SMR) analyses and reverse MR analyses Additionally, the SMR test was utilized to confirm the causal relationship between proteins and NSCLC risk 28 P -3 P 28 We investigated the reverse causality relationship between the potential influence of LUAD and LUSC on protein levels. Proteins identified in the primary analyses were examined utilizing five MR methods (IVW, MR-Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode). Furthermore, we considered GWAS significant genetic variants ( P -08 2 P Single cell‑type expression analyses and protein-coding genes expression pattern analyses We further investigated the gene expression levels of plasma proteins across different cell types, specifically targeting those with a causal role in lung cancer development. This analysis leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the two major histopathological subtypes of NSCLC, and the adjacent non-cancerous tissue. The scRNA-seq data were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GSE149655 contains two LUAD tissue samples and two distal normal tissue samples. Additionally, we acquired two LUSC tissue samples, GSM3635278 and GSM3635285, from GSE127465.

Our goal was to gather comprehensive insights into the potential risks or benefits associated with modulating the expression of theses protein in human populations. Firstly, we evaluated the score of the probability of being loss-of-function intolerant (pLI) for each cancer risk protein on the Exome Aggregation Consortium platform using the gnomAD browser. Secondly, we explored the UK Biobank using Genebass, which included exome-sequencing studies, rare-variant association studies, and Mendelian genetics research. To conduct a thorough assessment of the horizontal pleiotropy of potential drug targets and their possible side effects, we conducted a PheWAS using the AstraZeneca PheWAS Portal ( https://azphewas.com/ 34 Results Causal effects of 8 plasma proteins on NSCLC risk Proteome-wide MR analysis genetically identified eight plasma proteins associated with NSCLC, with seven linked to LUAD and one to LUSC. These proteins comprise Cadherin-17 (CDH17), Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5), Coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CXADR), Family with sequence similarity 3, member D (FAM3D), Kallikrein-1 (KLK1), Protein O-glucosyltransferase 3 (POGLUT3), Pulmonary surfactant-associated protein B (SFTPB), and CD14. Higher levels of CDH17 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.89; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83-0.95), CXADR (OR = 0.74; 95% CI 0.64-0.84), FAM3D (OR = 0.90; 95% CI 0.85-0.95), POGLUT3 (OR = 0.84; 95% CI 0.78-0.91), and SFTPB (OR = 0.87; 95% CI 0.82-0.93) were associated with a reduced risk of LUAD. Conversely, CEACAM5 (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.02-1.35) and KLK1 (OR = 1.08; 95% CI 1.02-1.14) were linked to an elevated risk of LUAD. Furthermore, higher levels of CD14 (OR = 1.30; 95% CI 1.16-1.45) were associated with an increased risk of LUSC (Figure 2 Table S4 We validated our primary findings in the replication stage. Five proteins were successfully confirmed in the FinnGen cohort. The OR (95% CI) of NSCLC per SD increase in genetically predicted levels of protein was 0.73 (0.54-0.99) for CXADR, 0.85 (0.74-0.97) for FAM3D, 1.08 (1.00-1.17) for KLK1, 0.65 (0.51-0.83) for POGLUT3 in LUAD, and 1.53 (1.23-1.91) for CD14 in LUSC ( Figure S1 Table S7 Sensitivity analyses for non-small cell lung cancer causal proteins To further scrutinize the robustness of our primary MR analyses, Cochran's Q test was performed to assess heterogeneity across the identified eight causal proteins using the IVW or MR-Egger method. A significance level of P P pleiotropy Table S4 P heterogeneity P pleiotropy Table S7 For investigating potential reverse causality between the identified plasma proteins and different pathological types of NSCLC, we identified LUAD and LUSC as exposures and eight proteins as outcomes. Bidirectional MR analyses provided no evidence of a reverse causal relationship between the identified plasma proteins and different pathological types of NSCLC ( Table S10 Causality Verification through Colocalization and SMR Analyses Among the eight causal proteins identified through proteome-wide MR, POGLUT3 and SFTPB stand out, supported by robust evidence of genetic colocalization, with a PPH4 > 90% (Table 1 Table S9 To distinguish pleiotropy from linkage and validate the primary proteome-wide MR findings, we conducted the SMR and HEIDI tests utilizing proteins with complete summary-level data. Table 1 P -3 P Cell‑type specificity expression in the NSCLC tissue To investigate the cell-type specificity of coding genes corresponding to the 8 plasma proteins in NSCLC tissue, we performed single-cell data analyses using the GEO database. In LUAD tumor tissue, using the FindCluster() function, we identified 13 clusters and annotated 5 cell types (T cells, epithelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells) ( Figure S3 3 POGLUT3 3 CEACAM5 CXADR FAM3D SFTPB CD14 CDH17 4 Figure S3 CXADR SFTPB CD14 4 4 POGLUT3 CDH17 CXADR SFTPB FAM3D CD14 Figure S4 Figure S5 GeneMANIA analyses and druggability evaluation for candidate protein targets We employed GeneMANIA to construct a comprehensive gene network by inputting the 8 protein-coding genes of interest. This analysis identified 20 correlated genes, predicated based on co-expression, co-localization, and shared protein domains. This expanded network, as depicted in Figure 5 5 In the assessment of the druggability and drug development potential of the eight candidate plasma proteins, we identified three proteins (CEACAM5, KLK1, CD14) that have been acknowledged as druggable targets ( Table S11 35 Identifying loss-of-function variants and PheWAS analyses for causal proteins in non-small cell lung cancer In our study, seven of the cancer risk proteins exhibited pLI scores below 0.1, implying a high tolerance for loss of function (LOF) variation. In contrast, CXADR showed a slightly lower intolerance of LOF variation, with a pLI score of 0.34. We conducted a gene-level PheWAS analysis using an extensive dataset from the AstraZeneca PheWAS Portal 34 Table S12 P P -5 -2 P -5 -1 P -5 -1 P -5 -2 P -5 -2 P -5 -2 P -5 -2 P -5 -2 Discussion In this study, we systematically evaluated the causal relationship between plasma proteins and NSCLC. Using pQTL data from up to 4,853 plasma proteins, we identified eight proteins that likely play a role in the etiology of NSCLC. Specifically, genetically determined lower levels of proteins such as CDH17, CXADR, FAM3D, POGLUT3, and SFTPB, along with higher levels of CEACAM5 and KLK1, were associated with increased risk of LUAD, while higher levels of CD14 were associated with increased risk of LUSC. Additionally, five proteins (CXADR, FAM3D, KLK1, POGLUT3, CD14) were corroborated in external cohorts; two proteins (POGLUT3, SFTPB) were verified by Bayesian colocalization; and one protein (SFTPB) was identified through SMR and HEIDI tests, underlining their potential therapeutic relevance. Subsequently, bidirectional MR was conducted and no proteins revealed reverse causality. We further verified the differential expressions of these protein-coding genes in various cell types, including epithelial cells, macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells. We also identified causal proteins that mediate the therapeutic effects of specific drugs that may lead to drug repurposing. Moreover, we identified proteins as novel targets that were previously unexplored in the context of NSCLC therapy, thereby paving the way for new investigational pathways. Lastly, we employed phenome-wide association analysis to delve deeper into the potential pleiotropic effects of the target genes and to foresee possible drug side effects, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of our findings. The significance of our findings lies in their extension of current evidence associating these proteins with lung cancer, based on studies of gene polymorphisms, mRNA, or protein levels. It is notable that SFTPB was identified based on the strongest evidence from colocalization, SMR and HEIDI tests. SFTPB is an essential protein for maintaining normal lung function 36 37 38 39 37 KLK1, a member of the kallikrein-related peptidase family, has been implicated in regulating vascular tone, inflammation, and tumor microenvironment 40 41 42 43 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 Proteins serve as essential targets for drug development. We identified three proteins that are the focus of drugs currently under investigation in phase I clinical trials or higher, indicating that their potential for drug-ability is actively being evaluated. Notably, the majority of drugs targeting cancer risk proteins are typically either monoclonal antibodies or small molecular inhibitors (SMIs). For example, labetuzumab, a monoclonal antibody, directly inhibits CEACAM5 and is utilized in the treatment of colorectal cancer 52 53 54 Our research demonstrates several strengths, such as a robust repository of plasma proteins, a substantial cohort of LUAD and LUSC cases, a minimal risk of reverse causation, and comprehensive colocalization analyses. These elements highlight the effectiveness of our methodology in elucidating the fundamental mechanisms governing NSCLC pathogenesis. The supplementary insights obtained from single-cell expression analysis, PPI studies, and drug target assessments have shed light on the potential pathogenic roles of candidate proteins in NSCLC. This has not only helped to delineate priority targets for drug development but also underscored the potential of our investigation to augment genetic screening methodologies for the early detection of NSCLC. Our work provides essential insights into the development of screening and preventative strategies, particularly for those with identified genetic predispositions. Furthermore, we underscore the potential for drug repurposing, acknowledging that high-risk proteins not currently the subject of any drug intervention may offer promising avenues for future drug discovery. Additionally, the identification of previously uninvestigated cancer-associated proteins unveils novel opportunities for transformative approaches in cancer treatment and prevention. Our study presents several limitations that necessitate acknowledgment. Firstly, our study lacked a comprehensive assessment of the entire proteome, as it was restricted to measuring proteins exclusively via blood-based multiplex affinity platforms. Secondly, our analysis concentrated solely on individuals of European descent, thereby hindering the generalizability of our findings in the genetic landscape of diverse populations. To this end, we intend to utilize GWAS from East Asian populations, such as the China Kadoorie Biobank and Biobank Japan, to conduct cross-ethnic MR analysis in our future research. Thirdly, the statistical power might be insufficient in analyzing large cell lung cancer due to the absence of genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for this histological subtype of NSCLC. To evaluate the histological heterogeneity of NSCLC in greater detail, we intend to integrate single-cell multi-omics approaches in our subsequent studies. Fourthly, the GWAS summary data for LUAD and LUSC from public datasets exhibited imbalanced stratification across demographic covariates such as gender, age, and other crucial demographic factors. This imbalance constrained our ability to investigate potential causal links within distinct subgroups. Fifth, to address the absence of experimental validation, we plan to incorporate experimental validation through CRISPR-based protein knockdowns of SFTPB and CEACAM5 in NSCLC cell lines in our future work. Lastly, we conducted rigorous sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression ( P pleiotropy Table S4 Conclusions Our study identified several plasma proteins associated with NSCLC risk, providing novel insights into its etiology and highlighting potential targets for diagnostic and therapeutic advancements. Further experimental and clinical investigations are imperative to assess the efficacy and significance of the eight identified proteins, with the goal of developing preventive strategies and clinical approaches to address the anticipated increase in cancer prevalence.
