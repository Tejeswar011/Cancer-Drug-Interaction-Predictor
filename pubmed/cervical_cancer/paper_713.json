While SPECT/CT is often considered superior to planar scintigraphy, it entails higher radiation exposure, greater costs, and limited accessibility. We compared three imaging protocols using technetium-99m (Tc-99m): early planar scintigraphy (30 min post-injection), SPECT/CT (1 h post-injection), and delayed planar scintigraphy at 18 h. The 18-h protocol achieved the highest SLN detection rate (94.4%) and bilateral detection rate (80.8%) in 125 patients, with complete intraoperative and histopathological confirmation. It was equally effective in obese patients (BMI ≥ 30, 94%). Image quality, assessed using the contrast factor (C-factor) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), supported these findings. Delayed planar scintigraphy is a highly effective, low-cost, and accessible method for SLN detection in early-stage EC, potentially eliminating the need for SPECT/CT. Further studies, including those involving artificial intelligence, may help to standardize this approach. Abstract Background/Objectives: Methods: Results: The 18-h planar scintigraphy achieved the highest SLN detection sensitivity (94.4%, 118/125), compared with SPECT/CT (87.2%, OR = 2.48, 95% CI: 0.98–6.27, p = 0.051) and 30-min scintigraphy (72.0%) Conclusions: endometrial cancer sentinel lymph node planar scintigraphy SPECT/CT technetium-99m lymphatic mapping signal-to-noise ratio contrast factor nuclear medicine This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Endometrial cancer (EC) is most often confined to the uterus, with lymph node metastases occurring infrequently [ 1 2 3 Various tracers are used for SLN mapping, including technetium-99m (Tc-99m), indocyanine green (ICG), and blue dyes (e.g., Patent Blue). Tc-99m is a widely used radiotracer due to its stability, deep tissue penetration, and long retention time in lymph nodes, as well as its applicability in both planar scintigraphy and hybrid SPECT/CT imaging [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 4 10 The literature suggests the superiority of hybrid SPECT/CT imaging over planar scintigraphy, both in tumors with complex anatomy [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 which may not allow sufficient time for optimal tracer accumulation in SLNs 12 13 14 15 16 In our previous study [ 17 17 18 In the present study, we expanded our prior analysis [ 17 The aim of the study was to evaluate whether delayed planar scintigraphy with Tc-99m is sufficiently sensitive and clinically effective (including positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) to replace SPECT/CT in standard SLN detection in EC, thereby reducing radiation exposure, cost, and preoperative preparation time. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Setting This was a retrospective cohort analysis conducted at the Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Krakow Branch, Poland, between December 2016 and April 2025. It included patients with endometrial cancer (EC) preoperatively classified as FIGO stage I–II (2009 classification), based on clinical and imaging assessments [ 19 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Eligible patients had histologically confirmed stage I–II endometrial cancer, had received no neoadjuvant therapy, and had complete clinical and pathological data. Exclusion criteria included advanced-stage disease (FIGO III–IV), age below 18 or above 85 years, and contraindications to surgical treatment. Of the 131 patients initially enrolled in the long planar scintigraphy protocol, 6 were excluded due to incomplete SPECT/CT imaging data, resulting in a final cohort of 125 patients for analysis. 2.3. Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping and Imaging All patients underwent total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or salpingectomy, and SLN mapping using technetium-99m (Tc-99m) human serum albumin colloid (NanoColl, GE Healthcare Limited, The Grove Centre, White Lion Road, Amersham, Bucks, UK). A dose of 120 MBq of Tc-99m was injected into the cervix at the 3 and 9 o’clock positions, both superficially (2–3 mm) and deeply (10–15 mm) into the cervical stroma using a 21G needle. Cervical injections were performed by three trained operators following a center-specific SOP. Inter-operator variability was mitigated by standard training and assessed indirectly via stable quantitative metrics. Sentinel lymph nodes were defined as the first lymph nodes demonstrating radiotracer uptake in a given imaging protocol: Early planar scintigraphy—performed 30 min after injection (~113 MBq, acquisition time 600 s) using a Mediso, Budapest, Hungary, AnyScan SC gamma camera, field of view (FoV): 530 × 390 mm 2 SPECT/CT—performed 1 h after injection (~107 MBq, acquisition time 600 s) using the Mediso AnyScan SPECT/CT system; the additional radiation dose from the CT component was estimated at 1–4 mSv [ 20 2 Delayed planar scintigraphy was performed 18 h after injection (~15 MBq, acquisition time 600 s), on the day of surgery 2 Intraoperative SLN localization was guided by the results of delayed planar scintigraphy and performed using a handheld gamma probe (Gamma Finder 2, World of Medicine Berlin, Germany). Identified SLNs were anatomically classified as obturator, internal iliac, external iliac, common iliac, or para-aortic, and ex vivo gamma probe confirmation was performed. In two cases, hysterectomy was required before SLN mapping due to intense cervical activity; these patients were included in the denominator, and SLNs were subsequently identified after uterine removal. The overall detection rate was defined as the percentage of patients with at least one SLN visualized in a given imaging protocol. For the 18-h protocol, detection was additionally confirmed intraoperatively and histologically. Bilateral detection was defined as the identification of at least one SLN on each side of the pelvis. 2.4. Histopathological Analysis Excised SLNs were fixed in formalin, sectioned into 2 mm slices, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Cytokeratin immunohistochemistry was used for metastasis detection and categorized as macrometastasis (>2 mm), micrometastasis (0.2–2 mm), or isolated tumor cells (≤0.2 mm). 2.5. Quantitative Metrics and Statistical Analysis Scintigraphic image quality was assessed using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, threshold ≥ 1.46) and contrast factor (C-factor, threshold ≥ 3.61), in accordance with the methodology of Szatkowski et al. [ 17 17 21 Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics v28.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Comparisons between imaging protocols (30-min planar, SPECT/CT, 18-h planar) were performed using ANOVA for quantitative metrics (SNR, C-factor). Paired t p 2.6. SLN Evaluation Parameters The following metrics were assessed: Detection sensitivity: The percentage of patients with at least one SLN identified and confirmed intraoperatively and histologically. This metric was based on delayed (18-h) scintigraphy, which was used for surgical planning. Bilateral detection: The proportion of cases with at least one SLN identified on each side of the pelvis. Positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV): Calculated based on intraoperative and histopathological verification of SLNs identified on 18-h scintigraphic images. Quantitative metrics: Mean values and standard deviations of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast factor (C-factor), analyzed independently for each imaging protocol. 2.7. Ethical Approval and Informed Consent The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Krakow Branch, Poland (Approval No. 10/2025, date: 9 January 2025). Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study, and all data were anonymized prior to analysis. 3. Results The study cohort included 125 patients with endometrial cancer, with obesity (BMI ≥ 30) present in 74.4% of cases ( Table 1 p Table 2 Figure 1 p Figure 2 Figure 3 The SLN detection sensitivity in patients with BMI ≥ 30 was 94% (87/93) for the 18 h protocol, 86% (80/93) for SPECT/CT, and 71% (66/93) for the 30-min protocol. All 118 cases with positive 18 h scintigraphy were confirmed intraoperatively and histopathologically as lymphatic tissue, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% (95% CI: 96.9–100%). In the seven cases where SLNs were not visualized with 18 h scintigraphy, the absence of intraoperative detection was also confirmed, suggesting a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (95% CI: 59.0–100%), though the limited number of negative cases reduces statistical power. No significant interaction between BMI category and imaging protocol was observed ( p The total number of SLNs visualized in the 18 h protocol was 152, with a mean of 1.4 nodes per patient (range: 0–4) and median SLN per patient: 1.29. The most common anatomical locations included obturator nodes (40%), internal iliac (31%), external iliac (19%), common iliac (7%), and paraaortic nodes (3%). Quantitative metrics confirmed high image quality in the 18 h protocol. The mean contrast ratio (C-factor) was 10.30 ± 1.22, slightly higher than for SPECT/CT (10.20 ± 1.30) and the 30-min protocol (10.02 ± 2.00). The mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was 3.51 ± 1.2 for the 18 h protocol, compared to 4.22 ± 1.1 for SPECT/CT and 4.61 ± 1.1 for the 30-min protocol, reflecting the lower tracer activity used in the long protocol (15 MBq vs. 37.8 MBq [ 17 p t Differences in C-factor between protocols (18 h: 10.30 ± 1.22; SPECT/CT: 10.20 ± 1.30; 30 min: 10.02 ± 2.00) were not statistically significant ( p t In two cases (1.6%) in the 30-min protocol, hysterectomy was required before SLN mapping due to signal interference near the cervix, which allowed for the successful identification of sentinel lymph nodes in that region. 4. Discussion This study evaluated the effectiveness of planar scintigraphy performed at different time intervals after the administration of Tc-99m (120 MBq) compared to hybrid SPECT/CT for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in patients with endometrial cancer (EC). Three approaches were compared: planar scintigraphy performed 30 min after injection, hybrid SPECT/CT performed 1 h post-injection, and delayed planar scintigraphy performed 18 h post-injection (the so-called delayed protocol). The highest SLN detection sensitivity was achieved with imaging performed 18 h after injection (94.40%, 118/125), outperforming both SPECT/CT (87.20%, 109/125; OR = 2.48; 95% CI: 0.98–6.27; p Table 2 Figure 1 p Among the 152 SLNs detected using the delayed protocol, most were located in the obturator (40%), internal iliac (31%), external iliac (19%), common iliac (7%), and para-aortic (3%) regions. Complete intraoperative and histopathological confirmation (100%) in the 18-h protocol and its high sensitivity in patients with BMI ≥ 30 (94%, 87/93) confirm its clinical utility, indicating that, in many cases, SPECT/CT may not provide additional benefits. An ideal tracer for SLN mapping should exhibit rapid clearance from the injection site, high retention in SLNs, and minimal uptake in downstream nodes [ 22 23 In contrast to studies where SPECT/CT outperforms planar scintigraphy in short protocols (e.g., Kagoshima University, imaging within 1 h [ 12 13 24 18 12 7 Quantitative metrics such as SNR (3.51 ± 1.2 for 18 h; 4.22 ± 1.1 for SPECT/CT; 4.61 ± 1.1 for 30 min) and C-factor (10.30 ± 1.22 for 18 h; 10.20 ± 1.30 for SPECT/CT; 10.02 ± 2 for 30 min) enabled objective image quality assessment ( Table 2 17 Injection site signal interference occurred in only two patients (1.6%), requiring hysterectomy before SLN mapping. The minimal background signal in EC—unlike in cervical cancer (CC), where strong cervical uptake hinders imaging [ 25 26 27 28 29 Our cohort included 74.4% of patients with BMI ≥ 30 ( Table 1 30 29 31 p A limitation of our study is that intraoperative and histopathological confirmation was available only for the 18-h planar protocol. By design, SLNs can be excised only once, making head-to-head histological verification of all imaging protocols within the same patient impossible outside a prospective randomized trial. Nevertheless, the complete intraoperative and histological concordance observed in the 18-h protocol strongly supports its reliability. Additional limitations include the small number of negative cases (n = 7), which reduces the precision of NPV estimates, and the wide confidence intervals for some odds ratios (e.g., 0.98–6.27 for sensitivity), reflecting the limited statistical power. These aspects underscore the need for larger multicenter studies to confirm our findings. Although shorter imaging times (e.g., 8–12 h) might also be effective, their performance could not be tested in our setting due to administrative constraints: Tc-99m was injected the day before, with imaging performed at approximately 7:20 AM on the day of surgery, followed by procedures one to two hours later. Further studies are required to evaluate the efficacy of intermediate-time protocols. Future directions include the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the analysis of scintigraphic images. Deep learning algorithms could automatically segment SLNs, improve detection accuracy in cases with high background signal, optimize Tc-99m dosing based on BMI, and predict signal interference risks, thereby supporting clinical decision making [ 17 21 32 5. Conclusions The 18-h planar scintigraphy with Tc-99m (120 MBq) proved to be a highly effective method for SLN detection in early-stage EC, achieving 94.4% sensitivity, 100% PPV/NPV, and 80.8% bilateral detection, with improvement to 88.2% in the last 17 cases, reflecting a learning curve effect. Its efficacy in patients with BMI ≥ 30 (94%) and minimal background interference suggests that delayed planar scintigraphy may reduce the routine need for SPECT/CT in many clinical scenarios, thereby lowering radiation exposure and costs. However, given the borderline statistical significance compared with SPECT/CT ( p Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, W.S., K.K. and P.B.; methodology, W.S., K.K., P.B., R.P.-M., K.R. and J.R.; software, W.S., K.K., K.P. and M.N.-J.; validation, P.B., J.R., T.B., E.K. and K.R.; formal analysis, W.S., K.K., P.B., K.P., M.N.-J., R.P.-M., T.B., J.R., E.K. and K.R.; investigation, W.S., K.K., K.P., P.B., M.N.-J., E.K. and J.R.; resources, W.S., K.K., P.B., J.R. and T.B.; data curation, W.S., K.K., R.P.-M., M.N.-J., E.K., K.P. and P.B.; writing—original draft preparation, W.S., K.K. and K.P.; writing—review and editing, W.S., K.P., K.R., K.K. and R.P.-M.; visualization, K.K. and E.K.; supervision, P.B., J.R. and T.B.; project administration W.S., K.K., K.P. and P.B.
