However, large unknown lies in the mechanisms underlying LNM in CCa. In this study, we discovered that PRDX3 is elevated in CCa with LNM and associates with poor prognosis in CCa patients. Moreover, multivariate logistic analysis revealed that PRDX3 is an independent predictor of LNM in CCa. Functional investigations demonstrated that PRDX3 promotes invasion, lymphangiogenesis, and LNM of CCa. Mechanistically, PRDX3 activates NF-κB signaling pathway and upregulates the downstream pro-metastatic molecules VEGF-C and MMP-9 in CCa cells. Furthermore, PRDX3 could inhibit the anoikis of detached CCa cells by reducing the ROS level and hence promote LNM in CCa. Importantly, genetic inhibition of PRDX3 potently slows LNM of CCa. These findings highlight a novel PRDX3-mediated mechanism of LNM in CCa and recognize PRDX3 as a promising predictive marker and target of clinical intervention for LNM in CCa.

Its mortality ranked the 4th among female malignancies, greatly impacting the survival and life quality of CCa patients 1 2 3 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced as significant byproducts of oxygen metabolism 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 4 In our previous research, we discovered that PRDX3 is significantly upregulated in CCa tissues with LNM 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Here in this study, for the first time we identified PRDX3 as a poor prognosis factor for CCa and independent predictor of LNM. PRDX3 was highly expressed in CCa with LNM relative to CCa without LNM. Functional experiments revealed the promoting effects of PRDX3 on the migration, invasion, lymphangiogenesis, and LNM in CCa. Mechanistically, PRDX3 exerted its promoting functions via enhancing the resistance to anoikis by inhibiting mitochondrial ROS accumulation and activating NF-κB signaling pathway in CCa cells. Targeting PRDX3 by genetic knockdown potently inhibited LNM in CCa, highlighting PRDX3 as a potential target of clinical intervention for LNM in CCa. Materials and Methods Human specimens For PRDX3 mRNA level detection, we included 55 fresh CCa tissues, of which 13 were LNM positive and 42 were LNM negative, and 19 normal cervix tissues, which were acquired between April, 2023 and April, 2024 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. For immunohistochemistry, 280 cervical cancer tissues sections (52 with LNM positive and 228 were LNM negative) between 2011 and 2023 were obtained from the Department of Pathology. Tumor tissues were harvested in radical hysterectomy operations of CCa patients, who all had not received previous anti-tumor treatment. Normal cervix tissues were from patients who underwent hysterectomy for benign gynecological diseases like uterine leiomyoma and adenomyosis, but without cervical lesions. Human research was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Approval number: 2023-008; Date: March 17th, 2023) and conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All enrolled patients provided written informed consent. Cell lines and culture conditions CCa cell lines, including MS751, HeLa, HeLa229, SiHa, and the human normal cervix epithelial cell line H8 were all purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). DMEM (Gibco, USA) was used to culture the above cells, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, USA), 1% non-essential amino acid (NEAA) (Corning, NY, USA), and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (NCMBio, Suzhou, China). Human lymphatic endothelial cells (HLECs) were purchased from ScienCell (USA) and cultured in the ECM (ScienCell, USA). All cells were maintained in an thermostatic incubator under 37°C with 5% CO2. In 2023, all of the involved cell lines were subjected to STR genotyping for identification and to mycoplasma detection. To achieve a detached condition, tumor cells were cultured on 1% agar-treated plate for 48h. Total RNA extraction and qRT-PCR Total RNAs of tissues were extracted via a Trizol-chloroform-based protocol. Total RNA extraction from cells was achieved with an RNA-Quick Purification Kit (ESScience, Shanghai, China). After quantification with a Nanodrop2000 (ThermoFisher, USA), an equal amount of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Evo M-MLV RT-PCR kit (Accurate Biology, Changsha, China). The cDNAs were subsequently applied for qRT-PCR analysis with SYBR Green Premix Pro Taq HS qPCR kit (Accurate Biology, Inc.) on a Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (ThermoFisher, USA). All the involved primers were displayed in Table S1 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) 5-μm paraffin-embedded tissue sections were subjected to IHC staining. In brief, after deparaffinization, rehydration, and sealing with goat serum, slides were incubated with a primary antibody overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation in a corresponding HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 1h. Afterwards, staining was detected by DAB assay. After reverse dehydration and mounting, staining was scanned and analyzed. The antibodies involved in this study were displayed in Table S2 Western-blot A protease inhibitor-containing RIPA lysis buffer (CWBIO, Beijing, China) was used to extract the total proteins from cells. After quantification with a BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), total proteins were separated by SDS-poly-acrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to the PVDF membrane (Merck Millipore, USA), which was incubated in sequence with 5% BSA (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), primary antibody and secondary antibody and detected by ECL Western Blotting Substrate (Merck Millipore, USA). Image J software was used to quantify the stripes. Transwell assay and HLEC tube formation assay For transwell invasion assay, each upper chamber was precoated with Matrigel (Corning, USA) and seeded 5×104 starved tumor cells. The upper chamber contained serum-free medium and the lower chamber was dipped in complete medium with 15% FBS. After being cultured under 37°C for 48h, migrated cells on the lower chamber were counted under a light microscope after fixation with paraformaldehyde and staining with crystal violet. The procedures of transwell migration were the same as above expect that the upper chambers were not coated with Matrigel. For HLECs transwell assay, 3×104 HLECs were seeded and incubated for 24h before detection. For tube formation assay, HLECs were seeded onto the Matrigel-precoated 96-well plate at the density of 1×104 cells/well, cultured with ECM (Gibco, USA) containing tumor cells culture supernatant under 37°C for 4h-6h. The total length of formed tube structures was measured under a light microscope. Image J was used to process the data. Xenograft nude mouse LNM model All the animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-sen University (Approval number: SYSU-IACUC-2022-001358; Date: September 16th, 2022). All the xenograft tumors in this study didn't exceed the maximal tumor size permitted by the ethics committee, which is no diameter shall greater than 20 mm nor weigh greater than 10% of its body weight. Xenograft LNM model was established on female BALB/c nude mice. About an amount of 6×106 SiHa cells were injected into the mice foot-pads. BAY-11-7082 (Aladdin, Shanghai, China) or placebo was administered by intra peritoneal injection twice a week at the dose of 5mg/kg since the 39th day after tumor cell inoculation. On the 60th day, the mice were sacrificed and removed of their popliteal lymph nodes and primary foot-pad tumors, whose calibre was measured for volume evaluation as: volume (mm3) = 0.52 × (length [mm]) × (width [mm])2. The harvested specimens were fixed with formalin and made into paraffin-embedded sections for HE staining and IHC. PRDX3 expression manipulation To knockdown PRDX3 expression, two different siRNAs targeting PRDX3 were synthesized by GenePharma (Suzhou, China). Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen, USA) was used to transfect tumor cells with above siRNAs. These two siRNAs were provided in Table S3 ROS detection and apoptosis detection For intracellular ROS level examination, a Reactive Oxygen Species Assay Kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was applied according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, serum-free culture medium diluted DCFH-DA was used to suspend tumor cells and incubate under 37°C and 5% CO2 for 20 minutes. After being washed with serum-free medium, then tumor cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. For mitochondrial ROS detection, Mitochondrial Superoxide Assay Kit with MitoSOX Red (Invitrogen, USA) was applied. In brief, MitoSox Red was diluted into 5μM with HBSS (Invitrogen, USA) and then incubated cells for 10 minutes from light before flow cytometry analysis. For apoptosis detection, an Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) was utilized according to the manufacturer's protocols. In short, suspended and washed cells were incubated with 5μl PI Staining Solution and 5μl Annexin V-FITC in 100μl Binding Buffer for 10 minutes at room temperature from light and then immediately submitted to flow cytometry analysis on CytoFLEX machine (Beckman Coulter, USA). Statistical analysis SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) and GraphPad Prism 9.5 software were used for statistical analysis and plotting. Student's t-test was employed for differentiating the averages of two separate groups. Pearson χ2 test or Fisher's exact test were the method of evaluating relationships between clinicopathological characteristics and PRDX3 expression. The Kaplan-Meier method was employed in overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) analyses. Log-rank test was used to compare the curves of different groups. Spearman rank correlation analysis was utilized for analysis of correlations between measured variables. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to recognize independent predictors for LNM in CCa. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was for determination of the discriminatory power of specific indicators. Cox proportional hazard model was employed to discriminate independent predictive factors for prognosis in CCa patients. P < 0.05 was set as the cutoff to determine statistical significance. Results PRDX3 is correlated with LNM in CCa To explore whether PRDX3 plays an important role in LNM of CCa, we investigated the level of PRDX3 protein and mRNA expression in CCa tissues. Results showed that the mRNA and protein level of PRDX3 in CCa tissues with LNM were both significantly higher than those in CCa tissues without LNM and normal cervix (Fig. 1 1 1 1 Next, we determined to evaluate the correlations between PRDX3 expression and clinical characteristics of CCa patients. We performed IHC staining of PRDX3 and scored its expression on 280 paraffin-embedded CCa sections, and its correlation to clinicopathological factors was examined. The results indicated that PRDX3 was significantly correlated with FIGO stage (P = 0.001), tumor size (P < 0.001), LNM (P < 0.001), and lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) (P = 0.042) in CCa (Table 1 To further investigate whether PRDX3 is an independent risk factor for LNM in CCa, we conducted multivariate logistic regression analysis and found that all of LVSI, tumor size and PRDX3 expression possess independent predictive power for LNM in CCa (Table 2 1 3 3 Elevated PRDX3 confers higher postoperative relapse and decreased survival in CCa patients Of the 280 enrolled CCa patients, 201 (71.79 %) were still alive as of current statistics, 79 (28.21 %) had deceased from CCa, and a total of 84 (30 %) underwent disease recurrence. To evaluate the potential of PRDX3 being a prognostic factor in CCa, we constructed a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model, where age, tumor size, LNM, LVSI and PRDX3 were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS in CCa patients, and tumor size, LNM, LVSI, as well as PRDX3 were confirmed as independent prognostic factors for RFS (Table 4 1 PRDX3 promotes in vitro in vivo To confirm the cancer-promoting biological function of PRDX3 in LNM of CCa, we conducted loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays in CCa cell lines. According to their primary expression level of PRDX3 as shown in Fig 1 1 2 2 2 in vitro Next, we apply a LNM model on nude mice to further evaluate the effect of PRDX3 on LNM in CCa (Fig. 2 2 2 2 in vivo PRDX3 stimulates lymphangiogenesis of CCa in vitro in vivo Lymphangiogenesis is a pivotal process during LNM of cancer 8 9 3 in vitro 3 3 In vivo 3 in vitro in vivo PRDX3 promotes CCa invasion, lymphangiogenesis and LNM via activating NF-κB signaling pathway Our previous study discovered that NF-κB signaling pathway activation by fatty acid binding protein 5 (FABP5) promoted CCa invasion and lymphangiogenesis 21 4 Further, we probed into the significance of NF-κB signaling pathway in the pro-metastatic function of PRDX3 in CCa cells by means of a NF-κB signaling inhibitor BAY-11-7082. Treatment with BAY-11-7082 significantly reduced the protein level of Nu-p65, p-IκB-α, MMP-9 and VEGF-C in HeLa and SiHa cells (Fig. 4 4 4 4 5 in vivo 5 PRDX3 enhances resistance to anoikis by reducing ROS in detached CCa cells Evidence have been found that acquaintance of resistance to anoikis could help tumor cell to metastasize 22 24 25 26 6 6 6 6 To explore whether PRDX3 promotes resistance to anoikis in CCa cells in an ROS-dependent manner, we employed N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), an ROS-ridding antioxidant for rescue assays. Supplement with NAC remarkably reversed the intracellular and mitochondrial ROS level and the apoptosis proportion in SiHa and HeLa229 cells (Fig. 6 Discussion LNM is one of the most common clinicopathological features that confer poor prognosis in CCa patients, yet the existing therapeutic strategies yield unsatisfactory outcomes for these patients 27 7 As a natural scavenger of peroxides, PRDX3 can protect cells from oxidative stress. Several researches have demonstrated that PRDX3 may take an important part in malignancies. In colorectal cancer, upregulation of PRDX3, induced by forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), could stimulate tumor cells to multiply and metastasize to distant locations by mitochondrial dysfunction 28 29 Tumor cells must negotiate a series of steps to achieve metastases, each requiring specific functions, including detaching from primary site, migration and invasion, circulation, extravasation and seeding to colonize distant organs 30 25 31 32 Another momentous finding from this study is that the pro-metastatic function of NF-κB pathway in CCa could be mediated by elevated PRDX3. It is reported that the excessive NF-κB pathway activation is correlated to LNM in breast cancer 33 34 35 36 37 39 21 Conclusions In summary, we have elucidated a new PRDX3-mediated mechanism of LNM in CCa, where PRDX3 could promote tumor cell invasion, lymphangiogenesis and LNM via NF-κB signaling pathway and scavenging ROS level to resist anoikis. Moreover, our study confirms the potential of PRDX3 being a predictive biomarker and therapeutic target for CCa patients with LNM. Supplementary Material Supplementary tables.
