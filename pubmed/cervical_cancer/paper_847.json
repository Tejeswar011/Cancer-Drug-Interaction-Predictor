However, much remains to be studied regarding the quantitative importance of a positive pre‐treatment result and correlations with disease burden. Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Single tertiary care center; January 2022 to July 2024. Methods Patients with HPV‐associated OPSCC and baseline pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA levels were evaluated for primary tumor and lymph node disease extent on clinical imaging, exam, and surgical pathology results when applicable. Associations with log(pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA levels) were evaluated via multivariable linear regression. A commercially available TTMV‐HPV DNA test was used. Results In total, 94 patients were included, who were 93% male, with median age of 63 years (interquartile range [IQR] 55‐70). Most patients were clinical tumor class cT1 (40%) or cT2 (38%) and clinical nodal class cN1 (77%). Surgical resection was performed in 37% of patients. Median pretreatment TTMV‐HPV level was 225 (IQR 46‐1132) fragments/mL. Independent associations were found between pretreatment TTMV‐HPV levels and clinical nodal staging ( P r P r P r P r P r P Conclusions Pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA was significantly associated with lymph node disease burden in HPV‐associated OPSCC, on pre‐treatment CT, PET, and surgical pathology.

Human papillomavirus (HPV)‐associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) continues to increase dramatically in incidence and prevalence throughout the United States and globally.  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 Patient serum measurements of tumor‐tissue modified viral (TTMV)‐HPV DNA has become an important biomarker, used by many providers to assess for treatment response and to aid in post‐treatment surveillance.  9  12  10  13  14  15  16  17 This study aims to evaluate the clinical significance of a positive pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA level, and any associations with tumor burden for HPV‐associated OPSCC. We hypothesize there will be a significant association between clinical disease burden and TTMV‐HPV DNA score. Methods This was a single‐institution, retrospective study of electronic medical records approved by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) Institutional Review Board (IRB #23176). Study Design All patients presenting with HPV‐associated OPSCC from January 2022 to July 2024 were evaluated and considered for study inclusion. Inclusion criteria were patients with biopsy‐proven p16‐positive or HPV‐ positive head and neck cancer, and with baseline, pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV levels recorded. Exclusion criteria included those with prior treatment for head and neck cancer, those presenting with recurrent disease, or those with concurrent malignancy of another origin. Collected information included demographics, diagnostic imaging results, surgical pathology results if applicable, and pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA scores. The pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA levels for each patient were measured via droplet PCR analysis using a commercially available assay via a send‐out external laboratory (“NavDx,” Naveris Inc.).  9  16 Study Outcomes Study outcomes were aimed at evaluating clinical burden of disease at presentation. This included (1) primary tumor clinical staging and size, (2) regional lymph node clinical staging, largest size, number of pathologically involve nodes, total lymph node dimension (calculated via summation of all pathologic lymph node largest dimensions visualized on CT), and radiographic evidence of extranodal extension (ENE), (3) standard uptake values (SUVs), metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis of primary tumor and cervical lymph nodes measured via whole‐body PET/CT, and (4) surgical pathology results, if surgical resection was performed, including primary tumor staging, largest primary tumor dimension, nodal staging, largest metastatic node size, and pathologic evidence of ENE, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (PNI). For clinical disease staging, each patient's preoperative evaluation was independently reviewed by study coauthors, and they were staged according to both American Joint Commission on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition criteria, as well as AJCC 7th edition criteria.  18 PET Variables Each patient's. 18 1 (1) SUV max = Activity  concentration  of  tissue ( µ Ci / g ) injected  dose  ( µ Ci ) / body weight  ( g ) . The SUV‐peak was then collected to account for noise and provide a more comprehensive SUV measure for the lesion. SUV‐peak represents the average SUV within 1 cm³ spherical region centered around the voxel with highest uptake in the region of interest. MTV represents the total tumor volume of metabolically active regions of interest. The data were categorized into lymph node burden, primary tumor burden, and total tumor burden. TLG was collected for each patient's total tumor burden and accounts for both the size and metabolic activity of the lesion, as demonstrated in Equation ( 2 (2) TLG = MTV × S UVmean . Statistical Analysis The original laboratory measured pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA levels of the cohort were depicted via histogram, which showed significant outliers and a rightward‐skewed distribution of data. This variable was subsequently logarithmically transformed, which resulted in a more normal distribution of data ( Figure 1 t P Figure 1 Distribution of cohort patient values for (A) direct measured pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA level, and (B) logarithmically transformed lab value. Results During the study period, a total of 121 patients had a resulted pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA level drawn during initial workup in head and neck oncology clinic. Of these, 9 patients were previously treated for head and neck cancer, and 14 patients had final pathology yielding p16‐negative OPSCC, another malignancy (eg, lymphoma), or benign pathology. Of the remaining patients, we excluded 4 patients with a baseline TTMV‐HPV DNA level of 0. This left 94 patients remaining in our final cohort. These patients were 94% male, with median age of 63 years (IQR 55‐70), and 59% were non‐smokers. Most patients were clinical tumor class cT1 (40.4%) or cT2 (38.3%). Most were AJCC 8th edition clinical nodal class cN1 (77%), followed by cN2 (17%) and cN0 (5% of patients). Definitive surgical resection was performed in 35 patients (37%). The resulting pathological staging showed 18 patients (51%) to be pT1, and 30 patients (85%) were pN1.

There were no associations between pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA levels and primary tumor size, staging, or PET characteristics in our study. Our findings show a significant association between baseline TTMV‐HPV DNA levels and oncologic disease burden for HPV‐associated OPSCC, which is particularly driven by cervical nodal disease. All significant associations in our study had a positive correlation, such that the concentration of circulating tumor HPV DNA fragments increased with larger size or worsening characteristics of metastatic lymph nodes. The coefficients of determination (R‐squared) for each of our significant associations ranged from 0.13 to 0.27 ( Table 2  19 With regards to the PET/CT results, our findings showed a significant association between lymph node SUV‐max and baseline TTMV‐HPV DNA level. While the exact significance of SUV‐max on. 18  19  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30 Our study findings should be considered in the context of several other important recent publications on the same topic.  12  17  31  32  32  9  15  32 There are several potential practical implications of our study. It is conceivable that one day, baseline circulating tumor HPV DNA levels may be used as a biomarker to aid in treatment modality selection and potential for de‐intensification. The notable associations between nodal disease burden and baseline TTMV‐HPV DNA levels could prompt providers towards further work‐up when indicated or to adjust treatment strategies if there is suspicion of occult nodal metastasis based on baseline laboratory measurements. Despite our reported clinicopathological associations, there is not a clear association between baseline circulating tumor HPV DNA levels and treatment response or patient prognosis, and further investigation is warranted. The change and trend in TTMV‐HPV DNA levels within an individual patient is likely a much more important prognostic marker than the pretreatment value.  9  14  33  9  33  34 It is interesting that our study did not find many significant associations with surgical pathology variables, with the exception of largest lymph node dimension. This is likely due to the low number of patients who underwent surgical excision (N = 35), which is underpowered to determine a conclusive effect. However, surgical pathology results are the gold standard of disease severity. In assessing the concordance between clinical and pathological staging in our cohort, we found 51.4% (18 patients) had the same tumor and nodal classifications between clinical staging metrics and surgical pathology results. 37% (13 patients) had an upstaged primary tumor on final surgical pathology, 8.5% (3 patients) had an upstaged nodal classification on final surgical pathology, while 4 patients (11%) had downstaged nodal disease, and 1 patient (2.8%) had a downstaged primary tumor. There were 4 patients with ENE on final surgical pathology, which was not diagnosed clinically on imaging or exam. However, there were 11 additional patients with clinical signs of ENE, who did not undergo definitive surgical resection, and therefore do not have pathologic results. We should also note four patients were excluded from our cohort, who had an undetectable pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA level, despite a biopsy‐proven HPV‐related tumor. It is reported that approximately 10% of patients with HPV‐related OPSCC have undetectable TTMV‐HPV DNA levels. One possible explanation is the presence of a less common pathogenic strain of HPV.  10  35  15  35  35 Our study has several important limitations. First its retrospective nature, single institution setting, and limited cohort size, which limits our ability to make generalizations.  16  22 Conclusion Pre‐treatment TTMV‐HPV DNA levels are significantly associated with nodal disease burden, size, and metabolic activity in HPV‐associated OPSCC. These findings further contribute to our understanding and potential utility of this plasma biomarker for diagnosis, screening, and surveillance.
