Methods This single‐center, single‐arm, prospective intervention study included 10 women who were treated at our institution between April and December 2024. The indications were triplet or higher‐order multiple pregnancies, as well as twin pregnancies with serious maternal complications. Procedures were performed between 11 and 13 gestational weeks, and the patients were observed for up to 1 week postoperatively. The primary outcome was the completion ratio at hospital discharge, whereas the secondary outcomes were the survival rate of non‐targeted fetuses, the number of adverse events, and the psychological evaluation of the patients at 1 week postoperatively. Results Among the 10 patients, one carried twins, seven carried triplets, and two carried quadruplets; half had received ovulation‐induction treatment. The procedure completion rate at discharge was 100%, although one patient required reoperation. The survival rate of non‐targeted fetuses was 89.5% (17/19), and adverse events included vaginal bleeding and complete miscarriage. Maternal state‐anxiety scores decreased significantly postprocedure, whereas depression scores remained elevated both before and after the procedure. Conclusions The completion rate of MFPR using echo‐guided transabdominal potassium chloride infusion was high, ensuring short‐term maternal safety. Although no serious adverse event other than one case of total miscarriage was observed, a long‐term safety evaluation is warranted. Moreover, the emotional burden on patients is high before and after the procedure, necessitating the importance of long‐term support. multiple pregnancy patient safety pregnancy reduction prospective study psychological safety Obstetrics and Gynecology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Wakui N Endo M Shima A Okada A Miyake T Sugao S The initial report of prospective study for maternal and fetal outcomes to investigate the safety of multifetal pregnancy reduction in Japan J Obstet Gynaecol Res 2025 51 10 e70072 10.1111/jog.70072 41031976 PMC12487742 INTRODUCTION With the growing popularity of infertility treatments, the incidence of multiple pregnancies has increased, presenting remarkable challenges in high‐risk obstetrics. For example, the rate of postpartum hemorrhage (singleton: 2%–3% vs. triplet: 9%), preeclampsia (singleton: 2% vs. triplet: 26%),  1  2  3  4 In 2008, the Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommended single‐embryo transfer in assisted reproductive technology (ART), considerably reducing ART‐related multiple pregnancies. Nonetheless, in 2022, multiple birth rates in Japan are 11 045 twins, 157 triplets, and 1.3 quadruplets per one million deliveries.  5 To mitigate the risks of high‐order multiples, such as large fetal counts, estimated weight discordance, or lethal anomalies, multifetal pregnancy reduction (MFPR) is a possible option. Potassium chloride (KCl) is administered into the fetal cardiac cavity,  6  7  8 In 2003, the Reproductive Medicine Subcommittee of Japan's Health Sciences Council discussed the issue, stating that “the response to multiple pregnancies through reproductive medicine should prioritize the prevention of multiple pregnancies, and fetal reduction should not be performed in principle.” However, they also acknowledged that “completely preventing the occurrence of multiple pregnancies is challenging, and we do not oppose fetal reduction itself,” although no legislation or specific implementation system has been established.  9 Although MFPR has been performed at private clinics, few facilities have verified or evaluated its prognosis. In addition, patients and their families who need MFPR are forced to make decisions within a limited timeframe, experiencing guilt and social isolation while lacking access to the necessary information and appropriate psychological support. To confirm the feasibility and safety of the procedure, as well as to examine its psychological impact in Japan, we conducted a prospective study on maternal and fetal outcomes to investigate the safety of MFPR (PROMISe‐MFPR). METHODS Study design This single‐center, single‐arm, prospective intervention study was conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board for Clinical Research, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine (document number: 852), and the Ethical Review Board of Osaka University Hospital (23103‐4). As this study was positioned as an early safety trial and the primary objective was to evaluate surgical completion rates, no statistical significance was assigned to the number of patients included in the study. Considering the expected frequency of cases and study duration, we targeted 10 patients (Table S1 The inclusion and exclusion criteria of patients are as follows: Inclusion criteria (those who met all of the following requirements were considered “eligible”) Pregnant women who visited our department before 14 gestational weeks. Able to provide written consent to participate in the clinical research with her partner. Aged between 18 and 50, with a partner ≥18 years. Multiple pregnancies of triplets or more, or severe complications that would make the continuation of a twin pregnancy extremely harmful to the health of the mother. No vaginal bleeding. >20 mm of cervix length. No rupture of membranes. Exclusion criteria (those who met one of the following requirements were considered “ineligible”) Positive for HIV antibody, HCV antibody, or HBs antigen. With psychiatric symptoms that make participation and continuation in the study difficult. Poor general condition: class 3, 4, 5, or 6 in the American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status Classification.  10 The primary outcome was the completion ratio of MFPR at discharge from the hospital, and secondary outcomes were as follows: (1) the ratio of non‐targeted fetuses alive 1 week postoperatively; (2) the total number of adverse events during the first postoperative week, including vaginal bleeding, rupture of membranes (ROM), threatened miscarriage, intrauterine infection, maternal death, fetal death (including the death of all children not undergoing abortion), and other adverse events; and (3) psychological evaluation of the patients 1 week postoperatively. Treatment protocols and outcomes Feasibility assessment for MFPR After confirming the pregnancy status of the patients at the time of the outpatient visit to our department, we consulted the clinical ethics board of the hospital, which was made up of experts from other disciplines. Based on the opinion of the board, the MFPR was explained to the patient and her family several times. After written consent was obtained, the patients underwent a preoperative examination to confirm their suitability for the study. The preoperative assessment items included the following: patient background information (age, body mass index [BMI] at non‐pregnancy, expected date of delivery, number of parities, comorbidities, and results of tests for syphilis, hepatitis, and HIV infection); method of conception (presence of infertility treatment, method of infertility treatment, type and amount of drugs used, and number of embryos transferred if in vitro fertilization); and ultrasound evaluations (number of fetuses and diagnosis of chorionicity and amnioticity). In addition to the above, the following evaluations were performed within 1 week of the date of MFPR, and the results were collected: maternal psychological evaluation (Japanese version of State–Trait Anxiety Inventory‐Form JYZ [STAI‐JYZ], Japanese version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [CES‐D]), general condition (BMI, blood pressure, degree of edema, general condition: ASA classification), vaginal examination findings (cervical length, presence of ROM, and presence of vaginal bleeding), urinalysis (urine protein and sugar), blood counts (white blood cell count, neutrophil fraction ratio, red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit level, and platelet count), ultrasound findings (number of viable fetuses and presence of subchorionic hematoma [SCH]), presence of findings suspicious for abnormal pregnancy (intrauterine infection or signs of threatened miscarriage), and other abnormal self and laboratory findings. The psychological evaluations were conducted by clinical psychologists. Evaluation process before and after MFPR Patients were admitted the day before surgery, and ultrasound examinations were performed to confirm the number of viable fetuses and membranous diagnoses. We reconfirmed whether the patients and their partners wished to undergo surgery. Surgery was performed in the operating room primarily under intravenous anesthesia with propofol. An obstetrician managed the anesthesia, monitoring maternal blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and level of consciousness, and administered additional doses as needed. Two obstetricians, including at least one physician designated under the Maternal Health Act, entered the sterile field; one operated the ultrasound machine, and the other performed the puncture. Both physicians were experienced in intrauterine fetal interventions, such as thoracic–amniotic shunt placement and fetal blood transfusion. A 23‐gauge needle was inserted under transabdominal ultrasound guidance into the fetal cardiac cavity (Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Transabdominal ultrasound‐guided fetal cardiac cavity puncture (arrows indicate puncture needle). The following morning, examination confirmed cardiac arrest in the targeted fetuses, the continued viability of the non‐targeted fetuses, and absence of maternal adverse events—vaginal bleeding, SCH, intrauterine infection, ROM, threatened miscarriage, maternal death, or other self‐ or other abnormal symptoms. Patients who completed MFPR were discharged later that same day. Postoperative evaluations after discharge from the hospital One week after surgery (visits were allowed within 4 days before and after surgery), the patients were seen in an outpatient clinic for an internal examination, ultrasound, and psychological examination (STAI‐JYZ and CES‐D). The evaluated outcomes were cervical length, presence of adverse maternal events, and survival of non‐targeted fetuses. Our team's approach to the timing of MFPR The timing for MFPR was set at 11–13 gestational weeks because early miscarriages or the possibility of natural selection for multiple pregnancies can be expected up to approximately 8–10 weeks.  11 After MFPR, pregnancies were uniformly reduced to twins except in cases of serious maternal complications (cardiac, renal, or autoimmune). Targeted fetuses were then selected based on medical considerations: feasibility of safe transabdominal puncture, prioritizing fetuses on the ventral and basolateral uterine surfaces to avoid injury to the amniotic sac and chorionic villi of adjacent fetuses, and avoidance of fetuses sharing the same chorionic villus to prevent KCl diffusion into non‐targeted fetuses. We did not base fetal selection on genetic or sex determination. However, when maternal health could not tolerate multiple pregnancies, fetuses with morphological malformations (anencephaly or fetal hydrops) identified on preoperative ultrasound were chosen for reduction.

Assessment of depression The median preoperative score was 18 points, whereas the median postoperative score was 16 points, indicating slight improvement (Table 3 DISCUSSION MFPR should be performed to “protect the life and health of the mother from the risks associated with the continuation of multiple pregnancies,” which is consistent with the principles of the Maternal Protection Law; therefore, we submit abortion reports to the Osaka Prefectural Government (stating in the remarks column that MFPR was performed). Currently, however, few medical institutions in Japan publicly announce their MFPR practices, and the reality remains unclear. Assessment of MFPR The primary outcome (the completion rate of the operation) was 100%, making it a reliable method for MFPR (Table 2  15  15  16 MFPR with KCl infusion has been performed worldwide, with many studies focusing on the timing of surgery at approximately 11–15 weeks.  8  17  8  17 Assessment of physical safety on MFPR The only adverse maternal event observed in this study was a small amount of genital bleeding, which was acceptable (Table 2  8  18 One concern in this study was the high maternal anesthetic dose. In all cases, blood pressure never fell below 70/50 mmHg during intermittent intraoperative monitoring; however, several cases required 50–100 mg of propofol before induction of anesthesia, possibly because the mothers were very nervous. Although propofol may transiently suppress neurobehavioral function in neonates at high doses (9 mg/kg) during cesarean section,  19 Assessment of psychological safety on MFPR Several studies have evaluated the psychological status of women and their partners following MFPR. Although most studies found that the frequency of depression was not significantly higher among normal mothers or those who did not undergo MFPR, many cases of feelings of guilt and regret that persisted for several years were observed, indicating the importance of providing long‐term postpartum support to mothers and partners.  20  21  22 The results of the psychological tests are presented in Table 3  23 Participants scoring above cutoffs, or those lacking access to psychological support, received individualized psychoeducation from clinical psychologists. Patients with high anxiety and persistent depression throughout pregnancy may require referral to mental health services. Previous research shows that maternal anxiety can influence physiological and metabolic processes, psychosocial adaptation, and fetal brain development.  24  25  26 The long‐term psychological burden may be exacerbated by an inability to express grief for the targeted fetus. Emotional and psychological support beyond the gestational period is therefore critical,  27 Although the planned enrollment period was 2 years, recruitment concluded in 9 months, suggesting greater than expected demand for MFPR consultation. Limitations The study included only 10 cases, and the observation period was limited to 1 week postoperatively to collect reliable outcomes. However, to further evaluate the safety of the procedure, following the outcomes of mothers and fetuses at least until after delivery is essential; such an observational study is currently being planned. The emotional burden on mothers before and after MFPR is severe, and support should continue until after delivery. It is important to provide support not only to the mother herself but also to her partner and family. From this perspective, establishing a system to conduct a nationwide multicenter collaborative study in the future is essential. In conclusion, this is the first prospective study on MFPR in Japan. MFPR was successfully performed by skilled surgeons using echo‐guided transabdominal KCl infusion with careful monitoring. Short‐term maternal and fetal safety was confirmed. However, a longer observation period is needed to assess the long‐term maternal and fetal safety. However, it became clear that even within a short observation period of 1 week postoperatively, the emotional burden on the patient was significant. The importance of long‐term psychological support, including that from partners and family members, has been emphasized.
