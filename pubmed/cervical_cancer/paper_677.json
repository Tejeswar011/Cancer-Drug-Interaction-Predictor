Introduction Cervical cancer (CC) is now the fourth most incident female cancer, following breast, lung and colorectal cancer, respectively. According to the GLOBOCAN, there were 661,021 new cases in 2022 worldwide [ 1 2 Acquisition of anogenital Human Papillomaviruses (HPVs) almost always occurs through sexual contact. The age of first intercourse, number of sexual partners, having unprotected sex, being a sex worker and having a history of sexually transmitted infection are all variables that strongly correlate with the risk of CC, explained by the transmission of HPV via this route [ 3 4 5 However, the transition from an initial persistent HPV infection to CC takes more than 15 years, being slow and gradual. It involves dysplastic infected epithelial cells forming a low-grade intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), which may progress to a high-grade intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) and then to CC. Regressions of LSILs are common, and HSILs more frequently regress or do not evolve than progress to a carcinoma. This well-known natural history provides several opportunities to prevent the development of true precursor lesions by removing them through surgical interventions. The identification of such lesions through massive screening has been undertaken by many countries, implementing the method developed and advocated for by Dr George Papanicolaou. The method, named the “Pap” test after Dr Papanicolaou, basically consists of sampling the cervix and endocervical canal with a spatula, brush or swab and smearing the sample on a glass slide, followed by staining and looking for dysplastic or neoplastic cells under a microscope [ 6 7 7 8 Some technical advances were introduced to the cervical cytology method, including the development of better fixative agents, improved collection devices and semi-automation. The shift to liquid-based cytology (LBC) was a radical change which, unintentionally, facilitated the further adoption of molecular assays. LBC differs from conventional cytology by directly immersing exfoliated cervical cells into a liquid medium containing fixatives. This medium maintains the cells’ morphology while preserving nucleic acids. During the process of cell collection, red cells, microflora and mucus are eliminated, resulting in a thin layer that allows for better visualization of the cellular details [ 9 The observed reduction in the disease burden due to screening has proved in practice that CC is a preventable disease. In fact, it is, so far, the only human cancer that may be eradicated, through the adoption of screening in addition to immunization [ 10 11 12 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other nucleic acid amplification methods (NAATs) started to be used in clinical practice at the end of the last century. Improvements in automation and reagents progressively allowed for the expansion of the NAAT portfolio, particularly regarding the diagnostics of infectious agents. Virology benefited from these advances since viral diagnostics was usually performed through serology, i.e., examining the presence of specific antibodies, or culture methods, with both approaches presenting some drawbacks due to cross-reactivity and non-culturable viruses, respectively. HPV testing started to b used by gynecologists to elucidate undetermined cytology results, mainly for smears classified as ASCs-US (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance); when classified as HPV+, they would require further investigation, whereas when they were negative, they were considered a false-positive Pap test result. Since HPV had been determined to be a necessary cause of CC and there was the possibility of developing high-throughput testing methods for it, experts carried out large cohort studies comparing the performance of HPV-DNA to that of cytology in screening settings. These studies unambiguously demonstrated higher sensitivity for HPV-DNA, in addition to other advantages such as the possibility of expanding the screening interval to 5 years due to this increased sensitivity and the slow evolution from HPV infection to cervical lesions, a higher throughput and objective analysis, in comparison to the subjectivity of the Pap test [ 13 Owing to these major scientific and technological advances, the elimination of CC is now feasible. This has led the WHO to outline practical actions to achieve this [ 14 By the year 2030, adhering countries must have achieved the following: A total of 90% of girls up to 15 years old must have been vaccinated. A total of 70% of women >25 years old must have been screened at least twice, at the ages of 35 and 45, using a high-performance test (NAAT). A total of 90% of women with precancer and cancer must have been appropriately treated. By implementing these three measures, countries should reduce the incidence of CC to below 4/100,000, the threshold of elimination defined from a public health perspective. 2. Sensitivity or Specificity: The Permanent Diagnostic Dilemma Screening for any condition is by definition an initial step where the aim is to detect all true-positive subjects, inevitably resulting in false positives. Molecular amplification methods fit very well in this diagnostic space since their most notable characteristic is their ability to detect minimal amounts of RNA or DNA templates, i.e., their high sensitivity. Testing for HPV DNA or RNA allows for the detection of almost all cervical cancers and precursor lesions, allowing for early intervention and, in many cases, a cure. The drawback basically comes from the fact that HPV is quite a common sexually transmitted agent. Moreover, the most oncogenic HPV type, HPV 16, is also one of the most prevalent HPV types among healthy women [ 15 16 17 18 19 13 13 20 21 The aim of this review is to describe and contextualize the CC screening and triage methods in use and those under development and validation. 3. Molecular Screening So far, all new CC screening methods have targeted HPV nucleic acids. Historically, Hybrid Capture (HC) was the first assay to be translated into clinical use, mostly in the context mentioned above, to clarify dubious cytology results. Subsequently, it was also the first to be adopted in studies evaluating molecular screening vs. cytology, with convincing results. With the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), assays relying on this have progressively replaced HC. HC lacks the use of an endogenous human gene as an internal control, which is understood as a fundamental component of any molecular amplification method. Based on the knowledge that neoplastic cells need to express mRNA coding for the E6 and E7 viral oncogenes, methods detecting their presence would theoretically have higher specificity for grade 2+ cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CINs), the true precursors of CC, eliminating HPV-DNA+/mRNA- samples from triage. In practice, methods targeting mRNA have shown clinical performance similar to that of HPV-DNA assays [ 22 Nowadays, there are at least 48 countries using HPV assays as their primary screening tool [ 23 24 25 The market for CC screening is significant, in principle constituting all women between 30 (or 25) and 65 years old on Earth, comprising approximately 1.8 billion people. If all these women had an HPV screening test every 5 years as recommended, there would be a need for 360 million tests/year, creating the largest demand for any molecular assay in laboratory medicine. This has attracted the interest of the industry, and hundreds of HPV assays are now available on the market. However, most of them have not been tested in clinical trials, and some lack essential performance data [ 26 25 27 Table 1 o Tests should preferentially target only the 12 genotypes classified as carcinogenic (HPVs 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 and 59). o A sensitivity ≥ 95% for CIN2+ and specificity ≥ 98% for ≤CIN1. o The sensitivity and specificity values stated above must be derived from at least three validation studies comparing the test to one of the first-generation assays fulfilling the VALGENT criteria. Remarkably, these four assays still include HPVs 66 and 68 as targets for screening, since they were developed and validated before the WHO recommended removing these two high-risk HPV genotypes from screening assays, as they reduce the clinical specificity without improving the sensitivity [ 16 4. Triage Alternatives Cytology is currently the most used triage method for HPV-DNA/RNA+ samples. Usually, patients showing Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASCs-US) or higher-grade results (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, LSILs; Atypical Squamous Cells; cannot exclude a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, ASC-H; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, HSILs) are referred to colposcopy, while those with normal cytology are invited to have their next screening round after a shorter time interval, typically 1–3 years, instead of the regular 5 years for those found to be HPV-negative. Another common algorithm takes into consideration the oncogenic potential of the HPV genotype present in the sample. Patients harboring either HPV 16 or 18 are directly referred for a colposcopy, obviating the need for an intermediary cytology assessment. This direct flow is based on the risk of HPV 16/18 carriers to present a prevalent CIN 2+ which is between 5 and 15% [ 29 Figure 1 4.1. HPV Genotyping While there are 12 HPV genotypes that are definitely oncogenic and need to be included as targets in any CC screening method, assays may differ in how they identify these 12 HPVs, whether individually or grouped, and in the latter case, what sort of grouping they use. Assays unable to at least individually identify HPVs 16 and 18, like Hybrid Capture II, are clearly outdated, since clinicians and public health authorities require this information. Hence, the standard format of the current CC screening assays is to identify these two highly oncogenic viruses individually and another 12 HPV genotypes grouped into a high-risk non-16/non-18 category. In fact, this group of oncogenic HPVs for which detection is mandatory was, until recently, composed of 14 genotypes: HPVs 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 66 and 68. As mentioned above, HPVs 66 and 68 were subsequently proven to carry very low or no oncogenic potential; thus, their inclusion in screening assays could lead to a substantial loss of clinical specificity, unnecessary follow-ups and overtreatment. Consequently, their exclusion from molecular screening assays is recommended [ 27 16 30 31 4.2. DNA Methylation DNA methylation is an epigenetic mechanism for controlling gene expression. In general, methylated genes are silenced, while non-methylated genes are prone to being expressed. The methylation of growth suppressor genes is an early event in carcinogenesis and has been increasingly explored in cancer diagnostics. In cervical carcinogenesis, several host and viral genes are methylated, as described in Ref. [ 32 33 34 35 4.3. Dual Stain Here, a dual stain (DS) refers to an immunocytochemistry assay commercially named CINTec Plus™ (Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis, IN, USA ). This assay targets two proteins that interfere with the cell cycle: p16, which normally blocks cell cycle progression and is overexpressed as a response to Rb protein inactivation by the HR-HPV E7 [ 36 37 Figure 2 38 4.4. Point-of-Care (POC) and New Molecular Assays We may separate POC HPV molecular assays into two groups: those using amplification methods and instruments providing all the reagents for extraction, amplification and genotyping in a single cartridge, generally with a very low throughput and high cost, and those relying on isothermal amplification, which may be carried out at room temperature or in simple 37 °C incubators, which have a variable throughput and low cost. Though, in principle, these have been developed for the same purpose, i.e., HPV detection for CC screening, they are adopted in very different settings: the former are used in more affluent environments, and the latter are more appropriate for use in less developed and more remote regions. An example belonging to the first group is the Xpert HPV (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), which has been prequalified for CC screening by the WHO [ 39 The second group is represented by isothermal amplification techniques, such as LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification). LAMP assays were greatly improved and widely deployed during the COVID-19 epidemic. These methods are particularly advantageous for use in regions with few resources as they operate at a constant temperature and do not require complex equipment such as thermocyclers and fluorescence readers.

Conclusions The Nobel Prize of Medicine awarded to Prof. Harald zur Hausen in 2008 paid tribute to his tenacious pursue of the link between HPV and CC [ 43 Acknowledgments We dedicate this article to the memory of José Eluf-Neto.
