The gene comprises 9 exons and 8 introns, forming a complex genomic structure (NCBI Gene ID: 255877). Alternative splicing of the BCL6B coding region produces six mRNA variants and multiple protein isoforms, each potentially contributing to unique cellular roles. BCL6B mRNA is widely expressed across human tissues, with the highest abundance observed in the heart and placenta. It is also found in various cell types, particularly in activated lymphocytes and certain tumor cells 3 6 Structural Characteristics and Functional Domains of BCL6B Protein The BCL6B protein functions as a transcriptional repressor, utilizing zinc finger domains to bind specific DNA sequences and regulate target gene expression 8 1 BTB/POZ Domain At the N-terminus of BCL6B lies the BTB (Broad-complex, Tramtrack, and Bric-à-brac)/POZ (Pox virus and Zinc finger) domain, which shares approximately 65% sequence similarity with that of BCL6. This domain interacts with the mammalian Switch-Independent 3A (mSIN3A), the silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors (SMRT), and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), collectively forming the SMRT/mSIN3A/HDAC transcriptional repressor complex those silences downstream gene expression. Notably, BCL6B and BCL6 competitively regulate the expression of the tumor suppressor gene P53, with BCL6 itself being a direct target of ZBTB28. This dynamic interaction constitutes the BCL6B-BCL6-P53 regulatory axis, which plays a pivotal role in tumor suppression 9 10 11 12 Intermediate Region The central region of BCL6B 6 8 B Zinc Finger Domain At the C-terminus, BCL6B contains five tandemly repeated Cys2-His2-type Krüppel-like zinc finger domains, in contrast to the six present in BCL6, with a high overall sequence homology of 94%. Theα-helical region plays a critical role in determining DNA-binding sequence specificity. These zinc finger domains specifically bind to BCL6 DNA-binding sequences, which are similar to those of STAT, and may inhibit IL-4-induced transcription 6 1 The Biological Functions of BCL6B Role of BCL6B in Transcriptional Repression BCL6B exerts its biological functions—such as tumor suppression, immune modulation, stem cell maintenance, and angiogenesis—primarily through its role as a transcriptional repressor. Mechanistic studies have shown that BCL6B, often in cooperation with BCL6, binds to DNA sequences recognized by the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family, thereby inhibiting the transcription of STAT-responsive genes 13 14 In addition, BCL6B 10 Pathways Involving BCL6B BCL6B is involved in the regulation of several key signaling pathways, such as Notch, VEGFR, STAT, PI3K/AKT, and p53, all of which play central roles in controlling cellular proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis 6 11 Future research should aim to delineate additional signaling networks influenced by BCL6B and clarify its context-specific mechanisms across various cancer types. These insights may uncover novel therapeutic targets and contribute to precision oncology. Cellular Functions of BCL6B Aberrant BCL6B expression is associated with dysregulation of key cellular processes, including the inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing cell cycle arrest, promoting apoptosis, and downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins. These findings demonstrate that BCL6B exerts a dual regulatory role in cancer biology by simultaneously blocking tumor cell growth and facilitating programmed cell death. Given its critical influence on both normal and malignant cell behavior, BCL6B is increasingly recognized as a pivotal regulator in tumor initiation and progression. Investigating its molecular mechanisms in greater depth may lead to innovative therapeutic approaches that leverage BCL6B's pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative functions to combat cancer more effectively. Research Progress on BCL6B in Tumors BCL6B is involved in a wide range of biological processes, including stem cell maintenance, angiogenesis, and immune regulation. Recent studies have increasingly focused on its potential roles in tumor initiation, progression, and prognosis. Tumorigenesis is a complex multistep process driven by the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, leading to dysregulated cell growth and eventual malignant transformation. As a transcriptional repressor, BCL6B regulates gene expression by modulating both oncogenic and tumor suppressive pathways, highlighting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Understanding the molecular mechanisms through which BCL6B affects tumor biology is therefore of significant clinical relevance 9 Gene expression profiling indicates that BCL6B is broadly expressed in normal human tissues, with particularly high levels in adipose tissue, lung, and placenta. However, its expression patterns vary across tumor types. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveal upregulated BCL6B expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, thyroid cancer, and glioblastoma. Conversely, downregulated BCL6B expression is observed in bladder urothelial carcinoma, invasive breast cancer, chromophobe renal carcinoma, renal papillary cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, endometrial cancer, and cervical cancers. Emerging evidence suggests that BCL6B is closely associated with the initiation, progression, and clinical outcomes of multiple malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), gastric cancer (GC), breast cancer (BC), colorectal cancer (CRC), lung cancer (LC), thyroid cancer (TC), cervical cancer (CC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), and lymphomas. In many of these cancers, BCL6B expression is silenced through promoter CpG island hypermethylation, a common epigenetic mechanism that contributes to tumor suppressor gene inactivation. Xiang T et al. 9 Research on BCL6B in Hematologic Malignancies As noted earlier, BCL6B contains all three essential domains required for sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional repression, suggesting that it may share target genes and regulatory functions with BCL6. Given their structural and functional similarities, it has been hypothesized that BCL6B may also play a role in hematological malignancies, particularly lymphomas 15 In 2002, Sakashita C et al. 1 Research on BCL6B in Gastric Cancer (GC) In 2012, Xu L et al. 16 its role as a Additionally, multivariate COX regression analysis indicated that BCL6B methylation serves as an independent prognostic factor 17 In contrast, Deng J et al. 18 19 In an in vivo 20 Research on BCL6B in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) In 2014, Jia W et al. 21 Mechanistically, BCL6B promotes apoptosis via activation of caspase cascades and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and inhibits metastasis by upregulating tumor suppressors such as E-cadherin, OB-cadherin, HTATIP2, and TRPM1, while downregulating VEGFA. Importantly, BCL6B expression is negatively associated with advanced tumor stage, metastasis, and poor prognosis in HCC patients. In 2015, Weilin W et al. 22 23 Research on BCL6B in Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Early studies on BCL6B in colorectal cancer (CRC) revealed that its promoter methylation leads to transcriptional silencing, thereby promoting CRC progression. Re-expression of BCL6B suppresses CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration by activating the p53 signaling pathway, inducing G1/S phase arrest 24 25 27 28 29 Research on BCL6B in Breast Cancer (BC) In 2017, Anne BK et al. 30 31 In 2022, Li L et al. 32 Research on BCL6B in Other Solid Tumors Research on BCL6B in other solid tumors remains in the exploratory phase, with limited studies available. Juan W et al. 33 34 35 36 37 Research Progress on BCL6B in Immune Responses The BCL6 gene encodes a transcriptional repressor protein that plays a critical role in regulating the expression of genes in lymphocyte and myeloid lineages 38 40 39 41 In vivo 42 44 As the closest homolog to BCL6, BCL6B is believed to exert important immunomodulatory functions. BCL6B mRNA is detected in naive CD4 + + 7 1 6 + + 45 BCL6B 46 In addition, BCL6B is implicated in the regulation of macrophage and hematopoietic progenitor responses to IL-6, potentially via mechanisms shared with BCL6, including suppression of IL-6 synthesis 38 BCL6B belongs to the BTB-ZF (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack, Bric-à-brac - Zinc Finger) protein family. Members of this family are recognized as critical transcriptional regulators of hematopoietic development and differentiation 47 BCL6B expression is also conserved in non-mammalian species, indicating an evolutionarily conserved role in immune regulation. In grass carp, BCL6B expression has been detected in immune-related organs including the gills, intestine, spleen, and head kidney, suggesting a systemic immunological role. Furthermore, several splice variants of BCL6B (BCL6BX1, BCL6BX2, and BCL6BX3) have been identified, with expression levels significantly upregulated in response to polyinosinic acid (PolyI) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in the spleen 48 Research on BCL6B in T Cell Activation and Differentiation BCL6B regulates the expression of multiple genes in T cells, thereby influencing their proliferation, differentiation, and functionality. For instance, BCL6B suppresses key genes within the TCR signaling pathway, modulating T cell activation and proliferation. Additionally, BCL6B affects T cell effector function by regulating cytokine gene expression 7 Role of BCL6B in CD8 + In 2005, Peter M et al. 45 + While BCL6B-deficient mice show normal primary CD8⁺ T cell responses to viral infection, their memory recall responses are markedly impaired in both in vivo in vitro 46 46 7 46 37 Role of BCL6B in BCL6B + In 2004, Mikio T et al. 7 in vitro Moreover, ectopic expression of BCL6B leads to hyperproliferation of naive CD4⁺ T cells following TCR engagement, whereas memory CD4⁺ T cells remain unaffected. These findings underscore BCL6B's critical role in naive CD4⁺ T cell activation and expansion, reinforcing its functional distinction from BCL6. Research on BCL6B in B Cell Activation and Differentiation B cell development from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to memory cells or plasma cells is tightly orchestrated by a network of transcription factors. For example, PU.1 (Purine-rich box 1) is tightly orchestrated by a network of transcription factors 49 50 50 51 52 Given its classification as a BTB/POZ-ZF transcription factor, BCL6B may influence B cell development and activation. In 1993, Ye et al. 3 53 Members of the POK/ZBTB family, including BCL6B, can form homo- or heterodimers via their BTB/POZ domains 12 54 4 13 BCL6B 1 Research on BCL6B in Macrophages (Mφ) In 2022, Li L et al. 32 Research Progress on BCL6B in the Renewal of Spermatogonial Stem Cells (SSCs) In 2006, Oatley JM et al. 55 in vivo 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 BCL6B 63 64 in vitro 65 62 Research Progress on BCL6B in Angiogenesis The high expression of BCL6B in vascular endothelial cells suggests a potential role in angiogenesis. In 2012, BCL6B was identified as a mediator linking VEGF and Notch signaling pathways. Database analyses have shown that BCL6B is highly expressed at the mRNA level in human endothelial cells. Studies suggest that BCL6B 11 BCL6B 66 67 53 61 Conclusion The BCL6B gene, a member of the ZBTB (zinc finger and BTB domain-containing) protein family, functions as a multifunctional transcription factor with significant implications in both fundamental and clinical research. As a homolog of BCL6, it represses gene expression through its BTB/POZ domain, central region, and zinc finger domain. BCL6B modulates key signaling pathways, including Notch, VEGFR, STAT, PI3K/AKT, and P53, that play critical roles in regulating cellular proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. These characteristics make BCL6B an essential regulator in gene expression and a promising target for therapeutic intervention. In tumor biology, BCL6B has demonstrated notable tumor-suppressive activity. Aberrant expression of BCL6B, frequently caused by promoter hypermethylation, is reported in several solid tumors, such as hepatocellular, gastric, breast, and colorectal cancers, as well as hematological malignancies. These epigenetic alterations lead to reduced expression of BCL6B, correlating with increased tumor proliferation, migration, and invasiveness. Reactivating BCL6B expression or reversing its promoter methylation has been shown to reduce tumor aggressiveness, underscoring its therapeutic potential. Moreover, reduced BCL6B levels in cancers like liver and gastric cancer are strongly linked to poor survival outcomes, indicating its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker (Table 1 Beyond oncology, BCL6B plays a pivotal role in immune regulation, particularly in the T and B lymphocytes. Research suggests that BCL6B enhances secondary immune responses by regulating CD8 + + 2 In angiogenesis, BCL6B has emerged as a key regulatory factor. Its high expression in vascular endothelial cells and its regulation of VEGF and Notch signaling position it as a critical player in vascular biology. These functions suggest new therapeutic avenues for treating ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions. Furthermore, in regenerative medicine, contributes to the maintenance of stem cell homeostasis through signaling pathways such as GDNF and FGF highlights its therapeutic potential in addressing disorders involving stem cell dysfunction (Table 3 Future research on BCL6B should expand mechanistic studies to elucidate its molecular role in tumorigenesis, immune modulation, and angiogenesis, with a particular focus on its epigenetic regulation and crosstalk among key signaling pathways (Figure 2 Clinically, BCL6B holds considerable promise as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target. Non-invasive diagnostic tools, such as liquid biopsies detecting BCL6B promoter methylation in circulating plasma DNA, could enable early cancer detection and prediction of treatment response. The development of targeted therapies, including small-molecule inhibitors and epigenetic modulators, offers a pathway to restore BCL6B function. Moreover, gene-editing technologies like CRISPR/Cas9 could be leveraged to precisely correct BCL6B mutations or aberrant methylation, further enhancing therapeutic precision. Integrating interdisciplinary research will further expand the clinical utility of BCL6B. Its role in autoimmune diseases, angiogenesis, and regenerative medicine highlights its versatility as a therapeutic target. Combining immunotherapeutic approaches with BCL6B modulation could enhance anti-tumor immunity, while its regulation of vascular pathways offers innovative treatments for ischemic and vascular diseases. The integration of basic research with clinical applications will not only enrich our understanding of BCL6B but also pave the way for its translation into effective therapies, positioning BCL6B as a cornerstone of next-generation biomedical innovation. As a multifunctional transcription factor, the BCL6B gene is of great significance in both basic and clinical research. Research on BCL6B, spanning tumor suppression, immune modulation, stem cell homeostasis, angiogenesis, molecular mechanisms, and therapeutic innovations, enhances our understanding of gene regulatory systems and support the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Integrating basic research with clinical applications will further broaden the research prospects of BCL6B.
