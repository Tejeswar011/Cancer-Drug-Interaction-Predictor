Neuroimaging findings include linear perivascular enhancement in the white matter extending in a radial pattern, periependymal enhancement, longitudinally extensive cord signal changes, intramedullary enhancement, optic neuritis, and papillitis. SUMMARY: Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) astrocytopathy is a recently described autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the CNS characterized by the presence of specific antibodies targeting the intracellular filament protein in mature astrocytes. The pathogenesis is heterogeneous and poorly understood, with around 20%–34% of cases occurring as a paraneoplastic syndrome, most frequently associated with ovarian teratomas. It presents clinically as acute or subacute encephalomyelitis, and the diagnosis relies on imaging and detection of GFAP-Immunoglobulin (GFAP-IgG) in the CSF. Characteristic imaging findings include linear perivascular enhancement in the white matter extending in a radial pattern. Other imaging findings include periependymal enhancement, longitudinally extensive cord signal changes, intramedullary enhancement, optic neuritis, and papillitis. There is significant imaging overlap with other neuroinflammatory diseases like neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and lymphoproliferative conditions. GFAP astrocytopathy is characteristically responsive to steroids with, however, a significant rate of relapse. Currently, literature on this novel entity is limited with no established diagnostic criteria or standard treatment regimen. This comprehensive review explores the clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic aspects of GFAP astrocytopathy, shedding light on its complex nature and potential diagnostic challenges. The paper highlights the neuroimaging findings with a focus on differentiating GFAP astrocytopathy from other neuroinflammatory disorders. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
