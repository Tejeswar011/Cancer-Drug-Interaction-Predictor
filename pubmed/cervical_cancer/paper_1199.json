Introduction As the most abundant non-metallic element on Earth, carbon is not only a fundamental unit of biological systems but also a crucial cornerstone in modern materials science. Among its various allotropes, graphene has emerged as a focal point in nanomaterials research due to its unique two-dimensional structure and outstanding physicochemical properties. Graphene consists of a single layer of sp 2 2 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 In the medical field, graphene’s high surface area and excellent biocompatibility [ 7 8 Due to the growing attention on GBNs in the field of drug delivery, the number of related publications has been continuously increasing. According to statistics ( Figure 1 Although graphene and its derivatives (Graphene-Family Nanomaterials, GFNs) show great potential in drug delivery, their clinical translation still faces significant challenges. These include biosafety, toxicity mechanisms, and long-term metabolic behavior, all of which remain largely uncertain. Existing studies have shown that graphene materials can exhibit favorable biocompatibility under specific conditions. However, under varying doses, particle sizes, surface modifications, and exposure durations, they may induce cytotoxicity, immune responses, or organ accumulation. This highlights the urgent need for systematic evaluation. The metabolic and degradative pathways of graphene within the body remain unclear, and its long-term retention may induce adverse effects, including chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and even carcinogenesis. Moreover, the mechanisms by which functional modifications influence the biological behavior of graphene are not yet fully elucidated. Factors such as the type, density, and spatial distribution of functional groups may significantly affect their blood circulation dynamics, tissue targeting capability, and clearance processes. Against this backdrop, there is an urgent need to investigate the relationship between graphene’s physicochemical properties and its biological responses, starting from material structure. In particular, A deeper understanding is needed of interaction mechanisms in the delivery of small molecules, macromolecules, and nucleic acid therapeutics. This will guide the rational design of safe and efficient GFN-based delivery systems. Based on the above background, this review aims to systematically summarize the research progress of GFNs in drug delivery systems, with a particular focus on their loading mechanisms, targeting strategies, and controlled release methods in the delivery of small molecules, macromolecules, and nucleic acid-based drugs. In Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 We begin by examining the relationship between material structure and biological response. From the core literature highlighted in Figure 1 2. Preparation, Drug Loading, and Targeted Delivery Strategies of GFNs 2.1. Preparation Methods of GFNs Over more than a century of technological evolution, graphene synthesis methods have become increasingly diverse, resulting in a variety of distinct fabrication strategies. Currently, commonly used graphene preparation techniques include chemical oxidation (e.g., the Hummers method), mechanical exfoliation, liquid-phase exfoliation, electrochemical exfoliation, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Among these, GO is the most widely used form of GFNs. Its synthesis has evolved from the Brodie and Staudenmaier methods to the widely adopted Hummers method [ 10 2.1.1. Mechanical Methods for Graphene Synthesis Mechanical exfoliation is one of the earliest classical methods used to isolate monolayer graphene, based on the principle of physically peeling off graphene layers from bulk graphite. This technique was first applied by Geim and Novoselov [ 11 12 Specific forms of mechanical exfoliation include adhesive tape, AFM probes, ultrasonic agitation [ 13 14 Figure 2 2 The greatest advantage of mechanical exfoliation lies in the exceptionally high quality of the resulting graphene. It features an intact lattice structure with minimal defects, outstanding electron mobility, and superior mechanical properties. These qualities make it ideal for studying the intrinsic physical properties of graphene. However, mechanical exfoliation also presents significant limitations, including very low yield, poor process reproducibility, reliance on manual operation, and unsuitability for large-scale production. As a result, this method is currently primarily used in laboratory settings to obtain high-quality graphene samples, rather than for the industrial synthesis of GO [ 15 2.1.2. CVD Method Although mechanical exfoliation of graphite crystals can yield high-quality graphene at the microscale, this method is not suitable for large-scale production [ 11 Copper-based CVD synthesis is a reliable method for producing high-quality graphene films with controllable thickness [ 16 17 18 19 Figure 3 4 Adsorption of methane onto the copper surface; Partial dehydrogenation of methane to form carbon-containing species, such as CH x Surface diffusion of these carbon species on the copper substrate; Nucleation of graphene at active sites on the copper surface, forming graphene nuclei; Adsorption of carbon species at the edges of graphene nuclei, promoting grain growth; Coalescence of adjacent graphene grains, resulting in the formation of polycrystalline graphene films [ 20 21 22 23 24 The main advantage of the CVD method is its ability to control the number of graphene layers while maintaining lattice integrity. This results in graphene with excellent continuity and flatness, making it ideal for high-end applications such as electronic devices, flexible displays, and sensors. However, upon cooling from the high synthesis temperatures to room temperature, CVD-grown graphene exhibits negative thermal expansion, and lateral contraction of the metal substrate can lead to the formation of nanoscale particles. Additionally, the inherent surface roughness and step edges of the Cu substrate can induce sub-nanometer ripples in the graphene structure. These ripples, caused by thermodynamic or morphological factors, can significantly impact the electrical properties of graphene. On the other hand, CVD-grown graphene often exhibits polycrystallinity, a result of graphene grains growing in random directions after nucleation. As a result, its grain boundaries differ from those of HOPG, often containing non-hexagonal carbon rings, vacancies, and other structural defects. These structural defects, including ripples and grain boundaries, show enhanced chemical reactivity [ 25 26 2.1.3. Hummer’s Method for GO Preparation In 1958, Hummers and Offeman proposed a milder and more operable synthesis method, now widely known as the Hummers method, which utilizes a combination of H 2 4 3 4 Figure 4 2 4 3 4 2 2 3 27 28 4 2 4 29 2.2. Drug Loading of GFNs With the continuous advancement of nanomedicine, drug delivery systems are rapidly evolving toward precision and intelligence. In this context, the structural tunability and surface functional diversity of carrier materials have become key factors in enhancing delivery efficiency. Graphene-based materials, owing to their excellent water dispersibility, biocompatibility, and rich interaction mechanisms with drug molecules, exhibit outstanding drug-loading potential [ 30 Non-covalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic adsorption [ 31 32 Covalent linkages, including amide bonds, ester bonds, and phosphoester bonds [ 33 Hydrophobic small-molecule drugs typically bind to the aromatic carbon backbone of graphene-based materials through π–π stacking interactions, stabilized further by hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonding. This binding strategy forms stable complexes and preserves drug structure. It avoids the disruption typically caused by chemical modifications [ 34 35 36 8 Figure 5 2.2.1. Delivery of Hydrophobic Small-Molecule Drugs Hydrophobic small-molecule drugs, due to their poor water solubility and tendency to aggregate in biological fluids without specific distribution, often suffer from low bioavailability, poor targeting, and high systemic toxicity, which limits their widespread clinical application [ 31 37 38 39 In most graphene-based drug delivery systems, researchers often combine multiple physical processes and surface modification strategies to construct composite delivery platforms. Specifically, commonly used physical methods include: High-intensity ultrasonication to promote drug intercalation or to induce hollow structure formation in the material [ 40 41 42 43 44 Graphene and its derivatives can also be significantly enhanced in drug affinity and environmental responsiveness through surface chemical modification. For example, using EDC/NHS coupling reactions to graft hydrophilic or targeting functional molecules such as hyaluronic acid (HA) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) can improve circulatory stability and targeting recognition ability in vivo [ 45 46 9 Overall, the interaction between GFNs and hydrophobic drugs primarily relies on non-covalent adsorption mechanisms. Building upon this foundation, the integration of physical techniques—such as ultrasonication, stirring incubation, and interfacial assembly—combined with surface functionalization strategies, not only enhances drug-loading capacity, but also offers diverse approaches for controlled release and targeted therapy. The following section will explore, using representative drugs as examples, the specific binding mechanisms between these agents and GFNs, along with a comprehensive evaluation of their pharmacological effects. The loading of hydrophobic drugs onto GO-based materials typically relies on π–π stacking interactions mediated by the aromatic ring structures within the drug molecules. This process is often accompanied by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding, resulting in the formation of stable non-covalent complexes. For example, a variety of drugs including paclitaxel (PTX) [ 43 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 49 53 Building upon these mechanisms, some studies have further introduced covalent modification strategies. For example, PTX or DOX can be pre-functionalized with carboxyl or amino groups and then covalently coupled to GO via amide bond formation. This enhances drug-binding stability and improves controlled release. In particular, DOX is often designed as a pH-responsive covalently linked system [ 48 54 In summary, aromatic structures, hydrophobicity, and polar functional groups play crucial roles in mediating interactions between hydrophobic drugs and GO. The choice and optimization of binding modes critically influence the stability of the drug carrier system, as well as its controlled-release behavior and targeting efficiency. 2.2.2. Delivery of Hydrophilic Small-Molecule Drugs Compared to hydrophobic drugs, hydrophilic molecules tend to diffuse, degrade, or clear quickly in vivo. This is due to their high water solubility and polar groups, which reduces stability and therapeutic efficacy. The high specific surface area and abundant surface oxygen-containing functional groups of GFNs enable them to form stable delivery complexes with hydrophilic drugs through multiple mechanisms, including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic adsorption, or covalent bonding. This effectively enhances the in vivo stability, controlled-release capability, and targeting efficiency of hydrophilic drugs [ 55 In constructing GFNs-based delivery systems for hydrophilic drugs, researchers commonly employ strategies such as physical adsorption, covalent bonding, and composite material encapsulation to achieve stable drug loading and controlled release [ 56 57 58 59 In addition to single-material modifications, GFNs are also commonly used to construct composite carriers, such as nanofiber membranes, hydrogels, and porous microsphere systems [ 60 61 62 Due to their abundant polar functional groups, hydrophilic drugs can readily form non-covalent interactions with the GO surface through mechanisms such as hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, thereby achieving stable loading and controlled release [ 63 For example, aminoglycoside antibiotics represented by gentamicin, which are rich in amino and hydroxyl functional groups, can firmly adsorb onto the GO surface, demonstrating excellent sustained-release properties [ 64 65 66 67 67 In addition to the typical antimicrobial drugs mentioned above, certain hydrophilic small molecules such as metformin, (dexamethasone)dexamethasone, and methotrexate can also form stable complexes with GO through mechanisms including hydrogen bonding, electrostatic adsorption, or covalent modification. For example, the guanidine and amino groups in metformin can form amide bonds with carboxyl groups on the GO surface via EDC/NHS coupling reactions. Alternatively, metformin can be adsorbed through hydrogen bonding onto PEG-functionalized or nitrogen-doped GO quantum dots, achieving sustained-release effects [ 68 69 70 71 72 Overall, the binding of hydrophilic drugs to GO-based carriers is primarily governed by polar interactions, supplemented by π–π stacking and covalent modifications. Through rational design of material structure and interfacial chemistry, the delivery efficiency and therapeutic targeting of hydrophilic drugs can be significantly enhanced in complex physiological environments such as infections and tumors. 2.2.3. Delivery of Macromolecular Drugs GBNs exhibit significant advantages in the delivery of macromolecular drugs, particularly for biologics such as proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids, which possess complex molecular structures and poor stability. In research, delivery systems are often constructed in combination with aptamers to achieve targeted recognition and efficient loading [ 73 74 In terms of processing methods, non-covalent adsorption between GBNs and macromolecular drugs is commonly achieved through techniques such as direct mixing, ultrasonication, and stirring incubation. For example, positively charged siRNA or aptamers can be dissolved in buffer and co-incubated with GBNs, enabling electrostatically induced self-assembly adsorption [ 75 76 77 For systems requiring high long-term stability and precise control, covalent modification of GBNs is particularly critical. By chemically coupling drugs or recognition elements to the surface of GBNs, these components can be stably anchored, preventing desorption during the delivery process and enhancing both recognition specificity and therapeutic targeting [ 78 79 Taking insulin as an example, its molecular structure contains a large number of polar residues [ 80 81 82 81 83 84 85 Specifically, antibody drugs such as Trastuzumab are high-molecular-weight immunoglobulins containing abundant aromatic amino acids (such as tyrosine and tryptophan) as well as charged groups. Their binding to GO primarily relies on two mechanisms: on one hand, π–π stacking interactions between the aromatic structures of the antibody and the GO surface enable stable adsorption. On the other hand, positively charged structures within the antibody (such as lysine side chains) can form electrostatic interactions with carboxyl groups on the GO surface, resulting in the formation of a non-covalent composite system. Such systems can enhance the stability and residence time of the drug in tumor-targeted delivery while maintaining the biological activity of the antibody [ 86 Vaccine antigens, as protein-structured biomacromolecules, possess high polarity and charge characteristics, particularly due to exposed carboxyl groups, amino groups, and hydrophobic regions on their surfaces. In GO-based composite vaccine platforms, antigens can be electrostatically adsorbed onto the GO surface, while also participating in metal ion-induced (e.g., Zn 2+ 87 Nucleic acid molecules such as siRNA and plasmid DNA [ 88 89 90 In summary, to address the structural characteristics and biological delivery requirements of macromolecular drugs, researchers have developed a variety of GO-based drug-loading strategies. These primarily include: Non-covalent adsorption methods based on mixed adsorption; Ultrasonication-assisted dispersion techniques; Electrospinning encapsulation methods; And covalent grafting approaches aimed at enhancing binding stability. Each of these strategies offers distinct advantages in practical applications. Their selection and optimization must be tailored according to factors such as drug molecular properties, delivery pathways, physiological environments, and therapeutic targets. By systematically optimizing the choice of methods based on drug characteristics, release scenarios, and targeting strategies, a solid foundation has been established for constructing functionalized and controllable macromolecular delivery systems. 2.3. Targeted Delivery of GFNs To overcome the limitations of traditional nanomaterials in drug delivery—such as low efficiency, nonspecific distribution, and potential toxicity—researchers have developed various functionalized GO-based nanodelivery systems. By applying surface modification techniques (such as targeting molecule conjugation, introduction of stimuli-responsive structures, and multifunctional integration), different carriers can be attached to the GO surface. For example, functionalized GO has been integrated with aptamer-targeting modules to improve tumor selectivity and gene delivery efficacy [ 91 92 93 94 95 2.3.1. Enhanced Targeting via Ligand Surface Modification By conjugating small-molecule ligands, peptides, aptamers, or antibodies as biorecognition units, the selective recognition ability of graphene carriers toward tumor cells can be significantly enhanced. For example, Jiahui Lu et al. [ 53 72 96 Li et al. [ 97 98 3 4 99 100 101 102 Other studies, such as the DOX@NGOBBN system, have demonstrated targeted drug release for oral squamous cell carcinoma along with good stability, showing potential clinical value in enhancing therapeutic selectivity and reducing side effects for future oral cancer treatments [ 103 86 104 2.3.2. Stimuli-Responsive Release: pH-Triggered Controlled Release Strategy Tumor tissues typically exhibit a slightly acidic microenvironment (pH 5.0–6.5), providing a targetable condition for the development of pH-responsive nanodrug delivery systems. Researchers have achieved controlled drug release in the acidic tumor microenvironment by introducing pH-sensitive linkages (such as hydrazone bonds, carboxyl groups, and amide bonds) and constructing stimuli-responsive encapsulation and dissociation systems. For instance, Dilip O et al. [ 47 105 106 In addition, Qiu et al. [ 107 108 109 110 3. Applications of GFNs Delivery Systems in Different Diseases 3.1. Cancer Therapy 3.1.1. Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among women worldwide and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in women [ 111 112 113 114 To address the challenges mentioned above, researchers are actively exploring novel nanodrug delivery systems. GFNs can be functionalized through surface modification to enable both covalent and non-covalent binding with various drugs and targeting molecules [ 115 116 117 Breast cancer tumor tissues typically exhibit a slightly acidic microenvironment, which provides a biological target for designing pH-sensitive nanodrug delivery systems.Aliyeh Ghamkhari developed a GO-PLA-PEG nanocarrier system, achieving efficient DOX loading through electrostatic and non-covalent interactions. This system enables rapid drug release under acidic conditions and induces apoptosis in 4T1 breast cancer cells, demonstrating promising therapeutic effects with reduced side effects [ 72 105 118 3 4 119 50 120 By modifying the GO surface with targeting ligands or aptamers, its selective uptake by breast cancer cells and therapeutic efficacy can be significantly enhanced. For example, Nizamudin Awel Hussien developed an aptamer-conjugated magnetic graphene oxide (MGO@APT) carrier that utilizes a MUC1 aptamer to recognize MCF-7 cells, achieving a high drug encapsulation efficiency of up to 95.75% and a high release rate under acidic conditions, further improving its targeted therapeutic effect [ 99 3 4 121 122 NCT07034248 −1 −1 Table 1 3.1.2. Lung Cancer Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadliest malignant tumors worldwide, often diagnosed at advanced stages with a generally poor prognosis. Although targeted therapies and immunotherapies have improved treatment outcomes to some extent, traditional drug therapies still face significant challenges, including: Widespread drug distribution throughout the body, Strong side effects and toxicity, Poor tumor targeting, And high drug resistance. Graphene-based carriers can be engineered with targeting ligands, stimuli-responsive elements, or synergistic therapeutic agents. These modifications improve drug accumulation in lung cancer tissues and support controlled-release delivery as well as multimodal therapeutic integration. Wei et al. developed hollow GO microcapsules (GOMs) using a liquid nitrogen cavitation template-free strategy for the efficient delivery of PTX [ 43 123 To further enhance the targeting specificity and stimuli-responsive release efficiency in lung cancer treatment, Liu et al. [ 124 Table 2 3.1.3. Cervical Cancer Cervical cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the female reproductive system worldwide, with particularly high incidence and mortality rates in developing countries. Although surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the primary treatment options, drug therapy still faces numerous challenges, including: Widespread drug distribution in the body, Lack of tumor specificity, High potential for drug resistance, And significant side effects on normal tissues. In recent years, synergistic systems combining multiple stimuli-responsive mechanisms and therapeutic modalities have become an important development direction for nanotherapy in cervical cancer. Li et al. [ 125 126 In addition to multi-responsive systems, surface functionalization to enhance tumor cell targeting and drug delivery efficiency is also a key research focus. Lu et al. [ 53 127 Table 3 3.1.4. Liver Cancer Liver cancer is a malignant tumor that arises from hepatic parenchymal cells. It primarily includes hepatocellular carcinoma, as well as cholangiocarcinoma and other subtypes. It is associated with chronic liver injury factors such as hepatitis B or C virus infection, long-term alcohol abuse, or metabolic syndrome. Due to its insidious progression and non-specific early symptoms, liver cancer is often diagnosed at intermediate or advanced stages, resulting in poor prognosis. It ranks as one of the most lethal cancers worldwide. Smart responsive systems that integrate external physical stimuli with endogenous tumor microenvironment characteristics are becoming an important strategy to enhance liver cancer treatment efficiency. Raquel O. Rodrigues et al. [ 128 129 130 Enhancing targeting specificity and physiological stability through chemical modification is a key strategy for enabling the biomedical application of graphene-based drug delivery systems. Pan et al. achieved this by modifying the GO surface with carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and lactobionic acid (LA), endowing the system with selective recognition capability toward liver cancer cells [ 131 132 133 Table 4 3.1.5. Other Cancers Li et al. [ 103 97 Forough Alemi et al. [ 134 135 3 4 Table 5 3.2. Treatment of Neurological Disorders 3.2.1. Alzheimer’s Disease Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and abnormal tau protein phosphorylation. It involves a complex pathogenesis and currently has limited therapeutic options.In recent years, GFNs have shown great potential in mechanistic intervention, brain-targeted therapy, and biological detection related to AD. Oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis triggered by Aβ deposition are among the key pathological mechanisms in the early stages of AD, while traditional antioxidant drugs show limited efficacy in brain tissue. To address this issue, Wang et al. developed a GO-based nanoformulation loaded with dauricine (Dau), which significantly inhibited Aβ1-42-induced oxidative damage in both in vitro and in vivo models, demonstrating strong neuroprotective effects [ 136 The difficulty of drug penetration across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle limiting the therapeutic efficacy of AD treatments. To enhance drug delivery efficiency to the brain, Fariba Mohebichamkhorami and Andrea Gabriele et al. [ 137 138 Current AD diagnostic methods, such as ELISA, face challenges like complex procedures and limited sensitivity, making them insufficient for early screening and high-throughput detection needs. To improve detection efficiency, Huang et al. [ 139 140 141 3.2.2. Parkinson’s Disease (PD) PD is characterized by the degenerative loss of central dopaminergic neurons, which severely impacts patients’ motor function. Due to the presence of the BBB, most drugs cannot effectively reach the brain, making this a major obstacle that limits therapeutic efficacy. To address this challenge, Xiong et al. [ 142 Structural damage to neural cells and insufficient regenerative capacity are also key issues in PD and other neurological disorders. To address this, Ankor González-Mayorga et al. [ 143 Table 6 3.3. Cardiovascular Diseases Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of mortality worldwide, encompassing various pathological processes such as myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, and vascular regeneration disorders. Current treatment approaches still show clear limitations in aspects such as tissue repair capacity, controlled drug release, targeting specificity, and vascular function regulation. In recent years, GFNs have demonstrated unique advantages in cardiovascular disease treatment due to their excellent electrical conductivity, mechanical strength, and surface functionalization potential. To overcome challenges such as inefficient tissue repair, poor drug targeting, and uncontrolled release, researchers have developed multifunctional therapeutic platforms using the unique properties of graphene. These systems combine capabilities including structural support, smart controlled release, and anti-inflammatory tissue repair, offering comprehensive solutions for cardiovascular therapy. In the field of tissue regeneration and myocardial repair, graphene’s mechanical strength and electrical conductivity provide an ideal foundation for constructing engineered materials. Xiong et al. [ 144 145 On the other hand, graphene platforms have also demonstrated strong capabilities in drug delivery and localized regulation. Sandeep Kumar Yadav et al. developed a GO-Gel-ATR nanosystem that enables smart controlled release of atorvastatin in atherosclerotic plaque regions (pH 6.8), enhancing drug efficacy control and plaque stability [ 146 147 148 149 NCT04390490 Table 7 3.4. Bacterial Infections and Inflammation Bacterial infections are widespread in chronic wounds, surgical implants, and immune-related complications. Especially with the rise of drug-resistant strains, traditional antimicrobial therapies face challenges such as declining efficacy and difficulty maintaining effective local drug concentrations. To enhance antibacterial efficiency and control drug release, researchers have developed multifunctional antibacterial nanoplatforms based on GFNs. These platforms have achieved notable progress in areas including infection control, sustained antibiotic release, and promotion of tissue repair. 3.4.1. Bacterial Infections In practical applications, local wound dressings often face limitations such as short drug efficacy duration, poor moisture retention, and insufficient mechanical properties, which affect treatment outcomes. To address these challenges, Negar Hosseini Darabi et al. [ 150 67 Traditional antibiotics often suffer from large fluctuations in blood drug concentration and short duration of action, limiting their effectiveness in sustained infection control. To extend drug efficacy and enhance loading capacity, Himanshu Pandey et al. [ 64 151 With repeated use and in complex infection environments, traditional antibacterial materials are prone to increased bacterial resistance and declining antibacterial activity, limiting their potential for implantable material applications. To address this, Wu et al. [ 65 3 4 71 Table 8 3.4.2. Inflammation Traditional anti-inflammatory drugs often face challenges such as poor water solubility, rapid metabolism in the body, and strong burst release effects when treating inflammation-related diseases. These factors result in short drug efficacy duration and a limited therapeutic window. To improve drug bioavailability and delivery stability, researchers have explored the use of GO-based platforms to develop novel anti-inflammatory drug delivery systems. Mohammad Saiful Islam et al. [ 70 152 In addition to traditional anti-inflammatory drugs, small-molecule antibody delivery has attracted widespread attention in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and immune modulation therapies. However, such antibodies face challenges including instability in vivo, easy degradation, and uncontrolled release. To address these issues, Ni et al. [ 153 Table 9 3.5. Diabetes Insulin is the core macromolecular drug for diabetes treatment; however, during in vivo delivery, it is highly susceptible to factors such as temperature, pH, and enzymatic degradation, leading to misfolding, aggregation, or inactivation. These issues significantly impact its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. To address this, researchers have extensively explored the potential of GFNs as insulin carriers. For example, GO offers excellent specific surface area, good surface modification capability, and environmental responsiveness. By introducing functional groups such as carboxyl, PEG, or PEI, it is possible to regulate surface charge, thereby inhibiting protein fibrillation and enhancing insulin stability and activity in vivo. To achieve smart insulin release and adaptive control within the biological environment, Florina Teodorescu et al. [ 154 2 84 Although injection remains the primary method for insulin therapy, it is highly invasive and often results in poor patient compliance. Therefore, developing oral delivery systems has become a key focus in diabetes treatment research. However, insulin is highly susceptible to inactivation in the gastrointestinal tract due to factors such as acidic conditions and enzymatic degradation. To overcome this challenge, Shabana Gul Baloch et al. developed an insulin-intercalated graphene oxide nanogel composite (In@GO NgC) via modified Hummers’ synthesis of GO, insulin intercalation, and emulsion polymerization with hydroxyethyl methacrylate/(N-iso-propylacrylamide, achieving high loading efficiency (90%), pH-dependent controlled release, and enhanced enzymatic stability in vitro [ 83 155 In terms of pharmacodynamic monitoring and feedback control, most existing delivery systems lack real-time response mechanisms, making it difficult to dynamically coordinate with blood glucose levels. To address this issue, Zhang et al. designed a GO–gold nanoparticle composite (AuNPs/GO) with optical responsiveness. This system can respond in real time to insulin concentration changes, showing potential for monitoring blood glucose regulation processes. It lays the groundwork for developing integrated “release–sensing–feedback” smart platforms [ 80 156 157 GFNs demonstrate multidimensional advantages in the delivery of macromolecular drugs such as insulin, especially in terms of maintaining drug stability, enhancing drug-loading capacity, and stimuli-responsive release—surpassing traditional carriers in these aspects. Through surface functionalization (e.g., PEG, PEI, carboxyl groups), GO can effectively prevent insulin aggregation and enzymatic inactivation, improving its in vivo activity and therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, functionalized hydrogel platforms and electrically controlled release systems enable on-demand regulation, enhancing both treatment flexibility and personalization potential. In oral delivery, GO-based nanogels, composite particles, and AuNPs–GO platforms have successfully overcome challenges related to gastrointestinal acidity and enzymatic degradation. These systems have significantly improved insulin bioavailability and release controllability, while also enabling monitoring of the glucose regulation response and the drug delivery process. However, these strategies still face critical challenges in clinical translation. The long-term biocompatibility, degradability, and immunogenicity of GFNs require systematic evaluation. Their efficacy and safety in large animal models and human trials remain largely unverified. Additionally, for oral delivery systems, whether they can maintain sustained blood drug concentrations after crossing gastrointestinal barriers still needs further optimization. We summarize in Table 10 3.6. Drug Delivery for Imaging and Diagnostic Functions Beyond its broad application in drug delivery and therapy, GFNs also demonstrate unique advantages in medical imaging. Due to their exceptional optical, electrical, and thermal properties, functionalized GFNs can serve as multimodal imaging probes for fluorescence, photoacoustic, and MRI techniques. Its strong NIR absorption capability makes it an effective contrast agent in photoacoustic imaging. Furthermore, graphene’s two-dimensional structure provides abundant surface modification sites, allowing it to be combined with various imaging functional molecules to create precise and biocompatible imaging systems. By integrating drug delivery with imaging and diagnostic functions, real-time monitoring and feedback control of the therapeutic process become achievable. For example, Li et al. anchored the GRPR-specific peptide AF750-6Ahx-Sta-BBN onto the surface of NGO via π–π stacking and hydrogen bonding, constructing a near-infrared imaging probe (NGO-BBN-AF750) targeting OSCC. In HSC-3 cell models, this system showed excellent targeted internalization and imaging performance [ 158 159 4. Preclinical Research and Clinical Translation Challenges GFNs, owing to their unique physicochemical properties, exhibit broad application prospects in biomedicine, especially in areas such as drug delivery, cancer diagnosis and therapy, and biological imaging. However, their potential biocompatibility issues and long-term in vivo safety remain key challenges restricting clinical translation. Although in vitro experiments and short-term in vivo studies suggest that surface functionalization (e.g., PEGylation, targeting molecule conjugation) can significantly improve biocompatibility, factors such as: Long-term metabolism in complex physiological environments, Types and densities of functional groups and Dosage and accumulation effects may all affect how GFNs interact with biological systems. Therefore, establishing clear long-term biosafety profiles and a standardized evaluation system is a critical prerequisite for advancing GFNs from the laboratory to clinical application. 4.1. Biocompatibility Assessment The biocompatibility of GFNs is a critical aspect that must be clearly defined for their biomedical applications. Differences in size, surface chemistry, administration route, and functionalization lead to significant variation in cytotoxicity, immune response, and metabolic distribution. A deeper understanding of how these factors influence biocompatibility is essential for guiding GFn design and safety evaluation, promoting their rational application within biological systems. The in vivo biological behavior of GFNs is highly dependent on factors such as: surface structure, oxidation level and functionalization methods. These parameters not only affect cell membrane recognition and uptake patterns but also directly determine GFNs’ ability to regulate cell fate. The surface topological structure of GFNs plays a key role in modulating cell adhesion and alignment behavior, making it a central consideration in biocompatibility evaluation and material design. Rowoon Park et al. [ 160 The oxidation degree of GO determines its hydrophilicity and bioreactivity, thereby influencing both cellular uptake pathways and toxicity mechanisms. Nivedita Chatterjee et al. [ 161 In addition to its intrinsic structure, surface functionalization modification of GO also plays an important role in regulating its biological effects. María-Concepción Matesanz et al. compared the biocompatibility performance of GO modified with different structures of PEG (linear and 6-arm PEG) in various cell types [ 162 In addition, the flexibility and conductivity of GFNs have also been utilized in designing nerve regeneration scaffolds. rGO microfiber materials, due to their electrical activity and good flexibility, have been applied in central nervous system injury models. Animal experiments show that they can guide axonal growth along the microfibers at spinal cord injury sites, constructing a biomimetic nerve repair platform, and are expected to serve as implantable tissue engineering support materials [ 143 The distribution, metabolism, and clearance pathways of GFNs in vivo are directly related to their systemic toxicity and long-term biosafety. Zhang et al., [ 163 4.2. Toxicity and Safety Carbon-based nanomaterials—such as graphene, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), fullerene (C60), and GO—hold great promise for medical applications. These include cancer therapy, imaging diagnostics, and drug delivery, owing to their unique physicochemical properties. However, related studies have also shown that carbon-based nanomaterials may induce biological adverse effects such as cytotoxicity, organ accumulation, thrombosis, and immune interference, which severely limit their clinical translation. Therefore, systematically evaluating their dosage thresholds, physiological exposure mechanisms, and controllable strategies is essential to achieving safe application. Studies have shown that the toxicity of GO exhibits clear dose dependency and varies with administration routes. Liu et al. [ 164 −1 −1 −1 −1 165 Table 11 At the cellular level, GO with different functional group modifications exhibits different toxicity. Ding et al. [ 170 171 Table 12 To reduce the toxicity of GO during in vivo use, researchers have proposed various regulatory pathways and material optimization strategies. In terms of blood system safety, Sunil K. Singh et al. developed amino-modified GO (G-NH 2 173 172 Soumen Das et al. [ 174 5. Conclusions and Outlook In recent years, research on graphene-based composites for drug delivery has expanded significantly. It now covers various aspects such as material design, surface modification, drug-loading mechanisms, and targeted therapy. This paper systematically reviews the customized application progress of graphene and its derivatives in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, cardiovascular diseases, infection and inflammation regulation, as well as diabetes. Strategies such as ligand modification, aptamer conjugation, magnetic integration, and pH-responsive design have greatly improved the drug-loading efficiency and release precision of graphene-based carriers. These approaches have also enhanced cellular targeting and therapeutic outcomes. At the same time, this paper summarizes the in vivo distribution, metabolic behavior, and potential toxicity mechanisms of graphene materials, emphasizing the critical influence of factors such as dosage, oxidation degree, functional group types, and administration routes on their biocompatibility. Although a variety of functional modification strategies for graphene have been established—such as PEGylation, peptide modification, antibody conjugation, and green reduction—which have significantly improved the material’s dispersibility, targeting ability, and biocompatibility, there are still certain limitations in customized design. On one hand, most material modifications focus on enhancing a single property, lacking integrated cross-functional construction. On the other hand, there is still no unified evaluation system for the stability and synergy of different modification methods in actual physiological environments. Future development should focus on coupling material structure, biological function, and in vivo response. This will support the creation of smart drug delivery platforms with controlled degradability, tissue-specific targeting, and multifunctional therapeutic capabilities. At the same time, systematic safety validation in large animal models and preclinical systems should be accelerated to advance the practical clinical translation of these materials in precision medicine applications.
