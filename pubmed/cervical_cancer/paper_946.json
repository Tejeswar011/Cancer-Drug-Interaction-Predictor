Nanoparticle-based treatment is one of the rapidly growing research domains in cancer treatment due to its associated structural, targeted, and stability features. The conventional (chemical and physical) nanoparticle (NP) synthesis suffers from drawbacks such as toxicity, cost, and unsustainable process methodologies, which necessitate the urgent need for sustainable green approaches to nanoparticle synthesis for envisioned cancer treatment options. The green synthesis of microalgal NPs is a promising approach for obtaining NPs for cancer treatment. As a result, this review presents the synthesis mechanism of microalgal NPs and the factors affecting their green synthesis. The mechanism of action of microalgal NPs in cancer treatment has been discussed in relation to their cytotoxic effects. The sustainability features, probable quality control regime of green-synthesized microlgal NPs, along with the prospects of incorporating synthetic biology and utilizing genetically engineered microalgae, have been highlighted in the context of cancer treatment. green synthesis microalgal nanoparicles sustainability cancer treatment future prospective The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Nanobiotechnology 1 Introduction Cancer is a vast concept that refers to a variety of disorders in which the body’s cells grow in an unrestrained manner. There are approximately 200 distinct forms of cancer, and specific cancerous cells can spread to other tissues, creating deadly metastases. Cancer is the most significant cause of mortality worldwide due to population expansion and aging. Because of this substantial degree of impact, cancer treatment has received much interest from the research community ( Cooper et al., 2023 Siegel et al., 2023 Liu and Qin, 2023 The method of monitoring and diagnosing diseases by applying nanotech for control is termed “nanomedicine” ( Ma and Shi, 2021 Kandula et al., 2023 The photosynthetic microorganisms of marine species, specifically microalgae, can be categorized as eukaryotic (green algae, diatoms) or prokaryotes (blue‒green algae), which are able to produce some of the important compounds of medical interest ( Figure 1 Al-Zahrani et al., 2021 Saadaoui et al., 2020 Ruzik, 2023 FIGURE 1 Microalgae as a source of different bioactive compounds (Created in https://BioRender.com Diagram illustrating biomass production from microalgae using sunlight and CO2. The microalgae yield biomass containing oil, proteins, carbohydrates, and residue. Byproducts are processed into PUFA, antioxidants, anti-cancer drugs, anti-microbial drugs, and vitamins. There has been an increase in research in the context of microalgal technologybecause of their rich nutritional bioactive componentsand most importantly, they are renewable, have a high growth rate, require no land, are easily cultivated and harvested, and can grow in all seasons. Some marine species are known to be beneficial health supplements. Antioxidants containing algae are indispensable in cancer therapies. Drugs used in chemotherapy eliminate cancer cells but stimulate the formation of highly reactive partially oxidized compounds called reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have harmful effects. Therefore, antioxidants are given alone or in combination with chemotherapeutics ( Ferdous and Yusof, 2021 Abd El-Hack et al., 2019 The bioactive compounds from microalgae include carotenoids, phycobilin, polyunsaturated fatty acids, polysaccharides, sterols, vitamins, enzymes, and proteins, which have multiple applications in the pharma and cosmetic sectors ( Silva et al., 2022 Ferdous et al., 2021 D. salina to have Lee et al., 2020 Foo et al., 2021 Ayna, 2020 Faraone et al., 2020 Zhuang et al., 2022 Microalgae are a potent alternative source for sustainable nanoparticle (NP) synthesis. Low metal concentrations are necessary for microalgal cellular functions such as photosynthetic electron transfer, N 2 Hamida et al., 2022 Hamida et al., 2020a Jacob et al., 2021 Hamida et al., 2020b Bin-Meferij and Hamida, 2019 Abed et al., 2022 Xue et al., 2021 Lin et al., 2021 Baby and Reji, 2022 Koushki et al., 2021 Ferdous and Nemmar, 2020 Nguyen et al., 2021 Haque et al., 2021 Hamida et al., 2020c Acharya et al., 2022 El-Naggar et al., 2018 Rana and Prajapati, 2023 Sharma et al., 2023 Sharma et al., 2022 The present review focused on the green synthesis of microalgae-based nanoparticles towards cancer treatment by emphasizing microalgae as a potential for. 2 Green synthesis of microalgae-based NPs for cancer treatment NPs are beneficial because they have a large surface area due to their small size (in Nanos), and they can easily cross the cell-tissue barrier to reach their target site. Some natural anticancer drugs, such as camptothecin, may not be used due to their poor solubility, and nanotechnology offers novel solutions to address such difficulties ( İnan et al., 2021 Sun et al., 2021 Heinemann et al., 2021 Khan et al., 2019 Several classes of nanoparticles are known, such as (a) carbon-based nanoparticles, which have applications in biomedical fields and biosensors; (b) metal-based NPs, which are used in drug and gene delivery, radiotherapy, and anticancer; (c) polymeric NPs, which are used in biosensors and have environmental and agricultural applications; (d) ceramic NPs, which are used in bone repair; (d) lipid-based NPs, which can overcome biological barriers in the case of cell transfection; and (f) semiconductor NPs, which may have diodes, solar cells, and laser technology applications. The different classes of nanoparticles are depicted in Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Different classes of nanoparticles (Created in https://BioRender.com Diagram titled \"Classes of Nanoparticles\" showing five types: metal nanoparticles, illustrated as a yellow sphere; lipid nanoparticles, depicted as a circular structure with orange and yellow layers; polymeric nanoparticles, shown as intertwined blue and red lines; semiconductor nanoparticles, displayed as a circular design with blue spokes; and carbon-based nanoparticles, represented as a blue lattice structure with a red spiral. Each type is connected to a central blue and red nanoparticle illustration. Biosynthesized nanoparticles such as microalgae-based green synthesized NPs are preferred for cancer treatment becauseof their eco-friendly synthesis without the requirement of high pressures, high temperatures, and toxic chemicals ( Khan et al., 2019 Alsammarraie et al., 2018 Kaushik et al., 2023 Katiyar and Arora, 2020 Khoo et al., 2020 Tang et al., 2020 Khanra et al., 2018 MatAron et al., 2021 Table1 TABLE 1 Microalgal-based nanoparticles and their role in cancer therapy.

These factors may affect the shape, size, and stability of nanoparticles, determining nanoparticle toxicity. 2.1.1 Temperature Chemical methods such as electrochemical and solvothermal methods are highly influenced by temperature. Physical processes require a temperature of 350 °C, whereas chemical methods require a lower temperature. A temperature of 100 °C is needed for the synthesis of microalgal NPs. At high temperatures may increase the reduction rate ( Shanmuganathan et al., 2023 2.1.2 pH pH affects the shape and size of NPs; a low pH causes the SPR peak to widen and shift toward a longer wavelength region, producing a variety of NPs (often triangular or circular, for example). In contrast, a high pH is ideal for making small NPs and promotes the formation of spherical NPs. NPs show additional stabilization in alkaline or acidic environments. Large pearl-sized NPs were produced in abundance under alkaline conditions and were far more stable than the clustered NPs made under acidic conditions ( Zhang et al., 2022 2.1.3 Reactant concentration Varying effects on the generation of NPs can be caused by different reactant concentrations in an algal extract. The impact of reducing agent concentration on the size and quantity of selenium particles produced by Chlorella vulgaris Dinc et al., 2022 2.1.4 Reaction time Reaction time is a critical factor in microalgal NPs synthesis. The same experiment can produce varied particle sizes if the reaction time is altered. The algal extract used to synthesize the NPs began to develop in 2 min and produced spherical NPs with a mean size of 12 nm after 5 min. Additionally, the progressive increase in contact duration and interaction between microalgae and silver ions (Ag + Moraes et al., 2021 2.1.5 Choice of the microalgal strain Cost-effective NPs synthesis depends not only on chemical-physical parameters but also on the chosen microalgae based on critical intrinsic properties such as biochemical pathways, growth rate, and enzyme activities; (ii) the size of the inoculum; and (iii) the selection of biocatalysts, which is essential for accelerating the rate of reaction (i.e., reduction). Whole cells and enzymes can all be employed as biocatalysts. Live whole cells are desirable because these coenzymes are expensive and may be recycled along the route, demonstrating their enormous efficacy ( Moraes et al., 2021 2.1.6 Capping agent The stability of NPS should be improved to prevent aggregation and oxidation, particularly by utilizing organic protective ligands whose head group binds to metal NP surfaces with high affinity to stabilize highly reactive surface atoms. The alkyl spacer between the head and tail groups of the ligand is thought to act as a capping shell and regulate the interparticle spacing. Furthermore, the surface reactivity and solubility of NPs are greatly influenced by the functional tail groups of the ligand. Importantly, it was discovered that the kind of ligand (such as disulfide, ammonium, thiol, or citrate) and the level of ligand capping, along with the synthetic conditions used, could systematically change the size, shape, and ligand-to-metal ratio of the NPs and directly affect their chemical and physical (such as electronic and optical) properties ( San and Shon, 2018 3 Synthesis mechanism of microalgal NPs Microalgae are used to prepare metallic nanoparticles that have applications in anticancer therapy. Phytochemicals in microalgae contain functional groups such as carboxyl, amino, and hydroxyl groups, which assist in reducing metals and serve as capping agents (providing coatings on nanoparticles). Nanoparticles of silver, cadmium, gold, lead, and silicon-germanium can be prepared using marine species ( Restrepo and Villa, 2021 Figure 3 Restrepo and Villa, 2021 FIGURE 3 Extracellular and Intracellular synthesis mechanisms of microalgal NPs (Modified and adapted from ( Chan et al., 2022 https://BioRender.com Diagram illustrating synthesis mechanisms of microalgal nanoparticles (NPs) through extracellular and intracellular processes. Extracellular synthesis involves reduction by external components, with Ag⁺ and Au³⁺ converting to silver and gold nanoparticles. Intracellular synthesis involves reduction by internal components within outer and inner membranes, also resulting in metal NPs. Both processes start with algal biomass and a metallic solution leading to final metal nanoparticles. The bioreduction process includes activation, growth, and termination. For instance, (a) during activation, metal ions are reduced, and reduced metal ions undergo nucleation; (b) during the growth phase, small nanoparticles aggregate into large particles marked with thermodynamic stability; and (c) termination is marked by biomineralization (inorganic (metal)-organic (microalgal assisted) composite) and nanoparticle stabilization ( Figure 4 Tetraselmisko chinens Sargassum muticum Chan et al., 2022 viz. Singh et al., 2019 FIGURE 4 Schematic representation of microalgal NPs synthesis (Modified and adapted from ( Chan et al., 2022 https://BioRender.com Flowchart depicting the synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles. Algal biomass and metallic solution undergo reduction to form nanoparticles, indicated by chemical equations. The process includes centrifugation, drying, and a color change. Characterization involves powder form stabilization, UV-visible spectroscopy, particle size analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, SEM, and TEM. The stabilization results in either monodispersed or aggregated nanoparticles. Among different microalgae, the selection of microalgal species depends on the gamet of packed biomolecules posses by particular algal species, which dictates the metal ion stabilization towards NPs synthesis, and also on the type of expected metallic NPs with intended application domain. The selection of microalgae for NPs synthesis includes a systematic process of identifying the required metallic NPs for targeted application, with concrete proof of microalgal species for synthesizing particular metallic NPs. Once the type of NPs and microalgal species are identified, growth kinetics and particular metal uptake by selected microalgal species are determined, which follows the optimization of NPs synthesis reaction conditions (temperature, pH, and reaction time) towards better size, shape, and functionality. Finally, the synthesized microalgal NPs have to be characterized to determine the different structural and chemical properties for better suitability for targeted biomedical applications ( Arteaga-Castrejón et al., 2024 4 Characterization of the synthesized microalgal NPs Characterization of the NPs was carried out to determine the microscopic structure and material properties through microscopy-, spectroscopy- and X-ray-based techniques ( Figure 5 Table 2 FIGURE 5 Microscopy- and spectroscopy-based characterization techniques for Microalgal NPs (SEM: Scanning Electron Microscopy, TEM: Transmission ElectroscopyMicroscopy,AFM:Atomic Force Microscope, FTIS: Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) (Created in https://BioRender.com Diagram of microalgal nanoparticle characterization techniques categorized into microscopy-based and spectroscopy-based methods. Microscopy-based techniques include SEM, TEM, and AFM. Spectroscopy-based methods include FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, and X-ray spectroscopy. Each technique is visually represented with corresponding equipment illustrations. TABLE 2 Different characterization techniques of NPs and their features.

(2017) X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) The no. of electrons escaped from the surface of material and kinetic energy measurements gives the XPS spectra Determination of surface functional state and elemental composition of NPs Powdered samples are pressed into indium foil, power is dissolved in solvent and cast onto silicon wafer and sprinkled onto sticky carbon conductive tape for analysis It doesn’t damage the samples and provide depth information It requires solid dry form of samples and data interpretation is little difficult  Singh et al. (2019) One of the advanced nanoparticle characterization techniques is nanoSIMS, which uses isotope labeling to analyze and study a complete biological system. It can distinguish between isotopes and combines fine spatial resolution with high atomic sensitivity. The zeta potential, also called the electrokinetic potential, is used to measure the electric charge on the nanoparticle surface. The zeta potential of the particles indicates nanoparticle stability ( Fernandes et al., 2023 Mourdikoudis et al., 2018 5 Microalgal NPs in cancer treatment Microalgae are reservoirs of bioactive compounds such as sterols, polysaccharides, fatty acids, phycobiliproteins, phenolics, and vitamins that play major roles in preventing or curing cancer.

(2018) 5.1 Mechanism of action of microalgal NPs in cancer treatment There are four major ways by which microalgae affect cancer cells. (1) Microalgae are known to decrease the binding capacity for tubulin polymerization, which inhibits the synthesis of microtubules (e.g., Cucarin A). (2) They alter the expression of COX-2, MMP-9, MMP-2, and ERK-2 (e.g., astaxanthin), which decreases invasion capacity. (3) They decrease VEGF, i.e., vascular endothelial growth factor (e.g., fucoidan), which results in antiangiogenic activity. (4) Increased fas, ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecule) and decreased bcl2 (e.g., C-phycocyanin), which cause the activation of caspase 2 3 4 6 8 9 10. Microalgae directly affect cancer in five ways. (1) PUFAs from microalgae, such as DHA, cause DNA fragmentation; (2) PUFAs, such as DHA, decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential. (3) PUFAs such as astaxanthin and DHA activate ERK, increasing p27. (4) Astaxanthin modulates NF-κB. (5) DHA increases cytochrome C, p53, and bax levels, leading to cell cycle arrest and an antiproliferative effect. All the above-mentioned factors lead to the apoptosis of cancer cells.The mechanism of action of microalgal AgNPs in cancer treatment is summarized in Figure 6 Hamida et al., 2022 FIGURE 6 Mechanism of action of AgNPs in cancer treatment (Modified and adapted from ( Hamida et al., 2022 https://BioRender.com Diagram illustrating the effects of silver nanoparticles on a cell. Silver nanoparticles cause cell membrane disruption, inhibiting the electron transfer chain. This leads to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and DNA damage. Protein damage occurs due to ribosome destabilization. These processes contribute to cell death. 5.2 Cell line studies and toxicity studies associated with the microagal NPs The cell toxicity, genotoxicity, and immunotoxicity of NPs have been studied. As proven by many studies, these compounds are toxic to biological systems. The toxicity depends on the structure, size, and material from which the nanoparticle is made. To date, evidence has confirmed that biologically synthesized NPs, especially microalgal NPs, are less toxic to normal cells. Gold nanoparticles synthesized by using the microalga D. salina Singh et al., 2019 T. erythraeum Sathishkumar et al., 2019 U. rigida Algotiml et al., 2022 Hamida et al., 2022 6 Technical challenges in green synthesis of microalgal NPs The green synthesis of microalgal NPs process starts with the culture of microalgal cells and harvesting. Batch and Fed-batchor continuous cultivation modes are the most common techniques. Biomass is collected and processed during the cultivation phase. The cost of biomass harvesting is estimated to be nearly 30% of the price of microalgal downstream processes. As a result, the high cost of harvesting is one of the most significant bottlenecks in commercializing microalgal processes. Due to the density of microalgal cells during growth, the medium is often low, and most microalgal cells have a negative charge, which causes them to be suspended; moreover, the microalgal harvesting procedure is costly and energy-intensive ( Jacob et al., 2021 Halder and Azad, 2019 The application of NPs in biomedical applications is the most vulnerable circumstance. The interaction between nanotoxicity and its biomolecules has been the subject of various studies. Nonetheless, assessing and validating nanotoxicity in a living system is complex. The assessment of toxicity and the challenges in identifying the influence on living systems are historic. Researchers face challenges when evaluating nanomaterials in solution-based, powder form and dealing with biological systems using various methodologies for toxicity evaluation. Evaluation tools and characterization procedures are critical for overcoming these hurdles, whereas cytotoxic assays consider nanoparticle shape, size, and morphology ( Gupta et al., 2019 7 Trends, scope and sustainability aspects of green synthesis of microalgal NPs Since the discovery of nanoparticles, physical and chemical production methods have been prominent. In 2009, a wave led to both increases in nanoparticle synthesis and the adoption of biological synthesis methods. There has been an increase in the green synthesis of NPs owing to their sustainability and advantages. By emphasizing the green synthesis of NPs by microalgae, numerous microalgae have been explored for their ability to produce nanoparticles ( Bao and Lan, 2019 Despite their production, what remains unexplored is the application part of synthesized NPs. Research has yet to be carried out to determine their specific role in diagnostics, specifically in diagnosis of cancer.

In the context of the environment, sustainability involves making efficient use of resources and keeping them for use by future generations. Microalgae grow with the aid of sunlight, carbon dioxide and inorganic nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate. Utilization of atmospheric CO 2 Chan et al., 2022 Chan et al., 2022 Mondal et al., 2023 2 Mondal et al., 2023 8 Quality control aspects of green synthesized microalgal NPs NP use is divided into two primary categories: pharmaceutical and medical. The components and procedures utilized in drug production are subject to quality control. It is crucial to accurately assess formulation excipients and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for optimizing and evaluating preformulations. To guarantee the safety and efficacy of medications throughout the regulatory timeframe, they must be of sufficient strength, purity, quality, and potency. Many nanostructure systems, such as liposomes, nanoemulsions, dendrimers, nanocrystals, and metal oxides (zinc oxide, superparamagnetic iron oxide, titanium dioxide), have been approved by the FDA. The European Medical Agency and European Commission designated doxorubicin polyisohexylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles for treating hepatocellular carcinoma as orphan drugs and awarded this classification to the Bio Alliance in October 2004. The first nanodrug to receive FDA approval was Doxil in 1995. Dosage forms contain pegylated liposomes that carry the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. An injectable amphotericin liposome is known as an AmBisome ® Taghizadeh et al., 2021 There are several requirements for using nanoparticles as drugs, such as size (primary particle size, volume, and surface area), agglomeration state, distribution in two or three dimensions, chemical composition (element identification and distribution, crystal shape, and particle size distribution), and surface composition (charge on the surface). These requirements are crucial for nanoparticles used in biomedical applications. However, specifics of nanoparticle size in bulk materials and intended pharmaceutical items are critical to comprehending a drug’s pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic characteristics. There is a clear association between the engineering of nanoparticles, including manufacturing, and their impact on cell surface composition, morphology (size and shape), surface composition, and aggregation. Consequently, for employing green synthesized microalgal NPs for medical usage, more research is needed to ensure that these NPs can pass quality-control examinations. Additionally, essential quality characteristics, including solubility, stability, and solid-state qualities, should be considered when evaluating the suitability of green synthesized microalgal NPs for various pharmaceutical and medicinal applications ( Taghizadeh et al., 2021 9 Future perspectives To date, only a few nanoparticles of gold and silver have been synthesized using microalgae through green synthesis. The green synthesis of zinc oxide, copper, selenium, titanium, and iron NPs of microalgae and its role in cancer treatment need to be explored. Additionally, numerous microalgae have a high potential for nanoparticle synthesis that remains unexplored. Therefore, microalgal NPs synthesis is a trending field that requires intense research for medicinal applications, especially for cancer treatment. The microalgal NPs synthesis towards cancer treatment may benefit from further research on the contribution of synthetic biology and genetic engineering approaches. Synthetic biology intrusion enables precise genetic modifications through CRISPR/Cas9 technologies to manipulate the metabolic pathways, which help in the efficient conversion of metal ions into NPs with desired sizes and properties, which eventually help in the cost-effectiveness of the process, which suits the needs of the biomedical industry. The research domain also needs to explore the possibilities of utilizing genetically engineered microalgae for NPs synthesis for cancer treatment towards enhanced efficiencies with tailored NPs producing traits in a sustainable production manner ( Zhang and Fussenegger, 2024 10 Conclusion The review discussed the role of microalgal NPs as therapeutic agents for treating cancer cells through a sustainable, green synthesis approach. Furthermore, the probable mechanism of microalgal NP’s synthesis, its characterization approaches, and technical challenges associated with the process have been discussed. Moreover, the extended application of green-synthesized microalgal NPs to cancer cells was addressed through the mechanism of action on cancer cells and cytotoxicity studies. Finally, the quality control aspects and prospects of green-synthesized microalgal NPs are summarized. This review provides a concise overview of the green synthesis of microalgal NPs for potential cancer treatment.
