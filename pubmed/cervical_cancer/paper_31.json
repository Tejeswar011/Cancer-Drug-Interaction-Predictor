Targeting ROS and iron could possibly reduce NETs formation and mitigate stroke. NETs were predominantly initiated by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in endothelial cells (ECs), rather than in neutrophils. Silencing Fpn1 in ECs significantly reduced extracellular iron, suppressed ROS production, and inhibited NETs formation—effects that were reversed by supplementation with iron or hemin. Additionally, both vitamin C (Vc) and deferoxamine (DFOM) suppressed blood coagulation on Fpn1‐silenced ECs under H/R conditions. NETs formation on hypoxic ECs was further enhanced in the presence of co‐cultured red blood cells. In a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion, combined treatment with Vc and DFOM synergistically reduced infarct size. Although Vc or DFOM alone reduced NETs formation, their combined use showed a weaker effect than DFOM alone, possibly because better blood flow increased neutrophil contact with the endothelium. In conclusion, endothelial ROS and iron play critical roles in regulating NETs formation during CI/R injury. Combined treatment with Vc and DFOM offers a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce stroke‐induced damage by modulating ROS levels and NETs formation. Under hypoxic conditions, iron from red blood cells and injured tissues is taken up by endothelial cells. During reoxygenation, this iron is exported via Fpn1, promoting NETs formation by enhancing ROS production through the Fenton reaction, ultimately exacerbating cerebral injury. Reducing ROS with vitamin C and chelating iron with deferoxamine effectively suppresses NETs formation and mitigates cerebral damage in stroke. ascorbic acid endothelial cell extracellular trap Fe 2+ MCAO ROS The mechanism of human neural progenitor exosome miR‐423‐5p regulates oxidative stress in endothelial cells against cerebral ischemia LZ20H090002 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date December 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:04.10.2025  Fan Weijian Zebin Fang Yuxiang Weng 2025 Iron Enhances Reactive Oxygen Species Generation and Initiates Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Formation on the Endothelium to Exacerbate Stroke Journal of Cell Communication and Signaling e70050 10.1002/ccs3.70050 Weijian Fan, Zebin Fang and Yuxiang Weng contributed equally to this work. 1 INTRODUCTION Stroke, caused by a lack of blood supply or loss of vascular integrity in the brain, has become the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide in recent years.  1  2  3  4 Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) has emerged as a key contributor to neuronal injury following stroke. Neutrophils infiltrate the injured brain, where they become activated and release NETs, which subsequently damage the blood–brain barrier (BBB), inhibit neovascularization, induce neurological deficits, and exacerbate stroke prognosis.  5  6  7  8  5 Timely restoration of blood flow remains the primary therapeutic goal in stroke management.  9  10  11  12  13  14  15 The central nervous system primarily contains resident immune cells such as microglia in the brain parenchyma, and fewer CNS‐associated macrophages at brain‐vascular interfaces.  16  17  18  19 2 2  20  21 ROS can be generated through multiple pathways, including NADPH oxidase (NOX), mitochondria, and the Fenton reaction. NOX has been identified as a major contributor to ROS production in ECs under hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) conditions.  22  23 Based on these considerations, we hypothesized that endothelial ROS, regulated by iron availability, is a key driver of NETs formation during CI/R. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the role of iron and ROS with vitamin C (Vc) and deferoxamine mesylate (DFOM) intervention in NETs formation on ECs under H/R conditions, and evaluated the therapeutic effects of Vc and DFOM in a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R). 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Cell culture and transfection Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVEC, FH1122, Fuheng Bio), human myeloid cell line (HL‐60, FH0101, Fuheng Bio), mouse brain angioendothelioma cells (bEnd.3, CL‐0598, Procell), and mouse aortic ECs (MAECs; FH0499, Fuheng Bio) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, GNM12800‐5, Genomcell) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; 10100147, Gibco) and 1% penicillin‐streptomycin (GNM15140‐1, Genomcell). Cells that reached 90% confluence were passaged, or stored in frozen FBS. All cell were used in passages 6–10. For treatments, the seeded cells were incubated in 2% FBS when they reached about 80% confluence. Fpn1 was silenced in mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) using shRNA delivered via adeno‐associated virus (AAV) vectors (GenePharma). For transfection, 50 multiplicities of infection AAV were added to each well of a 6‐well plate in 8 μg/mL polybrene (SX50113, Shawnxin Bio) and incubated in serum‐free OPTI‐MEM medium (#31985070, Gibco) for 6 h. Cells were then cultured in complete medium for 48 h. Transfected cells were selected using 2 μg/mL puromycin (60209ES10, Yeason). Successful transfection was confirmed by assessing Fpn1 mRNA and protein levels. AAV‐packaged scrambled shRNA (sh‐NC) was used as a negative control. 2.2 Neutrophil isolation and NETs induction Murine neutrophils were isolated from the femur and tibia bone marrow using the Neutrophil Isolation Kit (#130‐097‐658, Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated neutrophils were suspended in DMEM containing 2% FBS. The workflow for induction of NETs were illustrated in Figure 1A  24 2 2 2 5  25 7 4 FIGURE 1 NETs are induced on ECs under H/R, dependent on ROS and iron.

Cells were incubated for 40 min before observation under a fluorescence microscope. Total iron (Fe 2+ 3+ Clotting time was measured by adding fresh whole blood (200 μL) to a 96‐well plate pre‐cultured with MAECs or their homogenates. Clotting was monitored every 60 s by gently tilting the plate. 2.4 Real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) Total RNA was extracted from treated MAECs using the RNeasy Kit (DP419, Tiangen Biotech) and reverse‐transcribed with oligo‐dT primers and PrimeScript II RTase (#RR055A, Takara). Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted using SYBR Green Super Mix (#1725121, Bio‐Rad). The following primer pairs were used: Fpn1 (forward, 5′‐CTCCA ACCCG CTCCC ATAAG‐3′; reverse, 5′‐TCATG ACACC AGGCG TTCTC‐3′) GAPDH (forward, 5′‐TGGTG AAGCA GGCAT CTGAG‐3′; reverse, 5′‐TGAAG TCGCA GGAGA CAACC‐3′). Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt 2.5 Western blotting Proteins were extracted from MAECs using radio immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (P0013B; Beyotime) on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 4°C for 15 min, and protein concentration was determined via bicinchoninic acid assay. Equal amounts (20 μg) of protein were separated by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate‐polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in tris buffered saline with tween 20 for 30 min and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies: Anti‐VE Cadherin antibody (1:1000, ab282277, Abcam) and β‐actin Ab (1:5000, AB0011, Abways). After washing, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies goat anti‐rat IgG (1:5000, ab205720, Abcam) or goat anti‐mouse IgG (1:10,000, AB0102, Abways). Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (MA0186, MeilunBio). 2.6 Animal experiments All animal experiments complied with GB/T 35823‐2018 and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University (approval number: 2017SDKS092, approval date: February 15, 2017). Male C57BL/6J mice (6–8 weeks old; SIPPR‐BK) were challenged with CI/R, and randomly assigned to four groups: CI/R, Vc, DFOM, and Vc + DFOM ( n CI/R was induced by MCAO/R after 12 h fasting. Cerebral blood flow was monitored to confirm both occlusion and reperfusion with a laser Doppler probe attached above the skull. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and the right common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), and external carotid artery (ECA) were exposed. The ECA and CCA were ligated, and the ICA was clamped. A “V”‐shaped incision was made in the CCA, and a suture plug was inserted ∼18–20 mm to occlude the middle cerebral artery. After 2 h of ischemia, mice received intraperitoneal injections of Ascorbic acid (200 mg/kg) or DFOM mesylate (100 mg/kg). Both drugs were administered in 200 μL volume in saline, 10 min before reoxygenation. The CI/R model group were given 200 μL saline. Reperfusion was initiated by removing the suture, by which chronic hypoperfusion rather than full reperfusion was achieved. After 24 h, mice were euthanized using CO 2 2.7 Tissue staining For TTC staining, the mice brains were rinsed in cold phosphate buffered saline and frozen at −20°C for 10 min. Coronal sections (2 mm thick, five slices per brain) were prepared and incubated with 2% TTC Staining Solution (C0652, Beyotime) for 10 min, and fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min after washed out thrice. The sections were photographed with a camera, and stored at −80°C. The infarct volume was analyzed with ImageJ and calculated by the sum of the infarct area multiplied by 2 mm of each slice. For immunofluorescence staining, the PFA‐fixed brain tissues were paraffin‐embedded and sectioned at 16 μm. After rehydration, sections were blocked in 1% BSA/5% goat serum, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with primary antibodies against CitH3 and CD31 (antibody details not provided). Secondary antibodies included Alexa Fluor 488‐conjugated goat anti‐mouse IgG (#A28175, Invitrogen). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (#C1002, Beyotime). Stained sections were imaged using a Nikon Ni‐U microscope. 2.8 Transcriptome analysis Transcriptome sequencing was performed by Novogene Co. Ltd. on brain tissues from three mice per group, following their standard protocols. For bioinformatics analysis, reads containing adapters, poly‐N sequences, and low‐quality reads were removed from the raw data. All downstream analyses were conducted using the resulting clean data. As gene expression profiles were relatively similar across groups, all differentially expressed genes (DEGs, p S1 S1 S1 2.9 Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.

Upon PMA stimulation for 4 h, NETs levels were reduced under hypoxia compared to the normoxic control but were significantly increased after reoxygenation. This reoxygenation‐induced NETs formation was attenuated by EDTA, DFOM, and Vc treatment (Figure 1B 1C 1D,E 3.2 NETs formation is regulated by extracellular iron and ROS To determine the contribution of intracellular iron to NETs formation, Fpn1 was silenced to inhibit iron efflux.

In hypoxic sh‐NC‐transfected MAECs, reoxygenation in the presence of whole blood led to rapid coagulation within approximately 1 min, which was delayed by Vc or DFOM treatment (Figure 4A 4B,C 4D,E FIGURE 4 RBCs enhance ROS generation and NETs formation under H/R.

Three mice died of CI/R modeling, and 6 died of the failed attempts to achieve intra‐arterial drug delivery. TTC staining showed that the average infarct volume of the CI/R group was 57.87%. Treatment with either Vc or DFOM alone had limited impact on reducing infarct volume (49.54% and 54.01%, respectively), whereas their combined use led to a significant reduction of 25.70% (Figure 5A,B 5C 5D,E 5F,G FIGURE 5 Protective effects of DFOM and Vc in MCAO/R mice via inhibition of NETs formation.

Among immune cells, neutrophils are the first to be recruited to the site of ischemic injury. These infiltrating cells aggravate brain damage by producing ROS, proteases, and lipocalin‐2, as well as by forming NETs.  27  28  27  29  30 Neutrophils become activated in response to damage‐associated molecular patterns and are recruited to inflamed tissues by rolling and adhering to the endothelium, followed by transmigration.  31  32  25  33  27  34  35  31  34  13  36  37 Ischemic stroke is driven by intravascular coagulation within cerebral vessels. NETs can interactively promote platelet activation and coagulation, thereby exacerbating stroke, enhancing atherosclerosis and inflammation, and contributing to resistance against rt‐PA thrombolysis.  28  38  39  40  41  42 Both Vc and DFOM have been previously reported to mitigate CI/R injury and reduce NETs formation. For instance, systemic administration of Vc improved infarct volume, BBB integrity, and neuronal survival in MCAO rats, correlating with reduced ROS/reactive nitrogen species and inflammation.  43  44  36  45  46  47  48  49 This study confirms the therapeutic potential of targeting ROS to suppress NETs formation and mitigate CI/R injury, both through direct ROS scavenging by antioxidants (Vc) and by preventing ROS generation via the Fenton reaction using iron chelators (DFOM). However, certain limitations should be acknowledged. The H/R model used in cultured ECs may not fully replicate the complex in vivo interactions among ECs, iron, ROS, and neutrophils during stroke. For MCAO model, chronic hypoperfusion rather than full reperfusion was achieved with filament withdrawal. This may well reflect the stroke situation while plenty of ECs were still under hypoxia, which is impossibe for drug delivery, ROS accumulation and NETs formation. Consequently, the NETs forming ability can be underestimated especially in the model group. High intra‐group variability observed in several assays suggests that more refined methodologies or tighter experimental controls are needed to further substantiate these findings. Co‐treatment with Vc and DFOM markedly improved neuronal infarction, but failed to enhance the suppression of NETs formation in vivo. This suggests that their enhanced effects can be dependent on mechanisms beyond ROS and NETs that needs to be fully elucidated. 5 CONCLUSION NETs formation on the endothelium under H/R is dependent on both ROS and extracellular iron. Combined administration of Vc and DFOM synergistically alleviated brain injury in MCAO mice, at least in part by reducing iron and ROS levels and inhibiting NETs formation. Given that DFOM and Vc are clinically available agents, and their repurposing in stroke treatment warrants further preclinical studies, especially with refined H/R models and longer‐term outcome evaluation.
