A further aim was to identify prognostic factors influencing overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) in these patients, with a particular focus on toxicity and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Methods This retrospective, single-center study included 31 patients with FIGO stage IVA cervical cancer treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy between 2010 and 2020. All 31 patients underwent external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT), with concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy (CTX) administered in 25 cases and additional high-dose-rate brachytherapy (BT) performed in 24 cases. Treatment-related adverse events were categorized in accordance with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; version 5.0) [ 1 Results Median OS was estimated at 51.7 months, with 2‑ and 5‑year OS rates of 58.1 and 46.2%, respectively. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 48.1 months (95% CI: 0–96.2 months), with 2‑ and 5‑year PFS rates of 52 and 37%. The 10-year LC probability was 70.4%, showing a significant association with improved OS ( p p Conclusion Advanced radiotherapy, particularly IGABT, achieves durable LC in patients with FIGO stage IVA cervical cancer, supporting its use as a cornerstone of curative-intent treatment. However, systemic progression remains a major challenge, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies, including immunotherapy and liquid biopsy for treatment monitoring. Future prospective trials are essential to validate these findings and refine therapeutic protocols, particularly for high-risk subgroups. Ensuring equitable access to these advanced treatments is critical for improving global outcomes in cervical cancer care.

However, advancements in radiation oncology have shifted this perspective, enabling the pursuit of curative strategies in selected cases. The current standard of care for such complex scenarios combines intensity-modulated external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT), concurrent platinum-based CT, and image-guided adaptive brachytherapy (IGABT). This multimodal approach facilitates precise dose escalation to the tumor while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissues, thereby improving both therapeutic outcomes and patient quality of life [ 3 4 The objective is to evaluate the efficacy of an intensified multimodal treatment concept, with a particular focus on local control and long-term survival in this specific patient group. By means of a detailed statistical analysis, we seek to identify factors that predict treatment success and provide guidance for future therapeutic decisions in cases involving bladder or rectal infiltration. Modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based treatment planning allows precise target definition and adaptation to tumor changes during therapy. These technical improvements provide treatment options for patients who previously had limited therapeutic choices and may evade deterioration in quality of life (QoL). Despite these advances, there is still a lack of standardized treatment protocols for patients with organ infiltration, and recommendations of evidence-based guidelines remain limited. Materials and methods Study design and participants This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ludwig Maximilian University Munich (approval number: 21-0603), and all participants provided written consent for the use of their clinical data in this research. In this monocentric retrospective study, we evaluated all patients with FIGO stage IVA cervical cancer consecutively treated with chemoradiotherapy at our institution between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020. The follow-up period extended to December 31, 2023. All patients had biopsy-proven cervical cancer and evidence of bladder or rectal involvement. They were treated with a three-pronged approach comprising EBRT, concurrent cisplatin-based chemotherapy, and high-dose rate brachytherapy (BT). The evaluation of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) assessing quality of life was conducted using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life of Cancer Patients Questionnaire version 3.0 ([ 5 1 6 Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were employed to summarize patient characteristics and treatment parameters, including measures of central tendency (mean, median) and variability (range). Frequency distributions were expressed as absolute numbers ( n Results Baseline characteristics A total of 31 patients with FIGO stage IVA cervical cancer, all presenting with adjacent organ infiltration, were included in the analysis and treated with curative-intent chemoradiotherapy. Among them, 25 patients (80.6%) had bladder infiltration, including 11 patients (35.5%) with isolated bladder involvement. Rectal infiltration was observed in 20 patients (64.5%), of whom 6 patients (19.4%) had isolated rectal involvement. Notably, 14 patients (45.2%) exhibited infiltration of both bladder and rectum. The median age of the cohort was 52 years (range 20–79 years). A total of 93.5% of patients had squamous cell carcinoma, with two patients exhibiting adenocarcinoma. Regarding regional nodal status, 10 patients (32.3%) had no evidence of nodal involvement, whereas 21 patients (67.7%) were found to have tumor-positive lymph nodes.

The clinical target volume (CTV) was delineated in accordance with established guidelines using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based treatment planning [ 7 Percutaneous radiotherapy External-beam radiotherapy was administered to all 31 patients, with 23 (74.2%) receiving a total dose of 50.4 Gy (range 45–70.4 Gy). A boost dose was administered to tumor-involved pelvic lymph nodes in 13 patients (41.9%), with a median boost of 59.4 Gy (range 59.4–70 Gy). The majority of patients (83.9%) received a single dose of 1.8 Gy, while 5 patients (16.1%) received a reduced single dose of 1.6 Gy in order to mitigate the risks associated with advanced infiltration and fistula complications. Extended-field radiotherapy to the paraaortic lymph nodes was performed in 9 patients (29%) with paraaortic involvement. The median duration of EBRT was 6.1 weeks (range 5.1–10.3 weeks), with longer periods observed in cases where the dose was escalated to 70.4 Gy. Interstitial brachytherapy Of the 31 patients, 24 (77.4%) received interstitial BT in addition to EBRT. Brachytherapy was performed under general anesthesia with prophylactic antibiotics, in accordance with established techniques [ 8 9 Concurrent chemotherapy Concurrent chemotherapy (CTX) was administered to 25 patients (80.6%), with cisplatin as the standard regimen in 18 cases (58.1%), typically at 40 mg/m 2 2 Table 2 Treatment details Modality n % Gy Weeks Range EBRT n = 31 Median total dose 31 100 50.4 – 45.0–70.4 Median duration of EBRT – – – 6.1 5.1–10.3 Median single dose 26 83.9 1.8 – 1.6–1.8 Pelvic boost 13 41.9 59.4 – 59.4–70 Median CTV volume pelvic (ccm) 773 – – – 300–1611 Extended-field paraaortic 9 29.0 50.4 – – Median CTV volume paraaortic (ccm) 272 – – – 122–390 BT n = 24 Median total dose – – 20 – 15–30 Median single dose – – 4 – 4–5 Median fractionation 4 – – – 3–6 Median dose coverage % – 98.1 – – 85.1–99.9 Median CTV volume (ccm) 149 – – – 52–260 CTX n = 25 Cisplatin 18 72 – 5 5–6 Mitomycin C 2 8 – – – EBRT CTV BT CTX ccm Gy Diagnostic and therapeutic interventions Of the total patient collective, 17 (54.8%) underwent diagnostic or therapeutic interventions prior to commencing chemoradiotherapy. The primary objectives of these procedures were disease staging and treatment preparation. Of these procedures, the most prevalent was pelvic or paraaortic lymphadenectomy (LNE), which was performed in 15 patients for the purpose of staging. In the remaining cases, nodal status was assessed using imaging modalities such as positron-emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) or MRI. Adnexectomy was performed in 12 patients, while 5 patients underwent uterine curettage. One patient underwent ovarian transposition to safeguard ovarian function from radiation effects, while cervical conization was also included in one diagnostic workup. Finally, the remaining 14 patients (45.2%) did not undergo any invasive procedures prior to treatment. Treatment outcomes Overall survival (OS) Survival analysis of the 31-patient cohort revealed a temporal pattern of declining survival probabilities, from 94.0% at 4.3 months to 46.2% at 5 years after treatment. The cohort reached median survival at 51.7 months, with survival rates of 62.2 and 53.3% at 2 and 3 years, respectively. Tumor-related mortality occurred in 14 patients (45.2%), exclusively within the first 51.7 months of follow-up, while 17 patients (54.8%) remained alive or were lost to follow-up. The substantial proportion of censored cases necessitates careful interpretation of the median survival estimate. The temporal evolution of overall survival is illustrated in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Kaplan–Meier curve showing overall survival of the entire cohort Progression-free survival (PFS) The median PFS was 48.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0–96.2 months). The 2‑ and 5‑year PFS probabilities were 52 and 37%, respectively. By the end of the observation period, 16 events (progression or death) had occurred, while 15 patients (48.4%) were censored (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Progression-free survival rate Local control and patterns of disease recurrence In our cohort, 22 out of 29 evaluable patients (75.9%) achieved local tumor control following chemoradiotherapy, with 14 patients (63.6%) achieving complete remission and 4 patients (18.2%) maintaining stable pelvic disease. Kaplan–Meier analysis yielded local control probabilities at 2, 5, and 10 years of 70.4% (Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Local control rate Prognostic factors Achievement of local control emerged as a significant predictor of overall survival ( p n n 4 Fig. 4 Overall survival (OS) based on key prognostic factors is illustrated in a–d: OS by local control ( a b c d Stratification of survival outcomes by age (< 50 versus ≥ 50 years) revealed distinct survival patterns, albeit not reaching statistical significance ( p n n 4 Initial lymph node status was evaluated as a prognostic factor.

Median time to local recurrence was not reached in either group, and no statistically significant difference in local control was observed between the groups ( p 5 Treatment-related toxicity Of the 31 patients, 27 reported toxicities, with 83.95% of all recorded toxicity grades being grade 1 or 2. The most common symptoms included gastrointestinal issues (44.4%) and urogenital problems such as non-infectious cystitis (51.6%). Severe toxicities (grade 3–4) were infrequent, affecting only a small subset of patients, and primarily included anemia (19.4%) and fistula deterioration (16.1%). Among the 5 patients who developed post-therapeutic fistulas, two had received 1.6 Gy per fraction during EBRT, and 3 had received 1.8 Gy per fraction. Notably, all fistulas occurred after the completion of EBRT. Late toxicities were reported in 45.2% of patients, with most being mild to moderate (grade 1–2). The most common grade 1–2 late effects included proctitis or colitis (16.1%), pelvic insufficiency fractures (9.7%), and vaginal dryness (9.7%). Severe late toxicities (grade 3) were rare, affecting isolated cases. A detailed breakdown of toxicities by grade and symptom type is provided in Table 3 Table 3 Post-treatment adverse events, categorized according to CTCAE version 5.0 [ 1 Grade 0, % ( n 1, % ( n 2, % ( n 3, % ( n 4, % ( n Acute toxicity Non-infectious cystitis 48.4 (15) 41.9 (13) 9.7 (3) – – Diarrhea 61.3 (19) 22.6 (7) 12.9 (4) 3.2 (1) – Nausea 71 (22) 22.6 (7) 6.5 (2) – – Erythema 71 (22) 22.6 (7) 3.2 (1) 3.2 (1) – Fatigue 93.5 (29) 3.2 (1) 3.2 (1) – – Leukopenia 87 (27) 3.2 (1) 9.7 (3) – – Anemia 58.1 (18) 16.1 (5) 6.5 (2) 19.4 (6) – Thrombocytopenia 93.5 (29) 3.2 (1) 3.2 (1) – – Creatinine 90.3 (28) 9.7 (3) – – – Pain 87 (27) 9.7 (3) 3.2 (1) – – Hearing impairment 96.8 (30) – 3.2 (1) – – Fistula deterioration 83.9 (26) – – – 16.1 (5) Late toxicity Proctitis/colitis 80.6 (25) 16.1 (5) – 3.2 (1) – Urinary incontinence 87 (27) 13 (4) – – – Fecal incontinence 96.8 (30) 3.2 (1) – – – Pelvic insufficiency fracture 87 (27) 6.5 (2) 3.2 (1) 3.2 (1) – Vaginal dryness 90.3 (28) 6.5 (2) 3.2 (1) – – Radiation erythema 93.5 (29) 3.2 (1) 3.2 (1) – – In general, the observed toxicity profile aligns with expectations for definitive chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer. Most toxicities were manageable, and severe complications such as fistula formation (appearing at a median time of 5.7 weeks after the initiation of therapy, range 1–7 weeks) were addressed with appropriate interventions based on their severity, including surgical management for complex cases. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) Patient-reported outcome assessment was performed using a paper-based version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires. In the domain of endocrine function, several patients reported a reduction in libido, with a few describing the symptoms as severe (grade 3). Most respondents indicated that they were not sexually active and reported low levels of interest and satisfaction in this area. Vaginal dryness was noted but did not cause significant discomfort. Physical well-being was largely characterized by mild to moderate impairments. Fatigue, pain, and limitations in daily activities such as work and hobbies were commonly reported, with 1 patient describing these issues as severe. Shortness of breath and physical limitations during exertion were less frequent but present in some cases. Emotional well-being was also affected, with occasional reports of irritability, worry, or sadness. Social and financial challenges were mentioned by a small number of patients. Regarding overall health and quality of life, most patients rated their status as “excellent,” while others reported notable impairments. Discussion Our study highlights the pivotal role of advanced radiotherapy techniques for achieving durable LC in FIGO stage IVA cervical cancer. In our cohort, the 10-year LC probability was 70.4%, aligning with prior studies such as those by Schiff et al. and Park et al., which underscore the efficacy of BT in improving outcomes for advanced-stage disease [ 10 11 p The EMBRACE-I study, a pivotal investigation in MRI-guided adaptive brachytherapy, analyzed 1341 patients from 24 centers in Europe, Asia, and North America. Among these, only 34 patients had FIGO stage IVA disease, representing 2.5% of the cohort [ 12 13 14 Beyond these established approaches, recent advances in radiation oncology have introduced online adaptive radiotherapy (online ART) as a promising tool to further enhance precision and minimize toxicity [ 15 16 17 18 Our findings reaffirm the pivotal role of BT in improving outcomes, particularly when integrated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Park et al. demonstrated superior LC rates in patients with bladder or rectal invasion treated with BT compared to those receiving only an EBRT boost [ 11 12 19 Prognostic factors play a substantial role in determining survival outcomes. Our study reaffirmed the significant prognostic value of ECOG performance status ( p p 20 21 11 While achieving robust LC remains a primary therapeutic goal, the predominance of distant failures highlights the need for systemic therapies to improve OS. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab have shown significant promise in this context. The KEYNOTE-A18 trial demonstrated a 30% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death with the addition of pembrolizumab to chemoradiotherapy, with 2‑year PFS rates of 68–57% for chemoradiotherapy alone, particularly in PD-L1-positive and HPV-driven tumors. The trial further highlighted that pembrolizumab may offer particular benefit in patients with high-risk disease, including those with nodal involvement [ 22 23 24 In parallel, advancements in liquid biopsy technology could transform the therapeutic landscape. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) provide opportunities for early detection, treatment monitoring, and recurrence identification [ 25 26 27 28 30 Management of treatment-related toxicities remains a critical component of optimizing cervical cancer treatment. Acute toxicities were observed in 87.1% of patients in our cohort, with the most common gastrointestinal symptoms being diarrhea (38.7%) and nausea (29.1%). Among urogenital toxicities, non-infectious cystitis was reported in 51.6% of patients and was the most common toxicity in this category. These findings are consistent with previous studies by Maduro et al. and Alfrink et al., which reported gastrointestinal, hematological, and urogenital toxicities as common side effects of chemoradiotherapy [ 31 32 10 12 Fistula formation remains a particularly severe late complication, occurring in 16.1% of our cohort. This aligns with reported rates in the literature, which range from 4.5 to 44%, depending on patient characteristics and treatment protocols [ 33 35 36 38 39 39 40 39 Beyond physical complications, the long-term impact on quality of life (QoL) is significant. Patients often experience a combination of physical and psychosocial challenges, including fatigue, diarrhea, urinary symptoms, anxiety, and depression [ 41 Finally, global disparities in access to advanced therapies, such as MRI-guided BT and modern imaging techniques, remain a major challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries [ 42 Several limitations of this study must be acknowledged. The small sample size, particularly in subgroup analyses (e.g., patients receiving fewer than four fractions of BT), limits the statistical power and generalizability of the findings. The retrospective design introduces potential biases, including variability in patient selection, incomplete follow-up, and inconsistencies in treatment delivery. Furthermore, the absence of standardized imaging protocols for post-treatment surveillance may have contributed to underreporting or misclassification of recurrences and metastases. While this study underscores the importance of brachytherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in FIGO stage IVA cervical cancer, prospective trials with larger cohorts are needed to confirm these findings. Future research should focus on refining therapeutic strategies for high-risk subgroups, such as those with advanced organ infiltration or lymph node involvement. Emerging techniques, such as liquid biopsy for treatment monitoring and recurrence detection and the integration of immunotherapy to improve systemic control, warrant further investigation. Additionally, advancements in adaptive radiotherapy and dose optimization could enhance local control while minimizing treatment-related toxicities. Conclusion This study highlights the critical role of advanced radiotherapy techniques, particularly MRI-guided brachytherapy, in the management of FIGO stage IVA cervical cancer. These methods provide effective local control and reduce the need for invasive procedures such as pelvic exenteration. Despite the high risk of systemic progression, these approaches remain central to improving survival outcomes. Future studies should validate these findings in larger, multi-institutional cohorts and explore systemic therapies to address distant failures. Expanding global access to these advanced treatments is essential for improving outcomes in this high-risk population.
