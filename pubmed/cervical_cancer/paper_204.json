This study investigates the geographic, temporal, and sex-specific disparities in high BMI-attributable cancer burden, stratified by the Socioeconomic Development Index (SDI), to inform precision public health strategies. Methods Leveraging the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) dataset, we analyzed age-standardized mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and years of life lost (YLLs) for 17–23 countries across Asia and globally. SDI-stratified analyses evaluated temporal trends (2015–2021) and cancer-type contributions, while multivariable models assessed associations between income inequality (Gini coefficient), healthcare capacity, and metabolic risk exposure. Results Marked disparities emerged across SDI gradients: high-SDI nations exhibited 6.7-fold higher mortality rates (e.g., Malaysia: 4.40 vs. Bangladesh: 0.65/100,000) and concentrated burdens in colorectal (40.5% DALYs) and breast cancers (27.0% DALYs), contrasting with distributed burdens in low-SDI regions (no cancer > 15.6% DALYs). Gender disparities highlighted male predominance in liver (+ 8.4 DALY difference) and colorectal cancers (+ 5.1), while female-specific malignancies (e.g., uterine cancer) retained consistent burdens across SDI levels. Temporal analyses revealed accelerated DALY reductions in middle-SDI regions (-4.5% annual percent change [APC]) but rising breast cancer burdens in low-SDI settings (+ 1.2% APC). Economic inequality (Gini > 0.40) correlated with elevated mortality (Turkey: 123.1/100,000), independent of GDP, underscoring synergistic impacts of BMI and sociodemographic inequities. Conclusion High BMI-driven pan-cancer burden is profoundly shaped by SDI gradients, reflecting interactions between metabolic risk, healthcare access, and socioeconomic determinants. Tailored interventions—prioritizing colorectal and breast cancers in high-SDI regions and addressing systemic inequities in low-SDI settings—are critical to mitigating the dual burden of obesity and cancer in transitioning populations.

First, prior studies have inadequately addressed sex-specific disparities in high BMI-related cancers. For instance, while endometrial cancer shows strong female predominance, emerging data suggest that males with high BMI face elevated risks for aggressive subtypes of prostate and liver cancers [ 8 9 10 11 To address these gaps, we leveraged the 2021 GBD dataset to conduct a comprehensive analysis of high BMI-driven pan-cancer burden across 21 countries, stratified by SDI quintiles. Our study aims to: (1) Quantify 2015–2021 temporal trends and geographic disparities in age-standardized mortality, DALYs, and YLLs for high BMI-attributable cancers across SDI quintiles in 21 Asian and global countries; (2) Identify SDI-stratified cancer-type-specific burden distributions (e.g., colorectal, breast cancer) and their association with metabolic risk profiles; (3) Evaluate the independent and interactive effects of income inequality (Gini coefficient), healthcare capacity, and sex-specific vulnerabilities on high BMI-driven cancer outcomes. This research provides novel insights into the syndemic interaction between obesity and cancer, offering evidence to guide SDI-tailored prevention policies and mitigate global health inequities. Materials and methods Geospatial analysis of high BMI-related cancer burden The study analyzed age-standardized metrics from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 database to assess the pan-cancer burden attributable to high body mass index (BMI) across 17 Asian countries. Mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and years of life lost (YLLs) were extracted using the GBD Compare Tool (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation [IHME]), with geospatial alignment ensured by mapping country-specific ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes. Territories with unresolved geopolitical status ( n p p SDI-stratified comparative risk assessment A comparative analysis of BMI-attributable cancer burden was conducted across 22 countries using GBD 2021 estimates standardized to the WHO World Standard Population. Twelve malignancies with IARC Group 1 evidence for obesity association (e.g., colorectal, postmenopausal breast, and endometrial cancers) were selected based on meta-analyses by Lauby-Secretan et al. (2016). Age-standardized mortality and DALY rates were calculated through compartmental modeling integrating: Population-attributable fractions (PAFs) derived from comparative risk assessment; Theoretical minimum risk exposure distribution (BMI 21–23 kg/m²); Exposure-response relationships from pooled cohort studies. SDI stratification followed GBD 2021 protocols (low: 0–0.35; middle: 0.36–0.69; high: ≥0.70). Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were generated through 10,000-cycle Monte Carlo simulations accounting for exposure variance, relative risk heterogeneity, and PAF estimation error. Statistical significance thresholds were adjusted for multiple testing using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (FDR < 0.05). Sex-specific disparity analysis Sex-stratified DALY rates for eight high BMI-associated cancers (gallbladder, ovarian, renal, pancreatic, liver, colorectal, breast, and uterine cancers) were extracted from GBD 2021 Asian datasets. Data were filtered to retain only age-standardized rates (metric_name=\"rate”; age_name=\"age-standardized”). Male-to-female disparity (Δ) was calculated as:  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathrm\\Delta=\\mathrm{Male}\\;\\mathrm{DALY}\\;\\mathrm{rate}-\\mathrm{Female}\\;\\mathrm{DALY}\\;\\mathrm{rate}$$\\end{document} 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed via error propagation  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\begin{aligned}\\mathrm{CI}=\\lbrack&\\mathrm\\Delta-({\\mathrm{male}}_{\\mathrm{lower}}-{\\mathrm{female}}_{\\mathrm{upper}}),\\\\&\\mathrm\\Delta+({\\mathrm{male}}_{\\mathrm{upper}}-{\\mathrm{female}}_{\\mathrm{lower}})\\rbrack \\end{aligned}$$\\end{document} Statistical significance was defined as CI exclusion of zero. Disparities were visualized through bidirectional waterfall plots (Plotly v5.18.0) with male-excess (blue) and female-excess (red) bars. Sensitivity analyses confirmed stability across alternative CI estimation methods. Socioeconomic contextual analysis The analytical framework utilized nationally representative data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2024 (IHME) and the World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform (2024) covering 23 Asian countries. Cancer mortality rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were paired with socioeconomic indicators, including Gini coefficients (income inequality) and GDP per capita (adjusted for purchasing power parity), to assess contextual associations. Data integrity was ensured through rigorous validation against source repositories, with exclusion criteria applied to incomplete or non-harmonized entries. Bivariate analyses were conducted using Pearson’s correlation coefficients to quantify relationships between mortality rates and socioeconomic variables, supplemented by linear regression models to adjust for population size heterogeneity. Interactive scatterplots were generated programmatically via Plotly.js (v2.18.0) to visualize non-linear trends, with axes scaled to standardized ranges (Gini: 0.25–0.45; GDP: PPP-adjusted USD) to enhance cross-country comparability. All analyses were stratified to account for region-specific confounders, including prevalence of high BMI-driven cancer DALYs, with sensitivity tests confirming robustness to outlier exclusion. Statistical significance was evaluated at α = 0.05 using two-tailed tests, and analytical workflows were implemented in R (v4.3.1) with full reproducibility protocols. To address potential confounding, multivariable linear regression models were employed, adjusting for population size, healthcare access and quality index (HAQ), and urbanization rate. Confounding by GDP per capita and income inequality (Gini coefficient) was explicitly controlled via fixed-effects modeling. The GBD framework inherently accounts for demographic confounding through age-standardization to the WHO World Standard Population, and comparative risk assessment methods isolate the attributable burden of high BMI by referencing a theoretical minimum risk exposure distribution (BMI 21–23 kg/m²). Sensitivity analyses excluded outliers and verified results using robust regression techniques, with all models validated via 1,000-cycle bootstrap resampling to assess coefficient stability. Temporal and SDI-stratified analysis of high BMI-related cancer burden The temporal trends and sociodemographic gradients of high BMI-related cancer burden were analyzed using age-standardized DALY rates (per 100,000 population) extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 2015–2021 dataset for Asian populations. Joinpoint regression models (Joinpoint Software 4.9.1.0, NCI) identified significant inflection points in trends through Monte Carlo permutation testing (α = 0.05), with annual percentage changes (APCs) calculated using weighted least squares. SDI-stratified analyses employed predefined GBD thresholds (low: <45; middle: 45–70; high: ≥70), validated through sensitivity analyses comparing Akaike/Bayesian information criteria. Cancer-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs) were derived using comparative risk assessment methodology, incorporating BMI exposure distributions and evidence-weighted risk ratios from meta-analyses. Threshold effects were quantified via multivariable segmented regression, adjusting for healthcare access and quality index. All analyses adhered to GATHER guidelines, with uncertainty intervals estimated through 1000 bootstrap iterations of complex survey design parameters. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were conducted through an integrated framework encompassing descriptive spatial clustering (Moran’s I), Joinpoint regression for temporal trends, and multivariable modeling (weighted least squares, generalized additive models). Key inferential analyses included Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 iterations) for uncertainty quantification and spatial autocorrelation testing via Moran’s I (global clustering) and local Getis-Ord statistics (hotspot detection). Significance for spatial patterns was defined as Moran’s I > 0.15 with p 2 Results Geographic disparities in high BMI-driven pan-cancer burden The geospatial analysis of high BMI-driven pan-cancer burden across 17 countries in 2021 revealed marked disparities in mortality and disability metrics. Age-standardized death rates exhibited a 6.7-fold variation, ranging from 0.65 (Bangladesh) to 4.40 per 100,000 population (Malaysia), with elevated mortality clusters observed in Southeast Asia (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand) and South Asia (Pakistan). Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) followed a similar geographical pattern, exceeding 120 per 100,000 in Malaysia—nearly 6.5 times higher than Bangladesh (18.71), underscoring the dual impact of premature mortality and chronic morbidity. Years of life lost (YLLs) further highlighted regional inequities, with East Asian nations (Japan, South Korea) and Singapore demonstrating intermediate YLL rates (3.17–4.42), contrasting sharply with higher burdens in Malaysia (4.09) and lower values in South Asia (India: 0.68; Bangladesh: 0.42). These gradients align with SDI stratifications, as high-SDI nations (e.g., Malaysia: 4.40 deaths/100,000) exhibited 6.7-fold higher mortality than low-SDI counterparts (Bangladesh: 0.65), a disparity partially explained by their 3.2-fold greater healthcare access scores (HAQ: 68 vs. 21) and 2.1-fold higher prevalence of obesity-related comorbidities. Conversely, low-SDI regions showed reduced YLLs (India: 0.68), likely reflecting competing mortality from infectious diseases that truncate survival before obesity-related cancers manifest—findings consistent with GBD analyses showing inverse associations between undernutrition and cancer detection rates in these settings [ 11 1  Fig. 1 The maps of tumor death incidence rate, DALYs, and YLLs rate. Figure A B C Burden of pan-cancer by region/sdi category The 2021 Global Burden of Disease analysis revealed substantial disparities in high BMI-attributable cancer burden across 21 countries, with marked variations in mortality and disability metrics. Age-standardized death rates ranged from 0.12 (95% UI: 0.08–0.17) per 100,000 in Afghanistan to 3.21 (2.89–3.55) in China, collectively accounting for 13.4% (12.1–14.8) of global obesity-related cancer deaths. DALYs attributable to high BMI exhibited parallel trends, with China, the United States, and India contributing disproportionately to the global share (15.6%, 10.0%, and 13.5%, respectively). YLL patterns mirrored mortality outcomes, emphasizing the role of premature deaths in regions with limited healthcare infrastructure (e.g., Nigeria, YLLs: 8.67 [6.9–10.4]). Notably, high-income nations like the U.S. and Germany demonstrated elevated absolute rates (Deaths: 2.05 [1.78–2.33]; DALYs: 39.84 [35.6–44.1]), while lower SDI countries showed higher proportional burdens relative to their overall disease profiles(Table 1  Table 1 Burden of Pan-cancer by region/sdi category Region Deaths (95% UI) DALYs (95% UI) YLLs (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Afghanistan 0.12 (0.08–0.17) 0.5% (0.3–0.7) 2.34 (1.89–2.81) 0.6% (0.4–0.8) 1.98 (1.52–2.45) 0.5% (0.3–0.7) Brazil 1.45 (1.21–1.72) 6.1% (5.3–7.0) 28.76 (25.34–32.1) 7.2% (6.5–8.1) 24.11 (21.0–27.3) 6.8% (5.9–7.7) China 3.21 (2.89–3.55) 13.4% (12.1–14.8) 62.45 (56.1–68.8) 15.6% (14.1–17.2) 52.33 (47.2–57.4) 14.7% (13.3–16.2) France 0.89 (0.73–1.05) 3.7% (3.1–4.4) 17.21 (14.5–19.9) 4.3% (3.6–5.0) 14.45 (12.1–16.8) 4.1% (3.4–4.8) Germany 1.02 (0.84–1.21) 4.3% (3.5–5.1) 19.88 (17.1–22.6) 5.0% (4.3–5.7) 16.72 (14.3–19.1) 4.7% (4.0–5.4) India 2.78 (2.35–3.22) 11.6% (9.8–13.5) 54.12 (47.8–60.5) 13.5% (12.0–15.1) 45.41 (40.1–50.7) 12.8% (11.3–14.3) Iran 0.67 (0.52–0.83) 2.8% (2.2–3.5) 13.05 (10.8–15.3) 3.3% (2.7–3.9) 10.97 (9.1–12.8) 3.1% (2.6–3.6) Italy 0.95 (0.78–1.12) 4.0% (3.3–4.7) 18.44 (15.8–21.1) 4.6% (3.9–5.3) 15.49 (13.2–17.8) 4.4% (3.7–5.1) Japan 1.34 (1.12–1.57) 5.6% (4.7–6.6) 26.01 (22.8–29.2) 6.5% (5.7–7.3) 21.85 (19.1–24.6) 6.2% (5.4–7.0) Mexico 0.76 (0.61–0.92) 3.2% (2.6–3.9) 14.78 (12.4–17.1) 3.7% (3.1–4.3) 12.42 (10.4–14.4) 3.5% (2.9–4.1) Nigeria 0.53 (0.39–0.68) 2.2% (1.6–2.8) 10.32 (8.3–12.4) 2.6% (2.1–3.1) 8.67 (6.9–10.4) 2.4% (1.9–2.9) Pakistan 0.81 (0.65–0.98) 3.4% (2.7–4.1) 15.76 (13.2–18.3) 3.9% (3.3–4.6) 13.24 (11.1–15.4) 3.7% (3.1–4.4) Russia 1.12 (0.92–1.33) 4.7% (3.8–5.6) 21.78 (18.9–24.7) 5.4% (4.7–6.2) 18.30 (15.8–20.8) 5.2% (4.5–5.9) Saudi Arabia 0.34 (0.25–0.44) 1.4% (1.0–1.8) 6.61 (5.3–7.9) 1.7% (1.3–2.0) 5.55 (4.4–6.7) 1.6% (1.2–1.9) South Africa 0.98 (0.79–1.17) 4.1% (3.3–4.9) 19.05 (16.1–22.0) 4.8% (4.0–5.5) 16.00 (13.5–18.5) 4.5% (3.8–5.2) South Korea 0.65 (0.52–0.79) 2.7% (2.2–3.3) 12.63 (10.6–14.7) 3.2% (2.6–3.7) 10.61 (8.9–12.3) 3.0% (2.5–3.5) Spain 0.88 (0.71–1.05) 3.7% (3.0–4.4) 17.10 (14.5–19.7) 4.3% (3.6–4.9) 14.37 (12.1–16.6) 4.1% (3.4–4.7) Turkey 0.72 (0.58–0.87) 3.0% (2.4–3.6) 14.00 (11.8–16.2) 3.5% (3.0–4.1) 11.76 (9.9–13.6) 3.3% (2.8–3.8) United Kingdom 1.18 (0.98–1.39) 4.9% (4.1–5.8) 22.93 (20.1–25.8) 5.7% (5.0–6.5) 19.26 (16.8–21.7) 5.4% (4.7–6.1) United States 2.05 (1.78–2.33) 8.6% (7.4–9.8) 39.84 (35.6–44.1) 10.0% (8.9–11.1) 33.46 (29.8–37.1) 9.4% (8.4–10.5) Vietnam 0.47 (0.35–0.60) 2.0% (1.5–2.5) 9.14 (7.3–11.0) 2.3% (1.8–2.8) 7.68 (6.1–9.3) 2.2% (1.7–2.6) Notes:Rate: Age-standardized per 100,000 population. %: Percentage of global burden. UI: Uncertainty interval High BMI-attributable cancer burden by SDI category and cancer type Globally, the age-standardized mortality and DALY rates attributable to high BMI exhibited substantial disparities across SDI categories, with high-SDI nations bearing the greatest cancer burden (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 The high BMI-attributable cancer burden by SDI category and cancer type. A B C The proportional burden attributable to high BMI increased monotonically with SDI level for most malignancies. Pancreatic and kidney cancers showed particularly steep gradients, with mortality rate ratios of 5.7-fold (0.51 vs. 0.09/100,000) and 6.1-fold (0.43 vs. 0.07/100,000) between high- and low-SDI regions. Strikingly, 40.1% (95% UI 35.5–44.7) of obesity-related DALYs in high-SDI countries derived from colorectal cancer alone, exceeding the combined burden of breast (26.7%) and liver cancers (17.0%). Conversely, low-SDI nations exhibited more distributed burden patterns, with no single cancer type exceeding 15.6% of total DALYs. Gender-specific cancers demonstrated differential impacts, as prostate cancer accounted for 6.8% of male DALYs in high-SDI areas versus 2.3% in low-SDI regions, while endometrial cancer maintained consistent proportional burden (4.7–5.6%) across all development strata (Table 2  Table 2 High BMI-Attributable cancer burden by SDI category and cancer type (2021) Cancer Type Low SDI Middle SDI High SDI Deaths (95% UI) DALYs (95% UI) YLLs (95% UI) Deaths (95% UI) DALYs (95% UI) YLLs (95% UI) Deaths (95% UI) DALYs (95% UI) YLLs (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Rate (95% UI) % (95% UI) Breast 0.21 (0.15–0.28) 8.3% (6.1–10.5) 4.12 (3.45–4.79) 7.9% (6.4–9.4) 3.45 (2.89–4.01) 8.1% (6.7–9.5) 0.89 (0.72–1.06) 14.2% (11.5–16.9) 17.65 (15.1–20.2) 15.6% (13.1–18.1) 14.82 (12.6–17.0) 15.8% (13.4–18.2) 1.54 (1.32–1.76) 24.1% (20.6–27.6) 30.12 (26.8–33.4) 26.7% (23.8–29.6) 25.30 (22.5–28.1) 27.0% (24.0–30.0) Colorectal 0.18 (0.13–0.23) 7.1% (5.3–8.9) 3.78 (3.11–4.45) 7.3% (6.0–8.6) 3.17 (2.62–3.72) 7.4% (6.1–8.7) 1.02 (0.84–1.20) 16.3% (13.4–19.2) 20.11 (17.5–22.7) 17.8% (15.5–20.1) 16.89 (14.6–19.2) 18.0% (15.6–20.4) 2.31 (2.01–2.61) 36.2% (31.5–40.9) 45.23 (40.1–50.3) 40.1% (35.5–44.7) 38.00 (33.7–42.3) 40.5% (36.0–45.0) Liver 0.15 (0.10–0.20) 5.9% (4.1–7.7) 2.95 (2.41–3.49) 5.7% (4.6–6.8) 2.48 (2.03–2.93) 5.8% (4.7–6.9) 0.67 (0.54–0.80) 10.7% (8.6–12.8) 13.20 (11.2–15.2) 11.7% (9.9–13.5) 11.09 (9.4–12.8) 11.8% (10.0–13.6) 0.98 (0.83–1.13) 15.3% (13.0–17.6) 19.15 (16.9–21.4) 17.0% (15.0–19.0) 16.09 (14.2–18.0) 17.1% (15.1–19.1) Esophageal 0.12 (0.08–0.16) 4.7% (3.3–6.1) 2.34 (1.89–2.79) 4.5% (3.6–5.4) 1.97 (1.59–2.35) 4.6% (3.7–5.5) 0.45 (0.35–0.55) 7.2% (5.6–8.8) 8.89 (7.3–10.5) 7.9% (6.5–9.3) 7.47 (6.1–8.8) 8.0% (6.5–9.5) 0.67 (0.55–0.79) 10.5% (8.6–12.4) 13.11 (11.4–14.8) 11.6% (10.1–13.1) 11.02 (9.6–12.4) 11.7% (10.2–13.2) Pancreatic 0.09 (0.06–0.12) 3.5% (2.4–4.6) 1.76 (1.40–2.12) 3.4% (2.7–4.1) 1.48 (1.18–1.78) 3.5% (2.8–4.2) 0.34 (0.26–0.42) 5.4% (4.2–6.6) 6.73 (5.5–7.96) 6.0% (4.9–7.1) 5.65 (4.6–6.7) 6.0% (4.9–7.1) 0.51 (0.42–0.60) 8.0% (6.6–9.4) 10.02 (8.7–11.3) 8.9% (7.7–10.1) 8.42 (7.3–9.5) 9.0% (7.8–10.2) Kidney 0.07 (0.04–0.10) 2.8% (1.7–3.9) 1.38 (1.07–1.69) 2.7% (2.0–3.4) 1.16 (0.90–1.42) 2.7% (2.1–3.3) 0.28 (0.21–0.35) 4.5% (3.4–5.6) 5.55 (4.5–6.6) 4.9% (4.0–5.8) 4.66 (3.8–5.5) 5.0% (4.0–6.0) 0.43 (0.35–0.51) 6.7% (5.5–8.0) 8.41 (7.1–9.7) 7.5% (6.3–8.7) 7.07 (5.9–8.2) 7.5% (6.3–8.7) Ovarian 0.05 (0.03–0.07) 2.0% (1.2–2.8) 1.02 (0.78–1.26) 2.0% (1.5–2.5) 0.86 (0.66–1.06) 2.0% (1.5–2.5) 0.21 (0.16–0.26) 3.4% (2.5–4.3) 4.16 (3.3–5.0) 3.7% (2.9–4.5) 3.50 (2.8–4.2) 3.7% (3.0–4.4) 0.32 (0.26–0.38) 5.0% (4.1–6.0) 6.27 (5.3–7.2) 5.6% (4.7–6.5) 5.27 (4.4–6.1) 5.6% (4.7–6.5) Endometrial 0.04 (0.02–0.06) 1.6% (0.9–2.3) 0.78 (0.58–0.98) 1.5% (1.1–1.9) 0.66 (0.49–0.83) 1.5% (1.1–1.9) 0.18 (0.13–0.23) 2.9% (2.1–3.7) 3.56 (2.8–4.3) 3.2% (2.5–3.9) 3.00 (2.4–3.6) 3.2% (2.5–3.9) 0.27 (0.21–0.33) 4.2% (3.3–5.1) 5.29 (4.4–6.2) 4.7% (3.9–5.5) 4.45 (3.7–5.2) 4.7% (3.9–5.5) Gallbladder 0.03 (0.02–0.04) 1.2% (0.7–1.7) 0.59 (0.43–0.75) 1.1% (0.8–1.4) 0.50 (0.36–0.64) 1.2% (0.8–1.5) 0.12 (0.09–0.15) 1.9% (1.4–2.4) 2.38 (1.9–2.9) 2.1% (1.7–2.5) 2.00 (1.6–2.4) 2.1% (1.7–2.5) 0.18 (0.14–0.22) 2.8% (2.2–3.4) 3.53 (2.9–4.2) 3.1% (2.6–3.6) 2.97 (2.4–3.5) 3.2% (2.6–3.8) Thyroid 0.02 (0.01–0.03) 0.8% (0.4–1.2) 0.39 (0.27–0.51) 0.8% (0.5–1.1) 0.33 (0.23–0.43) 0.8% (0.5–1.1) 0.09 (0.06–0.12) 1.4% (1.0–1.8) 1.78 (1.4–2.2) 1.6% (1.2–2.0) 1.50 (1.2–1.8) 1.6% (1.2–2.0) 0.14 (0.11–0.17) 2.2% (1.7–2.7) 2.74 (2.2–3.3) 2.4% (1.9–3.0) 2.30 (1.8–2.8) 2.5% (1.9–3.0) Prostate 0.06 (0.04–0.08) 2.4% (1.6–3.2) 1.17 (0.91–1.43) 2.3% (1.8–2.8) 0.98 (0.76–1.20) 2.3% (1.8–2.8) 0.25 (0.19–0.31) 4.0% (3.1–4.9) 4.95 (4.0–5.9) 4.4% (3.5–5.3) 4.16 (3.4–4.9) 4.4% (3.6–5.2) 0.39 (0.32–0.46) 6.1% (5.0–7.2) 7.64 (6.5–8.8) 6.8% (5.8–7.8) 6.42 (5.4–7.4) 6.8% (5.8–7.8) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma 0.04 (0.02–0.06) 1.6% (0.9–2.3) 0.79 (0.58–1.00) 1.5% (1.1–1.9) 0.66 (0.49–0.83) 1.5% (1.1–1.9) 0.16 (0.12–0.20) 2.6% (1.9–3.3) 3.15 (2.5–3.8) 2.8% (2.2–3.4) 2.65 (2.1–3.2) 2.8% (2.2–3.4) 0.24 (0.19–0.29) 3.8% (3.0–4.6) 4.70 (3.9–5.5) 4.2% (3.5–4.9) 3.95 (3.3–4.6) 4.2% (3.5–4.9) Notes: Rate: Age-standardized per 100,000 population. %: Proportion of total cancer burden attributable to high BMI within each SDI category. UI: Uncertainty interval Sex-specific disparities in high BMI-attributable cancer burden The sex-specific disparities in high BMI-attributable cancer burden were pronounced across eight malignancies in Asia (Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Gender Disparities in High BMI-related Cancers (Age-standardized DALY Rates) Cancer mortality-socioeconomic associations in Asian populations The analysis of 2021 data from 23 Asian countries revealed significant heterogeneity in cancer mortality rates, ranging from 61.8 (Bangladesh) to 214.7 (Mongolia) deaths per 100,000 population, with income inequality (Gini coefficient: 0.27–0.44) and economic disparities emerging as critical contextual factors. Countries with higher Gini coefficients, such as Turkey (0.44) and Malaysia (0.41), exhibited elevated cancer mortality rates (123.1 and 110.9, respectively), suggesting a potential association between socioeconomic inequality and cancer burden. Notably, Mongolia demonstrated the highest mortality rate (214.7) despite a moderate Gini index (0.31), highlighting the influence of non-income determinants, possibly including limited healthcare access or high BMI-driven cancer risks. Conversely, nations with lower inequality indices, like Armenia and Bhutan (Gini: 0.28), reported comparatively reduced mortality (128.8 and 67.3). Preliminary alignment with GDP per capita trends further indicated that higher-income economies, such as South Korea (Gini: 0.33; mortality: 107.0), did not uniformly correlate with lower mortality, underscoring the complex interplay between economic development, equitable resource distribution, and lifestyle factors like obesity. These findings collectively emphasize the need for multidimensional public health strategies addressing both socioeconomic disparities and modifiable risk factors, particularly in regions with dual burdens of inequality and high BMI-related cancer DALYs (Fig. 4  Fig. 4 Cancer Mortality-Socioeconomic Associations in Asian Populations.

The 6.7-fold variation in age-standardized mortality rates (0.65–4.40/100,000) and DALY disparities exceeding 6.5-fold (18.71–120/100,000) between low-SDI (Bangladesh) and high-SDI (Malaysia) nations align with prior evidence that obesogenic environments in rapidly transitioning economies—characterized by urbanization, processed food consumption, and sedentary lifestyles—disproportionately elevate cancer risks before healthcare systems adapt to mitigate late-stage morbidity [ 5 3 11 12 The SDI-stratified disparities in cancer-type-specific burdens attributable to high BMI reflect distinct pathways of metabolic carcinogenesis modulated by development stages. The dominance of colorectal cancer in high-SDI nations (36.2% deaths, 40.5% DALYs) aligns with prolonged exposure to Westernized diets rich in processed meats and sedentary behaviors, compounded by enhanced detection through routine screening programs that amplify recorded incidence [ 13 3 14 15 16 The observed sex-specific disparities in high BMI-attributable cancer burden underscore the interplay of biological susceptibility and gender-mediated risk behaviors. The pronounced male predominance in liver (+ 8.4 DALY difference) and colorectal cancers (+ 5.1) aligns with evidence that androgen signaling potentiates adipokine-driven carcinogenesis—specifically, visceral adiposity in males enhances interleukin-6 production, promoting hepatic inflammation and colorectal adenoma progression [ 12 17 18 19 20 21 The interplay between socioeconomic inequality and temporal trends in high BMI-related cancer burden reveals a dynamic tension between metabolic risk escalation and health system adaptation across SDI strata. The association of elevated Gini coefficients (> 0.40) with cancer mortality in Asian nations (e.g., Turkey: 123.1 vs. Bhutan: 67.3/100,000) aligns with the “deprivation amplification” hypothesis, wherein income inequality exacerbates obesogenic environments through food deserts in urban slums while limiting access to diagnostic technologies—a dual mechanism disproportionately increasing late-stage cancer presentations in marginalized populations [ 22 14 21 23 24 This study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, the reliance on GBD 2021 estimates introduces uncertainties inherent to modeled data, including potential misclassification of BMI-attributable cancer cases and regional variations in data completeness. Second, the focus on 21 countries (predominantly Asian) may limit generalizability to other global regions, particularly sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, where obesity-cancer dynamics differ. Third, the study defines high BMI as a binary exposure, potentially overlooking nonlinear dose-response relationships or abdominal adiposity metrics (e.g., waist circumference) that may better predict cancer risk. Fourth, while SDI captures socioeconomic development, it does not fully account for individual-level confounding factors (e.g., physical activity, diet quality) or healthcare system efficiency, which may modulate obesity-cancer pathways. Future research integrating individual-level data and longitudinal designs is needed to address these gaps. Conclusion This study elucidates the profound socioeconomic stratification of high BMI-driven pan-cancer burden, revealing three key patterns. First, high-SDI nations bear concentrated burdens dominated by colorectal (40.5% DALYs) and breast cancers, whereas low-SDI regions exhibit fragmented burdens with no single cancer exceeding 15.6% DALYs, reflecting divergent metabolic risk exposures and healthcare capacities. Second, gender disparities persist: males face elevated risks for liver and colorectal cancers, while female-specific malignancies (e.g., uterine cancer) maintain stable burdens across SDI levels. Third, temporal trends highlight a critical transition window in middle-SDI regions, where targeted interventions achieved accelerated DALY reductions (−4.5% APC), contrasting with rising breast cancer burdens in low-SDI settings (+ 1.2% APC). Crucially, economic inequality (Gini > 0.40) independently amplified mortality risks, as seen in Turkey (123.1/100,000) versus Bhutan (67.3), underscoring its role as a modifiable carcinogenic determinant. To address these disparities, we advocate SDI-stratified strategies: prioritizing precision screening in high-SDI regions, integrating BMI metrics into cancer registries for middle-SDI populations, and deploying mobile health technologies in low-SDI areas. These findings challenge linear SDI-health paradigms, emphasizing that obesity-related cancer burden is not merely a metabolic crisis but a syndemic shaped by equity gaps in prevention and care.
