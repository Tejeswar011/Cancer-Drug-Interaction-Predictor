Even worse, an increasing number of cancer cases are diagnosed yearly, and two and a half million new cancer cases are estimated to be diagnosed in 2035. Some antipsychotic drugs, especially those targeting dopamine receptor (DR) D2, demonstrated anticancer activity. Studies have revealed the potential of DRD2 antagonists as anticancer therapeutics, whether alone or as an adjuvant, in treating breast cancer, lung cancer, and others. Emerging evidences indicate DRD2 is involved in the CRC biology, and the association between DRD2 and CRC could be utilized in treating CRC. This study selected DRD2 antagonists with anticancer activity to elucidate the possibility of DRD2 antagonists as new therapeutics for treating CRC.
