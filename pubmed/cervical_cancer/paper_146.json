Unlike linear RNA, circRNA is resistant to RNA exonucleases, rendering it more stable and less prone to degradation, thus maintaining consistent expression levels [ 19 20 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 28 To date, research has demonstrated that circRNAs are intricately linked to a spectrum of human diseases, encompassing cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders [ 29 32 21 33 In this study, our objective was to elucidate the impact of S. typhimurium S. typhimurium S. typhimurium S. typhimurium S. typhimurium Materials and methods Bacterial strains and cell lines The E. coli O157: H7 S. typhimurium 8 34 MC38 cells were from provided by Prof. Chuanping Si (Institute of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Jining Medical College). HEK293T cells (RRID: CVCL_0063) and Human colonic epithelial HCT116 cells (RRID: CVCL_0291) obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Virginia). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and penicillin-streptomycin, and maintained at 37 °C. Additionally, all experiments were conducted using mycoplasma-free cells. HCT116 cells were treated with LPS (0, 0.5, 1, 10 µg/ml) for 6 h as previously described [ 35 Animals and experimental protocol Male C57BL/6 mice (16–22 g) aged 6–8 weeks were procured from the Animal Core Facility of Nanjing Medical University and housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. Experimental protocols involving mice were approved by the Nanjing Medical University Experimental Animal Welfare Ethics Committee (IACUC-1811064-7). For cell treatments, cells were harvested at sub-confluence, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in serum-free medium. Subsequently, 5 × 10^5 MC38 cells were subcutaneously injected into the upper left flank of C57BL/6 mice. Tumor size was measured with digital calipers every four days starting 10 days after injection, and tumor volume was calculated using the formula (length × width^2)/2. After five weeks, the mice were euthanized, and the MC38 cell tumors were excised. RNA extraction and cDNA library construction HCT116 cells were exposed to S. typhimurium 36 S. typhimurium ® RNA sequencing and data processing The raw data underwent quality control using fastp to filter out low-quality reads. Subsequently, the clean reads were aligned to the hg38 reference genome using TopHat v2.0.9 [ 37 37 Quantitative real-time PCR Epithelial cells were lysed, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent. RNA integrity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Subsequently, RNA was reverse transcribed using the HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR (+ gDNA wiper) (Vazyme, R323-01, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions as described before [ 34 34 Preparation of RNA followed by treatment with RNase R Total RNAs were extracted from the specified cells using TRIzol RNA Isolation Reagents (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), following the manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, 2 µg of RNA was treated with 6 U of RNase R (Epicenter Technologies, USA) for 20 min at 37 °C as described before [ 38 Luciferase activity assays The CircHIPK2 sequence was inserted downstream of the Renilla luciferase gene in the psiCHECK-2 reporter vector (GeneCopoeia). MiR-124-3p, miR-124-3p mut, and negative control (Neg. Ctrl.) mimics were synthesized by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with the miRNA mimic and luciferase reporter DNA and harvested 24 h post-transfection. Relative Renilla luciferase activity was quantified using the Duo-Lite luciferase assay kit (Vazyme, China). RNA pull-down experiments RNA pull-down experiments were conducted following previously established methods, utilizing biotin-labeled miRNA mimic oligonucleotides [ 39 40 Cancer cell migration and invasion assay Cells in logarithmic growth phase were detached with trypsin, suspended in serum-free medium, and seeded into polycarbonate membrane chambers (8-mm pore size, Corning, CLS3422, USA). After washing with PBS and counting using a Neubauer hemocytometer, the cell suspension was adjusted to 1 × 10^5 cells/mL. Subsequently, 200 µL of the cell suspension was added to each chamber well and evenly distributed by gentle agitation. The lower chamber was filled with 500 µL of medium containing 10% FBS. Following a 72-hour incubation period, cells on the upper surface of the membrane were removed using a cotton swab. Cells that had migrated to the lower surface were stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min, washed with PBS, and examined under a microscope. Images of three random fields (10× magnification) were captured per membrane, and migratory or invasive cells were quantified. Migration and invasion results were normalized to the initial cell number and treatment conditions. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Statistics Unless specified otherwise, data are expressed as mean ± SEM from a minimum of three independent biological replicates. Differences between two groups of samples were analyzed using the Student’s t-test, while differences among three or more groups were assessed using one-way ANOVA. All statistical tests were two-sided, with P-values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results Characterization of circrnas regulated by S. typhimurium To ascertain the cellular circRNAs influenced by S. typhimurium 1 1 1 19 1 S. typhimurium S. typhimurium 1 S. typhimurium 1 S. typhimurium 1 S. typhimurium 1 2 Salmonella typhimurium As annotated in circBase ( www.circbase.org 2 2 2 S. typhimurium 3 2 S. typhimurium 2 Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) play crucial roles in initiating and advancing inflammation, tissue damage, and tumorigenesis [ 41 S. typhimurium S. typhimurium 2 S. typhimurium Knockdown of circHIPK2 inhibited cytokines expression in HCT116 cells induced by S. typhimurium Recent study showed that circRNAs promoted CRC epithelial cell inflammation, migration, tumor genesis and development [ 42 44 45 3 S. typhimurium 3 S. typhimurium 7 9 3 S. typhimurium miR-124-3p binds to circHIPK2 to inhibit cell migration Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are recognized for their role as competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) that sequester miRNAs [ 46 2 http://www.circbank.cn/index.html 4 4 4 4 4 4 Overexpression circHIPK2 promoted MC38 cell proliferation, migration and subcutaneous tumor growth Given that S. typhimurium 2 5 5 5 5 Discussion In recent decades, due to advancements in high-throughput sequencing technology, the function of circRNA in disease has been rapidly elucidated. Increasing evidence suggests that circRNAs play essential roles in tumorigenesis and development, including the regulation of protein metabolism signaling, recruitment of chromatin modifiers, control of cell cycle progression, and various other cellular functions [ 21 47 49 5 S. typhimurium S. typhimurium 52 Numerous studies have shown that circRNAs could regulates inflammatory response to facilitate tumor development, progression, and metastasis. For instance, circATP5B functions as a miR-185-5p sponge, thereby promoting HOXB5 expression in glioma. This interaction transcriptionally regulates IL6 expression and facilitates the proliferation of GSCs through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway [ 53 54 55 58 39 45 59 62 59 45 63 S. typhimurium S. typhimurium To investigate circHIPK2’s role in CRC, we identified the miRNAs regulated by circHIPK2. Mir-124-3p was a cancer suppressor miRNA in multiple cancers like hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, CRC and so on by means of ceRNA function [ 64 66 64 65 66 S. typhimurium Our discovery that S. typhimurium S. typhimurium S. typhimurium 10 11 67 S. typhimurium 68 The limitation of our study didn’t find LPS, or other bacterial components attribute the microbiota-induced transcriptional alteration of circHIPK2.
