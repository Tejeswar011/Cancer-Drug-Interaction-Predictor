This meta-analysis systematically evaluates the association between GLUT1 overexpression and its prevalence in cancer tissues, highlighting its potential role as a diagnostic biomarker. Methods A comprehensive search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library was performed up to May 30, 2024, to identify observational studies and RCTs examining the association of GLUT1 expression with its prevalence in cancer tissues. Data were analyzed using random-effects models, and results were presented as Risk Ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analyses were performed based on cancer types and geographical locations. This meta-analysis focused on the diagnostic significance of GLUT1 expression in distinguishing cancer tissues from normal tissues. Publication bias and sensitivity analyses were assessed. Results Seventeen studies with 1,795 patients were included. GLUT1 overexpression was significantly associated with its prevalence in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues (RR = 5.57, 95% CI = 3.42–9.09, P p Conclusion GLUT1 overexpression is associated with its high prevalence in cancer tissues, particularly in urological and head and neck cancers. These findings suggest that GLUT1 may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker in oncology. However, this study does not evaluate survival outcomes (such as overall survival or progression-free survival), and further research is needed to determine its diagnostic significance and therapeutic potential.

This meta-analysis aims to provide insights into the potential significance of GLUT1 as a diagnostic biomarker in oncology. Materials and methods Design This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [ 13 14 Search strategy A comprehensive search was conducted in MEDLINE and the Cochrane Library up to May 30, 2024, utilizing a predefined PICO framework (Table 1  Table 1 PICO criteria for study inclusion in systematic review and Meta-Analysis on GLUT1 expression in cancer Criteria Description Participant(s) Individuals with cancer (any type) and corresponding non-cancer controls (when available). Intervention(s) GLUT1 expression levels in cancer tissues Comparison(s) GLUT1 expression in non-cancerous tissues or low/no GLUT1 expression within cancer populations. Outcome(s) Prevalence of GLUT1 overexpression in cancer tissues (diagnostic association). No survival outcomes (OS/PFS) analyzed. Study design(s) Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), retrospective observational studies and prospective observational studies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria During the initial screening, duplicate records, review articles, case reports, non-English publications, and studies lacking correlation coefficients between GLUT1 expression and cancer were excluded. This meta-analysis includes both observational studies (cohort and case-control) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to comprehensively assess the association between GLUT1 expression and its potential clinical significance in cancer. A total of 1795 patients from 17 studies were included in the quantitative analysis (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 PRISMA Flow Diagram Illustrating Study Selection Process. This figure outlines the identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion stages for studies in the systematic review and meta-analysis, detailing reasons for exclusion at each stage Data extraction To minimize bias in data abstraction, two investigators independently reviewed the full-text articles and extracted relevant information. The extracted data included the author’s name, year of publication, study population origin, cancer type, gender distribution, total number of patients, age, cancer stage, follow-up duration, mortality rates during the study, tissue sources, the methods used to assess GLUT1 expression, and cut-off definition (Table S1, see supplementary material). If trials did not explicitly report the number of patients with GLUT1 expression, statistical methods were applied to estimate the data. Any discrepancies between the investigators were resolved through discussion. Risk of bias assessment To assess the methodological quality of the included studies, two different tools were employed based on study design. For the three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0) was used via RevMan Web. This tool evaluates five domains: bias arising from the randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome, and selection of the reported result. Each domain was rated as “low risk,” “some concerns,” or “high risk” of bias. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus [ 13 For the observational studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was applied, which assesses studies based on selection of participants, comparability of study groups, and ascertainment of exposure or outcome. A maximum of nine stars could be awarded, with studies scoring seven or more stars considered high quality. Two independent reviewers conducted the assessment, and any disagreements were resolved through discussion until consensus was achieved. Publication bias and sensitivity analysis Publication bias and sensitivity analysis were assessed using the RevMan Web tool. P 15 Statistical analysis Heterogeneity among the included studies was evaluated using the I² statistic, with values greater than 50% indicating substantial heterogeneity. Risk Ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the diagnostic value of GLUT1 overexpression. A random-effects model was applied to account for heterogeneity across studies. Sensitivity analysis was conducted using the leave-one-out method to evaluate the robustness of the results. Publication bias was assessed using Begg’s and Egger’s tests, with a significance threshold set at P 16 Results Literature search and study characteristics The study selection process is illustrated in Fig. 1 1 17 33 27 23 31 Association of GLUT1 with various cancers It was found that GLUT1 was overexpressed in all of the cancer types included in this meta-analysis. The pooled data from 17 studies showed a Risk Ratio (RR) of 5.57 [3.42–9.09], indicating a significant diagnostic value of GLUT1 expression in cancer patients (Fig. 2 3  Fig. 2 Forest plot of the pooled Risk Ratio (RR) for the association between GLUT1 overexpression and its prevalence in cancer tissues. The meta-analysis of 17 studies ( n P  Fig. 3 Subgroup analysis of GLUT1 overexpression by cancer type. The forest plot illustrates the variation in diagnostic significance across different malignancies. Urological cancers exhibited the highest risk (RR = 20.56 [10.85–38.93]), followed by head and neck cancers (RR = 18.00 [2.66–121.63]), gynecological cancers (RR = 10.55 [2.06–54.00]), and gastrointestinal cancers (RR = 11.31 [0.92–138.43]). Lower RRs were observed in breast cancer (RR = 1.53 [1.40–1.68]) and bone and soft tissue sarcomas (RR = 4.51 [0.67–30.17]) Further subgroup analysis based on geographical locations indicated substantial differences in diagnostic value. Studies conducted in Europe reported the highest RR of 24.18 [13.37–43.73], followed by East Asia with a RR of 6.16 [2.69–14.15], and North America with a RR of 1.90 [1.32–2.73]. This geographical variability highlights potential population-specific influences on the diagnostic role of GLUT1. The results of the geographical subgroup analysis are presented in Fig. 4  Fig. 4 Subgroup analysis of GLUT1 overexpression by geographical location. The forest plot shows substantial geographical variations in the diagnostic significance of GLUT1. The highest RR was observed in European populations (RR = 24.18 [13.37–43.73]), followed by East Asia (RR = 6.16 [2.69–14.15]), while North America exhibited the lowest RR of 1.90 [1.32–2.73]. This variability suggests potential population-specific influences on the diagnostic role of GLUT1 Publication bias A visual examination of the funnel plot (Supplementary Fig. 1) suggested notable asymmetry, with a clear clustering of studies on the right side, indicating a possible small-study effect or publication bias. This was further supported by Egger’s test, conducted using JASP (v0.18.3), which yielded a statistically significant result (z = 4.667, p Sensitivity analyses The systematic exclusion of individual trials did not impact the overall results. Sensitivity analyses using leave-one-out forest plots confirmed that no single study disproportionately influenced the findings. The overall association between GLUT1 expression and various cancers remained consistent (Supplementary Fig. 3). Risk of bias assessment The three included randomized controlled trials were evaluated using the RoB 2.0 tool. Results showed low to moderate risk of bias across most domains, with no serious methodological limitations (Supplementary Fig. 2A and B). For the observational studies, the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used. Ten out of thirteen studies scored between 7 and 9 stars, indicating high methodological quality, while two studies scored 6 stars and one study scored 4 stars due to insufficient information on follow-up and comparability (Supplementary Table 2). Overall, the majority of studies were considered to have low risk of bias. Discussion GLUT1 is a major metabolic checkpoint determining glucose intake in cells. Highly charged TME is expected to upregulate GLUT1 in cancer cells as compared to nearby normal cells. Cancer cells edge highly competitive nutrient scenarios and upregulate metabolic checkpoint genes such as GLUT1 [ 34 35 36 37 38 In the meta-analysis of 17 studies, the overall risk ratio for the diagnostic value of GLUT1 expression in cancer patients was 5.57 [3.42–9.09]. Subgroup analysis based on cancer types revealed that urological cancers exhibited the highest risk ratio (RR = 20.56 [10.85–38.93]), followed by head and neck cancers (RR = 18.00 [2.66–121.63]), lung cancer (RR = 12.94 [0.24–683.74]), gastrointestinal cancers (RR = 11.31 [0.92–138.43]), gynecological cancers (RR = 10.55 [2.06–54.00]), adenocarcinomas (RR = 7.71 [0.45–132.83]), bone and soft tissue sarcomas (RR = 4.51 [0.67–30.17]), and breast cancer (RR = 1.53 [1.40–1.68]). Although several subgroups demonstrated relatively high-risk ratios, including gastrointestinal cancers, lung cancer, and adenocarcinomas, their associations with GLUT1 overexpression were not statistically significant, as indicated by wide confidence intervals that included the null value (RR = 1.0). This lack of significance may be attributed to small sample sizes, limited number of studies, and substantial variability in methodology or population characteristics. For example, gastrointestinal cancers were represented by only three studies with a total of 150 participants, which may reduce statistical power. Similarly, lung cancer and adenocarcinoma subgroups had fewer than 100 and 32 participants, respectively, across multiple studies. These limitations introduce heterogeneity and imprecision, emphasizing the need for cautious interpretation of subgroup findings based solely on RR magnitude. Subgroup analysis based on geographical locations indicated that studies conducted in Europe showed the highest risk ratio of 24.18 [13.37–43.73], followed by East Asia with an RR of 6.16 [2.69–14.15], and North America with an RR of 1.90 [1.32–2.73]. These findings highlight the frequent overexpression of GLUT1 in various cancer types and across different populations, supporting its role as a potential diagnostic biomarker. Metabolic alterations are a hallmark of cancer [ 1 39 40 41 42 43 However, it is important to clarify that this study evaluated the association of GLUT1 expression with cancerous versus normal tissues, and did not assess diagnostic test accuracy metrics (such as sensitivity, specificity, or area under the ROC curve). Thus, while GLUT1 overexpression is consistently observed in cancer tissues, its utility as a diagnostic biomarker cannot be confirmed based on our findings. Future studies should explore GLUT1’s diagnostic accuracy using robust statistical approaches such as ROC analysis, predictive values, and prospective validation in clinical settings. Conclusion GLUT1 overexpression is strongly associated with cancer tissues compared to normal tissues, supporting its role as a potential diagnostic biomarker. However, no survival data were analyzed, and thus its diagnostic significance remains unvalidated. Future studies focusing on clinical outcomes are needed to establish its diagnostic relevance. While this meta-analysis highlights the high prevalence of GLUT1 overexpression in cancer tissues, its utility as a standalone diagnostic marker is limited by non-specific expression in benign conditions [ 44 45 Limitations Although we have attempted to directly assess the role of GLUT1 overexpression in cancer tissues, our pooled data predominantly represent female patients, with approximately 78% of the included population being women. This gender imbalance likely reflects the overrepresentation of female-predominant cancers, such as breast and gynecological malignancies, rather than a selection bias. However, this limits the generalizability of our findings to male-dominant cancers such as prostate or liver cancer, which were underrepresented in the included studies. We did not conduct a sensitivity analysis excluding female-predominant cancers due to limitations in the available data and the scope of this meta-analysis. Nevertheless, it is important to consider that sex-specific biological differences and cancer epidemiology may influence GLUT1 expression patterns. Future studies should incorporate sex-stratified analyses to explore potential differences in GLUT1 prevalence and prognostic significance between male- and female-predominant cancers. Additionally, several subgroup analyses were based on a limited number of studies or participants, resulting in wide confidence intervals that included the null value, indicating non-significant associations despite seemingly elevated risk ratios. This highlights the risk of over interpretation and restricts our ability to draw definitive conclusions for certain cancer types, including gastrointestinal, lung, or adenocarcinomas, and underscores the need for larger, adequately powered studies to validate these associations. Moreover, most included studies were retrospective in nature, and while we attempted to incorporate data from both observational studies and randomized controlled trials, this may have introduced heterogeneity due to differences in study design, population characteristics, and outcome measurements. Despite this, we believe our comprehensive approach offers a broader perspective on the relationship between GLUT1 overexpression and cancer prevalence. One limitation of this study is the variation in GLUT1 positivity thresholds across studies—such as differences in staining intensity cut-offs or scoring systems—which may have introduced heterogeneity and affected the comparability of prevalence estimates.
