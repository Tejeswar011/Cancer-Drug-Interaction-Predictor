Primaryhyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a disorder of mineral metabolism caused by\ninappropriate or excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone. It occurs\nsporadically in approximately 95% of cases but may also be associated with\ncomplex syndromes and/or a familial (i.e., hereditary) history. We report the\nclinical, laboratory, and genetic profiles of a case series with familial\nisolated hyperparathyroidism. Diagnosis was established in patients aged 22-41\nyears (median = 32), and recurrence was identified in four patients (three with\nadenoma and one with hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma). Six family members\npresented with a heterozygous mutation in the CDC73 gene, and one patient had a\ncopy number variation of undetermined clinical significance in the same gene. In\naddition, we review the particularities of each condition associated with PHPT,\nindications for genetic evaluation, and recommendations for follow-up and\ntreatment.

This disease results from excessive production of PTH by one or more\nparathyroid glands, leading primarily to various complications in bones and kidneys\n( 1 2 In hereditary or familial forms, PHPT typically presents as part of a syndrome, the\nmost common being multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) ( 3 FIHP is a rare hereditary disorder with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern,\ncharacterized by PHPT in the absence of other diseases or tumors, such as those\nobserved in the aforementioned syndromes. Accurate identification of a family with\nFIHP is crucial for appropriate follow-up, with significant implications for the\ntreatment and genetic counseling of patients and their relatives ( 4 In this study, we report a family comprising 12 individuals, including several cases\nof PHPT unaccompanied by other associated conditions. Along with clinical and\nlaboratory assessments, we conducted a genetic evaluation of the major genes\nimplicated in familial hyperparathyroidism syndromes and compared our findings with\nthe existing scientific literature. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Our study examined 12 members of a three-generation family with cases of PHPT. During\nthe initial evaluation and subsequent follow-up, comprehensive clinical\nsurveillance, as well as laboratory and imaging tests, were performed, confirming\nthe absence of evidence for other genetic syndromes related to familial PHPT. All\npatients diagnosed with PHPT were evaluated for calcium metabolism (including\n24-hour urinary calcium excretion), pituitary hormonal abnormalities, and underwent\nabdominal and pelvic tomography, as well as cervical ultrasound. DNA extraction Blood samples were collected in the morning after an 8-hour fast. DNA extraction\nwas performed within 72 hours of blood collection. Genomic DNA was extracted\nfrom 300 µL of whole blood using the PureGene Blood Kit (Gentra,\nMinneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and\nreconstituted in 100 µL of DNA Hydration Solution provided with the\nkit. Genetic analysis Genetic analysis was conducted using next-generation sequencing to assess the\nfollowing genes: CASR (calcium-sensing receptor), CDC73 (cell division cycle\n73), CDKN1B (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B), GCM2 (glial cells missing\ntranscription factor 2), MEN1 (menin 1), and RET (ret proto-oncogene).

RESULTS Among the 12 patients who underwent genetic research, we included the asymptomatic\nspouse of the index case. The spouse was screened; however, they did not present any\nsymptoms nor had a diagnosis of PHPT, demonstrating normal examination results and\ndid not have mutations related to PHPT. Among the other ten family members, seven\nwere asymptomatic, and the analyses were performed as part of a cascade\nscreening. The diagnosis of PHPT was established between the ages of 22-41 years (median = 32\nyears), and recurrence was identified in four patients.

Square: males; circle: females; diagonal slash: deceased; black square:\nheterozygous mutation in the CDC73 gene. A heterozygous pathogenic variant was found in the CDC73 gene, characterized by the\nreplacement of aspartate with tyrosine at codon 90 in seven family members. This\nmutation was initially described as a clinical variant of undetermined significance.\nSince these patients had a confirmed diagnosis of PHPT, we can consider that this\nmutation, previously described as a variant of undetermined significance, is in fact\npathogenic. Copy number variations of undetermined clinical significance were\nidentified in one family member (19 years old, patient IV.18), who remained\nasymptomatic (no clinical or laboratory evidence of PHPT) at the time of\nevaluation. III.11 (index case) A 32-year-old male patient was diagnosed with PHPT in 1999 due to joint pain,\nfatigue, nausea, and nephrolithiasis, which led to subsequent left nephrectomy.\nIn 2002, he underwent a partial parathyroidectomy, with removal of three\nparathyroid glands and half of the fourth, as well as autotransplantation in the\nleft upper limb. Histopathology (HP) revealed parathyroid hyperplasia. He\nexperienced relapses with subsequent parathyroid surgeries in 2004, 2006, and\n2010, with only hyperplasia identified in the HP from these procedures. In February 2011, the patient was hospitalized with body aches, nausea, and\nheadache, associated with hypercalcemia. Initially, clinical treatment was\nconducted to control hypercalcemia, and the fifth surgery was performed in May\n2011, at which time metastatic parathyroid carcinoma was diagnosed.\nHistopathology identified a 3.7 cm parathyroid tumor, a 2.5 cm metastatic\nparatracheal lesion with vascular invasion, compromised soft tissue surgical\nmargins, and metastasis in a cervical lymph node. The patient also underwent\npostoperative radiotherapy and treatment for hungry bone syndrome. He\nexperienced persistent hypocalcemia until October 2011, when PTH and calcium\nlevels increased again. A chest computed tomography scan revealed a cystic\nlesion in the posterior segment of the upper lobe of the left lung. Clinical control of calcium was initially managed with cinacalcet, furosemide,\nand zoledronic acid; however, due to progressive increases in PTH and calcium, a\nnew chest computed tomography scan was performed, which demonstrated the\nappearance of new thoracic lesions. Four additional surgical interventions were\nperformed to excise the metastases, and the patient was monitored clinically. He\nsubsequently died due to complications related to hypercalcemia and progression\nof tumor lesions. II.4 A female patient presented with weakness, adynamia, and pain in both hip joints,\nwith restricted walking, beginning at 30 years of age. During her first\nconsultation, a palpable nodule was detected in the lower aspect of the thyroid\nregion. A bone biopsy provided histopathological evidence of fibrous cystic\nosteitis, leading to the diagnosis of PHPT. She experienced a spontaneous\nfracture of the left femur during hospitalization for surgical treatment of\nPHPT. Thereafter, a right lower parathyroidectomy was performed, with\nidentification of a parathyroid adenoma. During surgery, the superior\nparathyroid glands were not identified. In the postoperative period, she experienced transient hypoparathyroidism and\nlost outpatient follow-up, returning only 11 years after the first surgery. At\nthat time, she presented with hypercalcemia and a left superior nodule\nidentified by cervical ultrasound. Surgical treatment was indicated, and the\nupper left parathyroid was removed (HP diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma). She\ncontinued to have renal hypercalciuria, necessitating initiation of\nhydrochlorothiazide therapy. She is currently monitored for osteopenia\n(diagnosed thirty years after the first surgery), with normal PTH and calcium\nlevels. III.8 A 28-year-old male patient presented with complaints of asthenia and cramps,\naccompanied by laboratory tests PHPT. Scintigraphy and ultrasound suggested the\npresence of a parathyroid adenoma in the lower left parathyroid gland. One year\nlater, a left parathyroidectomy was performed, along with a partial\nthyroidectomy on the same side. The diagnosis of parathyroid adenoma was\nconfirmed, and normal thyroid tissue was observed. He remains asymptomatic, with\nnormal PTH and calcium levels. III.10 A 41-year-old female patient was referred for PHPT screening. She was\nasymptomatic but had elevated PTH and calcium levels. Scintigraphy results were\nnormal; however, ultrasound revealed bilateral nodules suggestive of parathyroid\nenlargement. A subtotal thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy were performed,\ninvolving resection of all four parathyroid glands, with implantation of half of\nthe upper left parathyroid into the left sternocleidomastoid muscle.\nHistopathological examination identified parathyroid adenomas and normal thyroid\ntissue. The patient experienced transient hypoparathyroidism, after which she\nremained asymptomatic, with normal PTH and calcium levels. III.13 A 40-year-old asymptomatic female patient attended a screening consultation.\nPhysical examination revealed a nodule in the lower third of the thyroid region.\nInitial laboratory evaluation showed hypercalcemia, and ultrasound suggested\nenlargement of the right upper and lower parathyroid glands. Surgical\nintervention included removal of both glands, with histopathology confirming\nadenomas in both. Twelve years later, she experienced a recurrence of PHPT;\nscintigraphy was normal, but ultrasound indicated an enlargement of the lower\nleft parathyroid. Surgery was performed to remove the lower left parathyroid\ngland. The patient remains under clinical follow-up, without any clinical or\nlaboratory evidence of PHPT. IV.15 An asymptomatic male patient underwent his first evaluation for PHPT screening at\n22 years old. Initial laboratory investigations revealed increased PTH and\ncalcium levels, and cervical ultrasound identified a nodule suggestive of\nparathyroid enlargement. Scintigraphy further suggested a parathyroid adenoma in\nthe lower left side. The patient missed subsequent appointments and returned two\nyears later, at which time surgical resection of the adenoma was performed.\nSince then, no clinical or laboratory findings of PHPT have been identified. DISCUSSION This report describes a case series of FIHP in a three-generation Brazilian family\ncomprising 12 members, of whom seven, aged 22-41 years, were diagnosed with FIHP. In\nsix members, a heterozygous mutation in the CDC73 gene was identified, while copy\nnumber variations of undetermined clinical significance were observed in one\npatient. The affected individuals exhibited PHPT without any clinical or biochemical\nevidence of MEN1, MEN2, FHH, or hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, thereby\nfulfilling the diagnostic criteria for FIHP. Since FIHP was first described in the\n1930s, its evaluation and definition have posed challenges, largely due to the small\nnumber of affected relatives and the presence of mildly symptomatic cases. In our\nstudy, a greater number of affected relatives was identified than previously\nreported in the literature, which documents an average of two affected relatives per\nfamily ( 5 Genetic testing plays a key role in identifying mutations associated with inherited\nsyndromes involving PHPT. Such testing aids in distinguishing hereditary from\nsporadic cases and enables early detection of individuals at risk for other\nassociated diseases within these syndromes, even before the onset of clinical\nmanifestations. Furthermore, genetic tests help confirm the diagnosis in cases where\npatients with PHPT present with additional diseases or neoplasms, such as pituitary\nor pancreatic nodules or jaw tumors. Genetic testing is also crucial for identifying\nfamily members who carry the same genetic mutation so that they can receive\nappropriate monitoring and treatment, even in the absence of symptoms. For\nunaffected family members, a negative genetic test result can eliminate the need for\nongoing follow-up or further investigations, thereby reducing both costs and anxiety\nfor these individuals ( 2 Table 3 Table 3 Indications for testing for genetic mutations in PHPT patients No. Description 1 PHPT occurring before 45 years 2 Multigland disease 3 Parathyroid carcinoma or atypical\nparathyroid adenomas (e.g., with fibrous bands or cysts) 4 Being a first-degree relative of a known\nmutation carrier 5 Being an index case with two or more MEN\nsyndrome-associated endocrine tumors Adapted from Reference 6. PHPT: primary hyperparathyroidism; MEN:\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia. Our index patient met the first three criteria described above. The identification of\na CDC73 pathogenic variant in this patient led to further research involving other\nfamily members. CDC73 mutations are found in 5%-10% of probands presenting with FIHP\nand in 20%-30% of patients with sporadically presenting parathyroid carcinoma\n( 4 4 In genetic or familial forms, PHPT typically arises as part of a syndrome. The most\ncommon is MEN1, an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from germline pathogenic\nvariants in the MEN1 gene, characterized by involvement of multiple parathyroid\nglands, pituitary adenomas, and pancreatic tumors ( 6 7 9 10 11 In multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), which also demonstrates autosomal\ndominant inheritance, pathogenic variants are present in the RET gene. MEN2A is\ncharacterized by medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. PHPT may be\npresent in approximately 25% of MEN2A cases and has lower penetrance than in MEN1\n( 12 13 14 Hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome arises through autosomal inheritance, and PHPT\nis the most prevalent feature; the syndrome can also involve ossifying fibromas of\nthe jaw and maxilla and has a higher prevalence of parathyroid carcinoma than MEN1\nand MEN2A (approximately 15% of cases) ( 15 16 17 16 Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare condition characterized by low urinary\ncalcium levels, with slightly elevated blood calcium and PTH levels. It is caused by\npathogenic variants in the CASR gene present in the parathyroid glands and renal\ntubules. These patients are typically asymptomatic and should be evaluated in the\npresence of hypocalciuria and a family history of hypercalcemia or parathyroidectomy\nwithout criteria for cure ( 12 Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism is a rare hereditary disorder accounting for\napproximately 1% of PHPT cases ( 18 5 18 3 Table 4 Table 4 Syndromes associated with primary hyperparathyroidism MEN1 MEN2 MEN4 HPT-JT FHH FIHP Inheritance AD AD AD AD AD AD PHPT prevalence 95% 20%-30% 80%-90% 80%-90% 20% with elevated PTH 100% Clinical Conditions Tumors of the parathyroid, pancreatic\nislet cells and anterior pituitary Medullary Tumors involve the parathyroid glands,\nanterior pituitary, and gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine\ntissues.

MEN: multiple endocrine neoplasia; HPT-JT:\nhyperparathyroid jaw-tumor syndrome; FHH: familiar hypocalciuric\nhypercalcemia; FIHP: familial isolated hyperparathyroidism; PHP: primary\nhyperparathyroidism; AD: autossomic dominant. The strengths of this study include the elucidation of a rare cause of PHPT through\ngenetic testing and the capacity to conduct genetic counseling, even in asymptomatic\ncases. A limitation of this study was its retrospective design, which restricted the\nevaluation of certain patient data and information. In conclusion, genetic forms of PHPT are rare and may present as part of various\nsyndromes or in isolation. This case series of FIHP highlights a family with six\ncases of PHPT occurring in younger patients, with recurrence of PHPT in four\nindividuals and one case of parathyroid carcinoma among family members. All patients\nhad a mutation in the CDC73 gene. Proper suspicion and identification of familial\nPHPT allow for adequate monitoring, clinical guidance, treatment, and genetic\ncounseling for affected kindreds.
